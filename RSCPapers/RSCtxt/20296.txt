    , Accepted 17th May 2011First published on 26th May 2011AbstractThe significant role of perovskite defect chemistry brought about by the A-site doping of strontium titanate with lanthanum on high temperature steam electrolysis properties is demonstrated. Solid oxide electrolysis cells based on oxygen-excess La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ, A-site-deficient La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and undoped SrTiO3 perovskite hydrogen electrodes (cathodes) were considered. Steam electrolysis performance was largely independent of the presence or absence of hydrogen in the cathode inlet, reflecting the redox stability of perovskites and representing a possible advantage over the state-of-the-art Ni/yttria-stabilised zirconia cermet cathode. Electrochemical testing in 47%H2O/53%N2 atmosphere at 900 °C revealed La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ to be the best in terms of highest current density and lowest polarisation resistance, followed by La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3. Surface area effects, electronic conductivity and oxide ion mobility were considered to be among the determining factors. Furthermore a dramatic order-of-magnitude difference between the characteristic relaxation frequencies of oxygen-excess and A-site-deficient titanates was observed. Steam partial pressure (pH2O)-dependency measurements revealed an added benefit of La-doping in that series resistance (Rs) was independent of pH2O for (La,Sr)TiO3 perovskites, while Rs increased with pH2O for undoped SrTiO3. Electrochemical testing was complemented by X-ray diffraction, electronic conductivity, particle size, BET, porosity and scanning electron microscopy measurements.
1. Introduction
High temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) is a highly efficient process for the production of pure hydrogen using a combination of electrical and thermal energy, and is environmentally clean provided that the electricity comes from a renewable source (e.g. solar, wind, wave). The process could also be used in the scalable long term storage of surplus electricity generated from intermittent renewables in the form of hydrogen, with the added possibility of using this hydrogen as a transportation fuel.1HTSE is carried out using a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), which is essentially a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operated in reverse. That is, steam is electrochemically reduced to hydrogen gas and oxide ions at the hydrogen electrode (cathode), followed by oxide ion movement across the solid electrolyte to the oxygen electrode (anode) where oxygen is evolved.
The advantage of performing steam electrolysis at high temperature is demonstrated by the relationship between total energy demand (ΔG), electrical energy demand (ΔH) and thermal energy demand (TΔS) as presented in Fig. 1.2 Significantly, electrical energy demand decreases as temperature increases, while thermal energy demand increases and the total energy demand rises slightly. That is, the proportion of energy in the form of electricity required for the electrolysis of steam decreases at higher temperatures. In addition to favourable thermodynamics, operation at high temperatures results in faster electrode kinetics, which minimises internal device losses.
 Fig. 1  Energy demand of steam electrolysis demonstrating the advantage of lowered electrical energy demand at high temperatures.2 
Depending on the amount of electrical power used to electrolyse steam, 3 modes of operation are possible, namely thermoneutral, exothermal and endothermal.3 Thermoneutral mode is observed when the Joule heating generated by the passage of electrical current within the device equals the heat consumed by the endothermic reduction of steam, yielding an electrical-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency (hereafter referred to as efficiency) of 100%. The exothermal mode of operation is observed when the Joule heating exceeds the heat consumed by the reduction of steam, leading to heating of the electrolysis cell and efficiency of <100%. In the endothermal mode, the Joule heating is less than the heat consumed by the reduction of steam, and so an external heat source is required and >100% efficiency is observed. Examples of external heat sources that have been practically and theoretically considered for HTSE include nuclear,4–7 solar8,9 and geothermal.6,10
Initial research demonstrating the high efficiency of HTSE took place in the 1980's and was carried out within the HotElly project11,12 and by Westinghouse.13 More recently significant interest has come from a number of research groups14–22 and has been largely concerned with performance, stability and degradation issues relating to highly developed SOFC materials. Such materials have formed a starting point for SOEC development and primarily include Ni/yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) cermet for the cathode and (La,Sr)MnO3 for the anode.
Few studies have considered alternative materials to Ni/YSZ for the SOEC cathode, and these have included the utilisation of La0.35Sr0.65TiO323 and (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O324 perovskites. A primary motivation for the investigation of alternative SOEC cathode materials is the instability of Ni/YSZ to redox cycling, which in practise necessitates the feeding a small quantity of protecting hydrogen at the electrolysis cell cathode inlet in order to avoid the formation of NiO at low or zero electrolysis current density. In contrast, oxide ceramics, such as the perovskites, are generally stable to redox cycling and could therefore be operated without the requirement of protecting hydrogen in the electrolysis cell cathode inlet. In addition, aliovalent doping of the A-site of ABO3 perovskites, for example, would allow properties to be tuned specifically to meet the demands of HTSE, such as operation under high steam partial pressure (pH2O) and strongly reducing environment.
La-doped strontium titanates exhibit favourable chemical, dimensional, redox, thermal and mechanical stability.25 In addition, these perovskites demonstrate good electronic conductivity under reducing conditions due to the formation of the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple, which is particularly suitable for the reducing environment encountered at the electrolysis cell cathode. Lattice defect formation is made possible by aliovalent doping of the A-site of SrTiO3, whereby some of the divalent Sr2+ cations are substituted with trivalent La3+ cations. The defect chemistries considered here are oxygen-excess (ABO3+δ) and A-site deficiency (A1-xBO3).
This study considers La-doped strontium titanates as alternative electrolysis cell cathode materials to Ni/YSZ. The influence of defect chemistry on steam electrolysis properties in particular is investigated by comparing oxygen-excess (La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ) and A-site deficient (La0.2Sr0.7TiO3) titanates. La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ is part of the LaxSr1-xTiO3+δ series (x = 0.3) that has been previously investigated as an SOFC anode material and is characterised by local oxygen-rich defects randomly distributed within the perovskite framework,26 while La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 is part of the LaxSr1−3x/2TiO3 series (x = 0.2) that has been shown to be a promising SOFC anode material when utilised in combination with a Pd/CeO2 catalyst.27 The role of La-doping is also addressed by parallel consideration of the parent perovskite SrTiO3.
2. Experimental

        La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ, La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3 were prepared via solid state synthesis as follows. Stoichiometric quantities of La2O3 (dried at 900 °C) and SrCO3 and TiO2 (both dried at 300 °C) were dispersed in acetone using a sonic probe (Hielscher UP200S) for 20 min. Excess acetone was evaporated with magnetic stirring at room temperature before mixtures were calcined at 1000 °C for 12 h. Calcined powder mixtures were placed in acetone and milled in a planetary ball mill (Fritsch pulverisette 7) at 500 rpm for 2 h using 10 mm diameter zirconia balls. Recovered dried powders were pressed uniaxially under 145 MPa load into pellets that were sintered in air at 1450 °C for 12 h. As-sintered pellets of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ and SrTiO3 were pale yellow in colour, suggesting that no Ti3+ was present. In contrast, the as-sintered pellet of La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 had a dark grey metallic appearance, suggesting the presence of some Ti3+. Sintered pellets were broken up with a mortar and pestle and then milled, pressed and sintered as described above. Final product powders were obtained by breaking up sintered pellets, milling as described above, and then an additional intensive milling step at 1000 rpm for 30 min using 1 mm diameter zirconia balls in order to obtain fine powders.
Perovskite fine powders were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size analysis and BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) measurement. XRD spectra were obtained using a STOE Stadi transmission diffractometer with Cu-Kα1 radiation, while the crystal structure and unit cell parameter were determined using STOE WinXPOW software. Particle size analysis was carried out on a Malvern Instruments Mastersizer 2000 with Hydro S sample dispersion unit. BET measurements were taken on a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 instrument.
Electrical properties of (La,Sr)TiO3 perovskites were measured on pellet samples prepared by pressing powders uniaxially under 145 MPa load followed by sintering at 1450 °C for 12 h. Pellet densities were ∼90% compared to theoretical densities calculated from XRD spectra. The four-point-probe method was used to measure the conductivity of pellets, with 4x parallel platinum strips affixed to each pellet using platinum paste followed by 1 h firing at 900 °C under 5%H2/Ar atmosphere, which also allowed for the pre-reduction of pellets. Samples were characterised in a vertical furnace containing a zirconia oxygen partial pressure (pO2) sensor. The isothermal pO2-dependency of conductivity was determined by starting at low pO2 under 5%H2/Ar flow and moving slowly toward ambient pO2 by turning off the 5%H2/Ar flow and allowing air to leak into the furnace.
The architecture of electrolyte-supported, button-type electrolysis cells is depicted in Fig. 2. The electrolyte was a 0.2 cm thick, 2.0 cm diameter pellet of YSZ with density of ∼96%, which was prepared via uniaxial pressing of commercial YSZ powder under 35 MPa load followed by sintering at 1500 °C for 12 h. Inks for the screen-printing of cathodes and anodes were prepared using synthesised (La,Sr)TiO3 and SrTiO3 powders and commercial YSZ and (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3 (LSM) powders. Initially ceramic powders were dispersed in acetone using 2 wt.% Hypermer™ KD1 dispersant and an ultrasonic probe for 10 min. To this dispersion was added a vehicle consisting of 5 wt.% poly(vinyl butyrate) in terpineol, so that a ceramic:vehicle mass ratio of 70:30 was obtained, and the mixture was magnetically stirred at room temperature overnight to evaporate the acetone and yield the final ink. Titanate cathodes and LSM-based anodes were processed using a semi-automatic screen-printer (DEK 248) through a 325 mesh on either side of YSZ pellets with drying between layers, followed by co-sintering at 1100 °C for 2 h. Electrolysis cells were completed by the application of gold paste (T10112, Metalor Technologies UK Ltd.) in a radial pattern for current collection and firing at 900 °C for 1 h.

The surface area of sintered titanate cathodes was estimated by the following method. Inks were screen-printed onto 5 × 5 cm alumina plates to 2× layers thickness with drying between layers. Screen-printed large area films were then sintered at 1100 °C for 2 h before being gently scraped off the alumina substrate yielding ∼100 mg of material in each case. This material was characterised by BET and the result considered a good indication of the specific surface area (SSA) of sintered electrolysis cell cathodes. These SSA values were important in the interpretation of electrolysis cell testing results, since they allowed separation of surface area and defect chemistry effects.
The titanate cathode side of electrolysis cells was sealed to the alumina tube of the testing jig using a high temperature ceramic adhesive (Aremco Ceramabond™ 552) and the jig placed within a vertical furnace. The delivery of steam to the electrolysis cell cathode was based around a controlled evaporator mixer (CEM, Bronkhorst W-202A). H2 and N2 flows were controlled using gas mass flow controllers (Aalborg), while H2O flow was controlled by a valve integrated within the CEM that was linked via a feedback loop to a liquid flow meter (Bronkhorst L13). The H2O supply to the CEM was pressurised using N2 gas for the purpose of stable operation. Controlled gas and H2O flows were mixed within the CEM and simultaneously heated to a temperature above the dew point to produce the H2O/H2/N2 reactant stream, which was delivered to the electrolysis cell cathode through tubing heated to above the dew point in order to avoid condensation. The dew point of the vapour flow was monitored upstream and downstream of the electrolysis cell using dew point probes (Vaisala HMT337). In addition, compressed air was continuously passed over the LSM-based anode during electrolysis experiments.
Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of electrolysis cells were measured in a 2-electrode, full-device arrangement using an electrochemical interface (Solartron 1287) and CorrWare v3.1c software (Scribner Associates). Measurements were carried out by initially conditioning the electrolysis cell cathode at −1.7 V bias prior to running linear sweep voltammetry from −1.7 V to −0.4 V at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of electrolysis cells was carried out in a 3-electrode, half-device arrangement using the above electrochemical interface, a frequency response analyser (Solartron 1255) and ZPlot v3.1c and ZView v3.1c software (Scribner Associates). The 3-electrode arrangement was realised by the use of a reference electrode on the anode side of the electrolysis cell (Fig. 2) and allowed the characteristics of titanate cathodes to be separated from the LSM-based anode. Measurements were immediately preceded by a conditioning step involving the application of −1.5 V bias before EIS was carried out under a bias of −1.5 V, AC perturbation of 100 mV amplitude and over the frequency range 1 MHz-0.1 Hz.
Following I–V and EIS measurements, electrochemical cells were removed destructively from the testing jig and the microstructure of resultant fractured cross-sectional surfaces analysed on a JEOL JSM-5600 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Sample preparation involved the setting of samples in epoxy resin followed by evaporation of a thin layer of gold in order to avoid charging during analysis.
3. Results and discussion

X-ray diffraction, electrical properties, particle size analysis, BET analysis and cathode microstructure

XRD analysis of powder samples revealed that all compositions were pure phase cubic perovskites (Fig. 3). Since internal standards were not used during XRD analysis, the unit cell parameters shown in Table 1 were somewhat in error compared to literature values.28,29 However, this did not translate to any significant error in theoretical densities and porosities calculated from unit cell parameters.

Due to the significant electronic conductivities observed in Fig. 4, it would be difficult to confirm from EIS measurements if these were bulk values, however previous studies on another (La,Sr)TiO3 composition suggested that grain boundaries were unlikely to be blocking.30Fig. 4a revealed that for both La-doped titanates a semiconductor-to-metallic transition was observed with increasing temperature. This transition was highly dependent on defect chemistry and occurred at ∼560 °C for La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ and at ∼60 °C for La0.2Sr0.7TiO3. The extraordinary difference of ∼500 °C between the semiconductor-to-metallic transition temperatures for the oxygen-excess and A-site deficient titanates demonstrated the significant influence of defect chemistry on material properties, a theme that will reappear when considering electrolysis cell cathode characteristics. At 900 °C electronic conductivities of 3.8 S cm−1 and 4.0 S cm−1 were measured for dense pellets of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ and La0.2Sr0.7TiO3, respectively. It has been suggested that for well-distributed current collection in an SOFC anode, electronic conductivity of ∼1 S cm−1 for the porous structure (∼10 S cm−1 in dense pellet form) would be required.31 Using this as a guide, and considering that n-type La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ and La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 would be expected to improve in the eletrochemically and chemically reducing environment of an SOEC cathode under operation, the observed electrical conductivities appear to be close to the threshold requirement. However, in order to ensure good current collection in this study, a dedicated gold current collector was used in electrolysis cells.

The isothermal electronic conductivity at 1173 K as log pO2 was allowed to increase very slowly is illustrated for a La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ dense pellet in Fig. 4b. Conductivity was observed to decrease steadily with increasing pO2, characteristic of n-type electronic conductivity and similar to previous reports on the same material.25,32 A dense pellet of La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 also exhibited n-type behaviour similar to a previous report on the same material,27 however the result is not shown here on account of the fact that the increase in pO2 was too rapid, meaning that the sample was not close to equilibrium as conductivity measurements were recorded. The electrical properties of the undoped parent perovskite SrTiO3 were not determined as part of this study, however this material is a known n-type conductor under reducing conditions.33 The observed n-type conductivity of both (La,Sr)TiO3 perovskites confirmed the suitability of these materials for the highly reducing environment, both electrochemically and chemically, encountered at the electrolysis cell cathode during steam electrolysis.
The particle size distribution of all powders (Fig. 5) showed a peak particle size of between ∼1.0–1.6 μm (Table 1) and a significant proportion of particles with size ∼0.2 μm. The detection of relatively small particles, considering especially that all powders were prepared via solid state synthesis, was made possible by the intense milling conditions employed and could ensure a reasonable SSA of powders and resultant sintered electrolysis cell cathodes (Table 1). The particle morphology of titanate powders was revealed by SEM (Fig. 6). The La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ powder was characterised by rounded particles, in contrast to the morphology of La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3 powders, which were composed of faceted particles.

The observed decreases in SSA in going from starting powder to sintered electrolysis cell cathode (Δ(SSA) values, Table 1) may be attributed to the thermodynamic tendency towards lowered surface-to-volume ratio. This may be achieved via the processes of Ostwald ripening and necking of adjacent particles during sintering. It is considered here that the observed Δ(SSA) values indicated sufficient sintering and therefore adequate inter-particle connectivity for all compositions, although the extent of sintering varied between samples. Values for sintered cathode porosity and Δ(SSA) were in accordance with expectations when comparing La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3 compositions, whereby greater extent of sintering (indicated by a higher (absolute) Δ(SSA) value) would be expected to yield lower porosity. However, the results for La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ paradoxically showed the lowest porosity for the lowest extent of sintering. This contrast may be explained by the denser particle packing expected during the screen-printing of cathodes in the case of rounded La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ particles compared to faceted La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3 particles (Fig. 6).
Cross-sectional SEM images of sintered and tested electrolysis cell cathodes on dense YSZ electrolyte substrates are shown in Fig. 7, and indicated a narrow range of film thicknesses of between 10.5–11.6 μm (Table 1). The observed microstructures were in qualitative agreement with the calculated porosity values. That is, the denser appearance of the La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ cathode matched well with the corresponding lower porosity value, in contrast to La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3 cathodes, which appeared less dense and demonstrated correspondingly higher porosity values.

High temperature steam electrolysis properties with or without hydrogen present in the cathode inlet

Fig. 8 shows the results of full-device, 2-electrode I–V testing, and half-device, 3-electrode EIS testing under −1.5 V bias for a La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ-based electrolysis cell at 900 °C with or without hydrogen present in the cathode inlet. Measurements in reducing 47%H2O/3%H2/50%N2 (pO2 = 1.5 × 10−14) were carried out initially before switching to more oxidising 47%H2O/53%N2 (pO2 = 1.4 × 10−6) and waiting ∼10 min prior to recording I–V and then EIS measurements. Considering that during measurements carried out in 47%H2O/53%N2 the environment became more reducing with the production of hydrogen, the electrolysis cell cathode underwent 1× mild redox cycle prior to the I–V measurement and 2× mild redox cycles prior to the EIS measurement.

(a) current–voltage (I–V) curves and (b) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under −1.5 V bias. All measurements were carried out at 900 °C. 

          HTSE performance was largely independent of the presence or absence of hydrogen in the cathode inlet, despite the mild redox cycling of the La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ cathode prior to measurements in 47%H2O/53%N2 atmosphere. Similar results were obtained for an electrolysis cell with La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 cathode (not shown). This property of (La,Sr)TiO3 cathodes constitutes a possible advantage over the benchmark Ni/YSZ cermet cathode material, which is not stable to redox cycling and therefore requires the constant supply of a small amount of hydrogen to the cathode inlet in order to avoid the formation of NiO at low or zero steam electrolysis current density. In contrast, HTSE using (La,Sr)TiO3 cathodes would conceivably avoid the requirement for any hydrogen to be supplied to the cathode inlet, thereby simplifying SOEC stack design and possibly lowering cost.
The z-shaped I–V curves in Fig. 8a were indicative of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ cathode re-oxidation as the applied (absolute) electrolysis potential decreased to below some critical level. The release of electrons due to the oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ led to a transient increase in the apparent electrolysis current density, which manifested itself in the z-shaped I–V curves. The onset potential of this phenomenon corresponded with the steam electrolysis onset potential at ∼−1.1 V, meaning that La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ cathode re-oxidation commenced as steam electrolysis and hydrogen production ceased and the local pO2 rose.
High temperature steam electrolysis testing and the influence of doping and defect chemistry on properties
The results of full-device, 2-electrode I–V testing and half-device, 3-electrode EIS analysis under −1.5 V bias for electrolysis cells based on La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ, La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3 cathodes are illustrated in Fig. 9. The modest HTSE current densities observed during I–V testing (Fig. 9a) were at least partly due to the use of a 0.2 cm thick YSZ pellet electrolyte, which contributed to the series resistance (Rs) of devices considerably, in addition to polarisation resistance (Rp) attributed to the cathode. HTSE performance was gauged by the (absolute) current density observed in I–V curves, which is directly proportional to the quantity of hydrogen produced from the electrolysis of steam. The results indicated that La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ was the best followed by La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3.

All measurements were carried out at 900 °C in 47%H2O/53%N2 atmosphere. Equivalent circuit used to fit EIS data (d), where L = inductor, Rs = series resistance, Rp = polarisation resistance and CPE = constant-phase-element. 
The difference between the performance of electrolysis cells based on La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ and La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 cathodes could be predominantly attributed to the doubled SSA of the former (5.5 m2 g−1) compared to the latter (2.7 m2 g−1), which would have corresponded to a proportionally greater number of active sites available for the reduction of steam and release of hydrogen. By taking the SSA of sintered cathodes into account in this way it appeared that the defect chemistry of La-doped titanates did not significantly influence outright steam electrolysis performance. This demonstrates the importance of the sintered cathode SSA measurements made in this study, which allowed the separation of surface area and defect chemistry effects. Allowing for surface area effects, the similar steam electrolysis performance of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ and La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 may possibly be explained by the similar interaction of steam with the electrocatalytically active B-site, occupied in both cases by Ti. Furthermore the supply of electrons to, and removal of oxide ions from, the active site was similar in both cases since electronic conductivities (Fig. 4a) and oxide ion mobilities (considered later on) were similar. The better performance observed for electrolysis cells based on La-doped titanates compared to undoped SrTiO3 was not due to surface area effects but rather due to improved electronic conductivity and oxide ion mobility brought about by the formation of lattice defects.
The I–V curves presented in Fig. 9a for La0.2Sr0.7TiO3- and SrTiO3-based electrolysis cells did not show the same z-shape as for the electrolysis cell based on La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ, suggesting slower kinetics of the  re-oxidation for La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3 cathodes compared to the La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ cathode. Reasons for this may have included the higher SSA of the La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ cathode (Table 1), higher oxygen vacancy concentration and faster oxygen vacancy diffusion and surface exchange.
Rs and Rp values are summarised in Table 2 and were obtained by fitting the equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. 9d (where L and CPE represent inductor and constant-phase-element, respectively) to the EIS data presented in Fig. 9b,c. The equivalent circuit was fitted to the predominant impedance arc and high frequency responses only. Impedance due to gas diffusion at frequencies below 1 Hz was not considered due to insufficient data and in order to not compromise the quality of the fit. Moreover, impedance due to gas diffusion is a manifestation of electrode microstructure and is not reflective of electrode chemistry. Relaxation frequencies for (Rp1,CPE1) and (Rp2,CPE2) elements were between 104–103 Hz and 103–101 Hz, respectively. Particular to the fitting of EIS data for the electrolysis cell based on La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ, the predominant impedance arc overlapped with the (Rp1,CPE1) element, and so the modified equivalent circuit L|Rs|(Rp2,CPE2) was used instead. Therefore Rp for the La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ-based electrolysis cell was equal to Rp2, while Rp for electrolysis cells based on La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3 was equal to Rp1 + Rp2.

          Rp values were in accordance with the results of I–V testing discussed above, in the order La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ < La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 < SrTiO3. The reasons for the differences observed in Rp values were one and the same with those described above i.e. SSA, electronic conductivity and oxide ion mobility. The possibility of improved oxide ion mobility with La-doping is discussed later on by considering the effect on electrolysis performance of blending the oxide ion conductor YSZ with strontium titanates to afford composite electrolysis cell cathodes. The best Rp value obtained here (1.4 Ω cm2) was similar to results obtained for (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Cr0.5Mn0.5O324 electrolysis cell cathodes, however substantially higher compared to La0.35Sr0.65TiO3/Ce0.5La0.5O1.7523 and state-of-the-art Ni/YSZ2 cathodes, although differences in testing temperatures and cathode inlet compositions make direct comparisons difficult.
Considering further the Nyquist plots in Fig. 9b, it was also revealed that La-doping led to the significant lowering of Rs by ∼1 Ω cm2 compared to undoped SrTiO3. This may be attributed to the known higher electronic conductivity of (La,Sr)TiO3 perovskites compared to the parent SrTiO3 perovskite.25,33

Fig. 9c shows the Bode plots from the EIS analysis of electrolysis cells based on different titanates. Defect chemistry greatly influenced the characteristic relaxation frequency of the main limiting process, as summarised in Table 2. Specifically, a relaxation frequency of 710 Hz was observed for oxygen-excess La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ, which was more than an order of magnitude faster compared to the relaxation frequency of 60 Hz observed for A-site deficient La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 (and SrTiO3). This large difference between La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ and La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 may possibly be explained by the difference in the way that oxide ions diffuse through these structures under reducing conditions. Assuming that reduction of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ proceeds to a significant extent via the loss of labile oxygen from randomly distributed, local oxygen-rich defects, then the diffusion of oxide ions would be influenced by this feature specific to oxygen-excess defect chemistry. In contrast and in the case of La0.2Sr0.7TiO3, oxide ions would be expected to diffuse between oxygen vacancies via the bottleneck defined by the triangle A-B-A,34 although such movement within an A-site deficient lattice would be easier compared to movement within a lattice exhibiting full A-site occupancy. In an attempt to further understand defect chemistry-dependency of steam electrolysis properties, hydrogen partial pressure (pH2)- and pH2O-dependency was investigated and the results are presented later on.
Effects of blending the oxide ion conductor yttria-stabilised zirconia into titanate-based solid oxide electrolysis cell cathodes
The effects of blending the oxide ion conductor YSZ into titanate-based electrolysis cell cathodes are summarised in Table 2. 20 vol.% YSZ was chosen since further addition to give 30, 40 and 50 vol.% YSZ led to raised Rp in the case of La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ/YSZ composite cathodes (results not shown). The greatest improvement in Rp with the blending of YSZ into titanate-based cathodes was observed for the SrTiO3-based electrolysis cell, which demonstrated a Δ(Rp) value of −18%. In comparison, a more subdued improvement in Rp was observed for La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 (Δ(Rp) = −8%), while no change was observed in Rp for La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ. Considering that the presence of YSZ would be expected to facilitate the movement of oxide ions through the electrolysis cell cathode and therefore lower Rp, the absence of much improvement for the La-doped materials indirectly suggested that La-doping raised oxide ion mobility in such a way as to make the introduction of a dedicated ionic conductor largely redundant. Oxygen-excess La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ in particular appeared to demonstrate mixed-ionic–electronic-conductivity (MIEC) with sufficient oxide ion mobility itself without the need for adding a separate ionic conductor. Comparing (La,Sr)TiO3 defect chemistries, oxygen-excess appeared to yield slightly higher oxide ion mobility compared to A-site deficiency, although an independent measure of oxide ion mobility beyond the scope of this study would be necessary to confirm this.
The blending of the oxide ion conductor YSZ into electrolysis cell cathodes was also observed to raise relaxation frequencies (Table 2). The characteristic relaxation frequencies for electrolysis cells based on La-doped titanates were observed to increase by a factor of ∼2×, while that for SrTiO3 increased considerably more and by a factor of ∼4×. This is further indirect proof that La-doping and the resultant formation of lattice defects led to improved oxide ion mobility. In addition, the increase in relaxation frequencies with the blending of YSZ into electrolysis cell cathodes suggested that the movement of oxide ions was a limiting process.

          Hydrogen partial pressure- and steam partial pressure-dependency of high temperature steam electrolysis properties
Experiments considering the influence of product (H2) and reactant (H2O) partial pressures on HTSE properties of titanate-based electrolysis cells were carried out with a view to observing effects of La-doping and defect chemistry in addition to those discussed above. Fig. 10 summarises the pH2- and pH2O-dependency of Rs and Rp values obtained from EIS analysis of electrolysis cells under −1.5 V bias at 900 °C. Only modest variations in pH2 (5.3 × 10−3–5.3 × 10−2) and pH2O (0.29–0.65) were possible due to limitations of the testing equipment, however these were sufficient to observe the influence on steam electrolysis properties. The observed effects were only due to the cathode inlet gas composition since the hydrogen production rate at −1.5 V bias, calculated using Faraday's Law and assuming 100% current efficiency,3 was over a relatively narrow band (∼0.5–0.8 mL min−1) for all experiments.
 Fig. 10  Results of hydrogen partial pressure (pH2)- and steam partial pressure (pH2O)-dependency measurements. Series resistance (Rs) and polarisation resistance (Rp) were obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of electrolysis cells based on (■) La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ, (♦) La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and (▲) SrTiO3 cathodes under −1.5 V bias at 900 °C. (a,b) pH2O at cathode inlet = 0.47. (c,d) pH2 at cathode inlet = 0. Straight lines indicate general trends. 
Rs values were observed to decrease with pH2 for all compositions (Fig. 10a), and may be explained by enhanced electronic conductivity of the n-type titanates as the electrolysis cell cathode inlet gas became more reducing. A most significant observation was that the Rs of electrolysis cells based on La-doped titanates was impressively independent of pH2O, while in contrast Rs increased with pH2O for the SrTiO3-based electrolysis cell (Fig. 10c). That is, La-doping of the parent SrTiO3 perovskite allowed for the maintenance of electronic conductivity, even as the electrolysis cell cathode inlet gas composition became more oxidising (pO2 rising from 1.0 × 10−6 to 1.7 × 10−6) with the increase in pH2O. This property of electrolysis cells based on (La,Sr)TiO3 cathodes is particularly desirable for the high pH2O environment encountered during HTSE.
Increasing pH2 and pH2O led in both cases to decreases in Rp for all electrolysis cells. Similar decreases in Rp have been observed previously in literature considering Ni pattern anodes on YSZ substrates.35–37 The decrease in Rp with increasing pH2 (Fig. 10b) was counter-intuitive since it would have been expected that increasing the concentration of the hydrogen product would rather have retarded the steam electrolysis and raised Rp. Bessler et al.37 explained this by considering the simple one step electrode reaction, Red ↔ Ox + e−, for which the exchange current density is proportional to the concentration of both reactant and product species, so that increasing both reactant and product concentrations will increase reaction kinetics. The decrease in Rp with increasing pH2O for all compositions (Fig. 10d) was additionally due to a right shift in the equilibrium H2O(g) ↔ H2O(ads) following Le Chatelier's principle, favouring the adsorption of reactant water molecules onto the electrolysis cell cathode surface and therefore lowering Rp.
Conclusions
Electrolysis cells based on (La,Sr)TiO3 perovskite cathodes were observed to behave similarly in the presence or absence of hydrogen in the cathode inlet and showed stable performance with mild redox cycling, which constitutes a possible advantage over the state-of-the-art Ni/YSZ cermet cathode. The best steam electrolysis performance in terms of highest (absolute) electrolysis current density and lowest Rp was observed for oxygen-excess La0.3Sr0.7TiO3+δ, followed by A-site deficient La0.2Sr0.7TiO3 and SrTiO3. The difference in steam electrolysis performance between oxygen-excess and A-site deficient titanates was attributed largely to surface area effects, while the better performance of La-doped perovskites compared to SrTiO3 was attributed to higher electronic conductivity and oxide ion mobility. Characteristic relaxation frequencies depended strongly on defect chemistry. Improved oxide ion mobility with La-doping was indirectly shown by considering the effects of blending the ionic conductor YSZ within titanate-based cathodes. Finally, pH2O-dependency measurements revealed that Rs was independent of pH2O for La-doped titanates, in contrast to undoped SrTiO3 for which Rs increased with pH2O, thereby revealing an added advantage of La-doping.
