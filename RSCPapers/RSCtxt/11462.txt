    , Accepted 24th March 2023First published on 26th March 2023AbstractThe device performance, including efficiency and stability, of polymer solar cells (PSCs) is mainly correlated with the bulk microstructure of specific active layer systems. Generally, developing a single-component (SC) active layer is an effective approach to solving the inherent shortcomings of bulk heterojunctions (BHJs). Herein, we designed and synthesized a conjugated-block copolymer (CBC) PBDB-YTCl-2 and further compared the photovoltaic performance of the CBC PBDB-YTCl-2 and BHJ PBDB-T:PYCl-2 systems. Although both PSC systems show high device efficiencies of over 13%, the contributions of relevant photovoltaic parameters are quite different. We systematically evaluated multiple target parameters, including morphological characteristics, physical kinetics, and active layer stability issues, and compared the correlations and differences between the photovoltaic systems, blend morphology, and device performance of the corresponding CBC and BHJ systems. Our work demonstrates that CBC materials are promising active layer systems, which are conducive to the reduced efficiency-stability gap of PSCs in comparison to the corresponding BHJ all-polymer systems.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have received tremendous attention owing to their outstanding merits of light weight, vivid colors, affluent raw materials, and easy manufacturing in a large area—all being hallmarks of promising low environmental-impact photovoltaic technologies.1–6 Recently, significant progress has been achieved for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs based on conjugated polymer donor (PD)/non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) blend systems and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 19% have been achieved.7–10 Processing a kinetically mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) into thin-film BHJ composites typically leads to nonequilibrium microstructures and phase evolutions.11–13 A thermodynamically unstable BHJ usually results in microstructure-related performance losses due to internal factors (e.g. molecular miscibility and intermolecular interaction) and external conditions (e.g. illumination and temperature).3,13,14 In particular, polymer acceptor (PA) material-based PSCs (namely, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs)) have also stimulated great attention, due to their advantages of good film-forming properties, morphological stability, and mechanical flexibility.15–18 Despite its unique merits, the poor dimensional blend microstructure (e.g. large-scale de-mixing of polymer domains, misaligned molecular orientation at D/A interfaces, nonuniform internal biphasic composition of the BHJ blends, etc.),15,16,19 caused by the properties of polymer materials and the variation in external environmental conditions during film formation and device operation, makes the development and application of all-PSCs restricted.17,18
Recently, developing single-component (SC) materials, which exhibit both D/A characteristics, had been considered to be an effective strategy to solve the inherent shortcomings of conventionally blended BHJ composites,20–23 especially in terms of improving the thermal stability of active layers and simplifying device fabrication.20,22,24 For instance, Brabec et al. found that double-cable polymer-based single-component PSCs (SCPSCs) are much stable even under harsh conditions, such as baking at 160 °C.24 Additionally, in our previous study, we demonstrated that the storage and light-soaking stabilities of SCPSCs based on a conjugated-block copolymer (CBC, PBDB-T-b-PYT) containing PBDB-T and PYT blocks are better than those of the referenced PBDB-T:PYT BHJ all-PSCs.20 During the last few years, single-component systems have witnessed great improvement with the champion PCE jumping from the previous 2–3% to currently over 14% for the representative material classes.20,25 In particular, in-chain (or block co-) polymers (or CBCs) are promising candidates for SC systems, as they have recently achieved a performance breakthrough with a PCE of 14.88%, which was enhanced to 15.55% with the addition of Y6.25 These results are impressive but still lower than those based on the related BHJ active layer of binary composites.7–10 Thus, to further improve device performance, the synthesis of CBC materials and the adjustment of the nanophase morphology are needed.
Note that improved material architectures and modified film morphologies with high exciton dissociation probability in parallel to balanced transport properties as well as suppressed charge recombination generally are required to enhance the performance of SCPSCs.20,26–28 However, it is generally accepted that the device performance of SCPSCs is significantly limited by geminate and non-geminate charge recombination caused by the lack of well-ordered and extended pristine phases.26,28–30 Moreover, several factors, including the possible formation of free volumes from the entwined block copolymer backbones, the possible noncovalent interactions between donor and acceptor blocks between adjacent block copolymers, the uncertain conjugated length of the intermediate donor and acceptor block, etc., will impede the charge carrier transport between polymer chains, which inevitably undermines the device performance of the resulting SCPSCs.20,31–33 With the emphasis on high-efficiency single-component CBC materials, which show encouraging recent progress,20,34,35 the underlying scientific principles behind the CBC systems remain to be clarified.
An in-depth understanding of the fundamental physical processes in SCPSC materials and the specific relationships between physical dynamic processes and morphological characteristics can help to accelerate further performance improvement. Based on this point, herein we aim not only to solve the above-mentioned problems presented in CBC-based PSCs through material design but also to investigate in sufficient detail the differences in the bulk microstructure and physical mechanisms between BHJ- and CBC-based PSCs. Thus, we utilized a one-pot synthetic approach to design and synthesize a CBC PBDB-YTCl-2, which possessed both D-block PBDB-T and A-block PYCl-2. PA PYCl-2 (Scheme S1†), composed of an A-DA′D-A constructed fused-ring acceptor as the key building block and thiophene as the linking unit, was synthesized to construct the control PBDB-T:PYCl-2 all-polymer system. In these building blocks, asymmetric end groups were involved, as an asymmetric structure may additionally exhibit stronger intermolecular binding energy and larger dipole moment than symmetric counterparts. And we further investigated the performance differences between CBC PBDB-YTCl-2 and BHJ PBDB-T:PYCl-2 systems. Considering the obvious differences in the micro/nanostructure between BHJ and CBC systems, we applied optical, electro-optical and electronic spectroscopy approaches to elucidate the interplay between microstructure and fundamental photo-physical processes. Subsequently, we analyzed the correlation between microstructure formation and relevant stability issues and summarized the corresponding characterization results using a radar chart. Within this systematical analysis, we show a quantitative relationship between the material structure, film morphology, physical dynamics, photovoltaic parameters, and stability issues, highlighting the advantages of CBC materials.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Material properties and device characteristics

Fig. 1A shows the molecular structures of PD PBDB-T and PA PYCl-2 for BHJ all-PSCs, and CBC PBDB-YTCl-2 for SCOSCs. Their detailed synthetic procedures (Scheme S1†) and characterizations can be found in the experimental section in the ESI.† YC20-Cl-2 (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) was copolymerized with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene, generating a novel Y-series polymer acceptor, PYCl-2. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the synthesized PA PYCl-2 was measured to be 18.2 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.03, measured by gel permeation chromatography with dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 145 °C (Fig. S2 and Table S1 in the ESI†). Moreover, CBC PBDB-YTCl-2 was facilely synthesized using a one-pot synthesis approach via a Stille coupling polycondensation.20,34 The Mw of PBDB-YTCl-2 was determined to be 59.8 kDa with a PDI of 2.45 (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The molar ratios of the PBDB-T and PYCl-2 repeating units were determined to be around 1:0.82 in PBDB-YTCl-2, determined by elemental analyses using the content of nitrogen, which exists only in monomer A2 (Table S2 in the ESI†). Both PYCl-2 and PBDB-YTCl-2 were readily soluble in common solvents such as chlorobenzene, o-xylene, and chloroform at room temperature.

(D) Device structure used in this work. (E) J–V curves for the optimal BHJ and SC OSCs. (F) EQE curves of the corresponding devices. 
The ultraviolet-visible near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectra of PBDB-T, PYCl-2, and PBDB-YTCl-2 in chloroform solutions and thin films are exhibited in Fig. S4† and 1B, respectively, and the corresponding optical parameters are summarized in Table S1.† In CF solution, CBC PBDB-YTCl-2 exhibits three obvious absorption peaks at 352, 614, and 759 nm, indicating the similar absorption features of PBDB-T and PYCl-2. In the thin-film state (Fig. 1B), both PYCl-2 and PBDB-YTCl-2 show bathochromic absorption relative to their solution state, exhibiting absorption peaks at 816 and 807 nm, respectively. Additionally, both PBDB-T:PYCl-2 BHJ and PBDB-YTCl-2 CBC films show a wide complementary absorption within the 300–900 nm range. The well-defined peaks of PBDB-T and PYCl-2 segments in the PBDB-YTCl-2 film indicate that both D and A blocks have a certain length. Notably, the PBDB-YTCl-2 film exhibits slightly blue-shifted absorption, which is probably due to its shorter A-block length in comparison to PYCl-2.20 Consequently, the optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of the BHJ and SC films were estimated to be 1.38 eV and 1.39 eV, respectively. Moreover, cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed on the corresponding thin films to investigate the electrochemical properties (Fig. S5 and Table S1 in the ESI†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels were determined to be −3.86/−5.71 eV for PYCl-2 and −3.65/−5.53 eV for PBDB-YTCl-2, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 1C, the relative energy levels of PBDB-YTCl-2 were observed between PBDB-T and PYCl-2.
We fabricated solar cells based on the typical device configuration consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active Layer/F3N/Ag (Fig. 1D, see the ESI† for the details of the fabrication process). Fig. 1E shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ device and one-pot-polymerized SC device under simulated AM 1.5G illumination, with the relevant photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 1. Note that the BHJ system exhibits optimal device efficiency with a weight ratio of 1:1 (Fig. S6 and Table S3 in the ESI†). The optimized PBDB-T:PYCl-2 all-PSCs show a PCE of 13.09% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.795 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 24.23 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 68.0%. In comparison with the control BHJ system, CBC PBDB-YTCl-2 exhibits a slightly higher PCE of 13.73% due to the improved VOC (from 0.795 V to 0.872 V) and FF (from 68.0% to 70.5%) values, even though a lowered JSC of 22.35 mA cm−2 was found in the CBC-based devices. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimal devices are shown in Fig. 1F, the integrated JSC of which is shown in Table 1 (23.64 and 21.63 mA cm−2 for the BHJ and SC devices, respectively). The errors between the integrated JSC and measured JSC are within approximately 3%. Although both all-polymer and single-component systems show PCEs of over 13%, the contributions of VOC, JSC, and FF are quite different. Thus, we further focus on analyzing the phenomenon in terms of microscopic morphology, physical mechanism, and energy disorder as discussed below.

2.2 Morphological characteristics
To understand the detailed film morphologies that lead to the different photovoltaic parameters for the BHJ and SC devices, we first analyzed the molecular packing and crystalline texture by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The GIWAXS patterns of the corresponding pristine and blend films are shown in Fig. 2A and B, and S7 in the ESI,† and the corresponding 1D intensity profiles are shown in Fig. 2C. The relevant crystallographic parameters of these films including the stacking distance (d = 2π/q) and crystal coherence length (LC = 2πk/Δq, where k is a shape factor (0.9 in this study) and Δq is the full width at half-maximum of a diffraction peak) are summarized in Table S4†.36,37 For the pristine PBDB-T film (Fig. S7A†), the polymer backbone prefers a face-on orientation, supported by the prominent (010) peak at qz = 1.666 Å−1 (d = 3.77 Å) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and the lamellar (100) peak at qr = 0.296 Å−1 (d = 21.22 Å) in the in-plane (IP) direction, consistent with a previous report.38 PYCl-2 also shows a strong (010) peak in the OOP direction (Fig. S7B†), which is located at qz = 1.63 Å−1 (d = 3.84 Å) with LC = 17.60 Å. Both BHJ and SC films exhibit strong (010) peaks in the OOP direction, similar to the overlapping spectra of the neat films. The BHJ film with more ordered π–π stacking and a larger (010) coherence length (qz = 1.695 Å−1, d = 3.71 Å, and LC = 19.29 Å) exhibits higher domain purity as compared with the SC film (qz = 1.637 Å−1, d = 3.84 Å, and LC = 18.23 Å), which favors charge transport and yield higher device JSC.39,40

Additionally, the nanoscale phase structure has been probed by grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements (Fig. S8†). The 1D scattering intensity profiles of the BHJ and SC films are demonstrated in Fig. 2D with relevant parameters summarized in Table S5.† The result shows that the domain size of the BHJ and SC films is 30 nm and 34 nm, respectively, which are larger than the exciton diffusion length of OSCs (∼10 nm).41 Limited by the short exciton diffusion length, some excitons may decay to the ground state before reaching the D/A interface. Therefore, the smaller domain size of the BHJ film is conducive to exciton dissociation and JSC enhancement. Taking the GIWAXS and GISAXS results together (Fig. 2E), it can be found that the BHJ blend exhibits smaller domains with enhanced crystallinity in comparison to the SC film, which is more favorable for exciton dissociation and charge transfer. In contrast, the SC film exhibits large-scale domains with inferior domain purity, which could limit the exciton diffusion. Based on the investigations of BHJ and SC morphologies, the detailed correlations between physical mechanisms and photovoltaic parameters are discussed below.
2.3 Analysis of the difference in JSC
To specifically address the working principles behind the higher JSC of the BHJ devices in comparison to the SC devices, we performed femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy. The TA spectrum at indicated delay times of the pristine PBDB-T and PYCl-2 films is shown in Fig. S9,† and the TA spectrum of the BHJ and SC films is exhibited in Fig. 3A and B, respectively. The pristine PBDB-T film excited at 450 nm shows negative signals in the visible region with a peak at 635 nm corresponding to the photo-bleaching (PB) of PBDB-T. Meanwhile in the NIR region, broad and positive signals were observed with two peaks centered at 950 nm and 1125 nm attributed to the photoinduced absorption (PIA) of hole polarons and excitons, respectively. The assignment of the PB and PIA signals of PBDB-T is consistent with a previous study.42 As for the pristine PYCl-2 film excited at 800 nm (Fig. S9†), it shows the PIA of singlet excitons around 830–950 nm with a peak at 880 nm. Additionally, both BHJ and SC films were excited at 800 nm to detect the relative hole-transfer dynamics. To avoid the complicated influences of thermal or electro-absorption (EA)43 effect contributions to the response, we analyzed the spectra in the >800 nm region where only the PB and PIA features are present.

(C) Kinetic traces at 805 nm after excitation of the pristine PYCl-2, BHJ, and SC films, with the multi-exponential fits to the data. (D) Kinetic traces at 972 nm after excitation of the BHJ and SC films, with the exponential, fit to the data. (E) PL spectra of the pristine PYCl-2, BHJ, and SC films (excited at 639 nm). The quenching efficiency is calculated by using the equation (Φq = (I0 − I)/I0), where I0 is the PL intensity of the neat film, and I is the PL intensity of the BHJ and SC films. (F) Jph–Veff characteristics of the corresponding devices. (G) Parameters extracted from different physical measurements. 
Since both the exciton diffusion efficiency (NED) and exciton dissociation efficiency (NCD) have important effects on JSC, we analyzed the JSC difference between the BHJ and SC devices in these two processes.44NED in both films was calculated by using NED = kq/(kq + kp),(1)where kq is the dissociation rate of singlet excitons in the BHJ and SC films, kp is the deactivation rate of singlet excitons in the pristine PYCl-2 film.45 For the pristine PYCl-2 film, the kinetics of PB at 805 nm caused by singlet exciton relaxion to the ground state can be fitted with45 ΔOD(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2).(2)Thus the lifetime of PYCl-2 singlet excitons (τp) equals τp = (A1τ1 + A2τ2)/(A1 + A2),(3)and then kp can be calculated by using44 kp = 1/τp.(4)
While for the BHJ and SC films, excitons photogenerated in the acceptor domain can diffuse to the D/A interface and dissociate, resulting in the formation of a charge-transfer (CT) state. The bound polaron pairs at the CT state decay back to the ground state through geminate recombination, leading to the recovery of the PB at 805 nm. Considering one more decay pathway, a third term (A3 and τ3) was added ΔOD(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + A3exp(−t/τ3).(5)Since only the first two terms in eqn (5) were related to exciton decay kinetics, the τq and kq in the BHJ and SC films were calculated in the same way as eqn (3) and (4). The raw data and fitted curves for the corresponding films are shown in Fig. 3C with the results listed in Table S6† Compared with the pristine PYCl-2 film, when blended with PBDB-T, the lifetime of singlet excitons is reduced from 24.80 ps to 4.27 ps due to an additional decay process (exciton to polaron), with an NED of 82.8%. Compared with the BHJ film, the SC film shows a smaller NED of 79.0% which may be attributed to the larger domain size, supported by the above-mentioned morphological characterization.
To study the exciton dissociation dynamics in the BHJ and SC films, we quantitatively analyzed the decay dynamics of polarons at 972 nm (excluding the impact of singlet excitons) on a time scale of nanoseconds. As shown in Fig. 3D, the transient absorption decay of the PBDB-T polaron was fitted with ΔOD(t) = ADexp(−t/τD) + B,(6)with the results listed in Table S7.†45 For the BHJ and SC films, the τD of polarons (BHJ = ∼1261 ps and SC = ∼593 ps) is close to the τ3 (longest decay time constant) of PB (BHJ = ∼1238 ps and SC = ∼609 ps). The consistency of τD and τ3 verifies the decay process of the PYCl-2 polaron to the ground state. According to the function of NCD = B/(AD + B),(7)the NCD for the BHJ film is 65.7%, which is almost the same as that of the SC film (65.8%). Thus, the BHJ device exhibits higher JSC, which is mainly due to the contribution of higher NED in comparison to the SC device.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were further employed to detect exciton dissociation and charge generation at the D/A interface of thin films. As shown in Fig. 3E, the PL quenching efficiency of the BHJ film is 91.72%, which is higher than that of the SC film (87.28%). The higher PL quenching of the BHJ film indicates that more excitons are available for charge generation which is consistent with the above-mentioned morphology and TA analysis. Moreover, the detailed photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves were recorded to investigate the charge dissociation probability (PE,T, PE,T = Jph/Jsat, where Jsat is the saturation current density) of the entire device, as shown in Fig. 3F.46 The PE,T value of the BHJ device is 97.6%, which is not much different from that of the SC device (97.3%, Fig. 3G), indicating that the BHJ and SC devices exhibited similar behavior in the exciton dissociation process. Overall, the higher JSC of the BHJ system, as compared to the SC PBDB-YCl-2, can be attributed to the more efficient exciton diffusion and charge generation.
2.4 Analysis of the difference in FF
As an important parameter to characterize solar cells, FF is determined by the competition between charge recombination and extraction, which is affected by the charge carrier mobilities, recombination rate, light intensity, etc.47 To investigate the effects of the BHJ and SC morphologies on FF in relevant devices as well as their charge transport properties, we performed space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements on representative BHJ and SC hole-only devices and electron-only devices, as presented in Fig. S10 and S11 in the ESI,† respectively. The average hole-only mobility (μh) and electron-only mobility (μe) of the BHJ devices were calculated to be 2.65 × 10−4 and 3.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are slightly lower than those of the SC devices (μh = 3.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 4.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, Fig. 4A, and Table S8†). As compared to the BHJ system with a μh/μe ratio of 0.68, more balanced charge transport properties can be also found in the SC system with a μh/μe ratio of 0.85. These results illustrate the difference in FF (68.0% for the BHJ and 70.5% for the SC, respectively), which can be also demonstrated by the photoinduced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurements over the nanosecond-microsecond (ns-μs) time regime. Fig. S12† exhibits the photocurrent transients recorded by applying a 2 V/40 μs linearly increasing reverse bias pulse to the BHJ and SC real devices at different delay times ranging from 0.1 μs to 100 μs. The average mobility of the SC device is calculated to be 1.07 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than that (8.03 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) of the BHJ device. Overall, the superior charge carrier mobilities of the SC devices are beneficial for higher FF achievements in comparison to the BHJ device.

(B) Charge carrier densities in the BHJ and SC devices as a function of delay time obtained from photo-CELIV, with the fits to the data. (C) The FF versus θ for the experimental (color symbols) and simulation data (gray symbols) from a previous report.47 
In particular, the photo-CELIV technique also tends to measure the charge carrier decay dynamics, from which the bimolecular recombination coefficient γ48,49 can be determined by using n(t) = n0/(1 + n0γt).(8)
After fitting the corresponding curves as shown in Fig. 4B, the BHJ device shows a γ of 1.89 × 10−11 cm3 s−1, which is higher than that (6.81 × 10−12 cm3 s−1) of the SC device. The larger γ of the BHJ device indicated increased recombination strength, resulting in an inferior FF. Moreover, Bartesaghi et al. introduced a dimensionless parameter θ, which unifies the effects of the factors mentioned above.47 The θ can be defined as θ = γGL4/μeμhV4int ∝ krec/kext,(9)where γ is the bimolecular recombination coefficient, G is the generation rate of carriers, L is the active layer thickness, μe and μh are the mobilities of electrons and holes, Vint is the internal voltage, krec is the charge recombination rate, and kext is the charge extraction rate. Here, G is calculated from JSC by using G = JSC/qL.(10)And Vint is approximated by VOC at 1 sun intensity.47,50 The calculated θ for the BHJ and SC devices is 0.044 and 0.008, respectively, based on the physical parameters (Table S9†) and the abovementioned equation. As presented in Fig. 4C, the experiments agree with the reported simulation data. The smaller θ of the SC device led to a higher FF of 70.5%. In addition, another dimensionless parameter α51 can also be calculated from θ by using the equation of α2 = (qVint/2kBT)2θ.(11)
Limited by the low carrier mobility (∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) in OSCs, the α values obtained according to eqn (11) for both the BHJ and SC are larger than 1, and are 3.22 and 1.52, respectively. Moreover, both α and θ are related to the carrier transport lengths. The diffusion length (ldif) for the photogenerated charge carriers under the VOC conditions can be calculated by using (12)And the drift length (ldr) under the JSC conditions can be calculated by using θ = (L/ldr)2.(13)
The carrier transport lengths of the BHJ and SC devices calculated by using eqn (12) and (13) are summarized in Table S9.† The result shows that the SC device exhibits a longer carrier transport length, which is more beneficial for charge extraction.
2.5 Analysis of the difference in VOC
There is a significant difference in the VOC of the BHJ (0.795 V) and SC (0.872 V) devices as listed in Table 1, and thus energy loss analysis is required. Based on the reciprocity relationship between photovoltaic quantum efficiency and electroluminescent emission (EQEEL) proposed by Rau et al.,52VOC can be expressed as (14)where ECT is the energy of the charge-transfer state (CT), λ is the reorganization energy, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and f is a parameter describing the electronic coupling between the ground state (GS) and CT state, and h is Planck's constant. The last two terms illustrate the radiative (ΔVrad) and non-radiative (ΔVnon-rad) VOC losses, respectively.53 The ECT and λ of the corresponding devices were obtained by fitting the Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra (Fig. S13, see the ESI† for the details of the fitting process).54 The best fit ECT/λ values were 1.405/0.171 eV for the BHJ device and 1.417/0.149 eV for the SC device, respectively. The ECT of both the BHJ and SC devices did not exceed the corresponding photovoltaic bandgap (Egpv, Fig. S14 in the ESI†) and was 1.422 and 1.436 eV, respectively, further confirming the reliability of the fitting process.
After processing the FTPS-EQE and EL data we conclude that the SC device shows a slightly smaller ΔVrad of 0.282 V as compared with the BHJ device with a ΔVrad of 0.293 V. As shown in Fig. 5A, the SC device exhibits a higher EQEEL emission efficiency of 4.29 × 10−5 as compared with the BHJ device (6.21 × 10−6), thus yielding a smaller ΔVnon-rad of 0.260 V. The calculated VOC,cal (BHJ = 0.802 V and SC = 0.875 V) was closed to the experimental VOC,exp (BHJ = 0.795 V and SC = 0.872 V) extracted from the J–V curves. Compared with the BHJ device, the SC device exhibits lower ΔVrad and ΔVnon-rad values, as presented in Table S10.† Moreover, originating from skeletal chemical bonding, λ shows an important effect on radiative and nonradiative recombination.55 As compared with the BHJ device, the SC device shows a smaller λ of 0.149 eV, which may be responsible for helping mitigate charge recombination loss. Besides, we investigated the trap density of states (tDOS) of the corresponding BHJ and SC devices, as exhibited in Fig. 5B. The SC device also showed a lower tDOS with the lowest value of 4.47 × 1015 cm−3 eV−1 in comparison to the BHJ device (5.27 × 1015 cm−3 eV−1). For further confirmation of the energy loss caused by the trap-assisted recombination, light-intensity-dependent J–V analysis was conducted. As shown in Fig. S15,† the BHJ device exhibited severe non-geminate recombination, which provides support for the larger energy loss and lower VOC. Therefore, as depicted in Fig. 5C, the reduced radiative and nonradiative energy loss of the SC device may be attributed to the smaller λ and lower trap density which contributes to the higher VOC.56

2.6 Correlations between the morphology, physical kinetics, and device performance
Based on all the above-mentioned investigations, two simplified pictures of the BHJ and SC active layers for their descriptions of morphology characteristics are provided in Fig. 6A and B, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 6A, the BHJ film shows more ordered π–π stacking and a larger (010) coherence length with a smaller domain size as a consequence. Although the BHJ active layer exhibits high domain purity, it also possesses considerable trap density. This leads to high exciton diffusion and exciton dissociation efficiencies but at the cost of considerable non-geminate recombination loss and inferior charge transport and charge extraction properties. As a direct result, VOC and FF values are dramatically impacted by such an intermixed microstructure, leading to inferior device efficiency, even with a higher JSC value in comparison to the SC device. In contrast, the SC active layer exhibits a larger domain size with a poor domain purity, which is also favorable for exciton dissociation, but not for exciton diffusion (Fig. 6B), thus leading to an inferior JSC value. Further investigations found that the SC devices with enhanced phase separation showed superior charge transport and carrier extraction properties and less radiative and nonradiative recombination losses and lower trap density as compared to the BHJ device, which agrees with the higher VOC and FF values of the SC devices. In particular, the results of the abovementioned carrier dynamic analysis coupled with the exciton diffusion and dissociation analysis fully complement the depictions of the morphology characterization and strongly give detailed insight into subtle mechanisms being responsible for the observed difference in the device efficiency (13.73% for the SC and 13.09% for the BHJ, respectively).

(C) Storage stability and light-soaking stability of the BHJ and SC devices measured in a nitrogen glovebox at room temperature. (D) Thermal stability of the corresponding devices and films in a nitrogen-filled glovebox at 85 °C. (E) Radar chart visualization of the multivariate data analysis of the BHJ and SC OSCs. Data have five variables: Norm. PCE, storage stability (device), light stability (device), and thermostability (device and film). The range of coordinates from the center to the outside of each axis in the radar chart is 0 to 1. 
In addition to the investigations of the correlations between the film morphology and device efficiency, the stability issues of the corresponding BHJ and SC systems were also explored. We first investigated the storage stability and light-soaking stability of the BHJ and SC devices. Both the BHJ and SC devices exhibited good storage stability in a nitrogen glovebox at room temperature, as shown in Fig. S15.† After 240 hours of storage in the dark, the BHJ and SC devices maintained 91.6% and 93.6% of their initial PCEs, respectively (Fig. 6C). In addition, the SC device maintained 73.2% of its initial PCEs after continuous illumination for 240 hours, whereas the BHJ devices retained 63.1% of the initial PCEs (Fig. 6C). Compared with the SC devices, the BHJ device shows poorer light soaking stability dominated by severer FF loss (Fig. S16†), which may be attributed to the formation of locally isolated aggregates in the mixed region due to materials incompatibility.50
Additionally, we explored the thermal stability of the BHJ and SC systems in a nitrogen-filled glovebox at 85 °C. As shown in Fig. 6D, the SC device maintained a higher normalized PCE (retaining 66.7% of its initial PCE) in relation to the BHJ device, which retained 54.0% of the initial PCEs, after annealing for 240 hours. As exhibited in Fig. S17,† FF (FF decreased to 74.8% and 81.2% of the initial values for the BHJ and SC devices, respectively) and VOC (VOC decreased to 73.3% and 83.8% of the initial values for the BHJ and SC devices, respectively) were the main losses of PCE degradation, while JSC remained almost unchanged. The faster decays of VOC and FF in the BHJ devices may be caused by the formation of more local trap states and the inferior interface morphologies between the active layer and interfacial layers. To avoid the influence of interface layers on thermal stability, we also determined the thermal stability of the BHJ and SC active layers. It can be found that the BHJ and SC active layers retained 78.1% and 82.7% of their initial PCEs, respectively, mainly resulting from the degradation behaviors of VOC and FF (Fig. S18 in the ESI†). This result further explains a broadening of the density of states at the D/A interfaces in the BHJ film annealed at 85 °C for 240 hours. Based on the abovementioned investigations of comprehensive device performance (including PCE and stability), we can summarize the related data using a radar chart (Fig. 6E)—a straightforward approach for comparing the merits of various photovoltaic systems. Clearly, the SC system investigated in this work possesses superior photovoltaic performance in comparison to the investigated BHJ all-polymer system.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we designed and synthesized a conjugated block copolymer PBDB-YTCl-2, which shows a high PCE of 13.73% in single-component PSCs. Although this value is slightly higher than that (13.09%) of the PBDB-T:PYCl-2 BHJ device, the contributions of the three parameters (JSC, VOC, and FF) to PCE are quite different. To explain the trade-offs of relevant photovoltaic parameters and understand the physical phenomena governing JSC (24.23 mA cm−2 for the SC and 22.35 mA cm−2 for the BHJ), VOC (0.872 V for the SC and 0.795 V for the BHJ) and FF (70.5% for the SC and 68.0% for the BHJ), we investigated the film morphologies and physical mechanisms of the BHJ an SC films in detail. Morphological analyses indicate that the BHJ blend film shows more ordered π–π stacking, enhanced crystallinity, and smaller domain size, which was favorable for exciton diffusion beneficial for achieving higher device JSC, but reduced VOC and FF values due to the severe bimolecular recombination at the D/A interface. In contrast, the SC device exhibits higher VOC and FF values because of the suppression of radiative and non-radiative recombination by the smaller λ and lower trap density, as indicated by CT state analysis and tDOS measurements. Moreover, we correlated the different morphological characteristics with the stability issues of relevant devices. After this comprehensive study, it can be found that the SC system possesses special advantages over the widely used BHJ system. Overall, our work demonstrates that conjugated-block copolymers are promising single-component active layer systems, which are conducive to the reduced efficiency-stability gap of PSCs in comparison to the corresponding BHJ all-polymer systems.
