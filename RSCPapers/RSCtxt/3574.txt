    , Accepted 6th June 2014First published on 10th June 2014AbstractIn this work, we demonstrate an extremely simple but highly effective strategy for the synthesis of various functional metal oxides (MOs) such as ZnO, In2O3, Bi2O3, and SnO2 nanoparticles with various distinct shapes at room temperature via a solid-state reaction method. The method involves only mixing and stirring of the corresponding metal salt and NaOH together in the solid phase, which yields highly crystalline metal oxides within 5–10 min of reaction time. The obtained paste can be directly doctor-bladed onto a variety of substrates for photoelectrochemical applications. The crystal structure and surface composition of the MOs are obtained by X-ray diffraction patterns, energy dispersive analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The surface morphology is confirmed from the scanning electron microscopy surface photo-images. The surface area and pore size distribution are studied by the N2 adsorption method. As a proof-of-concept demonstration for the application, ZnO nanoplate structures are envisaged in DSSCs as photoanodes, which enables us to obtain excellent photovoltaic properties with a power conversion efficiency of 5%. The proposed method does not require a sophisticated instrumental setup or harsh conditions, and the method is easily scalable. Hence, it can be applied for the cost-effective and large-scale production of MO nanoparticles with high crystallinity.
Introduction
Growth of MO nanoparticles has attracted much attention in recent years because of their applications in a variety of optoelectronic devices.1 Basically, MOs are ionic compounds that are made up of positive metallic and negative oxygen ions. The electrostatic interactions between the positive metallic and negative oxygen ions result in solid ionic bonds. Additionally, the s-shells of MOs are completely filled, so that most of them have excellent thermal and chemical stabilities.2,3 However, their d-shells perhaps are not completely filled, producing a variety of unique properties that make them potentially of great use in electronic devices. These unique properties include wide band gaps,4,5 high dielectric constants, reactive electronic transitions,6,7 and good electrical, optical,8,9 electrochromic characteristics,10,11 and superconductivity.12,13 Therefore, MOs are considered as the most fascinating functional materials and have been widely exploited in various technological applications.14–17 With the growing emphasis of the current science and technology on nanomaterials, and due to their unique and novel properties, considerable efforts are being made in the past decade to synthesize various metal oxides such as TiO2, ZnO, In2O3, Bi2O3, SnO2, SnO, etc. in the form of different phases and shapes using a variety of chemical and physical synthesis techniques. Such metal oxide nanostructures have demonstrated promising applications in various fields such as electrochromism, supercapacitors, field emission, LEDs, DSSCs, etc.18–24 Depending on the use of a particular process, the precursor, capping agent, complex agent, temperature, pressure, etc. are needed to be optimized. In the perspective of different applications such as photovoltaics, catalysis, electro-optics, etc., controlled synthesis of MO growth is well studied.25 However, different MOs show stability-dependent crystal growth, which make the proposition of developing a specific shaped morphology.26 Considering the potential of MOs, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) could grip the balance in the future energy production and take up a considerable market share in energy supply. To serve, MO nanostructured photoanodes constructed by facile, low-cost and scalable methods are highly desirable.27–30 There are several methods for the fabrication of MO nanostructures, such as thermal evaporation, dc-plasma reaction, chemical vapour deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, sputtering and solution-derived synthesis, and so on.31–35
Above mentioned methods, however, require particular experimental conditions, additives, and a complicated instrumental setup, making it difficult to scale up the production. The development of cost-effective and environment friendly methods, suitable for the large-scale synthesis of MO nano- and microstructures, is therefore of great demand. In the same line, we report here a solid-state synthesis route as an inexpensive, simple, and environmentally friendly approach for preparing MOs viz. ZnO, In2O3, Bi2O3 and SnO2. At room temperature, via a solid-state reaction between two commonly available low cost reactants – i.e., reacting NaOH with metal precursors such as Zn(NO3)2, InCl3, BiCl3 and SnCl4, nanoparticles of ZnO, In2O3, Bi2O3 and SnO2, respectively, could be synthesized rapidly within 5–10 min (Scheme 1 and Fig. 1). In addition, the as-formed materials exhibited high crystallinity without any thermal treatment.36–40 Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept demonstration for the application of such MOs nanostructures, we investigated the ZnO nanoplate-based photoanode from these four MOs for DSSC application, which showed excellent photovoltaic performances. To more thoroughly understand the properties of these ZnO nanoplate-based photoanodes and synthesis mechanisms, we systematically carried out structural, optical, and electrochemical measurements.

Experimental
Chemicals
All reagents used in the present work were of analytical grade, and used without further purification. Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%, Deaejung Chemicals, S. Korea), indium chloride (InCl3, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar), bismuth chloride (BiCl3, 98%, Alfa Aesar), tin chloride (SnCl4, 98%, Alfa Aesar) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97%, Kanto Chemicals, Japan) were used as received. Triply-distilled water was used throughout the experiment. N719 dye is obtained from Solaronix SA, Switzerland.
Synthesis
MO nanostructures were synthesized by using solid-state reaction between two commonly available and low cost reactants, i.e. Zn(NO3)2, InCl3, BiCl3, SnCl2 and NaOH. In a typical solid-state synthesis of MOs nanostructures, 10 g powder of each metal precursor and 5 g NaOH (2:1 w/w) were mixed together into a glass vial without adding any solvent, and the mixture was stirred using a magnetic stir bar for 5–10 min. After completion of the reaction, a thick slurry paste was obtained. The products were washed by dispersing them into water and separated using centrifugation. The washing step was repeated three times. Finally, without drying, the obtained MO nanostructures were dispersed again into 15 ml deionised water and 5 ml ethanol (3:1 v/v) to prepare a homogeneous paste for the fabrication of thin films using the doctor blade technique.
We choose the ZnO photoanode for further study because of its excellent properties as the anode in DSSCs.41–44
DSSC fabrication
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates used for doctor blading were first cleaned in detergent water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each using an ultrasonic bath. Then, these substrates were dried in a stream of argon and stored for further use. The doctor-blade technique was used to fabricate ZnO photoanodes without using any binder. After drying in air, the photoanode films were thermally treated at fixed 150 °C, 250 °C, 350 °C and 450 °C temperatures for 60 min, and then sensitized with 0.5 mM N719 prepared in absolute ethanol–acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) solution for 60 min.45
Characterization
The crystal structures and phases of metal oxides were confirmed using X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V, Cu-Kα, λ = 0.15418 nm). The chemical composition of the MOs is determined using an energy dispersive X-ray analyser (EDX, EM912) coupled to a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4200). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed using a JEOL-2100F transmission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The samples for TEM analysis were prepared by dropping about 20 μl of diluted solution of nanostructures in ethanol onto carbon-coated copper grids and slowly drying in air. The morphology of electrodes was monitored using the SEM (Hitachi S-4200). In order to measure the solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency, electrodes were incorporated into thin layer sandwich-type cells with a Pt coated FTO as the counter electrode using a spacer film (50 mm thick polyimide film). The cell performance was measured by irradiation of 100 mW cm2 white light (1 Sun, 1.5 AM) using a solar simulator (PEC-L01, Peccell). The current density was measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter by defining a definite area of 0.25 cm2 of the photoanode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra were obtained using an Ivium CompactStat impedance analyzer in the range of 0.01 Hz to 1.5 MHz. All spectra were recorded under open circuit conditions under 1 Sun illumination. The data were fitted using Z-view software. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded without bias under illumination with respect to a calibrated Melles-Friot silicon diode and measured by changing the excitation wavelength (photon counting spectrometer, ISS Inc. and Keithley 2400). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the MOs were calculated from N2 adsorption isotherms, obtained using an ASAP-2010 instrument (Micromeritics) at 77 K. The amount of dye loading was estimated colorimetrically by desorbing the adsorbed dye in 0.1 M NaOH solution made of an ethanol and water (1:1 ratio) mixture.
Results and discussion
Reactions leading to the formation of MOs by the reaction of metal salts and sodium hydroxide can be given as below;46 Zn(NO3)2 + 2NaOH → Zn(OH)2 + 2Na(NO3)(1) Zn(OH)2 → ZnO + H2O(2) InCl3 + 3NaOH → In(OH)3 + 3NaCl(3) 2In(OH)3 → 2In2O3+ 3H2O(4) BiCl3 + 3NaOH → Bi(OH)3 + 3NaCl(5) 2Bi(OH)3 → 2Bi2O3+ 3H2O(6) SnCl4 + 4NaOH → Sn(OH)4 + 4NaCl(7) Sn(OH)4 → SnO2 + 2H2O(8)Here, the water of crystallization and little moisture absorbed by the reactants might have enough to initialize ionization of a very small amount of the reaction precursors. When the ions from the reactants come into contact, the precipitation reaction takes place immediately with the evolution of heat. This heat assists further to fuse the reactants and proceed the reaction ahead. Thus, sodium hydroxide reacts first with the metal salt, yielding the corresponding metal hydroxide, which further decomposes to produce metal oxide nanostructures. After washing as described in the Experimental section, the reaction products were highly pure in the sense that the impurities were below the detectable range of the EDX and XPS analysis. SEM images and XRD patterns of the doctor bladed MO films are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. EDX spectra for In2O3, Bi2O3 and SnO2 are shown in ESI (Fig. S1†). Some higher oxygen content than the stoichiometric ratio can be observed, which could be due to the oxygen signals coming from the glass substrates that were used to deposit the doctor blade oxide films. However, the XRD patterns strongly support the formation of the MOs as revealed by the above reactions (1)–(8). The elegancy of this method lies in the fact that it forms highly crystalline metal oxide nanostructures at room temperature without any thermal treatment. In fact, the reactions of metal salts with NaOH are exothermic and this locally produced heat may be helping to crystallize the products. As a proof-of-concept demonstration for the application of MOs synthesized by the current method, ZnO nanostructures were investigated as photoanode materials in DSSCs, which is discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. Form the above reactions (1) and (2), ZnO in the form of a fine nanoplate like morphology was obtained, which can be confirmed from SEM images shown in Fig. 4a and b. Some of these nanoplates look like fused to each other. We believe that the fused nanoplates are favourable for charge collection and transportation due to their better connectivity. Fig. 4b shows a low magnified SEM image after annealing at 250 °C, which indicates highly porous and sponge like nature of the film. Traditionally, spongy and porous films, which are highly desirable for photoanodes, are generally fabricated using pore forming agents. After synthesis, the products are required to anneal at higher temperatures to remove the pore forming agents.47 In contrast, the current method inherently produces a ZnO porous structure composed of interconnected nanoplates, without using any external pore forming organic/inorganic agents at room temperature. This property is useful in DSSCs, where the porous structure with good interconnectivity is necessary for high dye loading and accelerated charge transport. From the TEM image shown in Fig. 4c, it can be seen that the ZnO nanocrystals with an average diameter of 50–60 nm are uniformly fused in a nanoplate shaped fashion. The SAED pattern shown in Fig. 4d indicates that the ZnO nanoplates are crystalline and a hexagonal wurtzite structure. This result is in line with the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 5a.48 The XRD pattern matches well with the JSPDS file no. 36-1451 with crystalline nature.49 The inset of Fig. 4c shows a high resolution TEM image of a single ZnO particle, which reveals a d spacing of 0.52 nm corresponding to the 0001 plane of ZnO. Further chemical composition of the nanoplates was investigated using XPS. Fig. 5b, c and d show the XPS survey spectrum, and Zn 2p and O 1s core level spectra, respectively. Peaks at 1022.45 and 1045.47 eV shown in Fig. 5c correspond to the doublet of Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, as has been reported previously for ZnO.50

The above ZnO nanostructures were employed as photoanodes in DSSCs using the doctor-blade method. For this, ZnO thin films were fabricated by doctor blading the ZnO paste on a FTO glass substrate. Initially, we prepared two cells – one was as-synthesized and another was thermally treated at 350 °C. The photoanode annealed at 350 °C exhibited an open circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼0.62 V, a current density (Jsc) of ∼11.42 mA cm−2, a fill factor (ff) of ∼0.64, and a power conversion efficiency (η) of ∼4.5%. Inspired from these results, we further treated the ZnO photoanode at various temperatures (150 °C, 250 °C, 350 °C and 450 °C), keeping all other conditions such as dye loading and annealing time constant, expecting a higher η. Fig. 6a shows the current–voltage (J–V) curves of the as-synthesized and the annealed photoanodes. It is clear from Fig. 6a and Table 1 that the photoanode annealed at 250 °C shows the maximum power conversion efficiency of 5%. Initially, as the annealing temperature increases, there is an increase in η up to 250 °C. After that, it decreases to 4.5% and finally to 4.1% for the 450 °C annealed sample. This can be explained on the basis of the fact that bulk defects and surface states that play an important role in charge transfer and recombination processes in DSSCs are strongly dependant on the annealing temperature. The as-synthesized and the annealed samples at lower temperature have high density of surface states, which in turn causes severe recombination of photogenerated electrons. Also, as there are plenty of grain boundaries existing in samples annealed at lower temperature, bulk trap states are higher, which pose severe recombination problems. It is clear from the cross-sectional SEM image shown in Fig. 7a that the ZnO photoanodes are spongy and highly porous in nature. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of the annealing temperature on the DSSC photoanode, we characterized the surface area and the pore-size distribution of the five porous ZnO films annealed at different temperatures. Porosity strongly determines important physical properties of materials such as durability, mechanical strength, permeability, adsorption properties, etc. Pores are classified according to three main groups depending on the access size. For example, pores smaller than 2 nm in diameter are called micropores, pores between 2 and 50 nm in diameter are called mesopores, and pores larger than 50 nm in diameter are called macrospores. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the as-synthesized and the photoanodes treated at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 7b (annealed at 250 °C) and Fig. S2a† (as-synthesized and treated at 150, 350 and 450 °C). Pore size distributions of these five photoanode films are shown in Fig. S2b.† Based on the above classification, the isotherms obtained for the ZnO photoanodes can be classified as type III, indicating that the pores in the photoanode are macroporous. There is a reduction in the surface area from 23.55 to 6.42 m2 g−1 when the annealing temperature was increased from 150 to 450 °C. Reduction in the surface area could be due to the increase in crystallinity after the annealing process. Porosities of the as-synthesized and the annealed ZnO electrodes are found to be ∼33.37%, ∼55.29% (150 °C), ∼64.29% (250 °C), ∼59.24% (350 °C) and ∼57.58% (450 °C). The pore volumes of these samples are also found to be in a more or less similar trend with the highest volume of 0.22 cm3 g−1 for the sample annealed at 250 °C. The porosity of the above ZnO products obtained after annealing increased initially and then decreased with the increase in annealing temperature. The initial increase in porosity may be due to the removal/evaporation of impurities present in the ZnO matrix, whereas, further decrease in porosity can be assigned to an increase in crystallite size, which might have covered available space/voids with an increase in annealing temperature. This merging and connectivity of small nanoplates at an elevated temperature is necessary for the electron transport in the porous film.51 The degree of dye loading is one of the key factors for better power conversion efficiency of a DSSC, which strongly depends on the porosity of photoanodes. Table 1 shows the amount of dye loading on ZnO photoanodes annealed at different temperatures.52–54 The dye loading amount for the photoanode annealed at 250 °C is 2.91 × 10−7 mol cm−2, which is slightly higher than in other photoanodes – for example; 2.33 × 10−7 mol cm−2, 2.72 × 10−7 mol cm−2, 2.86 × 10−7 mol cm−2, and 2.84 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for the as-synthesized and the samples annealed at 150 °C, 350 °C and 450 °C, respectively. Thus, these above data suggest that the photoanode (for instance the sample annealed at 250 °C) with high porosity (64.29%), large pore volume (0.22 cm3g−1), and high dye-loading amount (2.91 × 10−7 mol cm−2) exhibits better photovoltaic performance.

To investigate the charge transport in the photoelectrode and charge recombination at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out for all ZnO photoanodes under illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5). The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 6b. Fig. 6c shows the zoom view of Nyquist plots in the high frequency region. The charge transfer resistance estimated by fitting the experimental data is shown in Table 1. Generally, three typical frequency peaks are observed in EIS spectra of DSSCs. The ohmic series resistance Rs corresponds to the electrolyte and electronic contact in the device. The small semicircle at high frequency (>kHz) results from the charge transfer resistance at the Pt/electrolyte solution interface (Rct1). The large semicircle at low frequency (10–100 Hz) corresponds to the resistance at the ZnO photoanode-dye/electrolyte interface (Rct2). In addition, the semicircle at the lowest frequency range is related to the diffusion process of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (Rdiff). The fitted Rs, Rct1 and Rct2 values for the ZnO photoanode treated at different temperatures are shown in Table 1. In the impedance spectra of the ZnO photoanode, the values of Rct1 are nearly the same, being about 2.8–3.7 Ω in range, since the factors affecting this value are identical in all the fabricated devices (i.e. electrolytes and Pt counter electrodes). Rct2 is the main component determining the final energy conversion efficiency. It depends on the charge transport through the photoanode. It is clear from Table 1 that the Rct2 value varies greatly and is strongly dependant on the annealing temperature. This is obvious, since the crystallinity and interconnectivity play important roles in generation and transport of photogenerated electrons. The device with the highest efficiency shows the lowest value of Rct2, which means that the photogenerated electrons can easily flow through the photoanode with much less chances of recombination.51 Bode phase plots of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. S4.† According to the EIS model reported in the literature,55 the electron life time (τr) of the injected electrons in the ZnO photoanode can be calculated through the following expression (τr) = 1/2(πfmax), where fmax is the maximum frequency of the mid-frequency peak. It is clear from the Nyquist plots that the sample showing the highest photovoltaic performance has the lowest value of fmax (the highest electron lifetime).56 Relative electron lifetimes can also be estimated from open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements.57 Fig. S4† shows the OCVD profiles of the devices annealed at various temperatures. Compared to the other samples, the photoanode annealed at 250 °C shows the slowest decay in Voc after light cut-off. This means that the charge recombination process is the slowest in this photoanode compared to others. In other words, the photoanode treated at 250 °C has the highest electron lifetime compared to others. This results correlate well with the J–V and impedance measurements data.

Fig. 6d shows the IPCE spectra of the devices. An IPCE spectrum reflects the light response of the photovoltaic devices, which is directly related to Jsc. The device based on the photoanode thermally treated at 250 °C exhibits the highest quantum efficiency over the whole spectral range from 400 to 800 nm than that of the other thermally treated ZnO photoanodes. The maximum IPCE of the photoanode was 41.94% at 535 nm whereas other electrodes demonstrate relatively lower – i.e. 8.95%, 29.28%, 23.81% and 24.72% for the as-synthesized 150 °C, 350 °C and 450 °C annealed samples, respectively. The reason for a small increase in IPCE value (also the Jsc) for the 350 °C treated ZnO photoanode is unclear. A considerable increase in IPCE value can be mainly attributed to the good interconnectivity among nanoplates and the adhesion strength. The increase in IPCE is in good agreement with the enhanced value of Jsc.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an extremely simple but very effective solid-state synthesis method for the fabrication of various metal oxide nanostructures. This method is easily scalable and can be employed for large scale production of crystalline metal oxide powders. As an example for potential applications of these metal oxides, we demonstrated the application of ZnO nanoplates as a photoanode in DSSCs. Photoanodes composed of small nanoplates were spongy in nature, ensuring better connections among the nanostructures for the electron transport in the ZnO photoanode, and for the diffusion of redox couples in the electrolyte. We systematically studied the mechanism and the effect of the annealing temperature on DSSCs. The device with the low-temperature treated ZnO photoanode obtained using the solid-state reaction has demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 5%, which is certainly non-ignorable.
