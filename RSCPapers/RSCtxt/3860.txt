    , Accepted 17th October 2022First published on 18th October 2022AbstractHerein, we have employed linear-response time dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT)-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations to investigate the ultrafast charge transfer in a nonfullerene all-small-molecule donor–acceptor (D–A) system formed by a porphyrin small-molecule donor ZnP and a recently developed nonfullerene small-molecule acceptor 6TIC, during which the optimally tuned range-separated hybrid (OT-RSH) functional was adopted. In combination with static electronic structure calculations, several important conclusions were drawn. Firstly, the ZnP and 6TIC are more likely combined together non-covalently in parallel rather than in perpendicular to form ZnP-6TIC due to the much larger adsorption energies, i.e. −44.6 kcal mol−1vs. −25.2 kcal mol−1. Secondly, the excited state properties obtained by OT-RSH functionals seem more consistent with the experimental results compared to their untuned versions. Specifically, the energy of the lowest charge transfer (CT) state was predicted to be smaller than the lowest lying local excitation (LE) states using the OT-RSH functional-based LR-TDDFT calculations, which is beneficial for the charge transfer process that might be crucial for the high power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved experimentally. In contrast, the untuned RS functionals all predict higher CT state energies, which is contradictory to the high PCE obtained in the experiment. Moreover, strong hybridization upon excitation between these states was revealed, which might be one of the reasons responsible for the high PCE observed in the experiment. Finally, ultrafast excited state relaxation can be completed within 500 fs due to the small energy gaps and the strong nonadiabatic couplings between these states, which is accompanied by ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer from ZnP to 6TIC and photoinduced hole transfer the other way around. The efficient charge transfer processes and the involvement of two charge generation channels might be another cause resulting in the excellent photovoltaic performance of ZnP-6TIC based OSCs. Our present work not only provides solid evidence for elucidating the underlying mechanism observed in previous experiments, but also suggests that the combination of OT-RSH functionals and LR-TDDFT-based nonadiabatic dynamics simulations might be a powerful tool for investigating the excited state dynamics of organic D–A systems, which is crucial for the theoretical design of novel OSCs with better performances in the future.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for the next generation of solar cells due to their outstanding profits including low cost, nontoxicity, flexibility and easy fabrication.1–5 The most crucial part of the OSCs is the photovoltaic device consisting of the electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials. Upon irradiation of light with specific wavelengths, photoinduced electron or hole transfer dynamics may take place in the D–A interface, and the following charge separation and electron transport can therefore convert solar energy to power.6 The performance of the solar cells can be evaluated by the power conversion efficiency (PCE). To improve the PCE of OSCs, tremendous efforts have been devoted to designing and synthesizing novel D–A systems, which can either be polymers or small molecules.7–13 In particular, fullerenes and their derivatives are the most widely used electron acceptors in the early development of OSCs due to their excellent electron transport properties.14–18 However, the fullerene based acceptors (FA) suffer from several disadvantages including weak absorption in the solar spectrum, difficulty in tuning electronic and optical properties and poor photostability, which severely limit the further PCE enhancement of FA-based OSCs. To tackle this issue, nonfullerene acceptors (NFA) were developed as alternatives to the fullerenes,10,19–23 based on which the PCE of OSCs has exceeded 18% very recently.24–27
According to the structures of the organic donors and acceptors, these OSCs can also be classified into polymer-based OSCs (P-OSCs) and all-small-molecule OSCs (SM-OSCs). Even though the P-OSCs currently exhibit higher PCEs than the SM-OSCs, a drawback in batch-to-batch reproducibility of donor polymers potentially limits the mass deployment of OSCs.28 In contrast, the SM-OSCs seem more appealing in commercialization attributed to their well-defined molecular structures, simpler synthesis and purification, and low batch-to-batch variations.29–34 However, even though the PCE of NFA based P-OSCs has exceeded 18%, the PCE of NFA-based SM-OSCs (NFSM-OSCs) remains smaller than the fullerene based ones (∼10% vs. ∼11%) until 2019, when Gao et al. first achieved a very high PCE (12.08%) by incorporating two near-infrared absorbing molecules into NFSM-OSCs.35 In these novel NFSM-OSCs, a porphyrin small-molecule, ZnP-TBO (denoted as ZnP afterwards), was used as the electron donor and a recently developed nonfullerene small-molecule, 6TIC, acted as the electron acceptor. After their pioneering work, the performance of NFSM-OSCs was improved significantly and the PCE was enhanced to over 16% very recently.36–39 Unfortunately, despite the great enhancement of the PCE of these NFSM-OSCs, the underlying charge generation mechanism at the atomic level of these NFSM-OSCs remain largely unexplored.
In order to further improve the PCE of OSCs, it is crucial to elucidate the underlying charge generation mechanism at the D–A interfaces, which requires the aid of both experimental and theoretical investigations.6,40,41 Experimentally, lots of time-resolved spectroscopic studies have been performed to explore the photoinduced ultrafast excited states dynamics in different D–A interfaces.42–49 As to the theoretical studies, the exploration of photoinduced processes in these D–A systems may require electronic structure methods which can be used to calculate excited states sufficiently.50,51 Unfortunately, the experimentally called “small” molecules which usually contain a few hundred atoms are actually not “small” at all for ab initio calculations. Therefore, lots of wavefunction based high level electronic structure methods that can describe the excited states very accurate are not affordable for investigating the corresponding D–A systems in OSCs. Actually, the most widely used method for the excited state calculations of these D–A systems nowadays is the linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT).52,53 With the appropriate choice of exchange–correlation (XC) functionals, the LR-TDDFT method can obtain results comparable to those high level electronic structure methods. However, the choice of suitable functionals for a specific system is a non-trivial task, especially for the excited states of large D–A systems, which require a good description of charge transfer (CT) states.50,52,54 As a consequence, some widely used pure generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals (PBE, BLYP, BP86, etc.) and global hybrid functionals (B3LYP, PBE0, etc.) that perform well for ground state calculations may not be adequate enough for excited state calculations in these systems. To solve this problem, the range-separated (RS) functionals were developed,55,56 which can be used for a balanced treatment of exact exchange (eX) with approximate GGA exchange and correlation expressions. The simplest realization of the RS functional is achieved using eqn (1)55 (1)in which the interelectronic distance r12 is used for the separation of the exchange term into a short-range (SR) and a long-range (LR) part, erf(ωr12) and 1 − erf(ωr12) represent the standard and complementary error functions respectively, and the range-separation parameter ω represents the inverse of the distance at which the exchange term switches from DFT- to HF-like. Later on, a more general form of the above equation was proposed which allows for different amounts of eX in the SR and LR,56 as shown in eqn (2): (2)
In these RS functionals, the parameter α quantifies the fraction of eX in the SR limit while α + β gives the fraction of eX in the LR limit. These α, β and ω in some most widely used RS functionals including CAM-B3LYP,56ωB97X/ωB97XD,57,58 LC-PBE0/LC-ωPBE,59–61etc. are usually obtained empirically or semi-empirically by parametrizing against some particular benchmark data sets. Unfortunately, using the default parameters of these RS functionals might be problematic in some occasions due to the limitations of the benchmark data sets. To solve such problems, the optimally tuned RS hybrid (OT-RSH) functionals were proposed, in which the three parameters, especially the range-separation parameter ω, could be optimized non-empirically so that a fundamental property that the exact functional must obey in exact Kohn–Sham (KS) or generalized KS (GKS) theory is fulfilled,62i.e. for a N-electron system, the negative of the HOMO energy −εHOMO(N) must equal the molecular vertical ionization potential (IP(N)). For a given system, the optimal ω can therefore be obtained by minimizing the J in the following eqn (3), which was first proposed by Baer et al.,63,64 J(N) = |εHOMO(N) + (IP(N))|(3)
In D–A systems, apart from the vertical ionization potential which is related to the electron donor component, the correct description of the vertical electron affinity of the electron acceptor is of equal importance. In a N-electron system, the vertical electron affinity can be considered as the ionization potential of the N + 1 electron system. Therefore, the optimization of ω in D–A systems can be done by minimizing the J2 in eqn (4), as carried out in some previous works65–67 J2(N, N + 1) = J2(N) + J2(N + 1)(4)where J2 is used since it is more sensitive to ω than the J defined in eqn (3). Nowadays, this kind of non-empirically tuned RS functionals have witnessed great success in fields ranging from OSCs to thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADFs) due to their effectiveness in predicting the excited state properties of various D–A systems. Interested readers can refer to some relevant reviews for more theoretical backgrounds and applications of OT-RSH functionals.63,68,69
Inspired by the great success of those OT-RSH functionals in predicting the excited state properties of various D–A systems, we have in this work employed LR-TDDFT calculations with optimally tuned RS-functionals to explore the excited states of an all-small-molecule based D–A system ZnP-6TIC,35 based on which high PCE NFSM-OSCs have been achieved. Moreover, the LR-TDDFT based nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations adopting the OT-RSH functional were also conducted for the first time to obtain a more in-depth understanding of the charge transfer mechanisms in this organic D–A system. In comparison with the results obtained by untuned RS functionals and the available data in the experiment, we proposed that the combination of OT-RSH functional and LR-TDDFT based NAMD simulations might be a powerful tool for investigating the excited state dynamics of complicated D–A systems.
Simulation details
All minimum-energy structures including ZnP and 6TIC, and ZnP-6TIC in different conformations mentioned in this work were first optimized using the PBE functional in combination with the D3 van der Waals correction proposed by Grimme et al., during which the 6-31G* basis sets were adopted all the time.70–74 Moreover, all side chains of ZnP (R1 and R2 in Fig. 1(a)) and 6TIC (R3 in Fig. 1(a)) were replaced by a single hydrogen atom in order to reduce the computational efforts. After that, relevant excited state calculations were carried out using the LR-TDDFT method with different RS functionals, including three untuned RS functionals (CAM-B3LYP,56ωB97XD,58 LC-PBE061), and one OT-RSH functional (LC-PBE0*).
 Fig. 1  The chemical structures of ZnP and 6TIC respectively (a) and the PBE + D3 optimized 3D structure of the ZnP-6TIC dyads model system in parallel conformation (b) explored in the present work. The side chains are all replaced by hydrogen atoms to reduce the computational efforts. 
After that, we performed the FSSH method based NAMD simulations at the LR-TDDFT level, which was recently implemented in the GTSH program to explore the ultrafast charge transfer in the ZnP-6TIC system.75,76 All the required data such as potential energies, NACTs, etc. were calculated using the OT-RSH functional TD-LC-PBE0*, which was selected according to static electronic structure calculations (see below for more details). NACTs between two involved electronic states were numerically computed using our recently implemented algorithm.75,77–79 In surface hopping dynamics, the empirical quantum decoherence correction proposed by Granucci et al. with a value of 0.1 a.u. was used.80–82 Moreover, NAMD simulations were performed with classical path approximation, which has been demonstrated to work very well for describing excited-state relaxation without involving large conformational change and bond-forming or -breaking.75,77,78,83–85 The minimum-energy structure of ZnP-6TIC was first heated to 300 K and equilibrated there for about 1 ps using the Nosé–Hoover chain thermostat technique with a chain length of five.70,74,86,87 Then, the NVE dynamics simulations of 1 ps were performed, from which 1000 initial conditions were generated randomly according to the vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths. All the ab initio adiabatic molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed using the PBE + D3 method with a time step of 1 fs. Starting from each initial condition, 300 trajectories were propagated for 500 fs with a time step of 1 fs. The final statistical results were obtained by averaging these 1000 × 300 trajectories. In order to reflect the detailed balance condition under classical path approximation, hop rejection and velocity rescaling were replaced by scaling transition probabilities pkj (t) with a Boltzmann factor pkj(t) = pkj(t)bkj(t)(5)where . This modification has been successfully employed in many ab initio based NAMD simulations of various materials.75,77,78,83,85 All geometry optimizations and LR-TDDFT calculations were carried out using GAUSSIAN09.88 The optimal ω was obtained using the optDFTw program written by Lu et al., in which the Brent algorithm was used for minimizing the J2 in eqn (4).89 AIMD simulations at the PBE + D3 level were conducted using the QUICKSTEP module implemented in CP2K7.1 with DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH basis sets and Goedecker–Teter–Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials.90–95 In this work, all NAMD were conducted using the GTSH package.76 Relevant electron and hole densities were calculated using Multiwfn3.7.96,97
Results and discussions
Due to the large molecular size of both ZnP and 6TIC (Fig. 1(a)), there are several possible conformations when these two molecules combine together non-covalently via van der Waals interactions according to their different relative orientations. Specifically, relative orientations in parallel and perpendicular are two special situations when the two molecules hold together. Therefore, we have constructed and optimized the corresponding minimum-energy dimer structures formed by ZnP and 6TIC, as shown in Fig. 1(b) (in parallel) and Fig. S1 (ESI†) (in perpendicular). As can be seen, for the parallel conformation, only parts of the molecules are stacked close to each other while the other parts of the two components are far from each other. This structure can be regarded as a counterbalance between the π–π stacking interaction and the steric effects introduced by the phenyl side chains of 6TIC. The adsorption energy of this conformation is calculated to be −44.6 kcal mol−1. In contrast, due to the lack of π–π stacking interaction in the perpendicular conformation, the adsorption energy turns out to be −25.2 kcal mol−1, which is much reduced compared with the parallel one. Based on these facts, we conclude that the parallel conformation is much more stable than the perpendicular conformation. Therefore, we will only concentrate on the excited state properties of the parallel conformation in the following parts, which is referred to as ZnP-6TIC subsequently.
As elaborated previously, RS functionals are required in relevant LR-TDDFT calculations for exploring the excited states of the ZnP-6TIC to correctly capture the CT state properties. In order to figure out the influence of different RS functionals, we have performed vertical excitation energy calculations with several RS functionals, including the widely used CAM-B3LYP, ωB97XD, LC-PBE0, and optimally tuned version of LC-PBE0, which is denoted as LC-PBE0* afterwards. The three crucial parameters for these RS functionals, i.e. α, β and ω, are listed in Table 1. Using different functionals, we have calculated the lowest lying fifteen singlet excited states and compared their results. To be concise, only the most representative excited states, i.e. S1 to S4, are analyzed and discussed in detail. Table 2 lists all the vertical excitation energies obtained with different functionals. As can be seen, the vertical excitation energies obtained using CAM-B3LYP, ωB97XD and LC-PBE0 are overall higher than the optimally tuned LC-PBE0*. Using the results of LC-PBE0* as references, the averaged corresponding energy differences of the lowest four excited states are calculated to be 0.235 eV (CAM-B3LYP), 0.292 eV (ωB97XD) and 0.369 eV (LC-PBE0) respectively. More importantly, apart from the vertical excitation energies, the electronic structures of these excited states, which are crucial for understanding their photoinduced electron/hole and energy transfer dynamics, are also distinct from each other using different functionals, as reflected by the relevant electron–hole densities depicted in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2–S4 (ESI†). For all untuned functionals, the electron and hole densities are both located on the ZnP molecule for their S1 state (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†), corresponding to a clear LE state of ZnP. In contrast, for the results obtained by LC-PBE0* (Fig. 2), the electron density is localized on the 6TIC while the hole density is located on ZnP in the S1 state, which is a clear CT state where ZnP acts as the electron donor and 6TIC is the electron acceptor. Similar discrepancies can also be found in other states ranging from S2 to S4.

 Fig. 2  TD-LC-PBE0* calculated photoinduced electron (orange) and hole (purple) densities of the lowest four singlet excited states of ZnP-6TIC dyads. Also shown are their corresponding electronic structure characteristics roughly assigned according to their spatial distributions of electron and hole densities. 
These assignments are further seconded by the fragment based 1TDM analysis shown in Fig. S6–S9 (ESI†), in which the X axis represents the donor fragments while the Y axis represents the acceptor fragments and the color bar represents the values of the relevant donor to acceptor transitions. Overall, the energies of the lowest lying LE states predicted by the untuned RS functionals are lower than the lowest lying CT states while the tuned functionals predict contrary results. However, the lowest lying LE state might prohibit efficient charge transfer processes required for achieving a high PCE as revealed in our previous work, which is contradictory to the experimental fact that the ZnP-6TIC based NFSM-OSCs exhibit a record high PCE over 12%.35 Therefore, the excited state results obtained by the OT-RSH functional, i.e. LC-PBE0*, seem more reasonable. Moreover, the absorption spectra for 6TIC and ZnP respectively are experimentally available,35 from which some important information can be drawn. One of them is the significant overlap in the range from 600 nm to 1000 nm between the spectra of 6TIC and ZnP, implying that the vertical excitation energies of the lowest lying LE bright excited states of 6TIC and ZnP should be close to each other. To further evaluate the reliability of the involved functionals, we first calculate the energy differences between the lowest lying bright LE states (oscillator strengths larger than 0.1) between 6TIC and ZnP. The differences are calculated to be 0.26 eV for CAM-B3LYP (S2 − S1), 0.32 eV for ωB97XD (S3 − S1), and 0.43 eV for LC-PBE0 (S3 − S1), which are all larger than 0.14 eV (S3 − S2) predicted by the tuned functional LC-PBE0*. Additionally, the absorption spectrum can be simulated based on the vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths using the semi-classical method elaborated in the Methods section in the ESI.† Fig. S11 depicts the simulated absorption spectra obtained with different functionals using the lowest fifteen singlet excited states and the experimental spectra of 6TIC and ZnP are also shown for comparison.35 It is worth noting that the calculated results should be regarded as a spectral combination of 6TIC and ZnP. Since there is no spectrum available for ZnP-6TIC dyads, we simply regard the addition of the two individual spectra as the absorption spectrum comparable to the computational results, which exhibits a broad band ranging from 600 nm to 1000 nm and peaked around 800 nm. As can be seen, even though almost all computed spectra exhibit a blue-shifted peak compared with the experiment,35 the results obtained with the OT-RSH functional are much closer to the experiment. Considering the fact that the excitation wavelength is inversely proportional to the vertical excitation energies, the energy differences between the peak of the computed spectra and the experimentally obtained one are actually 0.21 eV for LC-PBE0*, 0.37 eV for CAM-B3LYP, 0.46 eV for ωB97XD, and 0.88 eV for LC-PBE0 respectively. Therefore, the absorption maximum reproduced by the OT-RSH functional is indeed very close to the experimental results.35 In combination with the electronic structure results, we believe that the OT-RSH functional is more reasonable than the untuned ones.
We need to emphasize that agreement between the experimental and theoretical results is only one of the criteria to justify the effectiveness of the chosen functional in the LR-TDDFT calculations. More solid justifications may require extensive benchmarks using more accurate electronic structure methods for the excited states. Unfortunately, due to the large size of the system explored here (221 atoms in total), none of these high level electronic structure methods are affordable considering our limited computational sources. Despite this discrepancy, we believe that our results are reliable considering the great success of the OT-RSH functionals and we sincerely hope that more theoretical explorations can be conducted in the future to further validate our present work. Moreover, in order to confirm that the OT-RSH functionals are less functional dependent than the untuned ones, we have also optimized the ω parameter in ωB97XD, resulting in its optimally tuned version ωB97XD*. The electron–hole densities (Fig. S5, ESI†), 1TDM (Fig. S10, ESI†), and absorption spectrum (Fig. S11, ESI†) obtained using ωB97XD* are overall very similar to the results obtained by LC-PBE0*, indicating the less functional dependent results of these OT-RSH functionals.
Based on the above results, we decided to use the OT-RSH functional LC-PBE0* for subsequent studies. We first take a closer look at the simulated spectra. Since each adiabatic state can be regarded as a linear combination of four kinds of excitons, namely two LE excitons  and , and two CT excitons  and , the coefficients of them correspond to the fragment based 1TDM results, as elaborated before.75,78,98–100 Therefore, the simulated absorption spectra can also be split into the contribution of these four components, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 3. There are two absorption bands appearing in the range from 450 nm to 1000 nm, which are peaked at 552 nm and 705 nm respectively and the 705 nm peaked band is much stronger than the 552 nm peaked one. In Franck–Condon point, the 552 nm band is mainly composed of  and  while all four excitons have comparable contributions to the 705 nm band, indicating strong hybridization between these excitons. Additionally, the significant overlap between  and  components is even more obvious, as pointed out previously, which agrees well with the experimental facts.35 However, the absorption spectra simulation using the minima of ground state only (i.e. the spectra at Franck–Condon point) may not be adequate since the nuclear dynamical effects are not considered. Therefore, we additionally simulate the absorption spectrum using 1000 MD snapshots based on the semi-classical method proposed by Barbatti et al.,101 as depicted in the right panel of Fig. 3. In this method, we need to first select several molecular structures in the ground state, which can be obtained by molecular dynamics simulations. After that, we need to calculate their corresponding vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths, based on which the absorption spectra considering nuclear dynamical effects can be obtained. Interested readers can refer to the Methods section in the ESI† or previous works for more details.101 As can be seen, the shape of the absorption spectra is overall very similar to the one obtained in the Franck–Condon point except that the previous 705 nm peak is red-shifted to 721 nm, which is even closer to the experimental results and the significant overlap between  and  components remains the same as before.35 In contrast, the 552 nm peaked band is less affected by the thermal motion of the nuclei. Despite the similar profiles, the contributions of different excitons to the spectra change when taking the nuclear dynamical effects into consideration. The 552 nm peaked band turns out to mainly consist of the LE exciton , which agrees with the experimental fact that ZnP exhibits a band around 550 nm while 6TIC does not.35 The 721 nm peaked band is mainly contributed by the LE excitons  and  while the CT excitons  and  contribute a comparable minor fraction, which is different from the Franck–Condon point where all four excitons have comparable contributions. However, the strong hybridization between these excitons remains the same. The closeness of the LE excitons of  and  around the 721 nm peak is also anticipatable considering their significant overlap observed in the experiment.35 Upon excitation with energy close to the 721 nm peaked band, a collection of different kinds of excitons will be generated, from which subsequent photoinduced energy or electron/hole transfer dynamics may occur.

Despite the valuable information provided by the static electronic structure excited state calculations, the evaluation of the photoinduced dynamics of ZnP-6TIC dyads requires NAMD simulation. Therefore, we have explored the related photoinduced dynamics of ZnP-6TIC using the FSSH method at the LR-TDDFT level implemented by us recently.75,78,98–100 To simulate the dynamics upon excitation of the 721 nm peaked band, we selected the initial populated adiabatic states based on the vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths. A total of 1000 initial conditions were selected accordingly and for each initial condition 300 FSSH trajectories were propagated for about 500 fs with a time step of 1 fs. The final results were obtained by averaging these 1000 × 300 trajectories. Interested readers can refer to our previous work for more details.75,78,98–100 The distribution of these initial states ranges from S1 to S7 and the maximum appears in S3 (see the left panel of Fig. 4), which is anticipatable due to the closeness of these lowest lying excited states. Starting from these initial states, the time-dependent state population obtained by NAMD simulations are shown in the right panel of Fig. 4. The initial populations are mainly composed of the S1 to S4 states with weights of 0.11, 0.20, 0.39 and 0.23 respectively, while S5 to S7 contribute the remaining 0.07. As time goes by, apart from the weight of S1 which increases from 0.11 to nearly unity, all other state weights decrease to zero within 500 fs simulation time, indicating ultrafast excited state relaxation processes. Specifically, S4 decreases to zero in the first 100 fs while S2 and S3 decrease to nearly zero around 500 fs.
 Fig. 4  Distribution of initial selected excited states for FSSH simulations (left) and time-dependent state populations of the lowest seven relevant singlet excited states (right). 
The rate of nonadiabatic transitions is mainly determined by the energy gaps and nonadiabatic couplings between excited states. To determine the reason for the ultrafast excited state relaxation dynamics of ZnP-6TIC observed in the right panel of Fig. 4, we have additionally calculated the distributions of energy gaps between adjacent adiabatic states and the averaged NACTs. As depicted in Fig. 5, the distribution of energy gaps between adjacent states ranges from 0.0 to 5.0 kcal mol−1 with a maximum around 2.0 kcal mol−1 and the averaged value is calculated to be 2.18 kcal mol−1. At the same time, most of the NACTs between adjacent states have values larger than 50 ps−1, which is reasonable according to their quantitative relationship with energy gaps, , i.e. the smaller the energy gaps, the larger the NACTs. Therefore, the near degenerate energies and strong nonadiabatic couplings between these states finally result in the ultrafast exciton relaxation dynamics of ZnP-6TIC.

Based on the FSSH simulation results, we can further obtain the time dependent exciton dynamics in a similar way to the split of the absorption spectra, as shown in Fig. 6(a). At the initial time of the simulation, all four kinds of excitons are involved: the LE excitons  (0.34) and  (0.30) contribute most, which are followed by the CT excitons  (0.22) and  (0.13). This fact indicates the strong hybridization between LE and CT excitons upon irradiation, which might facilitate the charge transfer process, as highlighted in previous work.102 After that, the weights of  and  decrease to 0.15 and 0.04 respectively, which is accompanied by the increase of the  from 0.22 to 0.48 during the 500 fs simulation time. At the same time, the weight of  remains nearly unchanged, i.e. from 0.34 to 0.33, which might be ascribed to the strong hybridization between the LE exciton  and CT exciton  due to their closeness in energy. Furthermore, the time dependent photoinduced hole and electron weights can also be obtained conveniently, which can be correlated with the photoinduced hole transfer (PHT) and electron transfer (PET) processes, as shown in Fig. 6(b and c). For the PHT process, the hole weight of ZnP increases monotonously from the initial 0.56 to 0.81 in 500 fs, in company with the decrease of hole weight of 6TIC from 0.44 to 0.19, revealing a clear ultrafast hole transfer process from 6TIC to ZnP. Similarly, the PET transfer process from ZnP to 6TIC can be established according to Fig. 6(c), even though the PET amount seems smaller than the PHT amount (0.10 vs. 0.25). Therefore, we can safely conclude that both channel I charge generation (PET process from donor ZnP to acceptor 6TIC) and channel II charge generation (PHT process from acceptor 6TIC to donor ZnP) pathways are both involved in the charge generation process, which might be another cause for the excellent photovoltaic performance of the ZnP-6TIC based OSCs. Such multi-channel exciton dissociation processes have also been revealed theoretically in some other organic systems responsible for the high photovoltaic efficiencies. For instance, Cao et al. have attributed the excellent organic photovoltaic performance of in complexes consisting of a wide bandgap polymer donor D18 and a narrow-bandgap small-molecule acceptor Y6 to the multi-channel exciton-dissociation taking place upon excitation.103 Our group also found similar phenomenon in a nonfullerene donor–acceptor interface consisting of a polymer donor PTB7 and molecule nonfullerene acceptor PDI interface.100

Finally, we need to emphasize that even though the parallel configuration is the most stable one, there might be several different donor–acceptor configurations in real materials due to the complicated interactions between these molecules, and one single configuration may not be adequate enough to reveal the complex photoinduced processes of the present system. However, nonadiabatic dynamics simulations for several configurations remain difficult to us due to the formidable computational efforts. As a compromise, we decided to calculate the vertical excitation properties of several typical configurations, which might be helpful for us to obtain some valuable insights. Since the main variable of the donor–acceptor configurations in the present work is the relative orientations between the 6TIC and ZnP, we have additionally calculated the vertical excitation properties including the excitation energies (see Table S1, ESI†), photoinduced electron and hole densities (Fig. S12 and S13, ESI†) of the two configurations of the donor–acceptor system in addition to the parallel configuration (∼0°) discussed before, in which the initial relative degree between the two molecules is ∼45° and ∼90° (the perpendicular configuration mentioned before) respectively. As can be seen, the excited state properties of the ∼45° configuration is overall very similar to the parallel one, in contrast, the charge transfer state in the perpendicular configuration exhibits an even higher energy than the parallel one. These results imply that the parallel or nearly parallel donor–acceptor configurations formed by ZnP and 6TIC are more beneficial for the charge separation processes than the perpendicular one.
Conclusions
In summary, we have in this work employed LR-TDDFT-based NAMD simulations in combination with static electronic structure calculations to investigate the ultrafast excited state dynamics of ZnP-6TIC dyads for the first time, based on which several important conclusions could be drawn. First, the ZnP-6TIC dyads are more likely to be combined non-covalently in a parallel conformation rather than the perpendicular one due to their much larger adsorption energies, i.e. −44.6 kcal mol−1vs. −25.2 kcal mol−1. Second, since the correct prediction of the excited states of the investigated system requires an appropriate choice of functionals, we have performed vertical excitation calculations using several available RS functionals including three untuned functionals including CAM-B3LYP, ωB97XD and LC-PBE0, and one OT-RSH functional LC-PBE0*. In combination with the experimentally available facts, we propose that the results obtained with the OT-RSH functional seem more reasonable than the untuned ones.35 Therefore, subsequent spectroscopic results and NAMD simulations were investigated using the tuned LC-PBE0* functional. According to the in-depth analysis of the absorption spectra, the band peaked around 700 nm turns out to be composed of all four kinds of possible excitons, namely two LE excitons  and , and two CT excitons  and , implying that strong hybridization between these states may occur upon excitation of this band, which might be one of the reasons responsible for the high PCE observed in previous experiment.35 Upon excitation, ultrafast excited states relaxation can be completed within 500 fs due to the close energy and the strong nonadiabatic couplings between these states. Finally, ultrafast PET from ZnP to 6TIC and PHT the other way around take place simultaneously in company with the relaxation process, which might be another cause leading to the excellent photovoltaic performance of ZnP-6TIC based OSCs.35 Our present work not only gives solid evidence for elucidating the underlying mechanism observed in previous experiments, but also suggests the necessity for applying OT-RSH functionals to correctly capture the excited state properties of organic D–A systems, which might be crucial for the rational design of novel high performance OSCs with the aid of theoretical calculations in the future.

 	Fig. 2  TD-LC-PBE0* calculated photoinduced electron (orange) and hole (purple) densities of the lowest four singlet excited states of ZnP-6TIC dyads. Also shown are their corresponding electronic structure characteristics roughly assigned according to their spatial distributions of electron and hole densities.	 

 	Fig. 3  TD-LC-PBE0* simulated absorption spectra of ZnP-6TIC dyads at the Franck–Condon point (left) and using 1000 MD snapshots (right), in which the lowest lying fifteen singlet excited states are involved. Also shown are the contributions of four different kinds of excitons.	 

 	Fig. 4  Distribution of initial selected excited states for FSSH simulations (left) and time-dependent state populations of the lowest seven relevant singlet excited states (right).	 

 	Fig. 5  Distribution of the energy gaps (in kcal mol−1) of the two nearest electronic states Ei+1 − Ei among the ten lowest excited singlet states in the nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and averaged NACTs between these electronic states (in ps−1).	 

 	Fig. 6  Time-dependent weights of (a) different excitons; (b) photoinduced hole localized on ZnP (in blue) and 6TIC (in red); (c) photoinduced electron localized on ZnP (in blue) and 6TIC (in red).
