1. Introduction
Luminescent materials have found a wide range of applications in all walks of daily life, including advanced optical displays, solid state lighting, X-ray intensification, scintillation and many more.1 Therefore, enormous efforts have been devoted to explore novel luminescent materials so far, which is the need of the hour. These materials are generally characterized by the emission of light in the visible range, but can exist in other spectral regions also (such as ultraviolet or infrared) with energy beyond the thermal equilibrium.1–3 The ever-growing demand for newer luminescent materials has motivated scientific and technological efforts to improve the existing features of luminescent materials and to provide encouragement for the development of new effective luminescent nanomaterials having the desired shape, size, morphology, optical properties, etc.4 These nanomaterials have a wide range of applications such as photovoltaic, bio-medical, anti-counterfeiting, solid state lighting, display technologies, etc. One of their extremely important uses is the development of security inks for anti-counterfeiting applications. These nanomaterials can easily be applied inexpensively to different surfaces and have been implemented widely as security inks to protect high-value merchandise, documents, pharmaceuticals and currency.5 Counterfeiting is an ever growing global problem that challenges companies, governments and customers.6 Anti-counterfeiting techniques that make genuine items harder to copy and easier to authenticate are therefore important for the protection of brands and valuable documents.7 Luminescent tags are the most popular security elements for protecting authentic articles.7 One way to incorporate luminescent nanomaterials as luminescent security elements is to print them with luminescent inks.8 Nowadays, these printed luminescent security elements usually comprise only solid or halftone single ink color patterns.9 Typical examples are bank notes that show luminescent parts under UV light.9 Procedures for producing full color images by printing luminescent inks exist.10 These methods use several luminescent inks with different luminescent colors to form a full color image by luminescence.7 However, they are either colorimetrically inaccurate or use complex halftoning algorithms.7 Many luminescent inks and markers used, for example as security inks, are made of lanthanide compounds.11 The distinctive character of the emission from lanthanide ions and particularly, their unique spectral fingerprints, enable the use of emissions and colors from lanthanide blends as security labels, markers or tags.7
Counterfeiting in the fields of medicine and edible items can severely endanger human health. During the last decade, millions of dollars have been spent worldwide by governments and industries to safeguard their products and currencies from being counterfeited.12 The efforts have yielded positive results but still there is further demand to develop improved anti-counterfeiting nanomaterials and to build a suitable strategy for the fabrication and design of security inks to deter counterfeiting.
Here, we present a review which is deeply focused on the synthesis of strategic luminescent nanomaterials, their morphology/microstructural characterization, fabrication of security inks and their application against counterfeiting. During the past few decades, a number of anti-counterfeiting technologies such as simple markers, plasmonic security labels, holograms, and security inks have been developed as a shield against counterfeiting.13–18 Merely a few review articles have been reported where development of anti-counterfeiting technologies is discussed collectively using lanthanide doped luminescent nanomaterials, quantum dots (semiconductor and carbon based), luminescent metal organic frameworks as well as plasmonic nanomaterial based security inks on a single platform. The present review article systematically describes in detail the historical background of luminescent materials, basic concepts, luminescent mechanism, synthesis methods with their characterization, fabrication of luminescent inks, security printing techniques and anti-counterfeiting applications using various types of luminescent nanomaterials: lanthanide doped luminescent nanomaterials (downconversion/downshift, upconversion and dual mode), quantum dots (semiconductor and carbon dots), luminescent metal organic frameworks and plasmonic nanomaterials.
1.1 Historical background and basic concepts of luminescent materials
Materials that glow in the dark after exposure to light have been known as ‘phosphors’ ever since the early 17th century. Phosphor is a Greek word which means ‘light bearer’. There are many ancient reports related to minerals that glow in the dark. The most distinguished among them was Bolognian phosphor (impure barium sulfate, BaSO4) discovered by a cobbler Vincenzo Cascariolo in 1602.19 Before the discovery of Bolognian stone, it is believed that the Japanese had reportedly prepared phosphorescent paint from seashells. This fact is documented in a 10th century Chinese document (Song dynasty) which credits the Japanese for preparing phosphors for the first time.20 Similarly, blue colour emission was also observed from infusion of a wood by Nicolas Monardes (a Spanish physician and botanist) in 1565 and was used to treat kidney and urinary diseases (Fig. 1a).19,21–26 Later on this wood was called lignum nephriticum. The extracts from this wood were further investigated by Boyle, Newton and others but the phenomenon was not understood at that time.19,27

Later, Edward D. Clarke, Professor of Mineralogy at the University of Cambridge reported an abnormal property of fluorite crystals in 1819. The crystals were highly transparent in nature and had dichroic behaviour. In these crystals, the reflected light was deep sapphire blue, whereas the transmitted light was bright green as shown in Fig. 1b. But Clarke was unable to explain that phenomenon. Later on a French mineralogist Rene Just Hauy also discussed the double colour of some fluorite crystals in 1822.
He explained the phenomenon as a type of opalescence (which is observed with opal, a naturally occurring hydrated silica glass, and results from light scattering): the two colors were complementary, violet being the dominant shade of the scattered light and green being the dominant shade of the transmitted (i.e., unscattered) light.
Although the explanation was incorrect19 and the correct one was still a long way off Hauy's view, two minerals fluorite and opal were going to play a key role in understanding and naming the fluorescence. After that, a famous paper titled, “on refrangibility of light” published by Sir G. G. Stokes, a physicist and professor of mathematics at Cambridge in 1852 proved to be a ground breaking event in the history of photoluminescence.28
Later on in 1888, a German physicist, Eilhard Wiedemann was the first to introduce the word ‘Luminescence’ for both the fluorescence and phosphorescence phenomena. The term luminescence was taken from a Latin word lumen, which means light. Nowadays, luminescence is defined as the phenomenon of spontaneous emission of radiation from an electronically excited species (or from a vibrationally excited species) not in thermal equilibrium with its environment.19,29 Fluorescence and phosphorescence can be distinguished on the basis of the duration of emission after the end of excitation: fluorescence is considered as emission of light that disappears simultaneously after the end of excitation whereas in phosphorescence the emitted light persists after the end of excitation.19 But such a distinction between fluorescence and phosphorescence is not always appropriate because there is long-lived fluorescence (e.g., divalent europium salts) and short-lived phosphorescence (e.g., violet luminescence of zinc sulfide) whose durations are comparable (several hundreds of nanoseconds).19 In 1929 Francis Perrin defined phosphorescence as the phenomenon where the excited species passes through an intermediate state before emission.30 More precisely, fluorescence and phosphorescence can be defined in terms of the change in spin multiplicity. The spin multiplicity remains the same in the case of fluorescence whereas it changes from triplet to singlet or vice versa in the case of phosphorescence.19 The schematic diagram (Jablonski diagram) for fluorescence and phosphorescence is shown in Fig. 2.

Luminescence can also be classified on the basis of the source of excitation as shown in Table 1.

1.2 Lanthanide doped luminescent nanomaterials
Recently, lanthanide based luminescent nanostructures have been recognized worldwide for their good chemical and optical properties originating from their unique electronic structures as well as due to their wide range of applications in photovoltaics, bio-medical, anti-counterfeiting, solid state lighting, display technologies, etc.31–59 Lanthanide based luminescent nanomaterials are also known as nanophosphors. Generally, nanophosphors have one or more trivalent lanthanide ions doped in the host lattice. There are 15 rare-earth elements including scandium and yttrium which can be used as trivalent ions in lanthanide based luminescent nanomaterials. The lanthanide based luminescent materials show sharp emission due to their intra-4f or 4f–5d electronic transitions. The lanthanide doped luminescent nanomaterials have many advantages over other luminescent materials (organic dyes, quantum dots, plasmonic materials, etc.) like sharp emission, broad excitation spectra, good thermal stability, low toxicity, a longer lifetime, better chemical stability, high photochemical stability, etc.34 The lanthanide doped luminescent materials can exhibit emission from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near infrared light region depending upon excitation. The lanthanide doped luminescent nanomaterials are further divided into two types depending upon their luminescence emission mechanism as described below:

1.2.1 Downconversion/downshift luminescence. 
In this luminescence process, a high energy photon is converted into a low energy photon. This energy difference between the emitted and absorbed photons is known as the Stokes shift. A schematic diagram of the downconversion luminescence process is shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagram for the downconversion luminescence process. 
Downconversion luminescent materials generally consist of a host lattice doped with trivalent lanthanide ions. There are several types of lanthanide based host lattices such as oxides, fluoride, vanadate, oxy-sulfide, phosphate etc.34 The lanthanide trivalent ions doped in a rare-earth host lattice act as an activator. The role of the host lattice is to absorb the energy (photons) and transfer it to the activator. Mostly in downconversion luminescent materials, the host lattice also acts as a sensitizer. For example in the Y2O3 host lattice O2− acts as the sensitizer while in the case of GdVO4, VO43− acts as the sensitizer. The emission efficiency in both the cases is high due to efficient energy transfer from the host to the activator. The doping concentration of lanthanide ions is optimized so that the crystal structure of the host lattice with or without doping remains the same. In our earlier report, we have established that the optimum doping concentration of Eu3+ in the Y2O3 host lattice is 5 mol%.15 Besides the dopant concentration, the PL intensity is also influenced by some other factors, such as the host lattice, particle size, calcination temperature, environment, and synthesis conditions.15,34,60–69 The efficiency of downconversion can also be enhanced by doping of another lanthanide ion which acts as the sensitizer. The sensitizer sufficiently transfers energy from the host lattice to the activator, resulting in enhancement of the luminescence efficiency. However, there are limited examples available in the literature of co-doping in the case of downconversion. The Ce3+ ion is the most commonly used for co-doping in order to increase the luminescence efficiency of Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Tb, Dy, Sm) ions. There are many reports on downconversion luminescent nanomaterials reported in the literature, where Ce3+ acts as the sensitizer such as NaGdF4:Ce,Ln, BaYF5:Ce,Tb, YPO4:Ce,Tb, GdF3:Ce,Ln and Sr3Y2(BO3)4:Ce,Dy.69–74 In all these luminescent materials, it is interesting to note that the excitation spectra are dominated by 4f–5d absorption of Ce3+ ions, whereas the emission spectra are characteristic of Ln3+ ions, indicating the energy transfer from Ce3+ to Ln3+ ions.34


1.2.2 Upconversion luminescence. 
In upconversion (UC) luminescence, a low energy photon is converted into a high energy photon by a non-linear process. Conceptually, in the upconversion process, two or more photons are absorbed and converted into higher energy photons (generally NIR, visible and UV). In general, upconversion utilizes sequential absorption of multiple photons through the use of a long lifetime and real ladder-like energy levels of trivalent lanthanide ions embedded in an appropriate inorganic host lattice to produce higher energy photons. This energy difference between the emitted and absorbed photons is known as the anti-Stokes shift.38 The upconverting phosphors generally consist of an inorganic host lattice doped with emitters Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+ and Yb3+ (trivalent lanthanide ions) which produce emission when they are in excited states. The emission wavelength can be tuned by appropriate selection of trivalent lanthanide ions. There are three main mechanisms for the upconversion process: excited state absorption, energy transfer upconversion and photon avalanche.45 The schematic diagrams for the upconversion process are shown in Fig. 4a–g. A schematic diagram of the excited state absorption upconversion mechanism for single lanthanide ion doped luminescent materials is shown in Fig. 4a. The excited state absorption mechanism is a successive absorption of two photons as shown in Fig. 4a. When the lanthanide ion is excited with suitable energy photons from the ground state (E1) to a higher energy level (E2), another photon promotes the excited ion to a higher energy state (E3). The upconversion occurs when photons drop from the excited state (E3) to the ground state (E1). The energy-transfer upconversion process is the most efficient process. The five different types of energy-transfer upconversion processes are shown in Fig. 4b–f. In excited state absorption (Fig. 4b), the sensitizer ions absorbed the photons and transit from the ground state (E1) to the excited state (E2). The energy transfer occurs from the sensitizer ion to the activator ion, which is in the excited state (E2). The energy transfer promotes activator ions from the lower energy state (E2) to the higher energy state (E3). In successive energy transfer (Fig. 4c), only the sensitizer ion absorbs photons and promotes the activator ion to energy levels (E2) and (E3) by two successive energy transfers. The sensitizer and activator ions both are of similar nature in cross-relaxation upconversion (Fig. 4d). The activator and sensitizer ions absorb photons in their excited state (E2). The energy transfer process then promotes the activator ion to its excited state E3 while the sensitizer reverts to the ground state.45Fig. 4e and f show that the energy transfer upconversion involves the cooperative effect. In these cases, luminescence nanomaterials having more than one ion take part in the sensitization or luminescence process. In the case of cooperative sensitization (Fig. 4e), two sensitizer ions (ion 1 and ion 2) absorb photons and then together transfer this energy to the activator ion (ion 3) which promotes ion 3 to an excited state (E3). However, in the case of cooperative luminescence, two excited ions (ion 1 and ion 2) absorb photons and cooperate in producing emission (Fig. 4f). The photon avalanche is shown in Fig. 4g. This process requires a minimum excitation power called the threshold value. Above the threshold value, the luminescence intensity increases by an order of magnitude. Basically, the photon avalanche is a looping process that is associated with processes of excited state absorption (ESA) for excitation light and efficient cross relaxation (CR) that produce feedback as shown in Fig. 4g. Initially non-resonant weak ground state absorption populates the level E1 of ion 2 and the looping process starts with the ESA process to elevate ion 2 at the level E1 to the emitting level E2. An efficient CR process of E2 (ion 2) + G (ion 1) → E1 (ion 2) + E1 (ion 1) between ion 1 and ion 2 is then accomplished. Finally, ion 1 transfers its energy to ion 2 to populate its level E1, creating a complete loop. The resulting effect of the looping process is that a single ion 2 in the metastable E1 state produces two ion 2s in this state. When the looping process follows, two ion 2s in the E1 state will produce four ions and a further four will produce eight ions, generating an avalanche effect for populating ion 2 in its E1 state, and thus the photo avalanche (PA) UC from the emitting level of E2. It is easy to recognize PA because it generally requires a pump threshold and a long time (in seconds) to build up. Furthermore, the dependence of the UC photoluminescence on the pump power becomes extremely strong around the threshold pumping power.45

1.2.3 Quantum cutter luminescence. 
Quantum cutting is a luminescence phenomenon where one absorbed photon is converted into two or more photons. This phenomenon is also known as quantum splitting or photon cascade emission. Moreover, as the energy of a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photon is more than twice that of a visible photon, it is theoretically possible to achieve two visible photon emissions for every incident photon.75 The quantum cutting materials have a quantum efficiency of more than 100% that provides new directions for the development of solid state lighting, advanced display systems, strong security applications, etc.76 The quantum cutting phenomenon was theoretically predicted by Dexter.77 There are three possible mechanisms for the quantum cutting process: (a) quantum cutting using host lattice states, (b) quantum cutting on single ions and (c) quantum cutting on ion pairs.
The process (a) involves the absorption of photons with energy at least twice the band gap of the host materials. Briefly, this excited electron–hole pair generates two electron–hole pairs, each with energy approximately equal to the band-gap energy, via the Auger interaction.78 Process (b) requires the well-separated energy levels of ions or atoms that can be used to generate more than one visible photon out of one UV photon. In this mechanism, two conditions that must be fulfilled are: (i) the energy gap between the adjacent levels must be large enough to prevent multi-phonon relaxation and (ii) the branching ratio of visible emission must be high.75 There are a number of reports available which described in detail the quantum cutting process using single ions. Sommerdijk et al. first observed the quantum cutting effect in Pr3+-doped YF3.79,80 The quantum cutting phenomenon was also observed in many oxide host lattices using the Pr3+ ion as the dopant.81–83 The Pr3+ ion doped fluorides and several oxides have been widely explored for quantum cutting with single ion doping due to the energy position of the 4f–5d states with respect to the 1S0 state and the suitably large 4f–5d energy separation.75 The energy level scheme of Pr3+ favouring quantum cutting (QC) by cascade emission is shown in Fig. 5. However, the quantum cutting phenomenon in other RE ions such as Tm3+, Gd3+ and Er3+ ions is also reported in the literature.84–88
 Fig. 5  Energy level diagram of Pr3+ ions that shows the concept of the quantum cutting phenomenon with VUV excitation.75 Reproduced with permission from ref. 75, Copyright 2009, Elsevier. 
In recent years, quantum cutting on ion pairs (two or three ions) has gained much attention compared to other quantum cutters. In process (c), one of the ions in the pair has the ability to show the quantum cutting phenomenon by interaction with the other ion in the pair and a part of the energy is transferred to this later ion as shown in Fig. 6. There are also many reports available that show the quantum cutting phenomenon using ion pairs.78 The energy level scheme for the ion pair based quantum cutter phenomenon for NaLaF4:Pr3+,Yb3+ phosphors is shown in Fig. 6.89

1.3 Luminescent quantum dots
Quantum dots are defined as spherical nanoparticles having physical dimensions smaller than the exciton Bohr radius confining its excitons in all three spatial directions.90–92 Quantum dots have gained tremendous attention in research due to a number of distinguishing properties such as (i) high quantum yield (QY) and a long fluorescence lifetime,93–95 (ii) simultaneous excitation of multiple QDs by using a single light source,96 (iii) narrow, symmetrical97 and (iv) broad spectral windows spanning from the ultraviolet to infrared region.98 An electron–hole pair is generated when the quantum dots are photo excited with a particular wavelength and their recombination causes the emission of light. Particularly, an exciton is an electrostatically bound electron–hole pair and is generated in the semiconductor as a result of excitation of an electron from the valence band to conduction band upon the absorption of a photon with energy equal to or greater than the band gap. Conceptually, the exciton Bohr radius represents the average distance between the photogenerated electrons and holes. When the size of the particle approaches that of the exciton (for example, the exciton Bohr radius for CdSe is about 6 nm), the optical and electrical properties of the material become dependent on its physical dimensions, due to quantum confinement effects.99 Under these conditions, the band structure of the semiconductor changes into discrete energy levels as shown in Fig. 7 and the energy difference between the highest occupied level and the lowest unoccupied level widens as the particle size decreases. Furthermore, the quantum confinement is also described by a simple model particles in box approximation in which the electron motion is restricted in all three dimensions by impenetrable walls. Klimov suggested a model for semiconductor based spherical QD with radius R, which predicts that a size dependent contribution to the energy gap is simply proportional to 1/R2, implying that the gap increases as the QD size decreases. Moreover, because of the quantum confinement the continuous energy bands of a bulk material split into discrete, atom like energy levels that result in the discrete absorption spectrum of QDs. This discrete absorption spectrum of QDs is entirely different from the continuous absorption spectrum of a bulk semiconductor as shown in Fig. 8.100 In other words, the smaller the particle size the greater is the blue shift in their luminescence as shown in Fig. 9.

 Fig. 8  (a) A bulk semiconductor such as CdSe has continuous conduction and valence energy bands separated by a “fixed” energy gap, Eg(bulk). Electrons normally occupy all states up to the edge of the valence band, whereas states in the conduction band are empty. (b) A QD is characterized by discrete atom-like states with energies that are determined by the QD radius R. These well-separated QD states can be labeled with atom-like notations, such as 1S, 1P, and 1D. (c) The expression for the size dependence separation between the lowest electron and hole QD states—Eg(QD), the QD energy gap—was obtained with the spherical “quantum box” model.

Therefore, the electronic and optical properties of quantum dots depend upon their size due to the quantum effect. Hence, quantum dots with different sizes exhibit different fluorescence colors. Fig. 10 shows the change in the emission of quantum dots with change in their size and the range of emission wavelengths of semiconductor quantum dots.98 There are extensive studies on II–VI (e.g. CdSe, CdTe, CdS, ZnSe), III–V (e.g. InP, InAs), and IV–VI (e.g. PbSe) groups and their alloys with a confined size on the nanoscale for various applications published in the literature. Every quantum dot has its own limits for the tuning of the emission color with respect to its size which is shown in Fig. 10. There are several reports available which elaborate the relationship between the size, shape and electronic properties of QDs.101

Recently, another kind of quantum dot derived from carbon which is known as carbon quantum dots (CQD) or carbon dots (CD), including the popular graphene quantum dots (GQDs), has been investigated immensely.92,102–105 Unlike the semiconductor quantum dots with band gap absorptions, carbon quantum dots have broad optical absorption due to a π-plasmon that covers a broad UV/vis spectral range, extending into the near-IR. The photoluminescence emissions of these quantum dots are associated with defects related to the structure and surface or edge sites.92,106 The carbon quantum dots were first reported by Xu et al. in 2004.107 However, Sun et al. coined the term ‘carbon quantum dots’ for fluorescent carbon nanoparticles in 2006.108
The fluorescence emission mechanism of GQDs/CQDs can be explained in two ways: (i) fluorescence emission due to bandgap transitions caused by conjugated π-domains and (ii) fluorescence emission origins associated with surface defects in GQDs. In the first mechanism, the bandgap transitions originate from conjugated π-domains. These π-domains are sequestered by generating sp2 hybridised islands rich in π-electrons through the reduction of graphene oxides.110,111 GQDs are synthesized in a way that there are no π-connections between the sp2 islands in the graphitic lattice, because any π-connections between the sp2 islands would lead to interisland quenching of the desired fluorescence emissions.112,113
For such kinds of bandgap transitions, single-layer graphene sheets have to be used to prevent interlayer quenching between the two layers.114 The single-layer graphene sheets are used as precursors for electronically slicing them into isolated π-conjugated domains, which is similar to large aromatic molecules with extended π-conjugation of the specific electronic energy bandgap for optical absorption and fluorescence emissions in GQDs.115 Such electronic transitions show strong absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) region, but weak or no fluorescence emissions as shown in Fig. 11a. Hence, strong absorption is possible due to light absorption by a large amount of high density π-electrons in the sp2 hybridized islands, which form excitonic states while the weak emissions are probably a result of quenching via radiationless relaxations to the ground state during exciton migration to energy traps.109 The second class of the fluorescence mechanism originates from surface-related defect sites. Generally, such surface sites have non-perfect sp2 domains that act as surface energy traps. Both sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbon atoms and other functionalised surface defects116,117 like carbonyl-related localised electronic states114–118 present in CQDs/GQDs contribute to their multicolour emissions that are intense in the blue and green regions of the visible light spectrum. These surface defects behave like aromatic molecules that are individually incorporated into solid hosts that exhibit multicolour emissions due to the existence of multiple surface defects with different excitation and emission properties.106–115 Robertson and O'Reilly suggested that the optical properties of carbon nanomaterials which contain both sp2 and sp3 bonds are determined by the π-states of the sp2 sites.119 Therefore, the bright surface defect-derived fluorescence of CQDs/GQDs is due to the recombination of electron–hole pairs in the strongly localized π and π* electronic levels of the sp2 sites. These sites lie between the bandgap of the σ and σ* states of the sp3 matrix,120,121 which leads to strong visible emissions. Such electronic transitions exhibit weak absorption in the near ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) region and strong emissions in the visible region as shown in Fig. 11b. Moreover, upon surface passivation or functionalization, the surface defects become more stable to facilitate more effective radiative recombination of surface-confined electrons and holes, hence achieving brighter fluorescence emissions.115 Similar to semiconductor quantum dots, the emission spectra of CQDs/GQDs can also be tuned without any surface modification. But, due to the low stability of defects, the quantum yield of CQDs/GQDs is very low. Therefore, the surface modification of these quantum dots with polymers leads to stable defects and strong emission. The emission colour of CQDs can be tuned by surface modification (passivation) as shown in Fig. 12.

1.4 Luminescent nanoscale metal–organic frameworks
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new class of inorganic–organic hybrid materials synthesized from metal ions or metal clusters and organic ligands.122–126 Metal–organic-frameworks are also known as coordination polymers (CPs) or coordination networks. Because metal–organic frameworks have both inorganic and organic components, these materials are very promising as multifunctional materials. Based on the geometries of the organic ligands/linkers and coordination modes of the inorganic metal ions or clusters of metal ions, their structures can be designed according to the desired properties.124,127–129 As a consequence, they show promise for an impressive number of applications in luminescent barcode security, gas storage, drug delivery, diagnostics, sensing, catalysis, ion exchange or separation, magnetism, optics, etc.130–136 However, metal–organic materials in the form of traditional bulk crystalline materials do not always fulfil all the specific needs for these applications. Depending upon the desired application, these materials are required not only to be fabricated as bulk crystalline solids, but also to be miniaturized on the nanometre length scale and immobilized at specific locations on surfaces.136 For example, in order to fabricate luminescent security inks, nanoscale MOFs are more suitable because it is easier to disperse them uniformly with high stability into the ink medium compared to bulk MOFs. In the above applications, the additional advantage of nanoscale MOFs is that they have higher surface areas than their macroscopic counterparts thereby reducing the amount of luminescent MOFs required for ink fabrication. A similar situation occurs with some of their physical properties. It is well known that unique physical properties emerge prominently when at least one dimension of a material is reduced to the nanometre scale. Thus, nanoscale metal–organic materials are also expected to show highly desirable size-dependent optical, electrical and magnetic properties.136 The MOFs show tuneable luminescence behaviour covering a wide range of the spectrum from UV to NIR. In MOFs, both organic ligands and inorganic metal ions or clusters can provide a platform to produce luminescence. Furthermore, luminescence due to charge transfer between the metal ion and the ligand is also observed in MOFs. Moreover, introduction of guest molecules or ions can also induce luminescence.137 A summary of luminescent MOFs is shown in Table 3.

In recent years, the studies on luminescent MOFs have been mainly focused on investigating the fundamental synthesis, the mechanism of luminescence, upconverting MOFs and emerging luminescence properties of MOFs with better tenability for luminescent security applications as well as in light-emitting and display devices. In addition to this, the permanent porosity of some luminescent MOFs has enabled their reversible storage with the release of guest substrates and provided the hosts for their differential recognitions with sensing species.137,138Fig. 13 clearly depicts the various modes of luminescence generation as explained below:

1.4.1 Linker/ligand based luminescence in MOFs. 
In this process of luminescence generation, the incident radiation is absorbed by typically conjugated organic compounds known as linkers. After that, the linkers transfer the charge with coordinated metal ions or clusters. But in some cases the direct emission from the organic linkers is also possible. A schematic diagram of this photo-physical process is shown in Fig. 14. The fluorescence emission in the organic molecule (linker/ligand) is due to radiative decay from the singlet state S1 to the ground singlet state S0. The phosphorescence in the organic molecule (linker/ligand) is due to the radiative transition from the triplet state T1 to S0 and this emission has a lifetime in the range of several microseconds to seconds.137

The MOFs with π-conjugated organic ligands or linkers show ligand based luminescence. Various types of organic linkers can be used for MOF synthesis like rigid backbones substituted with di- or multi-carboxylate groups for metal coordination.137,138 Generally, the fluorescence emission from organic ligands is due to the transition from the lowest excited singlet state to the singlet ground state i.e. transitions are π → π* or n → π*.
Moreover, other organic linkers/ligands play a key role in stabilizing the MOFs. Therefore, the non-radiative decay rate emission is reduced; as a result there is an increase in luminescence intensity, quantum yield and lifetime. Furthermore, the solid state, molecular interactions bring the molecules close together, which enables charge transfer among the organic ligands/linkers, resulting in a shift of spectra, broadening of the emission and loss of fine structure. In addition, the size and nature of metal ions, the orientation and arrangement of linkers and the coordination environment within the MOF can significantly affect the fluorescence properties of the organic linkers because these factors will induce their different intramolecular or intermolecular interactions among organic linkers.137,138


1.4.2 Lanthanide based luminescence in MOFs. 
Lanthanide metal ion based luminescence is associated with lanthanide complexes and rare earth metals that are sensitized by a ligand-to-metal charge transfer-type process. All Ln3+ ions except for La3+ and Lu3+ may generate luminescent f–f emissions from a broad range covering UV to NIR.139,140 Eu3+, Tb3+, Sm3+ and Tm3+ emit red, green, orange and blue colour, respectively, while Yb3+, Nd3+, and Er3+ demonstrate well established NIR emissions. The transition metals emit intense and sharp emission bands originating from f–f transitions. However, lanthanide ions have weak absorption due to the forbidden f–f transitions. This problem may be overcome by coupling them with the species that can absorb and transfer energy, known as sensitization or can create the antenna effect.139,140 The antenna effect occurs in three steps: (i) absorption of photon energy by organic ligands, present around the lanthanide ions, (ii) transfer of absorbed energy from the organic ligand to lanthanide ions and (iii) emission from the lanthanide ions as shown Fig. 14. The antenna effect is also observed in MOFs containing actinide metal ions.141


1.4.3 Charge transfer luminescence in MOFs. 
In this process, luminescence is generated by an allowed transition from the charge-transfer excited state to the ground state. There are two types of charge transfer in MOFs: (i) ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) and (ii) metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). LMCT involves the electronic transition from an organic linker-localized orbital to a metal-centered orbital, while MLCT corresponds to the electronic transition from a metal-centered orbital to an organic linker-localized orbital. Basically, the charge transfer luminescence is observed in d10 metal based MOFs such as MOFCu3(C7H2NO5)2·33H2O (C7H2NO5 = 4-hydroxypyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate), which exhibits blue emission peaking at 398 and 478 nm upon excitation at 333 nm, whereas CuAg2(C7H2NO5)2 and the free organic linker 4-hydroxypyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid exhibit green emission at 515 and 526 nm upon excitation at 358 and 365 nm.142 However, in some cases LMCT or MLCT luminescence and ligand based luminescence may exist together. For example in the case of the zinc MOF Zn2(ATA)3(ATA)2/2, there is a weak blue emission at 485 nm with excitation at 320 nm while a strong luminescence at 392 nm is generated for ligand-based emission.143


1.4.4 Guest-induced luminescence in MOFs. 
Most of the MOFs have a porous structure and the pore size could be in the range of several angstroms to several nanometers. Because of this porosity, the MOFs can act as the host lattice for organic molecules, fluorescent dyes and lanthanides ions. For example, a series of lanthanide MOFs Ln3+@bio-MOF-1 (Ln3+ = Tb3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, or Yb3+) was synthesized by An et al. using the MOF bio-MOF-1. The lanthanide doped MOFs show different colours depending upon the doping ion under excitation at 365 nm as shown in Fig. 15.144

1.5 Plasmonic nanomaterials
A plasmon is defined as the quantum of coherent oscillations of conduction electrons in metals in response to incident light. These oscillations can strongly be restricted to a metal–dielectric interface (surface plasmons). Such collective oscillation of conduction electrons is also known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Conceptually, the localized surface plasmon is observed in metal particles whose size is smaller than the wavelength of incident light.145–148 When the metal nanoparticle interacts with incident light, the electron cloud (free electron cloud) undergoes a displacement from its original position relative to nuclei. As a result restoring forces arise due to the Coulomb interaction between the electrons and nuclei that results in collective oscillations of the electron cloud relative to nuclei. The oscillation frequency is determined by four factors: the density of electrons, the effective electron mass, the shape and the size of the charge distribution. The schematic for these plasmonic oscillations for a spherical particle is illustrated in Fig. 16.149
 Fig. 16  Schematic of plasmon oscillation for a sphere, showing the displacement of the conduction electron charge cloud relative to the nuclei.149 Reproduced with permission from ref. 149, Copyright 2003, American Chemical Society. 
In other words, plasmonic nanomaterials are particles whose electron density can be coupled with electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths which are far larger than the particle itself due to the nature of the dielectric–metal interface between the medium and the particles; unlike in a pure metal where there is a maximum limit on the wavelength that can be effectively coupled based on the material size.150 Furthermore, plasmonic nanostructures have exceptional properties such as large electromagnetic field enhancements, high photothermal conversion efficiencies, and rich spectral responses. Therefore, plasmonic nanostructures are a versatile class of nanomaterials which have enormous potential for a variety of applications.151–158 Thus, a new research field has emerged, which is known as ‘nanoplasmonics’ and that has received worldwide attention from the vast scientific community including chemistry, materials, optics, engineering, and biomedicine. A summary of the various subfields within nanoplasmonics is schematically indicated in Fig. 17. Although the noble metals gold and silver are most commonly used for studies as plasmonic nanomaterials, nowadays plasmonic nanostructures also include copper, aluminum, highly doped oxides and chalcogenides and graphene. The plasmon tuning range of aluminium is higher compared to gold and silver as shown in Fig. 18a. However, most of the investigations have been reported on the plasmonic behavior of noble metals due to their visible–near infrared tunable plasmon, high chemical stability and a large number of chemical methods for their synthesis with controlled size and shape.

It is interesting to note that the optical properties of metallic nanoparticles change slightly with the increase in size as observed for different samples of gold nanospheres as shown in Fig. 18b. However, when anisotropy is added to the nanoparticles, such as due to the growth of nanorods, the optical properties of the nanoparticles change significantly.
After brief discussions on the fundamental concepts on various kinds of luminescent nanomaterials (lanthanide based, quantum dots, MOFs and plasmonic nano materials) and their mechanisms for producing luminescence, we have described in detail the different methodologies to synthesize these luminescent nanomaterials and their characterization in the following sections:
2. Methodology for synthesis and characterization of luminescent nanomaterials
2.1 Lanthanide doped luminescent nanomaterials
The luminescent properties of lanthanide nanomaterials are highly dependent on their structure, size, shape, host lattice etc. as reported in the literature. Therefore, the method of synthesis of luminescent nanomaterials plays a seminal role in determining their desired optical properties. In the past few decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to develop different facile strategies for the synthesis of luminescent nanomaterials with tuneable size, shape and morphology. However, soft chemical routes widely used for the synthesis of luminescent nanomaterials have several advantages over conventional methods such as solid state reactions in terms of the following aspects: (i) soft chemical routes are easy and effective ways to introduce ligands on the surface of products for preventing them from agglomerating when they are dispersed in polar or non-polar solvents. (ii) The shape and size of nanoparticles can be altered by synthesis conditions such as raw materials, acidity, solvent, concentration, additive, temperature and reaction time. (iii) Soft chemical routes provide synthesis of luminescent nanoparticles on a large scale at low temperatures using simple apparatus at an economical cost. For these notable reasons soft chemical routes have been adapted as the most favourable and versatile method for shape controlled synthesis of luminescent nanomaterials. In this section, we explored the different chemical methods for synthesis of lanthanide doped luminescent nanomaterials and their characterization with different techniques.34 Various kinds of soft chemical methods are discussed below:

2.1.1 Hydrothermal/solvothermal method. 
The solvothermal method has been widely used for the synthesis of luminescent nanoparticles. In brief, solvothermal synthesis is based on high pressure and mild temperature reactions between solids in liquid precursors. Normally, it is carried out in a Teflon-lined autoclave, which consists of an inner Teflon liner, an outer stainless steel shell and a cap. When heated to a certain temperature, reactants and solvents sealed in the autoclave are subjected to a high pressure environment, which can increase the solubility and reactivity of almost all solid reactants.34 Consequently, the solvothermal method aids in increasing the rate of reactions which cannot occur or hardly occur under atmospheric pressure conditions. Furthermore, the reaction temperature is often above the critical point of the solvent, whereas the temperature of the usual solvent based routes is restricted by its boiling point. These favourable features make the solvothermal method highly suitable and efficient for designing and preparing high-quality nanoparticles. Hence, various types of precursors and solvents can be used for nanoparticle synthesis except for the ones that can decompose and release a vast amount of gas that may cause an explosion. Normally, the solvothermal system used for preparing rare-earth (RE) materials consists of a precursor, solvent, and organic additive. The RE precursors are usually simple nitrates or chlorides. HF, NH4F, NaF, and NaBF4 are the commonly used fluoride sources. Na3PO4/(NH4)2HPO4/(NH4)H2PO4, Na3VO4/(NH4)3VO4, Na2MoO4/(NH4)2MoO4, Na2WO4, and HBO3 are good reactants to provide acid radical ions for the formation of RE phosphate, vanadate, molybdate, tungstate, and borate, respectively. The solvent mainly includes water, ethanol, and ethylene glycol (EG). The physicochemical properties of the solvent can significantly influence the reactivity, solubility and diffusion behaviour of the reagents and different solvents can influence and control their morphology and size. For instance, ethanol, with low RE3+ and F− solubility, and EG, with high viscosity and tuneable diffusion rate of ions, both have been proved to be effective solvents to slow down the nucleation and growth rate of nanoparticles.34 Water is a clean and green solvent for chemical synthesis and when it is used as a solvent in solvothermal synthesis, the popular hydrothermal method is achieved.
Hydrothermal synthesis provides a number of other desirable advantages such as low cost, nontoxic solvent and potential for high yield production. However, using water as the solvent is avoided due to its boiling point (100 °C) limitations. Besides, a large number of reports have demonstrated that, in the solvothermal method, the most efficient and straightforward strategy for fine-tuning the shape and size of a targeted material is to introduce organic additives, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic ones. On one hand, the coordination effect between the hydrophilic ligands and metal ions will affect the actual concentration of free ions, thereby influencing the concentration of the monomer and growth kinetics, on the other hand, the selective adsorption of ligands on different surfaces of crystallites favours a controlled morphology. The organic surfactants/additives such as oleic acid (OA), polyethylenimine (PEI), EDTA, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) are used to control the size and shape as well as the surface modification of nanomaterials.31,160–164 Additionally, the pH value of the final precursor solution is an important parameter in the hydrothermal process. The crystalline phase of the morphology of nanomaterials is highly dependent on the pH value. J. Sun and co-workers have demonstrated that the morphology of nanophosphors depends upon the pH value of the solution as shown in Fig. 19.165

2.1.1.1 Characterization of hydrothermally/solvothermally synthesized nanomaterials. 
The structure, surface morphology and microstructural characterization of hydrothermally/solvothermally synthesized nanomaterials are shown in Fig. 20. It is clearly evident from Fig. 20 that highly crystalline nanomaterials of various morphologies can be synthesized by the hydrothermal or solvothermal method.

2.1.2 Sol–gel method. 
The sol–gel is a well- known method for the synthesis of lanthanide based nanomaterials which basically involves the conversion of solutions into a colloidal sol and then the colloidal sol to a gel. Further heating at high temperatures is essential to accomplish the formation of pure phase multi-component nanoparticles with high crystallinity. Important steps involved in the sol–gel process are hydrolysis, condensation, gelation, ageing, drying and densification.168–170 The synthesis of lanthanide nanomaterials using an emulsion based sol–gel process termed sol–emulsion–gel is also reported by P. N. Prasad's group.171,172 The schematic for sol–gel methods is demonstrated in Fig. 21.
 Fig. 21  Basic principle of Pechini-type sol–gel for the synthesis of phosphor.168 Reproduced with permission from ref. 168, Copyright 2007, American Chemical Society. 
In this method, initially, metal precursors such as metal nitrates, metal chlorides, acetates, etc. are dissolved in aqueous solutions, thereafter the chelating agent such as citric acid or salicylic acid is used to form stable metal complexes. Furthermore, a polyhydroxy alcohol such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or ethylene glycol (EG) is used as a cross-linking agent to form a homogeneous polymeric resin at the molecular scale. The polymeric resin gel reduces the segregation of particular metal ions and confirms the homogeneity of the composition. Furthermore, the gel is sintered at high temperatures to eradicate the organic additives and form the final product with pure phase and good crystallinity.173
2.1.2.1 Characterization of sol–gel synthesized nanomaterials. 
The structure, surface morphology and microstructural characterization of the sol–gel synthesized nanomaterials are shown in Fig. 22. It can easily be seen from Fig. 22 that the synthesized nanomaterials are of high crystallinity.

2.1.3 Thermal decomposition method. 
Thermal decomposition is another method which is widely used for the synthesis of luminescent nanomaterials. The process involves the decomposition of organometallic compounds taken as precursors which decompose at an elevated temperature in high boiling point organic solvents. The organic precursors used in thermal decomposition are usually organic acid salts of rare earths such as trifluoroacetate, oleate, acetylacetonate, acetate etc. Commonly used organic solvents are oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OM), tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and 1-octadecene (ODE). However, 1-octadecene (ODE) is most commonly used as a solvent in thermal decomposition due to its high boiling point (315 °C). Besides the above, surfactants are also used in the thermal decomposition method. The surfactant caps the surface of nanoparticles which make them highly dispersive in organic solvents and also prevents the aggregation of nanoparticles. In addition to this, the surfactant also plays another important role in controlling the growth of nanoparticles. Oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OM) containing organic groups and a long chain of hydrocarbons act both as an organic solvent and as a surfactant.31,34 It is reported that high-quality nanomaterials with a narrow size distribution, good crystallinity and exceptional optical properties can be synthesized by carefully optimizing the variables such as the nature of the solvents, the concentration of metal precursors, reaction temperature and reaction time.31 In recent years many efforts have been made to study the effect of experimental conditions such as the concentration of precursors, the choice of solvent, the choice of surfactant, reaction temperature and reaction time on the size distribution, crystallinity and optical properties of nanomaterials. Yan et al. successfully synthesised the triangular nanoplates of LaF3 by thermal decomposition using metal trifluoroacetate (La(CF3COO)3) as the precursor, oleic acid as the surfactant and octadecene as the solvent.178 There are many other reports on the synthesis of lanthanide doped nanomaterials using thermal decomposition with different host lattices such as LiYF4, NaYF4, NaGdF4, NaLuF4, BaYF5, KY3F10, BaGdF5, CaF2, SrF2, BaF2, YOF, LuOF, LaOF, and GdOF.178–205
2.1.3.1 Characterization of thermal decomposition synthesized nanomaterials.

2.1.4 Coprecipitation method. 
The coprecipitation method is one of the oldest and most useful method for the synthesis of lanthanide based nanomaterials. The coprecipitation method has several advantages over the thermal decomposition method such as mild reaction conditions, a low cost set-up, a simple protocol and a short reaction time. Van et al. synthesized rare earth doped LaF4:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Eu, Er, Nd and Ho) nanoparticles using the coprecipitation method.206 Ammonium di-n-octadecyldithiophosphate was used as a surfactant which controls the growth of nanoparticles, prevents nanoparticles from agglomerate and also provides stability in organic solvents. Furthermore, Yi and co-workers implemented this method for the synthesis of NaYF4:Yb/Er nanoparticles using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).207 In their study, the size of nanoparticles was varied from 37 nm to 166 nm by tailoring the molar ratio of the EDTA and Ln3+ ion. Zhang et al. synthesized rare earth doped hexagonal NaYF4:Yb/Er (or Tm) nanoparticles using OA as the capping agent and ODE as the solvent.208
There are many other reports on the synthesis of lanthanide based nanomaterials with different host lattices such as Ln3+-doped LiYF4, NaYF4, NaGdF4, NaTbF4, NaLuF4, KGdF4, NaScF4,CaF2, and LaF3.209–221 However, the size and shape of the nanomaterials synthesized by this method can be controlled by tailoring the reaction conditions. But, these nanomaterials exhibit a weak luminescence intensity that can be enhanced by sintering at high temperatures which carbonises the capping agent and reduces the hydrophilicity of nanoparticles. Consequently, some suitable surface modifications are further needed prior to using these nanoparticles for luminescent security ink application. Nevertheless, the coprecipitation method has important industrial applications due to its low cost, high yield, environmental benignancy and synthetic suitability.

2.2 Synthesis of quantum dots (QDs)
The synthesis of quantum dots has gained immense interest worldwide due to their wide range of applications. Several methods are reported in the literature that can be employed for the synthesis of quantum dots. However, the reproducibility with controlled size and band gap engineering of QDs is also an interesting and challenging topic of research. The various methods for the synthesis of QDs can be classified into two categories – “top-down” and “bottom-up”.222–224

2.2.1 Synthesis of semiconductor quantum dots (SQDs). 
The top-down technique involves the breaking of the bulk/large structure into small structures with dimensions in the nanometer range. In the case of semiconductor quantum dots, top-down techniques include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), reactive ion etching (RIE), ion implantation, e-beam lithography and X-ray lithography techniques for the synthesis of QDs. Scherer and co-workers fabricated QDs using the reactive ion etching technique.225 In their study, the synthesis of QDs with a size ∼40 nm was reported. Tsutsui et al. also fabricated ZnTe quantum dots in a mixture of CH4 and H2 using the reactive ion etching technique.226 Bottom-up is another technique, where the fundamental building blocks such as molecules or atoms interact with each other and form nanostructures. There are several bottom-up techniques for the synthesis of QDs that can be divided into two types: wet chemical methods and vapour phase methods.222 The wet chemical methods include microemulsion, sol–gel, competitive reaction chemistry, hot-solution decomposition and electrochemistry, while the vapour phase methods include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), sputtering, liquid metal ion sources and aggregation of gaseous monomers. However, most of the luminescent semiconductor QDs are synthesized by using wet chemical methods. In wet chemical methods, the size of quantum dots can be controlled by optimizing the growth parameters. Qu et al. synthesized CdSe QDs having sizes in the range of 6–9 nm using the wet chemical method.227 Murray and co-workers synthesized high-quality CdE (E = S, Se, Te) semiconductor QDs using a process based on the pyrolysis of organometallic reagents assisted by their injection into a hot coordinating solvent.228 In another interesting report, Qu and co-workers synthesized high quality CdSe nanocrystals in a very broad size range from ∼1.5 nm to above 25 nm using different wet chemical routes.229 Li et al. synthesized CdTe nanocrystals in the aqueous phase by microwave irradiation with controllable temperature.230 In general, MBE has been mainly used to self-assemble QDs from III–V and II–VI semiconductors. Xin and co-workers synthesized CdSe QDs having diameters of 40 ± 5 nm using the MBE technique.231 Furthermore, Liu and co-workers reported the synthesis of CdSe SQDs using commercial diesel as the reaction solvent and oleic acid as the ligand.232 The wet chemical methods have important advantages in that the size and shape of QDs can be controlled by simply varying the factors like temperature, electrostatic double layer thickness, stabilizers or micelle formation, concentrations of precursors, ratios of anionic to cationic species and solvent.


2.2.2 Synthesis of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). 
Top-down methods involve the breaking down of the larger carbon structures like nanodiamonds, graphite, carbon nanotubes, carbon soot, activated carbon, graphite oxide and reduced graphene oxide.233–237 The most common methods like arc discharge, laser ablation and electrochemical oxidation are used to break down the large carbon lattice. Xu and co-workers reported the synthesis of fluorescent CQDs from carbon soot in 2004.107 Sun et al. synthesized CQDs by laser ablation of a carbon target in the presence of water vapors with argon as the carrier gas.108 The fluorescence was not detected in the as-synthesized sample. Consequently, to make the sample fluorescent, the as-synthesized sample was further treated with an acid for oxidation followed by surface passivation. The electrochemical synthesis of CQDs was reported by Zhou et al.234 They performed electrochemical synthesis in an electrochemical cell containing degassed acetonitrile solution with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown MWCNTs on a carbon paper were also inserted into the cell. The electrochemical process converts MWCNTs into highly efficient luminescent CQDs, which can easily be dispersed in various solvents. In another report, Ming et al. reported the electrochemical synthesis of CQDs using graphite as the carbon source which decreases the cost of precursor materials and increases the scale of production.238a Furthermore, J. M. Tour's group has reported a facile approach for large scale synthesis of GQDs at an economical cost from various types of coal.238b The bottom-up techniques involve the synthesis of CQDs from molecular precursors such as citrate, carbohydrates and polymer–silica nanocomposites.109,239–241 Usually, combustion/thermal treatments and supported synthetic and microwave synthetic methods are used for the synthesis of CQDs in the bottom-up approach. Liu and co-workers reported the synthesis of CQDs based on the use of modified silica spheres as carriers and resols as carbon precursors.242 Bourlinos et al. reported the synthesis of CQDs by the thermal decomposition method using ammonium citrate salts or 4-aminoantipyrine as precursors.239 In an interesting report, Zhu and co-workers synthesised CQDs from a solution of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and saccharide by heating in a 500 W microwave oven.243 However, cost is one of the major parameters for the large scale production of CQDs. In recent years, a large number of efforts have been devoted to develop green synthesis of CQDs. Furthermore, Li and co-workers reported the synthesis of fluorescent CQDs by using a simple and green route. They synthesized the fluorescent CQDs from ethanol by a one-step sodium hydroxide-assisted electrochemical process.244 The synthesized CQDs have high water solubility, better stability and good sensitivity to pH. Furthermore, there are many reports available on the synthesis of fluorescent CQDs using inexpensive and biocompatible precursors such as ethanol, citrate, glucosamine, ascorbic acid, saccharides, candle soot, orange juice, strawberry juice, sugar cane juice, chicken eggs, chitosan, organogel and gelatin.245–261

2.3 Metal–organic-frameworks (MOFs)
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are the most attractive, fascinating and novel class of porous nanomaterials. Their miniaturization into the nano MOFs is expected to serve myriad applications.262 Consequently, enormous efforts have been devoted to synthesize MOFs by different methods. Extensive reports have been published to date regarding the synthesis of MOFs.263,264 In the past few years, a number of methods have been adopted for the synthesis of MOFs having various crystal sizes or shapes depending upon their suitability for further applications. The various methods for the synthesis of MOFs are summarized in Fig. 26. Different strategies have been adopted for the synthesis of luminescent nanoscale MOFs. Generally, in the simple diffusion technique, the solution containing metal salts is slowly diffused into the organic linker. This method is tedious and time consuming with low yield. Hydrothermal syntheses of MOFs have been feasible for those reaction systems in which organic linkers may be partially soluble in water at a high temperature. However, there are many other methods reported for the synthesis of MOFs such as mechanochemical solid-state grinding and liquid-assisted grinding, emulsions or template based synthesis, sonochemical, microwave-assisted and spray-drying synthesis.263,264 Lu and his team synthesized lanthanide based nanoscale luminescent MOFs (MOF-253).265 They synthesized lanthanide ion (Eu, Tb and Sm) containing MOF-253 which emits in the visible range. The emission intensity of MOFs is directly proportional to the amount of lanthanide ions in MOFs. The emission colour of nanoMOFs was also tailored by varying the ratio of Eu/Tb. In another interesting report Carne-Sanchez et al. synthesized nanoMOFs using the spray-drying method. This spray-drying method facilitates the construction of multi-component MOF superstructures and the encapsulation of guest species within these superstructures.262 The spray-drying method is a versatile method and by using this method the nanoMOFs can be prepared easily and rapidly with controlled size and shape as shown in Fig. 27.262

2.3.1 Characterization of MOFs. 
A series of MOF superstructures and discrete nanoMOF crystals were synthesized by the spray-drying method and these MOFs are characterized by using XRD, SEM, and TEM techniques as shown in Fig. 27.

2.4 Synthesis of plasmonic nanomaterials
The noble metal (Au and Ag) nanoparticles usually exhibit size and shape dependent plasmonic properties. Plasmonic nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes can be synthesized by using four different routes:266–274

2.4.1 One-pot-one-step synthesis of plasmonic nanoparticles. 
This method is the easiest of all for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles. By using this method the morphology of nanoparticles (for example, stars, rods, plates, and prisms) can be controlled by changing the reaction conditions like temperature, solvent, additives, etc. The most commonly used reducing agent and capping agent for the nanoparticles is polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). It can potentially modify the nucleation, growth, and shape of nanoparticles because of its proficiency in interacting with metal ions and surfaces as well as preferable attachment to distinct crystal facets of certain metals (e.g., silver).272,275–280 Furthermore, the choice of solvent is also a very important factor for the synthesis of plasmonic nanoparticles. The nanoparticles can also be tuned to any desired shape by changing the solvent. Kedia and co-workers reported the effect of solvent on the synthesis of gold nanoparticles. They tuned the morphology of gold nanoparticles from spherical to star shaped by changing the solvent.281 This study reveals that apart from the capping agent, the interaction between the capping agent–solvent–metal ion also affects the final structure of nanoparticles. In another report, Angelomé et al. discussed the effect of temperature on the synthesis of plasmonic nanoparticles. In their study, they showed that the wavelength of LSPR in gold nanoparticles can be tuned from 600 nm to 1400 nm by simply varying the reaction temperature (between 30 and 10 °C) and the reagent concentration.282 Zhang et al. demonstrated the synthesis of silver nanoprisms using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The hydrogen peroxide facilitates the formation of planar-twinned defects which are a prerequisite for the formation of nanoprisms.283


2.4.2 Synthesis of plasmonic nanoparticles via seeded growth synthesis. 
This method includes two reaction steps. The first step reaction involves the formation of nuclei whereas, in the second reaction step, the seed formed in the first step is added to the growth solution. Furthermore, nanoparticles with different morphologies can be synthesized under different growth conditions. Langille et al. synthesized gold nanoparticles by the seeded growth method and in their report, they showed the effect of the halide ion on the growth of gold nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles with different shapes can be synthesized by kinetic control, surface passivation, or by a combination of both, either in the absence or presence of silver ions as shown in Fig. 28.284 Ye et al. synthesized gold nanorods having different aspect ratios by introducing aromatic additives into the well-established seed mediated synthesis method with better control on the monodispersity of gold nanorods.285

2.4.3 Synthesis of plasmonic nanoparticles via reshaping/etching synthesis. 
Reshaping of particles is indirectly used during many synthetic procedures. Post synthesis ageing and transformation of nanoparticles is often an undesirable process as it results in limiting the lifetime and usability of a specific particle type. But the mechanisms for these processes need to be understood in order to enhance their stability. In addition, it is also possible to deliberately use them in order to obtain novel nanostructures.272 Ng et al. demonstrated the reshaping of gold nanorods by a simple thermal route.286 The longitudinal plasmonic resonance of gold nanorods was tuned from 800 to 560 nm using reshaping of nanorods. The author synthesized gold nanorods with an aspect ratio of 3:3 and then heated these nanorods at various temperatures. In another study, Damm et al. studied the reshaping of silver by the ageing of aqueous suspensions of rods at 25 °C for different time-intervals.287 Furthermore, Min and his team proposed the combination of a top-down (etching) and a bottom-up (growth) technique for the synthesis of gold–platinum nanoparticles. Initially, platinum was deposited at different positions of gold nanospheres, cubes, and octahedra synthesized via the polyol process. Then, gold nanohexapods or empty platinum shells (depending on the initial structure) were obtained by etching the gold surface using cyanide solution.288


2.4.4 Template assisted synthesis of plasmonic nanoparticles. 
This method employs prefabricated structures (known as templates) to collect multiple, discrete nano-objects into a larger, well-defined, ordered architecture. The templated growth of nanomaterials is carried out via physical deposition of metal in a specific geometry or via chemically directing growth to occur at a specific location or crystallographic direction. The template based growth offers the fabrication of collective or discrete nano-objects into large, well defined and ordered structures.274 Bridges and his co-workers synthesized gold nanotubes of different thicknesses using anodized aluminum as the template via electrochemical synthesis.289 The morphology of the structure and the thickness of the core depend upon the nature of the solvent/electrolyte. The thickness of gold nanotubes was varied through the polymer core hydrophobicity. Nykypanchuk et al. reported the DNA-guided crystallization of colloidal nanoparticles.290


2.4.5 Characterization of plasmonic nanomaterials. 
The surface morphologies and microstructural characterization of gold and silver plasmonic nanoparticles synthesized by one-pot-one-step and via seeded growth methods are shown in Fig. 29.

After detailed discussions on different types of synthesis routes for various kinds of luminescent nanomaterials (lanthanide based, quantum dots, MOFs and plasmonic nanomaterials), we will thoroughly discuss the different methods for fabrication and design of security inks and strategies employed for various types of security code printing techniques in the following sections.

3. Fabrication and design of luminescent security inks
The fabrication and designing strategies of luminescent security inks play a key role for their commercial use in anti-counterfeiting applications. The major challenge in this area is to fabricate a luminescent ink having high stability, with availability of ink medium at low cost, good dispersion of luminescent nanomaterials in ink medium, high luminescence intensity of ink, convenience of printing and sticky nature of ink medium on different surfaces (viscosity around 3000 μP and good surface tension). Furthermore, it is also important to understand the chemistry of luminescent security ink formation (whether the ink is hydrophobic or hydrophilic in nature) prior to its potential use in printing of security codes/bars on different types of surfaces.
There are certain criteria to fabricate and design luminescent security inks with the desired properties as discussed below:
3.1 Choice of the luminescent ink medium
The appropriate choice of ink medium is an important aspect for the fabrication of luminescent inks in which the luminescent nanomaterials can be dispersed homogeneously and consequently form colloidal suspensions without forming any cluster or settling down at the bottom. Besides the above, the viscosity of the medium used for ink fabrication is also an important factor because it provides the essential sticky nature to the ink to make it suitable for printing on different types of surfaces. In addition to this, the boiling point of the medium used for ink fabrication is also a key factor. A volatile medium (such as toluene) exhibits the ‘coffee-ring effect’, which concentrates the medium along the rim of a drop as shown in Fig. 31a.294 Furthermore, the faster evaporation at the edges leads to flow of the ink medium towards the drop edge. This issue can be minimized by adding a solvent having a high boiling point. Blumenthal et al. have reported various solvents such as xylene, cyclohexanone and methyl benzoate for the minimization of the coffee-ring effect. They used methyl benzoate because of its ability to dissolve polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and it is easy to mix with toluene. In their study, they observed that toluene and methyl benzoate mixed together in a volume ratio of 90:10 eliminated the ‘coffee ring effect’ as shown in Fig. 31b.294 Apart from PMMA, many other media such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), aqueous solution of sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gold medium can be used for ink fabrication.12,15,294

3.2 Various types of luminescent ink formulation
This section briefly describes the formation of different types of luminescent security inks based on various types of luminescent nanomaterials such as lanthanide based luminescent nanomaterials (downconversion, upconversion and dual mode), luminescent quantum dots, luminescent MOFs and plasmonic nanomaterials as described below:

3.2.1 Lanthanide nanomaterial based luminescent security ink. 
In recent years the lanthanide based luminescent nanomaterials have gained huge attention due to their remarkable optical properties and wide range of applications in many potential areas such as luminescent security inks, optical displays, sensors, optoelectronics, laser cooling, bio-imaging, security applications etc. There are several potential advantages of using lanthanide based luminescent security inks for anti-counterfeiting applications compared to standard fluorescent inks, which normally produce visible emission when subjected to UV excitation. Furthermore, the lanthanide based luminescent inks exhibit both downconversion and upconversion processes in a single host lattice which makes them intrinsically more difficult to duplicate compared to the standard fluorescent dyes. Additionally, another advantage of lanthanide based inks over the commercially used fluorescent dyes is that the former have sharper transitions without photobleaching. Moreover, lanthanide based inks can be formulated to produce the correct color rendering index only under specific excitation power densities, making them even more difficult to duplicate the authentic read conditions.
This section of the review article will be mainly focused on the fabrication and design of lanthanide based luminescent security inks including downconversion/downshift, upconversion and dual-mode lanthanide based luminescent security inks.
3.2.1.1 Downconversion nanomaterial based luminescent security ink. 
In our earlier reports on luminescent security inks, we have demonstrated a strategy for the fabrication of downconversion security inks based on Y2O3:Eu3+ nanoparticles. Initially, sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) was dissolved in de-ionized (DI) water at a molar concentration of 5%. After that, 500 mg of Y2O3:Eu3+ nanoparticles were added to 30 ml of SHMP solution with continuous stirring for 15 min. Furthermore, 5 ml ethanol was added to the mixture and it was kept in an ultrasonic bath for about an hour. Finally, the capped nanoparticle particulates were collected using an ultracentrifuge. 0.2 mg cm−3 of this was re-dispersed in fresh DI water at room temperature to make an aqueous-stable and highly transparent luminescent ink.15
3.2.1.2 Upconversion nanomaterial based luminescent security ink. 
Blumental and co-workers suggested an approach to fabricate the upconversion security ink using toluene as the ink medium.295 2 wt% of upconversion nanoparticles of NaYF4:Er,Yb were dispersed in toluene and 1 wt% poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) was added to the dispersion along with enough methyl benzoate. Furthermore, direct-write and screen printing techniques were used to print with the fabricated ink. Meruga et al. also demonstrated a method for the fabrication of green and blue security inks based on upconversion nanoparticles of NaYF4:Er,Yb and NaYF4:Tm,Yb respectively for printing QR codes.11h For ink formation the upconversion nanophosphor and PMMA beads were added to a solution of 90:10 v:v toluene and methyl benzoate. Thereafter, the solution was vigorously stirred followed by sonication to form a uniform dispersion and complete dissolution of polymers and dispersion of nanoparticles. You and co-workers reported both hydrophobic and hydrophilic inks based on upconversion nanoparticles of β-NaYF4:Er,Yb.295 For fabricating a hydrophobic ink having an optimum viscosity and surface tension, upconversion nanoparticles were added to a solution containing cyclohexane and glycerol trioleate in a volume ratio of 90:10 to 70:30.295 While for a hydrophilic ink, upconversion nanoparticles were added to a solution containing ethanol (10%) and glycerol in a volume ratio of 85:15 to 65:35. Furthermore, to control the surface tension, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added to a hydrophilic ink at a concentration of 3 mg L−1.
3.2.1.3 Dual-mode luminescent nanomaterial based security ink. 
In our earlier report, we presented a strategy to fabricate an invisible dual mode security ink using a commercially available PVC gold medium. In the typical ink fabrication process, 200 mg of dual mode nanoparticles were dispersed in 50 ml of PVC gold medium and ultra-sonicated at 45 kHz to form a good dispersion. Furthermore, the fabricated ink was used successfully for printing different security codes and images by the screen printing technique.12


3.2.2 Quantum dot based luminescent security ink. 
Lu et al. reported a multicolor rewritable fluorescent system using branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI)-CdTe quantum dots.296 In a typical synthesis, 0.01 mM red emitting QDs, 1% BPEI solution and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) masks were used to reversibly write and erase fluorescent patterns on a glass slide. Initially, the slide was immersed in the BPEI solution followed by washing and drying. Then the PDMS mask having a designed pattern was placed on the substrate and exposed to a QD solution for selectively anchoring CdTe nanocrystals via electrostatic force to form a pattern with red emission, which was imaged under 460 nm irradiation. The fluorescent pattern was easily erased with a drop of BPEI solution to decompose the surface-attached layer of QDs. After washing and drying, the film was ready for the next writing.296


3.2.3 MOF based luminescent security ink. 
Luz et al. also demonstrated a strategy to fabricate MOF based luminescent inks for inkjet printing. In their study, they discussed about the aqueous solution based red, green and NIR-MOF inks.297 Basically in this process an aqueous solution of MOFs was dispersed in a color cartridge to print the security codes for anti-counterfeiting applications. In summary, Luz et al. have demonstrated a facile, low-cost, and time efficient strategy for the positioning of photoluminescent Ln-MOFs on flexible substrates (paper and plastic foils). Literature reports suggest that a small volume of ink allows for the quick drying of the ink solvent; furthermore, rapid crystal nucleation permits the production of patterned photoluminescent Ln-MOFs without the multiple “printing drying” cycles.297


3.2.4 Plasmonic nanomaterial based luminescent security ink. 
Campos-Cuerva et al. demonstrated a strategy to print metallic nanoparticles as authentication tags on different types of paper using the screen printing technique.298 The metal nanoparticle based ink was fabricated using water-based or oil-based varnishes. In order to accomplish this, 80 ml of water based or oil based varnish was added to gold (20 ml gold nanorods, 3.7 mg ml−1) or silver (20 ml of silver nanoparticles, 6.7 mg ml−1) suspensions in either water or acetone. Furthermore, a mesh with a specific design was used for screen printing.298

4. Various types of printing techniques
The three main techniques of printing objects, patterns and security codes for anti-counterfeiting are briefly described in the following sections:
4.1 Screen printing techniques
Screen printing is a printing technique whereby ink is transferred onto a substrate using a mesh except in areas made impermeable to the ink by a blocking stencil. A squeegee is moved across the screen to fill the open mesh apertures with ink. A reverse stroke then causes the screen to touch the substrate momentarily along the line of contact. This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed. In our earlier publications, we have introduced this strategy to print security codes and images by using the fabricated ink through the screen printing technique. The step by step process for screen printing is shown in Fig. 32. Campos-Cuerva et al. demonstrated a strategy to print plasmonic nanoparticle based inks on different types of paper using screen printing, as already discussed in the previous section.298

4.2 Aerosol jet printing techniques
The aerosol jet printing process employs aerodynamic focusing for the high-resolution deposition of colloidal suspensions and/or chemical precursor solutions. An aerosol stream of the deposition material is focused, deposited and patterned onto a planar or 3D substrate.299 The basic system consists of two key components: (i) a module for atomizing liquid raw materials.
(ii) The other module for focusing the aerosol and depositing the droplets.
Meruga et al. demonstrated a method for the fabrication of green and blue upconversion nanoparticle based inks and their usability for printing QR codes on paper using aerosol jet printing.11h The protocol for the printing of QR codes employing an aerosol jet printer is shown in Fig. 33. Initially, the QR code was designed using a QR code generator and stored in an Auto-CAD file for transfer to the aerosol jet printer. Thereafter, the QR code was printed on paper using an aerosol jet printer. The parameters used for printing were a sheath of 125 ccm, an atomizer of 30 ccm, an atomizer power of 35 V, a nozzle size of 250 μm and a deposition speed of 5 mm s−1. In another study, Meruga et al. followed a similar approach for fabrication and printing of red-green-blue upconversion nanoparticle based luminescent inks.300

4.3 Inkjet printing techniques
The inkjet printing process involves the ejection of a fixed amount of ink in a chamber, from a nozzle through a sudden, quasi-adiabatic reduction of the chamber volume via piezoelectric action.301 A chamber filled with liquid is contracted in response to application of an external voltage. This sudden reduction sets up a shockwave in the liquid, which causes a liquid drop to eject from the nozzle. This process has been analyzed to some extent and elaborated in recent review papers.302,303 The ejected drop falls under the action of gravity and air resistance until it impinges on the substrate, spreads under the momentum acquired in the motion, and surface tension aided flow along the surface.304 The drop then dries through solvent evaporation,305 as shown in Fig. 34. Recent studies306 show that drop spreading and the final printed shape strongly depend on the viscosity, which in turn is a function of the molar mass of the polymer. More interestingly, the aforementioned group also found the printing height dependence of the final dried-drop diameter, which was a function of the polymer concentration. The usability of ink jet printers for printing security codes can be credited to its attractive features like:295
 Fig. 34  The process of drop drying after deposition with inkjet printing.305 Reproduced with permission from ref. 305, Copyright 2008, Wiley. 
(i) The possibility for purely additive operation, in which the corresponding inks are deposited only where they are needed.
(ii) The flexibility in the choice of structure designs for producing complicated security patterns, where changes can be implemented right away using software-based printer-control systems as shown in Fig. 35.

(iii) Its compatibility for use with large-area substrates.
(iv) The potential for high spatial resolution (depending on the DPI) and mass production.295
You et al. introduced a digital and flexible inkjet printing technique for the printing of security patterns with high resolution and high luminescence.295 The schematic diagram for inkjet printing using upconversion inks is shown in Fig. 35.

4.3.1 Inkjet properties. 
The inkjet printing technique requires attention pertaining to several important features, which are discussed in detail below:
4.3.1.1 Ink properties. 
Ink properties such as dynamic viscosity, surface tension, etc. play a vital role in the effectiveness of inkjet printing. The flow of liquid drops on the substrate can affect the printing resolution considerably. The spreading of the liquid drops could be measured using the inverse Ohnesorge number,  where α is the nozzle diameter, γ is the surface tension, ρ is the density of ink and η is the dynamic viscosity.295
You et al. optimized the inverse Ohnesorge number and hence the surface tension and dynamic viscosity for effective inkjet printing to achieve uniform and high resolution patterns. The obtained dynamic viscosity and surface tension vary as a function of the ratio between cyclohexane and glycerol trioleate as shown in Fig. 36a and b. A similar result was claimed by them for the aqueous printing ink as shown in Fig. 36c and d.295
 Fig. 36  Characterization of the UCNP ink with varying ratios of components at 25 ± 1 °C. (a) The dynamic viscosity of solvent based printing ink changes with the v:v cyclohexane:glycerol trioleate ratio. (b) The gas–liquid surface tension of solvent based printing ink changes with the v:v cyclohexane:glycerol trioleate ratio. (c) The dynamic viscosity of aqueous printing ink changes with v:v ethanol–water solution (10%):glycerol ratio. (d) The gas–liquid surface tension of aqueous printing ink changes with the v:v ethanol–water solution (10%):glycerol ratio.295 Reproduced with permission ref. 295, Copyright 2015, Royal Society of chemistry. 
4.3.1.2 Contact angle and spatial resolution. 
Another important parameter for effective inkjet printing with good resolution is the contact angle.295 When a liquid droplet lands on a flat surface, partial wetting results in an infinite angle between the liquid and the substrate, known as the contact angle, θc. This parameter affects the penetration of the ink into substrates which can be described by Washburn's equation:  where γ is the surface tension, D is the diameter of the capillary tube (capillary porosity between paper fibers), θc is the contact angle, and η is the dynamic viscosity. The quality of printed patterns is mainly affected by the different contact angles formed when the ink drops on the substrates. You et al. optimized the contact angle and spatial resolution for both solvent based and aqueous based luminescent security inks. The optimum values of contact angles for solvent based and aqueous based luminescent security inks are 25.7 ± 0.8 degrees and 32.8 ± 1.2 degrees respectively as shown in Fig. 37a and b. The spatial resolution obtained using solvent based and aqueous based luminescent security inks was optimized at 100–200 μm and using solvent based ink is 400–500 μm respectively as shown in Fig. 37c and d.295

4.3.1.3 Luminescence intensity and uniformity. 
Identification of printed patterns depends mainly on the luminescence uniformity which is affected by the size and distribution of droplets ejected by the nozzle. You et al. tested the variance of the luminescence intensity in a ring printing area with different UCNP concentrations varying from 0.3 mg ml−1 to 7.5 mg ml−1 under 980 nm excitation with a power density of ∼50 mW mm−2 as shown in Fig. 38a. For each concentration, they randomly tested the luminescence intensity of five points from the printing area. The corresponding luminescence spectrum of UCNPs with different concentrations under 980 nm excitation and the deviation in the luminescence intensity peaking at 538 nm are shown in Fig. 38b and c.295

5. Luminescent materials for anti-counterfeiting applications
After brief discussions on the strategy for fabrication and design of security inks as well as various types of printing techniques, we have explored the details regarding different luminescent material based anti-counterfeiting applications including exploratory studies on other important luminescent inks based on electroluminescence and chemiluminescence in the following sections:
5.1 Lanthanide based luminescent security ink for anti-counterfeiting applications
We have described here the different types of lanthanide doped luminescent nanomaterial based security inks, and also discussed in this section about the down conversion based luminescent nanomaterials, upconversion based luminescent nanomaterials and dual mode emission based luminescent nanomaterials used for the purpose of security ink fabrication.

5.1.1 Downconversion/downshift based luminescent security ink for anti-counterfeiting applications. 
Andres et al. reported the red and green emitting down conversion luminescent security inks.7 These green and red emitting luminescent inks were used to print full colour images on paper by using a commercially available inkjet printer and are invisible under white light and emit (red, green and blue) RGB colours under UV light that acts as an excitation source. The commercially available blue ink was added in green and red emitting luminescent inks in order to achieve the production of full colour images in the visible range. The colour range of the luminescent print was as wide as standard RGB displays. Fig. 39a shows the photographs of a set of standard images produced with the luminescent inks on Canson paper under white light and excited under UV light of 254 nm wavelength. We have also reported earlier the strategy for the synthesis and fabrication of the invisible luminescent security ink designed by using ultra-fine red emitting Y2O3:Eu3+ nanophosphors (luminescent nanoparticles) for anti-counterfeiting applications.15 The colloidal solution of ultra-fine nanophosphors was highly stable and emitted strong red colour (emission wavelength ∼611 nm) under the excitation with 254 nm UV light. The colloidal solution of Y2O3:Eu3+ nanophosphors dispersed in sodium hexametaphosphate under white light and UV light (250 nm) is illustrated in Fig. 39b. Fig. 39c shows the bright glow of screen printed letters using a colloidal solution of nanophosphor in sodium hexametaphosphate aqueous solution under UV (250 nm). Furthermore, our group recently reported a facile method for the synthesis of highly luminescent and biocompatible europium doped lanthanum orthophosphate (La0.85PO4Eu0.153+) nanorods and their applications against counterfeiting.14 These nanorods emit a strong red colour (emission wavelength ∼610 nm) upon 394 nm wavelength excitation and form transparent as well as stable solutions with a commercially available PVC gold medium (hydrophobic in nature), which can be further used for screen printing to print patterns or objects on black paper. In order to explore the feasibility test of the fabricated luminescent ink, two kinds of black papers were used which were named art black paper (smooth and shiny in nature) and pastel black paper (rough surface and dull shining in nature) as shown in Fig. 39d and e. These printed patterns on black papers (screen printed CSIR-NPL letters and rough pastel black paper screen printed VARANASI letters) remain invisible in white light and emit red colour upon excitation with 254 nm wavelength of UV light as shown in Fig. 39d–g. Therefore, these luminescent nanorods can be used in security ink fabrication for anti-counterfeiting applications for the protection of brands and valuable documents such as bank notes, diplomas and certificates.

Furthermore, in another study, Chen et al. suggested that the (Y,Gd)VO4:Bi3+,Eu3+ phosphor can be utilized for anti-counterfeiting applications.307 The emission colour of (Y,Gd)VO4:Bi3+,Eu3+ phosphors is sensitive to temperature and excitation wavelength. Additionally, the emission colour can be tailored from green to orange by varying Bi3+ and Eu3+ concentrations.


5.1.2 Upconversion based luminescent security ink for anti-counterfeiting applications. 
Blumenthal et al. reported a strategy to fabricate an invisible luminescent security ink using upconverting nanophosphors.294 The upconverting ink solution is composed of upconverting nanophosphors in toluene with oleic acid as the capping agent and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as the binding agent along with methyl benzoate. This upconverting ink can be utilized for printing using both direct-write printing and screen-printing techniques. These printed features are invisible in normal light, but they can be easily seen by the naked eye when these printed objects are excited under light of 980 nm wavelength. Fig. 40a and b show the images of the printed features under normal light and upon excitation at 980 nm. In another study, Meruga et al. demonstrated that the upconversion nanophosphor can be used for the formulation of security inks in anti-counterfeiting applications.11h They have printed quick response codes (QR) using green and blue upconverting inks via an aerosol jet direct writing machine. The printed QR code using green upconverting ink is shown in Fig. 40c and d. The QR is invisible in normal light and shows a bright green colour under NIR excitation at 980 nm. The high level of QR code security was created by printing two different colour inks: green and blue on the substrate. The printed QR code under excitation at 980 nm wavelength is shown in Fig. 40e. The image clearly reveals the printed upconverting QR code under excitation at 980 nm. In another study, Meruga et al. presented tri-colour QR codes using red, green and blue upconverting inks.300 The QR codes are printed using an aerosol jet printer. The tri-colour printed QR code shows the highly resolved multi-colour image of the pattern under excitation at 980 nm. Furthermore, they printed red, green and blue inks as isolated and overlapping with each other to produce red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow and white upconversion luminescence. The printed QR code under normal light and upon excitation at 980 nm is shown in Fig. 40f. Furthermore, Wang et al. elegantly utilized the lanthanide doped upconversion luminescent nanomaterials for the detection of latent fingermarks which are invisible in normal light and emit green colour when they are excited under 980 nm NIR wavelength of light.308 They had successfully demonstrated the detection of latent fingermarks on various substrates such as glass, ceramic tiles, floor leather, marble of different surface textures, metallic materials, polymeric materials, wood materials and various papers. Fig. 40g–j show the latent fingermarks on the surface of various paper substrates, which were stained with NaYF4:Yb,Er upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and then detected by NIR-induced fluorescence imaging upon excitation at a wavelength of 980 nm. Thus, this investigation opens up new avenues for use of lanthanide doped nanomaterials in forensic science for the development or detection of latent fingermarks.

Zhang et al. suggested the use of multicolor barcoding in single upconversion crystals.309 In their study, they synthesized multicolour emitting upconversion microrods by facile hydrothermal methods and demonstrated their anti-counterfeiting applications. Moreover, they also reported the end-on growth of the β-NaYF4 microrods by using α-NaYF4 nanoparticles as the precursor material. Fig. 40k shows the fluorescent image of the multicolor emitting microrods under 980 nm excitation. The multicolor emitting upconversion microrods were found to be well dispersed in dimethyl sulphoxide solvent, which is transparent in white light and shows bright colour upon excitation at 980 nm NIR wavelength. Fig. 40l shows the magnified luminescent image of a stamped letter S which is printed with inks consisting of microrods. The emission spectrum of microrods is also shown in Fig. 40l. Thus, these multi-colour emitting microrods provide a new opportunity by means of fluorescent barcodes for anti-counterfeiting applications.
Furthermore, You et al. introduced a strategy for digital or flexible printing using upconversion nanoparticle based ink for fabrication of security patterns with high resolution and high luminescence intensity for anti-counterfeiting application.295 In their study, they fabricated both hydrophobic and hydrophilic luminescent security inks using upconversion nanophosphors and used simple inkjet printing to produce anti-counterfeiting patterns. Moreover, the upconversion nanophosphor was combined with the downconversion nanophosphor to produce different patterns in the same area which can be seen separately upon excitation of different sources. Fluorescence images of multi-colour patterning of the green upconversion nanophosphor (NaYF4:Yb,Er) and the blue down conversion nanophosphor (NaYF4:Yb,Tm) are shown in Fig. 40m and n by direct-writing with a pen on a black surface. Hence, the reported technique is quite promising to use against counterfeiting due to its feasibility to be produced easily and it being hard to duplicate.
Sangeetha et al. presented three dimensional (3D) QR codes which were formed using upconversion nanophosphors by atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoxerography.310 In this study, it was observed that the fabrication of 3D patterns using an assembly of NaYF nanocrystals (NCs) depends upon the surface potential of the charge patterns, the NC concentration, the polarizability of the NCs and the polarity of the dispersing solvent. A QR code with different thicknesses and a QR code with two colour emitting upconversion nanophosphors were fabricated. The fabricated QR code can be readily imaged using a photoluminescence mapping technique. Fig. 40o and p show the AFM topographical images of the QR code fabricated by using two different upconverting NCs. Fig. 40q reveals blue emission with 485 nm upconversion PL mapping after passing the light through a 500 nm short pass filter. In Fig. 40r, the number “31” is hidden with the QR code and it is revealed in the green colour emission at 545 nm wavelength, when light is passed through a 530 nm long pass filter as well as a 650 nm short pass filter. Hence, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoxerography result suggests that it can be an ultimate choice for high end protection against counterfeiting. In another interesting study, Ramos et al. suggested 3D security-ink stamps or fluorescent labels for visual identification of orthodontic adhesives, which exhibit visible luminescence upon infrared light as shown in Fig. 40s and t.311
Another interesting result was reported by Baride et al. where they fabricated NIR to NIR upconversion security inks based on Yb3+/Tm3+ doped β-NaYF4 nanophosphors. Fig. 41 shows the printed QR codes which are invisible under ambient conditions and the NIR luminescent images (800 nm) of QR codes can be easily captured by using a CCD camera.312

5.1.3 Dual mode luminescent security ink for anti-counterfeiting applications. 
The single stage coding capability for either upconversion or downconversion based security inks implies that the developed luminescent ink can be excited by a single wavelength and it subsequently emits only a single wavelength. This coding technique appears to be comparatively less effective in protecting documents. Owing to this reason, high performance multi-stage coding with many excitations and at least two colour emissions has been much awaited for a long time. Developing a phosphor having all the above desirable properties at an economical cost is a great challenge in this area which has been recently addressed in a few reports. The development of a multi-stage excitable ink provides the multi-stage coding capability in a single host lattice which is not only economical but is also beneficial for high end protection of documents to avoid counterfeiting. Lu et al. reported a strategy to fabricate a dual mode security ink based on lanthanide doped nanocrystals. The fabricated ink was used to print anti-counterfeiting stamps.313 The printed stamps (in Chinese characters) exhibit a bright green colour upon excitation at 980 nm and blue colour upon excitation at 365 nm as shown in Fig. 42a. Furthermore, we have reported dual mode lanthanide nanorods for anti-counterfeiting application which are capable of emitting a green colour upon excitation at wavelengths of 379 nm and 980 nm.12 To fabricate and design a dual mode ink using Y2O3:Er,Yb nanorods, we dispersed these nanorods into a commercially available PVC gold medium. The ink can be printed on paper by the screen printing technique. Fig. 42b shows the printed pattern under normal light at different excitation wavelengths (379 nm and 980 nm). The schematic of the proposed application of this dual mode luminescent security ink for currency protection against counterfeiting is shown in Fig. 42c. Thus, this multistage excitable invisible ink provides new opportunities for dual mode protection against counterfeiting. In another study, Singh et al. demonstrated a strategy to synthesize a dual mode security ink based on an inorganic–organic hybrid nanostructure which produced visible emission both via UC and DC processes.314 In the hybrid structure, the Gd2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ nanophosphor (inorganic material) contributes to the upconversion process while the Eu(DBM)3Phen complex (organic materials) contributes to the downconversion process. This hybrid material was dispersed in ethanol to form a stable security ink and further used for security code printing. Fig. 42d–g show ink solutions and the printed pattern at UV and NIR excitation wavelengths which can be easily seen by the naked eye.

5.2 Quantum dot based security ink for anti-counterfeiting applications
Quantum dots (QDs) demonstrate light emission which depends upon their size. Due to their extraordinary photoluminescence behavior, quantum dots can be used for fabricating security inks. Lu et al. reported rewritable multicolour fluorescent patterns based on QDs.296 In this rewritable fluorescent system, branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) acts as both a writer and a remover. The process of erasing or writing the fluorescent patterns is shown in Fig. 43a. Thus, this technique has the ability to produce multistate memory chips with highly protected and ultrahigh data storage capacity for broad applications in anti-counterfeiting.296 In another report, Bao et al. fabricated fluorescent CdS QD–polymer nanocomposite patterns through inkjet printing using a cadmium source loaded ink, followed by treating the patterns with hydrogen sulfide gas.315 Furthermore, CdS QD–polymer composites (PC) with enhanced fluorescence are fabricated by introducing monodisperse poly(styrene–methyl methacrylate–acrylic acid) (poly(St–MMA–AA)) microspheres that serve as the PC building blocks into the inks. The fabricating process is straightforward and flexible, and would find diverse applications in patterning nanocomposites for optoelectronic devices. Fig. 43b shows photographs and fluorescent images of dot-matrix-constructed CdS QD–polymer composite patterns. This CdS QD–polymer composite would have potential use in anti-counterfeiting applications.

In another report Gao et al. reported the fluorescent/antibacterial multifunctional nanomaterials of m-SiO2/CdTe/Ag for anti-counterfeiting applications.316 In their study, the CdTe QDs were implanted into the mesoporous-SiO2 nanospheres which prevents QDs from agglomerating. Additionally, Ag nanoparticles were introduced to make an antibacterial composite ink. The objects painted with the composite ink under normal light and UV light are shown in Fig. 43c–f. The m-SiO2/CdTe/Ag composite inks could offer/open new avenues to develop fluorescent/antibacterial inks for anti-counterfeiting application. Zhou et al. developed a strategy to synthesize water soluble silica QDs by the ionic liquid (IL)-assisted solution route and showed their potential use for anti-counterfeiting applications.317 The synthesized silica QDs exhibit excitation dependent photoluminescence and possess temperature sensitive properties. Fig. 43g–j show the fluorescent microscopy images of patterns composed of silicon QD solutions (triangle) and commercially available green fluorescent inks (circle) under UV light. In another report, Cui et al. introduced an approach for the photothermal latent fingerprint (LFP) imaging method based on the high photothermal conversion efficiency of Cu7S4 nanocomposites.318 In their study, they performed photothermal LFP imaging on different substrates with various background colours. In the suggested photothermal imaging approach, not only well-resolved ridge patterns with good separation between furrows and ridges of the LFP are achieved but detailed information on a fingerprint, including bifurcation, whorl, termination, and crossover, could also be recognized in high-magnification images as shown in Fig. 43k.318 Furthermore, Wang et al. fabricated an ink based on the dual mode (down conversion and upconversion) luminescent carbon dot fluid (CDF) direct thermal decomposition method.319 The ink was stable up to six months at room temperature and can be used for inkjet printing. The photographs of the inkjet printed logo on weighing paper using CDF, under normal, UV and NIR light are shown in Fig. 44a. In another approach, Wen et al. synthesized luminescent inks based on green fluorescent carbon dots (CD) by pyrolysis and microwave treatment using cotton as the precursor.320 The multicolor patterns using a CD based ink showing favorable application in anti-counterfeiting are shown in Fig. 44b and c.

Wang et al. reported a luminescent security ink based on amphiphilic fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) which were synthesized by the rapid plasma-induced method using natural chicken egg as precursor materials.321 The synthesized CDs were amphiphilic in nature and can be easily dissolved in water and most organic solvents. The fluorescent ink based on CDs can be used for both inkjet and silk-screen printing. Fig. 44d–g show the photographs of fluorescent patterns printed using a fluorescent ink based on CDs. In another study, Wang et al. reported a luminescent security ink based on carbon quantum dots synthesized by pyrolysis using citric acid as the precursor and an imidazolium (1-aminopropyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide [APMIm][Br]) based capping agent.322 The amphiphilicity of the synthesized CQDs was tuned by anion exchange and phase transfer. Furthermore, the author demonstrated that these hydrophobic CQDs could be utilized for fabrication of fluorescent inks which can be used for writing on various surfaces for anti-counterfeiting application. The photographs of different letters written on various surfaces using CQD fluorescence are shown in Fig. 44h. Gao et al. introduced another strategy for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) via hydrothermal treatment.323 The supernatant emits hyperfine blue emission under UV light and further can be used as a fluorescent ink. Fig. 44i shows an image of a printed object using the supernatant as ink under UV light.
5.3 Luminescent MOFs for anti-counterfeiting applications
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are of great interest due to their fascinating properties and potential use in various applications. Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have also been used for anti-counterfeiting applications.324 Luz et al. reported the fabrication of luminescent inks based on lanthanide-MOFs.297 The fluorescent MOFs were printed on flexible substrates (paper and plastic foil) using an inkjet printer. The author suggested that the MOF based security inks can potentially be used for printing invisible security labels or codes in anti-counterfeiting applications. Fig. 45a and b show the bright red and green emitting patterns deposited by using lanthanide MOF inks (R and G-MOFs) on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate under UV light (254 nm). In another report, Li et al. introduced a novel approach to fabricate a patterned luminescent metal–organic-framework (LMOF) film by using an electrochemically assisted microwave deposition technique.325

The electrochemical deposition technique was used to fabricate a patterned lanthanide hydroxide on conducting glass. Furthermore, a microwave technique was used to convert the patterned lanthanide hydroxide into MOFs. This method could be an ultimate choice to spatially locate MOFs on the surface of the substrate. Therefore, these LMOFs might be used for anti-counterfeiting applications. The photographs of barcodes based on LMOFs (Eu-MOFs and Tb-MOFs) are shown in Fig. 45c and d. Zhou et al. reported a facile strategy to develop a barcode system based on a lanthanide photo-functionalized metal–organic-framework (MOF) film that contains multiple emission bands corresponding to lanthanide ions.326 The intensity of multiple emission bands can be predicted and tuned by controlling the filtered dye loading, which gives distinct radiometric optical codes. Therefore, this strategy can be used to generate barcodes using lanthanide MOFs and can be potentially used for anti-counterfeiting applications. Fig. 45e shows the emission spectra of the Eu3+/Tb3+@MIL-100 (ln) film with various dye loading combinations and the two dimensional matrix of the radiometric code. Lu et al. reported a new method for luminescent barcodes based on nanoscale MOFs (MOF-253).265 The barcoding was realized by the post-synthetic method (PSM) to introduce lanthanide ions (Eu3+, Tb3+ and Sm3+). The emission intensity of each lanthanide ion is proportional to its amount in the MOFs, resulting in unique luminescent barcodes that depend on the lanthanide ion ratios and compositions. Therefore, luminescent barcodes depend upon the ratio of lanthanide ions used and their composition. The emission spectra of MOF-253-TbxEu1−x display the characteristic transition of the Eu3+ ion and Tb3+ ion upon excitation at 330 nm as shown in Fig. 45f. Fig. 45f also shows the colour-coding of the barcode readout in the CIE chromaticity diagram and the photograph of the MOF-253-based barcoded material dispersed in ethanol under excitation at 330 nm.
5.4 Plasmonic nanomaterials for anti-counterfeiting applications
The plasmonic nanomaterials have great prospects as next generation security labels/codes for anti-counterfeiting applications. However, there are limited reports published on the application of plasmonic nanomaterials for anti-counterfeiting applications. Zhang et al. prepared luminescent inks using glutathione-capped gold nanoclusters (GS–AuNCs), synthesized by a solution-based microwave method.327 The emission colour of GS–AuNCs was tuned by controlling the reaction time. The photoluminescence emission of GS–AuNCs was blue shifted when the reaction time was increased. Fig. 46a–c show the photographs of filter paper with words written using GS–AuNC based luminescent inks in normal light and UV light (365 nm). Campos-Cuerva et al. reported another approach for the combination of both optical and magnetic materials for anti-counterfeiting applications.298 In their study, they chose single phase spherical nanoparticles (Ag, Au and magnetite) and printed them on different papers by the screen printing technique. The combinations of optical and magnetic materials provide both optical and magnetic signals from the same spot that can be detected independently. The major advantage of these printed codes is that the printed signals remain stable under accelerating conditions, thereby providing a strategy for high multi-stage security inks for anti-counterfeiting applications. Fig. 46d shows the word ‘NANOTECHNOLOGY’ in which the letters ‘NA’ have been screen printed with Ag nanoparticles, the letters ‘CH’ with gold nanorods, the letters ‘GY’ with a commercial green ink, the first letters ‘NO’ have two overlapping layers, the first printed with magnetic nanoparticles and on top of it the same printing with Ag nanoparticles; the second letters ‘NO’ also contain two overlapping layers, the one underneath printed with magnetic nanoparticles and one on top printed with gold nanorods.298

5.5 Other anti-counterfeiting applications based on electroluminescence and chemiluminescence based security inks
Recently, electroluminescence and chemiluminescence based security inks have gained immense interest because of their use in the field of security applications. Huebner et al. reported electroluminescent colloidal inks for flexographic roll-to-roll printing.328 A wide range of colours was produced by mixing red, green and blue emitting nanoparticles in different ratios. The light emitting diodes (LEDs) were fabricated using these electroluminescent colloidal inks. The optical images of colloidal based organic light emitting devices templated into a 12.7 mm wide tiger paw insignia with varying RGB dye ratios and the corresponding electroluminescence spectra are shown in Fig. 47.328 Xu et al. reported another approach for the detection of protein/polypeptide residues in latent fingermarks by electrochemiluminescence.329 Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a form of chemiluminescence where the light emission is due to the electrochemical reaction. In electrochemiluminescence, the light emitting species are formed near the electrode surface which offers an approach for imaging electrochemical or biosensing events. The important advantage of ECL imaging is that it does not involve any sophisticated instruments and does not use explosive items. Fig. 48a shows the ECL image of a hIgG groomed fingermark treated by the single-HRP route and its magnified images showing secondary level details are shown in Fig. 48b. The image was obtained at an applied potential of −0.7 V in a 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 8.5, sodium salts) containing 0.5 mM luminol and 0.23 mM p-iodophenol. Xu et al. reported a strategy for the visualization and detection of latent fingermarks on metal surfaces via electro-chemiluminescence.330 In their study, they produced a negative image of fingerprints using electrochemiluminescence. The ECL images of fingermarks on different surfaces are shown in Fig. 48c–f. In another study, Xu et al. presented two methods to visualize latent fingermarks on the basis of spatially controlled ECL.331 In one method (negative mode), the negative image of fingermarks was produced by directly exposing the electrode bearing fingermarks to a solution of tris(2,2′-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) ([Ru(bpy)3]2+) and tri-n-propylamine (TPrA). While in the other method (positive mode), the electrode bearing fingerprint ridge deposit was tagged with ECL-generating luminophores. The immobilized luminophores can then react with freely diffusing co-reactants to generate ECL. There are many reports on the visualization of latent fingermarks using electrochemiluminescence.332,333

6. Conclusions: prospects, challenges and new directions
The widespread act of counterfeiting in all kinds of important documents including currency has become a real threat to society. This review article brings into focus the recent trends adopted for anti-counterfeiting applications which are urgently required for scientific communities, industries, government offices and consumers to protect their important documents. This review article begins with the historical background of luminescent nanomaterials, basic concepts of the luminescence mechanism, their classification and then covers in detail the entire process right from the development of the desired luminescent nanomaterials, ink designing and fabrication, various types of printing techniques for security codes and in the end explores their anti-counterfeiting applications. In this review, we have explored modern strategies adopted for the synthesis of lanthanide doped luminescent nanomaterials (downconversion, upconversion and dual mode), luminescent quantum dots (semiconductor and carbon dots), luminescent metal organic frameworks and plasmonic nanostructures, their surface morphologies and structural/microstructural characterization. Furthermore, we have described the choice of luminescent nanomaterials used for the formulation of different types of security inks and their properties. Moreover, we have discussed in detail the ink fabrication and design based on lanthanide doped luminescent nanomaterials, luminescent quantum dots, luminescent metal organic frameworks and plasmonic nanomaterials. After that, we described in detail the three popular printing techniques which are screen printing, aerosol jet printing and inkjet printing used for the printing of security codes and images. Using these fabricated security inks reported by us and other groups, we have clearly demonstrated their use in anti-counterfeiting applications by printing the security codes/bars, fingerprints and images on different surfaces and their clear detection. Additionally, we have also made some exploratory studies related to other important luminescent inks based on electroluminescence and chemiluminescence for anti-counterfeiting applications. The major outcome of this review provides a series of solutions related to the use and choice of various kinds of luminescent nanomaterials, and their use in ink fabrication for high end security printing for protection against the counterfeiting of documents, banknotes, medicine, branded items, etc.
Although huge progress has been made in the development of security inks based on different types of luminescent nanomaterials for anti-counterfeiting applications to date, numerous challenges and issues still remain to be resolved and there is still a long way to go to substantiate their practical application. In terms of the synthesis of different types of luminescent nanomaterials and design of ink formulations, novel synthetic methods still need to be explored to improve the shortcomings of the current methods. The limitations with these luminescent nanomaterials used presently are manifold. In general they are expensive, or have limited availability, a high photobleaching effect and a low yield of synthesis. The major challenge in the present scenario is the full exploitation of luminescent nanomaterials which are free of these constraints. Another important challenge in this area is to develop a medium for the fabrication of a luminescent ink having a long lifetime, the desired viscosity, and less cost with ease of dispersion of luminescent material into the medium with good colloidal stability. In a nutshell, the contents of the review are highly useful in the current scenario due to its wide coverage from the synthesis of different kinds of luminescent nanomaterial based inks to anti-counterfeiting applications.
The discussions in this review take up in detail the different kinds of luminescent nanomaterials, ink fabrication and various kinds of printing techniques for security codes for anti-counterfeiting applications and this will reignite the interest of researchers and serve as stepping stones to carry out further research in this field to develop a luminescent security ink with the desired properties for establishing a strong anti-counterfeiting technology.

 	Fig. 7  Schematic representation of important optical and electronic processes in a semiconductor nanocrystal. Solid and dashed lines represent radiative and nonradiative processes, respectively. Legend of the processes: a, optical excitation; b, thermal relaxation of the excited electron and hole; c, radiative exciton recombination (luminescence); d, nonradiative exciton recombination mediated by an oxidising surface state (electron trap); e, nonradiative exciton recombination mediated by a reducing surface state (hole trap).99 Reproduced with permission from ref. 99, Copyright 2015, Royal Society of Chemistry.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) A bulk semiconductor such as CdSe has continuous conduction and valence energy bands separated by a “fixed” energy gap, Eg(bulk). Electrons normally occupy all states up to the edge of the valence band, whereas states in the conduction band are empty. (b) A QD is characterized by discrete atom-like states with energies that are determined by the QD radius R. These well-separated QD states can be labeled with atom-like notations, such as 1S, 1P, and 1D. (c) The expression for the size dependence separation between the lowest electron and hole QD states—Eg(QD), the QD energy gap—was obtained with the spherical “quantum box” model. (d) This schematic represents the continuous absorption spectrum of a bulk semiconductor (black line) compared with the discrete absorption spectrum of a QD (colored bars).100 Reproduced with permission from ref. 100, Copyright 2003, Los Alamos Science.
