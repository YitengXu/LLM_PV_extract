, Accepted 19th June 2023First published on 26th June 2023AbstractThis study describes the implementation of conductive polymer as drop-casted film electrodes that facilitate the detection of phenol. The device configuration comprises ITO electrode modified with a film of conductive polymer heterostructures (poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene-2,7-diyl) (PFO)/poly(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diy)-co-(1,4-benzo-(2,1′,3)-thiadiazole) (PFBT)). The utility of PFO/PFBT-modified electrode exhibited stable photocurrent signal under visible light irradiation. Using p-phenylenediamine (p-PD) as a model target, this photoelectrochemical sensor showed a linear detection range from 0.1 μM to 200 μM with a detection limit of 96 nM, as the formed heterojunctions could promote charge transfer between PFBT, PFO, and the electrode. The applicability of the sensor for detecting p-PD in hair dye further demonstrated that the proposed sensor had potential applications for p-PD detection in complex samples. The implementation of bulk-heterostructure conductive polymer in photoelectric detection holds promise for further development of highly modular, sensitive, selective, and stable electroanalytical devices. Besides, it is expected to inspire more interest toward the design, development, and implementation of various organic bulk heterojunctions for electrochemical devices in the future.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) sensing has been recognized as an efficient detection technique for different fields.1,2 This technique has elegant merits, such as high sensitivity, low background, and easy minimization.3,4 Tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop various materials to achieve a higher power conversion efficiency.5,6 Ever since its beginning, various inorganic semiconductors and semiconductor oxides have been highly exploited, for example, CdS, ZnS, PbS, TiO2, and ZnO.7–9 Subsequently, inorganic heterojunctions are flourishing because appropriate alignment of particular semiconductors may produce enhanced PEC properties.10–13 However, the potential leakage of metal ions (e.g., Cd and Pb) from inorganic materials and the severe photocorrosion are still critical concerns for extensive applications.14,15 Organic semiconductor polymers, with the readily tailored electrical and optical properties, extraordinary light-harvest ability and good stretchability, are a cluster of extensive material for various optoelectronic, for example, light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, photovoltaic devices, and organic solar cells.16–20 But, to our knowledge, they have seldom been studied in PEC sensing. Hence, different from the most extensively used inorganic semiconductors and conventional applications of organic semiconductors, in this study, conductive polymer heterojunction was used for novel PEC sensing.
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ), which holds promise as a potential renewable and economically viable energy source, plays an essential role in increasing the efficiency of photoelectrochemical applications.21 Organic polymer semiconductors, especially polymers, with advantages of tunable band gap, broad light absorption spectra, highly optical absorption coefficient, solution processable fabrication, and good film forming properties have emerged as attractive candidates to construct bulk-heterojunction.22–24 Photocurrent generation in organic bulk-heterojunction is most commonly understood as a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process, which predominantly involves the photoexcitation of one semiconductor followed by electron transfer to the another.25,26 The characteristic length scale of the interpenetrating network in the block is tens of nanometers, which is important for reducing charge recombination and enhancing charge separation. These newly separated charges drift in opposite directions under the action of an electric field, and then they are extracted to produce an electric current.27
In this study, conductive polymer heterostructures (poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene-2,7-diyl) (PFO)/poly(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diy)-co-(1,4-benzo-(2,1′,3)-thiadiazole) (PFBT)) were modified on the bare indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode to form the photocathode for phenol detection (Scheme 1). PFO and PFBT exhibit bright fluorescence with an emission maximum and have the potential to act as both electroactive and photoactive materials. The structural units of PFO and PFBT have pairs of phenylene rings locked in a coplanar format, which is beneficial for thermal and light stability. Since PFO and PFBT have a large energy gap, they are possible to synthesize copolymer-containing chain segments with narrow energy gap and realize emission in the full visible spectrum through energy transfer. In this system, the synthetic process of conductive polymer heterostructures can be easily scaled-up. Using p-phenylenediamine (p-PD) as a model, in the presence of p-PD, the photocurrents of conductive polymer heterostructures increased under visible light irradiation. Herein, the formed efficient heterojunctions could promote the electronic transfer and the spatial separation of electrons and holes, resulting in the “signal-on” PEC responses to p-PD. Due to the construction of photocatalytic heterojunctions, this developed PEC sensor exhibited the sensitive, selective, and stable p-PD detection. Besides, the stability of the sensor has been verified in experiments, and it also performed well on complex samples. This study manifested that polymer-based heterostructures have great promise for future PEC sensing, which would underlie elegant platforms for probing numerous events.

2. Experiment section
2.1. Reagents and apparatus
PFO (MW 30000–65000) and PFBT (MW 60000–100000) were obtained from p-OLED (Shanghai) Technology CO., Ltd (China). p-Phenylenediamine was obtained from Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Tetrahydrofuran (THF, anhydrous, ≥99.9%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (type KV-ITO-P001 with ITO coating 180 ± 30 nm, sheet resistance 7.5 ± 0.5 Ω cm−2) was obtained from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd (China). All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and used as received. Ultrapure water (≥18.25 MΩ) was used to prepare phosphate buffer (PB) or other aqueous solutions for the experiments throughout.
PEC measurements were carried out using a PEC system equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp and a monochromator (Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd, China). Linear sweep voltammogram (LSV), Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were conducted using a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system including a modified ITO electrode with a geometrical circular area (0.5 cm in diameter) as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded using a UV-3600i Plus UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
2.2. DFT calculations
In order to estimate the positioning of the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the three polymers, DFT calculations with the Gaussian 16 software were conducted. The B3LYP functional was employed for all calculations. For geometry optimization calculations, the 6-31G(d) basis set was employed. The singlet point energy calculations were performed with a larger basis set. 6-311G(d) basis set. The DFT-D3 with BJ-damping was utilized to correct the weak interaction to improve the calculation accuracy. Orbital energy level analysis was performed using Multiwfn software. The visualization of the orbitals for polymers was achieved using VMD software. Four units of fluorene and ethyl instead of octyl fluorene-side chains were employed to simplify the calculations and reduce the computational cost.28
2.3. Fabrication of PFO/PFBT heterostructures
The PFO/PFBT heterostructures were prepared via mixing the PFO and PFBT. Typically, PFO and PFBT were dissolved in THF to obtain a solution with a concentration of 1 mg mL−1. After ultrasonication for 2 min, the PFBT solution was mixed with PFO solution to obtain the PFO/PFBT heterostructures. Subsequently, the product was stored for future usage.
2.4. Fabrication of the PEC sensor
Before modifying the ITO glasses, they were carefully washed successively with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water by successive sonication for 20 min and then dried in air. Afterward, an aliquot of 10 μL of PFO/PFBT heterostructures was dropped onto the cleaned ITO electrodes and dried at room temperature to obtain PFO/PFBT/ITO electrode.
3. Results and discussion
In order to verify the heterojunction can be formed, the DFT calculations were conducted. As shown in Fig. 1, the conduction bands (CB) of PFO and PFBT are −5.36 V and −5.44 V, respectively, and the corresponding valence bands (VB) are −1.78 V and −2.78 V, respectively. Due to the difference in the Fermi level of PFO and PFBT, spontaneous electron transfer from PFBT to PFO will occur to realize the Ef equilibrium. Thus, a built-in electric field in the interface of PFO/PFBT can be constructed.

3.1. Characterization of the photocathode materials
Before forming the heterojunction, the properties of PFBT and PFO were studied using UV-Vis spectroscopy in the range of 300–600 nm. It is shown in Fig. 2 that PFBT and PFO exhibited strong absorption peaks at 450 nm and 380 nm, respectively. Compared to PFBT and PFO, characteristic peaks from both PFBT and PFO were observed in the UV-Vis spectra of the PFO/PFBT, confirming the synthesis of the composites.

The Mott–Schottky plots of all electrodes in the 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 7.0) electrolyte solution for the frequency of 1 kHz are shown in Fig. 3, the negative slope of the Mott–Schottky plots suggest that all polymers are p-type semiconductor.30 Flat band potentials (Efb) of PFO, PFBT, and PFO/PFBT were 2.35 V, 2.33 V, and 2.24 V, respectively. In general, the valence band (VB) potential of a p-type semiconductor is approximately close to their Efb.31,32 Based on the energy level positions of PFO and PFBT, the composite semiconductor may form typical type II heterostructures at the interface. Under visible light irradiation, photoelectrons (e−) and photoholes (h+) are generated on the CB of PFO and the VB of PFBT, respectively. The photoholes could readily transfer into the VB edge of PFBT through the interface because of the more positive VB potential of PFO, and PFBT can serve as the hole transport layer to convert adsorbed H2O/OH− to active hydroxyl radicals (˙OH). At the same time, the photoelectrons rapidly transfer to the CB of PFO. Owing to the hole transport layer role of PFBT for the composite catalysts, the hole–electron pair separation efficiency is improved.

In order to investigate the photoelectrocatalytic properties of PFO, PFBT, and PFO/PFBT modified electrode for the oxidation of p-PD, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4A–C, the current response under light is higher than under dark conditions, suggesting the essential role of light. Meanwhile, under visible light irradiation, the current response on the PFO/PFBT-modified electrode is higher than that on PFO/ITO and PFBT/ITO at a given potential of −0.3 V, suggesting the superior charge transfer efficiency in the PFO/PFBT heterostructure under visible light irradiation. In order to study the electrode reaction process, the Tafel curve was tested. As shown in Fig. 4D, a Tafel slope of 0.27 V dec−1 was obtained for PFO/PFBT, which is much smaller than PFO (0.81 V dec−1) and PFBT (0.51 V dec−1). The smaller Tafel slope of PFO/PFBT confirms faster kinetics, indicating a better PEC performance.29

Furthermore, in order to study the interfacial charger transfer properties between the electrolyte and electrode toward p-PD oxidation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out, as shown in Fig. S1A.† In general, the diameter of the semicircle arc (DSA) is connected with charge transfer resistance (Rct) and a smaller DSA represents a more effective interfacial charger transport and faster photogenerated electron–hole pair separation. It can be seen that the Rct of PFO/PFBT/ITO electrode is smaller in comparison to that of PFO/ITO and PFBT/ITO, suggesting a decrease in solid-state interface resistance and an increment in charge transfer efficiency. The above results suggested that the formed heterostructure could give superior charge transfer efficiency of the PFBT/ITO electrode. In addition, the open-circuit potential (OCP) measurements were conducted in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. As observed in Fig. S1B,† at the same time, the voltage change of the PFO/PFBT/ITO electrode was larger than that of the PFO/ITO electrode and PFBT/ITO electrode from dark to light, indicating a better charge separation and transfer for the PFO/PFBT/ITO electrode under visible light irradiation.
3.2. Polymer/ITO electrodes PEC sensing for p-PD
In order to obtain better detection performance, some important parameters and conditions, such as pH and potential, were optimized. As shown in Fig. 5A and Fig. S2A and 2C,† the photocurrent response increased with pH (4 to 10) increasing on the PFBT/ITO, PFO/ITO, and PFO/PFBT/ITO electrode and reached plateau at pH 7.0, which maybe because p-PD is unstable in acidic environments. Compared to the PFBT/ITO and PFO/ITO electrodes, the PFO/PFBT/ITO electrode exhibited higher photocurrent response at pH 7.0, depicting the superior electron transfer of the PFO/PFBT heterostructure. Thus, the pH 7.0 was selected for the experiment. It can be seen that the photocurrent response is gradually increased with the increment of potential on the PFBT/ITO, PFO/ITO, and PFO/PFBT/ITO electrodes (Fig. 5B and Fig. S2B and 2D†). When the potential increased, the high background current increased and the I–T curve of the PFBT/ITO and PFO/ITO electrodes changed shape (Fig. S3†). These results are ascribed to the instability of p-PD high potential. Therefore, the potential of −0.3 V was chosen for the experiment.

3.3 Analytical performances of the polymer BHJ electrode for p-PD
Under optimized conditions, the PEC performance of PFBT/ITO electrodes were investigated with different concentrations of p-PD. As shown in Fig. 6A, the photocurrent response of the three electrodes increased accordingly with an increase in the p-PD concentration, implying that more p-PD molecules were oxidized on the electrode. As observed in Fig. 6B, the typical linear dependence of the current response versus the concentration of p-PD could be well-fitted in the range from 0.1 μM to 200 μM. The detection limit was calculated to 0.096 μM at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. On the other hand, the PEC performance of the PFBT/ITO and PFO/ITO electrodes were also tested (Fig. S4 and Table S1†). Also, the comparison of this method with other methods is shown in Table S2.† These results show that the PFO/PFBT/ITO-modified electrode exhibited remarkable photoelectrochemical performance and effective charge transfer ability with visible light irradiation due to the high charge separation efficiency in PFO/PFBT. Therefore, the formation of the PFO/PFBT heterostructure could efficaciously promote the photoelectron transfer and hinder the photohole pair recombination during the photoelectrocatalytic process, finally resulting in significantly enhanced photoelectrocatalytic p-PD oxidation of the catalyst.

The stability of the PFO/ITO, PFBT/ITO, and PFO/PFBT/ITO electrodes was also tested by amperometric method. As depicted in Fig. S5,† above 80% of the initial photocurrent response was obtained after several light “on–off” cycles at optimal conditions of all of these electrodes. In addition, each electrode was tested for three consecutive days, and 80% of the initial photocurrent response was also retained (Fig. S6†). PFO/PFBT with high photostability could promote excellent light-harvesting ability and transform light energy to valuable chemicals and achieve effective light energy utilization. Thus, PFO/PFBT could be as a photocatalyst for p-PD oxidation. These results implied that the fabricated PEC sensor exhibited good stability and reproducibility.
In order to prove the selectivity of PFO/PFBT toward the oxidation of p-PD, a variety of interfering species, including metal ions and other phenol compound containing 1 mM Na+, 1 mM Ca2+, 1 mM Cu2+, 1 mM Fe2+, 1 mM Fe3+, 1 mM K+, 1 mM Mg2+, 1 mM NH4+, 1 mM catechol, 1 mM resorcinol, 1 mM hydroquinone, 1 mM o-phenylenediamine, and 1 mM m-phenylenediamine, were injected into the same homogeneously stirred PBS containing 10 μM p-PD one by one. As shown in Fig. S7,† the added metal ions did not produce enhancements in the current response, suggesting that the interfering species have no interference in p-PD detection and the PFO/PFBT/ITO electrode shows excellent selectivity toward p-PD detection in the presence of common physiological interferents.
In order to realize accurate detection in a complex environment, hair dye was selected. First, the obtained hair dye cream was dissolved in 0.1 M PBS. After ultrasonic treatment for 5 min, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min to obtain the sample, which was employed for testing. Three hair dye creams were measured, and the results were shown in Table S3.† It can be seen that the recovery for p-PD was from 98.94% to 108.99%, and the RSDs were between 1.17% and 8.57%, implying the potential application of this method for complex samples analysis. (2) Dye wastewater test: phenol, rhodamine B, and p-phenylenediamine are common raw materials in the printing and dyeing industry, and coexist in the wastewater produced by this industry. A certain concentration of phenol, rhodamine B, and p-phenylenediamine are mixed to simulate the wastewater of the printing and dyeing industry. 1 g rhodamine B was added into 1 L ultra-pure water to obtain 100 ppm rhodamine B solution. Phenol (94.11 mg) and p-phenylenediamine (108.14 mg) were dissolved in 100 mL water. Then, the above solutions were diluted 10 times and mixed to obtain simulated dye wastewater. The obtained dye wastewater was employed to test, and the results are shown in Table S4.† It can be seen that the recovery for detecting p-PD was from 94.43% to 107.34%, and the RSDs were between 1.43% and 7.84%, suggesting the proposed biosensor along with PFO/PFBT had potential applications for the detection of p-PD in the complex sample.
4. Conclusion
To conclude, a highly effective visible light-driven conductive polymer PFO/PBFT heterostructure is elaborately designed and prepared via a facile approach. Significantly, the novel heterostructure electrode material displays the superior catalytic efficiency for p-PD in PBS conditions with visible light, due to fascinating features, including a large surface area, excellent charge separation efficiency, easy processability, and versatility in surface conjugation. After the formation of PFO/PBFT heterostructure, the current response of the PFO/PBFT-modified electrode was 10 times than that of the PFO-modified electrode. More significantly, the assistance of visible light could further promote the current response of the PFO/PBFT/ITO electrode, suggesting the superiority of the photocatalytic process of PFO/PBFT. In addition, the structure of the polymers can easily adjust, which means the energy levels can be designed as we demand.33–35 These results showed that the ternary PFO/PBFT heterostructure could further facilitate the development of a semiconductor heterostructure for the application of photoelectrocatalytic technology and provide a new pathway for developing visible light-driven electrode materials in a PEC biosensor.
