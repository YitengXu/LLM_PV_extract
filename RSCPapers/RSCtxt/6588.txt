    , Accepted 26th February 2018First published on 28th February 2018AbstractNiCo2S4 is a promising material for supercapacitors owing to its merits of high conductivity and activity in redox reactions. However it suffers poor cycling stability due to structural degradation of the electrode through the redox process. Herein we demonstrate a facile method for the synthesis of a NiCo2S4/graphene composite where NiCo2S4 is encapsulated with an ultrathin graphene layer to form a core/shell structure (NiCo2S4@G). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the shell is only 3–5 layers of graphene and the NiCo2S4 particle core has a uniform size of around 5–7 nm. The NiCo2S4@G composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 1432 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. A hybrid supercapacitor assembled using the synthesized NiCo2S4@G as a positive electrode and porous carbon as a negative electrode demonstrates a high energy density of 43.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 254.3 W kg−1 in the voltage range 0–1.35 V. After 5000 charge/discharge cycles, the device still retains 83.4% of its initial capacitance.
Introduction
The increasing demand for clean and renewable energy has driven continuous research on the development of renewable energy storage and conversion technologies.1 Supercapacitors (SCs) or electrochemical capacitors (ECs) are types of energy storage device which are complementary to batteries due to their high power density and long cycling life.2 Generally, there are two types of electrode material for SCs according to their operational mechanisms: electric double-layer electrode materials and pseudocapacitive-type electrode materials.3 Electric double-layer materials store and release electrical energy by electrostatic force in the electric double layer near electrode–electrolyte interfaces which guarantees high power density but suffers from low energy density,4 whereas pseudocapacitive-type materials make use of reversible fast faradaic reactions that occur at the electrode surface, thus offering much higher specific capacitance. However, the most significant challenge for both electric double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors is their insufficient energy densities in comparison with both batteries and fuel cells. To overcome this challenge, extensive work has been devoted to battery-type electrodes coupled with supercapacitor-type electrodes to fabricate hybrid supercapacitors with high voltages and enhanced energy densities.5
Transition metal oxides,6 hydroxides,7 conducting polymers8 and their compounds9 have been widely explored for use in high-performance pseudocapacitive or battery-type capacitors due to their low cost and low toxicity. However, the low conductivity of these materials makes it difficult for them to provide a large current, resulting in low rate capability and poor power density. More recently, metal sulfides have attracted much attention owing to their potential applications in catalysis, optics, solar energy, sensing, and batteries.10 They are also suitable candidates for SCs due to them having higher electrochemical activity and conductivity than their corresponding metal oxides.11 A variety of metal sulfides such as CuS,12 MoS2,13 NiS,14 CoS,15 Co9S8,16 NiCo2S4,17,18 NixCo9−xS819 and NixCo3−xS420,21 have been studied as potential electrochemical energy storage materials. Most notably, ternary nickel cobalt sulfides have demonstrated much higher conductivity and electrochemical activity than nickel cobalt oxides due to their smaller band gaps.10 In particular, nanostructured NiCo2S4 is considered to be an excellent electrode material for use in energy storage devices but it is restricted by poor cycling stability because of structural degradation of the electrode materials during the redox reaction process.22 It has been demonstrated that graphene can be utilized as a perfect matrix for nanomaterials to enhance electrochemical activity.23 Nevertheless, nanoparticles are inclined to agglomerate and detach from the surface of graphene sheets because of poor interfacial binding with the graphene surface, causing a fading in capacitive performance. Therefore, a metal sulfide providing stable and strong interfacial binding with the graphene surface without aggregation is an essential factor in improving its supercapacitive performance. In comparison with nanoparticle-on-sheet materials, core–shell structured composites have many advantages when used in supercapacitors due to their high thermodynamic stability and protective layered structure. It is believed that well-controlled growth of ultra-dispersed sub-10 nm NiCo2S4 nanoparticles on a graphene matrix would give rise to superior supercapacitive performance.5
Herein, we demonstrate a facile two-step method based on a hydrothermal reaction followed by a heat treatment process to synthesize core–shell structured NiCo2S4 encapsulated in ultrathin graphene layers (NiCo2S4@G). A hybrid supercapacitor based on a NiCo2S4@G positive electrode and a porous carbon negative electrode in a 2 M KOH alkaline electrolyte exhibited a high energy density of 43.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 254.3 W kg−1 based on the total mass of positive and negative electrode materials. Even at a high discharge current density of 10 A g−1, an energy density as high as 18.3 W h kg−1 was retained at a power of density 2538.4 W kg−1. The device also displayed stable cycling performance with 83.4% retention of specific capacitance after 5000 cycles.
Experimental
The NiCo2S4@G material was prepared through a simple two-step process. Details are given in the following steps. Firstly, the highly-uniform solid (Ni,Co)EDTA precursor was synthesized by a bottom-up method. By using thioacetamide (TAA) as the sulfur source, the precursor was then chemically transformed into (NiCo2S4)–(H4EDTA). Finally, NiCo2S4@G was obtained after being annealed at 550 °C for 2 h in an N2 atmosphere. All the reagents were analytical grade.
Synthesis of the (Ni,Co)EDTA precursors
All the chemicals were directly used after purchase without further purification. In a typical synthesis, (Ni,Co)EDTA was synthesized through a bottom-up method. An aqueous solution with 15 mL of Ni(NO3)2 (0.4 mol L−1) and Co(NO3)2 (0.8 mol L−1) was mixed with 15 mL Na4EDTA (0.6 mol L−1) and 10 mL methanol, and then the mixed solution was enclosed in a 50 mL stainless steel autoclave followed by processing at 200 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the blue precipitate was harvested via filtration and washed with deionized water at least 4 times to remove the NaNO3 before being fully dried in air at 80 °C for 12 h. The reaction for the synthesis of the (Ni,Co)EDTA precursors can be described by eqn (1): 2Ni(NO3)2 + 4Co(NO3)2 + 3Na4EDTA → (Ni,2Co)2(EDTA)3 + 12NaNO3(1)
Synthesis of the NiCo2S4@G nanocomposites
For the formation of NiCo2S4@G, 300 mg of the above (Ni,Co)EDTA precursors was re-dispersed into 40 mL of ethanol, followed by the addition of 0.5 g of thioacetamide (TAA). Thereafter, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was subsequently heated at 120 °C for 6 h. After being filtered and rinsed with ethanol several times, EDTA–NiCo2S4 was obtained. The reactions can be described by eqn (2)–(4): CH3CSNH2 + C2H5OH → CH3(NH2)C(OC2H5)–SH(2) CH3(NH2)C(OC2H5)–SH + C2H5OH → CH3(NH2)C(OC2H5)2 + H2S(3) H2S + (Ni,2Co)2(EDTA)3 → (NiCo2S4)–(H4EDTA)(4)
At the end, the obtained products were annealed under N2 at 550 °C for 2 h to get the Ni–Co mixed metal sulfur coated by ultrathin graphene (NiCo2S4@G). During the annealing process, (NiCo2S4)–(H4EDTA) was decomposed, and generated Cx species. These Cx species were further transferred to graphene shells around the NiCo2S4 nanoparticles, which finally led to the unique structure of graphene shells on NiCo2S4. In order to remove the insecure and exposed particles, all the NiCo2S4@G samples were treated in 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution at 80 °C for 4 h followed by a process of repeatedly filtering and washing with deionized water.
Results and discussion
The morphology of NiCo2S4@G was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Fig. 1a–c and f). The TEM images show that the prepared sample is composed of highly uniform nanoparticles (Fig. 1a and b). High-magnification TEM images indicate that the nanoparticles have a uniform size of about 5–7 nm. The observed lattice fringe of 0.283 nm can be indexed to the [311] plane of NiCo2S4 (Fig. 1c and f). Each nanoparticle is wrapped in a thin layer of graphene shell which prevents aggregation and also acts as an electronic network for individual particles. The graphene shell consists of only 3–5 layers. Element mapping by EDS indicates that the elements (Ni, Co, S and C) are distributed homogeneously over the nanoparticles (Fig. 1e), further confirming that NiCo2S4@G has a uniform structure.

The Raman spectrum of NiCo2S4@G was recorded and is shown in Fig. 2a. The peaks at 1340 cm−1 and at around 1618 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum are in good agreement with the D band and G band (in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon atoms) of graphene, respectively.24 The G band is associated with the doubly degenerate phonon mode (E2g mode) at the Brillouin zone center. In fact, the G band is the only band coming from a normal first-order Raman scattering process in graphene.25 The ratio of the intensity of the D-band and G-band (ID/IG) reflects the order of the defects in graphene and is usually utilized to evaluate the disordered crystal structures of graphene.26 Combined with the TEM results, it suggests that the shell of the nanoparticle is composed of 3–5 layers of graphene. EDS elemental analysis (ESI Fig. S3†) shows that the ratio of graphene in the composite is 45.5 at%.

Fig. 2b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the synthesized composites. The diffraction peaks at 16.3°, 26.8°, 31.5°, 38.3°, 47.2°, 50.4°, 55.2°, 65.0°, 69.2°, 78.1°, and 82.1° can be indexed to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), (440), (533), (444), (731) and (800) planes of NiCo2S4, respectively (JCPDS card no. 20-0782).20,27 Based on the TEM results, Raman spectrum and XRD pattern, it can be concluded that the synthesized material can be described as NiCo2S4@graphene with a core–shell structure. The absence of the characteristic diffraction peak of graphene is probably due to the ultrathin shell thickness.28
The electrochemical properties of the synthesized samples were assessed in a three-electrode system using NiCo2S4@G (or porous carbon: PC) as a working electrode, nickel grid as a counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The PC material was prepared based on carbonization of MOF-5 in a N2 atmosphere according to the procedure reported previously.29 Details of the preparation process of the electrochemical cell are given in the ESI† (Experimental section). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) results show that PC has a high specific surface area of around 2600 m2 g−1 (ESI Fig. S2†). The three-electrode configuration was tested using a 2.0 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. Fig. 3a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves for the NiCo2S4@G and PC electrodes at different scan rates from 2 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1. The NiCo2S4@G electrode exhibits a pair of redox peaks at 0.43 and 0.30 V, corresponding to the redox reactions of NiCo2S4.11 With a 25-fold increase in the sweep rate from 2 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1, there is still no significant change in the position and shape of the current peaks in the CV plot. This suggests that the NiCo2S4@G electrode has excellent kinetics for the fast redox reactions, which can be attributed to the small Rct of the NiCo2S4@G electrode (see ESI Fig. S1†). The redox reaction mechanism of NiCo2S4 in an alkaline electrolyte involves the formation of NiSOH, CoSOH, and CoSO through the reversible charge transfer process, which can be described by eqn (5)–(7):10 CoS + OH− ↔ CoSOH + e−(5) CoSOH + OH− ↔ CoSO + H2O + e−(6) NiS + OH− ↔ NiSOH + e−(7)

During the charging process, ionic diffusion into the NiCo2S4 lattice and conversion reactions take place, which are the key sources of the pseudocapacitance. Of course, the pseudocapacitance from the conversion reactions is much larger than that from ionic diffusion. In addition, superfluous ions will form an electrochemical double layer capacitance on the surface of the graphene shell.
In contrast, the CV curve of the PC electrode (Fig. 3a) in the range −0.9–0 V (vs. the SCE) has a typical rectangular shape, indicating ideal double-layer capacitive features.27 As the scan rate increases from 2 to 50 mV s−1, the CV curve of the PC electrode still retains a rectangular shape. This phenomenon suggests that the PC electrode also has excellent rate performance.
Rate capability is a critical parameter for assessing the application potential of a supercapacitor in practice. As shown in Fig. 3b, the plateaus in the charging–discharging curves at the different discharge current densities of 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 A g−1 indicate the existence of a faradaic process, which is consistent with the CV results. The charging–discharging curves are approximately symmetric, suggesting that the NiCo2S4@G nanoparticle electrode has good electrochemical performance and allows superior reversible redox reactions.
The specific capacitance of the NiCo2S4@G nanoparticle electrode and the PC electrode was calculated from the galvanostatic charging–discharging curves at the current densities of 1–10 A g−1. As exhibited in Fig. 3d, the NiCo2S4@G nanoparticles have good electrochemical properties. A specific capacitance of 1432.5 F g−1 is obtained at a current density of 1 A g−1. With the increase of current density, the specific capacitance decreases slightly. At 10 A g−1, the specific capacitance of 719.2 F g−1 is retained with the NiCo2S4@G electrode. The charging–discharging curves of the PC electrode materials (Fig. 3c) have a symmetric triangular shape, a characteristic typically associated with electric double layer capacitance (EDLC). The PC electrode shows excellent rate capability with a small change in specific capacitance from 191.1 to 165 F g−1 with the increase in discharging current density from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1.
The asymmetric supercapacitor composed of PC/KOH/NiCo2S4@G was fabricated using NiCo2S4@G nanoparticles as the positive electrode and PC as the negative electrode in a 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte solution. According to eqn (5)–(7), the NiCo2S4 nanoparticles are transformed to NiSOH, CoSOH, and CoSO in the alkaline electrolyte26 during charging, and meanwhile ions are adsorbed on the PC electrode surface to form an electric double layer. The reaction is completely reversed during discharging. Before the fabrication of the asymmetric supercapacitor PC/KOH/NiCo2S4@G, an appropriate optimization of the electrode mass loadings was carried out. As shown in eqn (8), the charge stored by each electrode usually depends on the specific capacitance (Csp), the potential range (U) and the mass of active materials (m):21 Q = Csp × U × m(8)
In order to obtain Q+ = Q−, the mass balancing will be expressed as eqn (9): (9)where Q is the capacitance and the subscripts “+” and “−” represent the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Based on the specific capacitances of NiCo2S4@G nanoparticles and PC in their designed working potential range and current densities of 1–10 A g−1, the optimal mass ratio between NiCo2S4@G and the PC electrode (m+/m−) is determined to be between 0.27 and 0.46 depending on the current density. In this study, the designated mass ratio of the asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor was 0.37.
As shown in Fig. 4a, the galvanostatic charging–discharging curve of the positive electrode (NiCo2S4@G) exhibits a potential region of 0–0.45 V (vs. the SCE, red line). Also, the curve of the PC negative electrode is linear in the potential region of −0.9–0 V (vs. the SCE, blue line). As such, the best operational voltage window for the full PC/KOH/NiCo2S4@G supercapacitor was determined to be in the range 0–1.35 V (black line). The less ideal linear nature of the charging–discharging curve is due to the combination of a battery-type NiCo2S4@G electrode and carbon-based EDLC electrode, and it is a typical feature of a hybrid supercapacitor.

Specific capacitances and energy densities were calculated based on the total mass of the negative and positive electrode materials. 
The charging–discharging curves of the PC/KOH/NiCo2S4@G supercapacitor at different current densities are shown in Fig. 4b. Complete charging and discharging is achieved within 50 seconds at a current density of 10 A g−1, suggesting that the asymmetric hybrid PC/KOH/NiCo2S4@G supercapacitor has excellent power density performance. The highest specific capacitance of 170.7 F g −1 based on the mass of two electrode materials was achieved at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 4c). When the current density increases to 10 A g−1, the specific capacitance remains at 72.1 F g−1, which is 42.2% of the initial capacitance. The charge/discharge curves were also utilized to evaluate the power and energy density of the supercapacitor. The Ragone plot of the supercapacitor is shown in Fig. 4d with various current densities from 1 to 10 A g−1. The energy and power densities were calculated based on the total mass of both electrodes. The highest energy density obtained with the device was 43.4 W h kg−1 at a low power density of 254.3 W kg−1, which is comparable to the performance of lithium-ion capacitors. In addition, the device still demonstrates an energy density of 18.3 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 2538 W kg−1. By comparison with the previous reports as summarized in Table 1, NiCo2S4@G nanoparticles as a positive electrode for a supercapacitor show much better electrochemical performance.

The cycling stability of the NiCo2S4@G electrode was tested at a current density of 10 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 5, after 100 cycles, the charging and discharging specific capacitances were slightly increased (increasing from 100 to 102.4% compared with the initial capacitances) with a specific capacitance of 73 F g−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1. The specific capacitance retention rate is 83.4% and the coulombic efficiency is above 98% after 5000 cycles. This is superior to that recently reported for GS//NiCo2S4 (88.3% after 1000 cycles),18 AC//NiCo2S4@PPy (72.1% after 3000 cycles),31 AC//NiCo2S4 nanoboxes (75.0% after 5000 cycles),32 and AC//NiCo2S4 nanowires (78.5% after 3000 cycles).34 To the best of our knowledge, there are limited numbers of reports of good cycling performance for NiCo2S4 electrode materials. The main reason for our superior results is that the graphene layers provide in situ protection for the NiCo2S4 nanoparticles during the charging/discharging process, which significantly reduces their dissolution in the electrolyte. In addition, the hollow spaces between graphene and the NiCo2S4 nanoparticles can buffer potential volume changes during the charging/discharging process. These two factors lead to the good cycling performance of the NiCo2S4@G material.

Conclusions
In summary, a method for encapsulating NiCo2S4 nanoparticles in ultrathin graphene shells was developed. The asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor composed of a NiCo2S4@G core–shell structure as a positive electrode and porous carbon as a negative electrode demonstrated impressive performance. Electrochemical measurements revealed an ultra-high energy density of 43.4 W h kg−1 and good cycling stability with a specific capacitance retention of 83.4% after 5000 cycles. This work suggests that the critical role of the graphene shell in the NiCo2S4 material can be ascribed to two aspects: (1) it protects the NiCo2S4 nanoparticles from dissolution and (2) it buffers potential volume changes during the cycling process.
