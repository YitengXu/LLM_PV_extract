    , Accepted 14th May 2019First published on 16th May 2019AbstractHollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@N-doped carbon (HZCS@NC) electrode with hierarchical pores structure synthesized by a continuous ingenious method is presented in response of the demand of high-performance supercapacitors. The formation mechanism of the hollow structure, in which the Zn0.76Co0.24S nanoparticles were embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon layer, was analyzed in this work. This electrode exhibits an excellent specific capacity of 937 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a satisfying capacity retention rate of about 112% after 40000 cycles at a rate of 5 A g−1. Such preeminent performance is realized via (1) the short electrolyte diffusion length caused by the hollow structure, (2) the high electrochemical activities provide by the bimetallic sulfide and heteroatom doping, (3) the efficient combination of faradaic and electrical double layer materials, and (4) the conductive network with multiple holes. The evaluation of electrochemical performance of the assembled HZCS@NC//RGO hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was also done. Impressively, the HSC gives a satisfactory energy density of 55.47 W h kg−1, a maximum power density of 16.55 kW kg−1, and an ultra-long (100000) cycling life (108.9% retention of the initial capacity). This study presents a novel strategy for engineering stable poly-porous multicomponent hollow structures for the fabrication of prospective energy storage devices.
Introduction
Energy conversion and storage devices such as supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells are key components for satisfying the ever-growing demand for electric vehicles and personal electronics.1–4 For the past few years, efficient supercapacitors have attracted tremendous attentions owing to their high power density, long cycle life, fast response, and high security compared to other devices.5,6 However, low energy density is a serious obstacle for supercapacitors in satisfying the requirements of extensive practical applications.7,8 Exploiting and engineering the advanced electrode materials with tailored composition and architecture could be the intensive research orientations to overcome this obstacle and deliver high-performance supercapacitors.9
Past developments of electrode materials have identified traditional carbon materials as primary electrical double layer materials for electrochemical supercapacitors but unsatisfactory specific capacitance limits their further applications.10,11 However, although such electrical double layer capacitors (EDLC) only store energy by adsorbing charges on the surface, they possess high stability in long-term cycling tests owing to the non-chemical process. Other current electrode materials provide much higher specific capacity through faradaic reactions occurring near the interface, for instance, transition metal oxides12,13/hydroxides14 and conductive polymers.15 Particularly, transition metal sulfides as the newly fashioned faradaic materials have been put forward as appropriate electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their desirable features such as high electrical conductivity and theoretical capacity.16–19 More specifically, the sulfide ion will supply a lower electronegativity for the electrode materials, which can generate a resilient structure with rapid electron migration compared with the oxygen ion. The cobalt sulfides have been employed as ideal candidates for electrode materials in supercapacitors because of the high theoretical specific capacity caused by the Co2+/Co3+ and Co3+/Co4+ ideal faradaic transitions. However, the conductivity, rate capability, and cycling stability of the cobalt sulfides need to be further enhanced. Further, the bimetallic sulfides with richer redox chemistry and higher electrochemical activity will deliver superior electrochemical performance compared to the monometallic sulfides or homogeneous oxides (e.g., zinc cobalt oxide).20,21 Also, the addition of the second metal ion can adjust the electronic structure and optimize the band gap, which can improve the electrochemical conductivity and benefit the rate capability. Zn has a stronger coordination ability and higher redox reaction kinetics. So, the combination of Zn and Co is rational and favorable, which can not only deliver outstanding specific capacitance but also a preferable rate capability. However, bimetallic sulfides will seriously suffer from oxidation in alkaline electrolytes, which impairs the conductivity and stability during prolonged cycling.22,23 Therefore, in theory, exploiting harmonious composites that combine carbon materials with bimetallic sulfides is a promising strategy to achieve both high specific capacity and long cycle life.24
Moreover, establishing reasonable and robust architectures is helpful in realizing the full potential of each component. Recently, hollow nanostructures have drawn more attention in the field of energy storage compared with their solid counterparts as they deliver low mass density, large specific surface area, fast charge transport, and high surface permeability.25–27 Based on many efforts and explorations to establish the practical hollow materials, self-templated methods stand out for the synthesis of such materials as they are convenient. Here, the precursor is directly transformed into the hollow structures without the tedious step of removing templates, which is otherwise required in hard- and soft-templated methods.22,28–30 By virtue of their specific morphologies, zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIF) are perceived as suitable templates as well as metal sources for the construction of hollow materials.31–33 As the most common ZIFs, ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 possess the same crystal structures and similar lattice parameters, and are made of cobalt or zinc ions and the organic ligand methyl imidazole.34,35 Owing to their similarities, combining these two ZIFs is easy and the formed bimetal–organic framework ZIF-67/8 with multivariate components appears promising for generating highly electroactive electrodes.20 Besides, the hollow structure with multiple pores will further achieve the full potential of the active materials and accelerate ion transport but will also face exacerbation of the ever-present instability during the charging and discharging processes.36 Thus, building hollow materials with high electrochemical performance while maintaining the integrity of the structure is a research challenge that still needs to be overcome.36
To address the barriers described above, self-templated hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@N-doped carbon (HZCS@NC) particles were fabricated by dopamine coating and subsequent anion exchange technique in this work. Particularly, with the dissociation of ZIF-67/8 particles and the polymerization of dopamine, a part of the precursors was caught in the polydopamine layer. The following annealing and sulfuration steps convert these to Zn0.76Co0.24S nanoparticles, which were trapped in the hollow nitrogen-doped (N-doped) carbon layer. The perfect combination of the transition bimetallic sulfides and heteroatom doped carbon made this an outstanding active material for high performance supercapacitors. The hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@N-doped carbon electrode expresses a high specific capacity of about 937 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and remarkable cycling stability (112% retention after 40000 cycles). The hybrid supercapacitor assembled with reduced graphene oxide achieved an excellent energy density up to 55.47 W h kg−1 at a power density of 795.54 W kg−1. This ingenious approach, which establishes a robust hollow structure with plentiful cavities and combines the bimetallic sulfide efficiently with the N-doped carbon, is an effective way to prepare a new generation of active materials for energy storage devices.
Experimental section
Synthesis of ZIF-67/8 crystals
Typically, 0.291 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.595 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 20 mL methanol. Meanwhile, 0.985 g 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 15 mL methanol. After magnetic stirring for 20 min, the two solutions were mixed together and aged at room temperature for 24 h. The synthetic Zn–Co metal–organic framework (MOF) was extracted from methanol by centrifugation at 6000 rad min−1 for 3 min and then washed with methanol three times.
Synthesis of hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC
First, a 10 mM Tris–HCl solution was prepared and pH was adjusted to 8.5 by adding NaOH solution dropwise. Then, 100 mL Tris–HCl solution was transferred to a 250 mL volumetric beaker, and 100 mg dopamine hydrochloride (DAH) and 150 mg ZIF-67/8 were added. After ultrasonic treatment and stirring for 24 h, the polydopamine coated Zn–Co MOF (ZIF@PDA) was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rad min−1 for 3 min, washed with deionized water (DI water) and anhydrous alcohol successively at least six times in total, and finally dried at 70 °C for 6 h. The polydopamine coated Zn–Co MOF was processed by annealing at 600 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in nitrogen, and the product thus obtained was named core–shell Co3ZnC@C (CCZC@NC). To synthesize the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC (HZCS@NC), the CCZC@NC was dispersed in 35 mL 0.1 M Na2S in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 120 °C for 8 h.
As reference materials, samples prepared by omitting the dopamine polymerization step were also synthesized to contrast with the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC. Thus, the ZIF-67/8 was directly annealed and sulfurized (named as Zn0.76Co0.24S, ZCS for short). The protective effect of the polydopamine layer on the ZIF-67/8 particles in alkaline environment was confirmed by completing the full synthesis without adding DAH to the ZIF suspension in alkaline Tris–HCl (named as destructive Zn0.76Co0.24S, DZCS for short), as opposed to that in the synthesis of hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC.
Materials' characterization
The morphologies were studied with scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM with EDS, JSM-7800F). The crystal structures were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Dmaxrc diffractometer) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2800, 200 kV; Tecnai G2 T20, 200 kV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Thermo-Scientific system. Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw InVia Reflex using a 633 nm laser. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analyses were performed on an ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics, USA) through nitrogen adsorption/desorption testing after degassing the samples. Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out on a Mettler Toledo TGA 1, performed in air condition from 30 to 900 °C (at a rate of 10 °C min−1).
Electrochemical tests
The electrochemical properties of the single electrode were characterized using a three-electrode system in 6 M KOH, with a Pt wire as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared as follows. The synthesized active materials, hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC or the contrast samples were mixed with carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in a mass ratio of 8:1:1 using ethanol as the solvent. After stirring for 3 h, the slurry was coated on pre-processed Ni foam and dried at 70 °C for 6 h. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV) were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, Shanghai Chen Hua Instrument Factory).
The gravimetric specific capacity (Cg, C g−1) of the electrode materials was calculated by the GCD curves, according to the following equation: (1)in which, I (A) is the discharge current, Δt (s) is the discharge time, and m (g) is the mass of the electrode materials.
Assembly of hybrid supercapacitor
To fabricate a hybrid supercapacitor, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was prepared as the negative electrode material (detailed information of the RGO can be found in our previous work37). The graphene oxide solution passed through the steps of dilution, freeze-drying, and reduction by annealing at 350 °C for 2 h in argon. The RGO was coated on the Ni foam in the same way as for preparing the positive electrode and the negative electrode was formed. The negative electrode was covered by laboratory filter paper to prevent short circuit. After injection of a moderate electrolyte (6 M KOH) and encapsulation, the hybrid supercapacitor with a flexible package was operational. The gravimetric specific capacity (CHSC,g) of the device was calculated by the same method of for the single electrode, only based on the whole mass of the negative and positive materials. The energy density (E) and power density (P) were calculated as follows: (2) (3)in which, t (s) represents the time of the discharge curve, I (A) is the current, m (g) is the total mass of the positive and negative electrodes, and V (V) is the potential window.
Results and discussion
Structural characterization
The synthetic strategy for preparing hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC is demonstrated in Fig. 1a. Firstly, the preparation of homogeneous ZIF-67/8 particles was realized by mixing the metallic ions with organic linkers and then aging for 24 h at room temperature. The rhombic dodecahedron structure of the ZIF-67/8 was characterized by SEM and TEM, as shown in Fig. 1b and e. Each particle shows a smooth surface and integrated shape, which is 300 nm in side length, and a uniform internal structure. After the polymerization and coating of dopamine, the ZIF@PDA particles displayed a core–shell structure with less sharp corners and edges (Fig. S1†). The ZIF-67/8 particles partially decomposed in this process, which is a common phenomenon in alkaline environment (pH = 8.5), as previously reported.38–40 From the TEM images of the selected precursors at different time intervals (6 h, 12 h, 18 h, 24 h) during the coating process (Fig. S2†), a special process for dopamine polymerization and ZIF decomposition can be easily observed. As time proceeds, the polydopamine shell thickened and the ZIF-67/8 core diminished, in which the floccules adhering to the polydopamine shell grew and became more defined in shape. Then, the transformation of ZIF@PDA to CCZC@NC was realized by annealing at 600 °C, which can also be confirmed by the TGA curve (Fig. S3†).41 After heat treatment, the CCZC@NC intermediate still maintained the basic morphology of ZIF@PDA (Fig. 1c) but with Co3ZnC nanoparticles caught in the carbon shell (from PDA) and the core (from ZIF-67/8), which was clearly evident from the TEM images (Fig. 1f). Finally, the HZCS@NC electrode was successfully synthesized with the original polyhedron structure retained (Fig. 1d). The anion exchange step further converted the core–shell construction to a hollow one (Fig. 1g).21,42 Moreover, the SEM and TEM images of the reference samples are also shown in Fig. S4.† Without the protection of polydopamine, the structural integrity of the DZCS particles is lost in the alkaline environment (Fig. S4a and b†). Without the coating process of dopamine, the ZCS product shows a solid structure with a wrinkled surface (Fig. S4c and d†).

In the XRD patterns (Fig. 1h), the crystal structures of the intermediates generated in the course of preparing HZCS@NC and the reference samples can be observed clearly. The red line shows the crystalline phase of ZIF-67/8, which agrees well with the other reported works,43,44 thus verifying the successful synthesis of the precursor. It is noteworthy that the ZIF peak intensities for ZIF@PDA are reduced after the coating process compared with the pure ZIF-67/8 (Fig. S5†), which is due to the simultaneous PDA encapsulation and ZIF-67/8 decomposition. The crystalline phase of CCZC@NC was verified by the blue curve (Fig. 1h). The distinct peaks at 41.50°, 48.49°, and 71.07° correspond to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Co3ZnC (JCPDS card no. 29-0524).44 The other broad peaks at 25.71° and 44.21° point to the (002) and (100) planes of coated carbon (JCPDS card no. 41-1487).45 In the curve of HZCS@NC, the diffraction peaks at 28.64°, 33.19°, 47.64°, 56.54°, and 76.98° correspond to the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (331) planes of the cubic phase Zn0.76Co0.24S (JCPDS card no. 47-1656). The other peaks (colour bar) that obviously belong to the carbon layer came from polydopamine, which is similar to that of CCZC@NC. In contrast, for ZCS (Fig. S6†), the crystalline phase can be ascribed to Zn0.76Co0.24S and the XRD diffraction peaks of carbon are not so obvious.
TEM and high-resolution (HR) TEM images of hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC have been shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a verifies the details of the hollow structure and it is exactly synthesized in a series of procedures. The thickness of the carbon layer in HZCS@NC is about 27 nm (Fig. 2b), which agrees with the result of SEM (Fig. S7†). The Zn0.76Co0.24S nanoparticles with a mean diameter of about 10 nm are immobilized in the N-doped carbon layer. The lattice spacings of about 0.361 nm and 0.163 nm conform to the (111) and (311) planes of Zn0.76Co0.24S, respectively (Fig. 2c). This result agrees exactly with the SEM and XRD results. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) elemental mappings (Fig. 2d and e) show that Zn, Co, S, C, and N are distributed uniformly in the particles.

The specific surface area of the electrode materials have significant influence on the electrochemical reactions and can be evaluated by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The pore size distribution obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method is also remarkable for understanding the electrochemical performance. Although the high surface area likely provides more redox active sites, ZIF-67/8 and solid Zn0.76Co0.24S are not the optimal choices because the pores with very small size are not proper for fast electrochemical reactions (Fig. S8†), which is also confirmed by the electrochemical tests discussed later. HZCS@NC (38.03 m2 g−1) delivers a higher specific surface area compared with CCZC@NC (34.38 m2 g−1); the pore diameters of these two materials are mainly distributed in the range of 2.5 to 5 nm (Fig. 3a). In addition, HZCS@NC possesses some other pores with diameters of 7.5, 9.4, and 15 nm (Fig. 3b). Such a hierarchical pore distribution is more favorable for ion transport and could give rise to high rate capability.46 This sequence of synthetic steps transforms the bimetallic MOF into a hollow structure with hierarchical pore structure, which can not only transmit the electrolyte rapidly but can also deliver a low electrical resistance and high specific capacity. It can be perceived as a universal technique to prepare analogous outstanding structures using different MOF precursors for progressive energy storage devices.

Raman spectroscopy is commonly used to evaluate the defects and characters of the carbon materials. The peaks at about 1322.14 and 1581.33 cm−1 shown in the spectra of every sample typically belong to the D and G band of carbon materials (Fig. S9†), which correspond to the lattice defects and sp2 hybridization of the carbon atoms, respectively.47 The intensity ratios of the D to G band for HZCS@NC (0.85) and CCZC@NC (0.82) are higher than that of the solid Zn0.76Co0.24S (0.66), indicating more doping and defects in the dopamine coated materials.48
The XPS measurements were conducted to detect the elemental composition and chemical valence states of the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC. The survey spectrum shows the existence of Zn, Co, S, C, and N (Fig. S10†). The elemental ratios measured by XPS spectroscopy agree with the result of XRD, as shown in Table S1.† The ratios tested by EDS are also shown in Fig. S11.† As shown in Fig. 3c, the obvious peaks in the Zn 2p region at about 1045.2 and 1022.1 eV indicate the presence of Zn2+.37 In the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 3d), there are two spin–orbit doublets (Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2) and two satellites (803.47 and 786.56 eV, marked as Sat.). The binding energies 797.7 and 781.7 eV of Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 peaks point to the existence of the Co2+ and the binding energies at 795.0 and 778.8 eV are ascribed to Co3+.17,20 The co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ can be ascribed to the hydrogen sulfide generated from sodium sulfide during the process of sulfuration.21 The spectrum of S 2p expresses the metal–sulfur bond and a satellite peak (168.61 eV, Fig. 3e). The peaks at 163.9 and 162.3 eV are attributed to the Zn–S bond, and binding energies of 162.93 and 161.83 eV correspond to the Co–S bond. Four peaks can be observed in the C 1s spectrum in Fig. 3f, viz., 288.9, 287.0, 285.8, and 284.7 eV, which are indexed to the CO, C–O, C–N, and C–C bonds, respectively.49 Among them, the C–N bond proves the existence of nitrogen doping, which can be further confirmed by the N 1s spectrum in Fig. 3g. The pyridinic N (398.7 eV), pyrrolic N (400.1 eV), graphitic N (401.2 eV), and oxide N (402.2 eV) are all shown to be present in the electrode materials (Fig. 3h).49 The N 1s Gaussian fitting of the solid ZCS also was analyzed for comparison, as shown in Fig. S12.† The proportion of graphitic N in HZCS@NC was higher than that of the solid ZCS because the benzene ring in dopamine increased its formation, which can improve the conductivity of the electrode, as previously reported.50–52 High contents of the pyridinic and pyrrolic N and defects in the HZCS@NC electrode can improve the electrochemical activity of the active materials and are favorable for developing an excellent property.45,53,54
Electrochemical performance in the three-electrode system
The electrochemical performance of the active materials, HZCS@NC, solid Zn0.76Co0.24S, and CCZC@NC was tested by coating them on nickel foam. The CV curves of these three electrodes at 20 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 4a. All the electrode materials show analogous shapes with one pair of obvious redox peaks, demonstrating the faradaic behaviour. In addition, the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC provided overall higher currents, suggesting a higher specific capacity.55 Combing the result of XPS measurement and previous reports, the reaction within the energy storage system of HZCS@NC can be understood through the following equations:56–58 CoS + OH− ⇔ CoSOH + e−(4) CoSOH + OH− ⇔ CoSO + H2O + e−(5) ZnS + OH− ⇔ ZnSOH + e−(6) C–OH + OH− ⇔ CO + H2O + e−(7) –COOH + OH− ⇔ –COO + H2O + e−(8) CH–NH2 + 2OH− ⇔ CNH + 2H2O + 2e−(9) C–NH2 + 2OH− ⇔ C–NHOH + H2O + 2e−(10)

(h) EIS spectra of HZCS@NC, ZCS, and CCZC@NC. (i) Cycling stability of the HZCS@NC electrode for 40000 cycles (inset: CV curves of the last five cycles). 
Simultaneously, CV curves of the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC at different scan rates were also obtained, as shown in Fig. 4b. The drastically increased area and slight shift of the redox peaks can be observed at increased scan rates, which attest the high rate capability and electrode polarization at high scan rates, respectively.59 The CV curves of Zn0.76Co0.24S and the hollow Co3ZnC@C are also shown in Fig. S13.† Further, the electrochemical reaction kinetics can be analyzed from the CV curves. The response currents (i) and scan rates (v) of every electrode can be fitted in the equations as follows:37,60 i = avb(11) logi = blogv + loga(12)
The undetermined parameters a and b can be calculated by the fitted curves (eqn (12)) and the value of b is used to distinguish the electrochemical behaviour of the electrode. More specifically, b = 0.5 means a diffusion-controlled process and b = 1 indicates a surface-controlled behaviour. The calculated b values of these three electrodes fall between 0.5 and 1, indicating the co-existence of diffusion- and surface-controlled processes (Fig. 4c, Table S2†).61 The hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC expresses more diffusion-controlled behaviour and the contributions of the two mechanisms are calculated approximately by the following equations:62 i = k1v + k2v1/2(13) i/v1/2 = k1v1/2 + k2(14)
The proportional graphs of hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC are shown in Fig. 4d. At each scan rate, the diffusion-controlled process occupies a large proportion (88–71.9%), which agrees with the former conclusions.
The comparison of GCD curves at a current density of 1 A g−1 among hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC, Zn0.76Co0.24S, and hollow Co3ZnC@C is shown in Fig. 4e. It is obvious that the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC possesses the longest discharging time, indicating a superior electrochemical performance. The plateaus shown by these electrode materials reinforce the conclusion that they are all faradaic materials. The GCD curves at different current densities of the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC (Fig. 4f), Zn0.76Co0.24S, and hollow Co3ZnC@C (Fig. S14†) were also tested to quantify the specific capacity of the active materials. Fig. 4g expresses that the comparison among the specific capacity of different electrode materials varies with the increasing in current density. The calculated specific capacities of HZCS@NC at current densities from 1 to 20 A g−1 are about 937 to 524.7 C g−1 (2082.22 to 1166 F g−1), which are higher than that of the solid Zn0.76Co0.24S (329.99 to 158.67 C g−1) and CCZC@NC (285.3 to 135 C g−1). The hollow structure and the superiority of the bimetallic sulfides lead to significantly better electrochemical performance than the reference materials (Table S3†).
The electrode kinetics and internal resistances were analyzed by EIS in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz, which are beneficial for further understanding of the intrinsic difference between these electrode materials. Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4h, which show a semicircle in the high frequency region (charge transfer resistance, Rct), the intercept of the semicircle with the horizontal axis (intrinsic resistance, RS), and a straight line with a slope in the low frequency region (diffusion resistance, RW). The small diameter of the semicircle (Rct) for HZCS@NC indicates a more convenient charge transfer. The different quantitative values of RS for different electrodes indicate the diversity in the internal resistance, with the smallest resistance for HZCS@NC (0.83 Ω for HZCS@NC, 1.01 Ω for CCZC@NC, and 1.02 Ω for ZCS). Furthermore, the large slope of the line for the HZCS@NC indicates a lower RW, which means that the hollow porous structure can improve the diffusion of the electrolyte. The lower resistance and faster ion transfer of HZCS@NC are mainly attributed to the hollow nanocages with hierarchical pores, the graphitic N due to polydopamine, and the bimetallic sulfide nanoparticles contacted by the carbon layer.

Fig. 4i presents the cycling stability of the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC at a current density of 5 A g−1. In the first 20000 cycles, the electrolyte gradually permeated to the inner parts of the electrode and HZCS@NC achieved its full electrochemical potential in sufficient time.63 The structure consisting of faradaic materials (Zn0.76Co0.24S) embedded in the carbon layer delivers an ultra-long cycle life compared with other reported composites (Table S3†), with a retention rate of 112% even after 40000 cycles. The morphology of HZCS@NC after uninterrupted cycling is well maintained, which further corroborates the high stability (Fig. S15†). To eliminate the influence of Ni foam in long-term cycling, the cycling stability of the pure Ni foam was also tested (Fig. S16†). Although the activation of the Ni foam occurred in the cycling, however, it was fully activated in the first 100 cycles, which means that the continuous activation of the electrode is mainly related to the active materials. This kind of method is envisioned to synthesize the electrode materials for energy storage devices with the desirable cycling stability.
The remarkable electrochemical performance of the HZCS@NC electrode can be ascribed to the combination of characteristics as follow (Fig. 5). The faradaic material Zn0.76Co0.24S with rich valence states delivers a high theoretical specific capacity and expresses a lower electronegativity compared to the oxide/carbide counterparts. The multi-type nitrogen doping enhances the electrochemical activity and the conductivity of the carbon layer. The inside and outside of the active materials can both contact conveniently with the electrolyte, which benefit from the ion collected effect of the hollow nanocages. Besides, the ion and charge transport network, which is constructed by the conductive porous carbon layer, reduces the resistance and facilitates the electrochemical reactions. Therefore, the synergies of the aforementioned characteristics contribute to an outstanding HZCS@NC electrode for high performance supercapacitors.

Electrochemical performance of the hybrid supercapacitor
The potential of the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC in practical applications was verified by assembling a hybrid device (Fig. S17†). The electrochemical performance of RGO was also evaluated to match with the positive materials. The CV and GCD responses of RGO are shown in Fig. S18.† The nearly rectangular CV curves and linear GCD curves exhibit the typical electrical double layer characteristics of RGO. The specific capacitances of RGO calculated by the GCD curves at various current densities are shown in Fig. S19,† which can reach up to 300 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and exhibit a retention of about 62% from 1 to 20 A g−1. The stored charges of the positive and negative electrodes are balanced as follows:64 Q = m × Cg(15) (16)
It is clear that the mass ratio is related to the specific capacity and the voltage window of the corresponding electrode. The CV curves of RGO (−1 to 0 V) and the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC (0–0.6 V) at 20 mV s−1 are presented in Fig. 6a. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor can possibly possess a voltage window of about 1.6 V and deliver both the electrical double layer capacitive and faradaic performance. The CV curves of the fabricated HSC at various voltage windows at 20 mV s−1 (Fig. 6b) show that the operating window can reach up to 1.6 V. In the curve at 1.8 V, the polarization phenomenon indicates the end of the voltage extension. The CV curves of the assembled hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC//RGO HSC at various scan rates are shown in Fig. 6c. The non-standard shapes of the CV curves at each scan rate evidence the close association of the electrical double layer and faradaic charge storage mechanisms. Moreover, the GCD curves also confirm the hybrid electrochemical contribution (Fig. 6d). The specific capacitances and coulombic efficiencies of the HSC at different current densities can be calculated from the GCD curves, as shown in Fig. 6e. The HSC device delivers a specific capacity of about 251.01 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, maintains 144.21 C g−1 at 20 A g−1, and also delivers a high coulombic efficiency (96%).

(g) Cycling stability of the HZCS@NC//RGO HSC for 100000 cycles (inset: the CV curves of the first and last five cycles, and the devices driven by two devices in series). 
The energy density and power density are the key factors to evaluate the properties of HSC. The comparison of the assembled HZCS@NC//RGO HSC with other analogous devices is shown in the Ragone plot (Fig. 6f). The excellent HZCS@NC with high specific capacity and RGO with wide voltage window make the HSC device to deliver a maximum energy density of 55.47 W h kg−1 at a power density of 795.54 W kg−1 and a maximum power density of 16.55 kW kg−1 at the energy density of 32 W h kg−1. It is worth noting that the hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC//RGO HSC delivers a high energy and power density compared with the HSC devices using the similar MOF based electrode materials such as Zn0.76Co0.24S//AC (31.9 W h kg−1 at 850.0 W kg−1),20 Co–Co LDH/graphene//AC (49.5 W h kg−1 at 524.97 W kg−1),33 Co3O4//AC (46.5 W h kg−1 at 790.7 W kg−1),65 ZnCo2O4@Ni(OH)2//AC (40.0 W h kg−1 at 802.7 W kg−1),66 and other devices shown in Table S4.† Furthermore, the impressive cycling stability of our HSC was also assessed by charging and discharging at 5 A g−1 for 100000 cycles, which lead to a capacity retention of 108.9% (Fig. 6g). The GCD curves of the initial five and last five cycles are shown in the inset of the Fig. 6g, which show no significant difference. Two devices in series can power various devices, as demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 6g and S20.†
Conclusions
Herein, we have successfully synthesized hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@N-doped carbon electrodes with hierarchical pore structures based on MOF dissolution along with dopamine polymerization and subsequent annealing that causes heteroatom doping. After the initial dissolution and further sulfuration step, HZCS@NC with the hollow structure was fabricated, which possesses more active sites and ion transport channels than the reference materials without PDA protection. In addition, the N-doped carbon layer improves the conductivity and provides continuous protection during the electrochemical reaction. This electrode delivers high specific capacity (937 C g−1 at 1 A g−1), outstanding rate capability (56% at high current density of 20 A g−1), and impressive cycling stability (capacity retention rate of about 112% after 40000 cycles). The hollow Zn0.76Co0.24S@NC//RGO HSC also shows an excellent specific capacity of 251.01 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a high energy density of 55.47 W h kg−1 at a power density of 795.54 W kg−1. The stable electrode materials exhibit a retention of 108.9% after 100000 charging/discharging cycles. This hierarchical hollow structure combining the bimetallic sulfide with carbon materials can deliver both the high specific capacity and superior cycling stability, which is needed for high-performance supercapacitors.
