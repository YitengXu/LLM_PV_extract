    , Accepted 17th March 2017First published on 20th March 2017AbstractOrganic and inorganic hybrid perovskites have emerged as revolutionary optoelectronic semiconductors, which are promising for various applications especially in photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes. Perovskite solar cells have demonstrated unprecedented progress on PCE within a very short time in the history of photovoltaics. Perovskite solar cells have more than 20% PCE and advantages such as easy-to-process and tunable bandgaps have made them favorable for commercialization. Extending the absorption to a longer wavelength and addressing the challenge of stability in metal halide perovskites has become the most important research focus. However, composition engineering could be a potential solution by further tuning the band gap for the metal halide perovskites and, thus, enhance their stability. The mixed cation perovskite is one of the most practical and successful strategies for composition engineering. Here, recent progress on mixed cation metal halide perovskites is reviewed and this includes the development of binary, ternary and two-dimensional/three-dimensional mixed cation perovskites in chemical synthesis and device performance and stability progress.

Introduction
The past few years have witnessed the increase of interest of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a certified solar cell PCE of 22.1%1 and a module PCE of 12% for 6 × 6 cm2 size cells. Such a performance level is comparable to that obtained with commercial silicon solar cells. This is the first time a third generation solar cell technology has demonstrated the potential for commercialization with such great promise in such a short time. The progress has made organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites become one of the most intensively studied research topics by researchers in many different disciplines.2–5 The most typical organic–inorganic perovskite is methylammonium triidoplumbate (CH3NH3PbI3; MAPbI3), which had been synthesized and characterized in the early 1980s.6,7 The MAPbI3 was used for the first time in 2009 as a light absorber by Kojima et al. and was used in a typical dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) device using liquid electrolyte with less than 4% PCE.8 Park et al. later pushed the PCE of liquid electrolyte perovskite-sensitized solar cells to ∼6%, but this performance was still lower than that of the conventional DSSC.8,9 Although this pioneering work did not show promising performance at that time, the biggest issue related to use of MAPbI3 was identified, which is the poor stability of the liquid electrolyte. The issue of liquid electrolyte was soon solved by using solid-state electrolytes. In 2012, reports of several breakthrough demonstrated that the solid-state MAPbI3 PSCs exhibited 10–11% photoelectron conversion with much better stability.10–12 Such PCE is much higher than that obtained with the solid-state DSSCs and is comparable to the state-of the-art polymer solar cells. Since then, the MAPbI3 based PSCs have progressed in terms of their PCE after the tremendous research efforts on perovskite film deposition and interface engineering.13–17
These significant developments especially the progress made in the PCE of MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells introduce the importance of the stability issue. The most obvious challenge to stability of lead halide perovskites is their sensitivity to moisture and polar solvents. The moisture sensitivity can be solved by using sealing techniques and some other surface passivation techniques such as atomic layer deposition.18 However, the intrinsic high temperature phase instability of MAPbI3 perovskite became the main obstacle to further development of perovskite for reliable photovoltaic (PV) or other optoelectronic applications. Besides the stability issue, the band gap of MAPbI3 perovskite is around 1.55 eV, which is not ideal for solar cells. To overcome the issue of high temperature phase instability and electronic structure existing in the MAPbI3 perovskite, composition optimization became a promising approach to enhance the phase stability and modify the electronic structure. For the ABX3 halide perovskite, the cation, halide and metal composition can all be tuned to modify the properties of the final perovskite. Among them, the mixed cation perovskite exhibited the most promising potential to enhance both the PCE and stability. In this review, the latest progress and trend of mixed cation organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites will be focused on and there is a brief consideration on the challenges and opportunities of mixed cation lead halide perovskites with enhanced performance and stability.
Binary cation perovskite
FA–MA mixed cation perovskite
Although cations in the A site have no direct contribution to band structure in the perovskite structure ABX3, cations of different sizes can expand or contract the lattice of the whole structure and change the B–X bond length resulting in a different band gap.19,20 Currently, the most widely used cations to form a perovskite structure with lead halide are CH3NH3+ (MA+), HC(NH2)2+ (FA+) and Cs+. FA accounts for a broader absorption in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) as it expands the lattice of perovskite structure ABX3 because of its larger size than MA. Thus, substitution of MA with FA has been an attractive way to tune the band gap of MAPbI3 and lead to a redshift of optical absorbance. However, it is difficult to obtain high quality α-FAPbI3 because the FAPbI3 has a tolerance factor larger than 1,20 which requires a higher crystallization temperature and results in the easy-to-form, unwanted yellow phase.
Sequential deposition
The binary cation perovskite of MAxFA1−xPbI3 was reported by Grätzel group for the first time.21 To obtain a high quality and smooth perovskite film, this mixed perovskite (MA)x(FA)1−xPbI3 was prepared via a sequential deposition method by dipping lead iodide (PbI2) in methylammonium (MAI) + formamidinium iodide (FAI) mixed solution (Fig. 1a). In this work, the characteristic diffraction peaks at 14.0°, 28.4°, and 31.8° in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns decrease with the addition of FA as well as an onset of redshift in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorbance. There are some impurity peaks of MAPbI3 and δ-FAPbI3 in their XRD patterns, which reveal the difficulty of obtaining the phase-pure mixed cation (MA)x(FA)1−xPbI3 perovskites via regular sequential deposition. The PCE of such a mixed cation perovskite was comparable to that of MAPbI3 based solar cells at that time. Because the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is relatively low in the fully printable, hole conductor free, mesoscopic MAPbI3 solar cells of Hu et al., they tried using a FA and MA mixed cation perovskite with a FAI/MAI molar ratio of 3/2 as light absorber using a sequential deposition method to achieve a PCE of 12.9%, which was higher than that obtained with pure MAPbI3 or FAPbI3.22 The increasing PCE was attributed to the fact that the absorption onset of the perovskite shifted to longer wavelengths to improve the incident photoelectron conversion (IPCE) in the spectral range from 660 nm to 750 nm. Because the determinative intercalation kinetic of FA and MA cations might be different, it was difficult to control the FA and MA ratio in the final films using a traditional sequential deposition method. To control the FA content in the final films, Liu et al. developed a novel strategy to obtain a non-stoichiometric (FAI)1−x–PbI2 intermediate complex firstly as a precursor for sequential deposition using the MAI solution instead of the MAI + FAI mixture solution.23 In this method as shown in Fig. 1b, the larger size FA is firstly intercalated and fixed into the PbI2 crystal lattice. Then the MAI is later intercalated into the precursor film to form the phase pure MAxFA1−xPbI3. With this method, the MA/FA ratio can be controlled more precisely without forming the impure phase. The best device based on MA0.6FA0.4PbI3 using this method showed a higher photocurrent and broader IPCE spectrum than that obtained with MAPbI3 with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 13%.

The excellent PV properties of the mixed MAxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite have attracted many researchers to the fundamental investigations and thus, develop mixed cation perovskites. Dai et al. prepared mixed MAxFA1−xPbI3 nanorods stabilized within the perovskite structure while the photoluminescence (PL) emission was shifted from 821 nm to 782 nm as the MA ratio (x) increased from 0 to 1. The mixed cation MAxFA1−xPbI3 nanorods also had a longer PL lifetime than the pure FAPbI3 or MAPbI3 nanorods.24 Because the diffusion coefficient in the MAPbI3 perovskite is larger than that in the FAPbI3 perovskite, mixing FA with MA was found to balance the PV property and the stability of the cell devices.25 The incorporation of a small amount of MA (15%) into FAPbI3 helped with the stable formation of trigonal FAPbI3 without the requirement of a high annealing temperature and there was no lattice shrinkage or optical changes.26 The incorporation of MA significantly enhanced the stability of the PbI6 octahedral three-dimensional (3D) structure because of the I–H bond between the cation and the inorganic PbI6, in which the MA exhibits a dipole moment 10 times larger than that of FA (Fig. 2).

In the previously mentioned two-step or sequential deposition method, the precursor is either PbI2 or a PbI2-based precursor film with partial FAI intercalation followed by further interaction with MAI and/or FAI. In these methods, the interaction process includes the intercalation of both cation and halide ions. Later the cation only exchange method was developed. Because the high quality MAPbI3 can be easily deposited with various perovskite deposition techniques, these cation exchange methods usually adopted a high quality MAPbI3 film as the precursor film. As shown in Fig. 3a, the FA/MA mixed cation perovskite was fabricated by dipping MAPbI3 film into FAI solution with an increase of the dipping temperature to 60 °C to promote the FA exchange in MAPbI3.27 The dipping time was shortened and the undesirable phase transition was restricted at temperatures under 60 °C. The inter-conversion between MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 was demonstrated via a cation exchange reaction involving dipping the MAPbI3 (or FAPbI3) films in a solution of 10 mg ml−1 FAI (or MAI) in propan-2-ol at room temperature, which allowed bandgap tuning between 1.57 and 1.48 eV.28 A mixed cation perovskite of (MAxFA1−xPbI3) made using this incomplete inter-conversion shows improved solar cell performances and phase stability. Besides these traditional sequential deposition methods in solution chemistry to obtain the MA/FA mixed cation perovskites, Zhou et al. also demonstrated a gas/solid method to induce the cation exchange reaction to convert the as-synthesized high quality MAPbI3 perovskite thin films into FAxMA1−xPbI3 by introducing the MAPbI3 film in FA gas at 150 °C [Fig. 3(b)]. Similar to the ion-exchange process in all the sequential deposition methods, the alloy content for the final product can be controlled by using different cation exchange reaction times.29

One-step method
Although the high quality MA/FA mixed cation perovskites can be prepared successfully via cation intercalation or a cation exchange reaction in the sequential deposition methods, the precise control of the MA/FA ratio and avoiding the gradient of the MA/FA ratio are still challenging because of the intrinsic limitation of these methods. However, the precise MA/FA ratio in the precursor solutions can be controlled in the one-step method. Manuel et al. studied mixed cation perovskite MAxFA1−xPbI3 (where x = 0–1) for solar cell fabrication using a one-step solvent engineering method.30 The best PCE was achieved in the mixed cation perovskite MA0.6FA0.4PbI3 solar cells. The low addition of FAI from 15% to 40% can also reduce the hysteresis behavior. It was revealed that the FA cation alloying slows down the crystal formation in perovskites resulting in larger crystals and a high degree of order.30 Although the content of FAPbI3 used gives a higher stability as well as higher performance than MAPbI3, the high annealing temperature required makes it difficult to obtain high quality films.
To further enhance the performance and stability of the FA/MA mixed cation perovskite, bromine (Br) can also be introduced to partially replace the iodine (I) in the perovskite. The incorporation of a small amount of MABr into FAPbI3 was also found to help relax the anisotropic strained lattice and stabilizes the perovskite phase.31–33 Jeon et al. and Kim et al. developed a classic composite recipe of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 for fabrication of FA/MA mixed cation perovskite films with a superior PCE via a one-step method.34,35 Various compositions with different FA/MA and I/Br ratios have also been tried since.36–38 Jacobsson et al. systematically explored the MA/FA–Pb–I/Br perovskite by gradually replacing iodide and MA with bromide and FA with 49 different ratios of MA/FA and I/Br in the perovskite and then performing material characterization and device fabrication with them. MA2/6FA4/6Pb(Br1/6I5/6)3 was outstanding among all the perovskites that were compared and the best PCE obtained was 20.67%.39 A heterogeneous crystalline structure shown as nanoscale segregation and “inverted” hysteresis were also found in the mixed (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskite.40,41 With the outstanding PV properties of mixed (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskite, this mixed cation perovskite has become a model perovskite layer used in various studies of electron transport layer, hole transport materials and device structures.42–54 Other than Br, Isikgor et al. also introduced chloride (Cl) into a FA/MA mixed cation perovskite to form the MA1−xFAxPbI3−yCly mixed perovskite. The optimal PCE was 18.14% for the planar PSCs with MA0.20FA0.80PbI3−yCly significantly outperforming the PSCs with other perovskite compositions including MAPbI3, MAPbI3−yCly, MAPbI3−yCly, and MA1−xFAxPbI3.55 The solvent engineering method is the most popular one-step method used to prepare the FA/MA mixed cation perovskite because in the other popular one-step methods such as the additive method, the introduction of some extra cations might affect the final FA/MA ratio in the final perovskite films. Recently, a two-dimensional (2D)–3D conversion strategy was developed to obtain a high quality phase-pure 3D MA1−xFAxPbI3 (x = 0.1–0.9) perovskites using a simple one-step method. In this method, a compact 2D mixed composition HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl perovskite precursor film was designed to fabricate MA1−xFAxPbI3. The thermodynamically preferred Cl/I and H/FA(MA) ion exchange reaction induced fast transformation of 2D HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl perovskite film into phase-pure and high quality MA1−xFAxPbI3 with complete removal of HCl (Fig. 4).56

Other than the high PCE obtained using the FA/MA mixed cation perovskite solar cells, a > 1000 h outdoor stability was demonstrated in the mixed cation perovskite with a configuration of fluorine doped tin oxide/titanium dioxide (TiO2)/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/Spiro-OMeTAD/gold (Au).57 The PSCs maintained 80% of their initial PV properties after 846 h under continuous outdoor atmospheric analyses. Based on previous studies of preparing perovskite in ambient air, the fabrication of mixed (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x perovskite solar cells can be processed under an ambient atmosphere and maintain an excellent performance.58 This progress demonstrates the promising potential of better stability based on the MA/FA mixed cation perovskite.
FA/MA–Cs mixed cation perovskite
Another big issue for the organic hybrid halide perovskites is degradation because of the volatility of the organic cations.59,60 As a result of this, an all-inorganic perovskite, CsPbX3 has been become another research focus recently. The α-cesium lead iodide (α-CsPbI3) has a suitable band gap of 1.7 eV for PV applications. Unfortunately, α-CsPbI3 film formation requires a high annealing temperature of over 300 °C. Eperon et al. found that a small addition of hydroiodic acid into the regular CsPbI3 precursor solution as an additive could help form smooth thin CsPbI3 films at a low temperature of 100 °C.60 However, the low PCE and the instability of the desired black phase place it at a disadvantage compared against all-organic perovskites. The low stability of α-CsPbI3 can be ascribed to its very low tolerance factor because the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is an important index for a cubic perovskite structure controlled between 0.8 and 1.0 by tuning the ionic radius in the composition (Fig. 5b).61 The tolerance factor of CsPbI3 is out of 0.8–1.0 range, which also accounts for its low phase stability at room temperature. To tune the t to a suitable range, the mixed halide CsPbBrxI3−x (with 0.6 < x< 1.2) perovskite can be phase stable with improved PV performance.62 Unfortunately, the incorporation of Br widens the band gap of CsPbI3, which is undesired for PV applications. To realize better PV performance for CsPbI3 and less volatile composition in the hybrid lead halide perovskite, a Cs-based mixed cation perovskite containing MA or FA has been reported because both FA- and MA-based perovskite have a larger tolerance factor to tune the Cs-based perovskite. Li et al. have demonstrated a α-CsxFA1−xPbI3 fabricated using a regular one-step solvent engineering method with different Cs/FA ratios. The best FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 film showed humidity resistance without α-to-δH phase transition and can be stabilized as α-phase at room temperature.61 This phase-pure α-CsxFA1−xPbI3 perovskite can be attained at an annealing temperature lower than 150 °C and 315 °C for α-FAPbI3 and α-CsPbI3, respectively. Lee et al. demonstrated that the FA0.9Cs0.1PbI3 perovskite exhibited both better stability and PCE for solar cells than the pure FAPbI3 perovskite.63 In this work, lead(II) iodide (PbI2), FAI and cesium iodide (CsI) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added as a co-solvent to form a so-called intermediate phase FA(Cs)I–PbI2–DMSO and the best PCE performance of 16.5% was achieved.

Furthermore, the effect of cation mixing in Cs and FA mixed hybrid halide perovskites was elucidated via theoretical and experimental investigations.64,65 Yi et al. discovered that the best PCE was improved up to 18% by replacing both a small fraction of the iodide and bromide anions as Cs0.2FA0.8PbI2.84Br0.16, which is similar to the FA/MA mixed perovskite with incorporation of some Br to improve the performance.64 These perovskite films were also fabricated via a one-step anti-solvent method. In the mixed Cs–FA perovskite, the dark α-phase forms at room temperature when anti-solvent chlorobenzene was added during spin coating without reversible phase transition to the yellow δ-phase. The stable perovskite rather than the non-perovskite resulting from the structural and unit volume difference of δ-CsPbI3 and δ-FAPbI3 and the similarity of the α- and β-phases for CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 is shown in Fig. 5a. In this case, mixing the α- or β-phases for CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 is more favorable than using the δ-phase for the lower energetic contribution of mixing. McMeekin et al. also reported a FA/Cs mixed cation perovskite of FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 with some added bromide to achieve a band gap of 1.75 eV.66 Finally, this FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 perovskite solar cell realized an open-circuit voltage reaching 1.2 V with a PCE of over 17%. The mixed perovskite of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 as the absorber layer was utilized in the newly designed n–i–p planar heterojunction perovskite device with an n-doped C60 charge collection layer.67 After 650 h under ambient air without encapsulation and over 3400 h with encapsulation, 80% of the original PCE was sustained. Beside the FA, the MA cation has also been alloyed with Cs to form the MA/Cs mixed perovskites. Original Cs containing MA perovskite solar cells with inverted type planar heterojunction PSCs were developed by Choi et al. using [6,6]-phenyl-C60 butyric acid methyl ester as an electron acceptor.68 Use of 10% Cs doping in MAPbI3 perovskite improved the PCE from 5.51% to 7.68%.
Ternary cation perovskite
The previously mentioned binary cation perovskites all exhibited improved performance and stability. Therefore, a ternary cation perovskite using MA, FA and Cs perovskite was also successfully developed. The first FA, MA and Cs triple cation perovskite was reported by Saliba et al. and it was found that using Cs can improve the film quality for the FA/MA mixture.69 CsI (5%) was incorporated into the (FAPbI3)0.83(MAPbBr3)0.17 mixed cation perovskite to suppress the non-perovskite phase and enhance the crystallization process. As shown in Fig. 6a, a highly stabilized PCE at 21.1% was achieved and the cells still maintained a PCE of 18% after 250 h. Matsui et al. also optimized the MA/Cs ratio with a fixed I/Br ratio of 0.83/0.17 and a FA ratio of 0.8.70 The “complex-assisted gas quenching” method was also used to deposit pinhole free triple cation Cs/MA/FA perovskite.71 In this method, DMSO was used to form a DMSO–PbX2 complex and it is a widely used method to fabricate different types of perovskite materials. It has been thought that only a few monovalent cations can meet the conditions stated previously, including MA, FA and Cs, including a suitable Goldschmidt tolerance factor for the perovskite crystal structure between 0.8 and 1.0.72,73 Very recently, Saliba et al. investigated several alkali cations and found that the radius of rubidium (Rb) was only slightly smaller than the favorable cations of Cs, MA and FA. They successfully alloyed a small amount of rubidium iodide (RbI; about 5% to 10%) into a Cs/MA/FA mixed cation perovskite to achieve a record PCE of 21.6% on small areas and 19.0% on large areas (0.5 cm2) under AM1.5G. Because the entropy of the mixed compounds increases, the addition of Rb suppresses the formation of the unwanted yellow phase of Cs or FA perovskite and improves the stability of solar cells. The device based on Rb/Cs/MA/FA perovskite could maintain 95% PCE after 500 h at 85 °C under continuous illumination, which would meet industrial standards for reliable solar cells.74 The cathode luminescence measurements revealed that an appropriate addition of RbI helped to avoid the unwanted yellow phase and distributed the PbI2 phase and therefore increased the solar cell performance.75,76 However, an addition of more than 10% RbI into the mixed cation perovskite resulted in a Rb-rich phase which was destructive to the cells. Although other alkali metals do not have suitable radii to form a stable perovskite structure, a small amount of lithium and sodium salts could also promote the crystallization process and enhance the solar cell performance.77,78

2D/3D mixed cation perovskites
As well as the regular 3D perovskite with the formula of ABX3 with a small size cation,79 use of the large size cation, especially the long chain alkylammonium cation, would form a low dimensional 2D perovskite with the formula of A2BX4. Usually the 3D perovskite exhibits a good photoabsorption coefficient, desirable band gap and long charge diffusion lengths, but the 3D perovskites application is significantly limited by their instability because of the ubiquitous water intercalation, ion migration, and thermal decomposition. In contrast, a 2D perovskite with a higher stability possesses poor electronic and optical properties with strongly bound excitons because of the poor transporting property of these long chain organic cations. To enhance the stability of the perovskite, 2D and 3D perovskite with different sized cations were combined to form multi-dimensional perovskites with balanced PV performance and stability.80 In these 2D/3D mixed cation perovskites, the long chain cation in the 2D perovskites acts as moisture barriers whereas the 3D perovskites perform the optical-electric transfer. Unlike the MA, FA or Cs in a mixed cation perovskite of a suitable size to form periodic corner-shared perovskite alloy, the relatively larger size cation in a multi-dimensional perovskite will form a 2D/3D mixed perovskite. A typical formula for the 2D/3D mixed perovskite can be described as M2An−1BnX3n+1. Usually M is a large cation such as phenylethylammonium (PEA),81,82 poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI),83 butylamine (BA),84,85 cyclopropylamine (CA)86 and A is MA, FA, or Cs, B is Pb or tin (Sn) and X is a halide anion such as I, Br or Cl and n is number of layers of metal-halide sheets. The 2D/3D mixed perovskites have also been successfully prepared using one-step deposition,81–85,87–93 sequential deposition,94–96 or 2D/3D perovskite post-treatment method.86,97–99 A different method from having the larger cation occupied in the A site is interlinkage which is another approach to design the 2D/3D structure. Li et al. prepared MAPbI3 perovskite which was exposed to butylphosphonic acid 4-ammonium chloride (4-ABPACl) resulting in the incorporation of the perovskite into a mesoporous TiO2 film with the hydrogen bonding of the –PO(OH)2 and –NH3+ on the perovskite surface.87 A uniform film and PCEs from 8.8% to 16.7% was achieved as well as good moisture resistance. In a recent work by Zhang et al., formation of an in situ crosslinked 2D/3D NH3C4H9COO(CH3NH3)nPbnBr3n perovskite planar films with a controllable quantum confine were designed and prepared.100 The crosslinkage was realized using the bifunctional amino acid with NH3+ and the COO− groups. The film showed a comparable PL quantum yield (PLQY) to perovskite quantum dots prepared using a classical hot injection technique.
The mixed 2D/3D perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2[Pb3I10] was prepared using a one-step method by simply spin coating the precursor mixture of (PEA)I, MAI and PbI2.81 The 2D/3D structure of the layered perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2[Pb3I10] (PEA = C6H5(CH2)2NH3+) shown in Fig. 7d exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V and a PCE of 4.73%. The mixed perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2[Pb3I10] is much more resistant to moisture compared to the pure MAPbI3 although the devices have a lower PCE than existing solar cells with 3D perovskite absorbers. Furthermore, the number of layers n, was explored by Cohen et al.82 and Quan et al.88 (Fig. 7e). The theoretical analysis and experimental results revealed that the devices based on (PEA)2(MA)n−1[PbnI3n+1] with an n of 40 or 60 had both high PCE and stability. Yao et al. used a polymeric ammonium PEI as an interlayer spacer formed mixed 2D/3D perovskite (PEI)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3, 5, 7).83 The use of polymeric ammonium leads to the tight stacking of the separated Pb–I unit layers and thus promotes the charge transfer. A PCE of 8.77% was obtained on a 2.32 cm2 size device. Cao et al. and Stoumpos et al. reported the one-step deposition of a (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 mixed perovskite with different layers (n = 1, 2, 3 and 4).84,85 They found that the film grew along the [PbnI3n+1] slabs perpendicular to the substrate leading to the formation of smooth and uniform perovskite films. The 2D/3D-based perovskite solar cells showed notable moisture resistance but also suffered from a low PCE of 4.02%. Also, combining the BA with inorganic cation Cs yielded a great stability even after exposure to 30% relative humidity (RH) or upon heating at 85 °C.93 Later, Tsai et al. reported that by changing the film growth orientation by using the hot cast method, a preferential out-of-plane alignment film with a high film crystalline quality was formed (Fig. 8).89 The charge transport was facilitated in this Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite solar cell to realize a record high PCE of 12.52% with a high tolerance to illumination and humidity.

The 2D/3D mixed perovskite of FAxPEA1−xPbI3 can also be fabricated using a sequential deposition method as shown in Fig. 9a.101 A high PCE of 17.7% was achieved because the PEA+ cation promoted the perovskite phase and acted as passivation layer to resist moisture. The 2D/3D hybrid perovskite of (CA2PbI4/MAPbIxCl3−x) exhibited significant humidity resistance up to 63 ± 5%.86 Results showed that no degradation occurred in the 2D/3D perovskite after 40 days whereas the pure 3D perovskite decomposed completely under the same conditions after eight days. A controlled growth of a mixed cation perovskite (IC2H4NH3)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 with a nanostructure was demonstrated by treating 2D perovskite (IC2H4NH3)2Pb2I4 with MAI solution via sequential deposition (Fig. 9b).97 Such perovskite films can be fabricated into a solar cell with PCE over 9%.

The larger organic cations such as CF3CH2NH3,102 NH3I(CH2)8NH3I98 and benzene-amine molecules99 have also been considered for use as the surface passivation layer as well as the mixed 2D/3D perovskite. Wang et al. chose to use aniline, benzylamine, and phenethylamine as “moisture resistive” passivation molecules achieving PCEs above 19% and an excellent humidity stability of the benzylamine-characterized FAPbI3 after more than 2900 h exposed in air (50 ± 5 RH%).99 Besides their application in solar cells, 2D/3D mixed perovskites are becoming one of most promising candidates for light-emitting diode (LED) device applications. Yuan et al. found that by partly replacing the MA cation with the larger PEA cation, the mixed perovskite PEA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 showed a larger exciton binding energy, charge carrier concentrator behavior and an acceptable charge transport property, which facilitated the radiative recombination.90 The device exhibited an external quantum PCE (EQE) of about 8.8% and radiance of 80 W sr−1 m−2. Byun et al. reported similar results from utilizing a PEA2MAn−1PbnBr3n+1 LED device.92 An EQE of up to 11.7% with good stability was achieved by Wang et al. using a 2D/3D mixed perovskite.91 In this work, a solution-processed perovskite with self-organized multiple quantum wells was obtained by mixing FAI and 1-naphthylmethylamine iodide to form a 2D/3D mixed perovskite. All these researches suggest that it is important to design a novel 2D/3D mixed perovskite with balanced electron transfer properties and stabilities.
Mixed cation to stabilize the Pb–Sn alloy metal halide perovskite
Because of the similar electronic structure and the similar ionic radii of Sn (1.35 Å) to Pb (1.49 Å), the Sn and Pb-free perovskites provide promising prospects with a toxicological advantage and a broader band gap tuning. Hao et al. reported that the optical bandgap of MASnI3 was 1.3 eV resulting in an absorption set at 950 nm, which is ideal for solar cell applications.103 Interestingly, the alloyed Pb/Sn MAI perovskite showed a bandgap not in the range between 1.55 eV and 1.35 eV but was narrower than 1.3 eV extending the absorption onset to the near-infrared.104–106
Based on the Shockley–Queisser theory, replacing 15% Pb by Sn in the perovskite can theoretically enhance the PCE from 27.9% to 30.4%.108 However, the PCEs of solar cells based on the Sn perovskites were relatively low.103–105,109–114 Other than the low PCE, another great problem that exists is that the favorable Sn2+ is prone to oxidize into the more stable Sn4+, which will destroy the perovskite structure. Based on the spin polarized density functional theory calculations, Wang et al. found the Sn atom in FASnI3 were less likely to be oxidized to Sn4+ than in MASnI3 because of the stronger hydrogen bond in the FASnI3.115 Because of the FA oxidation shield effect, the MA or FA mixed cation perovskites with Sn substitution for Pb showed significant progress in the preparation of a stable Pb–Sn mixed perovskite. The (FASnI3)1−x(MAPbI3)x solar cell PEC has been greatly improved compared to the previously reported CH3NH3Sn1−xPbxI3 perovskite.116–118 The mixed FA/MA and Sn/Pb perovskite with inverted cell structure was prepared using FASnI3 and MAPbI3 precursor by Liao et al.119 The indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/(FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4/C60/BCP/Ag devices showed an increased PCE of 15.08% and a short-circuit current density of 26.86 mA cm−2 compared to previous studies. The Sn-based MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 perovskite solar cells can be fabricated via one-step method.120 A PCE of 14.19% was achieved initially and was 94% after 30 days in an inert atmosphere and 80% after 12 days exposed to ambient atmosphere (30–40% RH). Once placed in tandem with MAPbI3 PSCs, it recorded a PCE of 19.08%. As shown in Fig. 10, Eperon et al. incorporated Sn into the mixed perovskite FA0.75Cs0.25PbI3 with a bandgap of 1.2 eV and 14.8% PCE.107 In terms of stability, the FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 films can be heated at 100 °C for four days and no moderating trend of PCE occurs.

In summary, the interest in mixed cation metal halide perovskite has demonstrated rapid progress in a short period of time to produce perovskite-based optoelectronic devices with enhanced performance and stability. The fast development can be ascribed to previous research efforts and results obtained using MAPbI3 perovskite. Further fundamental understanding of the mixed cation perovskite is expected to further improve perovskite solar cells to obtain PCEs greater than 22% and better stabilities. Because the phase purity of the mixed cation perovskite is so important and highly sensitive to deposition technique, it is essential to develop a scale-up method to deposit large sized, phase-pure, high quality mixed cation perovskite. Continued advances in mixed cation perovskite based optoelectronic devices will be based on a thorough understanding of the crystallization process and how different cations can affect the mixed cation perovskite. The strategy of using mixed cation perovskites might also provide an opportunity to develop high performance, totally non-lead perovskite as demonstrated in current Pb–Sn alloyed perovskite. Other issues such as the phase separation in these mixed cation perovskites might be an issue for the long-term stability and the impact of different cation related stability issues should also be fully examined and understood.
