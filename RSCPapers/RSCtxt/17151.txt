1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted a lot of attention for fundamental studies of low-dimensional physics and various designs of novel devices.1,2 Among the 2D families, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, exhibit promising semiconducting properties, including sizable bandgaps and fast carrier mobilities.3 These are highly desirable properties for building atomically thin (opto)electronic applications which complement other 2D layers, such as graphene (semimetal) and hexagonal boron nitride (insulator).4,5 Thanks to its semiconducting characteristics, an MoS2-based field-effect transistor (FET) was first introduced in 2007.6 Since then, research on atomically thin TMDs has advanced at an astonishing pace, with the aim of overcoming the challenges in scaling down bulk semiconductor devices, including short-channel effects, current leakage, and high power consumption in a limited area.7–9 The bandgaps of ultrathin TMDs corresponding to the energy levels of the visible spectrum of light are adequate to develop versatile optoelectronics, such as photovoltaic energy harvesters, phototransistors, light-emitting diodes (LED), and photodetectors.10–12 In addition to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, atomically thin TMDs offer high mechanical strength, flexibility, and light weight, which may be utilized to develop flexible and wearable devices.13,14
Looking beyond individual 2D materials, a new research field into heterostructures from dissimilar ultrathin TMDs has emerged, expecting synergetic effects between constituent flakes.15–19 Due to the various combinations of 2D layers, the artificially stacked heterolayers held together by interlayer van der Waals (vdW) interaction exhibit versatile architectures and distinct properties for potential applications. For example, 2D MoS2/WSe2 heterojunctions can be prepared by stacking MoS2 and WSe2 monolayers. Given their properties as electron-rich (n-type; MoS2) and hole-rich (p-type; WSe2) semiconductors, the heterojunctions display rectifying current–voltage (CV) behaviors, which may not be achieved by the individual TMDs.20 Unlike conventional materials that require an entirely matched lattice growth, the vdW heterostructures may be constructed via various design schemes with different interlayer distances, twisted angles, and Moiré patterns of constituent layers.21–24 The additional degrees of freedom in the methods allow excellent tunabilities in the heterojunctions. The Moiré patterns in MoSe2/MoS2 heterolayers, for instance, display periodic interlayer potentials and split the energy levels of excitonic transitions.21 The heterostructures are not just limited to the vertically stacked vdW junctions; they may also be prepared with different chemistries such as covalent and ionic interactions.18,25,26 For example, heteromaterials made of MoS2 covalently bonded to graphene can be utilized for energy storage thanks to the high ion capacity of MoS2 and the high conductivity of graphene.27,28 Thus, TMD-based heterostructures may open up many possibilities for discovering new physics and developing novel applications.
While the science on TMDs and TMD-based heterostructures has advanced tremendously over the past decade, the field has not matured yet, and numerous challenges remain unresolved for realizing TMD-based practical applications.25,29,30 For example, reliable and scalable synthesis of the materials and controllable doping for tuning the carrier types and amounts must be addressed to fabricate 2D-material-based market products. Organic-integrated 2D hybrid heterostructures have been proposed to address these issues. Molecular systems, including organic molecules, polymers, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and carbonaceous composites, are suitable for low-cost production and scalable synthesis.30,31 The molecular systems may be integrated with TMDs and TMD-based heterostructures via vdW forces, covalent chemistry, or electrostatic interaction.32 For example, TMD/organic hybrid structures can be formed by simply dipping the substrate-supported TMDs into the organic-molecule-containing solution at room temperature.33,34 This will enable facile mass production of TMD/organic hybrid structures. Moreover, a wide range of organic-integrated TMD hybrids are possible, given the extensive library of organic molecules to meet various demands of applications.35–37
In contrast to conventional doping (e.g., ion implantation and diffusion) that may impair the crystalline structures of ultrathin TMDs, the carrier types and amounts in TMDs can be modulated by organic functionalization without damaging the 2D flakes.38 The organic molecules interfacing the TMD flakes may lead to several distinct interlayer charge transfer processes, depending on the energy level difference between the reduction/oxidation potentials of the molecular system and the work functions of ultrathin materials. Furthermore, due to the soft nature of organic and polymer layers, the organic-functionalized TMD hybrid structures may be utilized for flexible devices.37 Lastly, organic layers can play a role in passivating defects in TMDs.39,40 Defects (e.g., vacancies and adatoms) in atomically thin crystals may cause a deterioration in the optoelectronic properties, leading to unexpected degradation of the device performances.41 The defects can be controlled via chemical reactions between TMDs and organic layers, where the molecules may fill the vacancies or remove the adatoms with covalent reactions.
This article will discuss the state-of-the-art in organic-integrated TMDs and TMD-based heterostructures. It is worth noting that studies of 2D materials are incredibly vast, and this work will not cover the entire field. The scope of this review includes the fundamental properties and mechanisms of organic-integrated TMD hybrids and their applications. In particular, we will introduce the most recent advances in multicomponent hybrid structures. In section 2, we discuss the fundamental properties of TMDs and TMD-based heterostructures. The discussion will also include why organic functionalization is desirable for tuning the properties of TMDs and how the interactions between TMDs and organic layers lead to synergetic outcomes for (opto)electronic and energy devices. In section 3, various properties of organic-embedded heterostructures are presented, including dielectric screening, doping, dipole interaction, and interfacial chemistry between organic layers and ultrathin materials. Section 4 highlights the applications of organic-functionalized TMD hybrid heterostructures, including phototransistors, photovoltaics, LEDs, and optical memories as well as energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and catalysts for energy applications. Lastly, we conclude with current opportunities and challenges that will be worth exploring to advance 2D materials science and technology.
2. Overview of organic–TMD hybrid materials
2.1. TMDs
TMDs indicate a family of materials with the formula MX2, consisting of a transition metal (M = Mo, W, Re, etc.) and chalcogen atoms (X = S, Se, or Te).31 The transition metal is sandwiched by two chalcogen atoms via a strong covalent bond. The MX2 crystals form layered structures with relatively weak vdW interaction between the layers. Such layered materials exhibit two common symmetries: hexagonal (1H or 2H) and tetragonal (1T) geometries.3 The polytypes of the geometries determine the electronic properties of the TMDs. For example, 1T-MoS2 shows a metastable metallic nature which tends to be converted into stable hexagonal phases with semiconducting properties.42 The layered features allow one to exfoliate TMDs in various ways. For example, mechanical exfoliation of bulk crystals using sticky tape, termed the ‘scotch-tape method’, has been widely adopted to prepare atomically thin TMDs with minimal structural disruption and defects.9 TMDs can be chemically exfoliated into thin flakes in solution by ion intercalation or ultrasonication methods, which have the potential for large-scale manufacturing.10,25 Besides the top-down preparation techniques, bottom-up growth approaches are also available, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or solvothermal synthesis.43,44 TMDs of a few tens of micrometers in size have been demonstrated with the CVD method for optoelectronic devices.43,45,46 Here, TMD flakes are formed by the chemical reaction of volatile precursors containing transition metal and chalcogen atoms on various substrates under well-controlled environments with low pressure and high temperature.45 TMD nanomaterials may also be prepared in a hot pressurized vessel that allows a chemical reaction between the heteroatoms in an aqueous solution.47–49 This approach may enable a scalable production of TMDs with various morphologies, including edge-rich flower-like nanostructures,49 hollow tubular structures,50 and agglomerated nanoparticles.51 More detailed discussions on TMD fabrication can be found elsewhere.43,44,52
Semiconducting 2D TMDs possess promising properties for optoelectronics and spintronics. The bandgaps of TMDs depend on several factors such as the constituent elements53–55 and number of layers.34 TMD monolayers have direct bandgaps that are larger than those of bulk crystals with indirect gaps. The monolayers show stronger photoluminescence (PL) with large exciton binding energies (few hundreds of meV), allowing for the stable formation of excitons around room temperature.34,56–58 Monolayer (1L) TMDs also have strong piezoelectric coupling of charges, which may be adopted for low-power electronics.59 Another unique feature of monolayer 2H-TMDs is that they exhibit broken inversion symmetry that results in a large valley splitting in the energy band and a strong spin valley coupling.60 This may allow for electrical and magnetic manipulation of charge carriers in spin-based devices. In addition, the layered nature of TMDs provides distinct advantages for energy applications. Atomically thin TMDs exhibit large surface areas, and their stacked lamellar structures may store ions between adjacent layers, thus providing high ion capacity for energy storage devices.26
2.2. TMD-based heterostructures
Combining different 2D materials as heterostructures can further expand the boundaries of the physics of ultrathin materials and open new doors for future applications.15Fig. 1a illustrates 2D TMD heterostructures made of dissimilar layers.61 With a suitable combination of components, it is possible to fabricate atomically thin heterostructures for high-performance, low-power-consumption electronic devices.2,58 For example, p–n junctions that are fundamental building blocks for electronics can be prepared by integrating an n-type MoS2 layer with a p-type WSe2 flake. As atomically thin heterostructures may not form charge depletion layers, vdW p–n junctions such as WSe2/MoS2, MoTe2/MoS2, and WSe2/WS2 exhibit unique anti-ambipolar behaviors that are rarely found in bulk electronics.62–64 The devices demonstrate a local maximum conductance at a particular gate potential, which is different from typical ambipolar characteristics.64 Such unique behavior may be harnessed to build new electronic applications, including neuromorphic devices, ternary logic circuits, and gate-tunable diodes.65–67 TMD sandwiched by top and bottom graphene layers (i.e., graphene/WS2/graphene) in Fig. 1b performs as a vertically tunneling FET with a high on/off ratio (∼106) and a small subthreshold swing (below 60 meV per decade), enabling the low power consumption operation of an FET.68,69 Here, TMD serves as a tunneling barrier, while graphene has the role of a charge-injecting layer.

The vdW heterostructures exhibit extraordinary properties that cannot be achieved with individual 2D layers. (b) Room-temperature charge transport measurements in a BN/graphene/WS2/graphene heterostructure,69 which shows a high on/off ratio of ∼106. (c) Intralayer PL spectra of MoSe2 (top) and WSe2 (bottom) and the spectrum of MoSe2/WSe2, showing both intralayer and interlayer emission (middle).70 (d) A schematic diagram of interlayer exciton (IX) formation in a staggered band alignment where interlayer charge transfer is facilitated. The IX has a distinct energy level compared to intralayer MoS2 (XMoSe2) and WSe2 (XWSe2) excitons.71 (b, c, and d) have been reproduced from ref. 69, 70 and 71, respectively, with permission from Springer Nature: ref. 69, copyright 2013; ref. 70, copyright 2015; and ref. 71, copyright 2019. 
TMD/TMD heterostructures exhibit exciting phenomena arising from strong light–matter interactions. As shown in Fig. 1c, an interlayer exciton (IX), a bound state of an electron and a hole separately residing in opposite layers, is observed in type II TMD/TMD heterostructures.70 This is distinct from and different from the intralayer excitons confined in the individual layers.22,24,70 The PL emissions from individual WSe2 and MoSe2 flakes are observed from 1.6 to 1.75 eV (see the top and bottom panels). In contrast, the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure exhibits an additional peak near 1.4 eV from the radiative recombination of IXs. Fig. 1d illustrates the interlayer emission process in the MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer.71 The photoexcited electron in WSe2 is transferred to MoSe2, while the hole in MoSe2 migrates to WSe2 due to the staggered band alignment. The spatially separate electron–hole pair in the heterolayers has strong coulombic interactions which lead to a large binding energy (∼100 meV) and stable PL emission with a long lifetime (∼100 ns) and a scalable diffusion length (∼a few μm).21,70,72,73 These characteristics may allow one to harness IXs as a new class of information carrier similar to charges in FET. If the bound charges are aligned in a particular direction, for example, they may behave as aligned dipoles which can be electrically controlled in excitonic devices.74
TMD heterolayers can be prepared by several methods, including (i) mechanical stamping with an elastomer, (ii) consecutive CVD growth, and (iii) solution phase synthesis.15,18,20 (i) The constituent layers in a heterostructure may be prepared from separate micromechanical exfoliations and stacked by stamping against each other with an elastomeric polymer.18 For example, a TMD layer can be positioned in a desired location of an elastomer such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which may then be placed on top of another 2D flake on a silicon substrate using a position manipulator. This method often produces high-quality specimens suitable for fundamental studies of material properties. (ii) For scalable manufacturing, sequential growth of constituent layers with CVD methods may be favored. Several TMD/TMD heterobilayers with sizes of several tens of micrometers were demonstrated, including MoS2/WS2, MoS2/WSe2, and SnSe2/MoS2 as well as TMD/other-2D-flake (e.g., hBN/MoS2 and graphene/MoS2).75 (iii) Heteroassemblies may also be prepared by co-dispersing different TMD flakes in solution.76,77 With the vdW interaction between the colloidal flakes, the layers can constitute a heterostructure. Yun et al. demonstrated this approach by flocculating MoS2 and WSe2 flakes into self-assembled homolayers and heterolayers.77 The approach could be adopted for cost-effective ink-printing electronics.
2.3. Organic-integrated TMD hybrids
The TMDs and TMD-based heterostructures show various promising properties which may be exploited for future applications. Despite significant efforts in recent years, these studies are still at an early stage. Numerous challenges remain unaddressed, which may be classified into three distinct categories: (i) fabrication difficulties, (ii) the necessity of doping, and (iii) engineering environmental conditions. First, individual TMD structures may be prepared by mechanical exfoliation, CVD, or solvothermal synthesis. Manual stacking of micromechanically exfoliated TMD flakes for heterostructures can produce high-quality samples; however, it requires a series of laborious preparation steps which may be handled only by skillful operators. This is not desirable for industrial fabrication.15 CVD-based approaches may ameliorate these difficulties.43 However, the methods offer only a few limited combinations of heteroassemblies, and the synthesized samples often bear structural defects and imperfections. The heterolayers constructed by solution-phase methods may have inhomogeneous properties such as different layer numbers and sizes as well as uncontrolled stacking of multiple flakes.76
Second, the behavior and performance of electronic and optoelectronic devices depend highly on the charge carrier type and concentration in semiconducting channel layers.25 Thus, it is crucial to control the charges in TMD-based heterostructures with efficient doping processes. Conventional doping techniques widely accepted for silicon-based devices include thermal diffusion and ion implantation. These methods, however, may not be useful for atomically thin materials, as they could significantly damage the TMD layers.29 Lastly, due to their 2D nature and quantum confinement, TMDs and TMD-based heterostructures are extremely sensitive to their local microenvironments. For example, MoS2 transistors prepared on silicon (Si)/silicon dioxide (SiO2) substrates demonstrate poor mobility and on/off behaviors compared with those on hBN, because of dielectric inhomogeneity and trapped charges in Si/SiO2.78 In addition, the inherent defects in TMDs, such as vacancies and adatoms, may influence the device performance; thus suitable interfacial engineering should be applied to control the defects.
The integration of 2D materials with organic molecular systems has been explored as a promising approach to address the challenges discussed above.25,29,30,79 The molecular systems include organic molecules, polymers, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). They offer several distinct advantages for 2D materials. Unlike the challenging 2D material fabrication, a wide range of organic molecules can be prepared at large scale and low cost.35,36 They may be further customized to meet various requirements of applications. The organic functionalization on 2D layers is a non-destructive and defect-free process of doping, which can control the charge density and polarity in the TMDs. Moreover, TMD/organic systems may be designed to exploit synergetic effects of TMDs and organic layers.36,80–84 For example, environmentally switchable molecules including photo-, electro-, chemo-, and thermo-sensitive molecules may provide additional tunability on TMD–organic hybrid structures.85–88 Photochromic molecules can change their conformations with external light stimuli (e.g., UV and visible light), and their energy levels are modulated accordingly.67 With the switching behaviors, the functionalized molecules may control the interlayer charge transfer at the TMD/organic interface. Such properties could make the hybrid heterostructures useful as optical memory applications (see section 4.1).
The TMD interfaces may also be engineered with organic adlayers. For example, the organic layers (e.g., a fluoropolymer) can perform as a low dielectric layer for TMD FETs, when coupled with a high dielectric film (e.g., Al2O3).89 The complex dielectric system may increase the carrier mobility and reduce the subthreshold swing by minimizing unwanted scattering of charges. Organic layers may also be used for tuning the dielectric screening on the charges. The screening can significantly affect the energy level of excitons by modulating their binding energies, ultimately leading to shifts in emission wavelength.90,91 Furthermore, organic molecules can passivate the defects in TMDs by filling vacancies and removing adatoms with covalent chemistries.29 Generally, the defect-engineered TMDs exhibit an enhanced carrier mobility and an improved PL quantum yield.38,92 Lastly, it was recently reported that the organic functionalization may tailor not only the properties of the individual layer but also the interlayer interaction in TMD-based heterojunctions such as TMD/TMD, TMD/graphene, and TMD/hBN.90,93,94 The organic layers embedded in the multicomponent heteroassemblies can control the interlayer charge and energy transfer.93,94 The embedded molecular systems also modify the emission characteristics of IXs in TMD/TMD heterostructures by converting the charge transfer pathways from tunneling to type-II-junction-supported transport and modulating the dielectric screening strength.90
The organic functionalization on TMDs may be categorized into two groups: covalent and noncovalent methods.25,29–31 The physisorption of organic layers may occur on smooth surfaces of crystalline structures without significant dangling bonds, leading to stable vdW interaction between TMDs and organics. The examples include solution-based processes, including drop casting, spin coating, and simple immersion of the substrate-supported TMDs (Fig. 2a–c).95,96 The organic layers may behave as a donor or acceptor for TMDs, depending on the energy level difference between the redox potentials of the organics and the TMD work functions. Chamlagain et al. reported that benzyl viologen (BV) molecules deposited on a MoS2-based device by immersion can serve as a donor for MoS2, thereby controlling the carrier density.95 Here, the redox potential of BVs is higher than the work function of MoS2, where the electron transfer from the molecular system to MoS2 is favorable. Organic molecules may also be deposited on various 2D layers by gas-phase processes, such as molecular beam epitaxy (or thermal vapor deposition), as illustrated in Fig. 2d.97–99 For instance, perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) and titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) can be evaporated in a low-pressure chamber, and the vaporized molecules may form a uniform layer on 2D layers.98,99
 Fig. 2  Schematic diagrams of preparation methods for TMD/organic hybrid structures. Organic molecules may be deposited on TMD flakes via solution or gas phase processes. The solution processes include (a) drop-casting, (b) spin coating, and (c) immersion. The molecules in the solutions can bind with TMDs via vdW, covalent, or electrostatic interactions and form uniform layers or self-patterned structures on TMDs. (d) Gas-phase deposition can be carried out in a temperature- and pressure-controlled chamber. In a low-pressure and high-temperature environment, the vaporized molecular flux builds molecular crystals on TMDs via vdW forces. 
Furthermore, the molecular systems may form self-patterned layers in a particular shape, which is attributed to the strong intermolecular interaction and the relatively weak interaction between 2D materials and organic molecules.96,100–103 For example, Wang et al. demonstrated that oleamide molecules on TMDs form interesting nanoribbon patterns with an angle of ∼120° in three directions, as illustrated in Fig. 3a.96Fig. 3b shows the AFM images of such self-patterned oleamide nanoribbons on MoSe2 (top) and WSe2 (bottom), where the nanoribbons are aligned with 3-fold symmetry on TMD layers. They attributed this phenomenon to the tip-to-tip interaction between oleamide molecules. Other molecules with strong intermolecular interactions, such as PTCDA and 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP), were shown to form herringbone patterns on 2D materials.100,101 In addition, Lin et al. demonstrated that pentacene and iron phthalocyanine (FePc) could cluster and form assemblies on the 1H phase of PtSe2 but not on the 1T metallic phase, because of the higher electron affinity of the 1H phase resulting in a stronger electrostatic interaction with the organic system.102

The 1T-phase MoS2 depicted by n− in the diagram (indicating its electron-rich nature) shares excessive charges with organic halides and forms covalent bonds with the molecules.109 (a, b and d) have been adapted from ref. 96 and 109, respectively, with permission from Springer Nature: ref. 96, copyright 2017 and ref. 109, copyright 2015. (c) Has been reproduced from ref. 104 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2017. 
Beside vdW interactions, the TMD/organic heterointerfaces may be constructed with covalent chemistry.92,104–109 The covalent functionalization can be divided into defect-mediated and phase-assisted processes, which are illustrated in Fig. 3c and d, respectively.104,109 TMDs with inherent defects may react with functional groups in organic molecules. For example, MoS2 may have sulfur vacancies or adatoms that can react with molecules bearing thiol groups.92 The thiol groups form disulfide bonds with MoS2 at the vacancy sites. Solution-based and vapor-deposition processes have been introduced for the reaction.25 It was demonstrated that MoS2 could be decorated with 4-amino thiophenol (4ATP) and 4-nitro thiophenol (4NTP) by immersing MoS2 phototransistors in solutions containing the molecules.105 The functionalized phototransistors exhibited a greater photoresponsivity due to the engineered band structure. With a similar covalent, yet distinct, method, Cho et al. reported that thiol-molecules such as decanethiol (DT) and perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT) deposited by thermal evaporation provided tunneling paths on MoS2-based electronic devices and improved charge-injection behaviors.108 The phase-assisted process was first introduced by Voiry et al.109 The metastable 1T-phase MoS2 prepared via liquid exfoliation by butyllithium intercalation showed electron-rich characteristics. The 1T-MoS2 facilitated charge transfer to organic halides, resulting in covalent binding of the organic halides covering up to 30% of the MoS2 surface. The stable functionalization drastically modified the optoelectronic properties of the TMD layer, generating a strong PL.
3. Properties of hybrid structures
3.1. Dielectric screening
Ultrathin TMDs have strong Coulomb interactions between charge carriers due to weak self-dielectric screening originating from quantum confinement effects (i.e., the 2D limit).110 This brings out many unique optoelectronic properties of TMDs, including a significant renormalization of the electronic energy levels and high binding exciton energies. Since the extraordinary properties are strongly affected by the dielectric conditions of TMDs, significant efforts have been devoted to tailoring their local dielectric environments.89,111,112 Molecular systems are excellent candidates for achieving these goals. For example, the bandgap of 2D materials may be renormalized by dielectric screening due to organic-layer-induced surface polarization.113 As illustrated in Fig. 4a, the charges in the 2D semiconducting layer encapsulated with a dielectric (red box) may experience a weaker electric field than those without the dielectric layer.110 Given the weakened electric fields (i.e., increased dielectric screening), the charges may consequently possess a reduced self-energy. As a result, the energy level difference between charges in the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) (i.e., the bandgap) may be smaller at the heterointerface, as shown in Fig. 4a. Winkler et al. reported the renormalization behavior of bilayer MoS2 by intercalating TiOPc molecules. They estimated that the organic-molecule-inserted MoS2 bilayer has a smaller bandgap by ∼0.3 eV than pristine MoS2.114 The bandgap renormalization due to the dielectric screening has been discussed in detail elsewhere.113,115,116
 Fig. 4  Dielectric screening in organic-integrated TMDs. (a) A schematic diagram of a semiconducting 2D TMD partially encapsulated with a dielectric layer.110 Due to bandgap renormalization, the encapsulated region of the TMD layer may have a smaller bandgap than that without a dielectric layer. (b) A schematic diagram of emission energy modulation in an ultrathin TMD under different dielectric conditions. Here, EE and EB indicate the emission and binding energies of an exciton, respectively. EG is the bandgap energy. With an increased dielectric constant (ε), the emission energy may be reduced, thus resulting in redshifted PL. (c) Emission spectra of MoS2/eosin Y (EY) and MoS2/air.90 The organic layer with greater dielectric screening leads to a redshifted emission peak by approximately ∼6 nm. (d) A schematic diagram of a multilayer MoSe2 FET with a dielectric layer of parylene molecules (CYTOP®).112 (e) Conductivity measurements of an MoSe2 FET with and without a parylene layer. The hybrid device shows greater mobility under a negative gate voltage.112 (a) Has been reproduced from ref. 110 with permission from Springer Nature, copyright 2017. (c, d and e) have been adapted from ref. 90 and 112, respectively, with permission from the American Chemical Society: ref. 90, copyright 2021 and ref. 112, copyright 2014. 
The electrostatic interaction of charges in the 2D layers may be inversely proportional to the dielectric strength.90,111 Excitons in a TMD layer covered with an organic layer may experience stronger dielectric screening and, accordingly, weaker Coulomb interaction than those exposed to air. The phenomenon is attributed to a higher dielectric constant of the organic layer than that of the air. For example, an organic layer made of eosin Y (EY) may have a relative dielectric constant (ε ≈ 3), greater than that of the air (ε ≈ 1).117 Given the increased dielectric screening with the organic layer, the excitons in the TMD/organic may have a smaller binding energy than those in the TMD/air, as shown in Fig. 4b. The interplay of screening-induced changes in the bandgap (EG) and the exciton binding energy (EB) will determine the PL emission energy (EE) of a TMD sample.113,118 EE = EG − EB(1)
As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the TMD under stronger dielectric screening effects may be renormalized to have a reduced bandgap energy. Its exciton binding energy may also be diminished, eventually having a reduced emission energy and exhibiting a redshifted PL.
As an example, Fig. 4c demonstrates the PL spectra of 1L MoS2 with and without an EY layer.90 The 1L MoS2 flake covered with an EY layer exhibits its PL emission peak at ∼660 nm, which is approximately 6 nm longer (or lower emission energy by ∼17 meV) than that of MoS2/air. In Fig. 4c, another noticeable change in the PL spectra of the TMDs in the presence of the organic layer is the PL intensity difference. This may be attributed to the doping effects at the TMD/organic interface, which will be discussed in section 3.2.
In addition to the bandgap engineering and the binding exciton energies in TMDs, dielectric polymers have been explored to minimize unwanted phonon scattering on the charges. Chamlagain et al. reported an MoSe2 FET on a parylene layer (CYTOP®) (Fig. 4d).112 The organic layer attenuated phonon scattering from the bottom Si/SiO2 substrate. The TMD/organic device showed a higher electric conductivity than the pristine TMD FET, as shown in Fig. 4e. The hybrid demonstrated a three-times faster carrier mobility than the control sample. Similar behavior was observed by Shokouh and coworkers.89 A WSe2 transistor with a gate dielectric made of sapphire and fluoropolymer showed a high hole mobility of ∼100 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off ratio >107. The device also demonstrated good stability in ambient air with a relative humidity of 45% for over 7 days. They attributed the high performance to reduced phonon scattering and moisture protection by the organic layer.
3.2. Doping
Doping is one of the most effective ways to tune the electronic and optoelectronic properties of semiconducting materials. The success of traditional silicon technologies hinges partly on the doping-friendly properties of silicon. Its carrier type and density can be efficiently controlled with several doping techniques, including ion diffusion and implantation.119,120 Such methods can convert silicon channels into non-degenerate or degenerate p- and n-type materials for various purposes. However, conventional strategies may not be useful in tailoring the (opto)electronic properties of 2D TMDs. The processes may cause a severe deterioration in the TMD structures, introducing several unwanted effects, such as a decrease in the charge mobility and additional defects in the layer.121,122 Therefore, it is necessary to develop sophisticated and reliable doping methods for 2D materials.11,123 Organic molecules are potential candidates to achieve non-destructive doping on 2D TMDs, where interlayer charge transfer may be induced at the interface between TMDs and molecular layers. Here, we classify the molecule-induced doping into two distinct mechanisms: dark-state doping and dipole-induced charge transfer. Table 1 highlights the interactions between various TMDs and molecular systems as well as the methods used for preparing the hybrid structures.

Dark-state doping refers explicitly to the interlayer charge transfer at the TMD/organic interface without illumination.7,29,30,33,38,95,124 The process is determined by the energy level difference between the redox potential of the organic system and the work function of TMDs. Here, the redox (i.e., reduction/oxidation) potentials indicate the energy levels of the organic system (e.g., organic molecules, layers, frameworks, and polymers) to withdraw or donate charges to any interfacing substrates. When the heteromaterials are brought into contact, the electrons in one layer with a higher potential may flow to the opposite layer. For example, if the redox potential of the molecule is higher than the TMD work function, the electrons in the organic layer can spontaneously migrate to the TMD, as illustrated in Fig. 5a. This represents an n-doping process, where the molecules are electron donors. The doping process with an opposite energy level alignment is p-doping, where the organic system withdraws electrons from TMDs, as presented in Fig. 5b.
 Fig. 5  Dark-state doping at TMD/organic interfaces. Schematic representations of (a) n-doping and (b) p-doping on TMDs with organic layers. The charge transfer characteristics are determined based on the energy level difference between the work function of the TMD and the redox potential of the organic molecule. 
With organic-induced doping, both carrier type and density in TMDs can be modulated. For example, Kiriya and coworkers demonstrated n-doping on MoS2 by decorating BV on the mechanically exfoliated TMD layers (with a thickness of ∼5 nm) via vdW interaction (Fig. 6a).125Fig. 6b shows that after the heavy n-doping the BV-coated MoS2 transistor exhibited a current of ∼10−4 A under a gate potential of −40 V at a source–drain voltage (VD) of 1 V. The electron density after the BV-assisted doping was estimated to be ∼1 × 1013 cm−2. The undoped, pristine MoS2 transistor generated a six orders of magnitude smaller current under the same operating conditions because of the insufficient amount of charge carriers. Benjamin et al. demonstrated a drastic switching of major carrier types in TMD FETs by functionalizing metalated tetra-sulfonic-phthalocyanine (TsPc) molecules.126Fig. 6c shows that an Na2TsPc-attached WSe2 FET demonstrated suppressed p-branch currents and enhanced n-branch currents. The threshold voltage transitioned from ∼10 V to ∼−10 V after the functionalization. Here, the threshold value was determined by finding the gate-voltage axis intercept at zero current from the linear extrapolation in the current–voltage curve. This indicates that the hole-rich condition of the device may have been converted into n-type. Fig. 6d shows a completely opposite modulation of the carrier type in an MoS2 FET. The polarity of the MoS2 channel was switched from n-type to p-type by functionalization with CuTsPc. The Cu-chelated TsPc may lower the work function of MoS2 due to the p-doping effects, resulting in the shift of the carrier polarity.

(g) PL spectra of 1L WS2 with and without F4TCNQ.127 Molecular functionalization on n-type WS2 leads to significant p-doping, which results in balanced charge polarity in the TMD layer. The TMD hybrid exhibits both exciton and trion emission at ∼2.05 and ∼1.95 eV, respectively. In contrast, the as-prepared WS2 layer only emits trion PL at ∼1.95 eV due to its electron-rich nature. (h) Emission spectra of WS2 following consecutive F4TCNQ doping.127 The emission intensity increases with increased doping due to the balanced populations of electrons and holes.

(c and d) reproduced from ref. 126 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry, copyright 2018. 
Beyond the effects on individual TMD layers, organic functionalization may also control the electronic properties of TMD-based heterostructures.33,94 For example, Kim et al. reported that the hole conductance of WSe2/MoS2 p–n heterojunction FETs may be enhanced by functionalizing poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PMMA-co-PMAA) on the TMD heterolayers (Fig. 6e). The p-doping on the heterojunction increased the hole current and broadened the region of anti-ambipolar FET characteristics. They reported that the range of the voltage window showing anti-ambipolar behavior was expanded from ∼15 V without functionalization to ∼25 V with the organic layer. Due to the p-doping effects, the potential window of hole-dominant current in the organic-layer-attached p–n junction spans −56 V to −37 V (Fig. 6f), which is twice as wide as that (−64 V to −55 V) of the TMD-only heterojunction.
Molecular doping may also affect the optoelectronic properties of TMDs. Under light illumination, a photoexcited electron may form a bound state with a hole (i.e., an exciton). In addition to the charge-neutral excitons, negatively or positively charged excitons (termed trions) are also possible. The negatively or positively charged trions show the electron- or hole-rich nature of TMDs, respectively. The levels of neutral and charged excitons in TMDs can be controlled by the dark-state doping process. Fig. 6g shows the effect of dark-state doping on the radiative recombination of excitons and trions in WS2.127 Peimyoo et al. demonstrated an effective p-doping on as-prepared n-type WS2via 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) functionalization.127 The as-prepared electron-rich WS2 exhibits only trion emission at ∼1.97 eV; in contrast, the doped WS2 with a balanced level of electrons and holes shows both excitonic and trionic emissions at approximately 2.05 and 1.97 eV, respectively. It is worth noting that, as the WS2 sample was functionalized with F4TCNQ multiple times (Fig. 6h), the emission intensity increased correspondingly due to the increased quantum yield of exciton emission compared to that of trion transition.128 In addition, the report included a small yet distinct change (∼3 cm−1) in the in-plane Raman shift (E12g) from the p-doped sample compared to the control, which was attributed to the softened electron–phonon interaction.129
Organic molecules bearing electric dipoles may develop localized electric fields on ultrathin TMDs, modulating charge densities like applying gate voltage on semiconducting channels. In particular, molecules with strong intermolecular interaction forming self-patterned layers on TMD surfaces give rise to aligned dipoles in a particular direction. The alignment may amplify the effects of dipole-induced potential. Several molecules have been introduced to induce electric dipole moments on semiconducting materials, including aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS), octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS), trichloro-(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (FOTS) and (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethosysilane (MPS).130–132 Depending on the direction of the dipole moment, the molecular assemblies may lead to p- or n-doping on TMDs. For example, if an organic molecule develops a positive dipole moment (i.e., an upward dipole) on a semiconductor, it may provide a p-doping effect. Kang and coworkers reported that approximately 1.4 × 1011 cm−2 of electrons could be removed from an MoS2 transistor after OTS functionalization, while APTES-attached WSe2 gained electrons at ∼1011 cm−2.130 They explained the OTS-induced doping with the schematic shown in Fig. 7a. The TMD energy bands are twisted by the electrical dipole-induced potential on the TMD layer, which promotes hole injection from the Pt electrode. With the injected positive charges, the transistor with the organic dipoles exhibits a higher current level than the control (Fig. 7b). Accordingly, the threshold voltage (Vth) in the WSe2 transistor transitions from ∼−5 V to 5 V with the OTS functionalization. In contrast, Vth in the MoS2/APTES sample is shifted to a lower voltage (Fig. 7c), which is attributed to the dipole-induced n-doping. Wang et al. reported similar dipole-induced doping on MoS2 FETs.133 They functionalized 2-fluoropyridine (2-FP) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on 2D MoS2 layers to induce a dipolar potential. They also inserted zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) layers between the functional molecules and the TMD layers to align the molecules in the same direction (a downward dipole). Otherwise, the molecules would be randomly oriented and might not induce the net dipole effects. The aligned molecules can provide the negative dipole moments on the MoS2 FET, thereby shifting the threshold voltage of the device to a lower voltage.

(a) A schematic diagram of a dipolar molecule attached WSe2 FET along with the corresponding energy band diagram.130 Current transport characteristics of (b) OTS/WSe2 and (c) APTES/MoS2 FETs, where OTS induces p-doping and APTES leads to n-doping.130 Reproduced from ref. 130 with permission from Wiley, copyright 2015. 
Dipole-induced doping may also impact the exciton emission by controlling the charge densities in ultrathin TMDs. A TMD monolayer with a balanced charge polarity will show stronger PL than those under electron- or hole-rich conditions. Najmaei and coworkers reported that MoS2 flakes functionalized with self-assembled dipolar molecules such as MPS exhibited approximately four times greater PL intensity than pristine MoS2.134 The dipolar molecule assembly may induce p-doping on electron-rich MoS2, which can promote exciton formation, while suppressing the trions. As a result, brighter PL is observed from the p-doped MoS2. Other examples of dipole-induced doping are listed in Table 1.
3.3. Photoinduced charge and energy transfer
Molecular systems may build various energy level alignments with TMDs. A staggered band alignment may facilitate interlayer charge transfer, while a straddling band can promote interfacial energy transfer from a larger energy gap material to a smaller one. The different types of band alignment may present new ways of tunability that are not available with individual 2D materials and that govern the behaviors and functions of optoelectronics and energy devices.98,135,136Fig. 8a illustrates a staggered energy level alignment (i.e., type II) between TMD and organic layers, which may facilitate both electron and hole transfer after photoexcitation. The transfer at the TMD/organic interface is determined by the energy level alignments of the TMD's CBM and VBM against the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the organic molecule.10,25,80 At the heterointerface, the electrons in a higher energy level may spontaneously migrate to a lower level, while electron transfer in the opposite direction is forbidden (i.e., energetically unfavorable). Simultaneously, hole transfer takes place from a layer possessing a lower energy level to the opposite layer, but not the other way around.

(a) A schematic diagram of the band alignment for MoS2/ZnPc.137 The photoresponses of (b) ZnPc-applied MoS2 and (c) pristine MoS2 plotted as electric current versus time.137 Due to exciton dissociation at the interface, MoS2/ZnPc shows a faster response than pristine MoS2. (d) Work functions of pristine WSe2 and WSe2/EY hybrids with various layer numbers of WSe2.34 EY withdraws electrons from WSe2, resulting in a decrease in the work function. (e) Current (filled datapoints) and photocurrent (open datapoints) of 3L WSe2 (blue) and 3L WSe2/EY (red).34 A greater photocurrent is observed with the organic-attached TMD. (a–c and d, e) have been reproduced from ref. 137 and 34, respectively, with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2018 and Wiley, copyright 2019. 
The photoinduced charge transfer at the type II interface may govern the optoelectronic properties of the TMD/organic structures and the performances of the hybrid junction devices. Huang and coworkers investigated the effects of photoinduced charge transfer process by functionalizing an MoS2 flake with ZnPc, forming a staggered alignment, as shown in Fig. 8a.137 They observed an electron transfer from ZnPc to MoS2 and hole transfer in the opposite direction. As the excitons in MoS2 were dissociated at the interface, the MoS2/ZnPc heterolayer exhibited a significant drop in PL intensity compared to the as-prepared, pristine MoS2 flake. The exciton dissociation at the interface can also lead to a faster photoresponse. They studied the photoresponse by measuring the time needed for the increase in electric current under light illumination. Fig. 8b shows that the ZnPc-functionalized MoS2 exhibited a three orders of magnitude faster photoresponse than the pristine MoS2 in Fig. 8c.
It should be noted that, while this review discusses dark-state doping (section 3.2) and photoinduced charge transfer separately to emphasize their differences, both mechanisms may take place simultaneously in a sample. For example, EY leads to dark-state p-doping on monolayer WSe2 due to its lower redox potential than the WSe2 work function. The organic layer also facilitates photoinduced charge transfer at the TMD/organic interface, attributed to the type II energy level alignments.34Fig. 8d demonstrates the work function transition of WSe2via EY functionalization measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Due to the dark-state doping process, the EY-decorated WSe2 samples with different layer numbers from 1L to 8L exhibit a lower work function than pristine WSe2 with corresponding layers. Additionally, as the type II alignment is developed at the WSe2/EY interface, the excitons populated in the TMD layer may be easily dissociated at the interface. As a result, the hybrid junction generates a greater amount of photocurrent than the unmodified WSe2, as shown in Fig. 8e.
In contrast to type II alignment, type I heterolayers may facilitate resonant energy transfer (RET) from a lager bandgap material to a smaller one.98,138 Park et al. showed that PTCDA forms a type I energy level alignment with monolayer MoS2 on a sapphire substrate, allowing the RET from the organic layer to the TMD (Fig. 9).98 It is worth noting that other research groups studying the same MoS2/PTCDA heterojunction deposited on a Si/SiO2 substrate observed a type II band behavior, where interlayer charge transfer was dominant.100,139 The different energy level alignments with the same components may originate from band renormalization in MoS2 due to the different dielectric environments as discussed above. The sapphire and the silicon dioxide substrates have dielectric constants of approximately 11.5 and 3.8, respectively. With a stronger dielectric substrate (sapphire), the MoS2 bandgap may be reduced to a greater extent via bandgap renormalization (see section 3.1, regarding the effect of dielectric screening on the energy band), thus developing a straddling gap between the TMD and PTCDA. Fig. 9a shows that the LUMO of PTCDA is located slightly higher than the MoS2 CBM by ∼0.17 eV, while the HOMO is situated lower than the MoS2 VBM by ∼0.27 eV.98 Contrary to the PL quenching due to the exciton dissociation and interlayer charge transfer by the type II alignment, the straddling alignment may lead to an enhancement in MoS2 PL intensity via RET. In Fig. 9b, the MoS2/PTCDA hybrid has a higher PL intensity than the control (MoS2) by a factor of two. More detailed discussions on the charge/energy transfer mechanisms at the TMD/organic heterointerfaces are described elsewhere.32,111,138,140–142

Schematic diagrams of energy transfer processes in (g) 1L and (h) bulk pentacene-inserted MoSe2/GO layers.93 (a, b and c–h) have been adapted from ref. 98 (permission from Wiley, copyright 2021) and ref. 93 (permission from the IOP publishing group, copyright 2021), respectively. 
The design schemes for hybrid heterostructures have also been investigated to add a new degree of freedom for TMD/TMD or TMD/other 2D layers. The attached organic layers on TMD-based heterolayers govern the energy/charge transfer at the interface.33,90,93,142–146 Qiao et al. reported that pentacene molecules inserted between the MoSe2/graphene oxide (GO) hybrid structure may behave as an energy funneling channel (Fig. 9c).93 The photoexcitation energy in the GO layer is successively transferred to pentacene and then to the MoSe2 layer with consecutive type I/type I alignment, as illustrated in Fig. 9d. This results in an increase in PL intensity in the hybrid structure, which is significantly higher than that of pristine MoSe2 (Fig. 9e). To confirm this behavior, they explored PL enhancement under different excitation energies. In Fig. 9f, the MoSe2/1L pentacene hybrid junction exhibits a sudden jump in PL enhancement above the excitation energy of ∼1.9 eV which corresponds to the HOMO–LUMO gap energy of pentacene. Additionally, the ternary MoSe2/1L pentacene/GO shows another significant increase in PL intensity, where all three layers are excited by photoirradiation above ∼2.5 eV. It is worth noting that the hybrid junction made of monolayer pentacene demonstrates a significantly greater PL increase than the hybrid layers with a bulk (thick) pentacene layer. They attributed the difference in PL enhancement to the distinct charge transfer processes. As illustrated in Fig. 9g, monolayer pentacene may have a face-on configuration, while the thick pentacene is stacked with upright packing (Fig. 9h). The photoexcited charges in 1L pentacene may be immobile across the organic layer due to the lack of π–π* stacking. Therefore, the electrons can be readily transferred to the MoSe2 layer. In comparison, the charges in the bulk pentacene layer may be delocalized along the lateral direction rather than being transported to the heterolayer, as shown in Fig. 9h. The results suggest that organic layers may regulate interlayer energy transfer, based on the stacked topology and the energy level alignments in multilayered hybrid structures. Similar energy transfer mechanisms were reported by Cheng and coworkers.142 They deposited organic dyes on substrate/MoS2/hBN to enhance photoresponsivity via RET processes. An MoS2-based hybrid photodetector shows about 90% enhancement in photoresponsivity compared to a detector without an organic layer.
Molecular systems may also affect the behavior of IXs in TMD-based heterojunctions depending on their energy level alignments.33 For example, our group constructed consecutive type II alignments of tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) functionalized WSe2/MoS2, where photoinduced electrons in the WSe2 CBM and the MoS2 CBM are transferred to the TCNQ LUMO, as illustrated in Fig. 10a. Here, the IXs formed in the TMD/TMD heterostructure were dissociated at the TMD/TMD/organic interface, resulting in a drastic quenching of interlayer emission at ∼772 nm (Fig. 10b). On the other hand, an EY-deposited WSe2/MoS2 hybrid junction forming successive type II and type I interfaces in Fig. 10c demonstrated well-preserved interlayer emission (Fig. 10d). Due to the straddling alignment at the TMD/organic interface, interlayer charge transfer will be prohibited from MoS2 to the organic layer. The results suggest that the molecular system may play a critical role in tuning the optoelectronic characteristics of TMD/TMD heterostructures.

The interfacial charge transfer in the consecutive type II/type II band leads to a drastic quenching of IX emission.33 (c) A schematic diagram and (d) PL spectra of dissimilar type II/type I WSe2/MoS2/EY hybrids.33 Unlike WSe2/MoS2/TCNQ, the EY-layer-integrated WSe2/MoS2 shows an unchanged IX, as the dissimilar energy level alignments prevent interlayer charge transfer to the organic layer. Reproduced from ref. 33 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2020. 
Taking this a step further, it has been shown that the intercalated organic layers between TMD/TMD heterobilayers may regulate interlayer charge transfer mechanisms and govern the dielectric screening on IXs.90Fig. 11a illustrates that an organic layer, 1,3-bis(3,5-dipyrid-3-ylphenyl)-benzene or B3PyPB, forms type I alignments with both MoS2 and WSe2. Due to the large energy barrier with B3PyPB, the charges in MoS2 and WSe2 flakes may be transferred (i.e., electrons from WSe2 to MoS2 and holes from MoS2 to WSe2 as indicated by blue arrows) by quantum decay processes similar to the charge tunneling in pristine MoS2/WSe2.147 In Fig. 11b, the B3PyPB-inserted hybrid structure exhibits its interlayer emission peak at ∼1.60 eV, which is significantly blueshifted from that (∼1.55 eV) of MoS2/WSe2 heterobilayers. The intercalated organic layer may increase the separation distance between the charges in an IX and reduce the dielectric screening on the quasi-particle, resulting in a reduction of IX binding energy. Such a modulation on IX ultimately leads to increased emission energy (see eqn (1)). In contrast, the embedded EY layer between WSe2 and MoS2 flakes develops consecutive type II alignments, as shown in Fig. 11c, where electron transfer between the TMDs may be facilitated by the organic layer. In addition to the energetically favorable electron transfer, MoS2/EY/WSe2 may have improved hole transfer compared to the B3PyPB-embedded heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 11a and c, the barrier height between the EY HOMO and the MoS2 VBM for the hole transfer is smaller than that between the B3PyPB HOMO and MoS2 VBM. Therefore, a greater amount of photoinduced electrons (holes) may be accumulated in MoS2 (WSe2) of the EY-embedded hybrid compared to the B3PyPB-inserted structure. As a result, there will be an increased IX population in the EY-based hybrid and a stronger IX emission is observed (Fig. 11d). This observation is also consistent with the increased IX energy in the EY-intercalated heterolayers (by ∼25 meV) compared with that of MoS2/B3PyPB/WSe2, as reported in our recent publication.90 This is because the IXs form out-of-plane dipoles and the greater number of IXs may experience stronger repulsive interactions, leading to a spectral shift. More detailed analysis on the population-dependent behavior of IXs may be found elsewhere.148

Energy band diagrams of (a) B3PyPB and (c) EY inserted MoS2/WSe2 hybrid structures.90 The tunneling of photogenerated charges is the predominant mechanism in MoS2/B3PyPB/WSe2, while MoS2/EY/WSe2 facilitates photoinduced electron transfer. PL spectra of (b) B3PyPB and (d) EY inserted MoS2/WSe2 heterobilayers.90 Note that the IX emission peak (at ∼1.60 eV) of MoS2/B3PyPB/WSe2 is blueshifted from the control MoSe2/WSe2 (at ∼1.55 eV). The blueshift may be attributed to the reduced dielectric screening and the increased separation distance in IX. In addition, the EY layer may enhance the dipolar interaction of IX. As a result, the EY-inserted sample shows IX emission at ∼1.62 eV, which is blueshifted by ∼25 meV from that of MoS2/B3PyPB/WSe2.

3.4. Defects and imperfections
Intrinsic defects in TMDs present two opposite effects; they may be either detrimental to the unique (opto)electronic properties of TMDs or engineered to introduce novel functionalities. The methods utilizing the defects, for example, as binding sites to attach functional molecules have been discussed elsewhere.32,42,149 Here, we focus on the drawbacks of defects and how the structural disorder can be cured by using molecular systems. Electronic and optoelectronic transport properties of 2D TMDs are limited by the defects because they behave as charge traps and scattering poles. The defects distributed in TMDs may develop unwanted local potential and alter carrier densities, resulting in uncontrollable carrier behaviors. According to McDonnell et al., the TMD transistors prepared with Au metal contacts and a silicon dioxide back gate exhibit distinct n-type and p-type behaviors with defect-free and defect-rich MoS2 flakes, respectively.150 This observation indicates that the work function of MoS2 could be altered based on the defect levels. Thus, it may be necessary to regulate the defect states in 2D semiconductors.
Covalent chemistry has been widely adopted to control the extent of defects, which may be exploited to improve device characteristics. Here, the chemistry often indicates a covalent reaction between thiolated molecules and sulfur vacancies in TMDs.25,40,151 Yu et al. reported that the carrier mobility of an MoS2 transistor could be significantly improved by attaching MPS molecules on the MoS2 surface.92 The molecules with thiol groups will heal the sulfur vacancy (SV) defects via a chemical reaction: HS(CH2)3Si(CHO3)3 + SV-MoS2 = (CH2)3Si(CHO3)3–MoS2. They observed that the mobility improved significantly from ∼127 cm2 V−1 s−1 with as-exfoliated MoS2 to ∼410 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the MPS-functionalized transistor. Sim and coworkers utilized similar defect-healing strategies, functionalizing MoS2 with mercaptoethylamine (MEA) and FDT (Fig. 12a) to regulate the carrier densities in MoS2.39 Given the electron-rich nature of MoS2, the n-doping on MoS2 with MEA functionalization reduced excitonic PL emission (Fig. 12b), because the doping increased the electron population in MoS2. In contrast, FDT withdrew the excessive electrons from MoS2, resulting in enhanced PL intensity, as shown in Fig. 12c. Other combinations of TMDs and organic layers may be adopted for organic-based defect engineering and related applications which are listed in Table 1.

4. Optoelectronic and energy applications
A broad range of optoelectronic and energy applications with organic-integrated TMD systems have been demonstrated to exploit the distinct benefits of the hybrid materials. In particular, molecular systems may enhance the carrier transport and the PL yield of TMDs and control the carrier type and density as well as transfer pathways in the ultrathin materials. The organic layers can provide stable and reliable environments for TMD-based devices, functioning as dielectric layers and substrates for minimizing trapped charges and reducing unwanted phonon scattering. The organic layers in the hybrid structures may also behave as charge transport or light-absorbing layers, thus providing additional functionalities. Furthermore, TMDs and molecular systems can complement each other to develop high-performance energy devices. For example, TMDs may offer high ion capacity for electrochemical applications, while they may not provide enough openings (i.e., pores) to allow fast ion diffusion. Such a limitation may be overcome by integrating TMDs with pore-rich MOFs that present ion diffusion paths. In this section, we provide an overview of recent advances in optoelectronics and energy applications utilizing organic-integrated TMD systems. Tables 1 and 2 summarize examples of optoelectronics based on binary and ternary TMD–organic hybrids, respectively. Similarly, Table 3 introduces energy applications based on organic/TMD composites. The purposes of the hybrid structures and their working mechanisms to achieve these goals are also included.

4.1. Phototransistors
Phototransistors use photoinduced charges as information carriers, where the number of charges in the material can be modulated by light illumination, similar to gate-switching mechanisms in electrically driven transistors. TMD monolayers are excellent candidate materials for photoswitching applications due to their sizable direct bandgaps and high carrier mobility. They show excellent switching behaviors with a high on–off ratio upon photoirradiation. However, TMD-based phototransistors may have an unwanted photoconductance; that is, they do not return to the off-state when the light is removed. This may originate from the charge trapping at the interface of substrate/TMD and inherent trap states in ultrathin materials.137 The trapped carriers may delay the response time. To overcome these issues, molecular systems that build type II alignments with TMDs have been introduced. The photoexcited charges in excitons can be rapidly dissociated with the built-in potential at the type II interface, facilitating a fast photoresponse.152–156 The TMD–organic hybrids can generate a greater photoresponse than pristine TMDs, because the charges in the interface may be spontaneously transferred to the opposite layers and contribute to electrical currents. Moreover, a set of organic systems can be selected for absorbing a wide range of light wavelengths, which may enable the broadband operation of TMD–organic phototransistors.
In Fig. 13a, Pak et al. showed that p-type copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and n-type MoS2 formed a type II p–n heterojunction which outperforms a phototransistor made of pristine MoS2.155 The performance metrics they used included photosensitivity [SP = photocurrent (Ip)/dark current (Id)], photoresponsivity [RP = (Ip − Id)/radiation power (Pr)], photodetectivity (DP), and external quantum efficiency (EQE). The photodetectivity was estimated with the formula: DP = (RP × A1/2)/(2q × Id)1/2, where A is the illuminated area, and q is the electrical charge (1.6 × 10−19 C). The EQE was defined as (Ip/q)/(Pr/hv), where hv is the irradiated photon energy. CuPc molecules were thermally evaporated on MoS2, inducing p-doping on the MoS2 channel (Fig. 13b). As the thickness of the stacked CuPc layer increases to 10 nm, the threshold voltage to turn on the device gradually transitions from ∼0 V to ∼12 V due to the p-doping effects. Fig. 13c shows that both the photoresponsivity and photodetectivity of the MoS2 phototransistor increased ten-fold after the molecular functionalization. Additionally, MoS2/CuPc demonstrated an EQE of ∼12%, which is more than twice that of the pristine sample at 400 nm. The results indicate that the TMD/organic hybrid performs significantly better than pristine TMDs in the visible spectrum.

(a) A schematic diagram of a CuPc-integrated MoS2 phototransistor.155 (b) Threshold voltages (red) and carrier concentrations (blue) of MoS2 phototransistors with various thicknesses of CuPc.155 As the CuPc layer thickens, the threshold voltage transitions from ∼0 V to ∼12 V. (c) Photoresponsivity and detectivity of MoS2/CuPc hybrid layers.155 (d) Photoresponse time (left axis) and threshold voltage (Vth, right axis) of MoS2/ZnPc.137 Here, the black and purple dots indicate the rise and decay time to turn the MoS2/ZnPc phototransistor on and off, respectively. The blue dots represent the threshold voltage of the device. As more ZnPc molecules are attached to the MoS2 flake with an increased incubation time, the hybrid exhibits a faster response time and a greater threshold voltage. (e) A schematic band diagram and (f) the bias-dependent photoresponsivity of TFSA-graphene/MoS2/TETA-graphene.159 (a–c) (ref. 155), (d) (ref. 137), and (e–f) (ref. 159) have been reproduced with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry (copyright 2015), the American Chemical Society (copyright 2018), and Elsevier (copyright 2021), respectively. 
Molecular systems can lead not only to an enhanced quantum efficiency, but also a faster photoresponse in TMD phototransistors.137,157 According to Huang and coworkers, a ZnPc-coated MoS2 phototransistor formed a type II heterojunction and exhibited a significantly faster photoresponse than the MoS2 device.137 The ZnPc layer was deposited by dipping the MoS2 on a substrate in a solution containing ZnPc. Fig. 13d shows the measured photoresponse time which decreases with increasing duration of immersion. Here, the purple dots indicate the required time to turn on the phototransistor, whereas the black symbols represent the response time to switch off the device. The fully functionalized MoS2 had a three orders of magnitude faster photoresponse than the pristine sample. It is evident that the organic layer forming a staggered energy level alignment with MoS2 can reduce the trapped charges and facilitate photoinduced charge transfer.
In addition to the studies of organic-attached individual TMD phototransistors, the strategies were extended to heterostructures (e.g., MoS2/graphene).143 Zhou et al. introduced an MoS2/ZnPc/graphene hybrid heterostructure by first decorating MoS2 with the immersion method, and then stamping graphene onto the MoS2/ZnPc heterolayers.143 ZnPc molecules may behave as p-dopants, reducing the trapped charges and developing a staggered band alignment with the MoS2 layer. Thus, photogenerated electrons in MoS2 were dissociated at the TMD/organic interface and transferred to graphene which were collected at the gold electrodes.158 They reported in their original work that the organic-embedded heterostructure showed a substantially higher photosensitivity than the MoS2/graphene device.
Ko et al. reported organic-decorated flexible graphene/MoS2/graphene heterostructures, where the top and the bottom graphene layers were doped with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide (TFSA, p-dopant) and triethylene tetramine (TETA, n-dopant), respectively.159 As illustrated in Fig. 13e, the Fermi level of TFSA-graphene is located below the Dirac point, while that of TETA-graphene is higher than the Dirac energy. This allows a consecutive electron transfer from TETA-graphene to TFSA-graphene under forward bias, while holes move in the opposite direction. As a result, stable charge transport was observed across the MoS2 channel, and the device shows a high photoresponsivity under forward bias in Fig. 13f. Additionally, they reported that the response time of the ternary hybrids for turning on/off the device under light illumination was extremely fast, estimated to be 50 μs. This response time is orders of magnitude faster than the response of binary MoS2/ZnPc device in Fig. 13d. Moreover, they explored organic-functionalized TMD-based heterostructures for flexible phototransistors. To examine the long-term stability of the bendable device, they tested the retention of photoresponsivity under cyclic loads. After 2000 bending cycles, the organic-integrated flexible phototransistor shows up to 87% of the initial photoresponsivity.
4.2. Light emitting diodes (LEDs)
LED have been studied extensively as one of the most fundamental elements in display technology over past decades.160 LEDs consist of several components, including light emitting channels, electron (hole) injection layers, and transparent electrodes. The light emitting and charge injecting layers can be prepared from various organic/inorganic materials. TMD-based inorganic–organic LEDs (IOLEDs) have garnered great attention to overcome the disadvantages of conventional organic LEDs (OLEDs), including high energy consumption, instability in the ambient environment, and poor charge injection efficiency due to the large energy barrier between organic channels and electrodes.161,162 Moreover, TMDs may offer higher charge mobility than organic semiconducting materials.29 To use TMDs as charge-injection layers, researchers have explored CVD-grown TMDs with high crystallinity and solvent-processed TMDs (via solvothermal synthesis or liquid exfoliation).161,163,164 While the high-crystalline ultrathin TMDs are suitable to study the fundamental characteristics, the solution-processed samples may be useful for large-scale commercial applications given the scalability.
Guo and coworkers reported that an MoS2-based IOLED could be useful for blue-fluorescent flexible device applications.162 Their device was prepared by sequential chemical deposition of multiple layers, including MoS2 and various organic layers, on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate. As shown in Fig. 14a, the MoS2 CBM near the work function of ITO may receive electrons from the electrode (cathode) and the small barrier height between MoS2 and the adjacent organic layer allows a smooth electron transfer to the light-emitting layer. Simultaneously, holes can be transferred from the anode to MoO3. The injected electrons and holes in the LED may radiatively recombine and emit electroluminescence in a blue color range, as shown in Fig. 14b. The image reveals that the diode can operate under severe bending (e.g., with an angle of 150°) due to the all-bendable features of MoS2 and organic layers. They reported that the device exhibited nearly uniform luminescence for 500 bending cycles. Here, the EQE of the MoS2-integrated IOLED was estimated to be approximately 7% at a luminance of ∼9100 cd m−2, which is about twice as high as the LED without an MoS2 layer. They attributed the enhanced performance to the light extraction effect of the MoS2 layer, where the MoS2 flakes on the flexible PET/ITO substrate form nano-arrays, as shown in Fig. 14c. The arrays with a height of ∼30 nm as shown in Fig. 14d may reduce the reflectivity of the emission surface by suppressing the internal reflection of electroluminescence, resulting in high luminance.

(a) A band diagram and (b) photograph of an MoS2-based IOLED.162 The device is bendable and emits blue light.162 (c) An AFM image and (d) height profile of thermally deposited MoS2 film on an ITO substrate. As the thermal expansion coefficient of the ITO substrate is different from that of MoS2, the MoS2 layer fractures during deposition. As a result, the cracked MoS2 layers may form individual islands on the substrate and grow vertically. The nanopillars exhibit an average height of ∼30 nm. The pillars may suppress internal reflection and thus improve the electroluminescence of the device.162 Reproduced from ref. 162 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry, copyright 2017. 
TMDs can also be exploited as a hole injection layer (HIL) in an IOLED. Conventional HILs such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have limitations, including the acidity and hygroscopicity of the organic layer that degrade the contact electrode.164,165 A TMD-based HIL approach has been explored to overcome these limitations. Park and coworkers utilized a heterocomposite made of chemically exfoliated MoS2 and GO synthesized by Hummers’ method as an HIL component.164,166 They hypothesized that MoS2 may reduce the hole injection energy barrier and that GO can suppress the unwanted recombination of the holes and electrons in MoS2, thus enhancing the conductivity of the device.164 They reported that an IOLED prepared with a 3:2 mass of MoS2 and GO showed the highest power efficiency and the lowest turn-on voltage to yield a luminance of 10 cd m−2.
4.3. Photovoltaics
Organic-integrated TMDs are promising candidate materials for photovoltaic applications thanks to their semitransparency and strong photoabsorbance as well as their direct bandgaps and high mobility.10,80,167–170 Similar to IOLEDs, photovoltaic cells generally consist of active channels, electron and hole extraction/transport layers, and contact electrodes. TMD–organic hybrids may serve as active channels or charge transport layers. In 2013, Fontana et al. reported multilayered MoS2 as a light-absorbing channel for a photovoltaic device.171 They fabricated a photovoltaic cell by interfacing the TMD channel with asymmetric electrodes made of Pd and Au. Under laser irradiation, the photogenerated charges in the semiconducting channel were dissociated at the contact interface with the built-in potential, leading to the photovoltaic currents. They estimated the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cell to be approximately 2%, where the PCE was evaluated by comparing the maximum electrical power of the device to the power of the incident laser.
Kesavan and coworkers introduced a photovoltaic system made of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl] thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7), bis-[6,6]-phenyl C71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), and MoS2 nanosheets, as illustrated in Fig. 15a.172 The ternary composite including 30% loading of MoS2 by mass demonstrated a PCE of over 7% (Fig. 15b), which is an approximately 17% improvement from the sample without TMDs (marked as neat). They explained the enhanced efficiency with several factors. As shown in Fig. 15c, the ternary blend (Device B) exhibits (i) a greater absorbance than Device A made of organic layers alone. With the staggered energy alignments between the active materials (Fig. 15a), the composite may facilitate (ii) energetically favorable charge transfer from PTB7 to the MoS2 layer. Moreover, the MoS2 structure may play a role in (iii) increasing the carrier mobility, due to a higher electron mobility of TMDs compared to that of organic semiconductors. Similarly, Ahmad et al. reported that the inorganic–organic blends made of MoS2, PC71BM, and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) exhibit over 30% enhancement in PCE relative to the organic blend P3HT/PC71BM due to the synergistic effects between MoS2 and organic layers.173

(a) Energy level alignments of PTB7/PC71BM/MoS2-based photovoltaics.172 (b) Efficiency distributions of composites with different volume ratios of MoS2.172 (c) Absorption spectra of PTB7/PC71BM (Device A) and PTB7/PC71BM/MoS2 (Device B).172 (d) Current density–voltage plots of PBDB-T-2F:Y6 and PBDB-T-2F:Y6:PC71BM photovoltaics with different HTLs: WS2 and PEDOT:PSS.174 (e) Charge carrier lifetime (τ) and (f) carrier density values as a function of light intensity.174 WS2 has a longer lifetime than the other two samples. With an extended lifetime, WS2 offers the largest carrier density, resulting in an outstanding PCE (17%). (a–c and d–f) have been reproduced from ref. 172 and 174, respectively, with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2017 and Wiley, copyright 2019, respectively. 
TMD layers may also be incorporated as the charge extraction/transport layers in organic photovoltaic cells. Lin et al. constructed organic/inorganic heterostructures by blending PBDB-T-2F, Y6, and PC71BM with a hole transport layer (HTL) made of chemically exfoliated WS2. Here, PBDB-T-2F represents poly[[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluoro-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl[5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4,8-dioxo-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-1,3-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl] and Y6 indicates thieno-thienopyrrolo-thienothienoindole.174 They reported that the heterojunction solar cell demonstrated greater photovoltaic performances than the conventional device utilizing PEDOT:PSS as an HTL. Fig. 15d shows the current–voltage responses of the binary PBDB-T-2F:Y6 and the ternary PBDB-T-2F:Y6:PC71BM layers with different HTLs. The device with the ternary composite and a WS2 HTL demonstrates the highest short-circuit current density of ∼26 mA cm−2 (red line in the figure). This suggests that the TMD HTL may be adopted to replace conventional PEDOT:PSS HTLs, which demonstrate several drawbacks such as hygroscopicity and degrading contact electrodes. They also estimated that the WS2-layer-attached PBDB-T-2F:Y6:PC71BM exhibits the highest PCE of ∼17%. They attributed the high PCE to the lower work function (−5.5 eV) of WS2 than that (−4.8 eV) of PEDOT:PSS, allowing a greater extent of hole extraction and minimal electron–hole recombination. They estimated the recombination rate krec = 1/(λ + 1)nτ, where τ and n represent the carrier lifetime and density monitored by transient photovoltage measurements, respectively (Fig. 15e and f). λ is the recombination order determined by estimating the linear relationship between τ and n. Their analysis suggested that the WS2-incorporated device shows a higher λ (1.76) than the others (λPEDOT:PSS = 1.73 and λMoS2 = 1.67). The WS2-layer-attached organic photovoltaic presents greater values of n, τ, and λ than the others, leading to suppressed recombination. As a result, the WS2-organic photovoltaic demonstrates high current density and an outstanding PCE.
4.4. Optical memory
The industry of memory and logic devices has grown exponentially to meet the demands for fast and reliable writing/reading, and energy-efficient operation of extensive data storage. While electrically driven memories have dominated the market due to their energy-efficient switching and high-density data storage, the conventional strategy for implementing more electric circuits in a given footprint encounters several challenges.175 These include almost saturated technologies to reduce the gate length to less than a few nanometers and quantum tunneling effects through an extremely thin gate dielectric.176,177 To address these limitations, multilevel-responsive logic devices manipulated by chemical reaction or photoirradiation along with electrical switching have attracted significant attention. Such devices may enable additional functionalities for writing and reading operations.85,178–181 In 2019, Qiu and coworkers reported that a WSe2 memory functionalized with photochromic diarylethene (DAE) may be optically switched under ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) irradiation, which was used to generate four distinct current levels based on the duration of illumination.178 Here, the optical memory can write and read the optical signal simultaneously. Fig. 16a illustrates the modulation of DAE energy levels under UV and Vis light illumination against WSe2 CBM. DAE can be switched between open and closed isomers by irradiating with Vis and UV irradiation, respectively. The conformational changes regulate the interlayer charge trapping at the WSe2/organic interface, promoting the trap-induced writing and erasure of memories. Due to the trapped electrons in the closed DAE under UV, the WSe2/DAE device exhibits a reduction in drain current (from blue to purple in Fig. 16b). The current returns to the initial level (green) after Vis irradiation. Fig. 16c demonstrates the multilevel currents of the device governed by different illumination times, where the level 1 current is obtained upon UV irradiation of 2 s, and levels 2, 3, and 4 are achieved with 4, 8, and 16 s irradiations, respectively. The same group recently advanced the optical memory system further, showing 128 distinct current levels with a similar WSe2/DAE hybrid structure by controlling both hole and electron trapping behaviors.85

(a) An energy diagram of a few-layered WSe2 CBM and open (DAE_1o) and closed (DAE_1c) conformations of DAE. The DAE may switch between two isomers upon illumination with Vis and UV light, and the energy level is modulated accordingly.178 (b) Electrical transport plots of pristine WSe2 and WSe2/DAE.178 Due to interlayer charge transfer, WSe2 with closed DAE after UV light illumination (marked as ‘after UV’ in b; purple) demonstrates a smaller current than as-prepared WSe2/DAE (represented as ‘initial’ in the figure, blue) under the same gate voltage. In contrast, DAE may turn to the open state after Vis light irradiation (‘after Vis’ in the figure; green). Thus, the Vis-light-illuminated device shows almost the same current–voltage response as the as-prepared sample. (c) Multilevel current modulation with different durations of illumination.178 Reproduced from ref. 178 with permission from Wiley, copyright 2019. 
4.5. Supercapacitors
TMDs present many attractive features for energy storage applications.27 These include layered structures with high ion capacity and diverse morphologies depending on synthesis methods. For example, Fig. 17a presents chemically synthesized MoS2via a solvothermal method, with flower-like nanostructures with a dense surface area. This allows for a great extent of ion accumulation at the surface.182 It is worth noting that the flower-like structures are also beneficial in exposing their edges to the surroundings. It was reported that the edges of TMDs behave as active sites for efficient charge transport.183 As the heterogeneous charge transfer occurs at the TMD edges, the nano-patterned structures may increase not only the surface area, but also the catalytic effects.184–186 Among various types of energy storage devices, supercapacitors may be an ideal platform to fully utilize such excellent characteristics. TMD-based supercapacitors offer high energy and power densities with remarkable durability.187,188 The devices are expected to overcome the limitations of conventional electrochemical capacitors with low energy densities and batteries with relatively poor cyclability and low power densities.

(a) An SEM image of a flower-like MoS2 nanostructure, where the TMD layers were synthesized via a solvothermal process.182 The nanostructure exposes its edges (petal-like structures) to the surroundings, where the edges of MoS2 may behave as electrochemically active sites.182 (b) GCD curves of MoS2, a PANI layer, and PANI/MoS2 at a current density of 0.6 A g−1.200 The nanocomposite offers the greatest specific capacitance of ∼400 F g−1 and the highest energy density of ∼4.7 W h kg−1.

(c, d and e, f) have been adapted from ref. 191 and 205, respectively, with permission from Elsevier (ref. 191, copyright 2019 and ref. 205, copyright 2020). 
Despite their promising features, TMDs have several limitations for use as electrode materials. TMDs are inherently semiconductors; thus they may not be ideal for conductive charge collection.126 In addition, the densely packed TMDs may also lack porosity, which limits ion diffusion across the electrodes and the charging/discharging process during electrochemical storage.189 These limitations may be overcome by integrating TMDs with organic materials, including conjugated polymers, MOFs, and carbonaceous composites (e.g., carbon nanotubes and GO).126,189–199 The hybrid approach can offer distinct advantages for energy storage applications. Table 3 summarizes recent progress in energy applications using binary or ternary hybrids, highlighting the preparation methods, the electrode morphologies, and the device performances.
Conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), and PEDOT can be excellent supporting materials for TMDs to increase their electrical conductivity, reduce their production cost, and enhance the flexibility of TMD-based supercapacitor electrodes.200,201 Kim et al. introduced PANI/MoS2 nanocomposites via a self-stabilized polymerization process.200 When they estimated the electrical conductivities of MoS2, PANI, and PANI/MoS2 electrodes, the nanocomposite demonstrated an electrical conductivity of ∼30 S cm−1. This conductivity is five orders of magnitude higher than that of MoS2. They also estimated the specific capacitance of each supercapacitor electrode with a galvanostatic charging and discharging (GCD) process, as shown in Fig. 17b. The PANI/MoS2 electrode demonstrates a galvanometric capacitance of ∼400 F g−1 with an energy density of ∼4 W h kg−1 and a power density of ∼2000 W kg−1. This performance is far greater than those of pristine MoS2 or pure PANI samples. They reported that the composite shows a higher capacitance retention of ∼84% than that (64%) of PANI, which is attributed to the outstanding electrochemical stability of MoS2. For the same combination of the materials, the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrodes may be enhanced by engineering the topology of the composites. Zhang et al. prepared hollow microspheres made of MoS2/PANI, as illustrated in Fig. 17c.191 The MoS2 spheres provide ion channels and large surface areas, while the PANI layer increases the electric conductivity of the composite. Fig. 17d shows the performance curve of energy versus power densities. The topologically engineered MoS2/PANI composite exhibits a high energy density of about 30 W h kg−1 at a power density of ∼320 W kg−1.
Combining TMDs with MOFs may exploit synergetic effects for energy storage.190,202–205 MOFs are compounds of coordinated organic ligands chelating metal ions and thus forming highly ordered three-dimensional structures. Govindan and coworkers introduced such an approach with MoS2 synthesized with CeO2/C, a type of MOF.205 Here, MoS2 nanosheets provide active sites to store charges while the porous MOF allows for fast ion diffusion, resulting in a high energy density of approximately 35 W h kg−1 at a power density of ∼667 W kg−1. The MoS2–CeO2/C hybrids form hierarchical structures (Fig. 17e) which are beneficial in enhancing the structural integrity and allowing stable structural expansion and contraction during the charge and discharge processes. In their report, the electrode demonstrated pairs of redox peaks at about 0.5 and 0.3 V from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. This indicates that the charges are stored based on both surface- and diffusion-controlled processes. Fig. 17f presents the contributions of the surface and diffusion processes, where the diffusion-controlled contribution is higher than that of the surface capacitance for most scan rates. This may be attributed to the high ion diffusivity offered by MOF and reactivity by MoS2 layers of the electrode material.
With similar strategies, multicomponent electrodes have been explored by many groups.192–196,206,207 For example, Zhang and coworkers introduced multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/PANI/MoS2 nanocomposites, as illustrated in Fig. 18a.192 The nanotubes offering conductive networks behave as a foundation for the polymerization of aniline and solvothermal growth of MoS2, while preventing self-aggregation of each constituent material. Fig. 18b shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the composite. The PANI-coated nanotube has a diameter of approximately 90 nm, with the petal-like MoS2 nanostructures attached, like flowers on a stem. An electrode made of the composites exhibits a high specific capacitance of over 540 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with strong cyclic behavior, showing ∼70% of capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. Naz et al. demonstrated another ternary composite made of MoS2, GO, and WO3 (Fig. 18c).208 The MoS2 has high ion capacity, the GO offers excellent conductivity, and the hexagonal WO3 provides intracrystalline tunnels for efficient ion transport and multiple oxidation states for pseudocapacitive energy storage.103,182 The ternary MoS2/WO3/GO demonstrated an impressive specific capacitance of >800 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is over twice as high as that of MoS2/GO (or WO3/GO). In a similar study, Chen and coworkers introduced a flexible supercapacitor exploiting the bendable properties of a GO/MoS2/PEDOT composite.195Fig. 18d shows the scheme for fabricating a flexible electrode composite. They claimed that the composite is hierarchically piled up by π–π* stacking, electrostatic interaction between GO and PEDOT, and vdW interaction at the GO/MoS2 interface. They explored the influence of mechanical deformation on the performance of the flexible supercapacitor (Fig. 18e). Regardless of bending, the device showed a uniform current–voltage response with an areal capacitance of ∼240 mF cm−2. It should be noted that the abovementioned studies employed a hierarchical synthesis of the composites to exploit the distinctive benefits of the constituent materials.

4.6. Catalysts for renewable energy
TMDs and TMD–organic hybrids have been adopted for various catalytic applications, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), photodriven HER (PHER), and pollution reduction.189,209–212 The catalytic degradation of hazardous materials using TMD hybrids has been discussed previously.211,213 Rather, this article focuses on energy applications using the catalytic properties of TMD-based materials. Generating electricity from HER and PHER in water electrolysis has received global interest to realize sustainable, renewable, clean energy sources at affordable cost on a large scale.214 Such methods require low-cost and reliable catalysts to achieve high current densities at low electric potential. Noble metals such as Pt have been explored for excellent catalytic performances, yet the high price of the material significantly limits its commercial usage.215 The approach of developing hybrid TMD–organic composites may present a breakthrough to achieve low-cost catalysts without compromising high current densities.189,209,216–221 MoS2/PPy composites introduced by Wang et al. exhibited an HER performance comparable to that of a Pt electrode (Fig. 19a).222 For the composite, the molybdenum sulfide structure was synthesized with excessive sulfur. Fig. 19b shows the polarization curves of the composite electrodes. The Tafel slope (TS) of an MoSx/PPy electrode (marked ‘d’) was estimated to be approximately 30 mV dec−1, which is comparable to that of an ideal Pt electrode (marked ‘e’). Here, the TS determines the rate of an electrochemical reaction with respect to the overpotential based on the equation:TS = η/log10(I/I0),where η represents the overpotential and I and I0 indicate the measured and exchange current densities, respectively. The exchange current density defines the current at zero overpotential in the absence of net electrolysis. They attributed the excellent performance to the high conductivity with PPy and abundant catalytic sites in MoSx for efficient HER.

(a and b) (ref. 222), (c and d) (ref. 47), and (e and f) (ref. 223) have been reproduced with permission from Wiley (copyright 2014), the Royal Society of Chemistry (copyright 2017), and the American Chemical Society (copyright 2017), respectively. 
In addition to the conductive polymers, integrating other kinds of functional materials, such as carbonaceous composites, with TMD layers could be advantageous for developing high-performance HER devices. Lee et al. demonstrated that ball-shaped MoS2 nanostructures (Fig. 19c) may be transformed into petal-decorated nanosheets (Fig. 19d) by adding GO precursors during the solvothermal synthesis.47Fig. 19d shows that small MoS2 flakes are attached to large GO sheets. As the well-distributed MoS2 flakes are exposed to the surroundings, the composite material may bear more MoS2 edges (i.e., catalytically active sites) than the pure MoS2 electrode.
Besides TMD hybrids prepared with conductive polymers and carbonaceous materials, TMD–MOF composites also show promising HER behavior. Tong et al. constructed electrodes from MoS2 and a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), a type of MOF, forming highly porous networks.223 As shown in Fig. 19e, the ZIF exhibits a rhombic dodecahedron structure and presents a large surface area. The small sheets on the rhombic structure are MoS2 flakes from solvothermal synthesis. They reported that the MOF-MoS2 composite electrode demonstrated good durability that is comparable to that of a platinum electrode (Fig. 19f). They attributed the excellent stability to the mesoporous MOF structures allowing fast ion diffusion without damaging the electrode. Overall, the strategies for TMD hybrids may be beneficial for enhancing the catalytic performance as well as improving the durability.
TMD hybrid catalysts have also been adopted to generate hydrogen by converting external photon energy to electrochemical energy.48,210,224–228 The TMD layers in the hybrid materials offer sizable bandgaps with strong light–matter interaction suitable for photocatalytic effects. Additionally, the TMD-based composites provide high specific areas and fast charge transfer at the active sites.210,225,229–231 These characteristics make TMD hybrids strong candidates for high-performance PHER devices. Ma and coworkers explored photocatalysts made of MoS2 and Cu0.9Co2.1S4 (a type of MOF), where the MOF behaves as a template to grow edge-rich MoS2 nanoflowers via a solvothermal method.229 The dense flower-like structures shown in Fig. 20a expose the active edges with high surface area. Note that the inset shows the MOF structure without MoS2 layers. Fig. 20b presents the photocatalytic performances of the composites with various chelated metals, including Co, Zn, Ni, and Cu, in MOFs. Among the composites, bimetallic (Cu0.9/Co2.1) MOF/MoS2 shows the best performance at a photoinduced hydrogen production rate of ∼40 mM per hour per g in aqueous solution with ∼3% quantum efficiency. They claimed that the homogeneously doped metal ions (Cu2+) with a 1:3 ratio to the host Co ions could provide additional energy levels to promote photoinduced charge transfer, facilitating hydrogen evolution. Choi et al. introduced nanocomposite electrodes made of ternary MoS2/CdS/nickel phosphide (Ni2P)-derived MOFs to enhance the quantum efficiency of PHER.225Fig. 20c illustrates a schematic of the composite synthesis, where the CdS QDs are decorated with MoS2 flakes and Ni2P-MOFs. They reported that the composite electrode generates an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (∼73 mM per hour per g) with a quantum efficiency of ∼24%, thanks to the energetically favorable charge transfer, as illustrated in Fig. 20d. With the high PHER performances, the TMD hybrids may be utilized for sustainable and renewable energy.

5. Conclusions and outlook
In this review, we have highlighted the extraordinary (opto)electronic and electrochemical properties of TMD/organic and multicomponent hybrids based on synergistic effects between the heteromaterials. We focused on the interactions between molecular systems and TMDs, including interlayer charge transfer (dark-state and photoinduced processes), band-alignment-dependent behaviors, electronic screening effects, dipolar interactions, and defect-assisted chemistry. The discussion elucidates the working mechanisms and provides insights into how the exceptional properties of the hybrids can be exploited. We have also introduced recent advances relating to diverse engineering applications, including optoelectronic devices (LEDs, phototransistors, photovoltaics, and optical memories) and energy applications, such as supercapacitors and catalysts. The studies not only demonstrate the excellent performances of the devices but they also present strategies for exploiting properties vital to applications. Given the importance of hybrid structures in both fundamental science and for promising applications, this research field will advance rapidly and have transformative impacts in the area of materials science. Below we present perspectives and an outlook on opportunities and challenges.
5.1. Optoelectronic properties of multilayered hybrid structures
Exciton dynamics in monolayer TMDs and TMD/TMD heterostructures have been studied extensively to understand many-body phenomena in charge-to-charge interactions and light–matter interactions.232–235 Excitons in 2D materials can dominate the absorption and emission characteristics.236,237 The light–matter interaction may be greatly affected by charge densities, dielectric environments, and external stimuli, such as electric potential and optical carrier injection.91,148,238,239 Despite their importance, the study of TMD/organic hybrid materials has been limited.138 For example, the dynamic behaviors of IXs in TMD/TMD heterostructures are still not well understood, including their lifetime, diffusion characteristics, and relaxation under external electrical fields. Organic-embedded multicomponent hybrids may be used as testbeds to investigate the detailed IX dynamics. As discussed in section 3, the charge densities of individual TMDs and TMD/TMD heterostructures can be modulated in nondestructive, facile ways by the organic-layer-dependent doping processes. Besides doping, ferroelectric organic compounds, such as tetrathiafulvalene, pyromellitic diimide, haloimidazole, and poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene),152,240,241 may be adopted to provide local polarization of an electric field, which can alter the IX energy. As the organic layers may build distinct energy level alignments with TMDs, the exciton dynamics may also be studied under different interlayer charge transfer processes, such as tunneling of charges and type II junction-supported transport.33,90,242 The approaches that control exciton populations may enable comprehensive studies on IX–IX correlation.148
In addition, the optoelectronic properties of TMD/organic hybrids may be dependent on the nature of the molecular system that responds to external stimuli. As introduced in subsection 4.1, photochromic molecules can change their configurations and energy levels under different irradiation energies.178,243 Similarly, other environmentally sensitive molecules such as electro-244 and chemo-,86 and magneto-responsive245 molecules may provide additional functionalities and multi-responsive features in TMD/organic-based devices.
5.2. Challenges relating to practical applications
Thanks to the tremendous efforts on scalable production of large-area TMDs, the synthesis of fabricating millimeter- and centimeter-scale 2D TMD layers is now possible.246–248 However, the structures may still have significant amounts of grain boundaries and defects.249,250 The defective 2D layers may not have homogeneous (opto)electronic properties. Moreover, the polycrystalline structures of synthesized TMDs may hinder the uniform deposition of organic layers that are required to tune their properties for applications. Thus, it is necessary to develop reliable processes to integrate TMDs and organic molecules uniformly at a large scale. Another challenge for ultrathin TMD hybrids originates from the stability of the organic layers in high-temperature or harsh chemical environments. The molecular systems may not be compatible with conventional microfabrication techniques such as thermal evaporation at high temperature, strong solvents, and electron bombardment by e-beam evaporators.25 To overcome these limitations, it is necessary to passivate the TMD hybrids without reducing the quality of the organic layers.
Better fabrication strategies for TMD hybrids should benefit 2D optoelectronics as well as energy storage applications. In subsection 4.2, we discussed the energy storage device performance depending on both the components and the topology of the material. Even though numerous studies have provided valuable information for designing composite electrodes made of TMDs, MOFs, and carbonaceous composites,251–253 it may be nearly impossible to explore all the combinations and optimize the topology and amount of each constituent material. Thus, we now may shift our attention to another resource to develop efficient methodologies that could help us understand the correlation between the performance and the electrode structures. Here, metaheuristic machine-learning-based approaches may be beneficial for such studies.254–257 For example, Patra and coworkers utilized genetic algorithms with density functional theory to anticipate the role of defects in MoS2 to convert the semiconducting 2H phase to the metallic 1T phase.258 Ahmed et al. performed a similar computational study on the effects of porosities of electrode materials on supercapacitor performance.254 Such an approach may be adopted to optimize the pore-rich architectures of MOF-based electrodes to enhance energy storage performances. The ability of rapid calculation and data-oriented investigation without sacrificing significant physical resources will help reduce the time and the cost of the research.
In summary, TMD research, stemming from early graphene studies in 2004,259 has advanced considerably and now the benefits of diverse heteromaterials are appreciating. In particular, the most recent approaches integrating multicomponent TMD heterostructures with molecular systems33,90,93,94,142,143,159 may build a foundation for discovering new physics in ultrathin materials and give rise to additional tunabilities and functionalities for applications. Research into TMD hybrids will open up new possibilities.

 	Fig. 1  van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. (a) A schematic illustration of vdW heterolayers built by stacking various 2D TMD layers. The vdW heterostructures exhibit extraordinary properties that cannot be achieved with individual 2D layers. (b) Room-temperature charge transport measurements in a BN/graphene/WS2/graphene heterostructure,69 which shows a high on/off ratio of ∼106. (c) Intralayer PL spectra of MoSe2 (top) and WSe2 (bottom) and the spectrum of MoSe2/WSe2, showing both intralayer and interlayer emission (middle).70 (d) A schematic diagram of interlayer exciton (IX) formation in a staggered band alignment where interlayer charge transfer is facilitated. The IX has a distinct energy level compared to intralayer MoS2 (XMoSe2) and WSe2 (XWSe2) excitons.71 (b, c, and d) have been reproduced from ref. 69, 70 and 71, respectively, with permission from Springer Nature: ref. 69, copyright 2013; ref. 70, copyright 2015; and ref. 71, copyright 2019.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematic diagrams of preparation methods for TMD/organic hybrid structures. Organic molecules may be deposited on TMD flakes via solution or gas phase processes. The solution processes include (a) drop-casting, (b) spin coating, and (c) immersion. The molecules in the solutions can bind with TMDs via vdW, covalent, or electrostatic interactions and form uniform layers or self-patterned structures on TMDs. (d) Gas-phase deposition can be carried out in a temperature- and pressure-controlled chamber. In a low-pressure and high-temperature environment, the vaporized molecular flux builds molecular crystals on TMDs via vdW forces.	 

 	Fig. 3  Molecular systems on TMDs via self-patterned, defect-mediated, and phase-assisted functionalization. (a) A schematic representation and (b) AFM images of a self-patterned molecular assembly on TMDs, where organic molecules (oleamides) undergo strong intermolecular interactions, building nanoribbons and aligning in zigzag directions.96 (c) Defect-mediated organic functionalization. The molecules bearing thiol (–SH) groups fill the sulfur vacancies in TMDs.104 (d) The phase-assisted decoration of organic molecules. The 1T-phase MoS2 depicted by n− in the diagram (indicating its electron-rich nature) shares excessive charges with organic halides and forms covalent bonds with the molecules.109 (a, b and d) have been adapted from ref. 96 and 109, respectively, with permission from Springer Nature: ref. 96, copyright 2017 and ref. 109, copyright 2015. (c) Has been reproduced from ref. 104 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2017.	 

 	Fig. 4  Dielectric screening in organic-integrated TMDs. (a) A schematic diagram of a semiconducting 2D TMD partially encapsulated with a dielectric layer.110 Due to bandgap renormalization, the encapsulated region of the TMD layer may have a smaller bandgap than that without a dielectric layer. (b) A schematic diagram of emission energy modulation in an ultrathin TMD under different dielectric conditions. Here, EE and EB indicate the emission and binding energies of an exciton, respectively. EG is the bandgap energy. With an increased dielectric constant (ε), the emission energy may be reduced, thus resulting in redshifted PL. (c) Emission spectra of MoS2/eosin Y (EY) and MoS2/air.90 The organic layer with greater dielectric screening leads to a redshifted emission peak by approximately ∼6 nm.

 	Fig. 5  Dark-state doping at TMD/organic interfaces. Schematic representations of (a) n-doping and (b) p-doping on TMDs with organic layers. The charge transfer characteristics are determined based on the energy level difference between the work function of the TMD and the redox potential of the organic molecule.

(a) A schematic illustration of a back-gated MoS2 FET doped with BV molecules.125 (b) Current–gate voltage plots of devices with (green) and without (purple) BV doping. An organic-layer-functionalized device kept in air for 1 day is also plotted in blue.125 The BV-doped device exhibits higher currents under the same gate potential. Electrical transport characteristics of (c) Na2TsPc-functionalized WSe2 and (d) CuTsPc-attached MoS2 FET.126 (e) A schematic diagram of the cross-type p–n heterojunction of a WSe2/MoS2-based FET passivated with a PMMA-coPMAA polymer.94 (f) Current transport plot of WSe2/MoS2/PMMA-coPMAA devices under various source–drain voltages.94 The hybrid FET exhibits anti-ambipolar behavior in the gate potential range of −71 ≤ VG ≤ −37 V. (g) PL spectra of 1L WS2 with and without F4TCNQ.127 Molecular functionalization on n-type WS2 leads to significant p-doping, which results in balanced charge polarity in the TMD layer. The TMD hybrid exhibits both exciton and trion emission at ∼2.05 and ∼1.95 eV, respectively. In contrast, the as-prepared WS2 layer only emits trion PL at ∼1.95 eV due to its electron-rich nature. (h) Emission spectra of WS2 following consecutive F4TCNQ doping.127 The emission intensity increases with increased doping due to the balanced populations of electrons and holes.

(a) A schematic diagram of the band alignment for MoS2/ZnPc.137 The photoresponses of (b) ZnPc-applied MoS2 and (c) pristine MoS2 plotted as electric current versus time.137 Due to exciton dissociation at the interface, MoS2/ZnPc shows a faster response than pristine MoS2. (d) Work functions of pristine WSe2 and WSe2/EY hybrids with various layer numbers of WSe2.34 EY withdraws electrons from WSe2, resulting in a decrease in the work function. (e) Current (filled datapoints) and photocurrent (open datapoints) of 3L WSe2 (blue) and 3L WSe2/EY (red).34 A greater photocurrent is observed with the organic-attached TMD.

(a) A type I energy band diagram and (b) the PL spectrum of a hybrid MoS2/PTCDA junction.98 The PL intensity of the MoS2/PTCDA hybrid is normalized based on that of pristine MoS2, demonstrating an increase by a factor of 2 upon organic functionalization.98 (c) A schematic diagram of a MoSe2/pentacene/GO hybrid structure and (d) the corresponding energy band diagram.93 (e) PL spectra of MoSe2 and pentacene-attached MoSe2. The hybrid structure shows a greater MoSe2 PL peak at ∼820 nm than the pristine flakes due to organic-to-TMD energy transfer.93 (f) A plot of the PL enhancement of MoSe2/1L-pentacene and MoSe2/bulk-pentacene with and without a GO layer as a function of the excitation energy.93 The MoSe2/pentacene/GO hybrid structures exhibit the greatest enhancement under excitation energies greater than 2.5 eV.

 	Fig. 10  Photoinduced interlayer charge transfer in multilayered hybrid structures. (a) A schematic diagram and (b) PL spectra of consecutive type II/type II WSe2/MoS2/TCNQ. The interfacial charge transfer in the consecutive type II/type II band leads to a drastic quenching of IX emission.33 (c) A schematic diagram and (d) PL spectra of dissimilar type II/type I WSe2/MoS2/EY hybrids.33 Unlike WSe2/MoS2/TCNQ, the EY-layer-integrated WSe2/MoS2 shows an unchanged IX, as the dissimilar energy level alignments prevent interlayer charge transfer to the organic layer. Reproduced from ref. 33 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright 2020.	 

 	Fig. 11  Band-alignment-dependent behaviors of interlayer excitons. Energy band diagrams of (a) B3PyPB and (c) EY inserted MoS2/WSe2 hybrid structures.90 The tunneling of photogenerated charges is the predominant mechanism in MoS2/B3PyPB/WSe2, while MoS2/EY/WSe2 facilitates photoinduced electron transfer. PL spectra of (b) B3PyPB and (d) EY inserted MoS2/WSe2 heterobilayers.90 Note that the IX emission peak (at ∼1.60 eV) of MoS2/B3PyPB/WSe2 is blueshifted from the control MoSe2/WSe2 (at ∼1.55 eV). The blueshift may be attributed to the reduced dielectric screening and the increased separation distance in IX. In addition, the EY layer may enhance the dipolar interaction of IX. As a result, the EY-inserted sample shows IX emission at ∼1.62 eV, which is blueshifted by ∼25 meV from that of MoS2/B3PyPB/WSe2.

 	Fig. 13  Phototransistors made of TMD/organic hybrids. (a) A schematic diagram of a CuPc-integrated MoS2 phototransistor.155 (b) Threshold voltages (red) and carrier concentrations (blue) of MoS2 phototransistors with various thicknesses of CuPc.155 As the CuPc layer thickens, the threshold voltage transitions from ∼0 V to ∼12 V. (c) Photoresponsivity and detectivity of MoS2/CuPc hybrid layers.155 (d) Photoresponse time (left axis) and threshold voltage (Vth, right axis) of MoS2/ZnPc.137 Here, the black and purple dots indicate the rise and decay time to turn the MoS2/ZnPc phototransistor on and off, respectively. The blue dots represent the threshold voltage of the device. As more ZnPc molecules are attached to the MoS2 flake with an increased incubation time, the hybrid exhibits a faster response time and a greater threshold voltage. (e) A schematic band diagram and (f) the bias-dependent photoresponsivity of TFSA-graphene/MoS2/TETA-graphene.159 (a–c) (ref. 155), (d) (ref. 137), and (e–f) (ref. 159) have been reproduced with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry (copyright 2015), the American Chemical Society (copyright 2018), and Elsevier (copyright 2021), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 14  Inorganic–organic light emitting diodes (IOLEDs). (a) A band diagram and (b) photograph of an MoS2-based IOLED.162 The device is bendable and emits blue light.162 (c) An AFM image and (d) height profile of thermally deposited MoS2 film on an ITO substrate. As the thermal expansion coefficient of the ITO substrate is different from that of MoS2, the MoS2 layer fractures during deposition. As a result, the cracked MoS2 layers may form individual islands on the substrate and grow vertically. The nanopillars exhibit an average height of ∼30 nm. The pillars may suppress internal reflection and thus improve the electroluminescence of the device.162 Reproduced from ref. 162 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry, copyright 2017.

With an extended lifetime, WS2 offers the largest carrier density, resulting in an outstanding PCE (17%).

 	Fig. 16  Optical memory operated via the interaction between photochromic DAE molecules and TMDs. (a) An energy diagram of a few-layered WSe2 CBM and open (DAE_1o) and closed (DAE_1c) conformations of DAE. The DAE may switch between two isomers upon illumination with Vis and UV light, and the energy level is modulated accordingly.178 (b) Electrical transport plots of pristine WSe2 and WSe2/DAE.178 Due to interlayer charge transfer, WSe2 with closed DAE after UV light illumination (marked as ‘after UV’ in b; purple) demonstrates a smaller current than as-prepared WSe2/DAE (represented as ‘initial’ in the figure, blue) under the same gate voltage. In contrast, DAE may turn to the open state after Vis light irradiation (‘after Vis’ in the figure; green).
