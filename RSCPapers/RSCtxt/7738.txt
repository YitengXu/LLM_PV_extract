NF
        membranes, as an alternative to traditional ion exchange membranes, were first proposed and successfully prepared for VRBs based on a totally new concept of tuning the vanadium/proton selectivity viapore size exclusion. The results showed that membranes show increasing vanadium ion/proton (V/H) selectivity with decreasing pore size distribution. VRBs assembled with prepared NF membranes exhibited comparable performance to that of commercialized Nafion. The concept could potentially overcome the traditional restriction from ion exchange membranes and provide much more material options for VRB membranes.

Broader context
The vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) as one kind of energy storage is well suitable for large scale energy storage. Exploring new membranes for VRB application is one of the most important tasks in this field. In this communication, nanofiltration membranes (NF) were first proposed and used as separators for VRB application instead of traditional ion exchange membranes. The result shows that NF membranes are quite promising as the next generation separators for VRBs.

Renewable energies from sources like solar and wind are among a few of the central topics of our time. However, the random and intermittent nature of renewable energy is the most critical issue affecting the final quality of power output. Energy storage, especially large-scale energy storage, is the key technology to solve this problem.1 In combination with renewable resources, energy storage can increase the quality and the stability of e.g. photovoltaic (PV) and wind-generated electricity.2 Among the current techniques, the all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRBs) are well suitable for large scale energy storage due to their long cycle life, active thermal management and independence of energy and power ratings.3

        VRB, proposed by Maria Skyllas-Kazacos in 1985, consists of two electrolyte tanks containing active species of vanadium in different valence states (in the positive tank: the V(IV)/V(V) redox couple; in the negative tank: the V(II)/(III) redox couple).4 All the active species are dissolved in a sulfuric acid medium. During charge–discharge processes, vanadium ions are oxidized or reduced to their corresponding valence states to realize the conversion between chemical energy and electrical energy.5 The electrical balance is achieved by the transport of protons or anions in the electrolyte solutions.
As one of the key components of a VRB, an ion exchange membrane (IEM) is responsible for transferring ions from anode to cathode or vice versa. It also prevents the cross mixing of the positive and negative electrolytes (Scheme 1).6 An ideal IEM is supposed to have a good ion conductivity, high ion selectivity (low permeability for vanadium ions) together with excellent mechanical and chemical stability.7 Currently, the most commonly used membranes in VRB are perflourinated polymers like Nafion (Dupont).3 Even though they show both high proton conductivity and chemical stability, the extremely high cost and low ion selectivity of these membranes (high vanadium crossover) have limited the commercialization of VRB. Recently most research on IEMs has focused on non-perfluoronated polymers like sulfonated or quaternary ammoniated polyaromatic polymers due to their advantages of low cost and tuned ion conductivity.7–9 However, these membranes often suffer from low chemical stability induced by the introduction of ion exchange groups. Delamination of the ion exchange groups from the membrane structure is expected to be an efficient way to solve this problem. The basic functions of membranes in VRB are isolating active vanadium ions and transferring ions, especially protons.6 Any membranes with high selectivity between vanadium ions and protons (V/H ions selectivity) could possibly be used as a VRB separator.

NF is a pressure driven process in which liquid feeds are separated over a membrane in the pressure range of 5 to 20 bar.10 Permeation takes place through the very small pores in the membranes, or sometimes even through the available polymer free volume only. The NF process is especially suitable for the separation of polyvalent ions.11
Considering the fact that the stokes radius of vanadium ions is much larger than that of H3O+,12,13 and the charge density of vanadium ions (V(IV),V(II), V(III)) is much higher than protons, it could be possible to separate vanadium ions and protons by using NF membranes. In this case, any NF membrane materials, showing high selectivity on vanadium and protons, could be used in VRB. This concept will break the conventional idea in the design of VRB membranes (normally carrying ion exchange groups as ion transporters with dense structures) and may make progress in this area. To confirm this idea, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiltration membranes were prepared by a normal phase inversion method.14 Different parameters like polymer concentration, addition of volatile co-solvents, were adjusted to control the pore size distribution of membranes. The hydrophilicity of the membranes was improved by partially hydrolyzing PAN membranes in a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (10 wt.%).15
The surface and cross-section morphology of membranes was recorded with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). All membranes clearly show cross-sections with finger-like pores and a very thin top-layer (Fig. 1). The surface morphology of membranes shows more and more dense structures from M1 to M3, which indicates the decreased pore size distribution.
 Fig. 1  Cross-section and surface morphology of prepared membranes. 
In order to investigate the V/H ions selectivity of the prepared membranes, a diffusion cell (Scheme 3) was designed to detect the permeability of protons and vanadium ions. The left cell was filled with 1.5 M VOSO4 in 3 M H2SO4 solution (the same as the VRB electrolyte), while the right one was filled with deionized water. Both sides were vigorously stirred to avoid concentration polarization. Samples from the right cell were collected at regular time intervals. The concentration of VO2+ and H+ was characterized by using a UV-vis spectrometer and a Sartorius pH meter.

 Scheme 3  The diffusion cell for measuring V/H selectivity 
A linear relation between time and the ions concentration in the right cell is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 2. The ions permeation rate was calculated from the slope of the line according to the Ficker diffusion law16 and the ions selectivity was obtained from the ratio between their permeation rates as shown in eqn (1). (1)

All the membranes exhibited a much higher permeation rate for protons than that for vanadium ions. The selectivity of the membranes improved from 6.9 to 14.9 in accordance with the decrease of membrane pore size distribution (Fig. 2). However, apart from the size exclusion, some other parameters may affect the ion selectivity as well, like hydrophilicity, charge density etc. Further effort can be made to increase membrane selectivity.17

        Membrane performance was further investigated via a VRB single cell test.18 The performance of the battery assembled with prepared membranes is shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  
          VRB single cell performance of M1–M3 membranes. 
The columbic efficiency (CE), which is defined as the ratio of a cell's discharge capacity (Qdis) divided by its charge capacity (Qcha) (eqn (2)), increases sharply from 65% to 95% along with the decrease of membrane pore size distribution. Normally, higher CE means lower capacity losses caused by vanadium ions cross-mixing, in other words, showing higher ion selectivity. (2)
This result confirmed our idea that the ions selective permeability could be tuned by adjusting the membrane pore size distribution. The VE for a VRB single battery was almost stable from M1 to M3, indicating that the internal resistances of the VRBs assembled with these membranes are nearly unchanged. And as a result of increased CE, the EE was also improved by more than 20% from M1 to M3. The overall VRB performance is comparable to that of Nafion 117,19 however at much lower cost (less than 1/20 of Nafion).
Single cell performance under various current densities is shown in Fig. 4. The CE increases from 88% to 95% along with the current density increasing from 40 mA cm−2 to 80 mA cm−2. This tendency is similar to that of Nafion 115 membrane, which can be attributed to less vanadium ions crossover compared with protons at high current densities. However, lower VE is detected with increasing current densities due to the increase of overpotential and ohmic resistance.20 The life-time test (Fig. 5) showed that the CE of the battery is almost unchanged after running for more than 200 cycles, which is an indicator of good chemical stability of resulted porous membranes under the VRB operating conditions.

To confirm the versatility of this idea, another kind of NF membrane based on a polysulfone/sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (PSF/SPEEK) blend was investigated for VRB separators.21 The membranes demonstrated similar morphology with PAN NF membranes with a porous support layer and a very thin selective layer (Fig. 6). Relatively good VRB performance (preliminarily: CE86%, EE71%) can be obtained with this kind of NF membranes, however, the performance still can be improved by further optimization.

Conclusions
For the first time, NF membranes with tunable pore size distribution were proposed and designed for VRB separators. Membranes show increasing V/H selectivity with decreasing pore size distribution, and as a result, higher CE in VRB batteries. The membrane with highest V/H selectivity shows CE of 95% and EE of 76% at current density of 80 mA cm−2, which is comparable to that of commercialized Nafion. However, considering the complicated transport mechanism of ions in NF membranes, further optimization still can be made to increase its selectivity and battery performance, which will be proposed to work in the very near future.
