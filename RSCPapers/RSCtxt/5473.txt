    , Accepted 7th October 2018First published on 8th October 2018AbstractIn this study, we report a facile solution method to construct a high-performance photodetector (PD) based on in situ formed CsPbBr3/ZnO bulk heterojunctions. Owing to the promoted charge separation and transfer at heterojunctions, the photocurrent of the CsPbBr3/ZnO PD is greatly enhanced as compared to the pristine CsPbBr3 PD, and ZnO can passivate the perovskite to eliminate trap states on its surface and grain boundaries, which favors the charge carrier transport. As a result, the CsPbBr3/ZnO PD exhibits an ultrahigh responsivity of 358 A W−1 and a high on/off ratio of 104. In addition, the device shows a fast photoresponse (rise time: 0.88 ms and decay time: 1.53 ms). It is also revealed that the device has excellent stability after storage for 1 month in air. By deploying the PDs as an integrated detector array, we can acquire clear images. We believe that this work can inspire the facile and low-cost fabrication of high-performance perovskite-based PDs for imaging applications.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskites have attracted great attention in the photovoltaic field due to their fascinating features such as strong light absorption coefficients, facile solution processability, high photoluminescence (PL) efficiencies and long charge diffusion lengths.1–4 Noticeably, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br and I) have been successfully exploited to realize high-power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and low-cost solar cells over the past few years, and such exciting achievements have greatly stimulated the interest of researchers in other optoelectronic devices including photodetectors (PDs).5–8 To date, PDs based on perovskites with different device configurations have been widely studied, and the achieved devices demonstrated considerable optoelectronic performances. Nevertheless, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are quite sensitive to ambient heat and moisture due to the volatile organic constituents, thus severely hindering their technical applications. In comparison, all-inorganic halide perovskites exhibit higher stability and comparable electronic properties as compared to their hybrid perovskite counterparts.9,10 Therefore, the all-inorganic halide perovskites hold great promise for PD application. For example, Lv et al. reported a PD based on CsPbBr3 nanosheets, which exhibit high on/off ratios along with a fast response time.11 Dong et al. presented a PD made from centrifugal-casted CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with on/off ratios up to 105 and the photocurrent was stable after 10000 light on/off cycles.12
However, single component perovskite-based PDs usually suffer from low responsivity and electrical hysteresis. To overcome these shortcomings, perovskites have been combined with other materials with high mobility, including graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), WS2 and MoS2, to fabricate hybrid PDs,3,13–15 where the perovskites act as a light harvesting material and these high mobility materials work as carrier transport tracks. Consequently, these hybrid perovskite PDs showed largely enhanced responsivity at low driving voltage. However, at the same time, high mobility materials also endow devices with a very high dark current and relatively low on/off ratio, which are unfavorable for achieving high-performance PDs. Besides, these typically high-crystallized 2D materials, like graphene and MoS2, are generally prepared by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method requiring sophisticated experimental processes and rigorous reaction conditions.16,17 ZnO is an environmentally friendly semiconductor with solution-processability, wide bandgap (3.37 eV) and high electron mobility, which has drawn great attention in the photoelectric field.18–21 In fact, over the past few years, ZnO had been frequently used as an electron extracted layer in the fabrication of perovskite-based solar cells.8,22 Herein, ZnO is considered as a promising functional material to decorate perovskite for fabricating high-performance bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PDs.
The special BHJ configuration possesses numerous advantages for the design of hybrid CsPbBr3/ZnO PDs. On the one hand, as for the conventional one-step spin-casting or drop-casting method of inorganic CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br and I), it is very difficult to control perovskite crystallization due to the poor solubility of the CsBr precursor, therefore the formed perovskite thin films contain the defects of gaps and holes, seriously affecting their device performance.23,24 Benefiting from this BHJ structure, the ZnO additive with good dispersivity can passivate the perovskite during its crystallization period, leading to a compact and uniform film. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, the perovskite in devices may be destroyed within the subsequent use process,25,26 and the adoption of the BHJ structure provides a better surface package for perovskites as compared to the bilayer heterostructure, endowing the perovskite-based devices with better stability.
In this communication, we report a facile route to construct a BHJ structure CsPbBr3/ZnO film by combining CsPbBr3 with colloidal ZnO solution and assembled it into PDs. Owing to the electron extracting effect of ZnO, the efficient separation and transport of photoexcited electron–hole pairs were promoted at the heterojunction interface, resulting in a fast photoresponse (∼0.88 ms). In addition, the ZnO can also passivate the CsPbBr3 to reduce trap states on its surface and grain boundaries, which is beneficial to the efficient charge carrier transport. As a consequence, the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterojunction PD exhibited great enhancement in on/off ratio (>104) as compared to the pristine CsPbBr3 PD, and an ultrahigh responsivity (358 A W−1) was also achieved. Furthermore, the device also showed a high stability with a slight fluctuation of the photoresponse after storage in air for one month. Besides, due to the facile fabrication, we can easily construct the PDs into an integrated image array, by which a clear mask-filtrated image was obtained. The results indicate the promising potential of the CsPbBr3/ZnO PD for practical applications, and this strategy can provide references for other perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.
Results and discussion
The fabrication process of the CsPbBr3/ZnO PD is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. Firstly, a large yield of ZnO (ESI†) was prepared and dissolved in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) to form a colloidal solution. Sequentially, CsBr and PbBr2 as perovskite precursors were added into the ZnO solution under stirring. The CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal was thus in situ formed without adding other ligands in this hybrid system. Next, the mixed solution served as an active-layer, and was deposited on Au electrodes with a channel width of 5 μm (Fig. S1, ESI†) by one-step drop-coating, and then transferred to a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 30 min to remove the residual DMSO.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of both pristine CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid films are shown in Fig. 1b. The pristine CsPbBr3 film exhibited four characteristic peaks at 15°, 22°, 31° and 44°, which are related to the polycrystalline orthorhombic crystal structure of CsPbBr3 (PDF#18-0364), consistent with the previous reports.27,28 For the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid film, besides CsPbBr3, the other three characteristic diffraction peaks were observed, which can be indexed to the (002), (101) and (102) planes of the colloidal ZnO (PDF#36-1451) (Fig. S2, ESI†).29,30 This result demonstrates the successful formation of CsPbBr3 perovskite in the hybrid film, and also indicates that the crystalline structure of CsPbBr3 was not affected by ZnO during the process. The TEM image in Fig. S3a (ESI†) shows the good dispersivity of colloidal ZnO, which is favorable to passivate film surface traps that could guarantee efficient charge extraction and transport. The HRTEM image (Fig. S3b, ESI†) showed an interplanar spacing of 0.16 nm, which can be ascribed to the (110) plane of ZnO.31 The UV-vis absorption spectra of the CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid films are shown in Fig. 1c. The absorption spectrum of the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid film almost showed no change as compared to that of the pristine CsPbBr3 film, indicating that the original absorption property of the CsPbBr3 film was not affected by the introduction of ZnO. Both spectra exhibit an absorption edge at around 526 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 2.36 eV for CsPbBr3, which is in good agreement with the values in the literature.32,33 In general, the absorption edge is known as the Urbach tail, which is related to the degree of crystal disorder. Samples with a small content of impurities, defects, and electron–phonon interactions exhibit a small Eu and a negligible absorption tail. According to the following equation: (1)Eu is estimated as 23 meV and 31 meV for CsPbBr3/ZnO and CsPbBr3 films, respectively (shown in Fig. 1c inset). This result confirms the efficient passivation of the surface defects on CsPbBr3 with colloidal ZnO.

Fig. 2a presents a schematic illustration of the working mechanism of the hybrid PD. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to obtain the valence band maximum (VBM) according to the following equation:34 Ev = hv + Ecutoff − EFeimi(2)Fig. S4 (ESI†) gives the UPS spectra of perovskite CsPbBr3 and colloidal ZnO. Then, the conduction band minimum (CBM) could be calculated using the optical bandgap values from the absorption spectra (Fig. 1c and Fig. S5, ESI†). Herein, the VBM and CBM are estimated as 5.8 eV and 3.4 eV in CsPbBr3, respectively, while they are 7.7 eV and 4.4 eV for ZnO. In this hybrid system, inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 is employed as the light harvesting material, and ZnO functions as the carrier transport channel to form heterojunctions. Under light illumination, the CsPbBr3 can adsorb light and generate electron–hole pairs, the photo-excited electrons can be extracted quickly to ZnO with higher mobility. This unique configuration improves the efficiency of the spatial separation of electron–hole pairs, resulting in an efficient usage of photo-excited electrons and therefore improving the photocurrent of the device.35 Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed to characterize the charge separation at the CsPbBr3/ZnO BHJ interface under the excitation of 350 nm light. As shown in Fig. 2b, no shift of the emission peak between the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid film and the pristine CsPbBr3 film is observed from the PL spectrum.
 Fig. 2  (a) Band energy alignment between ZnO and CsPbBr3. (b) PL spectra and (c) time-resolved PL decay curves of the pure CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid film. 
However, the PL intensity of the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid film is much weaker than that of the pristine CsPbBr3 film, which may be attributed to the suppressed photo-excited carrier recombination at heterojunctions. This is also confirmed by the time-resolved PL decay results of the samples. From the PL decay curves of Fig. 2c, the average lifetime of the CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/ZnO films is determined to be 7.21 and 1.89 ns, respectively. The decreased lifetime of the CsPbBr3/ZnO film indicates the efficient extraction and transfer of excited electrons. In general, a photon is shed on the CsPbBr3 perovskite film and excitons are produced and quickly recombined within the lifetime of the photoexcited electrons. As for the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid film, the appropriate energy level leads to a fast extraction of electrons upon illumination, and most excited electrons contributed to the photogenerated current while only a few of them recombine to emit light. As a result, the PL lifetime decreased and PL quenching behavior occurs in this CsPbBr3/ZnO heterojunction based film.
In this system, ZnO can not only improve exciton separation but also passivate the CsPbBr3 surface to eliminate trap states on its surface and boundaries. It is generally known that surfaces play a dominant role in their physical and chemical properties, which essentially determine the device performance. Fig. 3a and b show the SEM images of the CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr3/ZnO films. The corresponding photographs of these two precursor solutions are presented in the insets, the pristine CsPbBr3 precursor displays a clear solution and the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid solution presents an uniform milk-white color due to the characteristics of colloidal ZnO. For the CsPbBr3 polycrystalline films, the observed intrinsic large defect density at the grain boundaries hinders the efficient charge transport, and gives rise to undesirable charge loss (Fig. 3a). Obviously, the pinholes and gaps of the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid film are effectively reduced by the introduction of colloidal ZnO (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c and d show a schematic illustration of the two types of films. The CsPbBr3 polycrystalline assembled film is somewhat like balls stacked together and exhibits a lumpy and fluctuant surface (Fig. 3c). The hybrid CsPbBr3/ZnO film provides a pool-like circumstance that dispersed the colloidal ZnO homogeneously to fill the gaps of the CsPbBr3 film (Fig. 3d), leading to a dense and compact film, which is beneficial for charge transport. Cross-sectional SEM was carried out to further demonstrate the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid film with a smooth surface, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). In addition, the elemental ratio of typical CsPbBr3 and ZnO of the hybrid film was confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. S7, ESI†).

Then, we performed a detailed investigation of the device performance including switching ratio, responsivity, EQE and photoresponse time. The device comparison of the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid PD and pristine CsPbBr3 PD under a bias voltage of 5.0 V is shown in Fig. 4a. One can see that the dark current of the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid PD slightly increased from 2.9 to 5.0 nA after introducing ZnO, while the photocurrent was greatly improved from 1.2 to 54.7 μA. Notably, the on/off ratio of the CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid PD reaches a high value of 104, which is one order of magnitude higher than that of the pristine CsPbBr3 PD. Furthermore, the pure ZnO PD almost shows no response under light illumination; this poor photoresponse implies that ZnO did not directly determine the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterojunction PD performance, and the enhanced photocurrent of the hybrid PD is predominantly attributed to the boosted charge separation and transfer at the heterojunctions by adding ZnO. The corresponding light-intensity dependence of the photocurrent is plotted in Fig. 4b, which can be fitted to a power law, I ≈ Pα, where α represents the response of the photocurrent to light intensity. Under different applied biases, the fitting results almost remain consistent, showing a nearly linear trend with α = 0.85. This non-unity (0.5 < α < 1) exponent indicates a complex process of electron–hole generation, recombination and trapping for our device.10,36 The room-temperature responsivity and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the CsPbBr3/ZnO PD measured under varying bias voltages are shown in Fig. 4c and d. The maximum values of 358 A W−1 and 82970% were observed at a low working voltage of 9 V, with the peak values located at 535 nm, which is consistent with the corresponding absorption band. The response speed of the device was measured as shown in Fig. 4e, and the rise time is defined as the time required to rise from 10% maximum current to 90%, and 90% to 10% as the decay time. The rise and decay time in our CsPbBr3/ZnO hybrid PD were measured to be 0.88 and 1.53 ms, respectively, which are faster than that of the pristine CsPbBr3 PD (Fig. S8, ESI†) and comparable to previously reported perovskite/2D material hybrid PDs.15,37,38

(e) Normalized photoresponse for the rise and decay time of the PD. (f) Photoresponse of the PD for 10 cycles; the last five cycles correspond to the photoresponse after storage in air for one month. 
Another outstanding feature of the device is its excellent long-term stability. The photocurrent–time (I–t) response of our BHJ PD was measured at a bias of 3.0 V under intermittent light illumination for 10 cycles (Fig. 4f), exhibiting a good reversibility and stability of the device. Remarkably, we tested the I–t curves after storing the device under ambient air for one month and no obvious deterioration is observed in comparison to the initial performance, indicating a superb stability of the device. Such a good ambient stability might be ascribed to the unique BHJ structure of the device; the CsPbBr3 perovskites received encapsulated protection provided by colloidal ZnO under air, ensuring their structural stability. Such remarkable long-time stability, together with the good photoresponse is very desirable for practical application in high-performance perovskite devices.
For practical application, imaging is another important indicator. We constructed a brief measurement system to investigate the imaging capability of the device. The schematic illustration of the system is shown in Fig. 5a. A 442 nm laser device was selected to deliver light, and a mask with the letter of “N” was located between the light source and the PD array. The light passed the mask and the PDs behind the “N” were exposed to the illumination and the others were shielded. A Keithley 2400 device was used to detect the PD currents; consequently, the illuminated PDs exhibit a high current while the other dark places show a low current. We then marked the obtained current values into an intensity distribution map, and the letter “N” is clearly presented, as shown in Fig. 5b. The result indicates that the PD has a desirable imaging capability, enabling promising practical applications of the PDs.

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated a hybrid CsPbBr3/ZnO PD based on in situ formed bulk heterojunctions via a simple solution-phase method. Owing to the suppressed recombination of charge arising from the interfacial electron transfer from CsPbBr3 to ZnO, the hybrid PD shows a significant enhancement in photocurrent and on/off ratio. In addition, the ZnO functions as a film modifier to improve the quality of the film, contributing to highly efficient charge transport. Consequently, the device achieved an ultrahigh responsivity and EQE up to 358 A W−1 and 82970% at a low working voltage of 9.0 V, and the rise and decay times were estimated to be 0.88 ms and 1.53 ms, respectively. Benefiting from the typical BHJ structure of the device, the PD exhibited good environmental stability. Moreover, by deploying the PDs as an integrated detector array, we acquire clear images. These superb device performances, together with the excellent long-term stability and low-cost fabrication endow the CsPbBr3/ZnO heterojunction PD with great potential in communication and imaging applications with mass production.
