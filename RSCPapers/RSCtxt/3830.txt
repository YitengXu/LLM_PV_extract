    , Accepted 21st May 2019First published on 3rd June 2019AbstractA new titanium-oxo cluster (TOC) with a co-crystallized dye-anchored Ti6 cluster and a classical Ti12 cluster was isolated. The Ti6 cluster is anchored by mixed dyes of photoactive triphenylamine and catechol. This is the first co-crystallized neutral TOC. TOC (Ti6) to TOC (Ti12) charge transfer was studied using electronic spectra and DFT calculations based on their precise structures. The improved photocurrent response properties of the TOC-modified TiO2 electrode are due to the influence of charge transfer and co-condensation of the Ti6 and Ti12 clusters. The photocurrent response properties of the compound for fructose and glucose were tested.
Titanium oxide nanoparticles have been extensively used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that exhibit high power energy conversion efficiencies.1 They have also been used as biological materials for biomolecular detection,2,3 and even in photodynamic therapy.4 For example, triphenylamine (TPA) dye-sensitized TiO2 nanocomposites possess good photoelectrochemical response properties for organophosphate pesticides2 and cysteine biomolecules.3 On the other hand, titanium-oxo clusters (TOCs) can be regarded as molecular analogues of nano-TiO2 materials. Based on their precise atomic-level structures, the structure–property relationship can be investigated and analyzed in depth using experimental and theoretical studies.5
We have reported that TOCs anchored with organic photoactive dyes can be considered as a new type of sensitizer (denoted as TiO-dyes) for photosensitive electrodes. The photocurrent response properties of the dye-TOC-sensitized electrodes are attributed to the charge transfer (CT) between the dye molecules and the TOC cores. The TiO core pre-anchored with a dye can also act as effective anchoring groups to increase the photocurrent conversion efficiency.6,7 The photocurrent response properties of saccharides were also investigated using the TOC-modified TiO2 electrode.8 In this work, by reacting formyl-TPA (4-(diphenylamino)benzaldehyde) and catechol (Cat) with malonic acid (Mal) and Ti(OiPr)4, we successfully isolated crystals of a new TOC modified with mixed ligands of TPA derivative L1 (2-triphenylamine-1-dicarboxyl-ethylene) (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) and Cat by in situ solvothermal synthesis: [Ti6O2(L1)2(Cat)2(OiPr)12]·[Ti12O16(OiPr)16]·2HOiPr (1). The compound is abbreviated as Ti6-L1-Cat·Ti12. This is an unusual example in that two types of neutral TOCs are co-crystallized in a single crystal. To the best of our knowledge, only two compounds with different co-crystallized TOCs have been reported: [Ti12O15(OiPr)17]·[Ti15Co6Br6O24(OiPr)18]Br·HOiPr9 and [CuBr2]2[Ti4O(O3P-Phen)2(OiPr)9]2[Ti6O4(O3P-Phen)2(OiPr)10(L)2].10 However, both of them are ionic compounds and the CT properties between the clusters have not been discussed. Therefore, 1 is the first compound with co-crystallized neutral TOCs. Cluster Ti6 to cluster Ti12 charge transfer is found in 1, which is an interesting phenomenon for TOC compounds. Advantages of the co-crystallized cluster-modified TiO2 electrode with respect to photocurrent response properties are discussed. Using the electrode, the photoelectrochemical responses of reducing saccharides are evaluated.
L1 was formed by in situ condensation of formyl-TPA with Mal in the cluster formation reaction at 80 °C, which has been discussed previously.7 Analytically, pure Ti(OiPr)4, formyl-TPA, Mal and H2Cat were mixed in anhydrous isopropanol. The mixture was sealed in a thick Pyrex tube and the tube was heated at 80 °C for 6 days and then cooled to room temperature to yield golden yellow crystals. Compound 1 was characterized by elemental analysis, IR and 1H NMR (Fig. S2 and S3†). The XRD patterns of the isolated polycrystalline 1 match well with those of simulated from the single-crystal X-ray data, indicating the phase uniformity of the sample (Fig. S4†).
Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that compound 1 is assembled from the Ti6 and Ti12 clusters in a 1:1 ratio with two co-crystallized isopropanol molecules (Fig. 1a). The structure of the Ti12 cluster has been reported previously, an elliptical Ti12 TOC core bonded with 16 isopropyl groups.11 The Ti6 cluster is constructed by two trinuclear oxo-Ti3 subunits that are bridged together by two L1 ligands via the dicarboxyl groups in a μ2-η1:η1 coordination mode. The Ti3 subunit is constructed by three edges of co-shared TiO octahedra with a μ3-O atom (Fig. 1b). A Cat ligand is coordinated on the Ti3 subunits in the μ2-η2:η1 coordination mode. The ethylene groups in 1 are conjugated to the directly connected phenyl groups of TPA, resulting in the conjugated structure of TPA with the carboxyl groups. Unlike the compounds with co-crystallized one neutral TOC and one ionic TOC, as reported by the Lv9 and Zhang10 groups, compound 1 is assembled by two neutral TOCs where their cluster sizes are matched with each other. Molecular packing is shown in Fig. S5.† Weak interactions between the two clusters via solvent molecules are noticed.

Fig. 2a shows the solid-state UV-vis-NIR spectra of 1 (Ti6-L1-Cat·Ti12) along with those of [Ti6O4(L1)2(BDC)2(OiPr)10] (Ti6-L1-BDC),7 a reported similar cluster (BDC = o-benzenedicarboxylate). The inset is the image of the crystals of 1, showing the golden yellow color. The estimated band gap energy of 1 is 2.25 eV (550 nm) and that of Ti6-L1-BDC is 2.56 eV (485 nm). To investigate whether there are electron communications between the two co-crystallized Ti6 clusters and the Ti12 cluster, DFT theoretical calculations were carried out. The calculations of a separate cluster Ti6-L1-Cat showed that most coefficients of the highest occupied molecular orbitals are mainly located on the TPA and Cat moieties, and those of the lowest unoccupied frontier molecular orbitals are located on the Ti6 cluster core and partly on the ethylene moiety (Fig. 2b and c). The calculated PDOS of the cluster Ti6-L1-Cat is illustrated in Fig. 2d. The estimated band gap of 1.50 eV is narrower than that inferred from the spectra. The larger deviation indicates that it is not just the Cat anchored on the cluster that causes the absorption shift to the lower energy ranges.

Now DFT calculations of Ti6-L1-Cat and Ti12 in a co-crystallized state (Ti6-L1-Cat·Ti12) are carried out based on the crystal structure of 1, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Most coefficients of the highest occupied molecular orbitals are also located on the TPA and Cat moieties, but those of the lowest unoccupied frontier molecular orbitals are located on the Ti12 cluster (Fig. 3a). Mixed electron transfers from the TPA and Cat electron donors of the Ti6 cluster to the Ti12 cluster are attributed to the HOMO–LUMO excitation. The results indicate that electron communication between the two co-crystallized clusters would be possible, which is attributed to the HOMO–LUMO energy transition. The calculated PDOS is illustrated in Fig. 3b. The band gap of 2.12 eV is more closer to that estimated from the spectra (2.25 eV).

Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of 1 treated electrode measured with light on and off. The curves represent semiconductive and rectifying characteristics. Noticeably, the J value is increased on irradiation in the range from −0.3 V to 0.75 V. Fig. 4b shows the photocurrent density of 1 at 0 V bias along with that of the Ti6-L1-BDC-treated TiO2 electrode, by using a two-electrode cell in an I2/I3– solution (0.05 mol L−1 I2, 0.1 mol L−1 LiI, 0.6 mol L−1 TBAI in acetonitrile). The photocurrent densities are stable and repeatable, which demonstrate the physicochemical stability of the electrodes. The current density of the electrodes of 1 is around 0.3 mA cm−2 and that of the Ti6-L1-BDC is 0.1 mA cm−2. There are mainly two reasons for the enhanced photocurrents. Firstly, the absorption of Cat is better than that of BDC, confirmed by the red-shift of the absorption edge. Secondly, the co-condensed dye Ti6 and Ti12 clusters improve the covalent bonding of dyes on the TiO2 surface.

(d) Photocurrents of 1 treated electrode in different concentrations of glucose (three-electrode system with a Pt auxiliary electrode and an SEC reference electrode in a water solution of 0.1 mmol L−1 Na2SO4). 
Generally, the TiOx(OR)y cluster can act as the anchoring group that condenses with the OH group on the TiO2 surface via alkoxy groups, indicating the increase in the photocurrent intensity.6 To further confirm the effects of the Ti12 cluster on electrode modification and electron transfer, a contrast experiment is designed. Fig. 4c shows the photocurrent densities of the electrodes modified with a separate Ti12 cluster, a separate Ti6-L1-BDC, and with the mixture of them under the same conditions. The Ti12 cluster yielded very low current, but when it was mixed with the dye Ti6 cluster the current evidently increased in comparison with that of the dye Ti6 cluster only, thus verifying the advantages of the co-presence of the Ti12 cluster. The closely fixed Ti6 and Ti12 clusters on the electrode surface can increase the electron transition from dye Ti6 to Ti12 to the TiO2 electrode.
The TOCs with TPA have shown good photoelectrochemical response properties that might help them to be used as biomolecule sensitizers. Saccharides are important biological molecules as they play essential roles in many biological processes, such as nutrition, metabolism, immunological protection and cell structure formation.12 A lot of electrochemical sensors for saccharides have been reported; however, photoelectrochemical response systems using dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes have been less reported. We have found that redox active dye-anchored TOCs can be used for sensitized electrodes to detect reducing sugars.8 This technique will be useful for detecting photochemically active species. Fig. 4d and Fig. S6† show the photocurrent responses of the cluster 1 treated electrode in different concentrations of glucose and fructose. With the increasing concentrations, the photocurrents increased though the changes are somewhat different. The mechanism is that at first the TPA group is photoexcited and transfers electrons from the excited state to Ti(IV), and then the oxidized TPA group receives electrons from reducing sugars to return to the ground state.
This mechanism is similar to that discussed for a titanium-oxo cluster with ferrocene groups.8 ESR spectra of the aqueous suspension solution of 1 and 1 with added glucose were recorded after irradiation and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Although the Ti(III) signal has not been detected, a radical signal at 2.024 (g value) was recorded which is attributed to TPA˙+ due to photoexcitation and electron transition. When glucose was added into the system, TPA˙+ obtained electrons from glucose and then the radical signal disappeared. In a photoelectrochemical cell, the current increased due to the increase in the concentration of the hole transport material when a sacrificial reagent was added.

In summary, a new TOC compound 1 with a co-crystallized dye-anchored Ti6 cluster and a classical Ti12 cluster was successfully isolated by in situ solvothermal synthesis. Single-crystal analysis showed that the Ti6 cluster is anchored with mixed dye molecules, a TPA-dye and a Cat molecule. This is the first co-crystallized neutral TOC. Cluster-to-cluster charge transfer was found firstly in this type of co-crystallized cluster compound. Mixed charge transfers from the TPA and Cat electron donors of the Ti6 cluster to the Ti12 cluster were evaluated using electronic spectra and theoretical calculations. The better current response properties of 1 are attributed to the mutual contributions of the co-crystallized Ti12 cluster and the dye ligands. By using the cluster-modified TiO2 electrode, the photocurrent responses for fructose and glucose were studied. This is an unusual example of a co-crystallized titanium-oxo-cluster with cluster-to-cluster charge transfer properties.
