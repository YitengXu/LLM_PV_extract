Recent advances have demonstrated that ternary metal sulfides (TMSs) are very promising alternatives to noble-metals for various electrocatalytic reactions, because of excellent redox reversibility and high electronic conductivity. In this review, the latest developments in various types of TMSs for hydrogen/oxygen-related electrocatalysis are summarized. The corresponding synthesis strategies, electrocatalytic mechanisms and critical issues towards the performance improvement are briefly discussed. Moreover, the potential practical applications of TMS materials are highlighted in prominent energy-related devices (i.e., overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn–air batteries). Some critical challenges and prospects for the future development of TMS electrocatalysts are proposed at the end.

Introduction
With rising global population and expanding industrialization, major concerns have been raised over the sustainability and security of our energy future.1–4 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has predicted that total world energy consumption will rise from 549 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) in 2012 to 629 quadrillion Btu in 2020 and to 815 quadrillion Btu in 2040, an increase of 48% from 2012 to 2040 (Fig. 1a).4 However, the majority of energy consumption (∼78%) will be derived from fossil resources (e.g., coal, liquid fuels and natural gas), which leads to energy-related emissions (e.g., CO2, NOx and SOx) that are harmful to the environment. For example, worldwide CO2 emissions may rise from 32.2 billion metric tons in 2012 to 43.2 billion metric tons in 2040, an increase of 34%, according to the IEO2016 reference case (Fig. 1b).4 Therefore, creating global-scale green and sustainable energy technologies for the future, while maintaining our benign environment, is imperative, but still challenging.5–9

Electrocatalytic energy conversion has been deemed as one of the most effective and cleanest pathways to convert and store electrical energy.10–12 To realize the above clean energy technologies, significant advances have been made in understanding several crucial electrocatalytic reactions, especially for the H2 evolution, O2 evolution and O2 reduction reactions (HER, OER and ORR).13–16 The combination of two specific reactions can fulfill a few electrochemical applications, as indicated in Fig. 2. For example, the combination of the HER and OER can effectively drive water-splitting (Fig. 2a), which can convert electrical energy into hydrogen.7,17–19 Hydrogen, as an ideal energy carrier, can convert chemical energy into clean electrical energy in fuel cells, where the by-product is only water.20,21 The combination of OER and ORR can realize energy conversion from the chemical form to electrical energy, which can construct rechargeable metal–air batteries (Fig. 2b).22–25 Although the reaction kinetics of two-electron transfer in the HER is facile, the multistep proton-coupled electron transfer in both the OER and ORR is kinetically sluggish and consequently needs a high overpotential to drive oxygen-based electrocatalytic reactions, which significantly limits the output performance (i.e., low practical energy density) of energy-related conversion devices. There is no doubt that developing active electrocatalysts to effectively catalyze these reactions is key. Currently, the most effective catalysts for the ORR/HER and OER are Pt- and Ru/Ir-based catalysts, respectively.26–36 As observed clearly in the volcano plots of the HER, OER and ORR obtained from previous studies (Fig. 2c–e),37–39 the Pt-, Ir- and Ru-based electrocatalysts are located at the top of the “volcano” in all three plots, demonstrating that these noble metal catalysts possess relatively high activities with balanced intermediate interaction strengths for the HER, OER and ORR.

However, the scarcity, high-cost and poor stability of these noble-metal-based catalysts greatly impede their large-scale commercialization. Tremendous efforts have been made in searching for alternative cost-effective non-noble metal electrocatalysts, such as transition metal alloys, oxides, phosphides, nitrides, carbides, hydroxides and sulfides.10,17,40–60 Among these potential alternatives, metal sulfides act as typical representatives of the burgeoning electrocatalysts for the HER, OER and ORR, owing to their unique physicochemical properties, such as good electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical and thermal stability.61–64 For instance, MoS2 is known to be highly active and stable for the HER, even in many strong acids.65,66 The density functional theory (DFT) calculations from Jaramillo et al. demonstrated that the main active sites are from the sulfur atoms on the Mo edges of MoS2 planes.67,68 Since then, MoSx-based electrocatalysts have been extensively studied for the HER. Similarly, other monometallic sulfides including CoSx,69–78 NiSx,79–84 FeSx85–88 and WSx89–93 have also been utilized as active electrocatalysts for the HER, OER or ORR. Recently, some reviews have summarized the applications of monometallic sulfides in the field of electrocatalysis.62,65,94,95
Emerging as a class of potential alternative materials, ternary metal sulfides (TMSs) have been in the spotlight recently as one kind of effective electrocatalyst for energy-related reactions. Compared with monometallic sulfides, TMSs possess more attractive structural advantages as electrocatalysts. On the one hand, owing to the relatively low activation energy for electron transfer between cations, TMSs generally possess higher electrical conductivity than monometallic sulfides. On the other hand, the existence of multiple valences of cations endows TMS-based catalysts with the desirable electrochemical behavior towards the ORR and OER by offering donor–acceptor chemisorption sites for the reversible adsorption of oxygen.96,97 More significantly, doping of a second metal is believed to play an important role in optimizing the free energy of hydrogen adsorption,98,99 leading to higher HER activity than that of undoped monometallic sulfides. Based on the above advantages, many recent studies have verified that TMS-based electrocatalysts have great potential as bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable metal–air batteries or water splitting.100–105 Therefore, TMS materials are expected to play essential roles in solving the issues of energy crisis indirectly. Considering the significance and increased research of TMS electrocatalysts, there is a great necessity to provide timely updates of this potential field with emphasis on new design concepts and significant breakthroughs in the field of electrocatalysis. To the best of our knowledge, few review studies have been published related to TMS electrocatalysts for the HER, OER and ORR. Therefore, this review summarizes the latest advances in various TMS materials for electrocatalytic energy conversion. We start with a brief introduction of the reaction mechanisms of the HER, OER and ORR. Following that, we summarize various types of TMS materials and discuss their applications in electrocatalysis and energy-related devices (e.g., rechargeable Zn–air batteries and water-splitting). Based on the results achieved in this filed, personal perspectives about the challenges and opportunities for the future development of this kind of material are proposed and discussed finally.
Brief introduction of the HER, OER and ORR
As mentioned above, water-splitting involves the electrocatalytic HER and OER that can convert electrical energy into a chemical form (i.e., hydrogen energy); and the ORR and OER can also act as reversible half reactions of rechargeable metal–air batteries. Although the underlying reaction mechanisms have been discussed in earlier research articles and reviews, we think that it is still necessary to emphasize them in the following section, because the electron/proton transfer and interaction between reaction intermediates and catalysts are the key to achieving high-performance electrocatalysts.
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
The HER is one of the most often studied half-reactions in water-splitting in both acidic and alkaline media, and has been known since the 18th century.106 The HER may occur through the sequence of Volmer107 and Tafel108 reactions (Volmer–Tafel mechanism) or through the parallel reactions of Volmer and Heyrovsky (Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism).109 Some reviews concerning results on the reaction mechanism of the HER were also published early.98,110–114 Taking acidic medium as an example, the first step is electrochemical hydrogen adsorption (i.e., Volmer reaction), in which a proton coupled to an electron produces an adsorbed hydrogen atom (Hads) on the catalyst surface (H+ + M + e− → M–Hads). Subsequently, H2 can be formed through two different reaction pathways: chemical desorption (Tafel reaction: 2M–Hads → 2M + H2) or electrochemical desorption (Heyrovsky reaction: M–Hads + H+ + e− → M + H2). The both abovementioned reaction mechanisms can also be applied to the alkaline HER, but the different pH value leads to different reactants and products in each reaction step. Given that the HER is a multi-step reaction process taking place on a catalyst's surface, it is necessary to identify the possible rate-determining step. Based on the Sabatier principle,115 an excellent HER electrocatalyst should form a relatively strong bond with Hads for facilitating the proton/electron transfer process. However, it is difficult to establish a quantitative relationship between the energetics of Hads species and the HER reaction rate, due to the absence of accurate surface-intermediate bonding energy.116 Although the surface-intermediate bonding energy is very difficult to measure, the free energy change  of Hads adsorption on a catalyst surface can be easy to obtain, and is widely accepted to identify the rate-determining step.113,117 As mentioned in the HER free energy diagram (Fig. 2c), noble metal Pt is known as the best HER electrocatalyst and correspondingly  is close to zero. Taking the value of  (Pt) as the benchmark, the larger the  value in the positive direction, the stronger the binding energy of Hads on the electrode surface, which makes the Volmer step easier and Tafel/Heyrovsky steps more difficult. If  increases negatively, Hads will possess a weak interaction with the electrode surface, resulting in a slow Volmer step. As a result, an optimal non-Pt HER electrocatalyst should possess appropriate electrochemical/chemical and electronic properties and have a nearly zero 
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
The OER is another key half reaction of water-splitting, which creates an OO double bond via removing 4-protons from the water molecule (2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−). It is widely accepted that the low OER activity at a low potential is a major obstacle for water-splitting. To drive the OER easily at a low potential, active electrocatalysts are also needed to be developed. Unlike the HER, the OER is more complex and challenging since it involves four sequential proton-coupled electron transfer steps and OO bond formation.118–121 The reaction mechanisms are likely to change depending on the electrode potentials.118 On metallic catalysts, oxygen is more likely to be evolved from the corresponding metal oxides, thus OER mechanisms also largely depend on the electrocatalytic materials and the geometry sites of surface metal cations (M).118,119 The surface metal cations are generally considered as the active sites for the OER, where the reaction proceeds by a series of metal-stabilized intermediates, including M–O, M–OH and M–OOH.118 Up to now, possible OER mechanisms have been proposed by numerous research studies in either acid or alkaline media, in which most of the proposed mechanisms involve the same intermediates (e.g., M–O and M–OH). Note that the binding strength of M–O bonds and the activation barriers between intermediates determine the rate-determining step and overall OER rates. The major difference in these OER mechanisms is related to the reaction that forms oxygen. Taking alkaline medium as an example, there are two types of pathways to form oxygen from a M–O intermediate.119 One is through the direct combination of 2M–O to form oxygen, and the other route involves the formation of the M–OOH intermediate that subsequently decomposes to oxygen.
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
In the case of the ORR, it is of critical importance to meet the increasing interest in rechargeable metal–air batteries and fuel cells.122,123 Based on the different adsorption mode of oxygen on the catalyst surface, the ORR can proceed through two kinds of ORR mechanisms: direct 4-electron pathway (O2 + 2H2O + 4e−→ 4OH−) and 2-step-2-electron peroxide pathway (O2 + H2O + 2e−→ HO2− + OH−), driven by bidentate O2 adsorption (two O atoms coordinated to the catalyst) and end-on O2 adsorption (one O atom coordinated perpendicularly to the catalyst), respectively.34,39,124 The 2-electron pathway generally forms corrosive HO2− species resulting in poor energy efficiency and cycle stability of the cell,23,125 while the direct 4-electron pathway is more desirable. The practical ORR reaction sequences are rather complicated, and involve multiple steps (chemical reaction or electron transfer) and many intermediates (OOHads, OHads and Oads) depending on the nature of catalysts and electrolytes.126 For example, a 2-electron pathway often occurs on carbon-based or transition-metals based materials, whereas 4-electron reduction predominates on noble-metal based catalysts.127,128 Because of the complex multi-steps reaction process, the ORR often faces sluggish reduction kinetics resulting in a high overpotential,129 which is a major concern in making the energy conversion devices viable (e.g., metal–air batteries and fuel cells). To achieve the high performance of energy conversion devices, a good ORR catalyst is usually required to facilitate the 4-electron pathway that can allow delivering a low overpotential and large current density. Understanding how to control the binding energies of reactive intermediates on a surface is the key to designing excellent ORR electrocatalysts. It was accepted that the theoretical ORR activity on a variety of close-packed metal surfaces could be described as a function of the free energy change (ΔEO) of Oads,37–39 which constructs a volcano plot (Fig. 2e). Similar to the HER, the Pt position in the volcano plot is also close to the “summit of the volcano”, indicating that Pt is the best catalyst for the ORR. This was acknowledged to be a simple method to predict the ORR activity of new electrocatalysts. If metals bind oxygen too weakly, the ORR activity is limited by proton-electron transfer to O2 (associative mechanism) or splitting of the O–O bond in O2 (dissociative mechanism).130 On the other hand, if metals bind oxygen too strongly, the ORR activity is possibly limited by proton-electron transfer to Oads or OHads.
TMSs for hydrogen/oxygen electrocatalysis and energy devices
As discussed above, noble metal Pt-based catalysts are well known to be the most active catalysts for the HER and ORR, while Ru/Ir-based materials are employed as excellent OER catalysts. Nevertheless, a common viewpoint is that these noble metal-based materials are not ideal catalysts owing to their low reserves, expensiveness and poor stabilities. Therefore, it is greatly important and highly desirable to develop high-performance and cost-effective alternatives to conventional noble metal catalysts. Recently, TMS materials have emerged as one type of active electrocatalyst for hydrogen/oxygen electrocatalysis. Considering the rapid progress of TMSs, the section below summarizes their most recent progress and research trends in the field of electrocatalysis. The various strategies through engineering the composition and structure via using different synthesis methods including hydrothermal, electrodeposition, precipitation, electrospinning, refluxing and hot injection methods for the performance improvement are introduced and highlighted.
Ternary nickel cobalt sulfides (Ni–Co–S)
Ternary nickel cobalt sulfides (Ni–Co–S) with various compositions, such as NiCo2S4,100–102,131–142 CoNi2S4,143–145 Ni3.5Co3.5S8,146 Ni0.33Co0.67S2 (ref. 147) and Co0.9Ni0.1S2,148 have been intensively synthesized and investigated for electrocatalysis and energy conversion devices. Among these Ni–Co–S materials, ternary NiCo2S4 and CoNi2S4 thiospinels have attracted more interest and attention. From the perspective of the ternary thiospinel crystal structure, two types of metal cations occupy the octahedral and tetrahedral sites of a close-packed S anionic lattice, respectively.139,149 Such a structure endues itself with good electrical conductivity owing to low energy electron hopping between cations of different valence states;139,149 and also offers abundant surface redox centres for the adsorption and activation of oxygen.139 For NiCo2S4, Zhang et al. for the first time experimentally demonstrated its outstanding electrocatalytic properties for both the OER and ORR, using N and S codoped reduced graphene oxide (NiCo2S4@N/S-rGO) as an electronic conductor.141 Such a NiCo2S4@N/S-rGO composite was prepared by a facile one-pot solvothermal method using cobalt acetate, nickel acetate, thiourea, and GO as precursors in the presence of ethylene glycol (EG). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that NiCo2S4 nanoparticles are selectively and uniformly grown on rGO nanosheets (Fig. 3a). With Ni doping into cobalt sulfides, the NiCo2S4@N/S-rGO composite exhibits not only excellent OER activity but also much better ORR activity than the Ni-free Co3S4@N/S-rGO sample (Fig. 3b–c). The authors found that the introduction of Ni2+ into Co3S4 also has a positive effect on the overall bifunctional activity (Fig. 3d). As observed, the overall oxygen activity (ΔE = EJ10 − E1/2, EJ10 is the overpotential of the OER at 10 mA cm−2 and E1/2 is the half-wave potential) of NiCo2S4@N/S-rGO presents a smaller value of 0.94 V vs. RHE than 20% Pt/C (1.10 V). The results indicate that the mixed-valence in NiCo2S4 nanocrystals is helpful for oxygen reversible absorption and easier electron transfer. It should be worth noting that strong coupling between N/S-rGO and NiCo2S4 nanoparticles is another factor for the improved bifunctional activities. The authors explained that apart from anchoring and dispersing nanoparticles, N/S-rGO also serves as a three-dimensional (3D) diffusion and conductive channel to promote the mass and electron transfer on the electrode surface. Inspired by this viewpoint, various conductive substrates have been used to anchor NiCo2S4 nanocrystals, such as carbon nanotubes,101 graphene foam,132 carbon nanofibers,135 and carbon nanosheets.131 For example, a S-doped graphene nanosheet (S-GNS) wrapped urchin-like NiCo2S4 microsphere (S-GNS/NiCo2S4) was also prepared by Liu et al. via a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent sulfurization treatment.100 Compared with carbon-free NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4 catalysts, S-GNS/NiCo2S4 exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the ORR (half-wave potential of 0.88 V) and OER (overpotential of 0.33 V at 10 mA cm−2), indicating the importance of the synergistic effect between NiCo2S4 and S-GNS. The Zn–air battery constructed with S-GNS/NiCo2S4 exhibits a high power density (216.3 mW cm−2) and excellent cycling stability (100 h), notably outperforming the costlier Pt/C + Ir/C catalyst, demonstrating its practical application. Given the poor electrical conductivity of NiCo2S4, anchoring NiCo2S4 nanocrystals on conductive carbon substrates is of great benefit to improve its activity. Except for improving the conductivity, S-GNS also can maintain the structural integrity of the catalyst during the charge–discharge process owing to the robust nature of S-GNS, which was confirmed through in situ TEM analysis by the authors. It is noteworthy that more recently carbon-free conductive substrates have been adopted to support NiCo2S4 nanocrystals.133,136,143 A recent research study by the Shanmugam group reported a pressurized two-step hydrothermal method (Fig. 3e) for the in situ growth of hierarchical NiCo2S4 nanowire arrays on an Ni foam (NiCo2S4 NW/NF).136 The as-prepared NiCo2S4 NW/NF composite displays lower overpotentials of 210 and 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the alkaline HER and OER, respectively, significantly superior to the activities of pure NiCo2S4 (Fig. 3f–g). They attributed such superior activity to the in situ growth of hierarchical NiCo2S4 on the Ni foam without any binder, which not only improves the mechanical adhesion and electrical conductivity, but also endows NiCo2S4 with a larger specific surface area and more exposed active sites available for electrochemical redox reactions. Because of the outstanding bifunctional properties for both the HER and OER, the NiCo2S4 NW/NF afforded vigorous and continuous evolution of H2 and O2 at 10 mA cm−2 at a voltage of 1.63 V. This demonstration of solar-to-hydrogen generation through water-splitting is the first example using a bifunctional electrocatalyst.

We have noted that the above-mentioned NiCo2S4 nanocrystals present a unique nanostructure or morphology, which is believed to be important for improving the electrocatalytic performance. This is because the electrocatalytic reactions are highly structure-sensitive and involve both the surface adsorption/desorption and the interface catalytic process.150 Therefore, nanostructure/morphology engineering is another effective method to tune the electrocatalytic performance of NiCo2S4 catalysts. Recently, various nanostructured NiCo2S4 including urchin-like structures,100,134,139 lily-like structures,143 nanowire arrays,136,138 hollow microspheres102,131,142 and hierarchically porous structures132,133,135 were prepared through different synthesis strategies, and successfully applied in the HER, OER and ORR. One notable example is given by Liu et al., who developed a highly active HER electrocatalyst containing hierarchical P-doped NiCo2S4 nanocrystals grown on carbon nanotube reinforced carbon nanofibers (P-NiCo2S4@CNT/CNF).135 The synthesis of such a composite is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4a. The CNTs were first embedded into the CNF membrane using a co-electrospinning method. This step is aimed at increasing the conductivity of the CNT template and facilitate the charge transfer between the CNT/CNF and NiCo2S4 nanocrystals. With the CNT/CNF network as the template, the hierarchical NiCo2S4 can be confined to grow perpendicularly onto its surface by a facile hydrothermal reaction. To improve the electronic structure of NiCo2S4, the authors finally introduced P into NiCo2S4@CNT/CNF through a phosphidation reaction forming the P-NiCo2S4@CNT/CNF composite. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown in Fig. 4b and c clearly demonstrate the hierarchical porous structure of P-NiCo2S4@CNT/CNF. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the hierarchical porous architecture and P-doping P-NiCo2S4, P-NiCo2S4@CNT/CNF exhibits outstanding HER performance (Fig. 4d) with a low onset overpotential of 27 mV, an impressive exchange current density of 0.79 mA cm−2 and excellent long-term stability. Compared with bulk materials, hierarchical porous nanostructures can offer multiple advantages including a large active surface area, easy accessibility of active sites, enhanced mass/electron transfer and ready release of H2 bubbles. Hollow nanostructures are another kind of favorable architecture, owing to their similar structural merits to hierarchical porous structures.151,152 Generally, template methods are deemed to be the most effective for controllable synthesis of hollow nanostructures. One of the related studies was reported by Li et al.131 They reported an effective in situ template removal method for the fabrication of hollow NiCo2S4@C nanospheres (NiCo2S4@C HNSs). As elucidated by SEM and TEM (Fig. 4e and f), the obtained hollow nanospheres are assembled with ultrathin nanosheets, in which numerous scattered NiCo2S4 nanoparticles are embedded in ultrathin carbon nanosheets. Owing to the intriguing structural features, NiCo2S4@C HNSs display excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for the ORR (Fig. 4g), superior to those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Such a nanostructure/morphology engineering strategy has often been utilized to CoNi2S4,143–145 which is another typical ternary nickel cobalt sulfide. For instance, Yuan et al. designed and fabricated 3D lily-like CoNi2S4/Ni electrocatalysts (Fig. 4h) through a facile sulfuration of CoNi-precursor/Ni.143 CoNi2S4/Ni exhibited excellent electrochemical properties and it only requires an overpotential of 54 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and 328 mV at 100 mA cm−2 for the HER and OER, respectively. By using CoNi2S4/Ni as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 could be obtained at a voltage of only 1.56 V. The good electrochemical properties of CoNi2S4/Ni may have stemmed from the following factors: (i) 3D porous lily-like morphology not only exposes more catalytically active sites, but also facilitates the contact between the electrolyte and active sites, thus improving the utilization efficiency of catalysts; (ii) Niδ+ and Sδ−species within CoNi2S4/Ni can act as hydride acceptors and proton acceptors to accelerate the HER process; (iii) CoNi2S4 directly grown on Ni foam without using a binder endows the electrode with efficient charge transfer in water splitting.

Recently, other mixed-valence Ni–Co sulfides with different compositions have also attracted much attention as electrocatalysts. For instance, Kim et al. prepared a Ni3.5Co5.5S8 nanocrystal via the solvothermal sulfurization and thermal calcination of pre-formed bimetallic metal–organic frameworks, and investigated their OER activity.146 The resulting Ni3.5Co5.5S8 nanocrystal presents a cage-like hollow morphology with numerous ultrathin nanosheets grown on the surface, as evidenced by SEM (Fig. 5a) and elemental mapping (Fig. 5b). After the incorporation of Ni into cobalt sulfide, hollow ternary Ni3.5Co5.5S8 nanocages revealed better electrocatalytic performance for the OER than the pure Co9S8 sample. The pure Co9S8 sample required an overpotential of 400 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5c), which is much higher than that of Ni3.5Co5.5S8 (333 mV). Moreover, at a potential of 1.8 V, the current density of Ni3.5Co5.5S8 is approximately 73.2 mA cm−2, which is much higher than that of pure Co9S8 (49.25 mA cm−2). Regarding the catalytic mechanism, they attributed the enhanced activity to the increased electroactive sites via substitution of Co cations, which can not only modify the electronic structure of the hybrid, but also facilitate the adsorption of OH ions. Similarly, Zheng et al. also highlighted the benefits of mixed-valence Ni–Co sulfides for electrocatalysis. They prepared Ni0.33Co0.67S2 nanowires by sulfurization of NiCo2O4 nanowires (Fig. 5d), in which the NiCo2O4 nanowires are directly grown on conductive Ti foil. The pyrite-type nanowire morphology was well confirmed by SEM and TEM images (Fig. 5e and f). In comparison with monometallic Ni- or Co-sulfides, the developed Ni0.33Co0.67S2 nanowires demonstrated robust electrocatalytic OER activity with low onset potentials and small Tafel slopes, in both acidic (Fig. 5g) and neutral (Fig. 5h) electrolytes. By combining NiCo2O4 nanowires (active for the OER) and Ni0.33Co0.67S2 nanowires together, a homologous all-nanowire-based system for water splitting was established by the authors. An onset potential of 1.60 V was obtained and the current density reached 5 mA cm−2 at a bias of 1.65 V (Fig. 5i). According to the above discussion, nickel cobalt sulfides have superior electrocatalytic properties for different catalytic reactions including the ORR, OER and HER, which makes them have great potential in practical applications such as rechargeable metal–air batteries and water-splitting.

Ternary Fe-based sulfides (Fe–M–S)
Apart from ternary Ni–Co–S materials, ternary Fe-based sulfides (Fe–M–S) have also been reported to improve HER, OER and ORR performances.153–161 A typical study was first demonstrated by Yang et al., in which Fe-doped NiS2 nanosheets exhibited excellent activity and stability in strongly acidic media as a HER catalyst.153 Such an iron-nickel sulfide (INS) catalyst was synthesized via topotactic sulfidation of FeNi layered double hydroxides, which shows an ultrathin sheet-like structure (Fig. 6a). The electrochemical experiments (Fig. 6b) proved that the INS nanosheets delivered a much lower overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (105 mV) and a smaller Tafel slope (40 mV dec−1) than monometallic NiS catalysts. To demonstrate the enhanced HER performance arising from the Fe-doping, the authors further carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigated the detailed HER pathways. According to the DFT calculation, the HER pathways can include three necessary steps (Fig. 6c): (i) one H+ proton was first adsorbed in a surface interstice; (ii) another proton got close to the adsorbed proton (Had) to form an adsorbed H2; (iii) the absorbed H2 finally makes its way to desorption after migrating to a metal site. They found that while H2 is formed on the Ni site on the surface of NiS, it prefers to form on the Fe site of INS. The DFT results indicated that the Fe-doping can modulate the kinetics and energetics for the proton adsorption and H2 production, which contributes to the enhanced HER activity. This work is the first study on multi-metal sulfide nanosheets with atomic thickness as HER electrocatalysts, which opens an exciting avenue to expand the family of cost-effective HER electrocatalysts.

Another interesting Fe–Ni–S material was designed and reported by Yu et al.154 They for the first time synthesized 2D ultrathin ternary FeNiS2 nanosheets (NSs) by a simple colloidal strategy (Fig. 7a and b) and used them as bifunctional oxygen catalysts. When acting as an OER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium, the FeNiS2 NSs revealed superior electrocatalytic activity over monometallic Ni/Fe sulfides and even commercial RuO2 catalysts, with a low overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 46 mV dec−1 (Fig. 7c). In catalyzing the ORR under neutral conditions (Fig. 7d), the FeNiS2 NSs displayed a higher onset potential (0.78 V), smaller Tafel slope (107 mV dec−1) and better selectivity (electron transfer number: 3.92; H2O2%: 3.6% at 0.3 V) than monometallic Ni/Fe sulfides. Additionally, the overall oxygen activities (ΔE = EJ10 − E1/2) of FeNiS2, Ni9S8 and FeS samples were calculated to be about 0.95, 1.16 and 1.63 V, respectively, indicating the better bifunctional activity of FeNiS2 NSs. As explained by the authors, the outstanding bifunctional activity of FeNiS2 NSs may stem from the synergistic merits of the ultrathin 2D sheet-like structure and ternary Fe–Ni–S composition. On the one hand, ultrathin 2D nanosheets enabled the full utilization of active sites of FeNiS2; on the other hand, the combination of Fe and Ni components improved the electronic structure of FeNiS2, which is beneficial to modulate the electrochemical behaviors. Similar to the Fe–Ni–S system, the Fe-doped CoS materials are also a kind of active material.155,159 For example, Lu et al. report a facile soft-template mediated method for the synthesis of Co0.5Fe0.5S nanoparticles covalently entrapped in N-doped mesoporous carbon (Co0.5Fe0.5S@N-MC, Fig. 7e), in which Pluronic F127 acted as the soft template and thiourea was adopted as the carbon and sulfur source. The obtained Co0.5Fe0.5S@N-MC not only exhibits prominent electrocatalytic activity and stability for the ORR (Fig. 7f), but also offers impressive catalytic activity for the OER under alkaline conditions (Fig. 7g). It was believed that moderate substitution and well-dispersion of Fe in Co0.5Fe0.5S have a positive effect on the adsorption and activation of oxygen species, resulting in conspicuous enhancement of ORR and OER activities compared to their monometallic counterparts. Moreover, the covalent bridge between active Co0.5Fe0.5S nanoparticles and mesoporous carbon shells offers smooth pathways for mass and electron transfer. Although some promising advances have been made recently, the research based on such ternary Fe-based sulfides is still in infancy, and more work is needed.

Ternary Cu-based sulfides (Cu–M–S)
Since the seminal work of Tran and co-workers,162 ternary Cu-based sulfides (Cu–M–S, M = Mo, W, Co, etc.) have been recently studied and proven to be a kind of potential electrocatalyst.103,145,149,162–168 Tran and co-workers focused on the layered ternary copper-molybdenum-sulfide, Cu2MoS4, which is a new inorganic solid state HER electrocatalyst. This Cu2MoS4 material was prepared via a simple precipitation method from CuI and [MoS4]2− precursors developed by Pruss et al.169 The crystal structure of Cu2MoS4 with tetragonal P42m symmetry was verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. 8a). The crystal structure of Cu2MoS4 consists of layered sheets with an interlamellar spacing of 2.49 Å along the c-axis, formed by interlinked Cu and Mo atoms tetrahedrally coordinated to bridging S atoms (Fig. 8b). It was demonstrated that such S ligands bridging Cu and Mo centres constitute a minimal structure required for the catalytic HER. Experimentally, they found that Cu2MoS4 catalyzes the HER over a wide pH range (pH = 0, 6 and 7) with an overpotential requirement of only about 135 mV (Fig. 8c) and a similar Tafel slope of 95 mV dec−1 (Fig. 8d). The authors established DFT calculations to study the reaction mechanism and identify the active sites. Through the DFT calculated results, they found that H2 spontaneously evolves from two possible reaction intermediate states (Fig. 8e). One is a MoVI-hydride centre with an adjacent protonated bridging sulfur ligand, which was defined as [H-MoVI(m-SH)CuI]. The other intermediate state is H2 that evolves when an electron is added to the 1e-reduced [MoV{(μ-SH)CuI}2] motif, in which two S ligands bridging one Mo and two distinct Cu centres are protonated. This work provides guidelines for future investigation of the catalytic mechanism of the HER with Cu2MoS4 as the catalyst. Owing to a similar crystal structure to Cu2MoS4, copper-tungsten-sulfide (Cu2WS4) has also attracted great attention recently. One of the studies related to this material was reported by Ozel et al., using Cu2WS4 nanocubes as effective HER catalysts at a biomembrane-like polarized water/1,2-dichloroethane interface for the first time.163 When compared to an uncatalyzed reaction, the rate of hydrogen evolution is increased by around 1000 times by using Cu2WS4 nanocubes. To further improve the HER activities of Cu2MoS4 and Cu2WS4, very recently, the anion S was substituted by larger-sized Se atoms forming Cu2Mo(SySe1−y) or Cu2W(SySe1−y).165,166 For example, the anion substituted Cu2W(SySe1−y) could deliver a low onset potential of −0.32 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the HER, which is 2-fold lower than that of pristine Cu2WS4 (−0.65 V).165 The corresponding DFT calculations suggest that with an increasing number of Se atoms, the chemical strain in the lattice would increase, which causes an increase of active sites for hydrogen adsorption and desorption.

The copper–cobalt–sulfide (Cu–Co–S) is an active electrocatalytic material with similar catalytic properties to other ternary sulfides.103,145,164,167 As a member of ternary thiospinels, CuCo2S4 naturally exists in carrollite with unique oxidation states for Cu+1 and Co+2.4 ions,170 unlike other thiospinels. Strikingly, it possesses s-wave super-conductivity at low temperature and low resistivity (10−4 Ω) under ambient conditions,171 which are good for electrocatalysis. Inspired by these merits, researchers have been designing various electrocatalysts based on CuCo2S4. In 2016, Han et al. prepared 2D CuCo2S4 nanosheets (CuCo2S4 NSs, Fig. 9a) through a “levelling metal reactivity and structure-directed one-pot sulfurization” strategy.149 When evaluated as an electrocatalyst, high catalytic activity and remarkable stability for catalyzing the ORR and OER were demonstrated (Fig. 9b and c). Through DFT calculations as shown in Fig. 9d and e, they found that the (111) plane shows poor catalytic performance owing its strong adsorption for adsorbates, while (022) and (004) planes are in favor of the ORR and OER, respectively. More recently, exfoliation-derived metallic CuCo2S4 nanosheets (NSs) with a metallic atomic thickness were successfully developed by Xi and co-workers.167 The atomic thickness sheet-like nanostructure with 4-atom-thick to 6-atom-thick layers was confirmed by TEM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 9f–i). Such CuCo2S4 NSs were prepared through a two-step procedure: (i) the hydrothermal synthesis of bulk CuCo2S4; (ii) exfoliating bulk CuCo2S4 with formamide as an exfoliation agent via ultrasonication. Stemming from the synergistic effect of the ultrathin sheet-like structure, intrinsic electrical conductivity and abundant sulfur vacancies, the as-prepared CuCo2S4 NSs exhibited excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic properties (Fig. 9j and k) with a small overpotential for the OER (287 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and a high half-wave potential for the ORR (0.70 V). As an air-cathode for Zn–air batteries, the optimal CuCo2S4 NSs exhibited a high energy density of 424 W h kg−1 and good cycling durability for more than 18 h (Fig. 9l). Considering the above results, CuCo2S4 should be one of the most efficient catalysts in the current spinel bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst family, showing great potential for use in rechargeable metal–air batteries. Unfortunately, the location of the active sites of these catalysts is still to be determined.

Ternary Mo-based sulfides (M–Mo–S)
Recently, MoSx materials have been most extensively studied as promising non-Pt catalysts for the HER. Unfortunately, the low conductivity, limited surface area and activation of the inactive edges of MoSx still pose challenges.172,173 To address this problem, the doping of a foreign metal element (M) into the MoSx lattice affords the opportunity to improve its HER performance via engineering the electronic and/or surface structure. To date, various ternary M–Mo–S (M = Co, Ni, Fe, Cu, etc.) sulfides have been developed to improve electrocatalytic hydrogen production.105,162,174–183 A brilliant study conducted by Dai et al.175 reported a facile and effective deposition–precipitation method to fabricate Co-doped MoS2 with a few layers on carbon black (CoMoS–C) as a non-Pt electrocatalyst for the HER. The optimized Co-doped MoS2 (Co/Mo = 0.2, molar ratio, CoMoS-2-C) exhibited superior HER performance (Fig. 10a) with a low onset potential (90 mV), a high exchange current density (0.03 mA cm−2) and a small Tafel slope (50 mV dec−1) as well as excellent cycling stability, which is much better than those of carbon supported MoS2. The result indicates that Co-doping promotes the improvement of HER activity. Fig. 10b shows the origin of the promotion by Co doping, using pure MoS2 as a model catalyst. Generally, bulk MoS2 has the shape of truncated triangles and predominating Mo-edge sites for the HER. Note that the S-edges are not catalytically active for the HER. The Co atoms substitute Mo atoms in the MoS2 matrix toward one side and bond with only four S atoms, leading to the Co–Mo–S phase with an edge-terminated hexagonal structure. The edge-terminated nanostructure is beneficial to expose more active edge-sites.184,185 In addition, the Co–Mo–S phase provides electronic and structural regulations via engineering Mo–S edges to lower the adsorption free energy (ΔGoH) from 0.18 to 0.10 eV at the active sites, which facilitates proton adsorption kinetics. Similar improvements of HER performance were observed in the Ni-doped MoSx system. For instance, Yan et al. demonstrated a novel hollow NiMo3S4 Chevrel-phase as a high-performance HER catalyst.177 Unlike conventional high temperature synthesis methods to access the Chevrel-phase structure, herein, the authors prepared Chevrel-phase NiMo3S4 through a template-directed method (Fig. 10c) through anion exchange of a freshly made Ni(OH)2 precursor with (MoS4)2− ions in a closed N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvothermal system. The plate-like hollow nanostructures of Chevrel-phase NiMo3S4 were confirmed by TEM images, as shown in Fig. 10d. The obtained NiMo3S4 exhibited excellent HER performance with an onset potential of −59 mV, a Tafel slope of 98 mV dec−1 and an exchange current density of 3.9 × 10−2 mA cm−2 (Fig. 10e and f). A similar result has also been observed by Hu et al. for Fe, Co or Ni-doped MoS2 films, whose active surface areas were 1.4–3.3 times that of un-doped MoS2+x films.186

Considering different the electrochemical properties of various metal elements, the influence of first-row transition metals (M = Co, Ni, Fe, Cu, etc.) on the HER activity of MoSx (x = 2 or 3) was also investigated systematically.174,175,181,182 From an experimental viewpoint, Dai et al. demonstrated that the trend of HER activity in the M–MoS2 (M = Fe, Co and Ni) catalysts is Co–MoS2 > Ni–MoS2 > FeMoS2 > pristine MoS2.175 This result is in good agreement with the result of DFT calculations.181,182Fig. 11 shows the calculated volcano plots for various M-doped MoS2.181 The Pt-doped MoS2 was on the top of the volcano plot, indicating the highest activity of Pt-MoS2 for the HER. For other transition metals, the Ni-doped MoS2 and Cu-doped MoS2 on the left side of the volcano plot with high adsorption free energy (ΔGoH) have relatively lower activity, because of the overly strong adsorption of the intermediate state (H*) through the unsaturated S atoms neighboring the dopants, whereas almost all M-doped MoS2, such as Fe-doped MoS2, on the right side show low activity owing to their weak binding ability with H atoms. Compared with Ni-, Fe-, and Cu-doped MoS2, Co-doped MoS2 can provide moderate adsorption free energy of H*, demonstrating that Co should be an ideal candidate to tune the HER activity of MoS2. In general, it can be summarized that such ternary Mo-based sulfides (M–Mo–S) enriched and expanded the family of non-noble metal MoS2 electrocatalysts for the HER. Despite the wide exploration of M–Mo–S materials for the HER, the studies on their electrocatalytic properties for the ORR and HER remain limited.

Others
Mixed metal sulfides with other compositions have also been reported, such as Zn–Co–S,104,187 Ag2WS4,188 Co/Ni–W–S,189,190 and ZnIn2S4 (ref. 191 and 192), showing interesting electrochemical performance for electrocatalysis. Recently researchers demonstrated that doping of indium (In) with transition metals could greatly enhance the oxygen catalytic activities,193,194 especially for the ORR. Suib et al. found that In-doped MnOx exhibited better ORR activity than the In-free MnOx catalyst.193 More recently, Co3InC0.75 nanoparticles embedded in carbon reported by Feng et al. also exhibit excellent ORR activity comparable to that of Pt/C in an alkaline medium.194 Inspired by this, our group explored In-based ternary thiospinels as conceivable high-potential air-cathodes for rechargeable Zn–air batteries.195 We found that S-doped rGO supported CoIn2S4 thiospinel (CoIn2S4/S-rGO) could serve as a new and promising electrocatalytic material for effectively catalyzing the ORR and OER. CoIn2S4/S-rGO was prepared by a facile hydrothermal synthesis method involving the typical nucleation and growth stages (Fig. 12a). Compared with In-free Co9S8, CoIn2S4/S-rGO exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic properties for the ORR (half-wave potential of 0.83 V) and OER (overpotential of 0.37 V at 10 mA cm−2). This result indicates that the introduction of In into CoIn2S4/S-rGO may promote reversible oxygen electrode reactions. Such superior experimentally observed electrocatalytic properties induced by In-doping were corroborated via DFT calculations, as shown in Fig. 12b–e. For the OER, the calculated overpotential on CoIn2S4(311) is 1.07 V (Fig. 12b), lower than 2.12 V on Co9S8(311) (Fig. 12c), suggesting the better OER catalytic activity of CoIn2S4(311). In the case of the ORR, the 1st step  starts to be endothermic when the electrode potential U is above 0.75 V for CoIn2S4(311), indicating that the working potential of CoIn2S4(311) is up to 0.75 V (Fig. 12c). This value is close to the theoretical working potential of 0.73 V on Pt/Cu(100) and higher than 0.39 V on Pt/Cu(111).196 With this CoIn2S4/S-rGO air-cathode, we also demonstrated the high-power/energy density (Fig. 12f and g) and excellent cycling stability (Fig. 12h) of a Zn–air cell (150 cycles for 50 h), notably outperforming commercial Pt/C + RuO2 mixture catalysts (35 cycles for 12 h). This work indicated that In-based ternary thiospinels may be a class of promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn–air batteries. Research on In-based ternary thiospinels for Zn–air batteries may bring about new opportunities by further tuning the composition and structure and hybridization with other materials.

Conclusions and outlook
Aimed at exploring effective alternatives to noble-metal catalysts, electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant metal sulfides offer opportunities for realizing efficient and economic electrocatalytic energy conversion. In this review, we have reviewed the recent progress in various ternary metal sulfides (TMSs) for electrocatalytic energy conversion. Considering the importance of electrocatalysis for electrocatalytic energy conversion, some fundamental understanding of electrochemical mechanisms of the HER, OER and ORR was briefly introduced. Following that, we summarized various types of TMSs (Ni–Co–S, Fe–M–S, Cu–M–S, M–Mo–S and others) and discussed their applications in electrocatalysis with focus on the HER, OER and ORR. The results of these TMS-based electrocatalysts for the ORR, OER and ORR are summarized in Table 1. Their potential practical applications were highlighted in some prominent energy-related devices, such as overall water splitting and Zn–air batteries. It is well known that the electrocatalytic performance of catalysts greatly depends on their composition and structure/morphology. Therefore, various design strategies, such as engineering the composition and structure, controlling heteroatom doping, hybridization with conductive materials, etc., were also introduced taking ternary Ni–Co–S sulfides as examples. The extensive achievements have demonstrated the great potential of TMSs in the field of electrocatalysis.

Although great progress has been made in the development of TMSs, several major challenges still exist in both academic research and industrial production. These challenges are as follows:
(i) There is still a lack of in-depth understanding about the fundamental principles of ternary metal sulfides for the OER and ORR. To the best our knowledge, the ORR and OER with TMSs are complex processes, which involve different reaction mechanisms depending on the nature of sulfides (e.g., structures and compositions). Although most of the studies attributed the enhanced electrocatalytic performance to the synergistic effect of two or more metal cations in metal sulfides, the real origin of such an effect has not been confirmed yet. Also, little work was done on the roles of sulfur and their effect on the ORR or OER. S2− may provide an adsorption site for O following O–O bond scission,197 but the detailed mechanisms involved remain unknown. More recently, Shinde et al. indicated that the presence of S results in the formation of crystal defects inside the sulfides.198 Such defects likely act as preferential nucleation sites for the formation of NiO–CoO and Co(OH)2 species upon the OER, which are believed to have promoted the final OER activity of the catalyst. For the HER, Mo-based sulfides present a promising catalyst and the roles of sulfur were better confirmed by theoretical and experimental studies: the sulfur vacancy of MoS2 provides another major catalytically active site for the HER apart from the edge sites. The electronic and structural regulations in TMSs such as Co–Mo–S can engineer Mo–S edges to lower the adsorption free energy (ΔGoH) at the active sites, facilitating the proton adsorption kinetics of the HER. Therefore, we believe that a combination of theoretical and experimental strategies, together with the use of in situ characterization techniques, will further provide in-depth understanding about the fundamental principles of sulfides for the OER and ORR.
(ii) From the thermodynamic viewpoint, metal sulfides are generally unstable at oxidizing potentials, especially under strongly OER oxidative conditions. As a result, metal sulfides are easily oxidized to the corresponding metal oxides or hydroxides in the OER process, which calls into question what the catalytically active species of the OER are. Because electrocatalysis happens on the surface of the catalyst, it is necessary to carry out analysis of surface sensitive characterization after the OER, for understanding what the active species on the surface of metal sulfides are. To our knowledge, there have not been any intensive research studies that are focused on the kinetics and mechanisms of the OER with metal sulfides (or ternary metal sulfides). By understanding the surface-phase changes, future development may lead to more effective sulfide-based electrocatalysts after some optimization between the composition and structure.
(iii) Although TMS electrocatalysts present excellent electrocatalytic properties for the ORR, OER, and HER, the best performance of these materials is still inferior to that of precious Pt/Ir-based electrocatalysts. Therefore, various design strategies, such as engineering the composition and structure, controlling heteroatom doping, and hybridization with conductive materials, are highly expected to further improve the electrochemical performance of TMS-based materials.
(iv) Pure TMSs often reveal unsatisfying electrocatalytic properties because of their low electrical conductivity, easy aggregation and insufficient catalytically active sites, which largely limit their commercial application. To address these challenges, hybridization of TMSs with conductive matrices (e.g., carbonaceous materials and conductive polymers) has been considered as one of the effective strategies. However, carbonaceous materials are electrochemically unstable under the harsh OER conditions with unavoidable carbon corrosion. When the developed materials are used in rechargeable Zn–air batteries, the carbon corrosion would aggravate the aggregation of active metal sulfides and block the active surface due to carbonates derived from CO2 evolution. To ensure good cycle-life of Zn–air batteries, carbon corrosion needs to be minimized. Alternatively, non-carbon supports with high electrical conductivity and stability under strongly OER oxidative conditions should be developed. Nanostructure engineering has proved to be another promising avenue to improve the electrocatalytic performance of TMS materials. Although TMS materials with various morphologies have been synthesized and investigated, the present synthetic methodologies are limited to the laboratory level involving a low-yield or complex synthesis conditions. Therefore, it is vital to realize facile synthesis of well-defined metal sulfides on a large scale as well as at a low cost.
Overall, developing TMSs for electrocatalytic energy conversion is very exciting but still challenging. Given the large family of TMSs available regarding composition and their unique physical/chemical properties, there is still much to explore. With the continuing research efforts, it is believed that TMS materials can be expected to play a shining role in future clean energy conversion technologies.
