    , Accepted 6th February 2019First published on 7th February 2019AbstractNovel rhombic dodecahedral SnS nanocrystals were prepared via a facile one-pot hydrothermal method for the first time, which exhibit a large extinction coefficient of 36.8 L g−1 cm−1 and a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 39.4% under irradiation with a 785 nm laser. Moreover, they show good performance for photothermal therapy of HeLa tumors.
Inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted great attention and have been studied for a wide range of applications such as bioimaging,1 sensing2 and therapeutic agents3 due to their unique physical and chemical properties including optical, electronic, magnetic and catalytic properties. Since their properties are dependent on their compositions, shapes and sizes,4,5 great effort has been made to tune and control the morphology of inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals.6 Preparation of nanosized inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals with highly symmetric polyhedral shapes such as tetrahedron, octahedron, hexahedron and truncated octahedron has become the subject of intense interest over the past few years,7–11 owing to their distinctive properties related to morphology and wide potential applications. Although there have been many reports on the preparation of cubic and octahedral semiconductor crystals,11,12 a high-yield synthesis of uniform rhombic dodecahedral semiconductor nanocrystals especially rhombic dodecahedral SnS nanocrystals (RD SnS NCs) is still a challenge.
Photothermal therapy (PTT) as a novel kind of therapy technology in medical fields is highly efficient for killing cancer cells. An ideal PTT agent should not only show strong absorption of near-infrared (NIR) light and high photothermal conversion efficiency, but also show good biocompatibility and stability.13–16 Until now, many nanomaterials such as noble metal nanostructures,17 carbon nanomaterials,16 organic compounds18 and inorganic semiconductor nanostructures19 have been studied as PTT agents. Inorganic semiconductor nanocrystals receive more emphasis on the PTT of cancer and tumor owing to their low cost, good photostability, high extinction coefficient and low toxicity.20 Tin sulfide (SnS) nanocrystal as a representative inorganic semiconductor nanocrystal is a kind of significant optoelectronic material for photovoltaic devices, NIR detectors, solar cells, lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors due to its narrow band gap and photoelectric characteristics.21 Since SnS nanocrystals exhibit a special NIR absorbance, negligible cytotoxicity and good physiological stability, preparation of morphology-controlled SnS polyhedra for PPT of cancer and tumor is expected.22
Herein, uniform RD SnS NCs with cubic π-phase were prepared in high yield (>95%) via a facile one-pot hydrothermal method for the first time. Interestingly, The RD SnS NCs exhibit strong absorbance in the NIR region, with a large extinction coefficient of 36.8 L g−1 cm−1 at 785 nm, and a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 39.4%. Moreover, the NCs show good performance in in vivo PTT of tumor under irradiation with a 785 nm laser.
The preparation of RD SnS NCs by the hydrothermal method is presented in the Scheme S1 (ESI†). In a typical procedure, 1 mmol of tin(II) chloride dihydrate, 1 mmol of L-cysteine and 0.4 μmol of PVP (Mw = 1300000) were added into 75 mL of distilled water, respectively. The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 h and then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 200 °C for 110 min to produce the RD SnS NCs (see experimental details from ESI†).
The morphology and composition of the prepared RD SnS NCs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The SEM images (Fig. 1a and b) show the uniform and highly dispersed RD SnS NCs with the average size of 245 ± 43 nm (Fig. S1 in ESI†), which were prepared with a reaction time of 110 min. The yield of RD SnS NCs is over 95%. The typical shape of rhombic dodecahedron can be observed in the magnified SEM (Fig. 1b) and TEM (Fig. 1c) images of RD SnS NCs. The EDS analysis (Fig. S2 in ESI†) shows that the element ratio of the prepared RD SnS NCs is about 1:1. The XRD pattern (Fig. S3 in ESI†) can be indexed to the cubic SnS of lattice constant a = 11.6 Å.23 The HRTEM image in Fig. 1d displays the crystal interplanar spacing of 0.338 nm ascribed to the (222) plane of the cubic SnS nanocrystals.24 The EDS elemental mapping in Fig. 1e demonstrates that Sn and S elements are homogeneously distributed in the RD SnS NCs. XPS characterization (Fig. S4 in ESI†) was used to further confirm the formation of RD SnS NCs. The high-resolution XPS Sn 3d spectrum (Fig. S4a in ESI†) shows binding energy at 486.1 eV corresponding to Sn2+ (3d5/2) and at 494.6 eV corresponding to Sn2+ (3d3/2). Binding energy at 161.0 and 162.0 eV as seen in the high-resolution XPS S 2p spectrum (Fig. S4b in ESI†) can be ascribed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively. Note that reaction time is a very sensitive and important factor for controlling the morphology of SnS. RD SnS NCs with the average size of 497 ± 34 nm, referred to as RD SnS NCs-2, are obtained with a reaction time of 120 min (as seen from the size distribution in Fig. S5 in ESI,† SEM, TEM and HRTEM images in Fig. S6 in ESI†). The STEM image and its corresponding EDS elemental mapping (Fig. S6e, ESI†) confirm the composition of RD Sn NCs prepared with a reaction time of 120 min. When the reaction time is 140 min, hexagonal SnS NCs (Fig. S7 in ESI†) with the average size of 1.86 ± 0.45 μm (Fig. S8 in ESI†) are formed. It may be explained that unstable π-phase SnS is prone to be converted to stable α-phase SnS with a long reaction time, which leads to the change in the morphology of SnS from rhombic dodecahedron (π-phase) to hexagon (α-phase) (Fig. S9, ESI†).25,26

(e) STEM image and its corresponding EDS elemental mapping of a RD SnS NC. Note that the above RD SnS NCs were prepared with a reaction time of 110 min. 
Ultraviolet–visible–near infrared (UV–vis–NIR) spectroscopy was performed to measure the optical properties of the RD SnS NCs. The RD SnS NCs exhibit strong absorption in the NIR region. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the RD SnS NCs with the average size of 245 ± 43 nm show the absorption peak at 705 nm, whereas the absorption peak of RD SnS NCs-2 with the average size of 497 ± 34 nm is at 745 nm. The RD SnS NCs were chosen for PTT of cancer and tumor. As seen in the UV–vis–NIR spectrum of RD SnS NCs (Fig. S10 and S11 in ESI†), the RD SnS NCs exhibit a strong absorbance in the NIR region, showing a large extinction coefficient of 36.8 L g−1 cm−1 at 785 nm. The extinction coefficient of RD SnS NCs is greater than that of Au nanorods (3.9 L g−1 cm−1),27 previously reported nanosized graphene oxides (3.6 L g−1 cm−1),28 nanosized reduced graphene oxides (24.6 L g−1 cm−1)29 and many semiconductor nanomaterials such as black phosphorus quantum dots (14.8 L g−1 cm−1),27 MoS2 (29.2 L g−1 cm−1),30 WS2 (14.8 L g−1 cm−1),31 Cu2−xSe (8.5 L g−1 cm−1),32etc.
The photothermal properties of RD SnS NCs were studied by monitoring the temperature change of RD SnS NC aqueous suspensions under irradiation with a 785 nm laser with a power density of 0.8 W cm−2. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the temperature of RD SnS NC aqueous suspensions is evidently higher than that of pure water after irradiation with a 785 nm laser, indicating the excellent photothermal effect of RD SnS NCs. RD SnS NCs with a higher concentration may cause a higher temperature of the suspensions under irradiation with a 785 nm laser due to the photothermal effect. When the concentration of RD SnS NC aqueous suspensions reaches 0.7 mg mL−1, the temperature of RD SnS NCs aqueous suspensions can quickly increase to 70 °C after irradiation with a 785 nm laser for 5 min. RD SnS NCs-2 show poorer photothermal effects than that of RD SnS NCs under irradiation with a 785 nm laser (Fig. S12, ESI†), which can be ascribed to the weaker absorbance of RD SnS NCs-2 at 785 nm than that of RD SnS NCs (Fig. S10, ESI†). From the temperature changes of RD SnS NC aqueous suspensions during laser-on for 10 min and laser-off processes (Fig. 2c), the thermal equilibrium time constant of the RD SnS NCs is calculated to be 135.9 s and their photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was determined to be 39.4% (Fig. 2d) according to previously reported method.33,34 The photothermal conversion efficiency of RD SnS NCs is higher than that of many currently studied PTT agents, such as Cu2−xSe (22.0%),18 Cu9S5 (25.7%),35 black phosphorus quantum dots (28.4%),27 and TixTa1−xSyOz (39.2%).36 To test the reusability, the RD SnS NC aqueous suspensions were subjected to 5 cycles of laser on/off processes. As shown in Fig. 2e, there is no difference in the adjacent peak temperature, indicating the good photostability of RD SnS NCs under long-time repeated laser irradiation.

(e) Heating of RD SnS NC aqueous suspension (0.5 mg mL−1) for five 785 nm laser on/off cycles. The power density of 785 nm laser is 0.8 W cm−2. 
It is well known that good stability and biocompatibility of nanomaterials are critical for their biomedical applications. RD SnS NCs can be stable in water, PBS (pH = 7.4, 10 mM), FBS and 1640 + 10% FBS for more than 24 h (Fig. S13, ESI†). Moreover, experimental results of hemolysis tests demonstrate that RD SnS NCs are also biocompatible (Fig. S14, ESI†). The biological toxicity of RD SnS NCs was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using HeLa and 3T3 cells as models. As shown in Fig. S15a (ESI†), when the concentration of RD SnS NCs is lower than 0.3 mg mL−1, the viability of HeLa and 3T3 cells incubated for 24 h without a 785 nm laser irradiation source is over 87%, indicating the low cytotoxicity of the RD SnS NCs. The PTT effect of RD SnS NCs was measured by incubation of HeLa cells in vitro with RD SnS NCs under irradiation with a 785 nm laser. HeLa cells were incubated with RD SnS NCs (0.3 mg mL−1) overnight and exposed to a 785 nm laser irradiation source for 10 min. It is demonstrated in the Fig. S15b (ESI†) that only the 785 nm laser irradiation source has no significant effect on the cell viability, while the addition of RD SnS NCs (0.3 mg mL−1) caused a sharp decrease of the cell viability of HeLa cells under irradiation with a 785 nm laser. Confocal cell imaging using a Calcein-AM/PI double stain kit was used to further confirm the photothermal effect of RD SnS NCs. Only the dead cells could be stained by PI. As seen in the Fig. S11c (ESI†), RD SnS NCs display a strong killing effect towards HeLa cells under irradiation with a 785 nm laser, suggesting that RD SnS NCs could be a potential PTT agent for cancer therapy.
Inspired by the large extinction coefficient and excellent photothermal effect of RD SnS NCs in vitro, we further explored their applications in PTT of HeLa tumor of mice. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the temperature of the tumor injected with RD SnS NC aqueous suspensions increases rapidly from 30 to 54 °C under irradiation with a 785 nm laser for 6 min. In contrast, the temperature of the tumor injected with PBS solution and irradiated with a 785 nm laser only increases slightly. The photothermal therapeutic effect of RD SnS NCs in vivo was investigated by monitoring the changes in the tumor volume. The length and width of the tumor after treatment were recorded every two days for two weeks. As shown in Fig. 3c, the tumors of mice treated with RD SnS NCs under a 785 nm laser irradiation source were completely ablated. However, the tumors in the other three control groups grew rapidly and the tumor volume displayed an 8–15 fold increase compared to their initial values. The body weight of these mice increased slightly over the course of PTT, indicating no serious side effects in the PTT process (Fig. 3d). In order to further confirm the photothermal therapeutic effect, two mice in each group were sacrificed after one day of various treatments, and the corresponding tumors were then obtained and analyzed histologically using hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E). It can be observed from the representative histopathological images of tumors (Fig. 3e) that the tumor cells treated with RD SnS NCs under a 785 nm laser irradiation source suffered severe destruction, such as more vacuoles, shrunken cells, and condensed nuclei. Nevertheless, there is no obvious abnormality in the other three control groups. These results demonstrate that RD SnS NC is indeed an efficient PTT agent for tumors in medical applications.

P < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. *P and **P are less than 0.05 and 0.01 for student's t-test in (c), respectively. (e) Representative photos of the HeLa tumor bearing mice were recorded after various treatments for 14 d (the upper row). Representative H&E stained images of tumor sliced from mice after various treatments for 1 d (the lower row). 
The biocompatibility of the RD SnS NCs in vivo was also assessed for biomedical applications. After intravenous administration of RD SnS NCs for 1 d or 7 d, the mice were sacrificed, and the major organs were collected and investigated by histological assessments. Meanwhile, blood was taken from the fundus of the eyes of rats to be used for the whole blood assay. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), no obvious organ damage and inflammatory lesion were observed, indicating that RD SnS NCs show no serious side effects. On the other hand, a complete blood count was performed in the healthy Balb/c mice injected with RD SnS NCs for 1 d. It is demonstrated that all measured parameters from the whole blood assay appear to be nearly normal and within normal ranges (Table S1, ESI†). All these results indicate that RD SnS NCs exhibit good biocompatibility in vivo for PTT of tumors.
In summary, novel RD SnS NCs are synthesized via a very facile hydrothermal process for the first time, which show a large extinction coefficient and a superior photothermal effect with a high photothermal conversion efficiency. Moreover, RD SnS NCs also exhibit good performance in vivo photothermal therapy under irradiation with a 785 nm laser. This kind of novel SnS polyhedron, RD SnS NC, is promising as an efficient photothermal agent for cancer therapy.

(e) STEM image and its corresponding EDS elemental mapping of a RD SnS NC. Note that the above RD SnS NCs were prepared with a reaction time of 110 min.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) The photothermal heating curves of pure water and RD SnS NC aqueous suspensions of different concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 mg mL−1) under irradiation with a 785 nm laser. (b) The corresponding photothermal images of pure water and RD SnS NC aqueous suspensions of different concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 mg mL−1) under irradiation with a 785 nm laser for 10 min. (c) Heating of RD SnS NC aqueous suspension (0.5 mg mL−1) under a 785 nm laser irradiation source for 10 min and then cooling in an ambient environment. (d) Thermal equilibrium time constant of heat transfer of RD SnS NC aqueous suspensions under a 785 nm laser irradiation source, determined by fitting the time data from the cooling period versus the linearized energy balance to temperature. (e) Heating of RD SnS NC aqueous suspension (0.5 mg mL−1) for five 785 nm laser on/off cycles. The power density of 785 nm laser is 0.8 W cm−2.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) The near-infrared thermal images of the HeLa cell-bearing mice were recorded under irradiation with a 785 nm laser (1.0 W cm−2) after intratumoral injection of 25 μL of PBS solution and RD SnS NC aqueous suspension (2 mg mL−1) for 2 h. (b) Temperature evolution curves of the tumors in mice after irradiation with a 785 nm laser for 6 min. The changes in (c) relative tumor volumes and (d) body weight of the mice after treatment with PBS, RD SnS NCs, PBS + laser, and RD SnS NCs + laser. P < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. *P and **P are less than 0.05 and 0.01 for student's t-test in (c), respectively. (e) Representative photos of the HeLa tumor bearing mice were recorded after various treatments for 14 d (the upper row). Representative H&E stained images of tumor sliced from mice after various treatments for 1 d (the lower row).
