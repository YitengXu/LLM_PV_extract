Temperature-calibrated Raman spectra of ZnO phonons show that intensity-dependent plasmonic excitation can controllably heat Au–ZnO from 30 to ∼600 °C and simultaneously tune the CH4:CO product ratio. The laser induced heating and resulting CH4:CO product distribution agrees well with predictions from thermodynamic models and temperature-programmed reaction experiments indicating that the reaction is a thermally driven process resulting from the plasmonic heating of the Au–ZnO. The apparent quantum yield for CO2 conversion under continuous wave (cw) 532 nm laser illumination is 0.030%. The Au–ZnO catalysts are robust and remain active after repeated laser exposure and cycling. The light intensity required to initiate CO2 reduction is low (∼2.5 × 105 W m−2) and achievable with solar concentrators. Our results illustrate the viability of plasmonic heating approaches for CO2 utilization and other practical thermal catalytic applications.IntroductionFossil resources are expected to continue as our dominant energy supply, meeting ∼80% of global energy demand until 2030 or longer. As the consumption of fossil fuels is anticipated to increase to keep up with economic growth, there is a pressing need to mitigate the CO2 emissions associated with the use of fossil energy. Catalytic reduction of CO2 to chemicals and fuels is an interesting technical approach for inclusion in a carbon management portfolio because it converts CO2 into a useful product which can be sold to offset the costs associated with carbon capture, sequestration, and long-term monitoring technologies.1–3 Further development of efficient catalysts capable of harnessing carbon-friendly sources of energy to drive the conversion reaction is needed to make this approach viable.Despite decades of research, artificial photocatalytic reduction of CO2 is still not an efficient approach for large-scale applications. In particular, most of the photocatalysts studied are metal oxides with band gaps in the ultraviolet meaning they utilize less than 4–5% of the light reaching the earth's surface. Ideally, a solar-driven catalyst would also use visible and near-infrared photons to increase efficiency by using more of the naturally available sunlight. Another complicating factor is many photocatalysts rely on electron–hole pair generation to drive redox reactions. In general, these photocatalysts generate electron–hole pairs and transfer them to reactants at rates and efficiencies that are too low for larger scale applications. Frequently the energetics of many photo-redox systems require the use of sacrificial hole scavengers to close the redox loop and prevent oxidative corrosion of the catalyst.2,3 While there are still many rich research opportunities for creating new photosensitizers, improving catalytic efficiencies, and developing new hole scavengers, it is prudent to consider other technical approaches in parallel.Recently, the remarkable optical properties of small metal nanoparticles4 have been recognized as a potential solution to improve the efficiency of photovoltaics5–8 and photocatalysis.9–24 The plasmon resonances of metal25,26 and conducting metal oxide27–29 nanoparticles can be tailored to cover the visible spectral range and extend into the near-infrared. The incorporation of various plasmonic nanoparticles has led to enhanced performances for photovoltaic devices and photocatalysts. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed enhancement under visible light excitation, such as charge transfer22,30,31 and electric field enhancement effects.14,32 Metal nanoparticles also generate heat under plasmon resonance conditions.4,33–37 In this regard, plasmonic heating has been exploited to catalyze the oxidation of organics,18 steam reforming reactions and CO oxidation,19 the growth of semiconductor nanowires and carbon nanotubes,20 and chemical vapor deposition of metal oxides.21 Thermally-driven catalytic processes typically have reasonable reaction yields and are easy to engineer into larger scale reactors making them the primary approach employed in industrial settings. As such, it is critical to extend this approach to a wider range of reactions and develop chemical techniques for utilizing this technique with high surface area heterogeneous catalysts.ZnO based catalysts, such as Cu–ZnO, have found extensive industrial applications including methanol synthesis from CO2 and water–gas shift reactions.38,39 To efficiently catalyze these reactions, however, elevated reaction temperatures are required. Here, we report the use of Au–ZnO catalysts to catalytically reduce CO2 under low power visible laser excitation. Plasmonic heating is investigated and verified by using Raman spectroscopy to follow the temperature dependent phonon spectrum of ZnO. Analysis of the excitation intensity dependent catalysis reaction, thermodynamic simulations of reaction products, and temperature-programmed reaction experiments in the dark illustrate that this plasmonic heating is responsible for catalytically converting CO2 and H2 to CH4 and CO on ZnO. By using metal25,26 and conducting metal oxide27–29 nanoparticles with plasmon resonances covering the visible and near-infrared spectral range, this strategy may enable more efficient catalytic conversion of CO2 under concentrated sunlight irradiation. Our results provide both fundamental and practical insight into how this approach could also be used for a variety of other heterogeneous catalysis applications.Experimental sectionMaterialsHydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) hydrate (HAuCl4·xH2O), 99.9%, was purchased from Alfa Aesar. ZnO nanoparticles and SiO2 (99.995+%) were obtained from Meliorum Technologies and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. All chemicals were used as received.Preparation of the Au–ZnO heterostructured catalysts0.5 g ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed in a small amount of methanol to form a paste. The HAuCl4·xH2O was dissolved in ∼5 ml methanol and then slowly added to the ZnO nanoparticle paste under vigorous stirring to form a uniform mixture. The mixture was dried under a N2 flow. The dried powder was subsequently heated to 300 °C in air at 10 °C min−1 and maintained at 300 °C for 1 h before cooling to room temperature. The powder turned a pink–red color after the heat treatment and the resulting Au–ZnO was used for the catalysis experiments without any further processing. The Au content can be adjusted, and all the samples used in the experiments reported here are 5 wt% Au–ZnO. Au–SiO2 was prepared in a similar manner.Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and electron microscopy characterizationThe optical properties of the Au–ZnO, ZnO and Au–SiO2 samples were characterized using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 1050 UV/vis/NIR spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with an FEI Quanta Environmental SEM in low-vacuum mode to minimize charging and using a back-scattered detector at 20 kV to enhance the Au nanoparticle contrast relative to ZnO. Conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEOL 2000EX while high resolution and scanning transmission electron microscopy were performed with a Tecnai F20 FEG, both operating at 200 kV.BET surface area measurementsSurface areas of the catalysts were determined from N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K using a Quantachrome Autosorb 1-C. Multipoint BET measurements were performed at relative pressures (P/P0) in the range of 0.1–0.3. Prior to the measurements, samples were degassed under vacuum at 110 °C for 4 h. The BET surface areas of ZnO (Meliorum) (after calcination at 300 °C for 1 h in air) and 5 wt% Au–ZnO catalyst are 10 and 12 m2 g−1, respectively.Raman spectral studies of the ZnO and Au–ZnO catalystsThe temperature dependent phonon spectrum of ZnO can be used to establish a calibration curve between the laser intensity and steady state surface temperature in our experiments (see ESI, Fig. S2 to S4†). A Renishaw InVia Raman Microscope with 1.0 cm−1 resolution was used to collect the Raman spectra of the ZnO and Au–ZnO catalysts to make steady state temperature estimates (ESI†). The samples were excited using a 532 nm green laser (Crystal 532-100). A 5× magnification microscope objective was used in the experiments. The numerical aperture size was 0.12. The experimental laser spot size was measured using a calibration slide and was determined to be ∼13 μm. A Linkam high temperature stage (THMS 600) and temperature controller (TMS 94) were used to obtain the temperature dependent Raman spectra of plain ZnO in the temperature range of 25 °C to 450 °C with 25 °C steps under constant cw 532 nm laser excitation intensity of 2.6 × 105 W m−2 to establish a relationship between phonon line broadening and shifting with temperature. A series of Raman spectra was also collected for ZnO and Au–ZnO at room temperature and at different laser excitation intensities and compared to the temperature dependent phonon spectra to establish the temperature change occurring during laser illumination and plasmonic heating.Visible light catalytic reduction of CO2 experimentsA gas-tight photocatalysis cell was constructed using a stainless steel spacer (MDC Vacuum Products) with conflat flange components and fitted with two inlet/outlet valves, one gas chromatography (GC) sampling port (HP 5890) connected via Swagelok fittings, and two UV quartz viewports (Fig. S5†). The two UV quartz viewports along the laser irradiation direction ensured that no metal part of the photocatalysis cell would be illuminated by the 532 nm laser. The volume of the photocatalysis cell was 40 ml. A watch glass was placed at the bottom UV quartz viewport of the photocatalysis cell, on which 10 to 15 mg of the catalyst samples were loaded for the catalysis reactions. After a new septum was placed in the sampling port and a catalyst sample was loaded, the photocatalysis cell was purged with 25% CO2:75% H2 mixed gas for 20 minutes. The photocatalysis cell was subsequently irradiated through the top quartz viewport using a continuous wave (cw) 532 nm laser or a 5.5 ns pulsed 532 nm laser. The laser spot size was adjusted from ∼150 μm to ∼1 mm. The illumination time was 5 h for the cw laser and 15 min when the pulsed laser was used. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis of the reduction products was performed using a Perkin Elmer Clarus 600 Gas Chromatograph with a heated sample inlet. Sample detection was achieved using both thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors with a methanizer, joined in sequence. Gas samples were injected manually using a 5 ml gas-tight syringe.Thermodynamic calculations of the equilibrium compositionsCalculations of the equilibrium compositions for the reverse water–gas shift and methanation were performed using HSC Chemistry 7.1. Prior to the calculations, an input data file was created by specifying the species, amounts, temperature range (including number of steps), and equilibrium pressure of the system. For example, the system consisted of 1 mole of CO2, 3 moles of H2, 0 mole of CO, and 0 mole of H2O for the reverse–water gas shift reaction at 25–800 °C (25 °C increment) and 1 bar. The equilibrium compositions were then computed by applying the Gibbs energy minimization method via the GIBBS solver. The percent CO (CH4) selectivity is defined as (moles of CO (CH4) generated/total moles of C-containing products) × 100.Temperature-programmed reactionTemperature-programmed reaction (TPReaction) was performed using a Micromeritics Autochem 2950 HP equipped with a Thermostar mass spectrometer (MS) to verify that CO and CH4 were thermochemically produced using the ZnO and 5% Au–ZnO catalysts. ZnO was dispersed in a pH ∼ 2 HCl solution, dried, and calcined at 300 °C in air for 1 h before cooling to room temperature, so that it was processed in a manner similar to the Au–ZnO during the Au deposition step. Au–SiO2 and SiO2 were also studied as control experiments. The feed gas (25% CO2:75% H2, 100 cm3 (STP) min¬1) was introduced to 300 mg of the samples while the reactor pressure was kept at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst temperature was subsequently raised linearly at the rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 650 °C. Fragments of the gas components in the outlet stream of the reactor (i.e., H2 (m/z = 2), CH4 (m/z = 15), H2O (m/z = 18), CO (m/z = 28), CH3OH (m/z = 31), and CO2 (m/z = 44)) were monitored using a ThermoStar mass spectrometer.Results and discussionElectron microscopy of the Au–ZnO heterostructures shows the synthesis conditions chosen produce ∼20 nm diameter Au particles decorating the ZnO surface at a density of a few particles per μm2 (Fig. 1a). The size of the Au particles is consistent with the diffuse reflectance spectrum of the Au–ZnO powder which shows a characteristic plasmon resonance around 538 nm from the Au nanoparticles (Fig. 1b). The plasmon peak of the Au nanoparticles is conveniently in resonance with the 532 nm lasers utilized for these experiments. In comparison, the pure ZnO powder exhibits no light absorption in the visible range (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1  (a) SEM image of the Au–ZnO catalyst. Au nanoparticles are indicated by the arrows. (b) Diffuse reflectance spectra of pure ZnO (black curve) and Au–ZnO (red curve) nanoparticles. The position of the laser excitation wavelength at 532 nm is indicated by the green line. The phonon peaks for pure ZnO powders are known to shift and broaden with temperature.40,41 Raman spectra of pure ZnO powders collected at known temperatures can therefore be used to establish an experimental calibration curve for quantifying laser-induced plasmonic heating in the Au–ZnO heterostructures (ESI†). The steady state temperature of the Au–ZnO samples as a function of laser intensity determined with this approach is shown in Fig. 2. The temperature change ΔT resulting from plasmonic heating of a spherical particle under power density I0 in the steady state is ΔT = I0Kabsr0/4k∞,33 where Kabs is the efficiency absorption factor for a particle of radius r0 calculated from Mie scattering theory, and k∞ is the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium at the macroscopic equilibrium temperature. Fig. 2 shows the expected linear dependence for laser intensity and steady state temperature indicating that substantial plasmonic heating is occurring. Plasmonic heating is known to be highly localized so we stress that this measurement reflects an average steady state temperature of the ZnO surface. The localized temperature in close proximity to the Au–ZnO interface will likely be significantly higher; a fundamental physical aspect of using plasmonic heating for catalysis that will be difficult to overcome. In much of the reaction data discussed below, there is in fact evidence that localized heating from plasmonic excitation is substantially higher than our steady state measurements or predictions from the equation above. Fig. 2  Au–ZnO sample temperature determined from the Raman spectral broadening of ZnO as a function of cw 532 nm laser intensity. The solid line is a linear fit. The CO2 conversion rates after 5 hours of cw 532 nm laser illumination as a function of laser intensity and steady state temperature are plotted in Fig. 3a. CO and CH4 are the only two reaction products detected in the cell after laser-induced plasmonic heating (Fig. 4). The use of a cw laser allows us to directly match the intensities used in the Raman experiments and thus match these estimated steady state temperatures. The reaction rate of 4.22 μmol g−1 h−1 for the Au–ZnO catalyst under ∼8 × 105 W m−2 cw 532 nm laser illumination is nearly 4 times higher than what we have previously observed using PbS–Cu–TiO2 catalysts under visible light excitation in a similar reaction cell using the same gas detection method.42 The apparent quantum yield (moles of reduction products/moles of photon flux input × 100%) reaches 0.030% in our experiments. We note that although reports can use slightly different definitions for the apparent quantum yield or quantum efficiency,2,3,14 our apparent quantum yield for CO2 conversion is among the highest for metal oxide based photocatalysts under visible light excitation. Fig. 3  Catalytic CO2 conversion rate as a function of laser intensity of (a) Au–ZnO under cw 532 nm illumination, with the corresponding catalyst temperature due to plasmonic heating determined from Raman spectroscopic measurement as the top x-axis; and (b) Au–ZnO under pulsed 532 nm laser excitation.  Fig. 4  (a) CO production rate and (b) CH4 production rate as a function of cw 532 nm laser intensity using Au–ZnO catalysts. CO2 conversion on the Au–ZnO catalysts was also investigated using a higher powered 5.5 ns pulsed 532 nm laser as the excitation source. The pulsed nature of the laser makes it difficult to map our temperature estimates onto this reaction data; however, higher peak temperatures are expected to result from the pulsed laser since it deposits similar amounts of laser energy over shorter time scales. This is illustrated in the data which show that the average laser intensity of the pulsed 532 nm laser is similar to and even slightly lower than the cw 532 nm laser, but the high peak intensity of the 532 nm laser pulse generates CO2 conversion rates that are up to 10 times larger than the highest rate observed using the cw laser (Fig. 3b). This presumably occurs because these peak intensities produce much higher localized heating from plasmonic excitation, which more effectively drives the catalytic conversion reaction.The ability to selectively heat the substrate to different steady state temperatures by controlling laser intensity also allows us to control the product distribution of the reaction and gain insight into the reaction pathway. The thermodynamic equilibrium products for 4 different reaction schemes were simulated and compared to our experimental results (ESI†). The simulated products most consistent with experiments involve the coupling of a reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) and CO methanation reaction, yielding CO and CH4 products:CO2 + H2 ⇆ CO + H2O (RWGS)CO + 3H2 ⇆ CH4 + H2O (CO methanation)The simulated selectivities from thermodynamic calculations are shown in Fig. 5a and compared to experimentally determined values from our reactions in Fig. 5b. Qualitatively, the experimental trends for CO and CH4 follow the thermodynamically predicted reaction products, although the observed selectivity cross-over occurs at significantly lower temperatures in the experiments, presumably a result of highly-localized heating occurring above the steady state temperature in proximity to the Au particles. For the pulsed laser, we only see CO as a product with CH4 levels being at the detection limit of our system; this is consistent with the higher temperatures and localized heating expected for the pulsed laser system, as well as the predicted selectivity from the thermodynamic calculations. Fig. 5  Selectivity of CO and CH4. (a) Results of the calculations of the equilibrium composition for reverse water–gas shift and methanation. (b) Experimental CO (blue squares) and CH4 (red circles) selectivity as a function of cw 532 nm laser intensity and the corresponding catalyst temperature using Au–ZnO catalysts. The thermal catalytic activity of the pure ZnO and Au–ZnO samples was further evaluated using temperature-programmed reaction studies conducted in the dark (Fig. 6). These reactions indicate that both samples have similar thermal catalytic activity producing both CO and CH4, as is illustrated in Fig. 5. Additionally, the temperature-programmed reactions for ZnO and Au–ZnO also show that CH4 is produced at lower temperatures followed by a decrease in the CH4 generation at higher temperatures, whereas CO production increases continuously as the temperature rises (Fig. 6), qualitatively identical to the plasmonic heating results demonstrated in Fig. 4. The similarity between the temperature-programmed reaction results shows that ZnO, alone, has catalytic activity for producing CH4 and CO in dark reactions suggesting it plays a significant role in catalytic activity, and the reactions driven by plasmonic heating cannot be solely explained by reactions occurring on the Au particles. The differing temperature profiles between the dark-thermal and the laser-based experiments presumably result from highly localized plasmonic heating leading to an underestimate of the steady state temperature under 532 nm illumination. Collectively, these results indicate that plasmonic heating can drive a purely thermal catalytic reaction. Furthermore they point out that varying laser intensities can be used to tune product distributions, adding a degree of depth to our ability to engineer catalytic reaction systems. Fig. 6  (a) CO and (b) CH4 production detected by a mass spectrometer as a function of temperature for the ZnO, Au–ZnO and Au–SiO2 samples. These are standard temperature-programmed reaction methods and the samples are encased in a stainless steel reactor tube (i.e. in the dark) during the analysis. MS signal, mass spectrometer signal; a.u., arbitrary units. To evaluate the catalyst’s stability, 5 consecutive catalytic cycles were run on the same sample. Unlike previous reports on sensitized TiO2 catalysts where stability can be an issue,42,43 the activity of the Au–ZnO catalysts is robust. The catalysts remain active after repeated cw 532 nm laser exposure cycles (total light exposure time is 25 hours) and the CO2 conversion rate varies <15% in a non-systematic fashion for the 5 cycles (Fig. 7). This stability is attributed to the CO2 conversion reaction being driven by a thermally-mediated process instead of a photo-redox mechanism. This key distinction prevents oxidative corrosion of the catalyst and the depletion of hole scavengers which impact the long-term performance of photo-redox systems. The stability with cycling also illustrates that laser-induced damage is not occurring under low-intensity cw laser excitation. Fig. 7  Total CO2 conversion rate for Au–ZnO catalysts after repeated 5 h exposure to cw 532 nm illumination. The laser intensity is 8 × 105 W m−2. At the end of each 5 h laser irradiation cycle, the photocatalysis cell was purged with fresh 25% CO2:75% H2 for the next round of the catalysis experiment. As control experiments, pure ZnO and Au–SiO2 were tested under both cw and pulsed 532 nm laser irradiation. Pure ZnO was inactive under either cw or pulsed 532 nm illumination. Our Raman studies also indicate that the cw 532 nm laser causes no appreciable heating of the ZnO (Fig. S4, ESI†). This result eliminates the direct laser heating of pure ZnO as a contributing process for the CO2 conversion results. Additionally, Au–SiO2 shows nearly negligible activity compared to Au–ZnO under identical conditions. This observation rules out highly-dispersed, nanoparticulate Au alone as a main contributing factor to our CO2 conversion results, and further demonstrates that ZnO plays an indispensable role in the observed catalytic activity of Au–ZnO under light illumination. This result is also consistent with the very small catalytic activity observed when Au–SiO2 is heated in the dark (Fig. 6), which is most likely associated with the catalytic activity of Au.44,45It is interesting to compare our results with other plasmonic catalyst reports in the literature. Previous works have attributed the catalytic plasmonic enhancement as occurring from charge transfer processes,22,30,31,46,47 heating effects,18–20 field enhancement,15,17,32 and direct optical excitation of sub-gap defects due to an enhanced optical field from the plasmon.14 We point out that varying particle size distributions, available reaction channels, particle densities, excitation intensity and its resonance with the plasmon frequency, the catalytic activity of specific materials, as well as other material and experimental parameters, will dictate which mechanism(s) drives the catalytic reaction. In our work, the case for a thermally-driven reaction is compelling and other effects are not applicable and/or only play a minor, secondary role at best. First, our temperature calibrated Raman studies with Au–ZnO show, experimentally, that high steady state heating is occurring. Second, unlike Au–TiO2 which is completely inactive when heated to 400 °C in the dark,14 both pure ZnO and Au–ZnO have demonstrated strong thermal catalytic activity in dark reactions with identical products and similar product selectivity to the experiments we associate with plasmonic heating. Third, thermodynamic simulations of CO and CH4 selectivity with temperature agree with experimentally-determined values under light illumination of different excitation intensities. Fourth, the field enhancement effect is not applicable here because in contrast to TiO2, which has been reported to be catalytically active under 532 nm irradiation,14 pure ZnO is not active under even the highest intensity pulsed 532 nm laser excitation (over 5 × 1012 W m−2). The fact that pure ZnO is unable to utilize 532 nm photons eliminates the possibility of the field enhancement effect in our particular system. Fifth, the direct charge transfer from Au nanoparticles to reactant molecules46 can be ruled out as the dominant mechanism because Au–SiO2 exhibits only insignificant activity under light illumination. Finally, charge injection from Au into ZnO nanoparticles47 is not expected to be the predominant mechanism because under this mechanism it would be very difficult to explain the observed agreement between the light intensity dependent product selectivity using Au–ZnO under 532 nm laser illumination and the temperature dependent selectivity in dark thermal reactions using both pure ZnO and Au–ZnO. As such, we conclude that plasmonic heating is the dominate factor in this case.In further comparing our results to other literature on plasmonic heating, we note we are achieving very high temperatures at relatively low laser intensities (∼105 W m−2). Similarly, Au nanoparticles on oxide supports are heated to 100 °C under ∼103 W m−2 visible light irradiation,18 and Au nanorods with a longitudinal plasmon resonance at 792 nm can be rapidly heated to > 100 °C under 809 nm laser excitation at intensities of ∼104 W m−2,4,48 which are ∼10 to 100 times lower than those used in our experiments. Many other literature studies typically associate plasmonic heating with significantly higher intensities.14,19,20,49,50 Because theory predicts that the temperature increase at the surface of the plasmonic nanoparticle is directly proportional to the absorption cross-section at the excitation wavelength, we point out that plasmonic heating should be dependent upon the size and shape of the nanoparticle as well as the refractive index of the surrounding matrix phase.33–37 Hence, one reason for the efficient laser heating in our Au–ZnO sample is that the Au plasmon resonance frequency is at ∼538 nm; almost exactly the same energy as the 532 nm laser excitation wavelength used to initiate heating in our work. For systems with a comparable loading of Au nanoparticles in which the plasmon resonance peak lies at ∼560–570 nm, higher laser intensities at 532 nm seem to be required to drive heating.14,19 In this regard, our experiments help illustrate the role of resonance matching for efficient plasmonic heating. Moreover, as plasmonic heating is influenced by a variety of parameters, optimizing materials and structural properties of these types of catalysts can further improve the efficiency of plasmonic heating assisted photocatalysis.ConclusionsThe plasmon enhanced photocatalytic reduction of CO2 reported here is potentially exciting for large scale practical applications. Au–ZnO catalysts are substantially heated to temperatures up to ∼600 °C under visible 532 nm laser illumination because of plasmon resonance excitation. The plasmonic heating effect enables the thermally driven CO2 reduction to proceed efficiently at room temperature under visible light illumination, and the product selectivity can be readily controlled by adjusting the light intensity. The light intensity necessary to initiate substantial CO2 reduction is rather low and can be readily achieved by solar concentrators. The Au–ZnO catalyst is very robust and can possibly sustain long-term catalytic reduction of CO2. Finally, by incorporating metal or conducting metal oxide nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes, carefully controlling the density of the plasmonic nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, and selecting materials that can more efficiently generate heat, such as Ag, the conversion efficiency of natural sunlight into heat to drive CO2 reduction reaction may be vastly improved.AcknowledgementsThis technical effort was performed in support of the National Energy Technology Laboratory's ongoing research into CO2 capture under the RES contract DE-FE0004000.

 	Fig. 1  (a) SEM image of the Au–ZnO catalyst. Au nanoparticles are indicated by the arrows. (b) Diffuse reflectance spectra of pure ZnO (black curve) and Au–ZnO (red curve) nanoparticles. The position of the laser excitation wavelength at 532 nm is indicated by the green line.	 

 	Fig. 2  Au–ZnO sample temperature determined from the Raman spectral broadening of ZnO as a function of cw 532 nm laser intensity. The solid line is a linear fit.	 

 	Fig. 3  Catalytic CO2 conversion rate as a function of laser intensity of (a) Au–ZnO under cw 532 nm illumination, with the corresponding catalyst temperature due to plasmonic heating determined from Raman spectroscopic measurement as the top x-axis; and (b) Au–ZnO under pulsed 532 nm laser excitation.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) CO production rate and (b) CH4 production rate as a function of cw 532 nm laser intensity using Au–ZnO catalysts.	 
CO2 + H2 ⇆ CO + H2O (RWGS)
CO + 3H2 ⇆ CH4 + H2O (CO methanation)

 	Fig. 5  Selectivity of CO and CH4. (a) Results of the calculations of the equilibrium composition for reverse water–gas shift and methanation. (b) Experimental CO (blue squares) and CH4 (red circles) selectivity as a function of cw 532 nm laser intensity and the corresponding catalyst temperature using Au–ZnO catalysts.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) CO and (b) CH4 production detected by a mass spectrometer as a function of temperature for the ZnO, Au–ZnO and Au–SiO2 samples. These are standard temperature-programmed reaction methods and the samples are encased in a stainless steel reactor tube (i.e. in the dark) during the analysis. MS signal, mass spectrometer signal; a.u., arbitrary units.	 

 	Fig. 7  Total CO2 conversion rate for Au–ZnO catalysts after repeated 5 h exposure to cw 532 nm illumination. The laser intensity is 8 × 105 W m−2. At the end of each 5 h laser irradiation cycle, the photocatalysis cell was purged with fresh 25% CO2:75% H2 for the next round of the catalysis experiment.
