E-mail: tpal@chem.iitkgp.ernet.in;  Fax: +91-03222-255303Received 1st August 2013, Accepted 3rd September 2013First published on 4th September 2013AbstractBenzoin, a common reagent, has been used as a reducing agent for large scale production of reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and also for a gold-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (Au–rGO) by a co-reduction method. The pH of the reaction medium plays a crucial role in controlling the reaction kinetics. Systematic microscopic characterization reveals the sheet like nanostructure of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). A two-electron transfer mechanism has been proposed to support the reduction phenomenon. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been successfully exploited for the removal of different dye molecules from aqueous solution and the recyclability has been tested. Here the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is calculated to be 338.65 mg g−1 for methylene blue. Finally peroxidase like activity of Au–rGO has been identified for pyrogallol oxidation using tert-butyl hydroperoxide.IntroductionGraphene, an allotrope of elemental carbon, has been considered as a novel material in recent times by scientific researchers ever since its discovery in 2004 (ref. 1) due to its ultrahigh surface area to mass ratio2 as well as remarkable electrical conductivity,3 high thermal conductivity,4 and unique mechanical properties.5 This is a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice having single-atom thick monolayer of hexagonally arranged sp2 hybridized carbon network. This unique nanomaterial and its different derivatives for example graphene–semiconductor nanocomposites, graphene–noble metal nanocomposites, graphene–polyaniline, graphene oxide based functionalized hydrogel etc. have potential applications in nanoelectronics,6 sensors,7 energy-storage capacitors,8,9 solar cells,10 catalysis11–13 and also in antimicrobial study.14 So the large scale synthesis of high quality graphene is of preferred interest in this decade. Various strategies have been outlined in literature to fabricate graphene such as chemical vapour deposition (CVD),15 micromechanical16 and ultrasonication-assisted exfoliations of graphite,17 unzipping of carbon nanotubes18 and chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO).19 Among these synthetic strategies solution based GO reduction is well-suited for mass production due to its simplicity and low material cost.20This promising route first consists of chemical oxidation of graphite using strong acid (like conc. H2SO4) and oxidants (like KMnO4, NaNO3, K2S2O8etc.) followed by ultrasonic exfoliation and finally reduction of the exfoliated graphene oxide precursor employing a variety of protocols such as irradiation,21,22 thermal annealing,23 electrochemical or chemical reduction24,25 leads to the formation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Oxidation of graphite and the subsequent exfoliation introduces certain defects and oxygen-containing functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxylic and epoxide in the skeleton of GO which makes the materials soluble in water. So the reduction with chemical agent is crucial to remove the above mentioned functional groups to re-establish the sp2 hybridized conjugated carbon lattice together with improved electronic properties of reduced GO i.e., rGO.26 Generally chemical reduction of graphene oxide has been achieved using hydrazine and its derivatives,27 atomic hydrogen28 hydroquinone,29 sodium borohydride,30 substituted borohydride,31 ascorbic acid,20,32 bio-molecules,33 ethylenediamine,34 carbon monoxide,35 metal powder,36 hydroxylamine,37 sulphur-containing compounds,38 lithium aluminium hydride,39 thiourea,40 or even KOH.41 Alcohol can also reduce GO effectively but slowly.42 Though in most cases the reduction occurs efficiently but they are limited in terms of longer reaction time and high energy consumption. Sometimes the toxicity of the reducing agents also renders the process less acceptable although some green reduction pathways of GO have been reported.20,32,33,43,44 Thus, commercially affordable safer reducing agents are of high demand for the reduction of GO.Tollens' reagent is commonly used to chemically differentiate ketone and aldehyde where the latter reduces this reagent selectively. Interestingly, α-hydroxy ketones are the only exception in ketone to give positive Tollens' test. Benzoin, being an α-hydroxy ketone is known to be oxidized to benzil. This idea prompted us to test a new facile synthetic route for the chemical reduction of GO by benzoin at 85 °C. This reaction almost becomes instantaneous in alkaline medium. This method represents rGO synthesis with bulk quantity at low production cost. The extent of reduction and the quality of the synthesized rGO have been investigated by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and other spectroscopic measurements.Different water soluble organic dye molecules are used in the industries and discharged into the water bodies. Due to their toxicity and low bio-compatibility, adsorption45 or degradation11,12 of these pollutants is very important. High surface area of graphene and its derivatives make them powerful adsorbent for abatement of water pollutants.45–47 In that context recycling of both the adsorbate and adsorbent make the process effective. Herein, we report the dye adsorption study using our as-synthesized rGO and desorption of dye molecule for dye speciation. The regenerated rGO material shows excellent dye adsorption capability for several cycles.Peroxidase is an enzyme which often used to catalyse the oxidation of water pollutants in presence of peroxides. But due to the limitation in terms of its cost and applicability at some particular conditions, design of an alternative material with similar activity has become very important. On that note Fe3O4 NPs,48 GO,49 graphene,50 noble metals51etc. found to exhibit peroxidise-like activity with various substrates. Combination of noble metal nanoparticles and rGO may show excellent catalytic activity due to their high conductivity and this idea creates the option to synthesize Au–rGO hybrid materials for pyrogallol oxidation with tert-butyl hydroperoxide.Experimental sectionMaterialsAll the reagents used were of AR grade and used as received without further purification. Graphite powder, benzoin, gold chloride (HAuCl4), and pyrogallol were purchased from Aldrich. Potassium permanganate, sodium nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, ethanol, ethyl acetate, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, potassium hydrogen phosphate, and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were purchased from Merck, India. Methylene blue (MB), crystal violet (CV), congo red (CR), eosin Y (EY), methyl orange (MO) and neutral red (NR) were purchased from SRL, India. All glassware were cleaned using aqua-regia, subsequently rinsed with a copious amount of double distilled water and dried well prior to use. Double distilled water was used throughout the course of the investigation.Reduction of graphene oxide (GO) by benzoinGraphene oxide (GO) was chemically synthesized following Hummers method.52 The reduction of the as-synthesized GO using benzoin was performed in water–ethanol mixture at ∼85 °C on a water bath. In a typical experiment, 25 mg of the as-synthesized GO was added in 30 mL water and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (Oscar Ultrasonic) for ∼1 h to make a complete dispersion. The resulted homogeneous suspension of brown graphene oxide was kept over water bath. Then 0.5 mmol benzoin dissolved in 30 mL hot ethanol was added to the above suspension followed by an aqueous solution of NaOH (0.1 mL; 1 M) was added into the reaction mixture to raise the pH of the solution to ∼10. The process took ∼1 h for completion. The brown suspension gradually turned clear with the appearance of suspended black particles which was filtered in hot condition in vacuum and the black residue was washed several times with hot ethanol and then with ethyl acetate to remove the excess benzoin from rGO. Finally the product was dried in air and used for further characterizations.Synthesis of gold-reduced graphene oxide (Au–rGO) nanocomposite and study of its peroxidase-like activityGold nanoparticles deposited reduced graphene oxide (Au–rGO) was synthesized by co-reduction process where benzoin was used as a reducing agent. First aqueous HAuCl4 solution (3 mL; 10−2 M) was stirred with GO dispersion for 1 h and then the whole mixture was heated with benzoin (in hot ethanol) in water bath for 1 h in basic condition. Here all the other parameters e.g. amount of benzoin, GO etc. were kept constant.Catalytic activity of Au–rGO was studied for pyrogallol (PG) oxidation by t-BuOOH at pH = 7. First, 25 μL of 0.1 M PG was added to 3 mL phosphate buffer solution in presence of 100 μL of t-BuOOH at room temperature (∼30 °C). Then 0.1 mg catalyst was added to it and the absorption spectra was recorded at the interval of 5 minutes. Same procedure was also followed with H2O2 instead of t-BuOOH.CharacterizationsXRD was recorded on a Philips PW-1710 X-ray diffractometer (40 kV, 20 mA) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2θ range of 5–50° at a scanning rate of 0.5° min−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses of the samples were carried out on a Hitachi H-9000 NAR transmission electron microscope, operating at 100 kV. Samples were prepared by sonicating the powders with alcohol and then placing a drop of solution on a carbon-coated copper grid followed by solvent evaporation in a vacuum. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with a VG Scientific ESCALAB MK II spectrometer (UK) equipped with a Mg Kα excitation source (1253.6 eV) and a five-channeltron detection system to analyze the elemental state for a pellet sample. The passed energy of wide and narrow XPS was 50 eV and 10 eV respectively. Background subtraction was performed by ‘SPECSURF’ software and curve fitting had been done by choosing the ratio of Gaussian to Lorentzian. Raman spectra were obtained with a Renishaw Raman Microscope, equipped with a He–Ne laser excitation source emitting at a wavelength of 632.8 nm, and a Peltier cooled (−70 °C) charge coupled device (CCD) camera. A Leica microscope with 50X objective lens was used. The holographic grating with 1800 grooves per mm and the 1 cm−1 slit enabled the spectral resolution. Laser power at the sample was 4.5 mW and the data acquisition time was 30 s. The absorption spectra were recorded using UV-visible recording spectrophotometer (UV-160, Shimadzu). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies were performed with a Thermo-Nicolet continuum FTIR microscope. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of GO and rGO were done in Perkin Elmer Pyris Diamond TG-DTA instrument under N2 flow at 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range of 50–600 °C. Reflectance spectra were measured using DRS (Diffuse Reflectance Spectra) mode with a Cary model 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer.Results and discussionsSeveral methodologies have been followed for large scale production of reduced graphene oxide. However, solution based soft chemistry approach is favoured in terms of its simplicity and low material cost. Commercially affordable source for graphene synthesis is graphite flakes. But the hydrophobic nature makes the graphite flakes insoluble in water. This solubility problem has been mostly overcome with the introduction of oxygen functionalities in graphite lattice through their oxidation though there are also other reports with new functionalities.53 Then the water dispersible functionalized graphite i.e. GO is reduced by benzoin, an easily available laboratory chemical.The as-synthesized brown aqueous suspension of GO turned black when treated with an alcoholic solution of benzoin under alkaline pH environment and with the progress of the reduction process, a black product slowly settled down at the bottom. It was filtered and washed with proper care. The filtrate was yellow in colour and was identified to be benzil from thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis. Benzil is formed due to the oxidation of benzoin in solution. Fig. 1 presents the photographs of GO suspension, rGO and the filtrate obtained after reduction. The as-synthesized dry rGO was examined by various spectroscopic techniques. Fig. 1  Digital images of aqueous suspension of graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and filtrate (benzil) obtained after reduction. The progress of the above reduction reaction was monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 2. The brown aqueous solution of GO exhibits two absorption maxima; a broad maxima at 234 nm results from the characteristic of π–π* transition and the other appears as a shoulder at 289 nm and is due to n–π* transition. Within few minutes the intensity of these peaks gradually faded away with the onset of evolution of one new absorption peak at ∼255 nm. The red shift in π–π* transition from ∼234 nm to ∼255 nm observed during the GO to rGO conversion can be explained by the restoration of extended conjugation in the reduced materials33 which thereby energetically facilitates the above transition. Finally, this peak shifts to 260 nm after 1 h of reduction. Fig. 2  Time dependent UV-vis spectra for GO reduction. FTIR spectrum of GO (orange line; panel a) and rGO (black line; panel b) have been presented in Fig. 3. The presence of O–H stretching mode appear as a broad peak at 3423 cm−1, CO stretching mode at 1719 cm−1, O–H bending mode at 1393 cm−1, C–O (epoxy) stretching mode at 1218 cm−1 and the C–O (alkoxy) stretching mode at 1072 cm−1 clearly demonstrates the functionalized surface of GO.37 The peak at 1635 cm−1 presumably resulted in from the unoxidized graphitic domains or adsorbed water.54 The intensities of the all FTIR peaks correlated to the oxygen containing groups decreased dramatically and some of them are vanished completely for rGO as shown in part (b) of Fig. 3. One new peak at 1544 cm−1 results in due to skeletal CC vibration of graphene sheets in rGO55 which once again substantiates the ease of the reduction methodology. Fig. 3  FTIR spectra of (a) GO and (b) rGO. The interlayer distance (d-spacing) is a key hints to follow the extent of GO reduction. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of graphite powder (Fig. 4a) shows a very sharp peak at 2θ = 26.49° which corresponds to d-spacing of 3.36 Å for (002) plane whereas the diffraction peak at about 2θ = 10.02° for GO (Fig. 4b) shows interlayer distance of 8.82 Å which is much larger compared to graphite. On extreme oxidation by Hummers method the edges of the basal planes of graphite become functionalized with hydroxyl, carbonyl, alkoxy, epoxy groups which leads to larger d-spacing.56 Reduction of GO to rGO can be evidenced from the XRD pattern where the peak around 2θ = 10.02° disappears and a new broad diffraction peak (002) appears at about 2θ = 25.96° as shown in Fig. 4c. Upon reduction, the interlayer spacing becomes 3.43 Å which supports the efficient removal of oxygenated functional groups from GO sheets. The d-spacing value of rGO (3.43 Å) is very close to graphite powder (3.36 Å), but still little bit higher and this is due to the agglomeration of the rGO sheets through π–π stacking.57 The broad (002) peak for rGO arises due to the presence of free nanosheets which are poorly ordered along the stacking direction.55 Another peak around 43° arises due to (100) plane.58 No extra peaks from other impurities authenticate the high purity of the synthesized product. Fig. 4  XRD patterns of (a) graphite powder (b) GO and (c) rGO; inset presents the XRD pattern of rGO only. Raman spectroscopy is the finest technique to characterize the structural changes during GO reduction. It is frequently used to detect structural defect and disorder in graphene structure.57Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra of the samples where we observe two characteristic peaks in the 1100 to 1800 cm−1 wavenumber window. The strong G mode comes from the first order scattering of the E2g phonons by sp2-bonded carbon atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice whereas the D mode arises from the breathing mode of k-point photons of A1g symmetry.59 GO shows two peaks at 1346 cm−1 and 1588 cm−1, whereas for rGO they shift to 1330 cm−1 and 1594 cm−1 respectively. The intense D band for GO at around 1346 cm−1 is due to the increased lattice disorder in the sp2 domains due to extensive oxidation and exfoliation.27 The ratio of the D-band intensity (ID) to the G-band intensity (IG) can be rationalized to evaluate the density of the small graphene sheets58 and also its stacking behavior.25 Increase in ID/IG value indicates the presence of lower number of average size sp2 carbon domain in the graphitic material. Here this value increases from 0.94 to 1.19 which implies the formation of smaller in-plane sp2 carbon domain during reduction.37 Fig. 5  Raman spectra of (a) GO and (b) rGO. The extent of GO reduction with benzoin was further examined by X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) which is an exceptionally sensitive analytical tool to identify the functionalized surface of graphitic material and also their compositions. Fig. 6 shows the C 1s core level XPS spectra of GO and rGO. GO shows three deconvoluted intense peaks at about 285 eV (graphitic sp2 and sp3 carbon; fwhm: 1.21 eV), 286.6 eV (epoxy and alkoxy carbon; fwhm: 2.04 eV) and a broad contribution at 288.2 eV (fwhm: 5.38 eV) which is due to the presence of CO and O–CO groups.60 Respective peak area of the various functional groups are compared in the inset of C 1s XPS spectra of GO which indicates the oxygenated carbon moieties as the major groups present in GO. Upon reduction, the predominant peak for rGO appears at around 284.92 eV (fwhm: 2.66 eV) rather than any oxygen functionalities groups as it was present in GO. This confirms that the graphitic moiety has been restored during reduction. The other peaks associated with oxygen functionalities such as epoxy, alkoxy, carbonyl, carboxyl etc. decrease in intensities (fwhm = 1.92 eV and 2.71 eV for C–O and CO groups, respectively) as described in the insets of Fig. 6. This change in peak intensities and also their slight peak shifting suggest the efficient removal of oxygen functionalities from GO with the successive reduction by benzoin within 1 h.60 Here it is worth noting that the calculated C/O ratio changes from 1.8 to 6.52 during GO reduction (comparative wide scan spectra in Fig. S1†). Fig. 6  C 1s XPS spectra of GO and rGO. In the TGA curve (Fig. 7) of GO shows about 19% mass loss in the first step which corresponds to the release of adsorbed water molecules and moisture below 180 °C. The major weight loss (∼27%) comes after 200 °C which can be recognized as the decomposition of labile oxygen functionalities present in GO and then again it shows a mass loss in the 3rd step due to the removal of remaining functional groups and burning of ring carbon on heating above 450 °C to 600 °C.43 As a whole total weight loss is calculated to be ∼60% on heating up to 600 °C. Here it is worth mentioning that the thermal stability of rGO has been highly enhanced due to the removal of oxygen functionalities during reduction and total mass loss is found to be only 22% of the initial mass upon heating to 600 °C. Fig. 7  TGA curves of GO and rGO. Detailed morphology and the crystallinity of the synthesized rGO have been compared with GO from TEM and SEAD analysis. Fig. 8a presents the panoramic view of the TEM image of GO showing the wavy morphology with random aggregation of the nanosheets together with SAED pattern (inset in Fig. 8a). The diffraction rings with unresolved dots illustrate the amorphous and disordered arrangements of the GO nanosheets. Here it is worth noting that TEM image of rGO in Fig. 8b depicts the presence of transparent and partially folded nanosheets confirming the flexible nature of the sheets29,40 as indicated by red arrow. Layered morphology of rGO is indicated in Fig. 8c. The aggregated nature of GO however is absent in this case. The well-defined diffraction spots having hexagonal symmetry in SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 8c) illustrate the crystalline nature of rGO. So, the above analyses clearly confirm that benzoin effectively reduces amorphous and stacked graphene oxide nanosheets for the production of highly crystalline reduced graphene oxide nanosheets. Fig. 8  TEM images and SAED patterns (inset) of (a) GO and (b and c) rGO. Effect of pHHere it is worth mentioning that pH of the reaction environment plays a major role in controlling the reaction kinetics. The same synthetic strategy for GO reduction as described in the Experimental section was again considered but individually in neutral and acidic medium. The FTIR spectra in Fig. 9 present the spectral profile of synthesized rGO in varied pH condition. The figure suggests the presence of different oxygen functionalities (as indicated by the shaded area) in the rGO matrix synthesized in acidic and neutral medium after 1 h reduction, though this time domain was observed to be adequate for the effective completion of the reduction of GO in alkaline pH. Comparatively the requisite time for reduction in neutral medium was much longer (∼15 h) and in acidic medium it was even higher. Like β-cyclodextrin61 or ascorbic acid,62 the effective reducing power rises in alkaline condition through fast deprotonation of the alcoholic group of benzoin. This simply justify the slow reduction of GO in neutral condition and in acidic medium. Fig. 9  FTIR spectra of reduction product of GO at various pH condition after 1 h of reduction; inset shows the corresponding digital images. Mechanism of benzoin mediated GO reductionAmong the ketone molecules α-hydroxy ketones are the only active member of the family capable of giving positive Tollens' test. In a basic medium benzoin is first converted to benzoin enediol dianion (1) which act as a reducing agent through electron transfer. Benzoin has a general tendency in basic condition to form benzil anion radical (2) by electron transfer from the enediol dianion (1) as reported previously.63 The mechanism proceeds through single electron transfer process as shown in Scheme 1. Here benzoin makes the efficient reduction of GO in alkaline medium and in turn oxidized to benzil. This chemical oxidation thus in fact involves an overall exchange of two electrons from each molecule of benzoin to the acceptor, GO. These transferred electrons are finally responsible for the chemical reduction of graphene oxide. Although the reduction process of GO is not fully understandable but the removal of oxygen functionalities was confirmed from the experimental results discussed already in the preceding section. Scheme 1  Proposed mechanism of benzoin induced reduction of graphene oxide {GO = 25 mg; benzoin = 0.5 mmol; pH = 10}. Dye removalIn order to investigate the dye adsorption efficiency of our as-synthesized rGO material we have chosen methylene blue as model dye molecule in aqueous solution. Definite amount of rGO was added in MB solution (300 mL; 5 × 10−5 M) and upon stirring the solution starts fading (see ESI† for experimental details). Fig. S3a† presents the UV-visible spectra recorded during MB adsorption kinetics. Within 15 minutes solution becomes almost colourless. At equilibrium the adsorption capacity can be calculated from the following equation:64Q = (C0 − Cfinal) × MMB × V/WSwhere Q is the adsorption capacity in (mg g−1), C0 and Cfinal are the concentration of MB in mol L−1 at initial and final conditions respectively, MMB is the molecular weight of MB, V denotes the volume of aqueous MB solution in L and WS is the weight of rGO sample in g. To find out the final concentration of MB, UV-visible spectra are recorded for some MB solutions of known concentration. Fig. S2a† presents the respective absorbance spectra whereas Fig. S2b† shows the plot of absorbance vs. concentration and the straight line matches with A = kC equation following the Lambert–Beer law. The final concentration stands to be 5.9 × 10−7 M and the adsorption capacity at saturated condition is calculated to be 338.65 mg g−1. It is very important to reuse the adsorbent (here rGO) to make the process cost-effective. After first cycle, the ‘MB-adsorbed rGO’ material is subjected to alcoholic desorption treatment to regenerate the pristine rGO. Extracted MB is collected aside and the washed adsorbent is again recycled for further dye removal. In this way we observed that the regenerated rGO performed well for the 2nd and even for 3rd cycles as indicated in Fig. S3b and c† respectively. However the efficiency of the material gradually reduced due to the possible retention of MB in the active sites of the adsorbent which results in aggregation of the rGO nanosheets after repetitive utility as indicated in Fig. S4a.† EDX analysis (Fig. S4b†) shows the presence of nitrogen and sulphur in rGO after MB desorption which confirms the occupancy of MB in the aggregated rGO nanosheets. Fig. 10 presents comparative study of dye adsorption by rGO for three successive cycles with regenerated rGO. Dye adsorption efficiency decreases to 189.17 mg g−1 and 16.5 mg g−1 after 50 minutes of stirring for 2nd and 3rd cycle, respectively. However, saturated adsorption capability becomes 216.58 mg g−1 and 87.73 mg g−1 for 2nd and 3rd cycles respectively. Scheme S1† presents the adsorption and desorption phenomenon of MB by the as-synthesized rGO. Fig. 10  Plot of absorbance (λmax = 662 nm) vs. time (min) for successive three cycles. Raman spectroscopy and DRS analysis were probed to investigate the types of interaction present between rGO and the adsorbed dye molecule. After adsorption, rGO shows certain characteristic Raman peaks for MB (such as 441, 477, 894, 1035, 1423 cm−1) as compared in Fig. S5a.† Shifting to a lower frequency for ‘G band’ of rGO in the ‘MB-adsorbed rGO’ (from 1594 cm−1 to 1583 cm−1) clearly indicates the charge transfer from dye molecule to rGO.45 Again the DRS analysis in Fig. S5b† of the ‘MB-adsorbed rGO’ shows the shift of absorbance band corresponding to MB from 662 nm to 573 nm which presumably results out from the strong electrostatic interaction between MB and rGO. Another broad band at 653 nm is due to the weak π–π interaction between rGO and MB. Here it is worth mentioning that the favourable electrostatic interactions between the positively charged dye molecule and the oxygen functionalities still present in the matrix offer the prior adsorption of cationic dye molecules. Although some other interactions like physisorption, π–π interactions are also responsible to facilitate the adsorption kinetics.65 Similarly another cationic dye molecule crystal violet (CV) can also be completely adsorbed from its solution in the same reaction conditions. The material also performs efficiently for the removal of a neutral dye molecule neutral red (NR). Therefore the participation of the above stated forces (electrostatic interactions, π–π interactions) are considered to be the major controlling parameters in such adsorption process.46 Fig. S6† shows the adsorption kinetics of CV and NR with rGO. The above postulate has been authenticated when we observed a little or no adsorption for anionic dye stuffs like methyl orange (MO), congo red (CR) and eosin Y (EY) (Fig. S7†).Au–rGO nanocomposite and its catalytic activityThe as-synthesized Au–rGO composite was characterized by XRD and TEM analysis. XRD pattern in Fig. 11a shows the well resolved diffraction peaks correspond to gold nanoparticles (JCPDS no. 040784) along with peak for rGO. Fig. 11b shows the TEM image of the aggregated Au nanoparticles attached on rGO sheets and the typical size of the particles are 15–30 nm. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis also supports the presence of gold in the synthesized material (Fig. S8†). Fig. 11  (a) XRD pattern and (b) TEM image of Au–rGO. Catalytic activity of the as-prepared Au–rGO was investigated from pyrogallol (PG) oxidation in presence of t-BuOOH in phosphate buffer (pH = 7) at room temperature. PG is a well-known peroxidase substrate which shows yellow coloration on oxidation by peroxide. So this change in colour from colourless solution to yellow colouration can be monitored by UV-visible spectrophotometer. This process of oxidation is quite slow but becomes faster in presence of peroxidase catalyst. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) produces purpurogallin (yellow colour) on PG oxidation by H2O2.66 Fig. S9a† shows the time dependent absorbance kinetics of PG oxidation catalysed by Au–rGO which indicates that a new peak has been generated at 436 nm with time and reaches its maximum absorbance after 90 minutes. Absorbance vs. time plot (keeping λmax = 436 nm) in Fig. S9b† exhibits a drastic increase in absorbance at the initial step. To study the combined effect of rGO and Au NPs for peroxidase-like activity of Au–rGO, we have conducted different control experiments. In each set of experiment PG oxidation has been studied in presence of t-BuOOH where GO, rGO, Au NPs and Au–rGO has been introduced individually to record their catalytic performances. The result of blank experiment i.e. without any one of the catalysts is also accounted. In all the catalytic reactions the extent of PG oxidation were recorded after 90 minutes of reaction by UV-visible spectrophotometer for their comparative analysis. Amongst all the cases the oxidised product of PG shows highest absorbance in the experimental time scale when Au–rGO is used. Although GO, rGO and 20 nm Au NPs (synthesized by Frens method67) catalyse the oxidation reaction in significantly, but combined effect of rGO and Au NPs in Au–rGO becomes highly commendable for the mentioned reaction (Fig. 12). Synergistically both rGO and Au in Au–rGO nanocomposite make the catalytic process facile in comparison to the individual component as discussed previously.68 Inset of Fig. 12 shows the coloured oxidised product of PG with various catalysts and deep yellow colouration was found with Au–rGO as catalyst. So this unique material provides a platform to mimic the expensive natural enzyme HRP for the oxidation of peroxidise substrate, PG. H2O2 can also performed well in peroxidise like activity of Au–rGO (Fig. S10†) but the extent of oxidation is less compared to t-BuOOH. Fig. 12  UV-visible spectral profile for PG oxidation study (after 90 minutes) in presence of different catalysts (GO, rGO, Au NPs and Au–rGO). Black line stands for the initial absorbance of PG and t-BuOOH mixture. The inset shows the digital images of the respective reaction mixtures. ConclusionsIn conclusion an easy and soft chemical route has been demonstrated for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in large scale. An age-old and common laboratory reagent, benzoin is introduced as a mild but highly efficient reducing agent for the reduction of graphene oxide in 1 h. The reaction is monitored at relatively low temperature, 85 °C and thus a simple water bath is just sufficient to make the recipe fruitful. The pH of the reaction environment has been observed to play a crucial role in the reduction kinetics. The as prepared material has been employed for efficient removal of some cationic dye stuffs and the process can be recycled. Again the synthesis is also devoid of using any capping agents. Therefore the material with its high adsorption capacity provides a suitable platform for waste water treatment. Also the co-operative effect from both Au NPs and rGO helps to obtain Au–rGO nanocomposite with improved peroxidise like activity compare to individual component for the oxidation of pyrogallol by t-BuOOH.AcknowledgementsThe authors are thankful to BRNS and CSIR, New Delhi, India, and the IIT Kharagpur for financial assistance.Notes and referencesK.
