    , Accepted 24th August 2012First published on 28th August 2012AbstractScanning confocal photocurrent microscopy has been used to characterize carrier collection efficiency in lateral bulk heterojunction devices. By analyzing the photocurrent mappings within these devices, the lateral extents of the space charge regions has been measured and reported. Modulation via white light bias or increased voltage bias is also shown to increase the size of the space charge regions.
Organic photovoltaic cells have been actively studied for over 20 years and even though power conversion efficiencies have reached about 10%,1 there is still much to be learned about the transport of charge carriers and recombination mechanisms within these devices. Researchers have employed several methods to study transport and recombination in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, including: ambipolar thin film transistors,2–4 transient photocurrents,5 time-resolved microwave conductivity,6 and photo-generated charge extraction in a linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV).7–9 These reports have typically focused on measurements of vertical solar cell devices, but most techniques require measurement setups that analyze the transient response of solar cells. To enable steady state carrier transport measurements, we have employed a lateral BHJ device structure which was first reported earlier this year.10 These structures allow measurements with length scales ranging from 10's of nm to more than 100's of μm. In contrast to vertical OPV cells in which the active layer is buried beneath metal layers and/or transport layers, the exposed nature of the active material in lateral OPVs allows for the use of spectroscopic and microscopic tools to probe charge carriers along the transport direction. Although the geometry and direction of current flow in lateral BHJ devices is different from vertical OPV devices, the carrier transport and recombination parameters investigated using these lateral device structures provide key insights into BHJ materials and are complementary to studies performed on vertical solar cell structures. In this article, we report on the use of common confocal microscopy tools to probe charge carrier transport and operational regimes within lateral BHJ structures.
Within lateral BHJ devices, three distinct charge transport regimes occur when the total transport distance of charge carriers is longer then their drift length.10,11 The drift length of a charge carrier is the product of the carrier's mobility, its lifetime, and the electric field acting on the carrier. Adjacent to the electrodes, space charge regions (SCR) form and most photogenerated carriers within these regions are collected in the form of photocurrent. The photocurrent flowing in the SCRs is described by Jphoto = (4εμ)1/4(qG)3/4V1/2(1)where ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the mobility of the accumulated charge carrier, q is the elementary charge, G is the carrier generation rate, and V is the voltage drop in the SCR.12 Sandwiched between the SCRs, a central recombination zone will form where there is little net photogeneration and high recombination. The electrical current flowing within this zone should exhibit an ohmic behavior, which has also been recently shown.13 The existence of a single SCR has been previously shown in many reports and would be expected in devices with short transit lengths.10,12,14 A more recent report from Danielson et al.13 as well as this report demonstrate evidence for two SCRs as well as the central recombination zone due to the increased length that charge carriers travel before extraction.
The technique of Scanning Confocal Photocurrent Microscopy (SCPM) is one where an electronic device is raster scanned across a focused laser beam and the extracted photocurrent is measured via lock-in detection. This creates a map of the photogenerated carrier collection as a function of the location of carrier generation. Additionally, reflection and fluorescence information can be simultaneously acquired using the SCPM technique, which allows for the spectroscopic analysis of samples being tested.15,16 SCPM is related to a technique called laser beam induced current (LBIC) which has been previously used to study morphology, photocurrent generation, and local current vs. voltage analysis in numerous material systems used for photovoltaic cells including silicon,17 cadmium telluride,18 copper indium gallium diselenide,15 lead selenide,19 and organic BHJs.20,21 A schematic illustration of the SCPM measurement setup is shown in Fig. 1a.

Lateral BHJ devices were fabricated on a glass substrate. Asymmetric electrodes were defined through two sets of photolithography: one for the aluminum (Al) cathodes and one for the gold (Au) anodes. These metals were chosen to help suppress reverse bias carrier injection within the lateral BHJ device. Each of these metals was thermally evaporated with a thickness of 500 Å. The device length was 20 μm with a W/L = 50. Before deposition of the BHJ layer, the substrate was dipped in a phosphoric acid solution to dissolve any aluminum oxide present on the surface of the Al electrodes. This was followed by a solvent clean to degrease the substrate, which consisted of acetone, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol. The BHJ absorber layer was deposited from a 12 mg mL−1 solution of PSBTBT:PCBM (1:1.5 by weight) dissolved in dichlorobenzene that was heated to 120 °C for more than 12 hours. The BHJ was spun-cast on the prepared substrates at 1000 rpm for 60 seconds and this was followed by encapsulation and annealing at 120 °C for 10 min in a nitrogen atmosphere. AFM scans of the show little difference in the morphology of top surface PSBTBT:PCBM layer both in the active channel of the device and above the electrodes.
SCPM measurements were performed on a 20 μm long lateral BHJ device with a BHJ layer of PSBTBT, poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl], and PCBM, [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester, at applied bias values of −100 V, −150 V, and −200 V and with a white light bias from above when appropriate. The white light bias illuminated the entire device. Applied bias values correspond to electric field strengths of −0.5 × 105 V cm−1, −0.75 × 105 V cm−1, and −1.0 × 105 V cm−1 respectively and are consistent with the internal electric field strength found in typical OPV devices at short circuit conditions. A schematic illustration of the lateral BHJ device structure is shown in Fig. 1b and a reflectance image of the measured lateral BHJ device is shown in Fig. 1c. The reflectance image shows that the light reflected by the aluminum cathode is greater then the amount of reflected light coming off the gold anode, and this can be used to confirm the orientation of the device during measurement. The was little difference in the photocurrent maps when varying the laser intensity while under only laser excitation (with no white light bias) and an incident power of 1000 nW was used for all measurements presented in this article.
An SCPM photocurrent image taken at −100 V applied bias and no white light bias is shown in Fig. 2a. Photocurrent peaks can be seen extending inward a few microns from either electrode which denoted by the white hashed lines. These areas of high carrier collection efficiency correspond to the lateral extents of the SCRs. Between the SCRs, there is a region of low photocurrent (carrier collection efficiency), which corresponds to the recombination zone. Photocurrent maps taken at −150 V and −200 V applied biases are shown in Fig. 2b and c respectively. As the applied bias increases, the photocurrent peak heights as well as the extents of the space charge regions also increase.

(d) Extracted photocurrent profiles (dots) and data fits (red lines) to extract the SCR lengths from the same lateral BHJ device. The lateral extents of the device channel are bounded by dashed lines. Photocurrent maps are 50 μm × 50 μm. 
The device architecture allows all the lines in the photocurrent map to be averaged to generate photocurrent collection profiles that can be used to quantify the SCR regions. The data in Fig. 2a–c were used to create the profiles shown in Fig. 2d. Several different methods were used to quantify the decay of the photocurrent peak. Fitting the portion of the peak adjacent to the SCR with an exponential decay yielded the smallest residuals. As a result, the photocurrent collected as a function of laser excitation position is modeled as  for electrons and  for holes in the case where the cathode is located at x = 0 and the anode is located at x = L.‡ The finite diameter of the laser spot results in a peak in the collected photocurrent that is not directly at the edge of the electrode. In the case of both the anode and the cathode, the peak is shifted by ∼2.1 μm toward the center of the device. Taking into account this instrument broadening, the length of the SCR adjacent to the cathode is  and the length of the SCR region adjacent to the anode is . Fitting to the data in Fig. 2d, the length of the space charge region adjacent to the cathode is 2.50 μm, 2.67 μm, and 2.83 μm for applied biases of −100 V, −150 V, and −200 V respectively. Similarly, the length of the space charge region adjacent to the anode is 2.77 μm, 3.07 μm, and 3.26 μm for applied biases of −100 V, −150 V, and −200 V respectively.
To determine the effect of adding white light to the system, the above SCPM measurements were repeated with a white light bias of 150 mW cm−2. It is predicted that the addition of photogenerated carriers via a constant white light source will fill energetic traps and should increase distance from the electrodes where photogenerated carriers can be efficiently collected. The carriers that are generated from the white light source will not be measured in the photocurrent collection, as they will be filtered out by the lock-in detection. Fig. 3a shows the photocurrent mapping with an applied bias of −100 V and a 150 mW cm−2 white light bias. By comparing the SCPM measurements with and without light bias, the addition of a white light bias increases the size of the space charge region by about 40% for both electrons and holes. SCPM photocurrent maps for applied biases of −150 V and −200 V under a white light bias of 150 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3b and c respectively. For these increased voltage biases, the length of the SCRs have increased under white light bias as compared to dark conditions.

(d) Extracted photocurrent profiles (dots) and data fits (red lines) to extract the SCR lengths from the same lateral BHJ device. The lateral extents of the device channel are bounded by dashed lines. Photocurrent maps are 50 μm × 50 μm. 
Using the data analysis procedure described previously, the photocurrent maps have been averaged over all rows in the image to create a photocurrent profile under white light bias, which is shown in Fig. 3d. Using the same data fitting methodology, the length of the SCRs have been extracted under white light bias. The length of the space charge region adjacent to the cathode is 3.66 μm, 4.07 μm, and 4.87 μm and the length adjacent to the anode is 3.66 μm, 4.47 μm, and 4.88 μm for applied biases of −100 V, −150 V, and −200 V respectively. All of the extracted length values corresponding to the extents of the SCRs for the 20 μm lateral BHJ device are listed in Table 1.

Since the lengths of the space charge regions for the cathode and the anode are equal under white light bias, the mobility of electrons and holes should be approximately equal and can be extracted using eqn (1). By setting the photocurrent equal to −200 nA which is the total measured photocurrent with an applied bias of −200 V, the mobility of both electrons and holes is roughly 3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is consistent with previous reports of PSBTBT:PCBM.8,16,22,23
Conclusions
As these results clearly demonstrate, the SCPM technique is capable of directly measuring the spatial extents of the space charge regions in lateral BHJ devices. The lateral extent of the space charge regions in the PSBTBT:PCBM system are a 3–7 μm which should not be a efficiency limiting factor for use in vertical OPV cell structures as the typical vertical OPV cell has a carrier transit distance which is no more than a few hundred nanometers. However, the size of the SCRs yields important fundamental information for studying charge carrier transport and recombination mechanisms within BHJ devices. Modifications to the applied bias and the addition of a white light bias result in predictable changes to the size of the SCR as predicted by previously published work. By comparing the size of two SCRs the asymmetry in electron and hole mobilities can be estimated. Specifically, under a white light bias and applied biases that mimic typical operating conditions, the extents of the SCRs for both the anode and cathode are approximately equal. This implies that the mobility asymmetry is low, which is to be expected from high performance OPV materials such as PSBTBT:PCBM.
SCPM and other measurements of lateral BHJ devices provide charge transport and recombination information that is complementary to what can be acquired from traditional vertical OPV devices. For example, changes in morphology of a device can be studied using SCPM and should be directly related to changes in the SCR. This information on the loss mechanisms within BHJ materials can provide researchers with insight on how to better optimize BHJ materials and device architectures which is critical to improving device efficiency.
