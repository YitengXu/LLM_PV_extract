    , Accepted 17th December 2008First published on 3rd February 2009AbstractThree donor–(π-spacer)–acceptor dyes, coded as DS-3, DS-5 and DS-6, were designed and synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These dyes possess the same donor (triarylamine) and acceptor/anchoring group (2-cyanoacrylic acid), but the varied π-spacers consisting of a combination of thiophene and/or 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) units. They were evaluated by photophysical and electrochemical measurements as well as in nanocrystalline TiO2-based DSSCs fabricated using them as light-harvesting sensitizers. The results showed that incorporation of the EDOT moiety in the dye molecules strongly affected the molar extinction coefficient and photocurrent response. Among the three dyes, the DS-5-based DSSCs afforded the best photovoltaic performance: a maximum monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 80%, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.6 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.59 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 6.03% under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation, which reached 77% with respect to that of an N3-based device fabricated and measured under similar conditions. Further, a method of molecular orbital calculations was employed for the insight into the geometrical, electronic and optical properties of these dyes.
Introduction
Since the seminal publication of Grätzel and co-workers in 1991,1dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable interest because of their higher conversion efficiency of sunlight-to-electricity and potential low costs of production and materials as compared to conventional silicon-based solar cells. Typically, DSSCs are composed of a photoactive TiO2 anode coated with photosensitizers (sensitizing dyes), redox electrolytes and a passive cathode (n-type DSSCs).2 In such devices, the sensitizing dye must be adsorbed chemically onto the surface of nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2. Upon light illumination, the adsorbed dye becomes an excited state and then the excited dye injects electrons into the conduction band of TiO2. The electrons are brought back to the oxidized dye through an external circuit, a passive cathode and a redox electrolyte system (typically I−/I3−), regenerating the oxidized sensitizing dye.
Among all the elements of DSSCs, the photosensitizer is fundamental to the cell’s performance and stability. Sensitizing dyes for DSSCs are divided generally into two types, inorganic metal complexes and metal-free organic dyes. Although inorganic dyes, such as Ru complexes (N3, N719 and black dyes),3–5 can provide efficient solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiencies of up to 10%, the Ru sources and the resulting environmental issues would greatly limit their applications outdoors. In recent years, metal-free organic dyes as an alternative to the noble metal complexes have been attracting increasing attention because of the following advantages: easy preparation; low costs and little environment issues; high molar extinction coefficient; and a wider variety of structures, etc. Generally, a good organic sensitizing dye must meet some basic requirements: (1) the HOMO energy level should be sufficiently lower than the corresponding redox couple (electrolytes, e.g., I−/I3−) so that the dye can be quickly regenerated from its oxidized state, and the LUMO energy level should be sufficiently more negative than the conduction band edge level of TiO2 to ensure electron injection efficiently; (2) the absorption of the dye should overlap the largest possible range of the solar spectrum, especially the region from the visible to near-infrared light because the photon flux in this region is largest in the solar irradiation spectrum; and (3) the molecular structure of dye should be a D–π–A mode to facilitate charge transfer and subsequent charge separation, and to slow down the charge recombination between the injected electron and the oxidized dye. To date, remarkable advances have been made in organic dyes as photosensitizers for DSSCs. Various organic dyes, such as perylene,6cyanine,7porphyrin,8phthalocyanine,9merocyanine,10coumarin,11hemicyanine,12indoline13 and triphenylamine14dyes, have been employed. Particularly, a high η value of 9% was achieved in full sunlight by Ito et al. using indoline dye as photosensitizer in DSSCs.15 These results have shown a promising potential for organic dye-based DSSCs in practical applications.
Organic dyes for DSSCs consist commonly of donor, linker and acceptor (i.e., D–π–A structure), and hence their various properties could be finely tuned by alternating independently or matching different parts in a D–π–A dye. Certainly, the π-spacers as bridging groups play an important role in modifying properties and performances. We were interested in introduction of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) into π-linker groups in dye molecules because EDOT is a conducting molecule and has presented some specific properties as a building block in functionalized π-conjugated systems or polymers.16 However, EDOT has rarely been employed as the structural part of photosensitizers in DSSCs, and only an extremely low efficiency was achieved in one publication on EDOT-containing organic dye-based DSSCs.17 Herein we wish to report our investigation into three D–π–A chromophores coded as DS-3, DS-5 and DS-6 (Fig. 1) which contain the triarylamine group as donor (D), 2-cyanoacrylic acid as acceptor (A) bridged by thiophene and/or EDOT units.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of materials
The photosensitive dyes in this study are depicted in Fig. 1. Synthetic routes to the as-synthesized organic dyes are illustrated in Scheme 1. (E)-1,2-Bis(5-formyl-2-thienyl)ethane reacted with p-(di-p-tolylamino)benzyltriphenylphosphonium bromide leading to compound 1 through a mono-Wittig reaction.18 The thiophene moiety was coupled to the donor to afford compound 2 by the Wittig–Horner reaction of p-(di-p-tolylamino)benzyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and thiophene-2-carbaldehyde. The intermediate 2 was then converted to the corresponding aldehyde 3 in a moderate yield by the Vilsmeier reaction in the presence of DMF and POCl3 in refluxing anhydrous dichloromethane. A second Wittig–Hornor reaction of 3 with 3,4-ethylenedioxy-2-thienylmethyl triphenylphosphonium bromide produced 4 which was subjected to a Vilsmeier reaction to give 5. The intermediate 7 was also prepared by a process similar to the synthesis of compound 3. Finally, target dyes were yielded by the Knoevenagel reaction of the corresponding aldehydes with cyanoacetic acid in refluxing acetonitrile in the presence of piperidine. These target dyes were fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis, and found to be consistent with the proposed structures. The obtained dyes are purple or violet in the solid state, and easily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, THF, DMF, etc.

Photophysical properties
The absorption spectra of the dyes in DMF solutions are displayed in Fig. 2(a), and the corresponding data are presented in Table 1. All the three dyes exhibited a π–π* transition band in the range of 300–350 nm. Moreover, they also give a strong absorption maximum (460–490 nm) in the visible region, which may be assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption because an efficient charge-separated excited state could be produced between the triarylamine and the cyanoacrylic acid moieties.19 As seen in Table 1, the ICT absorption (λmax) appeared at 473 nm for DS-3, 486 nm for DS-5, and 478 nm for DS-6, respectively; molar extinction coefficients at visible maxima (ε) were 34000 M−1 cm−1 for DS-3, 61000 M−1 cm−1 for DS-5, and 41000 M−1 cm−1 for DS-6, respectively, all of which are twice as high as that of Ru(dcbpy)2(NCS)2 (N3 dye: ca. 1.6 × 104 M−1 cm−1).20 The ε values of DS-5 and DS-6 are superior to dye DS-3 due likely to a more extensive conjugation of molecules containing the EDOT moiety. Also as seen from Fig. 2(a), the maximum absorption of DS-5 is slightly red-shifted in comparison with that of DS-6, which should be attributed to a little more expansion of the DS-5π-system by introduction of one additional methine unit into its π-bridge. Further, the half-height absorption width of DS-5 is remarkably larger than those of both DS-6 and DS-3, and thus it is predictable that dye DS-5 has an enhanced ability to harvest solar light.

Fig. 2(b) shows the normalized absorption and emission spectra of DS-5 in air-equilibrated DMF solution (0.5 mM), and the data were also collected in Table 1. The excitation wavelength for emissions was 480 nm. The maximum absorption and emission in DMF are at 486 and 633 nm, respectively. On the other hand, no emission signal was observed for all three dyes on the TiO2 colloidal electrodes, suggesting that there existed an efficient electron injection from the excited dye molecules into the conduction band of TiO2.
The absorption spectra of the dyes absorbed onto TiO2 nanocrystalline electrodes are shown in Fig. 3. The absorption spectra of the dyes were distinctly broadened. Such spectral broadening is favourable for harvesting visible light. Compared to the absorption spectra in solutions, the film absorptions of DS-3 and DS-6 show a large red-shift (DS-3: 34 nm; and DS-6: 30 nm) due to J-aggregation, while dye DS-5 was slightly blue-shifted (from 486 to 480 nm) which could be ascribed to slight H-aggregation on the TiO2 surface. Such aggregation phenomena have been observed in several organic dyes.21,22 Thus, chenodeoxychlolic acid is usually used as a co-adsorbent to suppress dye aggregation in DSSC assembly since dye aggregation tends to impair electron injection from the excited dye to the TiO2.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical behavior of the dyes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the data are listed in Table 1. The oxidation potentials of the as-synthesized dyes are determined from the oxidation peak potential and reduction peak potential for the oxidation process. As seen in Fig. 4, the dyes can be reversibly oxidized at a moderately high oxidation potential under low concentration conditions. The oxidation potential vs.NHE (Eox) corresponds to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). As listed in Table 1, the first oxidation potentials of the dyes (0.96–1.04 V vs.NHE) are more positive than the I−/I3−redox couple (∼0.4 V vs.NHE). The sufficiently low HOMO energy level of the dye can ensure more effective dye regeneration and restrain the recapture of the injected electrons by the dye cation radical or the I−/I3−redox couple. Moreover, the oxidation potential of dye DS-5 (1.03 V) is slightly negative than that of DS-3 (1.04 V) likely because the former has a strong electron-donating EDOT moiety. Interestingly, dye DS-6 (0.96 V) bearing two EDOT units attains only a relatively low oxidation potential compared to DS-5.
 Fig. 4  
Cyclic voltammetry of the dye DS-5. Scanning rate is 100 mV s−1; working electrode and counter electrode: Pt wires; reference electrode: Hg/Hg2Cl2. 
The excited state oxidation potential (Eox*) of the sensitizer, corresponding to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), is determined from the first oxidation potential (Eox) of the ground state and the zero–zero transition energy (E0–0) according to eqn (1): E*ox = Eox−E0–0(1)where E0–0 was estimated from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra. As listed in Table 1, the excited state potentials of the dyes (DS-3: −1.23 V vs.NHE; DS-5: −1.21 V vs.NHE; DS-6: −1.36 V vs.NHE) are much more negative than the conduction band energy level of TiO2 (ca. −0.5 V vs.NHE), clarifying that the electron injection should be possible thermodynamically. Furthermore, the positive shift of the excited state oxidation potentials for DS-3 and DS-5, compared to dye DS-6, can be explained by the presence of two EDOT units in DS-6 which enrich the electron density and make the molecule more easily oxidized.
Photovoltaic devices
DSSCs were fabricated using the dyes DS-3, DS-5 and DS-6, as photosensitizers with an effective working area of 0.2 cm2, nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 on FTO, the electrolyte composed of 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.75 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a co-solvent of acetonitrile–valeronitrile (1 : 1, v/v). The action spectra of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength, which is defined as the number of electrons generated by light in the external circuit divided by the number of incident photons, is calculated using eqn (2), and the data are plotted in Fig. 5. (2)In eqn (2), Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent generated by monochromatic light, λ the wavelength of incident monochromatic light, and φ the incident light intensity.

The electrolyte used was 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.75 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a co-solvent of acetonitrile–valeronitrile (1 : 1, v/v). 
For DS-5, a high IPCE (above 70%) was obtained in the range from 400 to 560 nm with a maximum value of 80% at 480 nm; the onset of IPCE was extended to 800 nm. Considering reflection and absorption losses in the transparent conducting oxide substrate, the net photon-to-current conversion efficiency exceeds 95%, indicating a highly efficient performance of the DS-5-based solar cell. In the cases of DS-3 and DS-6, relatively low IPCE values were observed, with maximum values of 67% at 483 nm (for DS-3) and 50% at 548 nm (for DS-6). The higher IPCE values for DS-5 should stem from its broader absorption and enhanced molar extinction coefficient in the visible region. Relative to the dye DS-5, relatively low IPCE values of DS-6 could be caused by a serious self-quenching of the electronically excited state because of cis–transisomerization and the disordered alignment of chromophores in J-like aggregation.21b

Fig. 6 presents photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the cells measured under simulated solar irradiation (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2, 1.5 air mass global). The open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies (η) are listed in Table 1. The conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSCs is calculated from the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), and the intensity of the incident light (Pin),23 by eqn (3): (3)
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the three dye-sensitized solar cells under illumination of simulated solar light (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The electrode used was the same as that for Fig. 5. 
Under solar-simulated light irradiation, the DS-5-sensitized solar cell shows a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.6 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.59 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.70, corresponding to an overall energy conversion efficiency (η) of 6.03%; the DS-3-sensitized cell gave Jsc of 11.1 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.63 V and FF of 0.73, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency η of 5.12%. Compared to the dye DS-3, the DS-5-based cell exhibits larger energy conversion efficiency due mainly to its larger short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc). The reason may be that DS-5 has both a broader absorption and a larger molar extinction coefficient in the visible region and hence could more efficiently capture the solar radiation energy. On the other hand, the DS-6-sensitized cell exhibited much lower photovoltaic performance compared to the DS-3 and DS-5 based cells, which could be attributed to its lower spectral response due to the strong aggregation of DS-6 on TiO2 films. Here, the DS-6-sensitized cell gave Jsc of 9.46 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.585 V and FF of 0.65, corresponding to only 3.59% of overall conversion efficiencies (η). For comparison, the device with standard N3 dye has Jsc = 16.87 mA cm−2, Voc = 680 mV, FF = 0.68 and η = 7.82% under the similar conditions. The results suggest a promising prospect of the as-synthesized organic dyes applied in DSSCs, particularly DS-5.
It is necessary to make a further comparison between DS-3 and DS-5 since they have a similar structure but display distinctly different photocurrent values. The principal factor should be that DS-5 has better light harvesting ability (broader absorption and larger molar extinction coefficient). The dark current–voltage curves obtained from the DS-3 and DS-5 based DSSCs are shown in Fig. 7. DS-5 showed a larger dark current and thus a higher degree of charge recombination mainly with the electrolyte species.14a So the introduction of the EDOT moiety may change the arrangement and orientation manner of dye molecules and further influence the access of electrons in TiO2 to oxidized electrolyte. The charge recombination at the interface would directly result in low Voc values.24 Consistent with the above-mentioned dark current analyses, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) value is in the order of DS-5 < DS-3. On the other hand, DS-5 can furnish a relatively higher short-circuit photocurrent density in contrast to DS-3. Finally the DS-5 based photocell produced a higher conversion efficiency than that of the DS-3. So a suitable π-spacer should be adopted to the photosensitizer structure for the balance between Voc and Jsc in pursuit of a superior conversion efficiency. A further study on dynamics of electron transport and recombination of DSSCs based on the two dyes are underway.

Molecular orbital calculations
To gain insight into the geometrical, electronic and optical properties of dyes, we mimicked the optimized geometries of the three dyes by the hybrid density functional theory (B3LYP) with 6-31G(D) basis set as implemented in the Gaussian 03 program.28 The electron distributions of the HOMO and LUMO of the dyes are shown in Fig. 8. At the ground state for the dyes, electrons are homogeneously distributed in both the electron donor and π-bridge, and upon the light illumination, electrons move from the HOMO to the LUMO by an intramolecular charge transfer, and are finally located in anchoring groups through the π-bridge. Fig. 8 reveals that the cyanoacrylic acid group is essentially coplanar with respect to the thiophene and/or EDOT fragments in their energy minimised structures. Assuming that the dye molecule has a similar molecular orbital geometry when anchored to TiO2, the position of the LUMO close to the anchoring group would enhance the orbital overlap with the titanium 3d orbital and thus favor electron injection from dye to TiO2.

Conclusions
We have investigated three metal-free organic dyes (DS-3, DS-5 and DS-6) that feature triarylamine as electron-donating moiety and cyanoacrylic acid as electron-accepting moiety bridged by thiophene and/or EDOT moieties. Introduction of the EDOT moiety could strongly affect the photocurrent response of the dyes by controlling photophysical and photovoltaic properties. Under the photovoltaic performance measurement, a maximum photo-to-electron conversion efficiency of 6.03% was achieved with the DSSC based on dye DS-5 under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), which reached 77% with respect to that of an N3-based device fabricated and measured under similar conditions. Our results demonstrated the necessity and importance of designing or modifying π-spacers in D–π–A dyes for DSSCs. Further structural modification of DS-5 for broadening the spectral absorption and increasing the molar extinction coefficient is anticipated to give some new organic dyes with even better performances.

Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical redox potentials were measured viacyclic voltammetry using a three-electrode cell under room temperature in DMF solutions. The working and counter electrodes were Pt wires, and the reference electrode was Hg/Hg2Cl2. The electrolyte was 0.1 M (n-C4H9)4NPF6 in DMF. The E1/2 values were determined as (Epa + Epc)/2, where Epa and Epc are the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, respectively. Ferrocene was added to each sample solution at the end of the experiments, and the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as an internal potential reference.
Fabrication of the dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2electrodes
For fabrication of the devices, two layers of TiO2, the main layer and scattering layer, were prepared by screen-printing TiO2 pastes on FTO glass substrate (10 Ω□−1, Nippon Sheet Glass). The main layer (thickness: 14 μm; TiO2 particle size: 18 nm) and scattering layer (thickness: 8 μm; TiO2 particle size: 400 nm) were prepared from these two different TiO2 colloids (PST-18NR and PST-400C from Catalysts & Chemicals Ind. Co., Ltd, CCIC in Japan). After screen-printing, the TiO2 film was heated at 500 °C for 30 min, and treated with 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution as reported by Ito.26 The three dyes and N3 solutions were prepared in DMF at a concentration of 0.5 mM; 1 mM chenodeoxycholic acid in tert-butyl alcohol–acetonitrile (1 : 1, v/v) was added as reported in order to effectively prevent unfavorable dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface.27 The TiO2 films were left in solution at room temperature for 24 h. A Pt-sputtered FTO glass was used as a counter electrode. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.75 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a co-solvent of acetonitrile–valeronitrile (1 : 1, v/v). The photovoltaic performance of the devices was recorded under 100 mW cm−2 simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar light illumination.
Photovoltaic measurements
The action spectra of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for solar cells was performed by using a commercial setup for IPCE measurement (PV-25 DYE, JASCO) under 5 mW cm−2 monochromic light illumination. The irradiation source for the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurement is an AM 1.5 solar simulator (YSS-50A, Yamashita Denso Co. Ltd.). A 500-W Xe lamp serves as the light source in combination with a band-pass filter (400–800 nm) to remove the ultraviolet and infrared light and to give a light power of 100 mW cm−2. The current–voltage curves were obtained by a linear sweep voltammetry method using an electrochemical workstation using a PC-controlled voltage–current source meter (R6246, Advantest) under a solar simulator illumination (Yamashita Denso, Yss-80) of Air Mass 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) conditions at 25 °C. The active electrode area was 0.2 cm2.
Molecular orbital calculations
All calculations were performed on the Gaussian 03 program package by using Density Functional Theory (DFT).28 B3LYP and the 6-31 G (D) basis set were used. Before optimizing ground-state geometries by B3LYP/6-31G(D), the molecular structures were initially optimized in a HF/ST0-3G calculation method. All the geometries and electronic properties were calculated by assuming that the target molecules would be isolated in gas phase.
