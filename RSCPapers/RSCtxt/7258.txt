    , Accepted 19th May 2023First published on 19th May 2023AbstractStable, high-efficiency, and highly active electrocatalysts are critical for the conversion of renewable energy through overall water splitting. Our first-principles calculations identify two-dimensional conjugated metal–organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) with dual metal sites as promising candidates for this process. Among them, PcCo-O8-Rh stands out as the best catalyst, with Rh serving as the active site for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in a low ηHER/ηOER of −0.19/0.25 V. Our findings suggest that the HER/OER activity of PcTM-O8-TM′ can be optimized through tensile strain, as it is related to the absorption strength of intermediates and the d-band center (εd) of the TM atom. This study presents a new family of 2D c-MOFs as high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, paving the way towards sustainable energy conversion.
1. Introduction
The fast depletion of fossil fuels and rapid population growth have led to substantial demand for green energy in recent years.1,2 Renewable energy producers, like solar cells, wind power generation, photocatalysis and so on, have attracted wide attention recently. Among them, electrocatalytic water splitting, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),3–8 is regarded as a promising solution to address large-scale energy supply and demand,6,9 due to its endless supply and pollution free. To achieve this goal, two catalysts are therefore required for the HER and the OER respectively. However, their integration is often incompatible, leading to overall weak performance.10,11 Alternatively, a bifunctional catalyst can be built, which can not only enhance the electrocatalytic performance but also simplify the preparation process and reduce the cost.12–17 Therefore, developing bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting at low cost is highly desirable.
Two-dimensional metal–organic frameworks (2D MOFs) have been extensively used in catalytic systems owing to three features: 1. the intrinsic nanoscale pores provide sufficient and controllable mass transfer to and from the active sites.18,19 2. The integration of the well-defined and highly active sites into a stable and defined framework ensures remarkable catalytic activity and selectivity.20,21 3. The catalytic reaction can be modulated by modifying the catalytic environment around the active site.22,23 For instance, Wang et al. reported Co-PMOF as an electrocatalyst for CO2RR with a low limiting potential (0.41 V).24 Feng et al. showed that Mo3(C2O)12 can serve as a promising nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalyst owing to its substantial selectivity and high nitrogen fixation activity.25,26 Additionally, ultrathin MOF nanosheets exhibited significant catalytic performances for the HER, OER and overall water splitting.13,14 Although 2D MOFs show great potential for various chemical reactions, the catalytic performance of conventional MOFs is limited due to their low electric conductivity.2,27,28
Recent studies suggest that 2D-conjugated MOFs (2D c-MOFs) with strong in-plane conjugation and weak out-of-plane stacking not only inherit the features of conventional 2D MOFs but also exhibit a higher density of exposed TM centres and enhanced electronic conductivity, implying potentially high electrocatalytic performance.26,29–34 Specifically, the current ligands used in the construction of 2D c-MOFs have been mainly based on planar conjugated building blocks with symmetrical functional groups of OH, NH2, and SH.33 Varying the functional groups results in increased bond strength between metals and linkers, leading to enhanced in-plane charge transport along the 2D network.33–35 Among these 2D c-MOFs, TMO4-linked ones exhibited apparently inferior charge transport to the related 2D c-MOFs linked by a TMN4 coordination complex. These findings suggest that 2D c-MOFs offer superior performance over other 2D MOFs and have significant applications in the field of electrocatalysis.34
2D c-MOFs have attracted significant interest as potential electrocatalysts due to their unique structural and electronic properties. Among them, PcTM-O8-TM′ which consists of a transitional metal (TM) phthalocyanine (TMN4) as the ligand and TM-bis(dihydroxy) complex (TM′O4) as the linkage (named PcTM-O8-TM′) has been synthesized in experiments and gained attention as an electrocatalyst, and its dual active sites (TMN4 and TM′O4) are predicted to contribute to a synergistic effect on the different chemical reactions.34,36 For example, PcCu-O8-Co mixed with carbon nanotubes affords superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media.37 PcNi-O8-Ni exhibits high performance for the OER.38 PcCu-O8-Zn can effectively achieve CO2RR and tune into syngas synergistically.39 These pioneering studies implied that 2D c-MOFs are promising candidates for highly efficient and stable electrocatalysis.
In this work, motivated by previous theoretical calculations and experimental progress, we investigate the potential of PcTM-O8-TM′ 2D c-MOFs as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. A series of PcTM-O8-TM′ (TM = Co, Cu, Ir, or Rh; TM′ = Co, Cu, Ir, or Rh) were built to assess the water splitting performance by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that PcTM-O8-TM′ generally possesses good electrical conductivity, depending on the TM atoms. PcCo-O8-Rh can serve as a bifunctional overall water splitting catalyst, where the HER and OER occur preferentially at the Rh site. Using the d-band centre (εd) as a key descriptor, we found that the optimal HER/OER activity is achieved when εd is located within a moderate range. We therefore propose to modulate the catalytic activity with tensile strain due to the strain-shifted position of the d-band centre. Our work not only paves a new way for overall water splitting bifunctional electrocatalysts based on 2D c-MOFs but also provides theoretical guidelines for designing 2D c-MOF electrocatalysts for different chemical reactions.
2. Computational methods
All spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using first-principles calculations in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) implemented with projector-augmented-wave (PAW).34–41 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to describe the interaction between the valence and core electrons,42–44 and the dispersion correction method (DFT-D3) was chosen to account for the van der Waals interactions. The cutoff energy was 500 eV and 3 × 3 × 1 and 7 × 7 × 1 gamma-centered k-point meshes were used for structural optimizations and energy calculations, respectively. To discuss the stability of all designed structures, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were employed using the Nosé–Hoover thermostat for the NVT ensemble with a time step of 10 fs for 5 ps on a 1 × 1 × 1 supercell of PcTM-O8-TM′.45,46 The cohesive energy of PcTM-O8-TM′ was estimated according to: EC = ET − 32EC − 8EO − 8EN − 2ETM − 8EH − ETM(1)where ET is the total energy of PcTM-O8-TM′, and EC, EO, EN, EH, ETM and ETM′ are the total energies of C, O, N, H, TM, and TM′ atoms respectively, which are equal to the total energies of the stable elemental solid/gas (EC = graphite, EO = oxygen, EN = nitrogen, EH = hydrogen, ETM and ETM′ = their bulk phases).
For OER at pH = 0, the 4e− reaction pathway of the OER in an acidic environment can be described by the following elementary steps: H2O + * → OH* + H+ + e−(2) OH* → O* + H+ + e−(3) H2O + O* → OOH* + H+ + e−(4) OOH* → * + O2 + H+ + e−(5)where * represents an active site on the catalyst surface, while OH*, O*, and OOH* are different adsorbed intermediates. Based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model,47,48 the Gibbs free energy changes ΔGOER (OER = OH*, O*, OOH*) in the OER can be determined with the following equation: ΔGOER = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔS + ΔGU(6)where ΔE is the total energy of the catalyst with one adsorbed intermediate. ΔZPE and ΔS denote the differences in zero-point energy change and entropy, respectively. ΔGU = −eU, in which e and U are the elementary charge and the electrode potential, respectively. The detailed calculations for adsorbed OH*, O*, and OOH* intermediates are presented in the ESI (see eqn (S1)–(S10)†).
The OER overpotentials ηOER were calculated using: (7)
For the HER, the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) is calculated by considering the following equation: ΔGH* = ΔEH* + ΔZPE − TΔS(8)where ΔEH* is the total energy of the catalyst with one adsorbed H atom. The detailed calculations for H* are presented in the ESI (see eqn (S11) and (12)†).
To calculate the HER overpotentials ηHER, we use: (9)
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural optimization and discussion of electronic properties
Based on the recent experimentally synthesized PcTM-O8-TM′,37–39,49 the 2D c-MOFs we study in this work are designed by changing the TM atom at the active sites, as shown in Fig. 1a; they consist of phthalocyaninato TM as the ligand (TMN4) and TM-bis(dihydroxy) complex (TM′O4) as the linkage. The TM/TM′ atoms (Co, Cu, Ir, and Rh) which bond with surrounding nitrogen/oxygen are the potential catalytically-active sites as dual reaction centres. The relationship between the electronic structure and activity will be studied in this work, and catalysts with high electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting will be screened.50–56 From the optimized structures, it is found that the distance between TM and TM′ (DTM) is generally larger than 9 Å, and the two catalytic sites can conduct reactions independently without strong coupling.57–60 For simplicity in the following discussion, we name the two TM complexes (TMN4 and TM′O4) as A and B sites, respectively.

As a prerequisite for long-term and efficient catalysis, the stabilities of all the designed PcTM-O8-TM′ are studied first. The cohesive energy of PcTM-O8-TM′ was calculated to examine the possibility of synthesis; see Fig. 1b. The calculated values are between −3.37 and −6.34 eV, indicating the feasibility of synthesizing PcTM-O8-TM′ from the corresponding ligands. We also verify the thermal stabilities of the designed PcTM-O8-TM′ from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (Fig. S1†), and it is found that the total energy oscillates around the equilibrium value at 300 K during a period of 5 ps, and there is no structural reconstruction or breaking, indicating that 2D c-MOFs can remain stable in room-temperature environments.
Conductivity is a crucial parameter to measure the electrochemical activity ability of electrocatalysts. Therefore, we studied the electronic properties of PcTM-O8-TM′, including the band structures and density of states (DOS) in Fig. 2. It is found that all the PcTM-O8-TM′ are metallic with significant electronic states crossing the Fermi level, which could lead to high electric mobility and facilitate electron transfer between PcTM-O8-TM′ and the reaction intermediates. The high electric conductivity will be achieved due to π-d hybridization at the TM nodes and extended π-conjugation of organic ligands,34,61–63 to benefit HER/OER electrocatalysis. The projected DOS analysis revealed that the states crossing the Fermi level are mainly contributed from the TM atoms, specifically from the d-orbitals (except in the case of PcCo-O8-Cu), owing to their higher number of valence electrons. The partially filled d-orbitals of TM atoms can hybridize with the organic ligands, leading to stronger electron delocalization.64–67 It is worth pointing out that the TM atom at the A site makes the main contribution for the states near the Fermi level in the cases of PcCo-O8-Cu, PcIr-O8-Co, and PcRh-O8-Co. In contrast, for the remaining three, most of the electronic states crossing the Fermi level are from the TM atoms at the B site. Based on d-band theory and previous studies,68 where the electron states at the Fermi level can significantly affect the HER and OER activities of 2D c-MOFs, it is expected that the TM atoms making the main contribution near the Fermi level are potential catalytically-active sites for the HER and OER, and different HER/OER catalytic activities can be achieved by replacing the transition metal atoms of PcTM-O8-TM′.

The red and blue lines depicted in the band structure illustrate the spin-up and spin-down electron states, respectively. Meanwhile, the green and purple lines in the DOS analysis signify the d-orbitals of the corresponding TM atoms. The Fermi level is set to zero. 
The structure–activity relationship toward PcTM-O8-TM′ can also be seen from Bader charge analysis (see Table S2†). Owing to the difference in electronegativity, the transition metal atoms will donate a significant number of electrons to the surrounding N and O atoms, which are in the range of 0.82–1.86e, and the positively charged TM sites would favour the adsorption of the HER/OER intermediate due to an electron donating/back-donating mechanism and thus be active for the HER and OER. More importantly, the different electrophilicities of N and O atoms contribute to synergistic activation of the TM atoms, resulting in different catalytic activities of the A and B sites of these 2D c-MOFs. This result is consistent with the above DOS analysis that TM atoms are optimal active sites of PcTM-O8-TM′ and different HER/OER activities can be attained by A and B sites.
3.2 OER and HER performances of 2D c-MOFs
In the following, the above hypothesis will be verified by directly investigating the electrocatalytic overall water splitting (HER/OER) performance of PcTM-O8-TM′. The variation in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for each elementary step along the reaction pathway will be calculated to examine the electrocatalytic activity of PcTM-O8-TM′ (see Table 1).

The OER reactions follow the 4e− pathway, namely: (i) the first H2O molecule adsorbs on the TM active site and dissociates into an OH group (OH*). (ii) An O group (O*) is formed from deprotonated OH*. (iii) O* is oxidized to OOH* by reaction with another H2O molecule. (iv) An O2 molecule is formed and released. The detailed Gibbs free energy diagrams for PcTM-O8-TM′ are plotted in Fig. S2.† The potential-determining steps for the OER on the designed PcTM-O8-TM′ are mainly located in the 1st step, followed by the 2nd and 3rd steps, as listed in Table S1.† Since the intermediate of OOH* cannot be stably absorbed on the B site of PcCo-O8-Ir, the configuration for the OER is therefore neglected in the following discussions. To effectively compare the site-dependent OER activities of PcTM-O8-TM′, the Gibbs free energy diagrams with applied potential are plotted in Fig. 3a and b. One can see that most of the PcTM-O8-TM′ exhibit weak OER activity with a high overpotential (ηOER), except PcCo-O8-Ir-A (ηOER = 0.35 V) and PcCo-O8-Rh-B (ηOER = 0.25 V). These values are even lower than those of the well-known OER catalysts IrO2 (0.56 V)69 and RhO2 (0.42 V).66 The two 2D c-MOFs are thus promising for the OER reaction and water splitting.

As the potential-determining steps which determine the catalytic activity for the OER, the Gibbs free energy variation ΔGOH* has a linear relationship with ΔGO* and ΔGOOH* on the TM active sites. As shown in Fig. 3c, both ΔGO* and ΔGOOH* are linearly related to ΔGOH* with high linearity (R2 = 0.95 and 0.90, respectively). Thus, ΔGOH* can be chosen as a descriptor to predict the overall OER performance of the studied PcTM-O8-TM′. Meanwhile, the overpotentials (η) of the OER can also be expressed as a function of ΔGOH* to describe the catalytic performance, and a volcano curve was obtained (Fig. 3f). PcCo-O8-Rh-B is at the peak of the volcano with the lowest η value of 0.25 V, suggesting it shows the best OER catalytic activity in this study. In contrast, PcCo-O8-Cu-B and PcCu-O8-Co-A are located at the bottom of the volcano, indicating their poor OER catalytic performance. The dependence of OER catalytic activity on the binding strength of intermediates provides a possibility of tuning the catalytic performance of water splitting using an external field, such as strain, as discussed below.
Besides the OER, another half reaction for water splitting is the HER for hydrogen production. The Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of the HER in PcTM-O8-TM′ will be calculated to indicate the catalytic performance, as shown in Fig. 3d and e. Generally, the HER catalytic activity depends on the adsorption strength of H atoms on the catalytic site, and it is optimal to have ΔGH* close to zero for an HER catalyst. As shown in Table 1, most of the designed PcTM-O8-TM′ exhibit sluggish HER kinetics, except PcCo-O8-Ir-B, PcIr-O8-Co-A, PcCo-O8-Rh-B and PcRh-O8-Co-A with ΔGH* < 0.20 eV. The theoretical HER overpotential ηHER can be evaluated based on the ΔGH* of these PcTM-O8-TM′ (see Fig. 3f). The volcano plot depicts PcTM-O8-TM′ on the right-hand side with weak interactions while those on the left-hand side have strong adsorption with the H atom. PcCo-O8-Ir-A is identified as having the best HER activity, with a ΔGH* of −0.18 eV. PcCo-O8-Rh-B exhibits the second-best HER performance with a ΔGH* of −0.19 eV, and great OER catalytic activity with ηOER = 0.25 V. Thus, PcCo-O8-Rh-B can serve as a bifunctional HER/OER catalyst for overall water splitting.
To demonstrate HER/OER bifunctional activities, we established the relationship between two descriptors ΔGOH* and ΔGH*, which effectively determined the bifunctional catalytic activity for overall water splitting. As shown in Fig. 4a, a good linear relationship is present between ΔGOH* and ΔGH* with R2 = 0.92. This is attributed to the related absorption strength between intermediates (H* and OH*) and active sites. In addition to the relationship between ΔGH* and ΔGOH*, the bifunctional HER/OER selectivity of designed PcTM-O8-TM′ can also be evaluated by the overpotential. The overpotential allows us to select bifunctional PcTM-O8-TM′ for overall water splitting. Fig. 4b clearly shows that PcCo-O8-Rh-B and PcCo-O8-Ir-A are close to the bottom of the left-hand side, which means they can serve as HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts with lower ηHER/ηOER of −0.25/0.35, and −0.19/0.25 V, respectively. Compared with previous theoretical calculations, the HER/OER overpotentials are close to or better than the values of well-known HER/OER bifunctional catalysts.70–72 Thus, PcCo-O8-Rh-B and PcCo-O8-Ir-A are selected as the most promising catalysts for overall water splitting.

3.3 Relationship between electronic structure and catalytic performance
To understand the different catalytic behaviours of designed PcTM-O8-TM′ for the HER and OER, we studied the electronic structures of the catalysts, especially the density of state contributions near the Fermi level from the transition metals as the catalytic sites. From the projected DOS (PDOS) analysis (see Fig. 5) of the TM atom, it is found that the d-band centre (εd) of the Cu atom is located at a significantly deeper energy level than those of other TM atoms (TM = Co, Rh or Ir), which indicates this active site has higher d-electron occupation, leading to weaker interaction with intermediates.72 In contrast, the εd of other TM atoms are closer to the Fermi level with more empty d-states; it thus has stronger interactions with intermediates.72 The linear relationship between ΔGH* and ΔGOH* in Fig. 4c clearly shows that εd is located in a deeper energy level from the Fermi level, which is closely related to the weaker bond interaction between the TM active site and intermediates (H and OH). According to the Sabatier principle, the binding strength between the reaction intermediate and the catalyst will favour relatively low overpotentials when the εd lies in the middle range.72,73 Taking the best and worst HER/OER catalysts in this work as examples, PcCo-O8-Rh-B exhibits the best HER/OER activity (ΔGH*/OH* = −0.19/1.48 eV) with a calculated εd of −1.16 eV, which is located within a moderate range. In contrast, the εd of PcCu-O8-Co-A is −2.90 eV which is at a deeper energy level, leading to the weakest HER/OER performance (ΔGH*/OH* = 2.13/2.92 eV). These results show that the εd of the catalytic site is the main parameter affecting HER/OER activity, which is consistent with previous theoretical studies.72,73
 Fig. 5  PDOS for the d-orbitals of the TM atoms at PcTM-O8-TM′. The black, red, and blue vertical lines represent the positions of the Fermi level and εd in the A site and B site, respectively. 
The conclusion can also be intuitively supported by partial charge density (PCD) analysis (see Fig. 6). The colour in Fig. 6 denotes the charge density values, with a value of 1.0 (red) representing the highest charge density, while a value of 0 (blue) means the lowest charge density. One can see that the charge densities in the A and B sites are remarkably different and, depending on the TM atoms, the charge distributions are also different at the N and O atoms bonding to the central TM atom. The charge density at the TM atoms, which is conducive to fast electron transfer between intermediates and active sites, follows the order of Cu > Co > Rh > Ir. When comparing the results from Fig. 5 and 6, one can see that, if the TM active site has a high charge density, the εd will be far from the Fermi level. In contrast, the εd will be close to the Fermi level when there is less charge density at the TM site. Therefore, the high (less) charge density led to the increased (decreased) d-electron occupation, and weaker (higher) catalytic activity. For example, the TM atom of PcCo-O8-Rh-B has medium charge density, its εd is in the middle range, and it exhibits optimal HER/OER performance. The result not only confirms that εd is the key descriptor for evaluating the HER/OER performance of PcTM-O8-TM′ catalysts but it also demonstrates that the catalytic activity can be manipulated using the εd of TM atoms.

To gain insight into the possible synergistic effect of A and B sites on the catalytic performance of PcTM-O8-TM′, we evaluated the OER/HER performance of the B site in the presence of absorbed H atoms on the A site. PcCo-O8-Rh was chosen as an example because it exhibited the best OER/HER performance among the studied MOFs. Our findings reveal that the OER/HER performance of the B site is slightly changed (at the level of 0.02 eV) due to the synergistic effect with the A site (see Table S4†), due to partial electron transfer from Rh to Co atoms when the Co atom absorbs H atoms. As a result, the d-electron occupation of the Rh atom decreases slightly, leading to a small variation in the OER/HER catalytic activity of the Rh atom. However, this synergistic effect was negligible in this study due to the large distance between TM and TM′ atoms; it was therefore not considered in our work.
3.4 HER/OER activity on PcCo-O8-Rh under the tensile strain
As the key descriptor for HER/OER catalytic activity on PcTM-O8-TM′, εd should be modulated to tune the HER/OER performance. In the following, we applied tensile strain to the 2D c-MOF materials to monitor the variation in water-splitting activity. Here, the tensile strain is applied in the range of 0 to 3%. The calculated ΔG values of HER/OER intermediates under tensile strain are listed in Tables 2 and S2,† and the values of potential-determining steps for the OER are shown in Table S3.† It is found that ΔGH* and ΔGOH* are remarkably affected by tensile strain. With an increase in tensile strain from 0 to 3%, ΔGH* (ΔGOH*) values at the A site increased from 0.3 to 0.38 eV (0.44 to 0.51 eV) while decreasing (increasing) from −0.19 to −0.14 eV (0.34 to 0.41 eV) at the B site (Fig. 7a). Such variation indicates that the interaction between TM (TM = Co, Rh) and HER/OER intermediates can be effectively controlled by the applied tensile strain.

To gain insights into the mechanism underlying the variations in ΔGH* and ΔGOH* manipulated by tensile strain, we examined the εd and charge density of PcCo-O8-Rh. Fig. 7b indicates that Co (Rh) atoms donate fewer electrons to surrounding atoms as the tensile strain increases from 0 to 3%, which leads to Co and Rh atoms retaining high charge density. This transformation can be attributed to the increasing distance between TMs and surrounding atoms under tensile strain. The bond length between Co (Rh) and N (O) atoms is increased from ∼1.90 (∼1.97) to ∼1.95 (∼2.04) Å. In addition, the εd of Co and Rh atoms at PcCo-O8-Rh increases linearly (Fig. 7c). This means that εd is shifted to a deeper energy level by strain, causing a significant variation in electron transfer and thus the variation in the adsorption energies. This result is in good agreement with the calculated data in Table S5,† which not only reaffirms that εd is the key descriptor for an HER/OER bifunctional catalyst but also provides a feasible approach to tune the interaction between the adsorbate and catalyst.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we proposed from first-principles calculations that 2D c-MOFs are good electrocatalysts with dual transition metals for overall water splitting. All designed PcTM-O8-TM′ are stable and have high electronic conductivity according to an examination of their structural and electronic properties. It is found that the TM atoms are the active sites for overall water splitting, and the catalytic activities of PcTM-O8-TM′ depend on the choice of TM atoms. PcCo-O8-Rh-B shows the highest overall water splitting catalytic activities (ηHER/ηOER = −0.19/0.25 V). Since the catalytic activity of PcTM-O8-TM′ can be effectively manipulated by regulating the d-band centre of TM atoms, we propose to tune the HER/OER performance of PcCo-O8-Rh by tensile strain. These results reveal new insights into the structure–activity relationship between dual metal sites and their electrocatalytic activities, which would inspire experimental investigations to further explore more 2D c-MOFs electrocatalysts for different chemical reactions.
