    , Accepted 15th December 2016First published on 16th December 2016AbstractA series of Yb3+–Er3+ codoped α-NaLuF4 nanoparticles were prepared via a hydrothermal process. Enhanced red upconversion (UC) luminescence can be achieved by adjusting the initial solution pH, and the intensity of red emission (660 nm) is enhanced 23 times. By establishing rate equations, a theoretical model about the red UC mechanism is presented. It is proposed that the highly efficient red UC emission is mainly due to the UC process from the saturated 4I13/2 (Er3+) state, which is induced by the effective energy-back-transfer process (primary): 4S3/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and the cross-relaxation effect among Er3+ (minor): 4S3/2 + 4I15/2 → 4I9/2 + 4I13/2 at a high pH value of the initial solution. Moreover, the influence of solution pH on the red UC luminescence is systematically studied under different hydrothermal conditions. This paper provides an effective route to obtain nanoparticles with bright red UC luminescence, which may be suitable for biological imaging and display devices.
1. Introduction
Upconversion (UC) is an anti-Stokes process in which low energy irradiation can be converted to high energy emissions.1 To date, lanthanide (Ln) doped fluoride nanoparticles, which can emit visible light under near-infrared (NIR) excitation based on an UC process, have evoked great research interest due to their potential applications in biological imaging, solar energy conversion, lasers and so on.2–8 Compared to conventional luminescent materials, Ln doped fluoride nanomaterials offer multiple advantages such as low toxicity, high sensitivity and spatial resolution,9–11 which make them more suitable for use in the photoluminescence imaging technique. As one of the most important fluorides, NaLuF4 has been regarded as an excellent host matrix for UC emission because of its low phonon energy and high thermal stability.12–15 Relative to short wavelength light below 600 nm, red light (600–700 nm) and NIR radiation (700–1100 nm) are known as the “optical window” of biological tissues, where the tissue cannot effectively absorb.2,16 Thus, as for Ln doped UC nanomaterials, the 980 nm excitation wavelength is within the biological transmission window, which can induce deep penetration and cut down tissue damage.17,18 However, UC nanomaterials usually display multipeak emissions.19 Consequently, tuning the emission peaks into the “optical window” is requisite for their biological application. Avoiding the short wavelength (blue and green) emissions and improving the long wavelength (red) emission is an effective strategy to achieve intense red UC emission. For example, Zhao et al. reported Mn2+ doped NaYF4:Yb/Er UC nanoparticles and obtained enhanced red UC luminescence.2 Liu's group demonstrated the single-band red UC emission in KMnF3:Yb/Er and KMnF3:Yb/Ho nanocrystals, due to the energy transfer between dopant ions and Mn2+.19 However, the practical application of UC nanomaterials is still restricted owing to their low UC luminescence efficiency, and an effective route to improve the red UC emission is imperative. As is known, the UC efficiency of Ln doped materials strongly depends on the local crystal field symmetry around Ln ions and the distance between dopants.20,21 When the local symmetry decreases, the probability of intra-4f electronic transition will increase, resulting in the enhancement of UC emission. Yin's group reported a 6 and 8 times increase of green and red UC luminescence in Mo3+ doped NaYF4:Yb/Er nanocrystals, due to the breaking of the local crystal field symmetry around Er3+ after Mo3+ doping.22 Besides, when the distance between dopant ions reduces, the energy transfer efficiency between Ln ions will increase, leading to the enhancement of UC efficiency. Tan et al. reported NaYbF4 nanoparticles with pure red UC emission, which was caused by the enhancement of the cross-relaxation (CR) effect because the average distance between Er3+ was reduced with the increase of Er3+ dopant dose.23 It is well known that the pH value of the initial reaction solution can greatly influence the phase, particle size and surface morphology of the final products,18,24–26 leading to a change in the UC luminescence intensity. Ye's group demonstrated the tunable UC luminescence in Yb3+–Er3+ codoped LiYF4/YF3 nanoparticles at different pH values of the mother solution.18 Wang et al. reported the improvement of UC emissions in LiYF4:Yb/Er microphosphors via pH tuning.20 However, most of the research is about the increase of multipeak emissions, and there is no report on the achievement of intense red UC emission (high purity) in α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals through manipulation of the initial solution pH, which can affect the structure of the samples. Besides, the theoretical model about the enhanced red UC emission (under pH tuning) in an Yb3+/Er3+ codoped system is needed.
In this paper, a series of Yb3+–Er3+ codoped α-NaLuF4 nanoparticles were prepared via a hydrothermal process, and bright red UC luminescence (high purity) can be observed by manipulating the pH value of the initial reaction solution. Based on the rate equations, a possible mechanism for the enhanced red UC emission is proposed. Moreover, the effect of mother solution pH on the increase of red UC luminescence is systematically investigated under different hydrothermal reaction times and temperatures.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All of the chemicals are of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. 1 M Lu(NO3)3, 0.5 M Yb(NO3)3, and 0.1 M Er(NO3)3 stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the corresponding Ln oxide (99.99%) in dilute nitric acid (30%) at elevated temperature.
2.2 Synthesis of α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals
α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals were synthesized based on our previously reported procedures.27,28 The pH value from 3.7 to 5.1 was adjusted by adding different amounts of NaOH in the mother liquid. In a typical procedure, 0.78 mmol of Lu(NO3)3 (1 M, 0.78 mL), 0.2 mmol of Yb(NO3)3 (0.5 M, 0.4 mL) and 0.02 mmol of Er(NO3)3 (0.1 M, 0.2 mL) were added to a mixture containing 3 mmol of citric acid (2 M, 1.5 mL), (0 mmol/1 mmol/3 mmol/5 mmol) of NaOH (4 M, 0 mL/0.25 mL/0.75 mL/1.25 mL) and 10 mL of deionized water. The solution was then stirred for 30 min to form a Ln–Cit3− complex. Subsequently, an aqueous solution containing 5 mmol of NaF (1 M, 5 mL) and (12 mL/12 mL/11.5 mL/11 mL) of deionized water was added to the chelated Ln–Cit3− complex to form a colloidal suspension and kept stirring for another 30 min. Finally, the suspension was transferred to a 50 ml Teflon vessel, sealed in an autoclave and maintained at 200 °C for 12 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the final products were separated by centrifugation, washed with ethanol and deionized water several times, and then dried in air at 60 °C overnight. Other samples with mother solution pH values of 3.7 (NaOH = 0 mmol) and 5.1 (NaOH = 5 mmol) were prepared by a similar process only by tuning the reaction time and temperature.
2.3 Characterization
The phase and morphology of the products were characterized using a Rigaku D-Max 2200VPC X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and an Oxford Quanta 400F Thermal Field Emission environmental scanning electronic microscope (SEM), respectively. UC photoluminescence spectra and luminescence lifetime measurements were carried out on an Edinburgh Instrument Company FLS980 combined fluorescence lifetime and steady-state fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a 1 W 980 nm laser diode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase and morphology

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Yb3+–Er3+ codoped α-NaLuF4 nanoparticles at different pH values of the initial reaction solutions. As can be seen, all diffraction peaks of the samples can be easily indexed as pure α-NaLuF4 (file number 27-0725) when the solution pH value increases from 3.7 to 5.1. No extra peaks can be detected, which demonstrates that the increasing the solution pH has no influence on the crystal structure of α-NaLuF4 nanocrystals. Correspondingly, the SEM images of Fig. 2(a–c) show that the prepared samples are composed of a large amount of small cubic nanospheres at the pH values of 3.7, 4.0 and 4.6. Their corresponding average diameters are 108 nm, 104 nm, and 46 nm, respectively. As the pH value of the precursor solution further increases to 5.1, a great deal of irregular polyhedral nanoparticles with an average size of 85 nm can be observed as shown in Fig. 2d. The above analysis reveals that the variation of the initial solution pH has an effect on the size and morphology of the samples. As is known, the solubility of F− will decrease with the increasing pH value.20 Thus, when the pH value increases from 3.7 to 4.6, the number of F− capped on the crystal surface reduces, which would weaken the growth of the crystals, leading to a decrease in the diameter of the nanospheres. When the pH value further increases to 5.1, the supersaturation level of F− further increases due to the further decrease of F− solubility, which would cause a competition between Cit3−, OH− and F− to adsorb the crystal surface.20 It is well known that α-NaLuF4 has a highly isotropic structure. The competition between Cit3−, OH− and F− would result in the absence of the isotropic growth of the nanospheres, consequently forming the α-NaLuF4 nanoparticles with irregular shape. A similar phenomenon can be observed in a previous report.20

3.2 Luminescence properties and mechanism

Fig. 3 shows the UC luminescence spectra of α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ nanoparticles at different pH values of precursor solutions under 980 nm excitation at room temperature. As can be seen, two distinct emission bands are observed in the range of 500–700 nm. Green and red emissions centered at 520/540 nm and 660 nm are attributed to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. Obviously, the intensity of red emission is much higher than that of green emission. Red UC emission is greatly enhanced with increasing pH value. The highest intensity of 660 nm emission is obtained in the sample with a mother solution pH value of 5.1, which is 23 times higher than that of 3.7. The red-to-green (R/G) ratio is increased to 35 when the pH value increases to 5.1, indicating the achievement of high-purity red UC luminescence. Fig. 4 displays the pump power dependence of (a) green and (b) red UC emissions in α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ nanoparticles at different pH values of initial solutions under 980 nm excitation, and (c) the relationship between the pH and the slopes of green and red emissions. It is well accepted that I ∝ Pn, where I denotes the output UC luminescence intensity, P denotes the NIR excitation power, n denotes the number of NIR photons being absorbed when emitting an UC photon.29,30 As shown in Fig. 4, with the increase of pH values, the slope of green emission decreases from 0.74, 0.72, 0.67 to 0.51, and that of red emission decreases from 0.86, 0.70, 0.61 to 0.46. Thus, it can be concluded that both green and red emissions undergo a one-photon process even when the pH value increases to 5.1.

Normally a crystal with large size may have higher UC luminescence intensity than a small one because of fewer surface quenching sites.31 From the section of “Phase and morphology”, it is found that the average size of the sample at pH = 4.6 is much smaller than those at pH = 3.7 and 4.0, while it (pH = 4.6) has the stronger red UC emission intensity. Consequently, the effect of particle size on the enhancement of red UC emission can be neglected in our case. The main reason for the increase of red UC luminescence maybe comes from the variation of the energy transfer (ET) mechanism with increasing solution pH. The lattice constants and unit-cell volumes are calculated according to the XRD results, as shown in Table 1. It can be clearly seen that the lattice constants and unit-cell volumes are reduced with the increase of solution pH values. The decreasing lattice constant would result in the decrease of the average distance between Ln3+ ions. As is known, the reduced average distance between Yb3+ and Er3+ may cause an increase of the energy-back-transfer (EBT) process;32 the reduced average distance among Er3+ may lead to the enhanced CR effect among Er3+.23

In this paper, we built a theoretical model to demonstrate the proposed ET mechanism of green and red UC emissions in α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ nanoparticles at different mother solution pH values. We supposed 4F7/2, 2H11/2, and 4S3/2 energy levels as the same level. For the system at a low pH value of the precursor solution, both the EBT process and the CR effect can be neglected. Linear decay (LD) is considered as the dominant depletion for the 4I13/2 level. The corresponding rate equations are as follows:  N0, N1, N2, N3, N4, NYb0 and NYb1 denote the population densities of the Er3+ 4I15/2, 4I13/2, 4I11/2, 4F9/2, 4S3/2/2H11/2/4F7/2, Yb3+ 2F7/2 and 2F5/2 levels, respectively. ω0, ω1, and ω2 denote the ET rates of 2F5/2 + 4I15/2 → 2F7/2 + 4I11/2 (ET1), 2F5/2 + 4I11/2 → 2F7/2 + 4F7/2 (ET2), and 2F5/2 + 4I13/2 → 2F7/2 + 4F9/2 (ET3), respectively. ω21 and ω43 are multiphonon relaxation (MPR) rates from Er3+: 4I11/2 → 4I13/2 and 4F7/2 → 4F9/2, respectively. A1, A3, and A4 denote the radiative rates of Er3+ 4I13/2, 4F9/2, and 4S3/2/2H11/2 levels, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 5, the 4F7/2 manifold of Er3+ is populated by the ET1 + ET2 processes. Subsequently, green and red emissions of 520/540 nm and 660 nm are produced via the MPR processes of Er3+: 4F7/2 → 4S3/2/2H11/2 and 4F7/2 → 4F9/2 manifolds, respectively. Under steady-state conditions, the rate equations can be obtained as follows:ω21N2 − A1N1 = 0ω0NYb1N0 − ω21N2 − ω1NYb1N2 = 0ω43N4 − A3N3 = 0ω1NYb1N2 − ω43N4 − A4N4 = 0The population density of the Yb3+ excited state can be described as follows:32  where σ denotes the absorption cross-section of Yb3+ 2F5/2 manifold, ρ denotes the pump rate of the NIR laser. At steady-state excitation, we have  By solving the above equations, we get (1) (2) (3)It can be seen from eqn (1) and (2), both the red-emitting level of N3 and the green-emitting level of N4 have linear relationships with pump power at a low pH value of the precursor solution, which are in accordance with the results shown in Fig. 4.

For the system at a high pH value of the precursor solution, the lattice constants reduce and intense red UC luminescence (high purity) can be obtained. The reduced lattice constant (or the reduced average distance between Yb3+ and Er3+) may result in the enhancement of the EBT process: 4S3/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+). Besides, the reduced lattice constant (or the reduced average distance between Er3+) may lead to the increase of the CR effect among Er3+ (even there is only 2%Er3+ doping). There are generally three CR processes between Er3+ that account for the enhancement of red UC emission,32,33 and the three CR processes are as follows: first, 4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2;34 second, 4S3/2 + 4I13/2 → 4F9/2 + 4I11/2;35 third, 4S3/2 + 4I15/2 → 4I9/2 + 4I13/2.36 Here, the third CR effect (4S3/2 + 4I15/2 → 4I9/2 + 4I13/2) is considered as the main CR effect in our system, due to the Er3+ 4I13/2 manifold which can be populated by this process. The MPR processes of Er3+: 4I11/2 → 4I13/2 and 4F7/2 → 4F9/2 can be ignored. Consequently, the population of the Er3+ 4I13/2 manifold mainly originates from the EBT process (primary): 4S3/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and the CR effect among Er3+ (minor): 4S3/2 + 4I15/2 → 4I9/2 + 4I13/2, as shown in Fig. 6. The EBT process is primary, and the CR effect among Er3+ is minor since there is only 2%Er3+ doping. The red-emitting manifold of 4F9/2 is populated mainly by the UC process (ET3): 2F5/2 (Yb3+) + 4I13/2 (Er3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 4F9/2 (Er3+). Besides, the reduced average distance between Yb3+ and Er3+ favors the UC process of ET3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that UC is the primary depletion for the 4I13/2 manifold at a high pH value of the initial solution. The corresponding rate equations are as follows:  where ωC denotes the CR rate of Er3+: 4S3/2 + 4I15/2 → 4I9/2 + 4I13/2, and ωb denotes the EBT rate of 4S3/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+). By solving the equations under steady-state conditions, we get (4) (5) (6)As can be seen from eqn (4) and (5), N3 and N4 also have linear relationships with pump power, which are in good agreement with the experimental results shown in Fig. 4. The power dependence of the R/G ratio for α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ nanoparticles at different pH values of initial solutions is displayed in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the R/G ratio is almost unchanged in all samples with increasing pump power. As shown in eqn (3) and (6), N3/N4 ∝ ρ0, which coincides with the result shown in Fig. 7. Furthermore, Fig. 8a shows that the slope of Er3+ 4I13/2 NIR emission in the sample at pH = 5.1 (slope = 0.74) is lower than that at pH = 3.7 (slope = 1.20). The decreasing slope of Er3+ 4I13/2 NIR emission can be attributed to the saturation of the Er3+ 4I13/2 state, which is induced by the increasing EBT process (primary): 4S3/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and the CR effect among Er3+ (minor): 4S3/2 + 4I15/2 → 4I9/2 + 4I13/2. A similar explanation can be found in the previous report.37Fig. 9 exhibits the decay curves of (a) 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 and (b) 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ in α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ nanoparticles at pH = 3.7 and 5.1. According to the function: , where I(t) denotes the emission intensity at time t, and Imax denotes the peak intensity in the decay curve. The luminescence lifetimes of 4I13/2 and 4F9/2 states of Er3+ are calculated, and the results show that τ (4I13/2, pH = 3.7) = 0.80 ms, τ (4I13/2, pH = 5.1) = 1.98 ms, τ (4F9/2, pH = 3.7) = 0.22 ms, and τ (4F9/2, pH = 5.1) = 0.29 ms. It is well known that the inverse of the lifetime is equal to the sum (Ir+nr = Ir + Inr) of radiative (Ir) and nonradiative (Inr) transitions.28 Thus, as for the 4I13/2 state of Er3+, the increasing lifetime implies the decreasing Ir+nr (4I13/2). Fig. 8b shows that the Er3+ 4I13/2 NIR emission intensity of the sample at pH = 5.1 is lower than that at pH = 3.7. Consequently, the decreasing Ir+nr (4I13/2) is attributed to the decreasing Ir (4I13/2) (or the decreasing Er3+ 4I13/2 NIR emission intensity). On the basis of the above results, it is reasonable to consider that Inr (4I13/2) is increased [we suppose the increase magnitude of Inr (4I13/2) is lower than the decrease magnitude of Ir (4I13/2)], which is in accordance with the above theoretical model. The increasing Inr (4I13/2) indicates the increasing UC process (ET3) with the increase of the pH value. As for the 4F9/2 state of Er3+, the increasing lifetime implies the decreasing Ir+nr (4F9/2). From Fig. 3, it can be seen that the red UC emission intensity [Ir (4F9/2)] is significantly increased. Thus, the Inr (4F9/2) must be drastically decreased [the decrease magnitude of Inr (4F9/2) must be higher than the increase magnitude of Ir (4F9/2)], indicating that radiative transition is the dominant depletion for the Er3+ 4F9/2 manifold, which is in good agreement with the above theoretical model. In addition, the large R/G ratio at a high pH value of the precursor solution (Fig. 3 and 7) could be explained by the effective EBT process (primary): 4S3/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and the CR effect among Er3+ (minor): 4S3/2 + 4I15/2 → 4I9/2 + 4I13/2. The reduced average distance between Yb3+ and Er3+ favors the UC process of ET2, and the increasing UC processes of ET2 and ET3 lead to the decreasing slopes of green and red emissions (Fig. 4c).

From the above analysis, it can be seen that our theoretical model is appropriate, and the intense red UC emission is mainly due to the UC process (ET3) from the saturated 4I13/2 (Er3+) state, which is induced by the effective EBT process (primary): 4S3/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and the CR effect among Er3+ (minor): 4S3/2 + 4I15/2 → 4I9/2 + 4I13/2 at a high pH value of the initial solution. Besides, the reduced lattice constant would result in the decrease of the local crystal field symmetry. The lower local symmetry around Er3+ might contribute to the increasing red UC luminescence. Moreover, with the increase of the pH value, the quality of crystallization is enhanced, which would cause the enhancement of red UC emission intensity.

Fig. 10 presents the UC luminescence photographs of α-NaLuF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ nanoparticles at different pH values of precursor solutions under 980 nm excitation. As can be seen, the red UC luminescence is greatly enhanced with the increasing pH value, and the changes in fluorescence intensity can be easily observed by the naked eye. The highest red UC emission intensity is observed in the sample with a precursor solution pH value of 5.1.

The above samples are synthesized at 200 °C for 12 h, and the red UC emission intensity in the sample at pH 5.1 is enhanced 23 times relative to that at pH 3.7. In order to study the effect of initial solution pH values on the increase of red UC luminescence under different hydrothermal conditions, a series of α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles with initial solution pH values of 3.7 and 5.1 are synthesized at different reaction times and temperatures. The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 11. As can be seen from Fig. 11(a and b), all diffraction peaks of the samples can be indexed as pure α-NaLuF4 (file number 27-0725), indicating that α-NaLuF4 nanoparticles can still be obtained, even synthesized, at 200 °C for 18 h. Fig. 12 displays the corresponding UC emission spectra of the samples under 980 nm excitation. Obviously, the red emission in the sample with pH 5.1 is still much stronger than that with pH 3.7 under different hydrothermal conditions. From Fig. 12(a and b), it can be clearly seen that the increase magnitude of red emission in the sample synthesized at 180 °C for 12 h is larger than that at 150 °C for 12 h. Fig. 12(c and d) shows that the enhancement magnitude in the sample prepared at 200 °C for 18 h is higher than that at 200 °C for 6 h. The increase magnitude of red UC emission in the samples (pH = 3.7 and 5.1) prepared under different hydrothermal conditions is summarized in Table 2. It can be concluded that the increase magnitude of red emission becomes larger at a higher reaction temperature or a longer reaction time.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we report the enhanced red UC luminescence in α-NaLuF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals through manipulation of the initial solution pH. Red UC emission (660 nm) is greatly enhanced with increasing pH values, and the intensity of the red emission in the sample with an initial solution pH value of 5.1 is enhanced 23 times relative to that of 3.7 (synthesized at 200 °C for 12 h). Based on the rate equations, a theoretical model for the enhanced red UC emission is presented. It is proposed that the bright red UC luminescence is mainly due to the UC process from the saturated 4I13/2 (Er3+) state, which is induced by the effective EBT process (primary): 4S3/2 (Er3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 4I13/2 (Er3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+) and the CR effect among Er3+ (minor): 4S3/2 + 4I15/2 → 4I9/2 + 4I13/2 at a high pH value of the initial solution. Furthermore, the effect of mother solution pH on the increase of red UC luminescence is systematically investigated under different hydrothermal conditions. It is found that the red emission in the sample with pH 5.1 is still much stronger than that with pH 3.7 under different hydrothermal conditions, and the increase magnitude of red emission becomes larger at a higher reaction temperature or a longer reaction time. As a result of their intense red UC luminescence, these phosphors may be suitable for biological imaging and display devices.
