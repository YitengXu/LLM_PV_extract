As a reagent in photochemical synthesis, light is obviously critical for reactivity but rarely optimized other than in light/dark controls. This Frontier Article presents an overview of recent research that investigates the unique ways light may be manipulated, and its unusual interactions with homogeneous transition metal and organic photocatalysts.Timothy U. ConnellTim Connell completed his PhD at the University of Melbourne (2015) before postdoctoral positions at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (2015) and RMIT University (2017). He was awarded a Fulbright Future Scholarship to undertake research at Carnegie Mellon University (2019) and began his independent career at Deakin University (2021) supported by an Australian Research Council DECRA fellowship for ECRs. His research into the mechanism of homogenous photocatalysis (the conversion of visible light into chemical energy) is underpinned by the fundamental synthetic coordination chemistry of transition metal complexes that interact with light in unique ways.
Introduction
Photoredox catalysis has dramatically diversified the chemical reactivity available to synthetic chemists, supplanting high temperatures and harsh reagents with visible light.1–6 The catalysts that power these reactions, typically transition metal complexes or organic dyes, absorb photons to generate excited states that serve as potent single electron oxidants or reductants.7 The conventional catalytic cycle is broken into three elementary steps: (1) photon absorption generating an excited state, (2) photoinitiated electron transfer (PET) with a substrate or sacrificial additive and (3) a second ‘dark’ (or light-independent) electron transfer returning the catalyst to the ground state. Many common photocatalysts also populate triplet excited states that can facilitate triplet–triplet energy transfer with organic substrates.8,9 Light is unsurprisingly intrinsic to this reactivity, yet it is a reagent often taken for granted. Experimental irradiation conditions (e.g. energy or wavelength (λ) and power (W m−2)) are often sparing or inaccurate; these important parameters are included throughout this review when available in the original work. There is a clear need for better reporting and standardized light sources of fixed power to facilitate comparison across the research community.10–12 Quantified light sources are particularly important for measuring reaction efficiency using actinometry; the photochemical quantum yield (Φ) represents the likelihood of product formation per absorbed photon.13
In contrast, this review instead focuses on the unusual ways light can be manipulated as a reagent, and how doing so alters the photochemical outcome. Modifying light as an external power input can provide additional energy to a photocatalytic system, promoting significant recent interest; most examples highlighted here are less than five years old. Comparing the effectiveness of different irradiation approaches requires robust model reactions and several feature repeatedly. The reduction of aryl halides benefits from cheap and widely available substrates with readily tuned reduction potentials (via substitution of the aromatic ring), and affords versatile radical intermediates capable of hydrodehalogenation or numerous C–C and C–X linkages. Other prominent reaction models include oxidation chemistry (including boronic acid and benzyl amine substrates) and sensitising singlet oxygen (1O2). Given this review's focus on irradiation, and the prevalence of so few model reactions, synthetic conditions other than reagents and reaction yield are not provided in the text or figures. The selection of sacrificial electron donors or acceptors requires careful selection; there are increasing reports of non-innocent radical intermediates in photoredox reactions.14–21 Conversely, temperature can be inaccurately reported; LED light sources generate ambient heat that may not be monitored or considered.
Many of the following examples require two or more photons to afford one equivalent of product. These multiphoton pathways extend a photocatalyst's available chemical energy beyond a conventional monophotonic mechanism. In one approach invoked in many synthetic transformations, the photocatalyst (typically organic dyes such as perylene diimide, anthracene and rhodamine derivatives) undergoes two consecutive PET steps (conPET, Fig. 1a).20,22–26 Consecutive photon absorption, by either a long-lived catalyst excited state or a redox-active intermediate, may also fully expel an electron from the orbital shell (Fig. 1b). The resulting solvated electrons are potent reductants (E° = −3.1 V vs. SCE) and typically formed using transition metal catalysts such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and sulfonated [Ir(sppy)3]3− in aqueous reaction mixtures.27–31 Additional reactivity may finally occur following photocatalyst transformation, despite the common belief that chemical alteration poisons catalysis. Cationic iridium(III) photocatalysts are known to transform, characterised by a partially saturated bipyridine-like ancillary ligand, when irradiated in the presence of a sacrificial trialkylamine quencher.32 The transformed complex can engage energy demanding substrates via a tandem multiphoton cycle (Fig. 1c),33,34 reliant on both the original and transformed complex absorbing photons to achieve product formation. Despite the considerable overlap between controlling photon delivery and multiphoton photoredox, this review does not discuss the mechanisms of these systems other than this short overview. For those interested in this emerging research area, it has recently received extensive coverage in several good reviews.35,36

Multichromatic irradiation
At the simplest level, irradiation wavelength is tied to photochemical quantum yield, similar to the incident photon to converted electron ratio of solar cell devices.37 More absorbed photons produce more photocatalyst excited states, which matches the cross section between catalyst absorption and irradiated light. This relationship is often ignored when developing new synthetic methodology; testing several catalysts against a single light source is common, as are ‘white’ compact fluorescent lamps, even though single-colour LEDs result in higher yields.38 But a small handful of examples demonstrate how broadband irradiation may promote reactions with higher energy demands. The organic photocatalyst 9,10-dicyanoanthracene is a moderate photooxidant that absorbs blue light (λmax = ∼420 nm), however the long-lived reduced radical anion (τ = 5 ns) formed following initial PET can consecutively absorb an additional lower energy photon (λmax = ∼500 nm). This accesses a second excited state that can react with challenging aryl bromide and chloride electrophiles (E° ≈ −2.5 V vs. SCE, Fig. 2a).39 Control experiments using blue or green light (λ = 455 and 525 nm, respectively, power not reported) alone yielded minimal product (<4%), but aryl halide reduction and subsequent radical trapping with N-methylpyrrole was possible using broadband white light (λ = 410–700 nm, 8.5 W) that overlapped enough with the absorption bands of both species.

Wavelength-exact irradiation sources are included in the text. 
Changing irradiation energy may result in different synthetic products. So called chromoselectivity was first reported using the organic dye Rhodamine 6G; irradiation with green light (λ = 530 nm, power not reported) promotes a typical reductive quenching pathway capable of reducing 1,3,5-tribromobenzene to yield a monosubstituted product (the initial radical was trapped with N-methylpyrrole, Fig. 2b).40 Irradiating the reaction with higher energy blue light (λ = 450 nm, ∼2.5 W) unlocks a conPET pathway to access the reduced intermediate excited state (E°[PC°/*˙−] = −2.4 V vs. SCE, where PC = photocatalyst) and afford the disubstituted product. Changing between ultraviolet (λ = 365 nm, ∼8 W m−2) and blue light (λ = 420 nm, ∼18 W m−2) stereoselectively yields either the Z- or E-isomer, respectively, in the photocatalytic allylation of alcohols and amines.41 The same oxidative quenching cycle occurs with either light source, but higher energy irradiation facilitates substrate isomerisation via triplet energy transfer. More recently, chromoselective irradiation of a heterogeneous carbon nitride catalyst facilitated the stereoselective enzyme-driven oxidation of ethylbenzene.42 Altering the irradiation energy (λ = 440 or 525 nm, power not reported) was proposed to elicit different n–π* or π–π* transitions, therefore providing an energy differential. This approach is only possible using heterogenous photocatalysts, as molecular species will rapidly decay to the lowest lying excited state.
A surprising discovery is that multichromatic irradiation can facilitate the turnover of photocatalyst intermediates to the ground state, a catalytic step commonly thought to be light-independent. The common organic dye Eosin Y (EY) generates an oxidising photoexcited state (E°[EY2−*/˙3−] = 0.83 V vs. SCE) when irradiated with green light (λ = 530 nm, ∼300 W m−2). Following electron transfer, the EY˙3− intermediate is susceptible to inactivation via protonation and further reduction to EY-H22− (Fig. 2c).43 Simultaneous irradiation with higher energy violet light (λ = 405 nm, ∼0.2–0.7 W cm−2) suppresses this unwanted side reaction. The high energy photons are preferentially absorbed by the EY˙3− intermediate to facilitate the desired electron transfer and catalyst turnover. This work highlights how reaction intermediates formed following the initial PET step are seldom monitored and that there still remains much to discover about the supposedly ‘dark’ reactions of photocatalytic cycles.
Irradiation intensity
Intensity, like irradiation energy, is chronically under-reported in experimental methods. Source power is sometimes provided (e.g. 50 W LED), however this does not accurately quantify the photon flux or irradiance (energy per time per area, e.g. W m−2) reaching the reaction. This rarely reported parameter is typically much lower, exacerbated by the prevalence of non-coherent light sources and distance from the reaction vessel. A conventional monophotonic catalytic mechanism predicts a linear relationship between irradiation intensity and reaction rate in the light-limited regime. Therefore, many synthetic photoredox reactions are performed using either multiple or high-powered light sources to achieve a light-saturated environment that maximises reaction rates. A recent comparison of commercial photoreactors revealed those with low intensity light sources exhibited decreased reaction rates.38 If reaction rates are maximised only under intense irradiation, it is crucial to identify other causes of photon loss. For example, careful mechanistic analysis of a model α-amino arylation photoredox reaction using Ir(ppy)3 and violet light (λ = 415 nm, 104 W m−2, Fig. 3a) revealed light scattering from the solid inorganic base (sodium acetate) and competing absorption from reagent intermediates significantly reduced the photochemical quantum yield.44 Considering all experimental parameters (analogous to using quartz glassware in traditional ultraviolet photochemistry) requires redefining the term ‘quantum yield’. A reaction's ‘internal’ quantum yield matches the previous definition: the likelihood of a productive reaction once the catalyst absorbs a photon (Φin ≈ 1 for the studied α-amino arylation). Instead, the ‘external’ quantum yield (Φex = 0.15–0.3) accounts for photons lost before catalyst absorption. Maximising the photons that reach the catalyst is also critical in realising large-scale synthetic photochemistry powered by diffuse natural light. Numerous photoreactions (including oxidation, sensitising 1O2 and aryl halide reduction) were achieved efficiently under ambient sunlight using scalable solar concentrators tuned to photocatalyst absorption bands, realising both increased yields and accelerated reaction kinetics.45
 Fig. 3  Irradiation intensity. (a) Full mechanistic analysis of an α-amino arylation photoredox reaction identified significant photon losses, which decreased the overall (or external) photochemical quantum yield. (b) Altering irradiation intensity changed the mechanism of aldehyde α-alkylation between a monophotonic closed radical cycle (high intensity) and an open radical chain cycle (low intensity). (c) Irradiation intensity controlled the (i) catalyst reduction potential, (ii) reaction mechanism (electron or energy transfer) and (iii) the local concentration of radical intermediates, in photochemical reactions catalysed with [Ir(sppy)3]3−. 
The complexity of measuring photochemical quantum yields often results in different values reported for the same reaction; accurate values require standardized light sources with a well-quantified photon flux. Reported quantum yields of the photoredox α-alkylation of 1-octanal by bromomalonate range between 0.09–20,46–50 but using [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 as the photocatalyst irradiated with blue light (λ = 432 nm, 30 μW–28.3 mW) saw the quantum yield surprisingly decrease with increasing light intensity (Fig. 3b).48 As suggested by previous work, the same chemistry could occur via two different mechanisms; high power irradiation, common in most experimental photoreactors, enabled a conventional monophotonic cycle, with a quantum yield Φ < 1. Low intensity instead revealed a prominent radical chain pathway (Φ ≫ 1), after a brief induction period. Intermittent light experiments (0.01–10 ms pulse, 10% duty cycle) revealed the reaction continued for 23 μs once irradiation ceased, much shorter than the intervals used in traditional radical chain experiments (vide infra). This very interesting result challenges the default notion that high irradiation intensity maximises photoredox reaction efficiency.
Light intensity is particularly important in multiphoton mechanisms that exhibit a quadratic relationship between reaction rate and irradiance. High excitation densities are typically required to achieve appreciable reaction efficiencies and several multiphoton phenomena were first observed in spectroscopic experiments using high powered optical lasers.31 The multiphoton hydrated electron chemistry pioneered by Goez, Wenger and Kerzig occurs only once an irradiation threshold is reached, allowing manipulation of the photochemical reaction products (Fig. 3c).29 Most importantly, the potential window of the catalyst system is dictated by irradiance; low intensity blue light (λ = 447 nm, 1 W) affords a monophotonic mechanism restricted by the reduction potential of the [Ir(sppy)3]3− catalyst excited state (E°[PC+/*] = −1.88 V vs. SCE). At high intensity (achieved by collimating the beam size) the system gains access to strongly reducing hydrated electrons (E° = −3.1 V vs. SCE), allowing the selective reduction of bromo- and chloro-substituted benzoic acid (Fig. 3c, i). In addition to tuning the reductive capability of the photocatalytic system, irradiation intensity also allowed switching between energy (monophoton) and electron transfer (multiphoton) pathways (Fig. 3c, ii). Finally, light intensity also governed the standing concentration of transient radicals; low intensity preferentially formed the dehalogenated product while high intensity light produced significantly more radicals, favouring dimerization (Fig. 3c, iii). This interesting observation readily applies to all photoredox reactions and careful control of light intensity could reasonably suppress unwanted side-reactions and increase yield. The molecular weight and dispersity of photoinitiated atom transfer radical polymerisation using two different organic photocatalysts was controlled by modifying the intensity of broadband white light irradiation (λ = 410–700 nm, power not reported and intensity modulated with neodensity filter).51
Low energy irradiation
Deep red and near-infrared light sources are increasingly of interest in photocatalysis; the low phototoxicity and increased tissue penetration of low energy light is readily compatible with biological applications. Unfortunately, most transition metal photocatalysts do not strongly absorb in this region; common iridium(III) and copper(I) complexes exhibit charge-transfer absorption bands that barely reach 400 nm, stretching the definition of visible light photocatalysis. Many groups attempt to address this shortcoming by modifying the catalyst ligand sphere in different ways, including: substituting or replacing cyclometallating ligands with electron-rich alternatives, increasing ligand conjugation and direct coupling with other chromophores.52 Despite these efforts, luminescent transition metal catalysts that strongly absorb above 500 nm are rare. Panchromatic iridium(III) complexes containing bis[(4-methoxyphenyl)imino]acenaphthene ancillary ligands (Fig. 4a) exhibit broad absorption bands that span the visible region (ε ≈ 104 M−1 cm−1, 585–675 nm), although their photocatalytic ability remains untested.53,54 Combining several metal centres provides an alternative method to red-shift absorption. The photophysical properties of bi-, tri- and tetranuclear ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes (Fig. 4a) revealed intense low energy metal-to-ligand charge transfer bands (ε = 5.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1, 490 nm) along with red-shifted emission and increased emission lifetimes.55,56 While multinuclear transition metal complexes are well known for producing efficient light harvesters,57–60 the reported ruthenium(II) complexes were tested as photoredox catalysts for the dehalogenation of 4-bromobenzyl-2-chloro-2-phenylacetate (Fig. 4a).55 Archetypal [Ru(bpy)3]2+ performed well under blue light (λ = 470 nm, 40 W m−2, 80% yield) but activity quickly declined with increasing wavelength – 78% and 31% converted product using green (λ = 525 nm, 19 W m−2) and orange light (λ = 590 nm, 14 W m−2), respectively. Multinuclear complexes exhibited faster reaction kinetics and maintained high yields even as the irradiation wavelength increased, affording 95% yield with orange light.

TPPTS: 3,3′,3′′-phosphanetriyltris trisodium salt. 
Extending photocatalyst excitation wavelengths even further towards the near infrared (>800 nm) is only achieved in select examples. Various organic photoredox catalysts have successfully reduced aryl diazoniums, trifluoroiodomethane (affording trifluoromethylation) and activated benzyl bromides when irradiated with red light (λ = 600–650 nm, power either 1 W or unreported).61–63 A zinc(II) phthalocyanine photocatalyst (Fig. 4b) irradiated with red light (λ = 635 nm, 20 W) afforded perfluoroalkylation of aniline and related heterocycles.64 Dirhodium complexes (Fig. 4b) that efficiently absorb red photons (ε = 8.6 × 103 M−1 cm−1, 624 nm, and irradiated at λ = 670 nm, 0.8 W) reduced protons into hydrogen with modest turnover numbers, in combination with a suitable electron donor.65,66 Osmium, the Group 9 element below ruthenium, produces low energy luminescent d6 complexes (oxidation state +2) but these are not readily tuned like cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes and often suffer from significant non-radiative decay due to the Energy Gap Law. Despite these limitations, a series of osmium(II) complexes with varied potentials (Fig. 4b) were tested as photoredox catalysts.67 Direct population of triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer excited states was achieved with deep red light (λ = 740 nm, 8.18 W) and enabled various reactions, including: polymerisations, arene trifluoromethylation and dual catalysis (i.e. photoredox combined with tradition transition metal catalysis). The osmium(II) photocatalysts afforded increased arene trifluoromethylation yields with increasing reaction scale (1–100 mmol), due to better light penetration, compared with decreasing yields for blue light (λ = 456 nm, 11.91 W) and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst. Unfortunately, directly exciting the triplet manifold is a spin forbidden process (ε = 500 M−1 cm−1, 740 nm), resulting in low quantum efficiencies.
Low energy photocatalysis of biorelevant substrates often incorporates or emulates natural systems. A very recent example uses a tin(IV) chlorin photocatalyst and red light (λ = 655 nm, 100 W, Fig. 4c, i) to reduce aryl azides.68 The aminyl radical intermediates could then be used for proximity-based protein labelling in aqueous buffers. Superior media penetration of the low energy irradiation enabled erythrocyte labelling in whole blood. Instead of energy transfer between different metal centres, the photocatalyst [Ru(bpy)3]2+ was coupled to the light-harvesting protein R-phycoerythrin (RPE), which exhibits strong visible absorption (ε ≈ 2 × 106 M−1 cm−1, 570 nm).69 Mimicking energy transfer pathways in photosynthesis, protein emission was strongly quenched (85%) by the conjugated metal complex, whilst transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed an energy transfer pathway. The biohybrid photocatalyst powered the desulfurisation of glutathione in aqueous buffers (Fig. 4c, ii). Importantly, high activity was obtained using green (λ = 513 nm, power not reported, 100% after 12 h) and red light (λ = 630 nm, power not reported, 78% after 36 h), while [Ru(bpy)3]2+ showed no activity (85% previously obtained using λ = 459 nm blue light, power not reported).
Upconverted light
Despite its superior reaction media penetration, low energy light intrinsically limits the chemical energy of a photoredox reaction (blue 450 nm = 2.76 eV, deep red 700 nm = 1.76 eV). Triplet–Triplet Annihilation Upconversion (TTA-UC) is a multiphoton process that circumvents this energy threshold by converting two low energy photons into one higher energy photon. Low energy photons are absorbed by sensitisers (1S) to form triplet excited states (3S*), which subsequently undergo triplet energy transfer with nearby acceptor molecules (1A). Two of the resulting triplet acceptors (3A) can then combine, annihilating to form a singlet excited state (1S*, which then relaxes via fluorescence) and ground state (Fig. 5a). The resulting increase in emission energy is quantified by an anti-Stokes shift and molecular sensitiser/acceptor TTA pairs span near infrared-to-visible, visible-to-visible and visible-to-ultraviolet upconversion.70,71 The critical Dexter energy transfer step of TTA-UC, requiring short distances and overlapping wavefunctions, limits the scope of possible sensitisers and acceptors.

(b) Select examples of sensitiser/acceptor TTA pairs that provide energy to photoredox reactions: (i) energy transfer [2 + 2] cyclisation of enones, (ii) oxidation of boronic acids and (iii) energy transfer stilbene E/Z isomerism. 
There are two main methods for utilizing TTA-UC in photocatalysis; firstly, upconverted anti-Stokes emission can power a conventional photocatalyst also present in solution. This approach has successfully converted near-infrared light (λ = 720–730 nm, either 1000 W m−2 or power not reported,) into higher energy photons (different acceptors emitted orange λ = 550, 595 nm, green λ = 540 nm and blue λ = 490 nm light) using noble metal porphyrin sensitisers (palladium(II) or platinum(II)) coupled with organic fluorophore acceptors, typically highly-conjugated perylene derivatives.72,73 Various photocatalysts, including [Ru(bpy)3]2+, Eosin Y and Rose Bengal absorbed these high energy photons to enable a range of electron or energy transfer transformations, including: oxidation, aryl halide reduction and [2 + 2] enone cyclization (Fig. 5b). Many reactions worked better than directly exciting the photocatalysts, which the authors attributed to better penetration of the original light source although 1A* emission flux was not measured. In one impressive example, the TTA-UC powered [2 + 2] enone cyclization yielded 46% product in a strongly coloured haemoglobin solution (Fig. 5b, i), while blue irradiation (λ = 450 nm, 35 W) of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ catalyst afforded only 1%.72 Similar advantages were observed in the oxidation of arylboronic acids, near infrared-to-green TTA-UC systems maintained high yields with increasing reaction volume compared to exciting the Eosin Y photocatalyst (Fig. 5b, ii).73 Replacing noble metals sensitisers with more abundant alternatives is an active research area, similar to replacing iridium(III) and ruthenium(II) photoredox catalysts.74,75 One recent study instead employed a molybdenum(0) diisocyanide complex as sensitiser, capable of promoting red-to-blue TTA-UC when combined with 9,10-diphenylanthracene (Fig. 5b, iii).76 Upconverted 1A* emission was sufficient to power a photocatalytic reaction in a secondary submerged flask, powering stilbene isomerisation using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ under red light (λ = 635 nm, 500 mW).
The high energy 1A* excited states formed following acceptor annihilation can also directly power electron or energy transfer events, alternatively representing a sensitiser/catalyst TTA pair. The classic green-to-blue TTA pair, platinum(II) octaethyl-porphyrin and 9,10-diphenylanthracene, enabled reductive dehalogenation of activated aryl halides in a gel based matrix.77 A subsequent blue-to-ultraviolet TTA pair extended similar reactivity to more energy-demanding substrates, with aryl radicals trapped using N-methylpyrrole (Fig. 6a).78,79 Direct catalyst-sensitized upconversion is also capable of initiating radical polymerisation of methyl methacrylate with near infrared light (λ = 730 nm, power not reported).72 More recently, polymerisation of an acrylate monomer was afforded using the homo-molecular TTA-UC of zinc(II) meso-tetraphenylporphyrin.80 Excitation with green light (λ = 532 nm, 2–170 mW) generates triplet excited states that annihilate to form a highly reducing S2 excited state (E°[PC+/*] = −2.53 V vs. SCE). Extensive mechanistic experiments confirmed that electron transfer occurred solely from the S2 state, whether formed using homo-molecular TTA-UC or direct blue excitation (λ = 427 nm, 280 W m−2) of the porphyrin Soret band.

Aryl halide reduction pathways powered by various blue-to-ultraviolet sensitiser/catalyst TTA pairs: (a) diiodoBOPHY-like derivative and 9,10-diphenylanthracene, (b) aqueous TTA-UC using [Ir(sppy)3]3− and naproxen, and (c) Ir(ppy)3 and 2,7-di-tert-butylpyrene. iPrOH: isopropanol. DMA: N,N-dimethylaniline. 
Despite the advantage of long wavelength light for in vivo imaging and labelling, the vast majority of TTA-UC is performed in non-polar solvents. Water and other high polarity solvents typically favour electron transfer reactions, which compete with the necessary Dexter energy transfer steps. Furthermore, the high conjugation of many common acceptor molecules limits their aqueous solubility. Following early reports of TTA-UC in water using a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ sensitiser and carboxylate functionalised acceptors,81 the quantum yield of aqueous upconversion was improved by appending pyrene to the ruthenium(II) polypyridyl sensitiser.82 The increased efficiency enabled reduction of trichloroacetate, although the acceptor was consumed as a stoichiometric reductant. Subsequent blue-to-ultraviolet aqueous TTA-UC extended the energy threshold of this approach using the water-soluble iridium(III) sensitiser [Ir(sppy)3]3− (Fig. 6b).83 The highly reducing 1A* excited state (E°[PC+/*] = −2.74 V vs. SCE) enabled reductive debromination of 4-bromo-2-chloro-5-fluorobenzoate in water and the acceptor regenerated with isopropanol as sacrificial donor.
Sensitisation-initiated electron transfer is an alternative multiphoton pathway that shares much with the mechanism of sensitiser/catalyst TTA-UC. The original proposed mechanism, a combination of energy transfer between [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and pyrene and electron transfer between the pyrene triplet state (1A*) and a sacrificial electron donor,84 has undergone rigorous debate.85,86 Annihilation upconversion to form the pyrene singlet excited state (Fig. 5a) prior to electron transfer is also a plausible pathway, but detailed spectroscopic experiments using complete reaction mixtures instead revealed electron transfer occurs between the pyrene triplet state and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photoredox intermediates resulting from PET with the electron donor.87 Organic triplet states are also vulnerable to degradation and further reactivity, anthracene triplet states formed following energy transfer with an iridium(III) photocatalyst undergo Birch-type reduction.88 The debate surrounding complicated multiphoton mechanisms (rationalised by numerous plausible pathways) highlights both the need and difficulty of careful examination, particularly under experimentally relevant conditions. Annihilation upconversion of pyrene triplet excited states has since been reported using Ir(ppy)3 and tert-butyl functionalised pyrene as sensitiser and catalyst, respectively (Fig. 6c).89 The reduced intermediate, following 1A* quenching by N,N-dimethylaniline, could then participate in electron transfer chemistry (E°[PC°/˙−] = −2.1 V vs. SCE) to reduce energy demanding aryl chlorides.
Two photon absorption
Non-linear two photon absorption (2PA) provides the necessary energy to generate high energy excited states without needing a sensitiser. As with other approaches that exploit low energy photons with good tissue penetration, 2PA capable molecules are used in numerous biological applications, including: in vivo imaging, sensitizing singlet O2 in photodynamic therapy and the controlled release of bioactive species.90–92 They are also prevalent sensitisers in photoinitiated polymerisation for microfabrication and 3D printing,93 and offer exquisite spatial control.94 Examples of two photon absorbers in photoredox catalysis are rare, despite the fact that archetypal catalysts [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and Ir(ppy)3 exhibit modest 2PA cross sections (7 GM [Goeppert-Mayer, 1 GM = 10−50 cm4 s per photon per molecule], 810 nm and 20 GM, 800 nm, respectively).95,96 Tungsten(0) arylisocyanide complexes exhibit strong 2PA cross sections (∼1000 GM, 810 nm) and catalysed the reduction of aryl bromides using near infrared light (λ = 810 nm, ∼1.5 W m−2Fig. 7a).97 Modest conversion (56% over 12 h) was attributed to irreversible catalyst degradation, characterised by the replacement of one aryl isocyanide ligand with two iodides. Very recently, 2PA photocatalysis was demonstrated using a ruthenium(II) catalyst containing styryl appended 2,2′-bipyridine ligands (Fig. 7b).98 When irradiated with deep red light (λ = 740 nm, 8.18 W) the catalyst exhibited high yields for several photochemical reactions, including: sensitising singlet oxygen, reductive dehalogenation, cyanation and allylation.

Intermittent irradiation
Pulsed light is most commonly used to validate radical chain mechanisms in photocatalysis; if ‘dark’ radical chain propagation occurs (i.e. Φ > 1), the reaction should continue after the irradiation is stopped. In practice, light sources are typically pulsed in >1 min intervals, however this is insufficient to monitor the <1 s lifetimes of most radical chain reactions.99 Indeed, product turnover in several [Ru(bpy)3]2+ catalysed radical chain photoredox reactions (photochemical quantum yields Φ > 1, measured by actinometry) was only observed during irradiation with slowly pulsed blue light (λ = 436 nm, photon flux = 6.67 × 10−10 einstein per s, 1–20 min pulse).46 If irradiation pulsing is reduced to short enough intervals, then intermittent light can identify radical chain propagation. A non-linear dependence between product formation and intermittent illumination (0.5–100 ms pulse, 33% duty cycle) was observed for benzhydrol oxidation using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and blue light (λ = 450 nm, photon flux = 6.5 × 10−9 einstein per s−1), quantifying a radical chain lifetime of 19 ms.99 The ubiquity of LED lightsources, readily driven by a pulse generator (compared with mechanical light choppers), allows easy access to pulse cycles approaching the laser excitation common in time-resolved spectroscopy.100
While intermittent irradiation aids mechanistic analysis, its effect on catalytic activity is drastically under-explored. Ground-breaking work has demonstrated how pulsed infrared light (λ = 3.5–9 μm, ∼350 fs pulse) accelerates ground state bimolecular reactions,101,102 but only one example of applying pulsed light sources to synthetic photoredox methodology is currently known. The α-amino C–F functionalisation of alkylamines yielded a moderate 54% using continuous blue light (λ = 454 nm, 18 W) and a copper(I) photocatalyst (Fig. 7c).103 Pulsing the light source (0.01–1 ms pulse, 25% duty-cycle) improved the yield to 89% at the shortest pulse rate. Higher yields were obtained for a wide range of substrates, although electron-deficient perfluorinated aryl substrates favoured hydrodefluorination over C–C bond formation. Such promising synthetic enhancements demand further inquiry; controlling the standing concentration of excited states and radical intermediates seems a plausible explanation.
Outlook
Most approaches that manipulate light exist at the periphery of the broader photochemical community; photoredox research continues to focus on expanding synthetic methodology with little consideration of lightsource. The highlighted examples hopefully demonstrate the possible synthetic advantages when light is considered as any other reagent, worthy of optimisation beyond baseline light/dark controls. Several noteworthy observations hint at the potential of proper photon control: irradiating ‘dark’ reactions to improve catalyst turnover,43 light intensity's role in photochemical quantum yield and the steady state concentration of transient radicals,29,48 and intermittent light affording increased synthetic yields.103 Each phenomena is undoubtedly more prevalent than these isolated examples, and reinforce the value of thorough mechanistic interrogation.
Long wavelengths are increasingly attractive in photocatalysis, offering a high natural abundance (roughly 50% of the solar spectrum is >700 nm) and exceptional tissue penetration for bioimaging and photodynamic therapy. Furthermore, upconverted emission and two-photon absorption can convert low energy photons (less useful in synthetic chemistry) into high energy reactive intermediates that are widely used in biological applications, solar cells and optoelectronic devices, as well as microfabrication and 3D printing. Whilst these multiphoton techniques consistently suffer from low quantum yields due to complicated multistep mechanisms, it is highly likely these will become more prevalent in enabling new photoredox reactions as quantum efficiencies improve.
Emerging optical phenomena also present new opportunities in light-driven synthesis. Singlet fission splits an 1A* excited state into two triplets, which may provide access to two electron PET pathways.104 The recent demonstration of two-step absorption in microfabrication sees a photocatalyst absorb a photon to populate an intermediate electronic state, before a second photon is absorbed to power the reaction.105 Sharing similarities with the multiphoton conPET mechanism, two-step absorption promisingly exhibits a higher quantum efficiency than two photon absorption and requires lower irradiation intensities. Finally, while the ubiquity and price of modern LED light sources has enabled the modern renaissance of visible light photochemistry, the need for quantified light sources must be emphasised.

Timothy U. Connell	Tim Connell completed his PhD at the University of Melbourne (2015) before postdoctoral positions at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (2015) and RMIT University (2017). He was awarded a Fulbright Future Scholarship to undertake research at Carnegie Mellon University (2019) and began his independent career at Deakin University (2021) supported by an Australian Research Council DECRA fellowship for ECRs. His research into the mechanism of homogenous photocatalysis (the conversion of visible light into chemical energy) is underpinned by the fundamental synthetic coordination chemistry of transition metal complexes that interact with light in unique ways.

 	Fig. 1  Multiphoton catalysis. Representative photocatalyst (PC) mechanisms of (a) consecutive photoinitiated electron transfer, (b) sequential photon absorption and electron expulsion, and (c) catalyst transformation and tandem photoredox catalysis.	 

 	Fig. 2  Multichromatic irradiation. (a) Photoreduction of aryl halides using the dichromatic photocatalyst 9,10-dicyanoanthracene, irradiated with a single broadband lightsource. (b) Chromoselective catalysis of mono- and disubstituted aryl halides using Rhodamine 6G. (c) Regeneration of Eosin Y photocatalyst via simultaneous excitation with green and violet light. DIPEA: N,N-diisopropylethylamine, TEOA: triethanolamine. Note: lightbulbs and catalyst highlight boxes represent irradiation and absorbed photons, respectively. Wavelength-exact irradiation sources are included in the text.	 

 	Fig. 3  Irradiation intensity. (a) Full mechanistic analysis of an α-amino arylation photoredox reaction identified significant photon losses, which decreased the overall (or external) photochemical quantum yield. (b) Altering irradiation intensity changed the mechanism of aldehyde α-alkylation between a monophotonic closed radical cycle (high intensity) and an open radical chain cycle (low intensity). (c) Irradiation intensity controlled the (i) catalyst reduction potential, (ii) reaction mechanism (electron or energy transfer) and (iii) the local concentration of radical intermediates, in photochemical reactions catalysed with [Ir(sppy)3]3−.	 

 	Fig. 4  Low energy irradiation. (a) Select transition metal complexes with strong visible absorption bands, between 500–600 nm. (b) Select transition metal complexes with strong deep red absorption bands, between 650–800 nm. (c) Select examples of bioinspired photocatalysis using low energy irradiation: (i) aryl azide reduction using a Sn(IV) chlorin photocatalyst for proximity protein labelling, (ii) desulfurisation of glutathione using a Ru(II) photocatalyst tethered to a light-harvesting protein (RPE). TPPTS: 3,3′,3′′-phosphanetriyltris trisodium salt.	 

 	Fig. 5  Sensitiser/acceptor triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion. (a) General mechanism of molecular triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion. (b) Select examples of sensitiser/acceptor TTA pairs that provide energy to photoredox reactions: (i) energy transfer [2 + 2] cyclisation of enones, (ii) oxidation of boronic acids and (iii) energy transfer stilbene E/Z isomerism.	 

 	Fig. 6  Sensitiser/catalyst triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion. Aryl halide reduction pathways powered by various blue-to-ultraviolet sensitiser/catalyst TTA pairs: (a) diiodoBOPHY-like derivative and 9,10-diphenylanthracene, (b) aqueous TTA-UC using [Ir(sppy)3]3− and naproxen, and (c) Ir(ppy)3 and 2,7-di-tert-butylpyrene. iPrOH: isopropanol. DMA: N,N-dimethylaniline.	 

 	Fig. 7  Two photon absorption and intermittent irradiation. (a) Photoreduction of aryl iodides using 2PA tungsten(0) arylisocyanide catalysts. (b) Styryl-appended [Ru(bpy)3]2+ 2PA catalyst facilitates varied photoredox reactions, including hydrodehalogenation. (c) Intermittent irradiation of a copper(I) photocatalyst improved yields in α-amino C–F functionalisation of alkylamines.
