    , Accepted 6th March 2019First published on 6th March 2019AbstractMetal–organic framework derived nanostructures have unique properties, such as large specific surface area, exclusive porous networks, numerous active sites, and exceptional electrochemical properties, when compared to traditional nanostructures. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to design and fabricate hierarchical copper cobalt sulfide nanosheet (CuCo2S4 NS) arrays from a metal–organic framework. The hierarchical CuCo2S4 NS arrays can provide enriched electroactive sites, as well as shorten the ion/electron diffusion pathways. When evaluated as electrodes for supercapacitors (SCs), the CuCo2S4 NS electrode exhibited remarkable electrochemical properties with an ultra-high specific capacity of ∼409.2 mA h g−1 and an areal capacity of ∼0.96 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 3 mA cm−2, exceptional rate capability (∼77.9% capacity retention at a higher current density of 50 mA cm−2), and outstanding cycling stability (∼94.2% capacity retention after 10000 cycles). Most importantly, the assembled CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG solid-state asymmetric SC displayed a wide operating potential window of 1.6 V with an ultra-high volumetric capacity of ∼2.1 mA h cm−3 at a current density of 3 mA cm−2, an excellent energy density of ∼89.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of ∼663 W kg−1, and an ultra-long cycle life (∼91.5% capacity retention after 10000 cycles). This proposed method provides a general protocol to design and fabricate metal sulfide nanosheet arrays with superior electrochemical energy storage properties and exceptional cycling stability, holding limitless potential for future energy storage devices in commercial aspects.
1. Introduction
The progress of sustainable and eco-friendly energy storage systems has drawn imperative research interest in the scientific community to overcome the energy demands all over the world. Among the numerous electrical energy storage devices, supercapacitors (SCs) have been considered to be the most promising because of their fast charge–discharge characteristics, high-power density merits, excellent intrinsic safety, and ultra-long cycle life.1 Therefore, SCs have been intensively used in modern electronics such as high-power electric vehicles, military devices, portable electronics, and memory devices.2,3 However, SCs have only been used as conventional battery backups due to their poor energy density when compared to batteries, which is a major drawback for energy storage device applications.4 This problem may hinder their commercial utilization possibilities.5–7 Commonly, the enhancement of energy density is ascribed to the design and fabrication of highly active electrode materials, which play an imperative role in determining the energy density of SCs and facilitate the operating potential window and cycling stability.8,9 In recent years, solid-state SCs have emerged as a new type of energy storage device and warrant substantial consideration.10,11 Specifically, solid-state SCs have numerous advantages, such as excellent stability, flexibility, and environmental friendliness, when compared to conventional SCs. The exceptional advantages of solid-state SCs can expand their energy storage applications into commercial sectors.12 Based on their energy storage properties, electrode materials have been classified into those with capacitive-type electroactive materials (i.e., activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc.), and pseudocapacitive-type electroactive materials (MnO2, V2O5, Co3O4, CuO, NiO, etc.).13 The optimum electrode materials should have unique properties, such as hierarchical architectures, enlarged surface area, exclusive porous networks, strong interaction with the current collector, excellent electrochemical properties, simple fabrication methods, and low costs.14 In order to address the energy density problem, fabrication of asymmetric SCs (ASCs) is an innovative approach that hybridizes a capacitive type material with pseudocapacitive type materials. ASCs significantly enhance the energy storage properties, which include the operating potential window, and energy and power densities.15–17
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention for their potential applications in water splitting, fuel cells, solar cells, Li-ion batteries, SCs, sensors, and biosensors, owing to their unique properties of a highly crystalline structure and chemical diversity.18,19 Recently, numerous research studies have focused on the design and fabrication of MOFs with a tunable morphology. Nevertheless, the design and fabrication of MOFs is not a realistically facile, scalable, or cost-effective methodology, which hinders their practical applications in commercial sectors. The structure, morphology, mechanism, and fabrication approaches have been explored to attain greater cost effectiveness, simplify designs and fabricate MOFs with high electrochemical performances. MOFs have been used as templates to prepare porous carbon/metal oxides and the as-obtained electroactive materials have been applied to energy storage devices.20,21 The resultant materials were shown to possess a high specific surface area and unique porous nature, and exhibit high SC performance. However, the original structure of MOFs can be destroyed during the calcination process, which leads to a poor specific surface area. In order to overcome this problem, it is important to introduce guest molecules to improve structural stability.22,23 On the other hand, MOFs have been directly employed as electroactive materials for energy storage applications to achieve high electrochemical performance, because of their high surface area and unique porous nature. There have been a few reports of pristine MOFs used as electrode materials for SCs, but their specific capacity and rate performance were relatively low. In this context, enhancement of the electrochemical properties of pristine MOFs utilizing various metal ions and ligands is one of the key challenges for the scientific community.24,25 For example, Jiao et al. reported mixed-metallic MOF-based electrode materials for hybrid SCs, resulting in high specific capacity with superior rate performances.26 Jayakumar et al. reported generation of graphene supported hollow cage-like NixCo3−xO4 from MOFs and the resultant materials showed high super-capacitive performances.27 Recently, Zhang et al. reported the fabrication of double-shelled Zn–Co–S nanostructures by chemical etching methods, followed by an effective sulfurization process. The resultant Zn–Co–S nanostructures were employed as an electrode for hybrid SCs to achieve high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability, and a long cycle life.28 The fabrication protocols are suitable for synthesis of MOF-based nanostructures in a powder form, which need polymer binders and conductive additives for SC applications. These binders and additives can be a real barrier for their potential use in flexible electronics because they reduce the active sites and result in inflexibility of the electrodes.29–31 To avoid this problem, design and fabrication of MOF-based nanostructures on highly porous 3D substrates has numerous advantages, such as enlarged electroactive sites, shortened ion/electron transport pathways and enhanced synergistic interaction between electroactive materials and the current collector.32 However, there have been few reports of the application of MOF-derived mixed metal sulfides over 3D Ni foam as free-standing and binder-free electrodes for solid-state SCs to date.
Herein, for the first time, we report a novel approach for the design and fabrication of MOF derived ultra-thin CuCo2S4 NS arrays with hierarchical nanostructures for solid-state SCs. The sheet-like CuCo2S4 electrode displayed a high specific capacity of ∼409.2 mA h g−1 at a current density of 3 mA cm−2 and excellent rate capability (∼77.9% capacity retention at a higher current density of 50 mA cm−2) in aqueous KOH electrolyte. The cycling performance test revealed that the sheet-like CuCo2S4 electrode showed an exceptional cycle life, with nearly ∼94.2% capacity retention after 10000 cycles at a current density of 30 mA cm−2. Most importantly, the sheet-like CuCo2S4 and iron oxide anchored nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe2O3/NG) aerogel are employed as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The assembled solid-state ASC exhibited a maximum operating potential window of 1.6 V, high volumetric capacity, exceptional cycling stability, and ultra-high energy and power densities. Thus, we believe that our present synthesis methodology can be easily transformed into a general and cost-effective strategy for the design and fabrication of MOF derived ternary metal sulfides over a porous 3D substrate for practical energy storage and conversion applications. A red-light emitting diode (LED) powered using two CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC devices connected in series demonstrated the practical application of all solid-state SCs.
2. Experimental
MOF derived CuCo2 LDH precursors
Before synthesis of CuCo2 LDH, Ni foams (2 cm × 3 cm) were treated with 3 M HCl under sonication for 15 min, followed by treatment with DI water, absolute ethanol, and acetone for 20 min in each step to remove the oxide layers and other organic impurities. A typical synthesis procedure is as follows: 1 mmol of copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and 2 mmol of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) were dissolved in 20 mL of methanol and sonicated for 10 min to obtain a clear solution. About 204 mg of 2-methylimidazole was dispersed in 10 mL of methanol and added drop-wise to the above mixture. In order to obtain a clear solution, the final mixture was stirred for another 15 min and then it was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The cleaned Ni foam was immersed in the final mixture and the upper surface was covered with glass to avoid contamination. The reaction was carried out at ∼140 °C for 12 h, then cooled to room temperature naturally. For dialysis purposes, the as-synthesized electrode material was immersed in absolute ethanol and dried at ∼60 °C under vacuum conditions. The as-obtained electrode was denoted as the CuCo2 LDH precursor.
Fabrication of CuCo2S4 NS arrays
Hierarchical CuCo2S4 NS arrays were obtained from the CuCo2 LDH precursor through an effective ion-exchange process. The CuCo2 LDH precursor was immersed in 30 mL methanol, containing 0.1 M sodium sulphide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O) in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. A hydrothermal reaction was carried out at ∼140 °C for 12 h. After completion of the reaction, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. For dialysis, the final product was immersed in absolute ethanol for 24 h and dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. The as-obtained electrodes were sonicated for 5 min to remove loosely attached NS arrays. The as-obtained material was denoted as the CuCo2S4 NS. For comparison, copper cobalt sulfide nanosheets with different Cu/Co ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 were prepared using a similar procedure. The resultant materials were denoted as CuCoS4 and Cu2CoS4 NS arrays, respectively. In addition, CuS and CoS were synthesized using the above-mentioned procedure without Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O precursors, respectively. In order to prove the merits of the MOF derived CuCo2S4 NS arrays, CuCo2S4 NS arrays were synthesized by a conventional urea method for comparison. For the conventional urea method, a similar procedure of MOF derived CuCo2S4 NS arrays with urea as the ligand instead of 2-methylimidazole was used. The as-obtained material was denoted as CuCo2S4 NS-U. The mass of all electroactive materials was calculated using a highly sensitive electronic balance (ML204T, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland).
Synthesis of the Fe2O3/NG aerogel
GO was synthesized by our previously reported method.33 The Fe2O3/NG aerogel was prepared using the following detailed procedure: 35 mg of GO was dispersed in 12 mL DI water and sonicated for 1 h to attain a stable suspension. About 2 mL of ammonia solution (NH4OH) was added to the GO suspension and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. 55 mg of Fe(NO3)2·9H2O was dissolved in 5 mL DI water and added drop-wise to the GO suspension and stirred for another 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixture was transferred into a 30 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 12 h, then slowly cooled down to room temperature. The black cylinder aerogel was carefully extracted and kept in DI water for 24 h for the dialysis process. The as-obtained electrode material was freeze-dried at −50 °C for 24 h and the obtained material was denoted as the Fe2O3/NG aerogel. The as-obtained Fe2O3/NG aerogel, carbon black, and poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 85:10:5%, respectively, were ground well and dispersed in 2 mL of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and sonicated for 1 h to attain a uniform suspension, and then was coated on Ni foam (1 cm × 1 cm). After that, the slurry-coated Ni foam was dried at ∼60 °C for 24 h and pressed under 5.0 MPa for 5 s to create a negative electrode for solid-state ASCs.
Materials characterization
The morphological studies of the as-synthesized electrode materials were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; SUPRA 40 VP; Carl Zeiss, Germany) at the Center for University-Wide Research Facilities, Chonbuk National University, South Korea. The elemental compositions and atomic weight percentages of the as-obtained electrode materials were determined by ICP-AES (J-A1100; Jarrell-Ash Company, Japan) and EDAX (SUPRA 40 VP; Carl Zeiss, Germany). The as-obtained electrode materials were investigated by TEM, HR-TEM and SAED (JEM-2200 FS; JEOL Ltd., Japan, 200 kV) at the Jeonju Center of KBSI, South Korea. The thickness and surface roughness of the CuCo2S4 NS were further characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM, XE-100, Park System Co., Jeonju, Korea). The crystalline nature of the as-obtained electrode materials was analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Rigaku Corporation, Japan, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.154 nm) at a scan rate of 2 °C min−1. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements were carried out at ∼77 K with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The elemental compositions of the as-obtained electrode materials were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Theta Probe; Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) at the Busan Center of KBSI, South Korea.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performance of the as-obtained electrode materials was analyzed on a CH660D (CH Instruments, Inc., Austin, USA) electrochemical workstation. When the as-obtained electrode materials were tested in a three-electrode configuration, Ni supported electroactive materials were used as a working electrode, and Ag/AgCl and Pt foil were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. An aqueous 2 M KOH electrolyte and PVA/KOH gel electrolyte were used in the three-electrode configurations and solid-state ASC devices, respectively. The electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectroscopy of the electrode materials was performed in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with a perturbation amplitude of ∼5 mV.
The specific capacity (CSC, mA h g−1) and areal capacity (CAC, mA h cm−2) of the electrode materials were calculated according to eqn (1) and (2), respectively:34 (1) (2)where I is the current during the discharging process, ∫Vdt is the area under the discharge curve, m is the active mass of the electroactive materials, S is the area of the active electrodes and V is the potential window during the GCD process.
The volumetric capacity (CVC, mA h cm−3) of the solid-state ASC device was calculated according to eqn (3): (3)where Vvol is the total volume of the ASC device and V is the potential window.
Fabrication of asymmetric supercapacitors
The ASC was assembled using the CuCo2S4 NS and Fe2O3/NG aerogel as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, and the KOH/PVA gel as a solid electrolyte. The KOH/PVA gel electrolyte was prepared according to the following procedure: 1.5 g KOH and 3 g PVA (Mw = 89000) were dissolved in 30 mL DI water and stirred vigorously at ∼85 °C for 1 h. Both positive and negative electrodes were soaked in the electrolyte for 10 min and then allowed to solidify at room temperature for 10 h. Finally, the assembled CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC device was heat treated at ∼40 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven to remove excess moisture from the solid-state ASC device. The CuCo2S4 NS positive and Fe2O3/NG negative operating potential window was set to 1.6 V. Based on individual CuCo2S4 NS positive and Fe2O3/NG negative electrochemical performances, the mass ratio was optimized to ∼0.67, according to eqn (4): (4)where ΔV is the potential range (V), CSC is the specific capacity (mA h g−1), m is the mass of working electrodes (g), and positive (+) and negative (−) represent the polarity of the electrode. The mass loading used to assemble the ASC device was ∼3.1 mg and ∼4.6 mg of the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The specific energy density (E, W h kg−1) and power density (P, W kg−1) of the solid-state ASCs were evaluated with eqn (5) and (6): (5) (6)where t is the discharge time.
3. Results and discussion
Fabrication and structural analysis of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays
The design and fabrication strategy for the CuCo2S4 NS and Fe2O3/NG aerogel is schematically presented in Fig. 1. First, CuCo2 LDH was derived from an MOF by a simple and scalable hydrothermal method. Then, CuCo2 LDH was transformed into its corresponding CuCo2S4 NS arrays through an ion-exchange process. In detail, an anion exchange reaction occurred between S2− (from Na2S) and O2− (from CuCo2 LDH) to attain a hierarchical CuCo2S4 NS. It is well known that the anion-exchange technique is one of the best techniques to retain the original structure and enhance the electrical conductivity and the catalytic activity of the NS architectures. After the ion exchange process, the CuCo2 LDH was ultra-thin and became highly porous, which may provide a wide space to reduce the ion/electron transport pathway and avoid the dead volume of the electroactive materials, resulting in high rate performance and an ultra-long cycle life.

The surface morphology of the CuCo2S4 NS was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and the results are illustrated in Fig. 2a and b. As depicted in Fig. 2a, the SEM revealed that the ultra-thin CuCo2S4 NS arrays were uniformly grown over porous 3D Ni foam. Note that the SEM image clearly shows that the CuCo2S4 NS arrays were perpendicular to the Ni foam substrate, confirming that the CuCo2S4 NS possessed hierarchical 3D nanoarchitectures. In addition, the CuCo2S4 NS retained its original structure after an effective anion-exchange process, due to the excellent compatibility of the CuCo2 LDH precursor. The high-resolution SEM image clearly indicates that CuCo2S4 NS arrays interconnected with each other to form highly porous networks (Fig. 2b). The morphological analysis revealed that the CuCo2S4 NS arrays had exclusive hierarchical architectures, better than recently reported metal sulfide-based nanosheet architectures.35 The elemental composition of the as-synthesized CuCo2S4 NS was investigated by EDAX analysis and is shown in Fig. 2c. The EDAX revealed elemental components of copper, cobalt, and sulfur, and there was no other peak detected, which further reflects the high purity nature of the CuCo2S4 NS. The surface morphology and sheet thickness of the CuCo2S4 NS were examined by AFM and the results are shown in Fig. 2d and S1a and b.† As depicted in Fig. 2d, the high-resolution AFM of the CuCo2S4 NS clearly revealed that the rms of surface roughness of the NS arrays was around ∼0.5 nm. The average thickness of the NS arrays was ∼2 nm (Fig. S1a and b†). The AFM results are fully consistent with the FE-SEM observations. The elemental copper, cobalt, and sulfur distributions in the CuCo2S4 NS were further examined by SEM-EDS mapping and are presented in Fig. S2a–e.† The SEM-EDS mapping analysis clearly indicated that copper, cobalt, and sulfur were homogeneously distributed in the CuCo2S4 NS arrays. In contrast, the SEM images of the Cu2CoS4 NS and CuCoS4 NS are also presented in Fig. S3.† SEM images of both materials displayed highly disordered nanostructures, which may reduce the electrochemical stability. Further, the CuCo2S4 NS-U arrays were fabricated using conventional methods for comparison with urea, instead of the 2-methylimidazole ligand source, and the corresponding SEM images are shown in Fig. S4a and b.† The SEM images of the CuCo2S4 NS-U displayed poorly interconnected nanosheet arrays with low porosity. The SEM results demonstrated that the structure, morphology, and porosity of CuCo2S4 NS arrays were superior to those of Cu2CoS4, CuCoS4, and CuCo2S4 NS-U arrays produced through the conventional route. Therefore, we expect that our MOF-derived CuCo2S4 NS arrays will be a better choice to enhance supercapacitor performances in three-electrode configurations and solid-state ASCs. The present investigation revealed that the structure and morphology of CuCo2S4 were fully dependent on the synthesis methodology and ligands used. Herein, 2-methylimidazole played an imperative role in the generation of perfect nanosheet array formation (i.e., CuCo2 LDH) versus the conventional urea method. Furthermore, our process used an effective ion-exchange reaction under optimum conditions which maintained the original morphology and enhanced the specific capacity with rate performance and cycling stability.

The intrinsic morphology of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays was examined by TEM, HR-TEM, and HAADF-STEM analyses (Fig. 3). As depicted in Fig. 3a, the TEM image of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays clearly displayed large-sized, wrinkled, and ultra-thin nature, which is in good agreement with SEM observations. The HR-TEM image of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays exhibited a highly ordered crystalline lattice with lattice parameters of ∼0.67 nm and ∼0.95 nm, which matched well with the (311) and (400) planes of the crystalline CuCo2S4 NS arrays (Fig. 3b). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays further revealed the highly crystalline nature (JCPDS card no. 09-0425),36 indicating that no signals were observed for CuS or CoS from the HR-TEM or SAED patterns. The elemental distributions of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays were investigated by HAADF-STEM studies and the results are presented in Fig. 3c and d. The HAADF-STEM analysis clearly demonstrated that copper, cobalt, and sulfur were homogenously distributed over the CuCo2S4 NS arrays, and no elemental segregation was observed. The homogeneous distribution of sulfur is expected to enhance the rate performance and cycling stability of nanosheet-like CuCo2S4 electrodes in the three-electrode systems and ASC devices. This result further confirms that sulfur elements successfully replace the oxygen during the ion-exchange process.

The crystallographic structure and phase purity of the as-synthesized CuCo2S4 NS arrays were studied using the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. As demonstrated, the XRD diffraction peaks at 2θ∼31.12°, 37.72°, 49.78°, and 55.16° can be well-indexed to the (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of the CuCo2S4 phases, respectively (JCPDS card no. 09-0425).36 Note that all diffraction peaks of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays were in between those of the species of CuS and CoS. The shifting of the peak positions further confirms that there was no phase separation between CuS and CoS in the CuCo2S4 NS arrays, which is fully consistent with the SAED pattern. In contrast, the XRD pattern of the pure Ni foam is shown in Fig. S5.† As depicted in Fig. S5,† the XRD diffraction peaks at 2θ ∼44.49°, 51.83°, and 76.36° can be well-indexed to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the pure Ni phases, respectively. This clearly reveals that the pure Ni foam was cleaned properly and no other peaks for nickel oxide were observed. The specific surface area of the CuCo2S4, CuCo2S4 NS-U, Cu2CoS4, CuCoS4 NS arrays was analyzed using N2 sorption isotherms and is shown in Fig. 4b and S6.† The N2 desorption isotherm study revealed that the CuCo2S4 NS arrays had a type IV isotherm with a characteristic hysteresis loop during the applied relative pressure. The BET surface area of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays was ∼132.92 m2 g−1, which is significantly higher than those of CuCo2S4 NS-U (∼48.95 m2 g−1), Cu2CoS4 NS (∼111.6 m2 g−1), and CuCoS4 NS (∼62.7 m2 g−1). This result indicates that the current synthesis protocol delivered a larger specific surface area of the active materials than the conventional urea method. The pore size distribution of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays was examined by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. As depicted in Fig. 4c, the BJH analysis showed that the CuCo2S4 NS arrays had porous diameters of around ∼1.2 nm. This N2 sorption isotherm result indicates that the CuCo2S4 NS arrays had an exceptional surface area with exclusive porous networks, much higher than recently reported results of MS-based electrode materials.37,38 The larger surface area and unique mesoporous networks are expected to reduce the ion/electron transport pathways and enhance the rate performance and cycling stability of SCs in aqueous KOH and KOH–PVA gel electrolytes.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further carried out to investigate compositional and chemical states of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays, as presented in Fig. 4d–f. The broad XPS spectrum of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays exhibited pure elements of copper (∼938.6 eV), cobalt (∼780.6 eV), and sulfur (∼162.9 eV), and a negligible amount of impurities, such as carbon (∼284.81 eV) and nitrogen (∼163.76 eV), as shown in Fig. S7.† This result further confirms that the CuCo2S4 NS arrays were highly pure in nature. The Cu 2p XPS spectrum in Fig. 4d was split into two peaks at ∼934.7 eV and 954.4 eV, corresponding to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively.39 The additional two shakeup satellite peaks at ∼943.2 eV and 963.4 eV, corresponded to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. The XPS results confirm that Cu2+ is in the paramagnetic state.40
The Co 2p XPS spectrum in Fig. 4e was deconvoluted into two peaks at ∼781.3 eV and 797.1 eV, which corresponded to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. Moreover, two additional shakeup satellite peaks at ∼786.4 eV and 803.2 eV fitted to Co2+.41 The S 2p spectrum in Fig. 4f can be well-fitted with two peaks at ∼162.6 eV and 163.8 eV, which corresponded to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively.42 The binding energies of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays were higher than those of pure CuS or CoS, demonstrating the high synergistic interaction between the CuCo2 alloy and sulfur in the CuCo2S4 NS arrays. Based on the XPS analysis, the near surface of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays has an elemental composition of Cu2+, Co2+, and S2−, which is in good agreement with previous results of CuCo2S4 NS arrays.43,44 The atomic weight percentages of the copper, cobalt, and sulfur were found to be ∼11.04 at%, 28.9 at%, and 42.3 at%, respectively (Table S1†). Therefore, the atomic ratio of Cu:Co:S is 1:2:4; this result was found to be in good agreement with the stoichiometric ratio of ∼1:2 for Cu:Co in the CuCo2S4 NS arrays.
Electrochemical performance of MOF derived CuCo2S4 NS arrays
Based on detailed discussion on the as-synthesized materials, a novel CuCo2S4 NS array grown over porous 3D Ni foam can be derived from CuCo2 LDH. The as-obtained CuCo2S4 NS arrays have improved merits, such as reduced ion/electron transport pathways, numerous electroactive sites, volume change buffer, and high coupling interactions between the electroactive materials and Ni foam support, ensuring an advanced free-standing and binder-free electrode for energy storage applications, especially SCs. To investigate the electrochemical performance, the Ni foam supported CuCo2S4 NS arrays were first examined as a SC electrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. For a three-electrode system, MOF-derived metal sulfide electrodes were used as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, and platinum foil was used as the counter electrode. Aqueous 2 M KOH is used as an electrolyte in the three-electrode systems. The CV curves of nanosheet-like CuCo2S4 electrodes at scan rates from 5 to 30 mV s−1 are presented in Fig. 5a. A typical oxidation peak is observed at ∼0.47 V and the corresponding reduction peak is observed at ∼0.14 V vs. Ag/AgCl. As depicted in Fig. 5a, all CV curves showed richer redox sites, indicating that CuCo2S4 NS arrays had a battery-type behavior.45 As expected, a pair of strong faradaic redox peaks is manifested, which is due to the reversible redox properties of Co2+/Co3+/Co4+ and Cu+/Cu2+ in aqueous KOH electrolyte.46 However, it is very difficult to distinguish individual redox couples like Co2+/Co3+ and Co3+/Co4+. Further, during the redox process, the Co2+/Co3+/Co4+ couple resulted in the appearance of a single potential than the aforesaid individual couple but with the same area. This kind of merging of two individual redox potentials and the appearance of a new peak is common for a multi-component system.47 The CV curves clearly reveal that the CuCo2S4 NS has a battery type behavior and possible electrochemical energy storage mechanisms are proposed here as follows:46 CuCo2S4 + 2OH− ↔ CuCo2S4(OH−)2 + 2e−(7)
 Fig. 5  Electrochemical performance of the CuCo2S4 NS electrode: (a) CVs of the CuCo2S4 electrode at scan rates from 5 to 30 mV s−1, (b) GCDs of the CuCo2S4 electrode at current densities from 3 to 50 mA cm−2, (c) CV curves of the bare Ni foam, Cu2CoS4, CuCoS4, CuCo2S4, and CuCo2S4 NS-U electrodes at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1, (d) specific capacity and areal capacity of Cu2CoS4, CuCoS4, CuCo2S4, and CuCo2S4 NS-U electrodes at different current densities, (e) EIS of Cu2CoS4, CuCoS4, CuCo2S4, and CuCo2S4 NS-U electrodes, and (f) cycling performance of the CuCo2S4 electrode at a current density of 20 mA cm−2 (inset shows the GCD curves of the CuCo2S4 electrode from the 9991st to 10 000th cycles). 
Furthermore, the oxidation and reduction peaks slightly shifted toward positive and negative potential windows, respectively, which is related to the internal resistance of the electrode materials. In general, the potential difference between cathodic and anodic peaks (Epp) is one of the significant parameters used to examine the electrocatalytic activity of electrode materials. Note that the Epp value of the CuCo2S4 NS electrode was about 242 mV at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, which is relatively higher than that of the reversible single electron (∼59 mV). The present study demonstrated that CuCo2S4 NS arrays possess a quasi-reversible behavior. The GCD curves of the CuCo2S4 NS electrode at various current densities from 3 to 50 mA cm−2 are illustrated in Fig. 5b.
As depicted in Fig. 5b, the CuCo2S4 NS electrode showed GCD curves with ultra-high redox reaction kinetics and symmetrical shapes, demonstrating that the CuCo2S4 NS arrays had high coulombic efficiency when compared to those reported for metal sulfide-based electrodes in KOH electrolyte.48,49 The GCD curves were fully consistent with redox peaks in CV curves. In contrast, a sequence of CuCo2S4 NS array electrodes was fabricated utilizing various ratios of Cu:Co (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2); the as-obtained Cu2CoS4 NS, CuCoS4 NS, and CuCo2S4 NS electrodes and their supercapacitor performances were investigated in detail and the results are shown in Fig. S8.† In addition, CuCo2S4 NS-U was prepared using the conventional urea method and the electrochemical supercapacitor performance was evaluated.
In order to prove the superior electrochemical properties of the CuCo2S4 NS, other electrodes of bare Ni foam (current collector), Cu2CoS4 NS, CuCoS4 NS, and CuCo2S4 NS-U were also examined at a constant scan rate of 30 mV s−1 and the results are shown in Fig. 5c. The CV curve area of bare Ni foam is fully enclosed, indicating that bare Ni foam has negligible capacity. This result clearly reveals that the Ni foam current collector does not contribute to the capacity behaviour. The other electrodes displayed richer redox kinetics, demonstrating that the capacitor behavior was mainly attributed to the redox characteristics of Cu2+ and Co2+. This result clearly indicates that the CuCo2S4 NS displayed higher CV areas and a higher current intensity when compared to other electrodes. The CV curves of the as-obtained Cu2CoS4 NS, CuCoS4 NS, CuCo2S4 NS-U, CuS, and CoS at various scan rates from 5–30 mV s−1 are presented in Fig. S8a–e.† To further validate the exceptional electrochemical properties of the CuCo2S4 NS, other electrodes of Cu2CoS4 NS, CuCoS4 NS, and CuCo2S4 NS-U were also investigated at a constant current density of 3 mA cm−2 and the results are shown in Fig. S9.† All GCD curves displayed a battery type behavior and were consistent with the CV studies. The GCD confirmed that the CuCo2S4 NS had an excellent discharge time of ∼1525 s, which was much higher than that of other comparative electrodes of Cu2CoS4 NS (555 s), CuCoS4 NS (361 s), and CuCo2S4 NS-U (369 s). Note that, our MOF-derived CuCo2S4 NS showed exceptional electrochemical performance compared to CuCo2S4 NS-U electrodes derived from the conventional route.
The calculated specific and areal capacities of the Cu2CoS4 NS, CuCoS4 NS, CuCo2S4 NS, and CuCo2S4 NS-U electrodes at current densities from 3 to 50 mA cm−2 are shown in Fig. 5d. In addition, the specific and areal capacities of CuS and CoS electrodes as functions of current density were calculated and the results are illustrated in Fig. S10.† The CuCo2S4 NS electrode displayed specific capacities as high as ∼409.19, 394.87, 377.84, 367.97, 357.03, 349.02, 340.96, 332.79, 326.22, and 318.60 mA h g−1 and areal capacities as high as ∼0.96, 0.92, 0.88, 0.86, 0.83, 0.81, 0.79, 0.77, 0.76, and 0.74 mA h cm−2 at current densities of 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. Notably, the specific capacity and areal capacity of the CuCo2S4 NS electrode were ∼409.19 mA h g−1 and ∼0.96 mA h cm−2, respectively, at a current density of 3 mA cm−2, which were much higher than those of the Cu2CoS4 NS (CSC ∼151.29 mA h g−1 and CAC ∼0.35 mA h cm−2), CuCoS4 NS (CSC ∼101.55 mA h g−1 and CAC ∼0.24 mA h cm−2), CuCo2S4 NS-U (CSC ∼106.2 mA h g−1 and CAC ∼0.25 mA h cm−2), CuS (CSC ∼91.8 mA h g−1 and CAC ∼0.11 mA h cm−2), and CoS (CSC ∼231.1 mA h g−1 and CAC ∼0.27 mA h cm−2) electrodes. About 77.9% of the initial capacity was retained at the highest current density of 50 mA cm−2, which was much higher than that of the Cu2CoS4 NS (∼49.9%), CuCoS4 NS (∼44.7%), CuCo2S4 NS-U (∼40.6%), CuS (∼37.7%), and CoS (∼48.6%) electrodes. This result demonstrates that the CuCo2S4 NS electrode has exceptional rate capability compared to the Cu2CoS4 NS, CuCoS4 NS, CuCo2S4 NS-U, CuS, and CoS electrodes. The CV and GCD analyses revealed that the MOF-derived CuCo2S4 NS arrays had ultra-high specific/areal capacity and exceptional rate performance, superior to the recently reported transition metal-sulfide based electrodes in an aqueous KOH electrolyte (Table S2†). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was used to examine the solution resistance (RS), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and diffusion resistance (RW) of the as-obtained electrode materials. The CuCo2S4 NS electrode displayed an ultra-low RS and Rct of ∼0.52 Ω and 0.21 Ω, respectively, which were lower than those of the Cu2CoS4 NS (RS ∼0.81 Ω; Rct ∼0.52 Ω), CuCoS4 NS (RS ∼0.79 Ω; Rct ∼0.51 Ω), and CuCo2S4 NS-U (Rs ∼0.94 Ω; Rct ∼0.81 Ω) electrodes. Such ultra-low RS and Rct of the CuCo2S4 NS electrode were due to the hierarchical arrangement of NS arrays. Furthermore, the CuCo2S4 NS electrode showed RW with a straighter line compared to the Cu2CoS4 NS, CuCoS4 NS, and CuCo2S4 NS-U electrodes, which demonstrates that the CuCo2S4 NS electrode had ultra-fast ion/electron transport kinetics during the redox reaction process. These EIS results further confirm that the CuCo2S4 NS electrode possessed excellent conductivity, which could enhance the electrochemical performance with excellent redox reaction kinetics.
Long-term cycling performance of the as-obtained electrodes is one of the imperative requirements for energy storage applications in industrial sectors. The cycling performance of the CuCo2S4 NS, Cu2CoS4 NS, CuCoS4 NS, and CuCo2S4 NS-U electrodes was investigated using GCD tests with 10000 successive cycles at a current density of 30 mA cm−2 and the results are illustrated in Fig. 5f and S11.† For the CuCo2S4 NS electrode, about 94.2% of the initial specific capacity was retained after 10000 successive cycles. The other Cu2CoS4 NS, CuCoS4 NS, and CuCo2S4 NS-U electrodes retained only 82.4%, 77.2%, and 75.8%, respectively, of their initial capacities, after 10000 consecutive cycles (Fig. S11†). These results indicate that the CuCo2S4 NS electrode possessed an outstanding cycling stability that was much higher than that of the Cu2CoS4 NS, CuCoS4 NS, and CuCo2S4 NS-U electrodes and superior to that of the MOF derived TMS-based electrode in the reported literature.28,50 The first and last ten GCD cycles of the CuCo2S4 NS electrode are shown in the inset of Fig. 5f. As depicted in the Fig. 5f inset, negligible changes were observed in the last ten GCD cycles, compared to the first ten GCD cycles (Fig. S12†). This further confirms that the CuCo2S4 NS electrode had exceptional cycling stability which could be derived from its hierarchical architecture and unique porous networks. The morphological changes of the CuCo2S4 NS after the long-term cycling stability test are shown in Fig. S13a and b.† The FE-SEM image clearly shows that the CuCo2S4 NS electrode maintained its original structure, even after 10000 GCD in an aqueous KOH electrolyte, further indicating exceptional durability of the CuCo2S4 NS.
Electrochemical performance of the solid-state ASC
Based on the electrochemical performance of the CuCo2S4 NS, a solid-state ASC device was constructed using the CuCo2S4 NS as a positive electrode to examine its practical applicability in industrial sectors. In this study, the Fe2O3/NG electrode was employed as a negative electrode anode material because of its unique properties that include excellent electrical conductivity, ultra-high surface area, and excellent redox properties. The Fe2O3/NG aerogel was synthesized using a simple, scalable, and cost-effective hydrothermal method (see more details in the Experimental section). Before constructing the solid-state ASC, the as-obtained Fe2O3/NG aerogel was characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, and N2 sorption isotherms and the electrochemical performance was examined using the three-electrode configuration. A digital photograph of the Fe2O3/NG aerogel is shown in Fig. S14.† The photograph clearly shows the perfect cylindrical shape of the Fe2O3/NG aerogel. The SEM image revealed that Fe2O3 nanoparticles with an average size of ∼80–90 nm were homogeneously anchored on the NG sheets (Fig. S15†). The XRD pattern of the Fe2O3/NG aerogel is presented in Fig. S16a.† The XRD diffraction pattern of the Fe2O3/NG aerogel shows a peak at ∼25.1°, which corresponds to the NG sheets. Furthermore, the intense peak around 24.9° covered the NG peak, which indicates that the Fe2O3 NPs are anchored to the NG framework, which completely matched with the JCPDS card no. 33-0446,51 demonstrating the highly crystalline nature of the Fe2O3 NPs in the Fe2O3/NG aerogel. The XPS survey spectra of the Fe2O3/NG aerogel display peaks at ∼710.9, 531.5, 399.2, and 284.2 eV, corresponding to Fe, O, N, and C elements, respectively (Fig. S16b†). The atomic percentages of the elements in the Fe2O3/NG aerogel are indicated in Table S1.† Furthermore, the high-resolution XPS analysis of the Fe 2p, O 1s, N 1s, and C 1s is presented in Fig. S16c–f.† The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the Fe2O3/NG aerogel were examined using N2 sorption isotherms and the results are illustrated in Fig. S17a and b.† The calculated BET specific surface area and the average pore size of the Fe2O3/NG aerogel were ∼521.55 m2 g−1 and ∼3.5 nm, respectively. These results confirm that the Fe2O3/NG aerogel had a three-dimensional nanostructure, high surface area, and unique mesoporous nature, leading to improvement of the ion/electron transport kinetics during the charge–discharge process.52,53 The electrochemical performance of the individual Fe2O3/NG electrode was investigated using a three-electrode system, with an operating potential window of −1.2 to 0.0 V in an aqueous 2 M KOH electrolyte. The CV curves of the Fe2O3/NG electrode at various scan rates from 10 to 80 mV s−1 are presented in Fig. S18.† All CV curves exhibited a pair of redox peaks, which correspond to the conversion between Fe2+ and Fe3+.54 When the specific potential window increased towards the negative direction, Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ before considerable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Hence, the potential window moves to the positive direction and Fe2+ is typically oxidized to Fe3+, resulting in a single oxidation peak observed in CV curves. Therefore, we have chosen a specific potential window of −1.2 to 0.0 V for the Fe2O3/NG electrode to achieve perfect redox peaks in the present study. Impressively, the shape of the CV curve is maintained even at a high scan rate of 80 mV s−1, demonstrating that the Fe2O3/NG electrode shows a superior capacitive behaviour and excellent rate performance during the electrochemical test. The GCD curves of the Fe2O3/NG electrode at different current densities from 1 to 50 mA cm−2 are presented in Fig. S19.† In order to avoid the HER, we fixed the specific potential window in the range of −1.05 to 0.0 V. All GCD curves show symmetric nature, representing that the Fe2O3/NG electrode has an ultra-high coulombic efficiency and negligible IR drops in GCD curves, which further demonstrated that the Fe2O3/NG electrode has high coulombic efficiency and a low internal resistance. The potential window at ∼−0.68 to −0.96 V vs. Ag/AgCl reveals its distinctive pseudocapacitive behaviours instigated by the electrochemical reaction occurring at the electrolyte and electrode interface. The GCD curves are fully consistent with CV curves. The specific capacity of the Fe2O3/NG electrode at various current densities was calculated by GCD and is shown in Fig. S20.† The Fe2O3/NG electrode exhibited high specific capacities of ∼145.6, 134.5, 128.7, 123.1, 119.9, 115.2, 111.1, 107.3, 104.5 and 100.1 mA h g−1 at current densities of 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mA cm−2, respectively.
The solid-state ASC was assembled using the CuCo2S4 NS as a positive electrode, Fe2O3/NG as a negative electrode, and KOH/PVA as the solid electrolyte. In order to attain the high energy and power densities, the mass ratios of the positive and negative electrodes were optimized and fixed based on a single electrode performance. The optimum mass ratio of the positive and negative electrode was about ∼0.67. The CV curves of Fe2O3/NG (potential window from −1.2 to 0.0 V) and CuCo2S4 NS (potential window from −0.2 to 0.7 V) electrodes at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1 are presented in Fig. S21.† Both electrodes exhibited excellent electrochemical properties with superior redox reaction kinetics. The operating potential window of the ASC played an important role in enhancement of the energy and power densities, and cycling stability. The CV curves of the CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC with different potential windows from 0.6 to 1.7 V at a constant scan rate of 50 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 6a. The operating potential window from 0.6 to 1.0 V produced CV curves that showed nearly rectangular shapes. When the potential window was increased up to ∼1.2 V, the CV curves showed oxidation and reduction peaks. Once the operating potential window reached around 1.7 V, complete oxidation and reduction reactions were observed, demonstrating that the ASC had a battery-type behavior at 1.7 V. In order to further optimize the operating potential window, the GCD test was carried out for the CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC with an operating potential window from 0.6 to 1.6 V at a fixed current density of 5 mA cm−2 and is shown in Fig. S22†. When the operating potential window was increased from 0.6 to 1.6 V, the specific capacity increased significantly from ∼2.4 to 184 mA h g−1. Interestingly, the maximum specific capacity was attained at operating potential windows higher than 1.6 V. Therefore, we conclude that the assembled ASC device with an optimum operating potential window of 1.6 V attained high rate performance and ultra-long cycling stability. The CV curves of the CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC at various scan rates from 10 to 100 mV s−1 are presented in Fig. 6b. All CV curves displayed a pair of redox peaks which were attributed to both the CuCo2S4 NS arrays (positive) and the Fe2O3/NG aerogel (negative) electrodes. When the scan rate was increased from 10 to 100 mV s−1, the shape of the CV curves was maintained, which further indicated that exceptional faradaic reactions occurred between the positive and negative electrode materials of the ASC. Fig. 6c shows the GCD curves of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays//Fe2O3/NG ASC at current densities ranging from 3 to 50 mA cm−2 with a potential window of 1.6 V. The GCD curves clearly showed a battery-type behavior. The GCD curves were consistent with the CV curves. All GCD curves were nearly symmetrical in nature, with negligible IR drops even at a high current density of 50 mA cm−2, demonstrating that the ASC had high coulombic efficiency. The specific capacities of the CuCo2S4 NS arrays//Fe2O3/NG ASC were as high as ∼192, 184, 170, 160, 149, 139, 134, 131, 129, and 126 mA h g−1 with corresponding volumetric capacities of ∼2.05, 1.98, 1.80, 1.76, 1.63, 1.49, 1.41, 1.39, 1.37 and 1.35 mA h cm−3 at current densities of 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. The specific/volumetric capacity of the CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC as a function of the current density is shown in Fig. 6d. To prove the superior properties of the Fe2O3/NG negative electrode, we have assembled the CuCo2S4 NS//activated carbon (AC) ASC device and tested the electrochemical performances under similar experimental conditions (Fig. S23†). When the current density was increased, the specific/volumetric capacity gradually decreased. The solid-state CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC had about 66.2% capacity retention at a high current density of 50 mA cm−2, which is superior to the ∼61.1% of the CuCo2S4 NS//AC at a current density of 30 mA cm−2, demonstrating that our ASC had exceptional rate capability (Fig. S23a†). Cycling stability is one of the important factors for promoting commercial application of ASC devices. In order to implement our solid-state ASC, we evaluated the cycling performance of the CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC device at a current density of 30 mA cm−2 for 10000 successive charge–discharge cycles and the results are shown in Fig. 6e. The assembled ASC retained about 95.6% of the initial capacity after 5000 cycles, and ∼91.5% of the initial capacity was retained after 10000 cycles. The first and last ten GCD cycles of the solid-state ASC device are presented in Fig. S24† and the inset of Fig. 6e, respectively. The last ten GCD cycles were almost the same as the first ten GCD cycles, which further confirm the exceptional cycling stability of the solid-state ASC.

The Ragone plots of the solid-state ASC are illustrated in Fig. 6f. Our CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC device exhibited an ultra-high energy density of ∼89.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of ∼663 W kg−1. Even at a higher power density of ∼16689 W kg−1, the solid-state ASC maintained a high energy density of 59.4 W h kg−1. Impressively, the solid-state ASC achieved high energy and power densities, which are higher than those of CuCo2S4 NS//AC (61.2 W h kg−1 at 460 W kg−1; Fig. S23b†) and superior to other ternary metal sulfide based ASC devices, such as the Ni–Co–S//graphene ASC (60 W h kg−1 at 1800 W kg−1),55 CoNi2S4-rGO//porous carbon (51.7 W h kg−1 at 762 W kg−1),56 Ni–Co–S/G hybrid//porous carbon nanosheets (PCNSs) (43.3 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1),57 NiCo2S4 of TAA-6 and rGO hydrogel (43.3 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1),58 mesoporous NiCo2S4 nanoparticles//AC (28.3 W h kg−1 at 245 W kg−1),59 and other ASC devices reported in the literature (Table S3†). Therefore, the merits of the CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC device could present promising energy storage applications in future electronics. The practical application of the CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC was presented when two samples of ASC devices connected in series were enough to light red LEDs, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6f (a dark and bright room background). This result demonstrates a promising energy storage device for modern electronic devices.60 We believe that the constructed CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC presents simple and cost-effective supercapacitor applications for the industrial sector.
4. Conclusion
In summary, for the first time, we have successfully developed a new strategy for the fabrication of a sheet-like CuCo2S4 NS from a MOF and used it as an advanced free-standing and binder-free electrode for solid-state ASCs. The design and fabrication of hierarchical CuCo2S4 NS arrays used a two-step synthesis protocol, whereby the CuCo2 LDH precursor was formed, followed by an effective sulfurization process. The sheet-like CuCo2S4 NS electrode exhibited an ultra-high specific capacity of 409.2 mA h g−1 and areal capacity of ∼0.96 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 3 mA cm−2 with exceptional rate capability and an ultra-long cycling stability (∼94.2% capacity retention after 10000 cycles). Note that the Fe2O3/NG aerogel exhibited a high specific surface area of ∼521.2 m2 g−1 and can be used as a negative electrode alternative to commercially available activated carbon. Most importantly, the assembled CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG solid-state ASC delivered an ultra-high volumetric capacity of ∼2.1 mA h cm−3 at a current density of 3 mA cm−2, an excellent energy density of ∼89.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of ∼663 W kg−1, and an ultra-long cycle life. The assembled CuCo2S4 NS//Fe2O3/NG ASC device revealed superior electrochemical performance when compared to recently reported MOF-derived metal nanostructure-based ASCs. The current impressive results open a new pathway to design and fabricate sheet-like ternary metal sulfides from a MOF and construct energy storage and conversion devices for use in industrial sectors. Furthermore, two series of devices were connected to light a red LED, demonstrating outstanding practical applicability for modern portable devices. These results reveal a promising design for all energy storage devices using a simple, scalable, cost-effective and environmentally friendly process to synthesize materials that may open up the prospect to fabricate and design nanostructured energy storage and conversion devices for modern electronics.
