    , Accepted 18th August 2014First published on 19th August 2014AbstractIn this paper, a series of Er3+-doped Y2O3 samples are systematically investigated, focusing on the effect of the doping concentration on the emission lifetime and spectrum under both 488 nm and 980 nm excitations. Decay times of the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 emitting states under 488 nm and 980 nm excitations are found to be different and concentration dependent. We explain these variations in terms of the changes in the up-conversion routes caused by the predominance of energy exchanges that involve the lowest lying excited states.
Introduction
Lanthanide doped up-conversion (UC) materials, which can convert infrared radiation into visible luminescence via excited state absorption (ESA) or energy transfer (ET) to excited states, have been widely investigated since their discovery in the 1960s.1–3 Lanthanide doped UC materials can be used for a variety of applications,2 ranging from biology to solar conversion; the narrow visible emission excited by low energy can be employed in biomedicine,4 solid state laser5 and illumination,6 and the materials can be implemented in a functional phosphor layer to improve the efficiency of solar cells by means of converting infrared light, which cannot be absorbed by solar cells, into absorbable visible light.7,8
Although the energy of the excitation and emission bands, due to optical transitions within the 4fn energy manifolds, is weakly dependent on the lanthanide ion's surroundings, changes in the host matrix may affect the emission intensity as well as the UC routes. Lanthanide based UC halides,6,7,9–18 glasses19–21 and oxides8,22–38 have been studied both for a basic understanding of the underlying physics and for a number of applications. However, it has been a challenge to find the most chemically stable and efficient material. β-NaYF4 is one of the most studied materials,6,7,9–15 as it yields one of the highest UC efficiencies.37 However, it requires a relatively complex synthesis method to make pure (thermally unstable) β-NaYF4, which makes it more expensive and less practical for industrial applications.25 On the contrary, Y2O3 has excellent stability27 and the synthesis is simple. Y2O3 also has a low phonon energy (430–550 cm−1), which makes it a suitable and practical prototype UC material.32 Er3+-doped Y2O3 UC systems have been previously investigated.22–24,29–34 These studies were presided by a twofold objective: to understand the UC mechanisms upon different excitation wavelengths and the changes in light emission colour upon changes in the erbium concentration or excitation. However, current understanding still involves an ambiguous combination of cross relaxation (CR) processes (two-ion energy transfer involving excited states) and UC routes.
The UC emission colour (that is, the ratio between the different emission bands) as a function of composition is a phenomenon of high interest, as it should allow the material to be used for multicolour applications. J. A. Capobianco et al. reported that the green to red ratio decreases via UC at an excitation wavelength of 815 nm with increasing erbium concentration in Er3+-doped Y2O3 system. The change was explained by the occurrence of CR via [4I9/2, 4I11/2] → [4I13/2, 4F9/2].23 However, the difference of emission spectra at a short excitation wavelength (488 nm) and UC pumping (815 nm) cannot be explained by this mechanism only. The same group postulated that the CR process [4F7/2, 4I11/2] → [4F9/2, 4F9/2] populates the red-emitting state by depopulating the green ones with UC pumping (980 nm)24 causing a systematic difference of emission spectra under 488 nm and 980 nm excitations. However, this CR process happens under both 488 nm and 980 nm excitations, thus the theory is not enough to explain the spectrum difference. We believe that these incomplete models need further testing, clarification and refinement through the insight provided by the population and de-population dynamics. It is also worth noting that despite the great activity and interest in co-doped systems with a ytterbium sensitizer and erbium emitters, the green to red ratio changes observed upon varying both erbium and ytterbium concentrations are still the subject of major revisions:14,38 recently, R. B. Anderson et al. reported that the red emission is due to a three photon process in the Yb/Er co-doped β-NaYF4 system at 1 μm excitation, involving CR within Er ions from higher-lying states.15 The need for accounting for all the processes and the existing indefinition of those which are important are in part due to the lack of dynamic data and the difficulty in modelling so many states and ions. Therefore, we expect our work in the simpler Er3+-doped Y2O3 system to contribute to understanding more practical systems, such as the Yb/Er co-doped material.
In order to fully understand the UC mechanism and emission colour change, and give some fundamental information on co-doped systems, we have performed a study of the Er3+-doped Y2O3 system using time resolved spectroscopy, which allows the recording of each emitting state's time decay profile and is a method to understand the character of the emitting states.25 The decay times of the emitting states offer the possibility of quantifying not only the probability of radiative processes but, importantly, also that of non-radiative processes such as CR, which are critical to determine dynamical processes and colour properties of optical materials. Moreover, information can be obtained on the populating mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no such systematic study of the 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 lifetimes in Y2O3 under both 488 nm and 980 nm excitations,19–21,30–32 which are vital to understand UC processes in this material and in co-doped systems.8,14,15,25,38
Experimental
Synthesis of Er3+-doped Y2O3 materials
Y(NO3)3·6H2O (99.98%) and Er(NO3)3·6H2O (99.98%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Er3+-doped Y2O3 was synthesized through a conventional spray pyrolysis technique. Typically, a mixture of (1 − x) M Y(NO3)3·6H2O and x M Er(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 50 ml de-ionized water. The solution was sprayed, using a conventional spray gun, onto a piece of glass, which was heated to 450 °C on a hotplate creating a uniformly distributed white powder film of Er3+-doped Y2O3. The white film was then removed and annealed in a furnace at 1000 °C for 2 hours to produce moisture-free material. A systematic lifetime study at different annealing temperatures and times is given in the ESI,† which shows the optimum annealing conditions.
Instrumentation
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the dried powders were recorded using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The erbium doping concentration was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.
For the down-conversion (DC) lifetime and spectral measurements, a Continuum Panther optical parametric oscillator (OPO) was used to provide ∼7 ns pulse with a typical power density of 3 × 106 W cm−2 at a wavelength of 488 nm. Also, a 405 nm continuous wave (CW) laser (VL01132A02) with a power density of 16 W cm−2, which is modulated by a digital pulse wave generator, was used to investigate the pulse length effect. Fluorescence was dispersed in a Triax 550 spectrometer (gratings: 1200 and 600 lines per mm) and detected using a Hamamatsu R5509-72 photomultiplier.
For the UC lifetime measurement, a 980 nm CW diode laser with a maximum power density of 50 W cm−2 was used, which was modulated by a digital square wave generator at a frequency of 11 Hz. The excitation laser was removed from fluorescence using a short pass filter (10SWF-950-B), which was dispersed and collected using the same system as for the DC measurements.

Lifetime measurements
Er3+-doped Y2O3 powder yields a wide range of light emissions, with discrete bands ranging from the visible (∼520 nm) to the infrared (∼1535 nm) following blue excitation at room temperature. In addition, laser illumination at 980 nm is able to excite the visible bands through UC processes. The bands, shown in Fig. 2(a) and (c) for 0.2% Er3+-doped Y2O3, can be assigned to the corresponding emissions from the 4S3/2, 4F9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 states to the ground 4I15/2 state.

As we have stated in the introduction, spectral information is not, by itself, sufficient to understand the difference between DC and UC processes as it only provides a partial picture. In order to fully understand the occurring processes, it is necessary to obtain the details of the decay curves of all intervening states showing how each state is populated and depopulated. To quantify the decay constants, all the decay curves, I(t), were fitted with a double exponential equation, (1)where I(t) is the decaying intensity at the maximum of the emission band, A1 and A2 are the exponential pre-factors and τ1 and τ2 are the fitted decay times. This model is usually employed to account for the decay of erbium ions in an inhomogeneous environment, for example where ions are either in bulk or near the surface and undergoing different quenching or energy transfer routes or when a population of the ions is close to the presence of impurities. Hence, it is widely phenomenologically employed without associated hypotheses on the nature of the parameters. The average decay time constant τav can be determined using,16 (2)when the fit is good (and thus all processes are correctly phenomenologically accounted for), it is equivalent to taking a non-fitted average decay constant, calculated directly from the time dependence of the decaying intensity,39 (3)Fig. 2(b) shows the recorded decay curves and corresponding fits of the 4S3/2, 4F9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 states for the 0.2% Er3+-doped Y2O3 sample. The 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 emitting states (green and red emissions, respectively) show relatively short average DC lifetimes, τav < 120 μs, while the IR emitting states, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2, present lifetimes more than ten times longer, in the order of milliseconds. These long-lived 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 states can, in principle, act as intermediate states for further excitation at 980 nm or participate in energy transfer processes between close erbium ions, causing the visible UC (Fig. 2(c)).
In the given excitation conditions, 0.2% Er3+-doped Y2O3 shows the longest DC lifetimes along the Y2−xErxO3 series for all the emitting states; this is caused by the reduced non-radiative mechanisms for this dilution and particularly the small contribution of concentration-derived quenching such as CR.16,17 The fact that the average UC decay time (∼150 μs) is similar to the DC average lifetime (∼120 μs) proves that energy transfer UC (ETU) is extremely restricted (Fig. 2(b) and (d)). In the general case, if UC is only due to ESA, the 4F7/2 emitting level is populated through the energy resonant 4I11/2 + hν → 4F7/2 process and the subsequent rapid relaxation to the green emitting levels (2H11/2 and 4S3/2); therefore, the emission processes are exactly the same as those under 488 nm excitation.25Fig. 3 shows a much more significant difference between UC and DC average decay times for Er3+ concentrations higher than 0.5% (see ESI† for lifetime fitting and τav numbers). For these concentrations, the average lifetimes of 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 emitting states under 980 nm excitation are in the order of hundreds of microseconds, while the DC lifetimes are considerably shorter. These much higher values and differences constitute direct evidence that the dominant UC mechanism under 980 nm excitation for high erbium concentrations is ETU involving the long lived 4I11/2 and/or 4I13/2 states as excitation reservoirs. ETU processes imply a modulation of the emission lifetime by the long-lived states acting as a reservoir,21,23,25,40 as we discuss below. Importantly, the occurrence of ETU means that erbium–erbium interactions are present even at 0.5% Er3+ content.
 Fig. 3  Average decay lifetime of all emitting states of the Er3+-doped Y2O3 studied samples for DC and UC processes (see text for excitation conditions). Up-triangles: UC; down-triangles: DC; open symbols: excitation for a 50 μs long pulse; crossed symbols: 50 ms pulse; pink symbols: emission from 4I13/2; violet symbols: emission from 4I11/2; red colour symbols: emission from 4F9/2; and green colour symbols: emission from thermalized 4S3/2. 
In the case of 0.2% Er3+-doped Y2O3, it is noteworthy that the green to red emission ratio is also very similar in the cases of UC and DC spectra (Fig. 2(a) and (c)). This difference between UC and DC spectra is much more significant for the higher concentrations (see below).

Fig. 3 summarizes the average lifetimes for the Er3+-doped Y2O3 series when varying the doping concentration from 0.2 to 10% for both UC (excitation at 980 nm) and DC (pulsed excitation at 488 nm). Importantly, before discussing the average lifetime dependence of the emissions with the Er3+ concentration we must note here that the DC and UC time-resolved I(t) curves were measured with different excitation lasers: a pulsed 488 nm laser allowing for the measurement of the intrinsic population and depopulation for DC and a 980 nm CW laser needed to achieve detectable UC, respectively, see above for power conditions. The different absorbed powers cause a completely different distribution of the population of the excited states. In order to study the effect of the excitation pulse length in the difference between DC and UC dynamics we also measured the I(t) decay curves for DC with different excitation pulse lengths by employing a modulated 405 nm CW laser and varying the laser power for the 488 nm laser pulse for the most diluted and most concentrated samples. The average decay times measured for 50 μs and 50 ms, 405 nm excitation pulses on 0.2% and 10% Er3+-doped Y2O3 are also included in Fig. 3. We observe in the figure that for all DC emission wavelengths the average lifetimes for the 0.2% Er3+-doped Y2O3 are irrespective of the laser pulse length. This is also evidence of the absence of energy transfer, as we will comment later. The lifetimes of the longer-lived IR emissions also show no dependence on the excitation length in the case of the 10% Er3+-doped Y2O3. The green emission, however, shows an increased average lifetime for the 405 nm, 50 μs excitation pulses, which is almost an order of magnitude higher with respect to the 488 nm, 7 ns excitation and reaches a value up to two orders of magnitude higher value for the 405 nm, 50 ms excitation. The red emission shows a decrease in the lifetime for the 50 μs long excitation, approximating the green emission lifetime, but experiences an increase for the 50 ms excitation, taking almost the same value as for UC (see Table S2 in the ESI† for numerical values). Interestingly, 405 nm, 500 μs pulse duration excitation provides an intermediate value of 76 μs for the 4F9/2 DC emission, close to the 65 μs reached for 488 nm pulsed excitation. A similar dependence on the laser power has been observed upon varying the energy of the OPO laser pulses (see Table S3, ESI†).

Fig. 3 shows that the average DC lifetimes of the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 and 4I11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions experience a monotonous lifetime decrease when increasing the erbium concentration. This can be explained in terms of the concentration dependent non-radiative theory.16 Concentration dependent non-radiative decays occur due to the enhancement of energy transfer processes, which include excitation hopping (and may lead the excitation to non-radiative traps) and CR mechanisms involving the emitting levels, both becoming more likely as the average distance between Er3+ ions is reduced. Some of the CR mechanisms (which may be resonant or vibrationally assisted) include the cooperative non-radiative decays [4I11/2, 4I11/2] → [4F7/2, 4I15/2], [4I13/2, 4I11/2] → [4F9/2, 4I15/2], [4I11/2, 4I13/2] → [4F9/2, 4I15/2] and [4I13/2, 4I13/2] → [4I9/2, 4I15/2] (and maybe [4I9/2, 4I11/2] → [4I13/2, 4F9/2]14,21 and [4F7/2, 4I11/2] → [4F9/2, 4F9/2]24) as represented in Fig. 4 (ETU1, ETU2, CR7(L2), CR8(L3), CR6(L1) and CR1, respectively). In fact, the first two of these processes contribute directly to the ETU and thus are labelled correspondingly.

Ground state absorption (GSA), excited state absorption (ESA), green, red and IR luminescence, and energy transfer UC (ETU) as well as cross relaxations (CR) are presented. See the ESI† for deeper consideration and argumentation of the most relevant ones and a set of dynamic equations ruling the time evolution of the populations. 

Fig. 3 also shows that under 980 nm excitation (UC regime), the lifetimes of the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 emitting states show a similar trend. They both increase as the doping concentration increases from 0.2% to 2%. At higher doping concentrations there is a subsequent decrease in the lifetime. This variation emphasizes that the dynamics of the reservoir and transfer govern the decay of the UC emission.23,25 Interestingly, Fig. 3 shows that the UC lifetime of the 4F9/2 (red) emitting state in the intermediate concentration regime 0.5–5% is considerably longer (approximately twice as long) than that of the 4S3/2 emitting state. However, the DC lifetime measured under 488 nm excitation is almost the same as in the case of erbium dilutions below 2%. Thus, it can be concluded that there are different energy transfer processes populating the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 emitting states, respectively. According to established understanding, the longer average lifetime for the red emission suggests that the states feeding 4F9/2 are correspondingly longer-lived than those for the green emission, implying that the energy transfer [4I13/2, 4I11/2] → [4F9/2, 4I15/2] (ETU2) or the reciprocal [4I11/2, 4I13/2] → [4F9/2, 4I15/2] (CR7(L2)) is relevant in ETU in the concentrated systems of the studied series (see ESI,† Table S4 for a discussion and, for instance,21,28). The fact that the concentration at which these processes appear is as low as 6.71 × 1019 Er3+ ions per cm3 has critical consequences.
Moreover, the concentration enhanced incidence of these CR routes in the re-population of 4F9/2 even in the DC regime (together with the other looping CR mechanism [4I13/2, 4I13/2] → [4I9/2, 4I15/2] (CR8(L3), as given in Fig. 4)19,36,38,41), which repopulates the red emitting state and the 4I9/2 reservoir, respectively via the long-lived 4I13/2 state, explains the increase of the red DC emission lifetime observed in the high concentration Er3+-doped Y2O3 when the population of the 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 states is large (Fig. 3). This model has implications on the changes of the red to green emission colour ratios as a function of power, concentration and excitation wavelength (DC or UC). Importantly, both the indistinguishable (in the excitation conditions) ETU2/CR7(L2) and CR8(L3) looping require a population of the lowest lying states via multiphonon, radiative or other CR decays (see Fig. 4 for a global picture and Fig. S9 and Table S4 in the ESI† for an approximate description and discussion).
The lifetime study can be summarized as follows: (1) the IR emitting states 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 experience a systematic lifetime decrease with increasing doping concentration, which we assign to conventional concentration quenching (i.e. hopping and CR). This quenching gets more severe as the concentration increases and has important implications on the visible photoluminescence, as these levels act as excitation reservoirs due to their long lifetimes, in the order of milliseconds. (2) Under 980 nm excitation, the lifetime increases from 0.2% to 2% and then decreases from 2% to 10%. The first increase is due to the UC route change from a situation in which ESA is the main mechanism to a prevalence of ETU involving the well-known [4I11/2, 4I11/2] → [4F7/2, 4I15/2] (ETU1) and, since the lifetime of the red emission is approximately double that of the green emission, ETU2 ([4I13/2, 4I11/2] → [4F9/2, 4I15/2])/CR7(L2) [4I11/2, 4I13/2] → [4F9/2, 4I15/2].21,23 The subsequent decrease with increasing erbium concentration is predominantly caused by severe concentration quenching CRi (i = 1–8) which cause a decay in the intrinsic lifetime not only of the emitting levels but also for the 4I13/2 and 4I11/2 excitation reservoir states in the E < 11000 cm−1 (∼1.35 eV) region caused by CRi (i > 5) [particularly for Er3+ higher than 1%,], see ESI.† Interestingly, CRi (i < 5) cause a decrease in the green lifetime, and should be active for both DC and UC, but in the 1 to 8 range no CRi depopulates 4F9/2. Sure, this kind of mechanism exists, as the DC lifetime tends to decrease too in the 0.2–5% concentration range; hence, it is likely that the opposite to CR1, which we label CR9L4, plays a role plus maybe other less resonant CRs from 4F9/2 to higher lying levels.
Importantly, looping mechanisms ETU2, CR7(L2), CR8(L3) and CR6(L1) that re-populate the upper excited states for high concentrations and high powers for both the UC and DC regimes18,19,21,23,38,41 get enhanced when the Er3+ concentration is increased. The severe enhancement of these processes that (except CR6(L1)) rely on long-lived lower lying reservoirs explains the increase of the red emission life when the laser energy increases.
Difference between up-conversion and down-conversion spectra
The emission spectra under 488 nm and 980 nm excitations are shown in Fig. 5(a). The green to red ratio decreases with increasing erbium concentration under both 488 nm and 980 nm excitations, but follows a different trend as shown in Fig. 5(b). Under 488 nm OPO excitation (DC), the green to red ratio change is small from 0.2% to 1% erbium doping concentration, while it decreases by a factor of 10 from 1% to 10% erbium doping concentration. However, for the 980 nm excitation, it decreases considerably more over the 0.2% to 1% concentration range with comparatively little subsequent change. Our estimations of temperature differences caused by different excitation conditions and their effect on the emission properties of the different samples show that concentration effects are dominant and must be taken into account to explain this evolution.
 Fig. 5  (a) Spectra under both 980 nm (UC) and 488 nm (DC) excitations; (b) green to red ratio change with doping concentration for UC and DC processes. 
Concentration-induced processes, which affect the population (and decay) of 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 states differently, explain the change in the DC and UC spectra in the explored power regime. Upon direct excitation on the 4F7/2 state, the CR-induced changes in the population are not significant from 0.2% to 1% and, as observed in Fig. 3, neither are the decay processes, as the lifetime is similar for both the red and the green emissions (Fig. S3, ESI†). From 2% to 10%, as concentration quenching becomes significant and a severe CR process, including the processes CRi (i < 5) and the looping mechanisms CRiL (9 > i > 6) for high populations of the IR states, starts to occur, causing the red emission to become comparatively more intense than the green one, the lifetime gets increased for given power or excitation length conditions.
The change in the UC routes explains the change in the emission spectra for the 980 nm excitation UC regime. At 0.2% doping concentration, ESA is the significant UC route, the spectrum being very similar to that observed under 488 nm excitation. With increasing erbium concentration, ETU gets more preponderant. The ETU1 process [4I11/2, 4I11/2] → [4F7/2, 4I15/2] contributes to populating the upper states as the ESA or similarly the DC regime, but ETU2 [4I11/2, 4I13/2] → [4F9/2, 4I15/2]/CR7(L2) [4I11/2, 4I13/2] → [4F9/2, 4I15/2] and the other CR and looping mechanisms described above result in a higher nominal population of 4F9/2. Thus, there is a steady increase of red emission with increasing concentration from 0.2% to 10%. The considerable increase in the population of the long-lived lower-lying E < 11000 cm−1 (∼1.35 eV) states causes this decrease to be comparatively higher than in DC in the 0.5–2% range.
Conclusions
We have studied the UC mechanisms in the simple Er3+-doped Y2O3 system as a function of the Er3+ concentration through the change in the dynamics of the emitting states, including the 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 states. We have done this by employing different excitation powers, pulse lengths and wavelengths. We have described the progressive importance of energy transfer and CR as the Er3+ content increases from 0.2% to 10% and its implications on the spectral properties and decay times of not only UC (excitation at 980 nm) but also DC. These processes, including looping mechanisms, result in an increase of the DC decay time for high Er3+ concentration at given excitation powers. Moreover ETU/CR from 4I11/2 to 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 causes a dominance of the population of the red emitting state for UC at high Er3+ concentrations, thus affecting severely the green to red emission ratio, and also has an influence on the UC lifetimes of the green and red emissions.21 Importantly these processes start being significant at concentrations of as low as 6.71 × 1019 Er3+ ions per cm3.
The consideration of these ET and CR routes must be taken into account for understanding the doping concentration dependent UC and DC properties of this material (and maybe others) and subsequent implementation of tailored emitting colour properties for phosphors, display and biological applications. These results could also provide deeper insight into more complex, but more practical Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped systems.

 	Fig. 3  Average decay lifetime of all emitting states of the Er3+-doped Y2O3 studied samples for DC and UC processes (see text for excitation conditions). Up-triangles: UC; down-triangles: DC; open symbols: excitation for a 50 μs long pulse; crossed symbols: 50 ms pulse; pink symbols: emission from 4I13/2; violet symbols: emission from 4I11/2; red colour symbols: emission from 4F9/2; and green colour symbols: emission from thermalized 4S3/2.	 

 	Fig. 4  Simplified energy level diagram and most relevant radiative and energy transfer mechanisms in Er3+-doped Y2O3. Ground state absorption (GSA), excited state absorption (ESA), green, red and IR luminescence, and energy transfer UC (ETU) as well as cross relaxations (CR) are presented. See the ESI† for deeper consideration and argumentation of the most relevant ones and a set of dynamic equations ruling the time evolution of the populations.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Spectra under both 980 nm (UC) and 488 nm (DC) excitations; (b) green to red ratio change with doping concentration for UC and DC processes.
