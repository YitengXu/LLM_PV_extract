    , Accepted 7th June 2017First published on 8th June 2017AbstractGraphene nanocomposites were prepared by in situ hydrothermally growing CoSe nanoparticles on different amounts of graphene nanosheets (GNs). The influence of graphene content on the physical and electrochemical properties of CoSe was studied. The CoSe nanoparticles with high catalytic activity accelerated the reduction of triiodide, while the graphene facilitated charge transport during the catalytic process. The CoSe/GN0.50 displayed the highest catalytic activity due to its lowest charge transfer resistance. With increasing the graphene content beyond the optimum concentration, restacking of graphene caused a decreased electrocatalytic activity of CoSe/GN nanohybrids. The DSSCs fabricated with CoSe/GN0.50 as the CE exhibited 20% improvement in the photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) with respect to the standard Pt, much higher than using other reported binary metal selenides. This revealed that CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrids could be used as a promising alternative to platinum counter electrodes for DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Since the first demonstration in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted great interest because of their merits such as low cost, easy fabrication and relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1 At present, DSSCs offer a credible alternative to the traditional solid state devices, a technically and economically promising solution to energy depletion, environmental pollution and ecological destruction. DSSCs have been proved to perform better than conventional solar cells, without a significant change in the PCE in diffused light.2 As a key component, the role of the counter electrode (CE) is to collect electrons from the external circuit and catalyze the reduction of triiodide (I3−) to iodide (I−) at the CE/electrolyte interface.3,4 Hence, an efficient CE should have excellent electrocatalytic activity, high electrical conductivity, a large specific surface area, and high corrosion stability against iodine in the electrolyte. Usually, platinum (Pt) is used to catalyze the reduction of I3− due to its superior conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. However, the factors, such as low abundance ratio, high cost and formation of PtI4 or H2PtI6 due to the corrosion by the I−/I3− redox couple, prevent noble metal Pt from being used for large-scale manufacturing of DSSCs. This has stimulated great efforts to exploit substitutes for Pt in order to reduce the overall cost and simultaneously keep the performance of DSSCs.5 Various carbon materials, conducting polymers, sulfides, nitrides, carbides and their composites/hybrids have been reported as CE materials in place of Pt.6,7
Semiconducting metal selenides have drawn enormous attention due to their unique electronic properties, attractive chemical behaviors and wide range of potential applications.8–11 For example, Wang et al. reported the utilization of metal selenides (Co0.85Se and Ni0.85Se) as CEs in DSSCs. These metal selenides exhibited much higher electrocatalytic activity than Pt towards I3− reduction, and generated a promising efficiency of 9.40% for DSSCs.8c Jia et al. achieved a cell efficiency of 8.88% by using nickel selenide (Ni0.85Se) as the CE which is higher than that of Pt CEs (8.13%).9 Duan et al. reported 10% cell efficiency using Ni0.85Se as the CE.10 Lee et al. reported a PCE of 8.31% for the cells with urchin-like Ni3Se4@MeOH CE which is higher than that of the Pt CE (8.03%) for DSSCs.11 However, there will be a slowdown of electrons flowing from the external circuit to the metal selenide/electrolyte interface due to the relatively poor connection between them, thus retarding the tri-iodide (I3−) reduction. Also, the aggregation of nanoparticles resulted in a decreased active surface area which reduced the electrocatalytic activity. To overcome these drawbacks, hybridization of these materials with conductive carbon based materials such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, etc. is in the limelight and has shown promise to boost the conductivity and catalytic activity of the materials at the same time.12–14
Metal sulfide loaded graphene has been reported as the CE for DSSCs and its PCE is comparable to that of standard platinum.15–17 Moreover, the more electronegativity of sulfur may render the metal sulfide structure more ionic than metal selenides and hence a larger electrical resistivity is expected for sulfides than selenides.18 Therefore, it is desirable to synthesize CoSe/GN nanohybrids to serve as an efficient CE for DSSCs. Among various processes to prepare CoSe such as hot injection,19 microwave irradiation,20 high temperature dissolution–reprecipitation,21 and thermal decomposition,22 the hydrothermal process is a facile route for large scale synthesis. Also, the physical and electrochemical properties of the CoSe/GN nanohybrids can be tuned by varying the mass ratio of graphene and cobalt selenide. However, there is no report on metal selenide loaded graphene as the CE for DSSCs yet.
Herein, for the first time, cobalt selenide nanoparticles with different loadings were in situ grown on graphene by a simple hydrothermal method. The structure, morphology and composition were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The feasibility of these hybrid nanocomposites to serve as CEs for DSSCs was tested. The influences of the graphene content on the electrical conductivity, catalytic activity, and electrochemical and photovoltaic performances were studied. The electrochemical activities of these prepared CoSe and CoSe/GN nanohybrids were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Tafel polarization studies. The CoSe/GN0.50 nanocomposites showed excellent electrocatalytic behaviour and thus led to a higher PCE. The DSSC was then fabricated with a CoSe/GN0.50 based CE and its photovoltaic performance was compared with those fabricated with standard Pt based CEs and other reported binary metal selenide based CEs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O, 98% pure), sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 99% pure), iodine (I2, 98% pure), hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O, 99–100% pure), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, 99% pure) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98% pure) were purchased from Merck. Graphite flakes (99.5%) and lithium perchlorate (LiClO4, 99% pure) were purchased from HIMEDIA. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4, 99.5% pure) and lithium iodide (LiI, 98% pure) were procured from Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. The selenium powder (Se, >99.5% trace metal basis), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, molecular weight = 530000), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96% pure), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMImI, 99% pure) and acetonitrile (99.5% pure) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The ITO coated glass slides were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (surface conductivity ∼ 8–12 Ω sq−1). The TiO2 and platinum paste were purchased from Dyesol Ltd. and the dye Di-tetrabutylammonium cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) was procured from Sigma-Aldrich. All the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received.
2.2 Preparation of CoSe/GN nanohybrids
The CoSe/GN nanohybrids were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. Briefly, 0.0345 g cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O) and 0.01145 g selenium (Se) powders were taken in a 1:1 mole ratio and then dissolved in 50 mL deionized water. To this, the required quantity of graphene oxide (0.02 g) prepared by a modified Hummers method23,24 was dispersed under ultrasonication to obtain CoSe/GN nanohybrids with a CoSe to graphene mass ratio of 1:1. Hydrazine (10 mL) was then added drop by drop with constant stirring to act as a reducing agent to increase the graphitization nature of graphene as well as for the reduction of Co2+ to form cobalt selenide nanoparticles on the graphene. This mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 120 °C for 12 h. After being cooled down to room temperature, the obtained precipitate was washed several times with distilled water and kept inside a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 12 h to obtain the CoSe/GN nanohybrids. By adopting this preparative procedure, the CoSe/GN nanohybrids with other mass ratios of CoSe and graphene such as 1:0.25, 1:0.50 and 1:0.75 were prepared and represented as CoSe/GN0.25, CoSe/GN0.50 and CoSe/GN0.75, respectively. Pure CoSe nanoparticles were also prepared under the same reaction conditions without adding graphene oxide for comparison.
2.3 Fabrication of counter electrodes
The ITO glass slides were washed with acetone, ethanol and deionized water in an ultrasonic water bath and then dried in air. The ITO glass plate was chosen due to its low surface roughness and higher transmittance compared with FTO glass plates.25 The film thickness was controlled using scotch tape as a spacer. The CEs of CoSe and CoSe/GN nanohybrids were prepared by slurry coating procedures. Approximately 95 wt% of the prepared CE material along with 5 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (binder) were dispersed in the required amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and then ground finely using a mortar to get the corresponding CE slurry paste. The as-prepared slurry was coated on the pretreated ITO substrate by using the doctor blade technique at a thickness of 15 μm and then dried for 12 h at 80 °C in a vacuum oven.26 The images of the counter electrode materials are shown in Fig. S1.†
The reference Pt electrode was prepared by spreading platinum paste (Dyesol Ltd.) in the space between the scotch tape and the conducting glass substrate by using a doctor blade technique, followed by drying and sintering in air at 450 °C for 30 min at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.27
2.4 Physical characterization
The morphologies and nanostructures of the prepared CoSe nanoparticles and CoSe/GN nanohybrids were assessed by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (JSM, JEOL 7600F) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (Philips, Model: CM 200). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) data were acquired using a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD (Kratos Analytical Ltd.), with an X-ray source of mono Al Kα (1486.71 eV, 5 mA) and an operation power of 75 W. Unless mentioned otherwise, the data were acquired at an angle of 90° between the substrate and detector, with a step size of 1 eV and dwell time of 100 ms. Fitting and deconvolution of peaks were carried out using XPSPEAK 4.1 software. The peaks were referenced with respect to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV.
The information about the phase and crystallinity was obtained by using the X-ray diffraction technique (Rigaku, Ultima IV) with nickel-filtered Cu-Kα radiation in the range of 20 to 80° with an increment of 0.02°. The Raman spectra were recorded by using a confocal micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw RM 2000) under a 20 mW Innova Ar ion laser of 514 nm.
2.5 Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical impedance (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and Tafel polarization measurements were performed to evaluate the electrochemical catalytic activity of the nanocomposites prior to the fabrication of DSSC devices. The electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out by using a symmetric cell to test the electrocatalytic activities of the fabricated CEs. The frequency limit was set between 1 mHz and 100 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV.28
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in a three electrode cell consisting of platinum as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and one of the fabricated CEs as the working electrode in acetonitrile containing 0.01 M LiI, 0.001 M I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4 at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1.13
Tafel polarization measurements were used to further test the electrocatalytic activity and analyze the interfacial charge transfer between the electrodes and electrolyte by using an electrochemical workstation (Biologic: VSP) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The Tafel polarization curves show the current density (J) as the function of voltage (V) for the symmetric cells fabricated by using the prepared CEs. The symmetrical dummy cells were assembled with two identical CEs coated on an ITO glass substrate with the redox electrolyte to be used for DSSCs.29
2.6 Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
The DSSCs were prepared following the published procedures.30–32 Briefly, a thin layer of nonporous TiO2 film was deposited on cleaned FTO, using 5% titanium(IV) butoxide in ethanol by spin-coating followed by annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. Then, the TiO2 paste (Dyesol Ltd) was coated on the conducting glass substrate using the doctor blade technique and it was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed into a 0.12 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. After rinsing with water, the electrodes were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. The sintered photoanodes were dipped in a solution containing 3 × 10−4 M dye, Di-tetrabutylammoniumcis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h. After the adsorption of the dye, the films were rinsed with pure ethanol to remove excess dye and then dried in hot air. The DSSCs were assembled using a TiO2 photoanode with various CEs such as standard Pt (Dyesol Ltd.), CoSe and CoSe/GN0.50 individually by a hot press at 110 °C. The I−/I3− redox electrolyte containing 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M TBP and 0.5 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (ionic liquid) in acetonitrile was injected into the DSSCs via two small holes drilled on the CE side. Finally, the holes were sealed with the aid of small squares of Surlyn strips. The resultant active area of the cells was found to be 0.20 cm2. All the fabrication steps and characterization measurements were carried out in an ambient environment without a protective atmosphere.
2.7 Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs was measured by using a calibrated AM 1.5 solar simulator (Newport, Oriel instruments U.S.A 150 W, Model: 67005) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and a computer controlled digital source meter (Keithley, Model: 2420). The I–V measurements were carried out on the DSSCs after an aging period of 24 h. The photoelectrochemical parameters, i.e., the fill factor (FF) and light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) were calculated with eqn (1) and (2), respectively.33 (1) (2)where Jsc is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is the open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is the incident light power (mW cm−2), and Jmax and Vmax are the current density (mA cm−2) and voltage (V) in the J–V curves, respectively, at the point of maximum power output. All the fabrication steps and characterization measurements were carried out in an ambient environment without a protective atmosphere. The values for the DSSCs were averaged over at least five measurements and were carried out under the same conditions. The detailed photovoltaic parameters calculated for the three systems of five DSSC devices made using identical counter electrode materials are summarized in Tables S1–S3.†
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a–e show the FE-SEM images of CoSe nanoparticles, graphene oxide (GO) and CoSe/GN nanohybrids. Pure CoSe nanoparticles are observed to aggregate to form large clusters, Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b shows that pure graphene oxide possesses a two-dimensional thin wrinkle sheet-like structure. At the mass ratio of 1:0.25 of CoSe to graphene, the graphene and agglomerated CoSe are almost disassociated and there is no connection between them, Fig. 1c. Fig. 1d depicts the CoSe/GN nanohybrids with a mass ratio of 1:50. The graphene prevents the aggregation of CoSe nanoparticles and forms porous conductive network structures. The functional groups in the graphene oxide could serve as active sites for the nucleation of CoSe nanoparticles and these interactions led to a homogenous distribution of CoSe nanoparticles onto the graphene. The graphene with a large surface area provides an enhanced surface to volume ratio for increasing the contact area. Further, with increasing the mass ratio of CoSe to graphene beyond 1:0.50, the graphene gets restacked due to the π–π interactions and van der Waals forces between the planar basal planes of graphene nanosheets, for CoSe/GN0.75 and CoSe/GN1.00, respectively, Fig. 1e and f. Most of the CoSe nanoparticles are observed to be wrapped by graphene and only very few are dispersed on the graphene surface.

Fig. 2 depicts the HRTEM microstructures of the CoSe nanoparticles and CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrids. From the HRTEM image of CoSe nanoparticles, Fig. 2a, the sphere-shaped CoSe nanoparticles are observed with an average mean diameter of 14 nm. The CoSe nanoparticles are observed to be homogeneously distributed on the graphene nanosheets for the CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrid, Fig. 2b. This may be due to the oxygen containing functional groups such as –OH and –COOH on graphene nanosheets which act as the preferential sites for Co2+ adsorption. The Co2+ ions get adsorbed by these oxygen containing functional groups that exist abundantly on the edge and basal plane of graphene nanosheets. Thus, during the hydrothermal reaction, the CoSe nanoparticles will grow on the surface of graphene oxide without any agglomeration. The wrinkles found in the graphene sheets provide sufficient contact between the graphene and CoSe nanoparticles that bestows an enhanced conductivity to the CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrid. Fig. 2c depicts the clear lattice fringes which confirm good crystallinity of the CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrid.34Fig. 2c shows the lattice fringe spacings of 2.69, 2.02 and 1.80 Å, corresponding to the (101), (102) and (110) planes of hexagonal CoSe, respectively and the interlayer spacing of 3.45 Å ascribed to the graphene sheets of 3 to 9 graphitic layers, Fig. 2c.12 In the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrids, Fig. 2d, the rings are indexed as (101), (102) and (110) of the hexagonal CoSe, indicating that the CoSe nanoparticles on the graphene sheets are polycrystalline in nature.

XPS was employed to explore the nature of chemical bonding and chemical state of CoSe/GN nanohybrids. The survey spectrum of CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrids, Fig. 3a, clearly shows the peaks of C 1s, O 1s, Co 2p, and Se 3d originating from graphene and CoSe in the nanohybrids.35 The presence of the O 1s peak was due to the unavoidable surface oxygen adsorption of the hybrids from the environment.36 The carbon peak at 284.6 eV, Fig. 3b, corresponds to the C–C peak, whereas the peak at 284 eV corresponds to the sp2 hybridized carbon atoms (CC) from the graphene. The CC bond of the sp2 structure contributes to the high electrical conductivity of graphene nanosheets. The Co 2p peaks, Fig. 3c, at 780.1 and 791.07 eV correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 representing the characteristics of Co2+. The Se 3d peaks, Fig. 3d, at 54.9 and 58.8 eV are ascribed to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, referring to the metal–selenide bond (Co–Se bonds of cobalt selenide).37 From the XPS observations, it is revealed that the CoSe/GN nanohybrids mainly contain C, Co2+, and Se2−, indicating the formation of CoSe nanoparticles on the graphene nanosheets.

Fig. 4a shows the Raman spectra of pristine CoSe nanoparticles and CoSe/GN nanohybrids. Graphene oxide (GO) exhibits the D line at 1340 cm−1 and G line at 1582 cm−1. The ID/IG ratio for GO was found to be 0.71. The Raman modes of CoSe were observed at around 160, 477 and 690.74 cm−1.38,39 In the Raman spectra of CoSe/GN nanohybrids, the D band at around 1340 cm−1 and G band at around 1582 cm−1 are observed, the characteristic peaks of graphene. The ID/IG ratio for CoSe/GN0.25, CoSe/GN0.50, CoSe/GN0.75 and CoSe/GN1.00 is 1.36, 1.40, 1.27 and 1.26, respectively. The higher ID/IG ratio of CoSe/GN nanohybrids than that of graphene oxide is due to the removal of oxygen functional groups in the graphene oxide sheets and the re-establishment of numerous small conjugated G-networks (sp2 domains) during the reduction process.40 The increase in the ID/IG ratio with increasing the graphene content can be ascribed to an increase in the degree of defects due to the shrinkage in the volume occupied by the graphene sheets upon the removal of oxygen.41 The increased defect density caused more elastic scattering and thus contributed to the increasing ID/IG ratio. After the mass ratio of 1:0.50, more amorphous carbon resulting from the increased defect density attenuates all Raman peaks and thus the ID/IG ratio gets decreased.42 It is observed that there is no change in the vibrational mode of CoSe in the CoSe/GN nanohybrids. This indicates no phase change in the CoSe nanoparticles with the addition of graphene.
 Fig. 4  (a) Raman spectra and (b) XRD patterns of CoSe nanoparticles and CoSe/GN nanohybrids. 

Fig. 4b shows the XRD patterns of CoSe and CoSe/GN nanohybrids. The XRD patterns of CoSe are in good agreement with the reported literature.43 The diffraction peaks at around 33.62°, 45.43°, 50.45°, 60.39 ° and 61.87° correspond to the (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) planes of hexagonal CoSe, respectively.44 The diffraction peaks match well with the diffraction rings of the SAED patterns. The intensity of the diffraction peak for graphene at around 25° is lower for CoSe/GN0.25 and CoSe/GN0.50 than that of CoSe/GN0.75 and CoSe/GN1.00 due to the prevention of aggregation and restacking of graphene by the immobilized CoSe nanoparticles.13 The broad peak appearing at about 2θ = 19–40° is due to the disordered graphene in the nanohybrids.16 The widening of diffraction peaks for CoSe in CoSe/GN nanohybrids implies that the size of CoSe is decreased in nanohybrids compared to pure CoSe nanoparticles. The mean particle size calculated from the peak at 2θ = 33.62, by using Scherrer's equation, is 17.25, 17.68, 13.41, 13.45 and 13.52 nm for CoSe, CoSe/GN0.25, CoSe/GN0.50, CoSe/GN0.75 and CoSe/GN1.00, respectively. Beyond the mass ratio of 1:0.50, the decrease in the intensity of CoSe peaks is due to the restacking of graphene that wraps the CoSe nanoparticles. The CoSe/GN0.50 with smaller CoSe nanoparticles (∼13.41 nm) offers a high accessible surface for the electrolyte. No impurity peaks are observed, confirming that the hydrothermal method is a facile approach to obtain pure hexagonal cobalt selenide. Fig. S2† shows the energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) of CoSe nanoparticles and CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrids, respectively. The EDX revealed that the C, Co and Se species are present in the CoSe/GN nanohybrids. The atomic percentages of Co and Se are found to be 47.62 and 52.38, respectively, and hence the corresponding stoichiometric ratio of CoSe is confirmed as Co0.90Se.

Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots of symmetrical cells fabricated with platinum, CoSe and CoSe/GN nanohybrids. The inset shows the equivalent circuit where Rs is the series resistance representing the resistance of the substrate in the higher frequency region, Rct is the charge transfer resistance at the electrode–electrolyte interface, and Cdl is its corresponding capacitance, and Zw is the Nernst diffusion impedance in the lower frequency region.45 The equivalent circuit is used to analyze the impedance spectra fitted by using EC lab software. The measured values of Rs and Rct are given in Table 1. The CoSe/GN0.50 CE shows superior electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction compared to other CEs, including the platinum one. The addition of highly electrically conductive graphene nanosheets into CoSe nanoparticles enhances the shuttling of electrons from the external circuit to the high electrocatalytic CoSe, thereby increasing the reaction kinetics of triiodide reduction. However, the addition of graphene nanosheets beyond 50% increases the Rs and Rct due to the aggregation of graphene nanosheets that blocks the diffusion of the electrolyte into the active sites of CoSe nanoparticles in the nanohybrids. The lower Rs value indicates that the CoSe/GN0.50 has a good conducting performance arising from efficient electron transfer from the external circuit to the CoSe by the two-dimensional conductive network of graphene. Relatively lower Rct values for CoSe/GN0.50 indicate a faster charge transfer rate than those of other CoSe/GN nanohybrids. This results in a reduced interface loss of charge transportation and also enhances the charge collection efficiency, thereby increasing the photocurrent and fill factor of DSSCs.13

Fig. 6a shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of the CoSe and CoSe/GN nanohybrids. Two typical pairs of redox peaks (Oxd1/Red1 and Oxd2/Red2) of the CEs in the electrolyte containing I3−/I− redox couples are clearly observed, corresponding to the reactions 3I2− + 2e−  2I3− and I3− + 2e−  3I−. The cathodic peak current density (Jpc) in the second redox couple (Oxd2/Red2) and the separation (Epp) between Oxd2 and Red2 peaks are the measures of the catalytic activity of CEs.46 The cathodic peak of the CoSe nanoparticles appears at a comparatively more negative potential than that of the CoSe/GN nanohybrids. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the CoSe/GN nanohybrids can be attributed to the synergistic effect of superior electrical conductivity of graphene nanosheets and the superior electrocatalytic activity of CoSe nanoparticles.8 The values of cathodic current (Jpc) show the trend of CoSe/GN0.50 (−0.87 mA cm−2) > CoSe/GN0.25 (−0.72 mA cm−2) > CoSe/GN0.75 (−0.71 mA cm−2) > CoSe (−0.68 mA cm−2) > Pt (−0.52 mA cm−2) > CoSe/GN1.00 (−0.47 mA cm−2). The higher cathodic current density of CoSe/GN nanohybrids is due to the higher active areas provided by graphene. The cathodic peak of CoSe/GN1.0 is not well defined compared to those of other CoSe/GN nanohybrids. This may be attributed to the strong stacking effect of excessive graphene in the nanohybrids that veils the electrocatalytic active sites of CoSe nanoparticles. Hence, beyond the optimum concentration of graphene, it has a passive effect on the catalytic activity towards tri-iodide reduction.16

Fig. 6b shows that the peak current densities are in a linear relationship with the square root of the scan root, indicating that the electrocatalytic behaviour is dependent on the diffusion coefficient (Dn, cm2 s−1). The Dn of I3− can be estimated from the cathodic peak current density of cyclic voltammograms using the Randles–Sevcik equation:17 Jpc = K·n3/2·A·C·Dn1/2·υ1/2(3)where Jpc represents the peak current density of Red2 (mA cm−2), K is the constant of 2.69 × 105, n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox event, A is the electrode area (cm2), C represents the bulk concentration of I3− species (mol L−1), and υ is the scan rate (V s−1). The Dn values of I3− for platinum, CoSe and CoSe/GN nanohybrids are given in Table 1. The Dn shows the trend of CoSe/GN0.50 (4.19 × 10−6 cm2 S−1) > CoSe/GN0.25 (2.87 × 10−6 cm2 S−1) > CoSe/GN0.75 (2.79 × 10−6 cm2 S−1) > CoSe (2.56 × 10−6 cm2 S−1) > Pt (1.49 × 10−6 cm2 S−1) > CoSe/GN1.00 (1.22 × 10−6 cm2 S−1). The larger Dn of CoSe/GN0.50 (4.19 × 10−6 cm2 S−1) arises due to the higher active surface area of CoSe/GN0.50.17 The CoSe nanoparticles anchored on the graphene sheets act as a spacer that prevents the restacking of graphene sheets thereby providing a higher active surface area and an efficient diffusion pathway for the electrolyte. At the mass ratio of CoSe:graphene = 1:0.25, the CoSe nanoparticles aggregate and there is no connection with graphene (Fig. 1c) which constrains the available active surface area. Beyond the mass ratio of 1:50, the enwrapment of the CoSe nanoparticles occurs due to the restacking of graphene which reduces the availability of active sites.
The separation (Epp) between Oxd2 and Red2 peaks is inversely correlated with the electron transfer rate (Ks). A smaller Epp indicates a higher Ks. The Epp of CoSe/GN0.50 (510 mV) is closer to that of platinum (480 mV), implying that the CoSe/GN0.50 has faster redox kinetics and better electrocatalytic activity due to the homogeneously dispersed CoSe nanoparticles on the graphene surface, high surface area of graphene for CoSe anchoring, and high electrical conductivity of graphene. In addition, the CoSe/GN0.50 nanocomposites exhibit high stability after 100 CV cycles, Fig. 6c and d. This indicates that the CoSe/GN0.50 counter electrode is a remarkably good electrochemical catalyst for the reduction of I3−, having advantages of excellent electrochemical stability and strong adhesiveness on the FTO glass substrates.
The Tafel polarization studies were performed to test further the electrocatalytic capability of the CEs. Fig. 7 shows that the CoSe/GN0.50 CE has a relatively larger slope for the anodic or cathodic polarization zone in comparison to other samples owing to its increased exchange current density (J0) at the interface. The highest J0 of the CoSe/GN0.50 corresponds to the lower Rct and highest catalytic activity, which is consistent with the electrochemical impedance (Fig. 5) and CV results (Fig. 6). Meanwhile, the J0 can also be evaluated from the Rct of the Nyquist plot according to eqn (4)46 and the values are given in Table 1: (4)where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is the Faraday constant and n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3− to I−, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance. Additionally, the limiting current density (Jlim) can be obtained from the current density in the low slope and high potential region. The Jlim directly depends on the diffusion coefficient (Dn) according to eqn (5):47 (5)where l is the spacer thickness, and C is the concentration of I3−. It is observed that the Jlim values of CoSe/GN nanohybrids and platinum are higher than that of the CoSe nanoparticles, suggesting that the CoSe/GN nanohybrids have a higher diffusion coefficient.32 The higher diffusion coefficient is attributed to the presence of CoSe nanoparticles on the graphene nanosheets. The CoSe/GN0.50 is found to have the highest Jlim due to the homogenous immobilization of highly dense CoSe nanoparticles on the graphene nanosheets, thereby reducing the diffusion resistance. The agglomeration of CoSe nanoparticles at the lower graphene concentration, and the π–π stacking of graphene at higher graphene concentration impedes the diffusion of the electrolyte to the inner active sites of CoSe nanoparticles, resulting in the decreased Jlim. Thus, the CoSe/GN0.50 with the lowest diffusion resistance contributes most efficiently to the reduction of triiodide ions. Thus, the results from the electrochemical impedance, CV and Tafel measurements imply that the CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrids could serve as a less expensive alternative to platinum as CEs in DSSCs, Table 1.

Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plots for DSSCs fabricated using platinum, CoSe and CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrids as counter electrodes. The inset shows the equivalent circuit used to analyze the Nyquist plots using EC lab software and their corresponding values are given in Table 2. In the equivalent circuit, Rs is the series resistance representing the resistance of the substrate, TiO2 film, etc. The smaller arc in the high frequency region corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct1) and double layer capacitance (Cdl1) at the CE/electrolyte interface, while the larger semicircle at the intermediate frequency corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct2) and double layer capacitance (Cdl2) at the dye adsorbed TiO2/electrolyte interface. The value of Rct1 for the CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrid CE is lower than that of the platinum counter electrode. This is due to the enhanced charge collection efficiency and higher triiodide reduction rate of CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrids. There is no significant change observed for the Rct2 values because both the DSSCs have the same photoanodes.

Fig. 9 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs based on platinum, CoSe, and CoSe/GN0.50 CEs obtained at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 under the standard global AM 1.5 irradiation. Their corresponding parameters are given in Table 3. The photovoltaic performance of the CoSe/GN0.50 CE is superior to that of platinum and pure CoSe. The DSSCs fabricated with CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrids as CEs have a higher efficiency (9.27%) than those fabricated with platinum (7.68%) and CoSe (7.39%) CEs. The enhancement in the FF for DSSCs with CoSe/GN0.50 is attributed to the decrease in the Rs and Rct. Furthermore, the significant improvement of Jsc in the CoSe/GN0.50 based CE is due to the highly conductive graphene that serves as a conductive pathway for electron transport. The graphene provides a shortcut for the electrons arriving from the external circuit to the CoSe and thereby increases the total current of the I−/I3− redox reaction.

Fig. 10 illustrates the charge transfer mechanism of DSSCs fabricated with CoSe/GN0.50 as the CE. The graphene functioned as the primary framework structure bridging all the secondary structure of CoSe nanoparticles together. The high surface area of graphene promotes a high number of CoSe nanoparticles to anchor on the surface of graphene and also increases the accessible contact area of the CoSe/GN CE with the electrolyte than that of CoSe. This leads to the reduction in the electron–hole recombination and thus enhances the efficiency of DSSCs.15

The CoSe/GN0.50 is observed to exhibit 20% improvement in the photo-conversion efficiency than the standard Pt, Table 4, which is much higher than those of other reported binary metal selenides.8–11,43 The significant improvement of PCE for CoSe/GN0.50 compared to other reported bare metal selenides is due to the inclusion of graphene which acts as a linker to increase the electrical connection between the bare CoSe nanoparticles and thus enhances the overall performance of DSSCs. These significant improvements spotlight the prominent synergistic effect of the high electrocatalytic activity of CoSe and high electrical conductivity of graphene in the CoSe/GN nanohybrids.

4. Conclusion
CoSe/graphene nanohybrids were prepared successfully by an in situ hydrothermal reaction method and used as efficient counter electrodes for DSSCs. The stoichiometric ratio of CoSe was found to be Co0.90Se. At the optimized mass ratio of CoSe/GN0.50, the CoSe nanoparticles were homogeneously immobilized onto the graphene sheets. The enhanced electrochemical properties were due to the synergistic effects of CoSe and graphene. The CoSe/GN0.50 nanohybrids reduced the charge transfer resistance which retarded the interfacial recombination, thereby enhancing the overall PCE of the DSSCs. The PCE of DSSCs with CoSe/GN0.50 as the CE exhibited 20% improvement in the photo-conversion efficiency with respect to the standard Pt CE, which was much higher than those of other reported binary metal selenides.
