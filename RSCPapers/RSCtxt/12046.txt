The major issues are their poor long-term stability and toxicity. In light of this, materials design and screening of novel stable perovskites is becoming a surging research direction. In contrast to conventional trial-and-error processes, materials genome techniques and high-throughput calculations have been prevalently applied in this area and accelerated materials discovery. Here, we present a review that summarizes recent progress in this field, which mainly focuses on four classes of perovskites including AM2+X3 halide single perovskites, AM4+Y3 chalcogenide single perovskites, A2M+M3+X6 halide double perovskites and A2M3+M5+Y6 chalcogenide double perovskites. The stability, electronic, optical, and defect properties are extensively discussed for each class of these perovskites, and their applicability as solar cell absorbers has also been commented on.

1 Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite (OIHP), CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), solar cells have gained intensive research interest in recent years.1–10 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has kept growing from 3.8%1 in 2009 to 25.2%11 in 2019, which has surpassed those of commercialized thin-film solar cells such as those of CdTe (22.1%) and CuInxGa1−xSe2 (23.4%).11 Their high performance can be ascribed to their superior photovoltaic properties such as appropriate direct bandgaps (1.55 eV for CH3NH3PbI3), strong optical absorption (∼105 cm−1), ambipolar conductivity, long carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes, defect tolerance, and small exciton binding energy.12–22 However, their toxicity and long-term stability under ambient conditions remain the main hurdles to their industrial deployment.23,24 Therefore, efforts have been made towards finding stable and Pb-free perovskites which could inherit the superior photovoltaic properties of halide perovskites. These efforts include trial-and-error experiments, high-throughput calculations, structure–property descriptors and machine learning. In this review, we summarize recent research studies and discoveries of four classes of perovskites including AM2+X3 halide single perovskites, AM4+Y3 chalcogenide single perovskites, A2M+M3+X6 halide double perovskites and A2M3+M5+Y6 chalcogenide double perovskites, as shown in Table 1. High-throughput screening and experimental and theoretical studies of representative materials for each class are discussed.

For halide single perovskites, the s2 type [AM2+X3, M = Pb/Sn/Ge], IIA type [AM2+X3, M = Ca/Sr/Ba], and transition metal (TM) type [AM2+X3, M = transition metal] are fully studied. CsPbI3 inherits the superior performance of MAPbI3. Due to the small size of Cs, CsPbI3 suffers from phase instability, with easy phase transformation to a yellow phase (non-perovskite phase). Several strategies, such as mixing with Br to form CsPbI2Br alloys, reducing dimensions to form layered or nanocrystal structures, and using organic molecular passivation, have recently been used to stabilize the photoactive black phase. Sn- and Ge-based single halide perovskite solar cells exhibit much lower PCEs due to the easy oxidation of Sn2+(Ge2+) toward Sn4+(Ge4+).25,26 IIA type single halide perovskites have too large bandgaps, and thus limiting visible light harvest as solar cell absorbers.27–29 Transition metal (TM) type single halide perovskite solar cells also exhibit low PCEs since their small cation radii lead to lower-dimensional perovskites, which reduce their optical absorption coefficients and inhibit out-of-plane charge transport.30,31 Among the chalcogenide single perovskites, BaZrS3 is one of the potential candidates which passed the screening criterion of high throughput calculations,32,33 and has been mostly studied. Experimental studies verified that the bandgap of BaZrS3 (1.73–1.85 eV)34–36 was a little larger than the optimal bandgap for solar cells. Thus, a Zr/Ti or S/Se mixture provides a better strategy to reduce the bandgap for solar cell applications.34,37 However, the biggest shortcoming of chalcogenides is their poor film-forming ability compared to halides. The first reported sulfide perovskite solar cell device was fabricated based on LaYS3 absorbers with no measurable photocurrent using high-temperature growth techniques.38,39
Among the halide double perovskites, the s0 + s2 type Cs2AgBiBr6 family exhibits an indirect bandgap because of the chemical mismatch between the Ag 4d and Bi 6s orbitals.40,41 Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br)42–46 are stable but have large bandgaps. Cs2AgBiI6 is expected to have an appropriate bandgap but is unstable, which may decompose into Cs3Bi2I9.46 For the s0 + s0 type, the representative material Cs2AgInCl6 has a direct bandgap. However, it has parity-forbidden transition at the band edge, resulting in a significant difference (∼1.14 eV) between the fundamental (2.12 eV) and optical bandgaps (3.26 eV).47 s2 + s2 type double perovskites such as Cs2InBiCl6 have direct bandgaps and allowed transitions at the band edge. Unfortunately, it is unstable due to the easy oxidation of In+ to In3+.48–50 Alternatively, one can reduce the bandgap through the cation ordering of M+ and M3+. For example, Cs2AgBiBr6 can vary continuously from a bandgap of 1.93 eV for an ordered double perovskite structure to a band gap of 0.44 eV for a disordered structure.51 Due to its indirect bandgap, Cs2AgSbCl6 performs poorly in terms of light absorption. Indium incorporation to form Sb/In alloys can improve the band edge wavefunction character, because when increasing the In composition x in Cs2AgSb1−xInxCl6, the compounds gradually transit from indirect to direct bandgaps.52,53 When we incorporate Na at the Ag site of Cs2AgInCl6 which has parity-forbidden transition, the transition dipole moment increases as the Na content increases with a maximum amount of 40% Na.54 Therefore, cation disordering in solid solution seems to be an effective method to engineer the problems of bandgap values, indirect bandgaps, and forbidden transition for double halide perovskites.
Chalcogenide double perovskites discussed in this review involve 54 A2M3+M5+Y6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; M3+ = Sb3+, Bi3+; M5+ = V5+, Nb5+, Ta5+; Y = O, S, Se) perovskites.55,56 Due to the ns2 configuration of Sb3+ or Bi3+, this class of perovskites may retain the superior properties of perovskites with the valence band maximum (VBM) derived from strong sp coupling between M3+ lone-pair s and Y np states. Oxide perovskites show good stability but the bandgaps are too large for sunlight absorbers due to the low energy of the O 2p orbital contributing to the VBM. Among them, Ba2BiNbO657,58 has been synthesized in experiments and Ba2Bi1+xNb1−xO6 (0 < x < 1) has been adopted in water-splitting applications.59,60 For sulfides and selenides, two 3-tilted phases (P21/n and R phases) are studied. The results show that the P21/n phase is more stable than the R phase, while the R phase has a more close to direct bandgap than the P21/n phase for the same perovskites. Ba2BiNbS6 was recommended as the most promising chalcogenide double perovskite due to its appropriate bandgap and relatively high stability in the P21/n phase.55
Apart from first-principles calculations and experimental synthesis, empirical descriptor and machine-learning techniques have recently shown their capability of fast screening and accelerated discovery of novel perovskites. The most popular perovskite stability descriptor, tolerance factor t, was proposed by Goldschmidt61 in 1926 and has provided guidance for synthesizing stable perovskites in recent years. Subsequently, new tolerance factors (μ + t)η and τ are proposed by Sun62 and Bartel63, respectively. (μ + t)η is proposed based on the high-throughput calculations of 138 perovskites, including 12 halide single perovskites, 72 halide double perovskites, 18 chalcogenide single perovskites and 36 chalcogenide single perovskites, and then verified by another 69 perovskites with a prediction accuracy of ∼90%.62τ was identified by the sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO), a unique machine-learning approach, to separate perovskites and non-perovskites with an accuracy of 92% via machine learning.63 Learning from experimental data of halides using the support vector machine (SVM) based classifier with structural features also obtained >92% accuracy in classifying perovskite formability.64 For the stability of perovskites, the Kernel ridge regression (KRR)65 and gradient boosting regression (GBR)66 models were used to train the halide data of DFT-calculated decomposition energy with RMSEs of 34 meV per atom and 21 meV per atom, respectively. With respect to the bandgap, the GBR,67 random forest (RF) with SVM,68 and multi-fidelity co-kriging69 models were adopted to train the data of hybrid halide, chalcogenide double, and halide double perovskites, respectively. The ML studies about material properties, such as formability, stability, and bandgaps, are summarized in this review. In the following, we will discuss different classes of materials in detail.
2 AM2+X3 halide single perovskites
All possible halide single perovskites AM2+X3, where A, M and X have 12, 51, and 3 elemental choices, are shown in Fig. 1. There are a total of 1836 combinations including 324 (1512) kinds with (without) RE metal. They can be classified into the s2 type, IIA type, TM type, and RE type.
 Fig. 1  Elements considered in AM2+X3 halide single perovskites with A, M2+ and X sites marked in blue, cyan and red, respectively. When an element is half-colored, it means it can be at both sites. 
The results of high-throughput calculations on PBE bandgaps (PBE-Eg) of 360 AM2+X3 (A = K, Rb, Cs; X = Cl, Br, I) halide single perovskites are illustrated in Fig. 2a. By considering the bandgap screening criteria of PBE-Eg in the 0.2–0.7 eV range, Krishnamoorthy et al.25 identified 9 perovskites for solar cell absorbers: KSnBr3, KSnI3, RbSnBr3, RbSnI3, CsSnBr3, KGeBr3, KGeI3, RbGeI3 and CsGeI3. By further evaluating their thermodynamic stability, they found that only three of the candidates, namely RbSnBr3, CsSnBr3 and CsGeI3, were predicted to be energetically stable. One of the candidates, CsGeI3, was synthesized in a rhombohedral phase and solar cell devices are fabricated which display high photocurrents, about 6 mA cm−2, but are limited by its poor film-forming ability and oxidizing tendency. Filip et al.27 explored all possible divalent substituted metal ions from the periodic table, and yielded 248 metal-halide combinations. Based on the two concurrent criteria, i.e. the stability in a perovskite phase and the bandgap, the number of possible compounds is reduced from 248 to 25, including 15 compounds which have not yet been discovered for optoelectronics (Fig. 2b). The electronic property calculations of five crystal structures (cubic, tetragonal-1, tetragonal-2, orthorhombic-1, and orthorhombic-2 phases) of CsM2+I3 perovskites with M = IVA (Ge/Sn/Pb) or M = IIA (Mg/Ca/Sr/Ba) were performed by Ray et al.70 using DFT with five different functionals, as shown in Fig. 2c. The authors pointed out that Mg- and Ba-based perovskites are difficult to synthesise because of their positive formation energies, while Ca- and Sr-based perovskites exhibit large bandgaps and high hygroscopicity, even though they have negative formation energies. As a consequence, IIA type perovskites are unlikely candidates for application in solar cells. The most possible candidates are based on s2 type perovskites since they are stable and with more suitable bandgaps. As reported in the literatures, CsPbI3,71–76 CsSnI3,12,77–80 and CsGeI325,81 have been successfully synthesized in at least one of the perovskite phases.70

2.1 s2 type
s2 type halide single perovskites refer to AM2+X3 with M2+ = Ge, Sn or Pb. Their common feature is that their VBMs have the strong antibonding character of the M2+ns orbital and X np orbital. Because of the lone pair s state of Pb, CH3NH3PbI3 has superior photovoltaic properties such as a high optical absorption coefficient, balanced carrier effective mass, and defect tolerance.20,82

2.1.1 Pb halide perovskites. 
The high efficiency of hybrid halide Pb-based perovskites MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) is mainly attributed to the lone pair s orbital of Pb. Replacing the hygroscopic MA cation with robust inorganic cations such as Cs can be considered as a promising approach to overcome the instability of MAPbX3 and retain the high efficiency of Pb. Similar to MAPbX3, the VBM of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) is mainly composed of antibonding hybridized Pb 6s and X np orbitals, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) consists mostly of Pb 6p orbitals.83 Since the first report in 2015, the PCE of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) solar cells has increased from 2.9%71 to 19.03%84 with enhanced stability. There are four phases, i.e. the cubic phase (α-, Pmm), the tetragonal phase (β-, P4/mbm), the orthorhombic phase (γ-, Pbnm) and a non-perovskite phase (δ-, Pnma) for CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I).85 The phase stability is temperature-dependent. At high temperature, CsPbI3 is stable in the α-phase which is known as the black phase with a bandgap of 1.73 eV.73,74 However, when it decreases to room temperature, the α-phase CsPbI3 is unstable due to the transformation to the non-perovskite yellow δ phase that is relatively inactive as a photovoltaic material. The Br-counterpart CsPbBr3 is stable in distorted perovskite (γ-phase) at room temperature. Adding Br increases the tolerance factor, resulting in increased phase stability. It is reported that at least 40% Br86,87 is needed to suppress the phase separation due to light-enhanced ion migration for CsPb(I, Br)3, while MAPb(I, Br)3 need Br >∼15%.88 A theoretical study showed that CsPbI2Br has a particularly stable alloy phase due to the strong Coulomb interactions in the ionic perovskite lattice.89 CsPbI2Br demonstrated a middle bandgap (1.91 eV) between CsPbI3 (1.71 eV) and CsPbBr3 (2.3–2.4 eV)90,91 and the devices achieved reasonable efficiencies (13.3%,92 13.47%,93 and 14.45%94). Another way to make a stable cubic phase of CsPbI3 is to lower the crystal structural dimensionality such as nanocrystals,95,96 since the surface energy may be negative in halide perovskites97 and thus stabilizes the α-phase. Apart from mixing ions and reducing dimensions, organic molecular (DTEA, PVP, PEO, PTABr, PEA, etc.) passivation can also stabilize the photoactive black phase by suppressing the crystallization of the perovskite98–102 or preventing water from reaching the perovskite.103–106


2.1.2 Sn halide perovskites. 
Sn, isovalent to Pb, is a common element for Pb replacement. Sn-Based perovskites as promising lead-free perovskites have been extensively studied for their crystallographic and electronic properties and device performance.107–112 Umari et al.113 investigated the optoelectronic properties of β-phase MASnI3 with group symmetry I4mcm, in comparison to MAPbI3. MASnI3 and MAPbI3 exhibit direct bandgaps of 1.10 and 1.67 eV assessed by GW + SOC calculations, which are close to their experimentally measured bandgaps (∼1.2 and 1.55 eV),114,115 as shown in Fig. 3a and b. Similar trends could also be observed in their inorganic counterparts; namely, the Cs-based counterpart CsSnI3 (1.3 eV77) shows a smaller bandgap than CsPbI3 (1.73 eV73,74). It seems that Sn-based perovskites are potential candidates with more suitable bandgaps. Moreover, Sn-based perovskites exhibit excellent hole transport properties such as mobilities of 2000 cm2 (V−1 s−1)12 for MASnI3 and 585 cm2 V−1 s−177 for p-type CsSnI3. However, the highest PCE of Sn-based perovskite solar cells is just about 10%,107,116–118 which is attributed to the existence of VSn and Sn4+ produced by the easy oxidation of Sn2+ → Sn4+.116 The Sn4+ is spontaneously formed and acts as a p-type dopant within CsSnI3 in a process referred to as “self-doping”,115 leading to a high background carrier population.114,116 Meanwhile, tin vacancies serve as recombination centers.26 These two kinds of defects give a loss of VOC, and thus a low PCE is obtained for Sn-based perovskites. In order to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+, Sn-based perovskites must be synthesized under Sn2+-rich conditions, which can be obtained, e.g., by adding Sn2+-based additives. Kumar et al.80 first demonstrated that adding 20% SnF2 in CsSnI3 solar cells increased JSC to 22.7 mA cm−2 and VOC to 0.24 eV, which was ascribed to the increase in the formation energy of VSn and thus a reduction of VSn concentration as shown in Fig. 3c.112 Due to its high p-type electrical conductivity and near-infrared region light absorption, CsSnI3 in solar cells can be regarded as either a hole transport material (HTM) or a light absorber material (LAM). To better understand this, Xu et al.119 studied the defect properties of CsSnI3, as shown in Fig. 3d and e. The results show that when the chemical potential of Sn is poor, a high concentration of acceptors, such as Sn or Cs vacancies (VSn, VCs), can form easily due to their low formation energy. The results indicate that CsSnI3 acts as HTM. In contrast, when the chemical potential of Sn becomes richer, the concentration of acceptors decreases; thus CsSnI3 acts as LAM. However, the deep donor SnI increases under Sn-rich conditions, which provide more carrier recombination centers. Therefore, this suggests controlling the chemical potential of Sn to a moderate level to balance the p-type acceptor and deep level n-type donor. In order to avoid the oxidation of Sn2+, Cs2SnI6 has been considered as a promising Sn-based perovskite with good stability due to the 4+ oxidation state of Sn,120–124 which can be viewed as splitting 2Sn2+ into one vacancy and one Sn4+ cation from CsSnI3. A defect study revealed that Cs2SnI6 was quite different from CsSnI3. Instead of VSn, VI and Sni are the dominant defects formed in Cs2SnI6, leading to intrinsic n-type conduction, as shown in Fig. 3f. The difficulty in forming VSn defect is due to the strong covalency in the [SnI6] octahedra.125 Because of the deep levels of VI and Sni, an I-rich synthesis environment is recommended for Cs2SnI6.

2.1.3 Ge halide perovskites. 
Germanium is another group IVA element which may possess a lone pair s electronic configuration and is eco-friendly. Stoumpos et al.81 synthesized seven hybrid inorganic/organic AGeI3 compounds. As the ionic radius of the A site increases, the crystal structure becomes more distorted, turning from a 3D structure with a direct bandgap to a 1D structure with a larger indirect bandgap. Among them, CsGeI3, MAGeI3, and FAGeI3 have 3D crystal rhombohedral symmetry Rm (Fig. 4a) with bandgaps of 1.63 eV, 2.0 eV, and 2.35 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4b. The bandgap trend could be explained by the large bandgap deformation potential for Ge-based perovskites.25 The study of their electronic structures shows that the VBM is mainly contributed by the antibonding states of I 5p and Ge 4s orbitals, whereas the CBM is dominated by Ge 4p orbitals, which is similar to Sn- and Pb-based perovskites.126 However, the bandgap of AGeI3 is larger than those of their Sn- and Pb-counterparts. For example, the bandgaps of MAGeI3, MASnI3 and MAPbI3 are 2.0 eV, 1.2 eV, and 1.55 eV, respectively. This trend can be explained by the following: (i) the Ge 4s state is deeper than the Sn 5s state. Meanwhile, Pb has large relativistic effects, leading to deeper 6s states contributing to the VBM. (ii) The structural distortion of the [GeI6] octahedra is larger than those of the corresponding Sn and Pb compounds because of the small ionic radius of Ge2+ (0.73 Å).112 The predicted PCE of CsGeI3 could reach 27.9%, which is even higher than those of MAPbI3 (26.7%) and MASnI3 (19.9%), as shown in Fig. 4c.127 However, Krishnamoorthy et al.25 first fabricated Ge-based perovskite solar cells, and got low PCEs of 0.11% and 0.20% for CsGeI3 and MAGeI3, with low VOCs of 0.074 eV and 0.15 eV, respectively. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4d. This could be explained by the easy Ge2+ oxidation to Ge4+. Kopacic et al.128 improved the PCE by introducing Br in CsGeI3. By substituting 10% of the iodide with bromide, the PCE has reached 0.57% with VOC of 0.345 eV. Ming's defect calculations reveal that the Ge vacancy in CsGeI3 is the dominant defect with shallow transition levels due to its rather low formation energy under the Ge-poor conditions. This is similar to CsSnI3 and CsPbI3, as shown in Fig. 4e,129 which yields a very high-density of holes and metallic conductivity. When the synthesis condition becomes Ge rich or I poor, compensating deep donors, i.e. VI, increase, as shown in Fig. 4e, which may act as recombination centers and lower the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of CsGeI3 solar cells. The deep defect level of VI is due to the strong Ge–Ge covalent bonding, suggesting that the synthesis of CsGeI3 under Ge-poor conditions may improve the efficiency.

It is difficult to maintain the 3D framework of perovskites for TM(II) type perovskites due to the small ionic radii of transition metal (TM) cations such as Fe2+ (61 pm), Co2+ (65 pm), Cu2+ (73 pm), and Pd2+ (86 pm), with the tolerance factor t or octahedral factor μ located out of the range of 0.813 < t <1.107 and 0.442 < μ < 0.895, typically leading to lower-dimensional layered perovskites with the general formula A2M2+X4 (e.g., MA2CuClxBr4−x,30 MA2FeCl4,130 and MA2PdCl4131). They are isostructural to Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites with the formula An+1BnX3n+1 when n = 1.31,132,133 As n changes from ∞ to 1, the bandgap turns to be larger, leading to the wide bandgap of TM(II) type perovskites. For the TM type perovskite, only Cu-based ones have been studied in solar cell applications, obtaining low PCEs below 1%, e.g. <0.2% for MA2CuClxBr4−x,30 0.51% for (p-F-C6H5C2H4-NH3)2CuBr4 and 0.63% for (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2CuBr4.134 The low PCEs can be explained by (i) the low dimensional structure limits charge transport; (ii) the Cu d orbitals contribute to the VBM and CBM, leading to heavy carrier effective mass; (iii) the weak optical absorption edges are attributed to the Cu dxy to Cu dx2−y2 transitions;30 and (iv) the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ introduces a high density of trap states, providing additional carrier recombination centers. For all inorganic Cu-based perovskites, Cs2CuX4 (X = Cl, Br, Br/I) have been synthesized in a quantum dot (QD) form which exhibited high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of ∼50% for blue-green light emission and excellent air and photo-stability. The spatially isolated [Cu–X] tetrahedron is also surrounded by Cs+ ions and Cu2+ ions possess a tetrahedral coordination mode.135 Apart from 214-type Cu-based halide perovskite derivatives, 123-, 113-, 213-, 325-, 327- and 459-types are also reported in experiments,136–141 and their thermodynamic stabilities are systematically investigated, providing a phase and compositional map for guiding experimental synthesis.142 Instead of solar cell absorbers, light-emitting diodes could be a potential direction for the application of TM(II) type perovskites.
IIA type perovskites AM2+X3 (A = Cs, MA; M2+ = Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+; X = Cl, Br, I) have been investigated in several theoretical studies,28,29,70 and exhibit too large bandgaps for photovoltaic applications. In comparison to Pb-halide perovskites, their large bandgaps can be explained by (i) the high s orbital of the alkaline-earth metal, leading to a higher CBM,28 and (ii) the absence of s–p antibonding states, leading to a lower VBM. The GGA-calculated bandgaps for MACaI3, MASrI3, and MABaI3 are 2.95, 3.6, and 3.3 eV respectively. In experiment, Uribe et al.29 reported the synthesis of MACaI3 with an optical bandgap of 3.78 eV. In addition, three inorganic IIA type perovskites, i.e. CsCaI3, CsBaI3, and CsSrBr3, were synthesized by Ray et al.,70 and the XRD data showed an orthorhombic Pnma structure, among which CsSrBr3 exhibited an optical bandgap of >6.3 eV. Until now, there has been no report about IIA type perovskite solar cells.
3 AM4+Y3 chalcogenide single perovskites
All possible chalcogenide single perovskites AM4+Y3, where A, M and Y come from 32, 39, and 3 elemental kinds, are shown in Fig. 5. There are a total of 3744 combinations including 1880 (1864) kinds with (without) RE metal. They can be classified into three representative types, that is, IVA type, TM type, and RE type.
 Fig. 5  Elements considered in AM4+Y3 chalcogenide single perovskites with A, M4+ and Y sites marked in light blue, bright yellow and red, respectively. If one element is half-colored, it means that it can be at both sites. 
Chalcogenide single perovskites ABY3 with tolerance factors 0.71 < t < 0.9 usually form distorted perovskite structures with tilted octahedra [M4+Y6] to lower the total energies. 18 AM4+Y3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; M4+ = Ti4+, Zr4+, Hf4+; Y = S, Se) compounds in three phases including distorted perovskite, hexagonal (non-perovskite), and needle-like (non-perovskite) phases have been studied in theoretical calculation by Sun et al.32 The results reveal that either small bandgaps or pseudo-direct bandgaps make the non-perovskite phases unsuitable for thin-film solar cells. The distorted perovskites among the eighteen S- and Se-based compounds seem to be more suitable. Among them, CaTiS3, BaZrS3, CaZrSe3, and CaHfSe3 have been proposed to be good PV candidates due to their appropriate and direct bandgaps,32 as shown in Fig. 6a. Meanwhile, Ju et al.143 investigated 27 IVA type chalcogenide single perovskites with the formula AM4+Y3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; M4+ = Sn4+, Ge4+, Te4+; Y = O, S, Se) in distorted perovskite phases based on DFT calculations, as shown in Fig. 6c. The screening results show that eight compounds locate in the optimal bandgap range (0.90–1.60 eV). Among them, SrSnS3, SrSnSe3, CaSnS3, and CaGeO3 show direct bandgaps with values of 1.56 eV, 1.00 eV, 1.58 eV, and 1.15 eV, respectively. The former three exhibit high absorption in the visible region, with SrSnSe3 displaying comparable optical absorption to MAPbI3. Furthermore, SrSnSe3 and SrSnS3 are predicted to exhibit good carrier transport properties due to their relatively small effective masses. However, SrSnS3 has been synthesized with a ‘needle-like’ non-perovskite phase which is not suitable for solar cell absorbers due to its weaker absorption.144,145 Huo et al.33 performed high-throughput calculations of 168 AM4+Y3 (A = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd, Sn, Pb; M4+ = Ti4+, Zr4+, Hf4+, Si4+, Ge4+, Sn4+, Pb4+; Y = O, S, Se) chalcogenide compounds in four phases with Pmm, Pnma, P63/mmc and Pnma (‘needle-like’ structure) group symmetries. The screening funnel used to search for potential chalcogenide absorbers is shown in Fig. 6b. Through the filtering procedure including thermodynamic stability, bandgaps, effective masses, optical absorption, and dynamic stability, finally, BaZrS3, BaHfSe3, SrZrSe3, SrHfSe3 and BaZrSe3 in the Pnma perovskite phase are selected for potential solar cell applications.33

Among the 18 AM4+Y3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; M4+ = Ti4+, Zr4+, Hf4+; Y = S, Se) compounds, BaZrS3, CaZrS3, SrTiS3, and SrZrS3 have been synthesized in experiments.35,36 The methods and structures of the synthesized chalcogenide single perovskites are summarized in ref. 39. BaZrS3 was proposed as a promising candidate and intensively studied. The morphology of BaZrS3 is shown in Fig. 7a. It has grain sizes of 100–200 nm, with the black color suggesting visible light absorption over a broad range. EDX data (Fig. 7b) show the stoichiometry of Ba:Zr:S = 1:1:3, and the XRD spectrum (Fig. 7c) can be matched with that of the standard file JCPDS 00-015-0327, suggesting that BaZrS3 possesses an orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure with a Pnma space group.146 It has a direct bandgap of 1.73–1.85 eV,34–36 which is a little larger than the optimal range (1.0–1.6 eV) for efficient single-junction solar cell absorbers. The optical absorption curve of BaZrS3 with an optical bandgap of 1.85 eV is shown in Fig. 7d. Therefore, Meng et al. investigated the alloy of BaZrS3 with Ti at the Zr sites and Se at the S sites to reduce the bandgap of BaZrS3 effectively.34 As shown in Fig. 7e, the bandgap reduction is more effective in Ti alloying whose bandgap decreases almost linearly compared with Se alloying, which shows a bowing effect.147 However, introducing compressive strain provides a feasible approach to stabilize BaZr1−xTixS3 thin films, since the combined theoretical and experimental efforts imply that BaZr1−xTixS3 (0 < x < 1) alloys may not be stable under thermal equilibrium growth conditions.35

4 A2M+M3+X6 halide double perovskites
All possible halide double perovskites A2M+M3+X6, where A, M+, M3+ and X have 10, 11, 42, and 3 elemental kinds, are shown in Fig. 8. There are a stunning total of 13860 combinations including 5940 (7920) kinds with (without) RE metal. They can be classified into the s0 + s2 type, s0 + s0 type, s2 + s2 type, and RE type.

4.1 s0 + s2 halide double perovskites
s0 + s2 type halide double perovskites, such as Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 and their families, are compounds that have two cations at the B lattice site; one has an s0 atomic orbital configuration and the other has a lone-pair s2 orbital configuration, respectively. The prototype s0 + s2 compound, Cs2NaBiCl6, was synthesized in 1970 and the research was focused on the ferroelectric phase transition property at that time.148 Later, its structure was found to be a 3D cubic framework with the Fmm space group.149 The electronic properties, optical absorption properties, and thermodynamic stabilities of the Cs2NaBiCl6 family (with M+ = alkali metal ions; M3+ = Sb3+, Bi3+; X = Cl, Br, I) are investigated to ascertain their potential applications in solar energy conversion. Unfortunately, all these double perovskites are predicted to possess an indirect and large bandgap, limiting their efficient visible-light harvesting. The effective masses of holes are relatively large reflected by the flat upper valence bands, suggesting the inferior mobility of holes. The stability results show that chloride perovskites (Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2NaSbCl6,148 and Cs2KBiCl6150) are more stable than the iodide perovskite Cs2NaBiI6.151,152 Another s0 + s2 type double perovskite case is Cs2AgBiBr6 and its family, as shown in Fig. 9a. The representative materials Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 were successfully synthesized via a solid state or solution route by McClure43 and Slavney,44 and they exhibit very good stability under ambient conditions whose single crystals are shown in Fig. 9b and c. It is reported that Cs2AgBiCl6 has a bandgap ranging from 2.2 eV to 2.77 eV,45 whereas Cs2AgBiBr6 has a lower bandgap ranging from 1.83 eV44 to 2.19 eV43 due to its higher Br 4p state, which indicates that the bandgaps of those two perovskites are larger for solar cell absorbers. The calculated bandgaps of these perovskites are indirect with the CBM/VBM located at different points (X/L). The charge density isosurfaces of the VBM of Cs2AgBiBr6 are shown in Fig. 9e, in comparison to Cs2Pb2Br6. For Cs2Pb2Br6, the Pb atoms contribute equally in all directions, leading to a stronger antibonding state at the Γ point. For Cs2AgBiBr6, the electronic mismatch between Ag and Bi is the primary cause of the indirect bandgaps of the Cs2AgBiX6 family.40 At the X point, the coupling of the Ag d orbital with the Br p orbital is able to incorporate some Bi s state into the valence band as well, leading to a much higher valence band compared to the Γ point, as shown in Fig. 9f.42 The CBM originates primarily from spin–orbit coupling due to the splitting of the Bi-p1/2 and Bi-p3/2 states in the conduction band which is predominantly antibonding Bi-p with halogen-p states. The upper valence band consists of a small amount of Bi-s and halogen-p antibonding states. However, the predominant composition of the upper valence band is hybridized Ag-d and halogen-p states in both Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6. On moving from Cl to Br, the bandgap and bandwidth are reduced due to the increase in energy of the Br-4p level as compared to Cl-3p. The iodine compound Cs2AgBiI6 is predicted to have a narrowed bandgap of ∼1.75 eV, but it has never been synthesized in the 3D crystal structure phase due to the poor stability of iodine compared with chloride or bromide. The stability also follows the trend that Cl-based perovskites are more stable than their Br- and I-counterparts. Through ion-exchange reaction, Cs2AgBiI6 nanocrystals are synthesized due to the surface effect.153 Cs2CuBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) as the other members of the Cs2AgBiBr6 family have also been discussed in stability. The six perovskites of Cs2CuBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) and Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) are stable except for Cs2CuBiI6, and Cu in the octahedral coordination is less stable than Ag in the octahedral coordination. The reason will be discussed in the next section. The optimal pathway is 2A2M+M3+X6 → AM2+X3 + A3M23+X9, as shown in Fig. 12a.46 As a whole, only Cs2AgBiBr6 has been used in solar cell devices with the best PCE of 2.43%154 for s0 + s2 halides whose main issue is the indirect bandgap, which limits its application in solar cells.155

4.2 s0 + s0 halide double perovskites
s0 + s0 type halide double perovskites, such as Cs2AgInCl6 and its family, are compounds that have two cations at the B lattice site, with both having s0 electronic configurations. Cs2AgInCl6, a typical s0 + s0 type, is a direct bandgap perovskite with both the VBM and CBM located at the Γ point, as seen in Fig. 10d. In comparison to indirect bandgap Cs2AgBiBr6, the hybridization of the Cl-3px,y states and 4dx2−y2 states of In and Ag contributes to the VBM without the In 5s state, leading to a direct bandgap. The Cs2AgInCl6 family with the formula A2M+M3+X6 (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs; M+ = Cu+, Ag+, Au+; M3+ = Al3+, Ga3+, In3+, Tl3+; X = Cl, Br, I) is shown in Fig. 10a. Based on the screening criteria of the decomposition energy combined with the bandgap (ΔHD > 0 and 0.5 eV < Eg < 3.0 eV), (Fig. 10b), 13 halide double perovskites passed; among them, Rb2CuInCl6, Rb2AgInBr6, and Cs2AgInBr6 are identified as the potential solar cell materials with direct bandgaps of 1.36, 1.46, and 1.50 eV, respectively.156 In s0 + s0 type halide double perovskites, Cs2AgInCl6 is first synthesized and the absorbance spectra can be clearly recognized as the onset near 380 nm (3.3 eV) significantly different from its fundamental bandgap at around 608 nm (2.04 eV),47 as shown in Fig. 10c. The VBM has an Eg (Γ3+) representation at the Γ point with the contribution of Ag 4d orbitals, while the CBM has an A1g (Γ1+) representation due to the In 5s state and inversion symmetry, as shown in Fig. 10e.157 Because the VBM and CBM have the same even parity, the transition from the VBM to CBM at the Γ point is parity-forbidden. Therefore, Cs2AgInCl6 is inapplicable for solar cell absorber materials.

The stability of six Cs2M+InX6 (M+ = Ag+, Cu+; X = Cl, Br, I) halide double perovskites was also studied. The six perovskites except for Cs2CuInI6 are stable, with the decomposition energy (ΔHd) being positive when considering the common binary product pathway. However, only Cs2AgInCl6 is stable when considering the ternary product pathway, as shown in Fig. 12b. The results show that Cs2CuInX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) are less stable than Cs2AgInX6 (X = Cl, Br, I). The octahedral factors (μ) for Cu+ and In3+ are lower than the limit of 0.414, according to Pauling's first rule,158 indicating that [CuX6] and [InX6] (X = Br, I) octahedra with 6-fold coordination are unstable. Although the μ(Cu+) and μ(In3+) values are larger than 0.414, the instability of Cs2CuInCl6 can be explained by the fact that Cu–Cl preferably forms [CuCl4] tetrahedra with 4-fold coordination, but not 6-fold coordination as expected for [CuCl6] octahedra. In contrast, Ag–X (X = Cl, Br, I) can have both 6- and 4-fold coordination modes.159 This also can explain the result mentioned above in the s0 + s2 type halides section that Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) are more stable than the Cs2CuBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) counterparts.
4.3 s2 + s2 halide double perovskites
s2 + s2 type halide double perovskites, such as Cs2InBiCl6 and its family, indicate that the two cations at the B lattice site both have s2 electronic configurations. High-throughput calculations of 16 A2M+M3+X6 (A = Cs; M+ = In+, Tl+; M3+ = Sb3+, Bi3+; X = F, Cl, Br, I) were performed, and only two In-based compounds, Cs2InSbCl6 and Cs2InBiCl6, passed the screening criteria of decomposition energy (ΔHD > 0), bandgaps (0.8 eV < Eg < 2.0 eV), carrier effective masses (|m| < 1.0me), and exciton binding energy (ΔEb < 100 meV), as shown in Fig. 11a. To further consider the potential of the two compounds as solar cell absorbers, spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) simulations were performed. The results show that the SLMEs of these two halides (Cs2InSbCl6 and Cs2InBiCl6) are comparable to (or even better than) that of MAPbI3, as shown in Fig. 11b.160 Cs2InBiCl6 has a direct bandgap with the CBM derived from the Bi 6p and Cl 3p states, while the VBM is mainly derived from the In 5s and Cl 3p states. In addition, the CBM has a Γ4− representation at the Γ point, while the VBM has a Γ1+ representation at the same k point, leading to a allowed transition with a large transition matrix element (P2), as shown in Fig. 11c.157 In terms of photovoltaic properties, s2 + s2 type halide double perovskites are more suitable than s0 + s0 and s0 + s2 types.

((d–i) are reproduced with permission.50 Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society.) 
However, Cs2InBiCl6 exhibits instability when optimal decomposition pathways are considered. In general, a halide double perovskite is a quaternary compound and its phase diagram is a tetrahedron with the four vertexes of the four elementary substances. Take Cs2InBiCl6 for example; the four vertexes are Cs, In, Bi, and Cl, as shown in Fig. 12c.161,162 If only the non-redox dissociation pathways of Cs2InBiCl6 are considered, i.e., it happens in the red triangle plane with the three vertexes of CsCl, InCl, and BiCl3, the decomposition energies are still positive, indicating that Cs2InBiCl6 is stable. When redox pathways are considered as shown in the blue triangle plane (Fig. 12c), Cs2InBiCl6 can dissociate into Bi, Cs3In2Cl9 and Cs2Bi2Cl9 following the pathway Cs2InBiCl6 → 2/3Bi + 1/2Cs3In2Cl9 + 1/6Cs3Bi2Cl9, where In is in the 3+ charge state and the decomposition energy is negative, indicating that Cs2InBiCl6 is unstable due to the oxidation of In+ to In3+. Expanding to other halide double perovskites Cs2InM3+X6 (M3+ = Sb3+, Bi3+; X = Cl, Br, I), as shown in Fig. 12d, non-redox pathways are stable but redox pathways are unstable, suggesting that the In+-based double perovskites are unstable against the oxidation of In1+ to In3+ based compounds.49

Fr2InBiBr6 and Cs2TlBiBr6 have been taken as representative materials of s2 + s2 type halide double perovskites to study their defect properties. For Fr2InBiBr6, the defect formations cannot be efficiently adjusted by synthesis conditions due to quite a narrow chemical window, as shown in Fig. 11h. On one hand, at the A point (Br-poor conditions), the defect formation energies for VIn and InBi in Fr2InBiBr6 are very small or even negative (Fig. 11i), implying that these defects can be spontaneously formed. This would lead to a phase decomposition or metallic p-type conductor, which is not suitable for solar cell applications. On the other hand, the high density of the deep InBi level (Fig. 11g) would cause significant nonradiative carrier recombination, which is detrimental for the carrier lifetime and VOC. For Cs2TlBiBr6, the chemical window is larger than that for Fr2InBiBr6, as shown in Fig. 11e. At the chemical potential of the F point (Br-rich conditions), Cs2TlBiBr6 exhibits the same instability as Fr2InBiBr6 with negative formation energies of VTl and TlBi, leading to a p-type acceptor, as shown in Fig. 11f. However, at the A point (Br-poor conditions), VTl and VBr are the two dominant defects due to their lower formation energies, which is pinned at the Fermi level (EF) of 0.52 eV above the VBM, implying a weak p-type conduction, as shown in Fig. 11f. TlBi and BiTl might create deep states in the bandgap (Fig. 11d), but these defects have relatively large formation energies so that they will not produce a large population to deteriorate the photovoltaic properties.50 Therefore, attention should be paid to the chemical potential of Br in the synthesis process of Cs2TlBiBr6 to optimize the photovoltaic performance. From the defect property aspect, Tl-based halide double perovskites are more suitable than In-based ones for solar cell applications. Nevertheless, Tl faces the problem of toxicity.
4.4 Halide double perovskite alloys
As discussed above, s0 + s2 type halide double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 has an indirect and large bandgap (∼1.9 eV) which is not suitable for single-junction solar cell absorbers. However, its bandgap could be engineered by controlling the ordering parameters, as shown in Fig. 13a. Yang et al.51 reported that Cs2AgBiBr6 can vary continuously from a large indirect bandgap of 1.93 eV for the fully ordered double perovskite structure to a small pseudo-direct bandgap of 0.44 eV for the fully random alloy structure using the special quasi-random structures (SQS) approach.163 Another s0 + s2 type halide double perovskite, Cs2AgSbCl6, exhibits an indirect bandgap which will cause weak optical absorption. Substituting In3+ for some Sb3+ in Cs2AgSbCl6 to form Cs2AgSb1−xInxCl6 alloy (0 < x < 1) is an effective way to solve the issue of indirect bandgaps. The alloys gradually transit from indirect to direct bandgaps upon increasing the In ratio x in Cs2AgSb1−xInxCl6, and the turning point is at x = 0.6,53 as shown in Fig. 13b. Similar bandgap type transformations also happen in Cs2AgBi1−xInxCl6 alloys.164 Although s0 + s0 type halide double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6 exhibits a direct bandgap, parity-forbidden transition impedes its development in solar cell application. In the same way, replacing some Ag+ with Na+ in Cs2AgInCl6 to form Cs2Ag1−xNaxInCl6 alloy can make dipole forbidden transition in Cs2AgInCl6 become dipole allowed.54 As shown in Fig. 13c, we can clearly see that with the increase of Na content, the transition dipole moment first increases and then decreases and reaches maximum at x = 0.40 with the formula Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6. The allowed transition dipole moment can be explained by the fact that Na incorporation breaks the inversion symmetry of the Cs2AgInCl6 lattice, with the electron wavefunction at the Ag site changing from symmetric to asymmetric, as shown in Fig. 13c.1. The ascending process is ascribed to the enhanced electron and hole orbital overlap as the spatial distribution of the self-trapped excitons (STEs) is confined in the surroundings of newly formed [NaCl6] octahedra, as shown in Fig. 13c.2. For Narich with the [Na/(Na + Ag)] ratio >40%, the electrons derived from Cl 3p and In 5s remain strongly confined within a single [InCl6] octahedron, while the holes derived from Cl 3p and Ag 4d are always distributed in the [AgCl6] octahedra, as shown in Fig. 13c.3. As a result, the orbital spatial overlap between electrons and holes for the STEs decreases, leading to a significant reduction of the transition dipole moment. In summary, the bandgap (indirect or direct) and transition dipole moment (optical absorption properties or photoluminescence properties) could be engineered by the alloy strategy.

5 A2M3+M5+Y6 chalcogenide double perovskites
All possible chalcogenide double perovskites A2M3+M5+Y6, where A, M3+, M5+ and Y have 32, 53, 27, and 3 elemental kinds, are shown in Fig. 14. There are a stunning total of 137376 combinations including 91353 (46023) kinds with (without) rare earth metal. They can be classified into s0 + s2 type and rare-earth type systems.
 Fig. 14  The elements considered in A2M3+M5+Y6 chalcogenide double perovskites with A, M5+, M3+ and Y sites marked in light blue, green, brown and red, respectively. If one element is half-colored or one third colored, it means that it can sit at two or three sites. 
In order to introduce the lone pair s electronic configuration in chalcogenide perovskites, we chose CaTiO3 as a prototype and designed new materials via mutation of 2Ti4+ → M3+ + M5+, where M3+ has the lone pair s electronic state. In this way, eighteen oxide double perovskites A2M3+M5+O6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; M3+ = Sb3+, Bi3+; M5+ = V5+, Nb5+, Ta5+) were constructed and systematically investigated as potential photovoltaic materials based on the screening criteria of bandgaps, thermodynamic stability and dynamic stability, optical absorption and SLMEs. Unfortunately, none of those eighteen perovskites meet the criterion of an optimal bandgap range (1.0–1.6 eV); thus, a solid solution of Ba2SbV0.5Ta0.5O6 was proposed as a potential photovoltaic material having comparable efficiency with MAPbI3. The common nine single oxide perovskites all exist as perovskite phases, while of the six oxide double perovskites synthesized by experiments, five (Ba2BiVO6, Ca2BiNbO6, Ba2BiNbO6, Ca2BiTaO6, and Ba2BiTaO6) have perovskite phases, as shown in Fig. 15.

The experimental data is provided for comparison. ‘✓’ indicates that the compounds can be found as perovskite phases in experiments. ‘✗’ indicates that the compounds cannot be found as perovskite phases in any experiments. ‘?’ means the compounds are not reported by experiments.

Due to the low energy level of the O 2p orbital, the bandgaps of the oxides are generally larger than optimal bandgaps for solar cell absorbers. Under Bi-rich and Nb-poor conditions, the Bi/Nb alloy Ba2Bi1+xNb1−xO6 can be synthesized in off stoichiometry and exhibits a significantly reduced bandgap because its CBM is derived from the unoccupied Bi 6s orbital (Bi5+), which is lower than the CBM of Ba2BiNbO6, which is contributed by unoccupied Nb 4d and Bi 6p orbitals. Therefore, Ba2Bi1+xNb1−xO6 has a suitable bandgap for efficient water-splitting applications due to the coexistence of Bi3+ and Bi5+ cations.59 In addition, Ge et al. prepared Ba2Bi(Bi0.6,Nb0.4)O6 with a narrowed bandgap of 1.62 eV under Bi-rich conditions, and the fabricated Ba2Bi(Bi0.6,Nb0.4)O6 photoelectrodes can produce cathodic photocurrents up to 0.2 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE with positive onsets at ∼1.5 VRHE, enabling unbiased water reduction.60 Substituting S or Se for O is another way to reduce the bandgaps due to the higher 3p or 4p orbital energy than the O 2p orbital energy; thus, a class of chalcogenide double perovskites A2M3+M5+Y6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; M3+ = Bi3+, Sb3+; M5+ = V5+, Nb5+, Ta5+; Y = S, Se) are comprehensively investigated with respect to their stabilities and electronic and optical properties.55 A2M3+M5+Y6 can be considered as the chemical mutation of B-site cations based on BaZrS3, i.e., 2Zr4+ → M3+ + M5+, as can be seen in Fig. 16g. On one hand, BaZrS3 is stable in the pnma phase with the a−b+a− Glazer notation at room temperature. The same Glazer notation of double perovskites shows the P21/n phase.165,166 On the other hand, the P21/n and R phases are the common phases in oxide double perovskites; for example, Ba2CoNbO6 and Ba2CeIrO6 are in P21/n phases, while Ba2BiNbO6 and Ba2BiTaO6 are in R phases.58 Therefore, two distorted perovskite phases with P21/n and R space groups, shown in Fig. 16a–f, are adopted to study the optoelectronic properties and thermodynamic stability of 36 chalcogenide A2M3+M5+X6 compounds.55 Through the criteria of combining the decomposition energies (ΔHD) in common binary compound pathways and bandgaps, three chalcogenide double perovskites (Ba2BiTaSe6, Ba2BiNbS6, and Ba2SbTaS6) with the R phase, and six ones (Ba2BiTaS6, Ba2BiNbS6, Ba2SbTaS6, Sr2BiTaS6, Sr2BiNbS6, and Sr2SbTaS6) with the P21/n phase were selected as potential candidates for solar cell absorbers, as shown in Fig. 16h. By considering eleven more pathways including redox reaction, the most likely compound is Ba2BiNbS6, with its decomposition energies of 0 and −22 meV per atom for the P21/n and R phases, respectively, which may be further stabilized by the confinement effect in the nanocrystal form.

6 Materials genome and machine learning
DFT calculations are usually limited to several hundred atoms, and high-throughput DFT calculations often involve a search space of hundreds or thousands of materials. Thus, to accelerate materials discovery, materials genome and machine learning are necessary for materials screening and design.167 Descriptors, usually simple analytical forms correlating structure (composition) and properties, play significant roles in materials design. Perovskites with the general formula ABX3, where A and B are cations and X is the anion, are among the most well-known crystal structures. Using the ionic radii of ions A, B, and X based on geometrical considerations, the tolerance factor t is defined with the expression , which is a common descriptor of perovskite stability. A stable perovskite material usually has 0.8 < t < 1. Although proposed by Goldschmidt a century ago,61t has recently played an important role in engineering stable halide perovskite solar cells. Take APbI3 as an example; in order to obtain a stable perovskite phase, one can mix FA (t(FAPbI3) > 1 and FAPbI3 is stable in a hexagonal phase) with Cs (t(CsPbI3) < 0.8 and CsPbI3 is stable in an orthorhombic phase), leading to the t located in the range of 0.8 < t < 1.0, as shown in Fig. 17b.168 This finding suggests a relatively flexible [BX6] framework in which lattice strain can be balanced by choosing the right A-site cations, mixing A-site cations, or mixing anions. Saliba et al.7,169 made a mixture of multiple cations such as Rb, Cs, MA, and FA to effectively tune the t of APbI3, and obtained cell efficiencies up to 21.6% with good stability. Notably, the best certified perovskite solar cell efficiencies in the NREL efficiency chart were reported for those based on mixed perovskites, indicating the crucial importance of tuning t for stable and high efficiency perovskite solar cells.8,170

Recently, the predicting power of the tolerance factor has been challenged. Travis et al. found that many ABX3 compounds in the range of 0.8 < t < 1.0 are not perovskites and perovskites can also exist out of the range of 0.8 < t < 1.0.171 Previously, Li et al.166,172 introduced a (μ,t) map, where μ is the octahedral factor defined as μ = rB/rX, where rB and rX are the ionic radii of the B and X, as shown in Fig. 17a. We used high-throughput calculations to investigate the stability of 138 perovskites including halide single, halide double, chalcogenide single, and chalcogenide double perovskites. As shown in a (μ,t) map (Fig. 17c), the stable (red dot) and unstable (black dot) perovskites are well separated by blue dashed lines, which divide the (μ,t) map into two regions. Almost all the experimentally reported non-perovskite phases are located in the black dot region. Meanwhile, almost all the experimentally reported perovskite phases are located in the red dot region. The theoretical results are in great agreement with available experiments. In order to give a quantitative description of stability, it was also found that, as a stability descriptor, (μ + t)η, where η is the atomic packing fraction, provides a linear correlation with the calculated decomposition energy (ΔHD) and the ability to predict the stability of perovskites with ∼90% accuracy, as shown in Fig. 17d.62
Descriptors such as t and (μ + t)η are empirical parameters relating structure (composition) to properties. Such a kind of relationship can be established by machine learning (ML) techniques in a more accurate way. For example, Bartel et al.63 proposed a new tolerance factor τ which has the form of , where nA is the oxidation state of A, encompassing both halide and oxide perovskites using SISSO173 feature selection. τ was used to classify stable perovskites and non-perovskites in an experimental data set of 576 ABX3, which achieved an accuracy of 92%, according to the criteria of τ < 4.18, as shown in Fig. 18b. Learning from a data set of 185 experimentally known ABX3 halide perovskites with support vector machine (SVM) based classifiers, Pilania et al.64 built the best performing model and achieved an accuracy of >92% in identifying the formability of perovskites, which requires only four ionic radius related features, namely rA, rB, μ, and t, implying that the steric and geometric packing effects govern the stability of halide perovskites. Li et al.65 generated 354 data of high-throughput DFT-calculated decomposition energies of halide double perovskites, and trained the data using the Kernel ridge regression (KRR) models. The best model achieved a root mean-square-error (RMSE) of 34 meV per atom on the testing set and 93% accuracy using the ionic radius-related descriptors constructed by rA, rB1, rB2, and rX, which perform better than τ and (μ + t)η. The results indicate that ML is an effective and efficient approach to predict unexplored perovskites.

Apart from stability, training and prediction of perovskite bandgaps were also investigated in the ML method. Im et al.66 calculated the formation energies and bandgaps of 540 halide double perovskites and subsequently trained the DFT-calculated data to build gradient boosting regression (GBR) models, achieving RMSEs of 21 meV per atom for formation energy, and 0.223 eV for the PBE-bandgap. Other electron-related features such as the lowest unoccupied atomic level, electronegativity, and orbital radii are also required for the bandgap training model. The results showed that the space group of crystal was the most important one among all the seven features considered. Lu et al.67 used a gradient boosting regression (GBR) algorithm with 14 selected material features (Table 2) to train the bandgaps of 212 hybrid perovskites. The study showed that the tolerance factor was the most important feature on the bandgap. Then, they predicted 5158 unexplored possible hybrid perovskites and identified six ones in the orthorhombic phase with suitable bandgaps for solar cell applications. Agiorgousis et al.68 used random forest (RF) and SVM classifiers with three element features, namely ionization potential, Pauling's electronegativity, and atomic radius, to train the HSE06 bandgaps of 220 chalcogenide double perovskites. Among the 450 possible chalcogenide double perovskites, six perovskites such as Ba2AlNbS6, Ba2GaNbS6, Ca2GaNbS6, Sr2InNbS6, and Ba2SnHfS6 are identified as potential solar cell materials. Pilania et al.174 used the KRR model with 16 selected features to train the bandgaps of 1306 unique oxide double perovskites, and the best model achieved an RMSE of 0.36 eV. Recently, the same group69 improved the model through a multi-fidelity co-kriging statistical learning framework, where the PBE bandgaps of 599 inorganic halide double perovskites and HSE06 bandgaps (250 of the 599 perovskites) are considered as low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, respectively. They got mean absolute error (MAE) that decreased from 0.45 to 0.10 eV by adjusting the ratio of low and high fidelity data from P1 to P6 in the training set, as shown in Fig. 18a. More recently, Chen et al.175 combined thermodynamic stability and bandgaps into a unified figure of merit and used Bayesian optimization (BO) (the schematics are shown in Fig. 18c) with 14 features to accelerate materials screening. The results show that BO based on the unified figure of merit is more efficient in screening optimal candidates compared to an exhaustive search via multiple parameters. The current study is more focused on the relationships between material features (structural and compositional features) and material properties (formability, stability, bandgap) in ML approaches, which are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, and it is expected that other photovoltaic properties such as optical absorption coefficients and carrier effective mass will also be studied using ML techniques.

7 Conclusions
We have reviewed recent progress in the high-throughput calculations and theoretical studies of perovskites as potential solar cell absorbers. The perovskite candidates in the literature have been categorized into four classes: AM2+X3 halide single perovskites, AM4+Y3 chalcogenide single perovskites, A2M+M3+X6 halide double perovskites, and A2M3+M5+Y6 chalcogenide double perovskites. The stability, electronic, optical, and defect properties, as well as their applicability as solar cell absorbers, are extensively discussed for each class of these perovskites. So far, s2 type halide single perovskites have remained the best candidates for solar cell applications, although their phase stability and thermodynamic stability are the main challenges. Each class of halide double perovskites has its own shortcomings, and the solid solution method provides a possible solution. Some chalcogenide single perovskites and s0 + s2 type oxide double perovskites are more stable than halides, but their materials properties are generally inferior to those of s2 type halide single perovskites for solar cell applications. We also show that by carefully constructing descriptors using materials genome and/or machine learning techniques, it is possible to greatly accelerate the discovery of new stable and high efficiency perovskites for solar cell and other optoelectronic applications.
