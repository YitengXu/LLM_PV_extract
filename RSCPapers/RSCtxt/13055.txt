    , Accepted 5th February 2021First published on 5th February 2021AbstractHybrid lead halide perovskites will potentially lead the future energy scenario if highly efficient cells have long-term stability. Here we combine state-of-the art mixed-cation formulations containing formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA), with optimal guanidinium (Gua)/Cs ratios, enabling the realization of cells providing stability at their maximum efficiency.
Hybrid lead halide perovskites (APbX3) are attracting great attention as promising candidates for near future solar power generation.1 Their excellent optoelectronic properties combined with their low material cost, ease of manufacturing and remarkable flexibility in the lattice structure have opened a plethora of possibilities in crystal design.2–5 In particular, mixed compositions containing MA/FA cations6 and Br−/I− halides have constantly led to superior performances compared to single cation perovskites, enabling an impressive evolution of record efficiencies since their first use in photovoltaics. However, mixed compositions suffer from severe changes in the crystal structure and film morphology under light and bias, with phase segregation and reconversion to the initial precursors7 limiting the materials' long-term stability.4 In addition, photoinduced burn-in decay is often observed at the first stage of device operation, becoming an ineluctable barrier to achieve stability at the highest efficiency. Despite the precise mechanisms ruling such fast degradation being still unknown, recent investigations draw attention to crystal defects associated with (i) A-cation migrations; (ii) the type of charge selective contacts and interlayers, and (iii) the electromigration of charge defects to the interface.8–10 This has led to intensive research using passivation strategies involving 3D/2D bilayer structures,11–14 ionic liquid additives15,16 or the use of alternative mixtures.
In this context, several investigations suggest the incorporation of highly symmetric guanidinium (CH6N3+, Gua) as an ideal cation providing reduced non-radiative recombination and enhanced thermal resistance, induced by the formation of numerous hydrogen bonds. Despite most of the studies employing Gua as a crosslinker additive between the neighbouring perovskite grains,17,18 in 2017 Jodlowski et al. reported mixed-cation MA1−xGuaxPbI3 perovskites containing Gua in their lattice structure (x < 0.2), demonstrating a direct relation between the x content and the long-term resistance of the cell.19,20 Unfortunately, this cannot be directly applied to the state-of-the-art mixed compositions, FA1−xMAxPbBryI1−y, as Gua/FA 3D-phases are thermodynamically unstable.21,22 In an attempt to stabilize the structure, very few reports have recently focused on incorporating Gua into triple cation Cs0.1(FA0.83MA0.17)0.9Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskites, named CsFAMA,23–25 suggesting improved performance for Gua contents below 10%. However, in these types of compositions discrepancies are still evident as it is unclear which is the optimal ratio providing the best performance, whether or not phase segregation takes place, or if improved stability does certainly occur during device operation. Indeed, there are no reports demonstrating standard aging protocols showing long-term stability under operating conditions (≥1000 hours, continuous light and bias). Instead, most of them rely on devices stored (i) in the dark, (ii) disconnected under light illumination, or (iii) in various different environments, hindering an appropriate comparison with state-of-the-art high efficiency materials.24
In this study we describe the interplay between Cs and the photophysical properties of mixed-cation mixed-halide FA0.79MA0.16Gua0.05Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite (abbreviated as FAMAGua) based on structural and optical characterization. We demonstrate that a quadruple cation perovskite, Csx(FAMAGua)1−x, is successfully formed, and phase segregation is suppressed, by fine-tuning the Cs content, providing a single high-quality crystalline film with improved performance. Using the optimal composition, FAMAGua cells exhibited a remarkable increase in the photovoltage of 50 mV, and reproducible PCEs of ∼20%. We combined these results with the maximum power point (MPP) tracking test to derive a comprehensive picture of the compositional effects. Importantly, we find that the Cs content is critical for long-term stability, and has a direct impact on suppressing the initial burn-in decay typical of these devices. This enabled the preparation of robust burn-in loss-free PSCs retaining 93% their initial efficiency after 1000 hours of real operation (ISO-L-1 test).26 We note that these results could be further improved by implementing the latest reported strategies employed for defect passivation, including the use of 3D/2D bilayers or additive engineering, already implemented in the record-breaking CsFAMA systems.

Fig. 1a–c show the UV-visible absorption spectra of mixed cation Csx(FAMAGua)1−x perovskite films containing different % of Cs (from 0 to 50%). Compared to the state-of-the-art CsFAMA, used as the reference, FAMAGua presents a much lower absorption in the complete visible spectrum, with an absorption band edge located at ∼1.59 eV, and a small shoulder (∼540 nm) suggesting the presence of unreacted PbI2. As we introduce Cs into the system, the typical absorption features corresponding to the dark reference material arise, becoming comparable for Cs contents between 10% and 20%. At the same time, we observe a gradual blue-shift at the absorption onset from 1.59 eV to 1.63 eV (see Fig. 1b). Because changes in the bandgap can relate to local distortions induced by the different A-cations, this gradual change denotes crystal strains induced by the insertion of smaller size caesium. Interestingly, further Cs increments (x ≥ 0.3) produce a lowering of the light absorption capacity along with the emergence of an intense transition band below ∼430 nm. This is concomitant with a significant bandgap shift to lower energy (1.58 eV), which suggests a rearrangement of the crystal structure for x > 0.3, and its segregation into several crystal phases (confirmed by XRD, Fig. 2). The normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the several films, including the reference CsFAMA, are reported in Fig. 1c. In agreement with the trends previously observed, a gradual blue-shift in the PL peak, indicative of a progressive widening of the bandgap, takes place upon incorporating 20% of caesium, Cs0.2(FAMAGua)0.8, but it unexpectedly reverses for contents higher than x > 0.3 (see the inset, top). Consequently, the best optical properties (i.e. high absorption capacity) are obtained for Csx(FAMAGua)1−x systems containing 0 < x < 0.3. In addition, the time resolved PL decay for these films (see the inset, bottom) showed comparable exponential decays but a slight increase in the PL lifetime for a larger Cs content, indicative of reduced trap-mediated recombination for x = 0.2. All these changes are consistent with a material transition happening for >20% content. For lower values, the layers change gradually with the material composition and exhibit a very similar morphology and grain distribution (see top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 1d).

To gain insight into the crystalline structure, we conducted X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of films containing mixed Csx(FAMAGua)1−x systems with different x values, including CsFAMA perovskite as the reference. All the films exhibit the typical diffraction peaks characteristic of a triple cation 3D-CsFAMA perovskite, and an additional diffraction signal at ∼12.8° related to unreacted PbI2. We note here that the film based on FAMAGua (x = 0) also contains multiple diffractions located at lower angles (2θ < 12°), due to the coexistence of several crystalline phases in the film. Such phases, identified as the non-perovskite hexagonal δ-FAPbI3 and 2D-FAGAPbI4 (ref. 21) (see the magnified picture of the 2θ region between 7° and 13.5° in Fig. 2b), are detected only for the FAMAGua (x = 0) system, and they disappear as soon as we incorporate a small amount of Cs into the system. This explains the lower UV-visible absorption of FAMAGua previously observed, and its drastic change once caesium is incorporated (see Fig. 1a). A closer inspection of the signal (Fig. 2c) reveals a gradual shift of the main reflexion peak (∼14.1°) to higher 2θ values, becoming narrower and gaining intensity, up to 20% content. In contrast, larger Cs amounts (x > 0.3) cause the segregation of CsPbX3 phases27 (peaks at ∼10° and 13.15°) and a shift in the 3D-reflections back to the initial position (see Fig. 2c). This is consistent with the intense absorption in the high-energy region (<430 nm) detected for films with x = 0.3 and 0.5, as typically observed in low-temperature CsPbX3 phases.27 Therefore, by fine-tuning the Cs content between 0 < x < 0.3 we can successfully suppress phase segregation in FAMAGua mixtures. The changes observed here are concomitant with a decrease in the peak broadening illustrated in Fig. 1d, which summarizes the evolution of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the ∼14° peak (see Fig. S1 for further details†).
The stability of the tetra-cation perovskite toward phase separation into pure perovskite phases was evaluated by computing the Gibbs free energy of mixing, comprising both enthalpic (ΔHmix) and entropic (ΔSmix) contributions (see the ESI for details†). A structural model of a cubic perovskite, containing 3 × 3 × 3 primitive unit cells, was constructed, keeping the I:Br ratio fixed to 0.83:0.17 (Fig. 2e). Using this model, we simulated the incorporation of Cs into two series of structures, with guanidinium contents of 3.7 and 7.4%, as presented in Fig. S2† and 2f respectively. Interestingly, the calculations show that Cs-free FAMAGua mixtures lead to less stable structures while the incorporation of Cs stabilizes the tetra-cation perovskite phase, achieving slightly better stability for 7.4% Gua content. This provides additional support to our previous assignment, suggesting that guanidinium incorporation can be a fine-tuning mechanism for perovskite stabilization by additionally mixing with Cs. Interestingly, increasing Cs leads to an overall more compact structure, reducing local strains and providing a more homogeneous perovskite morphology, as evidenced by the decrease of partial cell volume parameters shown in Fig. S3.† Indeed, the evolution of tolerance factors upon Cs incorporation, summarized in Table S1,† evidences not only the possibility of incorporating larger cations, such as Gua, into the perovskite structure, but also that a higher number of various monovalent cations enable even stronger stabilization due to the increase of configurational entropy contribution. In contrast, high Cs concentrations promote phase segregation within the cubic perovskite phases, as previously modelled28 within DFT.
We investigated the photovoltaic properties of Csx(FAMAGua)1−x systems by preparing conventional n–i–p devices using FTO/mesoporous (mp)-TiO2/SnO2 as the electron transporting material, and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole selecting layer, followed by 80 nm of gold. Fig. 3a shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves for perovskites with x values 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.3, measured under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) (see photovoltaic parameters summarized in the inset). We note that despite these samples differing in their structural and optical properties, all the cells exhibit very good performances, with PCE values that are comparable to those of the state-of-the art CsFAMA reference. A similar short circuit current (Jsc) over 23 mA cm−2, and comparable fill factor (FF) of ∼0.74 are obtained for the three systems, but stronger differences appear in the open circuit voltage (Voc). Compared to 1.09 V obtained for the mixed CsFAMA reference, Gua based systems exhibit values close to 1.14 V in all cases, as expected from the optical bandgap observations. Despite the photovoltaic parameters hardly changing between samples, the results slightly deteriorate for mixtures with larger caesium contents. There is indeed a considerable gain in hysteresis (h) between the forward–reverse J–V scans for x = 0.3, which double its value compared to those obtained for a lower Cs content (see Fig. S4†). This behaviour might be related to the phase-segregation and reduced crystallinity detected for x > 0.3. An initial MPP tracking test under continuous AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) is reported in Fig. S5.† The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is also illustrated in Fig. 3b. All cells provide high photon-to-current conversion over 90% throughout the entire visible spectrum. Interestingly, while only a few differences appear in the integrated current density (J0.1 ≈ J0.2 > J0.3), a clear trend becomes evident in the photocurrent onset with increasing % Cs, consistent with the change of bandgap (see Fig. 3c). As a result, cell efficiencies of 20.2% (Jsc = 23.64 mA cm−2; Voc = 1.142 V; FF = 0.748, h = 4.3%) and 19.8% (Jsc = 23.24 mA cm−2; Voc = 1.147 V; FF = 0.745, h = 5.2%), were obtained for CsFAMAGua containing 10 and 20% caesium (see statistical analysis in Fig. 3d).

We further evaluated the long-term stability of the cells. We note that achieving good stability alongside high PCE has been to date very problematic, as PSCs usually suffer from a rapid burn-in degradation before stabilizing under operational conditions. Here, we have evaluated device stability in two different environments: (i) devices kept in air without any light or bias; and (ii) devices under continuous light soaking at MPP tracking. Fig. 4a shows the photovoltaic stability of non-encapsulated cells stored in dark air for 4000 h, measured periodically under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2). Despite small differences in efficiency being identified in the first stage of the test, the devices are very stable over time and perform very similarly independent of the Cs content. The three photovoltaic curves almost overlap, maintaining nearly 100% the initial efficiency after such a long period. These results could bring the conclusion that Cs, as well as the phase stabilization previously described, has no impact on the material's stability. But a very different scenario emerges under real stress conditions. Fig. 4b summarizes the device performance of Csx(FAMAGua)1−x cells measured under AM 1.5G sun illumination with MPP tracking (cells containing CsFAMA and FAMAGua are also included for the analysis). Contrary to what is expected, the test reveals very strong correlations between the caesium content and device stability. The stabilized regions in MPP tracking tests are usually preceded by rapid initial burn-in decay, which ultimately makes the highest contribution to the PCE drop (>90% of the total degradation). However, an optimal combination of Cs and Gua can suppress this burn-in region (see magnified Fig. 4b). In our case, CsFAMA cells suffer from very fast degradation under continuous light soaking and bias, as typically reported in the literature, with 35% of their initial efficiency lost within the first 25 h. If we exchange Cs with Gua, the process slows down up to 400 h (see Fig. 4). Such a remarkable difference is nevertheless insufficient, as both cells retain less than 60% their initial PCE after 1000 h of the test. However, by introducing both Cs and Gua into FAMAGua (x = 0.1), the loss in PCE drastically changes, and reduces to 8% for the first 25 h. This is followed by a stabilized region up to the end of the experiment, providing a final drop in PCE of only 20% (1000 h under operation). Interestingly, further Cs increments (x = 0.2) stabilizes the device even more, reducing the PCE loss in the burn-in region to a remarkable 4%. This enables the fabrication of very stable PSCs with less than 8% drop after 1000 h of operation (see also the extended test in Fig. S6†).

We also investigated the carrier dynamics of the cells after aging for 500 h. Although the absorption spectra did not show significant changes (Fig. S7†), the PL decay kinetics was more sensitive to aging. This suggests that the decrease in the device efficiency is most likely not related to the perovskite decomposition, but could result from the deteriorated charge carrier transport at the surface or in the bulk.29 As presented in Fig. 4c, the PL decay in the FAMAGua system becomes faster with time, but it is less sensitive to aging as we introduce caesium, showing the most stable behavior in samples with 20% content. The calculated average PL lifetimes are summarized in Table S3.† Almost three times accelerated PL decay in FAMAGua devices indicates that non-radiative recombination increases considerably over time. The perovskite aging can cause changes in bulk material properties, as well as at the interfaces between the perovskite and carrier transport layers. Considering that all devices are of the same structure, and the only difference is in the perovskite composition, the decrease in the PL lifetime during FAMAGua aging is likely due to disturbed charge carrier transport within the bulk rather than being associated with the light induced chemical changes at the interfaces. Moreover, similar PL decay trends were also observed in perovskite films deposited on glass substrates (see Fig. S8†), further confirming that film aging causes the formation of an increased concentration of non-radiative recombination centers within the bulk. Given that all perovskites have identical transport layers, we expect that the electron trapping process mainly determines the acceleration of the PL lifetimes.30–32 We note that among the large number of defect types, the deep level defects at the grain boundaries are the main trap sources deteriorating charge carrier motion and limiting device performance.33,34 It therefore shows that under the real stress conditions the increase of non-radiative recombination sites in FAMAGua might be associated with imperfections within the crystal lattice, as we already confirmed in XRD analyses. These imperfections could induce lattice strains governing crystal defects and thus enhance non-radiative carrier recombination.35 Because the strains trigger defect formation under light illumination, this could also be the reason for the increased ion migration, thus contributing to perovskite degradation.36 Interestingly, the incorporation of caesium relaxes lattice strains, thereby increasing defect formation energies and reducing defect concentrations.37,38 Moreover, the PL lifetimes suggest that non-radiative processes are suppressed upon reaching 20% of caesium in the FAMAGua system. This also well correlates with the SEM images where the perovskite containing 20% of Cs has the largest crystals.
As our voltage-dependent transient photocurrent measurements show (see Fig. S9†), the photocurrent relaxation dynamics is very similar in all perovskite systems and does not show significant differences over time. Upon sample excitation with low intensity laser pulses, the concentration of photogenerated charges decreases due to trapping or carrier extraction at the respective electrodes. As we mentioned above, the photoluminescence dynamics is mainly dominated by carrier trapping kinetics with a trapping time of tens of ns; thus the photocurrent decay kinetics mainly reflect carrier transfer from the perovskite to transporting materials. This additionally suggests that the carrier trapping in the FAMAGua perovskite is relatively deep with high activation energy, and thus the trapped carriers will annihilate or recombine non-radiatively by the Shockley–Read–Hall process. Based on these considerations we argue that charge carrier trapping in the deep trap sites is the main factor limiting long-term device performance.
Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the effect of caesium on the structural properties and photovoltaic performance of Gua based perovskites. By using molar concentrations of Cs below 30%, we can suppress inherent phase segregation observed in mixed Csx(FAMAGua)1−x perovskites, promoting the formation of a homogeneous material with very good photo-electronic behaviour. We demonstrate for the first time that caesium not only behaves as an ideal blender, but combined with Gua provides a material with unprecedented resistance, suppressing the burn-in decay characteristic of perovskite devices. This enables the realization of cells providing stability at their maximum efficiency, one critical aspect to ensure the future development of this technology.
