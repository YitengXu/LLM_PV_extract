    , Accepted 9th December 2022First published on 10th December 2022AbstractInterface engineering is a necessary process to achieve enhanced device performance in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we report a facile and low-cost approach using zinc acetylacetonate (ZnAcac, ZAA) to dope perylene diimides functionalized with amino oxide (PDINO) as an improved cathode interface layer (CIL) for OSCs. In contrast to the pristine PDINO CIL, the PDINO + ZAA CIL exhibit lower electron affinity level and improved conductivity due to electron transfer between PDINO and ZAA. As a result, OSCs with PDINO + ZAA CIL deliver higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and exhibit less efficiency decay with thicker CIL than the OSCs with PDINO CIL. With 10 nm PDINO + ZAA as the CIL, the typical PM6:BTP-eC9 OSCs can achieve an enhanced average PCE of 17.1% than PDINO OSC (16.4%), mainly due to less charge recombination and improved charge extraction and transport ability in devices. A good PCE of 15.4% can be still maintained with 70 nm CIL. Our results prove that PDINO + ZAA is a high-quality CIL and provide a simple and low-cost interface engineering strategy to optimize the CILs in OSCs.
Introduction
In organic solar cells (OSCs), a cathode interface layer (CIL) is often introduced between the active layer and cathode to enhance electron collection and block holes.1–4 The CIL is not an essential part in early OSCs, yet it has been asserted to play a vital role in realizing high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).5–7 Representative CILs have been steadily developed to improve the PCE of OSCs, such as alcohol-soluble polymers (e.g., PFN,8 PNDIT-F3N9), small molecules (such as perylene diimides with N-oxide (PDINO),10 PDINN11), metal oxides or metal salts (e.g., ZnO,12 LiF13), carbon-based materials (e.g., graphene derivatives14) and other inorganic compounds (e.g., ZrAcac15). Although a number of CILs have been applied in OSCs, novel cathode interface materials with superior properties such as lower energy levels and higher electron mobilities are still being explored to further boost the performance of OSCs.
In addition to exploiting novel CIL materials, fine-tuning existing materials is also an effective strategy for promoting device performance.16–18 PDINO is a typical small molecule electrolyte which is frequently employed as a CIL in conventional OSCs due to the smooth morphology, good alcohol-solubility, easy accessibility with high yields and low cost.10,19,20 However, PDINO devices often showed substantial interface recombination loss for high performance OSCs, limiting the devices to achieve an optimal efficiency.11,21,22 Pan et al. dispersed graphene in PDINO to obtain a n-doped PDINO-G CIL, yielding an enhanced PCE of 16.52% in PM6:Y6 OSCs compared to 15.32% in PDINO devices.23 Chen et al. developed a blend film with polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) doped PDINO as the CIL. PDINO:PEIE enables PM6:Y6:PC71BM OSCs with a higher PCE (16.06%) than that of PDINO (15.22%).24 Li et al. discovered the boron cores of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF) can interact with N-oxide of PDINO to form PDINO-BCF-H2O/methanol complexes. The D18:Y6 OSCs with PDINO + 2%BCF CIL delivered a higher PCE (18.1%) than PDINO devices (17.1%).25
Metal complexes of acetylacetone are often commercially available with low cost, and exhibit good solubility in solvents. ZrAcac,15,26 Al(acac)3,27 Hf(Acac)428 and RuAcac29 have been reported as CILs in OSCs and perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In addition, TiO (Acac)230 was used to modify TiO2 nano-particles (NPs) to obtain a dense CIL in PSCs for enhancing charge extraction. Zinc acetylacetonate (ZnAcac, ZAA) has been used as a precursor for zinc oxide CILs deposition,31,32 but rarely as a CIL material in OSCs.33 ZAA shows very weak absorption in the visible light range and possesses good alcohol solubility with low cost, which might be a promising CIL or CIL doping material.
Herein, we developed a ZAA doped PDINO film (PDINO + ZAA) as a CIL for efficient conventional OSCs. Owing to the interaction between acac− in ZAA and N-oxide in PDINO, PDINO + ZAA with the optimized 5 wt% doping ratio exhibits stronger electron transfer than PDINO, resulting in higher conductivity and more suitable energy level. With PDINO + ZAA CIL, OSCs deliver enhanced PCEs with superior open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), and exhibit lower sensitivity to the CIL thickness variation. The PM6:BTP-eC9 devices with PDINO + ZAA can achieve enhanced PCEs up to 17.4%. As the CIL thickness increases from the optimal thickness of 10 nm to 70 nm, the PCEs of the PM6:BTP-eC9 devices with PDINO + ZAA CIL only decay 10.9%, which is superior to PDINO devices (17.4%).
Results and discussion
Cathode interface engineering
The chemical structures of materials are shown in Fig. 1a. The CILs were prepared by spin-coating of their ethanol solutions. ZAA CIL presents no absorption over 400 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†). However, it exhibits a high electron affinity (EA) of −3.61 eV and poor film morphology with substantial aggregates (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†), which could not be conducive to form a good CIL. Thus, ZAA was further explored as a doping CIL material for PDINO. PDINO + ZAA CIL was prepared from the mixed solution of PDINO and ZAA, and the optimal ZAA doping proportion was found to be 5 wt%.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were conducted to investigate the existence of electron transfer behavior (Fig. 1b). A weak EPR signal can be observed in PDINO. It is suggested that electron transfer may process through self n-doping from N-oxide to PDI unit, which is beneficial for high conductivity.23,24,34 In comparison to the pristine PDINO, PDINO + ZAA presents an enhanced EPR signal, indicating that a stronger electron transfer exists in PDINO + ZAA. To better understand the electron transfer behavior between PDINO and the additive, ZnAc and ZrAcac were studied as control groups (Fig. 1b). PDINO + ZrAcac also showed higher EPR signals than PDINO, while PDINO + ZnAc exhibited lower EPR signal than PDINO. These results suggest that charge transfer may exist between acac− in metallic complexes of acetylacetone and PDINO.
In order to further reveal the doping mechanism, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured (Fig. 1c and Fig. S4, ESI†). The N 1s binding signals of PDINO and PDINO + ZAA peak at 399 eV and 402 eV, which correspond to amide and N-oxide species, respectively.35 PDINO + ZnAc exhibits almost the same amide/N-oxide molar ratio as PDINO (Fig. S4a and Table S1, ESI†). Nevertheless, PDINO + ZAA shows a decreased N-oxide molar ratio when compared with PDINO (Fig. 1c, Fig. S4b, c and Table S1, ESI†). It suggests that ZAA interact with the N-oxides portion of PDINO, which could enhance its n-doping.23 XPS surface measurements of PDINO + ZrAcac showed lower N-oxides ratio than that in PDINO + ZAA (Fig. S4d and Table S1, ESI†), which could be due to the strong interaction between Zr4+ and Acac− and less interaction between acac− and N-oxide (Table S1, ESI†).15,36
The EA for PDINO, PDINO + ZAA, PDINO + ZnAc and PDINO + ZrAcac were measured by Cyclic voltammetry (CV). Their values are determined to be −3.69, −3.80, −3.72 and −3.75 eV, respectively (Fig. 2a and Fig. S5a, b, ESI†). The lower EA of PDINO + ZAA may be attributed to the charge transfer between PDINO and ZAA, which reduces the mismatched energy level between CIL and widely used non-fullerene acceptors.37 The CV results indicate that a better energy-level alignment is expected to form between the active layer and the PDINO + ZAA CIL, which is beneficial for charge transportation and extraction.11,38 The conductivity of PDINO, PDINO + ZAA, PDINO + ZnAc and PDINO + ZrAcac were calculated from the I–V curves as shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S6 (ESI†). The PDINO exhibits a conductivity of 4.98 × 10−6 S cm−1, while the PDINO + ZAA and PDINO + ZrAcac shows a conductivity of 1.08 × 10−5 S cm−1 and 9.17 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. The enhanced conductivity could allow PDINO + ZAA for better electron transportation than PDINO thus improved device performance.

Photovoltaic performance
To explore CIL potential in conventional structure OSCs, the PMT5039 (Fig. 3a) and Y640 (Fig. S7, ESI†) were mixed as an active layer with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PMT50:Y6/CIL/Ag (Fig. 1a). The corresponding photovoltaic data are depicted in Table 1 and Table S2 (ESI†). ZAA OSCs afford a poor PCE of 10.6% (Fig. 3b and Table 1), which may be caused by the poor contact between ZAA and active layer. The performance of OSCs based on doped PDINO CIL is shown in Table S2 (ESI†). PDINO + ZnAc OSCs acquire a similar PCE (14.4%) with PDINO devices (14.4%), while PDINO + ZrAcac OSCs show superior PCE (15.4%) than the both OSCs. Among them, PDINO + ZAA OSCs display the highest PCE with an enhanced average PCE of 15.7% at the optimal ZAA doping percent is 5 wt%. As the ZAA content further rises, the PCE gradually decreases (Table S3 and Fig. S8, ESI†). The optimal device based on PDINO + ZAA CIL could achieve a PCE up to 15.9%, with an Voc of 0.836 V, Jsc of 26.57 mA cm−2 and FF of 71.7% (Fig. 3b and Table 1). Compared to the champion PDINO devices (0.827 V), the increased Voc of PDINO + ZAA OSCs is mainly due to the lower EA. The FF of PDINO + ZAA devices (71.7%) is also superior to PDINO devices (67.0%). The higher Jsc of PDINO + ZAA OSCs (26.57 mA cm−2) than PDINO OSCs (26.01 mA cm−2) can be further confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (Fig. S9, ESI†).

Charge recombination and mobility
To reveal insights into the effect of different CILs on carrier transportation, the dark current–voltage characteristic of the devices was also measured in Fig. 4a. PDINO + ZAA OSCs provide a large rectification ratio and lower dark current at reverse bias than PDINO OSCs, indicating superior charge selectivity and lower charge recombination. Voc and Jsc as a function of light intensity (Plight) were evaluated to study the charge carrier recombination behaviour of OSCs. The dependence of Voc on Plight is shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The slope of Voc and Plight can be expressed as nkT/e (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature of 300 K, and e is the elementary charge).41 The trap-assisted recombination of the device is almost negligible when the slope value is closer to kT/e. The slope of PDINO + ZAA devices afford lower value with 1.02 kT/e than PDINO devices with 1.04 kT/e, demonstrating that PDINO + ZAA CIL can excellently suppress the trap-assisted recombination in OSCs. Fig. 4b exhibits the relationship between Jsc and Plight, which follows the law of Jsc ∝ Pαlight. In theory, the α value is 1.00 when there is no bimolecular recombination.42,43 The α value of PDINO and PDINO + ZAA are calculated to be 0.913 and 0.928, respectively. It is observed that PDINO + ZAA was better able to suppress the bimolecular recombination. In order to explore the charge extraction properties, the relationship of photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was investigated in Fig. 4c. Veff is the different between V0 and Vappl, which V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Vappl is the applied voltage. P(E, T) is expressed by the Jph/Jsat ratio to present the probabilities of exciton dissociation, where Jsat is the saturation photocurrent density at Veff = 2 V.44 As. shown in Fig. 4c, the P(E, T) of PDINO and PDINO + ZAA OSCs is 95.6% and 96.2%, respectively. It reveals that PDINO + ZAA OSC shows the superior exciton dissociation probability than PDINO OSC, which is ascribed to the negligible bimolecular recombination. To further understand the charge transportation affected by CILs, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was performed to evaluate the hole and electron mobility of OSCs. (Fig. S11 and Table S4, ESI†) The electron mobility (μe) of PDINO + ZAA OSCs is 9.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is higher than PDINO OSCs (6.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The μe/μh of the PDINO + ZAA device is calculated to be 0.98, suggesting that charge transportation is much more balanced, leading to higher FF of the PDINO + ZAA devices.

Device performance with PM6:BTP-eC9 and thick CILs
To study the generalizability of PDINO + ZAA CIL, OSCs with the typical PM6:BTP-eC945 active layer were also fabricated. The photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 5, Table 2 and Table S5 (ESI†). The PM6:BTP-eC9 OSCs based on PDINO CIL exhibit an average PCE of 16.4% at 10 nm CIL. (Table 2) Compared to PDINO OSCs, PDINO + ZAA devices display an improved average PCE of 17.1% at the same condition and the optimal device delivers a PCE up to 17.4% with enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF (Voc = 0.844 V, Jsc = 26.76 mA cm−2 and FF = 77.1%). The EQE spectrum of PM6:BTP-eC9 OSCs is presented in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The Jcalc. calculated from EQE spectrum matches well with the Jsc.

Generally, the commonly used CILs (such as PDINO, PFN, PEIE, PDINN et al.) only function well at 5–30 nm due to their low conductivity or low solubility in alcohol.46–49 PDINO + ZAA CIL offers great conductivity and alcohol-solubility, which is benefit for thick CIL fabrication. To this concern, PM6: BTP-eC9 devices with thicker CIL were fabricated. For PDINO devices, the performance of OSCs drops significantly from 16.7% to 13.8% when the CIL thickness increases from 10 nm to 70 nm (Fig. 5a and Table 2). Different from PDINO OSCs, the Voc, Jsc and FF of PDINO + ZAA devices exhibit little decrease with the thickness rising from 10 nm to 70 nm (Fig. 5b and Table S5, ESI†). The FF of 70 nm PDINO + ZAA devices still maintains 75.5% with only 2.7% reduction when compared with the optimal thickness devices, which indicates better electron transport and collection ability of PDINO + ZAA CIL. OSCs with 70 nm PDINO + ZAA CIL can still achieve a high PCE of 15.5% with 10.9% loss when compared with the optimum devices, presenting better tolerance to the CIL thickness variation than PDINO devices (17.4%). The PDINO + ZAA device shows better stability when stored in glove box, especially with thicker CIL (Fig. S13, ESI†).
Conclusions
In conclusion, an efficient and low-cost CIL is developed by doping 5 wt% ZAA into PDINO. In comparison to the pristine PDINO, PDINO + ZAA delivers lower energy level and higher conductivity, which are attributed to the electron transfer between N-oxide of PDINO and acac− of ZAA. OSCs based on PDINO + ZAA CIL exhibit lower charge recombination and superior charge extraction and transport ability, affording higher PCE than PDINO devices due to the enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF. PDINO + ZAA CIL is applicable to different active layers. In addition, PDINO + ZAA OSCs show lower sensitivity of PCE decay with CIL thickness increase. Our work suggests that ZAA doping is a simple, low-cost and feasible method to optimize PDINO CIL for better device performance. The results also demonstrate that additive engineering of interface layer is an effective strategy to achieve high performance OSCs.
