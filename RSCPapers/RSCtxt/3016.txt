    , Accepted 22nd August 2015First published on 27th August 2015AbstractCu2SnSe3–Au heteronanostructures have been successfully synthesized for the first time using a seed-mediated growth method. Such new Cu2SnSe3–Au heteronanostructures demonstrate enhanced and broadened optical absorption in the Vis-NIR region. We have also investigated the optoelectronic and photocatalytic properties of the Cu2SnSe3–Au heteronanostructures and proposed a mechanism to illustrate the improved photocurrent and photocatalytic performance as compared to bare Cu2SnSe3.
Introduction
The design of new functional materials which can absorb sunlight and transform into chemical/electrical energy for application in photovoltaics, photocatalysis, optoelectronics and other fields has attracted a great deal of interest. During such an energy conversion process how to improve the efficiency of electron–hole separation is a vital factor. To enhance the carrier transportation efficiency, many efforts have been devoted to develop synthetic strategies for building new materials with high performances in energy conversion. In recent years, semiconductor–metal heteronanostructures as new functional materials with the unique interaction of the two material phases have long been of interest to fundamental sciences and have wide application in photocatalysis,1–10 photodetectors,7,11–14 photoelectrochemical solar cells,15,16 lithium ion batteries17,18 and sensors.19–21 Particularly, the noble metal Au coupled with CdS, CdSe, PbS, PbSe and TiO2 has been extensively studied for such applications. However, due to the toxicity of cadmium- and lead-based semiconductor heteronanostructures, the use of most of such materials is restricted . In addition, although TiO2 has a high catalytic activity under illumination, it has a serious disadvantage in that it can absorb mainly UV light. Hence, research has been continued to explore environmentally friendly and low-cost materials that can absorb visible or near-infrared light and show high-performance. Recently, Cu2ZnSnS4–Au heterostructured nanoparticles (NPs) owing to their improved electron–hole separation ability have been demonstrated for photocatalytic hydrogen production and pollutant degradation.6,8 On the other hand, Cu2SnSe3 (CTSe) nanocrystals (NCs), with a band gap ranging from 0.8 to 1.7 eV, have been proven to be promising light-absorbing materials in photoelectric devices because of their high optical-absorption coefficients and high hole mobilities.22–24 So far, despite CTSe NCs with different phases and shapes being synthesized by various methods,23–31 the preparation and investigation of Au-loaded CTSe with excellent optoelectronic and photocatalytic properties have not yet been achieved.
In the present work, we report for the first time a simple strategy to synthesize a new heterostructured CTSe–Au nanomaterial through the direct growth in solution of Au NPs on the surface of CTSe NCs, which act as seeds.6,32–34 The typical synthesis of the CTSe–Au heteronanostructures is schematically displayed in Scheme 1. Firstly, the highly monodispersed CTSe NCs (Fig. S1†) are prepared by the reaction of copper and tin salts with dibenzyl diselenide in the presence of oleylamine (OAm) and octadecene (ODE). Secondly, the above obtained CTSe NCs are added to 1.0 mL of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and 5.0 mL toluene mixture in a 10 mL beaker after ultrasonication for 15 min and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature, to replace the weakly bound OAm (Fig. S2†). Notably, after ligand-exchange with MPA, the peaks at 3356 and 1643 cm−1 for N–H stretching and bending disappear, while two new bands at 1555 and 1405 cm−1 correspond to COO− stretching modes, indicating the presence of the acetate group attached to the CTSe NCs.35,36 These results demonstrate that the MPA becomes the main ligand bound to the CTSe NCs after the ligand-exchange process. Thirdly, the ligand-exchanged CTSe NCs are dispersed in 15 mL ethylene glycol and 1.0 mL OAm under ultrasonication and magnetic stirring. Then, 2.0 mL gold stock solution is added drop-wise under stirring to the above CTSe NC solution at room temperature. The detailed experimental procedures are described in the ESI.†

Results and discussion
The structure of the as-synthesized CTSe–Au heteronanostructures is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1. The main diffraction peaks at 27.1°, 31.4°, 45.0°, 53.4°, 65.6° and 72.3° could be indexed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (400) and (331) planes of cubic-CTSe (JCPDS: 89-2879), while, the peaks at 38.2°, 44.4°, 64.6° and 77.5° could be identified as the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of cubic-Au (JCPDS: 04-0784). In addition, as can be seen in Fig. 2, high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Cu 2p, Sn 3d, Se 3d and Au 4f are measured to investigate the oxidation states of the CTSe–Au NPs’ surface elements and determine the potential presence of secondary phases. Meanwhile, the XPS survey spectrum identifies the presence of Cu, Sn, Se, Au, O and C (Fig. S3†). Cu 2p peaks appeared at 932.1 (2p3/2) and 951.9 eV (2p1/2) with a binding energy splitting of 19.8 eV indicating the presence of Cu(I).37 The peaks of Sn 3d located at 486.2 and 494.6 eV with its characteristic peak separation of 8.4 eV confirm the Sn(IV) state. The peaks of Se 3d appeared at a binding energy of 54.6 eV, which can be assigned to the presence of Se species. The peaks of Au 4f located at 84.0 and 87.6 eV with a binding energy splitting of 3.6 eV show the noble metal presence in the metallic form. These results are in good agreement with the ones reported,6,8 which confirm that the CTSe–Au heteronanostructures without impurity have been successfully prepared.

The morphology of the as-prepared CTSe–Au heteronanostructures is examined by typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 3a, the TEM image confirms that the as-synthesized CTSe–Au consists of heterostructured nanocrystals with monodisperse and uniform quasi-spherical geometry. The average diameters of CTSe and Au NPs are around 22.1 and 4.6 nm (Fig. S1b and S4†), respectively. As seen in Fig. 3b–d, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images reveal that the interplanar spacings of 0.20 and 0.24 nm can be assigned to the (220) plane of cubic CTSe and the (111) plane of cubic Au, respectively. High-resolution STEM-EDS mappings allow for identification of the elements in each region of the heterostructured nanocrystal (Fig. 3e–i). These results verify the co-existence of Cu, Sn, Se and Au in CTSe–Au NCs. In addition, the elemental ratio of Cu:Sn:Se in CTSe–Au is determined to be 1.8:1:2.8, corresponding well with its stoichiometric ratio (Fig. S5†).

Further investigation of optical and optoelectronic properties of the effect of the Au NP decorated CTSe NCs is performed (Fig. S6†), and it is observed that CTSe–Au (13.78 wt%) has the highest photocurrent. Fig. 4a displays absorption spectra of the Au NP, CTSe NC and CTSe–Au (13.78 wt%) heteronanostructures, respectively. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak is observed at ca. 527 nm, which is the typical characteristic of gold NPs (green line).2,38 Obviously, the absorbance spectrum of the CTSe–Au heteronanostructures (blue line) dispersed in toluene shows a much stronger and broader absorption from 500 to 1350 nm (in the visible and near-infrared regions) than that of the bare CTSe NCs (red line). This phenomenon reveals that the enhanced and broadened absorption ability of the CTSe–Au heteronanostructures is mainly attributed to the efficient coupling of the Au plasmon with exciton of CTSe NCs.7,11,13,39 Based on the optical properties of the CTSe–Au heteronanostructures, we have also explored the photocurrent and photoresponse properties of such heteronanostructures. A photodetector (the inset in Fig. 4c shows schematic of device configuration) is constructed by drop-casting concentrated toluene solution of the CTSe–Au NCs on the glass substrate and employing two adjacent ITO films as conductive electrodes. A xenon lamp equipped with a cut-off filter of 400 nm is used as a white light source, which provides visible light ranging from 400 to 780 nm. Fig. 4c and e show the current versus voltage plots of CTSe–Au (13.78 wt%) and CTSe NCs exposed to white light and under dark conditions at a bias of 1.0 V, respectively. In both cases, the current flow under irradiation is higher than that in the case of dark, and the Iphoton/Idark of CTSe–Au (13.78 wt%) is 3.2 while the value for CTSe is 1.2. Furthermore, the photoresponse of CTSe–Au (13.78 wt%) and CTSe NCs is characterized by periodically turning the xenon lamp on and off under air conditions. As seen in Fig. 4d and f, the photocurrent of CTSe–Au (13.78 wt%) heteronanostructures remain almost constant with time, while in the case of only CTSe the photocurrent gradually decreases during six cycles. These results reveal that the photodetector based on the CTSe–Au heteronanostructures demonstrates excellent stability and repeatability.

In both cases, the measurements are carried out in the dark and under white light illumination, the light power intensity is kept at 12 mW cm−2 when the xenon lamp is turned on, the inset in (c) shows schematic of device configuration, and (d, f) current versus time plots of CTSe–Au (13.78 wt%) and CTSe NCs during on and off cycles, respectively. 
To explore its mechanism in the process, we have correlated the band positions of CTSe and Au NCs (for details see the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4b, under irradiation, the electrons are excited from the valence band (+1.35 eV vs. NHE) to the conduction band (−0.15 eV vs. NHE), and then these excited electrons transfer from the conduction band of CTSe to Au, which has a lower Fermi level (+0.5 eV vs. NHE). Moreover, the existence of a Schottky barrier between Au and CTSe is proposed in our studies (Fig. S7†), which may help to enhance the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.7 Thus, the enhanced photocurrent and photoresponse properties of the CTSe–Au heteronanostructures can be attributed to the more efficient separation of electron–hole pairs after CTSe band gap excitation, which is also reported in the literature.7,12,13
In addition, the photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared CTSe–Au heteronanostructures is evaluated by the photodegradation of the methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation ( see the ESI† for details). It is well known that Au loading values not only influence the light-harvesting (Fig. S6†) but also the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs which are of paramount significance in optoelectronic and photocatalytic fields.6 Thus, allowing for the balance between the broadening of the light absorption region and efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers, we chose CTSe–Au (13.78 wt%) heteronanostructures as targets to preliminarily study the photocatalytic properties. For comparison, the single-component of pure CTSe NCs is also chosen for testing under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 5, after exposure to visible light for 90 min, the CTSe–Au (13.78 wt%) heteronanostructures are able to degrade 80% of MB (blue line), whereas the pure CTSe NCs degrade only 50% (red line). As a result, the CTSe–Au heteronanostructures indeed demonstrate higher photocatalytic performance than pure CTSe NCs. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency may also be attributed to synergetic effects of the Schottky junction and the appropriate band alignment of Au and CTSe and their coupling to promote efficient charge separation and transfer in the as-synthesized CTSe–Au heteronanostructures.6,7,12,40–42

Conclusions
In summary, we have first reported the preparation of CTSe–Au heteronanostructures via a simply wet chemistry method. The as-synthesized CTSe–Au heteronanostructures not only dramatically enhance the absorption in visible and near-infrared regions and generate more photoelectrons, but also improve the electron–hole pair separation as a result of suitable band alignment of CTSe and Au and their coupling. In turn, such behavior enhances the optoelectronic and photocatalytic performance of the CTSe–Au heteronanostructures. The synthetic strategy of CTSe–Au heteronanostructures may open avenues for development of a versatile route to other metal/semiconductor heteronanostructures with desirable interfaces for promising applications in optoelectronics and photocatalysis.
