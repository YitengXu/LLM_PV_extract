    , Accepted 12th September 2016First published on 13th September 2016AbstractSeven dyes 1–7 with different electron-withdrawing groups were designed and investigated based on C275, which has been the most efficient metal-free donor/acceptor dye until now to screen outstanding dyes for an organic dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Some basic parameters, such as geometries, electronic structures, absorption spectra and charge recombination, were investigated by DFT and TDDFT methods, and the theoretical maximum short-circuit current density (Jmaxsc) and the electron injection lifetime (τ) were also calculated to estimate the light-harvesting abilities and electron injection efficiencies of these dyes, respectively, which adds some quantitative information for our study. Moreover, the charge recombination process was also discussed according to the distance (r) between the semiconductor surface and cation holes in the dye. The results show that all the dyes in our work exhibit ultrafast and effective electron injection with τ values in fs. Dyes 3, 5 and 7 have better light-harvesting abilities and dyes 1, 4 and 7 have better electron-collecting abilities with slower charge recombination than C275. Thus, the designed dye 7 might have superior performance in comparison with C275 and could be the most promising candidate as an organic dye in DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Undoubtedly, research into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has flourished since the seminal work was published by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 owing to their potential to offer low-cost conversion of solar energy.2 In general, a typical DSSC device is composed of titanium oxide film, a dye sensitizer, an electrolyte, a counter electrode, and a transparent conducting substrate.3,4 As the most significant functional component, the sensitizer plays a critical role in capturing solar light and generating electron transfer in the cell.5,6 To date, three types of sensitizers have mainly been used in DSSCs:7,8 ruthenium dyes,9,10 porphyrin dyes,11,12 and metal-free organic dyes.13–16 Among these sensitizers, ruthenium and porphyrin dyes have displayed extremely impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE); for example, a zinc porphyrin sensitizer has provided a record PCE of up to 13.0%.17 However, the scarce resources and environmental impact of ruthenium dyes7 and low productivity and poor long-term stability of porphyrin dyes18 have seriously retarded their large-scale commercial application.
In comparison with high-efficiency metal-containing dyes, metal-free organic dyes exhibit several advantages: a high molar extinction coefficient, extraordinary diversity, a relatively low cost of production, simple synthesis, and environmentally friendly operation.7,19–21 Owing to these advantages, a great deal of recent attention has been focused on investigating and developing various metal-free organic dyes derived from abundant resources with the aim of improving the PCE of organic DSSCs.22,23 Nevertheless, organic dyes had lagged behind metal-containing dyes for a long time, until the dye C275, which contains an N-annulated indenoperylene (NIP) electron donor decorated with photochemically inactive segments and an ethynylbenzothiadiazolylbenzoic acid (EBTBA) electron acceptor was synthesized and reported by Wang et al., which achieved a much higher PCE of 12.5% without any coadsorbate.24 As the most highly efficient metal-free donor/acceptor dye until now, the perfectly coplanar and electron-rich donor of C275 was the key to achieving the prominent breakthrough in cell efficiency. However, there still remains much scope to increase PCE and we should make strenuous efforts to further improve it. Benzothiadiazolylbenzoic acid was consistently employed as an electron acceptor in some excellent dyes reported by Wang et al. such as C272, C275, C276, C277 and C278, which also exhibit outstanding PCE.24,25 However, it should be pointed out that almost all the efforts have focused on changing the electron-donating groups. Although benzothiadiazole (BTD) is a good choice as an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), there are also many other EWGs that could be superior to BTD. In this regard, we carried out the theoretical design of seven dyes 1–7 (shown in Fig. 1) with different EWGs based on C275 to further search for more efficient organic dyes.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of dye C275 and dyes 1–7 with different EWGs. 
To determine whether our designed dyes exhibit superior performance, many parameters related to cell performance were systematically investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations, such as the absorption spectra, driving force of electron injection, shifts in the energy levels of the conduction band, charge recombination process, and so on. Quantitative calculations of the maximum short-circuit current density (Jmaxsc) and the electron injection lifetime (τ) provided us with further evidence to judge the cell performance of these dyes. Our results reveal that the designed dye 7 with naphthothiadiazole as the EWG exhibits superior performance in comparison with C275 and could be a promising candidate as an organic dye in DSSC. We hope that our work could provide theoretical guidance for experimenters in the search to improve the PCE of organic DSSCs.
2. Computational details
The ground-state geometries of the dye molecules (C275 and dyes 1–7) were optimized in the gas phase with the B3LYP functional and 6-311G** basis set using DFT methods.26 Frequency calculations were performed at the same level of theory to confirm that the optimized geometries are at stationary points with no imaginary frequencies. On the basis of the optimized ground-state geometries, linear-response TDDFT calculations in conjunction with the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM)27 were performed to obtain the excitation energies of these dyes in tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent. We employed a variety of different functionals, including B3LYP, MPW1PW91, PBE0, MPW1K, BHandHLYP, M062X, CAM-B3LYP, LC-ωPBE, LC-BLYP, ωB97X, and ωB97XD in the TDDFT calculations with the aim of selecting a reliable functional. The effects of the functionals and experimental data for C275 are listed in Table S1 in the ESI.† The results show that the MPW1K28,29 functional gives a maximum absorption wavelength of 536 nm, which is in good agreement with the experimental value (543 nm) derived from the electronic absorption spectrum. Thus, the excitation energies of all the dye molecules were simulated by the TD-CPCM-MPW1K/6-311G** method. Maps of charge density difference (CDD), which were generated to investigate charge transfer upon electronic transitions, were created in Multiwfn 3.3.8.30,31 The frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energies were calculated by single-point calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G** level. The ground-state oxidation potential of the dye molecules was determined at the MPW1K/6-311G** level via a single-point calculation in acetonitrile as the solvent in the cell. To discover the extent of charge recombination between injected electrons and dye cations, we optimized the cation-state geometries of the dyes and performed natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis by single-point calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G** level in the determinative direction.
The modes of adsorption of a dye with a carboxylic acid group onto a TiO2 surface include monodentate, bidentate chelating, bidentate bridging, and so on. On the basis of the experimental results indicated by the Fourier transform infrared spectra,32,33 we adopted the bidentate bridging mode of adsorption to simulate the adsorption of the dyes on anatase TiO2. The optimization of dye-adsorbed (TiO2)38 structures34 was performed by the SIESTA package.35 Then, on the basis of the optimized structures, changes in the energy levels of the conduction band and the electron injection lifetime were determined by single-point calculations employing the B3LYP functional with the SVP basis set. Solvation effects (acetonitrile) were taken into account by means of the C-PCM solvation model.36 All the above calculations were performed in the Gaussian 09 D01 program package,37 unless otherwise stated.
3. Results and discussion
As we know, the PCE of DSSCs is commonly determined by the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF), and is defined as follows:38 (1)where Pinc is the solar power incident on the cell. Therefore, it is obvious that properties associated with these factors influence the PCE of a cell. Here, we will take a series of factors that affect Jsc and Voc into account for the seven dyes and compare them with those for C275.
3.1 Molecular geometries and electronic structures
As is well known, the geometry and electronic structure are the basic factors that determine the chemical properties of a dye.5,6,39 Because the light absorption and charge transfer capacities of the sensitized dye are the fundamental requirements in a DSSC, an intimately related factor, namely, the degree of conjugation between the EWG and benzoic acid (BA), is initially investigated. The optimized ground-state geometries of all the dyes with the dihedral angles between the EWGs and BA are shown in Fig. 2. In comparison with C275 (36.76°), we find that dyes 2 (31.45°), 3 (1.35°), 5 (25.36°), 6 (−0.29°) and 7 (35.61°) exhibit a smaller dihedral angle, but dyes 1 (46.11°) and 4 (49.36°) exhibit a larger one. The smaller is the dihedral angle, the greater is the degree of conjugation. Therefore, the designed dyes are endowed with a greater degree of conjugation owing to their lesser steric hindrance, except for 1 and 4.
 Fig. 2  Optimized molecular structures with the dihedral angle (°) between the EWGs and acceptor moieties. 
In general, a favorable degree of conjugation is beneficial for better electron delocalization of FMOs and efficient charge transfer,40 as well as a red shift in the spectrum, which could match the solar radiation spectrum better. However, it should be pointed out that excessive delocalization of FMOs will hinder the efficient separation of hole-electron pairs upon photoexcitation. The distributions of the FMOs of C275 and 1–7 are listed in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It is obvious that all the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are similar and are mainly localized on NIP and the triple bond. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are also analogous on the whole except for those of 4 and 7, namely, the LUMOs of the dyes are mostly localized on the spacer moiety and acceptor moiety containing the EWG and BA. For 4, the sparse distribution on BA could be attributed to its greater steric hindrance and the unfavorable conjugation between the EWG and BA. As shown for the FMOs, there are obvious charge transfers from the HOMOs to the LUMOs, which might favor intramolecular charge transfer upon photoexcitation, whereas the distinct electron distributions on BA for the LUMOs suggest advantageous electronic coupling between the dyes and the semiconductor, except for dye 4.
Moreover, the energy levels of the FMOs are displayed in Fig. 3. The similarity in the HOMO levels is ascribed to the similar distributions of the HOMOs. The comparative difference in the LUMO levels reflects the different electron-withdrawing abilities of the dyes. It is well known that the more negative is the LUMO energy, the stronger is the electron-withdrawing ability. Therefore, we could make the conclusion that dyes 3, 5 and 7 possess better electron-withdrawing ability. In addition, we can further infer that they would display red shifts in their absorption spectra owing to their smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps in comparison with that of C275.

3.2 Theoretical explanations for Jsc

3.2.1 Factors related to Jsc. 
The short-circuit current density Jsc of DSSCs is mainly determined by the integral of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE(λ)) at a fixed wavelength and the corresponding photon flux (Is(λ)) based on the AM 1.5G (global) solar radiation spectrum, where IPCE(λ) is the product of the light-harvesting efficiency at the relevant wavelength (LHE(λ)), the electron injection efficiency (Φinj) and the charge collection efficiency (ηcoll), and is calculated as follows:38,41 (2)where LHE(λ) is defined as follows:5,42,43 LHE(λ) = 1 − 10−A(λ)(3)
According to the Bouguer–Lambert–Beer law, we know that: A = ε(λ)bc(4)where A(λ) is the absorbance and ε(λ) is the molar absorption coefficient at the relevant wavelength, whereas b is the thickness of the film and c is the concentration, which are taken to be 10.2 μm and 3.0 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1, respectively, as derived from experimental values.24 It is worth noting that Jsc is also related to Is(λ), which represents the absorption range. When Φinj and ηcoll are assumed to be unity, the calculated value of Jsc would be the theoretical maximum limiting value of the short-circuit current density (Jmaxsc), which could be used to quantitatively and visually reflect the overall light harvesting-ability of the dyes, as well as the degree of matching between the absorption spectra of the dyes and the photon flux spectrum.44
With respect to Φinj, it is closely related to the driving force (ΔGinj) of electron injection, which is defined as the difference between the excited-state oxidation potential of the dye and the energy level of the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.0 eV).3 ΔGinj can be expressed as follows:44–46 ΔGinj = Edye* − ECB(5) Edye* = Edye + Eex(6)where Edye and Edye* are the ground- and excited-state oxidation potentials, respectively, and Eex is the vertical transition energy. In addition, ηcoll should be considered, which is not only related to the electrode material, but is also affected by the charge recombination process.18
In summary, the values of Jmaxsc, ΔGinj, and ηcoll of dyes are the key factors that determine the value of Jsc. Therefore, these three factors will be discussed in detail to inspect the effect of the EWGs on the value of Jsc for C275 and dyes 1–7.


3.2.2 Absorption spectra. 
In order to evaluate the effect of the EWGs on the light-harvesting abilities of the dyes, we first calculated the maximum absorption wavelengths, vertical excitation energies, nature of the transitions, and charge density difference (CDD) maps of the dyes. The corresponding results are listed in Table 1. To intuitively evaluate the absorption properties of the dyes, the absorption spectra were also simulated by Multiwfn software and can be seen in Fig. 4. The value of the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) and the corresponding value of ε of C275 are in conformity with the experimental values (535 nm, 51.1 × 103 M−1 cm−1) in the literature.24 As seen in Table 1, the strongest absorption peaks of all the dyes in the visible region can all be assigned to S0 → S1 transitions, and the CDD maps corresponding to S0 → S1 transitions demonstrated that intramolecular charge transfer occurs after photoexcitation, which would facilitate effective electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. The calculated values of λmax are in the order of 4 < 2 < 1 < 6 < C275 < 7 < 3 < 5. Obviously, in comparison with the prototypical dye C275 with BTD, dye 3 with thienopyrazine, 5 with diketopyrrolopyrrole and 7 with naphthothiadiazole exhibit red shifts in their absorption spectra, which is in good agreement with the inference in Section 3.1. Moreover, the red shifts in the absorption spectra might promote an increase in light-harvesting abilities for 3, 5 and 7, which was further confirmed by the simulated LHE curves in Fig. 4. The LHE curves of 3, 5 and 7 are significantly broader than the others, which indicates their higher light-harvesting abilities. Moreover, another quantitative parameter, namely, Jmaxsc, used for estimating the ability of the dyes to exhibit high Jsc values, was also calculated for each dye. The results are shown in both Table 1 and Fig. 4. It is clear that the Jmaxsc values of dyes 3, 5 and 7 are higher than that of C275. Therefore, dyes 3, 5 and 7 are endowed with a better match between their absorption spectra and the solar photon flux spectrum than that of C275. In addition, it should be emphasized that the computed value of Jmaxsc of C275 (29.55 mA cm−2) is twice as high as the experimental value of Jsc (17.03 mA cm−2). Because the value of Jmaxsc was obtained on the basis of assuming that Φinj and ηcoll were unity, Φinj and ηcoll are undoubtedly considered to be the crucial factors that caused the decrease in the value of Jsc.

3.2.3 Electron injection. 
Islam et al. have revealed that when the value of ΔGinj is above 0.2 eV, the differences in Φinj between dyes are very slight.47 As shown in Table 2, the calculated ΔGinj values are all large enough for efficient electron injection. However, this seems not to be completely sufficient for the conclusion. Fortunately, the electron injection lifetime (τ) for adsorbates on the surface, which serves as the criterion to judge whether electron injection is energetically efficient or not, was also calculated by employing the Newns–Anderson model. The value of τ is inversely proportional to the electron injection efficiency Φinj. The simulation was based on the shift in energy of the LUMO after the dye was adsorbed on the semiconductor and the lifetime broadening (ℏГ), which is described by a Lorentzian distribution:48,49 (7)where LLUMO (E) represents the distribution of the LUMO level of the dye and ELUMO is the position of the LUMO level of the adsorbate, which is determined from a weighted average of the calculated energies. According to the value of ℏГ, the approximate electron injection lifetime can be expressed as shown below in convenient numerical units:48 (8)

This method could accurately simulate the electron transfer process for the model of the dye/TiO2 interface and has been widely applied to DSSCs. The related data listed in Table 3 clearly confirm that an ultrafast and effective electron injection process occurs for each dye, because all the τ values are in femtoseconds (fs). Besides, all the dyes have similar values of Φinj because their τ values have minute differences.

3.2.4 Electron collection. 
In general, ηcoll is not only related to the electrode material, but is also affected by charge recombination as the process of the loss of injected electrons. Here, ηcoll was investigated by discussing charge recombination. As we know, charge recombination mainly comprises two processes in DSSCs: one occurs between the injected electrons in the conduction band of the semiconductor and dye cations after photoexcitation, and the other occurs between the injected electrons and the redox couple in the electrolyte. In the first case, the injected electrons would migrate to the HOMO of the oxidized dye, which has been demonstrated by Durrant et al.50 This is thermodynamically feasible as the HOMO energy levels of the dye cations are all lower than the CB level of the semiconductor (TiO2). Durrant et al. have pointed out that the charge recombination process could be estimated via the distance (r) between the injected electrons in the CB of TiO2 and the cation holes in the dye, and the larger is the value of r, the slower is charge recombination.44,50,51 Here, we adopted this strategy and calculated the value of r for all the studied dyes. The results are listed in Table 4 and schematic diagrams are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). The value of r was obtained from the percentage contribution of each atom to the HOMO multiplied by the corresponding distance from each atom of the oxidized dye to the semiconductor surface. As seen in Table 4, we infer that dyes 1, 4 and 7 would exhibit slower charge recombination than C275 as the values of r are in the following order: 7 (20.12 Å) > 4 (18.69 Å) > 1 (18.42 Å) > C275 (18.32 Å). In particular, the value of r of dye 7 is much larger than that of C275, which obviously indicates that the electron collection process for dye 7 will be the most efficient in our study. Furthermore, there is another charge recombination process that should be noted, namely, charge recombination between the injected electrons and the redox couple in the electrolyte, which is mainly related to the local concentration of electron acceptors in the proximity of the TiO2 surface and the configuration of the dye in the electrolyte. For the same experimental conditions and similar configurations, we regard this charge recombination process as approximately the same.

From the above discussion of the key factors that determine the value of Jsc, it can clearly be observed that all the designed dyes have analogous electron injection processes and that dyes 3, 5 and 7 have better light-harvesting abilities and dyes 1, 4 and 7 have better electron collection abilities than that of C275. Besides, we can reasonably conclude that dye 7 would have a higher Jsc value than that of C275.

3.3 Theoretical explanations for Voc

3.3.1 Factors related to Voc. 
The open-circuit photovoltage Voc of the cell is determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor (EF,TiO2) and the redox potential of the redox couple (Eredox), and is expressed as follows:52 (9)where ECB is the energy level of the conduction band of the semiconductor, ΔECB is the shift in the energy level of the conduction band after adsorption, q is the unit charge, and kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and the temperature, respectively. NCB is the electron density of state, nc is the number of electrons in the conduction band, and Eredox is the oxidation potential of the Co-phen redox couple in the electrolyte, which is generally taken to be the experimental value of −5.06 eV.53 It is unnecessary for us to emphasize that the factors that influence Voc are mainly the two variables ΔECB and nc.
As is well known, the value of ΔECB is affected by the solvent, ions in the electrolyte and the adsorbed dye, and can be expressed by the following formula:43,54 ΔECB = ΔECB.solv + ΔECB.ions + ΔECB.dye(10)where ΔECB.solv, ΔECB.ions, and ΔECB.dye respectively represent the shifts induced by the solvent, ions and adsorbed dye. Under the same experimental conditions in a DSSC with different dyes only, the influence of the solvent and ions could be regarded as having a fixed value, which means that ΔECB.solv and ΔECB.ions are constants. Therefore, the value of ΔECB is mainly affected by the structure of the dye adsorbed on the semiconductor surface. Another important factor that determines the value of Voc is nc, which is commonly affected by electron injection, dye regeneration and charge recombination. Thus, in the following sections these factors will be analyzed in detail.


3.3.2 Shift in the conduction band energy level. 
To simulate the TiO2 surface, we employed a (TiO2)38 cluster obtained by appropriately cutting an anatase slab to expose the majority (101) surface, which has been commonly applied in the literature.44,54–56 To determine the effects of the EWGs on the shift in the CB of the semiconductor, we first calculated the total density of states (TDOS) for the (TiO2)38 cluster alone and the partial density of states (PDOS) for the dyes adsorbed on the (TiO2)38 cluster using the Multiwfn program based on the optimized geometries of the dye–(TiO2)38 system, which were obtained at the B3LYP/SVP level in acetonitrile as the solvent. Then we performed a linear fitting of the TDOS and PDOS in the range of 20–80% of the maximum height. As a result, the intercepts of the dashed straight lines with the energy axis correspond to the calculated CB edges, respectively, and the value of ΔECB is the difference between them.

This strategy was proposed by De Angelis et al. and has been widely applied in calculations on DSSCs to determine the value of ΔECB.54 As shown in Table 4, it is indicated that C275 and dyes 1–7, which have different EWGs, have similar shifts in the CB energy level, which implies that the EWGs have a slight influence on the value of ΔECB.


3.3.3 Electron regeneration. 
As we know, the value of nc is associated with electron injection, dye regeneration and charge recombination, and the electron injection process is ultrafast for all the dyes, which has been demonstrated in Section 3.2.3. Regeneration of the dye, as the elementary and essential process in DSSCs, is also crucial for the PCE of a device. This is mainly determined by the driving force of regeneration (ΔGreg), which is expressed as follows:57 ΔGreg = Edye − Eredox(11)where Edye is the ground-state oxidation potential and Eredox is the oxidation potential of the Co-phen redox couple in the electrolyte (−5.06 eV), which was mentioned in the previous section. The calculated results for ΔGreg for all the dyes are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that all the studied dyes have similar values of ΔGreg in comparison with that of C275 because they contain the same donor, which is the most probable site of regeneration.
As a result, different EWGs have little effect on the values of ΔECB or ΔGreg but have a relatively substantial effect on charge recombination, which further influences the value of Voc. Thus, we infer that dye 7 will have a higher Voc and dyes 1 and 4 will have a comparable Voc in comparison with that of C275.

4. Conclusions
To further design and develop more efficient organic dyes, seven organic dyes with different electron-withdrawing groups based on the classic dye C275 were systematically studied by methods using density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory. The factors that determine the efficiency of the cell, including the absorption spectra, driving force of electron injection, electron injection lifetime, shift in the energy level of the conduction band, charge recombination process, and so on, were investigated in detail. The calculated results demonstrated that all the dyes in our work exhibit an ultrafast and effective electron injection process with an electron injection lifetime in fs. From a discussion of the key factors that determine the short-circuit current density, we find that dyes 3, 5 and 7 have better light-harvesting abilities with a red shift in their absorption spectra, whereas dyes 1, 4 and 7 have better electron collection abilities with slower charge recombination than that of C275. Furthermore, we find that charge recombination is the dominant factor that determines the value of Voc with almost the same shift in the conduction band and driving force of regeneration.
Our results reveal that dye 7 with naphthothiadiazole as the electron-withdrawing group exhibits superior performance in comparison with that of C275. It is reasonable to conclude that dye 7 will be a promising candidate as an organic dye in dye-sensitized solar cells. We hope that our work will provide theoretical guidance for experimenters and will further improve the power conversion efficiency of organic dye-sensitized solar cells.
