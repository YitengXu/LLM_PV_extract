    , Accepted 28th August 2012First published on 29th August 2012AbstractWe report a novel method, nanoscale solvothermal reaction (NSR), to induce the quantum confinement effect of CdSe on nanostructured TiO2 by solvothermal route. The time-dependent growth of CdSe is observed in solution at room temperature, which is found to be accomplished instantly by heat-treatment in the presence of solvent at 1 atm. However, no crystal growth occurs upon heat-treatment in the absence of solvent. The nanoscale solvothermal growth of CdSe quantum dot is realized on the nanocrystalline oxide surface, where Cd(NO3)2·4H2O and Na2SeSO3 solutions are sequentially spun on nanostructured TiO2, followed by heat-treatment at temperatures ranging from 100 °C to 250 °C. Size of CdSe increases from 4.4 nm to 5.3 nm, 8.7 nm and 14.8 nm, which results in decrease in optical band gap from 2.19 eV to, 1.95 eV, 1.74 eV and 1.75 eV with increasing the NSR temperature from 100 °C to 150 °C, 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively, which is indicative of the quantum confinement effect. Thermodynamic studies reveal that increase in the size of CdSe is related to increase in enthalpy, for instance, from 3.77 J mg−1 for 100 °C to 8.66 J mg−1 for 200 °C. Quantum confinement effect is further confirmed from the CdSe-sensitized solar cell, where onset wavelength in external quantum efficiency spectra is progressively shifted from 600 nm to 800 nm as the NSR temperature increases, which leads to a significant improvement of power conversion efficiency by a factor of more than four. A high photocurrent density of 13.7 mA cm−2 is obtained based on CdSe quantum dot grown by NSR at 200 °C.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have attracted enormous interest due to their simple and cheap fabrication process since they were first reported with an efficiency of about 7% in 1991.1–3 Recently the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency has exceeded 12%4,5 confirming that DSSC are one of the most promising alternatives to the rather expensive semiconductor based pn junction solar cells. For further enhancement of the conversion efficiency, it is essential to develop a sensitizer covering near-IR wavelength region with high extinction coefficient.6 Organic dyes have been extensively studied for this reason, due to relatively high extinction coefficients, compared to ruthenium-based complexes.7,8 However, most studied organic dyes have the drawback of a wide band gap, leading to narrow absorption wavelength. Recently, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as another promising sensitizer since they have higher absorption coefficient as compared to conventional organic dyes.9,10 Moreover, it is possible to control the band gap energy of QD from visible to near-IR wavelength region by changing QDs size, which is related to the confined electrons in nanocrystals, where the band gap of QD starts to increase when the size of QD becomes smaller than Bohr exciton radius.11–15
Cadmium selenide (CdSe), known to have the band gap energy of 1.7 eV, has been intensively studied in QD-sensitized solar cells because of high absorption coefficient of ca. 0.7 × 105 cm−1 at 690 nm.16,17 QD-sensitized solar cells are composed of a QD-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2, a redox electrolyte and a counter electrode. Thanks to the development of electrolyte,18 counter electrode,19,20 surface passivation21,22 and metal oxide morphology23 for CdSe-sensitized solar cells, the conversion efficiency of about 5% was achieved.23 For the deposition of CdSe QDs on TiO2 nanostructure, the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method has been commonly used.19,24 Using SILAR method, metal chalcogenides such as PbS, CdS, CdSexS1−x, and ZnS were successfully deposited.25–30 SILAR method is based on sequential reaction at the surface of TiO2,31 where pre-adsorbed cations react readily with newly adsorbed anions. It was demonstrated that the average size and the total loading amount of CdSe increased simultaneously as the coating cycle increased. However, the size and the loading amount may not have a simultaneous effect on photovoltaic performance because each factor has its own optimal condition. Therefore, for the best performance of QD-sensitized solar cells it is important to deposit QDs by independent control of amount and size. For this reason, preparation methods for QD formation are critical to photovoltaic performance.32,33 Several methods to control the size of CdSe have been attempted. Among them, most intensively studied methods were the high temperature one-pot technique and the solvothermal reaction.34–44 However, these methods were used to prepare the suspended colloidal CdSe in solution. To utilize the CdSe QD as a sensitizer in DSSC, it is necessary to control the size of CdSe while depositing CdSe on metal oxide surface.
In this study, we report a nanoscale solvothermal method to control the size of CdSe. CdSe is formed on nanocrystalline TiO2 surface in air atmosphere by spin-coating technology. Morphology, size and optical properties are evaluated from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is adapted to study the relationship between change in enthalpy and growth of CdSe. Photovoltaic performance is studied with a CdSe-sensitized photoelectrochemical cell employing polysulfide redox electrolyte.
Experimental
Preparation of CdSe on TiO2 surface
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Pilkington, TEC-8,8 Ω per sq) was cleaned with ethanol using an ultrasonic cleaner for 15 min and subsequently UV/ozone cleaning was conducted for 15 min to remove organic contaminants. A thin blocking layer was prepared on the cleaned FTO glass using 0.1 M Ti(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato) diisopropoxide (Aldrich, 98%) in 1-butanol (Aldrich, 99.8%) solution as described elsewhere.45 TiO2 nanoparticles were hydrothermally synthesized using titanium isopropoxide (Aldrich, 97%) in an autoclave at 230 °C. TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing the synthesized nanocrystalline TiO2, terpineol (Aldrich, 99.5%), ethyl cellulose (Aldrich, 46 cp) and lauric acid (Fluka, 96%) with nominal composition of 1.25:4:0.3:0.1. The paste was further treated using three-roll-mill for 40 min to disperse the nanoparticles sufficiently. The TiO2 paste was coated on the blocking layer coated FTO substrate using doctor-blade method and annealed at 550 °C for 1 h in air. Thickness of the annealed mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer was adjusted to 7 ± 0.2 μm as measured by an alpha-step IQ surface profiler (KLA Tencor). 0.3 M Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0%) in ethanol (Samchun, 99.9%) was used as cationic cadmium precursor solution. For anionic selenium precursor solution, sodium selenosulfate (Na2SeSO3) in deionized (DI) water was prepared by refluxing 0.6 M Na2SO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and 0.3 M Se (Aldrich, 99.99%, trace metal basis) in DI water at 90 °C for 4 h. As-prepared Na2SeSO3 solution was stored in the dark for 12 h, which was filtered to remove the un-dissolved chemicals. To form CdSe on mp-TiO2, 640 μL of Cd2+ precursor solution was first spun on mp-TiO2 coated FTO glass (3 cm × 4 cm) at rate of 4000 rpm for 30 s and then 640 μL of Se2− precursor solution was spun at the same spin-coating condition. After Se2− solution coating, the electrode was immediately moved to the preheated hot plate and annealed for 10 min in air at different temperature of 100, 150, 200 or 250 °C. This process was termed as one cycle and 10 cycles were repeated. Heat-treatment after each cycle was conducted.
Solar cell fabrication
Pt-coated counter electrode was prepared by following procedure. 7 mM H2PtCl6·6H2O (Aldrich, 99.9%) in 2-propanol was dropped on a cleaned FTO glass, which was annealed at 400 °C for 20 min in air. CdSe-sensitized working electrode and Pt coated counter electrode was assembled using 25 μm-thick hot melt surlyn (SX1170-25, Solaronix). Polysulfide redox electrolyte composed of 1 M Na2S (Aldrich), 1 M S (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) and 0.1 M NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) in DI water was injected through the 0.75 mm-diameter hole at Pt electrode and the holes were sealed using polyimide tape. At least two cells are fabricated in each condition to ensure the reliability of the experiment.
Measurement and characterization
The active area was measured by a digital microscope camera (DCMe 500) equipped with an image analysis program (Leopard 2009). Photocurrent and voltage were measured using solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with 450 W Xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley 2400 source meter. Light intensity was adjusted with the NREL-calibrated Si solar cell having KG-2 filter for approximating one sun light intensity (100 mW cm−2). The cell was exposed to simulated sun for 10 min before collecting the data. While measuring photocurrent and voltage, the cell was covered with an aperture mask. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a specially designed EQE system (PV measurement Inc.). A 75 W xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan) was used as a white light source to generate a monochromatic beam. Morphology and size of CdSe QDs adsorbed on the nanocrystalline TiO2 surface were investigated using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, Jeol, JEM-2100F) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Average diameter of QDs was determined from TEM micrograph using image J program (version 1.45s). Temperature-dependent CdSe size was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Seico Inst., DSC7020 model). CdSe deposited TiO2 was used as the sample for DSC measurement. X-Ray diffraction measurement was conducted from Bruker AXS using Cu Kα radiation at scan rate of 3° per min under operation condition of 40 kV and 40 mA.
Results and discussion
To design the methodology for the CdSe nanocrystal growth, the nucleation-growth mechanism of CdSe is investigated. First, the two precursor solutions are mixed in a vial and investigated at room temperature (without heat treatment). Fig. 1(a) shows a change of the Cd2+ and Se2− precursor mixed solution with time at room temperature. When the two precursor solutions are mixed, yellow colored CdSe is precipitated immediately. Progressive color change (yellow → orange → red) in the precipitate is observed with time. The CdSe precipitate turns finally dark brown after 19 h. Change in color is indicative of change in optical band gap due to change in size. It is reported that CdSe is formed by reacting Cd2+ and HSe− in the presence of OH−, where Cd2+ ion is released from Cd(NO3)2 and HSe− and hydroxyl ions are produced by dissolving Na2SeSO3.46 Once CdSe forms, crystal growth occurs over the period of time in a manner of addition of Cd2+ and Se2− ions to the CdSe seed and/or aggregation of CdSe according to the following eqn (1).46(CdSe)m + Cd2+ + HSe− + OH− ↔ (CdSe)m+1 + H2O (CdSe)m + (CdSe)n ↔ (CdSe)m+n(1)

(b) The CdSe powders obtained by heating the same solution for 1 min at different temperatures (with solvent). (c) The CdSe powders obtained by heating the 80 °C vacuum dried CdSe powder for 10 min at different temperature (without solvent). 
When the mixture of precursor solution is heated at different temperatures for only one minute, the color of the CdSe precipitate changes in such a very short period of time, which means that above-mentioned growth mechanism is significantly accelerated by heat treatment as can be seen in Fig. 1(b). Orange red color appears after only 1 min heat treatment at 100 °C, which can be observed after 40 min at room temperature. Heat treatment at 150 °C for 1 min produces dark red color CdSe, which can be obtained after more than 100 min at room temperature. Dark brown color is observed at both 200 °C and 250 °C. From the observations in Fig. 1(a) and (b), it can be said that the CdSe precipitate grows with time at room temperature and growth is accelerated at the elevated temperature in the presence of solvent. We carry out one more experiment to investigate CdSe growth in the absence of solvent, where the precipitate is filtered, dried at 80 °C under vacuum and then heated at different temperature ranging from 100 °C to 250 °C for 10 min. In this case, contrary to the distinct color change in the previous two experiments, the initial color of the yellow precipitate changes hardly as temperature is elevated up to 200 °C as can be seen in Fig. 1(c), which suggests that CdSe growth is inhibited in the absence of solvent. It is thus obvious that increase in the size of CdSe is related to the presence of solvent, namely the growth of CdSe is accelerated by solvothermal reaction. No significant color change observed for both 200 °C and 250 °C in Fig. 1(b) is indicative of similar band gap. To take the advantage of solvothermally assisted CdSe crystal growth, we design nanoscale solvothermal reaction (NSR) on nanocrystalline TiO2 surface using spin coating technique. Schematic procedure is demonstrated in Fig. 2(a). Briefly, two precursor solutions for Cd2+ and Se2− successively spun on nanostructured TiO2, which is followed by heating on hot plate at 100 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C and 250 °C to complete one coating cycle (the temperature treated at the end of Se2− spin-coating following Cd2+ spin-coating, hereafter denoted as CET (cycle-end-temperature)). When two precursor solutions are spun on the TiO2 surface, solvent is still present with the nucleated CdSe. Consequently, heat-treatment at the end of each coating cycle is likely to lead to solvothermal growth of CdSe QDs on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles. Fig. 2(b) shows CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrode with different CET. Film color also changes from yellow to dark brown via brown as the CET increases, which is indicative of a change in band gap energy of CdSe. Optical band gaps of CdSe QDs adsorbed on TiO2 nanoparticle are determined based on absorption spectra using Tauc model in eqn (2),47–51 (2)where α is the absorption coefficient, hν is photon energy, Eg is optical band gap energy and κ is the photon energy dependent constant. The power of n depends on transition type, where n = 1/2 for direct band gap transition and n = 2 for indirect band gap transition. Absorption coefficient α is estimated based on eqn (3),52 (3)where d and T represent film thickness and transmittance, respectively. Since CdSe is a well-known direct band gap semiconductor,17 its optical band gap is estimated from (αhν)2vs. photon energy plot as can be seen in Fig. 3(a). Optical band gap of the CdSe QDs adsorbed on TiO2 decreases from 2.19 eV to 1.95 eV as the CET changes from 100 °C to 150 °C. The CET of 200 °C decreases the band gap to 1.74 eV, while no further change in the band gap is observed for the CET of 250 °C (1.75 eV). Considering the bulk band gap of CdSe (1.7 eV), the larger band gaps for the CET of 100 °C and 150 °C are obviously indicative of quantum confinement effect, which suggests that the size of CdSe formed at 100 °C and 150 °C might be in the range smaller than Bohr exciton radius (5.6 nm).53

Fig. 3(b) shows absorption spectra of CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrode. As the CET from 100 °C, 150 °C and 200 °C, absorption onset is shifted from 600 nm, 700 nm and 800 nm, which indicates that optical band gap changes with the CET change. Little difference in absorption onset is observed between 200 °C and 250 °C. Also, compared to the 200 °C treated CdSe, absorbance are slightly decreased for the 250 °C treated one, which seems to be related to structural change.54Fig. 4 compares XRD pattern of the CdSe treated at 200 °C and the CdSe treated at 250 °C. The broad peaks at around 29° and 43° for the 200 °C CdSe can be indexed as (111) and (220) planes, respectively, in cubic phase,16 while the peak at around 29° is split into two peaks centered at around 25° and 30° that can be indexed as (100) and (101) planes in hexagonal phase.55 The phase transition from cubic to hexagonal in CdSe was reported to diminish optical absorption property,54 which can explain the decreased absorbance for the CET of 250 °C.

Fig. 5 shows high resolution electron transmission microscopy (HR-TEM) images of the CdSe adsorbed on TiO2 surface for the different CETs. Shapeless CdSe nanoparticles adhere well to TiO2 surface. Observed size of CdSe is determined to be 4.4 ± 0.2 nm and 5.3 ± 0.5 nm for the CET of 100 °C and 150 °C, respectively, which is rather smaller than the Bohr exciton radius. On the other hand, the CET of 200 °C and 250 °C lead to 8.7 ± 0.5 nm and 14.8 ± 1.0 nm, respectively. The change of the optical band gap is thus due to change in the size of CdSe with CET. Almost no change in the onset wavelength between 200 °C and 250 °C can be also explained by the fact that CdSe treated at temperature above 200 °C has bulk property due to deviation from size quantization.

Solvothermally induced CdSe crystal growth is related to the amount of heat energy transferred from different CET. To investigate difference in heat energy used for solvothermal crystal growth, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) measurement is performed. Fig. 6 shows the result of DSC measurement. For DSC measurement, one-cycle-coating of 0.3 M Cd2+ and 0.3 M Se2− is conducted and this CdSe-coated nanocrystalline TiO2 film is peeled off for the DSC measurement. Heating rate is determined to be 51.6 °C min−1 and 92.4 °C min−1 in order to match the CET condition corresponding to 100 °C and 200 °C, respectively. In Fig. 6, DSC curves show endothermic reaction and the area for the endothermic DSC curve represents change in enthalpy of the sample (ΔH) that can be calculated based on eqn (4),56 ΔH = KA(4)where K is calorimetric constant and A is area under the curve. K depends on the instrument, which is already reflected in the DSC curve. ΔH is estimated to be 3.77 J mg−1 and 8.66 J mg−1 for the CET of 100 °C and 200 °C, respectively. Since the calculated enthalpy corresponds to heat energy transferred to the sample, more heat energy is contributed to the nanoscale solvothermal reaction at 200 °C than at 100 °C, which is responsible for the larger CdSe.

Photovoltaic performance is investigated by contacting CdSe-sensitized TiO2 electrode with polysulfide electrolyte, in which platinized FTO serve as counter electrode. Fig. 7(a) shows photocurrent–voltage curves of the as-fabricated CdSe QD-sensitized solar cells. Photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As the CET changes from 100 °C to 150 °C, conversion efficiency is significantly improved from 0.42% to 1.22%, corresponding to 190% increment. Further improved efficiency of 1.74% is achieved when the CET is set on 200 °C. However, efficiency declines slightly to 1.00% at the CET of 250 °C. Significant improvement of performance is mainly attributed to the increased photocurrent density, where short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) increases from 2.84 mA cm−2 to 6.79 mA cm−2 and 11.34 mA cm−2 as the CET increases from 100 °C to 150 °C and 200 °C, respectively. Open-circuit voltage (VOC) is also improved from 0.410 V to 0.490 V and 0.503 V, which is associated with the increased JSC when considering the following eqn (5),57 (5)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, q is an electronic charge, Iinj is the flux of charge resulting from sensitized injection, ncb is the concentration of electrons on the surface of TiO2, ket is the rate constant of reduction reaction of oxidant and [Ox] is the concentration of oxidant in liquid electrolyte. Compared to the CET of 200 °C, photovoltaic performance for the CET of 250 °C is slightly degraded, which is mainly due to the lowered absorbance as observed in UV-vis spectra in Fig. 3(b). This decrease in absorbance is probably attributed to phase transition of CdSe from metastable cubic phase to hexagonal phase with relatively low absorption coefficient, as mentioned previously.54 Due to the solvothermally induced quantum confinement effect, EQE spectra in Fig. 7(b) show progressive shift of absorption onset from 600 nm to 700 nm and 800 nm as the CET increases from 100 °C to 150 °C and 200 °C, respectively. Photovoltaic performance is further improved by introducing a scattering TiO2 (500 nm in diameter) overlayer on the top of the 20 nm transparent layer, where the conversion efficiency is improved from 1.74% to 2.50% (JSC = 13.70 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.501 V, FF = 36.38%, Fig. 7(c) and Table 2). Improved conversion efficiency is mainly due to increased light harvesting in longer wavelength region (Fig. 7(d)). As a result, maximum EQE reaches 67.8% at 500 nm.

Conclusion
CdSe QD was coated on TiO2 surface by alternate spin coating of Cd2+ ions and Se2− ions. Size quantization of CdSe was successfully induced by the wet CdSe cluster on TiO2 surface at different temperatures. From the detailed investigation, we evaluated that growth of CdSe deposited on TiO2 surface resulted from nanoscale solvothermal reaction. In the absence of solvent, growth of CdSe was hardly observed. The amount of heat energy transferred to the wet CdSe on TiO2 surface was found to correlate with the size growth of CdSe. Size quantization effect was clearly demonstrated by the dye-sensitized solar cell. The so-called nanoscale solvothermal reaction (NSR) from the current study is expected to be a promising method to induce quantum confinement effect of CdSe.
