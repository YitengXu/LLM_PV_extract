Consequently, many efforts were directed toward enhancing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 and extending its response to the visible region. To head off these attempts, modification of TiO2 with noble metal nanoparticles (NMNPs) received considerable attention due to their role in accelerating the transfer of photoexcited electrons from TiO2 and also due to the surface plasmon resonance which induces the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under visible light irradiation. This insightful perspective is devoted to the vital role of TiO2 photocatalysis and its drawbacks that urged researchers to find solutions such as modification with NMNPs. In a coherent context, we discussed here the characteristics which qualify NMNPs to possess a great enhancement effect for TiO2 photocatalysis. Also we tried to understand the reasons behind this effect by means of photoluminescence (PL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Then the mechanism of action of NMNPs upon deposition on TiO2 is presented. Finally we introduced a survey of the behaviour of these noble metal NPs on TiO2 based on the particle size and the loading amount.
1. Introduction
TiO2 is known to exhibit photocatalytic activity due to the photo-generated charge carriers (negative electrons, e−, and positive holes, h+).1 Positive holes oxidize organic compounds, while negative electrons mainly reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide radical anions.2–4 In spite of the fact that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is among the highest for all semiconductors, one of the critical drawbacks of TiO2 is its high photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination rate which hinders its photocatalytic efficiency.5,6 If the recombination rate is quick (lifetime of charge carriers is about 30 ns) there is not enough time for other chemical reactions to occur.7–9
Another drawback of TiO2 is the fact that it cannot efficiently utilize visible light as the band gap of TiO2 is 3.0–3.2 eV (the exact value depends on the phase studied), so the generation of electron–hole pairs and degradation of organic compounds can occur only under ultraviolet illumination. Therefore, many efforts have been made to expand the photoresponse of TiO2 to longer wavelengths because UV radiation accounts for 4% energy of the incoming sunlight, while the visible light (wavelength above 400 nm) constitutes around 43% of solar energy.10 Hence, one of the greatest challenges for the photocatalyst study is to design new catalysts that exhibit a minimum recombination rate and high activity when illuminated by visible light.
Various approaches have been utilized to enhance the visible light activity of TiO2 such as non-metal doping,11–13 incorporation of carbonaceous nanomaterials such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and graphene14–17 and coupling with other semiconductors.18–22 Also the modification of TiO2 was not limited to doping with other dopants but also extended to tailoring TiO2 with high surface energy. In this regard, anatase TiO2[001] facets are known to show excellent photocatalytic activity due to their higher surface energy (0.90 J m−2)23 and low density of defects, which could inhibit the recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers at the grain boundaries. Therefore, the synthesis of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with exposed [001] facets is critical and challenging.
Also many attempts have been made to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by doping with noble metals which act as electron acceptors. The capture of photogenerated electrons from noble metals is assumed to repress the recombination of electron–hole pairs and facilitate the transfer of holes on the TiO2 surface. Hence, the photocatalytic activity can be enhanced in terms of a longer electron–hole pair separation lifetime.24–26
As deposition of noble metals on TiO2 is of great interest, many reviews had been published to illustrate the behaviour of noble metals in photocatalysis for guidance purposes. For example, in a review of Kowalska et al.27 they explicated the mechanism of photocatalytic reaction on Au/TiO2 under visible light irradiation by examining the action spectra and the properties of photocatalysts required for a high level of activity. Linic et al.28 reviewed water-splitting reactions on plasmonic-metal–semiconductor and the mechanisms by which metal surface plasmon resonance, SPR, can affect the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors. Kumar et al.29 attempted to provide a review focused on modified TiO2 photocatalysis besides highlighting the advancements made to improve the surface-electronic structure of titania with high efficiency. Zhou et al.30 focused on the most recent advances in the synthesis and photocatalytic properties of noble metal-based plasmonic composites under visible light. Pelaez et al.31 presented the development of different strategies to modify TiO2 for the utilization of visible light, including non-metal and/or metal doping, dye sensitization and coupling semiconductors. Hou et al.32 focused on recent work demonstrating plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic water splitting, reduction of CO2 with H2O to form hydrocarbon fuels, and degradation of organic molecules. Xuming et al.33 aimed primarily to understand the major mechanisms in plasmonic photocatalysis and to provide physical explanations accordingly. Also due to the increased accretion of the plasmonic photocatalysts, Wang et al.34 reviewed the recent synthetic routes and photocatalytic reaction tests performed using plasmonic photocatalysts. They dealt broadly with all types of plasmonics photocatalysis (e.g. NMNPs on semiconductors, insulators, carbon, halides, and graphene) and finally they provided important guidelines to be considered in constructing new plasmonic photocatalysts.
This perspective focuses on the reasons behind the superior photocatalytic activity of TiO2 upon deposition with NMNPs. For better understanding how the noble metals affect the electronic properties of TiO2, experimental analytical studies (photoluminescence, PL, and electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, spectra) and theoretical investigations (Density Functional Theory, DFT) are reviewed. Also the proposed mechanisms for this superior activity under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation are summarized. From the discussed studies, one can reach a conclusion that simplifying the parameters that govern the role of NMNPs (e.g. particle size and loading amount effects) is inadequate and more details and focused studies are necessary to understand the full picture.
2. General overview
To the best of our knowledge, the first attempt at doping TiO2 with noble metals was reported by Tauster et al.35 Since then, many studies focused on the modification of TiO2 by noble metal nanoparticles, NMNPs, like: Au,36–41 Ag,42–49 and Pt.50–58
For a long time, researchers have directed their focus to loading noble metal nanoparticles on the common TiO2. However, work on the visible-light-responsive anatase TiO2[001] facets using the SPR effect of noble metals has been rarely carried out. Yu et al.59 demonstrated the photocatalytic hydrogen production via novel visible-light driven plasmonic Pt/TiO2 nanosheets with a high percentage of exposed [001] facets. Also, Ag/TiO2 single-crystal nanosheets dominated by [001] facets were disclosed by Jiang et al.60 and assessed for the reduction of p-nitrophenol, Rhodamine B (RB) and ciprofloxacin (CIP). Their results revealed that the photocatalytic activity of Ag/TiO2 is much higher than that of TiO2. Therefore this hot topic is expected to grab the attention of many researchers for designing highly efficient visible light active photocatalysts.
In order to find out the most reactive noble metal upon deposition on TiO2, one needs to compare such noble metals. But few studies have been directed toward this point. In a study of Rupa et al.,61 a series of different noble metals loaded TiO2 was prepared via the same method (photodeposition) and at the same loading percentage (1%). Their photoreactivity was assessed toward the photocatalytic decolourisation of tartrazine dye under identical operational parameters, and the results revealed the order, Au/TiO2 > Ag/TiO2 ≈ Pt/TiO2, even all of them possess the same surface area (≈88 m2 g−1). Also in an analogous study the order obtained was Au/TiO2 > Pd/TiO2 ≈ Pt/TiO2 > Ag/TiO2 under the same conditions and at the same loading amount (1%) and approximately possessing a similar surface area as well (≈47 m2 g−1).62
Based on that, one can conclude that Au could be regarded as the most reactive among the others. But as shown in Fig. 1, one cannot confirm which metal induces the best performance among noble metals, as the obtained results were subjected to different parameters (e.g. loading amount) which are expected to affect the reactivity. So, to date, there has been no report that disclosed clearly the most reactive noble metal on TiO2. We believe that the Fermi level energy for each noble metal will be a major entrance to solve this puzzle. The electrochemical reduction reactions of the following noble metals are as follows (eqn (1)–(4)): Au3+ + 3e− → Au Eoreduction = 1.5 V(1) Pt2+ + 2e− → Pt Eoreduction = 1.2 V(2) Pd2+ + 2e− → Pd Eoreduction = 0.83 V(3) Ag+ + e− → Ag Eoreduction = 0.8 V(4)
The closer the values of the reduction potential to the valence band of TiO2, the more reactive the noble metal will be. So, the expected order will be Au/TiO2 > Pt/TiO2 > Pd/TiO2 ≈ Ag/TiO2 which matched, somehow, with the disclosed results.

In an attempt to reveal to what extent the researchers discussed the noble metal deposition behavior, presented herewith a summary of many studies in which, a focus is given only to how they emphasize the superior effect. For example, Subramanian et al.63 demonstrated that, in the case of Au/TiO2 NPs, the Fermi level is shifted to more negative potentials than that of pure TiO2. This is attributed to an increase in the charge storage and an improvement of charge separation. Christopher et al.64 attributed the enhanced visible activity of Ag/TiO2 to radiative transfer of energy mediated by surface plasmons from Ag NPs to TiO2, which leads to higher concentrations of the photogenerated charge carriers (e−–h+ pairs) in the semiconductor, and hence leading to higher photocatalytic activity. Seh et al.65 showed enhanced visible light activity of anatase Au/TiO2 NPs and attributed this enhancement to the strong localization of plasmonic near-fields close to the Au/TiO2 interface and the coupling of plasmonic near-fields to optical transitions involving localized electronic states in TiO2. Subramanian et al.63 also attributed an enhancement in the photocurrent under UV illumination after modification of TiO2 with NMNPs (Au or Ag) to the metal nanoparticles' ability to capture and store the photogenerated electrons.66,67 It was also evidenced by the work of Kočí et al.68 that the yield of methane and methanol from the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 increases upon modifying the TiO2 by Ag incorporation under UV illumination and they attributed this phenomenon to the formation of a Schottky barrier in the Ag/TiO2 contact region, which causes charge separation, thereby decreasing the electron–hole recombination rate, and increasing their lifetime.69 The work of Yogi et al.70 showed the enhancement effect upon deposition of Ag, Pt, and Au NPs on TiO2, for photodegradation of methylene blue dye and they attributed this to the trap of the photogenerated electrons by these metals, leading to high efficiency of charge separation.
In one of our previous studies, the effect of deposition of Ag NPs on TiO2 under ultraviolet irradiation was discussed. The increase of photocatalytic activity was attributed to electronic interaction occurring at the contact region between the metal deposits and the semiconductor surface which causes the removal of electrons from TiO2 into the vicinity of the metal particles leading to the formation of the Schottky barriers and in turn promotes the charge separation.71 Also, in a recent study by our group,72 deposition of Au NPs on TiO2 under both ultraviolet and solar irradiation was investigated and the enhancement effect was attributed to Schottky barriers under ultraviolet irradiation and to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) that induces a collective coherent oscillation of the conducting band electrons of the metal nanoparticles under solar irradiation.72 As a result of the SPR effect, Au NPs absorb resonant photons and transfer the electrons which originates from the intraband excitation of its 6sp electrons to the titania and this reduces molecular oxygen adsorbed to superoxide, O2˙−, on the surface of titania thereby facilitating dye degradation.

Table 1 shows a brief literature survey of NMNPs/TiO2 preparation methods and the promotion effect and how greatly the deposition of NMNPs affects the photodegradation rate.

3. Characteristics of NMNPs
Herein the main features behind the enhancement effect of noble metals are summarized in the context of the LSPR effect and the Schottky junction.
Firstly, an important characteristic of the NMNPs is that they have strong absorption of visible light due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect.97 Surface plasmons are the oscillations that can propagate at the interface of the metal and the semiconductor. As shown in Fig. 2, the incoming irradiation, which is an oscillating electromagnetic field, induces surface plasmon oscillation of the metal electrons. As the light wave passes through NMNPs, the metal electron density is polarized to one side and oscillates in resonance with the light frequency.
 Fig. 2  Surface plasmon resonance showing oscillations of electrons due to electromagnetic waves. 
For further clarification, Fig. 3 reveals how the SPR effect enhances the photoactivity of titania under visible light irradiation upon deposition with Au NPs. Owing to the photogenerated electrons which have negative potential higher than that of the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, the photogenerated electrons transfer from excited Au NPs to TiO2 NPs.98

The surface plasmon band (SPB) is known to be a strong and a broad band in the UV-visible spectrum of metallic NPs bigger than 2 nm [Fig. 4]. The position, the shape and the intensity of the SPB strongly depend on various factors: (i) the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium, (ii) the electronic interactions between the stabilizing ligands and the nanoparticles, which alter the electron density inside the nanoparticles, and (iii) the size, shape and monodispersity of the NPs.99

Secondly, an important feature of the noble metal NPs is the Schottky junction which results from the contact of the NMNPs and the semiconductor. It builds up an internal electric field close to the metal/semiconductor interface [Fig. 5]. Once they are created inside or near the Schottky junction, this would force the electrons and holes to move in different directions.101

4. Detection of the role of noble metals
Herein, the experimental and theoretical approaches used to understand the role of noble metal in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) are discussed.
4.1. Experimental approaches
The photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy technique has been used to investigate the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, migration, and transfer with the aim of better understanding the fate of electron–hole pairs in semiconductor particles.103–105 Several reports studied the effect of deposition of noble metals on TiO2 in terms of PL intensity and its impact on the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor. When Au NPs are deposited on TiO2, the PL intensity was found to decrease as a function of Au NPs loading. This is because of the decrease in the recombination which is due to the interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 to Au NPs.106 Likewise, for Ag/TiO2, the PL intensity was found to decrease with increasing Ag content, indicating that the Ag NPs could effectively hinder the recombination of the photoinduced electrons and holes.107
In a recent study,108 PL emission spectra had been used for interpreting the superior photocatalytic activity of TiO2 upon deposition with Pt NPs. Compared with the pure TiO2, deposition of Pt NPs on TiO2 leads to a decrease of both the UV and visible emissions. The decrease of the UV emission for Pt/TiO2 can be ascribed to the electron-scavenging effect of Pt, which acts as an electron acceptor due to transfer of electrons in the conduction band of the semiconductor to the electron acceptors in the solution, thus inhibiting the recombination of charge carriers on TiO2. Also, the considerable decrease of the visible emission suggests that Pt/TiO2 may inhibit the radiative recombination process of photogenerated electrons and holes in TiO2. The slower recombination of the photogenerated charges is advantageous for photocatalysis.
In a study by Yang et al.,109 PL intensities of Ag/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 were found to decrease which indicate the efficient separation of electron–hole pairs for optimal doping of noble metals on the TiO2 matrix. The same finding was disclosed in a study by Kwak et al.,110 in which PL intensity of Pd/TiO2 was lower than that of pure TiO2. They attributed this behavior to palladium atoms which play the role of electron capturers, and hence suppress the recombination process. The same finding was also discovered by Chen et al.,111 in which, the deposition of Ag and Au nanoparticles on TiO2 leads to extinction of the PL intensity as shown in [Fig. 6].

4.2. Theoretical approaches
In addition to experimental techniques, methods based on density functional theory, DFT, calculations have become a robust research tool for looking into the geometric and electronic properties of metal/oxide interfaces.
DFT calculations were found to be useful approaches to investigate the effectiveness of chemical bonds at the interface of Au/Pt clusters on the TiO2[110] surface.112 Hybrid PBE (Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof) calculations predict that the oxygen vacancy formation energy decreases by about 1.2–2.2 eV in the presence of Pt clusters and by about 0.2–0.7 eV in the presence of Au clusters. In contrast, GGA-PBE (Generalized Gradient Approximations of PBE) calculations predict that the oxygen vacancy formation energy decreases only by 0.9–1.5 eV in the presence of Pt clusters and by 0.2–0.4 eV in the presence of Au clusters. The effect is more pronounced for Pt clusters since Pt has a strong covalent type interaction with the TiO2 surface, while Au has only a weak filled-filled type interaction with TiO2. The formation of oxygen vacancies appears to lead to an enhancement of the photocatalytic activities of NMNPs–TiO2 under visible-light irradiation [Fig. 7].

Taken from ref. 112 with permission from American Institute of Physics. 
Also, DFT calculations were employed to investigate the effect of off-stoichiometric defects (oxygen vacancies or extra oxygen atoms at the Au–oxide interface) on the chemistry of oxide-supported Au nanostructures.113 The enhanced activity of supported Au is related to the existence of strong covalent bonds between the off-stoichiometric defects on the oxide support and the Au nanostructure. Defects on oxide surfaces play a critical role not only in anchoring metal particles, as had been proposed previously, but also in imparting chemical activity to the particles.113
Another study of Andrea et al.114 disclosed that DFT calculations predict a considerable increase of TiO2 reactivity upon deposition of titania films on Ag NPs, and they attributed this to the charge transfer from Ag NPs to the 3d Ti empty states. The same findings were published by Mete et al.,115 in which by DFT calculations they proved that Pt and Au noble metals promote the photocatalytic activity of TiO2[110] by narrowing of the band gap towards the visible region which results from impurity driven defect states of Pt and by acquiring metallic character due to an unpaired 6s electron.
5. Mechanism of superior activity of NMNPs/TiO2
Understanding the enhancement mechanism after deposition of noble metal upon titania is useful in the design of photocatalysts with high photocatalytic efficiencies. In this section, several mechanisms will be discussed in order to understand the optimum mechanism. There are two forms of electronic transitions due to the interaction with electromagnetic light interband and intraband transitions.116,117 Interband transitions occur from the occupied to the empty bulk bands. The energy required for this transition usually falls in the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum. For intraband transitions, they occur due to an electronic transition at the Fermi level in incompletely filled bands, or when a filled band overlaps in energy with an empty band. The energy required for this transition usually falls in the visible-NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
A question must be raised here, upon irradiation with UV and visible light, whether noble metals and titania are excited either separately or simultaneously? To answer this question four possibilities have been postulated as shown in Fig. 8, according to the following:33
 Fig. 8  Different irradiation states of the plasmonic photocatalytic systems. (a) Bandgap-excitation state, (b) LSPR state, (c) dual-excitation state; and (d) separate-excitation state. SC stands for semiconductor. Taken from ref. 33 with permission from Institute of Physics. 
The four states (i) the bandgap excitation state, only the semiconductor is excited; (ii) the LSPR state, only the metal nanoparticle is excited due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR); (iii) the dual-excitation state, both the metal nanoparticle and the semiconductor are excited simultaneously by the same light intensity; and (iv) the separate-excitation state, the semiconductor is excited by UV and the metal nanoparticle is excited by visible light due to LSPR.
Since the enhancement mechanisms under UV and visible light illumination are different, they will be discussed on an individual basis.
5.1. Mechanisms for ultraviolet irradiation
Under UV irradiation, the dominant proposed mechanism is the charge separation mechanism118 in which the photogenerated electrons in the semiconductors can transfer from the conduction band to the noble metal as shown in Fig. 9. As the presence of noble metals inhibits the electron–hole pair recombination in semiconductors the photocatalytic activity is enhanced.
 Fig. 9  Schematic diagram illustrating the charge separation mechanism. 
Also another mechanism is postulated based on the interband transitions in the NMNPs from fully occupied d-bands below the Fermi energy to the half filled sp band.119 NMNPs exhibit ultraviolet light absorption, causing the interband transition of 5d electrons to the 6sp band, 4d electrons to the 5sp band and 5d to the 6sp band for Au, Ag and Pt NPs respectively.120–122
For more clarification, as shown in Fig. 10, in a study of the photodegradation of phenol, due to absorption of ultraviolet irradiation, excitation of electrons from the 4d band to the 5sp band, yields high energy photogenerated electrons. Also the holes left in the inner d band have a greater tendency for capturing electrons from phenol than those in the outermost sp band.121
 Fig. 10  The band structures of the supported Ag NPs. Taken from ref. 121 with permission from Royal Society of Chemistry. 
As the energy of the UV irradiation is much higher than the SPR, therefore, the photocatalytic enhancement under ultraviolet is not related to the surface plasmon resonance of the NMNPs. So one can state that the two main characteristics of the NMNPs (namely, Schottky barrier and SPR) are the key factors for its function under ultraviolet and visible light illumination respectively.123–125
5.2. Mechanisms for visible irradiation
Tian et al.126 proposed a charge transfer mechanism to explain the enhancement effect upon loading Au or Ag NPs into TiO2 films under visible light illumination. In their proposed mechanism, the plasmon resonance excites electrons in Au or Ag, which are then transferred to the conduction band of TiO2. This charge transfer mechanism is similar to that of a dye-sensitized solar cell.127 Subsequently, other reports disclosed this mechanism to explain the enhanced photocatalytic water splitting,128 methyl orange decomposition,129 and photooxidation of formaldehyde130 observed under visible illumination. Mubeen et al.131 further elucidated this charge transfer mechanism, in which the surface plasmon decay generates electron–hole pairs in the gold, and the hot electrons produced in the decay of localized surface-plasmon polaritons which excited from Au NPs are directly injected into TiO2 by quantum tunneling.
Another mechanism proposed for plasmon enhanced photocatalysis is based on the local electric field enhancement associated with plasmonic nanoparticles.132 In this mechanism, the plasmon enhancement was attributed to the strong electric fields produced by the surface plasmon resonance of Au or Ag NPs. The collective oscillations of conduction electrons in metal nanoparticles resonate with the electromagnetic field of the incident light, which results in a considerable enhancement of the local electromagnetic fields at the metal–semiconductor interface. The schematic diagrams in Fig. 11 illustrate the difference between the local electric field mechanism and the charge transfer mechanism.
 Fig. 11  Schematic diagrams of the charge transfer mechanism (A) and the local electric field enhancement mechanism (B). 
In a study of Liu et al.133 electromagnetic simulations indicate that the enhanced photocatalytic activity in the visible range is due to the local electric field enhancement near the TiO2 surface, rather than the direct transfer of charge between the two materials.
Recently Zhang et al.134 suggested three mechanisms that could explain the enhanced photochemical reactivity of the noble metal modified TiO2 compared to pure TiO2 under visible light irradiation. In the first mechanism the photoexcited metal due to plasmon resonance can inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 upon excitation. Nevertheless, the band gap energies of e−–h+ are very different from the metal–semiconductor interface and there are no specific models for this process.135,136 Another mechanism is based on the interaction of TiO2 with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced electromagnetic fields (near field effect), which causes plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET) from metal NPs to TiO2.27,137 The effect of PRET is to enhance the electric field intensity in a small, well-defined location of the semiconductor, thereby increasing the power absorbed in that region. This procedure results in the rapid formation of e−–h+ pairs in the semiconductor. The third mechanism is based on efficient scattering mediated by LSPR (far field effect), which leads to longer optical path lengths for photons in TiO2 that raise the excitation of e−–h+ pairs.138
In order to differentiate between the mechanism under ultraviolet and visible irradiation a study of Hu et al.139 disclosed that Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectra revealed the interface electron transfer from Au NPs to the TiO2 conduction band under visible light irradiation and from TiO2 to Au NPs under UV illumination [Fig. 12].

Also, for further evidence of electron transfer direction under both visible and UV irradiation, EPR spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the electron migration through the noble metal–oxide interface. Vijayan et al.140 disclosed the EPR spectra of TiO2-NTs (nanotubes) and Pt/TiO2–NTs under UV and visible light illumination. They indicated that photogenerated electrons localize both in the bulk and at the surface of anatase TiO2–NTs under UV light illumination. While upon illumination at λ > 400 nm, the photon energy is inadequate to excite electrons from the valence to the conduction band of anatase; thus the EPR spectrum exhibits the absence of any signals for oxidized nanotubes [Fig. 13d]. Therefore, based on the disclosed results we can comfortably affirm the conclusion about the electron transfer through the noble metal/TiO2 interface under different illuminations (i.e. from Au NPs to TiO2 under visible light irradiation and from TiO2 to Au NPs under UV irradiation).

For the sake of ease understanding of the electron migration direction, herein we present the photocatalytic process reactions of Au/TiO2 for photodegradation of organic pollutants upon illumination with UV (eqn (5)–(11)) and visible light (12–13) irradiation:141 TiO2 + hν → TiO2(ecb− + hvb+)(5) hvb+ + H2Oads → OH˙ + H+(6) hvb+ + OH− → OH˙(7) TiO2(ecb−) + Au → TiO2–Au(e−)(8) TiO2–Au(e−) + O2 → TiO2–Au + O2˙−(9) ˙OH + pollutant → H2O + CO2(10) O2˙− + pollutant → H2O + CO2(11) Au + h(visible) → Au+(e−)(12) TiO2 + Au+(e−) → TiO2(e−) + Au(13)
Under UV irradiation, Au NPs trap the photogenerated electrons from TiO2 thereby inhibiting the recombination (eqn (8) and (9)). However, under visible light irradiation, Au NPs act as light harvesters therefore absorbing photons and then injecting electrons into the TiO2 conduction band (eqn (12) and (13)).141
6. Factors controlling NMNPs functions
It is known that the function of noble metals upon deposition on TiO2 NPs is dependent on some different operational parameters, which determine their efficiency even under identical photodegradation conditions. The morphology and the particle size are important parameters for understanding the optical properties of the noble metals.142 Also the deposition methods such as photo-deposition (PD), deposition–precipitation (DP), impregnation (IMP) and colloidal deposition (CD) have a great effect on the characteristics of the obtained nanoparticles in terms of shape, dispersion and particle size which in turn affect the photocatalytic efficiency. That way, it was disclosed that the photoproduction of H2 using Pt/TiO2 and Au/TiO2 NPs decreased in the order photodeposition > deposition–precipitation > impregnation method.143 However there is a quasi-consensus that the PD method gave the most reactive catalyst among the others;144 there is no rigid interpretation of this finding. In this perspective, our focus is exclusively oriented toward the two major factors: dosage and particle size.
6.1. The NMNPs dosage effect
The dosage of NMNPs is a critical component for determining the effect of noble metal deposition on TiO2 NPs to verify whether it will be separation or recombination centers.145 Therefore, many reports studied such effects and almost all the results are consistent with the same trend that upon increasing the loading amount up to a specified limit, the photoreactivity increases. Beyond this value, the photoreactivity gradually decreases due to the so-called “screening effect” which obscures a significant portion of the semiconductor surface from photons for band gap excitation and decreases O2˙− formation.146
Wongwisate et al.147 attributed the enhanced photodegradation of 4-chlorophenol upon decreasing the Au and Ag loading amounts on TiO2 to: (1) Au NPs on the TiO2 surface could cause a strong increase of the rate of oxygen reduction, (2) the accelerated formation of the superoxide anion radical, O2˙−, in the case of a small amount of Ag NPs loading resulting in decrease in the charge recombination probability. In this study the reported optimum value was >0.1% for both Ag and Au NPs. Tada et al.148 disclosed the same behavior for the proportional relationship between the loading amount and the enhancement effect of Ag NPs loaded TiO2 for the photodegradation of bis(2-dipyridyl)disulfide and attributed the detrimental effect upon exceeding the optimal dosage (0.24%) to the shielding effect and recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Also Smith et al.149 obtained the same finding and attributed the detrimental effect upon exceeding the optimal dosage to the reduced activity in the TiO2 surface area. And they reported the value of 0.25% for loading Ag NPs on TiO2 as an optimal dosage for the photodegradation of MB dye.149
In a recent study of Wen et al.,150 the optimal dosage for Au NPs deposited on TiO2 nanotubes for photodegradation of MB was found to be 5% and they interpreted the detrimental effect in terms of blocking TiO2 pores and in turn reducing the surface area. Liu et al.151 studied the photocatalytic activity of Ag/TiO2 NPs for phenol oxidation. They attempted to interpret the correlation between the Ag NPs loading amount and the photocatalytic efficiency in terms of EPR spectra. One can see from Fig. 14 that the intensities of signals C and D which are assigned to O2˙− produced on the loaded Ag NPs and surface Ti3+, respectively, are first enhanced with increase of silver loading up to 1.026 wt%, and then decreased with further increase of silver loading. Such EPR behavior of the NPs was found to correspond well to phenol photocatalytic oxidation. Therefore based on these results one could somehow attribute the proportional relationship between the photocatalytic activity and the EPR signal intensity to the amount of photogenerated electrons. This could be clarified in terms of electron–hole separation as upon increasing the loading amount of Ag NPs up to the optimum content, better electron hole separation was achieved. Upon further increasing Ag NPs beyond the optimum content, Ag NPs became a recombination center for photogenerated electrons and holes. Another supportive explanation according to the authors was based on the possibility of decrease in the amount of received photons when high (more than the optimal) loading of Ag NPs is used.

Another explanation for decreasing the photocatalytic activity beyond the optimum loading is the work of Jovic et al.,152 where they found that for Au/TiO2-P25 photocatalysts, the activity continuously decreased with Au loading above 2% (optimal dosage). The reason was attributed to the fact that at higher Au loadings, electron transfer between rutile, anatase and Au at the ‘hot spot’ sites is adversely affected which in turn affects the H2 production rate. This is because of Au NPs deposits at the interface sites between TiO2 crystallites (which create hotspots and favor H2 production) and also deposits on isolated anatase or rutile crystallites (which create less active sites for H2 production) as clearly shown in Fig. 15.152

Average Au nanoparticle sizes were similar at all Au loadings. Taken from ref. 152 with permission from Elsevier. 
6.2. The NMNPs size effect
The size of NMNPs is regarded as one of the main factors among the other in controlling their function. As a general rule, upon decreasing the particle size, the photocatalytic activity decreases. In spite of that, there are different interfering parameters which determine the particle size effect like surface area, surface coverage, dispersion and the screening effect. Many studies showed great interest in studying the opposite correlation between the size of noble metals especially Au NPs deposited on TiO2. This relationship could arise from several parameters, including the surface plasmon band position and intensity, Fermi levels of NMNPs, efficiency of electron ejection and interfacial contact between noble metals and titania.153
Recently in a relevant study by our group,72 we showed results revealing that the variation of Au NP sizes deposited on TiO2 affects the Safranin-O photodegradation as the photodegradation rate constant (k) of Safranin-O dye clearly decreases upon increasing the size of Au NPs as shown in Fig. 16. We proposed some reasons for the superior effects of Au deposits on photoactivity including: (1) the greater the number of Au NPs at the surface of the catalyst, smaller is the size of the deposited Au NPs, and the more Au atoms are present at the surface; (2) the quantum size effect of the Au NPs (3 nm < dAu < 8 nm),154 and (3) we also considered the so-called “screening effect” of the large Au NPs, as the deposited large Au makes part of the photocatalyst surface less accessible for photons which results in a low photoreaction rate.

However, the majority of researcher's interpretations of this phenomenon were directed mainly to the shift of the Fermi level of NMNPs. Cojocaru et al.141 stated that as the Fermi energy of the NMNPs increases with the decrease of the particle size, due to a quantum size effect, NMNPs with a definite size can possess an energy level in between that of the conduction band of TiO2 and the adsorbed oxygen to be able to capture the photoelectrons and subsequently transferred to the adsorbed oxygen thus leading to an effective separation of charges, and an increase of the photocatalytic activity of titanium.
For further clarification, the apparent Fermi levels of Au/TiO2 were determined to be −250, −270, and −290 mV vs. NHE (Normal hydrogen electrode) for 8, 5, and 3 nm size gold NPs respectively. Since the energy levels in the gold NPs are discrete, it is expected that there is a greater shift in the energy level for smaller size Au NPs than for larger ones. Thus, the composite with smaller Au NPs is expected to be more reductive than the one with larger Au NPs.155–157
In a recent study, 8.6 nm of gold nanoparticles in Au/TiO2 was found to be the optimal size in improving the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.77 In another study, for the photocatalytic production of H2 over Au/TiO2, the reaction rates increased with Au particle sizes up to 12 nm.158 Based on the disclosed results in this trend, understanding of the exact appropriate size of noble metals deposited on TiO2 so as to achieve the maximum photoefficiency is elusive so far.
Based on the above parameters, we can comfortably conclude that the photodegradation process is a complicated process as it depends on a variety of parameters in a non-systematic regime. The optimal dosage and size of NMNPs required for achieving the best photocatalytic performance of TiO2 could be different in various systems due to different morphologies, surface coverage, deposition method, and the operational parameters.
7. Conclusion
It is well known that TiO2 photocatalysis is attracting many researchers' interest. This is due to its distinctive physico-chemical and electronic properties which enable it to be used in a variety of applications like photoelectrochemical conversion, memory devices, air and water purification, water splitting to produce hydrogen, etc. The fact that TiO2 is able to absorb only UV irradiation, which is regarded as a small portion of sunlight, presents a great limitation to its use as a photocatalyst. So the main point in this perspective was directed toward understanding the enhancement effect upon modification of TiO2 with noble metals in order to minimize the major drawbacks of TiO2 as a photocatalytic material, i.e. its high band gap energy and recombination of charge carriers.
In order to clarify the role of the noble metal deposition effect in a better way, experimental and theoretical explanations were provided in this perspective. The mechanism of the noble metal effect had been provided in many reports. So herein, a detailed description of most of the suggested mechanisms was provided. Also, to a certain extent, the controversy of electron migration direction through the noble metal/TiO2 interface under UV and visible light irradiation was resolved by discussing EPR results.
Finally we presented many researchers' investigations on the effect of loading amount and particle size of NMNPs on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Their findings in this regard were discussed with the help of Transmission Electron Microscopy, TEM, and the innovative EPR technique.
We believe that loading amount and particle size parameters have complex impacts. So, one should not only attribute the effect of such parameters to the screening and the quantum size effects. Therefore, breaking in these complex impacts will open the floodgates to rational design of the ideal noble metal modified titania photocatalyst. So, in spite of the great efforts that have been made to study NMNPs/TiO2, it is obvious from this perspective that further progress is still needed to shed further light on the superior photocatalytic behaviors of NMNPs-modified titania.
