, Accepted 23rd August 2016First published on 25th August 2016AbstractHerein, amorphous RuO2 nanoflakes deposited on Ni nanofoam (NF) with diameters of ca. 30–100 nm are utilized as an innovative cathode in Li–O2 batteries for the first time. The stability of the RuO2/Ni NF cathode is shown to possess ca. 87.7% capacity retention after 75 cycles with minute alteration of the charge–discharge profiles. A capacity as high as 6537.8 mA h g−1 based on RuO2 weight can be reached at 0.02 mA cm−2 with a low charge potential of 3.78 V leading to a high voltaic efficiency of 70.11%. Energy densities range from 2702.97 W h kg−1 at a power density of 29.22 W kg−1 to 1746.32 W h kg−1 at 822.20 W kg−1. The superior performance of the RuO2/Ni NF results from the intimate contact between catalysts and current collector, and the porous nanostructure providing sufficient space for deposition of lithium oxides, and short lithium ion and oxygen diffusion pathways, as evidenced by the impedance analysis. The binder-less and carbon-free nature of the electrode prevent binder, electrode and excessive electrolyte decomposition, rendering it a prospective candidate for rechargeable Li–O2 batteries.
1. Introduction
Energy storage is indispensable in various applications, such as portable electronics, electric vehicles, and complementary power leveling of unstable wind or solar energies.1,2 Li-ion batteries are the most widespread energy storage device on account of their good cyclability and adequate energy density. Nonetheless, the capacities of Li-ion batteries are still mainly limited by the intercalation nature of the cathodes, such as LiCoO2 with a theoretical value of 274 mA h g−1. Accordingly, new cathode materials utilizing conversion reactions, such as O2 forming Li2O2 with ca. 1168 mA h g−1, are promising to raise the capacities and energy densities of Li batteries.1 Considering the active materials of the cathode only, the theoretical gravimetric energy densities of LiCoO2 and O2 (Li2O2) are 1014 and 3457 W h kg−1, respectively, indicating that ca. 3.4 times higher energy density can be achieved with an O2 cathode.
However, Li–O2 battery still suffers from several issues, such as low cyclability and low round-trip efficiency.1,3 Low cyclability results from the decomposition of electrolyte, positive carbon electrode and binder.1,3,4 Insoluble Li2CO3 accumulation from carbon electrode decomposition when charging voltage is larger than 3.5 VLi, and electrolyte decomposition catalyzed by carbon electrode cause electrode passivation and capacity fading.4 Binders, such as polyvinylidene fluoride, can be decomposed by superoxide O2−,5 which is an intermediate reactant of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).3 Round-trip efficiency (=Vdischarge/Vcharge) is low due to high overpotentials of ORR and lithium oxides decomposition, leading to below 70% for Li–O2 batteries compared to the 95% for Li-ion batteries.1 Formation of insulating Li2CO3 and lithium carboxylates6 upon cycling is responsible for high charge potentials, normally 1–1.5 V higher than the theoretical 2.96 VLi of Li2O2.1,4,7 Accordingly, non-carbon electrodes with catalysts active for both ORR and Li2O2 decomposition are necessary to reduce the overpotentials. Carbon nitride8 and transition metal oxides, such as MnO2,9,10 NiCo2O4,11 CoO,12 Co3O4 (ref. 13–15) and RuO2 (ref. 16–20) have been utilized as effective catalysts in Li–O2 batteries. Compared to other catalysts, RuO2 demonstrates lower charge potentials mostly below 4 VLi,16–20 and reversible reactions between Li2O2 and Li with minute electrolyte decomposition and performance fading.17–19 Non-carbon structures, such as Ni nanowire frameworks, can be alternative candidates to replace carbon current collector.21–23 Commercial Ni nanofoam consisting of interconnected Ni nanowires decorated with SnO2 demonstrates good stability, high capacity and rate capability for Li-ion anode.21 Ni nanowires can be synthesized by glycerol and Ni acetate.22,23 Surface area can be further increased by etching Ni into Ni oxalate nanostructures24 followed by reduction back into Ni under reducing atmosphere.25,26
In this work, Ni nanofoam (NF) decorated with amorphous RuO2 nanoflakes without any carbon additives and binders is utilized as a novel cathode for Li–O2 battery. Highest areal and specific capacities are 1.85 mA h cm−2 and 6537.84 mA h g−1 at 0.02 mA cm−2, respectively. Even at higher current density 0.2 mA cm−2, the RuO2/Ni NF cathode demonstrates 87.7% capacity retention after 75 cycles with average discharge and charge potentials ca. 2.5 and 3.5 V, respectively. These results manifest the superior performances in capacities, stability and round-trip efficiency of the RuO2/Ni NF electrode.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials synthesis
Detailed synthesis of RuO2/Ni NF can be found elsewhere.27 Briefly, Ni foam was etched in HCl before Ni nanowire growth. HCl-etched Ni foam was immersed in nickel acetate/glycerol at 370 °C.23 Oxalic acid/ethanol with 5 wt% water was utilized to etch Ni nanowire at 120 °C into Ni oxalate,24 which was reduced to Ni with H2 at 350 °C. Amorphous RuO2 was prepared with a modified sol–gel method.27–29 NaOH was dripped dropwise into RuCl3 solution to reach pH = 7. The mixed solution was centrifuged and washed with deionized water. RuO2 was dropped onto Ni nanofoam until its loading reached 0.28 mg cm−2 (0.5 mg on 15 mm diameter Ni foam disk). A balance (Explorer Pro, OHAUS EP64) with 0.1 mg accuracy was utilized to measure the weight difference before and after RuO2 deposition. RuO2/Ni NF composite was annealed at 150 °C for 2 h under vacuum before electrochemical measurement.
2.2 Materials characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, NovaNanoSEM 450) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDX) detector was used to characterize morphology and elemental analysis. Crystallinity was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical Empyrean). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips CM300) was used to investigate nanostructure and crystalline phase of RuO2. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic data were acquired using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR interferometer in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was carried out by using a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD XPS system equipped with an Al monochromatic X-ray source and an electron energy hemispherical analyzer (165 mm of mean radius). The vacuum pressure was kept below 3 × 10−9 torr, and a charge neutralizer was applied during the data acquisition.
2.3 Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical performance of the RuO2/Ni NF was evaluated by Biologic VMP3 with Li foil (MTI Corp.) negative electrode in a split cell (MTI Corp., EQ-STC-LI-AIR) using electrolyte comprising 1 M bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, Sigma-Aldrich) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%). The cell was assembled in an Ar filled glovebox (VAC Omni-lab). Celgard 2400 was used as the separator. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was scanned at 0.1 mV s−1 in 2.0 to 4.0 V (vs. Li/Li+). Galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were measured with various current densities. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) after charge with capacity limit 0.11 mA h cm−2 at Ewe = 0 V vs. OCV between 0.1 to 1 MHz with amplitude 10 mV were performed.
3. Results and discussion
Hierarchical Ni NF can serve as electrical conducting support for the RuO2 nanocatalysts, and the open-channel structure can provide short pathways of electrolyte and oxygen conduction. SEM images of the RuO2/Ni NF are shown in Fig. 1 and S1.† To synthesize Ni NF, HCl-treated Ni foam is heated at 370 °C with Ni(Ac)2/glycerol solution (Fig. 1a and S1a†). Ni2+ ions reduced with glycerol23 nucleate into nanoparticles and develop into nanowires (dia. ca. 200–700 nm) along the magnetic field of magnetic stir rotor of the hotplate. Self-assembled magnetic alignment of ferromagnetic materials has been demonstrated by Ni nanoparticles growing into nanowires in three-dimensional nonwoven clothes.30 XRD peaks at 45.1°, 52.5° and 76.9° indicates cubic Ni metal phase (ref. code: 01-070-0989, Fig. 2a) of the Ni nanowires. To further increase the surface area, etching Ni nanowires in oxalic acid/ethanol solution gives Ni oxalate leaf-like nanostructure (Fig. 1b and S1b†) with XRD peaks at 18.9°, 23.0°, 30.4°, 35.8°, and 41.2° (NiC2O4·2H2O, ref. code 00-014-0742). Ni NF with diameters ca. 30–100 nm (Fig. 1c and S1c†) can be obtained with Ni oxalate reduced by H2 at 350 °C. The XRD pattern shows only Ni metallic phases without the existence of Ni oxalate. RuO2/Ni NF electrode is manufactured by coating Ni NF with RuO2 nanoflakes followed by annealing at 150 °C (Fig. 1d and S1d†). EDX mapping (Fig. S1e†) demonstrates that RuO2 is uniformly dispersed on Ni NF. The RuO2/Ni NF electrode shows only Ni metal phase (Fig. 2a), indicating the low reflection intensity and amorphous nature of the RuO2 nanoflakes. The RuO2 nanoflakes consist of nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 2–3 nm (Fig. 2b). Weak selected area electron diffraction rings further confirm that the RuO2 is amorphous.

RuO2/Ni NF is tested in a two-electrode configuration with Li foil as the counter electrode. CV profiles are measured in 2.0–4.0 V at 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 3a). Without RuO2 coating, Ni NF under O2 atmosphere shows negligible current, demonstrating that Ni NF neither decompose the electrolyte nor contribute to the charge–discharge capacities. For RuO2/Ni NF in 1 atm Ar, the CV curve shows rectangular shape without obvious redox peaks, which can be attributed to the lithiation effects31–33 and pseudocapacitive behaviors28,29,34 of amorphous RuO2. Galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of RuO2/Ni NF in 1 atm Ar (Fig. 3b) showing linear-like zigzag curves without clear plateaus further exhibit capacitive and lithiation characteristics, corresponding to Li1.57RuO2 with capacity ca. 316 mA h g−1 based on RuO2 weight. Once oxygen is introduced, higher current density starting from ca. 2.75 V and reaching maximum at ca. 2.20 V is observed in the cathodic scan, suggesting the formation of lithium oxides, including Li2O2 and LiO2-like species.35–39 In the anodic scan, the sharp peak at ca. 3.22 V and a broad peak at ca. 3.70 V can be attributed to the oxidation of lithium oxides or hydroxide.35,36,38–40 Introduction of O2 results in the charge–discharge plateaus and capacity improvements for the RuO2/Ni NF electrode (Fig. 3c), indicating the decomposition and formation of lithium oxides. Charge–discharge capacities at 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mA cm−2 are 1.85, 1.00, 0.76 and 0.42 mA h cm−2, corresponding to 6537.8, 3540.4, 2682.5 and 1501.2 mA h g−1 based on RuO2 weight, respectively. Round-trip or voltaic efficiencies at 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mA cm−2 are 70.11% (2.65 V/3.78 V), 66.58% (2.53 V/3.80 V), 63.28% (2.43 V/3.84 V), and 61.70% (2.40 V/3.89 V), respectively. Lower voltaic efficiencies and higher overpotentials at increased current densities are due to electrode kinetic effects.41 Stability of the RuO2/Ni NF electrode is demonstrated in 2.0–4.05 V at 0.2 mA cm−2 with minute change of the charge–discharge profiles in 75 cycles (Fig. 4a). The capacity retention is ca. 87.7% after 75 cycles (Fig. 4b) with average coulombic efficiency 102.65%, which results from the lower charge capacity attributed to the insufficiently high charge potential and incomplete removal of discharge byproducts. The lower charge voltage is set to prevent excessive electrolyte decomposition at high potentials and to improve electrode stability.4 The periodic capacity variation results from the temperature fluctuation42,43 during a day. The morphology of fully discharged electrode (Fig. S2a and b†) demonstrates that the void space between Ni NF is covered with discharge products. XRD pattern (Fig. S2c†) with peaks at 20.7°, 32.7° and 36.0° demonstrates LiOH (ref. code 01-085-0777)40 is the principal discharge product. The existence of LiOH is further confirmed by FTIR measurement (Fig. S2d†).44 Recent studies reveal that discharge product of LiO2 (ref. 45) and Li2O2 (ref. 40) can chemically react with H2O to form LiOH, and low charge potentials are observed for the decomposition of LiOH either by LiI redox mediator45 or Ru catalyst.40 In this study, the hydrous nature of the RuO2 nanoflakes is shown in the XPS measurement (Fig. S2e†).27 It is proposed that the LiO2-like species and Li2O2 formed during discharge react with the water of hydrous RuO2 following similar reaction pathways: 4LiO2 + 2H2O → 4LiOH + 3O2;45 Li2O2 + 2H2O → 2LiOH + H2O2,40 while the RuO2 might catalyze the LiOH decomposition during charge: 2LiOH → 2Li+ + ½O2 + H2O + 2e−,40 which can explain the low charge potentials (mostly below 4 V) of the RuO2/Ni NF cathode.

It is noted that in Fig. 3c the discharge curves polarize (rapid voltage drop) at lower current densities (0.02 and 0.05 mA cm−2) with larger capacities at the end of the discharge, while polarization does not obviously occur at higher current densities (0.1 and 0.2 mA cm−2) with lower capacities. The non-polarized curves and lower capacities at higher current densities are commonly observed in various Li-ion anodes41,46 and cathodes47,48 owing to slow ionic diffusion in the active materials.49 In addition, deep discharge results in large amount of discharge products, which could cause pore blockage or loss of electrical contacts due to the volume expansion.50 Cycling stability could be improved if the deep discharge is prevented. Compared to cycling without deep discharge (Fig. 4a), cycling of the RuO2/Ni NF electrode at 0.1 mA cm−2 after 3 full CV cycles in 2.0–4.0 V at 0.1 mV s−1, which are analogous to deep discharge–charge cycles, with capacity limit (0.28 mA h cm−2) demonstrates rapid performance fading in terms of end discharge potentials diminishing from 2.21 V to 1.96 V (11.3% loss) in only 13 cycles (Fig. S2f†). Accordingly, cycling without deep discharge promotes the stability of the electrode.
Performance of the carbon-free RuO2/Ni NF cathode are compared with other non-carbon RuO2 electrodes and Li-ion cathodes in a Ragone plot (Fig. 5) with energy and power densities based on the total weight of cathode, including RuO2 catalysts, lithiated lithium and lithium oxides. Energy density 2702.97 W h kg−1 can be reached at 29.22 W kg−1, and it is 1746.32 W h kg−1 when power density increases to 822.20 W kg−1. RuO2/Ni NF cathode performs better than RuO2 hollow sphere (HS)17 and nanosheet (NS),18 RuO2 on nanoporous gold (RuO2/NPG),16 and traditional Li-ion cathodes, such as LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2,1,51 LiCoO2 and LiFePO4.1,52 The superior performance can be credited to the intimate electrical contact between Ni NF and RuO2, and the porous framework allowing access for both the discharge product deposition and short electrolyte pathway for lithium ions and oxygen diffusion.

EIS analysis with equivalent circuit model (Fig. 6a) is performed to investigate the RuO2/Ni NF cathode after cycling (Fig. 6b). Experimental results are fitted by straight lines with fitting parameters (Table 1). Constant phase elements (CPEs) are non-ideal capacitances with Q analogous to capacitance and the ideality factor n. Rs is the equivalent series resistance (ESR) for the electrolyte, current collectors and electrode materials.53–57 The first parallel branch (RINT + CPEINT) accounts for the interfacial contact between RuO2 catalyst and Ni NF. The second branch describes the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers (RSEI + CPESEI) and lithium ion and oxygen diffusion in liquid phase near the electrode surface (CPELD). The third branch is responsible for double-layer impedance (CPEDL), charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the interface of electrolyte and active materials,58 and lithium ion diffusion within RuO2 (CPESD). The first depressed semicircle is attributed to the SEI layers and RuO2/Ni NF interfaces.58,59 The second semicircle results from charge transfer impedance.58,59 The low frequency tail is ascribed to lithium ion diffusion in active materials,57 and lithium ion and oxygen diffusion in the electrolyte, represented by CPESD and CPELD, respectively. CPE for diffusion processes has been successfully utilized in the other systems.55,60,61

The impedance data fitting demonstrates the electrode improvement after cycling. In our Li–O2 battery system, O2 could be reduced into O2− or O22− by the reaction: O2 + ne− → O2n−, n = 1 or 2. With higher O2 concentration, charge transfer reaction is faster, leading to lower RCT. RCT decreases from 950 Ω after 1st cycle and stabilized after 6th cycles at ca. 110 Ω, indicating facilitated oxygen diffusion pathway62,63 and less agglomeration of the cathode. Rs slightly increasing from 12 to 17.5 Ω is ascribed to minute accumulation of reaction byproducts. RSEI and CPESEI fluctuation implies the variation of the SEI layer thickness and composition. Constant RINT and CPEINT indicate stable contact between RuO2 and Ni NF. These results show the RuO2/Ni NF electrode is relatively stable during cycling, and provide evidences for the superior performance of RuO2/Ni NF cathode due to intimate contact and effective lithium ions and oxygen diffusion in the porous electrode.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the utilization of RuO2/Ni NF as the cathode for Li–oxygen battery. Charge–discharge capacity as high as 6537.8 mA h g−1 and 1.85 mA h cm−2 can be reached at 0.02 mA cm−2 with 70.11% voltaic efficiency. Superior energy and power densities resulting from intimate contact between catalysts and substrate, and the porous nanostructure for oxides deposition and short diffusion pathway, are demonstrated in the Ragone plot and evidenced in the EIS analysis. Stability of the RuO2/Ni NF cathode is shown in 75 cycles with ca. 87.7% capacity retention, which further renders the RuO2/Ni NF electrode a promising candidate in Li–air batteries.
