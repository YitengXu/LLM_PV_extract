, Accepted 10th May 2018First published on 18th May 2018AbstractIsomer-controlled [70]fullerene bis-adducts can achieve high performance as electron-acceptors in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) because of their stronger absorption intensities than [60]fullerene derivatives, higher LUMO energy levels than mono-adducts, and less structural and energetic disorder than random isomer mixtures. Especially, attractive are cis-1 isomers that have the closest proximity of addends owing to their plausible more regular close packed structure. In this study, propylene-tethered cis-1 bismethano[70]fullerene with two methyl, ethyl, phenyl, or thienyl groups were rationally designed and prepared for the first time to investigate the OPV performances with an amorphous conjugated polymer donor (PCDTBT). The cis-1 products were found to be a mixture of two regioisomers, α-1-α and α-1-β as major and minor components, respectively. Among them, the cis-1 product with two ethyl groups (Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC) showed the highest OPV performance, encouraging us to isolate its α-1-α isomer (Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC) by high-performance liquid chromatography. OPV devices based on Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC and Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC with PCDTBT showed open-circuit voltages of 0.844 V and 0.864 V, respectively, which were higher than that of a device with typical [70]fullerene mono-adduct, [70]PCBM (0.831 V) with a lower LUMO level. However, the short-circuit current densities and resultant power conversion efficiencies of the devices with Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (9.24 mA cm−2, 4.60%) and Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (6.35 mA cm−2, 3.25%) were lower than those of the device with [70]PCBM (10.8 mA cm−2, 5.8%) due to their inferior charge collection efficiencies. The results obtained here reveal that cis-1 [70]fullerene bis-adducts do not guarantee better OPV performance and that further optimization of the substituent structures is necessary.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have attracted scientific and industrial attention due to their advantages of low cost, lightweight, flexibility, and solution processing.1–5 The photoactive layer generally comprises a blend film with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure of electron-donating conjugated polymers and electron-accepting organic semiconductors. Fullerene derivatives have been widely utilized as electron-acceptors5 because of their reversible reduction behaviors, outstanding electron affinities, and excellent electron-transporting properties originating from their small reorganization energies of electron transfer,6 whereas non-fullerene electron acceptors, exhibiting high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), have recently emerged as alternatives.7–10
PCEs of OPV devices are determined by the product of short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF); therefore, all three factors should be increased to achieve a high PCE.1,2 [70]Fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) are preferentially employed in high-performance OPVs instead of [60]fullerene derivatives owing to the former's better light-harvesting ability in the visible region, which improves JSC.11,12 The higher solubility of [70]fullerene derivatives than those of [60]fullerene derivatives is beneficial for device fabrication processes. Another strategy for developing high-performance acceptors is the use of fullerene bis-adducts.1,13 By increasing the number of addends from one to two, the degree of π-conjugation is reduced and the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is raised. Since VOC is generally proportional to the energy difference between the LUMO of the electron-acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the electron-donor,1,2 the rise in the LUMO energy of electron-acceptors improves VOC. Bis-[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (bis-[60]PCBM),14 indene-C60 bis-adduct ([60]ICBA),15 and indene-C70 bis-adduct ([70]ICBA)12 are successful examples of fullerene bis-adduct acceptors in OPVs. However, even if both the addends are identical and symmetric and additions are limited to occur at [6,6]-bonds, there are 8 possible regioisomers of [60]fullerene bis-adducts. Furthermore, [70]fullerene bis-adducts have 38 possible regioisomers16 because a [70]fullerene cage has four different types of non-equivalent [6,6]-bonds, i.e., α-, β-, γ-, and δ-type bonds (Fig. 1a),17–20 although the differences in reactivity (α > β > γ > δ) and steric hindrance reduce the number of bis-adduct regioisomers actually obtained.21,22 Due to different structural and electronic properties of each regioisomer, disorders in molecular packing and energy levels are found in BHJ films while using the regioisomer mixture, which may deteriorate JSC and FF of BHJ OPV devices.12,14,15 Therefore, the development of regioisomer-controlled acceptors is effective for improving OPV device performance, which has been proven by various examples of regioisomer-free [60]fullerene bis-adducts.23–35

Regioisomer-controlled [70]fullerene bis-adducts are expected to be high-performance acceptors for BHJ OPVs, as is evident from the above argument. However, the number of reports that demonstrate this is limited36–39 compared to the case of regioisomer-free [60]fullerene bis-adducts.23–35 This is due to the synthetic difficulty originating from the formation of a complicated mixture containing multiple regioisomers of [70]fullerene bis-adducts. In a pioneering work by Wong and coworkers,37 a single regioisomer of [70]ICBA, i.e., α-7-α′ isomer (Fig. 1b),40 in which two indene units were attached at α-bonds belonging to different hemispheres with an angle of “2 o'clock”, was carefully isolated from the regioisomer mixture by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The regioisomer pure α-7-α′-[70]ICBA exhibited better OPV device performance than the [70]ICBA regioisomer mixture. We devised tether-directed bis-functionalization of [70]fullerene with an ethylene-bridged indene dimer (1,2-bis(3-indenyl)ethane, BIE) as reactant to selectively obtain a relatively close substituent pattern, i.e., cis-2 (α-2-α) type isomer (Fig. 1b),40 in which two indene units were attached at α-bonds of hexagons next to each other.38 Note here that steric hindrance between the addends would inhibit the formation of such a close substitution pattern if the tether-directed effect was absent.23,27 The OPV based on BIE–[70]fullerene bis-adduct isomer with cis-2 configuration, cis-2-[70]BIEC and poly(3-hexylthiophene) showed a remarkable PCE of 4.2%, which was higher than those with the regioisomer mixture of BIE–[70]fullerene bis-adduct (2.2%), BIE–[70]fullerene mono-adduct (2.2%), BIE–[60]fullerene bis-adduct isomer with cis-2 configuration (2.8%), and even [70]PCBM (3.8%). This result has encouraged us to use cis-1 isomers of [70]fullerene bis-adducts having the closest proximity of two addends on a [70]fullerene cage because of their plausible regular close packing in the BHJ structure with conjugated polymers.
Recently, Echegoyen et al. succeeded in synthesizing a bismethano[70]fullerene derivative with cis-1 configuration, i.e., attached to [6,6]-bonds in the same hexagon, through a tether-directed remote functionalization method.16,41 They conducted a reaction between [70]fullerene and 1,3-dibenzoylpropane bis-p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazone (Ph2-PBTH) as addend precursor, yielding propylene-tethered cis-1 bismethano[70]fullerene with two phenyl groups (Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC, Scheme 1). Ph2-cis-1-PBC was further separated to α-1-α and α-1-β isomers (Fig. 1b) by preparative thin layer chromatography and their structures were fully characterized. However, the photovoltaic properties of these tethered bis-adducts of [70]fullerene were not evaluated. In this study, for the first time, we utilized propylene-tethered cis-1 bismethano[70]fullerene as an electron-accepting material in OPV devices. Bis-adducts with methyl, ethyl, phenyl and thienyl groups (Scheme 1) were designed as substituents based on theoretical calculations on the degree of molecular packing (i.e., packing density) and prepared for investigating the substituent effects on film structures and photovoltaic properties of blend films with an amorphous conjugated polymer donor, poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT).42,43

Results and discussion
Densely packed fullerenes in blend films are advantageous over loosely packed ones because the former provides films with higher electron mobilities than the latter.17 This helps achieve higher performance for fullerene acceptor-based OPV devices. In addition, well-packed fullerenes at the donor–acceptor interface facilitate charge dissociation.44,45 Therefore, optimized structures for solid systems of propylene-tethered bismethano[70]fullerenes with various substituents, i.e., R2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (R = methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), i-propyl (iPr), cyano (CN), phenyl (Ph), thienyl (Th), and pyridyl (Py)) (Fig. S1†), were calculated using periodic boundary conditions on MOPAC to sort the suitable substituents. Volumes of one molecule (V0) and of a unit cell (V) were obtained based on the optimized structures (Table 1 and Fig. S2†). The unit cells included four molecules and the degree of molecular packing was defined as 4V0/V.46 Among alkyl-substituted bis-adducts (R = Me, Et, iPr), the ethyl-substituted one showed the smallest V (5170 Å3) and highest degree of packing (0.712), suggesting high potential as an electron-accepting material in OPV devices. The packing degree of Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC was higher than that of [70]PCBM (0.683, Table 1). The packing degree of iPr2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (0.667) was slightly higher than that of Me2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (0.643). However, the insulating alkyl chain of iPr2-α-1-α-[70]PBC was longer than that of Me2-α-1-α-[70]PBC. Overall, Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC and Me2-α-1-α-[70]PBC were chosen as synthetic targets. In propylene-tethered bismethano[70]fullerenes with aromatic substituent groups (R = Ph, Th, Py), the phenyl- and thienyl-substituted ones possessed higher packing degrees (0.660 and 0.670, respectively) than the pyridyl one (0.639). Thus, Ph2-α-1-α-[70]PBC and Th2-α-1-α-[70]PBC were selected. Although CN2-α-1-α-[70]PBC exhibited a higher packing degree (0.672), synthetic difficulty impeded the attempt.

Propylene-tethered cis-1 bismethano[70]fullerene with methyl, ethyl, or thienyl groups (R2-cis-1-[70]PBC (R = Me, Et, Th)) was synthesized using the method used for Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC (Scheme 1).16 The reaction between [70]fullerene and addend precursor, 1,3-dicarbonylpropane bis-p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazone (R2-PBTH) yielded a crude product, which was purified by silica gel chromatography using CS2 as eluent and then preparative HPLC with a Buckyprep column using toluene as eluent. Only three [70]fullerene-based fractions, i.e., unreacted pristine [70]fullerene, R2-cis-1-[70]PBC, and multiple adducts, were eluted during HPLC. The overall yields of R2-cis-1-[70]PBC with Me, Et, and Th groups were 5.2%, 28%, and 17%, respectively. Analyses of the HPLC traces revealed that the cis-1 products consisted of two regioisomers, α-1-α as the major component (60–78%) and α-1-β as the minor one (Table 2 and Fig. S3, ESI†). This was consistent with the previous result for Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC (α-1-α:α-1-β = 78:22).16,47 Owing to the difference in the reactivities of [6,6]-bonds in the [70]fullerene cage (α > β > γ > δ), the first reaction occurred mainly at an α-bond. In addition, the short propylene chain limited the second reaction site to the α- or β-bond on the same hexagon. The structures of R2-cis-1-[70]PBC (R = Me, Et, Th) were characterized by 1H-NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (Experimental section). UV-vis absorption spectra of R2-cis-1-[70]PBC (R = Me, Et, Ph, Th) showed similar absorption shapes and intensities as those of [70]PCBM (Fig. S4, ESI†).

Solubility tests of R2-cis-1-[70]PBC (R = Me, Et, Ph, Th) in a standard organic solvent for OPV device fabrication, i.e., o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), were carried out at room temperature (Table 2). The solubility of Me2-cis-1-[70]PBC (3.6 g mL−1) was found to be unsatisfactory for film formation by the spin-coating technique. Considering the low solubility and theoretically-predicted undesirable loose packing (vide supra), the properties of Me2-cis-1-[70]PBC were not examined subsequently. The bis-adduct with thienyl groups, Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC, exhibited solubility (5.8 mg mL−1) somewhat being higher than that of Me2-cis-1-[70]PBC and was used for OPV device fabrication (vide infra). Other bis-adducts, Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC and Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC, possessed solubilities (11.6 and 13.8 mg mL−1, respectively) sufficient for solution processes, whereas they were much lower than that of a widely used [70]fullerene mono-adduct acceptor, [70]PCBM (62.9 mg mL−1).
Electrochemical properties of R2-cis-1-[70]PBC (R = Et, Ph, Th) containing α-1-α (60–78%) and α-1-β isomers were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements (Fig. S5, ESI†). The LUMO energy levels determined from the electrochemical data are listed in Table 2 together with that of [70]PCBM. The LUMO levels of R2-cis-1-[70]PBC were 30–40 mV higher than that of [70]PCBM, which was desirable for photovoltaic application, improving VOC.1,2 To gain insight into the electronic structures of R2-cis-1-[70]PBC, we performed DFT calculations of α-1-α isomers using the RB3LYP/6-31G(d) model. LUMO levels were obtained after geometry optimization, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The theoretical LUMO levels of R2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (R = Et, Ph, Th) were similar (−2.90, −2.87, and −2.90 V, respectively) and significantly higher than that of [70]PCBM (−3.06 V), which agreed with those obtained from electrochemical measurements (Table 2). The orbital distributions of the HOMOs and LUMOs of the fullerene bis-adducts were primarily found only in the [70]fullerene cage and delocalized throughout the entire cage (Fig. 2). Theoretical calculations of R2-α-1-β-[70]PBC contained in R2-cis-1-[70]PBC as minor component (22–40%) showed similar LUMO energy levels and orbital distributions as those of R2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (Fig. S6, ESI†).

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of R2-cis-1-[70]PBC (R = Et, Ph, Th) containing α-1-α and α-1-β isomers as major and minor components, OPV devices with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:fullerene/TiOx/Al configuration were fabricated. The detailed device fabrication process is described in the Experimental section. The average current density–voltage characteristics and photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 3a and Table 3, respectively. Since the solubility of Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC in ODCB was lower than those of Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC and Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC (Table 2), the optimized weight ratio of fullerene derivative in a mixed solution with PCDTBT was lower in PCDTBT:Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC ([PCDTBT]:[fullerene] = 1:1 (w/w)) than in PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC and PCDTBT:Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC (1:3 (w/w)) (Table 3).

The convolution of the spectral response in (b) with the photon flux of the AM 1.5G spectrum provided the estimated JSC values of 8.82, 3.85, 1.98, and 10.8 mA cm−2, respectively.

The OPV device with Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC revealed a significantly higher PCE of 4.60% than those with Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC (1.20%) and Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC (0.59%) (Table 3). JSC (3.81 and 2.13 mA cm−2) and FF (0.364 and 0.327) of the devices with Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC and Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC were remarkably lower than those of the Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC-based device (9.24 mA cm−2 and 0.590). Reflecting the inferior JSC values, the incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCEs) of devices with Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC and Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC were significantly lower than those of the Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC-based device over the entire visible region (Fig. 3b). Although PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC film exhibited higher absorption than PCDTBT:Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC and PCDTBT:Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC in the region 430–530 nm (Fig. S7, ESI†), the difference in absorption intensity could not explain the significant difference in the IPCE values. Additionally, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of all blend films displayed no significant signals, reflecting the amorphous nature of PCDTBT.
To search for a reason regarding poor OPV performances of the devices with Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC and Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC, the blend film structures of photoactive layers were examined with an optical microscope. As shown in Fig. 4, aggregates with sizes of tens of micrometers were formed in PCDTBT:Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC and PCDTBT:Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC. Similar large aggregates were absent in PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC, suggesting that the aggregates did not consist of PCDTBT but fullerenes in the blend films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) visualized that the film surface roughnesses of PCDTBT:Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC and PCDTBT:Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC (rms = 2.3 and 1.9 nm, respectively) at sites other than the aggregate were much larger than that of PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (rms = 0.59 nm) (Fig. S8, ESI†). These results suggested that Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC and Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC had strong cohesive natures even in the blend film with amorphous PCDTBT. Bicontinuous network structures of donor and acceptor domains were poorly formed in PCDTBT:Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC and PCDTBT:Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC, resulting in inferior JSC and FF values.

To investigate the diffusion efficiency of excitons generated in the polymer domain to the polymer–fullerene interface, we measured the steady-state photoluminescences of the blend films (Fig. S9, ESI†). The emission from PCDTBT was quenched efficiently (>98%) in PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC, PCDTBT:Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC, and PCDTBT:Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC. This result suggested that Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC and Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC molecules also existed outside the large aggregates and that most of the excitons generated by polymer absorption were quenched by fullerene molecules scattered across the polymer domain. However, such quenching did not lead to efficient photocurrent generation because of poor formation of an effective electron-transporting pathway to the electrode.
As expected, VOC of the OPV with Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (0.844 V) was slightly higher than that with a prevalent high-performance [70]fullerene acceptor, [70]PCBM (0.831 V) (Table 3), as the result of the elevated LUMO level of Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC by bis-functionalization. However, JSC and FF of the PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC-based device (9.24 mA cm−2 and 0.590) were slightly lower than those of the PCDTBT:[70]PCBM-based one (10.8 mA cm−2 and 0.618), irrespective of the comparable light-harvesting efficiency (Fig. S7†). The lower JSC and FF led to the inferior PCE of PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (4.60%) relative to that of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (5.55%). The smoother film surface of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (rms = 0.35 nm) than that of PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (rms = 0.59 nm) indicated the formation of a more suitable bicontinuous donor–acceptor network structure in PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (Fig. S10, ESI†). More importantly, the electron mobility of PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (5.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) estimated by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement was much lower than that of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (6.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table 3). The plausible lower charge collection efficiency of PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC than PCDTBT:[70]PCBM as a consequence of the difference in the electron mobilities resulted in the inferior OPV device performance.
The lower OPV performances of devices with R2-cis-1-[70]PBC (R = Et, Ph, Th) than that with [70]PCBM might be due to inhomogeneity of R2-cis-1-[70]PBC containing two regioisomers, i.e., α-1-α and α-1-β. Disorders of molecular packing structures and electronic properties caused by regioisomer inhomogeneity may decrease electron mobility in fullerene domains. To shed light into the regioisomer effect on film structure and OPV performance, the major α-1-α isomer was further isolated from the Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC isomer mixture, which had showed the highest PCE among the R2-cis-1-[70]PBC isomer mixtures (R = Et, Ph, Th), using preparative HPLC technique with a 5PBB column (Fig. S11(a), ESI†). Collection of the minor α-1-β isomer could not be conducted because of the low composition ratio (α-1-α:α-1-β = 78:22, Table 2) in Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC that made it difficult to obtain sufficient amount of the α-1-β isomer for OPV device fabrication. The purity of the isolated α-1-α isomer sample (denoted as Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC) was estimated by HPLC trace and found to be >99% (Fig. S11(b), ESI†).48 The solubility test in ODCB at room temperature revealed that Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC possessed lower solubility (6.2 g mL−1) than Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (11.6 g mL−1, Table 2). The highly symmetrical substitution structure of Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (Scheme 1) may have enhanced its tendency to form insoluble aggregates. The optical and electrochemical properties of Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC were almost identical to those of Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC, reflecting the high content of Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC in Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (Fig. S12, ESI†).
The OPV device based on PCDTBT:Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC blend film was fabricated by the same procedure as the device with PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC. The optimized weight ratio of fullerene in mixed solution with PCDTBT ([PCDTBT]:[Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC] = 1:2 (w/w)) was lower than PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC ([PCDTBT]:[Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC] = 1:3 (w/w)) (Table 3) on account of the lower solubility of Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC. PCE of the OPV device with Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC was lower (3.25%) than that with Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (4.60%) (Fig. 5a and Table 3). Although VOC and FF of the PCDTBT:Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC-based device (0.864 V and 0.593) were rather comparable to those of the PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC-based one (0.844 V and 0.590), JSC of the former (6.35 mA cm−2) was significantly lower than that of the latter (9.24 mA cm−2). Consistently, IPCE of the former device was lower than that of the latter over the entire visible region (Fig. 5b). The slightly decreased absorption intensity of PCDTBT:Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC relative to that of PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (Fig. S13(a), ESI†) was one of the reasons for inferior JSC. The decrease in film thickness (Table 3) owing to the lower solubility of Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC was compatible with the decrease in the absorption intensity of PCDTBT:Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC. Although the efficient fluorescence quenching of PCDTBT in the blend film with Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (Fig. S13(b)†) indicated high efficiency of exciton diffusion to the donor–acceptor interface, the optical microscopy image visualized the existence of micrometer-sized aggregates in PCDTBT:Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (Fig. 6). The film surface roughness of PCDTBT:Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (rms = 0.78 nm) at sites other than the aggregate (Fig. S14, ESI†) was larger than that of PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (rms = 0.59 nm) (Fig. S8, ESI†). These results indicate a poorly developed donor–acceptor bicontinuous network structure. Furthermore, despite the regioisomerically pure structure of Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC, the SCLC electron mobility of PCDTBT:Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (5.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) was not improved relative to that of PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (5.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and was one order magnitude lower than that of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (6.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table 3). In sharp contrast with the BIE-[70]fullerene bis-adducts,38 the regioisomer isolation of Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC from Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC deteriorated the OPV device performance because of decrease in its solubility and higher tendency to form its aggregates.

Conclusion
cis-1 Bis-adduct fullerenes were utilized as electron acceptors in OPV devices for the first time. Propylene-tethered cis-1 bismethano[70]fullerenes (R2-cis-1-[70]PBC) with two methyl, ethyl, phenyl, and thienyl groups were designed rationally and prepared to examine the substitution effect on the film structures and OPV performances of the blend films with an amorphous polymer, PCDTBT. R2-cis-1-[70]PBC with ethyl groups (Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC) showed the highest PCE (4.60%) as a result of good miscibility with PCDTBT. Owing to the elevated LUMO level, VOC of the PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC-based device (0.844 V) was slightly higher than that of the PCDTBT:[70]PCBM-based one (0.831 V). The device performance of PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC was inferior to that of PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (PCE = 5.55%) due to lower electron mobility and charge collection efficiency. Isolation of the α-1-α isomer (Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC) from the corresponding isomer mixture, Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC was also conducted, but PCE of the OPV device decreased (3.25%) despite removing the inhomogeneity of structure and electronic properties of the fullerene bis-adducts. The decreased solubility and enhanced aggregation behavior of Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC relative to Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC resulted in deteriorated OPV performance. These results obtained suggest that the optimization of substituent structure, considering their solubility, aggregation, and electron mobility as well as packing density, are indispensable for taking full advantage of regioisomerically pure cis-1 bis-adducts of [70]fullerene as electron-accepting materials. This model study provides important information for further research to modulate the fundamental properties of [70]fullerene bis-adduct materials, which will play a key role in making advance of OPV devices.

Theoretical calculations
Geometry optimization, electronic structure calculations and molecular volume estimations for the fullerene compounds were performed using density functional theory (DFT) at the RB3LYP/6-31G(d) level. Calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program.52 All structures were fully optimized without any symmetry restriction. Optimized structures of fullerene derivatives in packed systems were calculated under periodic boundary conditions at PM6-D3 based on MOPAC. Degree of packing was calculated by Nv0/V, where N is number of molecules in unit cell, v0 is volume of a molecule, and V is volume of unit cell.46
Device fabrications
OPV devices were prepared on patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates that were cleaned by ultra-sonication in deionized water, CHCl3, acetone, and tetramethylammonium hydroxide aqueous solution for 15 min each, and then deionized water for 25 min, followed by 2-propanol and ethanol for 15 min each. They were subsequently dried under nitrogen flow, and treated in a UV–ozone cleaner for 25 min. A thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated on substrates at 1000 rpm for 60 s, followed by 4000 rpm for 10 s. The PEDOT:PSS layer was dried at 200 °C for 10 min, and then transferred into a glove box filled with dried N2 gas to coat the active layer. A blended solution of PCDTBT and fullerene (total concentration, 28 mg mL−1 for PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC (1:3, w/w) and PCDTBT:Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC (1:3, w/w); 21 mg mL−1 for PCDTBT:Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC (1:2, w/w); 14 mg mL−1 for PCDTBT:Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC (1:1, w/w); 35 mg mL−1 for PCDTBT:[70]PCBM (1:4, w/w) was prepared in ODCB and filtered with a 0.45 μm porous filter. The active layer was spin-coated (at 1500 rpm for 60 s for PCDTBT:Et2-cis-1-[70]PBC, PCDTBT:Et2-α-1-α-[70]PBC, PCDTBT:Th2-cis-1-[70]PBC and PCDTBT:Ph2-cis-1-[70]PBC; at 1000 rpm for 60 s for PCDTBT:[70]PCBM) on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer and then dried at 70 °C for 1 h. For the fabrication of the buffer layer, a solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:fullerene. The samples were dried in a desiccator at r.t. for 20 min, and finally transferred to an evaporation chamber for Al deposition (∼100 nm) before extracting their J–V characteristics under AM1.5 conditions.
The electron-only devices for the SCLC measurements were fabricated as follows. A 50 nm Al film was first thermally deposited onto the glass substrate. The PCDTBT:fullerene blend film with the same ratio as in the PSC device was spin-coated at 800 rpm. Then, the active layer was capped by a 100 nm Al electrode.
Solubility tests
The solubilities of fullerene derivatives were estimated as follows.53 Saturated solutions of the fullerene materials were prepared by adding an excess amount of the fullerenes to ODCB, followed by sonication at room temperature for 1 min. Then, the saturated solutions were filtered through a membrane filter (Cosmonice Filter S, COSMOSIL, pore size: 0.45 μm) to remove the aggregates. The amounts of the fullerene materials dissolved in the filtrates were determined by weighing the solid contents that remained after evaporation of the solvent and thorough drying under vacuum.

for [70]fullerene bis-adducts proposed by Echegoyen, et al. in ref. 16. In this rule, Greek letters such as α, β, γ, and δ define the reacted [6,6]-bonds, and numbers represent the smallest number of bonds separating the addition sites. The same type of bonds on opposite semisphere across the δ-bonds are differentiated using a prime designation. In addition, we also apply the nomenclature of [60]fullerene bis-adducts to [70]fullerene ones; “cis-1” means that two addends exist at [6,6]-bonds in the same hexagon (e.g., α-1-α and α-1-β), and “cis-2” that two addends exist at [6,6]-bonds in the hexagons next to each other (e.g., α-2-α) (Fig. 1b).M.
