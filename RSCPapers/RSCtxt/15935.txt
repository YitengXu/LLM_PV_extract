    , Accepted 18th August 2017First published on 18th August 2017AbstractA strategy that visible-light responsive zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-67 (ZIF-67) encapsulates noble-metal sensitized semiconductors, ZnO@M (M = Au, Pt, and Ag) to fabricate composite catalysts for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is proposed. The obtained ZnO@M@ZIF-67 catalysts have good catalytic performance, particularly, the ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 exhibits quite improved photoconversion efficiency and photocurrent density, superior to most of the reported photoelectrode catalysts. This can be attributed to the wider solar spectra harvesting capability originating from visible-light responsive ZIF-67 and UV-light active ZnO. Simultaneously, their integration enables interfacial electrons in the ZIF-67 shell to easily transfer to the ZnO@Au core, providing good electron–hole separation. In addition, the porous ZIF-67 as a protective shell ensures structural robustness, while maintaining fast ion or gas bubble diffusion through its pores, accounting for stable and excellent PEC performance.
1. Introduction
The depletion of traditional energy resources and increasing environmental pollution from using them have created an urgent demand for renewable and clean power sources.1–3 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting provides an appealing solution for producing clean hydrogen energy, where associated photoelectrodes are crucial.4–6 To achieve high energy-conversion efficiency, the photoanode should enable effective solar-light harvesting and fast electron transport while possessing high durability. Although numerous semiconductor materials have been used as photoanodes (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, and α-Fe2O3) for PEC water splitting,7–9 their performances are still not satisfactory; they are typically plagued with one or more of the following problems: low efficiency for visible-light capture, poor electron–hole separation, catalytically active site blockage, or slow interfacial kinetics. Especially, many semiconductors cannot be activated under visible-light illumination because of their relatively wide band gap. To solve these problems, considerable efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of well-designed nanocomposite structures to optimize PEC performances under visible-light irradiation.10,11 Among these efforts, the integration of noble metals as photosensitizers with semiconductors demonstrates a feasible strategy for enhancing electron mobility and maximizing light utilization.12,13 Nevertheless, the slow interfacial hole transfer on these composites compared with the electron injection rate into the semiconductors always induces electron–hole recombination and/or hole-induced anodic corrosion.14 In addition, the weak interface affinity also enables undesired leaching or aggregation of the photosensitizers, thereby resulting in catalytic inactivity.15 Therefore, it is essential to explore new materials and/or methodologies to construct advanced photoanodes with high energy conversion efficiencies and good stabilities.
To further enhance the PEC performance of noble-metal-sensitized semiconductors, we propose that chemically wrapping visible-light responsive porous materials as protective shells on the surfaces of the semiconductors to fabricate composite structures should be favorable for not only improving solar-light utilization but also ensuring fast interfacial charge transfer and enhancing the stability of the photoanodes.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of newly emerged porous materials that have demonstrated various applications, including acting as surface shells to fabricate composite structures for catalysis, because of their rich structures and diverse functionalities.16,17 Some MOFs themselves have shown excellent performances in photocatalysis due to their periodical arrangements of both light-absorption and catalytic components in single structures.18 For example, Yaghi's group reported plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic CO2 conversion in Ag⊂Ren-UiO-67.18a Wang's group synthesized benzoselenadiazole-doped UiO-68Se as a highly active photocatalyst for aerobic cross-dehydrogenative coupling reactions under visible-light irradiation.18b Gascon's group prepared a Co@NH2-MIL-125(Ti) composite as an efficient and fully recyclable heterogeneous photocatalyst for H2 generation.18c Despite these endeavors, little attention has been given to use MOFs or their composites as photoanodes for PEC water splitting under visible-light irradiation.19
Considering that the rich coordination groups in MOFs can interact with some sensitized semiconductors, which can simultaneously act as acceptors for photogenerated electrons from the MOF,20 the decoration/growth of visible-light responsive MOFs onto these semiconductors to fabricate photoanode catalysts is feasible and favorable for high-performance PEC water splitting. In this regard, the resulting heterostructures would possess the following advantages: (i) the visible-light responsive MOF can provide effective light harvesting, and its porous structure would have little effect on the optical absorption path of the sensitized semiconductor core; (ii) the well-interconnected MOF/semiconductor interface can enable the photoexcited electrons in the MOF shell to easily transfer to the sensitized semiconductor, providing the available channels for accelerating charge transfer; (iii) the porous MOF, as a protective layer, can prevent the leaching or aggregation of the photosensitizer without blocking the diffusion of ions or gases, which enhances the stability of the photoanodes while retaining good PEC properties.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of ZnO arrays
ZnO arrays were prepared by a facile hydrothermal synthetic method.21 Briefly, 100 mL of a C4H6O4Zn·2H2O ethanol solution (6 mM) was first prepared. Then, a thin layer of ZnO seeds was prepared by spin coating the above solution on a pre-treated indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate, which was then annealed at 350 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the substrate was immersed into a 60 mL aqueous solution containing Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (50 mM) and HMT (50 mM), and this was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 90 °C for 6 h to grow ZnO nanorods. Finally, ZnO arrays were obtained and washed thoroughly with distilled water and dried in air.
2.2 Preparation of ZnO@M (M = Au, Ag, and Pt) arrays

2.2.1 Preparation of ZnO@Au arrays. 
Au nanoparticles were prepared according to a previously reported method.22 Briefly, an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (100 mL, 0.01% vol) was refluxed for 15 min under vigorous stirring. Subsequently, a sodium citrate aqueous solution (3 mL, 1% w.t.) was added to the above solution. The solution was heated for 0.5 h, and a deep-red suspension of Au was obtained. After cooling the above solution to room temperature, a PVP aqueous solution (2 mL, 25.5 mg mL−1 in H2O) was added to the as-prepared Au solution under stirring, and the mixture was further stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Finally, a deep-red PVP-stabilized Au solution was obtained. The ZnO@Au arrays were prepared following our previously reported dip-coating method.23 The ITO substrate with the ZnO arrays was immersed into the above prepared Au solution for 5 min, and then, the substrate was taken out of the solution. The resulting ZnO@Au arrays were dried in air for 10 min. The entire process (immersion, withdrawing, and drying) was repeated 3 times. To enable the Au nanoparticles to stick onto the ZnO surface tightly, the obtained ZnO@Au arrays were placed in a sealed container purged with N2 for 15 min, and then, the container was slowly heated to 85 °C (approximately 30 min of ramp time) for 30 min.


2.2.2 Preparation of ZnO@Ag arrays. 
Ag nanoparticles were prepared according to a previously reported method.24 An AgNO3 (30 mL, 20 mM) aqueous solution was refluxed for 20 min under vigorous stirring. Subsequently, a sodium citrate aqueous solution (3 mL, 1% w.t.) was added to the solution. After the solution turned brown, a PVP (13.3 mL, 25 mg mL−1) aqueous solution was added to the solution and stirred for 24 h at room temperature. Finally, the PVP-stabilized Ag solution was obtained. The ZnO@Ag arrays were prepared following a similar method for obtaining the ZnO@Au arrays described above.


2.2.3 Preparation of ZnO@Pt arrays. 
Pt nanoparticles were prepared according to a previously reported method.25 A mixture of PVP (133 mg), methanol (180 mL), and an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O (6.0 mM, 20 mL) was first refluxed at 70 °C for 3 h. After cooling the Pt suspension to room temperature, the solvents were removed by rotary evaporation. Thus, a deep-brown PVP-stabilized Pt solution was obtained. The ZnO@Pt arrays were then prepared following a similar method to that of the ZnO@Au arrays described above.

2.3 Preparation of ZnO@M (M = Au, Ag, and Pt) arrays
An in situ crystallization of ZIF-67 on the surface of the ZnO@M arrays was carried out by the following procedure. For the ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 arrays, 2-methylimidazole (0.1 g) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.01 g) were first dissolved in 16 mL of DMF under stirring. The ITO substrate with the ZnO@Au arrays was immersed into the solution, and the solution was subsequently incubated without any interruption at 70 °C for 1 h. Finally, the resulting ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 arrays were withdrawn and washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol and then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 3 h. The ZnO@Ag@ZIF-67 and ZnO@Pt@ZIF-67 arrays were fabricated following similar procedures using ZnO@Ag and ZnO@Pt as the precursor, respectively. In addition, ZnO@Ag@ZIF-8 as a reference sample was also fabricated following a similar procedure. Briefly, 2-methylimidazole (0.1 g) was dissolved in a mixed solution containing DMF (8 mL) and H2O (8 mL). The ITO substrate with the ZnO@Au arrays was immersed into the solution at 70 °C for 1 h. Finally, the resulting ZnO@Au@ZIF-8 arrays were withdrawn and washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol and then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 3 h.
2.4 Preparation of control samples

2.4.1 Preparation of ZnO@ZIF-67. 
2-Methylimidazole (0.1 g) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.01 g) were dissolved in 16 mL of DMF under stirring. The ITO substrate with the ZnO arrays was immersed into the solution at 70 °C for 1 h. Finally, the ZnO@ZIF-67 arrays were withdrawn and washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol and then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 3 h.


2.4.2 Preparation of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 powdered samples. 
ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 with a similar structure but different in compositions were synthesized according to a previously reported method.17d Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol) and 2-methylimidazole (4 mmol) were each dissolved in 25 mL of methanol. The two solutions were mixed by stirring thoroughly for 2 min and subsequently incubated without stirring at room temperature for 24 h. Then, crystalline ZIF-67 was collected by centrifugation and then washed with methanol 5 times and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. In addition, ZIF-8 was also synthesized by the above procedure using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O as the metal source.


2.4.3 Preparation of Au@ZIF-67 and Au@ZIF-8 powdered samples. 
Typically, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol) and the above obtained Au solution (2 mL) were added into 25 mL of methanol. Meanwhile, 2-methylimidazole (4 mmol) was dissolved in 25 mL of methanol. The two solutions were mixed by stirring and subsequently incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Then, Au@ZIF-67 was collected by centrifugation and then washed with methanol 5 times and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight. In addition, Au@ZIF-8 was also synthesized by the above procedure using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O as the metal source.

2.5 Characterization
Powdered X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were obtained with a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) at 40 kV and 30 mA with a scan step of 0.05° and a scan range from 3 to 70°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALAB 250 instrument (Thermo Electron) with Al Kα radiation. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a Vector 22 (Bruker) spectrophotometer with a resolution of 2 cm−1. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on an F-4600 FL spectrophotometer at room temperature. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FL 900 fluorimeter. Solid-state UV-vis diffuse absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2501PC spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment at room temperature. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K were obtained on a Micromeritics Surface Area Analyzer (ASAP 2020). The morphologies of the samples were investigated by SEM (Zeiss SUPRA 55) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for elemental analyses. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images were recorded with a JEOL JEM-2100 and a JEM-2100F, respectively. The accelerating voltage was 200 kV in each case.
2.6 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
All PEC studies were performed on a Zennium electrochemical workstation using 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 6.8) aqueous solution as the electrolyte medium in a three-electrode cell using a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and a Pt plate as the counter electrode. ZnO, ZnO@M, ZnO@ZIF-67, ZnO@Au@ZIF-8, and ZnO@M@ZIF-67 arrays on the ITO substrate were each used as a photoanode directly with an area of 3 cm2. For comparison, the Au@ZIF-67 and Au@ZIF-8 powder based photoanodes were prepared using a spin-coating method on the ITO substrate glass. The illumination source was a 150 W Xe lamp with an irradiance intensity of 100 mW cm−2 on the photoanode. Amperometric current–time (I–t) curves of the electrodes were recorded under chopped-light irradiation (light on or off cycle: 100 s) at an applied potential of 0.6 V vs. the SCE. Electrochemical impedance measurements (EIS) were performed at 0.6 V vs. the SCE over a frequency range from 105 to 10−2 Hz. Measurements of the photoelectrochemically generated O2 were performed in a homemade airtight transparent electrochemical cell using a three-electrode configuration connected with an electrochemical workstation. Prior to the measurements, the system was thoroughly degassed by purging with high purity argon for 20 min. The amount of produced O2 was determined by injecting the gas in the reactor into a gas chromatograph (GC-2014; Shimadzu) equipped with a semicapillary column and a thermal conductivity detector.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphological characterization of ZnO@Au@ZIF-67
As a proof-of-concept study, in this work, we fabricated well-aligned ZnO@M@ZIF-67 (M = Au, Pt, and Ag) nanoarrays by the direct in situ growth of zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-67 (ZIF-67) onto noble-metal-sensitized ZnO nanorods, which were employed as photoanodes to exhibit good PEC water-splitting performances (Scheme 1). Since ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 showed improved photoconversion efficiency and photocurrent density, its fabrication and characterizations as well as its PEC water-splitting properties were systematically investigated and described herein. The ZnO nanorods were initially prepared according to a previously reported hydrothermal method (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†).26 Subsequently, Au nanoparticles were distributed onto the ZnO nanorods using a reduction method (Fig. S3, ESI†).27 Then, the ZIF-67 nanocrystals were in situ grown on the surface of ZnO@Au. The resulting ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 arrays retained a one-dimensional geometry with a rough surface (Fig. 1a and S4, ESI†). In addition, a TEM image reveals the sandwich structure of this composite (Fig. 1b), in which a ZnO inner core with a diameter of ∼85 nm and a ZIF-67 outer shell with a thickness of ∼18 nm were clearly identified. The HR-TEM image of the ternary edge section provides more compelling evidence for the interface between the ZIF-67 outer shell, Au middle layer, and ZnO inner core (Fig. 1c). Fringes with lattice spacings of ∼0.24 and ∼0.26 nm can be indexed to the (002) plane of the ZnO phase and the (111) plane of the Au phase, respectively (Fig. 1d and e). In addition, the HR-TEM mapping analysis also shows that both Zn and Au were in the interior, while Co was homogeneously distributed throughout the entire array (Fig. 1f).

3.2 Structural characterization of ZnO@Au@ZIF-67
The composition and phase structure of ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 were then confirmed by PXRD and FT-IR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2a, ZnO displays a wurtzite structure. Due to the small loading of Au on ZnO, no obvious diffraction peaks of the Au phase were observed in ZnO@Au. After the growth of ZIF-67, a superimposition of the PXRD patterns of ZnO and ZIF-67 without other new diffraction peaks was observed in the resulting ZnO@Au@ZIF-67. The FT-IR spectra also confirmed the existence of both ZnO and ZIF-67 in the structure. As shown in Fig. S5,† the typical Zn–O vibration at 450 cm−1 could be attributed to the ZnO. For ZIF-67, the imidazole ring stretching vibration at 1350–1500 cm−1 was observed. Owing to the tiny loading of Au nanoparticles, only the existence of vibrational bands of ZnO and ZIF-67 was confirmed in ZnO@Au@ZIF-67. The FT-IR spectra combined with PXRD patterns thus demonstrate the obtained ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 with high purity and good crystallization. Furthermore, ZIF-67 anchored on ZnO@Au imparted ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 with an overall specific surface area of 455 m2 g−1, significantly larger than those of ZnO@Au (32 m2 g−1) and ZnO (36 m2 g−1) (Fig. S6, ESI†).

Furthermore, XPS was applied to provide insight into the heterostructure features of ZnO@Au@ZIF-67. As shown in Fig. 2b, compared to those of pure ZnO, the binding energies of Zn2p in ZnO@Au clearly shift to higher values. Concomitantly, the binding energies of Au4f show a positive shift compared with those of pristine Au (Fig. 2c), agreeing with the reported results on other Au/ZnO composites.28 After the growth of ZIF-67, the Zn2p binding energies in ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 shift back to lower energies, close to those of pure ZnO. This is because the surface of ZnO affords Zn2+ ions when reacting with 2-methylimidazole in promoting the growth of ZIF-67, consistent with the TEM observations (Fig. 1c). Meanwhile, a positive shift of the Au4f-1/2 binding energy in ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 compared with that in ZnO@Au was observed. In addition, shifts of the Co2p binding energies in ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 compared with those in ZIF-67 (Fig. 2d) were also demonstrated. All these results reveal the existence of electronic couplings at the interface among ZnO, Au, and ZIF-67, which would be beneficial for facilitating electron transfer and ensuring the robustness of ZnO@Au@ZIF-67.
After the composition and structural characterizations, the light harvesting capabilities of ZnO, ZnO@Au, and ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 as well as control materials ZnO@ZIF-67 and ZnO@Au@ZIF-8 were assessed by UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Typical absorption features in the UV region and a steep absorption edge at ∼410 nm were observed for ZnO (Fig. 2e and S7, ESI†). Compared with that of ZnO, increasing absorption intensity in the visible region was observed for ZnO@Au, being consistent with previously reported results.12,13 This might be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). After decoration with ZIF-8, the absorption profile of ZnO@Au@ZIF-8 was similar to that of ZnO@Au, illustrating that the UV-light responsive ZIF-8 (Fig. S8, ESI†) has a negligible effect on the light penetration into the ZnO@Au core because of its rich pore structure. In contrast, the ZIF-67 shell afforded strong absorption in the visible-light range (450–700 nm). Thus, ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 has a significantly extended magnitude of light absorption from the UV to visible range, implying its enhanced light-capture capability when acting as a photocatalyst.
On the other hand, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of ZnO@Au compared to bare ZnO displays that Au is helpful to reduce electron–hole recombination (Fig. 2f, inset).20a Additionally, a further decrease in the PL intensity was observed after the growth of ZIF-67 or -8, likely due to photoexcited electron transfer from the organic ligands to the metal ions. Particularly, ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 exhibited a more significant decrease, which indeed suggests that ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 could promote the migration of charge carriers and thus enhance the photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, time-resolved PL spectroscopy was performed to evaluate the dynamics of the photogenerated charge carriers.29 Based on triple-exponential fitting of the emission decay curves (Fig. 2f), the fluorescence lifetimes followed the sequence of ZnO < ZnO@Au < ZnO@Au@ZIF-8 < ZnO@ZIF-67 < ZnO@Au@ZIF-67, which is in contrast to the trend of PL intensities. Thus, ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 has the longest excited state lifetime, which is beneficial for preventing undesired charge–hole combination and promoting water oxidation.
3.3 Evaluation of PEC water splitting performances
The above-obtained nanocomposites were subsequently employed as photoanodes for PEC water splitting under full spectrum illumination. As shown in Fig. 3a, the photocurrent intensity of ZnO was 0.38 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). After the decoration of Au, ZnO@Au gives a higher current intensity of 0.58 mA cm−2, which can be attributed to the improved visible-light absorption offered by the Au SPR effect (Fig. 2e) and enhanced charge transfer afforded by highly conductive Au. For ZnO@Au@ZIF-8, a slightly enhanced current density of 0.69 mA cm−2 with a similar onset potential to that of ZnO@Au was observed, indicating that the porous ZIF-8 shell has a negligible effect on the optical paths for photon flux to the ZnO@Au core. In contrast, ZnO@ZIF-67 presented a significant increase of the current density (1.09 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V), clearly due to the efficient visible-light harvesting (of ZIF-67) and fast charge transfer from ZIF-67 to ZnO@Au. Meanwhile, both Au@ZIF-67 and Au@ZIF-8 powder based photoanodes display weaker photocurrent density in the overall voltage profile due to the blockage of catalytically active sites resulting from the undesired aggregation of the bulk powder (Fig. S9, ESI†). Most importantly, ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 exhibits a cathodic shift of the onset potential from 0.05 to −0.1 V and the highest photocurrent density in the overall voltage profile (1.93 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V). This could be attributed to the highest light harvesting capability originating from visible-light responsive ZIF-67 and UV-light active ZnO (Fig. 2e). Simultaneously, good electron–hole separation is afforded by the integration of the ZIF-67 shell with the ZnO@Au core. As a result, ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 displays superior performance than most of the other reported photoanodes functioning in neutral media (see Table S1, ESI†).

The photoconversion efficiency of each photoanode was then calculated based on the current–voltage curve as a function of applied voltage (Fig. 3b). ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 showed a maximum efficiency of 0.80% at ∼0.15 V, compared with ZnO@ZIF-67 (0.60%), ZnO@Au@ZIF-8 (0.48%), ZnO@Au (0.43%), and ZnO (0.30%). Both the high photocurrent density and photoconversion efficiency of ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 can be mainly attributed to the wider solar spectra harvesting afforded by the visible-light responsive ZIF-67 and Au and the UV-light responsive ZnO. In addition, the high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†) and strong electronic coupling (Fig. 2b–d) at the interface of the three components enabled a prolonged photoexcited electron lifetime, thereby facilitating charge separation, charge transfer, and the surface oxidation reaction.
The enhanced PEC efficiency of ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 was further elucidated using transient photocurrent measurements of the chronoamperometry curves (Fig. 3c) and J–V curves (Fig. 3d) under chopped-light illumination. All these photoanodes exhibited prompt and reproducible photocurrent responses with respect to the on–off cycles of the irradiation. The current densities of the electrodes under illumination follow the trend ZnO < ZnO@Au < ZnO@Au@ZIF-8 < ZnO@ZIF-67 < ZnO@Au@ZIF-67, which is consistent with the J–V curves (Fig. 3a), further illustrating the improvement in PEC performance after the integration of ZIF-67, Au, and ZnO. It was also confirmed that the variation of the electron-transfer resistances (Ret) of the photoanodes under illumination agreed with their PEC behaviors (Fig. 3e). Thus, ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 had the lowest resistance, which enabled enhanced charge injection because of the fast electron transfer from ZIF-67 to ZnO@Au (Fig. 3f, g and S12, ESI†).
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) were also measured to evaluate the PEC performances of these photoanodes. All showed high IPCEs in the UV region (Fig. 3h). The maximum IPCEs at 400 nm were 0.78, 1.49, 1.99, 3.08, and 4.82% for ZnO, ZnO@Au, ZnO@Au@ZIF-8, ZnO@ZIF-67, and ZnO@Au@ZIF-67, respectively. The largely enhanced IPCE of ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 further confirms the contribution of the ZIF-67 decoration to the PEC performance. Clearly, ZIF-67 provides sufficient surface active sites for the catalytic reaction as well as a porous structure for ion diffusion and O2 escape. In addition, an obvious peak in the range of 450–700 nm for both ZnO@ZIF-67 and ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 was observed, indicating that the ZIF-67 shell can harvest visible light to improve the photoconversion efficiency.
In order to further investigate the effect of visible-light responsive ZIF-67 on the PEC performance, the measurements of PEC water splitting for the above photoanodes under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm) were carried out. As expected, all of the photoanodes, especially ZnO@Au@ZIF-67, present a weaker current density under visible-light illumination (as shown in Fig. 4), compared with those under full spectrum illumination (Fig. 3a). This could be explained by the fact that the UV-light active ZnO core in the ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 is incapable of harvesting visible light effectively and only the ZIF-67 shell can absorb visible light under visible-light illumination. However, the photocurrent intensities of ZnO@Au and ZnO@Au@ZIF-8 have a little improvement compared with that of ZnO. In contrast, the decoration of ZIF-67 imparts ZnO@ZIF-67 and ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 with a significant increase of the current density (0.36 mA cm−2 and 0.44 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V), clearly due to the efficient visible-light harvesting. Correspondingly, ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 and ZnO@ZIF-67 show a higher photoconversion efficiency of 0.122 and 0.074% at ∼0.15 V, respectively, compared with those of ZnO@Au@ZIF-8 (0.031%), ZnO@Au (0.027%), and ZnO (0.025%) (Fig. 4b). Similarly, the visible-light induced enhancement of the PEC efficiency of ZnO@ZIF-67 and ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 was further elucidated by the J–V curves under chopped visible-light illumination (Fig. 4c) and Ret measurements (Fig. 4d). The results are consistent with the J–V curves (Fig. 4a), further confirming that the superior visible-light responsive performance of the present system is due to the efficient visible-light harvesting and fast charge transfer from ZIF-67 to ZnO@Au.

In addition, both the O2-evolution rate and photocurrent were monitored simultaneously to evaluate the efficiencies and stabilities of PEC water splitting on these photoanodes under full spectrum illumination. ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 showed the highest average O2-evolution rate, which was 1.8, 2.7, 3.6, and 4.9 times larger than those of ZnO@ZIF-67, ZnO@Au@ZIF-8, ZnO@Au, and ZnO, respectively (Fig. 5). The high photocurrent-to-oxygen conversion efficiency of ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 indicates its high efficiency for water splitting. Comparing the theoretical O2-evolution rates calculated from the photocurrents with the actual O2-evolution rates, the calculated average faradaic efficiencies based on the recycling experiments on ZnO, ZnO@Au, ZnO@Au@ZIF-8, ZnO@ZIF-67, and ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 were 88, 76, 97, 96, and 98%, respectively. Furthermore, ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 nearly retained its original O2-evolution rate and current density (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†) over 5 cycles. In addition, PXRD patterns and SEM images confirmed its structural integrity and crystallinity after the cycle measurements (Fig. S15, ESI†). However, the structural integrity and crystallinity of ZnO@Au clearly decreased over subsequent runs (Fig. S16 and S17, ESI†). Thus, these results demonstrate the excellent stability of ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 in PEC water splitting.

This visible-light responsive MOF encapsulation strategy can be readily extended to the fabrication of other noble-metal-sensitized semiconductor catalysts, such as ZnO@Pt@ZIF-67 and ZnO@Ag@ZIF-67. It was confirmed that they displayed higher photocurrent densities of 1.25 and 1.35 mA cm−2 with smaller onset potentials compared with those of ZnO@Pt and ZnO@Ag (Fig. 6a, S18 and S19, ESI†). Meanwhile, after several cycle tests, only slight variations of the photocurrent densities were observed for the two photoanodes (Fig. 6b, S20 and S21, ESI†), further demonstrating that porous ZIF-67 as a protective shell on ZnO@M can prevent anodic corrosion, contributing to stable PEC performance. Thus, these results illustrate a feasible method to fabricate composite catalysts for high-performance PEC water splitting.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a new strategy to make photoelectrode catalysts for PEC water splitting. With this strategy, a series of ZnO@M@ZIF-67 (M = Au, Pt, and Ag) composites were fabricated, and they showed good catalytic performances and stabilities. Particularly, ZnO@Au@ZIF-67 demonstrated remarkable photocurrent density and photoconversion efficiency, superior to most of the previously reported photoanodes. This outstanding performance can be attributed to the effective light harvesting and rich porosity of the visible-light responsive ZIF-67 as well as its strong interface affinity with ZnO@Au. In addition, the encapsulation of ZnO@M within the MOF shell also imparts structural integrity and high durability. Therefore, this strategy can be extended to the fabrication of other types of composite catalysts for a wide range of energy storage and conversion applications.
