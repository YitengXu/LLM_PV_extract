    , Accepted 18th August 2019First published on 20th August 2019AbstractThe ability of solution-processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on new small-molecule semiconductors, 1DTP-ID and 2DTP-ID, for indoor dim-light energy harvesting is reported. Indoor OPVs with the best performance achieve high power conversion efficiencies, over 20%, under white LED illumination at 200–2000 lx. Flexible OPV modules using 1DTP-ID with an active area of ∼10 cm2 are capable of delivering a maximum power output of ∼0.1 mW and an open-circuit voltage of ∼4 V even at 200 lx, ideal for use as dispersive self-sustainable power sources for the Internet of Things.
Introduction
With the emergence of low-power electronic devices such as wireless sensor nodes, the Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly developing and spreading. The IoT is a system where a variety of physical objects (“things”) are connected to the Internet and are able to communicate with each other and monitor their internal states or external environments.1 While the IoT has significant potential to benefit our lives, commerce, and industry, the use of a large number of wireless or portable devices would need to be powered by distributed energy sources at the lowest possible cost, especially in regions that are limited to the range of a few milliwatts.2 However, conventional batteries, such as coin cells, require periodic replacement and maintenance, thus spurring the demand for emerging energy-harvesting systems that utilize ambient energy to semipermanently operate indoor electronic devices (Fig. 1).

Thus far, various methodologies have been proposed for harvesting energy from local environments, including light, heat, movement/vibration, and electromagnetic waves.3 Of these technologies, photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion has shown great potential because of its higher energy density and output voltages. Thus, recent developments of PV devices not only target conventional solar cells under 1-sun illumination (i.e., 100 mW cm−2) but also dim-light indoor applications (with a factor of 100–1000 times lower incident power).4–8 As sunlight is not available always and at all locations, artificial indoor lighting sources, such as white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and fluorescence lamps, can steadily supply small amounts of energy for powering sensors and electronic components inside buildings. Unlike the AM 1.5G solar spectrum, typical indoor illumination spectra are limited to the visible wavelength region, as they are optimized for the human eye. Here, eco-friendly organic photovoltaics (OPVs)9,10 serve as a promising indoor energy-harvesting technology, which offers various inherent advantages such as light weight, mechanical flexibility, solution processability, and cost-effective large-area manufacturing capability. Additionally, the characteristics of OPV materials such as a high absorption coefficient and a tunable absorption range are well suited for indoor applications when compared to robust inorganic silicon devices. Recently, some research groups, including us, have investigated whether OPVs can demonstrate indoor performance superior to silicon solar cells, and the results revealed that OPVs indeed show higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) under white LED lighting conditions.4,5c,h,8 It is necessary to further optimize OPV materials and devices, and thereby improve their PCEs for future practical indoor applications. Nevertheless, thus far, only a few OPV materials including representative semiconducting polymers (e.g., P3HT,5a,b,d,g,i PTB7,5c,d,f,g and PCDTBT5d,e,k) and low-bandgap small molecules5j,l,8 have been tested for their potential in terms of organic energy-harvesting devices; thus, a systematic study on the indoor PV characteristics and mechanism is still lacking.
In this work, we propose new small-molecule light absorbers, 1DTP-ID and 2DTP-ID (Fig. 2), and evaluate their OPV performances using a binary bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) system with a fullerene acceptor (PNP)11 under LED illumination with different illuminances (200–10000 lx) and color temperatures (2900–7500 K). The 1DTP-ID-based OPVs, tailored for indoor applications, demonstrated notably high power outputs of 11.3 µW cm−2 (corresponding to a PCE = 19.5%) at 200 lx (typical of living room environments) and 64.7 µW cm−2 (PCE = 22.4%) at 1000 lx (office environments). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the power output obtained with the 1DTP-ID-based flexible energy-harvesting modules of ∼10 cm2 can reach almost 100 µW with a large open-circuit voltage (Voc) of over 4 V even under dimly lit conditions of 200 lx. Our achievement paves the way for practical indoor applications of solution-processed OPVs.

Results and discussion
Compared with conventional solar illumination, OPVs used for indoor energy harvesters generally suffer from a significant Voc reduction (ΔV) under weak room lighting conditions5,8 (will be discussed later). Thus, OPVs with higher Voc values are advantageous for energy-harvesting devices, and thus, designing appropriate light-absorbing donor molecules is imperative. Taking this prerequisite into account, we selected dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyridin-5(4H)-one (DTP) as the functional molecular core and designed two small-molecule donors, namely, 1DTP-ID and 2DTP-ID (Fig. 2). In our molecular design, to obtain a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (EHOMO) without prejudice to the backbone π-electron delocalization, one or two DTP cores bearing electron-withdrawing fused lactam subunit(s) are linked to the terminal 1,3-indandione (ID) units through the bridging hexyl-substituted 2,2′-bithiophene moieties. Although some DTP-based semiconducting polymers have been reported in the past for efficient OPVs,12 DTP-based small-molecule donors have never been explored. The detailed synthetic procedures for 1DTP-ID and 2DTP-ID as well as their characterization data are given in the ESI.† These new materials were highly soluble in chloroform and purified by recycling preparative gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to obtain pure materials.
As depicted in Fig. 3a, similar absorption spectra with peaks (λmax) at around 540 nm were obtained for 1DTP-ID and 2DTP-ID in dilute solutions. In spin-coated thin films, their absorption spectra were considerably red-shifted (λmax = 616 nm for 1DTP-ID and 610 nm for 2DTP-ID) and broadened with the appearance of pronounced shoulder peaks in the longer wavelength region. This observation is suggestive of the formation of intermolecular π-stacked aggregates in the solid state. Consequently, the optical bandgaps (Eg) of 1DTP-ID and 2DTP-ID were estimated to be as low as 1.65 and 1.70 eV, respectively, from the thin-film absorption edges. The high photoabsorptivity of both materials covering the wavelength range of 400–750 nm with high extinction coefficients (α) is beneficial for harvesting the overall indoor LED spectral irradiance (see below). The ionization potentials (or EHOMO) of 1DTP-ID and 2DTP-ID were then measured using photoelectron yield spectroscopy (Fig. 3b). 2DTP-ID comprising dimeric DTPs had a slightly lower (energetically stabilized) EHOMO of −5.35 eV, compared with that of monomeric 1DTP-ID (−5.25 eV). It is well known that the Voc of BHJ OPVs strongly depends on the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor. Therefore, it is expected that these new DTP-based donors with low-lying EHOMO can generate a high Voc in BHJ OPVs even under weak indoor lighting conditions.

To evaluate the energy-harvesting capability, we fabricated solution-processed indoor OPVs with an inverted device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/Al-doped ZnO (AZO; ca. 30 nm)/active layer (ca. 150–190 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm)13 (ESI†). For all devices, each BHJ active layer, which consists of a binary blend of 1DTP-ID or 2DTP-ID as the donor and PNP as the acceptor, was prepared by spin-coating of their chloroform solutions with 1,8-diiodooctane (3 vol%) as a solvent additive. We first optimized the donor:acceptor (D/A) blend ratios and active layer thicknesses of the devices (ESI†). The best indoor PV performances (i.e., highest PCEs) were attained with D/A ratios of 1.5:1 (w/w) for 1DTP-ID:PNP and 1:1 for 2DTP-ID:PNP blends, together with a thickness of around 150–190 nm, under white LED lighting conditions. It is also noted that the optimal active layer thickness for these high-performing indoor OPVs is almost twice as that of the corresponding outdoor OPVs.

Fig. 4a and b compare the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized OPV devices measured under cool-white LED illumination at an illuminance of 200 lx and standard 1-sun illumination. The key indoor PV parameters are compiled in Table 1. Under 1-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), both the 1DTP-ID- and 2DTP-ID-based devices exhibited comparably low PCEs of 2.5% and 2.9%, respectively (Fig. 4b), stemming mainly from their low fill factors (FF = 34% for both). Intriguingly, the J–V characteristics were found to drastically change under 200 lx LED illumination (70.1 µW cm−2). Indeed, the 1DTP-ID- and 2DTP-ID-based devices could yield 12.4 and 9.6 µW cm−2, delivering remarkable PCEs of 17.7% and 13.8%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4a and Table 1. It is apparent that a large increase of the FF is a primary factor for this PCE enhancement in spite of a certain Voc reduction at low light intensity. To obtain a high FF under indoor conditions, the increased shunt resistance (Rp) and the decreased saturation current of the device are critical as the photocurrent becomes lower by more than two orders of magnitude. For the 1DTP-ID- and 2DTP-ID-based devices, the Rp values extracted from the J–V curves were 580 and 385 kΩ cm2, respectively, which are high enough to effectively suppress the leakage current. In contrast, under the 1-sun condition, the PV performance is highly dependent on the series resistance (Rs) rather than Rp. The importance of a higher Rp for indoor OPVs has been suggested in the literature.5a,8,14

Another possible reason for the PCE enhancement is the mutual matching between the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (or photoabsorption response) of the present indoor OPVs (Fig. 4c) and white LED illumination spectra (Fig. 4d). Unlike the solar spectrum extending over a very broad range from ultraviolet to infrared, the artificial white LED spectra that comprise a sharp blue emission from gallium nitride (GaN) LEDs and broad longer-wavelength emissions from phosphors are limited only to a relatively narrower visible region. This enables OPVs to perform much more efficiently under indoor lighting conditions. To verify this behavior, we further evaluated the indoor performances of the same OPV devices by varying color temperatures of the incident LED light (Table 1 and the ESI†). Notably, both 1DTP-ID- and 2DTP-ID-based devices showed superior PV performances under warm white LED light with a lower color temperature of 2900 K, leading to improved PCEs of 19.3% and 17.8%, respectively. This is because 1DTP-ID and 2DTP-ID tend to effectively harvest photons of the longer visible wavelength (>500 nm) and thus, their optical responses are better matched with the warm white LED spectrum (Fig. 4c and d).
As shown in Fig. 5, we further investigated the variations of the PV parameters as a function of the incident LED light intensity (Pin) by changing its illuminance in the range of 200–10000 lx. The Jsc values of both devices appeared to be nearly proportional to Pin (Fig. 5a), as can be expressed by Jsc ∝ Pinα (α ≈ 1).15 The linear dependence of Jsc on Pin suggests that bimolecular charge recombination is well suppressed in the devices under short-circuit conditions. Meanwhile, upon reducing the illuminance from 10000 to 200 lx (corresponding to Pin = 2895 to 57.9 µW cm−2), the Voc values of these devices underwent a quasi-linear decrease with the logarithm of Pin.8 As can be seen from Fig. 5b, the 1DTP-ID-based device showed lower Voc values over the whole illuminance range, whereas the slope of its semilog Voc–Pin curve was evidently smaller than that of the 2DTP-ID-based one. Accordingly, the Voc reduction observed for the 1DTP-ID-based device (ΔV = 0.14–0.15 V) under the indoor conditions (200 lx) with respect to the outdoor 1-sun condition was smaller than that for the 2DTP-ID-based device (ΔV = 0.21–0.23 V). In contrast to the behavior of Voc, the FFs of these devices increased gradually with the reduction of Pin due to their large Rp and were maintained at high values exceeding 60% in a low Pin region (Fig. 5c). As a consequence, under very weak LED lighting at 200 lx, the 1DTP-ID- and 2DTP-ID-based devices achieved remarkable PCEs of 19.3% and 17.8%, generating output power densities (Pout) as high as 11.2 and 10.3 µW cm−2, respectively (Fig. 5d). Illuminance in general indoor environments can vary in the range of 200–1000 lx, depending on the function of the space. It is worth noting that the 1DTP-ID-based device retained excellent PV performance in this practical illuminance range, with PCEs exceeding 20%.

As a proof of concept toward practical applications, we fabricated and tested OPV energy-harvesting mini modules based on the outstanding 1DTP-ID:PNP system onto flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, with a total active area of 9.6 cm2 by connecting six sub-cells of ∼1.6 cm2 in series (Fig. 6a and b). The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for the mini modules measured at an illuminance of 200 lx are presented in Fig. 6c. The Voc of the mini modules scaled ideally with the number of series-connected cells, demonstrating a practical high Voc of 4.05 V at 200 lx. The average value of Voc for each sub-cell is thus estimated to be 0.67 V, fully consistent with the Voc value of the foregoing single test cells. Given the expected short-circuit current (Isc ≈ 39 µA), the present flexible mini modules showed a reasonably high Isc of 35.1 µA with a small current loss. It is worth noting that the upscaling from 6 mm2 (for the small-area test cells) to 9.6 cm2 (for the practical modules) without FF variation led to a high steady power output of 95.4 µW with a PCE of ∼17% even under dimly lit conditions of 200 lx. This remarkable indoor PV performance would be sufficient for state-of-the-art IoT applications under weak indoor LED lighting.

Conclusions
This study demonstrated that small-molecule OPV systems can achieve high PCEs in low-light environments and function as high-performance ambient energy harvesters. The optimized energy-harvesting devices employing new 1DTP-ID achieved high PCEs of up to ∼20% under white LED illumination at 200 lx. Further, we successfully produced flexible and bendable OPV energy-harvesting mini modules integrating six series-connected sub-cells. Our mini modules with an active area of ∼10 cm2 could generate a high Pout of ∼100 µW and a high value of Voc of over 4 V under LED illumination of 200 lx. The unique properties of OPVs can increase the freedom of design, colors, and shapes of the devices and also ensure ease of integration, making such a fascinating organic energy-harvesting technology ideal for future indoor IoT applications.16
