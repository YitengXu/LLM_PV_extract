    , Accepted 29th December 2018First published on 31st December 2018AbstractPrintable organic field effect transistors (OFETs) have been investigated for more than 20 years, aiming at various emerging applications including flexible/wearable electronics, displays and sensors. Since many comprehensive review articles for this field have been published, here we will focus on the recent progress of this field and address the following issues critical to the future applications of OFETs. First, downscaling technologies for the printing of OFETs with fine resolution will be reviewed. The approaches for short channels and small overlapping as well as patterning of organic semiconductors are summarized. Second, various approaches for realizing low-voltage OFETs will be presented, which are critical to the power consumption of organic devices. Specifically, the operational voltages of OFETs have been successfully decreased to several volts by increasing the gate dielectric capacitance and reducing the sub-gap density of states at the channel. This review will provide guidelines for material design and fabrication processes of OFETs with high performance and advanced applications.

1. Introduction
Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), utilizing organic semiconductor and dielectric layers, show several competitive advantages over their inorganic counterparts, such as low temperature and low cost processing, excellent mechanical flexibility, and great potential for performance improvement and functionalization via molecular structure tailoring.1 Therefore, OFETs have attracted wide research attention and commercial interest in many applications, such as flexible or conformal electronics on non-flat surfaces and low cost item-level electronic devices for the internet of things.2–4
In the last decades, high-mobility organic semiconductors (OSCs) used in OFETs have been intensively investigated.5 There are several review papers addressing the material design and processing methods for high-mobility OSCs.6,7 Hole mobilities higher than 20 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been achieved in several p-type organic small molecule and polymer semiconductors,8,9 and for n-type OSCs, the highest reported electron mobility also exceeds 10 cm2 V−1 s−1.10 However, the reported high-mobility materials or OFETs have not been successfully utilized in practical circuits and systems with expected performance. Recent studies showed that mobility overestimation could happen in many reported high-mobility OFETs mainly due to non-ideal device performace.11,12 More importantly, it is rather difficult to integrate high-mobility organic semiconductors into a manufactural device stack that could meet the circuit and system design requirements.
For the fabrication of OFETs, the most desirable manufacturing approach should be solution-based printing processes with low cost, high feasibility of customization, and little differentiation from the current mature printing technologies.13,14 However, due to material and process limitations, it is challenging to realize all printing fabrication of the backplanes for high resolution displays or sensor arrays, which have high requirements of the refresh rate, the integration density, and reliability.15,16 On the other hand, it is necessary to develop OFET fabrication techniques compatible with existing manufacturing processes to minimize barriers for mass production.17 Lots of research has been carried out on improving printing based processes for finer resolution OFETs.18
For device applications, thanks to their inherent amplification, biocompatibility, and ease of miniaturization/integration, such “manufacturing-on-demand” OFETs would be promising to construct transducers and simple signal processing circuitry for various sensing applications, such as pressure, gas, bio-potential, ion and various bio-chemical sensors.19–24 For these sensors, low-voltage operated OFETs with steep subthreshold swing are required to meet the system power constraints and avoid the generation of interference signals at large voltage bias.25 Steeper subthreshold swing can also help to achieve larger transconductance efficiency for higher sensitivity.26
With the motivation of developing fully printed OFETs for sensors and related signal processing circuitry, this paper will provide a review on research progress in two parts, including printing processes for fine resolution OFETs and approaches for realizing low-voltage OFETs. In the first part, the requirements for fine resolution of OFETs will be discussed, and then the printing processes to achieve short channels and narrow line width will be reviewed, followed by a summary of the techniques for realizing self-aligned gate structure to minimize the parasitic capacitance. Patterning the OSC layer is another important topic to be covered in this part. The second part will summarize the approaches for realizing low-voltage OFETs. Finally, the conclusion and outlook will be addressed.
2. Processes for fine resolution OFETs
2.1 Requirements for fine resolution OFETs
For most transistor applications, improving the device operation speed is pursued. In sensor applications, high speed OFETs can help to achieve transducers with fast responses to sensed signals. To fabricate a fully integrated sensor system with OFETs, integration of subsequent signal processing and antenna driving functions requires even higher operation speed.27,28 The maximum operation speed of a field effect transistor is characterized by the cut-off frequency (fT) as expressed by the following equation:29 (1)where μeff is the effective charge-carrier mobility, VGS is the gate-to-source voltage, Vth is the threshold voltage, and Lch and Loverlap are the channel length and gate to source/drain overlap length, respectively (Fig. 1). Therefore, to realize high speed OFETs, in addition to high mobility channels, the process resolution needs to be improved for smaller Lch and Loverlap, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Reduction of Lch and Loverlap also helps to decrease the gate leakage current, which is important to achieve large input impedance and lower the detection limit for weak signal sensing. Meanwhile, OFETs of finer feature sizes will enable integration of multi-sensors or sensor arrays into a smaller area for high throughput multi-parametric sensing with less consumption of the test solution.30 For ease of processing, normally in these OFETs, the source/drain electrodes are fully covered by the gate electrode area, and thus Loverlap is equal to the line width of the formed source/drain electrodes (LSD).
 Fig. 1  Illustration of the channel length (Lch), the gate to source/drain overlap length (Loverlap) and the line width of the source/drain electrodes (LSD) in two popularly used printable OFET structures: (a) bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC), and (b) top-gate bottom-contact (TGBC). 

Table 1 summarizes the feature sizes and basic device performance of the reported fully printed or solution-processed OFETs over the last decade.31–54LSD and Lch of most devices are larger than 20 μm using a normal inkjet printer with a 10 picoliter printer head. To reduce Lch and Loverlap, many research efforts have been devoted to designing new printing processes for improving registration accuracy (for smaller Lch) and printing resolution (for smaller LSD, and in turn smaller Loverlap). However, only a few of these techniques have been demonstrated with all printed or solution processed OFETs.41,43,52 For complex circuit and array integration of OFETs, fine patterning of the OSC layer with simple printing or solution based approaches is also key to eliminate possible leakage current paths out of the gate control, and suppress crosstalk among different OFETs. Based on these considerations, this review will cover the work on processes for short channels and narrow line width, self-aligned gate structure and patterning of the OSC layer.

2.2 Processes for short channels and narrow line width
To fabricate short channels and narrow line widths, several approaches based on gravure, flexography, reverse-offset and nanoimprint lithography were developed, and both LSD and Lch less than 10 μm were achieved.55–58 These approaches need pre-patterned fine micro-structures on imprinting rollers or plates, and would be more suitable for very large scale manufacturing.
For low cost digital manufacturing, drop-on-demand inkjet printing is a preferred choice with a short design-to-product time and great material savings. However, the complicated dynamics during ink droplet generation from the print head, and jetted droplets impacting the substrate surface make it difficult to achieve fine resolution patterns with narrow line width and short channels with normal printers.59 With a widely used 10 picoliter print head, the achievable line width and gap distance of electrodes is normally larger than 20 μm as shown in Table 1. Super inkjet printing using a femtoliter printer head with high registration accuracy was developed to fabricate OFETs with both LSD and Lch down to 1 μm.60 However, continuous generation and accurate control of such tiny ink droplets in high throughput manufacturing is very challenging. Therefore, several techniques for forming short channels and narrow line width using common inkjet printers have been developed, and can be classified into the following three types.

(1) Wetting constrained printing. 
As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), the wetting properties of an ink drop on the targeted substrate surface decide its spreading width, and in turn the formed line width. When two lines of ink drops are printed closely to form short channels, shorting between two lines might occur due to the presence of bulging, which is also affected by the wetting properties. Therefore, through optimization of the ink to substrate wetting properties, both LSD and Lch are able to be reduced. Subramanian et al. proposed a fluid guiding technique to control the ink wetting behaviour and allow one to form bulge-free source/drain electrode pairs close to each other without shorting.31 In their studies, as shown in Fig. 2(b), two guiding drops were firstly placed at the beginning of the source and drain lines, off-axis and away from the channel. The contact of the early formed bulge would guide the successively printed drops away from the channel, where small spacing (18 μm) was achieved without shorting. In the work by Tang et al. (Fig. 2(c)), the wetting of Ag ink drops on the dielectric surface was reduced through modulating the surface energy of a poly(vinyl alcohol) gate dielectric with fluoroalkylsilanes (FOTS), resulting in the reduction of the formed electrode line width and channel length from 70 μm and 20 μm to 35 μm and 15 μm, respectively.61,62 The method was implemented to fabricate BGBC structure OFETs using a blend of TIPS-pentacene and PS as the channel layer. With a similar way of optimizating the wetting properties, it was further shown by Tokito et al. that formation of short channel lengths less than 10 μm using a normal inkjet printer was able to be achieved.63–65 Recently, Chu et al. reported on an interesting approach to obtain short channels by printing a special Ag ink on an SU-8 interlayer (Fig. 2(d)).52 The SU8 interlayer was partially dissolved by the solvent used in the Ag ink. Redistribution of the interlayer during the drying process formed ridges along the printed Ag line edges, which limited the ink spread, and separated neighbouring printed lines. Short channels as small as 3 μm were thus able to be achieved for fabrication of OFETs.

(2) Self-aligned printing. 
To form even smaller channel lengths down to the sub-micrometer scale, Sirringhaus et al. developed a self-aligned printing technique. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), the surface of the first PEDOT:PSS electrode was modified to be more hydrophobic by CF4 plasma treatment and thus repulsive to the successively deposited inks.66 Printing of the other electrode along the edge of the first electrode was able to obtain sub-micrometer channels. In their subsequent work, as shown in Fig. 3(b), they used hydrophobic 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorol-decanethiol (PFDT) self-assembled monolayers for modifying the printed gold electrode instead of CF4 plasma for PEDOT:PSS, resulting in fabrication of sub-micrometer channel lengths with high yield.67,68 The method was used to fabricate both p-type and n-type TGBC OFETs of 0.2 μm channel length. With both n-type and p-type OFETs, a complementary inverter was able to be fabricated.69 Instead of using surface treatment, self-aligned printing was also achieved by engineering the Ag ink formation with an organoamine as a stabilizer for silver nanoparticles, which helped direct formation of a hydrophobic boundary around the printed Ag electrodes to repel the subsequently printed ink droplets (Fig. 3(c)).70 Reproducible short channels of about 10 μm with narrow channel length were obtained with this approach.

(3) Hybrid printing. 
To achieve short channels and narrow line width, combining inkjet printing with other processes was developed. As illustrated in Fig. 4(a), Tseng et al. used a micron-scale mechanically controlled tungsten probe to drag through the printed Ag pad, and were able to create a channel length less than 5 μm.71 Bucella et al. used femtosecond laser ablation to divide inkjet printed Ag lines into pairs of source/drain electrodes (Fig. 4(b)).72 Sub-micrometer channels were able to be produced with this approach, and used to fabricate both p- and n-type OFETs. Caironi et al. used femtosecond laser sintering on spin coated Ag ink film followed by water washing to achieve both narrow source/drain electrodes (3.5 μm) and micron-scale (1.75 μm) channel length, as depicted in Fig. 4(c).73 Suzuki et al. simultaneously realized narrow electrodes (15 μm) and short channels (2 μm) on a polyimide substrate by patterning its surface energy with UV irradiation through a high resolution photo mask, as shown in Fig. 4(d).74 The surface wetting difference enabled the inkjet printed droplets to move into the more wetting regions to form the fine electrode patterns.

2.3 Self-aligned gate structure
The above techniques showed capabilities of achieving small Lch with commonly used inkjet printers, but reduction of LSD was much less due to spread of the ink droplets on the substrate surface. For most reported printed or solution processed OFETs, the source/drain electrodes were fully covered by the gate area. As a result, Loverlap, equal to LSD, cannot be scaled the same as Lch. In short channel OFETs, the parasitic capacitance induced by such large Loverlap begins to play an important role in determining the operation speed of the device. Therefore, formation of the self-aligned gate structure as depicted in Fig. 5(a) with printing processes would be desired. In such a structure, Loverlap can be minimized without relying on LSD.

Noh et al. developed a method for fabrication of the self-aligned gate in the TGBC structure, as illustrated in Fig. 5(b).67 The source/drain electrodes with sub-micrometer channel lengths were fabricated using the self-aligned printing approach as described above. The thick photoresist on top of the OSC layer and the cross-linked PMMA gate dielectric layer were selectively exposed to UV irradiation through the back of the substrate. After development, a trench structure was able to be formed with good alignment to the edges of the source and drain electrodes. After printing the gate electrode, a self-aligned gate structure was obtained, yielding a low parasitic overlap capacitance and a high transition frequency of 1.6 MHz.
In the work by Arai et al., a self-aligned gate structure was realized for BGBC OFETs.75 A photo-sensitive SAM layer was deposited on the gate dielectric layer to produce a hydrophobic surface, and was then selectively decomposed by UV exposure (>350 nm) through the back substrate using the gate electrode as the mask. The exposed surface areas became hydrophilic after tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) rinsing, and enabled the printed PEDOT:PSS source/drain electrode to align well with the bottom gate electrode. Bonfiglio et al. used the bottom gate as the mask to pattern a photoresist film deposited on top of the gate with UV radiation through the back side of a thin parylene-C film, as shown in Fig. 5(c).76 After developing, only the part of the photoresist in the gate electrode area remained, which was then used to form the source/drain electrodes aligning to the gate with a lift-off process. With small parasitic capacitance, the fabricated BGBC OFET achieved a cut-off frequency of 100 kHz, which was improved by 3 orders of magnitude compared to that of a non-self-aligned gate structure device. These approaches based on UV irradiation through the back side of the substrate place strict requirements of the light source and the substrate. Subramanian et al. proposed a simpler method to fabricate self-aligned gate structure BGBC OFETs by forming a mesa structure with the bottom gate electrode and the PVP gate dielectric layer, as depicted in Fig. 5(d).77 With this method, OFETs with 50 μm channel length and a small overlap capacitance (0.14–0.23 pF mm−1) were obtained.
2.4 Patterning of the organic semiconductor layer
Fine patterning of the organic semiconductor layer can eliminate possible leakage current paths out of the gate control for fabricating high performance OFETs, and is also key to suppress crosstalk among different devices for circuit integration. Inkjet printing is the most straightforward approach to form patterned OSC layers for printed OFETs. Extensive research has thus been carried out on inkjet printing of OSC material for fabrication of OFET devices and circuits.42,51,78–81 However, inkjet printing has very strict requirements on the ink properties.13 Manipulation of the tiny ink droplets and control of the crystallization and surface morphology is also quite challenging.82 This review will not cover the details of optimizing the ink formulation, and process parameters for inkjet printing of OSC material. In the following, some other patterning techniques will be reviewed.

(1) Dry-etching. 
Dry etching with a photolithographic patterned photoresist mask is a preferred choice to achieve patterned structures of fine resolution and process accuracy for OFETs. However, during the processes, the used photoresist solvent, UV irradiation and plasma might cause damage to the OSC layer, which in turn degrades the device performance. To circumvent this chemical or physical damage, Chang et al. used a perfluorinated polymer CYTOP as the protective layer, and achieved patterned OSC islands of micrometer scale sizes for various materials (e.g. PBTTT, P3HT, PQT, and F8T2) and different device structures (BGBC and TGBC) (Fig. 6(a)).83 With the patterned OSC layer, it was shown that the ON/OFF ratio was considerably enhanced by 2–3 orders of magnitude compared to the unpatterned devices. Based on a similar dry-etching approach, Tang et al. found that removing the protective CYTOP layer might cause deteriorated performance with poorer subthreshold behaviour and decreased mobility.84 By keeping the protective layer as a part of the gate dielectric layer instead of removing it, the device performance was improved (Fig. 6(b)).

To reduce the process steps with dry etching, Kim et al. proposed a facile route to achieve direct patterning of the OSC layer by using highly energetic photons to trigger the photo-conversion of organic materials.85 As illustrated in Fig. 7(a), when the OSC layer was selectively exposed to deep-ultraviolet (DUV) irradiation with a photomask, the dissociation of chemical bonds and the loss of inter-molecular ordering caused the area to be highly resistive. It was shown that the fabricated OFETs showed negligible mobility degradation but improvement of the ON/OFF current ratio. A laser ablation based approach was also tried for directly patterning the OSC layer without the need for pre-fabricated photomasks.86 This method would significantly reduce the process steps, but one needs to choose suitable laser sources and carefully optimize the process parameters for good ablation selectivity (Fig. 7(b)).

(3) Transfer printing. 
As shown in Fig. 8(a), Ikawa et al. used a PDMS stamp to transfer pre-deposited OSC films from one substrate to a moulded glass plate with the required pattern, which was then transferred to the targeted substrate to obtain patterned OSC islands.87 The mechanism of such a transfer printing based approach is similar to conventional printing techniques such as gravure, offset, flexographic, etc. These techniques have also been upgraded for printing OSC materials with pre-made moulds to achieve patterned structures to enable high throughput roll-to-roll printing processes.14 Nguyen et al. adopted another transfer printing method to pattern a TES-ADT OSC layer by using a pre-fabricated PDMS mould containing 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) to dissolve the undesired parts (Fig. 8(b)).88 Fine resolution below 1 μm was able to be obtained with this approach.

(4) Surface energy patterning. 
The organization of the OSC solution on the substrate surface is affected by the local surface energy. By creating a large enough surface energy difference among different areas, it would be possible to form patterned OSC regions automatically during the deposition process. Li et al. demonstrated a method for such surface energy patterning through selective treatment of a hydrophobic dielectric (CYTOP) surface to be hydrophilic in the channel area by O2 plasma using a shadow mask (Fig. 9(a)).89,90 In the work of Tang et al., self-assembled monolayers (FOTS) were used to modify the surface of hydroxyl-rich PVA to be more hydrophobic, followed by selectively removing FOTS in the channel region via UV ozone (Fig. 9(b)).62 For both cases, well patterned OSC islands were obtained. However, for these techniques, the resolution still depends on the used masks.

(5) Patterning by banks. 
Another method for controlling the OSC solution flow on the substrate surface is through bank structures.64,91 Fukuda et al. used a dispensing process to make a 200 nm-thick fluoropolymer (Teflon) bank structure, and the OSC solution was printed with a dispenser.63 Based on this process, an OFET array comprising 100 devices was fabricated with good uniformity (Fig. 10(a)).37 Although the dispensing method is helpful to achieve all additive printing processes, the resultant resolution is limited. In the work of Mizukami et al., a high-resolution Teflon bank structure was made by photolithographic wet-etching, and high resolution OSC patterning was achieved for fabricating flexible active matrix organic light-emitting diode displays (Fig. 10(b)).81,92

3. Approaches for low voltage operation
The required voltage for switching a field-effect transistor between ON and OFF states is determined by the subthreshold swing (SS), which is extracted as the inverse slope of the drain current log(ID) versus the gate to source voltage VGS in the subthreshold region. For OFETs, SS can be expressed as: (2)where kB is the Boltzman's constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the absolute value of the electron charge, Nsub (per unit area and unit energy) is the effective sub-gap density of states (DOS) contributed by both the deep bulk traps and the interface traps, and Cdiel is the specific gate dielectric capacitance.
According to eqn (2), SS can be decreased for low voltage operation by either enlarging Cdiel or reducing Nsub. Related material and device design for implementation of these two types of approaches to achieve low voltage OFETs will be reviewed in this part.
3.1 Enlarging the gate dielectric capacitance

C
diel can be enlarged by reducing the layer thickness of the gate dielectric, using a high-k dielectric material, or combining both. For convenience of processing, lots of OFET research used pre-deposited inorganic dielectric layers, such as thermal oxidized silicon oxide (SiO2), to make bottom gate structure devices.93–97 Different vacuum deposited high-k inorganic dielectrics (BZT, BST, and Si3N4, AlOx, ZrOx, HfOx, TiOx, TaOx, YOx,…) have been adopted for OFETs to reduce the operation voltage.98,99 In recent years, there have also been efforts in developing solution-processed high-k metal oxide dielectric layers for low voltage OFETs.100–105 However, these materials require high temperature and long time annealling processes to obtain good quality insulator layers. Moreover, the inorganic dielectric layers need an interfacial layer, such as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), to be deposited on top to form a low defect interface with the OSC layer. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, polymer dielectric materials are more preferred with considerations of low temperature and facile processing, and can also match the OSC layer better in terms of both electrical and mechanical properties.106 Therefore, in the following, the review will focus on OFETs using polymer dielectric materials.

3.1.1 Ultra-thin gate dielectric layers. 
Due to the low permittivity of common polymer dielectric materials, one needs to make a very thin layer (at least <100 nm) to realize low voltage OFETs, as shown in Table 2. At such a thickness, it is very difficult to achieve uniform films with the required insulating properties, which results in fabricated OFETs of poor device reliability and yield. Though crosslinking is able to improve the insulating properties as shown in Fig. 11, it is still challenging to apply for processing ultra-thin gate dielectric layers over large areas for low voltage OFETs.107–110

3.1.2 High-k polymeric dielectrics. 
In order to enlarge Cdiel, while not reducing the dielectric layer thickness, a high-k dielectric material is needed, as summarized in Table 3. Most common polymer dielectric materials are of low k. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) or poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVP) have relatively large k values (>7), and have been used for fabricating low voltage OFETs.50,114,116–118 However, these materials contain hydroxyl groups, which absorb water molecules and cause operational reliability issues in ambient conditions.122 By using n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to modify the PVA surface, Liu et al. fabricated OFETs with improved mobility, less hysteresis and better bias stability compared to the devices without OTS treatment.114 Alternatively, high-k poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) copolymers without hydroxyl groups have also been popularly used.115,119–121 Higher k could also be achieved by filling the PVDF copolymer with high-k ceramic nanoparticles, such as barium strontium titanate (BST).117 However, the intrinsic ferroelectric properties of P(VDF-TrFE) copolymers might cause serious current–voltage hysteresis with the fabricated OFETs.123,124

To suppress the ferroelectric properties, a small amount of the chloro-fluoroethylene (–CFE) monomer was introduced into the backbone of the P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer to disrupt ferroelectric domain formation and in turn form relaxor terpolymer P(VDF-TrFE-CFE).125,126 Yan et al. firstly used such P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) at a molar ratio of 56:36.5:7.5 as the gate dielectric layer (k of ∼55 at 1 kHz) for fabricating low voltage OFETs.120 With a P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) thickness of about 160 nm, the device based on pBTTTC16 presented a small SS less than 100 mV dec−1 and negligible hysteresis, as shown in Fig. 12(a). Low voltage OFET circuits were also realized based on the high-k P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) terpolymer gate dielectric layer.127,128 However, when the high-k gate dielectric layer directly interfaces the channel of “face-on” molecule packing, the energetic disorder caused by the dipoles in the high-k dielectric would tend to trap carriers from the gate bias induced conduction channel. The resulting localization of charge carriers could cause not only mobility degradation, but also increased hysteresis and device instabilities.129 To address the issues, a low-k/high-k bi-layer structure gate dielectric has been used with a thin low-k dielectric layer between the high-k one and the OSC to suppress the dipole field effect.130–132 By using thin PVA (20 nm) as the interfacial layer between P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) and n-type OSC P(NDI2OD-T2), the fabricated OFETs by Li et al. exhibited an improved mobility from 0.11 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1 with negligible hysteresis (Fig. 12(b)).121 Tang et al. fabricated low voltage OFETs using a low-k fluoropolymer dielectric CYTOP between donor–acceptor co-polymer OSC indacenodithiophene-benzothiadiazole (IDT-BT) and P(VDF-TrFE-CFE), also showing improved mobility compared to the device with the high-k dielectric layer (Fig. 12(c)).119 It was further found that, under gate bias, such a low-k/high-k bilayer gate dielectric structure could neutralize charge trapping at the OSC/gate dielectric interface and remnant polarization of the relaxor P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) for improved bias stress stability (Fig. 12(d)).133

The same CYTOP/P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) bilayer gate dielectric was also used by Pecunia et al. to fabricate low-voltage OFETs using F4-TCNQ doped IDT-BT as the channel, showing near-to-ideal field effect transistor behaviors with small contact resistance, similar linear and saturation mobilities, and weak gate voltage dependence of mobilities.134 Another fluoropolymer dielectric Teflon was used by Ng et al. as the thin low-k dielectric layer to form a thick (>700 nm) Teflon/P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) bilayer gate dielectric for fabricating printed OFETs, as shown in Fig. 13(a).79,135 Various OFET circuits have been further fabricated based on this device structure, including a pulsed voltage multiplier, NAND and NOR gates, ring oscillators, and a gain stage with a latch (Fig. 13(b) and (c)).79,80,131

3.2 Reducing the sub-gap density of states at the channel
Only enlarging Cdiel to reduce the operation voltage highly relies on the gate dielectric layer. Using a high-k polymer dielectric can help to achieve large Cdiel without reducing the layer thickness, and is thus more suitable for large area printing or solution based processes. However, there is lack of solution processable polymer dielectric materials of high enough k values. According to eqn (2), a lower sub-gap DOS at the channel is also able to decrease the SS. Feng et al. demonstrated solution processed low voltage OFETs with a very small SS value of about 100 mV dec−1 using a blend of TIPS-pentacene and PS (3:1, wt%) on a relatively thick (407 nm) low-k polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (k of ∼5.6) layer (Fig. 14(a)).136 With a small gate dielectric capacitance of 12.2 nF cm−2, realization of such steep SS was attributed to the reduced sub-gap DOS. Using the same TIPS-pentacene/PS blend as the channel, this method was proved to be applicable for different polymer dielectric materials, such as PS, poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA), poly(iso-butylmethacrylate) (PiBMA) and poly(4-methylstyrene) (PMS) and poly(vinyl cinnamate) (PVCN).47,137–139 Even with a micrometer thick SU8 gate dielectric layer resulting in a very small gate dielectric capacitance of 2.9 nF cm−2, low voltage OFETs with a subthreshold swing of about 250 mV dec−1 were realized by Tang et al. (Fig. 14(b)).46 With such a thick gate dielectric layer, the gate leakage current of the OFETs remained around 1 pA (seven orders of magnitude lower than the drain current) with the gate voltage changing from 20 to −40 V. These results well prove that such a method for reducing the sub-gap DOS at the channel is applicable for various low-k polymer dielectric materials.

Such a method has also been demonstrated with other organic semiconductor materials instead of the TIPS-pentacene/PS blend, as summarized in Table 4. Fukuda et al. fabricated low voltage OFETs with a small subthreshold swing of 170 mV dec−1 using solution processed DTBDT-C6 as the channel layer on a 560 nm thick low-k parylene-C gate dielectric layer.140 It was further found with a blend of DTBDT-C6 and PS, the contact resistance between the channel layer and the inkjet printed Ag electrodes was able to be significantly reduced, resulting in a relatively high mobility of about 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 even at a short channel length of 9 μm.91 In the work of Kunii et al., a 2-decyl-7-pehnl-[1] benzothieno[3,2-b][1] benzothiophene (Ph-BTBT-10) film of a highly ordered smectic E liquid crystalline phase was obtained to form a low sub-gap DOS channel on a PS coated SiO2 gate dielectric layer for realizing low-voltage OFETs with a SS of 79 mV dec−1.141

Based on this structure, various low voltage analog and logic circuits have been fabricated by Tokito et al., as shown in Fig. 15. Printed organic unipolar p-type inverters based on DTBDT-C6/PS blends were operated at 0.5 V (Fig. 15(a)).64 Low voltage n-type OFETs were also realized based on the same mechanism, enabling fabrication of vertically stacked complementary inverters.65 By a combination of diF-TES-ADT/PS as the p-channel layer and TU-3/PαMS as the n-channel, the developed CMOS inverters functioned at operating voltages as low as 2.5 V and presented a high gain over 10 (Fig. 15(b)).

Based on the low voltage printed DTBDT-C6 OFETs, Tokito et al. fabricated a low-voltage differential amplifier circuit consisting of two diode-load OFET inverters for detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the presence of a large excess of bovine serum albumin (BSA) interferent.140 To achieve a highly controllable switching voltage and closed-loop gain, printed negative-feedback amplifier circuits were achieved with a tunable gain of 3.1–8.3 and high linearity.142 When the fabricated amplifier was integrated into a potentiometric electrochemical K+ sensing system, the ion concentration sensitivity was improved from 34 mV dec−1 to 160 mV dec−1 with high linearity.
3.3 Combination of two approaches
To further reduce the SS, the two approaches, including using a low-k/high-k bilayer gate dielectric and reducing the sub-gap DOS at the channel, were implemented in the same BGBC structure.49 As illustrated in Fig. 16(a), by using a low-k/high-k PVCN/P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) bi-layer gate dielectric and optimizing the thickness of the low-k interfacial layer (PVCN), OFETs with a very small SS of less than 70 mV dec−1 were obtained using the TIPS-pentacene/PS blend as the channel layer. Such a small SS value is close to the theoretic limit of 59.6 mV dec−1. The devices also presented excellent storage and operation stability. With fully printable and solution based processes, the device design was shown to be suitable to be “manufactured-on-demand” as depicted in Fig. 16(b).143 The ion sensing performance of the low voltage OFET is compared with that of a commercial Si-FET chip, with the measurement setup shown in Fig. 16(c). The results in Fig. 16(d) show the OFET based sensor presents similar sensitivity to that of the Si-FET one. The OFET sensor was demonstrated to continuously test different buffer solutions with pH values ranging from 7.0 to 8.0.

4. Conclusions and outlook
In summary, much effort has been devoted to realizing fine-resolution printing of OFETs with low operational voltages, which can find promising applications in sensors and signal processing circuitry. In the device fabrication, three important issues are critical to the device performance, including short channels and narrow line width, self-aligned gate structure and OSC layer patterning. The recently developed techniques related to these issues are thoroughly reviewed. Although inkjet printing is the most preferred approach for depositing every layer of OFETs towards “manufacturing-on-demand”, it has strict requirements in ink material development, tiny ink droplet manipulation and process control, which limit its use for achieving fine-resolution printing of OFETs. Therefore, for that purpose, hybrid processing schemes combining different printing, solution-based or even other facile approaches are more feasible techniques. Another important topic that has been reviewed is how to realize low-voltage OFETs. Two approaches, including enlarging Cdiel with a high-k polymer dielectric and reducing Nsub at the channel, are demonstrated to be effective in reducing the subthreshold swing and the operational voltage of printable OFETs. The combination of all the techniques can be a promising way to further improve the device performance in the future.
Further work in this field could be devoted to the following topics.
(1) Most of the research on printed OFETs is still at the device-level. Towards making circuit integration, a full process flow incorporating the techniques for fine resolution needs to be developed. For that, high resolution via formation is also important, though it is not covered in this review.144
(2) Currently, the performance of reported fully printed or solution processed OFETs needs to be improved in terms of poor mobility (<1 cm2 V−1 s−1) and relatively low ON/OFF current ratio (102–106) as shown in Table 1. Making OFETs using state-of-the-art high performance OSC materials in fully printing or solution processes is needed.
(3) In addition to process issues, when the channel becomes short, the contact resistance starts to dominate the device performance and counteract the benefits brought by scaling of the channel length.145 Thus, it will be important to consider how to reduce the contact resistance when developing fine resolution OFET processes towards high-frequency performance.146
(4) For many envisioned applications, low-voltage operated OFETs with steep subthreshold swing are required to meet the system power constraints and avoid the generation of interference signals at large voltage bias.25 For sensor applications, steeper subthreshold swing can also help to achieve larger transconductance efficiency for higher sensitivity.26 Developing compatible processes and device structures to achieve fully printed or solution processed low voltage OFETs of high performance is also needed.
(5) Last but not least, after addressing the above issues, it is urged to establish standard material stacks, device/integration architectures, and manufacturing processes, and then develop process design kits and design tools to accommodate different applications.17
