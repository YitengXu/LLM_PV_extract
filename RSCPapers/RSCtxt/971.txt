    , Accepted 11th March 2023First published on 13th March 2023AbstractThe increased awareness of carbon management has prompted the scientific community towards delivering sustainable catalytic technologies, preferably from CO2. Copper-based multifunctional catalysts are the most frequently used for thermal hydrogenation and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2R) processes. To improve the understanding and efficacy of these materials for the CO2R reaction, Cu–Zn oxides combined with Al2O3 and ZrO2 were synthesized by the coprecipitation method and annealed at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C (i.e., Cu/ZnO/Al2O3-x and Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 systems-x, where x is the annealing temperature) to tune their multi-functionality. We demonstrate that the composition of Cu–Zn oxides and pretreatment temperature impact the electrocatalytic CO2R performance, where CuZnZr-600 and CuZnAl-700 materials are superior. Different characterization tools were employed to rationalize the results described in this work, which could provide a way to design an efficient catalytic system for the CO2R process.
1. Introduction
In the era of increased inspection of carbon emissions and their management, achieving an appropriate balance between implementing sustainable environmental policies and the rising global demand for value-added commodities in the petrochemical industry is challenging.1–3 In order to achieve this objective and reduce the burden from the depleting fossil reserves, the feedstock and energy source of future chemical technologies should be based only on renewables (e.g., CO2, wind, solar energy, and so on). Among numerous employed approaches, the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 reaction (CO2R) is attractive and challenging for both practical and fundamental reasons: CO2 could be captured from the air or exhaust gas in the chemical industry, but it is also a highly stable molecule that requires high energy for conversion.4 Moreover, the CO2R driven by non-conventional sources of energy is a promising approach to generating a closed-loop CO2 cycle. As a result, it could reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere and convert them into high-energy-density carbon-based fuels such as hydrocarbons and alcohols.5 The low selectivity of the desired products and the cost of catalytic materials remain a barrier to making this process feasible on an industrial scale. Developing a decently active and selective electrocatalyst, which is also inexpensive, long-lasting, and energy-efficient should be the priority and scope of this research work.6
Designing the metal/electrolyte interface, adding a secondary metal to establish a bimetallic structure, and utilizing nanostructured metals are some of the strategies that have been suggested to improve the efficiency and multifunctionality of metal-based catalysts.7 Because of their suitable physical–chemical properties, copper-based catalysts are the most used in hydrogenation processes. Also, Cu-based metallic species are the most crucial active component in diverse classes of CO2 activation pathways, including the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH3OH.8 At the same time, it is generally proposed that the coordination, chemisorption, and activation of CO2 take place at Cu0 or Cu+ sites. Simultaneously, the Hδ+ and Hδ− ions required for the catalytic process are provided by the homogeneous splitting of hydrogen at the promoter site, usually zinc oxide.9 However, the efficiency and selectivity need to be improved further, necessitating innovation and the development of catalysts to be more efficacious.10 According to the literature, Cu-based catalysts were modified by noble metals, including Ag,11 Au,12 and post-transition metals such as Sn,13 In14etc. to improve the efficiency of the catalyst. In addition, other promoters, for example, alkali metals or a second oxide, such as ZrO2, were proven effective in improving CuO–ZnO catalysts’ performance.
Many research groups claimed that ZrO2 is an additional component for hydrogenation purposes as it has high stability under reducing or oxidizing conditions. Also, Al2O3 was used in catalytic systems with a stronger affinity to water, which can act as a poison on active metal sites.15,16 Furthermore, several research groups observed that the CO2 conversion and selectivity to methanol could be increased due to an improved Cu dispersion in the presence of ZrO2, while the authors reported that CuO and ZrO2 are not physically mixed, but interacted with each other.17–23 On the other hand, ZnO is an essential component in Cu-based CO2 hydrogenation catalysts because it prevents the agglomeration of Cu particles, thus leading to the large Cu surface area needed for CO2 reduction.24 This criterion makes such materials suitable for the CO2R process. Chen et al.25 found that the reduction of CO2 by a CuZnNi mixed oxide catalyst synthesized by the sol–gel method offered high reactivity and selectivity.26 Furthermore, Li et al.27 refer to the effect of the composition and geometric structure of CuO–ZnO catalysts for producing C2H4 and C2H5OH. According to their reports, using an 8CuO/2ZnO/C electrocatalyst, a faradaic efficiency (FE) of ∼24% was achieved at −0.75 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). It was observed that the reduced ZnO nanoparticles supply extra CO to reduced CuO nanoparticles to improve the CO surface coverage for C–C coupling. Similarly, Su et al.28 revealed that hierarchically meso–macroporous Cu/Zn alloy catalysts promote CO2 electroreduction towards liquid C2 products. Herein, the optimized CuZn electrocatalyst exhibited high ethanol selectivity (∼46%) at −0.8 V and excellent stability (even after electrocatalysis for 11 h) towards the CO2 electroreduction.
In order to understand the efficiency of trimetallic oxide catalytic systems for the CO2R process, this work explores the nanosized trimetallic mixed CuZnAl and CuZnZr oxide catalysts, which were synthesized by varying the calcination temperature. The effect of calcination temperature on the phase transition was also studied. The efficacy of mixed CuZnAl and CuZnZr oxides for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction was tested to understand their physicochemical properties’ fundamental similarities and differences. Various characterization techniques were utilized to determine the physicochemical properties of the synthesized samples intending to understand their working principle, which could provide a basis for the future design of analogous materials.
2. Experimental
2.1. Reagents and materials
Cupric nitrate trihydrate [Cu(NO3)2·3H2O] and zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O] were from Loba Chemie, Germany. Aluminum nitrate nonahydrate [Al(NO3)3·9H2O], zirconium nitrate pentahydrate [Zr(NO3)4·5H2O], and benzyl alcohol [C6H5CH2OH] were purchased from BDH, England. Sodium hydroxide [NaOH] was obtained from Sigma Aldrich, Germany, and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2, 30%] from AppliChem.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
The tri-metal hydroxides (CuZnAl and CuZnZr) with fixed nominal molar compositions [Cu = 0.675, Zn = 0.275 and Al or Zr = 0.05] were prepared by mixing copper, zinc, and aluminum or zirconium nitrates using 0.1 M NaOH as a precipitating agent under vigorous stirring at constant pH ∼ 7 and 60 °C. The precipitated cake was washed with distilled water several times until the contents were free from sodium and nitrate ions under vacuum filtration. Then, the filtered cake was dried at 100 °C for 16 h followed by calcination at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and the targeted temperature was maintained for 5 h.
2.3. Characterization techniques
The bulk elemental chemical analysis was accomplished using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Thermo-Scientific iCAP 6000 series). Thermogravimetric (TG) measurements were performed by using a Seiko SSC/S200 model at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The crystallographic structure of the synthesized materials was characterized by X-ray diffraction using a Bruker diffractometer (Brucker D8 Advance, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with copper Kα (λ = 1.5405 Å) and a monochromator at 40 kV and 40 mA, in the 2θ range of 10–80°. The BET surface area, total pore volume, and pore radii of different solid samples were determined from N2 physisorption experiments performed at −196 °C using a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ instrument after degassing the samples at 200 °C for 6 h. XPS was performed with a Kratos AXIS HSi instrument equipped with a charge neutralizer and an Al Kα X-ray source. Spectra were recorded at normal emission with an analyzer pass energy of 40 eV, and an X-ray power of 225 W. Binding energies were referenced to both adventitious carbon and the valence band. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) measurements were carried out using a JEOL JSM840A fitted with an Oxford Instruments INCA energy dispersive analytical system. The coating of each of the powders was attached to an aluminum block using double-sided carbon tape. The SEM images (20×) were acquired for each of the powders, and EDX analysis of 3 points of each sample was performed. A JEOL 2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 200 kV was used to study the nanostructure. The samples were supported on holey carbon-filmed copper grids. Nanoscale chemical composition analyses were carried out simultaneously.
2.4. Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical CO2 reduction experiments were performed using a CHI760E electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system at room temperature in 0.1 M and 0.5 M KHCO3. The self-supporting catalysts were coated on 1 cm × 1 cm carbon paper as the working electrode, a Pt electrode was used as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. An H-type device made of two-compartment cells, separated by a Nafion-117 proton-exchange membrane, was used to separate the cathode and anode and prevent the diffusion of products. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) scans were carried out in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Before conducting the test, CO2 (gas) was continuously fed into the cathode compartment (constant rate) to form a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 (pH = 6.8) solution. The electrolyte solution was saturated with CO2 before any test, and the potential was converted to RHE scale according to E (V vs. RHE) = E (V vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 V + 0.059 × pH.
3. Results and discussion
The chemical analysis of the as-synthesized dried materials was carried out utilizing the ICP-AES technique. The actual chemical composition of CuZnAl and CuZnZr samples is shown in Table S1.† It is clear that their actual composition [Cu = 0.675, Zn = 0.275 and Al or Zr = 0.05] is in accordance with the nominal composition, indicating the successful synthesis of ternary mixed oxide samples. The thermal behavior of the as-synthesized CuZnAl and CuZnZr materials was studied by TG analyses. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows TG patterns for CuZnAl and CuZnZr samples, where four major thermal decomposition steps at 150 °C, ∼200 °C, 450 °C, and above 800 °C were recorded for the investigated samples. The weight loss that occurred at a temperature range of 150–200 °C could be attributed to weakly and strongly bound physiosorbed water molecules, and the third could be attributed to the water of crystallization (eqn (1)). (1)
The weight loss at 450 °C could be due to the decomposition of hydroxyl groups from the precipitated metal hydroxides, as presented in eqn (2). (2)
The final weight loss above 800 °C could be assigned to the departure of the lattice oxygen according to the following eqn (3). (3)where X = Al or Zr.
The XRD patterns of CuZnAl and CuZnZr samples calcined at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C in air are displayed in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern of the CuZnAl sample calcined at 500 °C (Fig. 1A) showed reflections at 2θ = 31.79°, 34.45°, 36.28°, 47.59°, 56.63°, 62.9°, 66.47°, 68°, 69.12°, and 76.96° corresponding to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (201), and (202) planes of the ZnO phase [JCPDS 01-089-0511], respectively. Other reflections at 2θ = 35.57, 38.83, 48.71, 61.56, and 72.57°, corresponding to the (002), (111), (−202), (−113), and (311) planes of the CuO crystalline phase were also observed [JCPDS 45-0937], respectively. No other reflections were noted due to the presence of impurities for the CuZnAl sample calcined at 500 °C, and the average crystallite size of the CuO phase is ∼68.2 nm. Solid–solid interactions were not observed among ZnO, CuO, and Al2O3 at 500 °C, and a small crystal size for ZnO (40.5 nm) was observed, which may be due to a high degree of CuO dispersion (Table S2†).

Furthermore, the possible interaction between ZnO and Al2O3 to form ZnAl2O4 might decrease the possibility of the reaction between CuO and Al2O3 to form the CuAl2O4 phase. Interestingly, the formation of CuAl2O4 did not occur even at 600 °C, as the XRD pattern of this sample shows reflections due to individual ZnO, CuO, and Al2O3 phases. This is possibly due to the presence of ZnO species on the surface layers of Al2O3 particles, which could inhibit the diffusion of CuO species into the Al2O3 matrix to form CuAl2O4.29 However, the CuZnAl sample calcined at 700 °C showed reflections due to the CuAl2O4 crystalline phase along with minor reflections due to ZnO and CuO. The XRD patterns of CuZnZr samples calcined at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C are presented in Fig. 1(B). All three samples exhibited reflections due to CuO and ZnO phases. In addition, the sample calcined at 500 °C showed reflections at 2θ = 30.4°, 35.4°, 50.7°, 60.3°, 62.9°, and 69° corresponding to the tetragonal ZrO2 phase [JCPDS no. 802156]. However, the samples calcined at 600 and 700 °C showed the presence of reflections due to the monoclinic ZrO2 phase. Lin et al.30 investigated the influence of calcination temperature on the phase transition process of pure nanocrystalline ZrO2 from tetragonal to monoclinic. At 500 °C, the ZrO2 sample exhibited a tetragonal structure, while the sample calcined in the temperature range of 600–800 °C showed the presence of both tetragonal and monoclinic structures.31 However, the sample calcined at 900–1000 °C exhibited only the monoclinic ZrO2 phase. Bhagwat et al.32 synthesized Cu–ZrO2 samples containing 2–20 mol% Cu and observed that ZrO2 existed in both tetragonal and cubic phases for all the samples with some volume percent of the monoclinic phase. The authors observed that increased Cu concentration stabilized the cubic ZrO2 phase at the expense of the tetragonal phase. In our previous publication,33 we observed that after impregnating 10 wt% CuO, the volume percentage of the monoclinic ZrO2 phase was increased significantly; however, the increase of CuO loading to 20 wt%, led to a decrease in monoclinic phase volume and the formation of cubic ZrO2 was observed. On the other hand, Wahba et al.34 synthesized ZnO–ZrO2 samples and at high concentrations of Zr (10 and 20 wt%), tetragonal ZrO2 was detected. By increasing the concentration of Zr to 30, 40, and 50 wt%, formation of the ZrO2 monoclinic structure was reported.
These findings indicate that the calcination temperature and amount of ZnO and CuO presented in the sample could significantly influence the stabilization of the ZrO2 phase. All three synthesized samples exhibited reflections due to CuO and ZnO phases. In addition, the sample calcined at 500 °C showed reflections at 2θ = 30.4°, 35.4°, 50.7°, 60.3°, 62.9°, and 69° corresponding to the tetragonal ZrO2 phase [JCPDS no. 802156]. However, the samples calcined at 600 and 700 °C showed the presence of reflections due to the monoclinic ZrO2 phase. It is well known that the treatment of ZrO2 samples at high temperatures leads to ZrO2 phase transformation from tetragonal to monoclinic; however, in the present study, the transformation occurred at low temperature (600 °C). This is possibly due to the presence of ZnO and CuO in the system, which could induce the phase transformation to the metastable monoclinic ZrO2 phase at relatively low temperatures.35,36 The average crystallite size of the ZrO2 crystallites for nanosized mixed oxide samples is 36 nm, 50 nm, and 65 nm for the samples calcined at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C, respectively (Table S2†).
The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Fig. S2†) for CuZnAl and CuZnZr samples calcined at 500 °C show the typical type IV isotherm according to the IUPAC nomenclature.37 A steep increase occurs in the isotherm curve at a relative pressure of 0.2 < P/P0 < 0.4, due to the mesopore filling by capillary condensation for the narrow pore-sized materials. The nanometric size of the materials calcined at 500 °C affects the elevation of the step isotherm in the P/P0 range of 0.89–0.98. Hysteresis appeared in the multilayer range of physisorption isotherms is generally connected with capillary condensation in the mesoporous structures. A vertical, parallel over a considerable range of gas uptake, H1 hysteresis was recorded. The BET-surface area cited in Table S3† shows that the value of CuZnZr-500 is 26 m2 g−1 which is relatively higher than that of CuZnAl-500 (16 m2 g−1) due to the uniform unimodal mesoporous nature of this particular sample, where CuZnAl-500 showed a multimodal distribution in the macroporous region [Fig. S2(a) and (b)†]. Other CuZnAl and CuZnZr samples calcined at 600 and 700 °C showed a type V isotherm with H3 hysteresis, indicating multilayer adsorption on macroporous materials. These samples showed low BET-surface area, which is due to the macroporous nature and relatively large crystallite size.
The electrochemical performance of all synthesized materials is depicted in Fig. 2–4. The electrochemical CO2 reduction performance of two series of catalysts [CuZnAl-x and CuZnZr-x (x is the temperature value: 500 °C/600 °C/700 °C)] was examined in an H-cell separated by a proton exchange membrane. Fig. S3A† shows the LSV of CuZnAl-x electrodes under a CO2 atmosphere. The onset potential at 10 mA cm−2 of CuZnAl-500, CuZnAl-600, and CuZnAl-700 electrodes under a CO2 atmosphere is −1.16 V, −1.09 V, and −1.23 V vs. RHE, respectively, indicating that CuZnAl-600 shows better performance than the other tested catalysts. Fig. S3B† shows the LSV of CuZnZr-x electrodes under a CO2 atmosphere. The onset potentials at 10 mA cm−2 of CuZnZr-500, CuZnZr-600, and CuZnZr-700 electrodes under a CO2 atmosphere are −1.14 V, −1.18 V, and −1.21 V vs. RHE, which are very close to each other.

Fig. 2(B–D) shows the faradaic efficiencies (FE) as a function of cathode potentials for CuZnZr electrodes. For the CuZnZr-500 electrode, the faradaic efficiencies of the C1 products (CO, CH4, and HCOOH) smoothly increased from 17% to 47% from the lower to higher potential window (−0.7 to −1.1 V vs. RHE). Notably, CuZnZr-600 has a high selectivity for C1 products (CO, CH4, and HCOOH), with more than 50% faradaic efficiency in a higher potential range (from −0.9 to −1.2 V vs. RHE), where the faradaic efficiency reaches the maximum at −1.1 V vs. RHE. In addition, at −1.1 V vs. RHE, the FEs for CO, CH4, and HCOOH products were 45%, 8%, and 8%, respectively. The total FE of C1 and C2 products were up to 68%. For the CuZnZr-700 electrode, the faradaic efficiencies of the C1 products (CO and HCOOH) smoothly increased from 20% to 42% from the lower to higher potential window (−0.7 to −1.1 V vs. RHE). The H2 faradaic efficiency increased, when the electrolyte was changed to 0.5 M KHCO3, reaching more than 70% [Fig. 2(A)]. Therefore, increasing the electrolyte concentration led to poor CO2R performance. For the CuZnZr-700 electrode, the faradaic efficiencies of the C1 products (CO, CH4, and HCOOH) varied from 20% to 40% in the low to high potential window (−0.8 to −1.1 V vs. RHE). Overall, CuZnZr-600 shows superior CO2R performance among the CuZnZr series of samples.

Fig. 3(A–C) shows the faradaic efficiencies as a function of cathode potentials for CuZnAl electrodes. For the CuZnAl-500 electrode, the faradaic efficiencies of the C1 products increased quickly from 23% to 47% from the lower to higher potential window. For the CuZnAl-600 electrode, the faradaic efficiencies of the C1 products varied from 20% to 40% in the lower to higher potential window (−0.7 to −1.1 V vs. RHE). For the CuZnAl-700 electrode, the faradaic efficiencies of the C1 products rapidly increased from 12% to 40% from the lower to higher potential window (−0.7 to −1.1 V vs. RHE), and C2 products (C2H4 and CH3COOH increased from 2% to 21% from the lower to high-potential window (−0.7 to −1.1 V vs. RHE). The above-mentioned results demonstrated that CuZnAl-700 in the CuZnAl series shows the best performance for converting CO2.
Since the electrochemical surface area  (ECSA) is important in evaluating the active sites of electrocatalysts, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which is positively correlated with the ECSA, was calculated by measuring the CV current response in the non-faradaic range [Fig. 4(C–E)]. CV was performed at scan rates of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mV s−1 in a CO2-bubbled 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte.
The potential window of the CV curve was selected between 0.43 V and 0.53 V vs. RHE, because this interval only involves double-layer charging and discharging, the slope from the linear relationship of the current density against the scan rate. CuZnZr-600 and CuZnAa-700 showed the largest capacitance values of ∼5.44 mF cm−2 and 5.4 mF cm−2 among two series electrodes in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solution, indicating similar ECSA and the same ECSA-normalized LSV. To examine the charge transfer behavior, EIS analysis was undertaken. Fig. 4(B) shows that the CuZnZr-600 and CuZnA-700 catalysts have the same solution resistance (13 Ω) during the CO2RR process, further accelerating the mass transfer rate.
The synthesized CuZnAl and CuZnZr materials were further characterized by electron microscopy analysis (SEM and TEM). First, the morphology of the samples was examined by recording SEM images (Fig. 5). The SEM images showed significant differences in the morphology of CuZnAl and CuZnZr materials, and the calcination temperature had a significant influence on the morphology of the sample. The CuZnAl samples showed the coexistence of both lamellar agglomeration and a dendritic structure. With the increase in calcination temperature, the dendritic structures disappeared, and lamellar structures became prominent. On the other hand, the CuZnZr samples showed flake-shaped aggregates at different temperatures, and their diameter increased with the increase in calcination temperature. In comparison, the CuZnZr-600 sample exhibited large-size lamellar aggregates (up to 200 nm). In contrast, the CuZnAl-700 sample possessed small-sized lamellar particles (about 100 nm) along with tiny platelets throughout the surface.

The TEM analysis of CuZnZr-600 and CuZnAl-700 materials was performed to observe the distribution of elementary particles (Fig. 6 and 7). TEM-mapping on the CuZnZr-600 sample with a flake-shaped structure was performed, where the relatively uniform distribution of Cu and Zr particles could be observed on the catalyst surface. The distribution of Zn particles is not uniform, but higher agglomeration/clustering of Zn particles was noted (also see Fig. 5), which was the reason for the production of a large amount of CO (vide infra). TEM-mapping of the CuZnAl-700 material with a platelet-like structure was performed, where Cu, Zn, and Al elements were uniformly distributed in the particles.

The synthesized catalysts in this study are fundamentally similar to thermo-catalytic methanol synthesis catalysts. In general, CO2 hydrogenation is a multi-step reaction, involving formic acid, formaldehyde, and methanol formation from CO2, as shown in Scheme 1.38 Catalysts with multicomponent metal oxides play different roles in the reaction system. In the conventional thermo-catalytic reaction, prior to the reaction, copper oxides in Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts need to be reduced to metallic Cu under a H2 atmosphere to achieve a better CO2 hydrogenation activity. The most accepted mechanism for the formation of CH3OH from CO2 hydrogenation indicated that CO2 molecules could adsorb on both surfaces of metal oxides (ZnO and ZrO2) and there was an interfacial contact between Cu and metal oxides to form a bicarbonate species, while H adsorbed dissociatively on the surface of Cu0. The adsorbed H atoms over the Cu0 particle surface could transfer via a spillover to the bicarbonate species for the hydrogenation, and then the production of a formate intermediate species consecutively. The formate intermediate species could be subjected to hydrogenation to form dioxomethylene, and finally methoxide species. The large surface area of the Cu0 species, which was usually related to the small particle size of Cu could provide the large interfacial contact between Cu and metal oxides.23 Therefore, the catalysts containing a high Cu0 surface area exhibit a high CO2 conversion to CH3OH.

The other debatable mechanisms are the reverse water–gas shift reaction (CO2-to-CO conversion). Two major mechanisms, including a surface redox mechanism39 and a formate decomposition mechanism,40 were proposed by different researchers. The difference between these two mechanisms is that the CO is formed directly on the surface of the Cu0 species for the former, while the surface of metal oxides (ZnO and ZrO2) and the interfacial contact between the Cu0 and metal oxides act as the active sites for the latter. A linear correlation between the CO2-to-CO conversion and the Cu0 surface area observed in the literature reports indicates that the reverse water–gas shift reaction proceeds via the surface redox mechanism. However, as mentioned above, the high Cu0 surface area could create a larger number of active sites in the latter mechanism. Therefore, on the basis of the reported results in the literature the Cu0 surface area determines the CO2-to-CO conversion.41
The thermodynamic barrier for the CO2R and the single electron reduction of CO2 to CO2− requires a large potential [−1.9 V (vs. SHE)], as shown in Scheme 2. However, the H+-coupled electron transfer reactions normally occur at lower potentials, thereby reducing the thermodynamic barrier. The reduction of protons to hydrogen occurs at the cathode and has a low thermodynamic potential; therefore, it is a major competing reaction to CO2R. The electrocatalytic production of CH4 and C2H4 instead of CH3OH contradicts thermo-catalytic gas-phase CO2 reduction over Cu-based catalysts, which produce majorly CH3OH. Hori et al.42 indicated the formation of a hydroxymethylidyne (*COH) intermediate for CH4 production over Cu electrodes and assumed that *COH reduction is the rate-determining step during the CO2R. Gattrell et al.43 also reported that electro-reduction of CO over Cu-based catalysts leads to a similar product distribution as for the CO2R, emphasizing that the rate-determining step occurs after the formation of CO. DeWulf et al.44 proposed that a surface carbene species (CuCH2*) formed during the electrocatalytic CO2R is a precursor for CH4 formation from the reaction with H atoms, as well as for C2H4 formation via dimerization. In addition, the computational studies clearly revealed that the reduction of CO is the key selectivity-determining step in the CO2R over Cu-based catalysts. The dominant path proceeds through the reduction of CO to *COH, which eventually leads to the formation of CHx species, and can produce both CH4 and C2H4. This path is not observed during the thermo-catalytic methanol synthesis using CO2/CO hydrogenation. This is mainly due to the absence of an aqueous environment to form *COH species, and also because an applied potential is needed to drive the forward reaction through *COH to CH4 and C2H4.

The chemical nature of the electrocatalyst has a great influence on its electrochemical performance. Therefore, the valence state and elemental composition of CuZnZr-600 and CuZnAl-700 electrodes were investigated by XPS analysis, as depicted in Fig. 8. Herein, the material before and after the reaction was subjected to the characterization. The charging effect is corrected relative to the carbon C 1s peak (binding energy at 284.8 eV). For the CuZnZr-600 electrode, the XPS peaks of Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 around 1022.8 eV and 1046.3 eV, respectively, indicated that Zn species existed as Zn2+. After the reaction, the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 signals were shifted by 0.5 eV each. The Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks at 934.3 eV and 956.1 eV, respectively, could be assigned to Cu2+. After the reaction, the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 signals were shifted by 0.3 eV, and −0.9 eV, respectively, and the shift to the lower energy level proves that Cu is involved in the reduction reaction.
 Fig. 8  XPS spectra of CuZnZr-600 and CuZnAl-700 electrodes (both before and after the reaction): (A) Cu 2p for CuZnZr-600, (B) Cu 2p for CuZnAl-700, (C) Zn 2p for CuZnZr-600, (D) Zn 2p for CuZnAl-700, (E) Zr 3d for CuZnZr-600, and (F) Al 2p for CuZnAl-700. 
The Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 peaks at 182.8 eV and 185.2 eV, respectively, could be assigned to Zr4+. After the reaction, the signals of Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 were shifted by 0.7 eV and −0.1 eV, respectively. For the CuZnAl-700 electrode, the XPS peaks of Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 around 1023.6 eV and 1046.5 eV, respectively, indicated that the Zn species existed as Zn2+. After the reaction, the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 signals were shifted by −0.6 eV and −0.3 eV, respectively, proving that Zn is involved in the reduction process. The Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks at 934.5 eV and 957.6 eV, respectively, could be assigned to Cu2+. After the reaction, the Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 signals were shifted by −0.2 eV and −2.4 eV, respectively, and the shift to the lower energy level proves that Cu is involved in the reduction reaction. The Al 2p peak at 76.3 eV could be assigned to Al3+, and then this signal was shifted by −1 eV. The peak shifting after the reaction also proves its involvement in the reduction process. At the same time, for the CuZnZr-600 sample, the XP peak intensities of Cu2+ and Zr4+ elements decreased after the reaction, while the peak intensity of the Zn2+ species increased. This essentially proved the preferential transfer of Zn's electrons to the surface of the material, which had an impact on the outcome of the catalytic reaction. For the CuZnAl-700 material, the XP peak intensities of Cu2+ and Al3+ species increased, while that of the Zn2+ species decreased, indicating that surface-centric Cu and Al species were dominant in the catalytic reaction. Therefore, the presence of Al is more beneficial for the electrochemical reaction compared to that of Zr in this study, which might influence the dynamic evolution of the active catalytic material during the electrocatalytic CO2R reaction.45
The synthesized CuZnAl and CuZnZr oxide catalysts were used for the electrocatalytic CO2R without pre-reduction. However, a possible reduction takes place during the electrocatalytic process. Many researchers reported a plausible reaction mechanism for the CO2R considering the conversion of CO2 into C2 products over copper-based catalysts. The synthesized Cu-based electrodes are capable of catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to highly reduced products (the product requiring the transfer of >6 electrons in an aqueous solution) at near-neutral pH in high yields.46 Indeed, the active catalytic materials could dynamically evolve during the electrocatalytic CO2R, which had an impact on all catalysts tested in this work. Yet, we found that the CuZnAl-700 catalyst offered higher selectivity for C2+-products compared to CuZnZr-600 at −1.1 V vs. RHE. Also, CuZnZr-600 or CuZnAl-700 could also form hetero-structured Cu/oxides to a certain extent. It seems that the presence of Al oxide (XPS analysis results) is beneficial for the catalytic process. Li et al.45 reported that a ZrO2-modified Cu electrode shows a high faradaic efficiency of 85% for C2+ products and these metal oxides possessed the capability of stabilizing the adsorbed *CO2/*CO and decreasing the Gibbs free energies of the C–C coupling process, promoting the formation of C2+ products. It is possible that the CuZnAl-700 catalyst possessed strongly basic sites compared to other catalysts to stabilize the adsorbed *CO2/*CO species.
The XPS analysis of fresh and spent electrodes shows a clear decrease in the Cu2+ species in the spent electrodes (Fig. 8) as seen from the Cu 2p spectra. The increased Cu2+ reduction to Cu+ under the applied electric potentials makes the CuZnAl-700 and CuZnZr-600 catalysts more selective to the CO2 conversion products. It is possible that increasing the Cu+ content could lower the CO affinity leading to greater CO production. In addition, the production of C2H5OH suggests the formation of mixed Cu oxidation states such as Cu0 and Cu+, which can perform the *CO dimerization to generate C–C bonds and C2+ products.47 Therefore, the different surface Cu species presented in the synthesized catalysts and generated during the electrocatalytic activity studies could justify the diverse products obtained in the present study48 and these observations are in good agreement with previous studies.49 Formation of hydrocarbons and oxygenate products was observed when the catalysts were composed of Cu nanoparticles larger than 15 nm, whereas CO and H2 were formed with catalysts containing smaller size Cu particles (<3–6 nm). Therefore, the difference in the CuO crystallite size of the CuZnAl and CuZnZr catalysts (Table S2†) could explain the different selectivity of the catalytic materials. Moreover, Kuhl et al.50 indicated that catalysts with polycrystalline Cu species yield many CO2 reduction products, which is in good agreement with the behavior of the synthesized catalysts.
It is clear from activity test results that the addition of Al favors the formation of a wider class of products, such as ethanol, whilst Zr does not have such an effect. The CuZnAl catalysts are composed of Al2O3 instead of ZrO2 and exhibit better interaction between Cu-species and ZnO–Al2O3 (XRD results). Moreover, Al2O3 exhibited a stronger hydrophilic character than ZrO2, which promotes the formation of a wide range of CO2 reduction products, including alcohols. The presence of ZrO2 in the CuO–ZnO system could decrease the Cu coordination with O to increase the Cu–O distance, which forms defective Cu structures and it is also important to note that the crystallinity of ZrO2 influences the CuO–ZrO2 interactions.51 Thus, the presence of ZrO2 enhances the synergistic effect of CuO–ZnO and ZrO2, which could accommodate the dissociative adsorption of CO2 and selective CO2 conversion. The major contributing factor for CuO–ZnO–ZrO2 catalysts seems to be associated with the reduced Zr3+ species at the CuO/ZnO interface, being able to adsorb reaction intermediates such as formate species in a way to facilitate selective CO2 conversion.52
The literature reports clearly indicate that copper-based catalysts with different sizes produce different products.53 The hydrocarbons and oxygenates were the main products with Cu nanoparticles larger than 15 nm, whereas CO and H2 were the major products when small-size Cu particles (<3–6 nm) were used as catalysts. The electrocatalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts was affected by the size of CuO and ZnO crystallites, as the nanosized Cu-based catalysts showed better performance compared to the catalysts, which contained large-size Cu clusters (Table S4†). The nanosized CuZn-based catalysts exhibited a pronounced increase in the mesoporous nature, metallic surface area, active site dispersion, and selectivity,46,53 which contribute to the superior electrocatalytic activity. In the present study, the difference in the CuO and ZnO crystallite size of the as-synthesized catalysts (Table S2†) could explain the electrocatalytic activity and different selectivity of the synthesized catalysts. CuZnAl-700 exhibited superior performance, as it showed the lowest CuO and ZnO crystallite size among the synthesized catalysts. Moreover, it should be noted that the synthesized catalysts possessed small-size CuO crystallites, which produce a large number of CO2 reduction products, which is in good agreement with the previous literature reports. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts are responsible for the minor amounts of C2+ products observed in the synthesized catalyst samples.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a series of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 and CuO/ZnO/ZrO2 catalysts with a molar ratio of 0.675:0.275:0.05 were synthesized using the coprecipitation method by varying the calcination temperature (500 °C/600 °C/700 °C). The impact of calcination temperature on the phase structure, morphology, surface area, and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction was investigated. The CuZnZr-600 and CuZnAl-700 materials delivered better CO2R activity among all the investigated catalysts. The obtained electrocatalytic CO2R activity results have also been well corroborated with in-depth characterization results using different spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Such a characterization-driven approach is beneficial in understanding the structure–reactivity relationships and provides a rationalization for further improvement of the catalytic materials and process.
