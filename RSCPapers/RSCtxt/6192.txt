    , Accepted 14th August 2017First published on 14th August 2017AbstractGraphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a promising two-dimensional polymeric photocatalyst in the field of solar energy conversion. In the past few years many modifications of g-C3N4 have been studied extensively; however, the difficulty in obtaining detailed structural information both on its intrinsic covalent interactions and surrounding bonding environments largely restricts the rational design and development of inherent structure-controlled g-C3N4 based photocatalysts and fundamental understanding of their mechanistic operations. Herein, we demonstrate a high-pressure hydrogenation treatment method for g-C3N4 and introduce 1D 13C and 15N and 2D 15N Radio Frequency-driven Dipolar Recoupling (RFDR) solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying the structural information and surrounding hydrogen-bonding environment of treated g-C3N4 samples. The surface Brønsted base sites of g-C3N4 samples can be tuned systematically through changing the treatment conditions. We find that the terminal isolated –NH2 and the hydrogenated nitrogen species in treated g-C3N4 samples seem to be the origin of their improved activities for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and favor the enhancement of light harvesting and carrier transport. The as-prepared HCN400-4-2 sample treated at a pressure of 4 MPa and a temperature of 400 °C for 2 h in a hydrogen atmosphere displays the highest H2 evolution reaction (HER) activity, which is over 26 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4.
Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) fuel generated by sunlight-driven water splitting represents one of the most attractive sustainable strategies for renewable energy production and storage.1–3 Central to the ongoing research efforts is the exploitation of low-cost, stable, efficient and eco-friendly photocatalysts, which unfortunately remains a serious challenge.4,5 Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), with a unique graphitic π-conjugated stacked 2D structure and weak interlayer van der Waals forces, has emerged as an attractive metal-free class of photocatalysts because of its appealing tailorable electronic structure, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and environmentally friendly feature for the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER) and photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) under visible light.6–13 In the case of g-C3N4 based materials, they contain abundant Lewis acid and base sites, which are derived from the terminal and bridging NH-groups and lone pairs of N in triazine/heptazine rings, respectively, that are potential anchoring sites for cocatalysts as well as adsorption sites for small molecules.14,15 These sites can also act as exciton dissociation traps which favor the fast splitting of light-generated excitons and facilitate the formation of hydrogen adatom centers, thus promoting catalytic kinetics for (photo)chemical transformation.16 In this regard, generating surface microenvironments with specific Brønsted base sites would provide new insights into creating highly activated g-C3N4 for the efficient conversion of solar energy.
Past efforts on addressing these issues in improving the H2 evolution activity of g-C3N4 are mainly concentrated on the texturization of g-C3N4 to increase its surface area and hence enhance the exposure of its Brønsted base sites, i.e. terminal amino (–NH2) and planar amino defects.17,18 Organic incorporation, inorganic dopants or surface treatments are often employed to increase the planar amino defects.19,20 However, the common disadvantages of most of these strategies are as follows: (1) the difficulty in distinguishing the kind and content of the inherently existing nitrogen species; (2) the technical challenge of obtaining detailed information on the weak interactions surrounding the terminal isolated –NH2 and binding –NH2 of g-C3N4 excluding the theoretical simulation; and (3) the intrinsic structure of g-C3N4 is hard to fine-tune systematically due to the uncontrollable high thermal polycondensation process. All of these deficiencies largely restrict our fundamental understanding and the rational design of these two dimensional (2D) polymeric photocatalysts. To this end, a clear identification of the Brønsted base sites, especially the intrinsic structure and surrounding weak interactions of g-C3N4, and at the same time rational tuning of these Brønsted base active moieties would help us to understand the origin of the improved activity of these g-C3N4 based materials, and then transfer these concepts to the material design, modification and improvements.
Herein, we report the application of Brønsted base chemistry to the rational design of surface active sites for g-C3N4. Through the combination of a high-pressure hydrogenation (HPH) treatment method and 1D 13C and 15N and 2D 15N RFDR solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy, the surface Brønsted base site structures of g-C3N4 can be tuned and identified. Such hydrogenation treatment of g-C3N4 (HCNx-y-z; x is the temperature, y is the pressure and z is the reaction time) provides a regular change of its intrinsic structure and photocatalytic activity when we change the treatment pressure, temperature and processing time separately. It is found that the as-prepared HCNx-y-z samples treated at a pressure of 4 MPa and a temperature of 400 °C for 2 h in a hydrogen atmosphere display the highest H2 evolution reaction (HER) activity, which is over 26 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (CN). Our work demonstrates that the terminal isolated –NH2 and the hydrogenated nitrogen species seem to be the origin of the improved activity of g-C3N4 (Scheme 1B); meanwhile, changing the hydrogen-bonding environment around –NH2 moieties and increasing the number of inherently hydrogenated nitrogen species play crucial roles in enhancing the HER properties.

Results and discussion
The HCNx-y-z samples were prepared by the procedure shown in Scheme 1A. The solid pristine CN (0.5 g) was first milled into powder in a mortar and then sealed into a Sievert's apparatus (Suzuki Shokan PCT H2 Absorption Rig). After degassing for 1 h in the PCT reactor, the CN powder was hydrogenated under a certain pressure (0 to 6 MPa) of H2 atmosphere at a temperature between 200 and 500 °C for 1 to 6 h. Compared with the light yellow pristine CN, the as-prepared HCNx-y-z samples' colour changes from light yellow to khaki with increasing treatment pressure, temperature or time (Scheme 1A). The detailed treatment conditions of the as-prepared HCNx-y-z samples in this study are summarized in Table 1. During the whole treatment process, hydrogen is the only introduced element. Therefore, the modified structural sites are all introduced Brønsted base sites.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all HCNx-y-z samples as a function of different treatment pressures, temperatures and times are given in Fig. 1A, S1 and S2.† When compared to the pristine CN sample, an overall decrease in the intensity of the signal and peak broadening between (100) and (002) reflections is observed for HCNx-y-z samples prepared with increasing the treatment pressure from 0.5 to 4 MPa (Fig. 1A). This may result from the reduced structural correlation length, distorted nitride pores and the changed outer ring environment.21,22 Some crystalline small molecule peaks appear in the sample treated at 6 MPa. This is an indication of the onset of decomposition of the CN, which may be attributed to the altered local parking motifs, and the complete decomposition of the framework of CN.8 Similar changing trends can also be observed in HCNx-y-z samples as a function of different treatment temperatures and times (Fig. S1 and S2†). As can be seen from Table 1, the C/N molar ratio of HCNx-y-z samples increases gradually with increased treatment pressure, temperature and time. The loss of nitrogen atoms may be caused by some of the lattice N and terminal –NH2 being reduced to NH3 in the thermal hydrogen reduction atmosphere.23 The surface areas of HCNx-y-z samples are around 10 to 20 m2 g−1, close to that of bulk CN (16.36 m2 g−1), indicating that the HPH treatment will not distinctly change the surface areas of CN. According to the TEM images (Fig. S3†), no obvious changes can be found between CN and HCN400-4-2 samples, and slightly decreased sizes can be found for the HCN500-4-2 sample. However, the BET data for CN, HCN400-4-2 and HCN500-4-2 samples were 16.36, 18.77 and 13.89 m2 g−1, respectively, which means that the slightly decreased sizes of HCN500-4-2 observed did not contribute to the increase of the BET of the samples.
 Fig. 1  (A) XRD patterns and (B) UV-vis spectra of CN and HCN400-y-2 (y = 0.5, 2, 4 and 6) samples treated by different pressures at 400 °C for 2 h. 
As apparent from the optical absorption spectra of all samples (Fig. 1B, S4 and S5†), the HPH treatment obviously modifies the π-electron delocalization in the conjugated system when the temperature reaches 400 °C, which, in turn, changes the intrinsic optical/electronic properties of the HCN400-4-2, HCN500-4-2 and HCN400-y-z samples. By increasing the treatment pressure at 400 °C (Fig. 1B), a remarkable red shift of the optical absorption from 440 nm to 800 nm was observed, and the corresponding bandgaps decreased from 2.79 eV to 2.25 eV. As a result, a wider portion of the solar spectrum can be covered since the absorbance wavelength range extends to 800 nm.
We then mainly focused on three representative samples, i.e., CN, HCN400-4-2 and HCN500-4-2, which reveal three typical structures (according to XRD and C/N molar ratios) and the corresponding testing performances. The specific bonding and structural changes among the three samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A similar tendency is observed for the C 1s (Fig. S6†) and N 1s (Fig. S7†) signals for the CN and HCN400-4-2 samples, except for a slight shift of the strong peak to a lower binding energy. This can be explained by the change of the local chemical environment, which is associated with the variation of the coordination number.24 For the HCN500-4-2 sample, the peak shape and intensity for the C 1s and N 1s show large differences compared with the CN sample, suggesting an entirely decomposed framework. These results are in fairly good accordance with the XRD results. However, from the results discussed above, no clear information on structural variation between CN and HCN400-4-2 can be distinguished from XPS.
For a deeper insight into the structures of these samples, subsequently, we introduce a solid-state NMR experiment to investigate the structures of the typical samples. Fig. 2A shows the 1H–13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of the three representative HCNx-y-z samples. In the spectra, signals ranging from 150 ppm to 160 ppm are assigned to heptazine carbon (CN3) and signals ranging from 160 ppm to 170 ppm are assigned to amine-bearing carbons (CN2(NHx)).9,25 The 1H–13C CP process ensures that these 13C signals are mainly from the groups spatially close to the 1H spins. In the CN samples, the 1H spins are only present in the amine groups, which are located in the edges of the lamellae and the defects of the lamellae. Therefore, the 13C signals in the spectra are actually from the structures in the edges of the lamellae and the defects of the lamellae. The large width of the signals indicates that structures in the lamellar edges and the defects are disordered, that is, surrounded by some weak interactions. After the HPH treatment, the signals show a clear change in the line-shape. This indicates that the HPH treatment has changed the populations and the local hydrogen-bonding environments of the CN2(NH) and CN2(NH2) groups in the samples. Meanwhile, the degree of order improved, indicating that some ripple structures have been flattened by HPH cleavage of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

(B) Solid-state 1H–15N cross polarization under magic angle spinning NMR spectra of CN, HCN400-4-2 and HCN500-4-2 samples; the cross polarization time was 3 s. (C) 2D 15N RFDR spectra of CN, HCN400-4-2 and HCN500-4-2 samples. The 13C and 15N chemical shifts were calibrated using adamantane and L-alanine, respectively. 
Note that the local environments of the CN2(NH) and CN2(NH2) groups in these CN samples are very complicated and most likely related to the packing of the graphene-like lamellae and the hydrogen bonding between the amine groups. However, the 13C spectra in Fig. 2A alone provide only limited information on the structures in the local environments of the CN2(NH) and CN2(NH2) groups. To gain a deeper understanding of the local environments of the CN2(NH) and CN2(NH2) groups in the samples, 15N NMR spectra of the samples were then investigated.
The 15N NMR signal intensity is proportional to the abundance of 15N spins in the sample. The natural 15N abundance of the samples is around 0.1%. To increase the abundance of 15N in the samples, we synthesized these CN and HCNx-y-z samples using a 15N double-labelled precursor. Fig. 2B shows the 1H–15N CP/MAS spectra of the 15N enriched CN and HCNx-y-z samples. Similar to the 1H–13C CP/MAS NMR spectra, the 15N signals in these spectra are from the 1H–15N CP step and thus can be attributed to the amine groups located at the edges and the planar defects of the lamellae. According to the literature, we tentatively assign the signals (A) in the range of −154 to −203 ppm to the ring nitrogen of the heptazine ring (–N), the signals (B) at −220 ppm to the central nitrogen (–N〈), the signal (C) at −240 ppm to the bridging NH groups, and the signals (D) between −250 and −300 ppm to the NH2 groups.26–28
Interestingly, after the HPH treatment, the signals, A and B, show a significant right shift as well as a clear decrease in the signal intensity and the peak width. It is considered to be a good indication of the decrease of the size of the ab plane of the lamellae which corresponds to the cleavage of the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding network.29–31 For the signals from the NHx groups (i.e., C and D), the signal resolution increases obviously after the HPH treatment. Moreover, the signal intensity ratio between the NH and NH2 groups decreases dramatically after the HPH treatment. This indicates that accompanying the decrease of the size of the ab plane of the lamellae, the population of the NH2 groups in the samples also increases dramatically after the HPH treatment.32,33
To gain further insight into the spatial distribution of the amine groups in the samples, 2D 15N RFDR experiments were conducted on the samples. Fig. 2C shows the 2D 15N RFDR spectra of the samples. In the spectrum of the CN sample, no cross peaks can be observed, indicating the absence of the close through-space contact between the 15N sites in this sample. After a medium HPH treatment (HCN400-4-2), it is interesting to see that there is a clear cross peak between the heptazine ring (–N) and the NH2 groups. The appearance of the cross peak indicates the spatial proximity between the heptazine ring (–N) and the NH2 groups. It is noted that the position of the 15N sites in the lamellae remains unchanged, so the cross peak is possibly caused by the adjacent lamellar stacking. However, from the XRD patterns, we could not find an obvious change of the inter-layer stacking reflection. Thus, we can deduce that the adjacent lamellar stacking is formed by cleaving the hydrogen-bonding of the rippled CN. To further confirm this, Raman spectra were obtained using UV excitation (514 nm). In the Raman spectra (Fig. 3A) within the range of 1000–2000 cm−1 for the CN and HCN400-4-2 samples, there are two peaks observed at 1314 cm−1 (D band) and 1561 cm−1 (G band). The G band is attributed to graphite-like sp2 microdomains in the samples, while the D band corresponds to disordered sp2 microdomains introduced by linking with N atoms.34,35 Compared with CN, no significant difference can be found. However, the peak at 986 cm−1, which is ascribed to the symmetric N-breathing mode of heptazine and/or triazine units as well as the rippled structures, decreases dramatically after the HPH treatment.36,37 This indicates that the decreasing size of the ab plane and the weakened hydrogen-bonding phenomenon lead to the deterioration of the symmetric structure.

The C K-edge XANES spectra of the CN, HCN400-4-2 and HCN500-4-2 samples can provide additional evidence for the change in the structures. As can be seen from Fig. 3B, all the samples exhibit two distinct peaks at around 288 (A) and 294 eV (B), which are characteristic of the sp2-bonded heptazine carbon and the interlayer states or transitions to sp3 hybridized states, respectively. In addition, an obvious shoulder can be observed at around 287.2 eV, which is assigned to the hydrogenated carbon (C–H).23,38 This result suggests the formation of a lot of C–H structures, and also significant reduction of heptazine carbon in the HCN500-4-2 samples. As a result, the crystallinity and framework of C4N are destroyed in the HCN500-4-2 sample, but no obvious covalent bond change of CN and HCN400-4-2 can be found from the C K-edge XANES spectra. Based on these results, we can conclude that the HPH treatment has the ability to tailor the surface Brønsted base sites of CN in a more controlled way via breaking the HNH⋯NH2 hydrogen bonds or transforming NH into NH2 which leads to a decreased near-field ab plane, and ultimately, destruction of the entire framework.
The photocatalytic reactions were performed under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm, Xe lamp) with 10 vol% triethanolamine as an electron donor in 100 mL pure water, containing a 30 mg or 100 mg HCNx-y-z sample loaded with 3 wt% Pt as a cocatalyst. Fig. 4A shows the HER of various HCNx-y-z samples treated for different times and pressures. The HER of HCNx-y-z samples is closely related to the corresponding treatment conditions and the HCN400-4-2 sample presents the highest activity, over 26 times higher than that of bulk CN. Further extending (or enhancing) the treatment time (or pressure), however, decreases the activities of HCNx-y-z samples. Similar trend can also be found in HCNx-y-z samples with different treatment temperatures (Fig. S8†), and the HCN500-4-2 sample shows nearly no photocatalytic activity.

The catalyst loading in all cases was 100 mg; (C) absorption spectrum and the rate of H2 formation as a function of band-pass filter wavelength for HCN400-4-2 loaded with 3 wt% Pt; (D) the AQY for the HCN400-4-2 sample under single-wavelength light irradiation from 365 nm to 550 nm, and the corresponding light intensity. 
In order to exclude the possible absorption of hydrogen during HPH treatment, the HCN400-4-2 sample was gradually heated in a Thermogravimetric Analysis-Mass Spectrometer (TGA-MS) analyser and the gas signals (including H2, NH3 and cyano fragments) were traced and recorded. As can be seen from Fig. 5B, the HCN400-4-2 sample shows a similar thermal stability compared to the CN sample and no obvious weight loss is observed until the temperature is higher than 420 °C.39 The signals of monitored trace gases (H2, NH3 and N2) remain unchanged up to 600 °C (the drastic decomposition temperature of CN based materials), indicating that the observed H2 production in the photocatalytic reactions results from the photocatalytic process. The stability of HCN400-4-2 was evaluated by eight consecutive operations and over 3.6 mol of H2 gas was produced during the period. As shown in Fig. 4B, the HER is almost constant with prolonged photoirradiation. A slight deactivation of the HER can be observed after 20 h of illumination, which is attributed to the decreased concentration of triethanolamine (TEOA). After compensating for the consumption of TEOA, the HER regained immediately, indicating that the HCN400-4-2 sample stably produces H2 without the loss of activity under constant irradiation. It should also be noted that the HER of the HCN400-4-2 sample under full range light irradiation (Xe lamp) is 2 times higher than that under visible light irradiation. Fig. 4C shows the action spectrum of H2 evolution on the sample determined by monochromated light irradiation. The HER result agrees well with the absorption spectrum of the HCN400-4-2 sample, suggesting that photo-induced electrons in HCN400-4-2 primarily drive the H2 production. The apparent quantum yields (ΦAQY) at 365 nm and 420 nm are determined to be 15% and 5%, respectively (Fig. 4D). This efficiency is comparable to the highest levels obtained by powder dispersion water splitting photocatalysis systems,40 suggesting that the HPH treated HCNx-y-z samples have the potential to be a series of inexpensive, green and sustainable photocatalysts for artificial solar-to-chemical energy conversion. The photocurrent generation of CN and HCN400-4-2 samples was investigated during on/off illumination cycles at 0.6 V (Fig. S9†). Upon light irradiation, a typical n-type photocurrent was produced, suggesting the generation and separation of photoinduced e−–h− pairs at CN/water interfaces. When the irradiation was interrupted, the photocurrent returned to the original value once light was switched back on again. The transient photocurrent density of HCN400-4-2 is more than 15 μA cm−2, whereas that of the CN is just about 7.5 μA cm−2. As for the HCN400-4-2, the intrinsic drawback of fast charge recombination has been addressed, and a better photocatalytic performance can be expected.

The energetic positions of the valence and conduction band edges of HCNx-y-z samples can be determined by using band gaps (Fig. 5A) obtained from UV-visible absorption spectra (Table 1, Fig. S10 to S13†) and Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S14 to S17†). As can be seen from Fig. 5A and Table 1, the band gap of HCNx-y-z decreases with increased pressure, temperature and processing time, consistent with the UV-visible absorption result. Thus, the improved optical absorption can be attributed to the fine-tuning of the surface Brønsted base sites of CN. Fig. 5A displays the specific band structure of the CN and HCN400-y-2 (y = 0.5, 2, 4 and 6) samples. Increasing the treatment pressure, a downshift of the conduction band can be found. This represents an excellent tool to finely tune the band gap structure of CN based photocatalysts.
Furthermore, the charge carrier separation/recombination rates of HCNx-y-z samples were investigated using photoluminescence (PL) spectra at room temperature (Fig. 5C inset and Fig. S18 to S20†). Fig. S20† shows a greatly suppressed CN and the emission peak gradually shifts toward shorter wavelengths with continuously increased treatment pressure when the HPH temperature is 400 °C. In addition, evident fluorescence quenching is also observed, and the strongest shift occurs for the HCN400-4-2 sample. It is also worth noting that no emission peak can be found for the HCN500-4-2 sample, indicating that the framework is heavily damaged when the hydrogenation temperature reaches 500 °C.
Since time-resolved fluorescence (TRPL) measurements provide more information than is available from the steady-state PL data, we measured the emission-decay behaviors of the CN and HCN400-4-2 samples by using a single photon counting setup (Fig. 5C). These emission traces were analyzed using biexponential decay kinetics, which were found to be satisfactory in determining emission lifetimes. The lifetime data were processed according to the literature method.41 Decay in the fluorescence intensity (I) with time (t) was fitted by a biexponential function: I = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(1)where τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes of shorter- and longer-lived species, respectively, and A1 and A2 are their respective amplitudes. The weighted mean lifetime τ was calculated according to eqn (2): τ = (A1τ1 + A2τ2)/(A1 + A2)(2)
The lifetime and its fractional contribution are summarized in Table 2. In accordance with the steady-state PL spectra (inset in Fig. 5C), the fluorescence lifetimes τ decreased from 8.01 ns for the CN to 1.30 ns for the HPH treated HCN400-4-2 sample. This suggests that the TRPL spectra of the sample contain independent emissions from the segments of different π-conjugation lengths.42 This result demonstrates that HPH treatment can alter the aggregation structure and the π-electron delocalization in the conjugated system. Besides, the two samples show different predominant pathways, the CN sample mainly decays through the second pathway (A2 = 87.76%), while HCN400-4-2 decays via the first pathway (A1 = 89.18%). The quenching of the emission intensity and lifetime indicates that the relaxation of the HCN400-4-2 excitons occurs via different paths, presumably by the carrier transfer and they localize to new states which were formed during the HPH treatment.43,44

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a HPH treatment method for g-C3N4 and introduced 2D SSNMR spectroscopy for identifying the systematically tuned surface Brønsted base site structure and surrounding hydrogen-bonding environment of treated g-C3N4 samples. The proposed method results in a regular change in their optical properties together with a significant enhancement of their photocatalytic activities, while maintaining the surface area of the original g-C3N4. Based on the 1D 13C and 15N and 2D 15N RFDR SSNMR spectra, the structures of both surface Brønsted base sites and hydrogen-bonding network induced by –NH2 moieties can be clearly distinguished, allowing the rational design of a much broader set of g-C3N4 with controlled structures. As a consequence of the combination of the structural information of HPH treated samples and their corresponding photocatalytic activities, the terminal isolated –NH2, the hydrogen-bonding environment around –NH2 moieties and the number of inherently hydrogenated nitrogen species were found to play significant roles in enhancing the HER properties under visible light. The as-prepared HCN400-4-2 sample treated at a pressure of 4 MPa and a temperature of 400 °C for 2 h in a hydrogen atmosphere displayed the highest H2 evolution reaction (HER) activity, 26 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4. The apparent quantum yields (ΦAQY) at 365 nm and 420 nm were determined to be 15% and 5%, respectively, which were comparable to the highest levels obtained by powder dispersion water splitting photocatalysis systems. The experimental and mechanistic insights obtained from this work present the conceptual framework and an approach for engineering high-performance organic and polymeric catalysts for solar-energy conversion.
Methods
Catalyst preparation
Pure CN was prepared by a facile thermal treatment of dicyandiamide. Typically, 2 g of dicyandiamide powder was put into a covered crucible, and then heated at a rate of 5 °C min−1 to reach a temperature of 550 °C and maintained at this temperature in air for 4 h. The yellow product obtained was then thoroughly ground using a pestle and mortar before further analysis and applications. The HCNx-y-z samples were prepared by hydrogenation of the CN sample at different pressures, temperatures and processing times. The hydrogenation treatment was carried out by using a Sievert's apparatus (Suzuki Shokan PCT H2 Absorption Rig). The CN powder was degassed for 1 h in a PCT reactor and then hydrogenated under a certain pressure (0 to 6 MPa) of H2 atmosphere at a temperature between 200 and 500 °C for 1 to 6 h.
Materials characterization
The structures of the as-prepared CN and HCNx-y-z samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advanced Diffractometer operating with Cu Kα radiation, the angular range was 5–65° with a speed of 3° min−1), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (USA Thermo ESCALAB 250), UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis) (CARY 300), elemental analysis (EA) (vario EL II, Germany), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) (Edinburgh Instruments, FLSP 920), time-resolved fluorescence (TRPL) (PTI QM-4) and InVia Raman microscopy (Raman) (InVia Reflex). All binding energies obtained from XPS were corrected by using the C 1s peak (284.8 eV) arising from surface hydrocarbons or possible adventitious hydrocarbon as a reference. The Raman spectra were recorded using 514 nm laser excitation. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of CN and HCNx-y-z samples were investigated by using a TriStar 3020 nitrogen sorption isotherm apparatus. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement was carried out on an HTG-1 instrument (Beijing Hengjiu Scientific Instruments). The sample was heated to 900 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The carbon and nitrogen K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) of the CN, HCN400-4-2 and HCN500-4-2 samples was determined at the beamline 4B7B of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF).
Solid-state NMR spectroscopy
All of the 13C and 15N solid-state NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE III 600 WB spectrometer operating at 600.44 MHz for 1H. A 4 mm double resonance MAS probe was used for the 13C and 15N experiments. The spinning rate was set to 8–10 kHz. In the 1H–13C cross polarization under magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) experiment, the cross polarization time was 3 ms. In the 2D 15N RFDR experiment, the mixing time was 50 ms and the MAS speed was 10 kHz. The 13C and 15N chemical shifts were calibrated using adamantane (δ = 38.5 ppm) and L-alanine (δ = −290.7 ppm, indirectly referenced to nitromethane), respectively.
Photocatalytic experiments
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction experiments were performed and studied as follows: the as-obtained CN and HCNx-y-z samples were loaded with 3 wt% Pt and calcined at 180 °C for 30 min with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. The H2 evolution analysis was performed by dispersing 30 mg or 100 mg of CN and HCNx-y-z powders in an aqueous solution containing triethanolamine (100 mL, 10 vol%) as the sacrificial electron donor. After the ultrasonic treatment, the reactant solution was evacuated several times to remove air completely before the reaction.
All photocatalytic experiments were carried out using a 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter. The photoreactor was stirred and kept at 20 °C with continuous water circulation during the light irradiation. The amount of H2 evolved was analyzed by gas chromatography (TECHCOMP, 7890 II).
Determination of apparent quantum yields (AQY)
The quantum efficiency (ΦAQY) was estimated by the method described previously using the equation: ΦAQY (%) = (2 × H/I) × 100%, where H represents the number of evolved H2 molecules and I represents the number of incident photons absorbed by the CN and HCNx-y-z catalysts. The number of incident photons was measured using a light power meter.
Mott–Schottky experiments
Mott–Schottky measurements were performed with a Parstat 2273 workstation. The CN and HCNx-y-z electrodes were fabricated as follows. The electrode was prepared on fluoride doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass. First, the FTO conducting glasses were cleaned by sonication in ethanol and acetone for 10 min. Second, the electrode slurry was prepared by mixing 50 mg of catalyst powder, 1 mL of distilled water and 0.1 mL of Liquion solution in a mortar and pestle. The resulting uniform slurry was then injected onto the FTO glass, the sides of which were previously covered with scotch tape and the exposed area was 0.785 cm2. Then, the electrodes were dried at 120 °C for 30 min in air to improve adhesion. The electrochemical performance of the electrodes was tested with a three electrode cell in an aqueous 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, where the prepared CN or HCNx-y-z acts as a working electrode with an Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference and Pt mesh as a counter electrode. The working electrodes were immersed in the electrolyte for 60 s before any measurements were taken.
