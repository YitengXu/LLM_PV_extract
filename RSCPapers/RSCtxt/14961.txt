    , Accepted 26th April 2021First published on 28th April 2021AbstractDFT-based simulations were executed to investigate the electronic structures and optical constants of ZnS, CdS, CdSe and CdTe nanowires (NWs). It was observed that all these pristine NWs had wide direct bandgaps and would find applications only in the synthesis of semiconductor lasers and LEDs. These NWs were further incorporated into ZnS/CdX (X = S, Se, Te) core/shell (c/s) configurations and it was observed that the ZnS/CdS c/s NW still had a wide bandgap that was of the direct type. However, in the cases of the ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs, the bandgaps were dramatically narrowed and were of the indirect type. The indirect bandgaps of the ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs were found to be near to the indirect bandgap of silicon and, therefore, were found to be potential alternatives for devising next-generation terrestrial micro- and nano-photovoltaic devices. The partial density of states (PDOS) and total density of states (TDOS) for all pristine and c/s NWs were also studied. It was observed that the Shockley-Quessier (SQ) efficiencies of c/s NWs were dramatically greater than the efficiencies of pristine NWs, owing to the truncated bandgaps. The ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs showed SQ efficiencies of 32.97% and 33.59%, respectively. In comparison, the CdSe NW had an efficiency of 20.38%, which is the highest for the pristine NWs included in the study, while the ZnS NW showed a meagre 6.24% efficiency. Subsequently, the optical properties, within the random phase approximation (RPA) of pristine and c/s NWs were investigated and compared.
1. Introduction

Iijima, in 1994, took the fraternity of nanoscience and condensed matter researchers by a storm when his group successfully synthesized carbon nanotubes (CNTs).1 This achievement found itself amidst the gasping attention of both the laymen and the connoisseurs of the field. It was an epoch-making feat and had a snowball effect as far as the syntheses, modelings and studies of CNTs and other similar one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures are concerned. Since then, many different types of nanowires (NWs) have come to the fore. Of these, group II–VI semiconducting NWs have been studied in great depth in the last two or three decades for the fabrication of new optoelectronic devices, ascribed to their better optoelectronic properties as compared to their bulk counterparts.2–9 Specifically, semiconducting core/shell (c/s) NWs have garnered great research interest as they manifest fascinating characteristics, viz., adjustable bandgap, wide-spanned absorption spectra, quantum transportation, exceptional photoluminescence, etc.10,11
Of late, it has been realized that the ability to form uniform c/s NW arrays of group II–VI semiconductors, with a check on the shell thickness, is a pivotal step in the direction of more efficient NW solar cells.12 The fabrication of such c/s NWs of the group II–VI semiconductors by employing methods such as SILAR, CSS, and CVD, has widely been reported in the past few years.12–16 In 2005, Wu et al. declared the successful synthesis of ZnS/CdSe c/s NWs by CVD, assisted by pulsed laser ablation, and NWs were grown along the [0001] direction in the hexagonal wurtzite (WZ) form.17 Tak et al. synthesized similar ZnO/CdS c/s NWs on a large scale on various substrates, employing the SILAR technique.12 The successful syntheses of such c/s structures stand experimentally as substantial evidence in favour of the stabilities of c/s NWs studied in the present work. Also, in the last couple of years, it has been observed that the group II–VI c/s NWs have exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiencies, enhanced photodetector capabilities, better piezoelectric characteristics, and enhanced gas sensing abilities as compared to their bare counterparts.18–27 Apart from this, in 2018, Rehman et al. suggested that the ZnS/CdSe c/s NWs are more stable than the CdSe/ZnS c/s NWs, based on their DFT-based calculations.28 Gao et al. carried out theoretical investigations of various c/s structures, including CdSe/ZnS and CdTe/ZnS, and suggested that introducing various cores over a shell can present an opportunity for tuning the bandgaps of the materials, depending upon the thickness of the shell and the core diameter.29 However, a comprehensive comparative analysis of the c/s NWs with respect to their exhibiting supremacy over their bare (pristine) counterparts has been lacking, both theoretically and experimentally. Hence, in the present work, our motive is to compare and showcase the supremacy, if any, of the c/s ZnS/CdS, ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe NWs over the pristine NWs as far as their applications in photovoltaics are concerned.
Group II–VI semiconductor crystals occur in two allotropic forms, viz., a cubic form with the zinc blende (ZB) structure and a hexagonal form with the wurtzite (WZ) structure.30 In the present work, the NWs of the WZ type are modeled and studied exclusively. The structure and electronic properties of the WZ type NWs, viz., ZnS, CdS, CdSe and CdTe are studied and an attempt to fine-tune the electronic bandgaps in order to improve the SQ efficiency of these NWs is made by incorporating these NWs into core/shell configurations. For this, the structures and electronic properties of fully optimized ZnS/CdS, ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs were investigated with the help of first principles-based DFT calculations. Apart from the structural properties, electronic properties, SQ efficiencies and some of the optical properties of the above-mentioned NWs are also analyzed.
2. Computational minutiae
Geometry optimization and the electronic structure and optical property calculations were performed using the SIESTA package.31 The numerical orbital basis with double zeta polarization (DZP) was employed throughout the calculations. Troullier-Martin norm-conserving pseudopotentials were utilized for treating the electron-ion interactions.32 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA), within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) parametrization, was employed to treat the exchange and correlation energies for the electron-electron interactions handled within.33 The periodicity of all the NWs was kept along the Z-direction and a vacuum of around 10 Å each was established in both the X- and Y-directions to curb the interactions between the adjoining NW images. Implementing the conjugate gradients (CG) method,34 the unit cells of all the NWs were optimized until the forces on each atom were lower than 0.01 eV Å−1. The irreducible Brillouin zone was sampled with a 1 × 1 × 20 k-points grid, as suggested by Monkhorst and Pack.35 The electronic bands were calculated along the Z–Γ–Z direction. Also, the partial density of states (PDOS) and total density of states (TDOS) were calculated within the range of −6 eV and +6 eV. The efficiencies η of these NWs were also computed using the SQ limit method. The optical matrix elements were calculated, together with the corrections owing to the non-locality of the pseudopotential.36 Some optical properties, like the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant, refractive index, extinction coefficient, absorption coefficient and reflectance for both the pristine and c/s NWs, were computed within the framework of the random phase approximation (RPA).37–39 The complex dielectric function was written as ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + jε2(ω); where .40ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function, respectively. ε2(ω) can be calculated by the summation over the electronic states and ε1(ω) is calculated using the Kramers–Kronig relations.41,42 The optical properties of the NWs were computed along three different optical vectors, namely, (1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0, 0.0) and (0.0, 0.0, 1.0), with the respective optical meshes of 10 × 1 × 1, 1 × 10 × 1 and 1 × 1 × 10.
3. Structural properties and stability
The pristine ZnS, CdS, CdSe and CdTe NWs, as well as the ZnS/CdS, ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs are fully optimized (see Fig. 1). Table 1 shows the diameters ‘d’ and the lengths of the unit cell in the Z-direction ‘c’ for all the NWs. The values of the lattice parameter ‘c’ for the pristine ZnS, CdS and CdTe NWs seem to agree with the experimental values of 6.301 Å, 6.7365 Å and 7.50 Å, respectively.17,43,44 The lattice parameter ‘c’ of 6.62 Å matches well with the work by Mandal et al. in the case of ZnS/CdS c/s NW.45 It is interesting to note from Table 1 that there is a sudden dip in the lattice parameter ‘c’ in the case of ZnS/CdSe c/s NW. The reason for that might be the lattice parameter mismatch between ZnS and CdSe. As a result of the contraction of lattice parameter ‘c’, the lattice parameter a = b increases from 23.84 Å in the case of ZnS/CdS c/s NW to 26.54 Å in the case of the ZnS/CdSe c/s NW. As a consequence of this, as seen in Fig. 1(f), the selenium atoms shift along the Z-axis and become arranged in the same XY-plane as that of the cadmium atoms, pushing out the zinc atoms of the core along the Z-axis. This slight rearrangement of the atoms would explain the shrinkage of the lattice parameter ‘c’ in the case of the ZnS/CdSe c/s NW. However, the value of this lattice parameter ‘c’ in the case of ZnS/CdSe c/s NW is slightly lower than the same predicted by Rehman et al.28 However, this variation could be attributed to the fact that they have employed the plane-wave (PW). It is well known that GGA overestimates the lattice parameters. Moreover, it has been observed that GGA and LDA calculations tend to have discrepancies in the estimation of lattice parameters and bandgaps, due to self-interaction errors. These anomalies may be further intensified in the case of transition metal complexes having highly localized d and f orbitals. Hybrid functionals like HSE06 can solve the issue but on the downside, they would significantly increase the computational cost.

The pristine NWs have 24 group-II atoms (Zn, Cd) and 24 group-VI atoms (S, Se, Te). The c/s NWs have 6 Zn atoms and 6 S atoms, making up the cores, along with 12 atoms each of Cd and group-VI (S, Se, Te) making up the shells. Here ‘d’ represents the diameter of the NWs and ‘c’ represents the length of the unit cell of the NWs along the Z-axis.

For further verification of the stability of the NWs, the cohesive energies per atom Ecoh for each of the fully optimized NWs are calculated using the given formula:46 (1)where ENW is the total energy of the NW, ni is the number of atoms of the species i in a given NW, and Ei is the free energy of the isolated atom of the ith species. Here, N is the total number of atoms in the NW.
The cohesive energies per atom of each of the NWs are shown in Table 1. The negative values of the cohesive energies for all the NWs are indicative of the fact that all of the NWs are stable and may be feasible for experimental synthesis. Also, for the c/s NWs, the formation enthalpies (FE) are calculated and shown in Table 1 using the formula47,48 (2)where, EZnS/CdX is the total energy of the ZnS/CdX c/s NW, m is the number of core atoms (i.e., 12 in this case) in the ZnS/CdX c/s NW, n is the number of shell atoms (i.e., 36 in this case) in the ZnS/CdX c/s NW, N = (m + n) is the number of atoms (i.e., 48 in this case) in the ZnS/CdX c/s NW, EZnS is the total energy of the optimized pristine ZnS NW, ECdX is the total energy of the optimized pristine CdX NW, and X = S, Se, Te. The lowest value of Φ* corresponds to the most stable NW.48 From Table 1, it is evident that ZnS/CdS c/s NW is the most stable NW and ZnS/CdTe NW is the least stable. However, the positive values of the formation enthalpies are evocative of the fact that the c/s NWs are comparatively less unfavorable for fabrication than the pristine NWs.48 Mandal et al. in their theoretical study showed that the stability of ZnS/CdS c/s NW was inversely dependent on the thickness of the CdS shell;45 therefore, keeping this prediction in mind, we kept the thickness of core and shell at comparable values.
4. Electronic properties
The electronic band structures of the pristine ZnS, CdS, CdSe, and CdTe NWs were calculated along the k-path of Z(0,0,1/2)–Γ(0,0,0)–Z(0,0,1/2). Also, the PDOS and TDOS of these NWs were calculated in the energy range of −6 eV to +6 eV. Fig. 2. shows the electronic band structures and the PDOS and TDOS of the pristine NWs. All the pristine NWs show direct bandgaps across the Γ point. In other words, it can be said that the lowest energy state within the conduction band (CB) and the highest energy state within the valence band (VB) have indistinguishable momenta. From Fig. 2, it can be easily seen that all the pristine NWs have bandgaps greater than 2 eV, suggesting that these NWs fall into the category of wide bandgap semiconducting materials.

Fig. 2 also shows the PDOS and TDOS of the pristine NWs. The p-orbitals of S, Se, and Te mostly dominate the contributions to the most prominent peak in the VB. The S-3p, S-3p, Se-4p and Te-5p states contribute to the high peaks observed at −2.14 eV, −1.47 eV, −1.32 eV and −1.67 eV respectively, in the VB of pristine ZnS, CdS, CdSe and CdTe NWs. There is also another prominent peak of the S-3p orbital in the DOS of the ZnS NW at −2.75 eV. For the ZnS NW, as seen in Fig. 2(b), there is hybridization between the S-3p, Zn-3d and Zn-4s orbitals at −4.99 eV and −5.30 eV. There are hints of sp-hybridization at −3.13 eV and −3.87 eV between Cd-5s and S-3p states in CdS NW, at −3.03 eV and −3.65 eV between Cd-5s and Se-4p states in CdSe NW, and at −3.36 eV and −3.96 eV between Cd-5s and Te-5p states in CdTe NW. In the CB, the PDOS diagrams suggest sp-hybridization at 2.96 eV, 3.44 eV, 3.78 eV and 4.13 eV in ZnS NW; at 3.33 eV, 4.27 eV and 5.28 eV in CdS NW; at 2.82 eV, 3.40 eV, 4.04 eV and 5.18 eV in CdSe NW; at 2.19 eV, 2.97 eV and 4.85 eV in CdTe NW. Table 2 shows the variations in the bandgaps of the ZnS, CdS, CdSe and CdTe pristine NWs along with the respective NW diameters and the bandgaps of the bulk counterparts of the pristine NWs. As already concluded above, the pristine NWs have bandgaps greater than 2 eV. However, in the case of converting solar energy via a single junction photovoltaic cell, the ideal bandgap has been widely conjectured to be in the range of around 1.0 eV to 1.5 eV.49 Hence, the electronic structures of the c/s configurations of these NWs were studied with a view to tuning the bandgaps for finding applications in micro- and nano-photovoltaic devices.

Fig. 3 illustrates the electronic band structures, PDOS and TDOS of the ZnS/CdS, ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs. Again, the band structures were calculated along the k-path of Z–Γ–Z and the DOS were plotted within the range of −6 eV to +6 eV. The ZnS/CdS c/s NW has a direct bandgap of 2.14 eV across the Γ-point, as seen in Fig. 3(a). It can be clearly recognized that the ZnS/CdS c/s NW falls into the category of wide bandgap semiconductor. Hence, as in the case of the pristine NWs, this NW would have relatively higher operation voltage and would also work well in extremely high temperatures. Also, the bandgap falls in the energy range of the visible spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Thus, the ZnS/CdS c/s NW would find applications in the fabrication of LEDs and also in the defense and aerospace industries. However, the ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs have indirect bandgaps of 1.48 eV and 1.14 eV, respectively from the Z-point to the Γ-point. This means that the valence band maxima (VBM) and the conduction band minima (CBM) are not on the same k-point in the case of ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs. In simpler words, the lowest energy state of the CB and the highest energy state in the VB, in the cases of these two c/s NWs, have distinct momenta.

Table 3 gives the variations in diameter and the nature of the bandgap (direct or indirect) for the c/s NWs. It can be seen that as we move from the CdS shell to the CdTe shell in the case of the c/s NWs, the NW diameter keeps on increasing and with that, the NW bandgap keeps on plummeting due to the quantum confinement effect resulting from the weakening of the binding energies of group VI elements (S > Se > Te); also, the nature of the bandgap shifts from the direct to the indirect bandgap. Moreover, the electronic bandgaps of the c/s NWs are a massive improvement as compared to their bare counterparts and also to other c/s NWs like Si/Ge and Ge/Si.55

Fig. 3 also shows the TDOS and PDOS of the c/s NWs. Most of the bands in the VB of the ZnS/CdS NW are dominated by the S-3p states, with the most prominent peak at −2.01 eV. There are sp-hybridizations between the Cd-5s and S-3p states at −3.49 eV and −4.17 eV. There may even be hybridization occurring at −5.32 eV between Zn-4s and S-3p orbitals. In the cases of ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs, the Se-4p and Te-5p orbitals, respectively, are mostly dominant in the VB. However, S-3p and Cd-5s states also contribute to the VB in both cases. The respective sharp peaks in the DOS of ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe at −1.23 eV and −0.76 eV are due to the Se-4p and Te-5p orbitals. At −3.21 eV, the peak in the ZnS/CdSe NW is due to the coalescing effect of S-3p and Se-3p states. Also, there is the possibility of sp-hybridizations between the 5s states of cadmium and 4p states of selenium at −4.13 eV, and a hint of sp-hybridization between the Zn-4s and S-3p states at −5.05 eV in the ZnS/CdSe NW. In the ZnS/CdTe NW, there seems to be hybridization between S-3p, Cd-5s, and Te-5p states at −4.03 eV. Also, the small peak at −5.13 eV in the ZnS/CdTe NW is the result of the hybridization between 4s states of zinc and 3p states of sulfur. The CB of the ZnS/CdS c/s NW is mostly dominated by the S-3p and Cd-5s states, with the peaks at 2.99 eV and 4.76 eV arising, possibly, due to the sp-hybridization of the S-3p and Cd-5s orbitals. There may be hybridizations among Zn-4s and S-3p states, and Cd-5s and S-3p states at 3.75 eV in the CB of the ZnS/CdS c/s NW. The CB of the ZnS/CdSe c/s NW is mostly contributed by Cd-5s and Se-4p orbitals, with their possible hybridizations at 1.36 eV, 2.75 eV, and 3.75 eV. Also, there is a hint of hybridization among Zn-4s and S-3p orbitals. The CB of the ZnS/CdTe c/s NW is mostly dominated by the Te-5p and Cd-5s orbitals, with probable hybridizations between them at 1.44 eV, 2.39 eV, 3.44 eV and 5.21 eV. Also, there is a hint of hybridization among the Zn-4s and S-3p orbitals at 3.44 eV.

Fig. 4 shows the variations in the VBM and CBM in the cases of both the pristine and c/s NWs. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4 that the c/s configurations of the NWs successfully managed to narrow down the bandgap. Also, the ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs have indirect bandgaps. This shrinkage of the bandgap in the c/s NWs could be ascribed to the intrinsic strain between the core and the shell atoms. A similar reason was cited by Peng et al. for the Si/Ge c/s NWs.55 In the present case, the reducing bandgaps are due to the shell effect because there is a major contribution of the Se-4p and Te-5p orbitals in the DOS, in close proximity to the Fermi energy level EF, in the cases of ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs, respectively, as can be seen in Fig. 3.

5. SQ efficiency
The photovoltaic cell efficiency of semiconducting materials proposed by Shockley and Quessier, also known as the SQ efficiency limit,56 is widely accepted for low-dimensional materials as well.57 The SQ limit depends on the bandgap Eg of the materials and gives A(E) = 1 for E ≥ Eg while A(E) = 0 for E < Eg.57,58 The theoretical short circuit current density Jsc is calculated using the following formula:58,59 (3)where e is the elementary charge and Isun(E) is the photon flux density as given in the AM1.5G spectrum.60 Likewise, the theoretical reverse saturation current J0 is written as59 (4)where Ibb(E,T) is the black body spectrum and the radiative recombination fraction, which is assumed to be unity.58 Now, the total current density is calculated using the formula61 (5)where k is the Boltzmann constant, V is the voltage over the absorber and T(∼300 K) is the temperature of the NW devices. The maximum power density Pm can be calculated from the maxima of the J–V curve, as seen in Fig. 5, taking the form P = JV. The solar cell efficiency η can be calculated by incorporating the above-used parameters, with the formula58 (6)where Pin(1000 W m−2) is the cumulative incident power density, taken from the AM1.5G solar irradiation.58,60
 Fig. 5  Calculated J–V characteristic curves and the corresponding power density curves at T ≈ 300 K for (a) pristine and (b) c/s NWs. 
The values of Jsc, Pm and η are displayed in Table 4. It can be easily seen that in general, the efficiencies of the c/s NWs are greater than the efficiencies of the pristine NWs. This is because the bandgaps of the c/s NWs are less than the bandgaps of the pristine NWs and the SQ efficiency is dependent upon the bandgap of the material. This can also be verified from the fact that the CdSe pristine and ZnS/CdS c/s NWs have identical SQ efficiencies, arising from their identical bandgaps of 2.14 eV. The ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs have the highest efficiency of 33.59% due to the narrowest bandgap among the NWs being discussed in this study. Even ZnS/CdSe c/s NWs have a very impressive efficiency of 32.97%. These efficiencies of 33.59% and 32.97% are significantly higher than the 30% efficiency of silicon solar cells, as calculated by Shockley and Quiesser in their original paper, employing 6000 K black-body approximation for the solar spectrum.56 Also, the SQ efficiencies of the ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs are pretty close to the maximum possible SQ efficiency limit of 33.7% in the case of a semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.34 eV.62 Hence, the solar cells fabricated by the proposed ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs may prove to have an upper hand over the traditionally used Si-based solar cells. Lead-based perovskite solar cells are widely cited to be the most efficient solar cells at conversion efficiencies up to about 25% but the high toxicity of lead is one of the vexing concerns for using such perovskites;63 therefore, the proposed c/s NWs vouch to be very viable alternatives to the lead-based perovskites. The only concern for using the c/s NWs included in this study may be the carcinogenic traits of cadmium. However, handling and working with cadmium-based substances is usually harmless, provided they are not accidentally ingested through the mouth or their fumes are not inhaled.64 To avoid the effects of cadmium toxicity, we may coat the c/s NWs with inert non-penetrating materials.

The real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric function are arrived at with the help of the RPA method as included in the SIESTA package. ε1x(ω) and ε2x(ω), ε1y(ω) and ε2y(ω), and ε1z(ω) and ε2z(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric functions, respectively. For each of the optical vectors, other optical constants like refractive index (R.I.) ni(ω), extinction co-efficient Ki(ω), reflectivity Ri(ω) and absorption co-efficient Ii(ω) are calculated using the following formulae:65 (7) (8) (9) (10)where εi(ω) = ε1i(ω) + jεi2(ω); ;  and; i = x, y, z.
The values of the optical constants are almost identical for the optical vectors (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) and (0.0, 1.0, 0.0), owing to the rotational symmetry of all the NWs about the Z-axis, with a period of , as can be easily inferred from Fig. 1. Hence, the optical constants via these two optical vectors are averaged out to obtain the mean perpendicular components of optical constants as  for ε1⊥(ω), and similarly for ε2⊥(ω), n⊥(ω), K⊥(ω), R⊥(ω), and I⊥(ω).66 The values of the optical constants along the optical vector (0.0. 0.0, 1.0) are simply taken to be the parallel components of the optical constants and are denoted by ε1‖(ω) and ε2‖(ω); n‖(ω); K‖(ω); R‖(ω); and I‖(ω).

Fig. 6 shows the figures for ε1⊥(ω) and ε2⊥(ω), ε1‖(ω) and ε2‖(ω), for both the pristine and c/s NWs in the energy range of 0 eV to 15 eV. The real part of the dielectric function depicts the electronic polarizability of the NWs via the Clausius–Mossotti relations.65 The various other contributions to the polarizability of the NWs may be ignored, especially in the energy range considered, owing to the inertia of the constituent atoms. The static dielectric constants (the dielectric constants at the minimum frequency) for both the perpendicular and parallel cases, ε⊥(0) and ε‖(0), were calculated for both the pristine and c/s NWs and are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). In the case of the pristine NWs, the CdS NW with static dielectric constants of 2.53 and 2.32 in the perpendicular and parallel cases, respectively, have the least polarizability, while the CdTe NW with static dielectric constants of 2.98 and 2.76 in the perpendicular and parallel cases have the maximum polarizability for the pristine NWs included in this work. In the perpendicular case, the ZnS/CdS c/s NW has a static dielectric constant of 2.69, which means its electronic polarizability along the perpendicular optical vector is less than that of all the pristine NWs, while ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs with ε⊥(ω) of 3.42 and 4.23, have more electronic polarizability than all the other NWs along the perpendicular optical vector. For the parallel optical vector, ZnS/CdS c/s NW has the least polarizability while ZnS/CdTe NW has the maximum polarizability for the c/s NWs, with ε‖(ω) values of 3.21 and 2.47, respectively. In short, for the ZnS/CdX (X = S, Se, Te) c/s NWs, as one moves from the CdS to CdTe shell, the electronic polarizability of the NWs keeps on increasing, as can be inferred from Table S1 (ESI†). Alternatively, it can be said that the electronic polarizability of the c/s NWs is inversely dependent on the corresponding bandgaps of the c/s NWs. This result is almost intuitive because as we move from the CdS to the CdTe shell, the diameters of the c/s NWs keep on increasing, which may cause the binding forces between the valence electrons from their parent atoms to decrease. This reducing binding force may also be the reason for the shrinking of the bandgap as we move from ZnO/CdS NW to ZnO/CdTe NW. The dielectric constant is proportional to the density of atoms and the polarizability of the materials. As we move from the S to Te atoms of the shell, the atomic radii increase, increasing the atomic density and thus may be the cause of the stretching of the c/s NW diameters. This may also be the cause for the increasing trend of the static dielectric constants as one moves from ZnS/CdS to ZnS/CdTe c/s NW. The plots of ε⊥(ω) and ε‖(ω) show some negative values in certain energy ranges for the NWs, as given in Table S1 (ESI†). The NWs show metal-like characteristics in these regions where ε⊥(ω) and ε‖(ω) show negative values (see Table S1, ESI†).65 In the corresponding energy ranges, the reflectivity values can be expected to have their maxima for the respective NWs. However, in the case of ZnS/CdSe c/s NW, the ε⊥(ω) plot shows no negative values.

(c) Perpendicular components ε1⊥(ω) and ε2⊥(ω), and (d) parallel components ε1‖(ω) and ε2‖(ω) of the real and imaginary parts of dielectric constants for c/s NWs. 
The various peaks observed in the figures of the imaginary parts ε2⊥(ω) and ε2‖(ω) of the dielectric constants are attributed to the inter-band transitions that correspond to the absorption of the incident radiations by the electrons lying in the VB.65 For the perpendicular incidence in the case of pristine NWs, the various prominent peaks occur at 2.96 eV, 3.78 eV, 5.78 eV, 6.37 eV, 7.7 eV, 8.33 eV, 10.21 eV and 11.19 eV for ZnS NW; 2.28 eV, 3.02 eV, 5.41 eV, 6.76 eV, 7.62 eV, 8.09 eV for CdS NW; 2.16 eV, 2.87 eV, 4.97 eV, 5.63 eV, 7.15 eV, 7.68 eV for CdSe NW; and 2.36 eV, 2.99 eV, 4.13 eV, 6.07 eV, 6.64 eV for CdTe NW, as seen in Fig. 6(a). For the parallel incidence in the case of pristine NWs, the various prominent peaks occur at almost the same corresponding energies as in the case of the perpendicular incidence, with the only difference being in the intensities of the peaks, as can be seen in Fig. 6(b). All the peaks may be due to the electronic transitions from the s-orbitals of the group-II atoms (Zn and Cd) to the p-orbitals of the group-VI atoms (S, Se and Te) at the corresponding energies. Some prominent peaks can be observed at 2.39 eV, 3.03 eV, 4.53 eV, 6.07 eV, 6.76 eV and 8.13 eV for ZnS/CdS c/s NW; 1.71 eV, 2.59 eV, 3.49 eV, 4.17 eV, 4.73 eV, 5.29 eV, 6.17 eV, 6.92 eV and 7.83 eV for ZnS/CdSe c/s NW; and 1.78, 2.45, 3.10, 4.19, 7.36 and 8.46 eV for ZnS/CdTe c/s NW, as far as the perpendicular incidence case is considered. Even for the parallel incidence, the peaks occur at almost the same corresponding energies, with variations in the peak intensities. All these characteristic peaks in the case of the c/s NWs also seem to be arising due to the electronic transitions occurring due to the sp-hybridizations at the respective energy levels. Moreover, the imaginary parts of the dielectric constants give a rough idea about the absorption processes in the corresponding NWs.65 Hence, it can be conjectured from Fig. 6 that the absorption processes in the cases of the pristine NWs may begin from the visible (VIS) region of the electromagnetic radiation and swell in the ultraviolet (UV) region. Also, in the case of the ZnS/CdS c/s NW, it can be speculated that there would be no absorption of radiation in the infrared (IR) region and the absorption processes would only kick off in the VIS range. However, the ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs, having bandgaps less than 1.65 eV, will also absorb the incident IR radiation.65 The same can also be surmised from the ε2⊥(ω) and ε2‖(ω) plots of ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs.

Fig. 7 shows the plots of R.I. and extinction co-efficient of the pristine, as well as the c/s NWs for both the perpendicular and parallel cases. The values of the static and maximum refractive indices are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). For both the average perpendicular and parallel vectors, the CdTe NW has the highest values of static refractive indices and the CdS NW has the lowest values among the pristine NWs. In the case of the c/s NWs, the ZnS/CdS c/s NW shows the lowest static refractive indices while the ZnS/CdTe has the highest static refractive indices for both the parallel and perpendicular incidents (see Table S2, ESI†). This implies that for the c/s NWs, as the bandgap decreases, the value of the static refractive indices increases. This observation follows directly from the Penn model, which suggests that the static dielectric constant should be inversely proportional to the bandgap.66
 Fig. 7  (a) Perpendicular components of R.I. n⊥(ω) and extinction co-efficient K⊥(ω). (b) Parallel components of R.I. n‖(ω) and extinction co-efficient K‖(ω) for pristine NWs. (c) Perpendicular components of R.I. n⊥(ω) and extinction co-efficient K⊥(ω). (d) Parallel components of R.I. n‖(ω) and extinction co-efficient K‖(ω) for c/s NWs. 
It can be seen that n⊥max(ω) occurs in the VIS spectrum for all the pristine and c/s NWs, except for ZnS/CdSe NW, where it occurs in the near-infrared (NIR) region (see Fig. 7). n‖max(ω) is spotted at 277 nm in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) region, 286 nm in the mid-ultraviolet (MUV) region, 340 nm in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) region, 356 nm in the NUV region, 284 nm in the MUV region, 381 nm in the violet part of the VIS spectrum and 451 nm in the blue part of the VIS spectrum for ZnS, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnS/CdS, ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe NWs, respectively. For the perpendicular incidence, all the pristine and c/s NWs have their respective maxima of refractive indices in the VIS or NIR region. Hence, all these NWs could attract likely applications as coating materials for optical fibers and optical lenses used in telescopes, microscopes, and cameras.67
The most prominent peaks (i.e. the maxima) occurring in the extinction coefficient plots of all the NWs are displayed in Table S3 (ESI†). At these wavelengths where the extinction coefficients have maxima, the electrons will be absorbed very quickly (i.e. the depth paths will be the shortest).65 The decay length, δ = c/ωK is an optical constant that is akin to the skin depth associated with an alternating current (AC).65,68,69 This is the distance at which the intensity of the incident radiation diminishes to  times the actual intensity at the point of incidence. It was observed that the decay lengths of all the NWs are much greater than their respective diameters (see Table S3, ESI†) and hence, bear negligible significance in the present study.
The coefficient of absorption is an indicator of the amount of decay of the incident light as it traverses across a material.65,70 For all the pristine NWs, the absorption process begins in the VIS spectrum as seen in Fig. 8. The maxima of absorption coefficients I⊥max(ω) and I‖max(ω) for all the NWs lie within the VUV region of the electromagnetic spectra. Hence, it can be surmised that all the pristine and c/s NWs could find viable applications in devices where high absorbance in the UV region is a desirable attribute. The various other prominent peaks in the absorption spectra almost coincide with the peaks in the imaginary parts of the complex dielectric functions, for all the NWs.

(c) Perpendicular components of the absorption co-efficient I⊥(ω) and reflectance R⊥(ω). (d) Parallel components of the absorption co-efficient I‖(ω) and reflectance R‖(ω) for c/s NWs. 
The static reflectances and the maxima of reflectances of all the pristine and c/s NWs, for both the perpendicular and parallel incidences, are depicted in Table S4 (ESI†). In the case of the c/s NWs, the ZnS/CdS NW has the lowest values of R⊥(0) and R‖(0) and the ZnS/CdTe NW has the highest values of the same (see Table S4, ESI†). This means that in the c/s NWs, as the bandgap decreases, the static reflectance increases. The peak reflectances for the perpendicular incidence, occur in the VUV region of the electromagnetic spectra, in the cases of ZnS. CdS, CdSe, CdTe and ZnS/CdS NWs (see Table S4, ESI†). In the cases of ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs, the peak reflectances for the perpendicular incidence case are seen at 484 nm in the blue region and 506 nm in the cyan region of the VIS spectrum, respectively. The reflectance maxima, in the case of the parallel optical vector, are found in the VUV region of the electromagnetic spectra for all the pristine and c/s NWs included in the study. From Table S4 (ESI†), it can be seen that the peak reflectances occur in the VIS spectrum for the ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs, in the case of the perpendicular incidence.
7. Summary
The DFT calculations revealed that all the pristine NWs have wide direct bandgaps and would, therefore, find applications in the fabrication of semiconductor lasers and colourful LEDs. The wide bandgaps of these NWs may enable their applications in the fabrication of devices that can operate at higher temperatures.71 Hence, these NWs could find their potential uses in the defense and aerospace technologies, where devices are expected to be able to withstand extremely high temperatures. The ZnS/CdS, ZnS/CdSe, and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs were optimized and their electronic structures were observed. It was found that the ZnS/CdS c/s NW still had a wide direct bandgap of 2.14 eV across the Γ-point, but the bandgaps for the ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs were 1.48 eV and 1.14 eV, respectively, and that too of the indirect type. Hence, it was observed that there was a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition. The indirect bandgaps of the ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs lie close to the values of the indirect bandgap in the case of silicon, and hence, could find feasible applications in the construction of terrestrial micro- and nano-photovoltaic devices of the next generation.72 The truncating bandgaps in the case of c/s NWs were attributed to the shell effect. Furthermore, it was seen that the SQ efficiencies of the c/s NWs were much greater as compared to the pristine NWs. The ZnS/CdTe c/s NW showed a maximum efficiency of 33.59%. The efficiencies of the CdSe NW and the ZnS/CdS c/s NWs were the same (i.e., 20.38%), owing to their identical bandgaps. Some optical constants for the perpendicular and parallel cases were subsequently calculated for the pristine and c/s NWs. For the c/s NWs, the static dielectric constants were found to be inversely reliant on the electronic bandgaps of the c/s NWs. The imaginary parts of the dielectric constants predicted that in most of the pristine and the c/s NWs, the absorption processes would kick off in the IR or the VIS region and would peak in the UV region. In the case of the c/s NWs, the static refractive indices were found to be inversely dependent on the electronic bandgaps. The ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs had static refractive indices greater than all the pristine NWs for the perpendicular incident electromagnetic radiations. Also, for the perpendicular incidence, these ZnS/CdTe c/s NW had a higher value of the maximum refractive index as compared to that of all the other NWs, and this maximum refractive index fell in the VIS region. Hence, among all the NWs studied, ZnS/CdTe c/s NW would be the most suitable for use as a cold anti-reflective coating material for optical fibers. Also, all the c/s NWs had high absorbances in the VUV regions, enabling their use as shielding materials for devices where UV absorbance is a requisite trait. In the case of the c/s NWs, the static reflectances increased as the bandgaps decreased. Also, for the perpendicular instances, the ZnS/CdSe and ZnS/CdTe c/s NWs were standouts due to the reflectance maxima occurring in the VIS spectrum. It would also be interesting to observe the strain- and diameter-dependent variations in the electronic and optical properties of these c/s NWs in the future.
