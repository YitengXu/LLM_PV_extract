    , Accepted 23rd February 2021First published on 24th February 2021AbstractRational structure design of semiconductor photocatalysts is meaningful to enhance their sunlight-driven hydrogen-evolution performance. Herein, we present a facile approach to prepare Cd1−xZnxS nanopopcorns with zinc blende/wurtzite phase junctions by using excess thioacetamide (TAA). The as-obtained Cd1−xZnxS samples were used for visible-light photocatalytic H2 evolution without a co-catalyst. The H2-evolution activity reaches 282.14 μmol h−1 mg−1, which is ca. 12 fold higher than that of Cd0.5Zn0.5S prepared with an equivalent dose of TAA. Meanwhile, an apparent quantum yield of 64.4% at 420 nm was achieved. Results demonstrated that the Cd1−xZnxS samples synthesized by using excess TAA improve light absorption and hydrophilicity, which is helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. Moreover, the existence of type-II ZB/WZ phase junctions promotes the separation and migration of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. This work provides a novel idea for the rational design of efficient Cd1−xZnxS-based photocatalysts.
1. Introduction
H2 is an ideal substitute for nonrenewable fossil fuels owing to the development of H2 production technology and storage materials.1,2 Converting inexhaustible solar energy to hydrogen energy via semiconductor-based photocatalysis is environmentally friendly and has therefore attracted considerable attention.3,4 For decades, researchers have been increasingly exploring the technology of semiconductor-based photocatalytic H2 evolution (PHE), especially those semiconductors with suitable band structures and visible-light response.5,6
Among diverse semiconductor-based photocatalysts, CdS and its solid solutions (e.g., Cd1−xZnxS and Cd1−xMnxS) are becoming more and more popular in the field of photocatalysis owing to their suitable band structures and optical properties.5,7,8 As a ternary solid solution with low toxicity and cost-effectiveness, Cd1−xZnxS (CZS) has been widely studied because of its flexible and adjustable bandgap and edge position, simple preparation process, strong visible-light response and high resistance to photocorrosion.7,9 Some efforts have been made to explore Cd1−xZnxS with different x values, morphologies and crystal structures.10–16 By adjusting the value of x in Cd1−xZnxS, the ternary solid solutions possess the advantages of both wide bandgap ZnS (3.6 eV) and narrow bandgap CdS (2.4 eV).10 Qin Li et al. found that the H2-production rate of Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions varies with controlled Cd1−xZnxS bandgap via changing the Cd/Zn molar ratio.11 Up to now, Cd1−xZnxS samples with various morphologies such as nanosheets,12 nanospheres,13 nanorods14 and hollow dodecahedral cages15 have been investigated with regard to their photocatalytic performance. In addition, two crystal structures (zinc blende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ)) of Cd1−xZnxS have attracted much attention. It has been reported that ZB-type Cd1−xZnxS exhibits higher PHE activity than the WZ-type structure.16 Although Cd1−xZnxS has great potential for application in PHE, some disadvantages such as low solar energy utilization, rapid recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and photocorrosion still limit its further application.
Many effective strategies (e.g., element doping, structure designing and co-catalyst loading) have been developed to improve the photocatalytic performance of Cd1−xZnxS-based materials.7 Among these strategies, construction of junctions (e.g., heterojunctions and phase junctions) is one of the most important ways. Many Cd1−xZnxS-based heterojunctions without any noble metal co-catalyst such as MoO2/Cd0.5Zn0.5S,17 1T-LixMoS2/Cd0.5Zn0.5S,18 Cu1.94S–Cd1−xZnxS (ref. 19) and ZnO1−x/Zn0.2Cd0.8S (ref. 20) have been successfully constructed to enhance PHE performance. The formation of phase junctions between two crystalline phases of a semiconductor is an effective means to improve the PHE activity, such as α/β phase Ga2O3,21 anatase/rutile TiO2 (ref. 22 and 23) and hexagonal/cubic CdS.24 Phase junctions can promote the separation/transfer of photoinduced carriers and prolong their lifetime owing to the internal electric field across the phase junction.25 For Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions, twinned Cd1−xZnxS with phase junctions between the ZB and WZ segments has become one of the most efficient H2-evolution catalysts so far.26 The twin-induced Cd0.5Zn0.5S with long-range ordered phase junctions has high activity (25.8 μmol h−1 mg−1) and an apparent quantum yield up to 62% without a co-catalyst.27 Moreover, bare Cd1−xZnxS with ZB/WZ phase junctions stabilized by L-cysteine exhibited high PHE activity (31.3 μmol h−1 mg−1) with a high apparent quantum yield of 65.7%.28 Besides, phase-junction Zn0.5Cd0.5S showed excellent PHE activity (125.27 μmol h−1 mg−1) by controlling the homogeneity and crystallinity under different reaction conditions.16 Recently, the ZB/WZ phase junctions with major ZB and minor WZ phases in Cd1−xZnxS can effectively improve the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers and thus H2 production (30 μmol h−1 mg−1).29 However, the synthesis of ZB/WZ phase junction Cd1−xZnxS often needs additional conditions such as ultrasonic wave irradiation,30 high temperature,27L-cysteine assistance31 and a tedious process.32
For a PHE reaction system, the hydrophilicity of catalysts is also a key point to boost the solid–liquid–gas multiphase photocatalytic process. Highly hydrophilic materials exhibit many advantages for photocatalytic reactions in an aqueous medium. First, improving the surface wettability is helpful in promoting the dispersion states of photocatalysts and providing a larger interface with water.33 Second, the better dispersity is beneficial to inhibit charge recombination and increase photocatalytic efficiency.33 Third, increasing the hydrophilicity of catalysts can lower the adsorption energy of water molecules and boost the reaction of charge carriers and water molecules.34 Some hydrophilic materials, such as CTF-HUST-A1,35 P123@SrTiO3 (ref. 34) and ReS2-BzO-TiO2,36 have been found to be very promising for PHE in recent years.
In this work, we synthesized ZB/WZ phase-junction Cd1−xZnxS nanopopcorns by a facile one-pot solvothermal method using excess thioacetamide (TAA). During the preparation process, TAA acts as a sulfur source and its addition amount has a great influence on the structure and performance of catalysts when using pure ethylenediamine (en) as the solvent. The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), water contact angle measurements and so on. The H2-evolution rate of the as-obtained Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 sample reaches 282.14 μmol h−1 mg−1 under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm), which is about 12 fold higher than that of Cd0.5Zn0.5S prepared using an equivalent dose of TAA. Meanwhile, a high apparent quantum yield of 64.4% was achieved at 420 nm. The excellent photocatalytic performance is higher than that of most reported Cd1−xZnxS-based materials. We also explored deep insights into the photocatalytic behavior of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16. Finally, a possible reaction mechanism is put forward from the experimental results.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Zinc nitrate hydrate (Zn(NO3)2·4H2O), cadmium nitrate hydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(COOCH3)2·2H2O), cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(COOCH3)2·2H2O), thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2), and ethylenediamine (H2NCH2CH2NH2) were purchased from Aladdin Company. Absolute ethyl alcohol (EtOH), sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) and sodium sulfide (Na2S) were obtained from Sinopharm Company.
2.2. Preparation of Cd1−xZnxS photocatalysts
All of the Cd1−xZnxS samples were prepared by a simple one-step solvothermal approach. Typically, 10x (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1) mmol of Zn(NO3)2·4H2O (where x corresponds to the Zn/(Zn + Cd) molar ratio of Zn and Cd precursors) was dispersed in 60 mL of ethylenediamine (en) and stirred for 30 min. Subsequently, 10(1 − x) mmol of Cd(NO3)2·4H2O was introduced into the mixture and kept stirring for 30 min. After that, an equivalent (10 mmol) or excess (16 mmol) dose of thioacetamide (TAA) was added as the sulfur source. The reaction mixture kept stirring for 1 h until a homogeneous viscous suspension was formed. The resulting mixture was then sealed in a 100 mL capacity Teflon-lined autoclave and heated up to 180 °C for 24 h. After that, the obtained precipitate was washed with distilled water and absolute alcohol, respectively. Finally, the product was dried at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum oven and collected for further characterization. The obtained samples were labeled Cd1−xZnxS-10 and Cd1−xZnxS-16 according to the amount of TAA added. Furthermore, we also adjusted TAA addition amount from 10 to 22 mmol for Cd0.5Zn0.5S, and the resulting samples were labelled Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-13, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-19 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S-22, respectively.
2.3. Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted using a Hitachi scanning electron microscope (Su8010). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired on an FEI electron microscope (Tecnai G2F20). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on a VG XPS spectrometer (ESCALAB 250) with 284.8 eV to calibrate C 1s peak positions. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were acquired on a Thermo Scientific spectrometer (NICOLET IS50). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under nitrogen flow with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 on a Netzsch instrument (STA449 F3). Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was conducted using an Agilent ICPOES730 spectrometer. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded using an Agilent UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (CARRY-5000) by using dry-pressed solid-state samples and BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000) under an excitation wavelength of 400 nm. Absolute fluorescence quantum yield (Φf) was measured using an Edinburgh FLS1000 fluorescence spectrometer. Time-resolved PL decay spectra were acquired on a Horiba fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 376 nm. Water contact angles were collected on a Dataphysics contact angle measurement apparatus (OCA20). Mott–Schottky experiments were performed on an electrochemical workstation (SP-300, Bio-Logic SAS) in the potential range from −0.4 to 0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at different frequencies of 1500, 1000 and 500 Hz.
2.4. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
Photocatalytic H2 production was carried out in a top-irradiation reaction Pyrex cell equipped with a glass circulation system. The reaction temperature was maintained at 5 °C by using cooling water flow. A xenon lamp (300 W, CEL-HXUV300, CEAULICHT Co., Ltd) equipped with a cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as the light source. The light intensity at the position of liquid level was measured to be 528 mW cm−2. In a typical photocatalytic procedure, the catalyst (1 mg) was dispersed in 100 mL sacrificial reagent solution (1.225 M Na2S/0.875 M Na2SO3). Before irradiation, the system was evacuated for 30 min. The generated H2 was determined every 1 h by gas chromatography using a TCD detector and a carbon molecular sieve column (TDX-01) and Ar carrier gas.
Apparent quantum yield (AQY) was measured using the above reaction system with a monochromatic light-emitting diode (LED) as the light source. The incident wavelengths of LED lamps were 380, 420, 460, and 520 nm, respectively. Light intensity was detected using a Perfectlight optical power meter (PL-MW-2000). The AQY was calculated using the following expression:37  where Ne refers to the total reacted electrons, Np indicates the total incident photons, n represents the moles of H2 evolved (mol), NA = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1, c = 3 × 108 m s−1, and h = 6.626 × 10−34 J s. Besides, λ, p, t, and A correspond to the wavelength of the diode light (m), the intensity of irradiation light (W cm−2), the irradiation time (s) and the irradiation area (cm2), respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure characterization
Cd1−xZnxS-16 samples were obtained by adding excess amounts of the sulfur source TAA in the preparation process. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the Cd1−xZnxS-16 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) samples. For x = 0 and 1, the XRD patterns of the samples were readily indexed to WZ CdS (JCPDS 41-1049) and ZnS(en)0.5,38,39 respectively. For Cd1−xZnxS-16 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) samples, the XRD patterns depict a transformation from WZ CdS to ZB dominated Cd1−xZnxS (ref. 16, 27 and 30) with an increase in the amount of Zn precursor.40 Note that the peak positions located at 26.5, 43.7 and 51.8° corresponding to the (002), (110) and (112) planes of hexagonal CdS, respectively, gradually shift to the high-angle side, which demonstrates the formation of Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions.11 Moreover, for Cd1−xZnxS-16 (0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.9) samples, the sharp peak at 10.2° belongs to the characteristic diffraction peak of ZnS(en)0.5.38Fig. 1b presents the XRD patterns of the Cd1−xZnxS-10 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) samples with a high-angle shift for 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5 and the ZnS(en)0.5 sharp peak at 10.2° for 0.7 ≤ x ≤ 1. For comparison, the XRD patterns of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16, together with the standard diffraction cards of the hexagonal phase CdS and cubic phase ZnS, are shown in Fig. 1c. The diffraction peaks of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10 reflect the crystalline structure of both ZB and WZ phases,27 which can be indexed to Cd0.5Zn0.5S.41 The peak positions at 27.1, 44.8 and 53.2° of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 can be assigned to the (111), (220) and (311) planes of the cubic ZB phase, and the peak position at 25.6° belongs to the (100) plane of the hexagonal WZ phase.16,42 The characteristic diffraction peaks of ZnS(en)0.5 can also be found for Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16.

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of Cd1−xZnxS-16 samples. CdS-16 (e.g., pure CdS) has a well-developed nanorod morphology with a diameter of about 50 nm and a length of around 500 nm to 1 μm (Fig. 2a). For Cd0.9Zn0.1S-16, a nanorod structure with a diameter of about 30–50 nm and a length of around 500 nm was observed (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 presents a mixture of popcorn-like nanoparticles (described as nanopopcorns) and plate-like nanoparticles (described as nanoplates) (Fig. 2d). When further increasing the feeding amount of Zn precursor, the nanoplates become the majority in Cd0.3Zn0.7S-16 and Cd0.1Zn0.9S-16 (Fig. 2e and f), and all particles are nanoplates for ZnS-16 (e.g., ZnS(en)0.5) (Fig. 2g). The SEM images of Cd1−xZnxS-10 samples are given in Fig. S1.†

The morphology and structure of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 was further characterized using TEM (Fig. 3). The nanopopcorn structure is made up of small nanoparticles possessing high crystallinity (Fig. 3a–c). The HRTEM image exhibits lattice fringes with a spacing of ca. 0.32 and 0.36 nm indexed to the (111) planes of the ZB lattice and the (100) planes of the WZ lattice of Cd1−xZnxS solid solution, respectively.27,30,43 For the nanoplates in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 (Fig. 3d), the SAED pattern (Fig. 3e, inset) and the HRTEM image (Fig. 3f) demonstrate that the nanoplates are polycrystalline.44 Moreover, the lattice spacing of ca. 0.32 nm in the nanoplates belongs to the (020) diffraction plane of ZnS(en)0.5.39 To further confirm the chemical composition of nanopopcorns and nanoplates in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping was carried out (Fig. 3g–j). Cd, S and Zn are homogeneously distributed in the popcorn-like Cd1−xZnxS nanoparticles, while for ZnS(en)0.5 nanoplates, Zn and S are homogeneously distributed in the plate-like region, but a very small amount of Cd was observed. Fig. S3† also reveals a similar element distribution for pure ZnS(en)0.5 nanoplates (ZnS-16). For more details, the EDX data of nanoplates (Fig. 3g, Area 1#) and nanopopcorns (Fig. 3g, Area 2#) were obtained, which confirm the chemical constitution of ZnS(en)0.5 nanoplates and Cd1−xZnxS nanopopcorns (Table S1 and Fig. S4a–c†). Furthermore, according to the EDX results in Table S1,† the chemical formula of the nanopopcorns in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 can be written as Cd0.7Zn0.3S. Fig. S2† presents the TEM images of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10.

The insets in (b) and (e) are the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of nanopopcorns and nanoplates, respectively. 
XPS was conducted to analyze the chemical composition and valence states of the samples. The overall survey scan spectrum of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 shows the elements of Cd, Zn, S and N (Fig. S5†). In the Cd 3d spectrum (Fig. 4a), the two peaks of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 at 404.5 and 411.3 eV can be assigned to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2, respectively.26,45 As for the Zn 2p spectrum (Fig. 4b), the two peaks at 1020.5 and 1043.6 eV can be assigned to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p2/1, respectively.39,46 Note that the sharp and symmetrical peaks of Cd 3d5/2, Cd 3d3/2, Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p2/1 in Cd and Zn spectra indicate that both Cd and Zn have a valence of +2.26,47 In Fig. 4c, a peak (398.8 eV) in the N 1s spectrum is assigned to the Zn–N bond of ZnS(en)0.5.39,48 Additionally, in the S 2p spectra (Fig. 4d), the two peaks fitted at 160.4 and 161.6 eV correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively.26,39

Fig. 5a depicts the FTIR spectra of the samples. For ZnS-16 (e.g., pure ZnS(en)0.5), two sharp characteristic absorption peaks are located at 3240 and 3110 cm−1 and there is a small absorption peak at 1620 cm−1 belonging to the N–H vibration.44,49 Moreover, the absorption peaks at about 2980 and 2970 cm−1 can be assigned to the C–H vibration, and the peaks at 1600, 1360, and 1070 cm−1 can be attributed to –NH2, –CH2 and –CN stretching vibrations, respectively.44,50 In addition, the peak at 633 cm−1 results from the coordination between N and Zn2+.44 Particularly, for Cd1−xZnxS-16 samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3, there were no FTIR characteristic absorption peaks of ZnS(en)0.5, indicating the absence of ZnS(en)0.5 in these samples. For Cd1−xZnxS-16 samples with 0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.9, the intensity of the characteristic peaks of ZnS(en)0.5 gradually enhances with the value of x, suggesting the increasing content of ZnS(en)0.5 for larger x.

To determine the mass ratio of ZnS(en)0.5 in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16, TG analysis was carried out as shown in Fig. 5b. Three weight loss stages can be observed in the temperature range of 25–700 °C for both ZnS(en)0.5 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16. First, the loss stage between 25 and 300 °C is mainly caused by desorption of adsorbed water on the surface of the samples. Second, the decomposition of ZnS(en)0.5 to ZnS occurs between 300 and 420 °C.48 Third, a slight weight loss at 420–700 °C is due to the oxidation of the samples. For ZnS-16, in the second stage (300–420 °C), the loss of about 22.0% net weight is very close to the reported value for pure ZnS(en)0.5.48,51 By comparison, for Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 the net weight loss is about 5.7 wt% in this stage. Moreover, the weight percentage of ZnS(en)0.5 in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 could be derived based on the following equation:48  where m(ZnS(en)0.5) and m(Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16) represent the mass of ZnS(en)0.5 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16, respectively. Accordingly, the weight percentage of ZnS(en)0.5 in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 is 26%. Furthermore, we detected the actual composition of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 by ICP-OES (Table S2†). From Table S2,† the weight percentage of Zn in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 is 27.36%. In addition, according to the TGA data in Fig. 5b, we can estimate that the weight percentage of Zn from ZnS(en)0.5 in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 is 13.34%. Therefore, the weight percentage of Zn in Cd1−xZnxS nanopopcorns was given by 27.36% − 13.34% = 14.02%. Moreover, the weight percentage of Cd in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 or Cd1−xZnxS nanopopcorns is 46.54% (Table S2†). Therefore, the mole ratio of Cd/Zn in the Cd1−xZnxS nanopopcorns can be calculated to be 1.94:1 (e.g., 0.66:0.34), and the chemical formula of the nanopopcorns can be written as Cd0.7Zn0.3S, which is also consistent with the EDX results.
3.2. Photocatalytic performance
The photocatalytic H2-evolution activity was evaluated by dispersing 1 mg of photocatalyst in 100 mL of deionized water containing hole scavengers (1.225 M Na2S/0.875 M Na2SO3) under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm). As shown in Fig. 6a, no H2 evolution was detected for ZnS-16 (e.g., ZnS(en)0.5) as reported.48 Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 exhibited the highest H2-evolution rate of 282.14 μmol h−1 mg−1, which is better than that of other phase-junction Cd1−xZnxS (Table S4†) and most Cd1−xZnxS-based materials (Table S5†). The high PHE activity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 mainly originates from ZB/WZ phase-junction Cd0.7Zn0.3S nanopopcorns due to the inactivity of ZnS(en)0.5. In comparison, the maximum H2-production rate of Cd1−xZnxS-10 samples reaches 28.55 μmol h−1 mg−1 (Fig. 6b). Fig. 6c displays the AQYs of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 together with its UV-vis absorption spectrum. The match between the wavelength-dependent AQY values and the absorption curve trend reflects photoinduced H2 generation. Notably, the AQY of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 reached 64.4% at 420 nm when using 10 mg catalyst (Fig. S6†), which is higher than that of other Cd1−xZnxS-based photocatalysts (Tables S4 and S5†). The stability of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 was assessed by repeating the photocatalytic reaction under the same conditions. After five cycles of experiments (Fig. 6d), there is no obvious decrease of H2-production amount for Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 in comparison with the initial cycle, demonstrating its excellent stability during the photocatalytic process. No apparent change in the XRD patterns, the morphology and the XPS spectra of Cd, Zn and S of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 (Fig. S7 and S8†) before and after the photocatalytic reaction also confirms the good stability of the catalyst. It was reported that high crystallinity is beneficial for the photocatalytic stability of Cd1−xZnxS solid solution.16 This is because stochastic defects acting as the trapping and recombination centers for photogenerated electron–hole pairs are unfavorable for the photocatalytic performance.28,52 The Cd1−xZnxS nanopopcorns possess high crystallinity according to the HRTEM image and the corresponding FFT pattern (Fig. 3b and c). Moreover, the type-II ZB/WZ phase-junctions are not considered as recombination centers for photoinduced electron–hole pairs,28,53 but they act as special phase junctions, which are beneficial for effective charge separation and migration.

The effect of TAA addition amount on the photocatalytic activity was also explored. Fig. 7a displays the PHE rates of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-13, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-19 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S-22. The highest PHE rate was achieved by Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16, which is about 12 times higher than that of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10. Moreover, Fig. 7b illustrates the effect of anions and adding sequence of Zn and Cd precursors on H2-evolution performance. The H2-evolution rate increased about 1.7 times when replacing Zn(AC)2·2H2O and Cd(AC)2·2H2O with Zn(NO3)2·4H2O and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O. In addition, the rate of H2 evolution increased 1.4 times when successively adding Zn(NO3)2·4H2O and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O to ethylenediamine compared to the simultaneous addition of Zn and Cd precursors. Furthermore, the PHE rates at different concentrations of sacrificial agents are shown in Fig. 7c. 1.225 M Na2S/0.875 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution is the best concentration for this system. Besides, the mass activities of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10 are presented in Fig. 7d which shows a quasi-linear relationship at very low catalyst concentrations for Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16.

3.3. Photocatalytic mechanism
The optical properties of a photocatalyst are of importance to understand the photocatalytic process. A comparison of UV-vis absorption spectra of Cd1−xZnxS-16 samples is displayed in Fig. 8a. The absorption edge of Cd1−xZnxS solid solutions moves from the visible to ultraviolet region when the Zn content increases. The color of Cd1−xZnxS-16 also agrees with their absorption variations (Fig. S9†). Compared with Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 exhibits an obvious red shift in the absorption edge (Fig. S10†). The bandgap energy of Cd1−xZnxS can be evaluated according to the Kubelka–Munk method.54 As shown in Fig. 8b, the bandgaps of CdS-16, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10 and ZnS-16 were estimated to be 2.45, 2.61, 2.77 and 4.62 eV, respectively. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10 were acquired with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm (Fig. 8c). The weaker intensity of the PL peak for Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 reflects the stronger ability of restraining the recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes.55 The PL emission peak shift to a longer wavelength for Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 compared to that for Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10 is caused by their different chemical compositions of Cd1−xZnxS (Cd0.7Zn0.3S for Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S for Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10). A higher content of Cd in Cd1−xZnxS causes a shift of the emission peak to a longer wavelength.28,56 Besides, the absolute fluorescence quantum yield of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10 is 1.47% (Table S3†), which is much higher than that of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 (0.21%), indicating the more efficient separation of photoexcited electrons and holes in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 than in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10. Moreover, the time-resolved PL decay spectra are presented in Fig. 8d. The average fluorescence lifetime of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 (1.22 ns) is longer than that of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10 (0.77 ns), demonstrating the more effective separation and migration of charge carriers for photocatalysis.57 Hydrophilicity is also of importance for H2 evolution, and thus we conducted water contact angle measurements over Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10 (Fig. 9). On the surface of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 and Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10, the contact angles of water droplets were measured to be 11.11 and 20.95° at 150 ms, respectively. The surface wettability test demonstrates that the hydrophilicity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 is better than that of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-10, which is helpful for the improvement of H2 evolution.33,35

To better explore the photocatalytic behavior of ZB/WZ phase-junction Cd0.7Zn0.3S nanopopcorns in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16, pure WZ Cd0.7Zn0.3S (ref. 31) and ZB Cd0.7Zn0.3S (ref. 42) samples were synthesized as reported, respectively. The XRD patterns of WZ and ZB Cd0.7Zn0.3S samples attest to their successful preparation (Fig. S11a†). Interestingly, WZ and ZB Cd0.7Zn0.3S samples exhibit different PHE activities (Fig. S12†), which is likely due to the difference in their conduction bands (Fig. 10a). The bandgaps of WZ and ZB Cd0.7Zn0.3S were estimated to be 2.52 and 2.50 eV (Fig. S11b†), respectively. The conduction band (CB) potentials of WZ and ZB Cd0.7Zn0.3S were measured to be −0.46 and −0.31 V (vs. RHE) based on the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S11c and d†). The valence band (VB) potentials of WZ and ZB Cd0.7Zn0.3S were calculated to be 2.06 and 2.19 V according to the equation: EVB = Eg + ECB. Therefore, the band structure schematic of WZ and ZB Cd0.7Zn0.3S is illustrated in Fig. 10a. Based on our results, a type-II staggered band alignment diagram of ZB/WZ phase-junction Cd0.7Zn0.3S nanopopcorns for visible-light H2-evolution is proposed in Fig. 10b. The type-II ZB/WZ phase-junctions can also be clearly identified from the HRTEM image in Fig. 3c. The type-II staggered band alignment formed between the ZB and WZ segments acts as a special phase junction, which is beneficial for effective charge separation and migration. The CB and VB energy levels of the WZ phase upshift with respect to those of the ZB phase based on our experimental results (Fig. 10a) and the related reports.27,28 Upon irradiation of ZB/WZ phase-junction Cd0.7Zn0.3S nanopopcorns, for both ZB and WZ phases, electrons are photoexcited to their own CB and an equivalent amount of holes remain in their own VB. The photoinduced electrons tend to transfer from the CB of the WZ phase to the CB of the ZB phase via the ZB/WZ phase junction and then reduce H+ to H2, while the photoinduced holes transfer from the VB of the ZB phase to the VB of the WZ phase and then oxidize the sacrificial agent S2−/SO32−. As a result, the construction of the ZB/WZ phase-junction in Cd0.7Zn0.3S nanopopcorns leads to an efficient separation and migration of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, which is greatly beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic activity.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we present a facile one-pot method to synthesize Cd1−xZnxS nanopopcorns with ZB/WZ phase junctions using excess thioacetamide (TAA). Without a co-catalyst, the visible-light PHE of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 reaches a remarkable value of 282.14 μmol h−1 mg−1, which is about 12 fold higher than that of Cd0.5Zn0.5S when using an equivalent amount of TAA and better than that of most Cd1−xZnxS-based materials. In addition, the Cd1−xZnxS phase junctions display a high AQY of 64.4% at 420 nm and excellent stability. The highly efficient photocatalytic performance results from the construction of Cd1−xZnxS nanopopcorns with ZB/WZ phase junctions. The type-II ZB/WZ phase junctions drive the high-efficiency transfer/separation of photoexcited charges with a prolonged carrier lifetime, boosting the photocatalytic process for H2 generation. Moreover, Cd0.5Zn0.5S-16 improves light absorption and hydrophilicity greatly, which is helpful for the photocatalytic reaction. This work will contribute to the rational design and synthesis of inexpensive and highly efficient Cd1−xZnxS-based photocatalysts for clean energy conversion.
