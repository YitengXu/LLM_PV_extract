    , Accepted 27th May 2016First published on 10th June 2016AbstractIt has been a long time that divergent behaviors were observed in many photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) on CdS and ZnS although the two photocatalysts have similar compositions and structures. For example, CdS itself is inactive and loading of cocatalysts is indispensable to achieve high efficiency of hydrogen evolution, but the reverse is true for ZnS. The underlying reasons are still unclear to date. The Volmer reaction of HER on catalysts is H+ + e− + * → H*, and its free energy (ΔGH* = ΔEH* + ΔEZPE − TΔS + eU; the adsorption energy, zero-point energy, entropy and potential energy are on the right side) is a good theoretical descriptor of the electrocatalytic HER activity from the electrocatalytic HER theory. In this paper, we firstly determined the most stable CdS and ZnS(110) termination under the conditions of photocatalytic HER, i.e., pure (110), by calculating the free energies of three reactions related to H2O dissociation on (110). Then we rationalized these behaviors by calculating the free energy of H* adsorption on pure and Pt loaded CdS and ZnS(110) at different pH. The performance of photocatalytic HER on CdS and ZnS was found to be determined jointly by the free energy of H* adsorption and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the photocatalysts. On pure (110) with large ΔGH*, the photocatalytic HER is favored on ZnS due to its higher CBM; on Pt loaded (110) with small ΔGH*, the photocatalytic HER is favored on CdS due to its lower CBM. These results well explained the divergent behaviors observed in the photocatalytic HER on CdS and ZnS.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic water splitting based on semiconductors has been one of the most promising ways to convert solar energy to chemical fuels with high efficiency, large scale and low cost. Among various influential factors the electronic structure and surface reactivity of a photocatalyst play central roles.1,2 As a class of important semiconductor photocatalysts, sulfides usually have many favorable properties, such as small band gaps and high conduction bands which facilitate light absorption and water reduction,3 although they suffer from chemical instability and require sacrificial reagents to suppress photo-corrosion.1 Thus sulfides are often deployed in the half reaction of water splitting, namely, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)2 or as photocathodes in photoelectrochemical cells.4 It has been widely reported that among various sulfides cadmium sulfide (CdS), zinc sulfide (ZnS) and their derivatives have been the most efficient HER catalysts, which received on-going research interest.5–22 Our group also developed band gap tunable CdS and ZnS solid solutions using different synthetic methods.23–27 One of them exhibited a state-of-the-art efficiency for hydrogen evolution among known sulfides without cocatalysts.28
Although CdS and ZnS have similar compositions and crystal structures, i.e., cubic zinc-blende or hexagonal wurtzite, their behaviors in the photocatalytic HER have been demonstrated to be quite different. The efficiencies of hydrogen evolution over CdS photocatalysts were extremely low under visible light irradiation, for example, a quantum efficiency (QE) of 0.2% at 420 nm.5,7,9,10,22 Cocatalysts, such as noble metals5,9,22 and the corresponding sulfides,12 were highly demanded to dramatically enhance the efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. For example, the rate of hydrogen evolution was increased by 280 times with Pt loading (a QE of 0.51 at 420 nm) and by 380 times with Pt and PdS co-loading (a QE of 93% at 420 nm).11 In contrast, high activities of hydrogen evolution could be achieved over ZnS photocatalysts, and loading of cocatalysts has been demonstrated to be dispensable, such as pure ZnS with a QE of 0.9 at 313 nm,15 Cu and Ni doped ZnS with QE of 3.7% and 1.3% at 420 nm,16,17 and ZnS-based solid solutions.18–21,28 Although the QE of pure ZnS at some wavelength in the ultraviolet region is already very high, the energy conversion efficiency or the QE at most wavelengths even in the ultraviolet region is still far from saturation. The rate of hydrogen evolution can still be dramatically enhanced when more oxidative sacrificial reagents were used there.15 Compared with CdS, loading Pt on ZnS only achieved limited improvement in the efficiency. For example, the efficiency of hydrogen evolution over ZnS was only promoted with Pt loading by about 30% under ultraviolet irradiation;15 no enhancement was reported for Cu doped ZnS under visible light irradiation.16
There is an explanation for the difference in the photocatalytic HER on CdS and ZnS. The conduction band minimum (CBM) for ZnS is much higher in energy than that for CdS, namely, −1.55 versus −0.62 V with respect to a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).3 The higher CBM is speculated to create more active photogenerated electrons which are more capable of water reduction for hydrogen evolution.18,19 However, the CBM for CdS is already sufficiently high in energy for water reduction in thermodynamics. Some other factors must be retarding the process of water reduction. The promotion effect of Pt cocatalysts on CdS was usually ascribed to effectively collecting photogenerated electrons and providing more reactive sites.12 Nevertheless, such an effect of Pt cocatalysts on ZnS is much weakened. The divergent behaviors observed in the photocatalytic HER on CdS and ZnS have already been beyond our knowledge.
To rationalize these behaviors, we combined density functional theory (DFT) and knowledge of modern electrocatalytic HER, to study hydrogen adsorption on the nonpolar cleavage (110) surface of cubic CdS and ZnS. The geometrical and electronic structures of CdS and ZnS(110) have been studied by Wu et al.29 and us30,31 at the level of hybrid functionals. The band edges for unrelaxed (110) reported by Wu et al. agreed well with the flat bands obtained from the (photo)electrochemical experiments.29 Meng et al. reported the reaction kinetics of photocatalytic water splitting on polar (111) of cubic ZnS using the nudged elastic band method, and indicated that the Zn-terminated polar surface is more chemically active.32 In addition, the electrocatalytic HER theory dictates that the free energy for H* adsorption is the theoretical descriptor of the electrocatalytic HER activity,33 which has been widely validated by the success of predicting novel HER electrocatalysts.34,35
In this paper, we determined the relative stability of various (110) terminations which are related to the H2O dissociation under the photocatalytic conditions, and then calculated the free energy of H* adsorption (ΔGH*) on the pure and Pt loaded surface. The results demonstrated that pure CdS and ZnS(110) were not good electrocatalysts, but Pt loading greatly improved the electrocatalytic activity. Due to large ΔGH* on pure (110), the higher CBM for ZnS is more favorable to the photocatalytic HER on the surface than the lower CBM for CdS. However, based on small ΔGH* on Pt loaded (110), the lower CBM for CdS is more favorable to the photocatalytic HER than the higher CBM for ZnS. These analyses well explained the differences observed in experiments.
2. Computational details
2.1 Reaction free energy
Four reactions were considered on CdS and ZnS(110), as shown in Reactions (a, b, c and d). H+ + e− + *(M, S or Pt) → H*(M, S or Pt)(a) H2O + *(M or S) → HO*(M or S) + H+ + e−(b) H2O + *(M or S) → O*(M or S) + 2H+ + 2e−(c) H2O + *(M or S) + *(S or M) → H*(M or S) + HO*(S or M)(d)Here, * represents an adsorption site on (110). Reaction (a) is H* adsorption at the cation (M = Cd or Zn and Pt) or anion (S) sites on (110), i.e., the Volmer reaction. Reactions (b) and (c) are related to an H2O dissociation with HO* and O* adsorbed at the cation or anion sites, respectively. Reaction (d) is an H2O dissociation with H*(HO*) at the cation site and HO*(H*) at the anion site simultaneously. The final adsorption geometries in reaction (a)–(d) were denoted as H*(M, S or Pt), HO*(M or S), O*(M or S) and H*(M or S)/HO*(S or M), respectively.
The free energy for H* adsorption on (110) was calculated according to the following equation, to evaluate the activity of photocatalytic HER on CdS and ZnS. ΔGH*(M, S or Pt) = ΔEH*(M, S or Pt) + ΔEZPE − TΔS − ΔG(pH) + eU.(1) ΔEH*(M, S or Pt) is the adsorption energy of an H* at the M, Pt or S site, which can be calculated with (2)Eslab, EnH* and EH2 are the energies of the slab without and with nH* and an H2 molecule, respectively.
ΔEZPE and TΔS are the contributions from zero-point energy (ZPE) and entropy, respectively. ΔG(pH) = −kTln10 × pH is the contribution of the pH in solutions different from 0,36 where T is the temperature and k is the Boltzmann constant. U is the potential equivalent to the CBM for CdS or ZnS with respect to NHE, including part of the effect of photo-excitation in photocatalysts. Due to the shortcomings of underestimating the band gap with DFT-GGA and the quantum confinement effect with the finite slab thickness, the flat band potential from experiments was taken as the potential of photogenerated electrons at the CBM state, i.e., −0.62 (−1.08) and −1.55 (−2.01) V versus NHE at pH = 0 (14).3 Unlike oxides, the pH dependence of the band edges of sulfides do not exactly follow the Nernstian relation. Non-Nernstian dependence of the CdS band edges with a slope of 33 mV pH−1 has been recently reported by measuring the lattice Cd2+ reduction peak potentials.13 The CBMs at pH = 14 for both CdS and ZnS were derived with this slope. This approach considering the effect of photo-excitation is similar to that applied for holes at the valence band maximum (VBM) states in water photo-oxidation on TiO2(110).37 However, the redistribution of charge density in photocatalysts induced by photo-excitation is not accounted for by the current DFT-based calculations.
To determine the possible (110) surface terminations under the photocatalytic conditions, the free energy for reactions (b)–(d) were calculated with ΔGHO*(M or S) = ΔEHO*(M or S) + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔG(pH) − eU(3) ΔGO*(M or S) = ΔEO*(M or S) + ΔEZPE − TΔS + 2ΔG(pH) − 2eU(4) ΔGH*(M or S)/HO*(S or M) = ΔEH*(M or S)/HO*(S or M) + ΔEZPE − TΔS(5) ΔEHO*, ΔEO* and ΔEH*/HO* are the adsorption energies of HO*, O* and both H* and HO* on (110) and can be calculated using the following equation: (6) (7) (8)EnHO*, EnO* and EnH*/nHO* are the energies of adsorption geometries HO*(M or S), O*(M or S) and H*(M or S)/HO*(S or M), respectively. EH2O is the energy of a H2O molecule.
2.2 Models and setups
The cubic nonpolar (110) surface was built with a vacuum of about 20 Å and a symmetric slab of 7 MS (M = Cd or Zn) layers of which the three central layers were kept fixed during relaxation, as shown in Fig. 1(A). The M–S bond within the topmost layer was defined as LM–S-∥ and that between the topmost layer and sublayer was defined as LM–S-⊥. The details of the optimized structures for pure CdS and ZnS(110) can be found in our previous papers.30,31 The Pt, H, O atoms or HO radicals were symmetrically added on each side of the optimized pure (110), and these adsorption geometries were optimized and are shown in Fig. 1(B–I). The effect of the adsorbate coverage on (110) was checked using the 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 slabs (i.e., coverages of 1 and 0.25) for these adsorption geometries.
 Fig. 1  Optimized adsorption geometries for CdS (110) with the 1 × 1 slab: (A) pure (110), (B) H*(Cd), (C) H*(S), (D) HO*(Cd), (E) HO*(S), (F) O*(Cd), (G) O*(S), (H) H*(Cd)/HO*(S), and (I) H*(S)/HO*(Cd). The bond length (L) of adsorbates with (110), as well as the total magnetic moment (μ) and the adsorption energy (ΔE), was presented for each geometry. Cd, S, O and H atoms were depicted in purple, yellow, red and white, respectively. Broken bond of which the length exceeded 3.0 Å were depicted as dashed lines. 
These adsorption geometries were studied by spin-polarized calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package code (VASP).38,39 The general gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formalism40 was adopted to treat the exchange–correlation energy within the framework of DFT. The projector augmented wave potential (PAW) method was adopted.41 The electronic wave function was expanded by the plane wave basis with an energy cutoff of 500 eV. Two k-point meshes of 4 × 6 × 1 and 2 × 3 × 1 were used for the 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 slabs, respectively.42 The optimization of these adsorption geometries proceeded until the forces on atoms were smaller than 0.05 eV Å−1.
The slab thickness was checked before we started the investigation, and it was demonstrated that 7 MS layers are sufficient to have the ground state properties well converged. Table 1 shows the variations of the bond length, surface energy, adsorption energy of H* on the (110) and VBM and CBM with the slab thickness. Bond lengths LM–S-∥, LM–S-⊥ and LH–M vary within 0.01 Å and Es and ΔEH*(M) vary within 0.01 eV as the slab thickness increases from 7 to 15 layers. VBM also shows rapid convergence with the slab thickness. However, CBM changes a lot due to the notable quantum confinement effect.30 To address this problem, the flat band potentials were taken as CBMs as described in Section 2.1.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Surface terminations
To determine the relative stability of different surface terminations in the electrochemical environment, the free energies of reactions (b)–(d) need be determined using eqn (3)–(5). The structures, adsorption energies and ZPEs for relevant adsorption geometries were presented; then the relative stability of different terminations was determined according to the calculated reaction free energy. For completeness, the results for the adsorption geometry of H*(M or S) were also presented.
The optimized adsorption geometries for CdS(110) were obtained and are shown in Fig. 1(B–I) and 2(A–H). A majority of these geometries are similar when increasing the slab size from 1 × 1 to 2 × 2 except for H*(S) and HO*(S). The surface Cd–S bonds were broken in the H*(S) and HO*(S) geometries with the 1 × 1 slab, as indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 1(C and E), whereas these bonds became intact with the 2 × 2 slab in Fig. 2(B and D). Lower coverages of H* and HO* facilitate the movement of surface S atoms, leading to the intact surface Cd–S bonds. The corresponding adsorption geometries for ZnS(110) were also obtained and are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI.† Unlike CdS(110), all adsorption geometries for ZnS(110) are similar between the 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 slabs. For example, the surface Zn–S bond in the H*(S) geometry was always broken even when the slab size was increased to 2 × 3, and the surface Zn–S bond in the HO*(S) geometry was kept intact. The adsorption geometries for ZnS(110) were less affected by the coverage of adsorbates than for CdS(110), which may be contributed to the smaller lattice constant and a stronger bond in ZnS. The length of M–S bonds on the surface in various adsorption geometries is summarized in Table S1 of the ESI.† Comparing these bonds with the corresponding bonds of pure (110), as shown in Table 1, it can be found that the adsorption site moved away from both the sublayer and the other atoms in the topmost layer after adsorption of species. The stretched bonds in various adsorption geometries suggest less stable structures due to the bonding between the adsorption site and species.
 Fig. 2  Optimized adsorption geometries for CdS(110) with the 2 × 2 slab: (A) H*(Cd), (B) H*(S), (C) HO*(Cd), (D) HO*(S), (E) O*(Cd), (F) O*(S), (G) H*(Cd)/HO*(S) and (H) H*(S)/HO*(Cd). 
The adsorption energies (ΔE) were calculated using eqn (2) and (6)–(8), and are presented in Fig. 1 and 2 for CdS(110) and in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) for ZnS(110). All calculated adsorption energies are positive, indicating relatively weak binding of adsorbates to the surface with respect to dissociation of free H2 and H2O molecules. The nonpolar zinc-blende (110) follows the electron counting model43 and is insulating,30 and thus making a bond between the adsorbate and the surface difficult. A preference for different surface sites was found for adsorption of H*, HO* and O* species. The anion site is favored for the H* and O* adsorption, while the cation site is favored for the HO* adsorption. The preference can be attributed to the occurrence of lone electrons which induced the net magnetic moment (μ) in a geometry. The geometry with a larger magnetic moment is usually less stable, as shown in Fig. 1(B–G) and 2(A–F) for CdS(110) and in Fig. S1 and S2(A–F) (ESI†) for ZnS(110).
The simultaneous adsorption of the H* and HO* species on (110) is further stabilized with respect to the two individual adsorption. The magnetic moments are zero for H*(M)/HO*(S) and H*(S)/HO*(M), as shown in Fig. 1(H and I) and 2(G and H) for CdS(110) and in Fig. S1 and S2(G and H) (ESI†) for ZnS(110). Meanwhile, the bonds of the adsorbates with the surface were shortened with respect to the bonds in H*(M or S) and HO*(S or M). Between the two simultaneous adsorption, H*(S)/HO*(M) is much more stable than H*(M)/HO*(S).
To calculate the reaction free energy (ΔG), the ZPE and entropy contributions need to be determined. The ZPEs for the H2 and H2O molecules and various species adsorbed on (110) were derived from the vibrational frequencies calculated by diagonalization of the Hessian matrix.44 The ZPEs for the adsorbates are summarized in Table 2, as well as those for rutile TiO2,37 and α-Fe2O3.44 Basically, ZPE becomes larger as the species binds to the surface more strongly, due to the larger force constant of the stronger bond. The ZPE for the geometry of H*(M)/HO*(S) or H*(S)/HO*(M) is larger than the sum of the ZPEs for H*(M or S) and HO*(S or M), indicating the stronger bonds of the adsorbates formed in H*(M)/HO*(S) or H*(S)/HO*(M), which is consistent with the results of adsorption energy. The ZPEs calculated here agree with those from previous studies on rutile TiO2 and α-Fe2O3. However, the ZPEs for H*(M) are much smaller than that of 0.17 eV reported for H* adsorbed on metal,45 due to the weaker H–M bonds on the CdS and ZnS(110). For the entropy contributions of the gaseous H2 and H2O molecules at 298 K, the thermodynamic data from experiments were taken.46 The entropy contributions of the adsorbates were so small that they can be safely neglected, as validated by Hellman et al.44

The free energies of reactions (b–d) at pH = 0 and U = 0 are listed in Table 3. It can be found that HO*(M), O*(S), and H*(S)/HO*(M) are more stable at any solution pH, bias potential and adsorbate coverage than HO*(S), O*(M) and H*(M)/HO*(S), respectively. Fig. 3 shows the reaction free energies calculated with HO*(M), O*(S), and H*(S)/HO*(M) as a function of the bias potential at pH = 0 and 14. At cathodic potentials, the most stable termination is the pure (110) with an H2O, and the next one is H*(S)/HO*(M). Only at relatively anodic potentials the adsorption geometries of HO*(M) and O*(S) can be stabilized. HO*(M) and O*(S) can be stabilized more easily in an alkaline solution, suggesting that the water dissociation on the (110) is preferred in the alkaline solution. At the potentials equivalent to the CBM of CdS and ZnS, the pure (110) with an H2O is the most stable surface termination which will occur in the photocatalytic HER.

The potentials at pH = 14 were derived with a slope of 33 mV pH−1.13 
3.2 HER on pure and Pt(110)
Possible adsorption sites of H* intermediates on the pure and Pt loaded (110) were explored at first. The adsorption energies calculated with eqn (2) are shown in Table S2 (ESI†), as well as the bond length and net magnetic moment. For pure (110), the H* adsorption at the S site is favored as indicated in Section 3.1. After Pt loading, the adsorption energies of H* at both anion and cation sites were lowered, which was accompanied by the decrease in the bond length or magnetic moment. The geometries of H* on the Pt loaded (110) with smaller adsorption energies are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). Among these geometries, the adsorption of H* at the Pt site is the strongest. The adsorption energy of H* on a single Pt atom (0.07 eV) is weaker than that of about −0.4 eV/(H atom) for H* on (111) of metallic Pt, but the H–Pt bond length is close to that of H* binding at atop site of Pt(111).47 We expected that the adsorption energy of H* on Pt nanocrystals loaded CdS or ZnS in typical experiments would be between the two end values. We also compared the Bader charges calculated for the Pt atom loaded (110) without and with H* adsorption, the structures of which are exhibited in Fig. 4(d) for CdS(110) and in Fig. S3(d) (ESI†) for ZnS(110). After H* binding to the Pt site, the Bader charge on Pt was reduced from −0.17 to −0.07 and −0.25 to −0.17 for the CdS and ZnS(110), respectively. Meanwhile, the Bader charge on H was −0.04 and −0.05. The results suggested that some of the electron charge was transferred from Pt to H when the H–Pt bond was formed.

Two types of surface Cd atoms and four types of surface S atoms were distinguished on the Pt loaded (110). The adsorption energy, bond length and magnetic moment were presented for each geometry. 
According to the Sabatier principle, the free energy of H* adsorption (ΔGH*) on a good HER catalyst should be close to zero, which facilitates both adsorption of H* and desorption of H2, as demonstrated by a quantitative relation established between ΔGH* and the exchange current density.33 ΔGH* on the pure and Pt loaded (110) were calculated with the most stable geometries of H*(S) and H*(Pt) without and with photo-assistance at pH = 0 and 14, as shown in Fig. 5. The increase in solution pH hindered H* adsorption by an increase of 59 meV pH−1 in the free energy. Without photo-assistance and Pt loading, ΔGH*s are very high at both pH, indicating that the insulating CdS or ZnS(110) itself is not a good electrocatalyst. Pt loading dramatically reduced the free energy, suggesting a better electrocatalytic activity than pure (110).
 Fig. 5  Free energy diagrams for HER on the pure and Pt loaded CdS and ZnS(110) without and with photo-assistance, i.e., U = 0 and the potentials equivalent to the CBM versus NHE: (a) −0.62 V at pH = 0 and (b) −1.08 V at pH = 14 for CdS; (c) −1.55 V at pH = 0 and (d) −2.01 V at pH = 14 for ZnS. 
H* adsorption was facilitated with photo-assistance by generating highly reductive electrons at the CBM state. At pH = 0 and under visible light irradiation upon CdS (i.e. U = −0.62 V), ΔGH* on the Pt loaded (110) was lowered to −0.28 eV which is closer to 0 than 0.64 eV on pure (110), indicating that Pt loading favors the photocatalytic HER on CdS. At pH = 14 and under irradiation (i.e. U = −1.08 V), the promotion effect of Pt loading is even more pronounced with the free energy of 0.09 eV much smaller than 1.01 eV on the pure (110). These results rationalized the experimental facts that CdS itself is an inactive photocatalyst, and both Pt co-catalyst and high pH greatly enhance the efficiency of hydrogen evolution.5,7,9–12 As for ZnS, at pH = 0 and under ultraviolet irradiation (i.e. U = −1.55 V), ΔGH* is 0.37 eV for H* on pure (110) but −1.21 eV on the Pt loaded (110). H* binds to the Pt site too strong to make a noticeable improvement on the hydrogen evolution. As a result, pure (110) is more efficient than the Pt loaded (110) in the photocatalytic HER on ZnS. At pH = 14 and under irradiation (i.e. U = −2.01 V), ΔGH* were 0.74 and −0.84 eV on the pure and Pt loaded (110), respectively, suggesting the Pt loaded (110) makes a moderate contribution to the efficiency improvement. These results explain well the experimental facts that ZnS itself is active in photocatalytic HER and Pt loading moderately promote the efficiency of hydrogen evolution.15–17
From the analyses above, it can be concluded that the lower CBM for CdS favors the photocatalytic HER on the Pt loaded (110), but the higher CBM for ZnS favors the photocatalytic HER on pure (110). This result also suggests an explanation for the photocatalytic HER on some ZnS-based solid solutions, such as CdS–ZnS,25,48 ZnS–AgInS2,18 ZnS–CuInS2.19 As the content of the component with a smaller band gap increased in the solid solutions, the effect of the Pt cocatalyst on the efficiency of hydrogen evolution became more prominent in general. For example, the enhancement of hydrogen evolution by Pt loading over (Zn0.95Cu0.5)1−xCdxS gradually increased by 1 to 10 times with the Cd content increasing from 0 to 1.48 A similar variation was also observed as the content of AgInS2 with a band gap of 1.8 eV (or CuInS2 with a band gap of 1.4 eV) increased in (AgIn)xZn1−xS2 (or (CuIn)xZn1−xS2).18,19
4. Conclusions
In summary, we studied various adsorption geometries of an H2O dissociation on CdS and ZnS(110), and determined the relative stability of relevant surface terminations under the photocatalytic conditions. A preference for different surface sites was found for HO*, O* and both H* and HO* species on (110). Pure (110) was demonstrated to be the most stable termination under the photocatalytic conditions for both CdS and ZnS. We then explained the divergent behaviors observed in the photocatalytic HER on CdS and ZnS by calculating the free energy of H* adsorption (ΔGH*) on the pure and Pt loaded (110). The S and Pt sites were identified as the stable site for H* adsorption on the pure and Pt loaded (110), respectively. Pure (110) is not believed to be a good electrocatalyst for both CdS and ZnS since ΔGH* on the pure (110) is large. However, Pt loading on the (110) essentially lower ΔGH*. The performance of photocatalytic HER was determined jointly by the free energy of H* adsorption and the CBM of photocatalysts. On the pure (110) with large ΔGH*, the photocatalytic HER is favored on ZnS due to its higher CBM. For example, ΔGH* was effectively reduced to 0.37 eV at pH = 0 and 0.74 eV at pH = 14 with the CBM for ZnS considered, while ΔGH* was still 0.64 eV at pH = 0 and 1.01 eV at pH = 14 with the CBM for CdS considered. This result rationalized the experimental facts that ZnS itself is active in the photocatalytic HER but CdS is not. On Pt loaded (110) with small ΔGH*, the photocatalytic HER is favored on CdS due to its lower CBM. For example, ΔGH* was reduced to −0.28 eV at pH = 0 and 0.09 eV at pH = 14 with the CBM for CdS, but ΔGH* was −1.21 eV at pH = 0 and −0.84 eV at pH = 14 with the CBM for ZnS. The higher CBM for ZnS created too strong binding between H* and the Pt site. This result agreed well with the different effect of Pt cocatalysts on the promotion of hydrogen evolution on CdS and ZnS. Those results obtained for CdS and ZnS can also be extended to explain the photocatalytic HER on the relevant solid solutions.
