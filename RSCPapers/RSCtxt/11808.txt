1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite materials (CH3NH3PbA3 or CH3NH3PbA3−xBx; A, B = I, Cl, Br) are attracting great attention and are being widely studied in solar cells due to their excellent advantages including low cost, solution processability, and superb photovoltaic performance. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been dramatically improved from 3.8% in the first report to over 20% recently,1,2 revealing their potential as candidates for the next-generation solar cells. The morphology of perovskite thin film plays a very important role in determining the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and many efforts have been carried out to optimize perovskite thin film to obtain highly efficient PSCs.3–5 Normally, one-step and two-step deposition techniques are used to fabricate perovskite thin films.6 In one-step deposition, solvent-engineering technology or a gas-quenching process is often necessary to further improve the quality of perovskite thin films, resulting in efficient PSCs.7–13 Two-step deposition involves a deposition of a lead halide layer first, and subsequently the deposition of methylammonium halide or dipping the lead halide layer into the solution of methylammonium halide, which would further react to form perovskite materials during post-treatment.14–18
Perovskite nanowires (PNWs) are also attracting researchers’ interest due to PNW-based solar cells and photodetectors that have been fabricated successfully.19–22 Normally, the dendrite perovskite crystals are easily formed in perovskite thin film,10 suggesting that perovskite crystallites tend to grow uniformly along one of the crystallographic directions, i.e., the formation of PNWs. The CH3NH3PbI3 NWs were first reported by Horváth et al., in which CH3NH3PbI3 NWs were prepared from a low-temperature solution using a simple slip-coating method.20 The PNW-based photodetectors were further fabricated with a responsivity of about 5 mA W−1 and a response time of 500 μs, which is ∼104 faster than the state-of-the-art photodetectors made of monolayer MoS2.20 Im et al. prepared CH3NH3PbI3 NWs using a two-step spin-coating procedure.21 It was found that the addition of a small quantity of a polar aprotic DMF solvent in the isopropanol solution of CH3NH3I could lead to the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 NW thin film, which was further used to fabricate PNW-based PSCs, resulting in a PCE of 14.71%.
As discussed above, PNWs have been applied to solar cells and photodetectors and have shown potential applications in transistors, light-emitting diodes, and so on. However, it is very challenging to fabricate highly oriented, large-area PNW arrays to extend their applications and accelerate their commercialization. In this work, we report the fabrication of highly oriented, large-area, ultra-long CH3NH3PbI3 NW arrays using either large-scale roll-to-roll (R2R) printing or doctor blading approaches via a one-step solution processing on flexible substrate polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in ambient environment (humility ∼45%, temperature ∼28 °C). Furthermore, photodetectors based on these PNWs were fabricated and have shown reasonable performance. This study provides low-cost, large-scale techniques, matching with industrial process, to efficiently fabricate PNWs that show great applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices, especially in flexible devices.
2. Experimental details
Methylammonium lead iodide perovskite precursor solution was prepared by mixing methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, 99%, Jingge, Wuhan) and lead iodide (PbI2, 99%, Zhenpin, Shanghai) at a molar ratio of 1:1 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) with the specified concentrations. The precursor solutions were stirred at 40 °C for 2 h for the subsequent deposition.
Both flexible PET and hard SiO2 were used as substrates. Two large-scale techniques, i.e., R2R micro-gravure printing and doctor blading, were used to produce highly oriented, large-area PNWs. The R2R fabrication was processed using a self-developed R2R multi-function printer (Fig. 1a and S1 in the ESI†), and the details are discussed below. The plate doctor blading was processed using a commercial machine (ZN320, Maosen, Fujian) as shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The stainless steel blade is a rectangular bar with a blading angle of 45°, and the blading speed is fixed at 1 m min−1. The thickness or density of PNWs can be controlled by the solution concentration of perovskite precursor and the distance between the blade and the substrate. The thickness precision of wet film is about 10 μm. Perovskite precursor solution was first dropped on PET or SiO2 substrate, and then was spread to form perovskite thin film by doctor blading. PNWs gradually formed in the perovskite thin films fabricated by R2R printing or doctor blading coating during solvent evaporation in ambient environment (humidity ∼45% and ∼28 °C), and subsequent treatment at 100 °C for 10 min in glove box to accelerate the complete formation of perovskite structure for CH3NH3PbI3. All the processes except thermal annealing were carried out in ambient environments.

(d) A photo of R2R printing process for producing perovskite thin films with highly oriented, large-area PNWs. 
The morphology and formation process of PNWs were characterized using an optical microscope (DNN-200C, Caikang, Shanghai) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Helios Nanolab 600i, USA). The PNW structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D, Max 2500, Japan).
PNW-based photodetectors were prepared on both PET and SiO2 substrates by depositing Au electrode (∼40 nm) with a shadow mask via thermal evaporation under a vacuum of ∼4 × 10−6 mbar. The active channels were 80 μm in width and 1 mm in length. The photo-response performance was measured using a probe station connected to a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer under ambient conditions. The illuminating light source was a white light with an intensity of 36 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
Micro-gravure printing was used to fabricate PNWs using a self-developed R2R multi-function printer (Fig. 1a and S1†). The printing machine is composed of a cleaning unit, deviation adjusting unit, corona unit, drying units, micro-gravure printing unit, unwinding roller, rewinding roller, tension-sensor rollers, traction roller, and several transfer rollers. The web moves with the help of a traction roller, which moves at the same speed. The printing parameters were first optimized through a series of experiments. A five-strip patterned micro-gravure roller was engraved with a line density of 80 lines per cm, a spiral rib angle of 45° and a depth of 45 μm (Fig. 1b and c). Based on the specified solution concentrations, both micro-gravure printing roller speed and web speed were used to control the formation and the thickness of perovskite thin film. The ratio of micro-gravure printing roller speed and web speed (R = printing roller speed/web speed) was used to control the amount of solution transferred to the web. The web speed was fixed at 0.2 m min−1, and the micro-gravure printing roller speed was controlled to meet the specified R. Then, the micro-gravure printed perovskite thin film goes through an oven, in which the temperature was heated up to 150 °C to accelerate solvent evaporation and drying of the printed thin film. Normally, a temperature of about 80 °C was used to dry the printed perovskite thin film on PET substrate. Fig. 1d shows the photo of micro-gravure printed perovskite thin film composed of PNWs with five strips.
One typical photo of R2R micro-gravure printed CH3NH3PbI3 NWs on PET substrate and the surface morphologies of different areas are shown in Fig. 2. The strips of CH3NH3PbI3 NW thin films were fabricated based on a patterned printing roller, of which the strip is 13 mm in width, and the gap is 2 mm. Two areas were formed, labeled as A and B in Fig. 2a. The area A starts from the border and extends to the centre of stripes, in which highly oriented CH3NH3PbI3 NWs could be obtained, as showed in Fig. 2b. The width of area A could be controlled to be from about 1 mm to 3 mm, and the length is dependent on the substrate length, which is normally tens of meters. The width of area A, i.e., the width of highly oriented PNWs, could be controlled using printing parameters and solution concentration. The area B is in the centre of stripes with a width of about 8 mm, in which there are random PNWs with length ranging from 1 μm to hundreds of micrometers, as shown in Fig. 2c. Furthermore, the obvious border between area A and area B can be observed (Fig. 2d).

(b–d) Optical microscopy morphology images of highly oriented PNWs (A area in (a)), random PNWs (B area in (a)), and the PNWs at the border of A and B areas in (a), respectively. 
Normally, the printing rate is a very important factor influencing thin film quality. Our previous work23 found that web speed fixed at 0.2–0.3 m min−1 produces high-performance film for this printing machine. The ratio of printing roller speed to web speed, R, is used to describe the printing rate, in which the web speed was fixed at 0.2 m min−1. The R2R experiment results showed that the R obviously influences the density of highly oriented PNWs, as shown in Fig. 3. The printed PNW film becomes thicker with increasing R, resulting in denser PNWs. Meanwhile, the length of PNWs increased with increasing R as well. The increased R comes from the enhancement of roller speed under a fixed web speed, which would provide more CH3NH3PbI3 ink onto the PET substrate, resulting in enhanced PNW density and increased PNW length.

All the images have the same scale bar. The increased R resulted in the enhancement of PNW density. 
On the other hand, doctor blading was used to prepare CH3NH3PbI3 NWs on both flexible PET and hard SiO2 substrates as well. The solution was spread on the substrate, and the doctor blade was used to spread the solution on the substrate (printing speed: 60 cm min−1), resulting in the formation of a uniform thin film. Then, CH3NH3PbI3 NWs were formed by self-assembly during solvent evaporation. The photo and morphology images of CH3NH3PbI3 NWs prepared using doctor blading with the precursor concentrations of 400 mg ml−1 on PET substrate are shown in Fig. 4. Highly oriented, large-area PNWs were formed, which is similar to the R2R micro-gravure-printed PNWs. PNWs with lengths up to 15 mm were obtained (Fig. 4a). Precursors at different concentrations also produced highly oriented PNWs via doctor blading (Fig. S3 in ESI†). Meanwhile, highly oriented PNWs were obtained as well using SiO2 instead of flexible PET as the substrate, as shown in Fig. 4c–d.

The solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly process can lead the growth of PNWs along the direction of [100] crystal plane.22 During the evaporation of polar solvent DMF at the earlier stage, the PbI2 forms a [PbI6]4− octahedral layer and accelerates the formation of a three-layer structure of PbI2–CH3NH3I–DMF.24,25 Under further evaporation of DMF, the CH3NH3PbI3 with a perovskite structure is formed, resulting in the formation of PNWs. The growth of highly oriented, large-area PNWs arrays was followed by in situ optical microscopy, as shown in Fig. 5 and the video in the ESI.† The growth rate of PNWs is very fast, calculated to be about 7 μm s−1. As shown in Fig. 5 and Video S1,† the edge of the substrate serves as the site to induce nucleation of PNWs. The perovskite solution deposited at the edge has a larger exposed surface, which results in faster solvent evaporation. Thus it leads to the earlier formation of supersaturated solution. Then, it starts to nucleate at the edge and grow large and long PNWs. Because of the strong interactions among perovskite molecules and the property of perovskite tetragonal structure, the crystals grow along the [100] direction due to the lowest surface energy.22 The schematic of PNWs’ growth process is shown in Fig. 5e.

XRD experiments were used to prove the crystal structures of PNWs obtained from by micro-gravure printing and doctor blading on PET and SiO2 substrates. The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 6. The typical tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 peaks can be observed in PNW arrays fabricated on both PET and SiO2 substrates.11,12 The strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 13.98°, 28.22°, and 31.67° appear in all samples, which respectively represent the (110), (220) and (310) planes of CH3NH3PbI3 crystal. As shown in Fig. 7a, PET substrate has a strong diffraction peak due to crystallization. Both XRD patterns showed that the diffraction peaks coming from CH3NH3PbI3 could be observed even for pristine CH3NH3PbI3 NWs thin films without thermal annealing. This suggests that most PNWs formed during the evaporation of solvent are already perovskite in structure. Meanwhile, impurity peaks, i.e., PbI2 peaks, were also observed because of the incomplete conversion. The further annealing process at 100 °C in the glove box accelerates the full formation of PNWs, and the diffraction peak of PbI2 disappears accordingly. However, the storage of PNWs in air with a humidity of about 45% results in the decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 and the formation of PbI2, as shown in curve (vi) in Fig. 6b. The crystallinity decreased as well, based on the diffraction intensities, as compared with curve (i) and curve (vi).

Furthermore, photodetector devices based on these CH3NH3PbI3 NWs were fabricated. Fig. 7 shows the I–V and I–t curves under repetitive switching of light at a bias of 10 V based on PNWs prepared on PET and SiO2 substrate, respectively. Based on the analysis of the experiment results, the photosensitivity (Ilight/Idark) is about 100 at 36 mW cm−2, and the photoresponsivity PR can be described by the equation PR = (Iillu − Idark)/PinA, in which Iillu is the current under illumination, Idark is the current in the dark, A is the area of the active region between two Au electrodes under illumination, and Pin is the illumination intensity. So the PR of the photodetector fabricated on SiO2 is about 5.20 mA W−1, while the PR of the photodetector fabricated on PET is about 2.00 mA W−1. As discussed above, the PNW-based photodetectors fabricated by R2R micro-gravure printing and doctor blading showed moderate performance without further optimization.
4. Conclusion
Highly oriented, large-area CH3NH3PbI3 NW arrays were fabricated by large-scale R2R micro-gravure printing and doctor blading techniques on both flexible PET and hard SiO2 substrates. The length, size and density of PNWs could be controlled by varying the fabrication parameters and CH3NH3PbI3 concentration. CH3NH3PbI3 NWs of up to 15 mm length were obtained. XRD results proved that PNWs with perovskite structure are formed during the evaporation of solvent, and further thermal annealing accelerated the full formation of PNWs. The in situ observation suggested that the growth of PNWs is a solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly process. Furthermore, PNW-based photodetectors fabricated by R2R printing and doctor blading showed a reasonable photoresponse performance with the photosensitivity of about 100 at 36 mW cm−2, as well as the photoresponsivity of 5.2 mA W−1 and 2.00 mA W−1 on SiO2 and flexible PET substrate, respectively. The research suggests that low-cost, large-scale R2R printing or doctor blading techniques could be used to fabricate large-area PNW arrays that show great potential applications in flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Photo of self-developed R2R multi-function printer, with a length of 2.5 m and a height of 1.6 m, which was used to fabricate large-scale PNW arrays. (b) Photo of micro-gravure printer roller with a five-stripe pattern, of which the engraved strip is 13 mm in width and the gap is 2 mm. (c) Optical microscope image of engraved micro-gravure printer roller with a line density of 80 lines per cm, a spiral rib angle of 45° and a depth of 45 μm. (d) A photo of R2R printing process for producing perovskite thin films with highly oriented, large-area PNWs.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Photo of micro-gravure printed PNWs on PET substrate with a precursor concentration of 400 mg ml−1 and a R of 1.1. (b–d) Optical microscopy morphology images of highly oriented PNWs (A area in (a)), random PNWs (B area in (a)), and the PNWs at the border of A and B areas in (a), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  Optical microscopy morphology images of CH3NH3PbI3 NWs fabricated by R2R micro-gravure printing a 150 mg ml−1 solution at the R of 0.5, 0.8, 1.1, and 1.3, respectively, in which the web speed was fixed at 0.2 m min−1. All the images have the same scale bar. The increased R resulted in the enhancement of PNW density.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a–b) Photo and optical microscopy images of CH3NH3PbI3 NWs prepared via doctor blading on flexible PET substrate with a precursor concentration of 400 mg ml−1, respectively. (c–d) SEM images of CH3NH3PbI3 NWs prepared via doctor blading on SiO2 substrate with a precursor concentration of 400 mg ml−1.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a–d) In situ growth process of PNWs observed by optical microscopy. (a) t = 0 s, (b) t = 20 s, (c) t = 40 s, (d) t = 85. All the images have the same scale bar. (e) Schematic of the growth process of highly oriented PNWs.	 

 	Fig. 6  XRD patterns of printed CH3NH3PbI3 NWs on (a) PET and (b) SiO2 substrates, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a–b) The photo-response performance of PNW-based photodetectors fabricated by R2R micro-gravure printing on PET substrate. (c–d) The photo-response performance of PNW-based photodetectors fabricated by doctor blading on SiO2 substrate.
