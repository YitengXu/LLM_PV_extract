    , Accepted 1st March 2011First published on 25th March 2011AbstractDevelopment of an electrode material with high capacity and good cyclability at a high charge and discharge rate, has become an important issue for present battery technology. Most electrode materials exhibit reduced capacity and larger capacity fading at high rates. We report a self-assembled echinus-like nanostructure consisting of mesoporous CoO nanorod@carbon nanotube core–shell materials in this work, which exhibits high capacities and excellent cycling performances at various high and low current rates, when used as anode materials for rechargeable lithium ion batteries. In particular, this core–shell nanostructure shows high capacities (703–746 mAh g−1 in 200 cycles) and a long cycle life (0.029% capacity loss per cycle) at a high current rate (3580 mA g−1). The excellent electrochemical energy storage should be attributed to the increased electrical conductivity, mechanical stability and electrochemical activity of porous CoO materials in the presence of a carbon nanotube overlayer.
1 Introduction
It is very important to develop an advanced energy-storage system with high energy density and long cycle life since today's society is facing an energy crisis. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have been widely used as a dominant portable power source for consumer electronic devices. Recently, the electrification of vehicles has driven up the increasing demand for Li-ion batteries at high charge and discharge rates,1–4 which may also provide a back-up for intermittent renewable solar or wind energy. Graphite is the current commercial anode material for lithium-ion batteries, however its capacity is limited by a theoretical value (372 mAh g−1).5 In the last decade, extensive efforts have been made to search for alternative anode materials with higher gravimetric and volumetric capacity.1–5 Transition-metal oxides, such as cobalt oxide, nickel oxide, copper oxide and iron oxide, have been proposed as such promising anodes, because they can exhibit reversible capacities about 2–3 times larger than graphite.6 Among these transition-metal oxides, cobalt oxide (Co3O4 or CoO) is the most promising anode to display the highest capacity and best cycling performance.6
The high discharge–charge rate performance is the essential factor in the design and development of electrode materials that meet the requirement of advanced Li-ion batteries for electrical vehicles.1,3 There has been an increasing interest in using nanomaterials to improve the slow diffusion of Li-ion in electrode materials,4–19 which is the major problem for poor high-rate electrochemical performances.3 A number of research works have reported about cobalt oxides anode nanomaterials including nanotubes,11–13nanowires,13–15 nanobelts,16,17 nanoneedles,18platelets,10,19,20 nanocapsules,21 and carbon–cobalt oxide nanocomposites.9,22–28 Recently, there have been more reports also concerning the rate performances of cobalt oxides14–17,19–20 and carbon–cobalt oxide composites.9,24,25 In particular, mesoporous Co3O4 nanowire arrays14 and nanobelt17 anodes could deliver substantially enhanced rate capabilities compared to cobalt oxides particles or carbon–cobalt oxide composites,9,24,25 which has been largely attributed to the unique porous nanostructure of electrode materials. It was noted that although reversible capacities could be retained at large values in the first few cycles at high rates, these cobalt oxide anode materials still displayed fast capacity fading during the prolonged cycles.14,17
Herein, a new cobalt oxide-based nanostructure, namely a self-assembled echinus-like nanostructure consisting of many amorphous carbon nanotube-encapsulated mesoporous CoO nanorods (CoO@CNT), is reported in this work. This nanostructure was prepared by a stepwise hydrothermal technique with good control of structure yield, structure uniformity and composite composition and size. Their lithium-ion storage properties were also explored, and excellent electrochemical properties (high capacity and extremely long cycle life) were found for this core–shell porous nanostructure at both high and low charge and discharge rates.
2 Experimental
Materials preparation
All the reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. In a typical experiment, 2 mmol each of cobalt chloride (CoCl2·6H2O), urea (CO(NH2)2), and glucose (C6H12O6·H2O) were dissolved in distilled water to form a 50 ml clear mixed pink solution under strong magnetic stirring. The solution was then transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 110 °C for 12 h, followed by further heating at 180 °C for 12 h. After cooling down naturally in air, the intermediate product (Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O with a carbon-rich polysaccharide overlayer, CCCH@CP) was harvested by washing with distilled water and drying. This intermediate product was calcined in air at 250 °C for 15 min, and then further carbonized in N2 at 450 °C for 2 h to obtain the final product (CoO@CNT). Pristine CoO nanorods were prepared by the following process, which is similar to CoO@CNT but in the absence of glucose: the solution containing CoCl2·6H2O and CO(NH2)2 was reacted at 110 °C for 12 h, followed by calcination in N2 at 450 °C for 2 h.
Material characterization
The products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2550V, CuKα radiation), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6700F), and transmission electron microscopy/selected area electron diffraction/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM/SAED/EDS, JEOL JEM-200CX and JEM-2010F) and CHN elemental analysis (VARIO EL111, Germany). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a TGA 2050 thermogravimetric analyzer.
Electrochemical measurements
An N-methylpyrrolidinone slurry consisting of 80 wt.% of active materials, 10 wt.% each of conductivity agent (carbon black) and binder (polyvinylidene difluoride) was uniformly applied to copper foil (0.7 mm in thickness). The coated foil was cut into disk electrodes (11 mm in diameter). The electrodes were vacuum dried overnight at 130 °C, followed by compression at 2.0 × 106 Pa. They were then assembled into Li test cells using lithium foil as the negative electrode, a microporous polypropylene separator, and an electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6 in a 1:1 w/w mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate. The swagelok cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, where both the moisture and oxygen contents were below 1 ppm. Electrochemical measurements were performed in a LAND-CT2001A test system. The cells were discharged (lithium insertion) and charged (lithium extraction) at a constant current of 71.6 mA g−1 (0.1 C, 1 C = 716 mA g−1) in the fixed voltage range of 0.005–3.0 V. Higher hourly rates (0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C) were also used and the first cycle discharging were all kept at 0.1 C. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out on a CH Instruments electrochemical workstation (model 660D) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.
3 Results and discussion
The crystallographic structures of the intermediate product after hydrothermal heating at 110 °C and 180 °C, and the final product after calcination in air at 250 °C and in N2 at 450 °C were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) in Fig. 1a. All the characteristic peaks of the intermediate product were assigned to crystalline cobalt chloride carbonate hydroxide hydrate (CCCH, Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10·1.74H2O) (JCPDS 38-0547).17,29 The carbon-rich polysaccharide layers (CP layers) derived from glucose were amorphous after hydrothermal treatment, which agrees well with previous reports.30,31 In this work, a temperature of 450 °C was chosen as the carbonation temperature, because the carbon-rich polysaccharide has been suggested to be carbonized at a temperature as low as 400 °C.30,31 When the intermediate product was calcined directly in N2 at 450 °C, the carbothermal reduction reaction led to the formation of cubic Co (JCPDS 15-0806) as shown in Fig. 1a. The Co element has no ability for lithium-ion storage. Therefore, the intermediate product was pre-heated in air at 250 °C, in which Co3O4 was formed first, before further carbonization in N2 at 450 °C. In the final product, almost all diffraction peaks (Fig. 1a) were indexed to the cubic CoO (JCPDS 48-1719),15,25 there was a trace of a characteristic diffraction peak of Co3O4 at ∼65.2°. Elemental analysis showed that carbon was ∼8.5 wt.% in the final composite (CoO@CNT). The corresponding TGA curve of CoO@CNT is provided in the supporting information 1.†

          XRD patterns of the products (a): the intermediate product of cobalt chloride carbonate hydroxide with a carbon-rich polysaccharide overlayer (CCCH@CP nanorods) (a1); Co@CNT (a2); CoO@CNT (a3). The intermediate product of CCCH@CP nanorods with echinus-like morphology: SEM images (b–c); and TEM images (d–g). 
The SEM and TEM images of the typical intermediate product (CCCH@CP) after hydrothermal heating are shown in Fig. 1b–c and Fig. 1d–g, respectively, and in supporting information 2.† A number of nanorods were self-assembled into echinus-like morphology (Fig. 1b and d). These nanorods were around 80–150 nm in diameter and ∼2–5 μm in length. As shown in the TEM imagesFig. 1f–g, the intermediate product did indeed have a core–shell structure. A thin overlayer of carbon-rich polysaccharide was observed, with a thickness of ∼5–10 nm. It should be noted that tip sections of these nanorods were needle-like, with smaller diameters of ∼15–25 nm. The hydrothermal preparation was divided into two steps (110 °C for 12 h, followed by 180 °C for 12 h). If the experiment was performed directly at 180 °C for 12 h without pre-treatment at 110 °C, nanorods were obtained with diameters of ∼20 nm (Fig. 2a–b), which were much smaller than the product as shown in Fig. 1b–g. In addition, the overlayer of the carbon-rich polysaccharide or carbon may be too thin to be viewed in Fig. 2a–b, which was different to the observation of an obvious overlayer in the previous product with pre-heating(Fig. 1f–g). The hydrothermal time at 180 °C was investigated in the range of 0–12 h, whilst keeping other experimental conditions identical. After hydrothermal heating at 110 °C for 12 h, the intermediate product was pink in color, indicating that the carbon-rich polysaccharide layer was not formed at this low temperature.30,31 The pink color did not change when heated at 180 °C for 1 h. After the hydrothermal time was increased to more than 2 h, the product became brown/black, revealing the formation of a polysaccharide layer. The presence of the polysaccharide material may help to hinder the growth of nanorods, resulting in products with smaller diameters (Fig. 2a–b), which were prepared by direct hydrothermal heating at 180 °C. Fig. 2c shows the product after reaction at 180 °C for 4 h, with no obvious morphology change observed, compared to the final intermediate product (CCCH@CP) after reaction for 12 h (Fig. 1b–g). The concentration of CoCl2 precursor and the molar ratio of cobalt chloride to glucose were also explored in this work. With higher concentrations of 0.1 M glucose, 0.1 M CoCl2 and 0.1 M urea, the products were composed of a few nanorods and a lot of micrometer-sized spheres (Fig. 2d). If the molar ratio of glucose to cobalt chloride was increased to 2:1 (0.08 M glucose and 0.04 M CoCl2, 0.04M urea), most of the products were also sphere-like, as shown in Fig. 2e. It appears that glucose concentration is crucial to the formation of the core–shell nanorod structure. Fig. 2f and supporting information 3,† show the pristine CoO nanorods (∼100 nm in diameters) prepared in the absence of glucose. Based on these experimental results, it is suggested that the CCCH@CP core–shell structure was formed by a glucose-derived carbonaceous coating process.30 The CCCH nanorods could be formed at 110 °C, however the CP layer could only be formed at the relatively high temperature of 180 °C. Heating at 110 °C in the absence of the CP layer led to the growth of nanorods (diameters of ∼80–150 nm), which was also beneficial to the formation of coated stable CP layers at 180 °C. In the hydrothermal process, these core–shell nanorods were self-assembled into echinus-like nanostructures, which are similar to urchin-like structures of cobalt basic salts in the presence of block copolymer.32

The self-assembled echinus-like nanostructures of CCCH@CP nanorods were converted to CoO@CNT materials after calcination in air and then in N2. There was no substantial morphology change in this process. As shown in the SEM images and TEM imagesFig. 3a–b and 3c–e, respectively, and supporting information 4,† the echinus-like nanostructures consisting of a large quantity of needle-like CoO@CNT material, with lengths of ∼2–5 μm, were observed. Compared to the previous solid core of the CCCH nanorods, the obtained CoO nanorods became largely porous, which were composed of numerous connected small nanoparticles (10–20 nm in size). However, the core–shell morphology remained intact after calcination and thin CNT overlayers (∼5–10 nm in thickness) were clearly observed around the CoO nanoparticle nanorods. These CNT layers should be very helpful in maintaining the mechanical stability of the porous CoO nanorods.33–35Fig. 3e shows the tip section of a CoO@CNT, and a few isolated CoO nanoparticles were even found to be completely encapsulated in the carbon nanotubes (CNT). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the final product is shown in Fig. 3f. The atomic ratio of Co and O was around 1:1.05, which approaches the theoretical value of CoO, and a small amount of Co3O4 might be present, which agrees with the results indicated by the XRD patterns in Fig. 1a. Fig. 3g–h show the HRTEM images of the CoO@carbon nanostructure. Carbon overlayers are amorphous, which should be beneficial to Li-ion diffusion through the CNT walls.5,33,34 The fringe spacings of the crystalline nanoparticle are ∼0.21 nm and 0.25 nm, corresponding to the (200) and (111) lattice planes, respectively, of the cubic CoO, which is also confirmed by the corresponding SAED pattern (Fig. 3i). It should be noted that the conversion from the intermediate product (CCCH-CP nanorods) to amorphous CNT-encapsulated CoO nanorods, were performed in two steps (pre-calcination in air at 250 °C and further carbonization calcination under high-purity N2 at 450 °C). If the intermediate product was heated directly in N2 without pre-heating in air, most products were cubic Co rather than CoO, as shown in the XRD pattern of Fig. 1a. The TEM image of the Co@CNT composite with an echinus-like morphology is shown in the supporting information 3.†

Fig. 4a–b show the first cycle discharge (lithium insertion) and charge (lithium extraction) curves and cycling performances of the CoO@CNT nanostructure and pristine CoO nanorods at a constant small current (71.6 mA g−1, 0.1 C) and between a fixed voltage of 5 mV–3.0 V. The charge capacity was decreased from 968 mAh g−1 to 259 mAh g−1 for pristine CoO nanorods after 50 cycles, however, the CoO@CNT nanocomposites still exhibited a large charge capacity of 1080 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles. There was almost no capacity fading for the CoO@CNT nanorods when compared to the value of the first cycle (1082 mAh g−1). The initial Coulombic efficiencies were 69.0% and 63.6% for CoO@CNT and pristine CoO nanorods, respectively. The large irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle seems to be inevitable for most nanostructured anode materials.11–19 This is largely attributed to the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation on the nanoscale anodes, which could be confirmed by the disappearance of a few initial small peaks in the following cycles of cyclic voltammograms of CoO@CNT anodes (supporting information 5†). Material pretreatment, such as pre-lithiation, could be used to improve the initial Coulombic efficiency before practical application.2,5

The high-rate electrochemical performances of the obtained CoO-based products were also explored, as shown in Fig. 4c–f. Initial charge capacities of CoO@CNT were 963, 917 and 746 mAh g−1 at large currents of 716 mA g−1 (1 C), 1432 mA g−1 (2 C), and 3580 mA g−1 (5 C). This CoO–carbon composite also showed extremely long cycle life at all large currents of 1 C, 2 C and 5 C. For example, a charge capacity of 703 mAh g−1 was retained after 200 cycles at a 5 C current rate (3580 mA g−1), which corresponds to 94.2% of the initial charge capacity, 98.2% of the theoretical capacity (716 mAh g−1) of CoO materials, and ∼2 times as large as the theoretical capacity of commercial graphite anodes (372 mAh g−1). The average capacity fading of the CoO@CNT composite was only a 0.029% loss per cycle at 5 C (3580 mA g−1), which is on par with the performance of commercial graphite anodes (∼0.03% loss per cycle at a small current of ∼75 mA g−1), making it a promising anode material for high-power Li-ion batteries. To the best of our knowledge, this highly stable high-rate Li-ion storage property of the CoO@CNT nanocomposite has not been witnessed for all previous cobalt oxide-based anodes,9–28 and it should be largely attributed to the unique amorphous carbon nanotube-encapsulated porous CoO nanorod nanostructure. The CoO nanorod is protected by the amorphous carbon nanotube overlayer, which substantially improves the mechanical stability of the CoO nanorods during cycling.33 This can be confirmed by the TEM characterization (Fig. 5) of the CoO@CNT anode material after 200 cycles of discharging and charging at 5 C. In spite of the presence of the carbon black and binder, CoO nanorods with a CNT skin are clearly observed to be intact, after repetitive lithium insertion and extraction. In comparison, pristine CoO nanorods were not stable after repetitive cycling (supporting information 6†). The electrical conductivity of the CoO@CNT anode is also increased by the presence of the CNT skin.35–37CoO materials are completely encapsulated inside the CNT, thus ensuring good electrical contact between the CoO and the CNT. The increased electrical conductivity is beneficial for fast lithium-ion diffusion at large currents.3 Finally, there are voids associated with the cavities of the CNTs and the porous CoO nanorods, which is very useful in accommodating the local volume change of CoO materials and ensures long cycle life.37–39

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, a new self-assembled echinus-like nanostructure consisting of a porous CoO nanorod@CNT material was synthesized by a multi–step hydrothermal heating method. Porous CoO nanorods (80–150 nm in diameter, 2–5 μm in length) were well confined in amorphous carbon nanotube overlayer (5–10 nm in thickness, 8.5 wt.%). When evaluated as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, this nanocomposite showed highly stable large reversible capacities at both a small-rate (0.1 C) and high-rate (1 C, 2 C and 5 C, 1 C = 716 mA g−1). In particular, at a high 5 C current rate, the nanocomposite still exhibited high capacities (703–746 mAh g−1 in 200 cycles) and excellent cyclability (0.029% capacity loss per cycle, comparable to the cyclability of a commercial graphite anode at a small current). We believe this cobalt oxide-based anode material with unprecedented high-rate electrochemical properties may find great potentials in next-generation lithium-ion batteries for electrical vehicles.
