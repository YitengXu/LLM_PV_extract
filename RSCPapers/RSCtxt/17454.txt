    , Accepted 4th May 2016First published on 13th May 2016AbstractThree π-conjugated alternating copolymers, based on dibenzosilole as an electron-rich unit and fluorinated or non-fluorinated quinoxaline as an electron-withdrawing unit, connected through thiazole or thiophene moieties, have been synthesized, fully characterized and applied as donors in polymer solar cells (PSCs). The three copolymers, namely PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx, belong to the wide band-gap semiconductor materials family, and they show an absorption edge in the visible region close to 650 nm. In order to tune the position of the polymer energy levels, and in particular to decrease their HOMO energy level, we compare the use of a thiazole spacer sandwiching the electron-deficient moiety as an alternative way to the popular backbone fluorination. PSCs based on a blend of PDBS-TQx and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methylester (PC71BM) as an active layer have shown the best device performances with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.14% for the active area of 0.28 cm2 (under standard illumination of AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2). Interestingly this polymer outperforms P3HT:(PC61BM) solar cells used as a reference material in this work. In addition to the thorough characterization data, including among other spectroscopy techniques, XRD, OFET, AFM and nc-AFM, we discuss in detail the relationship between the chemical structures of the three polymers, their optoelectronic properties, the phase separation in blends with PC71BM and their photovoltaic performances.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are considered as a promising technology for renewable energy sources,1 owing to their numerous advantages compared to other technologies employing inorganic semi-conductors. They have attracted interest of many academic and industrial research teams2 since it has been demonstrated that PSCs can be manufactured on lightweight, flexible and biodegradable substrates3 and that they can be deposited on a large area using printing technologies, which reduces the cost and the energy payback time of the solar cells.4,5 In the last decade, with the goal to improve the attractiveness of PSCs for future industrial production, many research studies have been focused on the development of more efficient devices by synthesizing new materials,6,7 optimizing interface layers8 and designing new device architectures.9
While conventional bulk-heterojunction devices based on narrow band-gap (NBG) polymers in a single cell are now grazing the theoretical PCE limit with efficiencies around 11%,10–12 new approaches based on the multiple absorbing species such as multiple-junction architectures and ternary blend based devices have showed highly promising performances13,14 with PCE records of 11.83% and 10.50% respectively.15,16
Tandem devices are fabricated by superposing vertically single bulk-heterojunction solar cells that are electronically connected by an appropriate recombination layer. This device architecture allows broadening the absorption spectra of the final devices by employing organic semiconducting materials with complementary absorption domains in the different sub-cells.
Ternary blend devices address a similar issue of a more efficient solar photon harvesting by using multiple absorbing species in a single active layer. Such a ternary solar cell can still benefit the easy fabrication process and has received renewed interest in the last few years.17,18
For the fabrication of such panchromatic devices there exists a large variety of NBG materials that are capable of absorbing visible and near-infra red light. Most of these polymers show a PCE over 8% in single junction solar cells.19–21 In contrast, the number of wide band-gap (WBG) materials capable of harvesting photons at shorter wavelengths and showing sufficiently high performances for use in tandem or multi-junction devices is limited to a few examples.22–25
To date, the most used WBG material in panchromatic devices is still poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). This polymer when blended with fullerene derivatives [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or the indene-C60 bis-adduct (IC60BA) can achieve a PCE of 5%22 and 6.5% respectively in a single cell.26 However P3HT has some limitations regarding the position of its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level that impedes the achievement of a high open circuit voltage (VOC) in solar cells. Only a few WBG polymers can outperform P3HT in the shorter wavelength region (350 nm to 650 nm).27,28 To improve the currently reported record efficiencies of tandem and multi-junction cells it is now essential to develop new WBG materials as alternatives to P3HT showing better photovoltaic performances. Ideally these materials should combine a wider band-gap (Eopt > 1.9 eV), a good mobility of the charge carriers in order to maximize the short-circuit current-density Jsc, and a low-lying HOMO energy level29 that enables to achieve a larger open circuit voltage (VOC).
In this contribution, we report on the synthesis and characterization of three wide band-gap copolymers (1.95 eV < Eopt < 2.00 eV) combining dibenzosilole and quinoxaline moieties. The quinoxaline and dibenzosilole units were linked together either with a thiophene or a thiazole spacer to give the copolymers named PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF, and PDBS-TzQx. The copolymers have been fully characterized optically and electronically prior to their use in bulk-heterojunction solar cells with fullerene derivatives. PDBS-TQx and PDBS-TQxF, that contain thiophene spacers, show a relatively high hole mobility in the organic field effect transistor (OFET) configuration with values ranging from 2.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 up to 6.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. All the polymers revealed a quite narrow absorption in the visible range with an absorption edge close to 650 nm in the solid state and a lower HOMO energy level than P3HT. The low-lying HOMO energy levels of these copolymers led to an improved VOC in solar cells compared to P3HT. After optimization of the processing conditions, we show that PDBS-TQx, when used in combination with PC71BM, outperforms P3HT in BHJ solar cells leading to a PCE up to 5.14% under the standard illumination of AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2 (active area 0.28 cm2).
Results and discussion
Synthesis of materials
As discussed in the introduction, the ideal WBG copolymer for BHJ solar cells should possess a low-lying HOMO energy level to ensure a high VOC in solar cells. One useful method to control the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the donor materials is to design copolymers using electron-rich and electron-deficient units in order to build an alternating donor–acceptor structure.30 Such D/A structures offer large possibilities to tune independently the HOMO and LUMO energy levels.31 The combination of a weak donor segment and a medium to strong acceptor motif in the polymer backbone is a good strategy to maintain a low HOMO energy level and to achieve an intense absorption in the visible region thanks to the internal charge transfer (ICT) absorption band.30 For the preparation of our three copolymers, we have selected a quinoxaline32 motif as the electron-deficient unit and a dibenzosilole unit as the electron-rich one. Dibenzosilole was chosen because of its high robustness as compared to carbazole and fluorene units. Despite having quite similar electronic properties these moieties are known to undergo photo-oxidation processes upon light exposure leading to the degradation of their photovoltaic performances.33,34
The choice of the quinoxaline unit was related to the possibility to adjust its electron-withdrawing character by appropriate functionalizations either on the benzene or on the pyrazine ring.35 Therefore to decrease the electron-withdrawing strength of the quinoxaline and to improve the solubility of the final polymers, two alkylthiophenes have been introduced on the pyrazine ring. Additionally we have investigated the effect of swapping H for F in the benzene ring of the quinoxaline on the properties of materials. Fluorination is one of the most convenient and widely employed tools to fine-tune the energy levels and structural properties of copolymers.36–38 Previous studies have shown that the incorporation of fluorine atoms on the benzene ring of quinoxaline or benzothiadiazole decreases the HOMO energy levels of the corresponding polymers leading to an increased VOC of the PSC and increases the polymer crystallization and polymer domains’ purity.37,39–41 Finally, we also investigated the use of a thiazole spacer between D and A moieties instead of the standard thiophene, as it has been shown recently that such a modification could lead to a beneficial translation of both HOMO and LUMO levels towards deeper energy levels.42 The copolymer synthesis requires first the preparation of a 5,5-dihexyl-3,7-bis-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-5H-dibenzo[b,d]silole precursor.43 For the facile access to the polymers we have designed symmetric precursors containing a central quinoxaline unit flanked with the selected spacers (thiophene or thiazole). The copolymers can then be prepared from these monomers employing palladium-mediated cross-coupling polymerization conditions. The synthesis routes of the symmetric monomers are shown in Scheme 1. 4,7-Di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1),44 1,2-bis(5-octylthiophen-2yl)ethane-1,2-dione (2),45 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluoro-5,6-dinitrobenzene (3),46 and 4,7-di(thiazol-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (5)47 were synthesized according to the literature procedures. The target quinoxaline monomer TQx was obtained by reduction with zinc powder of the [1,2,5]-benzothiadiazole unit in (1) to give the corresponding diamino derivative that is later involved in a condensation reaction with the 1,2-bis(5-octylthiophen-2yl)ethane-1,2-dione. The bromination of the resulting molecule using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) afforded the desired monomer TQx-Br. The analog of TQx-Br, i.e.TzQx-Br in which thiophenes are replaced by thiazole rings, was prepared from 4,7-di(thiazol-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (5)47 using the same procedures. Finally, the fluorinated analogue of TQxF-Br was prepared in a slightly different manner. First, 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluoro-5,6-dinitrobenzene was synthesized by nitration from 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluorobenzene. Then 1,4-bis(2-thienyl)-2,3-difluoro-5,6-dinitrobenzene (4) was obtained starting from compound 3 and tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane using Stille coupling conditions.

The TQxF monomer was prepared by reduction of the nitro groups using tin(II) chloride followed by condensation on 1,2-bis(5-octylthiophen-2yl)ethane-1,2-dione (2). This molecule was then brominated with NBS to afford the monomer TQxF-Br.
With all the monomers ready, the preparation of the three new D–A type copolymers PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx was achieved by a Suzuki coupling polycondensation between 5,5-dihexyl-3,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-5H-dibenzo[b,d]silole43 and the corresponding dibromo-quinoxaline building blocks using Pd2dba3/tBu3PHBF4 as a catalyst. The synthetic conditions and the structures of the copolymers are shown in Scheme 2. The copolymers were obtained as purple solids with yields varying between 30% and 70%. After the synthesis, they were purified by precipitation and Soxhlet extraction with methanol, cyclohexane, and chloroform. They showed good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, THF, and chlorobenzene. The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) using tetrahydrofuran as the eluent at 40 °C and calibration with polystyrene standards. PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF, and PDBS-TzQx revealed respectively an average molecular weight (Mn) of 48.8 kg mol−1, 34.2 kg mol−1 and 18.9 kg mol−1 and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 3.3, 2.5, and 2.2. The lower molecular weight of the thiazole derivative is assumed to come from the lower solubility of thiazole-based monomers.

Optical properties of the copolymers
To further replace advantageously P3HT in tandem or ternary-based devices, the WBG materials should possess an intense absorption coefficient in the 350–650 nm region. UV-visible absorption spectra of the copolymers PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx were recorded in chloroform solutions and in thin films cast from chlorobenzene solutions. The spectra are presented in Fig. 1a and b for the solution and thin films respectively, and the results are summarized in Table 2. The three polymers show quite similar shape absorption spectra both in solution and in thin films. In solution they show the first maximum absorption peak in the UV part located between 381 nm and 406 nm corresponding to the π–π* transitions. They also possess a second peak that is clearly distinguished at longer wavelengths with a λmax comprised between 526 nm and 546 nm. This second absorption band, typical in D–A chemical structures, corresponds to internal charge-transfer transitions (ICT) between the electron-rich and the electron-deficient segments.48
 Fig. 1  (a) UV-Visible absorption spectra of PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx in solution in chloroform, (b) in thin films. 
The absorption profiles of the three polymers are shifted toward longer wavelengths going from the solution to the solid state. In thin films, the maximum of the UV absorption peak is slightly red-shifted by 4 nm to 13 nm, whereas the peak corresponding to the ICT absorption is strongly shifted for all the polymers (by 19 nm for PDBS-TQx, 27 nm for PDBS-TQxF and 43 nm for PDBS-TzQx). These behaviours indicate the better delocalization of the electrons of the π-conjugated systems in the solid state and they reflect that strong π-stacking interactions occur between polymer chains (see Fig. 1b). It could be noticed that all polymers present really similar absorption profiles with identical band-gaps measured in the solid state.
The photoluminescence spectra of the polymers were also recorded in solution and in thin films. We observed a strong shift of the emission peaks from circa 630 nm in solution to circa 720 nm in the solid state (see Fig. S1†). This shift is fully consistent with the better interactions between polymer chains in thin films.
Structural organization of the copolymers
Looking closer at the spectra, in addition to the larger bathochromic shifts observed for PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx, one can notice some features in the ICT absorption bands of these two polymers.
This may be an indication that these two polymers give rise to π-stacking interactions in the solid state. To verify this hypothesis X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out on the cast polymer films. All polymers diffract rather weakly, but there are nevertheless distinct diffraction features in pure films that are detected. The presence, in all the diffractograms (see Fig. 2), of one peak corresponding to distances of 3.10–3.15 Å is attributed to silicon substrate. All the three copolymers exhibit one Bragg peak centred in the 17–24 Å d-range which can fit well the periodic lateral distance between the main chains (Table 1).

We also note the systematic presence of faint peaks localised between 21° < 2θ < 25°, corresponding to d-spacings of 4.23, 4.83 and 4.14 Å for PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx, respectively. These distances can be considered as average correlation distances separating first neighbouring molecules in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the polymer backbone.49 These distances stay relatively large because of the van der Waals interactions of alkyl side groups preventing a closer packing of rigid conjugated flat chains. The study by X-ray diffraction measurements of single crystals of monomer DBS precursors as well as TQx, TQxF-Br and TzQx-Br has revealed the planar structure of these different building blocks of the polymer backbones (see the ESI†).
The crystal structures of the quinoxaline precursors show that the central unit and the thiophene or thiazole spacers are almost coplanar. The monomer TQx showed the highest planarity with dihedral angles between the central quinoxaline and the two adjacent thiophenes around 4.2° and 7.0°.
The quinoxaline unit substituted by fluorine atoms TQxF-Br shows slightly increased dihedral angles up to 4.7° and 10.0°. However, fluorine atoms give rise to stronger π-stacking interactions since the intermolecular distances between adjacent molecules are around 3.4 Å. The replacement of thiophene spacers by thiazole ones in TzQx-Br increased the dihedral angle values up to 8.9°. However the single crystal structure also reveals strong π-stacking interactions between thiazole rings with short intermolecular distances of circa 3.4 Å.
Finally, the types of X-ray profiles obtained for PDBS-TQx and for PDBS-TQxF are typical of layered structures exhibiting several orders of Bragg peaks of the same family. For these two polymers, layers of more or less regularly stacked chains can be reasonably assumed. The case of PDBS-TzQx is somewhat different because the presence of a doublet at low scattering angles is a strong indication of a more complex type of chain packing or orientation of the crystallites.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the polymers was carried out in a three-electrode cell using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a calibration with the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. The cyclic voltammetry curves are shown in Fig. 3a and the electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2. From the CV curves we found that the oxidation process occurred at 0.94 V for PDBS-TQx, 1.09 V for PDBS-TQxF and 1.31 V for PDBS-TzQx. The onset of the reduction potentials of the polymers was found at −1.27 V and −1.28 V for PDBS-TQx and PDBS-TQxF, respectively but this value was shifted at −1.11 V for PDBS-TzQx. From the ionisation potential and the electronic affinity measured by CV, the corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated using the following equations EHOMO = −(EOX + 4.38) (eV) and ELUMO = −(ERED + 4.38) (eV).50 The HOMO energy level of PDBS-TQx was estimated at −5.32 eV. The substitution of the quinoxaline unit with fluorine atoms in PDBS-TQxF induces a down-shift of the HOMO energy level at −5.47 eV. But, as expected, the strongest effect was observed when the thiophene spacers are replaced by thiazole units. Indeed the polymer PDBS-TzQx possesses a HOMO energy level located at −5.69 eV. In contrast, the impact of the different chemical variations on the LUMO levels is relatively weak. PDBS-TQx and PDBS-TQxF have LUMO levels located at circa −3.10 eV and PDBS-TzQx shows a LUMO level at −3.27 eV. Interestingly all the polymers have a HOMO energy level deeper than the one of the P3HT (EHOMO = −4.90 eV)51,52 (see Fig. 3b). This feature is expected to give rise to a higher open circuit voltage for the solar cells.

Theoretical calculations
In order to investigate the intrinsic difference between the polymers and to better understand how the chemical modifications influence the energy level positions and the electron density distribution, theoretical calculations were performed by density functional theory using the B3LYP hybrid method. To simplify the calculation, only one set of repeating units of each polymer was used for the calculation and the long alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups. The optimisation of the geometry was carried out with the data for each monomer deduced from the single crystal X-Ray diffraction. The simulated electron density distribution and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels with the optimized geometry are shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  DFT calculated HOMO and LUMO wave functions of the geometry-optimized repeating unit structure PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx. 
The calculated HOMO energy levels of PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx were −5.27 eV, −5.38 eV and −5.57 eV respectively. The calculated LUMO energy levels of PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx were −2.80 eV, −2.83 eV and −3.05 eV respectively. These values are quite consistent with the experimental ones found from electrochemical measurements. As expected, the three polymers show an electron density distribution of the LUMO energy levels mainly located on the quinoxaline moiety, which is the most electron-deficient unit in the polymer backbone. However we found that the electron density of the HOMO energy level of PDBS-TQx is rather delocalized on the aromatic cores of the polymer backbone including the benzene ring of the quinoxaline. The fluorine substitutions on PDBS-TQxF, that make the quinoxaline unit more electron deficient, slightly transferred the electron density of the HOMO energy level on the dibenzosilole unit. Finally the use of thiazole spacers in PDBS-TzQx induces a similar effect and increases the contribution of dibenzosilole to the HOMO energy level.
Electronic transport properties
The charge carrier mobility of the donor polymer is an important parameter that partly governs the performances of BHJ solar cells. A high charge carrier mobility may contribute to improve the Jsc and the Fill Factor (FF) leading to a higher PCE. The hole mobility of the copolymers was measured in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with a bottom gate and bottom contact configuration. The OFET characteristics are presented in Table 3. PDBS-TQx exhibits a hole mobility of 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Swapping H for F in the quinoxaline unit allows increasing the hole mobility of PDBS-TQxF up to 1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. After thermal annealing a highest value of 4.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved in the linear regime and this value rises at 6.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the saturated regime (see the ESI†). The lower hole mobility (circa one order of magnitude) measured for the PDBS-TzQx polymer compared to the polymers PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TQx could be attributed to (i) the lower ordering of the polymer chains in thin films and (ii) the PDBS-TzQx macromolecular parameters including shorter polymer chains (PDBS-TQxMn = 48.8 kg mol−1, and PDBS-TQxFMn = 34.2 kg mol−1vs. PDBS-TzQxMn = 18.9 kg mol−1). Indeed it is well-known that the chain length of the deposited polymers is a determining factor in the fabrication of layers with high carrier mobility. High Mw fractions can lead to improved charge transport properties by increasing the conjugation length, the probability of the inter-chain charge carriers hopping and by improving the connectivity between domains.53–55 The rather good hole mobility value for the polymers PDBS-TQxF may originate from a larger crystal size that is usually observed with fluorinated copolymers, probably due to increased π-stacking interactions.56

Photovoltaic properties
To illustrate the potential of these copolymers for use in photovoltaic devices, thin-film BHJ solar cells with the standard device architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al (active area 0.28 cm2, masked) were fabricated and tested under AM 1.5G, solar illumination at 1000 W m−2. Several parameters such as the donor–acceptor ratio, the thickness of the active layer, the use of additives and the thermal post-treatment of the thin films were investigated. The results were compared to optimized reference P3HT-PC61BM solar cells measured under the same conditions and to the state of the art P3HT-PC71BM solar cell reported by Sakai and co-workers.57 Various solvents and additives have been reported in the literature in order to improve the solar cell efficiencies. In this study chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene and para-xylene were tested as the solvent and di-iodo-octane (DIO) and anisole were evaluated as an additive to deposit the polymer:PC71BM mixture58 (see Table S2†). For this class of polymers, it was systematically found that, chlorobenzene with 3% of DIO for processing gives the better performances in photovoltaic devices. The improvement of the PCE mainly originated from a much higher short circuit current density (Jsc) and a higher fill factor (FF). This observation can be rationally explained by studying the morphology of the active layers employing atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode (see Fig. S4†). Indeed it was found that there was a strong dependency of the morphology of the blends on the processing conditions. The use of DIO as an additive reduces the size of the domains and gives rise to a much better structuration of the two percolating networks and a higher homogeneity of the film.59,60
The thickness of the active layers was also optimized by analysing its influence on the performances of the devices (the thickness was varied between 50 nm and 160 nm). The photovoltaic data are shown in the ESI.† For all the polymers the optimum thicknesses were found to be between 50 and 75 nm.

Fig. 5 shows the representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the three polymers in an optimized device configuration, and their detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 4.

Among the three polymers in this study, the best performances were achieved with PDBS-TQx, a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 9.72 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.62 and a PCE of 5.14% were obtained for the best cell with this polymer and an average PCE of 4.93% was demonstrated over 5 cells. For this polymer a post-fabrication thermal annealing treatment was not effective to improve the performances. These results highlight the higher performances of PDBS-TQx, compared to P3HT in solar cells.
The improvement mostly originates from the higher VOC of the solar cells fabricated with this material which is higher by 0.2 V compared to P3HT.
The substitution of the quinoxaline with fluorine atoms in PDBS-TQxF has a significant effect on the performances. For this polymer the best cell revealed a VOC of 0.81 V, a JSC of 7.27 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.51 leading to a PCE of 2.98%. It should however be noticed that after thermal annealing at 120 °C, the performances increased to reach a PCE of 3.19% with a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 7.61 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.55.
The performances of the solar cells containing the thiazole-based copolymer PDBS-TzQx were the lowest. In this case the overall operating parameters are decreased to reach a VOC of 0.63 V, a FF of 0.41 and a JSC of 4.92 mA cm−2 leading to a maximum PCE of 1.27%. As for PDBS-TQx, a thermal annealing of the devices did not yield higher performances. The much lower JSC and FF for the PDBS-TzQx-based devices can be explained by their lower charge carrier mobility as demonstrated earlier. However the origin of the drop in the VOC value is not yet fully understood.
Film morphology
The morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blend films with the optimized weight ratio was investigated by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM topographic images are shown in Fig. 6. The morphology of pristine polymers with PC71BM shows aggregated domains with diameters around 500 nm for PDBS-TQx, 300 nm for PDBS-TQxF and 260 nm for PDBS-TzQx (Fig. 6a–e). This type of phase segregation is expected to be responsible for the enhanced exciton recombination and the dramatic drop in the current density when the polymers are processed without additives. This morphology also explains why our attempts to improve the morphology of the donor–acceptor networks by a simple thermal treatment were not successful. As explained before, with the goal to enhance the miscibility of the two components and to favour the formation of a better interpenetrating donor–acceptor network, we used DIO as a processing additive. DIO is widely used to enable morphological control in bulk heterojunction materials where thermal annealing is either undesirable or ineffective. When used in a small amount, it can increase the relative solubility of the fullerene compared to the polymer and it ensures that the two materials are well-solubilized in the processing solution.59

The AFM morphology images confirmed that the aggregate sizes decreased after adding DIO and each blend appeared more homogeneous (Fig. 6b–f). Consequently, better photovoltaic properties are obtained with these blends. However due to the limited resolution of the technique it is difficult to confirm that the two types of domains visible in the AFM images correspond to pure materials, they could also correspond to inter-mixed phases.61
To investigate in more detail the morphology of the active area of our champion cell, i.e.PDBS-TQx:PC71BM we used non-contact AFM (nc-AFM) under ultra-high vacuum.62 In topography (Fig. 7a) a fine phase separation is clearly visible. The analysis of the damping images (Fig. 7b) revealed a more complex phase structuration. Besides a nano-phase segregation at the 10 nm scale, larger features appear at the 100 nm scale. These data show that, despite the nanometer-scale phase segregation, the relative concentration of the donor and acceptor components varies at the mesoscopic scale. This strongly suggests that further improvement can be expected by achieving an even more homogeneous blend morphology.61

Recombination kinetics
An important parameter in the performance of the bulk heterojunction solar cells is the charge recombination kinetics, which can be studied by analysing the light intensity dependence.63–65 Light-intensity-dependent J–V characteristics of the PDBS-TQx:PC71BM and PDBS-TQxF:PC71BM blend polymers were measured. This experiment was carried out in order to shed light on the fundamental processes that make PDBS-TQx-based devices’ performances better than the ones of the devices based on PDBS-TQxF. Light intensities from 5.7 to 100 mW cm−2 were employed and the J–V characteristics of the devices based on PDBS-TQx are shown in Fig. 8a and those for PDBS-TQxF based devices are shown in Fig. 8b.
 Fig. 8  
J–V curves for BHJ solar cells of PDBS-TQx:PC71BM 1:2 (a) and PDBS-TQxF:PC71BM 1:2 (b) under different light intensities. 
For the devices based on PDBS-TQx, the photocurrent quickly saturated at a low reverse bias, in contrast, for the devices based on PDBS-TQxF the photocurrent saturation is only observed at a high reverse bias as evidenced especially at high illumination. This behavior could be explained by more charge carrier recombination for the devices based on PDBS-TQxF, especially for voltages approaching the VOC. Fig. 9 shows the variation of the JSC as a function of the light intensity for the solar cells based on PDBS-TQx:PC71BM and PDBS-TQxF:PC71BM.
 Fig. 9  Double logarithmic plot of JSC as a function of the light intensity and fitting line according to the power law. 
In organic solar cells, the dependence of the steady state short circuit current density JSC as a function of the incident light intensity (I) can be expressed according to a power law JSC ∞ Iα. The physical interpretation of the fitting parameter α is still under debate since it does not give a high-precision measure of the recombination mechanism. However, a fitting parameter α close to 1 is often attributed to a first order loss process whereas a value close to 0.5 is related to a second order (bimolecular) loss process. In other words when the α value is close to unity it corresponds to a low bimolecular recombination rate.66,67 Herein, in both devices investigated, the α values are close to unity, which indicates that monomolecular recombination is the dominant loss mechanism.
In organic solar cells, the nature of the main recombination process (monomolecular versus bimolecular) can also be determined by the slope of VOCversus ln(I). Fig. 10 displays the VOC as a function of the light intensity for the solar cells based on PDBS-TQx:PC71BM and PDBS-TQxF:PC71BM. A slope of 2 kT/q is observed in the case of monomolecular recombination where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature and q the elementary charge. For bimolecular recombination, a slope of kT/q is observed.66

In our case, the slope values for the solar cells based on PDBS-TQx and PDBS-TQxF are equal to 1.29 kT/q and 1.63 kT/q, respectively. This result indicates that monomolecular recombination seems even more pronounced with our fluorinated copolymer, i.e.PDBS-TQxF. Opposite effects have been reported for other classes of fluorinated copolymers containing benzothiadiazole units such as PCPDTBT.68 Therefore it seems that the introduction of fluorine substituents on the electron-withdrawing units does not lead systematically to a decrease in the charge recombination process.
Conclusions
In summary, the synthesis, characterization of the optoelectronic properties, structural organization and photovoltaic properties of a series of wide band gap copolymers based on dibenzosilole and fluorinated or non-fluorinated quinoxaline sub-units connected through thiophene or thiazole segments are described. The copolymers, namely PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx present an absorption edge close to 650 nm in the solid state and HOMO energy levels comprised between −5.3 eV and −5.7 eV. When they are combined to PC71BM to fabricate bulk-heterojunction solar cells, PCE ranging from 1.27% to 5.14% is achieved. Interestingly one of the new polymers, i.e.PDBS-TQx leads to an increased Voc (by circa 0.2 V) and superior solar cell performances compared to a benchmark cell based on P3HT, one of the most known wide band gap polymers in the field. In contrast to P3HT, it is important to mention here that record performances with PDBS-TQx were obtained without any post-fabrication treatment such as thermal or solvent annealing. Despite a higher hole mobility and a deeper HOMO energy level, PDBS-TQxF performances in solar cells only reached 3.19%. By using experimental photocurrent measurement in combination with light intensity dependence, the lower efficiency of PDBS-TQxF is attributed to a higher monomolecular charge recombination rate.
Owing to the opto-electronic properties of PDBS-TQx and the quite promising performances of single bulk-heterojunction solar cells, we believe that this material could be valuable to develop tandem devices or ternary blend devices where the complementarity of the absorption domains of the different components is essential to achieve record performances.

General polymerization procedure

PDBS-TQx, PDBS-TQxF and PDBS-TzQx copolymers were synthesized by a Suzuki coupling reaction. 5,5-Dihexyl-3,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-5H-dibenzo[b,d]silole and the corresponding bis(bromo)-substituted quinoxaline monomer were solubilized in a mixture of toluene and DMF under argon. The mixture was degassed by freeze–thaw–pump cycles. Then, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium and tri-tert-butylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate were added. A 0.5 M solution of K2CO3 in water was degassed by bubbling argon in it for 15 hours, before to be added to the solution with reagents. The Schlenk tube was dipped in a thermostated oil bath at 95 °C and kept under argon. After 28 hours, phenylboronic acid was added. After 1 hour, 2-bromothiophene was added. After 1 hour, the temperature was decreased to room temperature. The polymer was precipitated in methanol at 0 °C and collected by filtration. The polymer purification included two steps. The polymer was dissolved in CHCl3 (5 mL) at 60 °C. Then deionized water (100 mL) and sodium diethyl-dithiocarbamate (1 g, 4.44 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred vigorously at reflux overnight. The polymer was extracted into CHCl3, the organic layer was washed with water, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated. Finally, the polymer was precipitated in methanol and collected by filtration. The precipitate was Soxhlet extracted in order with cyclohexane and chloroform. The chloroform solution was concentrated to a small volume and precipitated into methanol. Finally, the polymer was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum overnight.

Physicochemical characterization
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2 spectrometer (wavelength range: 250–800 nm; resolution: 2 nm). Electrochemical studies of the synthesized molecules were carried out in a one compartment, the three-electrode electrochemical cell equipped with a flat platinum working electrode (7 mm2), a Pt wire counter electrode, and a reference electrode of Ag/AgCl, whose potential was checked using the Fc/Fc+ couple as an internal standard. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) solution in acetonitrile.
Organic field effect transistor device preparation
Bottom contact field-effect transistors were elaborated on commercially available pre-patterned test structures whose source and drain contacts were composed of 30 nm thick gold and 10 nm thick Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) bilayers. A 230 nm thick silicon oxide was used as the gate dielectric and n-doped (3 × 1017 cm−3) silicon crystal as the gate electrode. The channel length and channel width were 20 μm and 10 mm respectively. The test structures were cleaned in acetone and isopropyl alcohol and subsequently for 15 minutes in an ultraviolet ozone system. Then, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) was spin-coated (500 rpm for 5 s and then 4000 rpm for 50 s) under an ambient nitrogen atmosphere followed by an annealing step at 130 °C for 15 minutes. Finally, 5 mg mL−1 anhydrous chloroform polymer solutions were spin coated (1250 rpm for 60 s and 2000 rpm for 120 s) to complete the FET devices. The samples were then left overnight under vacuum (<10−6 mbar) to remove residual solvent traces. Both, the FET elaboration and characterization were performed under an ambient nitrogen atmosphere.
Devices characterization
Patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned using sequential sonication in water, acetone and isopropanol. The washed substrates were treated with a UV-ozone cleaner for 30 min, then, the hole transporting PEDOT:PSS (40 nm) was spin-coated on the ITO glass, and dried at 180 °C for 30 min. The polymer and PC71BM in chlorobenzene were spin-coated on the substrate in a glove box. 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was used as a processing additive to optimize the morphology. Calcium (20 nm) and aluminium layers (100 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum (10−7 mbar). The active area of the device was 0.28 cm2. The current density–voltage characteristics of the devices in the dark and under white light illumination were measured using an AM 1.5G solar simulator. Current–voltage, I–V, characteristics and PCEs of the solar cells, illuminated through the ITO, were measured under an inert atmosphere via a computer controlled Keithley 1 SMU 2400 unit using 100 mW cm−2 air-mass (1.5)-simulated white light generated by an Oriel SP94023A (Xe lamp) solar simulator. These simulated conditions are consistent with most published research studies to date. A monocrystalline silicon solar cell, calibrated by Newport, was used as a reference cell to confirm stabilization of the 100 mW cm2 illumination.
