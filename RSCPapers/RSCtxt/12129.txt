    , Accepted 8th October 2021First published on 8th October 2021AbstractA POM-based one-dimensional (1D) chain compound, {BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2]2[Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)]}{BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2][Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)2]}·7H2O, has been synthesized and structurally characterized, which represents an unprecedented 1D double chain structure with opposite charges. In contrast to common POMs, this compound exhibits a relatively high electrical conductivity of 1.17 × 10−9 S cm−1 at 25 °C. In addition, its semiconducting properties have also been investigated by application of photoelectrochemical sensing of H2O2.
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a large family of anionic metal oxide clusters mainly constructed using niobium, vanadium, tantalum, molybdenum and tungsten at their highest oxidation states (4+, 5+, 6+).1 As a kind of special metal–oxygen clusters, POMs have been drawing extensive attention due to their vast structural diversity, good thermal stability, unique physicochemical properties and potential applications in areas such as catalysis, electronics, solar energy utilization, magnetism and materials science.2 In recent years, solid-state POMs have shown their prominence in semiconductor materials, especially for applications in photocatalysis and solar cells.3 In 2021, Niu et al. synthesized a novel POM-based two-dimensional (2D) crystalline porous material, {Co6Zn5W19}, which exhibits good photocatalytic activity for the reduction removal of the toxic Cr(VI) metal ion.4 In the latest solar cells, POMs as interfacial materials (the electron transporting layer and the hole-transporting layer) could play important roles in boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE).5 In 2020, Xu et al. developed a H3PMo9W3O40-based anode interlayer (AIL) for the fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs), which exhibited an outstanding PCE of 16.3% with excellent reproducibility.6 Besides, electrical conductivity has received considerable attention for potential applications in electrochemical energy storage, electrocatalysis, sensors, and organic devices. In particular, the electrical conductivity of interlayer materials in solar cells also has a significant impact on the PCE of solar cells. For instance, Peng et al. recently reported a novel N-doping fullerene ionene polymer (C60-MPE-ionene), which has good conductivity and can be used as a conducting cathode interlayer. This makes the PCE of perovskite solar cells as high as 19.28%.7
Although POM-based materials possess semiconducting properties, their electrical conductivity is generally low. For instance, the insulating behavior (<10−9 S cm−1 at room temperature) of (BEDT-TTF)4[Cr(OH)6Mo6O18]·2H2O (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene) was reported by Ouahab's group.8 The low electrical conductivity of POMs greatly limits their practical applications in electrocatalysis and electronic materials. Therefore, it remains a challenge to improve the electrical conductivity of POMs.
Although electrical conductivity can be improved by using some chemical methods, the structural and morphological characteristics of solid-state materials also play a key role in electrical conductivity enhancement. 1D nanostructures, such as nanowires, have high electrical conductivity and excellent performance in the fields of photocatalysis, sensors and electronics.9 For example, in 2015, Lee et al. fabricated Ag NW-based stretchable conductive fibers, which exhibit the highest conductivity of 2450 S cm−1.10 It is well known that POM-based coordination polymers (POMCPs) could form one-dimensional (1D), 2D or 3D architectures.11 Inspired by the high electrical conductivity of nanowires, we expect that POM-based 1D chain compounds with special structures may have superior properties to other architectures. In 2015, by using rigid N-donor ligands, Wang's group synthesized an infinite-chain compound, [Ag6(tbz)4(bim)2(H3PW12O40)]·4H2O (Htbz = thiabendazole, bim = benzimidazole), with hexanuclear AgI clusters. This compound exhibited good luminescence recognition for Hg2+ in suspension.12 In 2020, Ying's group reported a novel inorganic–organic hybrid, namely [CuII4(btmc)(ctcm)4(β-Mo8O26)]·[β-Mo8O26]·H2O (btmc = 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-methyl)cyclohexane, ctcm = C-(4-[1,2,4]triazol-4-ylmethyl-cyclohexyl)-methylamine), which can act as an electrochemical sensor for amperometric detection of NO2−.13 Although hundreds and thousands of POMCPs have been reported so far, a 1D double chain compound with opposite charges remains unexplored in POM chemistry.
Herein, we report an unprecedented POM-based 1D double chain compound, {BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2]2[Cu(2,2′bipy)(H2O)]}{BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2][Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)2]}·7H2O (1), which is successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction using K5[BW12O40] (BW12), 2,2′-bipyridine and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O as starting materials. Interestingly, the 1D double chain in compound 1 appears with opposite charges and contributes a relatively high electrical conductivity of 1.17 × 10−9 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the semiconducting properties of compound 1, we carried out an investigation on photoelectrochemical sensing of H2O2.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that compound 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/c space group, featuring a 1D double chain structure with opposite charges (Fig. 1h). As shown in Fig. 1a, the asymmetric structural unit of compound 1, {BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2]2[Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)]}{BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2][Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)2]}, consists of two independent POM-based clusters. One is a cationic cluster, and the other is an anionic cluster. For the cationic cluster, {BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2]2[Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)]}+ (Fig. 1b) is composed of one [Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)]2+ cation (part 1, Fig. 1d) and one {BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2]2}− anion (part 2, Fig. 1e). It is worth noting that [Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)]2+ cations (part 1) act as Cu linkages to connect the adjacent {BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2]2}− anions (part 2) through two terminal oxygen atoms (O1, O2) (Fig. S1a, ESI†) of BW12, constructing a positively charged one-dimensional chain structure (Fig. 1h, chain 1). The Cu1 ion locates in a five-coordinated environment comprising two N2,2′-bipy (N1, N2), two Ot (O1, O2) and one Owater (O8) (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The calculated lowest continuous shape measure (CShM) parameters (Table S1, ESI†) suggest that the geometry of Cu1 is spherical square pyramid. The Cu1–O1 and Cu1–O2 distances are 1.964(15) and 2.397(14) Å, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). For the anionic cluster, {BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2][Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)2]}− (Fig. 1c) is composed of one [Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)2]2+ cation (part 3, Fig. 1f) and one {BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2]}3− (part 4, Fig. 1g) anion. Similarly, the [Cu(2,2′-bipy)(H2O)2]2+ cations (part 3) also act as bridge linkages, connecting with adjacent {BW12O40[Cu(2,2′-bipy)2]}3− (part 4) anions through two terminal oxygen atoms (O5, O6) (Fig. S2a, ESI†) of BW12 to form a negatively charged 1D chain structure (Fig. 1h, chain 2). The Cu4 ion has six-coordinated geometry (Fig. S2b, ESI†), possessing the geometry of an octahedron (Table S1, ESI†). The Cu4–O5 and Cu4–O6 distances are 2.455(7) and 2.824(8) Å, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). It should be noted that, although the Cu4–O6 distances are quite long, as a result of the Jahn–Teller effect, we consider that these bonds and the coordination geometry of Cu4 are reasonable. Similar situations have also been reported in previous studies.14

The structural unit of chain 1 (Fig. 1b) contains three Cu2+ cations and one [BW12O40]5− anion, showing +1 charge difference. However, the structural unit of chain 2 (Fig. 1c) contains two Cu2+ cations and one [BW12O40]5− anion, displaying −1 charge difference. For chain 1, it is composed of n structural units showing +n charge differences. However, chain 2 possesses −n charge differences to balance the charges of chain 1. The above results indicate that compound 1 is electrically neutral without any counterions to balance charge. The bond-valence sum (BVS)15 calculations (Table S2, ESI†) suggest that all W atoms in compound 1 are in a +6 valence state.
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of compound 1 matches well with its simulated one from the single crystal structure (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating its good phase purity. The numbers of free lattice H2O molecules in compound 1 were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S4, ESI†). For IR spectra, the characteristic bands at 823, 911 and 955 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching of WO, W–O and B–O, respectively (Fig. S5, ESI†). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of compound 1 was measured to reveal the optical band gap (Eg). The Eg of compound 1 was calculated to be 2.40 eV from the Kubelka–Munk function F against E (Fig. S6b, ESI†),16 suggesting that compound 1 may exhibit semiconducting properties. The Mott–Schottky plot indicated that compound 1 has n-type semiconducting characteristics (Fig. S7, ESI†), and the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) were calculated to be −0.43 eV and 1.97 eV vs. NHE, respectively.
In order to investigate the photoelectrochemical performance of compound 1, photocurrent response experiments of compound 1 were carried out at a constant bias of 0.6 V under Xe lamp irradiation (λ > 420 nm) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the photocurrent response of compound 1.
Electrical conductivity measurements were carried out over compound 1 and BW12, respectively. Those of BW12 were used as control experiments because the building block in compound 1 was just BW12. For I–V measurements, the dried pellet was removed from the vacuum oven and immediately sandwiched between two clean FTO substrates and the I–V curve of the pellet was recorded with a two-electrode setup.17 In order to reduce experimental errors, we conducted three tests on the electrical conductivity of compound 1 and BW12, respectively (Table S3, ESI†). Fig. 2 shows the I–V curves of the tablet of compound 1 (red) and BW12 (black), respectively. Linear fits to the data yield electrical conductivities of 1.14 × 10−9 and 1.27 × 10−11 S cm−1 for compound 1 and BW12, respectively. The average electrical conductivities of compound 1 and BW12 are 1.17 × 10−9 and 1.26 × 10−11 S cm−1, respectively (Table S3, ESI†). Obviously, the electrical conductivity of compound 1 is almost 100 times that of BW12, indicating that the 1D double chain structure with opposite charges may be responsible for the electrical conductivity improvement, providing a new insight into improving the electrical conductivity of POMCPs.

H2O2 plays a crucial role in a wide range of biological and enzyme-catalyzed reactions.18 H2O2 exists in the natural environment and is commonly used as a special reagent in paper, textile and food industries. Therefore, fast and accurate detection of H2O2 is of great value to medicine, environment and human health. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing, an emerging technique of determination, is attracting attention due to its low background signal and simple instrumentation setup.36 In order to investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of compound 1, PEC sensing based on compound 1 for determination of H2O2 was carried out. Photocurrent responses were recorded at a constant bias of 0.6 V under Xe lamp irradiation (λ > 420 nm) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte at different H2O2 concentrations (0, 30, 50, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 μM). As shown in Fig. 3a, successive addition of H2O2 to the electrolyte produced a continual increase in photocurrent intensity, indicating that compound 1 shows obvious photoelectrocatalytic oxidation activity for H2O2. This photoelectrocatalytic performance is because compound 1 could lead to fast charge transfer kinetics and effective separation of electron–hole charge carriers. Fig. 3b shows the linear relationship between the change in photocurrent density (ΔI) and the logarithm of H2O2 concentration. Linear regression of the change in photocurrent density as a function of H2O2 concentration from 30 to 500 μM yields the equation: ΔI = −0.45 + 0.319log(C), where C is the concentration of H2O2. The limit of detection (LOD) was 6.3 μM, generally defined for the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3. The stability of compound 1 was investigated by several sensing measurements with 500 μM H2O2 on the same photoanode, and no variation of the output signal was observed for the three-day measurements (Fig. S9a and b, ESI†), demonstrating a good stability.

As shown in Fig. 4, the mechanism of PEC sensing of H2O2 over compound 1 can be proposed as follows: under illumination, the valence band electrons of compound 1 are excited to the conduction band. At the same time, the corresponding photogenerated holes (h+) are left in the valence band. Part of the photogenerated holes and electrons are separated under the electric field, and the photogenerated holes directly oxidize H2O2. Then, the photogenerated electrons transfer from compound 1 to the FTO electrode and ultimately to the external circuit. Therefore, the process of electron transfer through the external circuit is improved by the addition of H2O2 because the photogenerated holes (h+) are used to oxidize H2O2, which increases the photocurrent density. A similar mechanism was also reported by Tang's group.19

In summary, we have successfully synthesized a POM-based 1D double chain compound consisting of two independent 1D chains with opposite charges. The electrical conductivity measurements manifested that the electrical conductivity of compound 1 (1.17 × 10−9 S cm−1) is almost 100 times that of BW12 (1.26 × 10−11 S cm−1), indicating that the 1D double chain structure with opposite charges may contribute to the improvement of electrical conductivity, which provides a new insight into improving the electrical conductivity of POM-based coordination polymers. The Eg value at 2.40 eV for compound 1 is indicative of semiconducting properties. A preliminary study on photocurrent response at different H2O2 concentrations demonstrates that compound 1 exhibits evident activity for PEC sensing of H2O2.
