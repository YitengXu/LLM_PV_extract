    , Accepted 29th July 2015First published on 30th July 2015AbstractIn this report, CdS nanorods/g-C3N4 heterojunctions loaded with a noble-metal-free NiS cocatalyst were for the first time fabricated by an in situ hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized heterostructured photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, nitrogen absorption, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production was evaluated using an aqueous solution containing triethanolamine under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm). The results clearly demonstrated that the ternary hybridization of the NiS cocatalyst, 1D CdS nanorods and 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets is a promising strategy to achieve highly efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution. Among all the photocatalysts employed, the ternary hybrid g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS composite materials show the best photocatalytic performance with a H2-production rate of 2563 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 1582 times higher than that of the pristine g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the combined effects of NiS cocatalyst loading and the formation of the intimate nanoheterojunctions between 1D CdS nanorods and 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets, which were favorable for promoting charge transfer, improving the separation efficiency of photoinduced electron–hole pairs from the bulk to the interfaces and accelerating the surface H2-evolution kinetics. This work would not only provide a promising photocatalyst candidate for applications in visible-light H2 generation, but also offer a new insight into the construction of highly efficient and stable g-C3N4-based hybrid semiconductor nanocomposites for diverse photocatalytic applications.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen (H2), one of the most green and sustainable energy carriers to substitute traditional fossil fuels, has attracted tremendous interest in a number of scientific and technological fields.1 In the future hydrogen economy, the heterogeneous photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting powered by renewable and sustainable solar energy has been regarded as one of the most eco-friendly strategies for clean hydrogen production.2–4 In particular, since the Honda–Fujishima effect of water splitting over a TiO2 photoelectrode was first discovered in 1972,5 enormous efforts have been devoted toward the development of various H2-generation photocatalysts.3,6 However, so far, this technology is still far from industrial applications on account of its low solar energy conversion and utilization efficiencies, and limited production capacity. Without exaggeration, no one single photocatalyst could satisfy all the requirements for practical water splitting, including suitable band gaps and positions, low cost, high activity and stability.7,8 Thus, apart from the development of new photocatalysts, it is increasingly urgent to pay more attention to the resolution of many important scientific issues in the existing H2-evolution photocatalysts, such as increasing visible-light harvesting, suppressing rapid charge recombination and improving the photostabilities.3 In recent years, it has been widely recognized that photocatalysts should be highly functional materials.2 Generally speaking, there are three typical processes in photocatalytic water splitting, including photon absorption (I), charge separation and migration to surface active sites (II), and surface electrocatalytic reactions (III).2,3 Since a lot of visible-light-driven photocatalysts are available, optimizing both steps (II) and (III) is crucial to achieving highly efficient and stable H2 evolution.
Among various kinds of semiconductor photocatalysts, noble metal-free polymeric graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and CdS have proven to be two kinds of promising candidates for visible-light-responsive photocatalytic applications such as H2 generation,9–12 dye degradation,13–16 CO2 reduction17–21 and selective organic synthesis22–24 due to their low costs, easy preparation, and suitable band gaps and levels. However, the pristine g-C3N4 seriously suffers from insufficient poor electrical conductivity, low charge mobility and specific surface area, moderate water oxidation ability, and fast recombination rate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs.25 Meanwhile, the strong photocorrosion process of well-studied CdS semiconductors generally could lead to sulphur deposition on CdS and Cd2+ dissolution, greatly limiting their activity and practical applications.2 Therefore, a variety of approaches, such as loading cocatalysts,26 constructing heterojunctions with other semiconductors or nanocarbon materials,27–29 doping metal or nonmetal elements,25,30,31 and forming mesoporous or nanostructured materials,32–35 have been developed to improve their photocatalytic efficiency and stability. Among them, forming nano-heterojunctions between g-C3N4 and CdS has been widely investigated due to their well-matched band energy alignment, which could not only efficiently enhance the visible-light absorption of g-C3N4, but also suppress the photocorrosion of CdS and promote charge separation.36–38 To date, although CdS quantum dots (or nanoparticles)/bulk g-C3N437–40 and CdS nanorods (or nanoparticles)/graphene nanosheet19,22,41–44 hybrid photocatalysts have been deeply investigated, there are few reports on the in situ growth of 1D CdS nanorods on g-C3N4 nanosheets in aqueous solutions until now. Therefore, it is an interesting topic to develop the in situ growth of CdS nanorods on g-C3N4 nanosheets with intimate interface contacts for enhanced photocatalytic H2 production.
Notably, the famous noble-metal Pt as a H2-evolution cocatalyst was generally loaded onto the CdS/g-C3N4 heterojunctions to further enhance their H2-generation activity.36–38 Unfortunately, Pt is too scarce and expensive for the purpose of widespread applications. Thus, it remains a great challenge to develop noble metal-free cocatalysts with a high H2-evolution activity and a low overpotential to replace Pt.45–47 To this end, it has been recently demonstrated that the loading of noble metal-free NiS cocatalyst could significantly enhance the H2-evolution activity of bulk g-C3N4,26,48,49 ZnxCd1−xS50,51 and CdS.11,52 However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no available reports about the H2 generation over noble metal-free NiS cocatalyst modified earth-abundant CdS nanorods/g-C3N4 heterojunctions.
Herein, to synergistically maximize the H2-evolution activity, we detail a facile hydrothermal route to synthesize ternary hybrid robust photocatalysts by using the combined strategies of forming nanostructures, constructing heterostructured nanocomposites and loading noble metal-free NiS cocatalysts. The earth-abundant CdS nanorods/g-C3N4 nanosheets 1D/2D hybrid nanoheterojunctions were constructed through in situ growth of CdS nanorods on the g-C3N4 nanosheets from Cd-containing carbon nitride (Cd–g-C3N4) compounds, which is similar to previous Fe/g-C3N4 and Zn/g-C3N4 compounds.53 Moreover, noble-metal-free NiS nanoparticles were also loaded on g-C3N4–CdS nanoheterojunctions via precipitating nickel acetate in the presence of a large excess of thiourea under hydrothermal conditions. The possible mechanism for the significant enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4–CdS–NiS ternary nanohybrids was also proposed. This work demonstrates that constructing 1D/2D hybrid materials loaded by noble-metal-free cocatalysts is a promising strategy for developing high efficiency earth-abundant photocatalysts for application in photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
All reagents, including cyanamide (CH2N2, 50% in water), cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O), nickel acetate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O) and thiocarbamide (H2NCSNH2), were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis
g-C3N4–CdS–NiS ternary nanohybrids and CdS nanorods/g-C3N4 nanosheets 1D/2D hybrid nanoheterojunctions were fabricated by a facile two-step wet chemistry approach, as illustrated in Scheme 1. The Cd–g-C3N4 was first prepared by a simple and efficient electrostatic adsorption method. Then, the ternary or binary nanocomposites were synthesized by a hydrothermal in situ growth process. The detailed experimental conditions and steps were as follows:
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the synthetic route of g-C3N4/CdS/NiS ternary nanocomposites. 

2.2.1 Synthesis of pristine g-C3N4 and Cd–g-C3N4. 
In a typical procedure, 0.3752 g Cd(NO3)2·4H2O was dissolved in 10 mL distilled water and then 10 mL cyanamide was added and stirred for 1 h. Then the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 4 h. The autoclave was cooled down naturally and a yellow precipitate was collected, washed, and dried in air. And then, the obtained yellow solid was transferred to a crucible with a lid and heated under a nitrogen gas at 2.3 °C min−1 up to 550 °C and kept at this temperature for another 4 h.
According to the same method described above, the pristine g-C3N4 was prepared in the absence of cadmium nitrate and ultrasonic treatment.


2.2.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4 nanosheets/CdS nanorods hybrid materials. 
In a typical synthesis, 0.3 g of obtained Cd/g-C3N4 powders were first dispersed in a thiourea solution via ultrasonic exfoliation for 2 h. The mixed suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and kept at 150 °C for 4 h in an oven before cooling down to room temperature. Finally, the sample was collected, washed with distilled water several times, vacuum-dried and stored for further characterization.


2.2.3 Synthesis of g-C3N4/CdS/NiS ternary nanohybrids. 
0.3 g of obtained Cd/g-C3N4 powders were dispersed in 10 mL of distilled water via ultrasonic treatment for 30 min, and then a calculated amount of 0.05 M nickel acetate solution was added and stirred for 1 h. After that, 10 mL of thiourea solution (2 g thiourea) was dropwise added. The mixed suspension was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and kept at 150 °C for 4 h in an oven before cooling down to room temperature. Finally, the sample was collected, washed with distilled water several times, vacuum-dried and stored for further characterization.

2.3. Characterization
The crystal structure of samples was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku D/max 2500v/pc X-ray diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 4° min−1. The UV-visible absorption was measured by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (TU1901, China). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a VG ESCALAB250 surface analysis system using a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (300 W, 5 mA, and 15 kV). The base pressure was about 3 × 10−9 mbar. The shift of the binding energy owing to relative surface charging was corrected using the C 1s level at 284.6 eV as an internal standard. The specific surface area was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method at 77 K. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured on a Quantachrome NOVA1000 Sorptomatic apparatus. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were collected on an F20 S-TWIN electron microscope (Tecnai G2, FEI Co.), at a 200 kV accelerating voltage. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a LS 50B (PerkinElmer, Inc., USA) with an excitation wavelength of 363 nm at room temperature.
2.4. Photocatalytic reaction procedures
Photocatalytic water splitting was carried out in a LabSolar H2 photocatalytic hydrogen evolution system (Perfectlight, Beijing) including a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Trusttech). In a typical photocatalytic reaction, 50 mg of powder sample was dispersed in an aqueous solution (100 mL) containing 10% triethanolamine by volume. Then the system was sealed and vacuumized to keep the pressure as −0.1 MPa. Then, a circular cooling water system was turned on and the reactor was irradiated with a Xe lamp (300 W) with a UV cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) under magnetic stirring. The gases evolved were analyzed on line with a gas chromatograph (GC-7900, TCD, with N2 as the carrier gas) after 0.5 h of illumination. The reaction was continued for 2.5 h.
2.5. Electrochemical tests
The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 5 mg of photocatalyst powders were added into 2 mL of ethanol and 20 μL of 0.25% Nafion solution to make a slurry, and the powders were dispersed using ultrasonication. 500 μL of the solution was injected onto a 2 × 6 cm2 fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO) glass substrate. The resulting electrodes were dried in an oven and calcined at 150 °C for 1 h in a N2 gas flow.

2.5.1 Transient photocurrent tests. 
Transient photocurrent experiments were conducted on an electrochemical analyzer (BAS100 Instruments) in a standard three-electrode system using the as-prepared working electrodes as the working electrodes, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as a reference electrode. 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. A Xe lamp (300 W) with a UV cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as a light source.


2.5.2 The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). 
The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the above-mentioned working electrodes in the three-electrode system were also recorded via a computer controlled IM6e impedance measurement unit (Zahner Elektrik, Germany) over a frequency range of 0.01 to 105 Hz with an ac amplitude of 5 mV, under visible light illumination and in the dark. 0.1 M Na2S and 0.02 M Na2SO3 aqueous solutions were used as the electrolytes.


2.5.3 Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 
The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution was tested using a three-electrode cell. Linear sweep voltammetry with a 5 mV s−1 scan rate was performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution under continuous purging with N2. The reference, counter, and working electrodes were a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a Pt flake, and a glassy carbon electrode, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared as follows: 2 mg of photocatalyst powder were ultrasonically dispersed in 1 mL ethanol (for >1 hour) and then deposited on a glassy carbon electrode with 10 μL of the solution. After drying the ink, 25 μL of 5 wt% Nafion was diluted with 1 mL of ethanol; 5 μL of that solution was then added on top of the catalyst layer. Time dependence of the current density was obtained for g-C3N4/9% NiS at a static potential of −803 mV for 6 h in 0.5 M H2SO4.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
The crystalline structure and phase purity of the as-prepared samples were investigated by XRD measurements. The X-ray diffraction patterns of pure g-C3N4, g-C3N4–CdS and g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 1A. As can be seen from Fig. 1A, two distinct diffraction peaks were observed at approximately 2θ = 27.5° and 13.2° for the pure g-C3N4 sample, which are also consistent with those of g-C3N4 in the literature.54 The results indicate that these two diffraction peaks can be indexed to the (002) and (100) diffraction planes for g-C3N4, respectively (JCPDS #87-1526).55,56 The strong (002) peak at 2θ = 27.5°, corresponding to an interlayer distance of 0.325 nm, is a characteristic interlayer stacking reflection of conjugated aromatic systems, indicating that pure bulk g-C3N4 was well crystallized.54 Interestingly, it was also found that the intensity of this (002) peak in composite photocatalysts significantly decreases, as compared that of bulk g-C3N4. The possible reasons can be ascribed to the formation of ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets through a liquid exfoliation process,32 and the introduction of CdS nanorods. Furthermore, it was also observed from Fig. 1A that the characteristic peaks with 2θ values of 24.81°, 26.51°, 28.18°, 36.62°, 43.68°, 47.84° and 51.82° were assigned to diffraction peaks from the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) crystal planes of CdS (JCPDS #41-1049), respectively.57 These peaks fully indicate that the well-crystallized hexagonal CdS phase with lattice parameters a = 4.14 Å and c = 6.72 Å was successfully loaded on the g-C3N4 nanosheets. In addition, the XRD patterns of g-C3N4–CdS with different NiS loading percentages are shown in Fig. 1B. As shown in Fig. 1B, the XRD pattern of g-C3N4–CdS–15% NiS reveals diffraction peaks at 30.17°, 34.74°, 46.03°, 53.55° and 73.33°, which can attributed to diffraction peaks from the (100), (101), (102), (110) and (202) crystal planes of the hexagonal NiS phase (JCPDS #02-1280). However, no diffraction peaks of NiS were observed in the XRD pattern of g-C3N4–CdS composites with other NiS loading percentages, which may be due to the low contents and high dispersion of NiS in these samples.

3.2. TEM and EDX characterization
In order to investigate the morphology and microstructure of g-C3N4–CdS–NiS composites, TEM images of different samples were obtained. Fig. 2a and b show the representative TEM images of the bulk g-C3N4 and CdS, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, the as-prepared bulk g-C3N4 is indeed composed of few nanometer sized 2D nanostructures assembled from few-layered ultrathin nanosheets. Also, it can be seen from Fig. 2b that the pure CdS structures were made up of nanoparticles with an average diameter of approximately 60–100 nm. Furthermore, the TEM images of binary systems such as g-C3N4–CdS and g-C3N4–9% NiS were also investigated, which were shown in Fig. 2c and d, respectively. Clearly, it can be observed from Fig. 2c that CdS nanorods were distributed uniformly on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets, avoiding the irregular aggregation of pure CdS nanorods in the absence of g-C3N4 nanosheets. Further observation shows that the length and diameter of CdS nanorods were about 10 and 100 nm, respectively. It is interesting to note that the thickness of g-C3N4 of g-C3N4–CdS (in Fig. 2c) is much smaller than that of bulk g-C3N4 (in Fig. 2a), suggesting that the bulk g-C3N4 has been only partially exfoliated into 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets through a 2 h ultrasonic process. However, it is still far from single-layer or few-layer g-C3N4 nanosheets, implying that a 2 h ultrasonic process is not enough long to obtain completely exfoliated few-layer g-C3N4 nanosheets. Thus, to construct more efficient g-C3N4 nanosheet-based photocatalysts, a long-time ultrasonic treatment and new exfoliation methods are highly expected in future studies.58–60 In addition, some irregular NiS nanoparticles with a size of 10–40 nm could be found to be well dispersed on the surface of 2D bulk g-C3N4 nanostructures (see Fig. 2d). Compared with Fig. 2b, it is easily identified from Fig. 2e that some CdS nanorods in the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample were also covered with a strongly adherent NiS layer. To further reveal the intimate interface contacts between different components in the ternary nanohybrids, the HRTEM image of the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample was obtained, as displayed in Fig. 2f. Obviously, the HRTEM image of the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample exhibits clear lattice fringes of NiS nanoparticles and CdS nanorods on top of those of 2D C3N4 nanosheets. It is obvious that a lattice spacing of ca. 0.324 nm corresponds to the (002) plane of hexagonal g-C3N4 (JCPDS #87-1526). The lattice fringes of with a spacing of ca. 0.207 and 0.296 nm can be assigned to the (110) and (100) plane of hexagonal CdS (JCPDS #41-1049) and NiS (JCPDS #02-1280), respectively. The HRTEM results clearly demonstrated that intimate heterostructures in the ternary nanohybrids have been achieved instead of a simple physical mixture of three components, which are responsible for rapid charge separation in the electron-transfer process and photoactivity enhancement. More importantly, the EDS spectrum of the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample is shown in Fig. 3, further confirming that the sample contains the obvious signals of C, N, Cd and S elements.

 Fig. 3  EDS spectrum of the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample. 
Based on the above results, it is clear that the in situ growth of CdS nanorods could be mainly achieved using the Cd-containing carbon nitride (Cd–g-C3N4) nanosheets as precursors. On the contrary, only CdS nanoparticles could be obtained in the absence of Cd-containing g-C3N4 nanosheets. It is known that g-C3N4 has a pretty good capacity to capture cations through the strong interactions between the cations and the negatively charged nitrogen atoms within the g-C3N4.9,61 Therefore, it is proposed that the possible in situ growth of CdS nanorods along the incorporated Cd2+ ions into the framework of g-C3N4 could proceed in the void zones around the “nitrogen pots”.61
The XPS measurements are employed to further confirm the chemical composition and surface chemical state of the as-prepared g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS, as depicted in Fig. 4a–f. The typical XPS survey spectrum of the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample is displayed in Fig. 4a, which undoubtedly indicates the co-existence of the elements C, N, Cd, Ni, S and a small amount of O. The corresponding high resolution XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Cd 3d, S 2p and Ni 2p of the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample are shown in Fig. 4b–f, respectively. Obviously, the high-resolution spectrum of C 1s shown in Fig. 4b could be fitted into two peaks centered at 284.6 eV and 288.6 eV. The peak at 284.6 eV could be indexed to the sp2 C–C bonds in a purely carbonaceous environment,19 which may originate from the graphitic or amorphous carbon species adsorbed on the surface of the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample due to its exposure to air.37 However, the main peak located at 288.6 eV could be attributed to the sp2-bonded carbon in the triazine rings (N–CN), confirming the major carbon environment in the g-C3N4.38 It is also observed from Fig. 4c that the main peak of the N 1s spectrum located at 398.55 eV obviously exhibits an asymmetrical feature, which is commonly associated with the sp2-bonded N in N-containing aromatic rings (N–CN) in g-C3N4, further indicating the presence of g-C3N4.37,38 In addition, the binding energies of Cd 3d (Fig. 4d) are determined to be 405.1 eV and 411.86 eV (Fig. 4d), which match well with the reported values of the Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 for Cd2+ in the CdS nanorods.57Fig. 4e shows the main S 2p peaks centered at 161.5 eV and 162.8 eV, which are in good accordance with the literature values for the binding energies of sulfide ions in CdS nanorods and NiS cocatalysts.26,62 The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p in Fig. 4f exhibit one weak peak corresponding to the binding energy of 858.4 eV, which is close to the reported values for NiS.26,48 In addition, the weight concentrations of CdS and NiS were measured to be about 6.3% (in good agreement with the thermogravimetric data, as shown in Fig. S1†) and 8.8%, which are very close to their corresponding design values. The above results further confirmed that the as-obtained g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample is composed of g-C3N4, CdS and NiS.

3.3. Textural properties and UV-visible absorption spectra
The textural properties of the prepared samples were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments. Fig. 5 shows the adsorption–desorption isotherms of nitrogen at 77 K and the corresponding pore size distributions (the inset) for g-C3N4, g-C3N4–CdS and g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, three tested samples show a typical type IV adsorption–desorption isotherm according to the IUPAC classification.63 Furthermore, obvious H3 hysteresis loops were observed for three samples at high relative pressures close to unity, indicating the formation of the slit-shaped mesopores and macropores due to the aggregates of plate-like g-C3N4 nanosheets.63 The pore-size distributions (inset in Fig. 5) of g-C3N4, g-C3N4–CdS and g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS composites further confirm the existence of mesopores and macropores. The porous structure parameters of pure g-C3N4, g-C3N4–CdS and g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS composites are listed in Table 1. As listed in Table 1, the BET specific surface area (SBET) of g-C3N4, g-C3N4–CdS and g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS is 23.11, 26.73 and 32.48 for g-C3N4, g-C3N4–CdS and g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS, respectively. Clearly, the introduction of CdS nanorods and NiS nanoparticles could lead to the increase of specific surface area and the decrease of pore diameter, implying they have been successfully loaded into the pores of g-C3N4 nanosheets. In addition, the significant enhancement in the SBET after loading CdS and NiS may be also beneficial for increasing surface active sites and photoactivities.

The optical properties of pure g-C3N4 and its composites were also determined by the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. Fig. 6 depicts the UV-vis absorption spectra of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 6, the onset of the absorption edge of pure g-C3N4 is located at about 450 nm, corresponding to a band-gap energy of 2.75 eV, which is in good accordance with the reported value in the literature.54 As compared to the pure g-C3N4 sample, the composites containing CdS showed a red-shifted absorption edge at around 520 nm, indicating that CdS plays an important role in enhancing the visible-light absorption of g-C3N4 as an excellent photosensitizer. The corresponding band-gap energy is estimated to be 2.4 eV, which is consistent with the intrinsic band gap of CdS,64 further suggesting that CdS nanorods have been successfully introduced into these two composites. Especially for the ternary g-C3N4–CdS–NiS nanohybrids and the binary g-C3N4–9% NiS, the substantially enhanced light absorption was apparently observed in the visible region ranging from 550 to 800 nm, as compared to pure g-C3N4 and g-C3N4–CdS samples. Importantly, the visible-light absorption level from 550 to 800 nm also substantially increased with increasing loading content of NiS co-catalysts. Clearly, the obtained ternary g-C3N4–CdS–NiS samples exhibited the strongest absorption intensity in the visible region, which was further confirmed by their observed obvious color change from yellow to green. Thus, this significantly enhanced visible-light absorption that can be attributed to the loading of NiS co-catalysts, suggesting that Ni2+ ions were highly dispersed on the surface of g-C3N4–CdS rather than doped into the CdS lattice. The decreased band gap and enhanced visible-light absorption of the composite samples could lead to an efficient increase in the production of photo-generated charges, thus facilitating the enhancement of their photocatalytic activity.

3.4. Photocatalytic hydrogen production
To further verify the photocatalytic H2 generation from water splitting, the H2-evolution activities of all samples were also examined in aqueous solution containing triethanolamine (10 vol%) as the sacrificial agent under visible light irradiation. No obvious H2 was detected over all samples in the blank experiments, suggesting that H2 was truly generated in the photocatalytic process.2 Several typical time courses of H2 evolution from different photocatalysts under visible light irradiation are shown in Fig. 7A. As observed in Fig. 7A, the rates of hydrogen evolution over all samples exhibited a non-linear increase during the whole photocatalytic reactions. Obviously, H2-evolution rate slightly decreased with an increase in the time of the photocatalytic reaction, implying that photocatalysts are not very stable under light illumination.
 Fig. 7  (A) The average rate of H2 evolution and (B) time courses of photocatalytic H2 evolution over the photocatalysts: (a) g-C3N4; (b) g-C3N4–CdS; (c) g-C3N4–9% NiS; (d) CdS–9% NiS; (e) g-C3N4–CdS–3% NiS; (f) g-C3N4–CdS–6% NiS; (g) g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS; (h) g-C3N4–CdS–12% NiS; (i) g-C3N4–CdS–15% NiS. Reaction conditions: catalyst, 0.05 g; 10 mL triethanolamine; 90 mL distilled water; light source, xenon lamp (300 W) with a UV cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). 
For comparison, the average photocatalytic H2-evolution rates over various photocatalysts with different loading amounts of NiS cocatalysts are also calculated and shown in Fig. 7B. As shown in Fig. 7B, during the 2.5 h photocatalytic reaction process, the average rates of hydrogen evolution were determined to be 1.62, 77, 128, 577, 1519, 1998, 2563, 2233 and 1997 μmol g−1 h−1 for g-C3N4, g-C3N4–CdS, g-C3N4–9% NiS, CdS–9% NiS, g-C3N4–CdS–3% NiS, g-C3N4–CdS–6% NiS, g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS, g-C3N4–CdS–12% NiS and g-C3N4–CdS–15% NiS, respectively. Obviously, all of five ternary composite photocatalysts exhibit better photoactivities than the pure g-C3N4, binary g-C3N4–CdS 2D/1D hybrid photocatalysts, g-C3N4–9% NiS and CdS–9% NiS. Especially, the loading of 9% NiS onto the g-C3N4–CdS 2D/1D hybrid photocatalyst could achieve the highest H2-evolution rate, which is approximately 33-fold higher than that of the sample without loading NiS. Similarly, the average H2-evolution rate of the g-C3N4–CdS 2D/1D hybrid photocatalyst is about 47 times larger than that of the pure g-C3N4. As a result, the average H2-evolution rate of the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS was about 1582 times that of the pure g-C3N4. Moreover, the H2-evolution activities of g-C3N4–CdS–NiS ternary nanohybrids are much higher than those of CdS quantum dots (or nanoparticles)/g-C3N4,37 NiS/g-C3N4,26,48 MoS2/g-C3N4,56 graphene/C3N4,28 WS2/g-C3N465 and Ni(OH)2/g-C3N466 composites. In addition, it should be noted that the H2 production rate increased firstly and then decreased with further noble metal-free NiS loading. The most probable cause is that appropriate amounts of NiS can act as co-catalysts to suppress the recombination of photoelectrons and holes, thus leading to an enhanced photocatalytic activity for water decomposition over g-C3N4–CdS photocatalysts. While, adding an excess amount of NiS (>9%) was shown to reduce the photocatalytic activity of the g-C3N4–CdS–NiS ternary nanohybrids, due to the optical shielding effect of NiS cocatalysts and weakened interfacial coupling between C3N4 and CdS. From these results, it can be concluded that the synergistic effects of NiS cocatalyst loading and 1D/2D nanoheterojunctions are crucial to achieve the remarkable photoactivity enhancement of the g-C3N4–CdS–NiS ternary hybrids.
The photostability of a given photocatalyst is also crucial for its practical application. Thus, the long-term photostability and reproducibility of the as-prepared ternary g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS photocatalyst for H2 evolution were further evaluated through five consecutive runs under the same conditions. Each cycle was performed under visible light irradiation for 2.5 h. After each run, the reaction system was re-evacuated. Fig. 8 displays the recycling measurements of photocatalytic H2 evolution over the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm). As seen in Fig. 8, there is a noticeable activity loss (almost 20%) in the second recycle. It is believed that the decreased catalytic activity over the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample mainly originated from the photocorrosion of some exposed CdS nanorods.67 A similar trend has also been observed in some published papers.67,68 Furthermore, it should be also noted that the H2 generation rate remains constant after the second recycle, suggesting that the ternary hybrid strategy could partially suppress the photocorrosion of CdS in the composite photocatalyst, thus favoring its application in sustainable reuse.

3.5. Discussion of mechanism
The charge recombination and transfer can be further investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The PL spectra have been regarded as an efficient approach to study the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs on the semiconductor upon irradiation. Fig. 9 presents the PL spectra of pure g-C3N4, g-C3N4–CdS, g-C3N4–9% NiS and g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS samples at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 363 nm. As observed from Fig. 9, it is evident that the pure g-C3N4, g-C3N4–CdS, g-C3N4–9% NiS and g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS exhibit similar emission trends, with the principle peak at around 450 nm, which can be attributed to the recombination of electron–hole pairs in the g-C3N4.69 The g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample was found to have a lower PL intensity than g-C3N4–CdS which showed a weaker intensity compared with the pure g-C3N4. This indicates that a lower recombination rate of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs can be efficiently realized under visible-light illumination due to the loading of CdS and NiS, further leading to significantly enhancing photocatalysis efficiency of the as-prepared g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample. However, the g-C3N4–9% NiS exhibits a lower PL peak as compared to the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample, indicating the slower charge recombination in the g-C3N4–9% NiS. It is believed that the g-C3N4–9% NiS sample possesses much fewer photo-generated electron–hole pairs, thus leading to the lower charge recombination. As discussed above, the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity. Thus, it is clear that the PL spectral results are in agreement with the photocatalytic activities of corresponding samples in most cases, suggesting that the separation efficiency of photoexcited charge carriers plays a significant role in determining the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts.

To further deeply understand the photocatalytic enhancement mechanism for H2 evolution, the transfer and separation of photo-generated charge carriers were also investigated through the photoelectrochemical (PEC) analysis. The transient photocurrent–time (I–t) curves recorded for the above three samples under intermittent visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) are demonstrated in Fig. 10. As observed in Fig. 10, it is obvious that the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS photocatalysts exhibit an apparently boosted photocurrent density as compared to unmodified g-C3N4 and binary samples, respectively. Notably, the photocurrent of the g-C3N4–9% NiS sample is much higher than that of the g-C3N4–CdS, indicating that the NiS co-catalysts could more efficiently enhance the interfacial charge transfer. These PEC results suggest that the ternary hybrids could achieve remarkably improved separation and transfer of photo-excited electron–hole pairs, thus greatly contributing to the photoactivity enhancements.

To further confirm the enhanced charge separation rate, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in the dark and under visible light were also performed, which is one of the most powerful techniques to study the interfacial charge transfer and recombination rates occurring in the three-electrode systems. The EIS Nyquist plots of four different samples in the dark and under visible light are shown in Fig. 11a and b, respectively. As displayed in Fig. 11b, the EIS Nyquist plot of g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS photocatalyst exhibits the smallest semicircle in the middle-frequency region in comparison with those of g-C3N4, g-C3N4–CdS and g-C3N4–9% NiS, which indicates the fastest interfacial electron transfer in the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS sample. It is believed that the combined effects, including the loading of NiS co-catalysts and stronger interfacial interaction between CdS and g-C3N4, lead to the accelerated charge transport and separation, thus resulting in the significantly improved photocatalytic H2-production activity. Comparing the EIS Nyquist plots of four different samples in the dark and under visible light irradiation, it is clearly observed that the loading of NiS nanoparticles is favorable for the charge separation in each case, indicating the positive roles of loaded NiS nanoparticles as H2-evolution electrocatalysts or co-catalysts. However, CdS can only accelerate the charge separation in binary or ternary samples under visible-light illumination, further confirming the important roles of CdS as an excellent photosensitizer in boosting the photocatalytic activities.

It is generally accepted that the H2-evolution reactions caused by photo-generated electrons on the surface active sites are similar to those in electrolysis.2 To further identify the positive roles of NiS co-catalysts in this system as active sites, the polarization curves and the time dependence of current density were also carried out. Fig. 12a shows the electrocatalytic H2-evolution activity for typical five kinds of nanomaterials using a standard three-electrode configuration in 0.5 M H2SO4 acidic solution. As observed from these curves in Fig. 12a, among all samples, NiS exhibits the highest catalytic activity for H2 evolution, while there is no obvious H2-evolution activity for the g-C3N4–CdS sample. It can be also found that the onset potential of NiS for electrocatalytic H2 evolution is about −0.35 V (in 0.5 M H2SO4). According to the linear pH dependence with a slope of 0.059 V per pH, an overpotential of −0.75 V (at pH = 7) was obtained, which was obviously lower than the conduction band (CB) potentials of CdS (−0.9 V at pH = 7) and g-C3N4 (−1.25 V at pH = 7), respectively.3,70 Therefore, the photo-generated electrons from CdS or g-C3N4 have enough capacity to enable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution over NiS co-catalysts. These results clearly suggested that NiS nanoparticles played a key role as H2-evolution co-catalysts. In addition, it should also be noted from Fig. 12a that the g-C3N4 sample as a metal-free electrocatalyst also exhibits obvious H2-evolution activity, with an onset potential of −0.75 V (in 0.5 M H2SO4), which is consistent with the previous results from Qiao's group.71–74 Importantly, the electrocatalytic H2-evolution activity of g-C3N4 could be greatly enhanced through loading 9% NiS nanoparticles. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 12b, the smaller loss in current density also indicates the excellent electrochemical stability of the g-C3N4/9% NiS sample. These results further confirmed that the binary g-C3N4/NiS material could act as potential bifunctional catalysts for both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic H2-evolution reactions.
 Fig. 12  (a) Polarization curves of different samples were measured at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 acidic solution; (b) time dependence of the current density obtained for g-C3N4–9% NiS at a static potential of −803 mV for 6 h in 0.5 M H2SO4. 
On the basis of the above results including PL spectra, photocurrent measurements, EIS, and photocatalytic activity results, a probable possible photocatalytic H2-evolution mechanism using the composite photocatalysts is proposed and illustrated in Scheme 2. Under visible-light irradiation, g-C3N4 and CdS were excited to generate electron–hole pairs. The photoinduced electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 can directly shift to the CB of CdS, because the CB position of g-C3N4 is higher than that of CdS. The electrons excited from the CB of CdS together with the rest electrons on the CB of g-C3N4 will accumulate on the NiS and then electrochemically release H2 with the reduction of H+.48,52 On the other hand, compared with the CdS quantum dots (or nanoparticles)/g-C3N4 photocatalysts, the in situ growth of 1D CdS nanorods on 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets could not only increase the interfacial contact area between CdS and g-C3N4, but also enhance the intimacy of their interfacial contacts.75 These two factors are also favorable for the efficient charge separation, thus facilitating the photocatalytic activity enhancement. In a word, the unexpectedly high activity of the g-C3N4–CdS–NiS ternary hybrids can be ascribed to the synergistic effects of improved water reduction kinetics through loading NiS cocatalysts and prolonged lifetime of photogenerated electron–hole pairs by constructing 1D/2D nanoheterojunctions. The result demonstrated that loading an appropriate amount of NiS onto the CdS/g-C3N4 1D/2D nanohybrids is a promising strategy to develop highly efficient H2-evolution photocatalysts.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated that g-C3N4–CdS–NiS ternary composite photocatalysts can be fabricated by a two-step wet chemistry method. The ternary composite exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution than the pure g-C3N4 and binary composite photocatalysts. In particular, the g-C3N4–CdS–9% NiS shows a 1582-fold increase in the average rate of hydrogen evolution as compared to the g-C3N4. The roles of CdS and NiS co-catalysts in boosting the H2-evolution activity of g-C3N4 were revealed. It is believed that the synergistic effects of loading NiS cocatalysts and constructing CdS/g-C3N4 1D/2D nanoheterojunctions can improve the separation of electron–hole pairs, visible-light absorption and water reduction kinetics, thereby achieving an unexpectedly enhanced H2-evolution activity of the g-C3N4–CdS–NiS ternary hybrids. This work could not only provide an excellent candidate for visible-light H2 evolution, but also offer a new and facile in situ growth approach to explore highly efficient g-C3N4-based hybrid semiconductor nanocomposites for photocatalytic H2-evolution. The combined strategies deserve more attention in constructing high-activity composite photocatalysts. It is expected that more efficient g-C3N4-based composite photocatalysts based on multidimensional hybrid and co-catalyst loading could be achieved for various applications in the near future.
