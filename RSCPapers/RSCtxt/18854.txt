    , Accepted 16th January 2022First published on 17th January 2022AbstractAs an artificial perception system, a neuromorphic vision sensing system can imitate the complex image sensing and processing functions of a human visual neural network. In order to simulate the nervous system, people often need to integrate multiple functional components such as sensors and processors into a sophisticated circuit system or prepare a multi-functional optoelectronic device through a complex and tedious process. The high cost and complicated preparation process will undoubtedly limit the future development of a neuromorphic vision system. Herein, we show a perovskite-based transformational photodetector that can mimic image sensing and preprocessing functions in a vision system. The pristine photodetector is prepared by a simple one-step method and has an on–off ratio of ∼107, a low noise current of ∼4.27 × 10−13 A Hz−0.5, a −3 dB bandwidth of 185 kHz, and a specific detectivity of 3.48 × 1011 Jones. Then, we utilize the reversible interaction between NH3 and MAPbI3, and adjust irradiation to induce dynamic transformation of the perovskite, so that the photocurrent of the photodetector exhibits enhanced behavior of short-term synaptic plasticity over time. The photocurrent with 3.36 mW light intensity shows ∼225% enhancement after 60 pulses, while the photocurrent with 0.48 mW light intensity shows ∼178% enhancement, which can enhance the contrast of the transmitted image and realize the image transmission and preprocessing functions of a neuromorphic vision sensing system. We believe that this work will provide new potential for the future application of photodetectors in neuromorphic vision sensing.
Introduction
As a functional element that converts light signals into electrical signals, photodetectors can perceive information such as light, color, and images, and are widely used in digital photography, environmental detection, medical imaging, and military reconnaissance.1–3 With the continuous development of smart technology, people are gradually moving towards the time of the Internet of Things (IoT). Imaging photodetectors, as the interface between an artificial system and the real world, are required to have better performance, be multi-functional and exhibit higher work efficiency. However, most imaging photodetectors at the present stage can only perceive and transmit image information in real time, and need to combine with other functional devices (e.g. memristors and complex programmable logic devices) to form a bionic vision system, which will generate a large amount of redundant data, reduce the response speed of the system and increase the difficulty of manufacturing.4–8 In contrast, under the law of survival of the fittest, the natural visual system continues to develop and evolve, enabling rapid and accurate object recognition in complex environments and preprocessing image information before it is transmitted to the brain.9–13 For example, the human visual neural network is a high-precision, high-performance imaging system. Even though some reported neuromorphic vision sensors have multiple functions, most of them are transistor structures and the manufacturing process is also very complicated. Thus, to promote the continuous development of artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to develop a simple, high-performance and multi-functional photodetector to mimic the neuromorphic vision sensing system.
Considering that a photodetector is a photoelectric conversion device, the selection of photosensitive materials is very important. So far, most neuromorphic vision sensors have used MoS2, MoOx, In2O3, ZnO, and other metal sulfides, metal oxides, or carbon-type materials (e.g. graphene) as photosensitive materials.8,10,14–17 These materials have high carrier mobility and suitable band gaps, but they are mostly made by high-temperature CVD or PVD. The harsh conditions in fabrication bring high costs and hamper their subsequent development for practical applications.
Halide lead perovskites, as a new class of semiconductor materials with an ABX3 structure, have excellent optoelectronic properties, including a large light absorption coefficient, fast carrier mobility, an adjustable band gap and so on.18–20 They are ideal photoactive materials for optoelectronic devices including LEDs,21,22 solar cells,23,24 memory devices,25,26etc. At the same time, perovskites have also gained great investigation interest for application in sensing devices for the detection of photons, high-energy rays, gases, etc.27–29 Moreover, due to their special crystal structure, perovskites can interact with amido or other donor molecules and form coordination compounds,30–35 in which this transformation will change the optical and electrical properties of perovskite materials. It is worth noting that some of the transformations are controllable and reversible because the formation/dissociation of charge-transfer complex bonds requires little energy, which paves the way for realizing functional optoelectronic devices. For example, Lance M. Wheeler and his coworkers leverage the low formation/dissociation energy of the methylammonium lead iodide–methylamine complex (MAPbI3·xCH3NH2) to produce a smart window with a switchable photovoltaic device that can dynamically respond to sunlight.36 The device exhibits characteristics similar to synapse in the biological nervous system (e.g. neuromorphic vision sensing), which can change the internal chemical fluxes when it is externally stimulated, thereby adjusting the synaptic strength or weight.37
In this work, we employ transformational NH4PbI3·MA as the photoactive material in a photodetector to realize some functions of the neuromorphic vision sensing system in a single photodetector device. This photodetector works in an environment containing NH3. In the dark, NH3 interacts with MAPbI3 to form NH4PbI3·MA, which shows negligible response to light. Under the work conditions, irradiation provides the thermal energy that can control NH4PbI3·MA to release NH3 resulting in photoactive MAPbI3. Through the dynamic and reversible interactions between MAPbI3 and NH3, the photocurrent of the device will change correspondingly and exhibit short-term synaptic plasticity, so that the device exhibits neuromorphic learning enhancement behavior. Upon irradiation for a specified time and intensity, the photodetector can improve the image contrast while sensing image information, and realize the image transmission and preprocessing functions of the neuromorphic vision sensing system, which improves the efficiency of subsequent work.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a presents the schematic diagram of the neuromorphic vision sensing system, in which the synapse (Fig. 1b), the connection part of two neurons, is composed of the presynaptic membrane (the former neuron), the synaptic cleft, and the postsynaptic membrane (the latter neuron). It is the sensing and processing unit for signal transmission between neurons. When subjected to different external stimuli, the synapse will change its internal chemical flow (neurotransmitter), thereby changing the strength or amplitude of the connection between two neurons (synaptic weight), which can be measured by the changes of the postsynaptic membrane current.37–39 This property is called synaptic plasticity and can be divided into short-term synaptic plasticity and long-term synaptic plasticity. Short-term synaptic plasticity plays an important role in information transmission and processing, and is also related to high-level neuronal activities such as attention and learning.40,41 In order to realize short-term synaptic plasticity, making photodetectors have new functions and applications, we leverage the reversible transition mechanism of the interaction between MAPbI3 and NH3, and produce a photodetector using NH4PbI3·MA as the photoactive material, as shown in Fig. 1c. Upon irradiation, NH3 will dissociate/complex with MAPbI3 just like neurotransmitters, so that the device exhibits short-term synaptic plasticity, exhibits the neuromorphic learning enhancement behavior, and realizes the image transmission and preprocessing functions in the neuromorphic vision sensing system.

Upon irradiation/In dark, NH3 will dissociate/complex with MAPbI3 just like a neurotransmitter. 
In order to verify the interaction between ammonia and MAPbI3, we first place MAPbI3 films in an ammonia atmosphere for 10 s, 20 s, and 30 s, respectively, while absorption, PL, and XRD spectroscopies were carried out at each stage. Fig. 2a shows the absorption plot as a function of time under an ammonia atmosphere. The absorption onset of the pristine MAPbI3 film is around 776 nm. Once the MAPbI3 films are immersed in ammonia, the absorption value of the MAPbI3 film decreases with the exposure time. Even for 30 s, the absorption value of the MAPbI3 film at 500 nm decreases to ∼30% of that of the pristine film. Similar to the decrease of the absorption value, the PL intensity of the film also changes accordingly, as shown in Fig. 2b. The PL peak of the MAPbI3 films is at ∼770 nm, and gaseous ammonia leads to a PL quenching of over 80% when the film has been placed in an NH3 atmosphere for 10 s. It can be inferred from the above results that the longer the film is exposed to the ammonia atmosphere, the more NH3 molecules that interact with MAPbI3, and the worse the optical characteristics of the film.
 Fig. 2  Characterization of the MAPbI3 film. (a) Absorption, (b) PL and (c) XRD patterns of perovskite films exposed to the NH3 atmosphere for 10 s, 20 s, and 30 s. (d) Absorption, (e) PL and (f) XRD patterns of 30 s-NH3-treated perovskite films under irradiation for 2 min, 4 min, and 6 min. Notably, the peaks belonging to NH4PbI3 were marked with pink stars, and the peaks belonging to MAI were marked with blue circles. 

Fig. 2c shows the corresponding XRD patterns of the MAPbI3 film before and after being exposed to the NH3 atmosphere. With an increase in the ammonia treatment time, the intensity of typical MAPbI3 perovskite peaks at 13.9° and 28.3° indexed to (110) and (220) gradually decreases, while a new characteristic peak appears at 9.3°. The intensity of this new peak continues to increase and even exceeds the characteristic peaks of the perovskite, which indicates that the crystal structure of MAPbI3 has changed as a result of the influence of ammonia. According to previous reports, the characteristic peak at 9.3° can be indexed to the (101) plane of NH4PbI3.42,43 This result confirms that proton exchange has occurred between MA+ and NH3, in which NH3 becomes NH4+ and MA+ becomes molecular MA. Hence, MAPbI3 gradually transformed to NH4PbI3 after NH3 treatment. The differences in the optical properties between MAPbI3 and NH4PbI3 result in the degradation of optical performance in MAPbI3 films as described above.
To further verify that the interaction between MAPbI3 and NH3 is reversible, the films treated in an NH3 atmosphere for 30 s were irradiated by a xenon lamp for 2 min, 4 min, and 6 min, while the absorption, PL, and XRD characterization were also conducted to trace the difference. It can be seen from Fig. 2d and e that the absorption value and PL intensity of the film begin to recover after gaining photothermal energy from irradiation, and increase with the irradiation time, although they cannot be completely restored to the initial value in the end. Fig. 2f depicts the changes in the XRD pattern. In good agreement with absorption and PL results, the intensity of the MAPbI3 characteristic peaks at 13.9° and 28.3° gains enhancement as irradiation time prolongs. It is worth noting that a new peak at ∼9.9° appeared after irradiation, which can be ascribed to residual MAI.44 Even so, all peaks belonging to MAPbI3 are almost restored when the irradiation time is up to 6 min. Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) present the variation in the morphology of the film. As observed in the top-view SEM image, the NH3 treatment destroys the quality of films, while the morphology of the film recovers after irradiation. This result identifies the reversible and controllable interaction between MAPbI3 and NH3, while this transformation can realize short-term synaptic plasticity behavior.
Notably, regarding the reversible reaction mechanism between MAPbI3 and NH3, the reported views are roughly divided into two types. Huang et al. pointed out that NH3 triggers MAPbI3 to form NH4PbI3, and MAPbI3 is recovered when treated with the MA gas (MAPbI3(s) + NH3(g) ↔ NH4PbI3(s) + MA(g)).42 However, Ruan et al. proposed that MA molecules are still bound to the [PbI6]4− octahedron and remain in the crystal structure after the proton exchange between MA+ and NH3, and the weakly coordinated NH4PbI3·MA complex can be easily decomposed to MAPbI3 by annealing and releasing NH3 (MAPbI3(s) + NH3(g) ↔ NH4PbI3·MA(s)).43 Considering our case, we believe that the reaction mechanism between MAPbI3 and NH3 belongs to the latter. Besides, the variation in the optical properties of the film at each stage of the reversible reaction lay a prerequisite for its application in neuromorphic visual sensing.
Based on the above transformation mechanism, the photodetector can exhibit neuromorphic learning enhancement behavior, which is related to short-term synaptic plasticity, and realize image transmission and preprocessing (contrast enhancement) functions of neuromorphic visual sensing. Fig. 3a shows the schematic diagram of our proposed device architecture. To ensure the reversible transformation between MAPbI3 and NH4PbI3·MA, the photodetector was placed in a glass cavity. In brief, we fabricated a vertical photodiode-type photodetector with a structure of ITO/NiOx/MAPbI3/PCBM/Ag. The optimization in device fabrication was conducted in terms of PCBM layer thickness (Fig. S3, ESI†), which was related to the concentration of the PCBM spin-coating solution.45 As we can observe, once the PCBM layer is too thin, it cannot cover the perovskite layer completely, and the direct contact between the perovskite and Ag electrode results in serious leakage currents.

The inset depicts the response to temporal square-wave signals at frequencies of 10 kHz, 100 kHz, and 600 KHz. (e) The noise current and (f) specific detectivity (D*) of the photodetector. 
Before we clarify the function of neuromorphic learning in our proposed photodetector, the characterization of its normal performance was conducted. Fig. 3b displays the current–voltage curves of the device under illumination of AM 1.5G and in the dark. As we can see, our device presents a good rectification behavior. Indeed, the current achieved at 0 V increased from 2.76 × 10−10 A in the dark to 2.74 × 10−3 A under illumination, which ensures a high Ion/Ioff ratio of ∼107 and reserves the ability to detect the weak signals. Fig. 3c displays the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and responsivity (R) of the device, which manifests a broad response to the photons, ranging from 300 to 800 nm. The responsivity is calculated according to the equation , where h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the light wavelength.46 It is clearly seen that the peak value of EQE reached 84.5% at 550 nm and the R was up to 0.428 A W−1 at 700 nm, which confirms that our photodetector has a high photoelectric conversion efficiency. Fig. 3d illustrates the normalized responsivity versus the modulation frequency of an LED and indicates that the −3 dB bandwidth is up to ∼185 kHz, which means that the response speed of the photodetector is faster than that of natural eyes. The inset shows the response to temporal square-wave signals at frequencies of 10 kHz, 100 kHz, and 600 kHz. More response to frequencies is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Moreover, the device possesses a noise current of ∼4.27 × 10−13 A Hz−0.5, as shown in Fig. 3e. Based on the above performance parameters, the specific detectivity (D*) of the device is further estimated according to the equation  shown in Fig. 3f, where R is the responsivity of the photodetector, A is the photoactive area, B is the constant bandwidth and Inoise is the dark noise current.46 The device had the largest value of D* of about 3.48 × 1011 Jones at 700 nm, which further demonstrates the excellent performance of photodetector's weak light detection. All the above parameters confirm the excellent performance of our photodetector.
The excellent performance of the original device ensures the subsequent realization of optically tunable synaptic plasticity and simultaneously guarantees neuromorphic visual sensing. To identify the short-term synaptic plasticity behavior and its influence on the device performance, we filled the cavity with NH3 gas and studied its effect on the EQE. As shown in Fig. 4a, the EQE of the device decreased when the cavity was full of NH3. In particular, the value at 550 nm decreased from 84.5% to 23.7% due to the formation of NH4PbI3·MA. To promote the reversible transformation from NH4PbI3·MA to MAPbI3, a 532 nm laser was employed to provide energy for accelerating decomposition in NH4PbI3·MA. As expected, under irradiation, as time increased, the EQE at 550 nm increased to 78.8% step by step (Fig. 4b). With irradiation time exceeding 120 s, the EQE showed negligible change. Notably, the EQE value cannot recover back to 84.5%, which is deduced to the decomposition of MAPbI3 into MAI, as shown in Fig. 2f.

To identify the neuromorphic learning in our photodetector due to short-term synaptic plasticity behavior caused by dynamical transformation, we next examined the response characteristics of the photodetector in a glass cavity containing NH3. Fig. 5a illustrates the schematic diagram of the measuring system and the switching process. We use a continuous 532 nm laser with a power density of ∼18.28 mW cm−2 for photothermal heating and used a periodically switched blue LED with a frequency of 1 Hz as a reference for variation in the photocurrent. Thereinto, the blue LED was placed much closer to the photodetector than the laser. During the test, we recorded the time-dependent response data every 20 s and summarized the results in Fig. 5b. The inset shows the waveform graph of the blue LED and 532 nm laser. In the beginning, the laser irradiation time was 0 s and the active layer was in a state of NH4PbI3·MA complexing. At this time, the maximum value of the photocurrent response of the square wave mainly came from the blue LED (ILED). Under 532 nm laser irradiation (>0 s), the complex NH4PbI3·MA decomposed into MAPbI3 and NH3, and the photoelectric conversion ability of the active layer improved. The maximum value of the photocurrent was the sum of the photocurrent from the laser and the LED (Itotal = ILED + Ilaser), while the bottom photocurrent value of the square wave was generated by the 532 nm laser (Ilaser). Moreover, the photocurrent from the laser gradually dominates the total photocurrent. For example, Ilaser/Itotal was correspondingly enlarged from 0.28 at 20 s to 0.89 at 100 s and then began to stabilize. The variation of the photocurrent over time demonstrates that the device persistently strengthens short-term synaptic plasticity, and also means that the optical information was gradually learned by our photodetector. More importantly, this process can be repeatable. When laser irradiation was turned off after 360 s, ammonia gas intercalated back into the active layer and recombined with MAPbI3 to form the NH4PbI3·MA complex. Ilaser dropped to zero, which means that the learned information had been eliminated. When the laser was turned on again, Ilaser increased and stabilized again, indicating that our photodetector could simulate the learning process again. Fig. S5 (ESI†) depicts the time-dependent response of the photodetector and the corresponding change of the photocurrent generated by 532 nm laser in 8 cycles. The photocurrent generated by 532 nm laser increases from 0.548 to 0.68 after the first cycle, and remains stable in the subsequent cycles, which indicates that the device can simulate the neuromorphic learning and forgetting behavior for multiple times.

The increase of the photocurrent demonstrates an increase in synaptic plasticity. It is worth noting that the proposed photodetector not only has excellent sensitivity to irradiation time, but also has a response to light intensity. Using the measuring system shown in Fig. 6a, the effect of light intensity on synaptic characteristics was investigated. Fig. 6b shows the photocurrent under a light source (a pulse width of 1 s) with different light intensities (0.48 mW and 3.36 mW). A higher light intensity gave rise to enhanced synaptic plasticity, including a higher photocurrent and a faster increase rate. After 60 pulses, the photocurrent with 3.36 mW light intensity had ∼225% enhancement while the photocurrent with 0.48 mW light intensity had just ∼178% enhancement. This characteristic can be understood as a result of dissociation of more NH4PbI3·MA complexes per unit time under irradiation with a higher intensity, which leads to a large number of photogenerated charge carriers.

(c) The predefined input image of letter N with different light intensities. (d) Measured training weight results of the letter N pattern in the initial state (0 pulse) and after training with 1, 10, 20, 30 and 60 pulses under 532 nm laser with two light intensities of 0.48 mW and 3.36 mW (pulse width, 1 s; pulse interval, 1 s). 
To elaborate on the practical application of the photodetector with the function of a neuromorphic vision sensing system, the proof-of-concept imaging was conducted. Here, we predefined to input a letter N image. The details of the setup and imaging experiment details are provided in the Experimental section. Fig. 6c and 6d illustrate the image mapping of the 5 × 5 array to two light intensities (0.48 mW and 3.36 mW), as well as the measured training weight (represents the photocurrent value) results in the initial state (0 pulse) and after training with 1, 10, 20, 30 and 60 pulses under a 532 nm laser with two light intensities. As the number of training pulses increases, the difference between the photocurrent generated by two light intensities becomes bigger. The reflected result is that the color contrast between the letter “N” and the background in the training weight graph increases, and the pattern becomes more accurate and clearer. This demonstrates that the proposed photodetector has the function of neuromorphic reinforcement learning that changes over time, which is similar to what happens in interpersonal communication, that is, the more the number of times you have seen someone, the deeper and clearer features of that person in your mind. This function can improve the contrast of image transmission so that the photodetector can realize image preprocessing and improve subsequent efficiency.
Conclusions
In summary, based on the reversible interaction mechanism between MAPbI3 and NH3, we produce a photodetector using transformational NH4PbI3·MA as the photoactive material. The photodetector shows excellent initial performance, a high Ion/Ioff ratio of ∼107, a fast response of −3 dB at 185 kHz, and a specific detectivity of 3.48 × 1011 Jones, which make the device meet the requirement of sensing weak signals. After the introduction of NH3, leveraging the light-induced perovskite dynamic transformation, the device exhibits light-tunable synaptic plasticity and performs the function of neuromorphic reinforcement learning. The photocurrent with 3.36 mW light intensity shows ∼225% enhancement after 60 pulses, while the photocurrent with 0.48 mW light intensity shows ∼178% enhancement, which enables the photodetector to realize the image transmission and preprocessing functions of a neuromorphic vision sensing system. We believe that the photodetector simulating neuromorphic vision sensing will provide a new idea for future detector functionalization, and it will also provide a promising research choice for neuromorphic vision sensors.
