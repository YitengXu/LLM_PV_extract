    , Accepted 2nd June 2019First published on 5th June 2019AbstractRealizing highly efficient and selective electrochemical CO2 reduction by using cost-effective catalysts is a key to the large-scale commercialization of this technology. In this work, a nanoporous amalgam catalyst with a tuneable amount of Ag–Hg bonding sites has been developed for selective CO2 electroreduction to formate or CO via a one-step wet-chemistry method. This catalyst is composed of a Ag(Hg) solid solution phase and a Ag–Hg intermetallic compound, exhibiting a loosened nanorod-channel network morphology. The Ag70Hg30 alloy drives efficient formate generation with a high faradaic efficiency of 85% at a moderate overpotential of 790 mV while the Ag91Hg9 alloy promotes CO2 reduction to CO with a faradaic efficiency of 58% at a low overpotential of 590 mV. The switchable product selectivity has been correlated with preferable formation of HCOO* or *COOH intermediates at Ag–Hg and Ag–Ag bonding sites. This work highlights amalgams as novel electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to valuable products on demand.
Introduction
The continuous increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere has been considered as a major cause of the unprecedented climate degradation.1–3 This has raised enormous interest in the sustainable utilization of CO2 in recent years, especially the conversion of CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals.4,5 The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is an attractive option, as it can be carried out under ambient conditions, via a carbon-neutral cycle, by using renewable energy sourced from solar and wind.6 The resultant products such as hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO), and formate can be used as feedstocks for well-established industrial infrastructures. In particular, formate has recently gained prominence as an efficient feedstock for fuel cell applications,7,8 while CO has been utilized for decades in the Fischer–Tropsch reaction for generating hydrocarbons, diesel, gasoline, etc.9,10 Different products from the CRR are needed for targeted applications to fulfill specific demands.
The electrocatalyst is a key for improving the reaction kinetics of the CRR and manipulating its product selectivity.11–14 However, most of the reported electrocatalysts only drove CO2 reduction to one dominant product such as CO or formate. Electrocatalysts with tuneable selectivity for generating two or more products at high faradaic efficiency (FE) can act as the versatile catalysts for manifold industrial applications. This striking design can also simplify the synthesis process and improve the utilization efficiency of catalysts. To date, only a few electrocatalysts have been developed for this purpose. For example, carbene ligand modified Pd is able to convert CO2 to formate with a high FE of 82%, but its selectivity for CO formation is less than 27%.15 Hoffman et al.16 fabricated dendritic Cu–In alloys as the electrocatalysts for formate and CO production; however, both of the FE values are limited (62% for formate and 35% for CO). Wang's group reported that Pd nanoparticles exhibited high FEs for formate at potentials positive to −0.2 V, and for CO at potentials negative to −0.5 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE).17 Unfortunately, the high FE of formate at a small overpotential is neutralized by a low current, resulting in limited formate production. Therefore, the development of efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction towards formate or CO is highly desired but challenging.
Herein, we have developed a nanoporous Ag–Hg (denoted as np-Ag–Hg) amalgam catalyst with tuneable composition for the CRR with switchable selectivity towards formate or CO through a facile liquid-phase method. Amalgams are mercury-based alloys and have been used for diverse modern applications, such as dentistry, jewellery production and mining.18–20 Ag and Hg have been reported for the CRR with completely different electronic structures and intrinsic CRR activities.12,21 Hg possesses extremely high overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excellent intrinsic selectivity (FE > 99%) for formate,21 while Ag is highly selective for CO evolution.12,22 It is hypothesized that switchable conversion of CO2 to formate or CO can be realized on Ag–Hg amalgams by tuning the Ag–Hg bonding sites. Furthermore, by smart design of nanostructures of catalysts, dramatically enlarged active surface area and mass transport can be achieved to enhance the selectivity and activity of CRR.23–26 To the best of our knowledge, nanostructured amalgams have been scarcely explored for efficient CRR thus far.
Experimental
Synthesis of np-Ag–Hg amalgams
The np-Ag–Hg amalgams were synthesized by a simple one-step wet-chemistry method. Take the preparation of Ag70Hg30 as an example. A 100 ml of aqueous solution containing 1.5 mmol of silver nitrate (AgNO3, Chem-Supply, >99.5%), 0.64 mmol of mercury(II) perchlorate hydrate (Hg(ClO4)2·xH2O, Sigma-Aldrich, >98%) and 3 mmol of sodium citrate (Chem-Supply, AR), was vigorously stirred under ambient conditions. Next, 3 mmol of sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma-Aldrich, >98%) dissolved in 10 ml of H2O (Milli-Q water, 18.2 MΩ cm) was rapidly poured into this mixture to initiate the reduction, immediately leading to a black suspension. After further stirring for 60 min, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with water three times. Procedures for the preparation of Ag100Hg0, Ag91Hg9, Ag83Hg17 and Ag60Hg40, were the same as those for Ag70Hg30, and the only difference was the molar ratio of Ag and Hg precursors (the amount of AgNO3 is kept as 1.5 mmol for the preparation of each sample).
Physical characterization
The morphology of np-Ag–Hg amalgams was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, QUANTA 450) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Themis-Z Double-corrected 60–300 kV S). The chemical compositions and element distributions were determined using the associated energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) detectors on the SEM and TEM. The final composition of amalgams was confirmed by an inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were also obtained to examine the crystalline nature of the np-Ag–Hg amalgams.
The crystalline structure was analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips 1130 X-ray diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation (45 kV, 40 mA, λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scan rate of 0.5° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on an ESCALAB250Xi spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, UK) with X-ray excitation provided by mono-chromated Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) at a high voltage of 13.8 kV and a power of 120 W. The XPS binding energy spectra were recorded at a pass-energy of 20 eV for region scans and 100 eV for survey scans. All the spectra were calibrated by C 1s a the binding energy of 284.8 eV.
Electrochemical measurements and product analysis
The catalyst inks were prepared by mixing 10 mg of np-Ag–Hg amalgams, 5 mg of Vulcan XC-72 carbon black (FuelCellStore), 0.9 ml of isopropanol/water (3:1 v/v) solution and 0.1 ml of Nafion perfluorinated resin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 5 wt%) under sonication for 1 h. An aliquot of the catalyst ink (30 μl) was uniformly pipetted onto a glassy carbon plate (1 cm × 0.5 cm, Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd.), and kept at room temperature to evaporate the solvent. The mass loading of catalyst is 0.6 mg cm−2.
All electrochemical experiments were carried out on an Autolab potentiostat (Multi Autolab M204) in a two-compartment gastight H-cell separated by a Nafion 115 membrane (FuelCellStore). Each compartment contained 30 ml of electrolyte with a headspace of about 15 ml. Pt foil (1 cm × 1 cm) and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, >99.7%) with a pH of 7.2 served as the electrolyte. All potentials were reported with respect to RHE using the equation E (V vs. RHE) = E (V vs. SCE) + 0.242 + 0.0591 × pH. The E (V vs. SCE) was corrected using the iR compensation function on the potentiostat with a compensation level of 85%.
Prior to CO2 reduction, CO2 (99.995%, Air Liquide) was purged into the cathodic electrolyte at a flow rate of 10.0 ml min−1 controlled by a mass flow controller (Cole-Parmer) for 30 min under a stirring rate of 200 rpm. During chronoamperometric electrolysis, CO2 was continuously bubbled into the cathodic compartment and vented directly into the gas sampling loop (1 ml) of a gas chromatograph (GC, SHIMADZU GC-2010PLUS) equipped with a packed MolSieve 5A column, a ShinCarbon ST Micropacked column and a packed PoraPLOT Q column. Ar was used as the carrier gas. The separated gases were analysed by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, for H2) and a flame ionization detector with a methanizer (FID, for CO). An external standard method was adopted to quantify the products. Four standard gas mixtures (Supagas Australia) composed of H2, CO, CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and N2 were used to obtain the calibration curve for each component. The calibration curves for H2 and CO are shown in Fig. S1a and b.† The electrolysis at each potential was performed for 4000 s and the GC detection was carried out every 27 min.
Liquid products were analysed on a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR, Bruker Avance III HD). A 0.5 ml of product-containing electrolyte was syringed out from the cathodic compartment after electrolysis. It was mixed with 0.1 ml of internal standard of diluted dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, >99.9%) and 0.1 ml of D2O (Cambridge Isotope Lab, 99.9%), and then transferred to an NMR sample tube. The 1D 1H spectra were measured with water suppression by excitation sculpting. The calibration curve of formate was made by using sodium formate (Sigma-Aldrich, >99.998%) with different concentrations together with the internal standard and D2O, as shown in Fig. S1c.†
The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of Ag100Hg0, Ag91Hg9 and Ag70Hg30 were determined by analysing the double layer capacitance of each electrode. Typically, the potential was swept between 0.627 and 0.727 V (vs. RHE) at different scan rates (10–200 mV s−1), where no faradaic process occurred. The capacitive currents were measured at 0.677 V, plotted as a function of scan rate, and then a linear fitting was used to determine the specific capacitance. The roughness factor (RF) of each electrode was obtained by dividing the electrode capacitance by 60 μF cm−2.27
Results and discussion
The np-Ag–Hg amalgam catalyst was synthesized by a facile one-step solution method, i.e., reducing Ag+ and Hg2+ with BH4− in the presence of a citrate stabilizer (Fig. 1a, see details in the Experimental section). According to the Ag–Hg phase diagram (Fig. S2†),28 Ag possesses excellent solubility towards Hg to be amalgamated as a Ag(Hg) solid solution phase or intermetallic compounds. The composition and structure of this Ag–Hg catalyst can be easily tuned by varying the ratio of Ag and Hg precursors. The amalgam catalysts were prepared accordingly, and denoted as Ag100Hg0, Ag91Hg9, Ag83Hg17, Ag70Hg30 and Ag60Hg40 based on the Ag/Hg precursor ratio. The corresponding atomic ratios of Ag and Hg in the as-prepared amalgams were determined to be close to the values obtained by EDX and ICP-MS analyses (Tables S1 and S2 and Fig. S3†), suggesting the tuneable composition of this type of Ag–Hg catalysts.

All the Ag–Hg amalgams display a nanoporous structure with an open bi-continuous interpenetrating nanorod-channel network as revealed by SEM analysis (Fig. S4†). The diameter of the interconnected nanorods decreases with the increase of Hg content in the amalgams. Among these, Ag70Hg30 shows the finest network structure with an average nanorod-diameter of 37 nm. TEM analysis (Fig. 1b) further reveals the particular morphology of the nanorods. It indicates that the nanorods are formed by spontaneous fast assembly of the as-formed nanoparticles during the reaction process. In the HRTEM image (Fig. 1c), two distinct lattice fringes were detected, which can be assigned to the (111) plane of Ag(Hg) solid solution phase and the (100) facet of Ag1.1Hg0.9, respectively. This was verified by SAED analysis. The bright diffraction dots are well indexed to the above two crystalline phases, while the blurred diffraction rings indicate the polycrystalline nature of this np-Ag–Hg amalgam (Fig. 1d). In addition, SEM and TEM element mapping results demonstrate the homogeneous distribution of Ag and Hg atoms across the nanoporous rod-like structures at the microscale and nanoscale (Fig. 1e and S5†).
The microstructures of the as-synthesized samples were further determined by XRD analysis. With the increase of Hg amount in np-Ag–Hg amalgams, the diffraction peaks of Ag (JCPDS no. 01-087-0719) gradually shift to lower 2θ angles, highlighting the formation of the Ag(Hg) solid solution phase as well as the increasing amount of solid solution Hg atoms in metallic Ag lattice (Fig. 2a–c and S6†). New shoulder peaks for Ag70Hg30 emerge at 33.9° and 40.0°, which can be ascribed to the (100) and (002) diffractions of the intermetallic Ag1.1Hg0.9 phase (JCPDS no. 00-027-0618). This is consistent with the HRTEM and SAED results. To demonstrate the accurate crystal structures and phase fractions of np-Ag–Hg amalgams, XRD refinements were performed and shown in Fig. 2a–f, S6 and Table S3.† The Ag(Hg) solid solution phase is the dominant content in these amalgams, and the fraction of the intermetallic Ag1.1Hg0.9 phase gradually increases with the increasing Hg content (Table S3†). Typically, the Ag91Hg9 alloy has a similar face-centre-cubic structure to Ag100Hg0 yet with a slightly larger lattice parameter (4.08867 Å) due to the insertion of Hg atoms in the Ag lattice (Table S3†). The Ag70Hg30 alloy contains 81.9% of the Ag(Hg) solid solution phase with a further increased lattice parameter (4.157 Å) and 18.1% of the intermetallic Ag1.1Hg0.9 compound (Table S3†). Numerous interfaces should be formed between these two phases, which may facilitate CO2 electroreduction due to their unique electronic structures and binding abilities.29,30

XPS analysis was performed to determine the bonding characteristics of np-Ag–Hg amalgams (Fig. 2g, h, S7 and S8†). Take the Ag70Hg30 as an example. The peaks at 375.0 and 369.0 eV are ascribed to Ag0+ 3d3/2 and Ag0+ 3d5/2, respectively, with a spin–orbit splitting of ΔEp(3d5/2 − 3d7/2) = 6.0 eV (Fig. 2g).31 The peaks of Hg0+ 4f5/2 and Hg0+ 4f7/2 orbitals are observed at 104.9 and 100.8 eV, respectively (Fig. 2h). The weak peaks at 105.8 and 101.7 eV can be ascribed to HgO formed by spontaneous oxidation of Hg in air.32 With the increase of Hg fraction in np-Ag–Hg amalgams, the peaks of Ag 3d3/2 and Ag 3d5/2 gradually shift to higher binding energies, indicating that Ag donates electrons to Hg (Fig. S8a†). Accordingly, the peaks of Hg 4f5/2 and Hg 4f7/2 slightly shift to lower binding energies with the increasing Ag content (Fig. S8b†). This result confirms the formation of Ag–Hg bonds and the modified electronic structures in the amalgams.
The catalytic performance of np-Ag–Hg amalgams for CO2 electroreduction was first evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (Fig. 3a and S9†). The LSV curves of the Ag70Hg30 catalyst in Ar and CO2 environments show similar current trends in the applied potential range. However, a much higher current density is obtained in a CO2 environment at more negative potentials than −0.7 V (vs. RHE) than in an Ar environment (Fig. 3a). This implies that this catalyst may have high electrocatalytic activity towards the CRR. With the increase of the Hg content in the amalgams, the total current density increases gradually and reaches a maximum value on Ag83Hg17 and Ag70Hg30, and then decreases for Ag60Hg40. This may be attributed to the morphology evolution and exposed Ag–Hg bonding sites associated with the Hg amount in the amalgams (Fig. S9†).

(e) Durability performance of the Ag70Hg30 catalyst at −0.9 V vs. RHE for 40 h. 
To clarify the catalytic performance of Ag–Hg amalgams, chronoamperometric electrolysis and quantitative analysis of products were carried out for all the five samples, Ag100Hg0, Ag91Hg9, Ag83Hg17, Ag70Hg30 and Ag60Hg40 (Fig. S10–S13†). Three products were detected including H2, CO and formate. CO is the dominant product for Ag100Hg0 and Ag91Hg9, and formate for the other three catalysts (Fig. S11†). The competing HER is found to be highly suppressed for all catalysts (Fig. S13†). Fig. 3b highlights their FE for formate production (FEformate) at a potential of −0.9 V (all the potentials are referenced to the RHE herein), where the FEformate dramatically increases with the increasing Hg content. This indicates that the selectivity for formate formation is easily tuned by introducing Ag–Hg bonding sites. Fig. 3c shows the potential-dependent FEformate for Ag91Hg9 and Ag70Hg30. Both of them show an increasing trend with overpotential. However, the Ag70Hg30 exhibits much higher FEformate values than Ag91Hg9. At −0.7 V, Ag70Hg30 drives the CO2-to-formate conversion with a FE of 73%, which is over two times higher than that of Ag91Hg9 (31%). At a more negative potential of −0.9 V, the FEformate reaches a higher value of 85% (Fig. 3c). Moreover, Ag70Hg30 shows superior partial current densities for formate production (jformate) compared with Ag91Hg9 (Fig. 3d). At −0.9 V, it can reach 5.1 mA cm−2, more than a one-fold increase relative to that (2.1 mA cm−2) of Ag91Hg9 (Fig. 3d). In addition, the Ag70Hg30 catalyst exhibits an excellent stability for CO2-to-formate conversion (Fig. 3e). The current density remains stable during 40 h of electrolysis with a negligible degradation of FECO+H2. The FEformate measured at the end of electrolysis (80%) is similar to that obtained in the first 1.5 h (83%). Structural analysis after electrolysis revealed that the nanoporous network structure and element distribution of the amalgam were well preserved (Fig. S14 and S15†), indicating its excellent structural robustness. ICP-MS analysis of the electrolyte after electrolysis demonstrated negligible dissolved Hg2+, further confirming the stability of amalgams (Fig. S16†).
Interestingly, the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of np-Ag–Hg amalgams for the CRR can be tuned by tailoring Ag–Hg bonding sites. Ag83Hg17, Ag70Hg30 and Ag60Hg40 preferably reduce CO2 to formate, while Ag91Hg9 is favourable for CO formation (Fig. S11†). Typically, Ag91Hg9 shows a FECO of 58% at −0.7 V, which is 4-fold higher than the 11% of Ag70Hg30 (Fig. 4a). The reactivity, i.e., CO partial current density (jCO), of Ag91Hg9 is higher than that of Ag70Hg30 as well, revealing its good catalytic activity for CO evolution. Moreover, this catalyst exhibits an excellent stability for CO formation. In 15 h of electrolysis at −0.7 V, the current density is maintained around −0.6 mA cm−2, and the FECO fluctuates slightly around 55% (Fig. 4c). The LSV curves before and after electrolysis are overlapped well, further indicating a robust durability of Ag91Hg9 for CRR (Fig. 4d).

To understand the origin of the tuneable selectivity, we then identified the electrochemical active sites for the CRR by correlating the structure properties/compositions of the catalysts with product selectivity. Specifically, CO is the major CRR product at −0.9 V (FECO ∼ 90%) on the Ag100Hg0 electrode, and the FECO decreases to 47% for Ag91Hg9 and 9% for Ag70Hg30 (Fig. S11†). This suggests that CO formation originates from Ag–Ag bonds rather than Ag–Hg bonding sites. On the other hand, no formate is formed over Ag100Hg0, but the FEformate increases significantly with the presence of Hg from 44% for Ag91Hg9 to 85% for Ag70Hg30 at −0.9 V (Fig. 3b). This indicates that Ag–Hg bonds are the primary active sites for the CRR to formate. According to previous reports, Ag can dominantly reduce CO2 to CO due to its moderate Ag–C bonding strength with CO2 to form *COOH (* indicates active sites) intermediate, and formate is selectively formed through HCOO* intermediate on Hg with a weak Hg–C bond.6,33,34 When Ag is amalgamized with Hg, the binding ability to CO2 on the introduced Ag–Hg sites would be suppressed, leading to weaker metal-C bonding interactions, thus promoting the formation of HCOO* intermediate for formate production.34 Notably, the Ag60Hg40 catalyst shows decreased formate selectivity and activity compared to the optimal Ag70Hg30, which is attributed to the coarsened nanorod structures and less exposed Ag–Hg sites (Fig. 3b, S5 and S11†).
Table S4† compares the performance of various electrocatalysts for switchable CO2 reduction to formate or CO. The np-Ag–Hg amalgam is superior to state-of-the-art materials in the literature.15,16,35–39 The excellent activity and efficiency of the np-Ag–Hg amalgam can be attributed to the remarkable structural properties. Firstly, np-Ag–Hg amalgams afford nanoporous structures with an open bi-continuous interpenetrating nanorod-channel network, offering enlarged electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs, Fig. S17†) and more exposed active facets compared to bulk amalgams. This benefits the mass transfer of reactants and products, and thus improves the selectivity and activity of CRR.40,41 Secondly, alloying Ag with Hg can tune the electronic structure for facile charge transport properties. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) show that the np-Ag–Hg amalgam has a smaller charge transfer resistance than its pure Ag counterpart (Fig. S18†), ascribed to optimal charge transport interfaces introduced between the Ag(Hg) solid solution phase and intermetallic Ag1.1Hg0.9 compound for formate formation (Fig. 3b and Table S3†). Finally, we find that the selectivity to formate increases with enlarging the lattice parameter of the Ag(Hg) solid solution phase. This suggests that the induced strain by the solid solution Hg atoms in the Ag lattice favours formate generation. Such induced strain has been reported for other gas-involved electrochemical reactions like oxygen reduction, formic acid oxidation, aerobic oxidation and CO2 reduction (Fig. 3b and Table S3†).42–45
Conclusions
In summary, a nanoporous Ag–Hg amalgam has been developed by a facile chemical reduction method. By tuning the Ag–Hg bonding sites, the np-Ag–Hg amalgam exhibits high selectivity toward formate or CO in aqueous solution. The outstanding selectivity for formate can be attributed to the moderate binding energy of HCOO* on Ag–Hg sites, while the production of CO over nanoporous Ag91Hg9 arises from the intrinsically high selectivity of Ag–Ag bonds. The electrocatalytic performance of the np-Ag–Hg amalgam can be further improved by using three-dimensional conductive foam as the substrate or constructing gas diffusion electrodes in a flow cell. This work opens up enormous opportunities of using low-dimensional amalgams to control the product selectivity for CO2 electroreduction on demand.
