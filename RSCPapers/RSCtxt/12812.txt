    , Accepted 8th August 2017First published on 8th August 2017AbstractUnder the guidance of our theoretical calculations, we synthesized a lead-free double perovskite ((CH3NH3)2AgBiI6) and explored its electronic structure and optical properties using a combination of experiment and density functional theory. (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 has an indirect bandgap of 1.96 eV, and exhibits high-stability in air.
In recent years, methyl ammonium lead halide perovskites have been new favorites in the photovoltaic field, in view of their high absorption coefficients,1,2 long charge carrier diffusion lengths,3,4 and simple manufacturing processes.5 Since the initial devices were fabricated in 2009 by Miyasaka with an efficiency of 3.8%,6 the power conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells have been improved to 22.1% in such a short period of time.7 Despite the extremely outstanding photovoltaic performance, the heavy metal lead in these materials is toxic to organisms and the environment,8 impeding their commercialization in the future. Accordingly, the search for less toxic metals to replace lead is critical. As elements similar to Pb in group IVA, Sn and Ge have been reported for developing lead-free perovskites, but the problem is their inferior stability in air.9–12 Bismuth-based halide perovskites, which are much more stable,13,14 have been assembled in solar cells, and a power conversion efficiency of over 1% has been achieved by Cs3Bi2I9.15 Similar to bismuth, an antimony-based perovskite, Cs3Sb2I9, has also been investigated by Mitzi et al.16
However, the fact is that there are only a few bivalent or trivalent cations alternative to substitute Pb2+ to form non-toxic and stable perovskites. Hence, another viable route is to explore a double perovskite structure with the combination of monovalent and trivalent cations.17 For example, Cs2AgBiBr6, as a double perovskite with a long carrier lifetime, was first synthesized by Karunadasa et al.18 Almost simultaneously, Woodward et al. reported Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites with a cubic structure.17 In addition, Volonakis et al. reported a series of double perovskites with the general formula A2B1B2X6, where B1 = Cu, Ag, and Au and B2 = Bi and Sb from computational screening.19 Recently, Cheetham et al. demonstrated that (CH3NH3)2AgBiBr6 has a band gap of 2.02 eV and is rather stable.20 However, as an analogue to it, (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 has rarely been mentioned and investigated so far.
Herein we adopted first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to demonstrate the feasibility of replacing Pb2+ with the combination of Ag+ and Bi3+ to form the (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 perovskite. Theoretical calculations show that this halide double perovskite has a suitable band gap and good electron transport properties, indicating that it is a potential material for photovoltaic applications. Subsequently, we reported the synthesis and characterization of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 to investigate its structural and optical properties. The results show that (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 is very stable in air, with an indirect band gap of 1.96 eV, suitable for a tandem solar cell.
Motivated by the idea of replacing lead with the combination of Bi and Ag in the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, we studied the (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 perovskite through theoretical calculations. To obtain a qualitative understanding of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6, its crystallographic stability and probable structure can be inferred by considering two representative parameters, which are the tolerance factor t and the octahedral factor μ.21 For an ABX3 perovskite structure, the tolerance factor t can be described by the distance ratio of A–X to B–X and defined as follows:22,23 (1)where rA, rB and rX are the radii of the corresponding ions. Besides, the octahedral factor μ can be defined by the atomic radius ratio of B to X, which is rB/rX. In general, for halide perovskites, t and μ range from 0.81 to 1.11 and 0.44 to 0.90, respectively.21 For our system in this work, the larger cation A is CH3NH3+ with rA = 0.18 nm. The halide anion X is I− with rX = 0.22 nm.24 The radius of B (rB) is 0.109 nm, obtained by averaging the atomic radii of Ag+ (rB1 = 0.115 nm) and Bi3+ (rB2 = 0.103 nm).25 Thus, the t and μ values are equal to 0.86 and 0.50, respectively, which are both in the range of halide perovskites and close to the corresponding values of CH3NH3PbI3 (t = 0.83, μ = 0.54).
The fully optimized structure of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 is shown in Fig. 1. The optimized structure is in the orthogonal phase with the lattice parameters a = 8.72 Å, b = 8.70 Å, and c = 12.55 Å. In the (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 system, each Bi and Ag atom coordinates with six I atoms, constructing octahedral cages with CH3NH3+ filling them. The CH3NH3+ cations are oriented along the [110], [10], [0] and [10] directions with respect to the ab-plane of the lattice, respectively. The Ag–I bond lengths in the equatorial and apical directions are in the ranges of 2.99–3.13 Å and 3.07–3.18 Å, while the Bi–I bond lengths in both directions are in the ranges of 3.03–3.27 Å and 3.11–3.16 Å, respectively. Their bond lengths are very close to the experimental data of the average Pb–I bond length (3.16 Å), which may result from their similar effective cation radii.

Since the electronic structure is very important for determining lots of physical properties such as light absorption and charge transport, we calculated the band structure of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 with the PBE functional as shown in Fig. 2a. The calculated indirect band gap of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 is 1.02 eV with the valence band maximum (VBM) located at the M point, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) located at the K point. From the band dispersion around these two points, we also calculated the effective mass of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 based on the PBE electronic structure. The electron effective mass (me*) along K–N and hole effective mass (mh*) along M–X are calculated to be 0.47m0 (m0 is the electron static mass) and 0.70m0, respectively, indicating that the electron transport performance is better than the hole transport performance. The me* is only a little larger than the corresponding effective mass in CH3NH3PbI3, which also indicates that (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 exhibits good electron transport properties. Due to the significant effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) on the calculations of band structures and effective masses for MAPbI3,26,27 the band structure of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 in consideration of SOC interaction is also calculated as shown in Fig. 2a. We find that the band gap of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 will decrease from 1.02 eV to 0.76 eV, while the electron effective mass (me*) along K–N and hole effective mass (mh*) along M–X will increase to 0.63m0 (m0 is the electron static mass) and 1.08m0, respectively, when the SOC interaction is considered in band structure calculations. Though both values of effective masses are larger than the result without SOC, the better electron transport performance of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 still agrees with previous results. Apart from that, the density of states (DOS) was also calculated for considering the orbital contribution from different atoms (Fig. 2b). It should be noted that the energy level around the Fermi level is mainly composed of Ag4d, I5p and Bi6p orbitals. Among them, the I5p orbital has a significant contribution to the valence band, while the contribution of the Bi6p orbital is very little. In contrast, the conduction band mainly contains I5p and Bi6p orbitals, and the Ag4d orbital contributes little to the conduction band.

As the actual band gap is usually underestimated using standard DFT calculations,28 herein, we use the GLLB-SC model potential method implemented in GPAW code29,30 to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the band gap. The excess derivative discontinuity (Δxc) is added to the Kohn–Sham band gap to obtain the quasi-particle band gap and this method was previously proved to be effective for predicting hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites with a mean absolute error of only 0.2 eV compared with experiments.31 The quasi-particle band gap calculated using this method is 1.89 eV, which is 0.87 eV larger than the PBE result. Besides, due to the seriously relativistic effects in heavy metal atom Bi, spin–orbit coupling (SOC) calculations are also additionally considered in our calculation. As a result, the obtained band gap of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 will become 1.63 eV. According to the Shockley–Queisser limit theory,32 a material with this band gap will have a very good solar absorption and conversion capability. Based on this theoretical band gap and the discussion on the effective mass of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6, we consider that this compound may be a potential material for solar cells.
Experimentally, we synthesized (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 powder through solid-state reaction and investigated its absorbing and structural properties. An absorption spectrum (Fig. 3a) measured from 200 to 900 nm shows that (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 exhibits excellent absorbing performance below 600 nm. The Tauc plot in Fig. 3b reveals an indirect band gap of 1.96 eV, which is slightly larger than the calculated result (1.63 eV). Compared with the traditional CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite with a band gap of 1.55 eV, (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 exhibits better potential for tandem solar cell applications.33 The experimental PXRD data could be reproduced by Rietveld refined powder XRD patterns without modifying the crystal lattice and atoms' positions of the proposed structure. The tiny difference between experimental and simulated PXRD demonstrated that our proposed crystal structure is reliable (Fig. 4).

A (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 thin film was prepared on an FTO/TiO2 substrate using a consecutive two-step spin-coating method and the process involved deposition of the precursor solution and subsequent drop-casting of chlorobenzene.34 The resultant perovskite film was jacinth and subjected to annealing at 100 °C for 1 h to dislodge any residual solvent and promote crystallization of the film. As shown in Fig. 4, the XRD patterns of the thin film match well with that of the powder, without secondary phases. Fig. 5 shows a typical surface SEM image of the (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 film, which is comprised of numerous flake-like crystals. The plane size of the crystal is up to several micrometers, while the thickness is around 500 nm.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to investigate the chemical composition and valence band spectra of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 (Fig. S1, ESI†), and the overview spectrum is presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The estimated Bi/Ag ratio is 1.07, which is in good agreement with the stoichiometry, confirming that this material contains the same amount of Bi and Ag. The energy band diagram for (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6, obtained by combining the valence band spectra and work function, is presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As we can see, the conduction band energy level of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 is lower than that of TiO2, implying that electron transfer from the perovskite to TiO2 is inhibited. In addition, we investigated other electron transport materials used in PSCs including SnO2, ZnO, C60 and PCBM. We found that the conduction band energy levels of SnO2 (−4.5 eV) and C60 (−4.5 eV) are lower than that of MA2AgBiI6 (−4.32 eV),35 implying that SnO2 and C60 may also be good electron transport materials for MA2AgBiI6 based solar cells.
Finally, the stability of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 was studied by measuring the decomposition temperature and recording the change in the XRD patterns over time. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the perovskite shows an initial mass loss at 332 °C (Fig. S4, ESI†), which is significantly higher than the standard testing temperature of solar cells (85 °C).36 PXRD patterns of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 after four months' storage (in the dark and in air (humidity is close to 10%)) show no evidence of decomposition (Fig. 6), indicating that the material is rather stable.

It is worth noting that we previously reported a lead-free double perovskite (CH3NH3)2AgSbI6.37 The band gap of (CH3NH3)2AgSbI6 is similar to that of (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6, and both of them can be used as potential photovoltaic materials. Though Sb and Bi are in the same group in the periodic table of the elements, there are still some differences between (CH3NH3)2AgSbI6 and (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6. Compared with Bi atom, Sb atom has a smaller mass and ion radius, the smaller ion radius of Sb leads to structural distortion of MA2AgSbI6, while the structure of MA2AgBiI6 is the orthogonal phase. Besides, due to the seriously relativistic effects in heavy metal atom Bi, the impact of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) on the band gap of MA2AgBiI6 is more pronounced.
In summary, combining theoretical and experimental studies, we investigated the electronic structure and optical properties of the (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 perovskite. Theoretical calculations show that (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 has a suitable band gap and exhibits good electron transport performance, and therefore can be used as a photovoltaic material. Its absorption characteristics and XRD patterns confirmed our theoretical predictions. With an indirect band gap of 1.96 eV, (CH3NH3)2AgBiI6 exhibits high-stability in air and is suitable for tandem solar cells.
