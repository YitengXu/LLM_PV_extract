    , Accepted 6th December 2018First published on 13th December 2018AbstractWater-soluble NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 micron particles were prepared directly by the hydrothermal method. The growth mechanism and upconversion fluorescence emission property of the particles at different shell thicknesses were studied. The results showed that the fluorescence emission intensity of the core–shell particles increased by about ten times compared with that of bare core particles. The emission intensity increased with increase in the reaction time during particle preparation, which is due to dissolution of excess citrate from the surface of the particles. The problem of obtaining hydrophilic NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 applied as biological MR imaging contrast agents and for UCL imaging was addressed during the preparation of the sample. Therefore, the method of preparation of the sample used in this study has important significance for applying inorganic UCNPs to the biological field.
1. Introduction
Rare earth-doped up-conversion (UC) materials have been used in many fields such as photodynamic therapy,1,2 biological labeling,3,4 solar cells, volumetric displays5 and biological imaging6–9 because of their low phonon energy, high transmittance and good chemical and thermal stabilities. Compared with cubic phase, the hexagonal phase NaREF4 has lower phonon energy of about 350 cm−1, which can effectively reduce non-radiative decay probability, prolong the lifetime of the metastable state of optically active ions and improve the up-conversion luminescence.10 However, the applications are still limited due to the low fluorescence efficiency of UC submicroparticles.11 There are many strategies for improving the luminescence efficiency and detection sensitivity, which include introduction of metallic nanoparticles, surface coating,12 and construction of core–shell structures.13–16 Applications in the biological field usually require low toxicity, hydrophilicity, and high fluorescence efficiency. Recently, several protocols have been reported with core/shell structure UCNPs such as NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 active core/inert shell17 and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4:Tm3+ core–shell structures for bioimaging.18,19 However, the particles synthesized by thermal decomposition and solvothermal method have some oleic acid groups and cytotoxins,20 which are not suitable for biological applications. Therefore, further surface treatment is needed to obtain hydrophilic particles and improve the application to biological imaging.
In the study reported by Gabriella et al., β-NaREF4:Eu3+ was synthesized by the solvothermal method (glycol as co-solvent) at room temperature.20 The discussions and comparisons of each study for the surface modification of UCNPs used in the biological field are listed in Table 1. Although PAA-NRs and UCCS@SiO2 listed in Table 1 are productive, further surface modification treatment is needed. To further improve the hydrophilicity and fluorescence efficiency of the particles, we have developed a facile and productive hydrothermal method to synthesize low-toxicity, hydrophilic and magnetic β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 core–shell structures with different shell thicknesses. Compared with the observation for β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ particles, UC luminescence of single β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 particles is enhanced. The growth mechanism of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 crystal particles and their application in UCL imaging and MRI are also discussed.

2. Experimental
2.1 Sample preparation
β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ particles are synthesized by the classical hydrothermal method. Specifically, trisodium citrate is used as the chelating agent and deionized water is used as solvent; NaF is used as the fluorine source. The method for synthesizing the core–shell structure is similar to that of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ particles. The thickness of the shell is controlled by adjusting the amount of precursor required for the NaGdF4 shell. In the discussion of this study, we use NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (0.20), (0.25), (0.33), (0.50) and (1.00) to indicate the molar amounts of NaGdF4 reaction precursor, which are 0.20, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50 and 1.00 times, respectively, of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ particles. The details of the sample synthesis are provided in the ESI.†
2.2 Characterization
The crystal structures of the particles were characterized by XRD spectra obtained using a D/Max2550VB/PC diffractometer with Cu Kα (35 kV, 20 mA) irradiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The 2θ angles of the XRD spectra are from 10° to 80° and recorded at the scanning rate of 9° min−1.13 The morphology and dispersion of the samples were observed by SEM (Nova NanoSEM450) and field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai G2 F20). The upconversion luminescence emission spectra of single micro-particles were investigated with excitation at 980 nm using a laser. The signal detection system includes a spectrometer (ACTON, SP 2750i) with spectral resolution of 0.008 nm, charge coupled device (CCD, ACTON, PIXIS 100) and photomultiplier (PMT, ACTON, PD471). The measurement of luminescence emission from single micro-particle was conducted by employing a confocal microscopy system with an optic microscope (OLYMPUS-B×100).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology
As shown in Fig. 1, the overall procedure for the growth of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (0.33) and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (1.00) samples at different reaction times is exhibited.24 In the early stage of nuclear formation, NaYF4 exhibited cubic phase and then changed from cubic-phase NaYF4 to hexagonal-phase NaYF4. The growth of the shell was similar to the epitaxial growth. When a certain amount of shell precursor was added, it was found that spherical particles were formed on the β-NaYF4 surface only half an hour later. With increase in the reaction time, more β-NaGdF4 particles were formed at the shell from the shell precursor and then saturation was observed.25 After further increasing the reaction temperature or time, we still observed small β-NaGdF4 particles among the core–shell sample.
 Fig. 1  Illustration of the growth process for NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (0.33) and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (1.00) core–shell particles. 
The SEM images of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ core and NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (0.50) core–shell are shown in Fig. 2(A-a) and (b). The thickness of the shell is about 0.14 μm (Fig. S2, ESI†). The TEM and HRTEM pictures of the sample NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (0.50) are shown in Fig. 2(A-c) and (d); the distance between lattice fringes is about 0.32 nm, which corresponds to the (110) plane of β-NaGdF4. The corresponding elemental mapping (Fig. 2(B)) and EDS spectrum (Fig. 2(C)) further support the formation of the β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 core–shell structure. The SEM images of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (0.20), (0.25), (0.33), (0.50) and (1.00) samples are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It can be seen that the synthesized core–shell structure is a hexagonal disk. When the amount of shell precursor increases, more β-NaGdF4 species appear. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows that with an increase in the molar amount of NaGdF4 shell precursor, the size of the core–shell crystal particles also increases. When the molar amount of the precursor increases to a certain value for forming the NaGdF4 shell of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (0.50) core–shell particles, the increase is shell thickness is not significant, which verifies that the saturation of the reaction is reached at this point. Therefore, there is a critical molar amount of the shell precursor. When the amount of shell precursor is over this critical value, the growth of NaGdF4 shell will reach saturation.

During sample preparation, we found that irrespective of reduction in the amount of nuclear (NaYF4) precursor and increase in the reaction time or reaction temperature, randomly distributed small β-NaGdF4 particles formed during the formation of the core–shell structure could not be eliminated. Also, it is not easy to form a hexagonal disk with uniform morphology. Samples with various reaction conditions are characterized and shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
The crystal structure of the sample is characterized by XRD. The standard hexagonal phase is compared with the standard card, as shown in Fig. 3. In the XRD spectra, a clear diffraction peak at the (201) plane corresponds to the β-NaGdF4 plane; it is clear that the intensity of the diffraction peak near the (201) plane increases with increase in the NaGdF4 precursor, which suggests that the NaGdF4 shell is formed in the structure. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the existence of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 core–shell structure was determined by detecting the fluorescence emission of different lanthanide ions doped in UCNPs. Fluorescence emission spectra of a single NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4:Yb3+/Tm3+ particle and the core NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ particle were investigated under IR excitation at 980 nm, and they are shown in Fig. S4(a) and (b) (ESI†), respectively. For β-NaYF4 and β-NaGdF4 particles, we found that both have similar crystal structures, as seen in Fig. 3. The intensity of the (101) lattice plane is greater than that of the (110) plane. After NaGdF4 is coated on β-NaYF4 as a shell, the result of XRD shows that the peak intensity of the (110) plane is higher than that of the (101) plane, which indicates that the core–shell structure of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 prefers to grow in the (110) direction.

3.2 UC luminescence emission of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 single particle
Luminescence emissions from single core–shell β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 particle with different shell thicknesses have been investigated under IR excitation at 980 nm, and the spectra are shown in Fig. 4(a). The main emissions from Er3+ ions are located at 523 nm, 537 nm, and 654 nm, corresponding to the transitions of 2H11/2–4I15/2,4S3/2–4I15/2 and 4F9/2–4I15/2 (Fig. 4(b)). Compared with the observation for core particles of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, the overall emission intensity of the single core–shell particle increases by about 10 times. It has been reported that the thickness of the shell affects the life time of the luminescence emission, and the emission intensity increases with shell thickness.16,26,27 Based on our experimental results from the β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 core–shell particles, we observed intensity increase in the luminescence emission compared with that observed for β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ core particles, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Generally, the fluorescence emission intensity of lanthanide ion-doped UCNPs increases by about several hundred times after coating shells with size of several nanometers, as reported in the literature. However, from the experiment and the integral calculated for the fluorescence emission peak, it can be seen that the maximum fluorescence emission of the core–shell structure can be increased 10 times compared with that for the core in this study. Our experimental results seem to be unsatisfactory, and the possible reasons are as follows: (a) the coated NaGdF4 inert shell has higher phonon energy, which is not conducive to UC fluorescence emission.28,29 (b) The electron population of the lanthanide ion (Er3+) excited state level can be saturated with high power density of the excitation light. In this case, the fluorescence emission enhancement phenomenon of the core–shell structure is not obvious.30

The power density is 3 × 104 W cm−2. (b) The corresponding energy levels and possible transition of Yb3+ and Er3+ doped in the core domain. 
Generally speaking, when the excitation power is low, the relation between the excitation power and the UC fluorescence intensity can be abbreviated to IUC ∝ Pn, where n represents the number of infrared pump photons that need to be absorbed during the generation of fluorescence emission.31,32 Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the log–log plot of the selected UC emission peak intensity of single NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 as a function of the pump power. The slopes of these lines are around 1.7, which proves that the red and green emissions are from two-photon excitation processes.
3.3 Magnetic resonance imaging of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 crystal particles
Fluorescent particles are usually applied to biological systems and should have low toxicity, hydrophilicity and high fluorescence efficiency. The particles synthesized by thermal decomposition and solvothermal methods usually have oleic acid groups and cytotoxins on them.20 Therefore, surface treatment is required before applying them to biological imaging. In the current study, the core–shell particles prepared by the hydrothermal method already have water solubility; therefore, no further hydrophilic treatment is needed. Fig. 5(a) shows the prepared solution of core–shell particles (100 μg mL−1) dissolved in water, DMEM, FBS and phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). It is found that the core–shell particles stay dispersed evenly for all of the solutions more than half hour later, which further proves that the synthesized core–shell particles have better biological stability and compatibility.27,33 From the above analysis, it can be concluded that the core–shell particles can be well applied to cell-like substances and further applications in vivo can also be achieved.

(b) The relationship between Gd3+ concentration and T1-weighted MR image relaxation rate (1/T1) from NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 particles dispersed in water. 
To show the potential of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 particles for MRI application, we applied the particles for in vitro relaxivity measurements and T1-weighted MRI.34 Nuclear magnetic field equipment for in vitro measurement (NMI20-015V-I) of contrast agents was used with 0.5 T magnetic field employing pure water as a control at room temperature. The NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 aqueous dilution was scattered in a series of test tubes for T1-weighted MRI. The corresponding parameters of the instrument are as follows: control cabinet is 560 mm × 655 mm × 700 mm; magnet cabinet is 560 mm × 600 mm × 385 mm and the voltage is 220 V with 50 Hz. A plot of relaxation rates (1/T1) versus Gd3+ concentration gives a straight line with a slope of r1 that is shown in Fig. 5(b). The r1 value is about 3.81 mM−1 S−1 and R2 is 0.99. The inset of Fig. 5(b) shows T1-weighted MRI of core–shell particles dispersed in water. The NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (0.50) solution concentrations chosen were 0.5 (mg mL−1), 1 (mg mL−1), 2 (mg mL−1), 4 (mg mL−1), 6 (mg mL−1) and 10 (mg mL−1).
3.4 
          In vivo UCL imaging
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Shaanxi Normal University. BALB/c mice (female, 7 weeks old) were purchased from SPF (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. To examine the potential application of the prepared luminescent core–shell particles, an in vivo UCL imaging test was conducted. The nude mouse used in the experiment was BALB/c with body weight of 18.5 g. The aqueous solution of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 (100 μL, 2 mg mL−1) was injected intravenously into the back of mice after ultrasonic shock treatment on the solution. During the experiment, both the laser spot and the mouse were fixed. The excitation light (IR laser) was 980 nm. Fig. 6 shows the position change of the particles inside the mouse half an hour after intravenous injection with the solution of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4. The images shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b) were taken in the bright field and dark field environments, respectively. The fluorescence emission of the particle at different positions inside the mice is clearly exhibited. Regarding the experimental study on excretion of UCNPs in animals, it has been reported that inorganic UCNPs are mainly concentrated in the reticuloendothelial system (RES) such as liver and spleen after injection in vivo about 1 hour and are basically excreted in the form of feces;21,35 however, the specific digestion and metabolism process is still unknown. This preliminary application test proves the significance of the core–shell sample for bioimaging technology.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully obtained water-soluble NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 core–shell particles with high crystallinity and uniform morphology through the hydrothermal method. The growth mechanism of the shell and the upconversion fluorescence emission property of the single particles at different shell thicknesses were studied. The results showed that the fluorescence emission intensity of the core–shell particles increases by about 10 times compared with that from the bare core particles. It was found that the enhancement effect is related to the shell formation. Thus, the hydrophilic NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaGdF4 particles used as biological MR imaging contrast agents and for UCL imaging were synthesized directly without any surface modification, which is very advantageous for extending their applications in the field of biology.
