    , Accepted 27th October 2014First published on 10th November 2014AbstractA series of novel soluble [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives bearing relatively simple substituents like [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) is synthesized under Prato reaction conditions. The photoabsorption and electrochemical properties of the fulleropyrrolidines are investigated to elucidate their molecular-level electronic properties similar to those of PC61BM. The investigations of the fulleropyrrolidines as electron acceptors based on bulk-heterojunction type organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices fabricated using P3HT as a donor show clear differences in performance depending on the substituents, and the devices based on the N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives exhibit good power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) comparable to, or even higher than, that of the standard PC61BM-based device. Finally, the OPV devices based on a low-bandgap donor polymer (PTB7) with the N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidines show high PCEs up to 7.3%, which is the highest class performance among [60]fullerene-based OPV devices, indicating that N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives are a promising alternative to PC61BM for OPV acceptor materials.
Introduction
Tremendous efforts have been devoted to achieving high efficiencies in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells consisting of organic electron-donor and electron-acceptor materials.1 OPV cells have several advantages over silicon solar cells, such as solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and potential low-cost large module fabrication,1,2 even though OPV cells exhibit still lower power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than silicon solar cells. A soluble buckminsterfullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), has been most widely used as a standard electron-acceptor material for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) type OPV cells.1–3 The PCEs of the BHJ solar cells based on a blend of PC61BM with regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a typical donor polymer material, have now reached as high as 6%.3,4 Furthermore, a rapid increase in the PCEs has been recently caused by the development of a wide variety of new donor polymers having a narrow optical band gap and a low-lying energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which contribute to utilizing a broader range of solar light and gaining a higher open-circuit voltage, respectively.1,5 On the other hand, most of the reported high-performance BHJ solar cells have been fabricated using PC61BM or its C70 analog, PC71BM, as the acceptor material, since they were used in the first reports.6,7 This narrow structural diversity in the acceptor materials leads to insufficient fundamental understanding of OPVs, limiting further performance improvement, and reduction in practical production costs.8 Thus new alternative electron acceptors suitable for BHJ-type OPVs have been keenly sought in fullerene derivatives as well as non-fullerene materials.
Several PC61BM-analogous methano[60]fullerenes with modified solubility in processing solvents, modified affinity with donor polymers, and regulated energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were synthesized via replacement of the phenyl group with other aromatic derivatives, replacement of the methyl ester group with several longer- or branched-alkyl ester groups, replacement of the bridged carbon atom with heteroatoms, or bis- and multi-addition of the methylene bridge, and were tested for applicability to BHJ-type OPVs.9–15 In contrast, there are a few other fullerene derivatives that have been applied to OPVs. Bis(silylmethyl)[60]fullerenes,16 indene17 and dihydromethylene18 multi-adducts of fullerene achieved successfully high performances on their OPV cells by a combination with tetrabenzoporphyrin and P3HT donors, respectively. Compared with these fullerene derivatives, fulleropyrrolidines have the advantages from a chemical viewpoint, e.g. a simple one-step synthetic procedure under Prato reaction conditions from pristine fullerene,19 ease of modification of the substituents linked to the pyrrolidine ring by using commercially available or easily prepared glycine and aldehyde derivatives as reactants, and higher chemical stability of the pyrrolidine structure than that of the three-membered ring against the corresponding retro-cyclization reactions;20 nevertheless, fulleropyrrolidine derivatives have not attracted much attention because the performances of fulleropyrrolidine derivative-based OPV cells remain at an insufficient level.21 To the best of our knowledge, precedents for the fulleropyrrolidines that showed a performance as good as PC61BM as the OPV acceptor are limited to recently reported N-methoxyethoxyethyl-2-aryl[60]fulleropyrrolidines22a,22b and indole-containing fulleropyrrolidine derivatives.22c Taking this situation into consideration, we have rigorously investigated the OPV performances of [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives bearing relatively simple substituents like PC61BM. In this paper, we report on the synthesis and electronic properties of novel [60]fulleropyrrolidines and on the characteristics of [60]fulleropyrrolidine-based OPV cells in comparison with those of the corresponding PC61BM-based cells. Consequently, the performance data of BHJ-type OPV cells fabricated from the synthesized [60]fulleropyrrolidines with P3HT as an electron donor revealed that N-phenyl-substituted [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives are good OPV acceptors comparable to PC61BM. Finally, the high potential of the N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidines as n-type OPV materials is demonstrated by their improved performances in combination with a low-band-gap p-type polymer, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7).5 These OPV performances are the highest class among the cells based on [60]fullerene derivatives. Considering their ease of synthesis, N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives are a promising alternative to PC61BM.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of fulleropyrrolidine derivatives
Novel [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives 1–6 investigated in this work are shown in Fig. 1. Their chemical structures were designed to make consecutive variations from a PC61BM analogue. Compounds 1 and 2 are analogous to PC61BM in their substituents with the replacement of the cyclopropane ring with a pyrrolidine ring. The replacement of the N-phenyl group in 1 with a dodecyl group leads to the structure of a typical N-alkylfulleropyrrolidine derivative 3. On the other hand, the replacement of the methyl butyrate group at C-2 on the pyrrolidine ring of 1 with phenyl, hexyl, and 2,5,8-trioxanonyl substituents leads to a series of N-phenyl derivatives 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The synthetic method for these [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives is depicted in Scheme 1,20 in which the essential starting components, glycine and aldehyde derivatives, were purchased or prepared using conventional synthetic procedures.23–25 The synthesized [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives were purified by recycling preparative gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) eluted with chloroform and then by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using COSMOSIL Buckyprep® columns eluted with toluene, and were obtained as black or brown powders. These [60]fulleropyrrolidines 1–6 were soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene, affording good processability for OPV-cell fabrication.

UV-vis absorption
UV-vis absorption spectra of the [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives 1–6 and PC61BM in chloroform solutions are shown in Fig. 2. All the compounds exhibited two characteristic absorption bands between 250 and 350 nm with peak maxima at 257 and 310–320 nm similar to pristine C60.26 The [60]fulleropyrrolidines exhibited a weak sharp absorption at 430 nm, which is similarly observed for PC61BM at 431 nm and is distinctive of fulleropyrrolidine and methanofullerene monoadducts.22,26,27 This absorption is known as a transition originating in partially broken symmetry of the fullerene core28 and not observed in bisadducts.29 A weak absorption peak around 700 nm detected in all of the compounds corresponds to the HOMO–LUMO transition of the fullerene core. Overall, it is clear that the different substituent groups on the pyrrolidine ring do not affect the electronic structure of the fullerene π-system because all the spectra were very similar in shape as well as in molar extinction coefficients.

Electrochemical properties
To investigate the electrochemical properties and estimate the LUMO energy levels of the [60]fulleropyrrolidines, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out, together with PC61BM for comparison, using a three-electrode cell in a chlorobenzene/CH3CN (5/1, v/v) mixed solvent. The LUMO energy levels (ELUMOs) of the compounds were estimated using the following empirical equation: ELUMO = −(E11/2 + 4.8) eV, where E11/2 is the first half-wave reduction potential relative to Fe/Fe+.30 The cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. S1,† and the obtained half-wave potential (E1/2) and ELUMO values are summarized in Table 1. The [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives underwent two reversible redox processes similar to PC61BM within a potential window of the measurement, and their first reduction potentials showed a little deviation within ±0.03 V from that of PC61BM. Therefore, the LUMO energy levels of the [60]fulleropyrrolidine compounds were little affected by the substituents, though the C-2 alkyl and alkyl ether substituted compounds (5 and 6) showed slightly higher LUMO energy levels compared with the methyl butyrate or phenyl substituted compounds (1 or 4). These photophysical and electrochemical measurements clearly indicate that the molecular-level electronic properties of the [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives are quite similar to those of PC61BM.

OPV performances
The properties of BHJ-type OPV cells fabricated from the present [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives as acceptor materials and P3HT as a donor material were investigated with a standard device structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS/active layer/Al, in which PEDOT-PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate), used as a buffer layer. Conditions for the fabrication of BHJ active layers were optimized on solvent and concentration for spin-coating, donor–acceptor (D/A) ratio, and annealing temperature (see Experimental). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized OPV cells measured under simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3, and their photovoltaic performance data including a short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are summarized in Table 2. Interestingly, the PCEs ranged largely from 0.02% to 2.41% depending on the substituents of the [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives. Under the same device structure and measurement conditions, the PC61BM-based reference cell exhibited a PCE of 2.30% (Table 2). The OPV device using compound 1 exhibited a moderate PCE of 1.83%. In contrast, the device based on compound 2 showed low Jsc, low Voc, and low FF values, resulting in a poor PCE of 0.21%, despite its similar chemical structure to compound 1 with only the difference of substituent positions on the pyrrolidine ring. Moreover, when the phenyl substituent at the N-1 position in compound 1 was replaced with a dodecyl group in compound 3 to enhance the solubility, the device based on 3 exhibited substantially low OPV performance with a PCE of 0.02%. The J–V characteristics of these low-PCE devices based on 2 and 3 showed S-shaped features (Fig. 3) that led to their low FF and Jsc values. These findings confirm the critical dependence of the device performance on the chemical structures of the [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives, and it appears that the N-phenyl group has a positive effect. Indeed, OPV cells fabricated using the N-phenyl derivatives 4, 5, and 6 exhibited relatively good performances as shown in Table 2. The highest performance was marked by the OPV cell based on compound 4, which has phenyl groups at both the N-1 and C-2 positions of the pyrrolidine ring, exhibiting a Jsc of 8.309 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.594 V, FF of 0.488, and the resulting PCE of 2.41%. It is noteworthy that the OPV performances of the cells based on these N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidines 4–6 are comparable to, or even higher than, that of the standard PC61BM-based cell.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out to investigate the surface morphologies of the blend films consisting of the fullerene derivatives and P3HT. As shown in Fig. S2,† all films appeared to have substantially well-blended structures and displayed a root-mean-square roughness of less than 5 nm. In detailed comparison of the AFM images, all the fulleropyrrolidine-based blend films exhibited similar-sized or slightly large-sized (P3HT/1: Fig. S2a†) grain morphologies compared with the P3HT/PC61BM blend film (Fig. S2h†). Thus, no clear correlation between the film morphologies and the OPV performances is observed. These well-blended film morphologies indicate that the synthesized [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives have achieved miscibility with P3HT, which is one of the important requirements for OPV applications of acceptor materials. Although several causes are supposed,31 the S-shaped J–V curves observed in the low-PCE OPV cells based on N-alkyl[60]fulleropyrrolidines 2 and 3 might be partially caused by high series resistances resulting from undesirable interactions between the highly basic N-alkylpyrrolidine and strongly acidic PSS comprised in the buffer layer.22b This was supported by the fact that the performances of compound 2 and 3 based devices were improved by using a MoOx buffer layer instead of PEDOT:PSS to PCEs of 1.44% and 0.54%, respectively, whereas, on the same device structure, no improvement of the PCE for 1 based devices was observed (Fig. S3 and Table S1 in the ESI†).
For further improvements of OPV performance and demonstrating the potential of the N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives 4–6 as the acceptor materials, we fabricated the OPV cells using a combination with PTB7 (the chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1),5 which is a commercially available low-band-gap p-type polymer. In addition, the following inverted device structure,32 which is advantageous to device durability,33 was applied: ITO/PFN/active layer/MoOx/Al, in which PFN is poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)], used as a cathode interlayer.32,34 A PC61BM-based cell with the same device structure was also fabricated for comparing the performances. The active layer was spin-coated on the PFN layer from a chlorobenzene solution of the PTB7/acceptor (1/1.5 weight ratio) blend including 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) in a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 4, the J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices based on N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidines 4–6 were almost identical to those of the PC61BM-based device. Their performance data are summarized in Table 3. The 4-based device exhibited a higher Jsc compared with other devices, whereas the devices using C-2-alkylated 5 and 6 showed apparently higher Voc values than the 4-based and PC61BM-based devices, probably reflecting their slightly higher LUMO energy levels (Table 1).35 Overall, the device using the PTB7/4 blend film exhibited the highest PCE of 7.34% among these devices. It is worth noting that the PCE values of PTB7/4 and PTB7/5 blends are higher than that of the PTB7/PC61BM blend. The AFM images of these blend films shown in Fig. S3† revealed similar roughness and grain sizes to the PTB7/PC61BM blend film, suggesting the formation of a nano-size phase-separated structure appropriate for obtaining high BHJ OPV performances. From careful observation, the PTB7/6 blend film was found to have a slightly smaller grain structure, which might affect its slightly low Jsc and FF values.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized novel [60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives and investigated their detailed electronic absorption, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties. Though the absorption and electrochemical properties of all these compounds closely resemble each other and those of PC61BM, BHJ OPV cells fabricated using the [60]fulleropyrrolidines as acceptor materials and P3HT as a donor material demonstrated clearly varied performances according to the substituents on the pyrrolidine ring. The OPV cells based on the N-alkyl-substituted fulleropyrrolidines 2 and 3 exhibited low performances, while the performances obtained from the cells using the N-phenyl fulleropyrrolidine derivatives 4, 5, and 6 were comparable to or even higher than that of the corresponding PC61BM-based cell. This result indicates that the presence of the N-phenyl group has a positive effect on OPV performances. Furthermore, we fabricated the OPV devices using these N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidines with a typical low-band gap polymer (PTB7) as a donor material, and found that these devices exhibited excellent performances. Note that both the performances of the 4- and 5-based cells exceed that of the corresponding PC61BM-based cell, suggesting the high potential of the N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives. Although Tan et al. recently reported 8.75% efficiency using a low-band-gap p-type polymer (PBDTBDD) and PC61BM,36 the PCE of 7.34% obtained from the PTB7/4 blend is still the world's highest class performance among [60]fullerene-based OPV cells.37 Considering their ease of synthesis, N-phenyl[60]fulleropyrrolidine derivatives are a promising alternative to PC61BM for OPV acceptor materials.

UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3100PC. All spectra were obtained in spectrograde solvents using quartz cells with a 1 cm path length. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a JEOL JNM-ECS400 (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C) spectrometer in chloroform-d [chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane as an internal standard]. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out on a BAS CV-50W voltammetric analyzer using Pt working and counter electrodes in a chlorobenzene/CH3CN (5/1, v/v) solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel, KANTO Chemical silica-gel 60N (40–50 μm).

OPV device fabrication and measurements
Patterned ITO on a glass slide (Sanyo Vacuum Industries Co., Ltd.) was treated in an O2-plasma oven for 5 min. Thereafter, a PEDOT-PSS layer is prepared on the ITO-coated glass slide by spin-coating (500 rpm for 5 s and then 3000 rpm for 60 s) of a filtered (0.45 μm pore size PTFE membrane filter) aqueous suspension of PEDOT-PSS (Clevios P VP Al 4083), and then baked at 135 °C for 10 min in air. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Merck Ltd.) and the fullerene derivative were dissolved in chlorobenzene at room temperature and then spin coated on the top of the PEDOT-PSS layer at 1500 rpm for 60 s. The thicknesses of the resulting P3HT/acceptor films were found to be ca. 130 nm. The device fabrication was completed by the vacuum deposition of the Al cathode (ca. 80 nm) through a shadow mask, which defined the active area of each OPV device to be 3 × 3 mm2. The device was thermally annealed for 10 min prior to performance measurements; the optimized annealing temperature is 80 °C for 1, 80 °C for 2, no annealed for 3, 130 °C for 4, 130 °C for 5, no annealed for 6, and 130 °C for PC61BM.
For the inverted device structure of ITO/PFN/PTB7:acceptor/MoOx/Al, the PFN interlayer material was dissolved in methanol (concentration, 2 mg mL−1) in the presence of a small amount of acetic acid and spin-coated on top of the precleaned ITO substrate in accordance with literature conditions.32,34 The organic active layer, with a thickness of 90–100 nm, was prepared by spin coating from a blend solution (concentration, 25 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene including 1,8-diiodoctane (3%) at 1000 rpm for 2 min in a nitrogen atmosphere. A 10 nm MoOx layer and an 80 nm Al layer were successively evaporated in a vacuum chamber through a shadow mask to form a top anode with defining the active area of the devices (3 × 3 mm2).
The solar cells were subsequently tested under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2, SAN-EI ELECTRIC CO., LTD. XES-301S). Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a PC-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter.
