    , Accepted 26th May 2020First published on 26th May 2020AbstractElectrochemical reduction of CO2 into value-added fuels and chemicals driven by renewable energy presents a potentially sustainable route to mitigate CO2 emissions and alleviate the dependence on fossil fuels. While tailoring the electronic structure of active components to modulate their intrinsic reactivity could tune the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), their use is limited by the linear scaling relation of intermediates. Due to the high susceptibility of the CO2RR to the local CO2 concentration/pH and mass transportation of CO2/intermediates/products near the gas–solid–liquid three-phase interface, engineering catalysts’ morphological and interfacial properties holds great promise to regulate the CO2RR, which are irrelevant with linear scaling relation and possess high resistance to harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in tuning CO2 reduction electrocatalysis via morphology and interface engineering. The fundamentals of the CO2RR and design principles for electrode materials are presented firstly. Then, approaches to build an efficient three-phase interface, tune the surface wettability, and design a favorable morphology are summarized; the relationship between the properties of engineered catalysts and their CO2RR performance is highlighted to reveal the activity-determining parameters and underlying catalytic mechanisms. Finally, challenges and opportunities are proposed to suggest the future design of advanced CO2RR electrode materials.

Broader context
Producing value-added fuels and chemicals from CO2 using electrochemical approaches is a promising way to recycle greenhouse gases and mitigate the dependence on fossil fuels. However, scaling up this technology to industry-level faces grand challenges due to the lack of highly active, stable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). While engineering the electronic structure of catalysts to tune the CO2RR behaviors has been investigated for decades, the linear scaling relation of the adsorption with multiple intermediates limits its applicability in regulating the CO2RR for generating the desired products. Thanks to the high dependence of the CO2RR on the local environment and mass transportation near the gas–solid–liquid interface, modulating the morphology and interface properties presents an effective strategy to regulate CO2 reduction. These modifications are not only insusceptible to linear scaling relation but also possess high resistance to harsh reaction conditions, showing great promise to achieve high-efficiency CO2 conversion. In this Review, we summarize the most recent achievements in tuning the CO2RR through engineering electrode catalysts’ morphology, surface wettability, and three-phase interface. We provide the design principles and review typical approaches to fabricate engineered electrodes. Particularly, we discuss the relationship between the electrode properties and CO2RR performance to gain insight into the activity-governing parameters and catalytic mechanisms. Finally, we propose strategies to guide the further design of advanced electrode materials. We hope that this Review could increase researcher's attention on this emerging direction and inspire more innovative strategies to propel the practical implementation of CO2 electroconversion and other electrocatalysis-related technologies.

1. Introduction
Since the 19th century, a tremendous amount of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas has been consumed as the main energy source to sustain rapid economic development and population growth. Consequently, the level of as-emitted carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is increasing drastically, which may reach 570 ppm by 2100, and this has raised big concerns regarding numerous environmental issues due to the potential contributions to global warming.1,2 While previous efforts to reduce the atmospheric CO2 concentration mainly focused on CO2 capture and storage (CCS),3,4 current attention has moved onto CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) due to its merits of effectiveness and sustainability.5–10 Among various proposed routes for CO2 conversion, the electrochemical transformation of CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels holds greatest promise because it can be carried out under mild ambient conditions and could directly store electricity and CO2 as transportable liquid fuels at a relatively high rate.1,11–13 Further, CO2 from the use of CO2 reduction-generated fuels could be captured and recycled, resulting in an effective artificial carbon cycle. With the growing abundance of renewable electricity from solar, wind, and geothermal energy and the decrease in its price,14,15 renewable energy-powered CO2 electrolysis technology shows the closest gap to large-scale commercialization.
A full CO2 electrolysis setup includes a cathode, an anode, an electrolyte, and a membrane, similar to overall water splitting.7 Water oxidization, namely the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurs at the anode, producing gaseous O2, electrons, and protons. The electrons travel to the cathode through an external circuit, and the protons pass through the membrane and electrolyte to the cathode under the electric field. At the cathode, the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) takes place at the gas–solid–liquid three-phase interface, where CO2 combines with electrons and protons, generating products (Fig. 1A). The separation of the OER and CO2RR by the membrane is to prevent the cathodic CO2RR-generated products from being re-oxidized at the anode and mixing of O2 with the CO2RR-products. CO2RR electrocatalysis is a multi-step process involving multiple proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes, which is the cornerstone of CO2 electro-conversion technology because of the stable nature of the linear CO2 molecule. This situation necessarily requires the use of CO2RR catalysts (cathode) to activate CO2 and implement the CO2 reduction process. Theoretically, the CO2RR could generate a variety of products, such as C1 (carbon monoxide, formic acid, methane, methanol, etc.), C2 (ethylene, ethanol, acetate, and ethylene glycol), and C2+ products (propanol and propionaldehyde).16,17 The distribution of the products and the conversion efficiency depend highly on the cathodic electrode materials. It is ideally expected that CO2RR electrode materials could produce a single targeted product with 100% Faradaic efficiency and at a low overpotential with a large current density and long-term durability (Fig. 1B). Besides enhanced performance, the catalysts should be made of earth-abundant cost-effective elements to enable large-scale application.

(C) Faradaic efficiencies and partial current densities achieved for different products over state-of-the-art catalysts. The data reported in ref. 28–30 were collected in flow cells with a three-electrode configuration. The data reported in ref. 31 were collected in an H-type cell with a three-electrode configuration. The data reported in ref. 32 were collected in a fuel cell with a two-electrode configuration. 
A large variety of electrocatalytic materials have been developed to produce various compounds from the CO2RR. For example, Pd, Bi, and Sn are active for formic acid production,7,18–20 Au, Au, Zn, and single-atom Fe/Ni for CO generation,21–24 and Cu and Cu-based composites for C2 and C2+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates.16,25–27 The highest Faradaic efficiency and corresponding current density achieved so far are summarized in Fig. 1C. Reducing CO2 to CO and HCOOH reached partial current densities of 350/210 mA cm−2 and Faradaic efficiencies of 99%/98% on an Ag layer coated on carbon nanotubes28 and defective bismuth oxide nanotubes29 at −0.8/−0.58 V vs. RHE in alkaline flow cells, respectively. For C2H4 generation, a Faradaic efficiency of 66% and a partial current density of 180 mA cm−2 were achieved on a modified Cu electrode at −0.55 V vs. RHE in an alkaline flow cell.30 The CO2RR performance to form CH3OH and C2H5OH is relatively poor, showing Faradaic efficiencies of 78%/41% and partial current densities of 42/124 mA cm−2 on copper selenide at −0.28 V vs. RHE in an H-type cell31 and 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine iron(III) chloride (FeTPP[Cl])–Cu hybrid catalysts (FeTPP[Cl]–Cu) in a fuel cell at 3 V,32 respectively. The reported stability of these catalysts is less than 100 h and the energy efficiencies are below 80% (without consideration of overpotentials at the anodic OER). Reducing CO2 to other economically desirable high-order products faces considerably big challenges due to the lack of suitable catalysts. Techno-economic modeling shows that a practically feasible catalyst should be able to produce a single product with an Faradaic efficiency above 90%, a partial current density above 200 mA cm−2, and stability more than 1000 h at a potential more positive than −0.6 V.33,34 Obviously, it is still far away for the current systems to simultaneously meet these thresholds for practical application.
With the extensive investigation of CO2RR mechanisms, it turns out that CO2 reduction is highly governed by the electrode materials’ electronic structure, local morphology, interfacial properties, and reaction conditions (Fig. 1B).7,35 Among these factors, engineering the electronic structure of active sites has been extensively studied to tune the CO2RR. The basic principle is that the heterogeneous CO2RR typically involves the adsorption of intermediates on the catalyst surface.36 Thereby, modulating the atomic and/or nano scale electronic properties of catalysts, such as via defects,37,38 doping,39–41 alloying,25,42 strain,43,44 faceting,123 grain boundaries,180 atom locations (edges, corners, and terraces),45,46,181 and surface distortion,47–49 could modulate the binding strength between intermediates and active sites, in turn the adsorption/desorption of intermediates, and finally the distribution and generation rate of products. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, can also govern CO2 reduction via adjusting the CO2 concentration, solution pH, reduction kinetics, etc.,50 which are more relevant to technological manipulation. A succinct overview of both electronic property engineering and reaction condition selection has been summarized in recently published Perspectives and Reviews.5,9,11,37,51–54
While modifying the electronic structure to alter the intrinsic reactivity has been demonstrated, there exist big challenges to sustain catalytic stability because the chemical components of catalysts tend to be changed in harsh reaction conditions.55 For example, Cu-based catalysts with positively charged species (Cuδ+) have been demonstrated to possess higher catalytic selectivity for the production of C2H4 than metallic Cu. However, Cuδ+ is prone to be reduced to Cu0 under negative applied potentials under real conditions, resulting in activity deactivation.56,57 More challengingly, the linear scaling relation,58,59 which states the linearly related adsorption energies of various CO2RR-involved intermediates on catalysts’ surfaces, limits the design of specifically active catalysts because tuning the adsorption of one intermediate will similarly affect that of others. This means that the Sabatier design principle is hard to realize in the multi-step CO2RR process, which indicates that the binding energy of the key intermediate should be neither too strong nor too weak to reduce the activation barriers and to achieve a high generation rate of the targeted product.20,60–62
Besides the aforementioned electronic structure and reaction conditions, recent findings demonstrated that the CO2RR is very sensitive to the local CO2 concentration and electrolyte pH at the electrode–electrolyte interface and the mass transportation of CO2RR-involved species.30,63–65 Modifying the electrode catalysts’ morphology and interface properties could tune the product selectivity, overpotential, current density, productivity, charge transfer resistance, mass transportation, reaction kinetics, and stability, despite the fact that the atomic and/or nano level electronic structure of various morphologies remains the same. Different from engineering the electronic properties of active components, constructing a suitable morphology and interface is not limited by the linear scaling relation, which appears to be a promising strategy to achieve efficient CO2 electro-conversion. However, there is a lack of in-depth overviews on this emerging topic to provide general principles for future design. To this end, we particularly set our focus on reviewing recent achievements to explore the relationship between the morphology and interface of electrode materials and their electrocatalytic CO2RR performance. We first presented fundamentals and challenges in the field of CO2RR, followed by providing principle interpretation on how the morphological and interfacial properties could govern the CO2RR, including the local CO2 concentration, interfacial alkalinity, management of mass transportation, density of active sites, and enhancement of the kinetics. Further, we reviewed recently developed approaches for constructing favorable three-phase interfaces, engineering the surface wettability, and fabricating an activity-dependent morphology. The relationship between engineered catalysts and their catalytic performance was also comprehensively discussed to provide an insightful understanding of catalytic mechanisms. Finally, we pointed out challenges and provided suggestions for the future design of advanced CO2RR electrode materials. We expect that this Review could open up new opportunities to address challenges faced by CO2 reduction and other energy-related electrocatalysis.
2. Fundamentals and challenges
The CO2RR takes place at a complex three-phase interface of solid catalyst–liquid electrolyte–gaseous CO2. As suggested by both theoretical simulation and experimental investigation,54,66–68 the electrocatalytic CO2RR mainly includes CO2 activation, surface reaction, and product desorption processes. In this section, we will introduce the fundamentals and challenges of the CO2RR.
2.1 Activity descriptors
To evaluate the performance of electrocatalysts and catalytic systems for the CO2RR, several fundamental parameters need to be considered, mainly including the Faradaic efficiency (FE, the product selectivity of the targeted products), overpotential (η, the potential difference between the thermodynamic standard potential and the experimental potential), energy efficiency (EE, the ratio between the output energy from the CO2RR and the input energy), current density (J, the production rate), and stability (capability for long-term use). The definition of these parameters is described in detail in the ESI† (Note 1). It is worth mentioning that all these descriptors should be considered jointly to assess the overall performance of an electrocatalyst. Ideally, a high-performance catalyst should be engineered to have enhanced FE, J, EE, and stability while working at a low η.
2.2 Thermodynamics of CO2 reduction
CO2 is a fully oxidized and thermodynamically stable molecule with linear geometry. The dissociation energy of the CO bond in CO2 is about 750 kJ mol−1, indicating a large activation energy and huge energy input for direct CO bond dissociation.69–71 To facilitate CO2 reduction, activation has been considered to be the first step, in which the linear CO2 structure will be transformed into bent configurations to weaken the CO bond by forming chemical bonds between CO2 and catalytic sites on the catalyst's surface. It is generally proposed that there are four types of mechanisms in CO2 activation (labeled ①, ②, ③, and ④ in Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Summary of CO2RR pathways towards different products. Black, red, white, and blue spheres refer to carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and the catalyst, respectively. Adapted with permission from ref. 35. Copyright 2018 Springer Nature Group. 
In mechanism ①, CO2 is transformed into an anionic radical with one electron (* + CO2 + e− → *CO2˙−),72–74 which requires a negative redox potential of −1.9 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). It is generally considered that the stabilization of adsorbed CO2˙− by electron coupling between CO2˙− and suitable electrocatalysts can initiate the CO2RR at many positive potentials, resulting in low overpotentials experimentally.35,75–77 Besides selecting suitable catalysts, previous findings also demonstrate that employing proper additives in the electrolytes can also lower the initial reduction barrier, in which the additives function as co-catalysts to stabilize the *CO2˙− on the catalyst surface by forming a complexation interaction, resulting in the decrease in the free energy of *CO2˙− formation (Fig. S1, ESI†).78,79 For instance, Rosen et al.78 found that adding 18 mol% of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM-BF4) in aqueous solution results in the generation of CO at an applied potential of 1.5 V in a two-electrode cell, about 0.6 V smaller than that observed for the same system without adding EMIM-BF4.
Unlike mechanism ①, which forms a high-energy *CO2˙− radical, the PCET process has been widely considered to reduce the activation energy, leading to the occurrence of the CO2RR at low overpotentials.80 There are two pathways for the PCET route: mechanism ② and ③ in Fig. 2, in which CO2 is transformed into C-bound *COOH (* + CO2 + H+ + e− → *COOH) and O-bound *OCHO intermediates (* + CO2 + H+ + e− → *OCHO),66,81,82 respectively. These mechanisms have been widely employed in DFT calculations to explain experimental results on various catalysts. In mechanism ④, it is proposed that an anionic hydride species is formed via * + H+ + 2e− → *H−, which attacks CO2, generating the *OCHO intermediate.83–86
2.3 Kinetics of CO2 reduction
The electrode kinetics correlates directly to the selectivity and generation rates of the final products. To accurately describe the electrode kinetics, the plot of current as a function of potential is generally used. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the behavior of Butler–Volmer's model of electrode kinetics.87 It can be seen that, in the low overpotential range, the cathodic current (ic) increases with increasing overpotential, suggesting that the reaction is limited by heterogeneous kinetics. However, at large positive overpotentials, ic reaches a plateau, namely the limiting-current (il,c), which is independent of the overpotential but limited by mass transfer. Therefore, analyzing the nature of the limiting step could help to understand the actual relationship between the current and the overpotential. In the past few decades, extensive efforts have been made to explore the fundamental processes and influencing factors governing the kinetics of CO2 reduction, which are discussed below.
The CO2RR undergoes multiple pathways. Upon CO2 activation, the subsequent PCET process initiates a series of surface reactions involving the cleavage of C–O bonds, the coupling of C–C bonds, and the formation of C–H bonds, which eventually lead to the generation of different products.88 *OCHO, formed through mechanism ③, is considered to be the intermediate for forming formic acid (Fig. 2), which adsorbs on the catalyst surface via bonding between the O atom of *OCHO and the catalyst without the breakage of the CO bond of CO2. By contrast, *COOH is the intermediate to generate adsorbed *CO with the cleavage of CO.20 The *CO can either desorb from the catalyst surface to generate gaseous CO as the final product or couple to form high-order intermediates for C2 products through the *CO dimerization and subsequent PCET processes. Also, the formation of the *COH intermediate by *CO hydrogenation yields CH4 or CH3OH,89,90 and the coupling between C2H4 and CO yields C3 products.35 Note that the desorbed gaseous CO could serve as a reactant being further reduced to various hydrocarbons and oxygenates via the CO reduction reaction (CORR).91–93 However, most of these processes have not been fully confirmed experimentally due to the difficulty in capturing intermediates. The adsorption/desorption of intermediates in any step could considerably influence the overall performance, of which the rate-limiting step is still not well established.
Moreover, the CO2RR involves multiple electron transfer processes, such as 2e− for CO, 6e− for CH3OH, 8e− for CH4, and 12e− for C2H4. Thereby, the electron transfer affects not only the CO2 reduction rate but also the selectivity of the products. Electrochemically, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) can be used to estimate the capability of electron transmission from the catalyst surface to the reactant as well as intermediates. A lower Rct means a faster electron transfer process, which can be determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Asadi et al.94 demonstrated that nanoflakes could enable much faster electron transfer than bulk materials, delivering an Rct of ∼180 ohms at an overpotential of 150 mV on tungsten diselenide (WS2) nanoflakes in the CO2RR, much smaller than the ∼420 ohms of a bulk MoS2 plate. The enhanced electron transmission contributes to a larger current density on WS2 nanoflakes as compared to the MoS2 plate.
Mass transportation is another important factor influencing the CO2RR kinetics. CO2 reduction involves the transportation of many species, such as the dissolution of CO2 into solution, the approach of CO2 from the bulk electrolyte to the boundary layer and the electrode surface, the transportation of intermediates in the heterogeneous electrocatalytic interface, and the movement of the product away from the reaction interface into the bulk solution (Fig. S3, ESI†).95,96 Reported studies show that the CO2RR on polycrystalline Ag exhibited a Tafel slope of 132 mV dec−1 at low overpotentials,97 suggesting that the rate-determining step is the initial electron transfer to CO2 forming a surface adsorbed *COOH intermediate. This indicates that the transport process of CO2 does not interfere with the supply of CO2 due to the low consumption rate. By contrast, when CO2 reduction was conducted on a curved Ag surface, which has enhanced intrinsic capability for the CO2RR, a smaller Tafel slope of 58 mV dec−1 was observed, indicating that the rate-limiting step probably relates to the issues of the diffusion of CO2 and products out of/into the catalyst nanopores.97,98
Besides the above-described factors, the kinetics of CO2 reduction can also be governed by the electrolyte, temperature, and pressure, which are presented in the ESI† (Note 2). With these analyses, it can be inferred that the CO2RR is a very complex process with numerous inherent drawbacks. Such a situation leads to a few challenges in CO2RR electrocatalysis, which will be given in detail next.
2.4 Large overpotential
Theoretically, CO2 reduction has thermodynamic equilibrium potentials toward various products near 0 V vs. RHE (Table 1). However, more negative potentials are commonly applied to initiate the CO2RR and achieve high current density due to the inert thermodynamics and sluggish kinetics. More challengingly, the CO2RR is highly dependent on the applied potential, and the products’ FEs follow the tendency of increasing, reaching a maximum value, and then decreasing when sweeping the potential negatively. Thereby, the actual potentials needed to drive the CO2RR at maximum product selectivity are considerably more negative than the equilibrium ones. For example, the state-of-the-art Au and Ag catalysts showed overpotentials of more than 250 mV to reach FEs larger than 90% for CO production;98,99 Cu-based catalysts exhibited overpotentials larger than 600 mV to achieve the highest FE for ethylene and alcohol production.25,30,31 A large overpotential implies supernumerary energy input beyond the thermodynamically determined energy, thus resulting in a low energy conversion efficiency.35,88

2.5 Competition with hydrogen evolution
In the CO2RR, the protons are necessary to the reduction and hydrogenation processes, but they can be readily reduced by themselves as well, generating hydrogen, the so-called hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).7,100 Since the equilibrium potentials of the CO2RR are close to that of the HER (Table 1), the HER becomes a parasitic reaction competing with the CO2RR, which potentially lowers the current efficiency for the CO2RR.88,101–103 In the HER, the first step is the reduction of a proton on the catalyst surface to generate adsorbed *H (* + H+ + e− → *H, Volmer step).100,104 The CO2RR and HER share the same catalytic sites (e.g., metal atoms), and the binding energy between the metal sites and *H/*C/*O determines the catalyst's capability to suppress the HER. If a catalytic site binds *H more strongly than *C (or *O), the adsorption of *H will be promoted while the adsorption of *COOH (or *OCHO) will be suppressed, favoring the HER instead of the CO2RR. Thereby, a good CO2RR catalyst should have a suitably strong binding strength with *C (or *O) but a weak binding strength with *H. Single-atomic unsaturated Fe/Ni102,105–107 and polycrystalline Au108,109 show weak adsorption with *H and thus enhanced selectivity to the CO2RR.
2.6 Producing C2+ products
The CO2RR can produce a broad variety of products. Reducing CO2 with two electrons to first-order products is the simplest pathway,20 and the highly active and selective generation of CO and HCOOH with FEs of more than 98% and partial current densities above 200 mA cm−2 has been achieved (Fig. 1C). Compared to C1 products, C2+ products (include C2) are more valuable because of their larger energy density, market size, and contributions to reduce net carbon emissions.1,2 However, the current reported performance of C2+ products is far away from practical application (Fig. 1C). The main reason is that the CO2-to-C2+ process involves multiple PCET steps and elemental pathways. For example, synthesizing C2H4, C2H5OH, and C3H7OH consumes 12, 12, and 18 electrons and protons, making the overall process very complex and hard to be finely manipulated. Also, reducing CO2 to C2+ products needs not only the formation of adsorbed *CO but also C–C coupling (*CO dimerization) and hydrogenation,35 and there is a lack of understanding of the elementary steps and catalytic mechanisms. Designing a catalyst that can meet all these requirements is very challenging. So far, only copper,51 N-functionalized carbon,110 NiP,111 and MoS2112 were demonstrated to be able to generate C2+ products, but with unsatisfactory performance, especially for C3+ products. For instance, Cu mesh113 and edge-deficient MoS2112 were found to show low FEs of 13% and 3.5% for isopropyl alcohol generation, respectively.
2.7 Product separation
In the CO2RR, gaseous CO2 is hard to be fully converted, and a broad distribution of products commonly co-exist. Such a situation results in a mixture of gaseous products with CO2 in the gas phase and the dissolution of liquid products in the electrolyte. Therefore, the separation of products is generally imperative and critical for down-stream utilization. For gas-phase product separation, membrane (organic, ceramics, and metals)-based separation technology, which selectively permits the passage of wanted gas while rejecting the unwanted species, could finally solve this problem as it is considered to be less energy-intensive than traditional pressure-enabled separation technologies.114 However, membrane-enabled separation of high-value species from CO2, such as C2H4/C2H6/C3H6/C3H8, is still very challenging and at the early stage of research.115 Hybrid materials, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), are considered as promising membranes due to their tunable structure and composition.116 Regarding the liquid-phase products, the dissolution of products in the aqueous electrolyte leads to the formation of salts (such as formate instead of HCOOH) and low concentration. Distillation technology has been widely applied to separate liquid-phase products from solution based on the difference in the boiling point, which achieves phase separation through temperature modulation. However, distillation requires high heat inputs and cannot fully separate species with close boiling points. Reactor engineering could be a bright method to produce high-purity liquid products with variable concentration for direct use, such as a catholyte-free electrolyzer, which will be discussed in Section 5.1.3.
2.8 Linear scaling relation
An ideal catalyst should have free-energy barriers for all elemental pathways close to zero,20,60–62 suggesting that the catalyst surface should bind with intermediates neither too strongly nor too weakly. However, this is hard to realize because the adsorption energy of one intermediate scales linearly with that of the subsequent intermediates due to the same adsorption site, namely the linear scaling relation.58,59 It is worth noting that heterogenous CO2RR electrocatalysis is different from biomimetic catalysis. The latter is a predominantly homogeneous process and the catalytic process is commonly driven by the reaction between a coenzyme and reactant,117 in which the overall process is not governed by the adsorption of intermediates and thus the linear scaling relation is commonly not evident.
Nørskov et al.7,59 calculated the adsorption energy of *CO, *COH, *CHOH, and *CHO, clearly showing a linear relation on Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, and Pt surfaces (Fig. 3). The linear scaling relation cannot be even avoided in the design of catalysts for CO generation, which requires a catalyst to strongly bind *COOH to facilitate CO2 activation. However, such a case will lead to the strong adsorption of *CO too, which ultimately results in poor CO desorption and thus a low production rate. In other words, CO2 activation and CO desorption are non-optimal unless the scaling relation can be broken. This yields a volcano-shaped plot between the current density and adsorption energy of key intermediates.20 In the reduction of CO2 to C2+ products, the limitation of the linear scaling relation becomes more prominent because more intermediates are involved and their adsorption energies scale linearly with each other.

3. Classification of catalysts
According to the Sabatier principle, a good catalyst should have an optimal binding strength between the key reaction intermediates and the surface sites of the catalyst. Therefore, the electronic structure of materials strongly determines their intrinsic reactivity toward the CO2RR as the binding energy of key intermediates involved in the CO2RR, such as *H, *OCHO, *COOH, *CO, and *CHO, is mainly governed by the surface electronic properties of catalysts, which has been widely used as a key descriptor to classify catalysts based on the categories of products. Theoretically, the adsorption of these intermediate species on different metal surfaces has been extensively investigated through DFT calculations to distinguish catalysts.20,62,118 In this Section, we will introduce typically well-known catalysts for some common products from the CO2RR, and corresponding advantages and disadvantages will be discussed as well.
(1) CO. C-bound *COOH and *CO are key intermediates for the reduction of CO2 to CO, during which the formation of *COOH is the potential-limiting step and the desorption of *CO governs the current density. Noble metals Ag and Au are the state-of-the-art catalysts for CO generation due to their optimal binding strength with *COOH and weak adsorption with *CO, allowing facile CO2 activation and CO desorption (Fig. 4A and B).21,28 They achieved maximum FEs larger than 95% and high EEs above 80% at small overpotentials (<300 mV, Table 2). However, the inherent drawbacks of prohibitive cost and scarcity limit large-scale application. Metallic Fe, Ni, and Co are not good catalysts for the CO2RR due to their strong binding with *H, thus favoring proton reduction to hydrogen. Zn and ZnO also show high activity for CO with large current density but commonly need large overpotentials owing to the poor adsorption of *COOH.66,119 Besides, atomically dispersed nitrogen-coordinated transition metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) supported on carbon (M–N/C) have attracted much attention by advantage of the rich reserves, chemical stability, and good conductivity.102,103,120,121 Among them, Ni–N/C commonly shows higher current density but needs larger overpotentials as compared to Fe–N/C and Co–N/C. The catalytic properties of active M–N sites are highly sensitive to the coordinated N number and carbon support architecture, which has not been fully understood and needs further investigation. A report shows that highly active Fe3+ of Fe–N/C can be reduced to the less active Fe2+ when the applied potential is more negative than −0.5 V vs. RHE,24 which challenges the electrochemical stability.

(2) HCOOH. O-bound *OCHO is considered to be the key intermediate for HCOOH generation, and metallic Sn with near-optimal binding strength with *OCHO is highly selective for HCOOH (Fig. 4A and B). This observation is in good agreement with the findings obtained by Feaster et al.,20 where the volcano plot of HCOOH partial current densities at −0.9 V vs. RHE versus *OCHO binding energies was observed. Au, Ag, Pt, and Cu were found to have weak binding with *OCHO, while Ni and Zn bind *OCHO too strongly to produce HCOOH. Similarly, S-doped Sn,122 CuSn3 alloy,123 metallic Bi,19 defective Bi2O3 nanotubes,29 ultrathin Co,124 and atomic Co3O4 layers125 with stabilized *OCHO show enhanced activity for HCOOH production with higher FEs, smaller overpotentials, and larger EEs as compared to Sn (Table 2). Particularly, a high FE of 98%, a current density of 210 mA cm−2, and an EE of 78% have been reported on defective Bi2O3 nanotubes,29 whereas the performance of other catalysts still needs to be improved.
(3) CH3OH. For CH3OH generation, a key step is the transformation of C-bound *CO to the C-bound *CHO intermediate via the PCET-assisted hydrogenation process (*CO + H+ + e− → *CHO).35 Cu2O was found to show an FE of 47.5% at a potential of −1.6 V, implying a large overpotential of around 1.6 V and a poor EE of 21% given the standard equilibrium potential of −0.03 V.126 Copper selenide31 and FeP nanoarrays127 possess unique electronic properties to facilitate the formation of *CHO with decreased energy barriers, showing high FEs above 75% and EEs above 60%. Especially for FeP, it exhibits the highest FE of 80% and EE of 69% at a low overpotential of 197 mV, despite the fact that the current density remains low (<0.96 mA cm−2). In addition, Pd nanoparticles supported on SnO2 nanosheets6 and isolated CoPc anchored on CNTs128 also exhibit promising FEs above 40%. Overall, the reported performance remains much below the requirements for practical application.
(4) C2H4. Different from C1 products, the dimerization of *CO to form C–C bonds is the essential step for C2 products (Fig. 4C), followed by hydrogenation forming C2H4. Cu was found to have unique properties to yield C2H4 due to the unfavorable desorption of *CO and capability to form the C–C bond.51 The catalytic properties of Cu depend strongly on the facet with (100) showing higher selectivity than (111).35 Generally, Cu shows a low selectivity in neutral media with FEs commonly less than 40% and EEs less than 25.129 Using alkaline media was discovered to be able to promote the C–C coupling with C2H4 FEs above 60% and EEs above 50%.30 In addition, the positively charged Cu species (Cuδ+) shows intrinsically enhanced capability to boost C–C formation than Cu0, achieving 60% FEs on both Cu oxide and Cu3N in the neutral solution.130,131 The drawback is that the Cuδ+ species tend to be reduced to Cu0 under negatively applied potentials, causing a decrease in the electrochemical stability.39
(5) C2H5OH. Cu-Based materials have been extensively investigated for C2H5OH. However, the mechanistic discovery demonstrates that Cu sites favor the formation of *CCH instead of *CHCHOH intermediates, preferentially resulting in C2H4 rather than C2H5OH (Fig. 4C).32 As a result, metallic Cu and Cu(I) oxide show poor selectivity with FEs below 20% and EEs as low as 5% for C2H5OH.132,133 Very recently, a tandem catalyst (FeTPP[Cl]–Cu), composed of molecular FeTPP[Cl] and metallic Cu, was discovered to show a high FE up to 41%.32 The authors attributed the enhanced selectivity to the addition of the molecular FeTPP[Cl] co-catalyst, which yields a high local CO concentration and facilitates the formation of *CHCHOH intermediates (Fig. 4C). In addition to metal-based catalysts, metal-free carbon has been demonstrated to be able to reduce CO2 to C2H5OH. A typical example is ordered mesoporous N-doped carbon, in which the pyridinic N was theoretically confirmed to be the catalytic site and possess better reactivity than the pyrrolic N.134 Remarkedly, a high FE of 77% and an EE of 45% were realized at −0.7 V.134 However, the current density remains very low (<1 mA cm−2), requiring further improvement.
4. Catalyst design principles
The above-mentioned limitations and challenges largely retard the development of highly active, selective, and stable CO2RR catalysts. Engineering the electronic structure of catalysts to adjust their inherent reactivity is largely limited by the linear scaling relation. Recent advances demonstrate that, in addition to the electronic properties, the morphological and interfacial properties of electrode materials can also drastically influence the electrocatalytic CO2RR selectivity and reactivity, which are non-relevant to the linear scaling relation. Therefore, fine engineering of the morphology, surface, and interface could be a promising route to eventually fabricate advanced catalyst systems for high-efficiency CO2 electro-conversion. In this section, we provided design principles on how these properties affect CO2RR behaviors.
4.1 Local CO2 concentration
CO2 reduction needs a high concentration of local CO2 at the electrode surface to achieve a large production rate. However, CO2 has poor solubility in aqueous solution with the ratio of CO2 to H2O molecules being ∼1:1300 at 1 atm pressure. Along with the reaction between CO2 and OH− that consumes CO2,153 the availability of CO2 molecules that can reach the electrode surface is largely limited. Therefore, increasing the local CO2 concentration is considerably challenging but crucial. The traditional strategies to improve the CO2 concentration include increasing the reaction system pressure50 and employing alkaline metal ions;154 their use, however, is hindered by the incompatibility with easy operation and limited solubility of alkaline salts. Alternatively, porous materials have been widely employed to capture CO2 by utilizing the pores as CO2 storage space.3,155 Thereby, a porous architecture could be suitable to store CO2 and enhance the local CO2 concentration when the catalyst's surface is hydrophobic for preventing electrolyte flow into the pores. Besides, a hydrophobic surface itself can keep water away from the electrode surface,156 leaving water-free space to store gaseous CO2. On the other hand, gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) mounted in flow cells and fuel cells can utilize a hydrophobic gas diffusion layer (GDL) to quickly deliver CO2 into the catalyst's surface while avoiding a long transportation distance in the electrolyte (Fig. 5A).24,144,153,157,158 Therefore, constructing pores, employing a GDL, and modifying the wettability could increase the local CO2 concentration.

4.2 Interfacial alkalinity
The pH at the electrode and electrolyte interface plays key roles in the CO2RR. In 1989, Hori et al.162 found that a locally high pH near a Cu electrode could facilitate the further reduction of the *CO intermediate to C2H4, which was recently revealed to be from the favorable *CO dimerization in an alkaline environment.163,164 In addition, a high pH circumstance can give a low concentration of protons and thus restrain the HER. Note that even when CO2 reduction is conducted under a neutral pH electrolyte, the local alkalinity near the electrode surface could be gradually elevated since both the CO2RR and HER consume protons.135 However, high alkalinity is hard to maintain because the local electrolyte will quickly blend with the bulk electrolyte and reduce such an effect. The hydrophobic electrode can promote the preservation of high alkalinity due to insufficient contact between the bulk and local electrolytes. Compared to a flat electrode, a high-porosity one is conductive to yield an enhanced local pH due to the convection inside of pores.136
Although alkaline media can provide high alkalinity near the electrode surface, it is undesirable to use alkaline electrolytes in an H-type cell as OH− can react with CO2 and hinder the travel of CO2 molecules to the electrode surface. Using a hydrophobic GDL makes the use of alkaline electrolytes in a flow cell practicable because the GDL can suppress the overladen contact between CO2 and KOH solution while permitting CO2 to penetrate the GDL and reach the electrode–electrolyte interface.158 However, the GDL tends to lose hydrophobicity in long-term use, limiting its lifespan. Inserting a catalyst in between a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based GDL and carbon NP/graphite layer has been demonstrated to be able to prevent overflooding,30 where carbon NP/graphite serves as a stabilizing layer to maintain the hydrophobicity of the GDL.
4.3 Management of mass transportation
If an electrocatalytic reaction involves only a single diffusing species and a single product, speeding up or lowering species transportation can only accelerate or slow down the reaction rate.64 The CO2RR has diverse reaction intermediates/partners and these compete with the parasitic HER in concurrent reaction paths simultaneously. If the susceptibility of the desired reaction pathway to transport limitation is less than the unwanted one, retarding the species transportation can decrease the reaction rates of undesired reactions while the reaction rates of the reactions of interest can remain unchanged. Therefore, managing the mass transportation of reaction species could control the product generation rates. For example, the desorption of CO becomes easier on a superaerophobic surface than that on a superaerophilic surface due to the poor adhesion strength between bubbles and the superaerophobic surface.140 The facile detachment of CO bubbles can thus enable a higher current density.165 Moreover, the CO2RR was demonstrated to have better resistance to transport limitations than the HER on polished polycrystalline gold.64 This phenomenon implies that the HER can be suppressed by a high-porosity thin film electrode as it can amplify the influence of diffusional gradients, posing severe mass transportation limitation to the HER.
In the CO2RR, the intermediate products near the electrode can act as reactants being reduced further. Thus, proper management of intermediate transportation could be an effective way to tune the final product distribution. For instance, if CO cannot run off quickly, there is a higher chance that CO could further participate in C–C bond coupling by increasing the CO surface coverage.159,166 It has been demonstrated that C2H4 generation can be improved through co-feeding CO2 and CO by combining a CO generation-active catalyst with a catalyst having enhanced capability for C–C coupling.159 For instance, integrating single-atom Ni–N/C with CuOx to build a tandem system can promote C2H4 generation (Fig. 5B),159 in which Ni–N/C functions as a local CO producer and CuOx works for *CO dimerization. Similarly, if C2 products could be preserved near the catalyst surface, the formation of C3 products could be promoted because of the improved C2–C1 coupling. In general, the flow of desorbed products from the catalyst surface to the bulk solution depends on the catalyst's morphology. For example, a flat surface may accelerate the flow of products away from the catalyst surface, while a cavernous electrode may trap the products and increase the possibility to further participate in the CO2RR.167 Therefore, designing a catalyst with a special morphology that can govern the outflow or reservation of intermediates can tune the final product distribution.
4.4 Density of active sites
The overall performance of a catalyst is governed collectively by both the electronic properties of the active components and the number of available active centers.36,168 The former determine the inherent catalytic reactivity (such as selectivity and stability), while the latter governs the total reaction rates, namely the turnover number (TON), which directly reflects the product generation rate in the CO2RR. As aforementioned, tuning the electronic structure is restricted by the linear scaling limitation, which is not the aim of this Review. Fortunately, the number of active sites can be modulated by engineering the topography of electrode materials. It should be noted that only the centers where the reactant/ions can reach them are catalytically effective sites and can contribute to the reaction, while the species that are not accessible to the reactant/ions are “inactive” and will not make a difference to the reaction.
Generally, there are two ways to increase the number of effective active sites. One is to improve the surface area. A large surface area can enhance the dispersion and exposure of active sites throughout the catalyst, such as ultra-thin two-dimensional (2D) materials that have a high surface-to-bulk ratio.169 Another approach is to construct a porous morphology to facilitate the delivery of reactants/ions to active sites. Taking a 1D fiber material as an example, atomically dispersed nickel atoms supported on solid carbon fiber have been demonstrated to exhibit a CO2-to-CO partial current density four times smaller than that of those supported on porous carbon fiber,170 despite the actual amount of nickel on them being almost the same. As for the solid fiber, only the active species anchored on the outermost surface can contact with CO2 and reduce it, whereas the species embedded in the fiber cannot do so due to their inaccessibility. The porous fiber can thus significantly improve the effective number of active sites as the pores improve the accessibility of the catalytic sites to the reactants (Fig. 5C).160 Therefore, a catalyst with a high surface area and porous architecture can build an efficient three-dimensional (3D) electrochemically active interface and significantly enhance the exposure of active sites.
4.5 Enhancement in kinetics
CO2 reduction shows slow kinetics, partially due to the poor mass transportation and multiple electron transfer process. In aqueous conditions, delivering CO2 to the electrode surface at a high flux is challenging because of its low solubility and reactions with the electrolyte.153 Especially under a larger overpotential, where the reaction rate is fast, the mass transportation of CO2 becomes more crucial due to the quick consumption of CO2. As discussed in Section 4.1, using a hydrophobic GDL can efficiently deliver CO2 to the electrode–electrolyte interface, and porous thin films can inhibit the competitive HER kinetics due to the transportation limitation of protons from the bulk electrolyte into the pores. In the case of the electrode being composed of solid spherical powder catalysts, the transportation of CO2 through the electrode surface to internal catalysts is difficult, while hollow porous spherical catalysts can enable efficient transportation as the reactant can pass through the inside of the hollow sphere.139 Two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets tend to stack owing to the strong electrostatic interaction between interlayers, resulting in poor mass delivery; anchoring 2D nanosheets on 1D fibers to reticulate a porous network can enable smooth mass transportation (Fig. 5D).161 On the other hand, fast electron transfer is needed to boost the CO2 kinetics for producing high-order products since multiple electrons are required (Table 1). Using a conductive support to load active materials could be an effective way to do so. It has been shown that employing carbon nanotubes to anchor phthalocyanine (CoPc) can drastically boost the six electron reduction of CO2 to CH3OH thanks to accelerated electron transfer,128 while CoPc alone shows two electron reduction of CO2 to CO. In view of these arguments, building desirable electrode catalysts’ configurations could drastically boost their CO2RR kinetics.
5. Approaches to engineer electrodes and their performance
As stated in the previous sections, the catalyst morphology and electrode–electrolyte boundary play key roles in governing the CO2RR. In this section, we summarized recently developed strategies to fabricate engineered electrode materials and their CO2 reduction performance. Particularly, we focused on constructing favorable three-phase interfaces, engineering the surface wettability, and designing a special local morphology. It should be noted that these aspects have their unique influences in tuning CO2RR behaviors. In the meantime, they have relevance in most cases, governing the CO2RR in a mutual way. As we have discussed the category of catalysts based on products in Section 3, we will not group this section by products. Instead, we will pay much attention to discussing the influences of the modified interface, surface, and morphology on the CO2RR, aiming to find out the activity-determining factors and gain insight into catalytic mechanisms (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Morphology, three-phase interface, and surface wettability impacting CO2 reduction. 
5.1 Constructing favorable three-phase interfaces
The interface at gaseous CO2–solid electrode–liquid electrolyte is at the cornerstone of CO2 electrocatalysis, where CO2 encounters electrons and protons and is reduced. Therefore, the properties of electrochemical interfaces govern CO2RR behaviors to a large extent. Designing an electrode with efficient contact of CO2, H2O, and catalysts could provide opportunities to achieve high accessibility of concentrated CO2 molecules to the catalyst surface while reducing the efficiency of the HER. In this subsection, we will present the advancements of building highly active three-phase boundaries in neutral, alkaline, and electrolyte-free conditions.

5.1.1 Interface under neutral media. 
A neutral electrolyte is one of the most widely used media in CO2 reduction because it can provide the necessary proton source for the CO2RR and suppress the unwanted reaction between OH− and CO2. However, due to the inherent drawbacks of low CO2 solubility and the inevitable HER, the CO2RR under neutral electrolyte suffers low efficiency with poor selectivity and current density. To solve these limitations in neutral solution, Cui et al.135 developed a bilayer pouch-type alveolus-like electrode made of a highly flexible nanoporous polyethylene (nanoPE) membrane covered with a layer of Au catalyst on one side to achieve a sufficient amount of catalytically active sites at the three-phase interface. This design is inspired by the mammalian lung, which is an evolutionary compartment (around 200 μm in diameter) enclosed by many ultrathin waterproof membranes (∼1 μm thick) with enhanced gas diffusibility but low water permeability. The basic working mechanism is that the gas can penetrate the multilayered membranes and be quickly exchanged between the alveoli and blood capillaries, while the liquids stay separated. The configuration of the natural lung is similar to the electrode architecture needed for CO2 reduction where CO2 is expected to be transported quickly while water should be kept away from the electrode to maintain high CO2 concentration near the electrode.
Au/PE was fabricated by rolling the nanoPE membrane with deposited Au nanoparticles (Fig. 7A). Because of the hydrophobic nature of the nanoPE allowing gas diffusion but not water, the central sealed compartment can be separated from the external electrolyte. Therefore, CO2 can diffuse into the pores of the nanoPE and subsequently throughout the whole nanoporous framework to form efficient contact between Au, H2O, and CO2 (Fig. 7B and C), resulting in abundant accessible active sites at the three-phase interface. Another merit of Au/PE is that it allows a high local pH in the interlayer of Au/PE. It was found that the local pH increases from an initial 7 to 9.6 within the first 50 min and then remains stable during a 5 h test, which was attributed to the consumption of protons during the CO2RR and HER processes. Such a high local alkalinity significantly inhibits the HER and promotes CO2 reduction. Regarding the conventional flat electrode, it can only utilize the CO2 dissolved in the electrolyte, leading to an insufficient three-phase interface and low-density of exposed active sites. The direct contact of bulk electrolyte with the flat electrode surface also results in a low-pH environment, which is favorable to the competitive HER.

With these advantages, the bilayer Au/PE exhibited a maximum FE for the reduction of CO2 to CO, reaching 92% at −0.6 V (Fig. 7D), better than those of flat Au/C (60%) and Au/Si (20%). The CO partial currents normalized by the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) on Au/PE are also significantly larger than flat Au/C and Au/Si (Fig. 7E). Because the Au catalysts on these electrodes were prepared using the same magnetron sputtering method, the influence of the electronic structure can be excluded, and the enhanced activity suggests the more active and selective nature of Au/PE's interface as compared to that of the flat electrode. We found that the CO FE and current density of Au/PE (92% and 25.5mAcm−2 at −0.6V) are even better than the reported Au nanorods (60%, 3.7 mAcm−2)99 and mesoporous Au film (78%, 5.7 mAcm−2) under similar testing conditions.64 However, whether this bilayer configuration could be employed to efficiently produce other products needs further investigation, for example replacing Au with Cu51 and SnO2171 for producing C2 and HCOOH products, respectively.


5.1.2 Interface under an alkaline electrolyte. 
An alkaline environment is beneficial to increase the CO2RR selectivity since the reaction rate of the HER can be suppressed in a base solution owing to the sluggish kinetics of the Volmer step in the HER.172,173 However, dissolving CO2 in a strong base solution is not feasible since CO2 will be consumed quickly through the reaction between CO2 and OH−, generating carbonate. Dinh et al.30 achieved CO2 reduction under extremely alkaline conditions in flow cells, in which CO2 is separated from the KOH solution but can penetrate the hydrophobic GDL with a short diffusion length to reach the interface of the Cu catalyst and KOH electrolyte (Fig. 8A). This abrupt interface also provides a feasible way to study the effect of OH− on the CO2RR. They discovered that the CO2RR onset potential shifted positively when increasing the KOH concentration. Notably, CO can be formed at around −0.14 V vs. RHE in 10 M KOH, close to the thermodynamic potential (−0.11 V vs. RHE); the formation of C2H4 took place at −0.165 V vs. RHE, meaning an onset overpotential of 245 mV given that the equilibrium potential for CO2-to-C2H4 is 0.08 V vs. RHE (Table 1). Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, they found that the presence of OH− helps to adsorb the OCCO intermediate from the *CO dimerization on the Cu surface. This is because OH− increases the charge imbalance between carbon atoms in OCCO, which stabilizes OCCO through a stronger dipole attraction. Such a benefit decreases the energy barrier for the *CO dimerization to form C2H4 under a more alkaline condition, supporting their experimental finding that a concentrated KOH solution gives rise to a decreased onset overpotential for C2H4 formation.

In addition, the penetration distance of CO2 into the electrolyte was shorter in a concentrated KOH electrolyte, which facilitates the CO2 diffusion to the interface and thus the electrokinetics of CO2 reduction. Accordingly, high CO2-to-C2H4 performance with an FE of 66%, a total current density of 275 mA cm−2, and an EE of 52% was achieved in 10 M KOH on copper using a traditional carbon-based GDL. However, the stability is poor due to the loss of hydrophobicity of the GDL in 1 hour. The flooded surface blocks the CO2 transfer pathway and decreases the reaction current.
To address the surface hydrophilization, they designed a new electrode by sandwiching Cu catalysts in between polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon nanoparticles (NPs), forming a graphite/carbon NP/Cu/PTFE configuration (Fig. 8B). The hydrophobic PTFE layer could prevent flooding, and the protection effect by the outer carbon NP/graphite layer could stabilize the Cu catalyst and maintain the abrupt reaction interface. With the design, a stable FE of 70% for C2H4 was achieved without decay in 150 h continuous operation. This result is the highest FE and stability reported so far in the reduction of CO2 to C2H4. However, a decrease in the current density from 275 mA cm−2 on the carbon-based GDL to 100 mA cm−2 on the graphite/carbon NP/Cu/PTFE electrode was observed. Further research on designing both high current and stability is highly required.
In another study, Jiao et al.148 applied a highly porous Cu catalyst in an alkaline flow cell (Fig. 8C) to enable efficient mass transportation. The highly porous Cu affords a diffusion pathway facilitating CO2 delivery across the electrode–electrolyte interface, which also promotes the flow of gaseous products away from catalyst surface, leaving a large number of available catalytic sites for CO2 reduction (Fig. 8D). They also studied the influence of the electrolyte (1 M KOH, 1 M KHCO3, 1 M KCl, and 0.5 M K2SO4) on the catalytic CO2RR properties. One role of adding supporting electrolytes is to increase the conductivity of the aqueous electrolyte, which has a positive effect to enhance the total current density because it can help to increase the diffusional flux of ions.28 It was discovered that the electrolyte conductivity follows the order of KOH > KCl > K2SO4 > KHCO3, in good agreement with the tendency of the total current density observed (Fig. 8E). Another role of electrolytes is to tune the pH of the electrolysis environment. The pH near the electrode surface is slightly lower than that of the bulk electrolyte in 1 M KOH owing to the formation of carbonate. By contrast, in non-buffering electrolytes with Cl− and SO42− as anions, the pH near the electrode surface is considerably larger than that of the bulk electrolyte due to the production of a large amount of OH− during high-rate CO2 electrolysis, changing the pH by 4 units. As for KHCO3, there is only a slight increase in the surface pH due to the buffering capability of HCO3− anions. The surface pH thus follows the order of KOH > KCl ∼ K2SO4 > KHCO3, which is approximately consistent with the C2+ product selectivity. The observation agrees with both experimental and theoretical findings reported by Dinh et al.30 that a high near-surface OH− concentration is favorable for C–C coupling. Accordingly, the porous Cu exhibited a high CO2 reduction current density of 653 mA cm−2 with a C2+ product selectivity of 62% at −0.67 V in the KOH electrolyte. Short-term stability working at 653 mA cm−2 for 800 s and 200 mA cm−2 for more than 2 h was also demonstrated (Table 2).
Besides reducing CO2 to C2 products, converting CO2 to CO in an alkaline flow electrolyzer was also demonstrated by Kenis et al.142 showing a high CO production rate of 158 mA cm−2 at a small cell overpotential of 0.94 V with an energy efficiency of 63.8% on an Au catalyst. More notably, a record-high current density of 350 mA cm−2 and an EE of 65% were achieved using 1 M KOH as the electrolyte at a whole cell potential of 3 V on Ag/carbon nanotube catalysts.28 Despite the high efficiency of CO2-to-CO on noble metals, their prohibitive cost and limited reserves preclude massive use. Developing active non-precious CO2RR catalysts is more desirable. Using porous electrodeposited Zn as a low-cost free-standing electrode, Züttel et al.22 achieved high-rate CO2 reduction in the alkaline flow cells, delivering a CO current density of 164 mA cm−2, an FE of 84%, and an EE of 60% at a moderate potential of −0.64 V. In addition, reducing CO2 to HCOOH was also achieved in a flow cell by Li et al.29 exhibiting a high FE of 98% at a current density of 210 mA cm−2 for 13 h at a cathodic potential of −0.58 V on defective bismuth oxide nanotubes.
Despite these exciting advancements achieved in the past few years, it should be noted that achieving high-efficiency stable CO2 reduction at a high current density above 200 mA cm−2 for more than 1000 h still faces great challenges in the alkaline flow cells. One reason is that the accumulation of carbonate salt from the reaction between CO2 and OH− at the electrode–electrolyte interface will block the pores of the GDL,153 causing a gradual decrease in electron conductivity (voltage losses) and inefficient mass transportation. Also, long-term use will lead to the loss of hydrophobicity and thus flooding of the GDL,30 which in turn reduces the capability of the GDL to prevent overladen contact between CO2 and the alkaline electrolyte. Future innovations on engineering the reactor and catalyst are still highly needed to address these issues.


5.1.3 Interface under electrolyte-free conditions. 
In aqueous CO2 reduction, the catholyte plays a key role in serving as a medium to transfer ions. However, using electrolytes leads to a low concentration of CO2 because of poor CO2 solubility in aqueous solution. When applying a large overpotential, hydrogen evolution will also be maximized in aqueous conditions. The best way to circumvent these limitations is to avoid the use of liquid catholytes. In 2015, Lee et al.174 proposed CO2 reduction in fuel cells by directly feeding gaseous CO2 at the cathode. However, the FE towards formic acid was only 5% with a very poor partial current density of less than 0.5 mA cm−2 due to the absence of efficient contact between CO2, catalysts, and protons.
In 2018, Park et al.146 proposed an effective approach to solve the above issues by feeding water vapor with gaseous CO2 to the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at the cathode using a compact fuel cell configuration (Fig. 9A). CO2 functions as a carrier to deliver water vapor, generating a CO2-saturated thin liquid film on the electrode surface. After consuming CO2 in the film during the reduction process, it can be quickly supplemented from the gas stream. The configuration not only achieves an efficient three-phase interface with improved CO2 concentration and mass transfer but also provides an approach to obtain the concentrated liquid product with an extremely small amount of water, which cannot be realized in aqueous CO2 reduction conditions. As a result, a significantly high formic acid concentration of 41.5 g L−1 was achieved under a partial current density of 51.7 mA cm−2, an FE of 93.3%, and an EE of 61% at a low cell voltage of 2.2 V using a commercial Sn catalyst.

Different from flow cells, the cathodic GDE is compressed directly with the ion exchange membrane in fuel cells (Fig. 9B and C), which is conducive to give low ohmic resistance. More importantly, issues associated with the side reaction between the electrolyte and CO2, GDL fouling, and decreased liquid products concentration in flow cells can also be eliminated under an electrolyte-free MEA. Sinton et al.150 systemically compared the performance of flow cells and MEA fuel cells, revealing that the MEA mounted with an anion exchange membrane (AEM) shows higher performance. High FEs of 50% and 80% for C2H4 and C2+ products, respectively, were achieved with an ethylene concentration up to 30% and an ethanol concentration reaching 4 wt% under a high current density of more than 100 mA cm−2 for continuously stable operation of 100 h. However, the system requires a cell voltage of 3.9 V, resulting in a low EE of 18%. Using a similar MEA configuration, high-efficiency conversion of CO2 to CO was achieved using low-cost single atomic Ni supported on commercial carbon black, reaching a current density of 85 mA cm−2, an FE of almost 100%, and an EE of 54% over 20 h continuous operation.143 Note that in an MEA, it is better to use an AEM instead of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) because the latter yields a high proton concentration at the cathode, which increases proton reduction and decreases the CO2 reduction efficiency.
To obtain high-purity liquid products, Wang et al.175 have proposed a combination of a solid-state electrolyte (SSE) with an MEA (Fig. 9D). In the SSE-assisted electrolyzer, the cathode and anode were separated by an AEM and PEM, respectively. In between the two membranes, there is a porous solid ion conductor, which contacts closely with the membrane to transport the ions formed from both the cathode and anode. Humidified CO2 gas is supplied at the cathode and reduced to negatively charged species such as HCOO−, which transports across the AEM to the SSE. Similarly, the protons generated by water oxidation at the anode can move through the PEM to the SSE for compensating the charge simultaneously. At the SSE, the ionic recombination yields high-purity HCOOH, which can be readily collected by washing the SSE with slow water or purging with humidified gas. As a result, the production of 12 M HCOOH with a high FE above 90% was achieved using a bismuth nanosheet catalyst. Employing similar cell design, they also achieved the synthesis of concentrated high-purity hydrogen peroxide solution with a concentration of up to 20 wt%.176 The SSE-enabled electrolyzer presents a promising prototype to produce high-purity liquid products in practical application, and future studies are suggested to further improve the ion conductivity and stability of the solid electrolyte to improve the energy efficiency and durability of the electrosynthetic cell.
In the field of high-rate flow cells or MEA fuel cells, one concern that has been widely ignored is the difference of the CO2 flow rate at the inlet and outlet. Currently, the FEs reported in most GDE-type electrolyzers were calculated based on the inlet CO2 flow, and only a few studies on CO2 reduction to CO employed the outlet flow rate.177,178 Ma et al.179 studied the effects of current density and type of electrolytes on the CO2 flow rate and found that the outlet CO2 flow rate is lower than that of the inlet. Such a situation is much worse at larger current density in the KOH electrolyte due to the quick consumption of CO2 during reduction and severe side reaction with OH−. For instance, the CO2 rate after the electrolyzer is around 34 ml min−1 at 300 mA cm−2 in 5 M KOH, much smaller than that of 45 ml min−1 before the reaction. Such a difference results in the overestimation of FEs when the initial flow rate was employed. Thereby, it is necessary to use the outlet flow rate for accurately calculating FEs in the case of high-rate CO2 electrolysis.

5.2 Surface wettability engineering
CO2 reduction depends strongly on the concentrations of protons and CO2 near the electrode surface, both of which can be tuned by engineering the surface wettability. Thereby, exploring relationships between the surface wettability and CO2RR activity could establish useful design guidelines for developing active and selective electrocatalysts. Buckley et al.141 employed organic modifiers to alter the surface wettability of Cu catalysts and achieved the tuning of the CO2RR selectivity for H2, CO, and HCOOH. It was discovered that protic, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic species could enhance the selectivity for H2, CO, and HCOOH production, respectively. More typically, the hydrocarbon content of organics also affects the selectivity, with a larger hydrocarbon content (e.g., modifier 8 in Fig. 10A) improving the CO selectivity and a lower hydrocarbon content (e.g., modifier 9 in Fig. 10A) improving the formic acid selectivity.

Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society. 
Molecular dynamics simulations show that modifier 9 is well distributed on the Cu surface with enhanced solvation, reticulating a dispersed network and hydrophilic surface with a smaller water contact angle, while modifier 8 tends to assemble into larger clusters on the Cu electrode, forming a hydrophobic surface with a larger contact angle. Accordingly, the water density near the Cu surface decorated by modifier 9 is higher than that adorned by modifier 8 (Fig. 10B), which influences the binding strength of hydride species (M–H) on the Cu surface.180 Specifically, hydride species can be stabilized on 8-modified Cu in comparison with that decorated by 9. A previous study demonstrates that HCOOH formation proceeds through the direct reaction between CO2 and a surface M–H producing HCOO−, followed by the addition of H from H2O.181 Therefore, the weakened M–H species could promote HCOOH generation on a hydrophilic surface, whereas a hydrophobic surface having strong M–H bonds suppresses HCOOH formation and allows dominant CO (Fig. 10C). These findings reveal that the product selectivity is sensitive to the wettability of the catalyst surface, which opens up a new direction to design CO2RR catalysts by appropriately engineering surface hydrophilicity. However, we note that the reported activity is still low. The hydrophobic Cu surface shows an FE of 76%, a partial current density of 0.24 mA cm−2, and an EE of 53% at −0.7 V for CO generation. The hydrophilic Cu surface exhibits an FE of 62%, a partial current density of 1.5 mA cm−2, and an EE of 46% at −0.7 V for HCOOH generation. The reported stability is around 10 hours. More efficient modifiers are expected to be developed to further improve the CO2 reduction performance.
More recently, Wakerley et al.156 designed hierarchical hydrophobic Cu dendrites to trap CO2 at the electrode–electrolyte interface (Fig. 11A) and achieved enhanced selectivity for C2 products. This design was inspired by the plastron, which has hydrophobic hairs to trap air, thereby allowing the spider to breathe underwater. The Cu dendrite electrode was prepared by electrodeposition, followed by submerging the dendritic Cu into liquid 1-octadecanethiol to form an alkanethiol layer with a thickness between 2 and 3 nm (Fig. 11B). With the surface treatment, the wettability of the Cu dendrite was changed from hydrophilicity on the pristine surface to superhydrophobicity on the modified surface with the contact angle increased from 17 to 153° (Fig. 11C and D). 12 hours of stable electrolysis on the hydrophobic dendrites was demonstrated.

CO2 reduction testing shows that the H2 evolution on the hydrophobic surface was slower as compared to that on the pristine wettable counterpart, while the CO2 reduction efficiency was significantly enhanced. Notably, at −30 mA cm−2, the hydrophobic dendrite exhibits an FE of 74% for C2 products, which is comparable to GDL-enabled systems in base media. The authors proposed that, under CO2 reduction conditions, the dendrites can react with either CO2 or H+ to form Cu–COOH* and Cu–H* intermediates at high cathodic potentials.182 The hydrophilic dendrite possessing a large water content around the electrode interface could enable accelerated H+ transportation from the bulk electrolyte to the Cu surface, thus promoting the proportion of Cu–H* groups and H2 formation (Fig. 11E and F). By contrast, the electrolyte is relatively far away from the hydrophobic dendrite, leaving a large space in the pores of hierarchical Cu dendrites to trap CO2 gas for boosting CO2 mass transportation. Thereby, the Cu–COOH* concentration is greatly enhanced, which further yields a high-density distribution of Cu–CO* intermediates after the dissociation of COOH*, accelerates C–C coupling, and increases the efficiency of C2 products (Fig. 11G and H).
Flue gas containing 5–15% v/v CO2 could be a cheap feedstock in application as it is the primary source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels (Fig. 12A).183,184 However, the O2 impurities in flue gas potentially cause a decrease in the CO2RR efficiency since the thermodynamic potential of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is more positive than that of the CO2RR (Fig. 12B).185,186 For instance, at a cell voltage of 2.5 V, 90% of the electrons supplied to the reaction were diverted to the parasitic ORR. To solve the above problem, Sinton et al.149 developed an ionomer-assisted strategy with wettability engineering to selectively impede O2 but allow CO2 transport to the electrode to be reduced on the Cu catalyst. In hydrophobic gas diffusion channels, the gases must undergo degassing from the surrounding solution film before entering the nanopores (Fig. 12C). By contrast, hydrophilic ionomer nanopores can be filled with electrolyte, which can deliver gaseous reactants to reach the catalyst in the dissolved form.

Because of the high volatility of O2, it has a relatively high degassing rate in aqueous media, thus enabling a much higher mass flux in hydrophobic nanopore networks as compared to that in hydrophilic channels. As for CO2, it has low volatility, and the hydrophobicity of nanopores shows an ignorable impact on the CO2 mass flux. Therefore, hydrophilic nanopores were proposed to reduce O2 mass transportation but facilitate CO2 diffusion into the catalyst surface. Experimentally, the modification of copper with hydrophilic ionomers achieved much higher FEs, saving more than 70% FE, and lower missing currents, saving more than 300 mA cm−2 at 3.25 V, as compared to the hydrophobic ionomer-modified ones (Fig. 12D and E). This finding implies that wettability engineering in the supporting layers presents a powerful approach to address the challenges for flue gas. However, whether this concept could be applied to other catalysts and to avoid interference from other impurities (SOx, NOx, and CO) needs further investigation.
In these organic-modified systems, the enhanced CO2 reduction activity and selectivity were mainly attributed to the ionomer-induced surface wettability contribution. Meanwhile, these organic ionomers composed of S, N, or F-containing carbon chains may also potentially bring electronic effects because heteroatom-containing groups may modify the electronic properties of surface Cu atoms. A previous report shows that coating polyethyleneimine (PEI) over N-doped carbon nanotubes can lower the overpotential and increase the selectivity for reducing CO2 to HCOOH as the PEI overlayer serves as a co-catalyst to stabilize the CO2˙− intermediate by H-bond interaction.187 Besides, there are findings showing that incorporating high-electronegativity S and F into N-functionalized carbon can enhance the CO2RR selectivity over the HER because the S- and F-induced charge redistribution could alter the interaction between catalytically active N sites and the *COOH intermediate.137,188,189 Therefore, the use of organic modifiers may impact the adsorption or desorption of CO2RR-generated intermediates by electronic effects. Secondly, reported studies show stability testing of less than 15 hours, far away from practical application. Whether an organic-modified system can last for a few hundred hours remains unknown. One challenge is that the ionomers may be decomposed under a high cell voltage during a long-term period, which is potentially harmful for the lifetime of catalysts. Thirdly, covering organic modifiers on catalysts may block active sites and reduce their accessibility to the electrolytes and reactants. Especially for hydrophobic modifiers, coating them on catalysts has been demonstrated to largely decrease the ECSA due to the poor wettability of the catalyst surface to electrolytes.156 Therefore, the electronic effects, long-term electrochemical stability, and the diminution of accessible active sites for organic-decorated systems need to be considered.
5.3 Morphology-induced activity tuning
The morphological architecture of electrode materials has been identified to be a crucial factor in determining the heterogeneous electrocatalytic performance. The catalyst's morphology could affect the catalytic process on different length scales from the nanoscale and microscale to the macroscale. At the nanoscale, the morphology may affect the local electronic structure, such as facets,123 grain boundaries,180 edges,181 corners,45,46 and surface distortion.47–49 At the microscale to macroscale, modifying the morphology may change the local CO2 concentration,99 adsorption/desorption of species,140,190 pH gradients,136 wettability,191,192 and mass transportation.193,194 As indicated before, nanoscale electronic influences are not the scope of this Review. In this subsection, we will focus on morphology-induced non-electronic contributions to the CO2RR performance. Therefore, we selected model catalysts having similar electronic structures of active sites as much as possible, and we pointed out their possible effects on the apparent performance, if any.

5.3.1 Nanoneedles. 
The poor solubility of CO2 in aqueous solution results in a low concentration of available CO2 surrounding catalysts, impeding the increase in the CO2RR efficiency. An approach to overcome this limitation is to use alkali metal cations with enhanced interactions with adsorbed species.154,195 However, their contributions are limited by the solubility of relevant salts. Applying large electrode potentials has also been demonstrated to be able to improve CO2 adsorption,196 but negative potentials will increase hydrogen evolution. A recent report shows that engineering the electrode morphology presents a viable method to achieve this goal without sacrificing CO2RR selectivity. Sargent et al.99 studied the effects of the Au electrode morphology (needles, rods, and particles) on CO2 reduction and discovered that nanoneedles can significantly enhance the CO2RR performance compared to the others. The contribution was ascribed to the enhanced local electric fields created by the concentrated electrons on the tip electrode (Fig. 13A), which shows an order of needles > rods > particles, as confirmed by Kelvin probe atomic force microscopy (Fig. 13B). Such an electrostatic field increases the density of surface adsorbed K+ ions in the Helmholtz layer around the Au needle (Fig. 13C), which is proposed in turn to increase the local concentration of CO2 through non-covalent interactions. However, there still lacks effective methods to directly measure the local CO2 concentration. With an increase in the local CO2 concentration, the limitation of CO2 transportation to the surface of the Au needle can be significantly diminished. In addition, the locally concentrated electron density also results in an acceleration of charge transfer in the CO2RR, as reflected by the smallest Rct on the Au needle.

The combination of both enhanced mass and charge transfer dominantly boosts the CO2 reduction kinetics on the Au tip, delivering a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec−1, which is much smaller than the 80 mV dec−1 on Au rods and 96 mV dec−1 on Au particles. As for the specific activity, the Au needle delivers an ECSA-normalized CO partial current density 63 times and 122 times larger than that on rods and particles, respectively. Thermodynamically, the adsorbed K+ ions lower the energy barrier for the formation of *COOH, the potential-limiting step in CO2-to-CO on Au, resulting in the positive shift of the onset potential. Accordingly, the Au nanoneedle shows an FE of 95%, a partial current density of 15 mA cm−2, and an EE of 80% at a low overpotential of 240 mV, which is among the highest results reported to date for Au catalysts (Table 2). This suggests that the nanoneedle-induced effect might have a larger contribution to the CO2RR than the modification of the surface composition21 and constructing an efficient three-phase interface135 and porous structure.64 Further, this concept was also successfully confirmed on palladium nanoneedles for reducing CO2 to HCOOH, suggesting its universality. The control experiments, including annealing, etching, surface coating, and plasma treatment, exclude the benefits of the surface faceting and atomic-scale structure to the CO2RR. Thus, it is the morphology that plays key roles in enhancing the CO2RR activity. Future CO2 reduction is suggested to consider the morphological effects if the catalysts used have locally tip-like features.
Besides influencing the local reactant concentrations, a study by Sinton et al.165 revealed that the catalyst morphology can also affect gas transport over a long-range (Fig. 13D). They investigated the CO evolution on Au nanoneedle, nanorod, and nanoparticle surfaces using a dark field microscope, which points to an interesting phenomenon in which CO bubbles on Au nanoneedles show a smaller diameter (23 μm) than that on nanorod (31 μm) and nanoparticle surfaces (97 μm). Due to the small bubble-induced rapid release of CO, the sharper Au needle exhibits a 4-fold larger current density than the nanoparticle counterpart. In another study, Smith et al.197 found that adjusting the length and density of Cu nanoneedles (nanowires, NW) could regulate the local pH. The longer and denser Cu NW arrays can slow down the transportation of HCO3− into the Cu NW arrays and the flow of OH− out of the Cu NW arrays (Fig. 13E), which leads to a high local pH near the Cu NW surface. The enhanced interfacial alkali environment improves the selectivity for generating C2 and C3 products (C2H4, C2H6, C2H5OH, and C3H7OH) via a preferred CO dimerization pathway, whereas shorter and sparser arrays had a low local pH, favoring H2 evolution.


5.3.2 Nanocavities. 
CO2 reduction proceeds through multiple elemental reaction steps, involving different intermediates being generated and consumed. Thereby, the local concentration of intermediates could serve as a parameter to tune the product selectivity, which, however, is difficult to control well. Zhuang et al.167 demonstrated a nanocavity-induced synthesis of C3 alcohol fuels from electrochemical CO reduction. Given that the C3 formation takes place via C–C coupling between C2 and C1 intermediates (Fig. 14A), they proposed that a nanocavity could potentially concentrate C2 species via steric confinement and thereby limit the desorption of C2 intermediates and promote the C–C coupling between C2 and C1 intermediates to increase C3 production (Fig. 14B). Finite-element simulations indicated that the cavity efficiently inhibits the outflow of C2 species produced from CO reduction (Fig. 14C, arrows), resulting in a higher local C2 concentration inside the cavity. Because of the increased surface coverage of C2 intermediates, the chance of the combination of C2 and CO was increased, generating a heightened C3 production rate inside the cavity (Fig. 14D). With the preparation of Cu with the same surface composition but varied morphology of solid, Cavity I (with small cavity opening angles of about 30°), and Cavity II (with large cavity opening angles of about 60°) (Fig. 14E), it was demonstrated that Cavity II shows the highest FE for C3H7OH generation compared to the others (Fig. 14F). The lowest FE of C2H4 on Cavity 2 confirms that C2H4 acts as the intermediate, being transferred into C3H7OH inside of the cavity. Also, the experimental C3/C2 ratio is in good agreement with theoretical simulations (Fig. 14G). Note that although this work focused on CO reduction, it might be applicable for CO2 reduction as CO is a first-order product in the CO2RR. Considering that reducing CO2 into C3 products is more valuable but faces grand challenges, this nanocavity approach may provide a viable route to achieve this goal.

5.3.3 Mesopores. 
Mesopores possess many intriguing features, such as large surface area and continuous porous channels, which could potentially increase the accessibility of active sites and mass transportation for the reactant, intermediates, and products.198–200 These unique properties make mesoporous materials suitable electrodes for electrochemical reactions, such as mesoporous carbon. The existing findings show that pristine carbon is inert toward the CO2RR due to the electroneutrality. Chemical doping is an effective way to transform carbon into active catalysts for CO2 reduction by incorporating heteroatoms (such as N, B, F, and S) to break electroneutrality to create charged sites for the adsorption of CO2RR intermediates. The traditional ways to tune the CO2RR activity of heteroatom-doped carbon rely on tuning the atomic contents, heteroatom type, and dopant configurations.201–203
Remarkedly, Janaky et al.138 discovered that morphological attributes (e.g. porosity and pore size) can influence the CO2 reduction performance of nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) catalysts (Fig. 15A). A sacrificial hard-templating method was used to prepare porous NC having a pore size varying from 13 nm to 27 nm and 90 nm (Fig. 15B), and pore-deficient NC was also prepared without using hard templates as a reference control. The exact synthetic conditions lead to close atomic contents of N atoms, N dopant configurations, carbon graphitization degree, and defects in both porous and pore-deficient NC. This guarantees that the difference in CO2 reduction performance can be mainly attributed to the pore-induced morphological effect. It was found that flat NC is dominated by hydrogen evolution, while porous NC presents significantly higher selectivity and production rates for CO generation. Among them, the CO2 reduction activity follows the sequence of NC-27 > NC-13 > NC-90 (27, 13, and 90 refer to the pore size).

The difference in catalytic behaviors has been attributed to the wettability, CO2 adsorption, exposure of N dopants, and curvature effects, all of which are highly dependent on the porous structure. Firstly, mesopores decrease the surface energy. Mesoporous NC shows a surface energy of 2 mJ m−2, three times smaller than that of the flat surface, generating a more hydrophobic surface on mesoporous NC. This prevents NC from being overflooded, which helps to maintain a high local pH (a low concentration of protons) and thus suppress the HER.135 Secondly, the CO bubble residence time on porous N-C is drastically lower as compared to the nonporous N-C. Both the diameter and stay time decrease with reducing the pore size. The small bubbles, which depart from the electrode surface quickly, can readily expose the fresh surface, leading to a high current density. Thirdly, mesopores could significantly increase the effective number of active sites by exposing N dopants and their accessibility to CO2. Lastly, porous NC exhibited higher CO2 adsorption than flat NC, showing a higher desorption temperature on porous NC relative to that on pore-free NC, as manifested by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) (Fig. 15C). Such an effect was proposed to be from the curved surface-induced strain, which increases the CO2 adsorption strength on porous NC. The effect has also been manifested by computational modeling.204 Besides CO2 adsorption, the importance of curved adsorption sites in the ORR was also observed on NC, suggesting that building pores could be a general method to tune the electrocatalytic behavior of NC materials for broad application. These benefits collectively contribute to the enhanced CO generation on porous NC as compared to the pore-free counterpart. Note that curved pores may also contribute to a higher ratio of edge versus plane locations in comparison with the flat surface, of which N dopants may have various intrinsic reactivity. However, whether the curvature affects the catalytic nature of N dopants remains controversial and yet unresolved.
Generally, NC materials were merely found to produce C2 products because the binding strength of CO on the N dopant sites is too weak to adsorb on NC.137 This leads to the facile desorption of CO from the catalyst surface and reduces the possibility of *CO dimerization, thus permitting enhanced CO selectivity while impeding further transformation into C2+ products. Surprisingly, ordered mesoporous NC was found to be able to generate C2H5OH with high FEs (Fig. 15D). Specifically, Sun et al.134 demonstrated that the ordered mesoporous NC with a cylindrical channel (denoted as c-NC, Fig. 15E) primarily yields C2H5OH in terms of high FEs ranging between 73% and 77% in the potential region of −0.40 to −0.56 V and a negligible FE of CO. Moreover, c-NC exhibited improved stability, maintaining an FE of 77% and an EE of 45% in 24 hours reaction at an overpotential of 0.63 V. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first work achieving such high C2H5OH selectivity on metal-free NC materials, despite the low current density of 0.15 mA cm−2.
The authors also found that the selectivity of C2H5OH depends largely on the shape of the mesopores. The cylindrical c-NC performs better than i-NC, which possesses inverse channels; i-NC shows a larger FE for CO (16%) but a lower FE (44%) for C2H5OH as compared to those of c-NC (Fig. 15F). The superiority of c-NC stems from its unique cylindrical channel configuration, which does much better to transfer electrons than the inverse channels, as manifested by the smaller Rct on c-NC than i-NC (Fig. 15G). Therefore, the transfer of electrons to the active N species of c-NC was dramatically elevated, yielding high-density electrons on the surface of the porous channel over c-NC. Such an electron-rich surface made a considerable contribution in stabilizing the *CO intermediate and inhibiting its desorption to generate gaseous CO, thereby facilitating the dimerization of *CO intermediates into *OC–CO and subsequent multiple PCET processes to generate the *OC–COH intermediate and final C2H5OH on N dopant sites. The pore shape-induced promotion of C2 selectivity paves a visible way to boost the C–C bond formation in the CO2RR. However, how the pore shape influences the mass transportation of intermediates, bubble behaviors, and surface wettability needs to be further investigated, all of which could make a huge difference to the final product distribution, as discussed in the previous sections.
In another study, Ajayan et al.151 reported that nanometer-sized N-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) can electrochemically reduce CO2 into C2H4 and C2H5OH with a total FE of 45% at −0.75 V, whereas N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRGO) with micrometer size cannot do so. The virtue of NGQDs was mainly ascribed to the high density of pyridinic N sites on the edge of NGQDs for facilitating C–C bond formation. Differently, Tan et al.205 found that pyridinic N prefers to reduce CO2 to HCOOH, instead of C2 products. Based on the aforementioned pore-induced selectivity tuning,134 it is possible that graphene size morphological effects could be additional causes accounting for the enhanced C2 selectivity on NGQDs.
In addition to tuning the catalytic selectivity, mesopores can also help to preferentially increase the density of edge-located sites because they can create a large number of edge locations when placing them throughout the 2D plane. In 2D graphene, N dopants mostly accommodate at the basal plane forming graphitic N owing to a high bulk-to-edge ratio;203,206,207 selectively incorporating edge-hosted pyridinic N in graphene is a grand challenge. Pan et al.137 developed N,F-codoped holey carbon layers to load a dense distribution of pyridinic N (NF-HCL) (Fig. 16A). In NF-HCL, the through-plane holes provide abundant edges to preferentially host pyridinic N while suppressing the formation of graphitic N. This was confirmed by N 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. 16B), in which NF-HCL shows an overwhelming percentage of 72% for pyridinic N and a low portion of 23% for graphitic N, while the hole-free N-doped carbon layer (N-CL) shows dominant graphitic N (52%). The dense F-activated pyridinic N endows NF-HCL with a CO FE of 90% at a low overpotential of 490 mV for 40 h without decay, significantly surpassing the pore-deficient N-C counterpart. A similar concept has also been demonstrated on a SnO2 layer for HCOOH generation (Fig. 16C). When mesopores are introduced into the SnO2 layers, the formation of grain boundaries (GBs) between nanoparticles can be improved as mesopores inhibit the growth of large grains (Fig. 16D).208 The close contact between small SnO2 nanoparticles forms dense GBs, giving rise to significantly larger current on mp-SnO2 than Sn foil.

5.3.4 Hierarchical porous nanocages. 
Due to the low solubility of CO2 and poor electron/mass transportation in the CO2 reduction process, the CO2RR commonly has slow kinetics and exhibits poor selectivity and low partial current density at large overpotentials, where the HER heavily competes with the CO2RR. An efficient CO2 reduction catalyst should be engineered to have both highly exposed active sites and fast electron and mass transport. Generally, it is challenging to achieve these requirements in one catalyst. A hierarchical porous morphology could achieve this goal due to the following merits of hierarchical pores. Macropores can provide a high-volume buffer for electrolyte ions, beneficial to shorten the ion diffusion distance; mesopores can serve as diffusion channels for fast mass transport; and micropores can enhance the specific surface area.171,209–211 Ni et al.139 synthesized an F-doped hierarchically porous nanocage (F-CPC) to realize the above-mentioned merits. As shown in Fig. 17A, F-CPC shows a cage-like feature with a mesopore-rich thin carbon shell. Notably, F-HCS achieves a maximum FE of 88%, a high current density of 37 mA cm−2, and an EE of 53% for CO generation at an overpotential of 890 mV (Fig. 17B), much better than those observed on F-doped solid carbon spheres (F-CS), F-doped hollow carbon spheres without mesopores on the carbon shell (F-HCS), and F-doped commercial carbon with irregular pores (F-PC).

The enhanced CO2RR performance was proposed to result from CPS-induced enhancement in CO2 reduction kinetics at large overpotentials. Firstly, F-CPS possesses the highest surface area, which endows F-CPS with the highest ECSA, as manifested by the largest double-layer capacitance (Cdl). Secondly, F-CPS shows fast electron transfer during the CO2RR compared to the others, which was revealed by the lowest Rct value in EIS (Fig. 17C). Thirdly, F-CPC displays an enhanced electric field on the shell of the hierarchically porous nanocage, which induces a high concentration of K+ cations and in turn leads to a high local concentration of CO2 (Fig. 17D). Lastly, the F-CPC electrode has fast mass transport and lower diffusion resistance due to the highly porous networks (Fig. 17E). The diffusion time of CO2 molecules calculated by finite element simulations is 0.63 s on F-CPC, apparently smaller than that of 0.89 s on F-CS and 1.53 s on F-PC. These integrated advantages contribute to accelerating the CO2RR kinetics, as reflected by the lowest Tafel slope on the F-CPC electrode (Fig. 17F). This design could be a guideline to prepare hierarchical porous nanocage copper and SnO2 for further improving their activity to reduce CO2 to C2 and HCOOH products, respectively.


5.3.5 Crystalline porous frameworks. 
Crystalline porous frameworks, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), are one kind of highly ordered crystalline polymers assembled from organic ligands and/or metal nodes via reticular chemistry.212,213 In recent years, they have been emerging catalysts for CO2 reduction thanks to the high manageability to decorate active sites by adjusting ligands or adding functional groups at a molecular level,214–217 which is difficult for other heterogeneous catalysts. However, there is an inherent drawback that COFs/MOFs commonly show low electrical conductivity due to the poor intermolecular electron transmission and/or lack the oriented electron transfer route.
Lan et al.218 proposed an effective approach to surmount this drawback by combining an electron donor and acceptor in one COF based on metalloporphyrin-tetrathiafulvalene COFs (M-TTCOFs) (Fig. 18A). In the system, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), having high electron mobility, serves as the electron donor, and the metalloporphyrin, possessing a conjugated π-electron structure, functions as the electron acceptor and catalytically active site. Integrating TTF with the metalloporphyrin thus constructs a smooth electron transmission pathway from TTF to the metalloporphyrin (Fig. 18B), enhancing the electron transfer efficiency to the active center. It was found that Co-TTCOF shows the highest charge transfer capability with a smaller Rct (23.4 Ω) than Ni-TTCOF (191.5 Ω) and H2-TTCOF (111.9 Ω). This results in more favorable kinetics on Co-TTCOF, showing a smaller Tafel slope of 237 mV dec−1 as compared to Ni-TTCOF (629 mV dec−1) and H2 TTCOF (433 mV dec−1). Note that, although the different intrinsic reactivity between Co and Ni sites may contribute to their performance difference,218 the efficient charge transfer was believed to play a key role in promoting the CO2RR kinetics.

COFs/MOFs, composed of organic molecules with small sizes, mostly have microporosity. In electrocatalysis, micropores are generally not good for the transportation of the reactant to active sites embedded in the bulk of closely packed COFs/MOFs, resulting in a low density of effective active sites. Exfoliation of the original bulk crystals could potentially increase the exposure of catalytic centers and thus their utilization efficiency. In Lan et al.'s work,218 Co-TTCOF was transferred to 2D nanosheets through a high-frequency sonication approach, showing a size of ∼500 nm and a thickness of around 6 nm (Fig. 18C). The exfoliated Co-TTCOF NSs delivered a maximum CO FE of 99.7% (Fig. 18D), higher than the unexfoliated one (91.3%) and reported COFs, such as COF-366-Co (90%),214 COF-366-F-Co (87%),220 and COF-300-AR (80%).221 However, the current density on 2D nanosheets remains unknown, which is suggested to be further investigated to reveal the contribution of 2D sheets in increasing currents as compared to bulk crystals.
MOF-based materials face the same issue as COFs in electrocatalysis. To promote the charge and proton transfer in the CO2RR, Feng et al.219 proposed a synergistic bimetallic conjugated MOF, consisting of copper-phthalocyanine (CuN4) as the ligand and a zinc-bis(dihydroxy) complex (ZnO4) as the linkage. As depicted in Fig. 18E, the ZnO4 complex serves as the catalytic site for the CO2RR while the CuN4 unit boosts the transfer of protons and electrons to ZnO4. Specifically, CuN4 can attract numerous electrons and H2O to produce abundant protons. The transfer of electrons and protons from CuN4 to ZnO4 thus accelerates the protonation of adsorbed CO2 on the ZnO2 site to *COOH. The subsequent PCET-assisted dissociation of *COOH results in the formation of *CO and final gaseous CO. The activity comparisons further show that a smaller charge transfer resistance gives rise to faster reaction kinetics.
Despite these advancements, grand challenges still exist for COFs/MOFs in the CO2RR. Firstly, developing stable COFs/MOFs is imperative.222,223 A report shows that the coordination of Zn2+ (or Co2+ and Cu2+) with 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC) and 2-methylimidazole (HMIM) underwent decomposition at a potential of around −1.0 vs. RHE with the reduction of metal ions to metallic particles in CO2-saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution.223 This raises concerns about the electrochemical stability under large overpotentials. Secondly, hierarchical porous COFs/MOFs with mesopores and/or macropores are recommended to be applied for the CO2RR to further improve the performance because of their premium merits to boost mass transportation that micropores could hardly offer. Many useful approaches to prepare mesoporous and macroporous MOFs have been developed, such as templating and post-treatment (hydrolysis and thermolysis),224 which are welcomed to be employed to prepare hierarchical MOFs/COFs for the CO2RR. Thirdly, the COF/MOF-catalyzed CO2RR is suggested to go further to C2+ products. Currently, COFs/MOFs show high selectivity for C1 products with FEs of more than 90% for CO and HCOOH,214,218,219 while the selectivity for C2+ products is still low, such as an FE of 19% for CH3COOH on Cu2(CuTCPP)225 and an FE of 45% for C2H4 on HKUST-1.226 Morphological engineering could offer a bright future to achieve high selectivity for C2+ products on COFs/MOFs, such as constructing cavities and tuning the pore shape, which have been demonstrated to be able to promote C2 generation on copper and carbon-based catalysts, as discussed in Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3.


5.3.6 Porous thin films. 
Porous thin films have gained much attention in electrocatalytic applications because of the unique free-standing merit that powder materials could not have, which avoids the use of a polymer additive. The initial study using porous thin-film catalysts for the CO2RR focused on Cu foam with hierarchical porosity prepared by the electrodeposition method. Palmore et al.227 found that Cu foam shows a higher FE for HCOOH and lower FEs for CO, CH4, and C2H4 as compared to those on smooth Cu. The catalytic difference was attributed to the exposure of the (211) facet, which shows a low free energy barrier for the formation of HCOO*, a key intermediate to produce HCCOH. In another study, Broekmann et al.147 discovered that Cu foam preferentially produces C2H4 and C2H6 instead of CO, while a flat Cu film has overwhelming CO selectivity. The authors attributed the higher C2 selectivity to the combination of the exposed (100) facet and the trapping of CO inside the pores of Cu foam. The (100) facet has enhanced inherent reactivity for C–C coupling, and the trapped CO increases the CO coverage and in turn promotes *CO dimerization. Note that, in these Cu foam cases, the catalytic performance was governed by both the electronic effect from the exposed facets and the morphological contribution from the pores.
To study the exclusive effect of mass transport at the microscale in a porous thin film for the CO2RR, the films should be engineered to have similar compositions, facets, and surface groups to preclude atomic and/or nano scale electronic structure interference. Surendranath et al.136 prepared a series of Ag inverse opal (Au-IO) films with ordered pores (200 nm size) and various thickness from 1.7 to 6.2 mm (Fig. 19A), which have similar surface electronic properties and are ideal models to explore the effects of the film thickness toward the CO2RR. The electrode roughness (RF), calculated by dividing the ECSA by the geometric area, was employed as an activity descriptor. Note that the values of the ECSA and RF are dependent only on the thickness of the film as the surface composition and pore structure in different thickness films are the same. Thereby, the RF has the same meaning as that of the thickness of the film, and a larger RF represents a thicker film.

Adapted with permission from ref. 228. Copyright 2019 RSC. 
Interestingly, it was discovered that there is a general increase in the CO selectivity (Fig. 19B) and ECSA-normalized currents (Fig. 19C) when gradually increasing the electrode RF from 4 to 105, while the selectivity and specific current for the HER decline. These results demonstrate that adjusting the thickness of porous films can tune the CO2 reduction behaviors. It is noting that a thicker film does have a larger exposed density of active sites, but the enhancement in the ECSA-normalized specific current manifests that the density of active sites is not the reason for the improved activity. The investigation of the susceptibility to mass transportation shows that the HER is highly sensitive to the mass transport limitation than the CO2RR. Different to the flat electrode, the influences of mass transportation in the high-porosity electrode will be amplified due to the convective flow of reagents inside the porous electrode. It was thus postulated that the suppression of the HER upon increasing the thickness resulted from the depletion of the local H+ due to the poor mass transportation from the bulk solution to pores.
Although the observation of film thickness-induced activity modulation is inspiring, it is hard to experimentally measure the actual concentration of CO2 and electrolyte ions inside the pores. Such a situation becomes more complex under real CO2RR conditions as the change of local OH− will lead to a dynamic shift of the equilibria between HCO3− and CO32− in the buffer solution. Theoretical computations can provide information on the mass transport taking place inside the pores at the microscale level. Haussener et al.228 developed a finite element numerical model to predict the concentration of various species involved in the CO2RR on an Au-IO film electrode. The electrode was constructed using the same parameters of Au-IO reported by Surendranath et al. (Fig. 19D).136z = 0 means the bottom of the film and z = t refers to the planar surface of the film. The predicated activity indicates that the CO FEs and current densities increase with increasing RF (thickness), consistent with experimental findings.136 The calculated distribution of species shows that the concentrations of OH− and CO32− in the deepest pores are substantially higher than those towards the bulk electrolyte (Fig. 19E); such a tendency is more obvious in the thicker film. However, the concentrations of both CO2 and HCO3− are not significantly affected by the film thickness because the relatively low reaction rate will not cause the limitation of CO2 transportation. The enhanced OH− provides a favorable reaction environment with a low concentration of H+ suppressing the HER, and the increased local amount of CO32− is also hypothesized to promote CO evolution.229 At present, the correlation between CO32− and CO generation remains not well-understood and needs to be further studied.
From the theoretical predication, one can assume that adding a diffusion layer on the top of Au-IO can boost CO evolution. Note that the additional layer could be inert materials but having the same porosity as the film. This knowledge is very important for practical application from a cost perspective. Nevertheless, the current research is limited to CO-active catalysts, and whether this configuration can be applied to boost C2+ products on Cu-based electrodes needs further investigation. In addition, how exactly the disordered pores could influence CO2RR species in the film electrode is unclear, and the evolution and detachment of bubbles inside of the pores remains unknown too. Moreover, the overall CO2 electrolysis needs to consider the transportation of species between the cathode, anode, membrane, and bulk electrolyte; therefore the macroscale mass transportation behaviors should be further studied to evaluate the porous thin film's benefits at the full electrolysis level.


5.3.7 Other morphologies. 
Nanoparticles (NPs) are one kind of classic catalysts in various catalytic applications because of the high surface-to-volume ratio and tunable surface sites. Previous efforts on tailoring the CO2RR activity of NPs mainly focused on exposing favorable facets and edge/corner sites. In a different way, Cuenya et al.190 investigated the relationship between the interparticle distance of Cu NPs and the CO2RR activity. A short interparticle distance of large Cu NPs was found to play a crucial role in promoting the re-adsorption of CO intermediates from one NP to a neighboring NP and their further reduction to CH4 and C2H4, while small Cu NPs suffer from active-site poisoning by CO. This finding uncovers a general principle to tailor the NP activity via adjusting the distance between NPs.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing high electrical conductivity, have been widely used as catalyst supports to promote electron transfer. Taking cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) as an example, it was theoretically predicted to be a proper catalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CH3OH due to the moderate adsorption of *CO on the Co site, whereas this was scarcely realized experimentally. Surprisingly, anchoring CoPc on carbon nanotubes was demonstrated to render CoPc a good catalyst for reducing CO2 to CH3OH with an FE of 40% and a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at −0.94 vs. RHE in aqueous solution (Fig. 20A).128 Because of the inert nature of pristine CNTs, the enhanced activity was primarily ascribed to the benefit of highly conductive CNTs, which enables fast and continuous electron transfer to the active Co site and boosts the multiple electron reduction of *CO into CH3OH.
The material surface wettability can also be adjusted by engineering the architecture. Vertically aligned carbon fiber arrays were found to show a superaerophobic surface.140 As depicted in Fig. 20B, supporting atomically dispersed Ni on aligned carbon fiber (H-CPs) shows a gas contact angle of around 148.3° under water, implying a superaerophobic property. This results in the generation of small CO bubbles and their facile detachment. By contrast, randomly distributed carbon fiber supported single-atom Ni (Ni SAs/CFPs) gives a gas contact angle of 116.1°, which is detrimental to the desorption of CO due to the gas accumulation to large bubbles. The benefit endows H-CPs with a CO current density more than three times larger than that of H-CPs at −0.9 V vs. RHE.

6. Summary and perspectives
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 into fuels and chemicals offers a promising route to mitigate global warming and energy crises caused by the extensive combustion of fossil fuels. The realization of efficient CO2 electroreduction relies on the exploration of CO2RR mechanisms and the development of advanced electrode materials and electrolyzers. Although modifying catalysts’ electronic properties of catalytically active sites has been widely employed to regulate the CO2RR performance, the linear scaling relation limits catalyst refinement to achieve the expected performance before it can be broken. Alternatively, the CO2RR is largely susceptible to the local microenvironment. In this Review, we provide fundamental interpretation, design principles, and recent advancements on fabricating electrode catalysts toward the CO2RR via tailoring their local morphology, surface hydrophobicity, and three-phase boundary. Despite the fruitful progress that has been made, there still exist grand challenges, requiring extensive efforts to further explore this new frontier to boost the practical implementation in CO2 electrolysis technology. Next, we will discuss the remaining challenges and recommend potential strategies in this research topic.
(1) Uncover fundamental mechanisms. Understanding CO2RR mechanisms could provide useful guidelines to design highly active and selective catalysts. However, the current knowledge remains ambiguous and under debate. For example, is CO2 directly reduced or do bicarbonate anions serve as the dominant source?230,231 What is the exact role of metallic Cu and positively charged Cu in the C–C bond formation and hydrogenation process? What are the catalytically active sites of heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts (dopants or defects)? The main experimental method used to explore CO2RR mechanisms is the ex situ characterization of catalysts before and after CO2 reduction (TEM, XAS, XPS, etc.). These ex situ approaches cannot catch important information in the real CO2RR process, during which surface reconstruction, morphological transformation, and active site evolution/annihilation usually happen.27,232–235Operando studies and isotopic labeling could catch exact changes in catalyst compositions, adsorbed intermediates, and reactant sources in the CO2RR. Despite the fact that advances in using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy,24,235 infrared spectroscopy,236 and isotopic labeling231 have been achieved, their use is still limited. It is highly desirable to employ in situ characterization tools to probe CO2RR mechanisms in future research.
(2) Design special morphologies for C2+ products. Compared to C1 products, C2+ hydrocarbons (e.g. ethylene and propane) and oxygenates (e.g. ethanol, propanol, acetate, and acetone) are more valuable due to their high energy density. As highlighted in this Review, morphology engineering can help C2+ generation, such as Cu nanocavities for propanol,167 ordered mesoporous carbon for ethanol,134 and hierarchical Cu dendrites with a superhydrophobic surface for C2H4.156 However, the current performance is still not satisfactory, which urges researchers to design advanced architecture electrodes for target products. Tandem catalysts could be promising models to achieve this goal, in which different morphologies can be assembled with special sequences and geometric configurations to facilitate intermediate reactions. For instance, catalysts with high CO2-to-CO activity can be coupled with Cu nanocavities to boost the C–C bond formation by feeding more CO at the local Cu surface. Similarly, catalysts with enhanced capability of hydrogenation and oxygenation can be assembled sequentially with Cu nanocavities to boost the generation of hydrocarbons and oxygenates, respectively.
(3) Improve the catalyst stability. Besides activity and selectivity, stability is another important descriptor determining the feasibility in practical application. Presently, most of the CO2RR catalysts cannot maintain their initial activities for more than 200 h (Table 2), which is far away from application requirements (>1000 h at a high current density of more than 200 mA cm−2).33 The catalyst deactivation mainly originates from surface reduction/reconstruction, intermediate poisoning, and dissolution/aggregation of active components. The following situations may happen under harsh CO2RR conditions at negative potentials, including the reduction of positively charged Cuδ+ to Cu0 in copper-based catalysts,9 the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ in Fe–N/C,24 the decomposition of MOFs/COFs,223 the protonation of pyridinic N,237 and the degradation of organic modifiers. Anchoring the active components on appropriate supports could be a solution to resolve these problems. With enhanced electronic interaction between active components and supports, the chemical states of active components could be retained with improved intrinsic reactivity. Core–shell architectures with active components as the core and stable protecting layers as the shell could also be promising, in which the shell will not reduce the reactivity of the core catalyst but provide a stabilizing effect to prevent it from being damaged and leached.
(4) Multiscale computational modeling. Theoretical computation is a powerful tool to unveil catalytic mechanisms and predict efficient catalysts. Currently, DFT computation of the CO2RR mainly relies on thermodynamic predictions, such as onset potentials, intermediate adsorption, and Gibbs free energy. The existing experimental findings demonstrate that the electrode topography, pH, and metal ion/solvent types and contents at the electrode–electrolyte interface can considerably impact the distribution of intermediates and their interaction with the electrode surface, as well as mass transportation of intermediates and products. These aspects, however, have been largely overlooked. To gain better insight into the CO2RR from a simulation perspective, future studies are encouraged to develop multiscale computation methods, in which the influences of the morphology, solvents, and mass transportation can be considered collectively. In addition, electrokinetic modeling is welcomed to study the relationship between the reaction current and type/coverage degree of active moieties at varied potentials. Multiscale modeling can help to explain some unusual phenomena (e.g., morphology-dependent selectivity) and offer comprehensive guidance for electrode material refinements, electrolyte selection, and electrode–solution interface design.
(5) Integrate morphological and electronic benefits in one catalyst system. Although the catalyst electronic structure is not the focus of this Review, it plays very important roles in the CO2RR. Appropriate modification of the electronic properties of active components (e.g. edges, corners, terraces, interstices, facets, strain, alloying, and doping) could tune the CO2RR activity through adjusting the adsorption/desorption of intermediates. Thereby, it is expected that combining morphology and electronic merits in one system could build advanced catalysts for targeted products. For example, copper selenide has high selectivity for C1 methanol production due to its favorable adsorption of *CHO,167 and the nanocavity morphology can promote C–C coupling.156,167 There is a high chance that constructing copper selenide nanocavities can improve the selectivity for C2 ethanol and C3 propanol production because they could possess the capability of both the adsorption of *CHO intermediates and *CO–*CHO coupling. Following this idea, there exists huge room to design unique catalysts for targeted products by combining suitable active components with desirable morphology.
(6) Design advanced electrolyzers. In addition to catalysts, whether CO2 electro-conversion can be successfully commercialized at a large scale depends strongly on the design of advanced reactors that are capable of achieving the high-rate production of pure products with high energy conversion efficiency. While H-type cells in aqueous media are widely used to investigate catalytic mechanisms, the current density is largely limited by the poor solubility of CO2. GDE-assisted flow cells and fuel cells can efficiently deliver CO2 to the electrode surface and thus are able to reduce CO2 at an industrial current. However, the flooding and clogging of the GDL need to be solved for long-term use. Instead of using modifiers that commonly undergo degradation, constructing a morphology-induced hydrophobic GDL could sustain surface hydrophobicity. In addition, designing reactors capable of producing high-purity products with controllable concentrations is urgently needed for facile and cost-effective operation. SSE-enabled electrolyzers have shown promise to directly produce high-purity liquids.175 As compared to liquid products, the synthesis of high-purity gaseous products is more challenging as the mixture of gas-phase products and unreacted CO2 cannot be fully avoided. Using a membrane-based separation setup to recycle CO2 may overcome this issue if the cost can be reduced to an acceptable level.

Broader context
Producing value-added fuels and chemicals from CO2 using electrochemical approaches is a promising way to recycle greenhouse gases and mitigate the dependence on fossil fuels. However, scaling up this technology to industry-level faces grand challenges due to the lack of highly active, stable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). While engineering the electronic structure of catalysts to tune the CO2RR behaviors has been investigated for decades, the linear scaling relation of the adsorption with multiple intermediates limits its applicability in regulating the CO2RR for generating the desired products. Thanks to the high dependence of the CO2RR on the local environment and mass transportation near the gas–solid–liquid interface, modulating the morphology and interface properties presents an effective strategy to regulate CO2 reduction. These modifications are not only insusceptible to linear scaling relation but also possess high resistance to harsh reaction conditions, showing great promise to achieve high-efficiency CO2 conversion. In this Review, we summarize the most recent achievements in tuning the CO2RR through engineering electrode catalysts’ morphology, surface wettability, and three-phase interface. We provide the design principles and review typical approaches to fabricate engineered electrodes. Particularly, we discuss the relationship between the electrode properties and CO2RR performance to gain insight into the activity-governing parameters and catalytic mechanisms. Finally, we propose strategies to guide the further design of advanced electrode materials. We hope that this Review could increase researcher's attention on this emerging direction and inspire more innovative strategies to propel the practical implementation of CO2 electroconversion and other electrocatalysis-related technologies.
