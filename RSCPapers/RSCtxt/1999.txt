    , Accepted 5th March 2019First published on 6th March 2019AbstractSolar light-induced photodecomposition of organophosphorus warfare agent simulant dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) on the surfaces of TiO2/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites was studied by in situ DRIFT spectroscopy. Nanocomposites containing 1 and 2 wt% GO, respectively, were prepared by two different aqueous methods. All nanocomposites were shown to effectively adsorb and partly dissociate DMMP as shown by the formation of surface coordinated methoxy groups. Solar light illumination induced rapid decomposition of the adsorbed species to yield various ionic and surface coordinated formate and carbonate species as the main intermediate products. Both the kinetics of adsorbed species decomposition and the formation of various intermediates were strongly affected by the presence of GO, as compared to pure TiO2 nanoparticles. The two synthesis routes yielded nanocomposites with different degrees of reduction of GO that correlated with their reactivity towards DMMP adsorption and photodegradation. Upon illumination, rapid depletion of water was observed on the TiO2/GO nanocomposites and was attributed to a water splitting reaction, which competed with the DMMP photo-oxidation reaction.
1. Introduction
Organophosphates (OPs), both biogenic and xenobiotic compounds containing stable C–P bonds, belong to the most efficient and widespread pesticides; they find use in the chemical industry as plasticizers, additives, or solvents, and in pharmacy as anthelmintics.1 Regretfully, the lethal toxicity of some OPs2 has led to the development of some of the most dangerous civil warfare agents (CWAs) mankind has invented, such as soman, sarin, tabun, or agent VX. Despite their (almost) globally accepted ban by the Chemical Weapons Convention which entered into force in 1997, these CWAs still pose a threat.3 Means to rapidly and effectively decompose CWAs, as well as other less toxic OPs, and also demands for control of their fate in the environment, e.g. their occurrence in natural waters, remain an important issue.4,5
Using reactive adsorbents that strongly interact with toxic gases or dispersed liquids is one of the most straightforward methods for OP decontamination. Various materials based on metal (hydr)oxides, zeolites,6 polyoxometalates,7,8 or metal–organic frameworks9–11 have shown feasibility to adsorb and degrade CWAs, their corresponding simulant agents, or pesticides. Nano-sized metal (hydr)oxides, such as TiO2,12–14 iron (hydr)oxides,15–18 MgO,19 MnO2,20 CeO2,21–23 Zr(OH)4,24,25 and ZnO,26 are by far the most studied decontaminants, because they are relatively cheap and easy to prepare on a large scale. Their reactivity stems from an abundance of highly reactive defect sites, edges and corners or high-energy lattice planes and high surface to volume ratios.27 OP decontamination proceeds on the adsorbent surface by strong interaction of the phosphoryl oxygen in the OP molecules with Lewis acid-type low-coordinated metal cations, or surface hydroxyl groups, and subsequent partial hydrolysis of the molecules that yields less toxic products.12,28,29
Even faster and complete degradation of OP compounds may be achieved by photo-induced degradation (PID) of the adsorbed OP using a suitable photocatalyst. It has been reported that the efficiency of the most popular photocatalyst TiO2 can be improved by modifying its structural, electronic, optical, or other properties by precise design of TiO2 nanostructures,30,31 deposition of co-catalyst noble metals on the TiO2 surface, and utilization of plasmon resonance effects,32 formation of heterojunctions with other suitable photocatalysts,33 or coupling with carbon nanostructures.34 2D nanosheets of graphene or graphene oxide (GO) have been used to prepare TiO2-based composites, which are reported to exhibit enhanced efficiency due to their improved light absorption, larger surface area, and better charge carrier separation.35–37
We have previously developed two undemanding methods suitable for large-scale synthesis of TiO2/GO nanocomposites, which do not make use of organometallic titanium precursors and proceed under ambient pressure and at low temperature (<100 °C) with water as the only solvent.35,38 The morphology, surface area, porosity and adsorption characteristics of both pure TiO2 and TiO2/GO composites prepared by these two methods are substantially different due to various Ti precursors used, reaction times, capping agents employed, and reaction mechanisms that generate TiO2 nanoparticles. Specifically, in homogeneous precipitation of TiOSO4 water solution, urea thermal decomposition gradually changes the pH of the reaction solution which causes TiO2 precipitation (reaction time ∼6 h). At the same time urea acts as a capping agent that controls the growth of the particles. In the presence of GO, the very small particles (up to 10 nm) form a compact surface layer on GO sheets in TiO2/GO composites. In contrast, in the second procedure, refluxing of a water-soluble Ti peroxo complex leads to slow condensation and precipitation of TiO2. A substantially longer reaction time (∼36 h) without any capping agent allows for formation of highly-crystalline monodispersed spindle-like particles (up to 100 nm) that are finely dispersed among the GO sheets in TiO2/GO composites.
As we have reported,45 the different reaction conditions in both synthesis procedures influence the physicochemical properties of the GO in the resulting composites. The urea-prepared samples maintained a brownish color similar to the pristine GO, whereas the peroxo complex samples became dark grey after synthesis, which implied a larger degree of reduction of GO sheets in the latter composites. This assumption was further supported by Raman investigation of the intensity ratio of the G and 2D bands (IG/I2D) of GO in the TiO2/GO composites. A higher reduction of GO in the samples should consequently not only lead to a higher charge carrier mobility48–50 but also change the hydrophilic pristine GO to a more hydrophobic reduced GO (rGO). This may also explain the specific surface area (SSA) improvement in the urea-prepared samples (from 236 for pure TiO2 to 297 and 263 m2 g−1 for composites with 1 and 2 wt% GO, respectively) where less reduced GO was finely dispersed in the composites and improved their texture. In contrast, in the peroxo-derived samples the reduction of GO during synthesis changed its interaction with water to become more hydrophobic, which is typical for rGO. As a consequence, this leads to lower dispersion in water (used as a solvent), collapse of the individual sheets, and reduction of SSA (from 128 for pure TiO2 to 74 and 89 m2 g−1 for composites with 1 and 2 wt% GO, respectively).
Mechanistic studies of DMMP degradation using both theoretical39 and experimental methodologies, mainly on commercially available TiO2 (such as P25),40 emphasize the role of the surface structure,41 surface humidity and hydroxylation,13,14,42 OP surface coverage,43 and temperature,12,44 in the adsorption and (photo)degradation, and it is therefore important to perform experiments in controlled environments with well-defined catalysts with possibility to systematically vary their physicochemical properties. The in situ DRIFT spectroscopy study of DMMP adsorption under carefully controlled conditions (atmosphere, temperature, reactant concentration) revealed that GO addition enhanced the reactive dissociation of DMMP molecules on both types of composites.45 Specifically, we have observed enhanced formation of several reaction products such as Ti-coordinated methoxy groups cleaved from DMMP molecules and differently coordinated formate species. Importantly, the relative amount of adsorbed DMMP was four and two times larger on urea-prepared TiO2/GO composites with 1 and 2 wt% GO, respectively, compared with pure TiO2. Meanwhile only a slight increase of adsorption capacity was observed on TiO2/GO composites prepared by the peroxo complex method (1.4 and 1.6 times higher for samples with 1 and 2 wt% GO as compared with pure TiO2). This phenomenon was ascribed to the different degrees of reduction of GO in both composites, which yielded different concentrations of oxygen containing groups and surface charges and caused markedly different properties for DMMP adsorption. But in general, all the peroxo-derived samples had a better adsorption capacity than the urea-prepared composites, taking into account their three times lower SSA. This is probably due to their broader pore size distribution and higher pore volumes related to the synthesis procedure employed rather than to the effect of GO.
Here we have employed solar light illumination of both pure TiO2 and TiO2/GO nanocomposites with markedly different structures and morphologies to induce further decomposition of pre-adsorbed DMMP and its thermal degradation products on their surfaces. Special attention was paid to elucidation of the degradation mechanism and kinetics, as well as to the state of GO before and after illumination. The different GO reduction states are expected to have a major influence on the photoinduced decomposition (PID) of DMMP, where the redox and charge transfer properties of GO are important factors for the photocatalytic process. Both the kinetics and the formation of degradation products were strongly affected by the reduction state of GO in the nanocomposites.
2. Experimental section
2.1. TiO2/graphene oxide (GO) composite synthesis
TiO2/GO nanocomposites were prepared by undemanding and energy-efficient synthesis methods, amenable to up-scaling, as described in detail elsewhere.45 Briefly, the common industrial titanium precursor, titanyl oxysulfate (TiOSO4), was employed as a Ti precursor using water as a solvent and reacted at low temperature (up to 100 °C) and ambient pressure. Two methods using two different reducing agents were employed: (i) homogeneous precipitation of TiO2 on GO with urea and (ii) refluxing of a Ti peroxo complex with GO. Each method yielded 1 and 2 wt% GO. GO was prepared by our original procedure,46 which was based on high-power ultrasonication of natural graphite followed by oxidation using a modified Hummers method. The samples prepared by the peroxo complex and urea routes, respectively, were denoted with “P” and “U”.
2.2. Material characterization
The prepared composites were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy, SEM (FEI Nova NanoSEM 450), and transmission electron microscopy, TEM (FEI Talos). A Renishaw inVia Raman confocal microscope with a 532 nm excitation laser and neutral density filters (0.5% transmission) was employed for Raman spectroscopy, and a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer equipped with an integration sphere and with BaSO4 as a reference standard was used to measure the diffuse reflectance spectra of the powder samples. The absorbance was calculated from the diffuse reflectance using the Kubelka–Munk formula.
2.3. 
          In situ DRIFT spectroscopy
Adsorption and PID of DMMP on the TiO2/GO nanocomposites were investigated by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) using an experimental setup (Scheme 1) described elsewhere.29,47
 Scheme 1  
In situ DRIFTS experimental setup. 
Briefly, a vacuum-pumped FTIR spectrometer (Vertex 80v, Bruker, Germany) equipped with a modified high-pressure, high-temperature DRIFTS reaction cell (Praying Mantis High Temperature Reaction Chamber, Harrick Scientific, USA) is connected to a gas-supply system with a carefully regulated gas flow by using a set of mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst, Netherlands). This setup allows for combined DRIFTS measurements with gas dosing and photon irradiation of the sample under controlled conditions.
In our experiments, synthetic air (Alphagaz 1, Air Liquide, purity 99.999%) was used with a flow rate of 100 ml min−1 through the sample cell, which was kept at 25 ± 0.5 °C. Over the dosing period (15 min), the synthetic air flow can be passed over the liquid DMMP (97% GC purity, Sigma-Aldrich) reservoir kept at 62 ± 0.2 °C, which resulted in a steady state concentration of 9.9 μg min−1 of DMMP. The DRIFTS cell was then flushed with the pure synthetic air for 15 min before the start of illumination which was kept at a flow rate of 100 ml min−1 during the experiment. Simulated solar light was generated using a high-pressure xenon arc lamp (Oriel Instruments, USA) operated at 300 W with AM1.5 filters (Newport, USA). The light was directed to the DRIFTS cell via a quartz fiber bundle. To reduce sample heating, the infrared part of the light was removed by using a 54 mm long water filter (Oriel Instrument, USA). The output photon power, taking into account the absorption efficiency of the detector (96%) and the UV transmission through the cell window (92%), was 135 mW cm−2 in the wavelength region of 200 < λ < 800 nm, and 15.7 mW cm−2 for 200 < λ < 390 nm (corresponding roughly to the optical bandgap of anatase TiO2) as measured using a thermopile detector (Ophir, Israel).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Pre-adsorbed DMMP and its thermal decomposition on TiO2/GO composites
DMMP adsorption at room temperature on pre-dried TiO2/GO composites prepared by the urea method (Fig. 1a–c) and via the Ti peroxo complex method (Fig. 1d–f) is realized through DMMP interaction with isolated surface hydroxyl groups and undercoordinated Ti metal cationic sites. This leads to partial dissociation of DMMP molecules as documented mainly by i) cleaving one of the DMMP methoxy groups that can be re-adsorbed on available surface cationic sites and ii) formation of differently coordinated formate species. The pre-adsorbed DMMP gas on the composites prepared by the urea and Ti peroxo complex methods under the dark conditions corresponds to the blue spectra (Time 0) in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. The assignment of the most prominent bands can be seen in Table 1. Detailed description of the DMMP adsorption and thermal decomposition is available in our previous study.45

3.2. Photo-induced decomposition of DMMP

3.2.1. Urea samples. 
Simulated solar light illumination leads to a rapid decrease of the DMMP-related IR bands as a function of illumination time on the TiO2/GO-U samples (Fig. 2a–f), while new bands of intermediate species appear in the DRIFT spectra. This provides clear evidence of the high photoactivity of the nanocomposites. Photo-oxidation of both the methyl and the methoxy groups, indicated by their fast disappearance (Fig. 2a, c and e insets), is expected to result in surface adsorbed intermediates such as formic acid, formate ions, carbonates, and water, as well as gaseous CO2 and water.29,40,43 The new band which appeared at 2871 cm−1 increased in intensity during the PID and interfered with the decreasing νs(CH3O) band of DMMP (at 2858 cm−1) resulting in an apparent shift of the peak to higher wavenumbers. This new band (together with the corresponding O–C–O bands appearing in the fingerprint region between 1350 and 1600 cm−1), whose intensity decreases after prolonged illumination time, is attributed to formate which is reported to be a key intermediate species formed during PID of DMMP,29 as discussed further below. Detailed inspection of the IR spectra also reveals that the adsorption structures of the intermediate species, ionic or surface coordinated, are strongly dependent on the surface structure of the photocatalyst.51
In the frequency region of the OH groups, a progressive decrease of the negative bands of the isolated Ti–OH groups was observed in pure TiO2-U (Fig. 2a). This may be explained by the consumption of the OH groups by self-association due to the water produced during the PID reaction, which is corroborated by the concomitant increase of the broad combinatory bands related to hydrogen bonded OH groups and water between 3600 and 3400 cm−1.
In the fingerprint region of pure TiO2 (Fig. 2b), several new bands appear upon illumination at 1675 cm−1, 1611 cm−1, 1582 cm−1, 1288 cm−1, and 1251 cm−1, and a broad absorption band between 1550 and 1350 cm−1 that overlaps with a broad negative band due to interaction with trace amounts of urea residues.56 Simultaneously, the vibrational bands due to DMMP decrease. As mentioned above, the dissociation of DMMP yields mainly formic acid and coordinated formate species. The weak band at 1675 cm−1, which lies in the region where carbonyl group vibrations are expected, may be assigned to the ν(CO) stretching of molecularly adsorbed formic acid.52 The broad band at 1611 cm−1 can be attributed to a superposition of the scissoring δ(H–O–H) of water produced during PID and νa(O–C–O) vibration of formic acid and formate species. In particular, the strong band at 1582 cm−1 and the shoulder at 1551 cm−1 are typical for the νa(O–C–O) vibration due to surface HCOO− ions and bridge-bonded bidentate formate (μ-formate), respectively.54,55
Several explanations exist for the bands at 1288 and 1251 cm−1. A vibration peak, similar to the band at 1288 cm−1, was observed by Rusu and Yates,43 and they ascribed it to the ν(PO) stretching mode of a “free” PO group as the P was retained on the surface after photooxidation. On the other hand, since the band intensity increased in the later stage of PID, it can be ascribed to either i) carbonate bidentate species that were previously identified57 upon CO adsorption at 1243 and 1670 cm−1 or ii) carboxylates (CO2−) reported to occur at 1251 and 1670 cm−1,53 or iii) monodentate bicarbonate assigned based on a combined DFT/FTIR study.58 Either way, it would also explain the simultaneously appearing band at 1675 cm−1 in the spectra. We therefore reassign this band as being due to a C–O stretching band in a carbonate or carboxylate decomposition product that is formed on the nanocomposite. Even though the overall IR spectra suggest that DMMP mainly adsorbs on TiO2 sites, significant differences are observed in the spectra of the TiO2/GO-U nanocomposites compared to pure TiO2-U (Fig. 2c–f). First, a larger concentration of non-dissociated DMMP is observed on the TiO2/GO composites (Table 2). However, the DMMP related bands decrease much more rapidly on the nanocomposites. Whereas on pure TiO2-U a large amount of ionic HCOO− with a dominant νa(O–C–O) band at 1581 cm−1 is formed, bridge-bonded bidentate (associated with the 1554 cm−1, 1378 cm−1 and 1351 cm−1 bands, respectively, due to νa(O–C–O), δ(CH), and νs(O–C–O) vibrational modes) prevails on the surface of the composites. This suggests that less water molecules are present on the surface of the nanocomposites.

In the spectra of the sample with 1 wt% GO (Fig. 2d), a broad combinatory band evolved in the region of 1170–1090 cm−1. A variety of single-bonded P–Ox species formed in this region by conversion of the coordinated PO species associated with the bands at 1213 and 1234 cm−1.14,40 An additional sharp band at 1601 cm−1 appeared in the spectra of the sample with 2 wt% GO in the later stage of PID. A similar value (1598 cm−1) was assigned to ν(C–O) in bidentate carbonate species,59 and suggested complete mineralization of DMMP.
In the composites, the isolated surface hydroxyls are replenished during PID (as indicated by the gradual disappearance of the two negative peaks in the 3650–3750 cm−1 region in Fig. 2e). This suggests that their release is related to dissociation of the DMMP molecules and desorption of reaction products.
The enhanced photodegradation rate on the nanocomposites is consistent with previous reports,36 and has been explained as being due to improved electron–hole pair separation at the TiO2/GO interface36,60 and enhanced mobility of charge carriers, whereby photo-excited electrons are efficiently transferred from the conduction band of TiO2 to the reduced graphene oxide.
Interestingly, the bands associated with adsorbed water (the broad band at 3400 cm−1 and a related band around 1640 cm−1) rapidly decreased in the first minutes of PID, in stark contrast to pure TiO2-U (See Fig. 2a). On the other hand, water molecules also serve as photoelectron acceptors leading to the formation of hydroxyl radicals ˙OH. Thus, the decrease of the water ν(H–O–H) bands and the concomitant increase of OH bands suggest that more water is consumed during PID on the TiO2/GO composites than on pure TiO2. The observed loss of water suggests that the TiO2/GO system enhances a hydrolysis reaction pathway, either by splitting of water or by condensation of DMMP molecules. The latter is however not evidenced by the DRIFTS data, i.e. larger DMMP-derived condensation products are formed on the surface. Thus, we infer that the abundance of photoelectrons may promote the water splitting reaction, yielding higher production of ˙OH radicals, consistent with the IR data. Note that the samples were pre-dried at 300 °C, and the working environment can be considered as water-deficient. Ergo, the rapid decrease of the bands related to water can be explained by a higher rate of water splitting than complete DMMP photo-oxidation (that yields water). It is noteworthy that this effect was enhanced at higher GO concentration (2 wt% GO), and it was observed regardless of the synthesis procedure (as will be seen in the next section), and hence it can be related exclusively to the presence and amount of GO.


3.2.2. Ti peroxo complex samples. 
As in the case of the urea samples, simulated solar illumination of DMMP adsorbed on the TiO2/GO-P samples induces a rapid decrease of ν(C–H), ν(PO) and ν(O–P–O) bands associated with DMMP (Fig. 3).
In more detail, the methyl bands are decomposed faster than the methoxy bands and occur faster than those on the urea samples. The formation of surface coordinated formate species causes, similar to the urea samples, broadening and shifting of the νs(CH3O) band of DMMP (at 2858 cm−1).
Similar to TiO2/GO-U the overall IR spectra suggest that DMMP mainly adsorbs on TiO2 sites, but the fact that significant spectral differences are discernible points to very different degradation mechanisms.
In the fingerprint region, a decrease of all bands associated with DMMP can be seen as it dissociates upon irradiation. New bands due to the νa(O–C–O), δ(HC), and νs(O–C–O) vibrations of bridge-bonded bidentate formate appear at 1551, 1379, and 1361 cm−1. In contrast to the urea samples, the formate band related to ionic HCOO−, typically seen around ∼1580 cm−1, was not seen in the spectra of any of the TiO2/GO-P samples, which suggested that their surfaces contained substantially less water than the urea-derived samples.
Two additional bands at 1715 and 1675 cm−1 were present in the spectra of pure TiO2 (Fig. 3b). The former can be assigned to adsorbed formaldehyde,61 but it is also a characteristic band for bent CO2− molecules reported in several previous studies54,62 and carbonate species (which appear together with a weak band at 1245 cm−1, which, however, is not seen in our spectra, therefore ruling out carbonate). The 1675 cm−1 peak can be assigned to a ν(CO) mode due to the formation of monodentate coordinated formic acid. In the region below 1200 cm−1, vibrations originating from P–Ox species that are formed by photo-induced re-arrangement of the PO moiety can be seen. This suggests that the remaining part of the DMMP molecule that contains the phosphorus atom remains on the surface of the composites. Close inspection of Fig. 3b reveals that this is also true for the pure titania sample, TiO2-P, although the signal-to-noise ratio becomes low below 1200 cm−1 due to IR absorption in titania.
Significant differences in the IR spectra are also seen in the OH region of TiO2-P (Fig. 3a) and the TiO2/GO-P nanocomposites (Fig. 3c and e). On the pure TiO2, the ν(H–O–H) band at 3462 cm−1 due to adsorbed water and the related δ(H–O–H) band at 1623 cm−1 in the fingerprint region (Fig. 3a) remain almost unchanged during the PID. In contrast, on the nanocomposites, these bands are shifted to 3450 cm−1 and 1645 cm−1 (Fig. 3d and f) and disappear almost immediately after the start of the irradiation. This is further accompanied with the formation of a negative band centred at 1622 cm−1. This indicates, once again, that more water is consumed than produced during PID on the TiO2/GO composites.

3.3. Degradation kinetics
The initial decomposition rate was found to obey first-order reaction kinetics during the first 5 minutes:54 (1)where θDMMP is the surface coverage of DMMP, and kdec is the rate constant for the overall decomposition of adsorbed species determined from a linear least-squares fit to the data in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Plots of the normalized logarithmic decay of the whole (CH) region as a function of time on samples prepared a) by urea precipitation and b) via refluxing the peroxo titanium complex. 
In Fig. 4 ln(A/A0) is plotted as a function of illumination time, where A0 is the integrated area of the whole CH region. It is evident that after the first 5 minutes a new linear regime (with larger scattering) appears. Thus, our data reveals that the degradation kinetics consists of at least two exponential decays, one fast at t < 5 min and one slower at t >15 min. This means that the rate determining step changes in the course of the reaction. Based on the analysis of the DRIFTS data in the previous sections we attribute this to i) an initial period where the reaction is limited by radical supply because of the competing water splitting reaction which consumes water and provides OH radicals and ii) a later period where strongly bonded intermediates accumulate and block the active sites. This interpretation is also consistent with the generally higher SSA normalized kdec (kSSA in Table 2) on the TiO2/GO-P samples compared with the TiO2/GO-U samples, where water is depleted much faster on the former samples. Consequently, hydroxyl radicals ˙OH from adsorbed water molecules, which act as electron acceptors, are produced at a higher rate on the TiO2/GO-P samples, thus yielding a higher kSSA.
Further, we see that for the TiO2/GO-U samples (Fig. 4a, Table 2), the degradation rates are similar on pure titania and the nanocomposites. Substantially larger amounts of DMMP are, however, adsorbed on the composites (four times larger on 1 wt% and two times larger on 2 wt% GO vs. TiO2) as estimated from the whole C–H region integrated area normalized per surface area (Table 2). In this respect, the composites are much more efficient for DMMP decontamination simply because of an enhanced adsorption capacity.
In contrast, the effect of GO is remarkable on the TiO2/GO-P nanocomposites yielding a dramatically enhanced degradation rate (Fig. 4b, Table 2). Since there was no change in the composite morphology and the surface area of the samples even decreased, we ascribed this improvement mainly to the electronic effects induced by GO, which will be further discussed in section 3.4.

3.3.1. Individual CH bands. 
Plots of integrated area vs. illumination time for individual CH bands (Fig. 5a–f) show that different C–H groups follow different reaction kinetics. Note that for pure TiO2-U only two well-resolved bands were plotted due to the low band intensity and low signal-to-noise ratio of the other peaks.
 Fig. 5  Plots of individual C–H bands of adsorbed species as a function of time on a) TiO2; b) the TiO2/GO composite with 1 wt% GO; and c) the TiO2/GO composite with 2 wt% GO prepared by the urea method; and d) TiO2; e) the TiO2/GO composite with 1 wt% GO; f) the TiO2/GO composite with 2 wt% GO prepared via the peroxo titanium complex method. 
The decrease of asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching bands for P-bonded methyl groups are well correlated (Fig. 5, grey squares, blue triangles). But for the P-bonded methoxy groups only symmetrical stretching bands were plotted (red circles) because the asymmetrical stretching bands overlap with the newly formed C–H band of formates (see spectra in Fig. 2 and 3).
On all samples, the IR bands associated with methoxy groups that are weakly bound to the Ti cationic sites (green squares) and that are formed by partial dissociation of the DMMP molecules exhibited the highest degradation rate during the first 5 minutes of illumination. Interestingly, phosphorous P-bonded methyl groups (grey, blue) diminished faster than the P-bonded methoxy groups (red) on both urea (Fig. 5a–c) and peroxo-derived (Fig. 5d–f) samples. The faster degradation of the methyl bands is in contrast to the studies of Trubitsyn and Vorontsov,13 and Moss et al.,40 who observed that the methoxy bands are oxidized more easily, and to the study by Rusu and Yates43 who described equal photodegradation of both moieties. Nevertheless, the studies differ in experimental conditions such as specific sample properties, working temperature, DMMP surface coverage, and humidity, which all strongly affect the PID process, thus making it difficult to draw any general conclusions.

3.4. GO reduction before and after PID
The reduction state of GO is crucial for adsorption as well as photodegradation efficiency.63,64 As shown by the UV-vis spectra, digital photographs, and Raman spectra in Fig. 6, GO in TiO2/GO-U composites was only slightly reduced (indicated by their brownish color and small IG/I2D Raman band ratio; see our previous work45), while in the TiO2/GO-P composites, GO was significantly more reduced (as suggested by their grey-black color and significantly higher IG/I2D ratio; see our previous work45). The improved DMMP adsorption properties of TiO2/GO-U can be explained by the good dispersion of water-compatible GO sheets during synthesis (which improved the composite texture and SSA) and the abundance of reactive oxygen containing groups. On the other hand, the much larger degree of reduction of the TiO2/GO-P results in a decreased SSA (due to collapsing and re-stacking of rGO during synthesis) and loss of reactive terminal oxygen species.
 Fig. 6  Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra of TiO2/GO composites before and after PID prepared a) by the urea method (TiO2/GO_U) and b) via the peroxo titanium complex method (TiO2/GO-P). Raman spectra of GO and TiO2/GO composites with 2 wt% GO before and after PID: c) TiO2/GO-U and d) TiO2/GO-P. 
The reduction of GO was also studied before and after PID. Significant changes were observed on TiO2/GO-U composites. Their brownish color changed significantly to dark grey after PID, as seen in the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and digital photographs of the samples (Fig. 6a). The comparison of the intensity of Raman D and G bands (ID/IG) gives information about the defect concentration (Fig. 6c). Compared to pristine GO, the ratio increased from 0.9 to 1.06 after synthesis which means the higher concentration of defects, probably caused by fragmentation of larger GO sheets during preparation. However, after the PID reaction, the defect concentration decreased (ratio 0.97) which can be explained by the partial restoration of the sp2 clusters by electrons during GO photoreduction.65 Furthermore, the IG/I2D ratio, that can be used to estimate the charge carrier mobility, changed from 0.06 for pristine GO to 0.09 for the composites after synthesis, and further increased to 0.13 after PID, indicating that the charge carrier mobility was improved by the photoreduction of GO. This value is very similar to that of solar light reduced GO with very good conductivity observed by Mohandoss et al.50
In contrast, TiO2/GO-P composites were dark grey directly after synthesis and retained the same color after the PID reaction as shown by the digital photographs and UV-vis spectra (Fig. 6b). The Raman ID/IG ratio increased to 0.99 after synthesis and did not change during PID, suggesting small changes in the defect concentration of GO in these composites (Fig. 6d). The IG/I2D ratio increased to a value of 0.12 directly after synthesis, which suggested a higher degree of reduction and better charge carrier mobility than for the TiO2/GO-U nanocomposites (cf.Fig. 6c and d). A slight decrease of the ratio after PID (0.11) might suggest some deterioration of the exposed rGO sheets because, unlike the TiO2/GO-U composites, they are not protected by the TiO2 surface layer, as seen in the SEM images.
4. Conclusions
Pure TiO2 and TiO2/GO nanocomposites with 1 and 2 wt% GO prepared by two different methods were used to study solar light induced photodecomposition of DMMP molecules by in situ DRIFT spectroscopy. Both methods provide nanocomposites that effectively adsorb and dissociate DMMP. Subsequent solar illumination leads to rapid decomposition of DMMP to intermediate products, in particular ionic and surface coordinated formate and carbonate species.
Both the kinetics of the adsorbed species decomposition and the formation of various intermediates were strongly affected by the presence of GO and the degree of GO reduction. The oxygen moieties of the GO sheets remain rather intact on the composites prepared by homogeneous precipitation with urea (TiO2/GO-U), which positively affects the texture, specific surface area, adsorption capacity, and initial dissociation of DMMP. On the other hand, refluxing GO with a peroxo titanium complex (TiO2/GO-P) induced a higher degree of reduction of GO during synthesis, and consequently lowered the SSA of the composites. Nevertheless, their adsorption capacity was comparable to that of the TiO2/GO-U nanocomposites suggesting that not only the SSA but also the physiochemical properties of the nanocomposites are important.
Solar illumination led to further reduction of GO in the TiO2/GO-U nanocomposites, while GO remained unchanged in the TiO2/GO-P samples. The degree of reduction of GO correlated with their photoreactivity; more reduced GO with associated larger carrier mobility showed a higher DMMP photodegradation rate. The results demonstrate that the GO behavior during synthesis and its reduction state are strongly dependent on the reaction conditions and must be taken into account in the design, preparation, and evaluation of the activity of TiO2-based composites. Interestingly, we infer an initial very efficient water consumption reaction, in particular on the reduced TiO2/GO-P nanocomposites, which competes with the photo-oxidation reaction, and we hypothesize that these nanocomposites may find applications in photocatalytic water splitting.
