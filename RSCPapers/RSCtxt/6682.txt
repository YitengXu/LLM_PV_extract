    , Accepted 29th June 2018First published on 29th June 2018AbstractAll polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), compared to fullerene or non-fullerene small molecule based solar cells possess the merits of high morphological stability, good film forming properties and superior mechanical flexibility. However, in contrast to the rapid progress in molecule-design and device engineering in this field, our fundamental insights into key photo-physical parameters that govern the device characteristics still lag behind. Here, based on state of the art PTzBI:N2200 all-PSCs with efficiencies of ∼9% compared with PBDB-T:N2200 all-PSCs, we investigate properties of charge transport, bimolecular recombination, energetic disorder and voltage losses. We show that expedited charge extraction with weaker bias-dependence in the PTzBI:N2200 cell results in the reduction of bimolecular recombination, which explains the increases in photocurrent and fill factor. Further mitigation of the voltage losses in this high performance all-polymer system may be allowed by decreasing the energetic disorder in PTzBI:N2200 bulk heterojunctions through delicate morphological optimization.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSC) have attracted considerable attention in the last three decades, owing to their unique merits of light weight, high flexibility, and potential for large-scale production with roll-to-roll printing techniques. The abundance of donor/acceptor (or D/A) interfaces formed in the interpenetrating networks1 of bulk heterojunction film prompts the efficiency of exciton diffusion, charge separation, and carrier collection, making BHJ-PSCs the most promising OPV technology to generate electricity at a low cost. To date, polymeric donors blended with acceptors based on fullerene derivatives or emerging non-fullerene small molecules are the dominant materials combined to yield high PCEs.2–4 Regarding fullerene acceptors, despite their appropriate solubility, good compatibility (with donor molecules)5 and high electron transport ability,6 the PCE is impeded by the poor absorption in the visible/near IR regime and the tendency to aggregate in the solid state that potentially hampers the morphological stability.7 Very recently, emerging non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have become competitive alternatives with synthetically tailored absorption that has a better overlap with the solar spectrum.8 This feature alongside the tunable energy levels allows for boosts in photon harvesting, open-circuit voltage (Voc) and ultimate PCEs.4,9,10 However, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors may suffer from poor thermal or morphological stability, which to some degree may hinder realistic applications with these OPV materials.11–14
Compared to fullerene or non-fullerene small molecule solar cells, all polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of a polymer donor and a polymer accepter, possess the merits of high morphological stability, good film forming properties and superior mechanical flexibility.15,16 These advantages desirably compensate for the shortcomings in PSCs with fullerene or non-fullerene small molecule acceptors, and have thus attracted increasing attention recently. With efforts on the molecular design of new donors (or acceptors) and materials and optimization of the matching of energetics or film morphology,17–22 the PCEs of all-PSCs have received a considerable increase from 3% to 10% up to now. However, in contrast to the visible advances in device engineering and PCEs of all-PSCs, fundamental understanding of the key photo-physical parameters limiting the device performance still lag behind.
It is generally accepted that charge recombination plays a critical role in the ultimate photovoltaic behaviour of organic solar cells.23 In all-PCS, the complementary absorption enabled by the polymer acceptor tends to raise the number of photocarriers in the BHJ film, when compared to PSCs with fullerene acceptors in which the excitons are mainly created in the donor molecule. As a result, the increase of carrier density may simultaneously promote the encounter probability of carriers such that the recombination is elevated. Therefore, efficient utilization of the photocarriers for current conversion becomes essential for the PCE in all-PSCs. Also, the reduction of recombination has been linked to the increase of the fill factor (FF) in OPVs.24 On the other hand, due to the nature of the BHJ, larger voltage losses are often observed in OPVs,25,26 which can fundamentally limit the increase of PCEs. Previous studies on fullerene based OPVs have shed light on the connection between charge transport, energy disorder, and recombination and voltage losses. For example, it has been shown that reducing the energetic disorder in the BHJ film helps mitigate the Voc losses (ΔVoc).27 In a recent study on OPVs with ITIC and IT-M small molecule acceptors, the energetic disorder in charge transport was found to play a role in the Voc. Besides, it shows that the mobility balance between the two carriers in non-fullerene BHJ films can impact the reduction of bimolecular recombination with respect to the Langevin rate.28 Through these studies, the photovoltaic parameters can be well correlated to the recombination losses and transport characteristics. In comparison to this fundamental progress established for PSCs using small molecule and PC71BM acceptors,29,30 relevant insights for all-PSCs are few, which partially may be due to the lack of a proper test bed with low geminate losses.
In this communication, we focus on a high efficiency all-polymer model system comprising the poly{4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-4,8-di(thien-2-yl)-6-octyl-2-octyl-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7(6H)-dione} (PTzBI) donor blended with the poly{[N,N-9-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis-(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (N2200) electron acceptor that yields an attractive PCE of 9.13% (see the chemical structures of PTzBI and N2200 in Fig. 1a and b). Through comparative investigations of PTZBI:N2200 solar cells with another all-PSC based on PBDB-T:N2200 blends (see Fig. 1c for the chemical structure of PBDB-T), we attained insights into the properties of transport, charge extraction and recombination as well as the Voc losses. The charge extraction efficiency in all-PSCs was probed through bias dependent photocurrent decay kinetics that show connection with the carrier mobility and balance. Alongside the assessment of bimolecular recombination based on the determined carrier mobility in the steady-state, the gains in the photocurrent and fill factor in the PTzBI:N2200 device can be rationalized by the recombination properties displaying an enlarged reduction factor and longer-lived photocarriers. Despite the more balanced mobility in the PBDB-T:N2200 cell with resultant rapid charge extraction, the recombination losses appear more severe than in the PTzBI:N2200 solar cell. This behavior can be correlated to the reduction factor for the recombination coefficient and the ultimate recombination rate which tend to be modulated by the balance of transport in the BHJ films. We further explored the Voc losses in these two all-PSCs that possess similar HOMO energies in the donors. The two devices exhibit similar ΔVoc while a slightly enhanced Voc was observed in the PBDB-T:N2200 device, which can be related to the lower-lying charge transfer states with a smaller Urbach energy determined by photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS). The combination of these results frames a constructive guideline to mitigate bimolecular recombination and voltage losses toward achievements of high efficiency all-PSCs.

2. Experimental section
Materials
PTzBI and N2200 were synthesized according to ref. 31, and PBDB-T and PFN-Br were purchased from Solarmer, Inc (Beijing). Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS AL 4083) was purchased from Nichem, Inc.
Device fabrication
Pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were scrubbed using soapy water and cleaned in ultrasonic baths with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially. After drying using dry nitrogen, the cleaned ITO substrates were UV/ozone treated for 15 min. 40 nm PEDOT:PSS hole transporting layers were spin-coated on the top of the ITO substrates at 4000 rpm for 30 s followed by thermal annealing at 165 °C for 15 min in air. The PEDOT-containing ITO substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox before use. The all-polymer BHJ solutions were prepared by solubilizing N2200 accepter blended with polymer donors PTzBI (D/A ratio = 2:1 w/w) and PBDB-T (D/A ratio = 2:1) in Me-THF and CB, respectively. The photoactive layers were spin-cast from the BHJ solutions at 1200 rpm and 2300 rpm for the PTzBI and PBDB-T device, respectively, leading to a film thickness of around 150 nm. The cast BHJ active layers were thermally annealed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 10 min. Then the PFN-Br/methanol solution (concentration 0.5 mg ml−1) was deposited on the top of the active layer at 4000 rpm to form a cathode buffer with a thickness of ∼5 nm. At last, 80 nm of Al cathode was thermally evaporated on the PFN-Br at a pressure < 1 × 10−5 Pa through shadow masks, leading to an active area of 4 mm2.
For single-carrier devices, the active layers were prepared identically to the procedures employed for solar cells. The hole-only and electron-only devices were in a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN-Br/Al, respectively. The ZnO solution was prepared by dissolving 0.2 g of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O,99.9%, Afla) and 0.055 ml of ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, 99.5%, Aladdin) in 2.0 ml of 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, 99.8%, Alfa). All single-carrier devices were characterized using a Lakeshore vacuum probe station by using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter analyser in a dark environment.
Characterization

J–V characteristics of solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 Sourcemeter under AM 1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 provided by a class AAA solar simulator and calibrated using a National Institute of Metrology (NIM, China) certified KG5-filtered silicon reference cell. The EQE spectra of solar cells were measured in air by using an Oriel Newport EQE measurement system (Model 66920) equipped with a Newport Xenon lamp and calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si reference cell. Irradiation-dependent solar cell characterization was performed by placing a filter wheel between the samples and the light source to obtain desired illumination intensities and calibrated using the NIM-certified silicon reference cell through current readings. PL spectra of BHJ and neat films were measured by using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Nanolog fluorimeter under excitation at 580 nm. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured by using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 spectrometer. Grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed at the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology by using a Xeuss SAXS/WAXS system. Preparation of the samples adopted the same procedures described above while the PFN-Br and Al cathode were excluded. Surface topographic images were captured by using a Bruker Multimode-8 microscope system in tapping mode under ambient conditions.
3. Results and discussion
As shown by the energy diagram of the compared all-polymer BHJ systems, PTzBI has an identical level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) compared to that in PBDB-T but a slightly shallower level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). This may result in an expectation of similar photocurrent and Voc from a purely energetic point of view. Nevertheless, as will be seen, visible photocurrent gains in the PTzBI:N2200 solar cell can be observed associated with an enlarged fill factor (FF), which arouses interest to probe the underlying mechanisms in terms of recombination losses in the two all-PSCs. Fig. 1b shows normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of PTzBI and PBDB-T blend films (absorption spectra of neat films are provided in Fig. S1 in ESI†). The absorbance of the former exhibits a strong peak at 602 nm arising from the absorption of the PTzBI donor and a weaker peak in the high energy regime around ∼400 nm which arises from the main absorption of N2200. Regarding the PBDB-TN2200 blend film, a similar absorption profile is found while the ratio between the high and low energy peaks differs, associated with a reduced tail absorption in the 700–850 nm range that originates from the charge transfer peak in the N2200 acceptor.

Fig. 1c shows current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of all-PSCs based on PTzBI:N2200 and PBDB-T:N2200 blend films in respective optimal conditions (see the Experimental section) under AM 1.5G solar cell irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The enlargement of the ultimate PCE in the PTzBI device mainly arises from the gain of Jsc, which is 15.75 mA cm−2versus Jsc = 10.52 mA cm−2 in the PBDB-T cell. The former also exhibits a larger FF but a slightly reduced Voc. As a result, the efficiency in the device with the PTzBI donor is boosted to 9%, one of the highest values reported for all-PSCs.31 The differences in the photovoltaic parameters of the solar cells contrast with the absorbance of the two BHJ films in Fig. 2b, indicating that other factors should play a role. Fig. 1d shows the according external quantum efficiency (EQE) of these solar cells, from which a pronounced difference in the EQE can be observed. The maximal EQE (EQEmax) is 72% at 560 nm and 47% at 590 nm for the PTzBI and PBDB-T devices, respectively. While a similar EQE is found in the absorption tails of N2200, the average EQE in the spectral range between 350–700 nm is nearly doubled in the PTzBI device, indicating a much greater photon-harvesting efficiency. Meanwhile, it suggests that more severe losses in the photocarriers are present in the PBDB-T:N2200 cell (Table 1).

To probe the reasons behind the distinct device behaviours, we first explored the surface morphology of the two polymeric BHJ films using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the according AFM topographical and phase images are shown in Fig. 2a–d. We note a distinct fibrillar nanostructure in the PBDB-T:N2200 blends, which contrasts with the more coarse morphology in PTzBI blends with a dendrite-like structure. From the phase images shown in Fig. 2c and d, it can be seen that the PBDB-T:N2200 device may possess oversized phase separations in comparison with the finer and more compact structure in PTzBI:N2200. Such a morphological feature with larger domain sizes in the PBDBT:N2200 blend film tends to explain the weaker PL quenching, given the short exciton dissociation distance in organic solar cells (a few to ten nanometers). Besides, the morphology also implies a different degree of molecular ordering, which as will be seen, can be correlated to the Urbach energy. The determined RMS from AFM is 2.48 nm and 1.90 nm, respectively, for PBDB-T:N2200 and PTzBI:N2200. Of interest, fiber-like structures are found in the phase image of the PBDB-T film whereas the phase image of the PTzBI:N2200 film exhibits smaller structures in association with well-mixed features. Morphologically, it hints at a shrinkage of domain sizes with increased miscibility in PTzBI:N2200 blend films. We further performed photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements to gain insights into the charge dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface21 within the all-polymer BHJs (see the results in Fig. 2e and f). According to the PL spectra of neat PTzBI, PBDB-T and N2200 films (Fig. 2e), the PL emissions in neat PBDB-T and PTzBI are positioned at ∼700 nm and 650 nm, respectively. A stronger quenching of the emission from single excitons in the donor phase occurs in the PTzBI BHJ film, indicating more efficient charge transfer in the PTzBI solar cell with reduced geminate losses. This result can be explained by the larger LUMO-LUMO offset at the PTzBI:N2200 interface. From Fig. 2f, the intensity of the PL around 825 nm, originating from N2200, remains similar in the two BHJ films, meaning that the quenching efficiency of singlet excitons created in the N2200 acceptor is roughly identical in these two BHJ films. This observation strongly points to the resemblance in the hole transfer efficiency driven by the HOMO–HOMO offset in these BHJ films. We further quantified the PL quenching efficiency (ΔPL) of donor emissions, defined by the PL intensity (from the donor) of the blend film and that of neat polymer film. ΔPL demonstrates the efficiency of exciton diffusion and dissociation at the donor and accepter interface, subject to the characteristics of nanoscale phase segregation and miscibility. We attained a ΔPL of 94.76% for PTzBI:N2200 and 78% for PBDB-T:N2200. This confirms more efficient charge transfer at the D/A interface between PTzBI and the polymeric accepter N2200. On the other hand, the reduction of ΔPL is consistent with the result in a previous study where the PBDB-T:N2200 solar cell was identified with more significant carrier losses via geminate charge recombination.22
In order to further understand the different photoconductivities and FF in Table 1, we measured photocurrent (Jph) versus effective applied voltage (Veff) characteristics of solar cells with the results shown in Fig. 3a, where Jph is defined as JL–JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark. Veff is given by V0–Vapp, where V0 is the voltage corresponding to Jph = 0, and Vapp is the applied bias.32,33 The fact that Jph becomes saturated at large Veff indicates that nearly all the photo-generated excitons are dissociated into free carriers and collected by the respective electrodes. Ideally, the efficiencies of exciton dissociation and charge collection may approach unity under sufficiently high Veff, and in this situation, Jsat is mainly governed by the maximal exciton generation rate (Gmax) that may exhibit a field-dependence as well. As can be seen from Fig. 3a, Jph in both devices starts to saturate at a Veff of ∼0.25 V, corresponding to a Jsat of 176.7 A m−2 and 140.5 A m−1 for PTzBI and PBDB-T devices. Based on the relation Gmax = Jsat/qL with q being the elementary charge and L being the film thickness of the active layer, we attained a Gmax of 8.8 × 1027 m−3 s−1 in the PTzBI device, two fold higher than that in the PBDB-T cell with Gmax = 4.33 × 1027 m−3 s−1. The result fully agrees with the reduced geminate losses in the PTzBI:N2200 device which partially explains the EQE spectra. It is interesting to note that Jph in PBDB-T:N2200 exhibits a square-root dependence on Veff (see the guide line in Fig. 3a) before saturation. Such a phenomenon has been ascribed to the formation of space-charge-limited (SCL) photocurrent, likely attributed to non-satisfactory charge transport or morphological reasons. The exact origins for possibly formed SCL-Jph are yet unclear, while such behavior can be connected to lower FF in the PBTB-T:N2200 solar cell.

Also illustrated by the grey line is the space-charge limited photocurrent with a square root voltage dependence. (b–d) Light intensity dependent solar cell parameters in all-PSCs. (b) Voc, (c) Jsc, and (d) fill factor. 
More insights into non-geminate recombination in these all-PSCs are attained from irradiation (or Plight)-dependent photovoltaic parameters with the results for Voc, Jsc and FF shown in Fig. 3b–d, respectively (see Plight dependent J–V curves of solar cells in Fig. S2, ESI†). The dependence of Voc on irradiation intensity (Plight) generally reflects the ideality factor (IF) in the solar cell that is subject to the traps and resultant recombination type. With a decrease in Plight, the Voc difference between two cells becomes slightly larger, which points to differentiated IFs. With significant charge trapping and trap-limited recombination, the IF should be approaching two. While in both PTzBI and PBDB-T devices, the slopes of the Voc–Plight curves are 1.35 kT q−1 and 1.22 kT q−1 (with kT q−1 being the thermal voltage), leading to IF of 1.35 and 1.22 that are slightly larger than unity. This result is suggestive of the insignificance of traps in our devices. Thus, non-geminate recombination in the two all-PSCs should primarily occur via bi-molecular paths (Fig. 4).

To confirm, we compared Jsc as a function of Plight (see Fig. 3c). As reported, Jsc typically follows a power-law dependence on Plight as ∼Pαlight,32,34 where the power described by α can demostrate the strength of bimolecular recombination. Dominant bi-molecular recombination has been identified to be associated with α approaching 1 in OPVs. Based on power law fittings, α was determined to be 0.948 (PTzBI) and 0.946 (PBDB-T). On this basis, the type of recombination seems to remain the same while the recombination intensity (or rate) differs in the two devices. The origin of poor FF in OPVs is often ascribed origins related to recombination, traps, field-dependence charge generation or other factors. Based on the dependence of FF on Plight, the role of recombination in FF can be qualitatively assessed. If FF is mainly limited by recombination, one expects an enlargement of FF at lower Plight in which the recombination strength tends to decrease due to the reduction of carrier density. In the two devices, we observe similar tendencies in the variation of FF that both increase with decreasing Plight in the high light intensity regime (Fig. 3d). Notably, the adverse decrease in FF in the PTzBI device with Plight < ∼0.4 could be due to current leakages. Based on these analyses, bi-molecular recombination at higher Plight (near 1 sun) should be the dominant loss channel, leading to different device performances.
In operational solar cells, the interplay between the two competing processes of charge recombination and extraction are critically important for ultimate device efficiency. Generally, increasing the efficiency of charge extraction can promote the enhancement of photocurrent with suppressed recombination. To determine recombination kinetics and charge extraction, we employed transient photovoltaic (TPV)35 and transient photocurrent (TPC)36 measurements. Fig. 4a shows the TPV results of solar cells excited by a laser pulse at 488 nm (open-circuit conditions). Under this condition, the net current through the device is zero and thus the decay kinetics mainly reflect the lifetime of carriers governed by recombination. A slower or longer lifetime of carriers in TPV can generally point to weaker recombination. As can be seen from Fig. 4c, marked differences are observed in these decay traces and the PTzBI solar cell exhibits a longer decay time of 63.0 ms, based on the fittings with a mono-exponential decay model. In contrast, the decay time for PBDB-T solar cell is less than half the value of that for the PTzBI device (27.5 ms), meaning stronger recombination is present in the former. To further assess the extraction efficiency of photocarriers, a competing process to recombination, we performed TPC measurements. Differing from TPV, external bias can be applied to the device to directly modulate the electrical field and resultant recombination and extraction. Fig. 4a and b show the results of (normalized) transient photocurrent at various biases. For both devices, the photocurrent decay becomes slower when increasing the forward bias, meaning that the charge extraction experiences a hurdle. This is interpreted by a reduced internal electrical field across the device at higher (forward) bias. By visualization, the TPC in the two solar cells exhibits a distinct voltage dependence. To further understand this behavior, we extracted the decay time based on a mono-exponential decay model at different biases and the results are shown in Fig. 4d. On average, the decay time in the PBDB-T device is nearly double that of the PTzBI device, indicating a higher charge extraction efficiency in the latter. The voltage dependence of the extraction time in the PTzBI cell is rather weak, which increases from ∼51 ns to 71.2 ns with the bias increased from −0.8 to 0.6 V. This trend suggests that the field-assisted extraction is insignificant in this high efficiency solar cell. In contrast, we observe two regimes in the PBDB-T device. In the forward bias regime, charge extraction is less efficient, which is coupled with a slower extraction time, exceeding 100 ns. When reverse biases are applied, charge extraction becomes more expedited due to the enlargement of internal field, such that the charge extraction time deceases more rapidly. The TPC results provide an important indication that in the device operational condition (forward bias regime), the more efficient charge extraction in the PTzBI solar cell can effectively mitigate the photocarrier losses due to bi-molecular recombination. This particularity can rationalize the enhanced Jsc and FF.
To attain more insight into the charge transport that plays a significant role in the charge extraction and recombination, we measured charge carrier mobilities with the well-established space-charge limited current (SCLC) method based on single-carrier devices (see dark J–V characteristics for mobility determination in Fig. S3, ESI†). The determined hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) are summarized in Table S2, ESI.†μh and μe in the PBDB-T:N2200 blends are relatively balanced, both falling on the order of 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This result agrees with the value reported previously for this BHJ system. Surprisingly, PTzBI:N2200 shows a larger μh of 1.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a reduced μe of 4.31 × 10−5 cm2 V−1s−1. Although the mobility imbalance becomes more pronounced, it does not necessarily cause negative effects in the solar cell operation. As we have pointed out for ITIC based non-fullerene solar cells, the larger mobility ratio (of the two carriers) may not always result in acceleration of recombination or unfavourable space-charge effects. On the contrary, the reduction of the recombination coefficient (with respect to the Langevin rate) can become stronger. This is explained by slower carriers on average needing to wait for a longer time to meet their counterpart charges (faster carriers) in a BHJ film with more unequal transport properties. The recombination strength (B) is determined by the recombination coefficient (krec) and carrier density described as, B = krecnp(1)where n and p are the electron and hole densities in the solar cell. The recombination rate (kL) of charge recombination in a semiconductor is given by,29,37 (2)where q is the elementary charge, and ε0εr is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor. It has been shown that the actual recombination coefficient in organic BHJ solar cells often deviates from the Langevin rate, leading to a so-called reduction factor or γ, described as γ = krec/kL. krec is determinable if γ is known. It was demonstrated by Blom et al. that the reduction factor γ can be directly quantified based on the analysis of the steady-state charge carrier mobility, according to the relation,24 (3)where μsolar is the effective mobility of double carriers in the solar cell. Fig. 5a shows the determined γ, and krec alongside the mobility ratios of the two all-polymer BHJ films. Indeed, the reduction factor is inversely proportional to the mobility ratio, e.g. γ reduces from 0.43 (PBDBT:N2200) to 0.28 (PTBzBI:N2200) on increasing the mobility ratio to 26.6. Based on the SCLC mobility and γ, the actual recombination coefficient was extracted. krec is similar in the two solar cells, both ranging around ∼10−11 cm−3 s−1. These values agree with krec on the order of 10−10–10−12 cm−3 s−1 found in solar cells with PCBM36 or ITIC based small molecule acceptors.28,35 In this context, further mitigation of the bimolecular recombination losses in all-PSCs lies in the reduction of krec, e.g. through process engineering for the morphology.

In BHJ solar cells, charge transfer states (CTS) are generally formed at the interface of the donor and accepter, on which the photogenerated excitons (or bound electron–hole pairs) can further dissociate into mobile holes and electrons. Regarding the voltage losses, defined as ΔVoc = Ect − Voc, the energy of CT (or Ect) provides an upper limit for Voc and the equality of the two entities is only achieved at temperature = 0 K. Since CTS are directly photo-excited, the value of Ect can be determined through measuring the photocurrent of CTS with the technique termed Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS). According to the Marcus theory, the EQE of FTPS is given by, (4)where f is a factor proportional to the number of states and the electronic coupling matrix elements, E is the photon energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature, and λ is the reorganization energy. Fig. 5b shows the results of FTPS, from which fittings with eqn (4) led to quantification of ECT and λ. We observe a small difference in λ (0.12 eV and 0.18 eV for the PBDB-T and PTzBI devices). The lower λ value is generally ascribed to a reduction of energetic disorder at the D/A interface that to some degree is correlated to the molecular ordering or transport properties. The extracted Ect is 1.44 eV and 1.40 for the PBDB-T and PTzBI devices, respectively. Concerning the values of Ect and Voc in the two cells, the larger difference in the former (∼40 mV) indicates that there are likely other factors responsible for the different ΔVoc (Table 2).

To better understand the reorganization energy and ΔVoc, we explored Urbach energies (Eurbach) in the two all-polymer BHJ films using PDS measurements with the results displayed in Fig. 5c. Eurbach provides a measure of the energetic disorder at tail states of the LUMO (or HOMO), which may demonstrate the degree of ordering in molecular stacking.38 Based on PDS, we extracted Eurbach of 29.6 meV and 32.8 meV for the PBDBT:N2200 and PTzBI:N2200 blend films. The similarity in Eurbach suggests that the energetic disorder in the two all-polymer blend films is very close. This argument is supported by the similar degree of π–π intermolecular stacking (∼1.7 Å) along the out of plane direction, revealed by GIWAXS measurements shown in Fig. 5d and Fig. S4, ESI.† In both films, the edge-on signals due to π–π stacking are much weaker, which implies that preferential face-on packing is adapted in these all-polymer BHJ films. Based on this analysis, it appears that smaller ΔVoc in the PTzBI:N2200 device may not be attributed to the reduced energetic disorder while other contributions should play a role, such as non-radiative losses. The Urbach energy of the PTzBI blend film seems to be governed by the acceptor film (Eurbach = 28.6 meV) while an abrupt decrease of Eurbach in PBDB-T blends is observed, in contrast to the larger Eurbach in respective neat films (see Fig. S5, ESI†). The molecular origins for this behaviour are yet to be clarified while it points to a suggestion that reducing the energetic disorder in PTzBI:N2200 may further suppress the voltage losses in this highly efficient all-polymer system.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have comprehensively investigated charge transport, bimolecular recombination, energetic disorder and voltage losses in high efficiency all-polymer solar cells based on PTzBI:N2200 and PBDB-T:N2200. We show that the imbalance of mobility to some extent does not necessarily hinder device performance, while it can lead to stronger reduction of bimolecular recombination coefficients and ultimate recombination strength. This tendency agrees with previous observations on solar cells with non-fullerene small molecular acceptors. Based on bias-dependent photocurrent decay kinetics, more efficient carrier extraction is identified in the PTzBI solar cell which is associated with weaker field-dependence on the charge extraction time. Meanwhile, we found an elongated carrier lifetime (at the open-circuit condition) in PTzBI:N2200 that can be related to the less pronounced charge recombination. All these particularities explain the enhancement of the short-circuit current and the fill factor due to mitigated carrier losses via charge recombination. FTPS coupled with PDS measurements indicate that the slightly lowered voltage losses in the PTzBI cell cannot be ascribed to reduced energetic disorder, while other contributions including non-radiative losses may play a role. Thus, further increase of Voc in the high performance PTzBI all-PSC may be allowed by decreasing the energetic disorder in the blend film, e.g. through delicate morphological optimization using solvent processing. This work provides in-depth insights into key photophysical parameters governing device characteristics in all-polymer BHJ solar cells with advantages in thermal stability and mechanical flexibility.
