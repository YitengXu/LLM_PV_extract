Through an ethylene glycol (EG) treatment, the conductivity of the spray-coated PEDOT:PSS film on glass substrate was significantly enhanced with a low sheet resistance of 17.2 Ω □−1, very close to that of fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements showed that the phase separation between PEDOT and PSS, and the depletion of PSS during the EG-treatment process contributed to enhanced conducting pathways for carriers. After electrodeposition of an extra PEDOT catalytic layer, the polymer based CE showed a very low sheet resistance of 15.5 Ω □−1 and good catalytic activity towards the I−/I3− redox reaction compared to the pyrolyzed Pt CE. A DSSC based on this TCO- and Pt-free (PEDOT/PEDOT:PSS/Glass) CE showed a high energy conversion efficiency of 8.33% accompanied by a fill factor of 0.64 under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5), which was comparable to that of the Pt/FTO CE based cell (8.75%).
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted widespread attention in recent years for their high energy conversion efficiency, low cost, easy fabrication process, and are considered to be the most attractive alternative to silicon solar cells.1,2 Great efforts have been devoted to improve the photoelectrical performance of DSSCs,3–5 to date the highest energy conversion efficiency of 12.3% has been reported.6 Conventional DSSCs consist of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode coated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass, I−/I3− redox electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE). As an important component of DSSCs, the CE transfers the electrons from the external circuit back to the electrolyte and catalyze the reduction of I3− to I− in the solution. Generally, FTO glass coated with Pt nanoparticles is employed as an efficient CE for DSSCs due to its good conductivity and high catalytic activity to the I−/I3− redox couple. However, there are several drawbacks of Pt CE such as high cost, natural scarcity and easy corrosion in I−/I3− solution.7,8 Besides, the Pt nanoparticle layer is usually prepared through thermal annealing of H2PtCl6 precursor at high temperature, which prohibits the use of flexible plastic substrates. Therefore, it is highly necessary to develop Pt-free CEs with cheaper but efficient catalytic materials to replace Pt CEs. So far, many emerging materials like carbon materials (graphene,8 carbon nanotubes,9 active carbon,10etc.), conductive polymers (polyaniline,11 poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT),12etc.) and other materials have been studied as alternatives to Pt. Unfortunately, the catalytic activity of most of them are usually lower than that of Pt.
FTO glass together with other transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coated glass, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) glass, are the most widely used electrode materials in photovoltaic devices. However, TCO suffers from high cost and brittleness.13,14 In addition, an inefficient manufacturing process and the rigid glass substrates also limit TCO from use in flexible applications and its further development.15 Therefore, a number of materials have been investigated as the replacement of TCO. Conductive polymers (e.g., polypyrrole,16 polyaniline,17 polythiophene18 along with their derivatives), carbon materials (e.g., graphene,19 carbon nanotubes,20 carbon fiber,21etc.) and metal nanostructures (e.g. Ag,22 Cu23) have been reported as emerging electrode materials in photovoltaic devices.
Among all the reported alternative conductive materials, PEDOT is the most widely used conducting polymer due to its stability and high conductivity. Moreover, it can be dispersed in water after coupling with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) which would provide a good processing ability.18,24 The PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersions are commercially available and can be processed into films through conventional coating methods such as spin-coating and spray-coating. Though the conductivity of pristine PEDOT:PSS film is below 1 S cm−1,25 much lower than ITO film, the value can be greatly improved by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude after the addition of secondary dopants, such as surfactants,26,27 ionic liquid,28 high boiling point solvents,29 polyols,30,31 salts,32etc., which makes it possible to work as the electrode material.
To achieve the requirements of low-cost, flexible and high-output manufacturing for DSSCs, it is of great value to investigate the TCO- and Pt-free counter electrodes. There have been several reports concerning this issue.21,33–40 For example, Lee et al. used a highly conductive PEDOT film synthesized by an in situ polymerization method to replace both FTO and Pt, and the cells based on this CE showed an efficiency of 5.08%.33 Sun et al. used flexible graphite as conducting layer and conducting polyaniline as catalytic material to prepare a low-cost CE and an efficiency of 7.36% was obtained,40 which was a higher efficiency for TCO- and Pt-free CE than reported before. However, the power conversion efficiencies of most of these works are still low. In this study, we report a novel polymer based TCO- and Pt-free CE by employing conductivity enhanced PEDOT:PSS as the conductive film and electrodeposited PEDOT layer as the catalyst layer for the first time. The DSSCs with this novel CE showed a high energy conversion efficiency of 8.33%, this is the highest conversion efficiency for DSSCs based on FTO- and Pt-free CEs that has been reported so far. The PEDOT:PSS film was fabricated first on a glass substrate by simply spray-coating commercial Clevios PH 1000 aqueous solution and then modified with ethylene glycol (EG) to enhance the conductivity. The conductivity of the original film can be greatly improved by 3 orders of magnitude and also showed a quite low sheet resistance, close to that of FTO glass. The further electrodeposited PEDOT layer can greatly enhance the catalytic ability of the film. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements demonstrated that the polymer based PEDOT/PEDOT:PSS/Glass CE showed a comparable catalytic activity to Pt.
2 Experimental section
Preparation of counter electrode
Fabrication of PEDOT:PSS films: PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH 1000) solution was purchased from Heraeus. The solid content of the PH 1000 solution was 1.3% by weight and the ratio of PEDOT to PSS was 1:1.25. Glass substrates were first cut to 2.5 × 2.5 cm2, and then cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with alcohol, acetone, and de-ionized water in turn. PEDOT:PSS films were prepared by spray-coating the Clevios PH 1000 aqueous solution onto the surface of clean glass substrates which were placed on a hot plate at 150 °C. The as-prepared PEDOT:PSS films were dried for another 5 min on the hot plate. For the spray coating, an airbrush with a flow pump was used and the air pressure was kept at 400 kPa. The flow rate was controlled with the pump and the thicknesses of the films were controlled by the spraying time.
Conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS film
Ethylene glycol (EG) was used to enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films according to the reported procedure30,31,41 except that a spray treatment was used in our method. In a typical process, 5 mL EG was sprayed onto the surface of PEDOT:PSS films first via the same spray conditions as described above. After annealing at 150 °C for 5 min, the samples were immersed in cool EG solvent immediately and held for 30 min. Afterwards, the samples were annealed at 150 °C again to remove the EG solvent.
Electrodeposition of PEDOT catalytic layer
The PEDOT layer was synthesized via electrochemical polymerization of EDOT monomer in acetonitrile solution according to a previously published method.42 The supporting electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M EDOT and 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide. The EG-treated PEDOT:PSS/Glass film served as the working electrode and a Pt net worked as the counter electrode. The deposition current density was 1.10 mA cm−2, and the deposition time was 15 seconds. For comparison, electrodeposited PEDOT film on FTO glass (14 Ω □−1, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) and a traditional FTO based pyrolyzed Pt CE were also prepared. The PEDOT/FTO electrode was fabricated by the same electrodeposition process. The Pt CEs were prepared by thermally depositing H2PtCl6 (5 mM in isopropanol) on FTO glass at 400 °C for 15 min.
Preparation of the TiO2 photoanode
The TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated by screen-printing an anatase nanocrystalline TiO2 paste (about 20 nm in size) on the surface of FTO glass; the thickness was controlled by repeated screen-printing and finally reached about 18 μm. The TiO2 nanocrystalline particles and the TiO2 paste were synthesized according to our previous report.43 Then the electrodes were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min to remove the organics. In order to improve the photovoltaic performance, the photoanode films were immersed into TiCl4 solution (0.04 M) at 70 °C for 30 min. Then the electrodes were sintered at 520 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to ∼80 °C, the electrodes were soaked in N719 dye (0.5 mM in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol with a volume ratio of 1:1) for 16 h at room temperature.
Fabrication of DSSCs and characterization
The TiO2 photoanode and counter electrode were sandwiched together and the space filled with liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a solvent mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 85:15).
The surface morphology was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F), and an Atomic Force Microscope (SHIMADZU) with a tapping mode. The chemical composition of films was analyzed by a chemical composition analysis X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) ESCA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250, Mono Al Kα source 1486.6 eV). The sheet resistances of the PEDOT:PSS film and FTO glass were measured by a four-point resistivity measurement system (RTS-8, China). To investigate the electrochemical characteristics of the counter electrodes, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system in an acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4. The PEDOT:PSS/glass, Pt/FTO or PEDOT/FTO electrode served as working electrodes, while the platinum net and the Ag/AgCl served as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed with an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 1 MHz, the magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. An applied bias voltage was set to the open-circuit voltage of the DSSCs in the dark. Current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun air mass 1.5 G (100 mV cm−2) illumination provided by a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. The measurement of monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was performed with a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator with a wavelength range from 350 to 800 nm. The active area of TiO2 film was measured using a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1).
3 Results and discussion
EG-treatment was conducted on a pristine spray-coated PEDOT:PSS film to improve its conductivity since EG has been reported as an efficient secondary dopant for conductive PEDOT:PSS film. First, the sheet resistances of all samples were characterized by the four-point probe system. As shown in Fig. 1, the pristine PEDOT:PSS/Glass film (sample I) with a thickness of 781 nm showed a very large sheet resistance of 2.6 × 104 Ω □−1. After the EG-treatment, the corresponding sheet resistance dramatically decreased to 17.2 Ω □−1, which is very close to that of FTO glass (14.0 Ω □−1). This value is quite a bit lower than the previous result which also used EG as secondary dopant to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film.31 We attribute the present low sheet resistance to the special spray-coating modification process in which the interaction between polymer chain and EG molecules should be enhanced, thus leading to the formation of a better conductive pathway. Moreover, the PEDOT:PSS film showed a large increase in conductivity of about 3 orders of magnitudes from 0.49 S cm−1 to 1053 S cm−1. It is noticeable that the thickness of EG-treated PEDOT:PSS/Glass film (sample II) decreased from 781 nm to 552 nm, this may be attributed to the morphology changes of the PEDOT:PSS polymer chains and the depletion of PSS when treated by EG. The high conductivity of EG-treated PEDOT:PSS film makes it possible to work as a FTO-free electrode material, which can greatly lower the price of the electrode. After the electrodeposition of PEDOT catalytic layer on the EG-treated PEDOT:PSS/Glass film (sample III), the thickness of the film increased to 1270 nm, and the sheet resistance decreased gradually to 15.5 Ω □−1. This value is quite comparable to those of Pt/FTO and PEDOT/FTO film, which are 14.3 Ω □−1 and 14.6 Ω □−1, respectively.

The surface morphology of the films was characterized by taping-mode AFM. Fig. 2 shows the topography and phase images of the pristine, EG-treated PEDOT:PSS film, and electrodeposited PEDOT film, respectively, with an area of 1 × 1 μm2. As shown in Fig. 2b and d, the morphology of pristine PEDOT:PSS film become rougher after the EG treatment, and grains with diameters of about 30 nm on average can be observed on the surface, indicating a conformational change happened to PEDOT and PSS chains during the solvent treatment. The corresponding phase images of PEDOT:PSS films before and after EG-treatment are shown in Fig. 2a and c. In the phase images the bright regions correspond to the rigid and high conductivity PEDOT-rich areas, while the dark regions can be assigned to soft and low conductivity PSS-rich regions.30,44 It is clear that the EG-treatment induces the phase separation between PEDOT and PSS chains and the networks of bright PEDOT regions become better interconnected after EG-treatment, indicating that better charge transport pathways form in the films and thereby a great improvement of conductivity is achieved. In addition, the change of PEDOT:PSS chains from a coil conformation to an expanded conformation during the solvent treatment may also contribute to the enhanced charge transport pathways. After electrodeposition of PEDOT catalytic layer, a rougher and more granular layer formed on the top of the PEDOT:PSS film, and PEDOT particles with a diameter of around 110 nm on average can be clearly observed (Fig. 2e and f). This morphology change can also be confirmed by SEM images of the films (see ESI, Fig. S1†). The phase images of the PEDOT layer shows that the bright regions of PEDOT particles are closely connected to each other. This well-connected conducting network can provide superior pathways for charge transportation, leading to a smaller sheet resistance than sample II.

The pristine and EG-treated PEDOT:PSS films were also characterized by XPS to further investigate the mechanism of conductivity enhancement by the EG-treatment. Due to the different chemical environments, the S (2p) electrons of PEDOT and PSS show different binding energies in their XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 3, the S (2p) spectra display two XPS contributions for both samples. The peak with a binding energy between 166 and 172 eV is attributed to the sulfur signal of PSS, while the doublet peak between 162 and 166 eV corresponds to the sulfur of PEDOT. It is clear that after the EG treatment the S (2p) signal ratio of PEDOT to PSS increases obviously compared to the pristine films, showing that PSS content is greatly reduced as a result of EG-treatment.27,44 This may be attributed to the depletion of insulating PSS chains from the surface of the PEDOT:PSS films. In summary, the conductivity enhancement of the EG-treated films can be explained by the microphase separation and conformational changes of PEDOT:PSS chains, and the depletion of PSS during the EG-treatment process.

To obtain the electrocatalytic activity of different films, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to measure their catalytic activity towards the I−/I3− redox reaction with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The scanning range was −0.4 to 1.4 V versus Ag/AgCl. As shown in Fig. 4b, two pairs of peaks are obtained for Pt- and TCO-free CE (sample III), Pt/FTO and PEDOT/FTO film. Typically, the two peaks Aox and Ared correspond to the oxidation and reduction of I−/I2, while the peaks Box and Bred refer to the reduction of I−/I3−.34,45 Here we focus on the peak Box and Bred since the counter electrode is responsible for the reduction of I3− in DSSCs. Compared to sample III, sample II shows a much lower peak current density, and the disappearance of the peak Bred indicates the EG-treated PEDOT:PSS film has a poor catalytic activity towards the I−/I3− redox couple (Fig. 4a). However, sample I shows no electrocatalytic activity towards the redox couple, this can be blamed on the low conductivity and poor electron transport network of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film. Therefore, the enhancement of the conductivity of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film and the electrodeposition of the highly catalytic PEDOT layer are necessary to obtain an efficient counter electrode for DSSCs. Fig. 4b clearly shows that both the PEDOT/FTO and sample III films can effectively catalyze the reduction of I3− as the traditional pyrolyzed Pt/FTO counter electrode does, indicating that the electrodeposited PEDOT has comparable catalytic activity to Pt, and the polymer based TCO-free electrode can show a comparable performance to the FTO electrode. This result could also be confirmed by the charge transfer resistance obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement as described below.

To further understand the performance of these counter electrodes in solar cells, EIS was used to measure the sheet resistance (Rs) and charge transfer process (Rct) of the corresponding cells. Fig. 5 shows the Nyquist plots of different CE based cells. The first small semicircle arising in the high frequency region represents the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) related to the catalytic activity of CEs for the reduction of I3−, while the second large semicircle in the middle frequency region represents the recombination resistance between the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interfaces.46,47 Both the values of Rs and Rct were analyzed by Z-view software using an equivalent circuit containing resistance (R), and constant phase element (CPE) (Fig. 5, inset), and are summarized in Table 1. The Rs values of sample III and sample II are 28.56 Ω and 33.52 Ω, respectively, both of them are higher than that of Pt/FTO (20.81 Ω) and PEDOT/FTO (21.64 Ω), which may be caused by the slightly lower conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film compared to FTO. Besides, due to the higher conductivity of PEDOT catalytic layer which entirely consists of conductive PEDOT without insulating PSS, the Rs of sample III decreases a little compared to sample II. In contrast, the Rs of sample I is too large to be measured due to its very poor conductivity. As far as the electron transfer resistance was concerned, the Rct of sample I (11895 Ω, the large plot of sample I is not shown here) is quite large, indicating it shows very poor catalytic activity towards the reduction of I3−, which is in agreement with the CV measurement. After EG-treatment and electrodeposition of PEDOT in turn, the Rct of sample I decreases dramatically to 29.47 Ω for sample II, and finally reaches 4.34 Ω for sample III, a value which is even smaller than that of Pt/FTO, indicating that the catalytic activity of PEDOT/PEDOT:PSS/Glass electrode is comparable or even slightly greater than the Pt counter electrode.

The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs based on these counter electrodes (samples I, II, III, PEDOT/FTO, Pt/FTO) are shown in Fig. 6, and the related details of photovoltaic parameters including short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), overall energy conversion efficiency (η) and fill factor (FF) are listed in Table 1, here cell I, II and III refer to the cells using samples I, II and III as the counter electrodes, respectively. It can be seen that both cell I and II show very low FF (0.25 and 0.24, respectively) due to their poor catalytic activity. However, compared with cell I, the Jsc of cell II increases obviously, accompanied by an apparent enhancement of η from 0.08% to 2.74%, proving that the EG-treatment is necessary to modify the charge transport network of pristine PEDOT:PSS film. After a highly catalytic PEDOT layer was deposited on the EG-treated PEDOT:PSS film and further fabricated as cell III, it is noticeable that the FF was greatly increased from 0.24 to 0.64, with the Jsc further increasing from 14.57 to 17.09 mA cm−2. As a result, an outstanding efficiency of 8.33% for cell III was achieved. When comparing with Pt/FTO and PEDOT/FTO electrode based cells, cell III shows the same FF but slightly lower Jsc than the other two FTO-based DSSCs, this may be attributed to the slightly lower conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film than FTO.

Fig. 7 presents the monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs based on different CEs as a function of wavelength from 350 nm to 800 nm (the spectrum of cell I was too poor to be measured and is not shown). The quantum efficiency of all cells with N719 dye are maximized at about 520 nm. Compared to cell II, the IPCE of cell III increases from 74% to 76% at around 520 nm, this can be mainly attributed to the higher catalytic ability and higher conductivity of the electrodeposited PEDOT layer on the PEDOT:PSS film. Besides, a red-shift to a longer wavelength from 550 nm to 750 nm can be observed. The IPCE of cell III is a little lower than Pt/FTO and PEDOT/FTO, corresponding to the slightly lower Jsc showed in the J–V curves.

4 Conclusions
A novel low-cost counter electrode for DSSCs was fabricated by employing conductivity enhanced PEDOT:PSS as conductive film and electrodeposited PEDOT layer as catalytic material. The conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS film via solvent treatment was verified by AFM and XPS measurements, revealing that the phase separation between PEDOT and PSS, and the depletion of PSS during the EG-treatment process contributed to the enhanced conducting pathways for carriers. CV and EIS demonstrated that the PEDOT layer showed comparable catalytic activity to the I−/I3− redox couple as a traditional pyrolyzed Pt electrode did. The DSSC based on this novel CE showed a high energy conversion efficiency of 8.33%, accompanied by Jsc of 17.09 mA cm−2, Voc of 761 mV and FF of 0.64. To our knowledge, this is the highest conversion efficiency of DSSCs with FTO- and Pt-free CEs reported so far. The present method provides a new pathway to fabricate TCO- and Pt-free CEs for low-cost, highly efficient DSSCs, which also exhibit potential applications in flexible photovoltaic devices.
