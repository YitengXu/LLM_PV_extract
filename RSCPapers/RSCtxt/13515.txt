    , Accepted 15th May 2019First published on 16th May 2019AbstractNanotubes/nanowires assembled from TiO2 nanoflakes with exposed {111} facets were prepared via heating a mixture of titanium(IV) oxysulfate–sulfuric acid hydrate, glacial acetic acid and water. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of the as-prepared TiO2 nanoflake based nanotubes/nanowires was remarkably increased through hydrogenation. The apparent quantum yield for CH4 evolution of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires is as high as 17.4%, which is higher than that of all the TiO2 based photocatalysts reported until now. The excellent photocatalytic performance is ascribed to the exposed clean TiO2 {111} facets and enhanced solar absorption. On the basis of the polar structure of the exposed TiO2 {111} crystal facets, we proposed a separation mechanism of photocreated electrons and holes. A spontaneous electric field (Es) is created between polar TiO2 (111) and () planes. Under Es, the photocreated electrons and holes transit to TiO2 (111) and () surfaces, respectively. Redox reactions selectively take place at the Ti–TiO2 (111) and O–TiO2 () polar planes. The charge separation mechanism provides a clear insight for understanding the photocatalysis of high performance semiconductor nanocrystals and offers guidance for the design of high performance photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.
Introduction
Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is regarded as an attractive strategy to solve the worldwide energy shortage and environmental crises issues caused by CO2 released when using fossil fuels.1 In 1978, Hemminger et al. reported the first observation of the photocatalytic reaction of gas phase H2O and CO2 on SrTiO3 (111) surfaces to form CH4.2 Later the photoelectrocatalytic reactions of H2O and CO2 to form HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH and CH4 on WO3, TiO2, ZnO, CdS, GaP and SiC semiconductors were reported.3 Since then, various semiconductors were employed as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction, including ZnO,4 WO3,5 BiWO4,6,7 BiOCl,8 ZnIn2S4,9 Zn2GeO4,10 NaNbO3,11 Ni-doped ZnCo2O4 (ref. 12) and TiO2.13–47
Among the applied semiconductor photocatalysts, TiO2 is one of the most widely studied photocatalytic materials, owing to its low cost, non-toxicity, harmlessness, high chemical stability and high photocatalytic activity.24 In recent years, TiO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of about 14 nm,13 TiO2 pellets,14 mesoporous TiO2,15 oxygen-deficient TiO2 nanosheets,16 anatase TiO2 nanocubes,17 Ti3+-self doped brookite TiO2 nanosheets,18 mixed-phase TiO2 (ref. 19) and anatase TiO2 nanorods loaded with rutile TiO2 nanocrystals,20 TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {100} facets,21 TiO2 nanosheets having {001} facets22 and TiO2 nanocrystallites with co-exposed {001} and {101} facets23 were found to show enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. Moreover, various strategies have been employed to increase the photocatalytic activities of TiO2 nanomaterials for the reduction of CO2, including: doping Ce3+,25 Co2+,26 Pd2+ (ref. 27) and In3+ (ref. 28) metal ions, loading Ru,29 Pt,30–32 Ag,33,34 and Cu35 nanoparticles, Au–Cu36 and Au–Ru37 alloy nanoparticles, modifying with AgBr nanocrystals38 and La2O3 nanoparticles,39 forming TiO2 nanosheet coated Si nanospheres,40 CuO–TiO2 hollow microspheres41 and 3D ordered macroporous CeO2–TiO2 heterogeneous structures42 and co-decorating with Cu and PbS,43 Pt and CdSe,44 and Pt and MgO nanoparticles45,46 as well as Pt and Cu2O nanoparticles.47 However, to date, there has been no report on nanotubes/nanowires assembled from TiO2 nanoflakes with exposed {111} crystal facets for photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the literature. The surface energy of the anatase TiO2 {111} crystal facets is as high as 1.61 J m−2, which is higher than 0.44 J m−2 of {101}, 0.90 J m−2 of {001} and 0.53 J m−2 of {010}.48 Thus, nanostructures constructed with TiO2 nanoflakes with {111} facets may be an excellent candidate photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. Moreover, the detailed mechanism for the crystal facet enhanced photocatalysis for CO2 reduction is yet unknown.
Herein, we report on the preparation of nanotubes/nanowires constructed with TiO2 nanoflakes with exposed {111} crystal facets. The TiO2 nanoflake based nanotubes/nanowires exhibit higher photocatalytic CO2 reduction activities than commercial TiO2 powder (Degussa P25). The photocatalytic activity can further be enhanced by optimizing the (111) surface structure through hydrogenation. The apparent quantum yield for CH4 evolution of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires is as high as 17.4%, which is higher than that of all the TiO2 based photocatalysts reported until now. Based on the atomic structure of anatase TiO2 polar {111} planes, we put forward a charge separation mechanism between Ti–TiO2 (111) and O–TiO2 () polar planes to expound the excellent activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
Experimental section
Materials preparation
The TiO2 nanoflake based nanotubes/nanowires were obtained by heating a mixture of titanium(IV) oxysulfate–sulfuric acid hydrate (TiOSO4·xH2SO4·xH2O), glacial acetic acid and deionized water. In a typical process, a Si wafer was ultrasonically cleaned in deionized H2O and C2H5OH for 10 min, respectively. 0.100 g of TiOSO4·xH2SO4·xH2O, 5.0 mL of glacial acetic acid and 5.0 mL of deionized water were in turn added into a 25.0 mL breaker. The as-obtained mixture was agitated for 5 min, forming a white suspension. One drop of the suspension was put on the clean Si substrate in a quartz boat. The quartz boat was heated in a horizontal tube furnace for 10 min at 650 °C. Thus, a white product was harvested. The as-fabricated TiO2 samples were heated at 650 °C for 6–18 h under a flowing H2 gas (2.0 L h−1) to prepare hydrogenated TiO2 samples.
Characterization of materials
The morphology of the as-obtained hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated TiO2 nanostructures was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (SU8020, Hitachi). The crystal structure and morphology of the non-hydrogenated and hydrogenated TiO2 nanostructures were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (DX-2700, Haoyuan, Dandong, China, Cu Kα1 radiation λ = 1.54056 Å) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-3010, JEOL). The specific surface area was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, using a surface analytical instrument (ASAP 2020, America Micromeritics) by N2 gas adsorption. The surface structures were analyzed using infrared spectroscopy (IR) (Tensor 27, Bruker) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Axis ultra DLD, Kratos).
Measurement of photocatalytic activity
The activity measurement for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O over TiO2 catalysts was performed in a 100 mL stainless-steel reactor with a quartz window on the top of the reactor. The reactor used for the photocatalytic reaction is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Typically, 10.0 mg of the as-synthesized TiO2 catalysts, 4 mL of deionized water and 1 mL of isopropanol were added into the reactor. The pressure of CO2 was regulated at 0.2 MPa.
The reactor was heated at 323–423 K for 5 h under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF 300, Zhongjiaojinyuan, Beijing, China). After the photocatalytic reaction, the amounts of CO, CH4 and H2 formed from H2O and CO2 were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) (GC-9560, Huaai, Ar carrier). A flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) are adopted for quantifying the amounts of CO and CH4 as well as the amount of H2, respectively.
Results and discussion
The TiO2 nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires
The XRD pattern from the as-fabricated TiO2 nanostructures is given in Fig. 1a. All diffraction lines can be attributed to tetragonal anatase TiO2. The different magnification SEM images of the TiO2 samples are displayed in Fig. 1b–f. The SEM observations suggest that the as-fabricated TiO2 samples consist of large amounts of one-dimensional TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires with lengths in the range of 100 to 450 μm. The inner and outer diameters of the TiO2 nanotubes are in the range of 850 to 1020 and 930 to 1130 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1d and e. The diameters of the nanowires are in the range of 180 to 530 nm, as shown in Fig. 1e and f.

Fig. 2 and 3 show the TEM analysis results of the TiO2 nanowires and nanotubes, respectively. Fig. 2a and b present different magnification TEM images of a single TiO2 nanowire with a diameter of about 400 nm, which indicates that the nanowire is assembled from nanoflakes with diameters in the range of 30 to 40 nm. Fig. 2c and d show the HRTEM image and corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern from the boxed region in (b), respectively. The lattice spacing of 0.35 nm corresponds to the distance between two adjacent (101) or (011) planes, and the intersection angle between (011) and (101) planes is 82°, as shown in Fig. 2c. The FFT pattern shown in Fig. 2d reveals that the constituent TiO2 nanoflake is enclosed by top (111) and bottom () crystallographic facets48Fig. 3a presents the TEM image of a single TiO2 nanotube with a diameter of about 1.2 μm. Fig. 3b–i show HRTEM images and corresponding FFT patterns from the boxes I, II, III and IV in (a), respectively. It is clear that these HRTEM images and FFT patterns are the same as the HRTEM image and FFT pattern in Fig. 2c and d. The results fully confirm that the TiO2 nanowires and nanotubes are constructed from nanoflakes enclosed by top (111) and bottom () crystallographic facets. The schematic illustration of structure is given in Fig. 3j.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and the corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore-size distribution plot (inset) of the as-prepared nanoflake assembled TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires are shown in Fig. S2a.† The isotherm profile is assigned to type IV. A hysteresis loop is observed at relative pressures of 0.6–1.0. The hysteresis loop is indexed to a type H3 loop, suggesting that there are mesopores in the TiO2 samples. The distribution of pore size peaked at about 10 nm. The specific surface area of the as-prepared TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires constructed from nanoflakes with exposed {111} crystal facets measured by the BET method is 119 m2 g−1. Fig. S2b† displays the IR spectrum of the as-obtained TiO2 samples. The two broad bands located at 3434 and 1635 cm−1 can be attributed to the OH stretching and bending vibrations. The bands located at 2921 and 2844 cm−1 correspond to the CH3 asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations.49 The band located at 1120 cm−1 is assigned to the SO42− stretching vibration.50 Fig. S2c and d† show XPS spectra of the as-synthesized TiO2 samples, which suggest that the samples are composed of large amounts of Ti and O elements and a small amount of S element. The peaks at 168.2 and 169.5 eV can be assigned to S(VI) in SO42−.51,52 The XPS and IR spectra show that there is a certain number of OH groups as well as SO42− and CH3COO− ions on the surface of the constituent TiO2 nanoflakes.
Moreover, to understand the formation of the constituent TiO2 nanoflakes with exposed {111} crystal facets, the products synthesized by heating a mixture of tetrabutyl titanate, CH3COOH, H2O and H2SO4 were analyzed with SEM and TEM (Fig. 4). The SEM and TEM observations reveal that the as-obtained products consist of a large amount of TiO2 nanoflakes with diameters ranging from 160 to 230 nm. The nanoflakes are still enclosed by top (111) and bottom () planes.

According to ref. 53 and 54, the crystal structure of TiO2 with a tetragonal structure is shown in Fig. 5a. In the TiO2 crystal lattice, a Ti atom is octahedrally coordinated to six O atoms, and an O atom is coordinated to four Ti atoms. The atomic structure of the tetragonal phase TiO2 {111} crystallographic facets was investigated by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculation,48 and the result is given in Fig. 5b. It is clear that there are three kinds of undercoordinated Ti atoms, 3, 4 and 5-coordinated Ti atoms, on the exposed (111) crystallographic facet. In the reaction system, the OH− groups as well as SO42− and CH3COO− ions may act as ligands to Ti4+, and are adsorbed selectively on the (111) crystal plane of the constituent TiO2 nanoflakes, and the possible structure is displayed in Fig. 5c. The presence of OH−, SO42− and CH3COO− ions restricts the growth of the (111) crystal facet, and as a result, the TiO2 nanoflakes with exposed {111} crystal facets are obtained.

The hydrogenated TiO2 nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires
The as-prepared nanoflake assembled TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires were hydrogenated at 650 °C for 6, 9, 12 and 18 h, respectively, and the as-prepared samples were respectively denoted as TiO2-6, TiO2-9, TiO2-12 and TiO2-18. The SEM image of TiO2-18 and the XRD patterns of these hydrogenated samples are respectively given in Fig. S3a–c.† The SEM image indicates that after the hydrogenation, there is no change in the geometrical morphology of the TiO2 sample, and it still consists of TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires. The XRD patterns reveal that the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires still have a tetragonal anatase crystal structure. In addition, it can be seen from Fig. S3c† that the peak of (101) shifts from 25.28 to 25.13 with increasing hydrogenation time, which is derived from the expansion and distortion of the TiO2 crystal surface lattice.55
Photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 in water
The photocatalytic activities for the reduction of CO2 over the TiO2 nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires in 5.0 mL pure H2O without a sacrificial agent and in isopropanol ((CH3)2CHOH) aqueous solution (1.0 mL (CH3)2CHOH + 4.0 mL H2O) have been studied, and the results are given in Fig. 6. Apparently, the activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction is dramatically improved by employing isopropanol as a sacrificial agent. The effects of reaction temperature on the activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction were investigated, and the results are given in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a–c show the yields of H2, CO and CH4 over the TiO2 nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp. Apparently, when the reaction temperature is increased from 288 to 373 K, the photocatalytic activity is increased. However, as the reaction temperature is increased to 423 K, although the yield of CO is increased slightly, the yields of CH4 and H2 are lowered distinctly. Thus, the reaction temperature is set at 373 K.
 Fig. 6  The (a) H2, (b) CO and (c) CH4 evolution rates over the as-synthesized TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires at different temperatures without isopropanol and with isopropanol. 
The photocatalytic activities for CO2 reduction in the presence of water over P25, hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated TiO2 nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires at 373 K under the irradiation of 300 W Xe lamp were investigated, and the production rates of H2, CO and CH4 over P25, TiO2, TiO2-6, TiO2-9, TiO2-12 and TiO2-18 nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires are displayed in Fig. 7a–c and Table 1, respectively. It was found that the H2 production rate increased in the sequence of P25 < TiO2 < TiO2-6 < TiO2-18 < TiO2-12 < TiO2-9, the CO production rate increased in the sequence of P25 < TiO2 < TiO2-12 < TiO2-9 < TiO2-6 < TiO2-18 and the CH4 production rate followed the order of P25 < TiO2 < TiO2-6 < TiO2-9 < TiO2-18 < TiO2-12. The TiO2-12 nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity for CH4 production, and the production rate of CH4 is as high as 1708.1 μmol g−1 h−1. For comparison, all the CH4 production rates reported in the literature over TiO2 (ref. 13–23) and TiO2 based photocatalysts25–47 are collected and listed in Tables 2 and 3. Apparently, the CH4 evolution rate of TiO2-12 nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires is the highest of all TiO2 photocatalysts, and significantly higher than that of the majority of TiO2 based photocatalysts, being only lower than that of the solid–gas reaction system of TiO2 powder loaded with Au–Cu alloy nanoparticles.36 To evaluate the photocatalytic activity, the photogenerated electrons used for the formation of H2, CO and CH4 were calculated, and the results are given in Fig. 7d and Table 1. It is obvious that the photocatalytic activity increases in the order of P25 < TiO2 < TiO2-6 < TiO2-9 < TiO2-12 < TiO2-18, indicating that the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of TiO2 nanostructures can be remarkably increased by hydrogenation.

 Fig. 7  (a–c) The H2, CO and CH4 evolution rates and (d) The production rates of the photogenerated electrons used for the formation of H2, CO and CH4 over P25 and non-hydrogenated and hydrogenated TiO2 samples at 373 K. (e) and (f) The rates of CH4 evolution and photogenerated electron production used for the formation of H2, CO and CH4 per unit area over P25 and non-hydrogenated and hydrogenated TiO2 samples at 373 K. 
To judge the photocatalytic activity of the five kinds of TiO2 samples, the specific surface areas of P25, TiO2-6, TiO2-9, TiO2-12 and TiO2-18 were measured by the BET method, and the result is 50, 116, 124, 118 and 109 m2 g−1, respectively. The CH4 production rates and the photocreated electrons for the reductive reactions per unit area of P25, TiO2-6, TiO2-9, TiO2-12 and TiO2-18 photocatalysts were examined, and the results are displayed in Fig. 7e and f, respectively. Obviously, the CH4 evolution rate per unit area increases in the order of P25 < TiO2 < TiO2-6 < TiO2-9 < TiO2-18 < TiO2-12. The photocreated electrons for the reductive reactions per unit area follow the sequence of P25 < TiO2 < TiO2-6 < TiO2-9 < TiO2-12 < TiO2-18.
The stability and reusability of the TiO2 photocatalysts were studied by using TiO2-12 as a catalyst, and the result is shown Fig. 8a. It was seen that after four cycles the CH4 evolution rate reduces from 1708 to 1433 μmol g−1 h−1. The H2 and CO evolution rates are in the range of 1.18 to 2.11 μmol g−1 h−1 and 433 to 591 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, indicating that the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires exhibit good photocatalytic stability.

(d) Comparison of the TiO2-12 sample and TiO2 based photocatalysts for CH4 generation through CO2 reduction reported until now. 
In addition, to distinguish the effects of photocatalysis and thermal catalysis, the thermocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction in the presence of water over TiO2-12 at 373 K without Xe lamp irradiation was investigated, and the result is shown in Fig. 8b. It was found that the H2, CO and CH4 evolution rates at 373 K are respectively 1.13, 52.0 and 463.5 μmol g−1 h−1 without light illumination, which are clearly lower that the corresponding gas evolution rates under the irradiation of a Xe lamp as shown in Fig. 7a–c. Apparently, light illumination indeed can facilitate the thermocatalytic CO2 reduction in the presence of water.
The apparent quantum yields of the TiO2-12 photocatalyst for H2, CO and CH4 have been measured, and the detailed measurement and the result are respectively shown in the ESI† and Fig. 8c. As shown in Fig. 8c, the apparent quantum yields for H2, CO and CH4 are 0.005%, 0.9% and 17.4%, respectively. The apparent quantum yield for CH4 of 17.4% is higher than that of all the TiO2 based photocatalysts reported until now.
Absorption spectra and surface structure

Fig. 9a shows optical photographs of the non-hydrogenated TiO2 samples and hydrogenated TiO2-18 samples, which indicate that after hydrogenation the color of the nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires is changed from white to soil gray. Fig. 9b shows UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated TiO2 nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires. The absorption edge is shifted to longer wavelengths with an increase in the hydrogenation time. For the anatase TiO2 semiconductor with an indirect band gap,56 the optical absorption near the band edge obeyed the equation:57αhν = A(hν − Eg)2where A, α, ν, and Eg are respectively a constant, the absorption coefficient, the frequency of light and the band gap energy. The value of band gap energy (Eg) of TiO2, TiO2-6, TiO2-9, TiO2-12 and TiO2-18 is estimated from the plot of (αhν)1/2versus hν, and the result is found to be 3.40, 3.01, 2.75, 2.69 and 2.64 eV, respectively (Fig. 9c).

Fig. 10a shows IR spectra of the five kinds of TiO2 samples. Obviously, the number of surface OH groups as well as SO42− and CH3COO− ions is reduced with prolonging hydrogenation time. After hydrogenation for 6 h, the surface sulfate ions are completely removed. When the hydrogenation time is increased to 12 h, the CH3COO− ions are fully dislodged. Fig. 10b and c show the survey and S 2p XPS spectra. It is obvious that the S 2p peak at about 168.2 eV from SO42− ions fully disappears after hydrogenation for 6 h (Fig. 10c). Fig. 10d–h show Ti 2p XPS spectra of the five kinds of TiO2 samples. In the Ti XPS spectra, typical Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks of Ti4+ were observed,58,59 and the binding energy is located at 456.1 and 462.3 eV, respectively. Moreover, for the hydrogenated samples, a weak peak of Ti3+ located at 454.6–455.1 eV was detected,55 and the intensity of the peak becomes stronger and stronger as the hydrogenation time increases, suggesting that more unsaturated Ti atoms were generated on the (111) surface of the hydrogenated TiO2 samples. The concentration of the surface unsaturated Ti atoms increases in the sequence of TiO2 < TiO2-6 < TiO2-9 < TiO2-12 < TiO2-18. Therefore, when the nanoflake assembled nanotubes/nanowires were hydrogenated, the SO42− and CH3COO− ions as well as O–H groups on the (111) surfaces are removed in turn, and as a result, a clean TiO2 (111) surface is obtained. The chemical reactions occurring at the (111) surface are shown in Fig. 11. Thus, we speculated that the clean TiO2 {111} crystallographic facets should be photocatalytic reactive surfaces for the reduction of CO2 with H2O.

Charge separation between TiO2 (111) and () polar surfaces
The atomic structure and charge distribution in the TiO2 [111] direction obtained by periodic DFT calculations48 are shown in Fig. 12a. Obviously, in the [111] direction, the Ti and O atoms are not located at the same atom layer. Each atom layer contains all Ti4+ ions or all O2− ions. Thus, the exposed anatase TiO2 {111} planes are polar surfaces, and [111] is a spontaneous polar direction. The (111) polar plane is terminated with positive 3, 4 and 5-coordinated Ti atoms. The () polar plane is terminated with negative O atoms. Thus, we concluded that there is a spontaneous electric field (Es) between the positive Ti–TiO2 (111) and negative O–TiO2 () polar surfaces.

(b) Generation of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the constituent TiO2 nanoflake. (c) The schematic illustrations of charge separation between Ti–TiO2 (111) and O–TiO2 () polar surfaces under Es and photocatalytic reactions. 
When the nanotubes/nanowires assembled from nanoflakes with exposed {111} facets were used as photocatalysts for the conversion of CO2, electrons located in the valence band were excited to the conduction band via absorption of light, and thus photoinduced electrons and holes were formed in the constituent TiO2 nanoflakes, as shown in Fig. 12b. Under Es, the photoinduced electrons and holes migrated to the positive Ti–TiO2 (111) and negative O–TiO2 () polar surfaces (Fig. 12c), respectively. On the Ti–TiO2 (111) surface, H2O and CO2 were first reduced to H2 and CO by the photoinduced electrons. Subsequently, the H2 and CO were further reduced to CH4. On the O–TiO2 () surface, the surface adsorbed H2O was oxidized by the photoinduced holes to ˙OH radical, and then, the isopropanol sacrificing agent was oxidized by the ˙OH radicals to CO2 and H2O.60 The photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reactions are described as
On the Ti–TiO2 (111) surface H+ + e− → H2(1) CO2 + e− → CO(2) CO + H2 + e− → CH4 + H2O(3)
On the O–TiO2 () surface H2O + h+ → ˙OH + H+(4) ˙OH + (CH3)2CH(OH) → CO2 + H2O(5)
The nanotubes/nanowires assembled from TiO2 nanoflakes with exposed clean {111} crystal facets showed excellent photocatalytic activity in CO2 reduction due to good charge separation. Moreover, the current–voltage (I–V) curve and photoelectrochemical properties of the hydrogenated, non-hydrogenated TiO2 and p25 films have been measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 13. The fabrication of the TiO2 photocatalyst films and the measurements of the I–V and photoelectrochemical properties are described in the ESI.†Fig. 13a shows the (I–V) curves of P25, TiO2, TiO2-6, TiO2-9, TiO2-12 and TiO2-18 films. The TiO2 photocatalyst films were found to demonstrate asymmetric I–V curves. The current in forward bias increases in the order of P25 < TiO2 < TiO2-6 < TiO2-9 < TiO2-12 < TiO2-18. The current in reverse bias decreases in the same order. The TiO2-12 and TiO2-18 films show typical diode properties, which reveal that there is an Es between the Ti–TiO2 (111) top and O–TiO2 () bottom surfaces. In forward bias, the directions of the Es and applied bias are the same. The Es promotes the flow of charge. Thus, a very large forward current is produced, as shown in Fig. 13b. Under reverse bias conditions, the directions of the Es and applied bias are opposite. The Es inhibits the transfer of charge, and a very small reverse current is thus observed, as shown in Fig. 13c. The result is consistent with that of the [001] orientated ZnO thin film and [111] orientated Cu2O/Cu2Se nanowire film.61,62Fig. 13d shows the transient photocurrent responses of the P25, TiO2, TiO2-6, TiO2-9, TiO2-12 and TiO2-18 films under UV light irradiation. Apparently, the photocurrent response increases in the sequence of P25 < TiO2 < TiO2-6 < TiO2-9 < TiO2-12 < TiO2-18. Like the diode rectification effect, the enhancement of photocurrent may arise from the increase in Es. For non-hydrogenated TiO2 samples, the OH groups as well as SO42− and CH3COO− ions were adsorbed on the Ti–TiO2 (111) surface of the constituent TiO2 nanoflakes, and the positive charge of the Ti–TiO2 (111) surface and Es between (111) and () polar surfaces decrease. Thus, the non-hydrogenated TiO2 samples showed lower diode rectification, photocurrent response and photocatalytic activity in CO2 reduction than the hydrogenated TiO2 samples. The charge separation mechanism between the Ti–TiO2 (111) and O–TiO2 () polar surfaces is supported by the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Cu2O/Cu2Se,60 ZnO,61–63 CdTe,64 NiO,65 and CoO66 polar crystal facets. In addition, as shown in Fig. 9c and d, the hydrogenated TiO2 samples have lower Eg values than the non-hydrogenated samples. Therefore, the hydrogenated TiO2 nanostructures have superior solar absorption, photocatalytic activity in CO2 reduction and photocurrent response, compared with the non-hydrogenated samples.

Conclusion
In summary, we successfully fabricated nanotubes/nanowires assembled from anatase TiO2 nanoflakes with exposed {111} facets. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of the nanotubes/nanowires was significantly increased by hydrogenation. The apparent quantum yield for CH4 evolution of the hydrogenated TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires is as high as 17.4%, which is higher than that of all the TiO2 based photocatalysts reported until now. The enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity originated from the clean TiO2 {111} crystal facets. Based on the atomic structure of TiO2 polar {111} planes, we put forward a charge separation mechanism between the Ti–TiO2 (111) and O–TiO2 () polar surfaces. The charge separation mechanism presents a new insight into the in-depth understanding of photocatalysis of high performance semiconductor photocatalysts for CO2 reduction and the design of a high efficiency photocatalyst and solar cell.
