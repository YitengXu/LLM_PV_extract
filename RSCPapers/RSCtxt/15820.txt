By spin-coating 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C16MIm]PF6) or 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C16MIm]BF4) on the PH1000 film, half of the insulating PSS on the top surface of PH1000 could be successfully removed and the PEDOT formed an ordered and continuous molecular packing. The conductivity of PH1000 dramatically increased from 0.4 S cm−1 to 1457.7 S cm−1 for PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 and 1243.8 S cm−1 for PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4. At the same time, spontaneous orientation of the liquid-crystalline ionic liquids with liquid-crystallinity further promoted the ordered packing arrangement of both PH1000 and the active layer. The power conversion efficiency based on PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 and PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 as the anode is comparable to that obtained from the device with indium tin oxide (ITO) as the anode. In addition, liquid-crystalline ionic liquids modification is also good for the energy alignment, facilitating charge injection and transport, without any extra hole transport layer. Furthermore, these novel liquid-crystalline ionic liquids modification PH1000 anodes have potential applications in the fabrication of ITO-free large-area flexible printed polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs), known as one of the “printed electronics,” have received considerable attention in recent years, due to their advantages of light weight, mechanical flexibility, portability, and potential for low-cost production of electronic devices fabricated by a continuous solution-based roll-to-roll process.1,2 To date, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs single cells is over 10%.3,4 Currently, fabricating the high-performance devices mostly depend on indium tin oxide (ITO) as transparent electrodes. However, ITO has intrinsic problems such as high mechanical brittleness, scarce indium on Earth, poor adhesion to organic and polymeric materials and inferior physical properties for high temperature treatment.5 Therefore, to meet the requirement of the roll-to-roll technique and commercialized production, there is a strong demand for new transparent conductivity materials to replace traditional ITOs.
Numerous conductivity materials have been applied as transparent electrodes in recent years, including conducting polymers,6,7 new transparent metal oxide,8 functional carbon materials9,10 metal nanowires,11–13 and metal grids.14 Among them, conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, PH1000) has been considered as a promising candidate to replace ITO due to its good optical transparency, solution processability and good mechanical flexibility. Moreover, it can be applied to the top transparent electrode by the film-transfer method. The high content of insulating species PSS in pristine PEDOT:PSS always leads to a low conductivity. Doped and post-treatment with various materials, such as organic solvents,15,16 surfactant,17,18 zwitterion,19 and sulfuric acids,7 are found to have dramatically enhanced the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. PEDOT:PSS doped with acid treated carbon nanotubes is demonstrated to obtain a high conductivity of 3264.27 S cm−1,20 and the H2SO4 post-treated sample has achieved the highest conductivity of 4380 S cm−1,21 which can be used as an anode for PSCs and as transfer-printing method fabricated all-plastic electrodes.22 Although the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS has improved through the abovementioned methods, most of the treatment processes suffer from the difficulty to perform.
Ionic liquids are organic/inorganic salts with negligible vapor pressure, good chemical stability and low flammability. Dobbelin et al. reported an increase of conductivity by adding ionic liquid to PEDOT:PSS.23 Later, Badre et al. studied the influence of several ionic liquids on the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS24 and found that the addition of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate to PEDOT:PSS can remarkably improve the conductivity to a high value of 2084 S cm−1. They demonstrated that the conductivity enhancement resulted from a depletion of insulating PSS and the formation of highly conductive PEDOT domains. Liquid-crystalline ionic liquids (LCILs), a classic of ionic liquids with liquid crystalline property, not only possess the high conductivity of ionic liquid but also present the spontaneous orientation of molecules, which can further optimize conductivity. For example, liquid-crystalline ionic liquid 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C16MIm]PF6) shows increased conductivity upon heating with 2.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 100 °C and 2.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 120 °C.25 LCILs may induce PEDOT to form ordered microstructure, resulting in an increase of the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS. Inspired by this, herein, two LCILs, [C16MIm]PF6 and 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C16MIm]BF4) are employed to modify PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) films as transparent anodes (PH1000/LCIL) for high performance ITO-free devices (the device architectures and chemical structures of two LCILs are shown in Fig. 1). Spin-coating LCILs solution on the surface of PH1000 films can effectively reduce the content of insulating PSS on top of PH1000 films, favoring assembly of PEDOT with ordered microstructure. The spontaneous orientation of LCILs with liquid crystalline property can further promote the ordered, continuously molecular packing of PEDOT, resulting in a dramatically improved conductivity of LCIL modified PH1000 electrode. Moreover, LCILs in the interface of the anode and active layer can also increase crystallinity of the upper active layer. As a result, ITO-free devices with PH1000/LCILs as the transparent anode has realized a significantly improved performance compared with the one with pristine PH1000. In addition, the better energy alignment developed PH1000/LCILs anode can further simplify the ITO-device structure without incorporation of any extra hole transport layer (HTL).

2. Results and discussion
Filtered PH1000 was spin-coated on a glass by 1000 rpm for 60 s, and the obtained film with thickness about 80 nm was annealed on a hot plate in ambient atmosphere at 120 °C for 20 min. Then, the liquid-crystalline ionic liquids (LCILs) [C16MIm]PF6 or [C16MIm]BF4 with a concentration of 1.75 mg mL−1 (in DMF) were spin-coated onto the dried PH1000 films to prepare LCILs modified PH1000 films, followed by annealing on a hot plate in an ambient atmosphere at 125 °C for 25 min. The details of fabrication are described in the experimental section. Fig. S1† compares the transmittance of PH1000, PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 and PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 films on a quartz substrate. LCILs modified PH1000 films show the transmittance of approaching to 90%, similar to the untreated film, indicating that LCILs treatment has little influence on the transparency of the PH1000 films.
The work functions of PH1000 with and without the LCILs treatment were measured by the Kelvin probe method (Fig. S2a and Table S1†). The work function of the pristine PH1000 is in accordance with the reported value.26 Comparing with that of pristine PH1000, the work function of PH1000 with [C16MIm]PF6 and [C16MIm]BF4 modification slightly decrease. As shown in Fig. S2b,† the work function value indicated that the modified film was still a good hole injection material for a polymer donor (such as P3HT). The same result was also obtained by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements (Fig. S3 and Table S1†).
The hydrophilic property of PH1000 layers before and after modification of LCILs is measured by contact angle measurement, as shown in Fig. S4.† The pristine PH1000 film shows the hydrophilic property with a contact angle of 64°. When the PH1000 film is modified by LCILs of [C16MIm]PF6 and [C16MIm]BF4, the contact angles are enhanced to 80° and 78°, respectively, due to the hydrophobic property of LCILs. The hydrophobic surface can promote the formation of intimate contact between the electrode and active layer and protect the device from oxygen and water attack, consequently leading to the improved charge injection and device stability.
Since LCILs can influence the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, a four point probe was performed to investigate the conductivity change of PH1000 before and after LCILs modification. Pristine PH1000 shows an electrical conductivity of 0.4 S cm−1 with a high sheet resistance of 3.15 × 105 Ω sq−1. After being modified by LCILs, the conductivity of PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 remarkably increases to 1457.7 S cm−1 with a sharply dropped sheet resistance of 98 Ω sq−1. Moreover, [C16MIm]BF4 also exerts similar influence on the conductivity of PH1000, i.e., PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 achieves an improved conductivity of 1243.8 S cm−1 with a reduced sheet resistance of 134 Ω sq−1 (Fig. 2 and Table S2†).

To explore the conductivity enhancement and determine the role of LCILs, the nature of the liquid crystal was observed by polarized optical microscopy (POM) (Fig. S5†). Compared to pristine PH1000 film without any birefringence, PH1000/LCIL films show an obvious bright liquid crystal phase, illustrating an ordered packing arrangement of the molecules. Such ordered molecular packing is very helpful for the enhancement of the film conductivity. Moreover, the liquid crystal phase in PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 film is brighter than that in the PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 film, indicating a better liquid crystalline property. As a result, PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 has a higher conductivity than PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4.
Besides liquid crystalline property, the substantially morphological change is also found to be an important factor for the conductivity enhancement. Fig. 3 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography of a 5 μm × 5 μm area of the pristine PH1000 film and PH1000/LCIL films. In AFM images, all the films have quite smooth surfaces, the bright region is associated with PEDOT domains, and the dark regions denote the soft structure arising from excess PSS.27 After LCILs modification, the dark PSS regions of PH1000 decrease, whereas the bright PEDOT regions increase and become continuous, interpreted as some of the insulating PSS chains in the PH1000 film surface having been removed during spin-coating of LCILs on PH1000. The enrichment of continuous PEDOT domains on the PH1000 film surface can provide the efficient conducting channels for charges, which should be responsible for the enhancement in the conductivity of the modified PH1000 films. These results are consistent with the literature.24 In addition, with respect to PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 film, [C16MIm]PF6 treated films show more larger PEDOT domains (bright domains), thereby causing a further enhancement in the conductivity. The improved morphology and conductivity of the PH1000/LCIL electrode would be favorable for the improvement of the photovoltaic performance.

The morphological change of the LCILs modified PH1000 originating from enrichment of PEDOT by the removal of PSS has been further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement. Fig. 4a and b show the S(2p) and F(1s) XPS spectra of the PH1000 films before and after LCILs treatment. As shown in Fig. 4a, the S(2p) peak observed at the binding energy of 168.0 eV corresponds to the sulfur signal of –SO3H from PSS, whereas the peaks at 164.7 eV and 163.5 eV assign to the sulfur signal from PEDOT. From the figure, we can see that the intensity of peaks of PEDOT after LCILs modification is much stronger than that of an unmodified one, especially for the [C16MIm]PF6 modified film. The ratio of PEDOT to PSS in PH1000 solution is about 1:2.5, but the calculated ratio of PEDOT to PSS in the PH1000 film is 1:4.79, because PSS tends to aggregate on the film surface, resulting in a higher content of PSS on the surface than in the bulk.28,29 However, the ratio of PEDOT to PSS sharply increased to 1:2.36 for the PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 film and 1:2.86 for the PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 film, with 51% and 40% reduction of PSS from the film surface, respectively. Moreover, the peaks of PEDOT shift to lower binding energy, indicative of a strong interaction in the film after modification. These results suggest that half of PSS has been successfully removed and replaced by LCILs due to the interaction between the anion group of LCILs and thiophene units of PEDOT. The removal of the insulator PSS from the PH1000 film surface helps the formation of continuous PEDOT domains and increases conductivity of the LCILs-modified PH1000 films. As shown in Fig. 4b, the peaks of F(1s) can be clearly observed at 686 eV of the PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 film. Table S3† showed the content of the F atom on the films. Compared to the pristine PH1000 film (0.06%), the content of the F atom is 0.65% and 0.12% on the surface of the PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 and PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 film, respectively. The content of the F atom of the pristine PH1000 film is much lower than that of the modification film. Therefore, the F signal of the pristine film must come from the measurement error. These proved the liquid-crystalline ionic liquids stay on the surface of PEDOT:PSS after spin coating, and the amount of [C16MIm]PF6 staying on the surface of the film should be larger than that of [C16MIm]BF4. To investigate the liquid-crystalline ionic liquids acting on the films during spin coating, depth profiling of XPS was carried out. Fig. 4c and e show that the S(2p) peaks of PSS in the films after 60 s and 120 s sputtering are obviously decreased in comparison to the films without etching treatment. Table S3† and Fig. 4d and f show that the F(1s) peaks completely disappeared in both pristine PH1000 film and PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 film after 60 s and 120 s sputtering. However, the content of the F atom is 0.34% and 0.31% of the PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 films after etching for 60 s and 120 s, respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that [C16MIm]PF6 not only affects the surface of the PH1000 film but also acts on the bulk of the film; however, the [C16MIm]BF4 modification only affects the surface of the PH1000 film. The results of XPS depth profiling indicated that [C16MIm]PF6 may induce PEDOT to form a continuous and ordered microstructure of the film.

To gain deeper insight into the morphology change of PH1000 caused by LCILs treatment, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on all the PH1000 films. As shown in Fig. 5, the dark and bright domains are assigned to PEDOT-rich regions and PSS-rich regions in the films, respectively.30 Pristine PH1000 has a lot of non-continuous dark nano-fibrils and dots, which can be attributed to the PEDOT film (Fig. 5a). In PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 (Fig. 5b) and PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 (Fig. 5c) films, dark domains increase and bright domains decrease. Moreover, dark nano-fibrils become more distinct in PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 than in PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4. It indicates that LCILs can induce PEDOT to form an ordered microstructure and a favorable molecular packing. The continuous and ordered nano-fibrils of PEDOT should contribute to the dramatically enhanced conductivity of the films. The ordered microstructure and favorable molecular packing also can be discerned by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S6†). The low angle reflections at 2θ = 3.3° and 6.4° correspond to the lamella stacking distance d(100) of two distinct alternate orderings of PEDOT and PSS,31 whereas the two high angle reflections at 2θ = 17.8° and 25.6° are indexed to the amorphous halo of PSS and the interchain planar ring-stacking distance d(010) of PEDOT, respectively.21 After PH1000 films modified by LCILs, the peak at 2θ = 3.3° shows an increased intensity in the XRD spectra, indicating the improved crystallinity of PEDOT in PH1000/LCIL films. From the POM, AFM, TEM and XRD results, the mechanism of microstructure of PH1000 induced by LCILs can be schematically illustrated in Fig. 5d.

The highly conductive and transparent LCILs modified PH1000 films were applied as the transparent anode in PSC devices with a wide studied and stable donor:acceptor blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the active layer. The conventional structure is glass/PH1000/LCIL/P3HT:PC61BM/LiF/Al with devices effective area of 18 mm2. Fig. S7† presents the current density vs. voltage (J–V) characteristics of conventional devices under AM 1.5 G illumination at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and the related parameters are summarized in Table 1. When the pristine PH1000 film is used as the transparent anode, the device exhibits very poor photovoltaic performance because of its high series resistance (RS) and an associated extremely low conductivity. However, incorporation of the PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 anode into the device achieves the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.50%, with a short-current density (Jsc) of 6.22 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.60 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 66.5%. This value is even higher than that of the ITO-based device (2.40%). The PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 based device also yields the equal PCE to the ITO-based one (2.40% vs. 2.40%). It can be noted that different from the efficiency obtained from the ITO-based device, the decent PCE from PH1000/LCIL is without incorporation of P VP Al 4083 as hole-transporting layer (HTL). Fig. S7† also compares the J–V curves and related parameters of devices based on the PH1000/LCILs electrode with and without P VP Al 4083 HTL. Inserting a layer of P VP Al 4083 HTL into the devices based on the PH1000/LCILs electrode results in a significant decrease in the PCE together with a dramatic drop in FF. From Table 1, we also can see that compared with the devices with P VP Al 4083 HTL, the ones only with PH1000/LCIL show relatively lower RS and higher shunt resistance (RSH) values. The work function of the PH1000/LCILs electrode is high enough to match well with the active layer. Moreover, as seen from the SEM image (Fig. S8†), the hydrophobic PH1000/LCIL film covered by the highly hydrophilic P VP Al 4083 film exhibit a relatively coarse surface, showing that P VP Al 4083 does not facilitate the formation of homogeneous films. Therefore, without incorporation of extra HTL, the LCIL-modified PH1000 electrode could realize a favorable energy alignment in the device. Enabling the simplified ITO-free device structure by LCIL-modified PH1000 electrode is compatible with the large-scale commercial production.

The electrical conductivity of PH1000 modified by LCILs is higher than that of pristine PH1000 but lower than that of ITO. However, the PCE of the ITO-free device based on PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 as transparent anodes is higher than that of the device based on ITO anodes (Fig. S7† and Table 1). As reported earlier, the orientation of LCILs can enhance the crystallization of P3HT.32 To further elucidate the effect of PH1000/LCIL on improvement of photovoltaic performance, the morphology change of the active layer induced by LCILs is determined. The TEM images of the P3HT:PC61BM films are shown in Fig. 6. Compared with the morphology of P3HT:PC61BM films on pristine PH1000 (Fig. 6a) and PH1000/LCIL (Fig. 6b and c), the active layer deposited on PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 (Fig. 6b) and PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 (Fig. 6c) exhibit distinct nano-fibrils in the TEM images. The formation of nano-fibrils should be ascribed to the improved crystallization of P3HT induced by the orientation of LCILs; thereby, the carrier transport can be improved. To further demonstrate this point, a small amount of LCILs (1 mg mL−1) was directly blended with the P3HT and PC61BM. As revealed by the TEM image of P3HT:PC61BM:[C16MIm]PF6 (Fig. S9a†) and P3HT:PC61BM:[C16MIm]BF4 (Fig. S9b†) films spin-coated on the pristine PH1000, both of them form similar nano-fibril morphology. These findings prove that due to the orientation of liquid crystalline molecules, LCILs at the interface of PH1000 and active layer can induce the self-assembly of both PEDOT and P3HT to improve their crystallization, thus contributing to the PCE enhancement.

To investigate the validity of the PH1000/LCIL films as the transparent anode in different active layer materials, the device based on low bandgap donor material, such as thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) blended with [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), were fabricated. The cathode interlayer material is poly [(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN). The conventional structure is glass/anode/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/Al with a device effective area of 18 mm2. The J–V curves and photovoltaic parameters of PTB7:PC71BM devices based on the PH1000/LCIL and pristine ITO transparent anode are shown in Fig. 7a and Table 1, respectively. The PCEs of the devices with PH1000/LCIL electrodes are slightly lower than that from the device with a traditional ITO electrode (5.5%). The slight inferior performance of the PH1000/LCIL-based device compared to that of the ITO-based one is mainly due to the slight decreases of both Jsc and Voc. However, the efficiency still shows relatively high PCE of 4.6% for PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 and 4.5% for PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4. This suggests that PH1000/LCIL is a universal electrode to replace ITO for high performance PSCs. Furthermore, the IPCE spectra in Fig. 7b are in good accordance with the Jsc values.

3. Conclusions
In summary, two highly conductive LCILs [C16MIm]PF6 and [C16MIm]BF4 have been successfully incorporated in ITO-free PSCs by spin-coating on the surface PH1000 films as transparent anodes for high performance PSCs. LCILs modification can remove half of the insulating PSS on the top surface of the PH1000 and induce the formation of PEDOT with ordered and continuous molecular packing. At the same time, spontaneous orientation of LCILs with liquid crystalline property can further promote the ordered packing arrangement of both PH1000 and the active layer. As a result, compared to pristine PH1000, LCILs modified PH1000 possesses dramatically improved conductivity. Consequently, a high performance ITO-free device based on an LCIL-modified PH1000 anode without extra HTL has been realized. It also should be noted that PH1000/LCIL has a universal application as an anode for versatile ITO-free devices. These findings indicate that a solution-processed PH1000/LCIL electrode shows great potential applications in the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs as well as large-area, flexible printed PSCs.
4. Experimental section
Materials
PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions (PH1000) were bought from Heraeus Ltd. with a PEDOT:PSS concentration of 1.3 wt% by weight dispersed in H2O. 1-Hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C16MIm]PF6) and 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C16MIm]BF4) were bought from Energy Chemical and the center for green chemistry, LICP, CAS, respectively. P3HT (4200E) was bought from Rieke Metals Inc., and PC61BM (99.5%) was bought from American Dye Source, Inc. PTB7 and PC71BM were purchased from 1-material Chemscitech Inc. (St-Laurent, Quebec, Canada) and Solarmer Energy Inc., respectively. All purchased materials were used as received.
Preparation characterization of PH1000 and PH1000/LCIL films
Glass substrates of area 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 were successively cleaned in acetone, detergent water, and deionized water for 15 min each followed by isopropyl alcohol ultrasonic agitation and then dried in N2. PH1000 filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s on a glass, which was treated with UV for 20 minutes prior to spin coating. The obtained films (thickness ∼ 80 nm) were annealed on a hot plate in ambient atmosphere at 120 °C for 20 min. Using spin-coated LCIL DMF solution (1.75 mg mL−1) on the dried PH1000 films at 2000 rpm for 60 afforded the PH1000/LCIL films. Then, the modified films were annealed on a hot plate in ambient atmosphere at 120 °C for 25 min. The PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 films had a thickness of about 70 nm, and the PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 films a thickness of about 60 nm. The thickness of [C16MIm]PF6 layer and [C16MIm]BF4 is about 20 nm and 10 nm, respectively.
Fabrication of PSCs
PSCs devices were fabricated using PH1000 and PH1000/LCIL films as the transparent anodes on glass, and P3HT:PC61BM, PTB7:PC71BM were chosen as active layers for comparison. The P3HT:PC61BM (1:1 by weight) active blend layer with a thickness of 100 nm was prepared by spin-coating the dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution at 800 rpm for 30 s and then 1400 rpm for 2 s. The devices are annealed at 150 °C for 10 min on a hotplate in a glove box. The PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5 by weight) active blend layer was prepared by spin-coating mixed solvent of chlorobenzene-1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 by volume) solution at 1000 rpm for 2 min. The cathode interlayer material poly [(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)](PFN) was dissolved in methanol under the presence of a small amount of acetic acid of 0.1 mg mL−1 and was spin-coated onto the top of the obtained active layer at 5000 rpm for 60 s to form a thin interlayer. Then, 100 nm Al was evaporated through a shadow mask under 10−5.
