    , Accepted 21st March 2022First published on 21st March 2022AbstractHerein, for the first time, we present a novel solution method for controllable synthesis of the overlooked cubic phase Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals. The resulting Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals are of high quality with monodispersed size and uniform shape. Optical characterization demonstrates that Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals have a broad absorption in the visible to near-infrared region. Furthermore, an optoelectronic device based on Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals exhibits excellent stability, reproducibility and responsivity. The novel synthetic route presented here not only can open a new avenue for fabricating Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals, especially at the nanoscale, but also may further expand their applications.
Copper-based multinary chalcogenide Cu2–IV–VI3 (IV = Ge, Sn; VI = S, Se, Te) nanomaterials have aroused considerable interest stemming from their Earth abundance, low toxicity, and compositionally tunable band gap energy,1–3 which make them well-suited for applications in solar cells,4 photodetectors,5 photocatalysis,6 and thermoelectrics.7,8 Nowadays, with the increasing demand for clean energy, fabricating low-cost, high-efficiency solar energy conversion materials which can harvest and directly convert sunlight into electricity, heat, or fuel have attracted growing interest.9–11 Cu2–IV–VI3 nanocrystals are the most potential candidates benefiting from their excellent structural advantages such as a large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility and high photostability.4–6 To date, great advances in the fundamental research and practical applications of Cu2–IV–S3 and Cu2–IV–Se3 nanocrystals have been made.1–3,12–14
Despite the significant progress, investigations into Cu2GeTe3 nanomaterials have been largely overlooked, with research articles emerging only reporting the preparation of Cu2GeTe3 bulk phases or thin films.15,16 As a member of the Cu2–IV–VI3 family, Cu2GeTe3 has a cubic crystal structure similar to Cu2GeX3 (X = S, Se),15 which is anticipated to exhibit excellent performance in the field of solar energy conversion. In recent years, there have been only a few reports on the fabrication of Cu2GeTe3, including the direct fusion technique17 and radio-frequency magnetron sputtering.16 However, the aforementioned fabrication processes are not only complex and costly, but also incapable of controlling the morphology and size of the reaction products, which seriously hinder the promising applications of Cu2GeTe3 in micro–nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.
Until now, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the colloidal synthesis of Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals. In comparison to the methods based on the solid state reaction for the fabrication of Cu2GeTe3, solution synthesis is particularly appealing due to its simplicity and feasibility.18–21 Particularly, concerning the fabrication of optoelectronic devices, the solution-processing approach based on nanocrystal suspensions is lower cost and more convenient via spin-coating, drop-casting, and printing.22–27 Currently, investigations on Cu2GeTe3 have been mainly focused on random access memory applications;28 however, its optoelectronic properties have seldom been reported and its potential applications have not been explored. The reason for this limitation in the development of Cu2GeTe3 is that the controllable growth of multicomponent nanocrystals remains a big challenge to balance the reactivity of each precursor for controlling the stoichiometry and crystal phase,29,30 especially at the nanoscale. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a facile and feasible strategy for the synthesis of Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals.
In this study, we realize for the first time the controlled synthesis of cubic phase Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals featuring high monodispersity, as well as uniform shape and size, using a facile hot-injection method. Their structure and composition are investigated by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and elemental analysis. The resultant Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals exhibit a broad absorption in the visible to near-infrared region, and the corresponding optical band gap is estimated by absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, a photodetector constructed using Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals shows excellent responsivity, stability and reproducibility. This work not only provides a simple and effective strategy for the controlled synthesis of Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals, but also attracts research interest in Cu2–IV–VI3 nanomaterial design for potential applications.
Ternary Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals were synthesized from copper(II) 2,4-pentanedionate (Cu(acac)2), germanium(IV) iodide (GeI4), and a trioctylphosphine telluride (TOP-Te) stock solution as precursors and oleylamine (OAm) as a surfactant, solvent, and reducing agent. The precursors were chosen based on empirical evidence and previous literature reports on similar materials. Cu(acac)2 which is readily dissolvable in various organic solvents was chosen as the Cu precursor.1 GeI4 was employed due to its higher temperature stability as compared to GeCl4.31 The TOP-Te stock solution as the Te precursor showed higher reactivity.8,32 When the Cu-OAm solution was heated to 210 °C, a Ge–Te complex solution was quickly injected using a syringe under a nitrogen atmosphere with continuous stirring, and the mixture was further heated to 260 °C (see the ESI† for experimental details). To determine the crystal structure of the resulting product, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed. As shown in Fig. 1a, all of the diffraction peaks located at 25.9°, 29.8°, 42.9°, 50.8°, 62.1° and 68.5° can be well indexed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (400), and (331) planes of the standard JCPDS card (no. 89-2880, space group: F3m, a = 5.950 Å, b = 5.950 Å, and c = 5.950 Å) of a cubic Cu2GeTe3 crystal phase.15 No other impurity peaks are observed in the XRD pattern, indicating that the high purity of Cu2GeTe3 can be obtained by a facile hot-injection method. The corresponding schematic crystal structure of cubic Cu2GeTe3 is depicted in Fig. 1b.

To further evaluate the surface chemical states and elemental composition of Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out. As shown in Fig. 2a, the survey spectrum confirms the co-existence of Cu, Ge, and Te elements in the as-synthesized nanocrystals. Moreover, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cu, Ge, and Te are further recorded to examine the chemical states in the Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals. As displayed in Fig. 2b, two Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 peaks of Cu2GeTe3 are located at 932.1 eV and 951.9 eV, respectively, with a peak splitting of 19.8 eV, indicating the presence of Cu+.33,34 Two fragile peaks located at 933.2 eV and 953.9 eV can be assigned to the oxidation of copper(I).35 The Ge 3d binding energy peak is observed at 30.8 eV in Fig. 2c, which is consistent with the reported values for Ge4+.31,36,37 In addition, the signal peak detected at the binding energy of 32.7 eV can be attributed to GeO2.31 The two peaks located at 572.0 eV and 582.3 eV shown in Fig. 2d are assigned to the Te 3d5/2 and Te 3d3/2 orbitals, respectively, demonstrating the existence of Te2−.38 A small peak observed at about 575.3 eV is assigned to TeO2 due to the possible oxidation of surface-bound Te ions.35 Although surface oxidation inevitably occurs in XPS due to exposure to air, the formed oxides are amorphous and do not appear in the diffraction pattern. The XPS results confirm that all three elements are in the expected oxidation states for Cu2GeTe3.

The morphology and size of the obtained Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A representative TEM image shown in Fig. 3a demonstrates that the as-synthesized Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals are well dispersed and nearly uniform in shape and size with an average diameter of 14.7 ± 1.0 nm (Fig. S1†). To further determine the microstructure of the resulting Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were performed. The HRTEM image of an individual nanoparticle in Fig. 3b shows the lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of 0.34 nm, which can be assigned to the (111) plane of cubic Cu2GeTe3. The corresponding SAED pattern presented in Fig. 3b further reveals the single-crystal characteristics of a Cu2GeTe3 nanoparticle. In addition, the elemental distribution of the synthesized Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals was determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. As illustrated in Fig. 3c–f, the compositional elements Cu, Ge, and Te are homogeneously distributed in a single nanoparticle. Furthermore, the EDX result (Fig. S2†) confirms an atomic ratio of 2:1:3 for Cu:Ge:Te, which is in good agreement with the stoichiometric ratio of Cu2GeTe3.

(c–f) HAADF-STEM image of a Cu2GeTe3 nanoparticle and the corresponding EDX elemental mapping images of (d) Cu, (e) Ge, and (f) Te atoms, respectively, revealing a homogeneous distribution of all elements. 
UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate the optical properties of the as-synthesized Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. 4a, the resulting Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals exhibit a broad absorption in the visible to near-infrared region. Besides, the optical band gap value is calculated by plotting (αhν)2versus hν (α = absorption coefficient, h = Planck's constant, and ν = frequency).39 By extrapolating the linear portion of the plot (the inset in Fig. 4a), a direct optical band gap is determined to be 1.25 eV. To evaluate the optoelectronic properties of the resulting Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals, a photoresponsive device was fabricated by spin-coating the concentrated Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals dispersed in toluene onto a glass substrate and employing a pair of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes.38,40 A 300 W xenon lamp with a 400 nm cutoff filter (400 nm < λ < 780 nm) was used as a white light source, and the light intensity was adjusted and measured using an optical power meter. To determine the photoresponsive performance, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the as-fabricated Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystal device were measured in the dark and under light illumination. As shown in Fig. 4b, the I–V curves show nearly linear behavior, indicating a good Ohmic contact between Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals and ITO electrodes. In addition, the time-dependent photoresponse of the Cu2GeTe3 photodetector was measured by periodically turning on and off light with a light intensity of 21 mW cm−2 at a bias of 1.0 V. As presented in Fig. 4c, under light illumination, the current rapidly increases to a value of ∼212 nA, and then sharply decreases to a value of ∼30 nA as the light is turned off, giving an on/off ratio of ∼7. Moreover, the photocurrent and dark current with periodically switching on/off the incident light at an interval of 10 s remain nearly unchanged after several cycles, indicating that the device possesses high reversibility and stability. From the magnified plot of one circle displayed in Fig. 4c, the rising time and decay time are 3.5 s and 4.1 s, respectively. These results demonstrate that the device has an excellent stability, reproducibility, and responsivity, indicating that the synthesized Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals could be a promising candidate for applications in optoelectronic switches and photodetectors.

Conclusions
In summary, we present for the first time a facile colloidal method to achieve the controllable synthesis of high-quality Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals with uniform shape and monodispersed size and investigate their optoelectronic properties. XRD, TEM, XPS, and EDX systematic measurements proved that the resulting nanocrystals are pure cubic Cu2GeTe3. A photodetector based on Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystals is constructed. The device exhibits excellent stability and reproducibility, and fast response and decay times, making the Cu2GeTe3 nanocrystal a promising candidate for solar energy conversion applications. Our study may open up an avenue to synthesize other multinary tellurides and explore their potential application in solar energy conversion.
