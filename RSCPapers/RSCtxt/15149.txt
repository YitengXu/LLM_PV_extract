    , Accepted 1st March 2023First published on 8th March 2023AbstractIn this work, flexible 5 × 5 cm2 luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) were prepared by integrating a reactive perylene bisimide fluorophore (FC546) into a polysiloxane network. The N,N′-diallyl units of FC546 and the Si–H groups of a linear (methylhydrosiloxane)phenylmethylsiloxane chain (HMP-502) enabled covalent network formation via a hydrosilylation reaction (OPSB-FC546). Two approaches were followed. In the first, five LSC1 devices were prepared by mixing different amounts of OPSB-FC546 containing 0.05 wt% FC546 with a two-component polysiloxane resin bearing Si–H and Si–vinyl groups. After curing, materials with 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 ppm of FC546 were obtained. In the second approach, five LSC2 slabs with equal FC546 content were obtained by reacting FC546 with different amounts of HMP-502 to adjust the desired fluorophore content before incorporation into the two-component polysiloxane resin with a constant OPSB-FC546/resin ratio. Solid-state NMR experiments revealed that the OPSB-FC546 content in LSC1 strongly affected the molecular mobility of the system, i.e., leading to a decreased crosslink density compared to LSC2. The higher crosslinked network conferred higher thermal and light stability to LSC2, as evidenced by Evolved Gas Analysis with mass spectrometric detection. LSC1 and LSC2 exhibited spectroscopic profiles typical of perylene bisimide fluorophores with a maximum quantum yield of about 80% for LSC2, possibly due to the more rigid polymer network. A maximum photon external efficiency (ηext) of 5.7% was gathered from LSC2 flanked by a maximum device efficiency (ηdev) of about 0.5%, which was superior to the values recently reported for other flexible LSC systems with similar sizes.
1. Introduction
In recent years, research on luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) has received significant interest due to the need for low-cost and renewable energy.1–3 LSCs are plastic sheets doped with high quantum yield (QY) luminophores capable of harvesting sunlight and preferentially directing (and concentrating) the luminescence to the edge of the device, thanks to the waveguide principle.2,4,5 A set of solar cells in contact with the edge of the LSC collects the luminescence and produces electric power. LSCs generate electricity even under low-light conditions and can be easily integrated into architectural structures.6 Therefore, LSCs are considered cost-effective and accessible solutions for providing photovoltaics in urban environments, in agreement with the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2010/31/EU (amended and upgraded with Directive 2018/844), which states that every new building should be made “nearly zero energy” from 2020 onwards.7 In addition, the recent geopolitical crisis in Europe has led to higher energy prices for conventional fossil fuels, and fostered investments in renewables and green energy.8
Recently, the research on LSC systems has been focusing on high power conversion efficiencies (PCE or ηdev) by designing high-performance luminophores, transparent and compatible polymer matrices, and engineering solutions that can help in improving the performance of these devices.3,9,10 The highest PCE reported to date of 7.1% by Sloof et al. was measured on an optimised poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) LSC connected to four GaAs cells, mounting a reflective scatterer on the back of the device, and employing Lumogen F Red 305 as a fluorophore.11 The latter is still considered the best-performing dye for applications in LSCs, but valuable alternatives such as organic high quantum yield (QY) fluorophores have recently been proposed.12 Inorganic nanocrystals have also been investigated and commercial devices are already available for greenhouse applications.13–15 Near-infrared emitters with visible-light transparency have also been studied, but a PCE of 0.4% is barely reached.16 Polymers such as PMMA are considered the standard matrix for this technology due to their amorphous character, rigidity and transparency.17,18
Nevertheless, the investigation of different matrices characterised by different properties in terms of polarity,19 processability,20 sustainability,21 and mechanical properties22 can help improve the performance of the devices and/or broaden the material scope for the implementation of this technology in commodities and as architectural elements. For example, the development of flexible matrices can facilitate the incorporation of energy-producing elements in soft components, conformable and wearable devices, or aesthetically appealing objects and decorations, also targeting interiors rather than direct exposure to sunlight.
Recent studies have demonstrated that using inherently flexible siloxane-based hybrid materials effectively enhanced LSC performance and photostability.23–28 These matrices are actually characterised by good visible transparency and thermo-mechanical, chemical and photostability,29 and allowed the covalent attachment of a series of high QY fluorophores30 aimed at improving the phase stability of the device with time. However, to the best of our knowledge, PCEs (ηdev) higher than 0.4% have not been reported for flexible matrices.28
In these materials, the substitution pattern at the silicon atom appears to have a significant influence on the stability of the embedded dye. At 450 nm and high light density, perylene dyes in polydimethylsiloxane-based polymer matrices are much more sensitive to photobleaching than in phenyl group-containing polysiloxanes. In addition, the covalent incorporation of the perylene dye into the network dramatically affects their long-term photostability.31,32
In a previous work, our team prepared curable phenyl group-containing high refractive index polysiloxanes that allowed the incorporation of high concentrations (≥0.3 wt%) of perylene-based fluorophores with constant high QYs regardless of their covalent and non-covalent approaches.31,32
In this work, inspired by the easy modulation of the polysiloxane core and the optical features of the derived fluorescent devices, two distinct approaches were followed to prepare 5 × 5 cm2 LSCs with 3 mm thickness. The perylene diimide dye FC54632 was characterised by red fluorescence at a high QY like Lumogen F Red 305 and reactive peripheral allyl moieties that allow covalent incorporation into a phenyl-substituted polysiloxane matrix during crosslinking. It was employed in the formulation of two LSC series, each containing five crosslinked polymers at the 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 ppm concentration levels, respectively (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Flowchart of the synthesis of LSCX_Y, including the structures of FC546, HMP-502 and the covalent bonded FC546 in HMP-502. 
In the first series, the final concentration of FC546 was adjusted by mixing the (methylhydrosiloxane)phenylmethylsiloxane copolymer hydride terminated (HMP-502) crosslinked with 0.05 wt% of FC546 (i.e., OPSB-FC546-0.05%) in a two-component polysiloxane resin containing Si–H and Si–vinyl groups with the adjusted ratio during curing. In the second series, FC546 was reacted in different amounts with HMP-502 to adjust the desired fluorophore content before incorporation into the two-component polysiloxane resin with a constant OPSB-FC546/resin ratio. The two LSC series were studied in terms of their optical, structural, and thermal stability characteristics and discussed in terms of the final photonic and device performance. Remarkably, we recorded ηdev close to 0.5% for these flexible devices.
2. Experimental part
Materials
The commercially available polysiloxane resin OE-6630 (Dow(1), Dow Corning Inc., Midland, MI, USA) is a two-component polysiloxane resin containing Si–H and Si–vinyl components. It is thermally curable via an integrated platinum catalyst by a hydrosilylation reaction.32 (Methylhydrosiloxane)phenylmethylsiloxane copolymer hydride terminated (HMP-502) and the platinum carbonyl cyclovinylmethylsiloxane complex (Ossko-Catalyst,1.85–2.1% Pt in vinylmethylcyclosiloxane) were purchased from Gelest Inc. (Morrisville, PA, USA) and used as received. The synthesis of FC546 has been published in a previous work.32
Preparation of the LSC
The synthesis and characterisation of the perylene-doped matrices have been described in a previous publication.31
The covalent integration of FC546 into the polymer backbone via the hydrosilylation reaction was performed by mixing a defined amount of the dye (stock solution: 0.1 wt% FC546 in toluene) with the hydride containing linear polysiloxane HMP-502. The total volume of toluene was increased to 10 times, referred to as the product mass and the diluted Ossko-catalyst (0.18% Pt in xylene) was added (2 ppm Pt[0], referred to as the product mass). The mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 24 h, and afterwards the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. A coloured viscous gel called OPSB-FC546-X% was obtained, where X describes the containing dye concentration. Five different polymers were produced with 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 wt% of FC546.
For the integration of OPSB-FC546 into the resin OE6630, Dow(1) components A and B were premixed in a ratio of 1:4. Afterwards, OPSB-FC546 was added, mixed with the resin and degassed under reduced pressure. The mixture was filled into PTFE moulds (5 × 5 × 0.3 cm) and degassed under reduced pressure again until no gas bubbles were visible. Thermal curing was performed in an oven at 150 °C for 4 hours. Two series containing five crosslinked polymers were produced with 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 ppm of FC546, varying in the composition of HMP-502 and Dow(1) (Table 1). In the first series, different amounts of OPSB-FC546-0.05% were mixed with the resins to adjust the desired dye concentration. As a result, the ratio between HMP-502 and Dow(1) changed. In the second series, only the dye concentration in OPSB-FC546 varied, leading to a constant ratio of HMP-502 and Dow(1) in the final product. The resulting doped matrices are called LSCX_Y, where X is a number identifying the series and Y is the dye concentration in ppm in the final sample.

Characterisation of the LSC
High-resolution SSNMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker Avance Neo spectrometer working at the Larmor frequencies of 500.13, 99.362 and 125.77 MHz for 1H, 29Si, and 13C nuclei, respectively. For Dow (1) (LSC1_0) and LSC1_200, a triple-resonance Cross-Polarization/Magic Angle Spinning (CP/MAS) probe accommodating rotors with an external diameter of 2.5 mm was used. In comparison, a double-resonance CP/MAS probe accommodating rotors with an external diameter of 4 mm was used for all the other samples. The 90° pulse durations for the two probes were 7 and 4.6 μs for 29Si, 5 and 3.85 μs for 1H, and 5 and 3.9 μs for 13C. 1H spectra were recorded by Direct Excitation (DE) under MAS with a spinning frequency of 15 kHz, accumulating 4–64 scans with a recycle delay of 5 s. 29Si DE/MAS spectra were recorded with a recycle delay of 300 s and 192–256 or 856–1296 transients for the 4 or 2.5 mm probe, respectively. 13C DE/MAS spectra were recorded with a recycle delay of 2 s and 400–1000 or 2296 scans for the 4 or 2.5 mm probe, respectively. All 13C and 29Si experiments were carried out using a spinning frequency of 8 kHz and applying high-power decoupling from protons during signal acquisition using the SPINAL-64 scheme.331H–29Si two-dimensional (2D) FSLG (Frequency Switched Lee-Goldburg)-HETCOR (HETeronuclear CORrelation)34 experiments were performed on LSC1_150 using contact times (ct) of 500 and 1500 μs and recording 64 rows and 544 scans. Low-resolution experiments were performed on Dow (1) (LSC1_0) and LSC1, LSC2_0, LSC2_150 and LSC2_200 samples using a Stelar PC-NMR spectrometer working at the 1H Larmor frequency of 20.8 MHz, equipped with a single-channel static probe hosting a standard glass tube with an external diameter of 5 mm. The 90° pulse duration for 1H was 3.16 μs. 1H on-resonance Free Induction Decays (FIDs) were acquired by accumulating 400 scans with a recycle delay of 1 s using the Magic Sandwich Echo (MSE) pulse sequence. This pulse sequence allows the FIDs of rigid components characterised by a short T2* (<100 μs) to be fully acquired after refocusing the signal, T2* being the effective characteristic time of the decaying signal, subsequently referred to as T2 for the sake of simplicity. The acquired FIDs were analysed here using a “discrete approach”, i.e. reproducing the FID by means of a linear combination of decay functions characterised by different T2.35 The number of functions in the linear combination reflects the number of regions with different mobility, T2 increasing with the degree of mobility. In contrast, the weight of each function is quantitatively related to the fraction of protons belonging to the region. The type of function depends on the nature of the component, rigid or mobile. In particular, the decay of rigid components can be reproduced by the Gaussian, Pake or Weibullian functions, while an exponential function typically describes that of mobile, liquid-like components.36,37
Thermoanalytical analyses were performed using an EGA/PY-3030D micro-furnace pyrolyser coupled to an 8890 gas chromatograph and a 5977 Mass Selective Detector (Agilent Technologies, USA).
The samples were irradiated with a UV-1047 Xe micro-UV irradiator and a QSP-1046E quick-stabilising pressure flow switch (Frontier Laboratories Ltd, Japan). This instrument has been described in previous publications.38,39 The micro-UV irradiator is equipped with a Xe arc lamp, with 280–450 nm emissions. The irradiance of the emitted light was approximately 3000 W m−2. Irradiation occurred directly inside the pyrolysis furnace at a temperature of 60 °C. The carrier gas was switched to air during UV exposure to simulate natural irradiation conditions. After irradiation, the carrier gas was switched back to helium, and the system was purged for 15 min before analysis. The irradiation time was 1 h. Before and after irradiation and purging, the samples (50–100 μg) were pyrolysed at 600 °C for 0.2 min. The pyrolyser interface and GC injector were operated at 280 °C, and injection was performed with a 10:1 split ratio. Separation of the pyrolysis products was achieved with an HP-5MS fused silica capillary column (95% dimethyl, 5% phenyl polysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm, Agilent Technologies, USA) and helium as the carrier gas (1 mL min−1). The chromatographic program was: initial temperature 40 °C for 6 min, 20 °C min−1 to 310 °C, hold for 40 min.
For Evolved Gas Analysis – MS (EGA-MS), the same instrument was employed; however, a deactivated and uncoated stainless-steel transfer tube (UADTM-2.5 N, 0.15 mm i.d. × 2.5 m length, Frontier Lab) was used to connect the injection port and the mass spectrometer, instead of the chromatographic column. The products evolved from the samples over the temperature range were transferred to the mass spectrometer, ionised, and analysed as a function of time. About 100 μg of each sample were placed into a clean stainless-steel cup and inserted into the micro-furnace. The temperature program chosen for the micro-furnace was: initial temperature 50 °C then 10 °C min−1 up to 800 °C. The interface temperature was maintained at 100 °C higher than the furnace temperature of up to 300 °C. The injection port was operated at 280 °C, with a 1:20 split ratio. The chromatographic oven was maintained at 300 °C during the whole EGA analysis. The analyses were performed in constant flow mode at 1.0 mL min−1 (He, purity 99.995%).
For all the analyses, the mass spectrometric detector was operated in EI positive mode (70 eV) in the scan range from 35 to 600 m/z. The ion source was maintained at 230 °C, while the quadrupole analyser was maintained at 150 °C. The data collected were interpreted using the NIST Mass Spectral Search Program (version 2.0).
UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy was performed using a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent), and fluorescence spectra were measured at room temperature on a Horiba Jobin–Yvon Fluorolog®-3 spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) measurements were carried out on the LSC using a Leica TCS SP5 SMD inverted confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, GE) coupled to an external pulsed diode laser (PicoQuant GmbH, Berlin, Germany) for excitation at 405 and 470 nm and to a TCSPC acquisition card (PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant).
Internal (ηint) and external (ηext) photon and device (ηdev) efficiencies were determined according to the recent protocols.40,41 All detailed procedures are reported in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
In this study, we used dye FC546, which consists of a perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid diimide skeleton with N,N′-diallyl units (Fig. 1). Notably, the allyl groups of FC546 allow its covalent integration into the network through a hydrosilylation reaction during the crosslinking of the matrix components. Additional 2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl phenoxy units at the bay position were introduced to enhance its compatibility with the phenyl group-containing polysiloxane matrices. In previous studies, we have shown that the covalent integration of FC546 provided higher device lifetimes and thermal stabilities compared to blended dyes in the matrix like Lumogen Red 305.32
For LSC preparation, perylene dye FC546 was first integrated into linear polysiloxane (HMP-502) containing Si–H and Si–phenyl groups. Due to the N,N′-diallyl units of the dye and the Si–H groups within the linear polysiloxane chain, covalent integration and network formation via the hydrosilylation reaction were possible. The result was a liquid polymer (OPSB-FC546) in which the dye was homogeneously distributed. It is important to mention that the phenyl groups of the polysiloxanes are necessary for homogeneous perylene dye distribution because they can interact with the aromatic groups of the dye via π–π-interactions. In addition, the dye molecules were highly restricted in their mobility in the material due to a covalent bond attached to the polysiloxane backbone. This reduces the formation of excimers and stacking phenomena. Because of the high concentration of Si–H groups in the HMP-502 component compared to the dye content, hydrosilylation could not be detected by NMR or IR spectroscopy. However, previous experiments highlighted the successful covalent incorporation of the dye into the polymer chain using a very high doping concentration of 8%.31
For the preparation of solid LSCs, the crosslinked liquid perylene polymer OPSB-FC546 was integrated into a thermally curable two-component polysiloxane resin containing reactive vinyl and Si–H groups and methyl and phenyl groups.32 The resin components react with each other via a platinum-catalysed hydrosilylation reaction and also with the remaining hydride groups of OPSB-FC546, ensuring the covalent incorporation of the perylene polymer into the resin. Elastic samples were formed, which exhibited different hardness depending on the HMP-502 concentration. In order to investigate the influence of the dye concentration on one hand and the influence of the crosslinking, on the other hand, two LSC series were prepared. In the LSC1 series, a defined dye concentration was fixed in the OPSB-FC546 component. By adding different amounts of the perylene polymer to the resin components, the concentration of FC546 was adjusted between 50 and 200 ppm. Therefore, the samples also differed in the linear siloxane content, which reduced crosslinking with the increased dye concentration and was also reflected in the haptics of the LSCs.
In the second series (LSC2), the dye concentration was already varied in the perylene polymer, and the amount of the HMP-502 component was kept the same, resulting in consistent crosslinking in all LSC samples.
SSNMR 1H low-resolution experiments

1H on-resonance FIDs of the LSC1 and LSC2 samples were acquired and analysed in order to obtain information on the effect of composition on the mobility of the polysiloxane chains, which can be related to the degree of crosslinking of the polymer network. The on-resonance 1H FIDs were analysed using a discrete approach,36,37 as described in the Experimental section, which allowed regions of the samples to be characterised by a different 1H T2, i.e. by a different degree of mobility, to be identified and quantified. In particular, the best results were obtained using a linear combination of a Gaussian and two exponential functions, corresponding to three components: rigid (a), at intermediate mobility (b) and mobile (c).  where parameter Ci is the weight of the i-th function (i = a, b, and c), proportional to the percentage of 1H nuclei belonging to the domains described by that function, and T2i is T2 associated with the i-th function.
From the fitting of the experimental FIDs (Fig. 2) to the above equation, we obtained the values of T2i and Ci as best-fitting parameters (Table 2). In all cases, T2a ≈ 40 μs, T2b ≈ 80–100 μs, and T2c > 250 μs. Concerning the first series of LSC samples, by increasing the dye concentration, the weight of the mobile fraction progressively increases from 0 (Dow (1)) to 61% (LSC1_200), while that of the rigid fraction correspondingly decreases from 52 to 5%. The fraction's weight at intermediate mobility experiences minor changes, always assuming values between 34% and 56%. The amount of the mobile fraction increases with the content of the dye and its mobility degree, as indicated by the value of T2c, which rises from 265 to 633 μs. Moreover, the steep reduction of the rigid component (a) indicates that the presence of OPSB-FC546 dramatically mobilises the whole structure, preventing the formation of very rigid domains. On the other hand, by looking at the results obtained for the second series of LSC samples, it is possible to notice that both the weight and the T2 associated with each of the three fractions remained similar for all samples; in particular, the values of Cc and T2c remained constant at about 5% and 300 μs, respectively. All taken together, these results indicate that the presence of increasing amounts of HMP-502 strongly influences the molecular mobility of the system, probably due to the decrease in the density of crosslinks.

SSNMR high-resolution experiments

1H DE/MAS spectra were recorded for all the samples of the two series of LSCs (Fig. 3). In all the spectra, it is possible to detect the signals of protons belonging to methyl and methylene groups in the region of 0–1 ppm, while aromatic protons resonate in the region of 7–9 ppm. Both in the spectra of LSC2 and LSC1 samples, a signal at about 5.2 ppm is present which can be attributed to protons of unreacted Si–H units. In the case of LSC1 samples, the intensity of this signal increases with the content of OPSB-FC546 due to the increase of Si–H groups; in the spectra of LSC2 samples, the intensity of this signal is almost constant throughout the series, where the content of OPSB-FC546 was maintained constant. Finally, we never observed any signal ascribable to protons of Si–vinyl groups, indicating that these groups always reacted completely and consequently, the presence of unreacted Si–H groups is only due to their exceeding amount with respect to Si–vinyl groups.
 Fig. 3  
1H MAS spectra of LSC1 and LSC2 samples. 
An evident feature is the increasing resolution of the spectra within the LSC1 set as the content of OPSB-FC546 increases. This trend can be explained by the increase of molecular mobility – in full agreement with the results obtained from 1H FIDs analysis – which more efficiently averages out the 1H–1H homonuclear dipolar interactions, the main cause of line broadening in 1H spectra. On the other hand, the spectral resolution does not appreciably change within the LSC2 set, where the content of HMP-502 is the same for all samples, also in this case, in agreement with the results obtained from 1H FIDs analysis.

13C DE/MAS spectra, recorded for all the samples of the two series of the LSC, are reported in Fig. S1.† In the regions around 0 ppm and between 120 and 150 ppm, the signals due to methyl and aromatic carbons are present, respectively, while the peak at about 10 ppm is ascribable to CH2 carbons involved in the formation of crosslinks. Even for 13C spectra, the resolution increased within the LSC1 set by increasing the dye content. At the same time, it remained similar within the LSC2 set, in full agreement with the previously discussed observations concerning 1H spectra, once more confirming that the increase of molecular mobility is caused by HMP-502 only.
The 29Si DE/MAS spectra recorded for all the samples of the two LSC series are reported in Fig. 4. These spectra permit us to obtain detailed information about the structure of polysiloxane compounds. Indeed, the 29Si isotropic chemical shift strongly depends on the nature and number of functional groups directly bonded to silicon.42,43 Depending on the number of oxygen atoms directly bonded to a Si atom, 1, 2, 3 or 4, the latter is classified as M, D, T or Q, respectively.43 M, D, and T silicon atoms are present in our samples, which also differ in the groups directly bonded to them. These groups are explicitly superscripted if they differ from a methyl or methylene group. This nomenclature is illustrated in Fig. 4, where structures and labels of the different Si atom environments are reported above the corresponding peaks. The signal assignment is further validated by 2D 1H–29Si HETCOR spectra (Fig. S2†), as described in the ESI.† In the following, for each 29Si DE/MAS spectrum, the intensity of all signals was referred to as that of the signal of TPh silicons, which is not affected by crosslinking variations. In particular, the spectrum of Dow (1) does not show any signal attributable to MH (−4 ppm) or MVinyl (expected at about −2 ppm) silicons, thus indicating that the crosslinking between these two groups is complete.
 Fig. 4  
29Si DE/MAS spectra of LSC1 and LSC2 samples. The assignment of the different peaks is reported above the spectra. 
In contrast, the spectra of the LSC1 and LSC2 samples clearly show signals attributable to MH and DH silicon atoms (−36 ppm, belonging to HMP-502), indicating that unreacted Si–H groups are present in these samples, which is in perfect agreement with the observations in the 1H DE/MAS spectra. A signal at about −20 ppm is also present for these samples, ascribable to D silicon atoms arising from the crosslink between component A of Dow (1) and OPSB-FC546. The intensities of the signals due to MH, DH and D silicon atoms increased within the LSC1 set by increasing the OPSB-FC546 content. In contrast, the intensities of the MH and DH signals within the LSC2 set did not change, which is again consistent with the observations of the 1H DE/MAS spectra. Moreover, the signal at ∼11 ppm, ascribable to M silicon atoms and originating from the crosslinking between the terminal Si–H and Si–vinyl groups, is present in all the samples with similar intensity. Overall, the experimental observations from all nuclei support the conclusion that OPSB-FC546 does not hinder the formation of crosslinks but rather prevents the organisation of the polymeric chains in forming rigid domains.
Thermal stability via EGA-MS and Py-GC/MS
LSC1_0 (Dow (1)), LSC1_200 and LSC2_0 and LSC2_200 were also analysed by thermoanalytical techniques, i.e. Evolved Gas Analysis (EGA) and Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography (pyrolysis-GC) with mass spectrometric (MS) detection.
The analysis by EGA-MS allowed us to highlight the evolution of different fractions from some of the investigated materials, as shown in Fig. 5. The curves obtained for all analysed LSC1 and LSC2, both with and without any dye, are almost superimposable, with an onset for the evolution of gases around 500 °C, preceded by a small shoulder. The main gas loss features a spectrum that can be assigned to a series of polysiloxane oligomers,44 with a strong contribution due to benzene (m/z 78) released from the polymer chain, peaking at 549–554 °C for all the analysed samples.
 Fig. 5  Total Ion Thermograms (TIT) for samples LSC1_0, LSC1_200, LSC2_0, and LSC2_200. 
For Dow 1 (LSC1_0), the shoulder peaks were around 382 °C, while for LSC2_0 and LSC2_200, the peaks were at 362 °C. The corresponding average mass spectra (reported in Fig. S3†) are all qualitatively very similar, and contain the same m/z values highlighted for the main gas evolution; indeed, such shoulders indicate a less stable fraction of the polymer, possibly with a lower molecular weight.
For the LSC1_200 sample, the temperature for the maximum evolved gases is lower than that of the corresponding undoped polymers, with a main evolution band that is wider than that of the pristine polymer and occurring at 493 °C (lower than 500 °C). The Extracted Ion Thermogram of benzene (m/z 78) follows the same trend, showing a peak at 533 °C. In addition, the thermogram features four minor evolution bands at lower temperatures, 127 °C, 197 °C, 240 °C, and 323 °C, whose spectra exhibit most peaks in common with those of the undoped resin, but with a quite different distribution (the corresponding average mass spectra are reported in Fig. S4†).
To better understand the composition of the samples and to assign the mass spectra observed by EGA-MS, pyrolysis-GC-MS of the samples was performed, and the corresponding pyrograms are reported in Fig. 6. Peak assignments are provided in Table S1.†
 Fig. 6  Comparison of the pyrograms obtained from the analysis of samples LSC1_0, LSC1_200, LSC2_0, and LSC2_200. Peak assignment is reported in Table S1.† 
For LSC1_0, LSC2_0 and LSC2_200, the profile is qualitatively similar, including the expected pyrolysis products of the polymer. The presence of the dye is highlighted in LSC1_200 only by detecting several peaks (labelled in red with Roman numerals). Even if the intact dye molecule is not detected, signals attributable to its structure can be found. Interestingly, several pyrolysis products, although not clearly identified from their mass spectra, seem to contain moieties related to the dye and the silicon matrix, confirming the formation of stable bonds between the polymer and the dye. The latter species, and in particular the intense peaks eluting at 14–17 minutes, all feature mass spectra containing ions at 135, 239, 253, 317, and 332 m/z and may correspond to isomers or oligomers with different chain lengths, producing the same mass spectra. These m/z values correspond to those observed in the mass spectra of the early evolving gases in the EGA profile of sample LSC1_200.
The obtained results show that the addition of the dye affects the structure and the thermal behaviour of the polymer in the case of LSC1_200, whereas its presence does not significantly affect the structure or the stability of the LSC2 series, being completely (covalently) integrated into the polymer matrix. After UV irradiation in the 280–450 nm range, all the peaks due to the dye in LSC1_200 significantly decreased, as expected. No new products were formed after irradiation, and the polymer profile was almost unaltered.
Overall, the EGA-MS studies revealed that samples LSC1_0, LSC2_0 and LSC2_200 are more stable than sample LSC1_200. Moreover, they did not exhibit any significant changes in their composition after irradiation, while LSC1_200 was strongly affected by UV irradiation.
Spectroscopic characterisation of the LSC
The first and second series of LSCs showed mostly identical optical features with an absorption peak at 576 nm and emissions at 605–610 nm.31,32 Notably, the absorbance intensity regularly increased with the FC546 content, keeping the maximum position unchanged, thus suggesting a uniform distribution of the fluorophores within the slab (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  UV-Vis absorption and surface emission (λexc = 450 nm) of LSC1 (a) and LSC2 (b) polysiloxane slabs. 
The surface fluorescence emission of the LSC devices also increased with fluorophore doping, but up to a fluorophore concentration of 100 ppm for LSC1. Above this threshold, fluorescence intensity decreased, flanked by a bathochromic shift of the peak emission maximum of about 5 nm (Fig. 7a). This phenomenon was possibly due to the presence of dissipative processes in the highly concentrated slab, thus causing a portion of the absorbed photons to be lost via non-radiative pathways through the reabsorption of emitted photons considering the Stokes shift of 27 nm only, typical of perylene bisimide fluorophores.21,45,46 The small tail in the emission spectra supported this consideration. Fluorescence quenching with the FC546 content was not particularly evident for LSC2 since the emission reached its maximum at the highest concentration of 200 ppm (Fig. 7b). Nevertheless, no additional bands attributed to chromophoric aggregates resulting in excimer formation were detected at high fluorophore contents for both LSC1 and LSC2.
Moreover, the difference in the emission behaviour of the two LSC series was also reflected in the measured QY (Table 3).

Notably, QY values of LSC1 gradually decreased from 73% at the lowest content of 50 ppm to 65% at the highest concentration of 200 ppm. Conversely, the QY of LSC2 slabs was higher than those of the first series for all the FC546 concentrations, possibly suggesting that the second preparation approach was more effective in providing the LSC with the highest efficiencies. This result agrees well with the findings from the SSNMR high-resolution experiments since a more rigid host polymer matrix of the LSC2 possibly enhanced the FC546 quantum yield. This is further supported by QY values close to those of Lumogen F Red 305, i.e., a fluorophore structurally very similar to FC546 when embedded in less polar matrices.20,24,47,48
Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM)
The first series of samples (LSC1) was imaged at a depth of about 100 μm under the upper surface. Under 40× magnification, the dye looked well dispersed within the matrix since no visible aggregates were detected. The fluorescence lifetime values also confirmed the uniform dispersion of the dye in the polymeric matrix (Table S2†). Decay curves fitted by exponential functions gave strict monoexponential decays, with a lifetime value τ of about 5.6 ns. Changes in the dye concentration did not affect the fluorescence lifetime, suggesting the absence of interaction phenomena such as aggregate or excimer formation.
LSC2 gave very similar results, with no visible aggregation under 40× magnification and a stable fluorescence lifetime of 5.4 ns, which was not affected by dye concentration.
Photonic and device performance
Considering the results gathered from the spectroscopic characterisation, the LSC photonic and device efficiencies were determined from LSC2, only.
The photonic performance of the LSC was first characterised in terms of the internal photon efficiency (ηint), which was determined using an AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (1 sun) and the edge output collected with an integrating sphere connected to a calibrated spectroradiometer (see the ESI† section for further details). ηint was calculated using the ratio between the average output power emitted from the four edges of the slab and the fraction of photons absorbed by the device (eqn (S1), ESI†). Since ηint is the ratio between the photons collected at the LSC edges and the number of absorbed photons by the fluorophores, it is associated with all the light guide losses. Notably, a maximum ηint of about 34% was determined for the less doped system at 50 ppm, and then it decreased regularly with the fluorophore content up to about 20% at the highest doping of 200 ppm (Fig. 8).
 Fig. 8  
η
int (%, black circles), ηext (%, red circles) photon efficiencies and ηdev (inset) as a function of the FC546 fluorophore content (ppm). 
This behaviour indicates that the haziness of the slabs (Fig. SI6†), arising from an imperfectly polished mould employed during fabrication,31 plays a role in the determination of the properties of the devices. In particular, the decrease of ηint with the dye concentration suggests that in the investigated devices, the transmittance loss affects more the internal photon efficiency than the absorption of the dye. Indeed, ηint found for an undoped slab was 36%.
The LSC was then characterised in terms of the external photon efficiency (ηext), determined as the ratio between the output photon flux measured at the edges of the slabs by the integrating sphere with respect to the incident photon flux (eqn (S2), ESI†). Notably, ηext was found to increase with the concentration of up to 100 ppm, while levelling off at values of about 5.8% at higher FC546 contents (Fig. 8). This behaviour reflected the increasing efficiencies gathered by the number of fluorophores due to solar harvesting, counterbalanced by the growing probability of fluorescence dissipation at high doping levels.45ηext determined in this work were equivalent to those gathered from LSC systems based on Lumogen F Red 305 or other highly efficient luminescent species.12 One can expect that the scattered radiation may also increase the value of ηext through the waveguiding effect since the haziness of the slab could artificially increase ηint. However, the evaluation of ηext for an undoped polysiloxane matrix resulted in values of about 1.5%. While we cannot exclude a contribution of the scattering in determining the reported efficiencies, this finding indicates that the fluorophore emission plays a dominant role in the radiation emitted from the edge.
The LSC performance was eventually determined by connecting two Si-PV cells in series to an edge of the slab using silicone grease as an optical waveguide. ηdev was then calculated under standard illumination conditions of 1 sun and by measuring the electrical power of the PV cells (Poutel) with respect to the luminous power hitting the top surface of the LSC (Pinopt). ηdev was found to increase to up to 0.46% at 150 ppm of the fluorophore, while dropping off to 0.43% at the highest fluorophore content, i.e., in strict agreement with the calculated QY values. These values were higher than other flexible devices found in the literature. For example, ηdev of 0.23%, 0.31%, and 0.37% were reported respectively for a multi-dye PDMS-based device, a di-ureasil siloxane-organic matrix comprising Lumogen F Red 305 (when measured under conditions similar to those we employed in this study),48 and the latter dye in PDMS.28 Moreover, in the case of our setup, we could not reach a perfect adhesion of the LSC slab with the PV systems, thus adversely affecting the waveguide efficiency and suggesting that even better performance can be expected from this material upon optimisation.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported the preparation of 5 × 5 cm2 LSC1 and LSC2 luminescent collectors based on a flexible polysiloxane network doped with the perylene bisimide fluorophore FC546. Among the two preparation routes, the one in which the OPSB-FC546/polysiloxane ratio was kept constant and the FC546 content was covalently bonded to HMP-502 was the more effective. As shown by the combined ssNMR, EGA-MS, pyrolysis-GC-MS and spectroscopy investigations, LSC2 exhibited higher crosslink density, thermal and photostability, and quantum efficiencies. Moreover, a maximum ηdev of 0.46% was obtained, i.e., superior to those obtained from literature reports on flexible host polymer matrices and comparable to the rigid ones with similar sizes containing similar perylene diimide-based dyes.
Considering these performances, our results support the use of polysiloxane matrices in the formulation of efficient, stable and flexible LSCs.
