    , Accepted 7th October 2021First published on 8th October 2021AbstractThermoelectric materials are promising for energy harvesting using waste heat. The thermal management of the thermoelectric materials attract scientific and technological interests. The narrow bandgap semiconductor BiAgSe2 is a good candidate for thermoelectric materials due to its ultralow thermal conductivity. The mother compound BiAgSe2 crystallizes in hexagonal symmetry at room temperature, but experiences structural transitions to cubic phase at high temperature. By contrast, the daughter compound BiAgSeTe exhibits long range ordering and crystallizes into cubic phase at room temperature. Nevertheless, the local structural disorderings due to the Bi3+ and Ag+ anti-site defects, as well as local structural distortions, are ubiquitous in both parent BiAgSe2 and BiAgSeTe. BiAgSeTe exhibits distinct transport properties owing to the disordering-induced drastic changes in the electronic band structure, as well as the scattering dictated by the point defects. It is suggested that BiAgSe2 and BiAgSeTe could be good candidates for phonon glass and crystal glass (PGEC)-type thermoelectrics.
Introduction
Energy harvesting using thermoelectric materials are of great interest in recent years.1 By converting the low-grade heat into electricity, the thermoelectric materials are believed to be environmentally friendly “green” energy resources. Despite the demonstrated applications of the thermoelectric modules, the conversion efficiency is still the limiting factor for practical applications. The conversion efficiency could be evaluated by the dimensionless figure of merit ZT = S2σ/T, where S, σ and T are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and absolute temperature, respectively. The power factor defined by S2σ is important to evaluate the thermopower.2 The power factor S2σ depends on the electronic structure of the materials, including but not limited to band structure, charge scattering, and the doping level.3 The Phonon Glass Electron Crystal (PGEC) concept for designing state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials was proposed by Slack and Rowe in 1995.4 This approach pointed out that the best thermoelectrics should exhibit low thermal conductivity like glass, while maintaining good electrical conductivity like single crystals.
BiAgSe2 (also known as AgBiSe2), as a narrow-bandgap semiconductor, is a good candidate for thermoelectric materials,5–7 as well as solar cells.8 The BiAgSe2 bulk crystal experiences two structural phase transitions with increasing temperature. AgBiSe2 crystallizes in a hexagonal α-phase (Pm1, space group no. 164) at room temperature. Upon heating above 523 K, it undergoes phase transition from the hexagonal α-phase to rhombohedral β-phase (Rm, space group no. 166). Further heating above 723 K, another phase transition occurs from the rhombohedral β-phase to cubic γ-phase (Fmm, space group no. 225).
The pristine BiAgSe2 is an n-type thermoelectric material with promising thermoelectric performance by optimizing doping.5,9–11 On the other hand, the solution-synthesized BiAgSe2 could exhibit p-type conducting behavior.6 It was reported that the pristine BiAgSe2 showed p–n type switching, while the annealed BiAgSe2 exhibited only n-type semiconducting behavior.11 Moreover, the p-type BiAgSe2 was successfully synthesized by adding an excess amount of Se to compensate the Se vacancies.12
The intrinsically low thermal conductivity of the cubic V–I–VI2 semiconductor originates from the extreme lattice vibrational anharmonicity.13 Specifically, the soft Ag vibrations and local structural distortions induced by the Bi 6s2 lone pair play an important role in the n-type cubic BiAgS2.14 Moreover, the cubic phase BiAgSe2 preserves the crystallinity, while containing local disordering with Bi3+ and Ag+ cations randomly distributed.15,16
Consequently, the heat transfer in BiAgSe2 could be controlled by tailoring the phonon scattering rates due to the cation disordering.16 By doping In at the Ag site, Xia et al. were able to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity even further.9 Through the incorporation of Ge and formation of the Bi2Se3 nano-precipitate, an ultra-low thermal conductivity (∼0.3 W m−1 K−1) was realized in (GeSe)0.03(AgBiSe2)0.97.17
Various strategies were adopted for improving the thermoelectric performance in the family of V–I–VI2 semiconductors. By alloying BiSbTe with AgBiSe2, the bipolar effect was suppressed to increase the hole concentration, while the lattice thermal conductivity was reduced due to various phonon scattering centers.18 In solid solutions like (AgBiSe2)1−x(Ag2Se)x and (Ag0.995In0.005BiSe2)0.95(Ag2Se)0.05, high power factor and reduced lattice thermal conductivity were simultaneously achieved.9 Similarly, it was found that the nanodots could serve as an energy-filter for charge carriers in Pb-doped AgSbSe2. Meanwhile, defects and the Ag–Sb disorder could further suppress the lattice thermal conductivity.19
Owing to several phase transitions and the local structural disordering, the structural aspects are very complicated in real materials. For instance, the polymorphic change20 from cubic towards hexagonal phase in AgBi0.7Sb0.3Se2 upon Nb doping was revealed by synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SPXRD). Similarly, stabilization of the non-equilibrium rock salt structure of nanocrystalline BiAgSeS was demonstrated at room temperature. Meanwhile, the cubic structure was only found at high temperature for bulk BiAgSeS.21 By using the temperature-dependent SPXRD, Guin et al.21 reported that the nanocrystalline BiAgSeS experiences a structural phase transition from cubic rock salt to hexagonal structure above 475 K. Through the synchrotron-based high energy X-ray pair-distribution function (X-PDF), the local structural distortions and intrinsic defect chemistry are responsible for the n-to-p transition and thermal conductivity, highlighting the importance of fine structural characterizations in BiAgSe2-based materials.22 Based on the density functional theory calculations, Feng et al. revealed23 that intrinsic defects like Ag defects can be helpful to increase the power factor. The band degeneracy can be achieved by shifting the Fermi level into the valence band with intrinsic defects, or by converging several valence-band maxima by introducing extrinsic defects. Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction studies showed that there was anti-site disorder between the Ag 2d and Bi 2d positions, and the degree of disorder was influenced by the amount of Ag vacancies.15
Motivated by the previous work, we synthesized BiAgSeTe as an n-type thermoelectric material. Using the conventional X-ray diffraction, density functional theory calculations, as well as the local structural probe, i.e., X-ray Absorption Fine structure spectroscopy, we investigated the structural aspects of the room temperature BiAgSeTe and correlated the structural features to its thermoelectric performance.
Experimental
The high-purity raw powders of Ag, Bi, Se and Te were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio of BiAgSe2−xTex (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2). The mixture was then mixed homogeneously in an agate mortar and heated at 773 K over 12 h. For BiAgSeTe, we prepared the samples over different time (4 h, 6 h, 8 h and 10 h) in a sealed silica tube under argon. The products from the metallic alloy were ball-milled in a planetary mill at 300 rpm over 24 hours. The bulk samples were cut into Φ15 mm by 10 mm pellets, and sintered by spark plasma sintering (Sumitomo SPS1050, Japan) under 50 MPa in an argon atmosphere at 773 K for 6 minutes. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient were measured using a commercial measurement system (ZEM-2, ULVAC-RIKO, Japan) from room temperature to 683 K. The thermal diffusivity coefficient (D) was measured using the laser flash method (NETZSCH, LFA457, Germany). The density (d) of the sample was measured by the Archimedes method. The specific heat was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (NETZSCH DSC 404C Germany). The thermal conductivity (k) was calculated from the product of thermal diffusivity, specific heat and density, k = D·Cp·d, and all transport measurements were performed in the temperature range from room temperature up to 683 K. The structure of these obtained samples at room temperature was characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, which was recorded on a Rigaku Dmax diffraction system using a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.54187 Å).
The X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) at Bi L3-edge (13419 eV) and Se K-edge (12658 eV) were measured at the 1W1B and 1W2B endstation of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. All samples were grounded into powders and filtered with 400 mesh sieve. The resulting fine powders were evenly applied onto tape, and folded so as to achieve an optimal (0.8–1.2) jump in the transmission mode. The Si(111) double crystal monochromators were used to scan the incident energy around the absorption edges. The gas filled (25% Ar and 75% N2) ionic chambers were used to monitor the incident and transmitted beams. All spectra were pre-processed using the Demeter package (Version 0.9.26).24 The atomic absorption backgrounds were subtracted using the Autobk algorithm implemented in Athena code, and the spectra were normalized to have the unit edge jump. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) oscillations χ(k) and k3 weighted Fourier transforms of the EXAFS oscillations were obtained using conventional procedures in Athena. Quantitative structural fittings were performed using the Artemis code with a model structure from the X-ray crystallography.
The electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) was calculated using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) method and PBE96 GGA functionals, as implemented in the WIEN2k code. The muffin-tin radius, RMT, for Bi, Se, Te, Ag, and O was 2.3 a.u., 2.0 a.u., 2.1 a.u., and 2.5 a.u., respectively, where a.u. is the Bohr radius. Self-consistent cycles were carried out at an energy convergence of 0.0001 Ry. The RMTKmax was set to 7.0, determining the number of basis functions, while Gmax was set to 12.
Results and discussion
(1) Phase structure by XRD
The phase structures of BiAgSeTe are unknown and the X-ray diffraction patterns could be used to identify the phase. In order to be clear, we first compared the XRD patterns of BiAgSeTe with that of the parent compounds BiAgSe2 and slightly doped BiAgSe1.5Te0.5. As shown in Fig. 1, both BiAgSe2 and BiAgSe1.5Te0.5 can be indexed to the reference patterns of the hexagonal BiAgSe2 (JCPDS No. 85-0704). The diffraction peaks at 30.6° slightly shift towards a lower angle in BiAgSeTe with respect to the reference, indicating the expansion of the (104) crystal plane. While there are double peaks at 43.4° and 44.4° appearing in both BiAgSe2 and BiAgSe1.5Te0.5, there is only one broad peak that appears in BiAgSeTe at 42.6°. Similarly, several distinguishable peaks appear between 50.8–57.1° for both BiAgSe2 and BiAgSe1.5Te0.5. However, there is only one distinct peak at around 54° for BiAgSeTe. Hence, the phase structure of BiAgSeTe is not hexagonal.

Next, we performed theoretical calculations of the XRD patterns by adopting the phase structures of parent BiAgSe2. The theoretical XRD was simulated for three phases of BiAgSe2, i.e., hexagonal α-phase (Pm1, space group no. 164), rhombohedral β-phase (Rm space group no. 166), and γ-phase (Fmm, space group no. 225). The corresponding crystallographic parameters of the unit cells are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). In Fig. 2, the theoretical XRD of the α-phase and β-phase are quite similar except for a slight angular shift around 30°, which corresponds to the (104) plane. By contrast, the peak at 30° shifts to a smaller angle and the double peak around 45° merges into one peak in the γ-phase. Apparently, the cubic phase exhibits a smaller number of diffraction peaks than the hexagonal phase due to higher symmetry. The feature is similar to the experimental XRD of BiAgSeTe. The phase structure of BiAgSeTe can be tentatively assigned to the phase structure of γ-phase BiAgSe2 with the face-centered cubic unit cell. The atomistic drawing of the unit cell is shown in Fig. 3. Ideally, the Bi and Ag cations are sharing the 4a Wyckoff positions (0, 0, 0) with mm point symmetry. Meanwhile, the Se and Te ions share 4b Wyckoff positions (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) with also mm point symmetry. On the other hand, the peaks of the experimental XRD are broadened in comparison with calculation. It should be noted that only the pure phase with an ordered crystalline structure is used in the calculation. It is implied that either disordered or hidden secondary phases exist in the samples. For the impurity phase or mixed phase, which can be identified by XRD, the fraction of the secondary phase can be evaluated. Due to the overlap and broadening of the diffraction peaks, the fraction of the hidden phase, though representing significant disorder, cannot be evaluated based on our XRD experiment.

(2) Electronic structure of BiAgSeTe
In order to compare the electronic structure, we performed the density functional theory calculations based on the full-potential (linearized) augmented plane-wave ((L) APW) + local orbitals (lo) method, which is one of the most accurate schemes (in comparison with pseudopotential calculations) for band structure calculations. As implemented in the WIEN2k package, it provides an all-electron scheme including scalar relativistic effects, thus giving detailed and relatively accurate electronic structures. It should be pointed out that the calculated band gap for a specific atomic structure is usually sensitive to the details of the calculations. Hence, it is reasonable to maintain the same recipe for the calculations of a series of samples for comparison. Meanwhile, the experimental measurements also vary among different equipment on specific samples. As shown in Fig. 4, the total density of states (PDOS) for different phase structures were compared. The band gap is estimated to be ∼0.5 eV (Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S1, ESI†) for α-BiAgSe2, which is close to ∼0.6 eV as measured by UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer,10 but larger than ∼0.25 eV obtained by pseudopotential calculations.9 The band gap of β-BiAgSe2 is ∼0.4 eV (Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S2, ESI†), which is narrower than that of α-BiAgSe2. The narrowing of the band gap is in agreement with the experimental measurements,5 in which the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity experiences a semiconducting-to-metallic transition accompanying the phase transition from α-BiAgSe2 to β-BiAgSe2. By contrast, there is no band gap for γ-phase BiAgSeTe. The electronic band structure in Fig. S3 (ESI†) exhibits the energy dispersion over the symmetry points of wave-vectors in the Brillouin zone of the reciprocal space. While there is a large band gap at the Γ point (0, 0, 0), there is an overlap of the conduction band and valence band at the L point (1/2,1/2,1/2).
 Fig. 4  Comparison of the electronic density of states of (a) α-BiAgSe2, (b) β-BiAgSe2 and (c) γ-BiAgSeTe. 
Next, we compare the orbital projected partial density of states (PDOS) for each element in different phases. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the dominating states are Ag-d, Bi-p and Se-p states for α-BiAgSe2. In the vicinity of the Fermi energy, the density of states is dominated by Ag-d, Bi-s and Se-p below the Fermi level. Above the Fermi level, the dominant PDOS is the Ag-s, Bi-p and Se-p. The PDOS of β-BiAgSe2 (Fig. S6, ESI†) looks similar to that of α-BiAgSe2. The dominating PDOS in β-BiAgSe2 is also Ag-d, Bi-p, and Se-p states. The Ag-s, Bi-p and Se-p dominate the states above the Fermi energy, while the Ag-d, Bi-s and Se-p dominate the states below the Fermi energy.
By contrast, the PDOS of γ-phase BiAgSeTe is distinct from the PDOS of the above two phases. In Fig. S6 (ESI†), the dominant PDOS becomes Ag-s, Bi-p, Se-p and Te-p. In the vicinity of the Fermi energy, the Ag-p, Bi-p, Se-p and Te-p are dominant below the Fermi energy. Meanwhile, the Ag-s, Bi-p, Se-p and Te-p are dominant above the Fermi energy. Considering the electronic configurations of the atoms, Ag: [Kr]4d105s1, Bi: [Xe]4f145d106s2 6p3, Se: [Ar]3d104s24p4, Te: [Kr]4d105s25p4, the s-states of Ag become dominant in BiAgSeTe instead of d-states, suggesting a charge redistribution in the cubic phase. In summary, the electronic structure of BiAgSeTe is dissimilar to that of the parent BiAgSe2.
(3) Thermoelectric properties of BiAgSeTe
The temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties of BiAgSeTe are shown in Fig. 5. First, the electrical conductivity increases by a factor of 9 as the temperature increases from 300 K up to 700 K. The positive correlation between the electrical conductivity and temperature indicates the semiconducting behavior of BiAgSeTe. The increment of the electrical conductivity is due to the increasing concentration of charge carriers upon heating.
 Fig. 5  Temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties of BiAgSeTe. 
Second, the negative Seebeck coefficient indicates that the type of charge carriers is electrons instead of holes. Hence, BiAgSeTe is also n-type thermoelectric materials like BiAgSe2 and BiAgSeS. The Seebeck coefficient is negatively correlated with temperature, supporting the scenario of the increasing concentration of charge carriers upon increasing temperature. The largest absolute Seebeck coefficient is about −190 μV K−1 at room temperature. By plotting the power factor with respect to the temperature, one can observe the nice peak at 550 K, indicating that the optimal concentration of the charge carriers for the best electrical transport can be achieved at about 550 K.
Third, the thermal conductivity is extremely low (∼0.8 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K) and increases with temperature from 300 K up to 525 K. The highest thermal conductivity is still as low as ∼1.05 W m−1 K−1 at 525 K. Above 550 K, there is an abrupt variation of the thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity is about 0.72 W m−1 K−1 at 550 K, and increases slightly up to ∼0.8 W m−1 K−1 at 700 K. The abrupt change of thermal conductivity may originate from the structural phase transition (from cubic to hexagonal) like BiAgSeS nanocrystals.21 Nevertheless, as we calculate the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT), the highest ZT value is achieved at ∼0.42 at about 550 K (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  The temperature-dependent thermoelectric figure of merit for BiAgSeTe. 
(4) Local structures in cubic BiAgSeTe
As aforementioned, the lattice structure of BiAgSeTe exhibits cubic symmetry at room temperature. However, the simulated XRD based on the pure phase cannot describe the broadening of peaks in real experiments. The X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) enables the element-specific symmetry-sensitive probes for local atomic structures.25 In particular, the near-edge part, namely X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, can be used to investigate the local atomic structural arrangements,26 as well as electronic structure.27
Owing to the nature of the local probe, the XANES spectra are sensitive to the local coordination environment around the central absorber element. We have compared the XANES spectra at Bi L3-edge and Se K-edge for the pristine BiAgSe2, BiAgTe2, as well as the doped species with different Te:Se ratios. First, the first shell coordinate for Bi is Se or Te, while that for Se is Ag or Bi. The Bi L3-edge spectra reflect the local structure around Bi. The experimental spectra shown in Fig. 7 indicate that there is a slight difference among different species. All experimental spectra show a broadened white line (or main peak). Although the hexagonal model can reproduce the experimental spectra in Fig. 7(a) for BiAgSe2 and Fig. 7(b) for BiAgTe2, neither hexagonal nor cubic model can reproduce the experimental spectrum in Fig. 7(c) for BiAgSeTe. As previously known, there is anti-site disordering for Bi and Ag in BiAgSe2.15,16 Hence, it looks like the local structure of Bi is even more disordered in BiAgSeTe. The theoretical spectrum simulated by the ideal structure (Fig. 7(c)) possesses distinctive spectral features, while those peaks are missing in the experimental spectra. In Fig. S7 (ESI†), the calculated Bi L3-ege XANES spectra are also compared with the experimental spectra of two doped species, namely, BiAgSe0.5Te1.5 and BiAgSe1.5Te0.5. Among three different structural models (hexagonal BiAgSe2 and BiAgTe2 and cubic BiAgSeTe), the hexagonal BiAgSe2 could be used to reproduce the broadened spectra features. It implies that there may exist severe structural disordering, which may be caused by hidden secondary phases, local atomic anti-site disordering, and others.
 Fig. 7  Comparison of the experimental and theoretical XANES spectra at Bi L3-edge for (a) BiAgSe2, (b) BiAgTe2 and (c) BiAgSeTe. It should be noted that hexagonal structures were used for (a) and (b), while the cubic structure was used for (c). 
Next, we focus on the Se K-edge XANES spectra. In the Se K-edge XANES spectrum of BiAgSeTe (Fig. 8), there is a sharp white line (feature a) reflecting the 1s-to-4p electronic transition. Above the edge around 12680 eV, there is a bump (features b and c) due to the multiple scattering of the photon-excited electrons by the scatterers surrounding the central Se absorbers. The strong white line feature a and bump feature b can be found in BiAgSe2, BiAgSe1.5Te0.5, and BiAgSe0.5Te1.5 (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). However, feature c appears strongest in BiAgSe2 and gradually smears out as the Se content is decreased.
 Fig. 8  Comparison of the Se K-edge XANES experimental spectra for BiAgSeTe and theoretical XANES spectra using three models: (1) BiAgSe2, (2) Se-doped BiAgTe2 and (3) γ-phase BiAgSe2. 
In the simulated spectra (Fig. 8), the spectrum simulated using the cubic structure contains much sharper features than that simulated using hexagonal structures. This is reasonable because the cubic phase has higher symmetry. Although the simulation reproduces the spectral features of BiAgSe2 and BiAgSe1.5Te0.5 (Fig. S8, ESI†) very well in terms of the peak positions and intensity, there are discrepancies for BiAgSeTe (Fig. 8). The broadened spectral features in the Se K-edge XANES experimental spectra indicate that there is also a large structural disordering in the local coordination environment or hidden secondary phases. The portion of the disordering is significant, although it cannot be quantitatively estimated. The disordering phases might be formed during the high temperature synthesis, similar to the quenched disordered rock-salt phase in BiAgSe2.16
As aforementioned, the XANES spectra can be used to interpret the electronic structures.27,28 During the calculations of XANES, the orbital-projected electronic local density of states can be retrieved because both are related to similar Green's functions using Full Multiple Scattering (FMS) cluster calculations.27 In Table S2 (ESI†), we retrieved the electron occupation number for the s, p, and d orbitals, as well as the differentially calculated charge transfer (CT) for BiAgSe2, BiAgTe2 and BiAgSeTe. To justify the robustness, we performed the calculations at Bi, Ag, Se, and Te L3-edge. It should be noted that the calculations at the K-edge of Se shows similar results (not shown). As for the hexagonal phase BiAgSe2 and BiAgTe2, the charge transfer of Ag, Se, and Te is negative, implying the negative valence states or accepting electrons. Vice versa, the charge transfer of Bi is positive; thus, Bi serves as electron donors.
It is noticed that the calculated charge transfer for each element is slightly different (difference within 10%) for the same species calculated at different absorption edges. However, there is a big difference among the different species. For instance, (1) the charge transfer of Ag is −0.13 and −0.22 for hexagonal BiAgSe2 and BiAgTe2, respectively; while the charge transfer of Ag becomes positive as 0.029 in cubic BiAgSeTe. (2) The charge transfer of Bi is 0.43 and 0.35 for hexagonal BiAgSe2 and BiAgTe2, respectively; while the charge transfer of Bi reduces to 0.125 in cubic BiAgSeTe. (3) For Se, the charge transfer is −0.15 in hexagonal BiAgSe2, but increases to −0.27 in cubic BiAgSeTe. Interestingly, the charge transfer of Te also changed from negative in hexagonal BiAgTe2 (−0.06) to psositive in cubic BiAgSeTe (0.11). Based on the calculations of the ideal structure, the local electronic structure around Ag varies drastically from hexagonal to cubic phase. This could be related to different electronic transport properties of the two phases.
In order to obtain quantitative local structural parameters, such as coordination number, bond distance and mean-square relative displacement (MSRD) around the inter-atomic equilibrium distance, we employed extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS).29 As shown in Fig. 9, the Fourier transforms of the k2 weighted EXAFS oscillations are compared for different species at Bi L3-edge and Se K-edge. It should be noted that the peak positions are not the real atomic bond distances. It should be corrected with a phase-shift induced variation. According to the crystallographic parameters, the nearest neighboring atom for Bi is Se or Te in BiAgSe2 or BiAgTe2. The nearest neighboring atoms for Se are Ag and Bi for BiAgSe2. For hexagonal BiAgSe2 or BiAgTe2, there is 6 Se or Te atoms close to Bi with a Bi–Se bond length of 2.984 Å or Bi–Te bond length of 3.180 Å. For cubic phase BiAgSeTe, the bond distance for Bi–6M (M = Se or Te) is averaged as 3.0 Å. It is clearly seen that the Bi–Te bond emerges and increases with the increasing amount of Te, demonstrating the sensitivity of the local structural probe. By contrast, as we compare the Se K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 8(b)), the peaks in the first shell are well aligned for different species. This is because all peaks are corresponding to the Se–Bi of Se–Ag bonds in the first shell.
 Fig. 9  Comparison of the radial distribution function for (a) Bi L3-edge and (c) Se K-edge EXAFS of BiAgSe2−xTex (x = 0, 0.5, 1.5, 2). 
Quantitative fitting of the EXAFS spectra requires prior knowledge of the “coarse” atomic structure to obtain “refined” structural information. We have employed two structural models: the original hexagonal phase BiAgSe2 and distorted structure with two different Bi–Se bonds. According to Fig. S10 and S11 (ESI†) and the complied fitted results in Table S3 (ESI†), the best fit of BiAgSe2 can be achieved with the disordered model with two Bi–Se bonds. Hence, it is confirmed that there is a significant amount of local structural disordering in the Bi–Se shell of hexagonal BiAgSe2. Previously, it was already known from synchrotron power diffraction that there exist anti-site defects of Bi3+ and Ag+. Based on the EXAFS fitting of BiAgSe2, it is revealed that there exists a local structural distortion in the first coordination shell around Bi. In the best fit, the first shell of the Bi coordination in BiAgSe2 split into two portions: three Se at 2.8670 ± 0.0889 Å and three Se at 3.0748 ± 0.1308 Å. In the ideal hexagonal structure, the six Se atoms in the first shell are located at the same distance from Bi. This local structural distortion is clearly unveiled through the EXAFS fitting. Furthermore, the mean square relative displacement (MSRD, σ2), measuring the static and thermal disordering, of Bi–Se is quite large, indicating the nature of the highly disordered local structure in BiAgSe2.
However, BiAgSeTe is much more complicated. The best fitted results for Bi L3-edge cannot meet the criteria (R factor should be smaller than 0.02) for the structural determination for the hexagonal phase, cubic phase, as well as distorted phase. This implies that the structural disordering around Bi in BiAgSeTe is even larger than the pristine BiAgSe2. All of the structural disordering could be contributing to the low lattice thermal conductivity.
Next, we focus on the Se K-edge EXAFS fitting. In Fig. S12 and Table S4 (ESI†), the best fitted results are compared. By using the hexagonal phase BiAgSe2 model, we can fit the Se K-edge EXAFS spectra of BiAgSe2, although not sufficiently well. The mean square relative displacement (MSRD, σ2) for Se–Bi and Se–Ag is substantially large, indicating the large local structural disordering around the Se atoms. For the EXAFS methodology, the R-factor is the criteria for judging the quality of the fitting. The R-factor should be less than 0.02 for ideal fitting. Owing to the complex phase structures and local structural disordering, the best fit of the Se K-edge EXAFS of BiAgSeTe was achieved only with an R-factor of 0.07. There is a large discrepancy between the fitting model and the actual structure. Therefore, we could not resolve the local structure of BiAgSeTe more accurately. Nevertheless, it is suggested by the EXAFS fitting that BiAgSeTe consists of multiple local phases, which have different local structural configurations, but are packed in an ordered cubic lattice, consistent with XRD.
Conclusions
In this work, we synthesized the BiAgSe2−xTex (x = 0, 0.5, 1.5, 2) thermoelectric compounds using solid-state reaction. The lattice phase structures at room temperature were identified as the cubic phase with Bi and Ag occupying the 4a Wyckoff site. The electronic structures of BiAgSeTe were found to be distinctively different from BiAgSe2, thus rendering different temperature dependences of the thermoelectric parameters with respect to that of pristine BiAgSe2. By using the local structural probe, it was identified that there exist substantial structural disordering, mixed local structural phases and local structural distortions in BiAgSeTe. We revealed that the BiAgSe2 and BiAgSeTe based compounds possessed multiple local structural phases packed in an ordered lattice. It is feasible to improve the electrical transport properties and maintain extremely low thermal conductivity by atomic scale engineering. The origin of the low thermal conductivity of the actual samples could be induced by significant structural disordering, lone-pair electron induced lattice vibrational anharmonicity, and others. BiAgSeTe exhibits distinct transport properties owing to the disordering induced drastic changes in the electronic band structure, as well as the scattering dictated by the point defects. It is suggested that BiAgSe2 and BiAgSeTe could be promising candidates for phonon glass and crystal glass (PGEC)-type thermoelectrics.
