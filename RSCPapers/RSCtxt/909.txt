    , Accepted 31st May 2016First published on 31st May 2016AbstractA series of difluoroquinoxaline–thiophene based reduced band gap polymers was designed and synthesized by considering non-covalent coulombic interactions in a polymeric main chain. The insertion of different numbers of thiophene moieties allows for the adjustment of the absorption range, frontier energy levels, crystalline self-organization, film morphology and the resulting photovoltaic properties. A thick blend film of poly(thiophene-alt-(2,3-bis(3,4-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline)) (PDFQx-T):[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) showed a rough, inhomogeneous and largely phase-separated surface morphology compared to a typical film with ∼100 nm thickness. A similar trend was observed in the surface morphology of a poly(2,2′-bithiophene-alt-(2,3-bis(3,4-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline)) (PDFQx-2T) blend film, showing deteriorated photovoltaic properties with increasing film thickness. In contrast, poly(2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-alt-2,3-bis(3,4-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline) (PDFQx-3T) had a similar blend film morphology for both thick and thin active layers, showing a homogeneous and smooth morphology with a face-on orientation and tight π–π stacking (d-spacing = 3.6 Å). The optimized photovoltaic cell based on PDFQx-3T:PC71BM achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.74 V, a short-circuit current of 17.19 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.63 at an active layer thickness of ∼270 nm. It is still a challenge to develop photovoltaic polymers which allow efficient charge transport and extraction at a device thickness of ∼300 nm. Fine-adjustment of intra- and interchain interactions must be considered carefully to achieve high device properties for thick devices without deterioration in the blend morphology and charge recombination. This high PCE at an active layer thickness of ∼300 nm may suggest great potential for the mass production of printed polymer solar cells via industrial solution processes.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have attracted much attention due to their potential for use as low-cost, mechanically flexible and portable energy sources.1 Recently, OPV devices have been successfully demonstrated to have a power conversion efficiency of ∼9–11% using a single cell device architecture.2–8 During the last decade, extensive studies have been conducted to understand the ideal photovoltaic molecular structures, optimal device architecture, interfacial and BHJ morphological control, etc. In particular, photovoltaic materials that function well at ∼300 nm thickness are highly desirable for mass production via industrial solution casting.9–11 To obtain novel semiconducting materials with good performance on thicker devices, high charge carrier mobility10,12 and an ideal crystalline BHJ morphology13,14 should be carefully considered to overcome the limited charge transport and bimolecular recombination with increasing active layer thickness. The development of highly efficient photovoltaic materials in thick devices is still challenging.
Previously, we reported an easy and effective molecular design strategy to yield semi-crystalline reduced band gap photovoltaic polymers with conformational locks via intrachain (and/or interchain) non-covalent coulombic interactions such as hydrogen bonding and dipole–dipole interactions.4,15–18 The crystalline photovoltaic materials can induce high carrier transport and minimal charge carrier recombination with additional thermal and morphological stability compared to the amorphous ones.19,20 Donor (D)–acceptor (A) alternating copolymers with electronegative substituents (fluorine or oxygen) enhance the molecular ordering through intra- and intermolecular Coulomb interactions, showing remarkably high field-effect hole mobility (μh = 1.91 cm2 V s−1).15 Furthermore, non-covalent coulombic interactions minimize the torsional angle along the backbone and several planar semi-crystalline photovoltaic polymers have been successfully synthesized.17,18 In particular, a dialkoxyphenylene and difluorobenzothiadiazole-based poly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PPDT2FBT) copolymer exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼9% with long-term thermal stability at 130 °C for over 200 h in a conventional single-cell device structure with an ∼300 nm thick active layer.4 These results clearly suggest that the molecular design of photovoltaic polymers incorporating non-covalent interactions is very effective for improving electrical properties, energy conversion efficiency, device stability, etc.
In order to design reduced band gap photovoltaic polymers, quinoxaline (Qx)21–28 has been widely implemented as an electron-deficient comonomer that can be functionalized multiple times to control the electronic structure and solubility.29–35 In particular, 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline is a very useful building block because of its facile synthesis and chemical versatility.35,36 The para- and meta-positions of phenyl substituents can be functionalized with alkyl (or alkoxy) chains to endow solution processability, and the 6- and 7- positions on the quinoxaline unit can be also modified by introducing electronegative substituents such as fluorine and nitrile groups, modulating the electronic structures, intra- and/or interchain interactions (via F⋯H and F⋯S non-covalent coulombic attraction) of the resulting polymers. Recently, the introduction of fluorine atoms into the quinoxaline unit and/or the phenyl substituents of Qx-based conjugated polymers has helped to achieve a PCE of ∼8%.37–40
In this contribution, three different types of difluoroquinoxaline–thiophene based semi-crystalline LBG photovoltaic polymers, poly(thiophene-alt-(2,3-bis(3,4-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline)) (PDFQx-T), poly(2,2′-bithiophene-alt-(2,3-bis(3,4-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline)) (PDFQx-2T), and poly(2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-alt-2,3-bis(3,4-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline) (PDFQx-3T) were synthesized by considering non-covalent coulombic interactions inside a polymeric chain. Four linear octyloxy substituents were incorporated into the para- and meta-positions of the phenyl rings in the 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline moiety to endow solution processability. The functionalization of solubilizing substituents at the electron-deficient Qx moiety (in place of electron-rich moiety) does not increase the energy level of the valence band, maximizing the open-circuit voltage (VOC).17 The degree of crystalline self-organization of the photovoltaic polymers significantly influenced the BHJ film morphology and the resulting photovoltaic characteristics with [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor. Among this series of polymers, PDFQx-3T:PC71BM showed very attractive photovoltaic properties of PCE = 8% (VOC of 0.74 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.19 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.63) at an active layer thickness of ∼270 nm with a conventional single cell architecture. Contrary to the other two polymers, PDFQx-3T:PC71BM showed a similar film morphology for the thick and thin active layers. With the PDFQx-T and PDFQx-2T blends, inhomogeneity and larger phase separation were observed for thick films, which hinder charge transport and increase electron–hole recombination at thick devices with substantially decreased PCE. For an optimal BHJ morphology, fine adjustment of the crystallinity of donor polymers must be carefully considered in the molecular design by taking into account their miscibility with fullerene acceptors. The high energy conversion efficiency of PDFQx-3T at a thick active layer may suggest great potential for industrial mass production of large area solution-processed PSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Three different types of difluoroquinoxaline–thiophene based copolymers were synthesized by changing the number of thiophene moieties in the polymeric backbone. 2,3-Diphenylquinoxaline was functionalized with octyloxy side-chains on the meta- and para- positions of the phenyl ring and electronegative fluorine atoms were introduced in the 6- and 7- positions of the quinoxaline ring (Fig. 1a). The detailed synthetic procedures for the monomers and polymers are shown in Fig. 1 and Scheme S1.† 2,3-Bis(3,4-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-dibromo-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline (M1) was prepared by modifying the method reported in a previous literature.37 A Stille coupling reaction between M1 and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene yielded 2,3-bis(3,4-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-bis(2-thienyl)-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline (3) in ∼74% yield. Bromination of compound 3 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) produced 2,3-bis(3,4-bis(octyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-6,7-difluoroquinoxaline (M2) in ∼64% yield. Three types of difluoroquinoxaline–thiophene based polymers (PDFQx-T, PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-3T) (Fig. 1b) were prepared by a microwave-assisted Stille coupling polymerization between the corresponding monomers catalyzed by Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tolyl)3 in toluene (58–73% yield). All the polymers were readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, etc. The number-average molecular weight of the polymers was measured to be 36 kDa (polydispersity index (PDI) = 1.9), 56 kDa (2.6) and 85 kDa (1.8) for PDFQx-T, PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-3T, respectively, by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 80 °C using o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent. Thermal properties were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as shown in Fig. S1.† The onset decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of PDFQx-T, PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-3T was determined to be 403, 415 and 407 °C, respectively, suggesting high thermal stability of all polymers (Table 1). No discernible thermal transitions were observed from DSC measurements in a temperature range of 25–350 °C.

Computational simulation
The quinoxaline–thiophene based copolymers were designed by utilizing intrachain coulombic interactions (Fig. 1a) and modulating steric repulsion between adjacent alkoxy substituents with the incorporation of different numbers of thiophene spacers. In order to calculate the optimized geometries of the polymers, torsional profiles and the resulting minimum energy conformations were analyzed by the density functional theory (DFT, Jaguar quantum chemistry software, B3LYP/6-31G** level). As shown in Fig. S2,† the torsional profile shows the energy minimum angle at 18° between the thiophene and quinoxaline moieties where non-covalent coulombic interactions are expected between S (in thiophene) and N (in Qx), and between C–H (in thiophene) and F, inducing planarity in the backbone. The other energy minimum conformation was also expected at a torsional angle of 157°. These two torsional structures may be distributed randomly along the polymeric chain. The constructed planar backbone conformation could enhance the self-organization of polymers in films, significantly influencing the morphology of pristine and BHJ films. The delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in the polymeric structures plays an important role in hole and electron transport.43 The resulting electronic structures (based on two repeat units) of frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S3,† in which by increasing the number of thiophene units, the electron density of HOMO is gradually delocalized along the donor parts, which benefits intra- and intermolecular charge (hole) transport. The LUMO was mainly localized on the quinoxaline moiety, which was similar for all polymers.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the three polymers in chloroform and in thin film are shown in Fig. 2a and summarized in Table 1. PDFQx-T shows the maximum absorption at λabs = 532 nm in solution and 574 nm in film, showing a large band gap of 1.93 eV in film. Compared to the previously reported poly[6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline-alt-thiophene] (TQ-F),35 PDFQx-T shows a significantly different absorption spectrum. Both TQ-F and PDFQx-T have a difluoroquinoxaline–thiophene based backbone with a different number of octyloxy side-chains. The optical band gap was measured to be 1.80 eV for TQ-F and 1.93 eV for PDFQx-T, respectively. The red-shifted absorption of TQ-F suggests an enhanced effective conjugation compared to PDFQx-T, indicating a more efficient interchain organization in TQ-F. In addition, the four octyloxy side-chains may break the chain planarity, interrupt interchain packing and increase the band gap. PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-3T show clearly red-shifted spectra (relative to PDFQx-T), covering a broad wavelength range up to ∼750 nm in solution and in film. In film, both polymers show shoulder peaks at 667 nm for PDFQx-2T and 652 nm for PDFQx-3T, indicating a strong interchain organization via cofacial π–π stacking interactions. In contrast, PDFQx-T shows a clearly blue-shifted and featureless spectrum even in film, probably due to the amorphous nature of the polymer originating from the steric repulsion of neighboring bulky side-chains. This may break the chain planarity and hinder interchain organization. With a greater number of thiophene spacer moieties between the alkoxy-substituted quinoxalines, the steric hindrance decreases, enhancing the intrachain planarity and interchain ordering. The molar absorption coefficient was measured at each maximum absorption wavelength in chloroform, showing a similar value of εmax = 3.18–3.44 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for all polymers (Table 1). The optical band gap was determined to be 1.93, 1.71 and 1.73 eV for PDFQx-T, PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-3T, respectively, from the absorption onset point in film.

The electrochemical characteristics of the polymers were measured by cyclic voltammetry and the resulting voltammograms are depicted in Fig. 2b. From the onset oxidative potential, the HOMO energy level was estimated to be −5.76 eV for PDFQx-T, −5.67 eV for PDFQx-2T and −5.59 eV for PDFQx-3T, showing a gradual increase with more electron-rich thiophene units in the polymeric backbone. The LUMO levels were calculated to be −3.83, −3.96 and −3.86 eV for PDFQx-T, PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-3T, respectively, from the HOMO value and the corresponding optical band gap in films (Table 1).
Photovoltaic properties and morphology
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the three fluorinated quinoxaline–thiophene based polymers, we prepared conventional photovoltaic cells with a device structure of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate)/active layer/Al. In order to determine the optimum device fabrication conditions, several photovoltaic devices comprised of polymer:PC71BM were fabricated with different D:A blend ratios, processing additives and active layer thicknesses (Fig. S5 and Table S1, S2†). For all the quinoxaline–thiophene based polymers, the optimal devices were obtained at a blend ratio of polymer:PC71BM = 1:1.5 (weight ratio) using chlorobenzene (CB) and diphenylether (DPE) as the solvent and processing additive, respectively. Fig. 3a–c show the absorption spectra, J–V characteristics and incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the optimized devices. PDFQx-T and PDFQx-2T showed the best PCEs of 0.96% and 5.33% with VOC of 0.99 V and 0.79 V, JSC of 2.34 mA cm−2 and 11.69 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.41 and 0.57, respectively. The best photovoltaic properties were measured for PDFQx-3T:PC71BM, showing PCE = 8% with a VOC of 0.74 V, a JSC of 17.19 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.63 (Table 2). PDFQx-T and PDFQx-2T had the best photovoltaic properties with thin active layers in the range of ∼100 nm. Interestingly, PDFQx-3T exhibited slightly better photovoltaic efficiency with the thicker device (thickness of ∼270 nm). The thin film device (thickness of ∼115 nm) had a PCE of ∼7.73% (a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 14.06 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.72). The JSC values calculated from the IPCE spectra were 2.45 and 1.50 mA cm−2, 11.13 and 7.33 mA cm−2, 13.95 and 16.62 mA cm−2 for the thin and thick devices based on PDFQx-T, PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-3T, respectively, which are in good agreement with the experimental JSC values within 5% error. Upon increasing the active layer thickness (∼270 nm), the JSC increased substantially (14.06 → 17.19 mA cm−2) with a slight decrease in FF (0.72 → 0.63), indicating enhanced charge generation via increased light absorption without a substantial increase in the electron–hole recombination. From the viewpoint of industrial applications, it is of great importance to develop photovoltaic materials that can function effectively at a device thickness of ∼300 nm. Although organic molecules have larger absorption coefficients compared to inorganic silicon-based materials, it is not possible to completely absorb incident sunlight using ∼100 nm thick films. Organic BHJ films in the order of 250–300 nm, however, allow nearly complete attenuation of incident light. In addition, it is not currently viable to fabricate homogeneous and defect-free films in the range of ∼100 nm thickness using industrial solution casting techniques. ∼8% PCE with a device thickness of ∼270 nm indicates a very meaningful approach for industrial mass production of OPV devices. We also studied the thickness dependence of the measured JSC by comparison with the theoretically calculated value by transfer matrix formalism (Fig. 3d).44 While it is known that thick films are desirable for enhanced light absorption, most previous organic BHJ systems showed optimal performance with active layer thicknesses in the order of ∼100 nm, which is largely related to low charge carrier mobility, accumulated space charges and increased electron–hole recombination with thicker devices. It is still a challenge to develop OPV systems that allow efficient transport and extraction of charge carriers without significant recombination at device thicknesses of ∼300 nm.

On the other hand, PDFQx-T and PDFQx-2T had substantially lower PCEs with the thicker active layer (PDFQx-T: 0.58% with a VOC of 1 V, a JSC of 1.6 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.36; PDFQx-2T: 2.44% with a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 7.66 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.42) (Table 2). To elucidate the origin of the different behaviors of PDFQx-T (or PDFQx-2T) and PDFQx-3T devices, we studied the blend film surface morphologies by atomic force microscopy (AFM). For each polymer, two kinds of blend films were prepared with different thicknesses (thick: 240–270 nm and thin: 90–115 nm). The PDFQx-T blend film shows a very rough and inhomogeneous (largely phase-separated) morphology with a root-mean-square (rms) roughness of 7.7–8.0 nm. Interestingly, the thicker film shows a larger phase separation than the thin film (Fig. 4). This large phase separation can explain the poor photovoltaic properties of PDFQx-T compared to those of the PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-3T devices. In contrast, the PDFQx-3T blend shows a homogeneous surface with an rms roughness of 1.6–2.0 nm. Contrary to PDFQx-T, PDFQx-3T:PC71BM has a similar surface morphology to the thick and thin blend films, which is consistent with the similar photovoltaic properties for both thin and thick films. PDFQx-2T shows in-between characteristics where the surface becomes homogeneous compared to PDFQx-T, but the surface roughness of the thick film (6.7 nm) is substantially higher than that (3.7 nm) of the thin film.

The detailed interchain packing characteristics were also studied by two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD) using pristine and blended films with the same fabrication conditions for the optimized photovoltaic devices in Fig. 5. Among the three pristine polymer films evaluated, PDFQx-T showed the most disordered and amorphous morphology, with arc-shaped (100) and (010) scattering peaks (Fig. 5a). The amorphous nature showed good agreement with the tilted molecular structure and the substantially blue-shifted UV-vis spectrum relative to the other polymers. PDFQx-2T showed the hump-shape (100) scattering (d-spacing of 26.9 Å) and clear (010) π–π stacking (d-spacing of 3.67 Å) in the out-of-plane direction (Fig. 5b and Table S3†). PDFQx-2T is expected to have a randomly oriented interchain packing pattern based on the hump-shaped (100) peak. Compared to PDFQx-2T, PDFQx-3T showed two separate (100) peaks in the xy- and z directions, suggesting a more oriented structure in two specific directions (of the in-plane and out-of-plane) with preferential face-on π–π stacking (d-spacing of 3.65 Å) (Fig. 5c). In organic semiconductors, the co-existence of both packing patterns can potentially result in a 3D networked structure, which is beneficial for charge transport via interchain hopping.45 After blending with PC71BM, both PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-3T showed a similar scattering pattern (Fig. 5e and f) where the (100) lamellar scattering was measured in both xy and z directions, suggesting a bimodal interchain orientation. Interestingly, the (010) peak intensity (in the z direction) decreased substantially in the blend films. PC71BM may disrupt the interchain polymer packing by forming the BHJ morphology.

Charge carrier transport properties
To study the charge carrier transport characteristics in a thick film, the electron and hole mobilities were measured using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique.46 The hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au) and electron-only devices (FTO/active layer/Al, FTO: fluorine-doped tin oxide) were fabricated under the optimum photovoltaic device fabrication conditions (CB:DPE = 97:3 vol%). In order to ensure the accuracy of the measurements, the potential loss due to the series resistance (VRS) of ITO and the built-in potential (VO) was carefully considered. The J–V characteristics (Fig. 6) show a quadratic dependence on voltage over a range of several volts following the Mott–Gurney relationship.47 The average hole (electron) mobility was measured to be 6.9 × 10−6 (2.5 × 10−5), 2.2 × 10−4 (4.0 × 10−5) and 7.7 × 10−4 (6.5 × 10−4) cm2 V−1 s−1 for PDFQx-T, PDFQx-2T and PDFQx-3T blend devices, respectively (Table 3). The corresponding hole/electron mobility ratio was calculated to be 0.28 for PDFQx-T:PC71BM, 5.50 for PDFQx-2T:PC71BM and 1.18 for PDFQx-3T:PC71BM, respectively. The most balanced hole- and electron mobility was measured for PDFQx-3T:PC71BM, which supports an efficient charge extraction in an ∼270 nm thick film, resulting in higher FF and JSC values compared to those of the PDFQx-T and PDFQx-2T blend devices.

To further analyze the charge carrier dynamics of PDFQx-T, PDFQx-2T, and PDFQx-3T BHJ devices, we also measured the light intensity dependence of JSC and photocurrent (Jph) generation characteristics. In Fig. 7, the JSC as a function of the incident light intensity and bias dependent Jph are shown for thick and thin BHJ devices. The JSCvs. light intensity curve follows a power law dependence relationship of JSC ∝ Pα48 (where P is the incident light intensity and α is an exponential constant) under the short-circuit conditions. The α value was calculated to be 0.85, 0.88, and 0.97 for thick PDFQx-T (240 nm), PDFQx-2T (240 nm), and PDFQx-3T (270 nm) devices, respectively. The highest value (α = 0.97) for PDFQx-3T indicates less bimolecular charge recombination compared to PDFQx-T and PDFQx-2T. In the case of thin blend films, the calculated α value was 0.92, 0.94, and 0.97 for PDFQx-T (90 nm), PDFQx-2T (92 nm), and PDFQx-3T (115 nm), respectively. Interestingly, PDFQx-3T:PC71BM shows a similar α value for thick and thin BHJ films, suggesting similar charge recombination behaviors. In contrast, PDFQx-T and PDFQx-2T BHJ blend films show a smaller α for thick films compared to thin ones, indicating more serious charge recombination for thick films.

To examine the charge generation and extraction processes, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective applied voltage (Veff) was also measured. Jph is given by Jph = JL − JD,49 where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. Veff is defined by Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the compensation voltage where Jph is zero and V is the applied bias voltage. Fig. 7c and d show a log–log plot of Jphversus Veff for thick and thin blend films for the three polymers. The highest Jph was measured for the thick PDFQx-3T:PC71BM device and the Jph was measured to saturate at Veff = ∼0.6 V. On the other hand, the thick PDFQx-T and PDFQx-2T BHJ films showed no clear saturation in Jph with increasing Veff. The field-independent saturation in the PDFQx-3T blend film suggests negligible trapped charges and efficient charge extraction and collection. With regard to thick PDFQx-T and PDFQx-2T BHJ devices, significant electron–hole recombination is expected, where a stronger electric field is needed for sweeping out the photogenerated charge carriers and separating geminate electron–hole pairs.50 A similar trend was also measured for thin blend films. PDFQx-3T:PC71BM shows the highest Jph among the three polymer blends, indicating the most efficient charge generation and extraction. With decreasing film thickness, the Jph saturation voltage decreased from Veff = ∼0.6 V to ∼0.3 V. Interestingly, PDFQx-2T also showed a saturation of Jph at Veff = ∼1.0 V, suggesting that the charge extraction improves with decreasing film thickness due to the decreased electron–hole recombination probability with decreased charge transport path length. In the case of PDFQx-T, no clear Jph saturation was measured, indicating significant traps and charge recombination even in thin films where a stronger electric field is needed to sweep out the photogenerated charge carriers. The results are in good agreement with the molecular structures, film morphology and photovoltaic device properties.
Conclusions
In conclusion, three types of quinoxaline–thiophene based photovoltaic polymers were designed and synthesized by considering the backbone coplanarity via side-chain spacing and intrachain non-covalent coulombic interactions. The optimized conventional single-cell device of PDFQx-3T:PC71BM achieved a power conversion efficiency of 8% with a VOC of 0.74 V, a JSC of 17.19 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.63 at an ∼270 nm thick active layer, showing a semi-crystalline morphology with face-on π–π stacking (d-spacing, 3.6 Å). The other two polymers had a larger phase separation for the thicker blend films, showing deteriorated photovoltaic properties due to hindered charge transport and increased electron–hole charge recombination. In contrast, PDFQx-3T:PC71BM showed a similar blend film morphology for the thick and thin active layers. The thick device showed a substantially enhanced JSC (due to increased light absorption), resulting in improved PCE. For the industrial mass production of printed OPV devices, the active layer thickness needs to be controlled in the order of ∼300 nm. A comparison of the film morphology of thick and thin devices may suggest a simple way to conjecture the device properties by changing the thickness of the active layer. This study suggests that it is important to optimize the film morphology in the thicker device (thicknesses of ∼300 nm) and the findings here may contribute to the rationalization of the photovoltaic polymeric structure–property relationship for the mass production of large area solution-processed organic photovoltaic devices.
Experimental section
General

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL (JNM-AL300) FT NMR system operating at 300 MHz and 75 MHz, respectively. UV-vis spectra were obtained with a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer. The number- and weight- average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC, Agilent GPC 1200 series) with o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 80 °C, relative to polystyrene standards. Thermogravimetric analysis (2050 TGA V5.4A) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC Q200 V24.4) measurements were performed at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen (purity, 99.999%). Cyclic voltammetry data were measured on a Versa STAT3 (Princeton Applied Research) with a three-electrode cell employing a platinum wire as the counter electrode, a platinum electrode coated with a thin polymer film as the working electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate in CH3CN at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Veeco AFM microscope in the tapping mode. Electron and hole carrier mobilities were measured by the space charge limited current method by fabricating hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au) and electron-only (FTO/active layer/Al, FTO: fluorine-doped tin oxide) diodes. 2D-GIXRD measurements were carried out at the PLS-II 9A U-SAXS beam line of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory, Korea.4
Fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic devices
The solar cell devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with detergent, then sequentially ultra-sonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol and dried in an oven overnight at 100 °C. The PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated (after filtration through a 0.45 μm filter) at 5000 rpm for 40 s, baked at 140 °C for 10 min in air and moved into a nitrogen filled glove box. Solutions (30 mg mL−1) of PDFQx-T:PC71BM, PDFQx-2T:PC71BM, and PDFQx-3T:PC71BM (blend ratio = 1:1.5 by weight) in chlorobenzene:diphenyl ether (97:3 vol%) were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The devices were then brought under vacuum (<10−6 Torr), and a 100 nm thick Al electrode was deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation. The deposited Al electrode area defined the active area of the devices as 13 mm2. Measurements were carried out inside the glove box using a high quality optical fiber to guide the light from the solar simulator. J–V characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a Keithley 2635A source measurement unit. IPCE measurements were conducted in air using an IPCE system (Model QEX7) by PV measurements Inc. (Boulder, Colorado).
Optical simulation
In order to investigate the optical properties and photocurrent generation capacity of PDFQx-3T, optical constants (n: refractive index, κ: extinction coefficient) were calculated and transfer matrix modeling (TMM) was performed. The κ value was derived from the absorption coefficient, ε, via the relationship κ = λε/4π. The n value was similarly derived from α via the Kramers–Kronig relationship as described in a previous report.51JSC was estimated based on the active layer absorption, assuming that each photon absorbed in the active layer leads to the generation and extraction of one electron–hole pair. Transfer matrix simulations were taken as the average of 3 calculations for optical stacks in which the active layer thickness was varied by ±5%, resulting in a good match between the simulated active layer absorption and the observed IPCE.
