Under these circumstances, bismuth halide perovskite (BHPs) have gained considerable attention due to their high defect tolerance and excellent photo-, moisture, and thermal stabilities. Interest in BHPs also has stimulated investigations into colloidal nanoparticles, and empathetically the efforts of various researchers are underway to synthesize BHP NCs exhibiting similar emissive properties matching those of LHP NCs. The BHP NCs still suffer from low photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQYs), large band gaps, large exciton binding energies, and effective carrier masses. Therefore, the current perspective lays out our analytical views on improving strategies for the BHP NC research to flourish. Here, we provide insights on the advances in the energy landscapes, which remain critical for various optoelectronic applications. We also provide a glimpse into the challenges, advances, and potential future directions for the uses of BHP NCs in commercial sectors ranging from LEDs, photodetectors, electronic memristors, photovoltaics and photocatalytic applications.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites have gained tremendous popularity following their promising applicability in various optoelectronic devices. Ever since their inception, researchers have tailored all forms of perovskites starting from layered polycrystalline thin films to single crystals and NCs.1–3 In the form of NCs, these materials can perform as excellent light emitters with high PLQYs and tunable emission wavelengths. The origin of the superior performance of perovskites lies in their appealing optoelectronic properties.4–6 Despite their impressive performances, lead halide perovskites (LHPs) still suffer from two major issues: stability and toxicity.7,8 Although considerable research has been devoted to improving the stability, rather less attention has been paid to tackle the toxicity issues because almost all the best performing optoelectronic devices were made of lead-based perovskites.9–12 Nevertheless, it is found that human exposure to lead can have severe implications on nervous and reproductive systems.13 Upon moderate exposure to humidity and oxygen, the perovskites degrade into harmful materials that may leach out into the environment.14 The public awareness of such high toxicity will ultimately hamper the lead-based optoelectronic market. Hence there is an acute need to develop novel non-toxic materials that can equalize the performance of LHPs.
To remove the inherently toxic Pb2+, researchers had initially replaced Pb2+ with Sn2+ and Ge2+.15,16 However, Sn2+ and Ge2+ readily oxidize to Sn4+ and Ge4+ because of the high energy lying 5s orbital, which decreases the device performances.17–19 On the other hand, the 6p orbital of lead plays a critical role in the band structure of the conventional perovskites, where the dispersive and shallow 5p orbital of Sn2+ fails to fulfil. Therefore, similar isoelectronically structured cations such as Bi3+ and Sb3+ have been thoroughly investigated recently.20–22 In particular, bismuth halide materials have attracted significant attention due to their high stability and defect tolerance.23,24 In Bi3+, the lone pair of electrons present in the ns2 orbital tends to create antibonding interactions at the valence band maximum, due to which the defect states are confined to the shallow levels at the band edges.25 Park et al. first demonstrated bismuth-based solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 1.09% for Cs3Bi2I9 and 0.12% for MA3Bi2I9.26 From then, numerous different structures have been studied.27
Since the Bi3+ cations replaced Pb2+, the structural composition of the perovskite no longer exists in the form ABX3. Hence the perovskite-inspired bismuth halide structures are categorized into two major entities known as the ion-splitting (double perovskites) and vacancy ordered structures. The ion-splitting subcategory can be divided additionally into double perovskites with the empirical formula of A2B(I)BiX6 (Fig. 1a and b) and chalcogenide perovskites with the empirical formula ABi(ChX2) (Fig. 1c) (ex: MABiSI2), where A is the cation with +1 charge, Ch is the chalcogenide atom, and X represents the halogen. The vacancy-ordered structures have a molecular formula of A3□Bi2X9 (Fig. 1d–g), A3□BiX6 (Fig. 1h and i), A□Bi2X7 (Fig. 1j and k) and A□BiX4, where □ indicates the vacancy.32 There are other miscellaneous perovskite variants such as Rb7Bi3Cl16 and A□Bi2X7, which also classify under vacancy ordered structures. Nonetheless, it should be noted that all the structures mentioned above are not necessarily NCs. For instance, a typical A3Bi2X9 compound has two polymorphs.30 One is the alleged dimer modification that comprises individual face-shared [B2X9]3− bioctahedra, as shown in Fig. 1d and e, and the other is the layer modification that can be viewed as a vacancy-ordered layered perovskite as shown in Fig. 1f and g. The formation ability of the polymorphs depends on the A cation and X anion chosen. In the A3Bi2I9 perovskite when A = K+, Rb+, it adopts 2D, whereas when, A = CH3NH3+, Cs+, it adopts 0D.33,34,93 Moreover, in the case of chlorides and bromides the above mentioned trend can differ. As the formation of BHPs does not follow any trend; therefore, classifying the BHPs according to the dimension is impossible.

The layered and vacancy ordered A3Bi2X9 crystallizes with the P3m1 space group, where two-thirds of the octahedral sites are filled with bismuth ions, and one-third are left empty to maintain the charge neutrality. Hence, the double layers are formed by the [BiBr6]3− octahedral frameworks through corner-sharing. Other vacancy ordered perovskites such as A3□BiX6, and A□BiX4 can be crystallized depending upon the growth mechanisms and the size of the A cation. On the other hand, the double perovskites (A2BBiX6) are replaced by two Pb2+ ions with a B+ and Bi3+ to crystalize in the Fmm space group. A few exemplary cations that can be used in place of B+ are Na+, K+, Rb+, Cu+, Ag+, Au+, In+, and Tl+ (Fig. 2). With the cation and anion combinations, a lot of double perovskites can be realized. However, most of the crystals synthesized so far exist in the bulk form except for CsNaBiCl6 and CsAgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, and I), which exist as both bulk and NCs. Besides, the double perovskites and vacancy ordered BHP NCs, the structure of A3BiX6 was also reported in the literature with different optical properties. However, the fine structure and pure phase of A3BiX6 is yet to be achieved.

Although bismuth-based perovskites exist in various forms (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D), presented herein is the recent progress in bismuth-based perovskite NCs (0D) for various optoelectronic applications. The major advantage of BHP materials over other low-toxic III–V NCs is to offer “vacancy-ordered” structures that accommodate heterovalent elements directly into the perovskite lattice. The organized [BX6]3− octahedral voids are filled with new elements, thus allowing them to double or triple the unit cell. Importantly, BHP QDs allows for a series of mono, di, and even trivalent elements to be incorporated in the crystal while maintaining the crystal lattice with reduced dimensionality. Therefore, such an arrangement permits for realizing nanomaterials with fascinating optical properties and high stabilities. Albeit numerous perspectives and review articles cover an entire range of lead-free compounds, they merely touch the surface of BHP NCs. Hence, we report an in-depth perspective exclusively on BHP NCs. In particular, the present article covers the rich compositional diversity of the nanocrystal synthesis, their optical properties, and applications across various optoelectronic devices. With the advent of NCs as an advantageous material in offering a large surface area, strong absorption, and controlled charge transport, they have increased tremendous interest in developing novel devices and even exploring new avenues. Given the current status of the BHPs, the perspective of the NC challenges and outlook are discussed herein. At last, an attempt is made to identify the prospects and potential applications of BHP NCs. This article can benefit all the groups specialized in perovskite NCs, novel synthesis methods, theoretical chemistry, and advanced characterization techniques.
2. Synthetic strategies
To date, various methodologies have been used to synthesize BHP NCs. Most of the approaches are adopted from all-inorganic and organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite colloidal NCs. Among the most developed methods the hot-injection, anti-solvent recrystallization, post-synthetic methods, and ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) ones are being widely used. Out of all the methods, anti-solvent recrystallization is the most facile strategy to synthesize NCs. Here, a precursor solution containing (metal salts in high polar solvents) is added to the non-polar solvents while vigorously stirring immediately forming NCs. The size of NCs depends on the temperature, nature of solvents, and anti-solvents. In contrast, in the hot injection method, the A cation solution (in the form of Cs-oleate or methylamine) is injected into a hot solution (up to 200 °C) containing metal salts and surfactants. As the solution is injected, a rapid salt metathesis reaction occurs, forming metal halide ternary NCs. The post-synthetic methods are mainly developed to tune the optical properties and to improve the stability of NCs in the solid and liquid state. Various post-synthetic methods involve surface passivation, cationic, and anionic exchange methods. The anion exchange strategy is a method to synthesize one type of halide NCs from the another existing type of halide NCs. Here the desired halide (X) source solution is prepared by the addition of OA–X to a polar solvent like DMF and the mixture is swiftly added to the existing NCs. The LARP method is based on the reprecipitation of halide salts in the presence of ligands. It involves two steps, (i) metal halide salts are dissolved in one or more highly polar solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or gamma butyrolactone (GBL), and then (ii) the above-mentioned solution is injected dropwise into the non-polar solvents containing ligands; oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA). Importantly, BHP NCs were first reported in 2016 using the LARP method. Due to the low quantum yields, other modified strategies have been implemented. Other lesser known techniques include the weak-polar solvents at room temperature (WPRT) method, the tip sonicator method, and continuous flow method. Recently, the tip sonicator method was used to synthesize Cs3Bi2I9 NCs however these NCs showed low PLQYs35 while Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs synthesized through WPRT have better PLQYs.36 Although, the continuous flow method greatly improves the reproducibility of the NCs, surprisingly it has not been used to synthesize the BNP NCs to date (Fig. 3).

3. Optoelectronic properties
Usually, intrinsic bismuth-based perovskites tend to have large band gaps of more than 2 eV, making them an unfavorable photovoltaic material. Some theoretical studies showed that the band gap of the double perovskite could be tuned from 0.5 eV to 2.7 eV.29 Lijun Zhang, and co-workers have proposed 11 non-toxic and stable double perovskites as a replacement for LHP NCs. Among these bismuth-based double perovskite NCs, only Cs2AgBiX6 has been extensively studied.37–41 These double perovskite NCs exhibit extremely large band gaps and high exciton binding energies making them unsuitable for photovoltaic applications.42–44 Moreover, the bismuth-based double perovskite NCs are indirect in nature resulting in low PLQYs when compared to the vacancy-ordered BHP NCs. Notably, chlorides of both the double perovskite and vacancy ordered BHP NCs tend to have large band gaps while iodides have low band gaps. As the halogen X changes from chlorine to iodine, the band gap of BHP NCs decreases. A trend can be observed from Table 1 which suggests that the effect on the band gap is due to the altered Bi–X bond lengths and angles in the [BiX6]3− and [Bi2X9]3− bioctahedra.

In semiconductor physics, the nature of the band gap is determined based on the crystal momenta of both valence and conduction bands. Usually, in the double perovskite (Cs2AgBiCl6) the valence-band maximum (VBM) has Cl-p, Ag-d, and Bi-s characters at Γ and the conduction band minimum (CBM) has Cl-p, Bi-p, and Ag-s characters at L.45 The indirect band gap of Cs2AgBiCl6 can be attributed to the interaction caused between the Ag-4d orbitals and the 3p/4p orbitals of the halide ion leading to the modification of the valence band. Besides, the addition of Ag supports the octahedral coordination of the halogens and hence cannot be removed or omitted. Thus, the difference in the orbital overlap of the neighbouring cations determines its nature to be direct or indirect. By selecting the neighbouring cations with identical orbital symmetry, one may engineer the electronic band structure and nature of the band gap. Bin Yang et al. modified the nature of the Cs2AgBiCl6 band gap from indirect to direct by alloying with indium.45 Recently, Qian Li et al. also engineered the band gap of Cs2AgBiBr6 by imparting pressure-induced changes.40 However, they showed that the reduced band gap was retained partially even after removing the pressure. Another way to tune the band gap is through alloying. The incorporation of Sb3+ into Cs2AgBiBr6 can significantly reduce the band gap by 0.41 eV.41 Moreover, alloying with Ru3+ also lowered the band gaps of bulk BHPs.46 Therefore the alloying strategy can be implemented in BHP NCs to significantly decrease the band gap.
Similarly, vacancy ordered BHP NCs show large band gaps; however, they are mostly direct in nature. Table 1 below summarizes the band gaps and the nature of band gaps for various BHP NCs. It can be observed that most of the vacancy-ordered BHP NCs exhibit direct band gaps resulting in large PLQYs as high as 54.1%.47 For indirect band gaps, the participation of phonons in the recombination pathways can affect the PLQYs. A few studies show that some vacancy-ordered BHP NCs can simultaneously accommodate both direct and indirect band gaps.21,48 For instance, Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs obtained through LARP showed a direct transition while the same NCs synthesized through the weak-polar solvent at room temperature (WPRT) method showed dual transitions.48,49 Nevertheless, the occurrence of these dual transitions is still unknown. Taking Cs3Bi2I9 NCs as an example, theoretical calculations using the hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functional indicated that they exhibits an indirect band gap of 2.1 eV.50 However, experimental methods showed a direct band gap of 2.05 eV.51 Often there are many inconsistencies in determining the exact nature of the band gaps. It can be argued that these indirect optical transitions may stem from a lot of reasons, including discrepancies in synthetic methods, nanocrystal interactions with the solvent environment and labile ligands. Hence, more in-depth studies should be carried out, which predict the real reasons for the nature of the band gaps.
Impurities and defects in the semiconductors often impede the performance of the devices, as the defects act as trap sites in the band gap. Although interstitial defects are not prominent defects, however, when formed can lead to deep traps.64 One of the most striking features of BHP NCs is their endurance to defects. BHP NCs are intrinsically more defect tolerant than their lead counterparts. This is due to the antibonding interactions at the valence band of the ns2 lone pair.25,65 The antibonding hybridization between the 6s orbital of bismuth and p orbitals of halogens upshifts the valence band resulting in the defects to move closer or inside the velance band. To provide a better insight into orbital interactions, we have compared the band structures of CsPbBr3 (Fig. 4a) and Cs3Bi2Br9 (Fig. 4b). The density of states (DOS) diagram of Cs3Bi2Br9 clearly depicts antibonding interaction hybridization of the 6s orbital and 4p orbital of bromine, resulting in the upshift of the valence band when compared to CsPbBr3.
 Fig. 4  (a and b) shows the comparison between the band structure and atomic projected density of states of both CsPbBr3 (top panel) and Cs3Bi2Br9 (bottom panel). The comparison of orbital-projected density of states is shown for both CsPbBr3 (top panel) and Cs3Bi2Br9 (bottom panel). Reprinted with permission from ref. 28, 68 and 69. 
The stability of NCs plays a vital role in their long-term evolution. Usually, NCs offer high stability towards moisture when compared to their 2D and 3D counterparts counterparts. However, LHP NCs offer low stability towards humidity, temperature, and structure, preventing them from commercialization.66 Despite the poor performances, bismuth-based perovskites exhibit superior stability. Recently, a large number of research groups have shown high moisture and air stability of bismuth-based perovskites, making them a highly promising alternative to LHP NCs.23,37,58,67 It is widely accepted that the large organic ligands around the crystals prevent the moisture from entering into the crystals. Double perovskites of Cs2AgBiBr6/Cl6 show relatively higher air stability when compared to LHP NCs.
XRD studies of Cs2AgBiCl6 indicate no noticeable changes even after placing in ambient air for three weeks.33 Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs appear considerably stable when tested under a relative humidity of 55% and at 50 °C under a halogen lamp.29 Notably, MA2AgBiBr6 is stable in air and moisture, yet, exhibiting a decomposition temperature higher than MAPbBr3.67 This indicates that the absence of organic cations likely increases the thermal stability. Concerning the A3Bi2X6, MA3Bi2X9 NCs were first synthesized in 2016. These quantum dots are found to have superior alcohol stability; however, they lack moisture stability. It is believed that water reacts with BiCl3 and BiBr3 forming white precipitates of BiOCl and BiOBr, respectively, eventually, after one-week storage in an ambient atmosphere.58 MA3Bi2I9, when devised, is stable in air for a maximum of 10 days.70 Contrastingly, many studies on Cs3Bi2X9 display excellent moisture stability for over 30 days.23,37,71 The high moisture and air-stability can be attributed to the all-inorganic nature.37
Besides the air stability, the thermal stability of MA3Bi2I9 is relatively far better when compared to LHP NCs. The increase in temperature from −50 °C to 140 °C showed no phase transformation, unlike in LHPs that change from the orthorhombic phase to cubic or hexagonal at higher temperatures.24,72 Additionally, other groups have reported similar observations for double perovskites.67 Thermogravimetric analysis of (MA)2AgBiBr6, and Cs2AgBiBr6 shows no decomposition till ∼550 K and ∼700 K, respectively.67 However, a few studies have shown that the reaction temperatures of above 200 °C for more extended periods can change the phase from cubic to tetragonal leading to structural instability in Cs2AgBiBr6.453Cs2AgBiBr6 → Cs3Bi2Br9 + Cs3BiBr6 + 3Ag + 3/2Br2
Another notable issue is the instability of the NCs during the purification process upon treatment with polar solvents under atmospheric conditions that limit their use in several potential applications. Some studies show that certain double perovskites such as Cs2AgBiBr6 are unstable in colloidal solutions but are stable in solid thin films.73 The instability in colloidal solutions is attributed to the isolated [BiX6]3− impurities in the solvent.
4. Challenges and future directions
Despite their excellent stability, many challenges, as well as obstructions should be addressed before commercialization. The bismuth-based perovskite NCs are currently suffering from meager PLQYs. A maximum PLQY of 54.1% has been recently reported.47 There is still much room left for them to improve. Apart from the low PLQYs, their applicability in the solar cell applications remains quite a challenging question. The challenge majorly lies in the retention of fundamental properties such as absorption coefficient, band gap, charge transport, and ease of fabrication. More importantly, quantum dots are extremely sensitive to their sizes. It is challenging to obtain uniform sizes in each batch and hence leads to poor optical performances.
Origins of low PLQYs
Usually, in NCs, the main reason for low quantum yield is due to the presence of trap states, which include surface trapping states, self-trapping, and volume traps (metal traps and interstitial halogen).37,74,75Fig. 5b illustrates the various processes of recombination mechanisms in the BHP NCs. The origin of photoluminescence in the bismuth-based perovskites is still poorly understood, with specific reports claiming that PL originated from quantum confinement,39,54 while others attribute it to the localized Bi 6s–6p transition of the non-confined exciton.45 A few also believe that the large band gaps of BHP NCs result in emission in the deep blue and violet region, a region in which high PLQYs are always difficult for most perovskite QDs.76 It is widely argued that bismuth-based perovskite NCs suffer from a self-trapping phenomenon, where excitons are trapped in a state with the assistance of strong exciton-phonon coupling creating transient elastic lattice distortions.77,78
 Fig. 5  (a) shows the formation of the intra bands and shallow states in BHP. (b) Illustrates the charge carrier dynamics of photoluminescence in BHP NCs. 
These distortions stabilize the exciton affording a significant Stokes shift in the PL spectrum. Recent studies confirmed the presence of self-trapping in both ion-splitting and ordered vacancy bismuth-based structures.47,73 Few studies also confirm the presence of surface trap states where the ultrafast charge carriers are trapped and can reduce PLQYs drastically. These mid-gap states promote non-radiative recombination of charge carriers, which lower the luminescence efficiencies. It is also noted that the presence of non-radiative recombination pathways favored by the indirect band gaps can also lead to low PLQYs.21 However, more systematic studies combined with experimentation and computation are needed to determine the exact nature of photoluminescence in BHP NCs.

Optimized methods adopted toward high PLQYs
Usually, bismuth-based double perovskites exhibit much lower PLQYs when compared to the vacancy-ordered perovskite NCs because of the direct electronic transitions. To change the nature of band gaps, Bin Yang et al. alloyed bismuth-based double perovskites with indium. As the concentration of indium increased from 0 to 90%, a sudden rise in the PLQY is observed after 50% doping, leading to a PLQY of 36.6%.45 In another study doping the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs with Eu3+ improved the PLQYs to 42.4%. The highest PLQY for the undoped bismuth double perovskite is recorded for Cs2AgBiCl6 with 6.7%52 whereas the vacancy-ordered BHP NCs because of the direct transitions tend to have high PLQYs. Leng et al. improved the PLQY of MA3Bi2Br9 to 54.1% using chlorine passivation, which reduced the surface defects and enhanced the radiative recombination.47 In another study, Lou et al. used the post-synthetic anion exchange and surface passivation strategies to increase the PLQYs of Cs3Bi2X9 to 62%, 22%, and 2.3% (X = Cl, Br, and I respectively). Therefore, the improvement in the PLQYs can be attributed to the surface passivation strategies and reducing the surface traps states.
Feasible approaches to improve PLQYs
Surface passivation is often considered a necessary strategy to eliminate the trap states.79,80 Out of the several passivation approaches, forming core–shell structures is the best strategy to terminate the dangling bonds and improve the PLQYs. The shell coating can effectively prevent aggregation of NCs and consequently results in non-radiative energy transfer. This strategy was first reported by Spanhel et al. for the passivation of CdS NCs, and a drastic change in the PLQY from 1 to 50% was observed upon the introduction of the Cd(OH)2 shell around the CdS core.81 Moreover, the recent CsPbBr3/CdS core–shell demonstrated high stability and high PLQY.82 Other low-toxic III–V quantum dots such as InP have also shown to have high PLQYs of >80% using the core–shell strategies with ZnS as the shell.83–85 Similarly, in bismuth-based perovskites, the introduction of the shell may provide a sufficient potential barrier for any photoexcited holes and electrons present inside the core NCs. For passivation of BHP NCs, shell materials such as organic polymers, ZnS, SiO2 and AlOx can be used. Further, when choosing the shell material, it is essential to see that there is no lattice mismatch between the core and shell material. The thickness of the shell should be tuned to improve the PLQY. Moreover, to strengthen the passivation, duel shells should be encased to the NCs for better protection. The dual shell systems not only do increase the stability towards moisture but also increase the quantum confinement, which ultimately leads to higher PLQYs. Very recently, Yanjie He et al. showed an unconventional route to synthesize polymer-ligand/SiO2 double-shell LHP NCs.86 Such a dual-shelled system has however not been incorporated into BHP NCs. Therefore, there is a huge scope for improvement in the PLQYs using these strategies (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Illustration of the various surface passivation strategies to enhance the PLQYs of BHP NCs. 
Another strategy of improving the PLQY is by introducing ligands to passivate the surface trap sites. The self-assembly of ligands passivates the surface of NCs. These tailored ligands, therefore, stabilize the NCs and increase the degree of quantum confinement. Molecular surface functionalization by simple aliphatic ligands such as oleylamine and oleic acid may initially seem to passivate the NCs. Upon dilution or washing, these ligands readily desorbed and remove the passivation. Hence, self-assembled silanes and halogen rich ligands can effectively passivate the traps. Also, the surface of the BHP NCs can be passivated by the treatment of fluorine rich long chains and short-chain ligands of TMA and PFI. Moreover, ligand exchange strategies can be used to replace with short ligands such as DDAB, OPA, sulfobetaine, and phosphocholine. The chemical structures of all the ligands are listed in Fig. 7. Further, it is important to choose ligands that have strong electron-withdrawing ability and steric hindrance, and high hydrophobicity. Usage of such ligands effectively passivates the surface and facilitates both charge injection and transport. The zwitterion ligands bond tightly with the BHP NCs even after recrystallization; hence they can retain their high photoluminescence. Additional improvement in the PLQY can be achieved through adopting novel synthetic routes that would strongly passivate the ligands.

Outlook for potential applications
Bismuth based double perovskite NCs are shown to have good energy discrimination; therefore, they can be used in X-ray detectors and photocatalysis. These materials have large indirect band gaps, weak emission peaks, and low charge carrier transport, making them an unviable application in solar cells. However, many researchers argue that the long carrier lifetimes and extremely fast electron transport to ETLs makes them interesting to study and understand the charge dynamics for efficient lead-free solar cells.87
Vacancy ordered bismuth perovskites have direct band gaps, strong light absorption and high luminescence properties making them applicable in solar cells, light-emitting devices, photocatalysis, and memristors. The utilization of BHP NCs in CO2 reduction is an entirely new scientific field which has been getting prominence recently. Due to their durability and catalytic activity, BHP NCs can have potential applications in energy storage. Herein we bring few examples where BHP NCs have been successfully implemented into various optoelectronic devices discussed earlier (Fig. 8). For instance, Cs3Bi2X9 NCs were employed as photocatalysts to catalyze degradation of certain water contaminant organic dyes.88 Lei Zhou et al. reported Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs as photocatalysts in CO2 reduction (Fig. 8).54

5. Summary & outlook
Overall, BHP NCs have excellent optoelectronic properties and great stabilities. The performance of BHP NCs is relatively lower in certain aspects, but the future looks promising for high performance. In this perspective, we discussed the current status of bismuth halide perovskite NCs, explicitly detailing their challenges and plausible methods to overcome them. Among the various properties, stabilities, tolerance to defects, nature of band gaps, and luminescence properties are elaborately discussed. Although both bismuth-based vacancies ordered and double perovskite NCs show relatively similar stabilities, their optoelectronic properties are significantly different. The low PLQYs in the double perovskite NCs are attributed to the weak indirect band transitions. On the other hand, vacancy ordered BHP NCs due to their direct band gap nature tend to exhibit relatively high PLQYs; however, they are found to be low when compared to those of the LHP NCs. The low PLQYs in vacancy ordered structures were explained by several reasons such as the presence of surface traps, and self-trap states. Contrastingly this undermines the intrinsic defect tolerance nature of BHPs. Therefore, more studies are required to clearly identify the reasons behind low PLQYs. Undoubtedly, BHP NCs have the full potential to replace LHP NCs, provided a few questions and insights listed below are investigated in-depth.
• As BHP NCs have relatively larger band gaps than LHP NCs, can a lucrative tool such as doping effectively reduce the band gaps of these materials?
• What could be the reasons for obtaining the dual optical transitions in a single material? Does the nature of the band gap rely on the synthetic method of the NCs?
• Can low PLQYs of bismuth halide double perovskite NCs be attributed only to the weak indirect transitions and self-trapped excitons? Are there any other processes such as low quantum confinement in these materials which play a role in low PLQYs?
• Can doping, core–shell, dual shell systems, and strong ligands improve the PLQYs?
• Are there effective strategies to synthesize the vacancy ordered BHP NCs with low surface defects?
• Reports are suggesting that self-trapping exciton causes low PLQYs in BHPs. How can we suppress the self-trapping exciton effect in BHP NCs?
