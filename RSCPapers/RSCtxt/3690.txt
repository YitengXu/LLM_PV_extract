    , Accepted 11th February 2016First published on 12th February 2016AbstractAn effective Mo-based ternary oxide Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation was prepared via a simple and direct thin film synthesis route. The synthesis strategy involved subjecting a MoO3 thin film, prepared by anodising a Mo foil, to hydrothermal treatment in the presence of a bismuth salt solution. The new approach removes the need for preformed particles to prepare the film, in turn providing a robust and stable anode for PEC water splitting. X-ray diffraction of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film revealed the film possessed two photocatalytically active phases of Bi2MoO6: (i) a low temperature phase (γ(L)-Bi2MoO6), and (ii) a high temperature phase (γ(H)-Bi2MoO6). UV-vis spectroscopy showed the optical band gaps of γ(L)-Bi2MoO6 and γ(H)-Bi2MoO6 were 2.75 eV and 3.1 eV, respectively. In contrast, the neat MoO3 thin film had a wider band gap of 3.4 eV. Transforming the surface MoO3 into Bi2MoO6 to construct the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 composite electrode leads to an improvement in photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance. The Bi2MoO6/MoO3 electrode exhibited a 79% enhancement in anodic photocurrent density compared to the unmodified MoO3 thin film under a positive bias of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The better performance was attributed to: (i) the narrow optical band gap of Bi2MoO6, which extended the absorption of light by the film into the visible range and (ii) the well-aligned band structure of MoO3 and Bi2MoO6. The Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film electrode was subsequently utilised as a photoanode for PEC water splitting. The Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film electrode provided close to 100% faradic photocurrent-to-O2 conversion efficiency for PEC water splitting under UV illumination and, importantly, exhibited excellent photostability as a consequence of the unique synthesis method.
Introduction
Sunlight-driven water splitting using a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell, in which a thin film photoanode is utilised to harvest solar energy and generate electron–hole pairs to evolve H2 and O2 gases at the cathode and anode surfaces, respectively, is a promising means of making solar fuels to address the demand for a clean and sustainable energy supply.1 A major obstacle facing the construction of an efficient PEC water splitting cell is the need for a robust and stable water oxidation catalyst that can effectively produce molecular O2 at a high rate with good efficiency and which has a long lifetime.2 During water splitting, the oxidation half-reaction is a complicated process involving a four electron transfer mechanism. In contrast, the reduction half-reaction is relatively easier and involves the transfer of two electrons. From this perspective, it is more challenging to develop highly effective photoanodes. In addition, developing photoanodes with band structures that match the solar spectrum is crucial to capture the full potential of the Sun's energy. As a result, recent research efforts have been directed towards developing high performance photoanodes. For photoactive semiconductors to display good water oxidation properties, the valence band potential of the semiconductors has to be more positive than the water oxidation potential, i.e. more oxidising. Many metal oxides meet the valence band requirement. However, most metal oxide photoanodes which exhibit stability under illumination and in aqueous conditions, e.g. TiO2, have a wide band gap and are consequently insensitive to the visible range of the solar spectrum (∼43%).3,4 Only a few native metal oxide photoanode materials are known to absorb visible light, e.g. WO3 (Eg = 2.8 eV)5 and Fe2O3 (Eg = 2.2 eV).6 To utilise sunlight efficiently for solar water oxidation, research strategies need to be formulated to shift the spectral response of UV-active metal oxides into the visible range, or to develop alternative oxides with visible light responses and sufficiently energetic valence bands.
The ternary oxides of bismuth such as BiVO4 (Eg = 2.4 eV), Bi2WO6 (Eg = 2.8 eV) and Bi2MoO6 (Eg = 2.7 eV) have attracted much research interest as photoanode candidates in recent years due to their near-ideal band gaps and band edge positions.7–12 Bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6) is an n-type semiconductor. The Aurivillius oxide (γ-Bi2MoO6) possesses a unique layered structure with perovskite slabs of MoO6 octahedra sandwiched between alternating (Bi2O2)2+ layers. γ-Bi2MoO6 is a visible light-driven semiconductor with a narrow band gap of 2.7 eV. Its valence band has been demonstrated to be suitably energetic for the water oxidation reaction under visible light irradiation in a powder suspension photocatalytic water splitting reaction.9 Despite the suitable optical band structure of Bi2MoO6 for solar water oxidation, the study of Bi2MoO6 as a photoanode for PEC water splitting systems to date is relatively limited when compared to Bi2WO6 and BiVO4. Existing research on Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts mainly utilised powder-type Bi2MoO6 for the photodegradation of organic dyes and pollutants.13–22 Few studies have examined the synthesis of Bi2MoO6 as a thin film-type electrode.10,23,24 For example, Long et al. fabricated pressed Bi2MoO6 thin film electrodes prepared from hydrothermally synthesised Bi2MoO6 powder10 while Zhao et al. developed Bi2MoO6 thin film electrodes by dip-coating an ITO glass substrate in an amorphous heteronuclear complex.23,24 When Bi2MoO6 thin film electrodes are produced using Bi2MoO6 powders, the resultant Bi2MoO6 film electrodes can be unstable owing to poor attachment of the particles to the conductive surface, in turn compromising activity. To date, the direct synthesis of Bi2MoO6 as a thin film-type electrode without needing an intermediate Bi2MoO6 powder has not been reported. Hence, establishing a direct thin film synthesis method to fabricate good quality Bi2MoO6 thin films as photoanodes with (i) a high surface area and (ii) good electrical contact between the oxide and the conducting substrate is highly desirable. A high electrode surface area allows for effective contact between the semiconductor and aqueous electrolyte for the redox reaction while good electrical contact between the oxide and the substrate can facilitate efficient shuttling of photogenerated electrons from Bi2MoO6 to the external circuit.
Orthorhombic-phase molybdenum oxide (α-MoO3) is a wide band gap metal oxide (Eg = 3.2–3.4 eV), with its layered structure invoking ion intercalation capabilities.25,26 Prior work demonstrated the reversible light-charging and discharge properties of MoO3 thin film photoanodes under illuminated and non-illuminated conditions.27,28 Upon charge separation using UV light, MoO3 exhibited in situ storage of photoexcited charge by alkali cation (e.g. Na+) intercalation to form a molybdenum bronze intermediate (NaxMoO3). The stored charge was able to be released on demand, in the dark, for subsequent utilisation. The discharge process was accompanied by de-intercalation of the alkali cations. In addition, the degree of charge storage could be regulated through the modulation of structural distortion and crystal facet engineering of the MoO3 nanostructures.27,28 The intriguing new material properties which could potentially arise upon ion intercalation into the MoO3 crystal structure prompted our interest in the intercalation of larger cationic species, such as Bi3+, whereby the structural transformation would be more permanent. In the current study, we demonstrate the facile fabrication of a Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film electrode using initial electrochemical anodisation of Mo foil followed by hydrothermal treatment of the film in a Bi salt solution. Concomitant to structural transformation, the electronic structure of MoO3 is altered. The Bi 6s orbitals hybridise with the O 2p orbitals of MoO3 to up-shift the valence band, effectively narrowing the optical band gap of MoO3 and extending the absorption of MoO3 into the visible light range. Careful engineering of the MoO3 band gap with Bi3+ cation insertion is shown to both improve light absorption and enhance water oxidation activity.
Experimental section
Thin film synthesis and characterisation
The amorphous MoO3 (A-MoO3) thin film was synthesised using anodisation of a Mo foil (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.99, 0.1 mm thick) in 0.5 wt% NaF (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) aqueous electrolyte at a voltage of 2.5 V for 20 min. Prior to anodisation, the Mo foils were polished using sandpaper to remove any oxide resulted from ambient oxidation. The polished Mo foils were subsequently degreased by sonicating twice in acetone, followed by rinsing with acetone, ethanol and distilled water and then dried in an oven at 110 °C. The anodisation reactor consisted of a two-electrode cell with a platinum foil as the counter electrode and the pretreated Mo foil as the working electrode. The Mo foil was positioned at the base of the anodisation reactor, contacted with a copper spring and pressed against a rubber O-ring to expose an area of 4.15 cm2 to the electrolyte.
To fabricate the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film, the as-anodised A-MoO3 thin film was immersed in 10 mmol of bismuth nitrate solution (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) prepared by mixing solid Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in 70 mL of deionised water. The mixture was initially sonicated for 10 minutes followed by vigorous magnetic stirring for 30 minutes. The pH of the resulting bismuth nitrate solution was adjusted to 9 using aqueous ammonia solution (28 wt%) in order to preserve the Mo foil, which will otherwise dissolve in the strongly acidic Bi(NO3)3·5H2O solution (pH < 1). The as-anodised A-MoO3 thin film and bismuth nitrate precipitate solution was added to a Teflon-lined hydrothermal reactor with the hydrothermal reaction performed for 24 hours at 160 °C. Thermal treatment of the hydrothermally treated A-MoO3 thin film was conducted at a temperature of 450 °C in air for 2 h at a ramping rate of 2.5 °C per min to obtain the crystalline Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film. The crystalline MoO3 (α-MoO3) thin film was obtained by calcining the as-anodised MoO3 thin film at a temperature of 450 °C in air for 2 h at a ramping rate of 2.5 °C per min.
Crystalline structures of the produced thin films were characterised by glancing angle X-ray diffraction using a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) source with a potential of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the thin films were taken using a NanoSEM 230 and NanoSEM 450 operating at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed on a Phillips CM200 facility. X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film was carried out on a Thermo ESCALAB250Xi XPS spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, UK) using monochromated Al Kα X-ray excitation at 150 W power, Ar+ ions of 3 eV, etched area of 2.5 mm × 2.5 mm and a pass energy of 50 eV. These conditions result in an etching rate of 0.42 nm s−1 with respect to Ta2O5. Thin film sample preparation for TEM-EDS analysis was conducted using a Carl Zeiss focused ion-beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). Diffuse reflection ultraviolet and visible (DRUV-vis) spectra of the samples were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 Spectrophotometer. The reflectance of the sample was measured and the corresponding absorbance (F(R)) was calculated using Kubelka–Munk theory.
Photoelectrochemical measurements and water splitting reaction
Chrono-amperometry and cyclic-voltammetry (CV) analyses were performed in a 0.1 M sodium sulphate (Na2SO4, Fluka, ≥99%) electrolyte at room temperature using an Autolab potentiostat (Model PGSTAT302N) in a three-electrode PEC cell with Pt as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and α-MoO3 or Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin films as the working electrode. The electrolyte solution was purged with nitrogen gas for 10 min prior to measurement and the purging was continued for the duration of photocurrent measurements to remove any dissolved oxygen in the cell. Illumination was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp (Perkin Elmer, CERMAX, LC-300BUV). To remove any heating of the electrolyte solution during UV-illumination, a water jacket was placed between the Xe lamp and PEC cell. The illuminated area was 1 cm−2. Wavelength dependent photocurrent measurements of the samples were taken in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution at a voltage of 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl at different wavelengths (λ ≥ 320, 345, 360, 400, 420, 435, 450, and 500 nm) by applying different cut-off filters to a 300 W Xe lamp (Perkin Elmer, CERMAX, LC-300BUV). Illumination was provided for 50 s in each cycle.
PEC water splitting experiments were carried out by applying an external bias of 1.0 V in a two-electrode H-cell with a Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film as the working electrode and Pt as the counter electrode. The size of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 electrode is 4.15 cm−2. Each electrode was placed in a separate compartment with both electrodes immersed in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. Argon gas was utilised as the main carrier gas across the entire system. UV illumination was provided by a 300 W Xe lamp (Perkin Elmer, CERMAX, LC-300BUV). H2 and O2 gas evolution was evaluated using a Shimadzu GC-8A gas chromatograph (molecular sieve 5A column, thermal conductivity detector and Ar carrier gas).
Results and discussion
Crystal structure and morphology

Fig. 1 details the synthesis flowchart and accompanying SEM images of the materials derived from anodisation of the Mo foil and the subsequent hydrothermal process to give the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film. Without anodisation, SEM analysis shows the Mo foil possesses a flat and rough surface with no morphology, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). After anodisation, the XRD pattern indicates the as-anodised MoO3 thin film (A-MoO3) is amorphous, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). SEM images in Fig. 1 show the A-MoO3 thin film exhibits a rough and featureless surface. Calcining the A-MoO3 thin film at 450 °C forms crystalline MoO3 nanoparticles with a plate-shaped morphology.27 The SEM image of the sample after hydrothermal and crystallisation treatment shows two distinct morphological features: (1) a top layer with an extensive coverage of (micron-sized) large islands comprising fused-quasi-spherical nanoparticles and; (2) a compact under-layer consisting of plate-shaped particles. The fused-quasi-spherical nanoparticles possess a narrow size distribution between 20 nm and 50 nm. Fig. 2a shows a high magnification SEM image of an island structure from the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film taken at a 45° tilt. The distinctive layers within the island structure are clearly revealed with the island structure being approximately 1.05 μm thick. The top layer, which is approximately 400 nm thick, comprises the fused-quasi-spherical nanoparticles, while the bottom layer is dominated by plate-shaped particles. XRD patterns of the films with and without the hydrothermal treatment are provided in Fig. 2b. The crystallised MoO3 thin film (no hydrothermal treatment) exhibited diffraction peaks corresponding to orthorhombic-phase α-MoO3 (ICDD-JCPDS no. 05-0508) and moreover, shows an intense (0k0) structural orientation due to the habitual preferential growth of the orthorhombic structure in the [001] direction. Hydrothermal treatment of the anodised film in the Bi3+-containing aqueous solution yields both low temperature phase γ(L)-Bi2MoO6 (ICDD-JCPDS no. 021-0102) and high temperature phase γ(H)-Bi2MoO6 (ICDD-JCPDS no. 082-2067) constituents. The γ(H)-Bi2MoO6 is observed to be the predominant phase as indicated by the strong intensities of the γ(H)-Bi2MoO6 (−341) and (341) diffraction peaks. The XRD and SEM analyses indicate Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin films can be directly fabricated on a conducting Mo metal substrate by intercalating Bi3+ cations into an as-anodised A-MoO3 thin film under appropriate hydrothermal conditions.

The structure of A-MoO3 is widely described as an intermediate form of layered (i) molybdenum trioxide hydrates, MoO3·nH2O (n = 1, 2), and (ii) anhydrous orthorhombic phase α-MoO3.29,30 Corner-sharing MoO5(OH2) octahedra linked by vertices exist in the monohydrate (MoO3·H2O), whereas the layers in α-MoO3 comprise double-layer chains of edge-connected MoO6 octahedra, held together by weak van der Waal's forces. In these structures, the layers are vertically stacked. In the di-hydrates, the interlayer gaps are filled by water molecules but are vacant in the monohydrates and anhydrous α-MoO3. We propose the incorporation of Bi3+ cations into the layered structure of A-MoO3 can proceed in two manners: (i) a physical ion insertion mechanism, where the Bi3+ cations occupy the interstitial positions between the layers of the monohydrate structure and, (ii) a substitution mechanism, which occurs via the substitution of the existing H2O molecules in the interlayer gaps of the di-hydrates by Bi3+ cations. The physical ion insertion method is widely adopted to intercalate small ions into MoO3 nanostructures. For example, Mai et al. reported the synthesis of lithiated MoO3 using physical ion insertion by immersing MoO3 nanobelts in a LiCl solution.31 Using XRD, our earlier work demonstrated the formation of orthorhombic Bi2WO6 from a layered WO3·2H2O thin film was facilitated through the substitution of H2O molecules with (Bi2O2)2+ layers during the hydrothermal process.12
Bi intercalation depth
To establish the diffusion distance of the Bi3+ cations into the MoO3 thin film, TEM EDS line-scan analysis was conducted across a cross-section of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. The cross-sectional TEM sample was prepared by milling a thin slice of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film perpendicular to the surface of the island structures using a focused ion beam/scanning electron (FIB/SEM) microscope. Prior to the milling process, the sample surface was first sputtered with Au for enhanced conductivity and then covered with a sacrificial protective layer of Pt in order to protect it from ion beam damage during milling. The TEM image of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film cross-section can be seen in Fig. 3a. The green arrow shows the localised area where the TEM EDS line-scan profile was taken. The TEM EDS line-scan profile (Fig. 3b) indicates the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film is approximately 1.5 μm thick. Elemental Mo, O and Bi are simultaneously detected from the surface of the film to a depth of 1.1 μm, indicating Bi2MoO6 makes up the top layer of the film and implies the quasi-fused-spherical nanoparticles in the island structures are Bi2MoO6 nanoparticles. At a depth between 1.1 μm and 1.5 μm, the Bi signal is no longer present while the O and Mo signals remain. This indicates a thin layer of pure MoO3 exists below the Bi2MoO6 layer and suggests the large plate-shaped particles observed within the second layer of the island structures and on the under-layer of the film are MoO3 crystals. Beyond a depth of 1.5 μm, only a Mo signal is detected which reflects the location of the Mo substrate. Overall, the TEM EDS line-scan profile reveals the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film comprises a three-layer composition whereby a thin layer of pure-phase MoO3 is sandwiched between an upper Bi2MoO6 layer and the Mo metal foil, which forms the conducting back contact.
 Fig. 3  (a) TEM image of the cross-section of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film; (b) TEM EDS line-scan profile of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film (Au was sputtered on the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film surface prior to FIB/SEM microscopy for enhanced conductivity. A sacrificial layer of Pt was further deposited on the film surface during FIB/SEM microscopy to protect the top surface of the film from ion beam damage during milling) and; (c) Ar-XPS elemental depth profile of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film. 
The thin film profile depicted by the TEM EDS line scan is further supported by an Ar-XPS elemental depth profile analysis as shown in Fig. 3c. The Ar-XPS elemental depth profile provides localised analysis on a larger area of the film compared to the TEM EDS line-scan profile. The Bi concentration is the highest at the surface of the film (region 1) as it receives maximum exposure to the Bi precursor during the hydrothermal process. The Bi concentration gradually decays upon progressing deeper into the film, suggesting Bi2MoO6 formation occurs via the intercalation of Bi3+ cations into the bulk structure of MoO3. Comparing the relative concentrations of O and Bi suggests a mixture of MoO3 and Bi2MoO6 exists in region 1. Single phase MoO3 is observed within region 2, as the concentration of Bi drops to zero atomic percent while the concentration of O remains significantly high. In region 3, the concentration of Mo reaches approximately 100%, indicating the XPS depth profile has reached the Mo substrate. The etching time in the Ar-XPS does not necessarily reflect the actual thickness of the respective components due to the different etching rates of the elements. The TEM EDS line scan profile in Fig. 3b, in this circumstance, provides a more accurate estimation of the thickness of each oxide component in the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 composite thin film.
Optical properties and band structure
The absorbance spectra together with the photocurrent action spectra of the α-MoO3 and Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin films are shown in Fig. 4. The onset absorption of MoO3 is positioned at 365 nm, corresponding to an optical band gap of 3.4 eV as shown in Fig. 4a. The incorporation of Bi into the MoO3 band structure shifts the spectra response of MoO3 from the UV to the visible range as shown in Fig. 4b. The Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film exhibits onset absorption edges at 400 nm and 450 nm due to the presence of the dual bismuth molybdate phases. The band gaps of γ(H)-Bi2MoO6 and γ(L)-Bi2MoO6 are estimated to be 3.1 eV and 2.75 eV from the onset absorption edges, respectively. γ(L)-Bi2MoO6, with a corner-sharing arrangement of MoO6 octahedra, is known to possess an onset absorption edge at the longest wavelength amongst the various bismuth molybdates due to its distorted MoO6 octahedra form whereas γ(H)-Bi2MoO6, with isolated MoO4 tetrahedra structures, possesses a shorter onset wavelength.9 The smaller spectral component at 450 nm (Fig. 4b, inset) within the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 absorption spectrum, indicates a lower amount of γ(L)-Bi2MoO6 is present. The majority of the bismuth molybdate exists as γ(H)-Bi2MoO6, as is reflected by the steep onset absorption at 400 nm. The absorption spectrum is in good agreement with the XRD analysis, showing that γ(H)-Bi2MoO6 is the major phase. The photocurrent action spectra of the α-MoO3 and Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin films closely match their absorption spectra as shown in Fig. 4, confirming that the observed photocurrent arises from the band gap excitation of MoO3 and Bi2MoO6 and not from other parasitic reactions (e.g. photocorrosion). The photocurrent responses of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film to visible light illumination (λ ≥ 450, 435 and 420 nm) are prompt, as shown in Fig. 4b. A chrono-amperometry profile of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film under a 0.1 V potential vs. Ag/AgCl and visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm) is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film exhibited four reproducible photocurrent cycles, showing a magnitude of 94 μA cm−2 under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm), illustrating its visible light activity and stability.

The onset potentials for photocurrent generation by α-MoO3 and Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin films are also shown in Fig. 4. The onset potential is the minimum potential or voltage required for continuous anodic photocurrent to be observed and is illustrated by the interception of the curves under dark and light conditions. For an n-type semiconductor, the onset potential measures the flat band potential of the material. The flatband potential of an n-type semiconductor is also located close to its conduction band potential. Hence, the flatband potential can be used to estimate the location of the conduction band. Both the α-MoO3 and Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin films exhibit a similar onset potential of −0.93 eV vs. Ag/AgCl (pH 7). The band structure of MoO3 is composed of a conduction band formed from Mo 4d orbitals and an O 2p valence band. Upon using density functional theory to determine the Bi2MoO6 band structure, Kudo et al. stated that the conduction band of Bi2MoO6 is composed of Mo 4d and Bi 6p orbitals, whereas the LUMO is dominated by Mo 4d.9 Consequently, the similar onset potentials of Bi2MoO6/MoO3 and MoO3 thin films here can be justified by the similar conduction band orbitals of Bi2MoO6 and MoO3 (i.e. dominated by Mo 4d orbitals). The narrower optical band gap of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film can then be attributed to the formation of a new hybridised valence band comprising Bi 6s and O 2p orbitals, which possess an energy higher than the O 2p valence band orbitals of MoO3.9,10

Fig. 5a and b shows the chrono-amperometry measurements of Bi2MoO6/MoO3 and α-MoO3 thin films under UV illumination at an applied bias of either 0 V or 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl. At 0 V, a comparable anodic photocurrent was observed for both the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 and α-MoO3 thin films. Under an applied bias of 0.1 V however, the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 photoanode exhibited a 52% enhancement in anodic photocurrent compared to that of α-MoO3. Fig. 5c shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profile of both the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 and α-MoO3 thin films. The extent of photocurrent enhancement is exaggerated when higher voltages are applied. At 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the photocurrent of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film (2.75 mA cm−2) is 79% greater than that of the α-MoO3 thin film (1.54 mA cm−2). In general, photocurrent generation by the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film is higher than that of the α-MoO3 thin film as the voltage is swept towards a more positive bias. The enhanced photocurrent response in the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film can be attributed to electrons generated from the Bi2MoO6. The narrower band gap of Bi2MoO6 extends the absorption of light to longer wavelengths resulting in a higher photocurrent response. Note that the dark current observed for both MoO3 and Bi2MoO6/MoO3 was not attributed to the parasitic oxidation of the Mo foil. Instead, it is an intrinsic characteristic of the MoO3 under that voltage range (see ESI and Fig. S4† for additional details).

On the basis of the observed onset potential and optical band gap of the materials, there are two separate electron pathways encountered by the photoexcited electrons and holes in the MoO3 and Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin films. A superior photocurrent performance of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film was observed when a bias was applied. This can be explained by considering the band energy alignment of the binary heterojunction Bi2MoO6/MoO3 photoanode, as illustrated in Fig. 6a. In the neat MoO3 case, photoexcited electrons generated by MoO3 are directly transferred to the collecting substrate (Mo metal) upon photo-excitation. In the case of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film, the presence of a MoO3 layer between Bi2MoO6 and the Mo substrate implies the photoexcited electrons generated in the Bi2MoO6 conduction band have to be injected into the MoO3 conduction band prior to collection at the Mo substrate. Due to the similarity in the conduction band potentials, the migration of electrons across the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 interface is limited at a low bias (0 V). However, the electron mobility across the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 interface becomes greater when a slight bias is applied (e.g. 0.1 V). The improved transport of photogenerated electrons across the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 interface results in a marked improvement in the magnitude of the anodic photocurrent. Therefore, at a higher potential, electrons photogenerated within the Bi2MoO6 are more effectively injected into the MoO3 conduction band and then collected at the Mo substrate.

Applied potential, 1.0 V versus Pt; electrolyte, 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution; light source, 300 W Xe lamp. 
Light-to-current conversion and water oxidation performance
To confirm whether the photocurrent generated by the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film is useful for O2 gas evolution, a PEC water splitting experiment was conducted. H2 and O2 evolution measurements were carried out in a two-electrode system using a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution, where an external bias of 1 V between the Pt counter electrode and the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 photoanode was applied. Although Bi2MoO6 is visible light active, UV illumination was provided to completely activate the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film for electron–hole pair generation.32Fig. 6b shows (i) the photocurrent measured during 8 h of PEC water splitting, (ii) the expected amount of O2 gas, calculated from the measured photocurrent under the assumption of 100% faradaic conversion efficiency (see ESI† for details on calculation), and (iii) the actual amount of O2 gas evolved. The results show close to a 100% faradic photocurrent-to-O2 conversion efficiency was achieved at 7.5 h. In addition, a steady photocurrent of 0.24 mA was maintained throughout the experiment highlighting the stability of the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film for solar water oxidation. The mismatch between the expected and actual O2 gas production at the beginning of the experiment can be attributed to the high solubility of O2 gas in water (1.4 μmol mL−1, 1 atm and 20 °C).33 At 7.5 h, the evolution rates of H2 and O2 gases were 4.1 μmol h−1 and 2.05 μmol h−1, respectively. The rate of H2 and O2 gas evolution matches the 2:1 stoichiometric ratio of H2 and O2 for the water splitting reaction implying all the separated photogenerated electrons and holes were utilised for H2 and O2 gas production.
Conclusions
In summary, we report a new method to prepare a ternary oxide thin film from a simple oxide. The findings demonstrate that a stable composite metal oxide thin film can be produced using this fabrication strategy without the need for preformed particles as the intermediate step. Hydrothermal Bi3+ intercalation provided a tri-layered film comprising a thin layer of pure-phase MoO3 sandwiched between an upper Bi2MoO6 layer and the original Mo metal foil. Introducing the Bi3+ into the MoO3 film shifted the valence band upwards and extended light absorption by the resulting Bi2MoO6/MoO3 film to longer wavelengths. Under an applied voltage, the composite Bi2MoO6/MoO3 film provided a greater photocurrent than the neat MoO3 film due to enhanced electron transport across the Bi2MoO6/MoO3 interface. The Bi2MoO6/MoO3 thin film electrode provided close to 100% faradic photocurrent-to-O2 conversion efficiency for PEC water splitting under UV illumination and, importantly, exhibited excellent photostability as a consequence of the unique synthesis approach. The new technique to directly prepare a ternary oxide as a thin-film-type electrode without the need for preformed particles is a viable approach to assemble various composite thin film electrodes for electrochemical conversion reactions.
