    , Accepted 27th September 2012First published on 27th September 2012AbstractIn order to increase the electron-donating ability of the donor part of the organic dye, two phenothiazine groups, as additional electron donors, were introduced into a triphenylamine unit to form a starburst donor–donor (2D) structure in this paper. Three new organic dyes (WD-6, WD-7 and WD-8) containing this starburst 2D structure and a 2-cyanoacetic acid acceptor linked by various conjugated linkers (benzene, thiophene, and furan) have been designed, synthesized and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The introduction of a phenothiazine group with a butterfly conformation in the triphenylamine donor parts has a good influence on preventing the molecular π–π aggregation due to the starburst 2D structure of the organic dye. The conjugated linker effects on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these organic dyes were investigated in detail. The DSSCs made with these organic dyes displayed remarkable overall conversion efficiencies, ranging from 4.90–6.79% under an AM 1.5 solar condition (100 mW cm−2). The best performance was found for organic dye WD-8, in which a furan group was the conjugated linker. It displayed a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 14.43 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 682 mV, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.69, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 6.79%. The different photovoltaic behaviors of the solar cells based on these organic dyes were further elucidated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), developed by Grätzel and O'Regan, have attracted the considerable attention of many research groups in the past two decades owing to their high efficiency and low cost.1 DSSCs typically contain four components: a mesoporous semiconductor metal oxide film, a dye, an electrolyte/hole transporter, and a counter electrode.2 In these components, the dye is a crucial element, exerting significant influence on the conversion efficiency as well as the stability of the cells.
DSSCs based on ruthenium dyes have shown very impressive solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency. Recently, a new record efficiency (11.4%) of a solar cell based on black dye with donor–acceptor type coadsorbent was obtained.3 However, the large-scale application of ruthenium dyes is limited because of costs and environmental issues. Porphyrin derivatives are the archetypal light collectors of photosynthetic organisms and they are naturally becoming the main focus of the design of new dyes for DSSCs. Indeed, Diau and co-workers have developed very efficient push–pull porphyrin dyes, affording a record efficiency of 10.17% with an I3−/I−-based electrolyte,4 and more recently a 12.3% efficiency for a cobalt electrolyte,5 which are the best performing sensitizers reported so far. However, the synthetic approach of porphyrin dyes is complicated and the yield is low.
For the above reasons, a lot of effort has been dedicated to the development of pure organic dyes which exhibit not only higher molar extinction coefficients, but also simple preparation and purification at lower cost. Coumarin,6 squaraine,7 indoline,8 phenothiazine,9 triphenylamine,10 fluorene,11 carbazole12 and tetrahydroquinoline13 based organic dyes have been developed and show good performance.
Most organic dyes are composed of electron donor, π linker and acceptor moieties and usually have a rod-like configuration. However, the rod-like molecules are elongated, which may facilitate the recombination of electrons with the triiodide and the formation of aggregates between molecules.14 Therefore, organic dyes with a starburst conformation were designed and synthesized by introducing an additional electron donor group into the D–π–A molecule to form the starburst 2D–π–A structure,15 which avoids the charge recombination process of injected electrons with the triiodide in the electrolyte and the formation of aggregates between dye molecules.
Recently, we reported a novel organic dye WD-1 with a starburst 2D–π–A configuration, in which two phenothiazine groups are introduced into a triphenylamine donor as additional electron donors, and 2-cyanoacetic acid is used as an acceptor.16 The solar cell based on WD-1 afforded an overall conversion efficiency of 4.54%, which is higher than that of the corresponding triphenylamine dye. The study suggested that optimizing the triphenylamine donor part by introducing phenothiazine groups as additional electron donors to form a starburst 2D–π–A organic dye is a promising way for preventing unfavorable dye aggregation and increasing the power conversion efficiency.
The linker group between the electron donor and the acceptor in organic dyes plays an important role in terms of optical absorption and charge transfer properties, so this work studies the effect of different linkers on phenothiazine–triphenylamine based starburst 2D–π–A organic dyes. We therefore designed and synthesized three new starburst 2D–π–A organic dyes (WD-6, WD-7 and WD-8) with different conjugated linker groups (Scheme 1). These organic dyes comprise phenothiazine–triphenylamine as a starburst electron donor, 2-cyanoacetic acid as an electron acceptor, and the different aromatic groups as a conjugated linker, i.e., benzene, furan, and thiophene. They were successfully applied in DSSCs. The effects of the different conjugated linkers on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of these organic dyes were investigated in detail.

Experimental
Equipment
NMR spectra were obtained with a Brücker AM 400 spectrometer (relative to TMS). Mass spectra were recorded with a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. The absorption spectra of the dyes in solution and adsorbed on TiO2 films were measured with a SHIMADZU (model UV2450) UV-vis spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammograms of the dyes were obtained with a CH Instruments 660C electrochemical workstation using a normal three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
Materials
Phenothiazine and triphenylamine were purchased from Astatech. 4-Formylphenylboronic acid, 5-formyl-2-thiopheneboronic acid, and 5-formyl-2-furanboronic acid were purchased from J & K Scientific Ltd. Lithium iodide (LiI) was purchased from Acros. 2-Cyanoacetic acid, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) were purchased from Aldrich. 3-Hexyl-1-methylimidazolium iodide (HMII) was prepared according to the literature.17 THF was pre-dried over 4 Å molecular sieves and distilled under an argon atmosphere from sodium benzophenone ketyl immediately prior to use. The starting material, tris(4-iodophenyl)amine, was synthesized according to the corresponding literature method.14 All other solvents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and used as received without further purification.
Preparation of DSSCs
The TiO2 colloid for liquid-state DSSCs was prepared according to the literature.18 The FTO glass substrates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 aq. at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. The 12 μm thick mesoporous nano-TiO2 films, composed of 15–20 nm anatase TiO2 particles, were coated on the FTO glass plates by doctor blade. After drying the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer at 125 °C, a 4 μm thick second layer of 300–500 nm sized light scattering anatase particles (Shanghai Cai Yu Nano Technology Co., Ltd) was deposited using a doctor blade onto the first layer. The TiO2 electrodes were heated at 450 °C for 30 min. After sintering, when the temperature cooled to about 90 °C, the electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing 0.5 mM N3 in ethanol or 0.2 mM WD dyes in acetonitrile and left overnight. The films were then rinsed in ethanol to remove excess dye. Solar cells were assembled, using a 25 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame, with a platinized counter electrode. An electrolyte solution was then introduced through the hole predrilled in the counter electrode, and the cell was sealed with thermoplastic Surlyn covers and a glass coverslip. The liquid electrolyte employed was a solution of 0.3 M HMII, 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP in MPN.
Photovoltaic characterization
The irradiation source for the photocurrent-density–voltage (J–V) measurement is an AM 1.5 solar simulator (91160A, Newport Co., USA). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The tested solar cells were masked to a working area of 0.2 cm2. Volt–current characteristics were performed on a Model 2611 sourcemeter (Keithley Instruments, Inc., USA). A Keithley 2611 sourcemeter and a Model spectrapro 300i monochromator (Acton research, USA) equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp (Aosiyuan Technology & Science Co., Ltd, China) were used for photocurrent action spectrum measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were obtained by using a Solartron 1255B frequency analyzer and a Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface system.

Results and discussion
Absorption properties in solution and on TiO2 films

Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis spectra of the three organic dyes, WD-6, WD-7, and WD-8, measured in acetonitrile solution. The corresponding spectroscopic parameters extracted are summarized in Table 1. Each of these organic dyes exhibited two major absorption bands at 280–360 nm and 360–550 nm. The short wavelength bands were assigned to the localized aromatic π–π* transitions, and the long wavelength ones to intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transitions. The intensity of π–π* transitions is higher than that of the ICT transitions. The absorption maxima (λmax) of WD-6–8 in the long wavelength region were at 385, 406, and 421 nm, respectively. The λmax of WD-7 (thiophene linker) and WD-8 (furan linker) was red-shifted 33 nm and 38 nm compared with that of WD-6 with the benzene linker. This was due to better delocalization of electrons over the whole molecule when thiophene or furan was used as the conjugated linker rather than benzene. The molar extinction coefficients at λmax for WD-6–8 were 21100, 23580, and 22890 M−1 cm−1, respectively. It is known that a wider absorption range is favorable to the performance of DSSCs, as more photons can be harvested. According to the λmax and molar extinction coefficients of these organic dyes, it is clear that WD-7 and WD-8 have a better ability to harvest light than WD-6, which would lead to a higher photocurrent for organic dyes WD-7 and WD-8.

Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of the three dyes on 3 μm thick TiO2 films after 12 h adsorption. Compared to the spectrum in acetonitrile solution, the sharp shift of absorption peaks for WD-6–8 on TiO2 films has not been observed (Table 1). As illustrated with WD-8, the ICT absorption peak is slightly red-shifted by only 2 nm from 421 nm in solution to 423 nm on 3 μm TiO2 film. This may be ascribed to the starburst 2D structure, which prevented the strong tendency for the dyes to aggregate on the TiO2 film, to a large degree. This method for the prevention of aggregation might be better than the usage of the coabsorption of the dyes with deoxycholic acid, which was also able to prevent aggregation and hence improve the photovoltaic performance by means of improving both photocurrent and photovoltage, but unavoidably and significantly decreased dye adsorption and limited the photovoltaic performance. It is confirmed that this is an effective way to lower the tendency to aggregate by introducing phenothiazine groups as additional electron donors into the triphenylamine donor.

Electrochemical properties
To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer between the TiO2/dye/redox electrolyte systems, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in CH2Cl2 solution, using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. 3). The oxidation potential of the organic dyes was determined from the peak potentials by CV, the oxidation potential vs. NHE (Eox) corresponds to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), could be calculated from Eox − E0–0.19 As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4, the HOMO levels are more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that the oxidized dye molecules formed after electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2 could be regenerated by the reducing species in the electrolyte solution. The LUMO levels of the dyes are sufficiently more negative than the CB level of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs. NHE), which implies that electron injection from the excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 is energetically permitted. Therefore, these organic dyes could be used as good sensitizers in DSSCs. The schematic energy levels of the dyes based on absorption and electrochemical data are shown in Fig. 4.

Theoretical calculations
To gain insight into the molecular structures and electron distribution, the geometries of the dyes were optimized by density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level with Gaussian 03.20 As shown in Fig. 5, for the three organic dyes, HOMO-1/HOMO are only localized on a phenothiazine ring, and HOMO-2 is distributed along the triphenylamine and linker system. The LUMO of the three dyes is delocalized across the linker and acceptor system. It may imply that the nonplanar phenothiazine blocked by triphenylamine can make electron distribution of HOMO-1 and HOMO separate from electron distribution of LUMO. The well-overlapped HOMO-2 and LUMO orbitals on the linker unit suggest the well inductive or withdrawing electron tendency from triphenylamine donor unit to the cyanoacetic acid unit. Thus, the HOMO-2 → LUMO excitation induced by light irradiation could move the excited electron distribution from the triphenylamine unit to the cyanoacetic acid unit, and injected into the conduction band of TiO2 through the anchoring group. The electronic transition in the visible band with the largest oscillator strength was found to correspond to the excitation of HOMO-2 to LUMO (the oscillator strengths of HOMO-1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO transitions are almost zero).21

Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs

Fig. 6 shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) data as a function of the wavelength for DSSCs based on the organic dyes WD-6, WD-7 and WD-8.
 Fig. 6  IPCE spectra of DSSCs with the three dyes. 
All three organic dyes could efficiently convert the light to photocurrents in the region from 400 to 650 nm. The IPCE spectra changing tendency of the organic dyes are in accordance with their UV-vis absorption spectra on the TiO2 film. However, the onsets of the IPCE spectra for WD-6, WD-7 and WD-8 are 655, 665 and 675 nm, respectively, which are significantly broadened compared with those of their UV-vis absorption spectra on the TiO2 film. The IPCE values of DSSCs based on WD-7 and WD-8 exceeded 60% from 400 nm to 535 nm (with the highest value of 79.1% at 470 nm) and from 400 to 547 nm (with the highest value of 79.2% at 475 nm), respectively. In the DSSC based on WD-6, the IPCE values relatively exceed 60% from 408 nm to 493 nm (with the highest value of 69.1% at 445 nm). The IPCE of WD-8 is higher and broader than those of WD-6 and WD-7 in the region from 470 nm to 650 nm, indicating that the WD-8 sensitized TiO2 electrode would generate the higher conversion efficiency among the three dyes.
The photocurrent-density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs based on WD-6, WD-7 and WD-8 performed under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 7. The photovoltaic properties of these dye-based DSSCs are summarized in Table 2. The solar cell based on WD-6 shows an efficiency of 4.90%, with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 10.86 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 635 mV, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.71. When we replaced the benzene unit with a thiophene unit to construct WD-7, the performance of the solar cell based on WD-7 improved (η = 6.02%, Jsc = 12.64 mA cm−2, Voc = 680 mV, and ff = 0.70). Afterwards, when we replaced the thiophene unit in WD-7 with a furan unit to construct WD-8, a further increase in performance of the solar cell based on WD-8 was achieved (η = 6.79%, Jsc = 14.43 mA cm−2, Voc = 682 mV, and ff = 0.69). Under the same measurement conditions, the solar cell based on dye N3 generated an efficiency of 8.05% (Jsc = 17.55 mA cm−2, Voc = 685 mV, and ff = 0.67).

According to Fig. 7 and Table 2, it is clear that the photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs can be affected by the different conjugated linkers in the starburst 2D–π–A organic dyes. In comparison with WD-6, the Jsc and Voc values of WD-7 and WD-8 are improved by introducing a thiophene and a furan linker, respectively. WD-7 and WD-8 have the higher Jsc, which might be due to the higher light harvesting efficiency than that of WD-6. Clearly, the DSSCs based on WD-7 and WD-8 possessed higher Voc. The higher Jsc and Voc for the DSSCs of WD-7 and WD-8 lead to the higher efficiencies finally.
In order to further probe the behavior of these organic dyes on the surface of TiO2, the function of co-adsorbents was investigated. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is the most popular co-adsorbent, which binds strongly to the surface of nanostructured TiO2, being able to displace dye molecules from the semiconductor surface and therefore hindering the formation of sensitizer aggregates.22 Thus, the performances of the DSSCs in the presence of CDCA were studied. The results were collected in Table 2, and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 7. It was found that the Jsc of the solar cells based on these dyes and CDCA decreased. CDCA did not improve the corresponding device's performance, however, it decreased the power conversion efficiency. A possible explanation is that the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 surface was reduced by the coadsorption of CDCA, resulting in a loss of active light harvesting, indicating that CDCA was not necessary for these dyes to improve their performance. In addition, the Voc values of the DSSCs in the presence of CDCA were decreased; this is because adsorption of CDCA leaves protons on the TiO2 surface and, hence, charges the surface positively shifted by the coadsorption of CDCA, resulting in Voc loss.23 These results could be considered as a hint that these dyes with a starburst 2D–π–A structure nearly did not aggregate on the TiO2 surface.
To further elucidate the photovoltaic results and obtain more interfacial charge transfer information in DSSCs sensitized by WD-6, WD-7 and WD-8, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed in the dark under a forward bias of −0.65 V.24 The Nyquist and Bode plots for WD-6, WD-7 and WD-8 sensitized cells are shown in Fig. 8a and b, respectively. Nyquist plots have two semicircles and the larger semicircle indicates charge recombination resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. As can be seen from Fig. 8a that the radius of the larger semicircle increases in the order of WD-8 > WD-7 > WD-6, indicating that the charge recombination resistance is increased in the order WD-6 > WD-7 > WD-8. This is to some extent consistent with the order of decreasing Voc: WD-8 (682 mV) > WD-7 (680 mV) > WD-6 (635 mV).
 Fig. 8  EIS spectra of DSSCs based on the three dyes measured at −0.65 V forward bias in the dark: (a) Nyquist and (b) Bode phase plots. 
In the Bode phase plots (Fig. 8b), the lower-frequency peak is indicative of the charge-transfer process of injected electrons in TiO2. The higher Voc of WD-7 and WD-8 can be further explained by electron lifetime, calculated through the relation τe = 1/(2πf) (f is the peak frequency of lower-frequency range in EIS Bode plot). For the three devices, the peak frequency of lower-frequency range decreased in the order of WD-6 > WD-7 > WD-8, and the electron lifetime was enhanced in reverse with the calculated values of 39.91, 56.47, and 63.19 ms, respectively. Thus, WD-8 has the longest electron lifetime, indicative of a more effective suppression of the back reaction between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, resulting in the improvement of the Voc due to reduced charge recombination rate. The combination of the highest Voc and Jsc values (vide supra) affords the best photovoltaic performance of the solar cell based on WD-8.
Conclusion
In this work, two phenothiazine groups as additional electron donors were introduced into a triphenylamine unit to form a starburst 2D structure. A series of efficient organic dyes (WD-6, WD-7 and WD-8) containing this starburst 2D structure and a 2-cyanoacetic acid acceptor linked by different π-conjugated linkers (benzene, thiophene, and furan) have been synthesized, characterized and applied in DSSCs. The phenothiazine group with a butterfly conformation in these organic dyes has an effect on preventing the molecular π–π aggregation. The DSSCs made with these organic dyes displayed remarkable overall conversion efficiency in a range of 4.90–6.79%. The best performance of a solar cell based on WD-8 (furan group as the conjugated linker) was achieved (η = 6.79%, Jsc = 14.43 mA cm−2, Voc = 682 mV, and ff = 0.69). The DSSCs based on WD-7 and WD-8 have higher Voc and Jsc values than those of WD-6 because of their more efficient dark current suppression and light harvesting. According to the EIS analysis, both the resistance for charge recombination and the electron lifetime were increased from WD-6 to WD-7 and WD-8, indicating that the introduction of the furan unit as the linker in starburst phenothiazine–triphenylamine based organic dyes could improve photovoltaic performance compared with the benzene and thiophene units as the linker. Coadsorption of CDCA did not improve the conversion efficiency of the devices based on the three dyes, indicating that these starburst 2D–π–A dyes nearly did not aggregate on the TiO2 surface. The results from this work strongly indicate that the increasing of the twisted non-planar structure in organic dyes is a promising way to improve the performance in DSSCs.
