    , Accepted 26th June 2020First published on 26th June 2020AbstractAqueous sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) have been limited by their poor electrochemical stability. The use of highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes is considered as an efficient strategy that increases the voltage window and improves the cycling stability. However, their cost and safety are still subjects of serious concern for practical applications. In this work, we show that a new multi-component aqueous electrolyte (MCAE) could widen the voltage window to 2.8 V with the formation of a composite solvent sheath and promote the generation of a uniform solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer consisting of complexes with inorganic salt Na2CO3 and other organic components, which significantly inhibits the side reaction. Thus, this MCAE guaranteed good electrochemical stability of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3, which suffer from severe performance degradation in aqueous electrolytes. Simultaneously, this MCAE exhibits high safety, a wide operating temperature range (−50 °C to 50 °C) and high ionic conductivity because of urea and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) additives. In addition, a nickel-based Prussian blue analog (NiHCF)/NaTi2(PO4)3 sodium-ion full battery using such a MCAE delivers 80% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 2C rate. Moreover, our work provides important guidelines to investigate safe, environmentally friendly and high-stability ASIBs for large-scale energy storage.
Introduction
Due to the growing requirements for renewable and sustainable energy such as wind and solar power, great efforts are being made to develop economical, safe and eco-friendly techniques for large-scale energy storage around the world.1,2 Rechargeable aqueous sodium-ion batteries as potential alternatives have recently raised considerable interest for large-scale energy storage owing to their several merits such as low cost, environmental friendliness, and high rate capability, as well as little reliance on battery management systems at module or pack levels.3–7 Unfortunately, the application of rechargeable aqueous sodium-ion batteries is limited by the narrow thermodynamic stability window of water of 1.23 V, so most of the electrode materials applied in organic electrolytes are excluded in aqueous electrolytes.8–10 Moreover, the poor cycling stability of rechargeable aqueous ion batteries, resulting from the side reaction, is an urgent problem.11,12
Recently, highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes have gradually become candidates to achieve a wide electrochemical window and good cycling stability.13–17 A new class of aqueous highly concentrated “Water-in-Salt” electrolyte (WiSE) breaches the voltage window limit, which can be widened to over 2.5 V. Its later upgraded derivatives can support the various systems of battery chemistries.18,19 A WiSE can be obtained by dissolving high concentration organic salts (such as NaCF3SO3) in water, which unprecedentedly decreases the activity of water molecules and accelerates the formation of an anion-containing ion-solvation sheath. Moreover, the excellent electrochemical stability mainly resulted from the electrochemical decomposition of the CF3SO3− anion with high salt concentration to form a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, found to be predominantly inorganic metal fluorides (NaF).18 In addition, the voltage window can be expanded to 2.7 V via using a room-temperature hydrate melt (Na(PTFSI)0.65(TFSI)0.14(OTf)0.21·3H2O), which achieves the construction of a prototype Na3V2(PO4)2F3//NaTi2(PO4)3 aqueous Na-ion full-cell with an average discharge voltage of 1.75 V. Simultaneously, the cycling stability was improved by inhibiting the side reactions such as the dissolution of electrode materials.20 However, a majority of previous studies made use of highly concentrated fluoridated salts, which would cause economic and environmental concerns hindering the practical application of aqueous batteries.21 Subsequently, concentrated NaClO4 solution, in particular with a high molality of 17 mol kg−1 (m), has been tested and found to be able to efficiently widen the electrochemical voltage window to 2.8 V, which allowed many electrode materials to operate steadily.22–24 Unfortunately, highly concentrated NaClO4 solution may increase the explosion risk and raise the possibility of electrolyte precipitation, which hinders its practical use for large-scale energy storage.20
In this work, we designed a MCAE, namely NaClO4–H2O–urea–DMF (Na–H2O–urea–DMF) with non-flammability, low cost, wide operating temperature range and non-toxicity characteristics, which contributed to resolving issues such as performance, cost, environmental friendliness, and safety. The electrochemical stability window of the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte is extended up to 2.8 V due to the formation of a composite solvent sheath and the generation of a uniform interfacial SEI layer consisting of complexes with inorganic salt Na2CO3 and other organic components, inhibiting side reactions (such as water decomposition and dissolution of the electrode material). A Na3V2(PO4)3/NaTi2(PO4)3 (NVP/NTP) full cell exhibits high electrochemical stability and a nickel based Prussian blue analog (NiHCF)/NaTi2(PO4)3 sodium-ion full battery delivers 80% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 2C rate. The use of this low-cost aqueous electrolyte provides a new afflatus for increasing the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes and improving the cycling performance of safe and stable sodium ion batteries.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the MCAE
To construct safe and stable aqueous sodium ion batteries, we designed a MCAE that contains sodium perchlorate solute, urea and DMF additives, and water solvents. As is well-known, DMF and urea are inexpensive and environmentally friendly, and are superior to the other organic solvents and additives for electrolytes of batteries.25–27 In detail, the urea additive, one of the simplest organic compounds, can be used as a cosolvent because of its high solubility in water,28 and it can participate in the solvation structure attributed to ion–solvent interactions as reported in our previous work.29 In addition, DMF is a common polar protophobic solvent with a high dielectric constant, strong solvation ability, low vapor pressure, and high boiling point, and can be used as a good additive for electrolyte solutions of batteries.30 Furthermore, it is also found that NaClO4 salt has quite high solubility in water (17 m at 25 °C, m = mol-salt in kg-solvent).31 Therefore, we mixed the four components to prepare a clear multicomponent aqueous electrolyte (MCAE) solution.
As shown in Fig. 1a, this MCAE electrolyte expands the voltage window up to 2.8 V, far exceeding the thermodynamic stability window of water of 1.23 V and approaching the voltage window of WiSEs. When the molar ratio of Na+ to H2O is up to 1:6, almost all water molecules form a complex solvation sheath surrounding Na+.32 In particular, in 17 M NaClO4 solution, ClO4− seems to participate in the hydrogen bond network of H2O and to restrict the degree of fluctuation inherent in liquid H2O.33,34 In the MCAE, the main probable factors of ion solvation and ion association effects lock the “free” water, resulting in an unprecedented molar ratio of Na+ to H2O up to 1:2, enabling the enlargement of the voltage window. What is more, no redox peaks between 1.4 V and −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl are observed, implying that the components of the MCAE are electrochemically stable in this voltage window. At the same time, the redox potentials of the NVP/C and NTP/C are limited in the voltage window, which confirms the absence of side reactions and good cycling stability. The temperature-dependent conductivity of the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte is shown in Fig. 1b. The ionic conductivity of the hybrid Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte reaches 8.1 mS cm−1 at 20 °C and increases to 13.85 mS cm−1 at 50 °C, comparable to that of “water-in-salt” electrolytes (10.0 mS cm−1) used in high-voltage aqueous Li-ion batteries.13 In addition, the ionic conductivity of Na–H2O–urea solution without the DMF component is 1.259 mS cm−1 at 25 °C, which indicates that the addition of DMF increases the ionic conductivity and promotes the transport of Na+ in the electrolyte. To probe the coordination environment of Na+ in the electrolytes, 23Na NMR spectroscopy of aqueous electrolytes was performed, as shown in Fig. 1c. In contrast to superconcentrated NaClO4 solution, urea and DMF can weaken ion shielding, resulting in a lowfield shift, thereby reducing the viscosity of the system and improving the ionic conductivity of Na+. In the meantime, an upfield shift in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte relative to dilute NaClO4 solution was observed, indicating the probability of occurrence of urea molecules in the Na+ solvent sheath and strong hydrogen bond interactions of DMF. Compared to the Na–H2O–urea electrolyte, the hydrogen evolution potential of the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte is −1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl as shown in Fig. S1.† Therefore, with the addition of DMF, decrease of water molecules and stronger hydrogen bond interactions occur, limiting the side reaction of water electrolysis and greatly increasing the hydrogen evolution overpotential.

(d) Differential scanning thermograms of Na–H2O, Na–H2O–urea, Na–H2O–DMF and Na–H2O–urea–DMF. 
However, the addition of DMF may greatly increase the safety risk of the electrolyte. Subsequently, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and analysis of the combustion characteristics of the MCAE were performed, which show that the urea additive can effectively improve the stability and safety relative to the DMF additive. Fig. 1d and S2† show the differential scanning thermograms of Na–H2O, Na–H2O–urea, Na–H2O–DMF, and Na–H2O–urea–DMF aqueous solutions and the DSC curves for electrolytes previously cooled down to −50 °C and then heated up to 50 °C at a scanning rate of 1 °C min−1. The states of different electrolytes at 50 °C, 25 °C and −40 °C are shown in Fig. S3.† The DSC curves of highly concentrated NaClO4 solution exhibit two endothermic peaks, related to the peritectic reaction and crystallization, corresponding to a temperature of −13.7 °C and −33.9 °C, respectively.35 Alternatively, the DSC results of Na–H2O–DMF solution show a melting point of 17.9 °C and a crystallization peak at −28.2 °C. However, interesting and somewhat puzzling is the absence of an endothermic peak in the DSC heating curve of Na–H2O–urea and Na–H2O–urea–DMF solutions in the temperature range of −50 °C to 50 °C. It is speculated that the urea promotes the formation of a complex solvent sheath and destroys the conventional structure of Na (H2O)6+ in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte. Namely, water molecules are more likely to participate in forming stronger bonds with other components rather than appearing as a separate phase.25 This result indicates that a wide operating temperature of the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte enables its potential application in a low temperature environment. The inflammability of Na–H2O–DMF and Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolytes was also measured (Fig. S4†). The results confirm that the urea additive is beneficial to the non-inflammability of the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte. Therefore, the urea additive can reduce the content of free water to form the complex solvent sheath, and also improves the temperature tolerance and safety of the MCAE.
To characterize the electrolyte state and reveal the formation of a composite solvent sheath, Raman spectra of different electrolytes (Fig. S5†) and 1H NMR spectra of the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte were measured. Fig. 2a–c show the ClO, C–N and OH–H stretching vibration modes of various solutions, respectively. They indicate that the ClO4 stretching of solutions with the addition of urea and DMF undergoes a slight red shift compared to highly concentrated NaClO4 solution, suggesting a remarkable change in the cation–anion coordination environment and aggregation of ClO4−. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, for the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte, the peak downshifts from 939.6 cm−1 to 935.8 cm−1 relative to Na–H2O solution, which suggests that the coordination interaction of Na+–ClO4− and aggregation of ClO4− are decreased, thereby improving safety. In a previous study, it was reported that the peak of N–C–N stretching of urea is located at 1013 cm−1.36 However, as shown in Fig. 2b, this peak redshifts to 1001 cm−1 in Na–H2O–urea due to the coordination of sodium ions with oxygen atoms in urea, demonstrating the formation of coordination of Na+–urea. When DMF is added, the peak of N–C–N stretching of urea is unchanged. In addition, the C–N–C stretching peak of DMF37 at 1092.8 cm−1 upshifts to 1109 cm−1 in Na–H2O–DMF and Na–H2O–urea–DMF solutions, which illustrates strong ion association effects or hydrogen-bond interactions. The absence of DMF in the Na+ composite solvent sheath is obvious from the blue-shift of the C–N stretching of DMF. As shown in Fig. 2c, Raman spectroscopy was conducted to further characterize the OH–H stretching vibration modes in different aqueous electrolytes. In pure water, water molecules and their clusters with different hydrogen-bonding environments lead to a broad Raman band including several components of the OH–H stretching vibration.38 For the Na–H2O electrolyte with extreme NaClO4 concentrations and Na–H2O–DMF solution, a new peak appears with simultaneous disappearance of the broad band, indicating the diminishing population of water molecules. With the addition of urea, an H–N–H vibration peak appears and the broad Raman band completely disappears, which reveals that free water is drastically bound and the cluster structure is destroyed. Furthermore, DMF contributes to the reduction of the reactivity of water. In Fig. 2d and S6,† the shift of OH–H stretching vibration and H–N–H vibration peaks can be observed, which indicates the disappearance of “free water” and formation of strong hydrogen bonding. In this system, the state and chemical environment of water are significantly altered compared with traditional dilute salt solutions.

(f) The stable conformation of the Na complex in aqueous electrolyte at the M08-HX/6-31G*/SMD level. The blue word represents the component in the complex, and the black number represents the Na–O bond length, units: Å. 
Additional evidence comes from the 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of Na–H2O–urea–DMF solution. For pure water, a peak of chemical shift appears at 1.56 ppm in CDCl3 solvent.39 However, as shown in Fig. 2e, this signal of water significantly shifts to a lower frequency at 1.64 ppm for the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte with CDCl3 solvent, which suggests that the water in the electrolyte no longer exists in the form of free water due to the complex solvation structure constituted by the ion–solvent interaction and strong hydrogen bonding, consistent with the results of Raman spectra.
To better understand this complex solvation structure, we explored the possible model of a sodium complex according to the molar ratio of the aqueous electrolyte (Na+:ClO4−: urea:H2O = 1:1:2:2) used in the experiment. Notably, as DMF is used only to reduce the viscosity and increase the conductivity of the aqueous electrolyte, we did not take DMF into consideration in our model. The model ends up with a 6-fold Na coordination after optimization, and Na+ is observed to interact with the other three components. The stable conformation contains two Na–O@urea bonds, two Na–O@H2O bonds and two Na–O@ClO4− bonds, respectively, and the bond lengths are shown in Fig. 2f. In addition, five hydrogen bonds are observed and the bond lengths are listed in Table S1.† The DFT results suggest that all water molecules are trapped in the complex, which, in other words, indicates that there is no free water molecule in the aqueous electrolyte.
Electrochemical performance in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte
Typical NASICON compounds (such as a NVP cathode and a NTP anode) suffering from severe performance degradation in aqueous electrolytes were employed.40–44 The crystal structures, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and SEM images of the prepared NVP/C and NTP/C are shown in Fig. S7.† In Fig. S8,† all of the materials have two featured Raman shifts, in which the G-band (ordered graphitic structure) peak is at 1590 cm−1 and the D-band (disordered portion) is at 1352 cm−1. The thin carbon layer provides good electro-conductivity to NVP/C and NTP/C. In addition, the carbon content of the NVP/C and NTP/C composites measured by elemental analysis (Table S2†) and TG analysis (Fig. S9†) is approximately 3.5 wt%.

Fig. 3 shows the electrochemical performances of a half-cell in a three-electrode system and a NVP//NTP full cell. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the NVP half-cell exhibits a pair of redox peaks with good symmetry at 0.68 V and 0.42 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which can be ascribed to the reversible conversion of the V3+/V4+ couple, corresponding to the reversible extraction/insertion of Na+ in the NVP electrode. The half-cell delivers a specific charge and discharge capacity of 110 mA h g−1 and 96 mA h g−1 in the first cycle, and exhibits good reversibility for the first time. The irreversible charge capacity mainly resulted from the dissolution of the V-ions until the appearance of O2 evolution which was recorded in CV curves. For NTP, a pair of Ti4+/Ti3+ redox peaks at −0.55 V and −0.82 V vs. Ag/AgCl can be found in the CV curves. As seen in Fig. 3c, the CV curves show that the hydrogen evolution reaction still does not occur when the potential is −1.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which suggests that the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte can inhibit the side reaction well. As shown in Fig. 3d, the NTP in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte delivers a pristine discharge capacity of 118 mA h g−1, concurrently exhibiting a perfect platform and good reversibility, which is better than that of a NTP anode with cationic doping.45–47 As shown in Fig. S10 and S11,† the NTP anode exhibits an impressive cycling stability in a conventional non-aqueous electrolyte. However, the coulombic efficiency and cycling performance of the NVP cathode at 2C in a conventional non-aqueous electrolyte are poor due to the dissolution of V-ions and change of structure.

(b and d) The charge–discharge profiles of aqueous NVP (b) and NTP (d) half-cells. (e) CV curves of the NVP/NTP full battery. (f) The charge–discharge profiles at different rates. (g) Rate capability and (h) cycling stability of a full battery. 
The sodium transport kinetics of the prepared electrodes were investigated using the CV curves at different scan rates and the linear relationship between the peak current and the square root of the scan rate (Fig. S12†). The average sodium diffusion coefficient (DNa+) is calculated based on the classical Randles–Sevcik equation48,49 and the slopes of the fitting lines of Ipvs. v1/2. The calculated values of DNa+ of NVP/C and NTP/C are 2.32 × 10−9 and 2.40 × 10−10 cm2 s−1, respectively, which are higher than those of organic electrolytes. These high DNa+ values suggest that the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte would be attractive for quick charge and discharge devices.
A NVP/NTP full sodium-ion cell was assembled based on the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte with the mass ratio of NTP:NVP = 1:1.1 to investigate their performances. In Fig. 3e, the cyclic voltammogram of the full cell at 0.1 mV s−1 exhibits redox peaks at 1.37 and 1.14 V with a dropout voltage of 0.23 V, which suggests that the electrochemical polarization is small, resulting from the excellent electrode kinetics. During the second scan, the CV curves almost coincide with the first scan, and at the same time, no increased polarization is observed, indicating good reversibility of the NVP/NTP full cell. Compared to the previous reported work on aqueous electrolytes, the current of the side reaction does not increase in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte when the charge voltage is up to 2.0 V.40,50 In Fig. 3f, the voltage platforms of galvanostatic charge–discharge curves at different C-rates are in agreement with those of CV curves. At 0.2C, the full cell can deliver charge and discharge capacities of 104 mA h g−1 and 80 mA h g−1 (based on the weight of the cathode active material) with a potential plateau at 1.23 V, corresponding to an energy density of 61 W h kg−1 (based on the total electrode mass). The reversible capacity of the full cell drops from 80 to 52 mA h g−1 with the current density increasing from 0.2 to 5C rate, and the coulombic efficiency approaches 100%. The initially irreversible processes visibly diminish, which may be related to SEI formation corresponding to the first charge curve at 0.2C rate. Fig. 3g illustrates the rate cyclability of the full cell from 1 to 20C rates. The specific discharge capacity is around 67 mA h g−1 at a rate of 1C, and the capacity retention is 60, 52 and 45 mA h g−1 when the current density is increased to 2, 5 and 10C, respectively. It's remarkable that even at the high 20C rate, the full cell still delivers a reversible capacity of 35 mA h g−1, exhibiting good rate capability and cycling stability.
The as-assembled NVP/NTP full cell was activated at 0.2C rate, and then was measured at 10C rate, showing good cycling performance (Fig. 3h). The initial capacity at 10C rate was 68 mA h g−1 and the full cell still delivers 86% capacity retention after 100 cycles, which greatly exceeds the previous performance of a NVP/NTP full cell in aqueous electrolyte (Table S4†). Moreover, the coulombic efficiency of the full cell was always close to 100% during cycling. In addition, the cycling performances of the NVP//NTP full cell in different electrolytes were measured to demonstrate the good cycling performance in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte (Fig. S13†). The electrochemical performances of the full cell in Na–H2O–urea–DMF and Na–H2O–DMF are better than that in Na–H2O–urea solution, which further indicates that the DMF additive can increase ionic conductivity and reduce water activity. Such a good cycling performance confirmed that the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte can suppress the dissolution of the NVP electrode and the decomposition of the electrolyte.
Mechanism of electrochemical stability in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte
The phase changes of NVP/C were detected using ex situ XRD patterns that were collected during the charge/discharge cycles under a current rate of 0.2C in the voltage range of 0.6–1.6 V. As shown in Fig. 4a, all peaks can be indexed to the NVP phase before charging. Then, during continuous charging, all peaks shift to a high angle and the intensity of the peaks decreases due to the extraction of Na+ from NVP, accompanied by the gradual formation of a new NaV2(PO4)3 phase.51 Subsequently, the characteristic peaks of NVP gradually recover and the peak intensity gradually increases during discharging, which illustrates the structural stability and high reversibility of the NVP/C electrode in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte.

(b) Vanadium ion concentration in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte of the NVP//NTP full cell before cycling, after 50 cycles and after 100 cycles. (c) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of the NVP//NTP full cell at the OCV, after the first cycle and after 100 cycles. (d) The cycling performance of the NiHCF//NTP full cell. 
To better understand the good cycling stability of the full cell in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte, inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis of the vanadium concentration in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte and analysis of electrochemical impedance parameters were carried out before and after cycling. As shown in Fig. 4b and Table S3,† it is found that the concentration of V-ions in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte before cycling is 0.05 μg mL−1. After 50 cycles and after 100 cycles, the concentrations of V-ions in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte are 16.65 μg mL−1 and 20.12 μg mL−1, respectively. In 1 M Na2SO4 solution, the concentrations of V-ions are 0.08 μg mL−1, 60.68 μg mL−1 and 72.34 μg mL−1, respectively. Compared to 1 M Na2SO4 solution, the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte can obviously inhibit the dissolution of the electrode materials. Upon comparison of the V-ion concentrations in NaClO4 solution, Na–H2O–DMF, and Na–H2O–urea electrolyte of the NVP//NTP full cell after 50 cycles (Fig. S14†), it is found that the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte can suppress the dissolution of V-ions in the charge–discharge process. This result is consistent with the cycling performances of the NVP//NTP full cell in different electrolytes (Fig. S13†). Thus, it can be concluded that the NVP/C cathode is much more stable in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte, which is beneficial for the long lifespan of the full cell. Similarly, as illustrated in Fig. S15,† the NTP anode in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte displays high coulombic efficiency and good cycling stability relative to that in 17 M NaClO4 and 1 M Na2SO4 solution.

Fig. 4c shows the electrochemical impendence spectra of the full cell in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte before cycling, after the first cycle and after 100 cycles. The Rs value of the battery in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte, connected to the intercept on the real impedance axis at a high frequency in the EIS spectra, is relatively small and equal for the pristine state and after cycling, which suggests good ion diffusion in the electrolyte and good stability of the electrode materials before and after cycling. The Rct value represented the charge transfer resistance increase after the first cycle and after 100 cycles, indicating that a passivation layer may be formed on the NTP anode, which could be a significant factor in the improvement of the cycling performance of the NVP/NTP full cell. Moreover, the XRD patterns (Fig. S16†) and SEM images (Fig. S17†) of NVP/C and NTP/C before and after 500 cycles were recorded, respectively. The results indicate that the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte is conducive to achieving excellent stability of the NVP cathode. In addition, a NiHCF//NTP full cell displays 80% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 2C rate (Fig. 4d).
As demonstrated in previous work on a LiTi2(PO4)3 anode, the discharged NTP anode would also react with water and dissolved oxygen in aqueous electrolyte.3,52–54 Therefore, the passivation layer as a critical component plays a significant role in maintaining the structural stability of a NTP anode. In our previous work, we demonstrated the formation of a passivation layer on a Mo6S8 anode in aqueous electrolyte with a urea additive.29 To explore the surface passivation layer of the NTP anode, various characterization techniques were employed to examine the surface of the NTP anode after 30 cycles in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte. As shown in Fig. S18,† the TEM image shows a thin and amorphous layer on the NTP surface, indicating the formation of a surface passivation layer, which is similar to the SEI layer on the NTP surface reported in previous work. The SEM image and distribution of Na, C, O and N further confirm the presence of an amorphous SEI layer and its chemical homogeneity.
The chemical composition of interphases on NTP electrodes was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 5a and b show the C 1s peaks of the NTP electrodes before and after 30 cycles in the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte. The four C 1s peaks shown in Fig. 5a include C–C species (284.8 eV)55 from the conductive agent, and C–H (285.6 eV),56 CF2 (291.1 eV)57 and CO (287.2 eV) species arose from binder PVDF. After cycling, new peaks of H–C–N (288.5 eV) and CO (289.5 eV)58 species appear, which can be attributed to the organic component generated from DMF and the chemical component of Na2CO3. Fig. 5c shows the two O 1s peaks of the pristine NTP electrode, including P–O (531.8 eV)17 belonging to NTP and O–H (533.5 eV)59 species from the O in P–O–H. As shown in Fig. 5d the two O 1s peaks represent the Na2CO3 (531.5 eV)17 species and organic CO (533.8 eV) components, respectively. These results demonstrated the formation of an interfacial SEI layer consisting of complexes with inorganic salt Na2CO3 and other organic components. In addition, to the best of our knowledge and literature review, ClO4− reduction in NaClO4− based electrolytes appears highly improbable within this voltage window, as it requires high decomposition energy. As characterized thus far, the formation of the SEI layer can be summarized based on the electrochemical reaction of the composite solvent sheath of the Na–H2O–urea–DMF electrolyte on the surface of the NTP anode. This SEI layer insulates the water molecules that reacted with the discharged NTP anode, improving the cycling stability of the full cell. According to the results of the characterization, the formation mechanism of the SEI layer may be shown as follows: CO(NH2)2 + 2Na+ + 2e− + 2H2O → Na2CO3 + 2NH3 + H2. More details of this mechanism need to be further investigated through more characterization methods.

Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated the use of a multicomponent electrolyte containing sodium perchlorate, urea, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and water, enabling us to immensely decrease the amount of water, forming a complex solvent sheath and a uniform SEI layer composed of complexes with inorganic salt Na2CO3 and other organic components between the interface of the NTP anode and electrolyte. Such an electrolyte provides a voltage window up to 2.8 V and ensures the feasibility of stable and reversible operation of a NVP/NTP sodium ion battery. This battery exhibits an excellent flat voltage platform of about 1.2 V and achieves 86% capacity retention after 100 cycles at the 10C rate. Simultaneously, a NiHCF//NTP full cell with the MCAE displays 80% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 2C rate. In addition, this MCAE displays high safety, a wide operating temperature range (−50 °C to 50 °C) and high ionic conductivity because of the roles of urea and DMF additives. And above all, the fluorine-free MCAE makes the battery much safer and more environmentally friendly than the existing battery systems with highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes. Meanwhile, we provide a new perspective that can be expanded to other systems of aqueous sodium-ion full cells, which promotes the application of safe, environmentally friendly and stable AISBs for large-scale energy storage.
