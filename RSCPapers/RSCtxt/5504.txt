    , Accepted 21st December 2014First published on 23rd December 2014AbstractIn this paper, we have studied Fe-doping of nanostructured tungsten trioxide (WO3) and its pronounced effect in promoting the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. Vertically aligned Fe-doped WO3 nanoflakes on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) were synthesized via the hydrothermal method. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the Fe3+ substitution at the W6+ site in the prepared films. Broadened visible light absorption was observed in doped films, likely due to the formation of extra band states through doping. The Fe-doping was shown to greatly improve the PEC water splitting performance of WO3. More specifically, the 2 mol% Fe-doped WO3 achieved a photocurrent density of 0.88 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE, approximately 30% higher than that of the undoped WO3 (0.69 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE). This enhancement was attributed to the reduced band gap and the doping-enhanced charge carrier density as confirmed by the absorption spectra and the Mott–Schottky plots, respectively. Finally, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that the formation of oxygen vacancies was favored after Fe-doping, contributing to the increased charge carrier density in slightly doped films.
Introduction
Since its discovery by Honda and Fujishima in 1972,1 photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been intensively studied as a unique and effective approach for generating renewable energy from sunlight.2,3 Monoclinic tungsten trioxide (WO3) was recognized as one of the “ideal” materials for solar-driven water splitting because of its photosensitivity,4,5 good electron transport property,6 and photostability against acid corrosion.7,8 Briefly, WO3 has a moderate hole diffusion length (∼150 nm) compared with α-Fe2O3 (2–4 nm) and TiO2 (∼100 nm), which guaranteed an effective charge separation.9 Besides, the deep valence band maximum (VBM) of WO3 is favored for oxygen production.10 Thirdly, WO3 also possesses good chemical stability in an acidic environment (pH < 4) under solar illumination.11 However, one of the drawbacks of WO3 in PEC applications lies in its relatively high band gap (Eg) (∼2.7 eV) and thus the inefficient utilization of the solar energy, resulting in an inferior solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency.12 Besides, the short excited-state lifetime13 and slow oxygen evolution reaction kinetics14 of WO3 also contribute to its inferior PEC performance. Therefore, significant effort should be made to overcome these obstacles.
There are a number of approaches for improving the STH conversion efficiency of semiconductor materials, such as nanostructure engineering,9,11,15–19 surface modification,20–24 selective doping25–29etc. The latter approach is especially effective in modifying the electronic and optical properties of semiconductor materials to enhance their PEC performance. Generally, doping can improve the STH conversion efficiency of semiconductor materials in the following three ways: (i) Eg reduction of semiconductors, resulting in an enhanced light harvesting ability; (ii) modulation of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the VBM, which are associated with their reducing and oxidizing abilities; (iii) the increase of charge carrier density of the semiconductor materials.30 Not surprisingly, numerous research studies have been carried out to improve the PEC performance of WO3 through selective doping.27–29,31,32 For example, thermally stable N2-intercalated WO3 has been synthesized by Mi et al.,27 who found that the incorporation of molecular N2 into the lattice of WO3 significantly reduced its absorption threshold. S doping was also reported, and the resulting S-doped WO3 films were found to improve the PEC performance due to the improved charge collection efficiency.29 Despite the variegated studies on nonmetal doped WO3, metal doped WO3 for PEC applications has seldom, if not never, been reported. Theoretically, Huda and Wang have discussed the possibility of tailoring the band structure of WO3 through metal doping.33,34 On the other hand, metal doped TiO235–37 and Fe2O338–41 have been fabricated and they showed improved PEC performance compared with their predecessors. Therefore, we envisage that metal doping might be an effective approach for improving the PEC performance of WO3.
In the present study, Fe3+ has been selected for doping a specially prepared WO3 nanostructure since, firstly, hematite (α-Fe2O3) itself is another favorite semiconductor material for solar-driven water splitting.42,43 Secondly, Fe-doped TiO2 nanostructures have shown improved photocatalytic activities compared with undoped TiO2.44–46 Lastly, the ionic radius of Fe3+ (0.64 Å) is very close to that of W6+ (0.62 Å), ensuring a largely diminished doping-induced strain arising from lattice mismatch. Besides, although researchers often attribute the improved PEC performance of metal-doped semiconductor materials35–41 to the increased charge carrier density arising from metal-doping, the underlying mechanism is still elusive. Here, by means of the hydrothermal method, we have firstly synthesized Fe-doped WO3 nanoflakes. Significantly enhanced visible light absorption, charge carrier density and PEC performance have been observed in the prepared Fe-doped WO3 nanostructured films. Besides, to rationalize our experimental results, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are employed to investigate the morphological transformation and electronic structural modification of the WO3 nanostructures generated by Fe-doping.
Experimental section
Synthesis
The vertically aligned WO3 nanoflakes on the FTO substrate were grown by the literature based hydrothermal method.15,16 Generally, before the hydrothermal growth, the FTO substrates have been coated with a thin layer of seed by spin coating. The seed solution was prepared by dissolving 1.25 g H2WO4 powder and 0.5 g of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) into 10 mL 50% H2O2. After spin coating, the FTO glasses were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h in air. An H2WO4 solution used for the hydrothermal reaction was prepared by dissolving 1.25 g H2WO4 in 30 mL deionized water and 10 mL 50 wt% H2O2 at 95 °C under stirring. The resulting clear solution was diluted to 100 mL using deionized water and the molar concentration of the solution was 0.05 mol L−1. 3 mL H2WO4 solution (0.05 mol L−1) and 0.3 g oxalic acid dehydrate were added into a 22 mL Teflon-lined autoclave containing 10 mL acetonitrile and 2.5 mL deionized water. The pH value of the solution was adjusted to 0.6 by adding HCl (6 mol L−1) to the solution with stirring. The Fe-doped WO3 nanoflakes were prepared using a similar method to the undoped WO3 with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% (by mole percent) FeCl3 added to the precursor solution. After 4 h of reaction at 180 °C, the as-prepared films were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and annealed in air at 500 °C for 1 h.
Characterization
The morphologies of the as-prepared undoped and Fe-doped WO3 were directly examined using a JEOL 6700F scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out using a JEOL 6300 SEM. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a Philips PW-1830 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at a scanning speed of 4° min−1 under operation conditions of 30 kV and 40 mA. The XPS spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer model PHI 5600 XPS system using a monochromated aluminium anode X-ray source with Mo Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer UV–vis spectrophotometer (model Lambda 20). BaSO4 was taken as the reference. The light source (Oriel solar simulator, 450 W Xe lamp, AM 1.5 global filter) was calibrated to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using an optical power meter (Newport, model 1916-C) equipped with a Newport 818P thermopile detector. PEC measurements were recorded on an IM6x electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & Co., KG, Germany) in a standard three-electrode cell configuration using 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4, if not stated otherwise, as the electrolyte. The as-prepared WO3 and Fe-doped WO3 were used as the working electrode while the platinum foil and Ag/AgCl were employed as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All potentials reported here were measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential using the Nernst equation:47 ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.1976 V(1)
The incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded at a potential of 1.23 V versus RHE using an IPCE kit developed by ZAHNER-Elektrik. Mott–Schottky plots were acquired using a CHI 660A electrochemical analyzer in a three-electrode system.
Computational details
The spin-unrestricted DFT computations were carried out using the DMol3 code48 embedded in the Materials Studio software. Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) was used to describe the exchange–correlation interaction in this study. The double numerical plus polarization (DNP) was applied in the expanded electronic wave function. In addition, the self-consistent field (SCF) calculations were performed with a convergence criterion of 10−6 au on the total energy. To ensure high-quality results, Monkhorst–Pack special k-points of 6 × 6 × 6 meshes were used to represent the Brillouin zone in all calculations. A k point of 10 × 10 × 10 was used to calculate the band structure.
Results and discussion
Crystalline phase and morphology

Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the prepared films. The reflection peaks of the as-prepared undoped WO3 films completely fitted with a WO3 monoclinic structure (PDF 01-083-0950: a = 7.30 Å, b = 7.54 Å, c = 7.69 Å, β = 90.9°). Generally, for doped films, no additional peak was observed (Fig. S1†). This indicated that the incorporation of Fe3+ did not result in a secondary phase formation. Besides, the peaks for monoclinic WO3 remain sharp and clear in 2% Fe-doped films. This is mainly attributed to the low concentration of the dopant and the fairly close ionic radius of Fe3+ and W6+. However, as the dopant concentration increases to 5%, a slight peak broadening can be distinguished (inset of Fig. 1), indicating the poorer crystallization degree. Apparently, this peak broadening was caused by the slight lattice mismatch associated with doping as previously discussed by other researchers.49,50

The morphologies of the prepared WO3 and Fe-doped WO3 thin films after annealing are presented in Fig. 2. The top-view SEM images suggest that the synthesized undoped WO3 films are composed of dense and vertically aligned WO3 nanoflake arrays; the thickness of each nanoflake is approximately 20 nm (inset of Fig. 2(a)). According to the cross-section SEM images, the thickness of the prepared nanostructured WO3 films on the FTO substrate is approximately 3 μm (inset of Fig. 2(b) and S2†). Compared with the undoped WO3, the synthesized Fe-doped WO3 films also consist of uniform nanoflake arrays, which indicates that the morphologies of the nanostructured WO3 have not been apparently changed after doping. Besides, EDS analysis based Fe-mapping confirmed the uniform distribution of the Fe dopant in the as-prepared Fe-doped WO3 films (Fig. S3†).

To understand the influence of Fe-doping on the growth of WO3 nanoflakes, time-dependent hydrothermal experiments have been carried out. Fig. S4 and S5† present the SEM images of the undoped (Fig. S4†) and 5% Fe-doped (Fig. S5†) WO3 nanoflakes grown on the FTO substrate at 180 °C for 1, 2, 4, and 6 h. Generally, for undoped WO3, the FTO substrate remained transparent, and no WO3 nanoflakes were observed when the reaction time was less than 1 h. When the growth time was increased to 2 h, WO3 nanoflakes began to deposit on the substrate. At this stage, the substrate was covered by sparse WO3 nanoflakes. However, large areas of the FTO substrate remained uncovered as can be seen from Fig. S4(b).† Only after extending the hydrothermal reaction time to 4 h was the FTO substrate fully covered by WO3 nanoflakes (Fig. S4(c)†). Comparing Fig S4(e) and S4(f),† we notice that the thicknesses of the nanostructured WO3 films after 4 h and 6 h of reactions were similar, indicating that the growth of WO3 nanoflakes has been nearly brought to a halt after 4 h. We therefore selected a hydrothermal time of 4 h in this study. As for doped WO3, a similar trend has been observed (Fig. S5†), suggesting that the small amount of Fe3+ could hardly alter the growth habit of the WO3 nanoflakes. This can be attributed to the fairly close ionic radius of Fe3+ (0.64 Å) and W6+ (0.62 Å).
Electronic structure
To further identify the mechanism of how the Fe3+ ion was incorporated into the WO3 lattice, a contrastive XPS study on the prepared undoped WO3 and 2%, 5% Fe-doped WO3 was conducted. For undoped nanostructured WO3, the O 1s peak could be found at 530.5 eV, while two broad peaks at 35.7 eV and 37.9 eV corresponded with the characteristic of W6+ 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 in WO3.28,29 In the presence of Fe, two small peaks emerge on the XPS spectrum (Fig. 3 and S6†). The emerged peaks at around 712 eV and 725 eV were assigned to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Fe3+ respectively.51 The intensity becomes stronger with increased doping concentration (Fig. S6†), which suggests that more dopants have been introduced into the system. Compared with that in Fe2O3 (710.7 eV for 2p3/2 and 724.3 eV for 2p1/2),52 the Fe3+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks in doped films exhibit a slightly positive shift. Besides, we have observed a 0.2 eV negative shift of the W6+ 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks in doped films (Table 1). The shifts on the XPS spectrum are attributed to the electronegativity difference between W and Fe.53 Firstly, W has a relatively smaller electronegativity than Fe, and so, compared with the Fe–O–Fe bond, the bonding between Fe and O could be slightly enhanced in the Fe–O–W bond; this results in a slightly positive shift of the Fe3+ peaks. Conversely, the bonding between W and O is slightly reduced in Fe–O–W compared with that in W–O–W. The above mentioned XPS peak shifts revealed that Fe3+ has substituted the W6+ site and forms the Fe–O–W bond. In other words, substitutional doping, instead of surface modification or intercalated doping, is favored for the system.

The optical properties of the prepared films are characterized by the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra. Compared with undoped WO3, an improved visible light absorption was observed in doped films (Fig. 4 and S7†). For Fe-doped WO3 with a low dopant concentration (2%), the incorporation of Fe results in a slightly broadened absorption. However a higher concentration of Fe doping (5%) leads to a large positive shift of the absorption edge towards longer wavelength (from approximately 470 nm to 550 nm). Besides, Eg of the prepared films could be determined using the following equation:54 αhv = A(hv − Eg)n(2)where h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of light, A represents a constant number, and n equals 2 for WO3 (indirect transition). Fig. 4(b) plots the absorption spectra as (αhν)1/2vs. hν. We deduced an Eg of 2.69 eV for undoped WO3; this value corresponds well with the previously published results,15,27,29 while the Eg for doped WO3 was decreased to 2.60 eV (2% Fe-doped WO3) and 2.51 eV (5% Fe-doped WO3). The results indicate that the incorporation of Fe results in a reduced Eg for doped WO3. A detailed theoretical analysis of the mechanism of the reduced Eg after metal doping will be discussed below.

PEC performance
As for the PEC characterization, a standard three-electrode system was used with WO3 or Fe-doped WO3 as the working electrode, Pt wire and Ag/AgCl electrodes acted as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Two commonly used electrolytes, namely 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 and 1 mol L−1 HClO4, were used to characterize the PEC performance of the as-prepared films (Fig. S8†); however, 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 was normally used if not stated explicitly. The photocurrent of the as-prepared undoped WO3 is approximately 0.69 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE with an onset potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4. The achieved photocurrent and onset potential are comparable with other WO3 films prepared via a different method.11,29 For Fe-doped WO3, initially an enhanced PEC water splitting performance was observed with increased doping concentrations. The photocurrent has been increased from 0.69 mA cm−2 to about 0.88 mA cm−2 for 2% Fe-doped WO3, an almost 30% enhancement compared with undoped WO3. However, further increasing the doping concentration results in a rapidly declined PEC performance (less than 0.3 mA cm−2 was left for 5% Fe-doped WO3).
Additionally, IPCE measurements have been conducted to characterize the photoconversion efficiency of the synthesized undoped and Fe-doped WO3. IPCE is defined as:55 IPCE = (1240 × IPH)/(λ/Plight)(3)where IPH is the generated photocurrent density (A m−2), λ is the incident light wavelength (nm), Plight is the photon flux (W m−2), and 1240 is the unit correction factor. Here IPCE measurements were conducted at 1.23 V versus RHE. As shown in Fig. 5(d), compared with undoped WO3, a great improvement in IPCE at longer wavelengths has been observed in 2% Fe-doped WO3, which was consistent with their J–V characteristics. Besides, 5% Fe-doped WO3 exhibits a relatively low IPCE value over the wavelength region between 365 and 480 nm. However, the greatly improved photocurrent density observed in 2% Fe-doped WO3 could not be simply explained by the slightly enhanced absorption after doping (Fig. 4), so electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is performed to identify the reason for the great photocurrent enhancement; this will be discussed in the later part of the research. Finally, we have investigated the long-term stability of the as-prepared samples (Fig. S9†). For both undoped and 2% Fe-doped WO3 samples, the photocurrent density dropped quickly for the starting 200 s (approximately 10% of the photocurrent was lost for the initial 200 s illumination) and then decreases slowly after 300 s illumination (more than 80% was left after 3000 s). This testifies the good stability of our prepared Fe-doped WO3 nanoflake films.

Electrochemical studies
Electrochemical impedance measurements of the undoped and Fe-doped WO3 were performed at 5 kHz under dark conditions. The flat band potential and carrier densities of the prepared films could be estimated using the Mott–Schottky equation:39,56 1/C2 = (2/e0εε0Nd)[(V − VFB) − kT/e0](4)where C is the specific capacitance (F cm−2), e0 is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of WO3 (ε = 2028), ε0 represents the permittivity of vacuum, Nd is the carrier density, V is the electrode applied potential, VFB is the flatband potential and kT/e0 is a temperature-dependent correction term. As shown in Fig. 6, a positive slope in the Mott–Schottky plots has been observed for undoped and doped WO3, as expected for n-type semiconductors.

The calculated Nd of the undoped WO3 and 2% Fe-doped WO3 are 3.3 × 1019 cm−3 and 5.6 × 1021 cm−3, respectively. Besides, a slight positive shift has been observed in VFB (from 0.38 V versus Ag/AgCl for undoped WO3 to 0.4 V for 2% Fe-doped films), possibly due to the increased charge carrier density. Clearly, the charge carrier density has been greatly increased after doping. According to previous research studies, the increased charge density could enhance charge separation and increase electron transport, and hence improve PEC performance.38,53,57 So the greatly enhanced photocurrent density observed in 2% Fe-doped WO3 films could be attributed to the increased charge carrier density after doping, as confirmed by the obvious improvement in IPCE at the wavelength range below 460 nm. Furthermore, researchers proposed that the increased charge carrier density observed in metal doped semiconductors was attributed to the increased number of oxygen vacancies after doping.53 The facile formation of oxygen vacancies after metal doping has also been discussed by different researchers.58,59 So we suggest that the formation of oxygen vacancies could be facilitated after metal doping. A detailed discussion on the formation of oxygen vacancies in undoped WO3 and Fe-doped WO3 will be presented in the later part of the research. Although a greatly enhanced charge carrier density has been observed in slightly doped WO3, further increasing the doping concentration resulted in a decreased charge carrier density (1.5 × 1019 cm−3 for 5% Fe-doped WO3). The decreased carrier density could be attributed to the increased number of defects and recombination sites generated by overdoping. The poor crystalline nature of 5% Fe-doped WO3 also contributed to the decreased charge carrier density.
Theoretical studies
Finally, theoretical calculations have been conducted to gain a deeper insight into the effect of Fe-doping on the electronic structure of WO3. To start with, a monoclinic structured WO3 unit cell containing 8 W and 24 O atoms was built (Fig. 7) since the XRD analysis suggested the monoclinic structure (space group P21) of the as-synthesized WO3. The optimized parameters of the unit cell are a = 7.52 Å, b = 7.54 Å, c = 7.69 Å and β = 89.2°, in good accord with the XRD results. Considering the XRD and XPS data together, the as-prepared Fe-doped WO3 appears to remain monoclinic (XRD) and substitutional doping is favored (XPS) in this system, and so one W atom has been replaced by a Fe atom in the built monoclinic WO3 to represent the doped system. The largest bond length difference in WO3 and Fe-doped WO3 after geometrical optimization is <0.15 Å as shown in Fig. S10.† This is reasonable since the ionic radius of Fe3+ is close to that of W6+, and so only a slight lattice distortion was generated after doping. The Eg of the undoped WO3 was calculated to be 1.45 eV. However, this value is much smaller than the Eg achieved from the experiment (approximately 2.6 eV). We attribute this difference to the computational method and various researchers have reported a similar Eg for WO3 (1.1 eV–1.4 eV) using DFT.33,60,61 Besides, we are mainly concerned about the relative energy changes before and after doping, so we take this Eg value acceptable for the system. The VBM is located at B (0.5, 0, 0), while the CBM is located at the Γ (0, 0, 0) point, indicating the indirect band gap nature of WO3.
 Fig. 7  The optimized geometric structure of the undoped WO3 and Fe-doped WO3 (a, b); the electronic deformation density of the undoped WO3 and Fe-doped WO3 (c, d). The green and yellow regions show the electron accumulation and depletion. 
The Partial Density of State (PDOS) revealed that the VBM consisted of O 2p bonds while the CBM was dominated by the W 5d orbital, consistent with previous research studies.62 For Fe-doped WO3, it achieved an Eg of 1.19 eV, 0.25 eV smaller than that of the undoped WO3. According to the absorption spectrum, the absorption of the prepared films has been red-shifted with the increased Fe concentration, and so the results acquired from our theoretical calculations are consistent with those observed from the absorption spectrum. A detailed analysis shows that the VBM of the undoped WO3 has been upshifted by 0.16 eV and the CBM is downshifted by 0.1 eV. From the PDOS, the shifts are due to the hybridization between the Fe 3d orbital and the O 2p orbital. Initially, the VBM is dominated by the O 2p orbital; after Fe has been introduced into the system, the Fe 3d orbitals emerge around the VBM and induce a slight positive shift of the VBM, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Besides, after Fe doping, the Fe 3d state also contributes to the downshift of CBM. The upshift of VBM and the downshift of CBM in Fe-doped semiconductors have also been observed and discussed in great detail by different researchers.36,59,63

As for the oxygen vacancies, 6 identical oxygen vacancy sites were considered (Fig. S11†), and the optimized geometrical structures are shown in Fig. S12.† Here, the oxygen vacancy formation energy (E(Ovac)) was calculated using the following equation:64 E(Ovac) = {E(WO3−x) + 1/2E(O2)} − E(WO3)(5)where E(WO3−x) is the total energy of the undoped WO3 or Fe-doped WO3 with an oxygen vacancy, E(WO3) is the energy of the undoped WO3 or Fe-doped WO3 without oxygen vacancy and E(O2) refers to the energy of an O2 molecule. The calculated E(Ovac) have been summarized in Table 2. The calculated E(Ovac) for the undoped WO3 is more than 3 eV, suggesting that a large external energy is needed for oxygen vacancy formation in the undoped WO3. However, after Fe-doping, the E(Ovac) have been reduced to less than 0.4 eV, a 90% decrease compared with the undoped WO3. The dramatically reduced E(Ovac) in doped WO3 indicates that the formation of oxygen vacancies is greatly facilitated after Fe doping. Finally, the increased number of oxygen vacancies appears to be the underlying reason for the enhanced charge carrier density observed in Fe-doped WO3 films (Fig. 6), which in turn benefits the photocatalytic activities of WO3 as a whole.

Conclusion
To conclude, vertically aligned Fe-doped WO3 nanoflakes have been synthesized via the hydrothermal method. Compared with undoped WO3, greatly enhanced PEC performance was observed in 2% Fe-doped WO3 (0.69–0.88 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE). The enhancement was attributed to the following reasons: (1) reduced Eg after Fe doping as observed in the absorption spectra, and (2) increased charge carrier density after doping as confirmed by the Mott–Schottky curve. Furthermore, theoretical calculations confirmed that the reduced Eg was caused by the hybridization among Fe 3d, W 5d and O 2p orbitals. Besides, the formation of oxygen vacancies was favored after doping, which contributed to the increased charge carrier density in slightly doped films. This research paper highlighted the advantages of tailoring the electronic properties of semiconductor materials through effective doping and would be helpful for preparing high performance PEC devices.
