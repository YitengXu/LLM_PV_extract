    , Accepted 1st December 2021First published on 1st December 2021AbstractPerovskites are promising candidates for photodetectors because of their excellent optical absorption coefficient and long carrier transportation length. However, most perovskites face the great challenge of instability and narrow band response. Herein, we report a stable all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3/GaN heterojunction photodetector which exhibits a sensitive response to the radiation from the near UV band to the green band, thanks to the large optical absorption coefficient of CsPbBr3 and the effective interfacial charge transfer of the heterojunction. The heterojunction operates in both photoconductive and depletion modes. Under a reverse bias voltage, the device can be regarded as a photovoltaic-type photodetector with a responsivity of 82 mA W−1, a detectivity of 9.06 × 1012 Jones, and extremely fast response speeds (rise time of 66 ns and decay time of 20 μs). In contrast, under a forward bias voltage, the device works in photoconductive mode with a much higher responsivity of 1.78 A W−1, an external quantum efficiency of 420%, a detectivity of 6.5 × 1013 Jones, and slower response speeds (rise time of 13.5 s and decay time of 2.7 s). Our investigations demonstrate the dual-mode light-harvesting capability of the CsPbBr3/GaN photodetector and may pave a pathway towards next-generation perovskite optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
During the past few decades, optoelectronic devices have been paid significant attention owing to their applications in optical communication, environmental monitoring, and illumination.1–9 Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been regarded as promising materials for next-generation optoelectronic devices owing to their large light absorption coefficient, superior carrier transportation properties, and long carrier diffusion length.10–12 Particularly, for perovskite solar cells, the power conversion efficiency has been improved significantly and reached a high record value of 25.2%, proving their great potential in practical applications.13 A photodetector, another similar optoelectronic device that converts irradiated light into an electrical signal, has also been developed based on organic–inorganic perovskites. However, the instability of the hybrid materials in moisture environments hinders their further applications. As an alternative, the all-inorganic lead halide perovskite CsPbBr3 has been considered because of its excellent stability in the humid environment while still maintaining the large light absorption coefficient and much higher carrier mobility than its organic–inorganic counterparts.14–16
To date, the CsPbBr3 nanocrystal,17,18 microcrystal,19–21 and bulk single crystal22–25 have been developed for photodetectors with expected stability. Ding et al. fabricated a metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) photodetector based on the orthorhombic CsPbBr3 single crystal.22 The device shows excellent stability in ambient air, while the responsivity (28 mA W−1) and the response speeds (rise time = 61.5 ms, decay time = 36.2 ms) need further improvement. In addition, the MSM photodetector also exhibits a narrow response bandwidth of ∼40 nm (520–560 nm), which hinders its great potential in photoimaging and broadband spectral analysis. Thus, other materials such as ZnO,26 CuI,27 PbS,28 polymers,29 TiO2,30 CsPbI3,31 and two-dimensional materials32–34 are integrated with CsPbBr3 to fabricate the broadband heterojunction type photodetector. Owing to the space depletion layer, photogenerated carriers can be effectively separated by the built-in electric field, thus significantly promoting the response speeds. Zhang et al.27 reported a millimeter-sized single-crystal CsPbBr3/CuI photodetector with self-powered performance. Under zero bias voltage, the photovoltaic device showed a responsivity of 1.4 mA W−1 and response speeds of 0.02 ms (rise time) and 1.85 ms (decay time), which are much better than those based on its MSM counterpart. 2D materials also show great potential to hybrid with CsPbBr3 because of their unique advantages of high carrier mobility, the motion direction of certain carriers, and superb mechanical flexibility.32–34 However, the lack of large-scale fabrication of single-crystal 2D materials may hinder their future applications. Thus, a suitable inorganic material is preferred to hybrid with CsPbBr3. GaN (Eg = 3.4 eV), a III–V group binary nitride with a hexagonal crystal structure (Fig. S1a, ESI†), has received considerable attentions in optoelectronic and power devices during the past few decades.35–38 Compared with other wide bandgap materials like ZnO, diamond, and Ga2O3, the difficulty of p-type GaN has been successfully solved through controllable doping of Mg.39–41 Additionally, the GaN with wider bandgap constructs with CsPbBr3 can also broaden the response spectra instead of a narrow band response in CsPbBr3. So, p-GaN is an excellent candidate as the counterpart of CsPbBr3 while no related studies have been reported to date. Moreover, a photoconductor is usually best accommodated for high responsivity while a photodiode is preferred for fast response speed. Therefore, it is highly desirable if a hetero-photodetector can operate in both photoconductive and depletion modes so that both high photosensitivity and rapid response speed can be integrated into one single device.
Herein, we reported a CsPbBr3/GaN photodetector that could operate in both depletion and photoconductive modes. The heterojunction photodetector shows a broadband response from the near UV to the green band. Under forward bias voltage, the hetero-device operated in photoconductive mode with a high responsivity of 1.78 A W−1 and a high detectivity of 6.5 × 1013 Jones. While under reverse bias voltage, the device worked in photovoltaic mode with extremely rapid response speeds (rise time of 66 ns and decay time of 20 μs). Theoretical analysis based on the energy band structure subsequently demonstrated the operation mechanism and the response characteristics of the device under different bias voltages. These results show the great potential of the all-inorganic CsPbBr3/GaN heterojunction as a promising photodetector in future applications.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of materials
The GaN:Mg film layer with a thickness of ∼180 nm was deposited onto the c-sapphire substrate by employing a MOCVD technique following our previous report.42 CsPbBr3 monocrystals were grown in saturated solutions with a 1:1 molar ratio of CsBr and PbBr2 dissolved in 10 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. The raw materials were continuously stirred until they were completely dissolved, and then the solution was transferred to an oven and steadied at 40 °C for 20 h. After that, the precipitated CsPbBr3 monocrystals were washed with ethanol and deionized water.
2.2 Characterization
We performed X-ray diffraction to study the crystal structure of GaN and CsPbBr3. Absorption and PL spectra were utilized to investigate the optical characteristics. Time-resolved PL spectra were also performed to confirm the carrier lifetime. We observed the size and shape of the CsPbBr3 monocrystal by using an optical microscope, while the morphology of the GaN film layer was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to study the elemental distributions of Cs, Pb, and Br in the CsPbBr3 monocrystal.
2.3 Device fabrication and measurement
We directly transfer the CsPbBr3 monocrystal on the surface of the GaN film layer with the help of an optical microscope. Ni/Au was deposited on the surface of GaN to fabricate the contact electrode, while ITO was employed as the contact electrode for CsPbBr3. Both electrodes were wire bonded to the outer Cu pads, which is convenient for measurement. The photograph of the device is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The spectral response characteristics of the CsPbBr3/GaN heterojunction photodetector were measured by employing an electrochemical workstation as the data collector and a 105 W Xe lamp as the light source. The optical response tests were performed in the ambient air. The transient time-resolved photoresponse curve was measured by using an oscilloscope as the signal collector and a femtosecond laser with 514 nm wavelength as the exciting source.
3. Results and discussion
XRD patterns of the CsPbBr3 monocrystal and GaN thin film are presented in Fig. 1a. The CsPbBr3 monocrystal exhibits an orthorhombic perovskite phase (ICSD #97851) with unit cell parameters of a = 8.21 Å, b = 8.25 Å, and c = 11.75 Å. A strong diffraction peak assigned to the (020) facet and two weak peaks assigned to the (040) and (202) facets can be observed, indicating the monocrystal structure of CsPbBr3. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (020) peak is only 0.05°, further demonstrating its high crystalline quality. Besides the signal from the sapphire substrate, the XRD pattern of the GaN film layer shows a strong diffraction peak at ∼34.4° and a weak peak at around 17.12°, which can be indexed to the diffraction signals from the (002) and (001) planes of wurtzite GaN (JCPDF #50-0792), respectively. Fig. 1b shows the absorption spectra of CsPbBr3, GaN, GaN/CsPbBr3, and ITO. The cut-off absorption edges of CsPbBr3, GaN, and ITO are confirmed to be ∼545 nm, ∼365 nm, and ∼300 nm, respectively. Thus, the corresponding bandgaps for CsPbBr3, GaN, and ITO can be estimated to be ∼2.27 eV, ∼3.4 eV, and ∼4.1 eV, which agree well with previous reports.22,42 Two absorption edges are clearly observed in the absorption spectrum of the GaN/CsPbBr3 heterostructure. The wide bandgaps of GaN and ITO on both sides of the device allow the visible light to reach the middle active layer. Fig. 1c presents the room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the CsPbBr3 monocrystal and GaN thin film. The PL spectrum of the CsPbBr3 monocrystal is centered at 527 nm with a FWHM of 23 nm, which is attributed to the direct radiation recombination of electron–hole pairs. The PL signal of GaN shows a weak peak at 365 nm originated from the near band edge emission. A pair of two strong peaks at 398 nm and 434 nm can be attributed to the emissions related to Mg-doping induced acceptor energies.43,44 Obviously, the violet–blue band dominates the emission spectrum of the GaN layer at room temperature. Owing to the electron and photon scattering in the GaN:Mg layer, the thermal quenching will lead to the attenuation of interband transition, thus reducing the interband radiation recombination of GaN. The time-resolved PL decay dynamics of both materials are presented in Fig. 1d. The PL lifetime of the CsPbBr3 monocrystal and GaN thin film are 3.3 ns and 2.5 ns, respectively. The lifetime of the CsPbBr3 monocrystal is slightly shorter than that from previous reports on a single crystal, indicating a slightly higher concentration of surface recombination centers.23,24

The SEM image is presented in Fig. 2a to show the smooth surface of the GaN thin film. A typical CsPbBr3 monocrystal is also picked and observed under an optical microscope (Fig. 2b). The monocrystal has a length of ∼600 μm, a width of ∼300 μm, and a height of ∼200 μm. Additionally, a localized “paint-off” like surface is observed and numerous surface defects are introduced. According to the previous report on the orthorhombic perovskite structure,45 different crystal planes are identified in Fig. S3 (ESI†). During the planar XRD measurement configuration, the pattern is collected from the exposed (010) facet, thus only a strong diffraction signal from (020) is observed. With a more detailed SEM investigation, irregular rectangular pits (Fig. 2c) and 2D layered nucleation (Fig. 2d) can be observed. This can be ascribed to the localized insufficient reactants and non-perfected crystal growth rate. Similar defects are also observed in the CsPbBr3 single crystal reported by Ding et al.22 Therefore, surface defect-induced trap states will contribute to the photoconductive gain in the CsPbBr3/GaN photodetector, which will be discussed later. A smooth area from the CsPbBr3 monocrystal is selected to perform the energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) measurement and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). As indicated in Fig. S4b (ESI†), the disperse signals of Cs, Pb, and Br elements are precisely detected and a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:3 can be naturally expected. The EDS mapping of Cs, Pb, and Br elements is presented in Fig. S4c–f (ESI†), indicating their uniform distributions.

Fig. 3a presents the I–V curve of the CsPbBr3/GaN photodetector under dark conditions; the inset shows the schematic diagram of the device. The I–V dependency reveals a clear rectification behavior. According to the I–V curves (Fig. S5, ESI†) of the Ni/Au–GaN–Ni/Au device and ITO-CsPbBr3-ITO device under dark conditions, the rectification behavior of the photodetector is mainly originated from the GaN/CsPbBr3 heterojunction. As shown in Fig. 3b, the I–V curves under illuminated lights with wavelengths of 360 nm (25.4 μW cm−2), 400 nm (38.8 μW cm−2), 470 nm (78.6 μW cm−2), and 530 nm (30.3 μW cm−2) exhibit prominent responses to the photons with energies larger than the bandgap of CsPbBr3. The photocurrent strongly depends on the wavelength and power density of the incident lights. It is worth noting that the device shows significant responses at both reverse and forward bias voltages. In contrast, when the energy of the illuminated photon (570 nm (13.6 μW cm−2)) is smaller than the bandgap of CsPbBr3, the photocurrent is almost comparable to that under dark condition.

Responsivity (Rλ), a parameter that represents the photoelectric conversion capability of a photodetector, is comprehensively investigated and can be calculated as:42 (1)where Pλ is the optical power density of the incident light, S is the effective illuminated cross-sectional area (∼9.85 × 10−3 cm2), Iph is the photocurrent, and Id is the dark current. As indicated in Fig. 4a, the responsivities of the CsPbBr3/GaN photodetector under reverse bias voltages show a strong response to illuminated lights with wavelengths from 310 nm to 560 nm, covering from the near UV band to the green band. The responsivity of the device increases as the voltage strengthens, and the peak responsivity at −8 V reaches 82 mA W−1@530 nm. Different from the narrow band (∼40 nm) response from photodetectors fabricated on the CsPbBr3 monocrystal,18,22 the heterojunction broadens the response range to 250 nm, which is attributed to the different bandgaps of two materials. Fig. 4c summarizes the maximum responsivity as a function of reverse bias voltages, showing a threshold voltage of ∼2.8 V. Under small bias voltages (<∼2.8 V), the device shows a rather weak response. In contrast, the peak responsivities increase linearly when the applied voltage exceeds the threshold value. The peak responsivities of the photodetector under forward bias voltages are shown in Fig. 4b. The response curve is quite different from that under reverse bias voltages, revealing a slightly narrower response band of 200 nm (360–560 nm). This can be attributed to the variation of the response active layer under different applied voltages. The photodetector works in photovoltaic mode under reverse bias voltages, the depletion layer is strengthened and the response active layer locates in both the CsPbBr3 and GaN regions. However, under forward bias voltages, the built-in electric field is overcome and the device works in photoconductive mode. The larger responsivity under forward bias voltages is mainly due to the large internal gain dominated by the surface trapping states induced by the interface of CsPbBr3. However, the cost of high responsivity is the slow response speed because of the long photo-generated carrier life time. Since the light is irradiated from the CsPbBr3 side and the large photoconductive gain, the CsPbBr3 layer is mainly responsible for the response active layer. Thus, the photodetector exhibits an additional response line shape from 520 nm to 560 nm, which is similar to the response curve from the CsPbBr3 monocrystal.23,27 The relationship between the forward bias voltage and responsivity (Fig. 4d) is also similar to the finding of the reverse one. The threshold voltage is ∼3.8 V. The peak responsivity reaches 1.78 A W−1@530 nm at +8 V, which is 21 times of that under −8 V. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE)42 is as high as 420%. Detectivity (D*), another parameter that shows the sensitivity of a photodetector, is also studied to demonstrate the noise equivalent power (NEP). The detectivity can be given as:42 (2)where q is the electronic charge constant and Jd is the dark current density. According to previous reports,46–49 the shot noise is the major contribution of the total noise, and the thermal-related noise and low-frequency noise can be ignored in this case. The detectivity under reverse bias voltages is presented in Fig. S6a (ESI†) and the curve shape agrees well with that of the responsivity. The detectivity increases monotonously with the increased voltage (indicated in Fig. S6c, ESI†) and the maximum detectivity under −8 V is 9.06 × 1012 Jones. Fig. S6b (ESI†) shows the detectivity under forward bias voltages. The detectivity increases monotonously as the voltage increases from +1 V to +6 V, while it then decreases as the voltage further increases to +8 V (indicated in Fig. S6d, ESI†). The maximum detectivity at +6 V is 6.5 × 1013 Jones. Combining the I–V curve shown in Fig. 3b, the retracement of detectivity is attributed to the remarkable enhancement of dark current when the diode is in the “on state”. Theoretical analysis based on the energy band structure is employed to deeply understand the different response behavior under reverse and forward bias voltages. Combining with the previously determined bandgaps and the electron affinities of two materials,34,42 the isolated energy band structure is presented in Fig. 4e. After the formation of heterojunction, the space depletion layer is generated within the interface. As indicated in Fig. 4f, the conduction band offset (ΔEC) is calculated to be 0.18 eV and the valence band offset (ΔEV) is determined to be 1.95 eV. Without external bias voltage, this type-III band structure is favorable for the transportation of electrons in the valence band while the holes are blocked because the VBM of GaN is 1.95 eV lower than that of CsPbBr3. This can commendably explain the poor self-powered response performance of the device. Therefore, an external bias voltage is urgently demanded to drive the opposite movement of electron–hole pairs. As the reverse bias voltage increases, the VB offset needs to be overcome. That is why the responsivity (Fig. 4c) exhibits an inflection point. Under large reverse bias voltage, the responsivity–voltage properties follow the electric field-assisted emission rule (depletion mode).50,51 In this mode, the photo-gain in the device can be ignored and the response speed is fast. However, the photodetector under forward bias voltages operates in photoconductive mode with high photocurrent gain. When the forward bias voltage is smaller than the built-in potential, the collection efficiency is low. As the forward bias voltage further increases, the built-in potential is gradually overcome. That is why a threshold forward voltage is also observed. The photocurrent gain is effectively determined by large forward bias voltages:50 (3)where τp is the hole lifetime, d is the inter-space between the electrodes, μp is the hole mobility, and V is the applied forward bias voltage. Defects (VCs or Csi) in CsPbBr3 materials and the surface states play a role as hole trap states. Therefore, the minority trap model and surface states are the main contributions of photocurrent gain under large forward bias voltages. Nevertheless, the drawback of photoconductive mode is the notorious slow response speed. When the illumination light is off, carriers in the trap energies would slowly release and cause extremely slow response speed, which will be discussed below.

Response speed, the key parameter that reflects the light-signal tracking capability of a photodetector, is extremely important in different application scenarios. In the case of optical communication, a faster response speed indicates a shorter delay time in the mutual-communication processes. Here, the response speeds are thoroughly studied in terms of both “steady-state” and “transient-state” measurements. As presented in Fig. 5a, the “steady-state” I–T curve under −5 V bias voltage shows stable properties during the operation. When the 470 nm light is switched on, the photocurrent rapidly boosts and then quickly recovers to its initial state as the light is off. Fig. 5c shows the normalized one-period I–T curve extracted from Fig. 5a. The rise time (from 10% to 90% of the maximum current) and decay time (from 90% to 10% of the maximum current) are confirmed to be less than 0.2 s (resolution of the collector), thus demanding a more accurate “transient-state” test. Under reverse bias voltage, the depletion layer is strengthened by an external electrical field, which strongly promotes the opposite movement of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thus resulting in rapid response speed. However, the I–T result under forward bias voltage (Fig. 5b and d) not only exhibits high dark current but also shows slow response speeds of 13.5 s (rise time) and 6 s (decay time). The much slower response speed is mainly owing to the photoconductive effect of the device, which is well known in most oxides and CsPbBr3-based photodetectors. Therefore, the CsPbBr3/GaN photodetector can operate under both forward voltages with high responsivity and reverse voltages with rapid response speed. To confirm the accurate response speed of the depletion-mode device, a femtosecond laser with 514 nm light (the photon energy is larger than the band gap of CsPbBr3) is used as an exciting source and an oscilloscope with time resolution at the nanosecond scale is employed to collect the electrical signals. Fig. 5e shows the 5-period transient V–T curve, which reveals the high stability of the device under high optical power density (7200 mW cm−2). From the one-period V–T curve shown in Fig. 5f, the rise time and decay time are as fast as 61 ns and 60 μs. The decay trace can be fitted by a second-order exponential decayed equation:42 y = y0 + Ae−τ/τ1 + Be−τ/τ2(4)where A and B are the fitting constant, y0 is the maximum voltage, τ1 is the first-order decay time and τ2 is the second-order decay time. As presented in the inset of Fig. 5f, the decay curve was fitted well by two decay time parameters with τ1 = 31.5 μs and τ2 = 0.56 μs, suggesting that the two physical mechanisms may account for the recovery time. The former can be indexed to the RC time constant and the latter can be ascribed to the trap state-induced photoconductive effect.37 Therefore, under depletion operation mode, the photoconductive effect can be ignored. The performance parameters of the CsPbBr3-based MSM structure and heterostructure photodetectors are also summarized in Table 1. Distinctly, our device shows great performance in low dark current, high responsivity, detectivity, and response speeds.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a CsPbBr3 monocrystal was synthesized by a facile saturated solution method and a smooth GaN film layer was deposited on the sapphire substrate through a MOCVD technique. Subsequently, we fabricated a high-performance CsPbBr3/GaN heterostructure photodetector for harvesting light from the near UV band to the green band. Such a vertical structure photodetector combined the advantages of both the photodiode operated in depletion mode and the photoconductor operated in gain mode. The response time of the device under reverse bias voltage reached extremely rapid speeds (τr = 66 ns and τd = 20 μs) and the responsivity at +8 V reached a large photoconductive gain of 420%. Instead, the responsivity of the device operated in depletion mode is relatively low (∼82 mA W−1@−8 V) and the response speeds in photoconductive mode are 13.5 s (rise time) and 2.7 s (recovery time). Finally, a theoretical investigation based on the energy band structure was performed to deeply clarify the working mechanism of the response behaviors. These data show promising potential for fabricating high-performance perovskite photodetectors.
