    , Accepted 21st December 2015First published on 21st December 2015AbstractA series of green-emitting up-conversion (UC) phosphors Ba5Gd8Zn4O21:Yb3+,Ho3+ were prepared by a modified sol–gel method, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured to characterize the crystal structure. The obtained UC samples emit dazzling green light and their spectra are composed of strong green emission peaking at 544 nm and negligible red emission peaking at 666 nm with the excitation of a 980 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser diode, assigned to 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 and 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+, respectively. The dependence of UC spectra on dopant contents, temperature and pumping power was employed to analyze UC emission color stability. The possible UC mechanisms and processes were proposed based on dependence of the UC emission intensity on pump power, and the lifetimes of green emission (5F4/5S2 → 5I8) were also investigated to better comprehend the energy transfer (ET) process. The origin of spectrally pure green-emitting was discussed in detail by analyzing UC and down-conversion (DC) spectra in both the visible and NIR region by comparing that of the UC phosphor CaIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ with highly efficient green emission. Results suggest that Ba5Gd8Zn4O21:Yb3+,Ho3+ phosphors with intense green emission and high color purity have potential applications in displays and illuminating technology.
1. Introduction
Up-conversion (UC) phosphors could convert low-energy infrared (IR) light with long wavelength to high-energy visible or ultraviolet (UV) light with short wavelength through the multi-photon absorption process. Rare earth (RE) ions are generally used as luminescence centers of the UC phosphors because of their abundant electronic states, long-lived intermediate meta-stable states and ladder-like arranged energy levels.1 And research studies on lanthanide ions doped UC phosphors have been exceedingly stimulated by their multiple potential applications in illuminating technology, displays, biological imaging, solar cells, laser crystals and optical sensors.2–8 However, the abundant 4f electronic states of RE ions generally lead to multicolor emission with several emission peaks from f–f transitions, and it is necessary to quantify or purify the emission color in some special applications such as displays and illuminating fields.9 As one of the three primary colors, green UC emission can be obtained from rare earth ions Er3+ (2H11/2 → 4I15/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2), Pr3+ (1I6 → 3H5/3P0 → 3H5), Tb3+ (5D4 → 7F5), Nd3+ (2P1/2 → 4I13/2, 4G7/2 → 4I9/2), Sm3+ (4G5/2 → 6H5/2) and Ho3+ (5F4/5S2 → 5I8) under the excitation of near-infrared (NIR) light.10 Among these lanthanide ions, Ho3+ ion may exhibit predominantly green UC emission in low-phonon energy hosts, but the small absorption cross-section of Ho3+ in the NIR region usually leads to low efficiency. As an efficient sensitizer, the Yb3+ ion could offer an intense absorption band around 980 nm as well as well-matched excited levels with Ho3+ (5I8), which could harvest more pumping photons and subsequently transfer them to adjacent activator ions effectively.11
To obtain spectrally pure up-conversion luminescence (UCL) in Ho3+ doped phosphors, several attempts have been made to design single-band emission UC phosphors of high purity.12 This is a popular method of incorporating different ions in a single host to selectively populate the specific energy levels of RE luminescence centers through the energy transfer process. For example, a high red to green ratio can be realized by introducing the Ce3+ ion into the Yb3+/Ho3+ system, but it sacrifices the overall UCL intensities because of the concentration quenching effect.13 In addition, the color purity of UC emission could also be tuned by adjusting the phonon energy of the host. Employing appropriate matrixes with low phonon energy is a promising method, in which single-band emission as well as high UC efficiency could be achieved by inhibiting the non-radiative decay process. Up to now, fluoride-based UC phosphors are considered to be the most efficient UC hosts because of lower phonon energy, such as the hexagonal β-NaYF4 which is considered as the most efficient host, yet poor physical and chemical stabilities restrict their further applications.14 The oxide based host with relatively low phonon energy is an ideal selection, which could offer both high UCL efficiency as well as stable thermal and chemical properties.15 Among them, high UCL efficiency of 5.5% as well as perfect spectral color purity was reported in the Yb3+/Ho3+ doped oxide host CaIn2O4.16
Zincate complex oxide Ba5Gd8Zn4O21 offers not only excellent stability but also low phonon energy (472 cm−1) which is an ideal UC matrix. Thus, Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped Ba5Gd8Zn4O21 UC phosphors were prepared by a sol–gel process, and it could be deduced that the present system could offer excellent UC efficiency according to previous investigations.17,18 The mechanism that affects the UC emission color purity was studied in detail, and the stability of emission color with various dopant contents, temperature and pumping power were also discussed. Moreover, the origin of strong green emission intensity and spectral color purity in Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped Ba5Gd8Zn4O21 was investigated in a comparable method by using the CaIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ phosphor as a reference.
2. Experimental
2.1 Sample preparation
The Yb3+ sensitized Ho3+ doped Ba5Gd8Zn4O21 (BGZ) phosphors and blank sample were prepared using a modified sol–gel process. Here, Yb3+ and Ho3+ are expected to enter the sites of Gd3+ due to their similar ionic radius and identical valence, and the nominal formula was Ba5Gd8(1−x−y)Ho8xYb8yZn4O21 (x = 0.1–1% and y = 0–10%). High purity Gd2O3, Yb2O3 and Ho2O3 (99.99%, Shanghai Yuelong Nonferrous Metals Ltd), analytical grade (A. R.) BaCO3, ZnO and citric acid were used as raw materials and weighed according to their stoichiometric ratios. At the beginning, the required amounts of rare earth oxides Ln2O3 (Ln = Gd, Yb and Ho) were dissolved in HNO3 (A. R.) solution with consecutive heating and stirring. The excessive HNO3 was removed by evaporation, and a suitable volume of de-ionized water was added with vigorous stirring to form a transparent solution. After that, the calculated quantity of citric acid (molar ratio of citric acid to total metal ions was 2:1) was introduced into the above solution as a chelating agent. Subsequently, BaCO3 and ZnO were introduced and stirred for several minutes to obtain a transparent aqueous solution. The obtained solution was kept in an oven at 70 °C for 24 h to obtain colorless transparent resin, then further dried at 120 °C for 24 h to obtain brown dried gel. Finally, the ground dried gel was pre-heated for 5 h at 500 °C and then sintered at 1200 °C for 3 h to obtain the final samples. The reference CaIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ phosphors were prepared through a similar process as the reference.15
2.2 Measurements and characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected over an angular 2θ range from 20° to 60° using a Rigaku-Dmax 3C diffractometer (Rigaku Corp, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54056 Å) radiation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 on a Bruker Optics EQUINOX55 spectrometer, using pressed KBr tablets. The up/down-conversion photoluminescence (PL) spectra of phosphors at different temperature in the visible and near-infrared region were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrometer equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp and an Oxford OptistatDN2 nitrogen cryogenics temperature controlling system. For the UC luminescence, an external power-controllable 980 nm semiconductor laser was used as the excitation source. The measurement of lifetime for 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+ at room temperature (RT) was carried out using a 980 nm pulsed laser from an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) as the excitation source, and the signals were analyzed by using a Tektronix digital oscilloscope (TDS 3052).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase purity and structure
XRD was used to identify the crystal structure and phase purity of the powder samples in the present experiments, and all the obtained samples show similar XRD patterns. Thus, only the XRD patterns of blank BGZ, singly doped BGZ:0.5%Ho3+ and co-doped BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,5%Yb3+ samples are presented in Fig. 1a as representatives. All the observed diffraction peaks of phosphors coincide well with the standard BGZ data JCPDS no. 51-1686 and no additional diffraction peaks related to raw materials or impurities were detected, indicating the formation of a single phase with no impurities. For Ba5Gd8Zn4O21, it crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4/m, in which there are two types of BaO polyhedra: bicapped square prisms (BaO10) and irregular polyhedra (BaO10). Zn2+ ions adopt a fivefold distorted square pyramidal coordination, and the seven-coordinate Gd3+ resides in monocapped trigonal prisms. These prisms share edges and form layers stacked along the c axis, as shown in Fig. 1c.19 It can be reasonably supposed that Ho3+/Yb3+ partially substituted the sites of Gd3+ due to the similarity of their radii, which releases the restriction on the acceptable doping level. The significant shift of diffraction peaks from the low towards the higher angles was observed with the increase of dopant concentration, and the enlarged peaks (321) are shown in Fig. 1b. The calculated cell parameters according to the obtained XRD data are a = b = 13.947 Å, c = 5.723 Å, V = 1113.231 Å3 for BGZ, a = b = 13.901 Å, c = 5.733 Å, V = 1105.899 Å3 for BGZ:Ho3+ and a = b = 13.822 Å, c = 5.698 Å, V = 1093.366 Å3 for BGZ:Ho3+,Yb3+. The above results suggest that the cell parameters gradually decrease with the addition of dopants due to the smaller radii of Ho3+ (RHo = 0.958 Å) and Yb3+ (RYb = 0.925 Å) than that of Gd3+ (RGd = 1.00 Å) for coordination number (CN) = 7, indicating that the Ho3+/Yb3+ ions efficiently doped into the crystal lattice.

3.2 Stability of UC emission color
The UC emission spectra of the as-synthesized BGZ:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphors excited by a continuous near-infrared (NIR) 980 nm laser at room temperature are presented in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. These are composed of intense green emission bands at 544 nm from 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 transitions and a negligible weak red band at 666 nm from 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+. As is well-known, Ho3+ ions are activators and luminescence centers, while the Yb3+ ions are sensitizers to enhance the UC efficiency. Generally, the concentrations of the activator and sensitizer greatly influence the UC intensity, thus the optimal composition of phosphors was determined. Fig. 2a shows the UC spectra of BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,yYb3+ samples under NIR 980 nm excitation, in which the concentration of the activator Ho3+ was fixed at 0.5% and contents of the sensitizer varied from 0 to 10%. It is clearly observed that the UC intensity abruptly enhanced with the introduction of the sensitizer due to the larger absorption cross-section of Yb3+ (∼10−20 cm2) than that of Ho3+ (∼10−21 cm2) at 980 nm, thus the emission spectrum of the Ho3+ solely doped sample was compressed into a horizontal line in comparison with those of the co-doped samples.20 This result indicates that an efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ to Ho3+ occurred owing to the significant spectral overlap between the emission of Yb3+ transition 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 and the 5I8 → 5I6 absorption band of Ho3+. With the increase of Yb3+ concentration, more excitation energy from the 980 nm laser diode can be absorbed by Yb3+ and more energy can be transferred to Ho3+, leading to the increase of UCL intensity. After reaching the maximum at y = 5%, the UCL intensity decreases due to the concentration quenching effect or the energy back transfer (EBT) process from Ho3+ to Yb3+:Ho3+ (5F4/5S2) + Yb3+ (2F7/2) → Ho3+ (5I6) + Yb3+ (2F5/2).21 For the constant Yb3+ content (y = 5%) and variable Ho3+ content, a similar trend was found and the optimal Ho3+ concentration was determined to be about 0.5% according to the corresponding UCL intensity (Fig. 2b). Where UC intensity first gradually becomes stronger and then decreases with the content of Ho3+ beyond 0.5% because the concentration quenching effect occurred at high concentration by non-radiative energy loss among the dopants. In comparison, all profiles of UC spectra are similar except for relative intensity, and dominated by an intense green emission. For the red emission band, the enlarged red band is shown in the inset of Fig. 2b, which exhibits a similar variable trend with green bands though it is too weak.

The obtained samples exhibit intense spectrally pure green emissions visible to the naked eye, and the digital photograph of the sample BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,5%Yb3+ with optimal composition dispersing in ethanol under the excitation of 980 nm NIR light is shown in the inset of Fig. 2c. According to the corresponding UC spectra and the digital photo, it could be deduced that the present phosphors offer pure green emission. The Commission International del'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates of all samples were calculated and are shown in the insert of Fig. 2a, and it is found that the CIE chromaticity coordinates of all co-doped samples BGZ:Ho3+/Yb3+ are close to (0.295, 0.696) and hardly changed, indicating that the emission color of the present phosphors is independent of dopant contents. The CIE chromaticity diagram clearly shows the location of emission color in the range of the green region, which is presented in Fig. 2c.
The stability of emission color seriously affects the performance of the device in the process of application. High pumping power is usually used to enhance the efficiency of UC phosphors, which would lead to the increasing of working temperature of the phosphor. Therefore, the power and temperature-dependent UC emission of the sample BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,5%Yb3+ were representatively investigated as a function of pumping power and temperature, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows normalized UC spectra under the excitation of the 980 nm NIR laser (pumping power 20 mW) with various temperatures ranging from room temperature to 490 K, in which no remarkable change was found. The UC spectra are still dominated by the green emission from the transition 5F4/5S2 → 5I8, and the red emissions are not significantly enhanced. On comparing with Fig. 3a, a similar status was also observed in the normalized UC spectra (Fig. 3b) with the increasing of pumping power from 710 to 1838 mW. The corresponding integrated intensity ratio of red to green is close to a constant 0.070 (as shown in Fig. 3a) and is hardly influenced by temperature and pumping power. Moreover, the CIE coordinates were also calculated according to their emission spectra and displayed in the insert of Fig. 3b, those are close to a constant (0.295, 0.697) for the different temperatures and the various pumping powers in our experiments. The above phenomena imply that the present spectrally pure green emission in BGZ:Ho3+,Yb3+ phosphors offers excellent color stability which could be isolated from the impact of the temperature of the external environment and pumping power.

3.3 Mechanism of spectrally pure green UC emission
To better understand the observed phenomenon, the UC mechanisms of green and red emission were studied according to the dependence of the UCL intensity If–f on the pumping power of the 980 nm laser diode P980, which generally abides by the following equation: I ∝ Pn.22 Here, the value of n denotes the number of the NIR photons absorbed per up-converted photon emitted, which is equal to the slope of the straight line by fitting the plot of logI versus logP. To determine the number of NIR photons required for the UC process, the double logarithmic plots of integrated green (525–575 nm) and red (630–680 nm) intensity of BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,5%Yb3+ phosphors as a function of pumping power are plotted in Fig. 4a. It is found that the obtained slopes for red and green emission are 1.64 and 2.36, suggesting that the red emission is a two-photon absorption process whereas the green emission may be a mixing process of two-photon and three-photon.

According to the above results, the possible population processes in BGZ:Ho3+,Yb3+ samples were schematically given in the energy level diagrams of Ho3+ and Yb3+ with feasible transitions, as demonstrated in Fig. 4b. Under the excitation of 980 nm, the 2F2/7 + a photon (980 nm) → 2F2/5 transition of Yb3+ occurs by absorbing an infrared photon. For the green emission from the 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 transition, the excited levels 5F4/5S2 could be populated via a two-photon or three-photon process. The former process is achieved via the ET process: Yb3+ (2F5/2) + Ho3+ (5I6) → Yb3+ (2F7/2) + Ho3+ (5F4/5S2) or excitation state absorption (ESA): Ho3+ (5I6) + a photon (980 nm) → Ho3+ (5F4/5S2). The intermediary level 5I6 of Ho3+ is populated by ground state absorption (GSA): Ho3+ (5I8) + a 980 nm photon → Ho3+ (5I6) or energy transfer (ET) from Yb3+ to Ho3+:Yb3+ (2F5/2) + Ho3+ (5I8) → Yb3+ (2F7/2) + Ho3+ (5I6). Compared with the GSA process, the ET process is predominant owing to a larger absorption cross section at 980 nm of Yb3+ than that of Ho3+. As for the three-photon process, the 5F4/5S2 level is populated by non-radiative (NR) transitions from the 5F2 level. The population of the metastable state 5I4 is a result of the cross relaxation (CR) process: Ho3+ (5F4/5S2) + Ho3+ (5I8) → Ho3+ (5I4) + Ho3+ (5I7), and could be excited to an upper level 5F2via the ET process: Yb3+ (2F5/2) + Ho3+ (5I4) → Yb3+ (2F7/2) + Ho3+ (5F2). In the above-mentioned two processes, the two-photon process plays a dominant role due to the low probability of CR. Finally, the population at 5F4/5S2 levels decays radiatively to the ground state with green emission at 544 nm. For the 666 nm red emission from the 5F5 → 5I8 transition, the population at the 5F5 level could be achieved through two possible processes. One is exciting population at the long-lived 5I7 level to the upper state 5F5 level by the ET process: Yb3+ (2F5/2) + Ho3+ (5I7) → Yb3+ (2F7/2) + Ho3+ (5F5) after the NR transition of 5I6 → 5I7. In addition, the three-photon process of green emission is also in favor of red emission due to the above-mentioned CR process. The other possible process is the NR transition from 5F4/5S2 to 5F5. Thus, radiative relaxation from the 5F5 level to the ground state generates red emission at around 666 nm. Additionally, over high Yb3+ contents would lead to predominance of the EBT process from Ho3+ to Yb3+:Ho3+ (5F4/5S2) + Yb3+ (2F7/2) → Ho3+ (5I6) + Yb3+ (2F5/2).
The above analysis proves that the red emission strongly depends on the NR transition probability, and the phonon-assisted non-radiative transition probability in materials is principally influenced by the phonon energy of the matrix. The non-radiative decay rate (W) could be mathematically written as:23 (1)where T is the absolute temperature; W(T) and W(0) is the non-radiative decay rate at temperature T and 0 K, respectively; k is the Boltzmann constant, ΔE denotes the energy gap between two levels and hν is the phonon energy of the host matrix.

Fig. 5 displays the UCL spectrum of the BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,5%Yb3+ phosphor at 80 K, in which the red emission (5F5 → 5I8) completely disappears and the green emissions from 5F4 and 5S2 → 5I8 are divided. These phenomena are caused by the low non-radiative transition rate at 80 K in the samples, which coincided with eqn (1). As the energy gap between the two levels is 4–5 times larger than that of the phonon energy of the host matrix on the basis of energy gap law, multi-photon relaxation is predominant and non-radiation hardly happens.24 The FT-IR spectrum of blank BGZ was recorded to determine the phonon energy of the host, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5. The strongest phonon cut-off energy band at 472 cm−1 could be assigned to the stretching vibrations of Zn–O, which demonstrates that the phonon energy of the BGZ is approximately 472 cm−1. The energy gap between the 5I6 and 5I7 states (3450 cm−1) and that of the 5F4/5S2 and 5F5 levels (3000 cm−1) of Ho3+ is about 6–7 times larger than that of the host phonon energy, which means seven or more phonons are involved to bridge the above energy gap. The result indicates that the probability of non-radiative transitions 5I6 → 5I7 and 5F4/5S2 → 5F5 is negligible and a high population at 5F4/5S2 energy levels can be achieved, leading to an extremely weak red emission and spectrally pure green-emitting (as presented in Fig. 2a and b).

According to the above investigation, it can be deduced that the efficient ET from Yb3+ to Ho3+ ions contributes a lot to enhance UC intensities. To further prove the occurrence of the ET process, the normalized temporal curves of the green emission from the 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 transition in BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,yYb3+ (y = 5, 10%) are measured in Fig. 6 with 980 nm pulsed laser excitation. The transient of intensity exhibits an obvious distinct prolonged rise part at the end of the excitation, which proves the presence of the ET process.25 With increasing Yb3+ content (y) from 5 to 10%, the ionic distance becomes closer and a more efficient ET process occurs, leading to a shorter rising time in the temporal curves, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. It should be noted that the decay curve of Ho3+ single doped BGZ cannot be accurately monitored because of its weak emission intensity.

The effective lifetime of the emitting level could be calculated using the following eqn (2):26 (2)where I(t) denotes the UCL intensity at time t. The temporal profile can be fitted with a quadratic exponential function and the average lifetime can be defined as:27 (3)where A and t represent the amplitude and lifetime corresponding to the level depopulation channel, respectively. As listed in Fig. 6, the obtained lifetime of 5S2/5F4 states decreases from 161.26 to 59.23 μs with increasing Yb3+ content from 5 to 10%. This can be explained by the convenient EBT process: Ho3+ (5F4/5S2) + Yb3+ (2F7/2) → Ho3+ (5I6) + Yb3+ (2F5/2), and the high concentration of Yb3+ accelerates the depopulation of the 5S2/5F4 level and leads to the reduction of lifetime, which coincided with the variation tendency of green emission intensity shown in Fig. 2b.
3.4 Comparison of Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped BGZ and CaIn2O4
In order to further evaluate the green luminescence performance of the Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped BGZ phosphor, a high-efficiency CaIn2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+ green upconversion phosphor with the maximum UCL efficiency 5.5% (pumping power 1.5 W) was employed as a reference.16Fig. 7 depicts the UC spectra of the sample with optimal compositions BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,5%Yb3+ and CaIn2O4:10%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ using a comparable method, which were measured under the same conditions. It is clearly observed that the UC spectra of Ho3+–Yb3+ doped BGZ and CaIn2O4 samples are composed of dominant green emission (5F4/5S2 → 5I8) and weak red emission (5F5 → 5I8). Moreover, their red emission intensity is similar but the green emission in BGZ is stronger than that of CaIn2O4, and the integrated intensity ratio of green emission (525–575 nm) to red (63–680 nm) is 19.2 and 18.4 in BGZ and CaIn2O4 (bar graph in the inset of Fig. 7), respectively. The results suggest that the green color purity of BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,5%Yb3+ is higher than those of CaIn2O4:10%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+.

To comprehend the origin of the extremely intense green UCL luminescence, down-conversion (DC) emission spectra of BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,5%Yb3+ and CaIn2O4:0.5%Ho3+,10%Yb3+ phosphors were measured under the excitation of 490 nm light and are shown in Fig. 8. As seen from Fig. 8a, it is found that the intensity of green emission in BGZ is larger than that in CaIn2O4, whereas the red emission intensities of the two phosphors are very weak and close due to the similar probability of non-radiative (NR) transitions in the two hosts resulting from the close low phonon energy of BGZ (472 cm−1) and CaIn2O4 (473 cm−1). The inset of Fig. 8a shows the energy level diagram and possible transition pathways. Here, the incident 490 nm radiation excites an Ho3+ ion from its 5I8 ground state to the upper excited level 5F2 and then arrives at 5F4/5S2 levels by the NR1 process (5F2 → 5F4/5S2) transition. Four transition processes are related to 5F4/5S2 levels: green radiative transition emission (5F4/5S2 → 5I8), NR2 process (5F4/5S2 → 5F5), CR process (5F4/5S2 + 5I8 → 5I4 + 5I7) and EBT process Ho3+ (5F4/5S2) + Yb3+ (2F7/2) → Ho3+ (5I6) + Yb3+ (2F5/2). It is generally accepted that the probability of the CR process greatly depends on the distance of rare earth ions.28 Considering that the Ho3+ content (0.5%) in the two hosts is low enough, the probability of the CR process is so little that it can be ignored. Thus it can be concluded that the EBT process significantly influences the green emission intensity. From the near-infrared (NIR) DC spectra shown in Fig. 8a, it is observed that NIR emission (5I6 → 5I8) peaking at 1191 nm in Yb3+/Ho3+ doped CaIn2O4 is stronger than that of the BGZ phosphor, which hints that a more efficient EBT process occurs in CaIn2O4, leading to stronger NIR luminescence and weaker green emission. It is well-known that it is a competitive process for UC and DC, which plays a vital role in determining UCL intensity. Fig. 8b shows the NIR emission spectra of BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,5%Yb3+ and CaIn2O4:0.5%Ho3+,10%Yb3+ phosphors under 980 nm laser excitation. Comparing with the BGZ phosphor, it is found that the CaIn2O4 phosphor emits stronger 1191 nm NIR emission, which indicates that the probability of the DC process is higher in CaIn2O4. Namely, the BGZ phosphor achieves a more efficient UC process than the CaIn2O4 phosphor because of the confrontational relationship between the UC and DC process, resulting in more intense green UC emission. Therefore, low probability of EBT and NR processes as well as the efficient UC process against the DC process may be attributed to the high green UCL intensity and color purity in Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped BGZ phosphors.

4. Conclusion
Ho3+/Yb3+ co-doped Ba5Gd8Zn4O21 (BGZ) up-conversion (UC) phosphors with excellent green emission color purity were synthesized by a sol–gel method, and the optimal composition is BGZ:0.5%Ho3+,5%Yb3+. Their UC spectra are composed of intense green emission (544 nm) from 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 transitions and negligible red emission (666 nm) from 5F5 → 5I8 transitions of Ho3+ under the excitation of 980 nm light. The stability of color purity is hardly influenced by dopant contents, temperature and pumping power. The UC mechanism and possible processes, along with the decay curves of 5F4/5S2 → 5I8 emission were investigated, in which the energy transfer process plays a predominant role. The low phonon energy of BGZ (472 cm−1) is responsible for the weak red UC emission. In addition, high green intensity originated from the low probability of EBT and NR processes as well as the efficient UC process, which were investigated by a comparable method using CaIn2O4:10%Yb3+,0.5%Ho3+ phosphors with the maximum UC efficiency of 5.5% as a reference. The results indicate that the present Yb3+/Ho3+ co-doped Ba5Gd8Zn4O21 phosphors offer perfect green UC emission and color stability and could be considered as potential candidates for display and illuminating technology.
