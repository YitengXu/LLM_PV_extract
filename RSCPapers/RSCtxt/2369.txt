    , Accepted 23rd May 2022First published on 24th May 2022AbstractThe growth of ZnS photoelectrodes on ZnO particles identified as ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) by the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method showed excellent photovoltaic parameters of JSC = 1.2 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.66, even compared to ZnS(ZC + TAA) used as a reference sample with JSC = 0.15 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.52. A careful analysis indicates that the better charge transfer and the higher resistance to recombination present in the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) samples were the origin of the best photovoltaic behavior. These assertions are supported by a set of samples synthesized from different precursors resulting in different crystal structures, which can be directly associated with current densities and fill factors. All aspects about synthesis and optical/electronic parameters associated with structural features will be available in this article.
1 Introduction
Zinc oxide (ZnO),1–3 a broadband (type n) semiconductor (Eg = 3.37 eV), stands out, for having high carrier mobility (electrons),4 and good thermal, optical and electrochemical sensitivity;5,6 in addition, studies demonstrate its ability to aggregate with various compounds to form materials such as ZnO/ZnTe,7 ZnO/ZnSe,8 ZnO/ZnS,9 TiO2/ZnO,10 and ZnO/TiO2/Sb2S3,11 resulting in synergistic properties.
On the other hand zinc sulfide (ZnS)12,13 is an important semiconductor of the II–VI group with high potential and is widely researched due to its excellent chemical and physical properties.14 It can be synthesized using various methods such as the sol–gel method, solid-state reaction, hydrothermal and solvothermal methods, the ultrasonic irradiation method, and the HAM (microwave-assisted hydrothermal) method, among others.12,15
Generally, ZnS is present in cubic sphalerite (Eg = 3.77 eV) and/or hexagonal wurtzite (Eg = 3.72 eV) structures. Some studies show the versatility of this system in relation to its capacity for structural manipulation in a relatively simple way through structural modification according to the synthesis strategies.15,16 Such susceptibility makes it possible to manipulate its optical and electrical properties, among others, which facilitates property optimization and material design for different types of applications.12,17 ZnS can be used for several applications, such as: photocatalysis,17 field effect transistors (FETs),18 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),19 sensors (UV, chemical, biosensors),14 and photovoltaic cells,20 among others.21,22 It has several advantages such as its excellent transport properties for charge carriers, which provide a reduction in the rate of recombination, good thermal stability, non-toxicity, high electronic mobility and a relatively cheap cost.15
In the case of photovoltaic cells, it appears that ZnS has been studied from various perspectives, for example, in: blocking layers (passivating layers);23 nano thin films;24 heterojunction photoelectrode films;25 core–shell26 and/or decorated systems;27,28 and multilayer systems;29 among other applications.
Core–shell systems,30,31 or decorated systems, as we prefer to refer to ZnS grown on ZnO like in this work, are hybrid systems that consist of two (or more) materials in order to combine each of their best properties in search of a more effective product.27,31 ZnO/ZnS based materials are increasingly used in several applications such as in solar cells,27,32 gas sensors,30,33,34 photocatalysis,35 and lithium ion batteries,36 among other applications37,38 as reported in the literature, making them promising for further studies.
The type II band alignment of the ZnO/ZnS system9,11,39,40 is beneficial for improvements in the electrical conductivity (σ). According to Chun et al., in the comparison between ZnO nanowires (NWs) and ZnO/ZnS, improvements in the charge transport characteristics of the material can be observed due to the electron confinement and reduction of the ZnO surface states. Also, due to the capacity to reduce the recombination effect of photogenerated electrons that would contribute to an increase in the generated photocurrent.41 In contrast, Wang et al. comment that core/shell systems improve the transport of charges and also contribute to a reduction in the interfacial recombination rate, which is one of the obstacles to the photogeneration of electrons in photovoltaic cells.42
The potential of the ZnO/ZnS system appears in several studies, such as the work reported by Sun et al.29 in which a multilayer core–shell ZnO/ZnS system was proposed in which layers of ZnS were superimposed on a ZnO system providing an improvement in the open-circuit voltage (VOC), for photovoltaic cells. Chen et al.43 tested the potential of a core–shell ZnO/ZnS material as a photoelectrode applied in photovoltaic cells, with FTO + Pt, with a reflective aluminum layer on the counter electrode and a ruthenium-sensitized photoelectrode, also demonstrating an interesting photovoltaic response. In contrast Rouhi et al.,44 using a controllable morphology of nano cones, obtained an interesting performance in dye-sensitized ZnO/ZnS solar cells, synthesized on FTO. In this sense, the ZnO/ZnS system has shown potential for photovoltaic applications, making it a very attractive material in view of improvements in the efficiency of photovoltaic devices.29,43,44
Manaia et al.45 reported that another relevant fact concerns the possible transformation of ZnO into ZnS, according to the synthesis conditions, such as the case of the use of thioacetamide (TAA). Swati and Morampudi46 reinforce the potential of TAA as a transforming agent of ZnO into ZnS, when TAA is hydrolyzed with water to form hydrogen sulphide gas that, when reacting on the surface of ZnO crystals, gives rise to ZnS particles. Such transformation or secondary crystallization, as suggested by Ma et al. indicates a synthesis strategy that can influence the charge transfer between the active film and the blocking layer in photovoltaic applications, among others.17
Ke et al. showed that a TiO2/ZnS cascade Electron Transport Layer (ETL) can significantly improve the VOC and PCE of a photovoltaic system, attributing such improvement to an effective reduction in interfacial recombination while at the same time facilitating the electron transfer.47
Several studies related to ZnO, ZnS and ZnO/ZnS with different precursors have been developed in recent years with the aim of modifying the size and shape of nanoparticles.12,48 With relevance to ZnS, the use of several precursors stands out, with emphasis on the zinc ion (Zn), and the reagents zinc acetate (ZA),49 zinc nitrate (ZN)50 and zinc chloride (ZC)51 and, for the sulfur ion (S) can be highlighted the precursors thiourea (TIO)16,51 and thioacetamide (TAA).23,52 La Porta et al. reported a theoretical–experimental study using ZA, ZN, ZC and TIO to obtain ZnS. In this context, different optical properties are observed and analyzed, from which it was verified that the change of the precursor (zinc source) alters the optical properties (PL – photoluminescence) of the ZnS system, demonstrating potential for photocatalytic applications,53 and consequently it can also impact photovoltaic applications.
In this work, we develop ZnS grown on ZnO systems, in which the key point is the HAM method54–56 associated with implementation of different precursors that can affect the optical and photovoltaic properties of the material, which becomes a potential candidate for applications in photovoltaic devices.
2 Methodology
2.1 Experimental section
This section will present detailed procedures to synthesize ZnO, ZnO/ZnS, and ZnS samples, solar cell settings, and the technical description of characterization. All precursors were analytical grade without further purification.

2.1.1 Synthesis of ZnO particles. 
A homogeneous solution containing 45 mL of distilled water and 2.6 mmol of Zn ions from precursor Zn(CH3COO)·2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to another homogeneous solution of 0.1 mol of NaOH in distilled water. The resulting solution was taken to the reaction cell (PTFE) under 2.45 GHz microwave radiation system, with a power of 800 W and a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, heated at 130 °C for 40 min, and then washed at 5000 rpm and subsequently dried at 80 °C for 5 h, to get a power.


2.1.2 Synthesis of ZnS grown on ZnO. 
To perform the growth of ZnS on ZnO, via HAM synthesis, the following procedure was adopted. Initially, 5 mmol of ZnO was dispersed in 25 mL of distilled water in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min (solution 1). Solution 2 was obtained separately from the dissolution of 10 mmol of thiourea (TIO) in 75 mL of distilled water until the solute dissolved and then 5 mmol of (Zn(CH3COO)·2H2O) was added to solution 2, and after 10 min under constant stirring, solution 1 was added and kept under constant stirring, until a homogeneous solution was obtained. The obtained solution was placed inside the microwave reaction cell (PTFE), operating at 2.45 GHz, with a power of 800 W and a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 at 130 °C for 40 min. After synthesis, the precipitate was removed from the reaction cell and then washed once with water and once with isopropanol, and dried at 80 °C for 5 h.
The other compounds were obtained similarly, by replacing Zn(CH3COO)·2H2O (zinc acetate, ZA) with Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (zinc nitrate, ZN) and ZnCl2 (zinc chloride, ZC), keeping the thiourea (TIO) unchanged and by using Zn(CH3COO)·2H2O with thioacetamide (TAA) and by replacing Zn(CH3COO)·2H2O with Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and ZnCl2, keeping the TAA unchanged, which gave rise to six different possibilities ZnO/ZnS(ZA + TIO), ZnO/ZnS(ZN + TIO), ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TIO), ZnO/ZnS(ZA + TAA), ZnO/ZnS(ZN + TAA) and ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA).


2.1.3 Synthesis of ZnS particles. 
To perform the growth of ZnS by HAM synthesis, the following procedure was adopted. A solution was obtained from the dissolution of 10 mmol of TAA in 75 mL of distilled water and then 5 mmol of ZnCl2 was added to the initial solution, and was subjected to constant stirring for 10 min until a homogeneous system was obtained. The obtained solution was placed inside the microwave reaction cell (PTFE), operating at 2.45 GHz, with a power of 800 W and a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 at 130 °C for 40 min. After synthesis, the precipitate was removed from the reaction cell and then washed once with water and once with isopropanol, and dried at 80 °C for 5 h.


2.1.4 Photovoltaic devices. 
Initially, the substrates were cleaned using three successive ultrasonic baths for 10 min in neutral detergent, distilled water and ethyl alcohol.
The photoelectrode was composed of a TiO2 blocking layer (BL) based on titanium isopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in isopropanol (0.3 mol) and deposited by spin-coating in an area of 1 cm2 in two steps: (i) 1500 rpm for 15 s; (ii) 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed subsequently by thermal treatment at 125 °C for 10 min and annealing at 500 °C for 30 min,57 on an FTO substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 7 Ω sq−1). After this process, a thick film was deposited on the BL layer with a doctor blade using a paste obtained from dissolution and consecutive vortexing of 25 mg of material (ZnO/ZnS, ZnO) in 7.5 μL of TRITON X-100, 2.5 μL of ethylene glycol (EG), and 2.5 μL of ethanol. This was followed by two heat treatments: (i) 125 °C for 10 min and (ii) 450 °C for 30 min. Then, the films were immersed in a solution of 0.3 mol of ruthenium (N-3), implemented as a dye, and remained in a dark box for 24 h.
The counter electrode of Pt on FTO (diameter = 1 mm) was deposited by brushing58 a solution of 5 mmol of H2PtCl6 in isopropanol, followed by two successive heat treatments involving heating from 25 °C to 385 °C with a rate of 5 °C min−1 and maintaining at 385 °C for 10 min.59 The sealing and spacing of 60 μm were obtained via a Meltronix 1170-60. The photoelectrode and counter electrode are attached and sealed by introducing the electrolyte Z-150 (Solaronix). The schematic model is similar to that used by other researchers, as found in the literature.60–64


2.1.5 Characterization. 
The structural phase and crystallinity level of the samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation from 20 to 100° with a 0.02° step width and a scanning rate of 5 s to each point. UV-Vis measurements were performed with a high-resolution Ocean Optics HR2000+ spectrometer, in the range of 300 to 1000 nm coupled to a Thorlabs IS200 integration sphere. FT-Raman spectra were recorded on a Bruker MultiRam spectrometer using a liquid nitrogen-cooled Ge diode as the detector. The 1064 nm excitation line of an air-cooled Nd:YAG-laser was applied as the light source. The FT-Raman signal was collected in the backscattered direction, and recorded over a range of 100 to 1700 cm−1 using an operating spectral resolution of 1.0 cm−1, and a laser power output of 100 mW. The morphology of the samples was obtained using FE-SEM (Zeiss Supra35), operating at 5 kV and EDX measurements were performed using a field emission scanning electron microscope, model Inspect F50, operating at 20 kV. The photovoltaic J–V response of the cells was measured at 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) at room temperature (25 °C) using a solar simulator (SLB-300A – ScienceTech) operating together with a potentiostat (VersaSTAT 3 – AMETEK Scientific Instruments). EIS was performed in the dark with a signal amplitude of 10 mV in a frequency range from 103 Hz to 0.02 Hz with −0.65 V potential bias. Photoluminescence (PL) was performed by using a Mini PL/Raman system (Photon Systems, USA), by means of 5.0 eV (248.6 nm) laser excitation (about 50 mW and 20 μs pulse width), a 1/8 M monochromator, and a PMT detector resulting in a high-resolution system (0.2 nm).

3 Results and discussion
The structure was analyzed, as shown in Fig. 1A and B. The ZnO sample crystallizes in the wurtzite phase (ZW) since all peaks could be indexed from the JCPDS card: 3-888, whereas ZnS indicates growth with preference for zinc blende (ZB) indexed from the JCPDS card: 65-309. However, some interesting changes were observed for samples synthesized with TIO or TAA that will be described as follows (Fig. 1A).
 Fig. 1  (A) XRD patterns of the samples: (a) ZnO; (b) ZnO/ZnS(ZA + TIO); (c) ZnO/ZnS(ZA + TAA); (d) ZnO/ZnS(ZN + TIO); (e) ZnO/ZnS(ZN + TAA); (f) ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TIO); and (g) ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) and (B) XRD patterns of the samples: (g) ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) and (h) ZnS(ZC + TAA) 
The sample ZnO/ZnS(ZA + TIO) retains the ZnO pattern (card: 3-888) and includes planes related to the ZnS compound (card: 65-309). Although, for the other samples synthesized with ZnS grown on ZnO, the absence of diffraction planes corresponding to ZnS can be observed, thus indicating the prevalence of the ZnO wurtzite phase. Then, the ZnS diffractions observed for ZnO/ZnS(ZA + TIO) arise from favorable chemical reactions between ZA and TIO.
In the case of TAA for ZnS grown on ZnO, there is the prevalence of ZnS and the unidentified of ZnO particles, as can be seen in Fig. 1A for (c) ZnO/ZnS(ZA + TAA), (e) ZnO/ZnS(ZN + TAA) and (g) ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) systems, which suggests a conversion of ZnO to ZnS as reported in some studies such as in Manaia et al.45
In Fig. 1B differences in crystallinity and the enlargement of some main ZnS peaks are observed, when comparing (g) ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) and (h) ZnS(ZC + TAA) samples. For the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) sample, a higher crystallinity and broadening of some peaks are verified, indicating an increase in the particle size, possibly due to the presence of ZnO that subsequently turned into ZnS. These differences in crystallinity and interactions between ZnO and ZnS are due to the different sources of Zn and S associated with the microwave-assisted method.65 Consequently, the materials are demonstrated to have different optical and photovoltaic characteristics, which will be presented and discussed later.
The active vibrational modes of ZnO are identified in Fig. 2 in the zoomed in box and are widely discussed in the literature,66,67 as described in our previous article.62 All Raman modes were attenuated if TIO was used as the sulfur source for the ZnS growth process. No vibrational mode of ZnS was observed because it is not crystalline as previously explained in the XRD discussion and evidenced in Fig. 1. On the other hand, for ZnS grown on ZnO obtained by use of TAA as the sulfur source, some vibrational modes were identified at 264–350 cm−1 (first-order) and 217, 616, 639 and 670 cm−1 (second-order), associated with the cubic phase (ZB) of ZnS (Fig. 2A)68 already observed by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1. The two peaks observed at 264 and 350 cm−1, respectively, can be associated with T2(TO) and T2(LO) phonon modes of ZnS. The peaks at 217, 616, 639 and 670 cm−1 can be assigned to ZnS as 2(0) at W, 2(TO), 2(TO), and 2(LO) modes, respectively, where W corresponds to the given phonon energy for the destination.68

It is important to point out that these vibrational modes were activated in a high symmetry structure. Thus in our point of view, this is the result of the TAA source associated with the electromagnetic radiation used in the synthesis method.
Through the PL spectra in Fig. 3A and B, it is possible to identify that in samples synthesized with TIO there is a tendency for displacement of the wavelength to the right compared with the ZnO sample (spectrum red shift). Whereas for samples obtained with TAA the curves tend to shift left (spectrum blue shift).
 Fig. 3  (A) PL of the samples: (a) ZnO; (b) ZnO/ZnS(ZA + TIO); (c) ZnO/ZnS(ZA + TAA); (d) ZnO/ZnS(ZN + TIO); (e) ZnO/ZnS(ZN + TAA); (f) ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TIO); and (g) ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA). (B) Sample details for (a) ZnO; (b) ZnO/ZnS(ZA + TIO); and (e) ZnO/ZnS(ZN + TAA). 
In the case of ZnO/ZnS synthesized with TIO, the spectrum red shift indicates a decrease in the bandgap, while the opposite behavior is obtained for ZnO/ZnS with TAA. Also, the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) and ZnO/ZnS(ZN + TAA) samples synthesized with TAA according to Fig. 3A and B presented a systematic reduction of PL intensity due to reduced electron–hole recombination.69 Additionally, the samples synthesized with TIO showed even weaker PL, but do not contain the crystalline ZnS phase.
The photoluminescence decay observed mainly for sample ZnO/ZnS(ZC-TAA) offers an important argument about charge carrier relaxation dynamics. In our case, strict band-alignments were not observed; instead a similar phenomenon described as spatial separation of positive (hole) and negative (electron) carriers at ZnO and ZnS respectively was observed. The spatial carrier separations result in reduction of the attractive potential effect on the negative carriers at ZnS caused by the holes located at ZnO, and PL emission was strongly reduced as observed in Fig. 3A.42
The bandgap values of the ZnO/ZnS sample systems are shown in Fig. 4. Their values were determined from the Kubelka–Munk70 model and are detailed in Table 1. For the ZnO sample and also for all samples with TIO, the bandgap values were around 3.1 eV, while for the samples with TAA the bandgap values were between 3.2 eV and 3.3 eV. These results corroborate with the bandgap behavior indicated by the PL results. The bandgap increase is a consequence of the blue shift, as explained in the PL section.

Through a comparison between ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) and ZnS(ZC + TAA) photovoltaic cells, it is possible to verify in Fig. 5 that ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) offers a better photovoltaic response in terms of photocurrent (JSC) and also photovoltage (VOC) among all samples. The better photovoltaic performance results from the highest value of the bandgap with a tendency towards the UV region. This is probably due to the crystalline phase of ZnS for TAA samples, which consequently favors the photovoltaic process, as discussed in the PL and UV sections.

From Table 2 it is noticeable that JSC = 1.2 mA cm−2 with a respective VOC of 0.63 V, a FF of 0.65 and efficiency of 0.49%. However, these values do not reveal a high efficiency, due to our samples being monolayers and prepared without doping with another semiconductor, the absence of a reflective counter electrode layer, and solar cells additives or surfactants, among other features, which can improve the overall efficiency of systems. In this sense, our devices present greater simplicity in the preparation methods and responses comparable to those of others previously reported in the literature.

We also emphasize that the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) cell presents strong ZnS traces and the transformation from ZnO to ZnS, for this system, resulted in ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) having better photovoltaic properties even compared to the pure ZnS sample, as shown in Fig. 5.

Fig. 6 shows the dark current density curves of the photovoltaic cells for ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) and ZnS(ZC + TAA). The device assembled with ZnS(ZC + TAA) possesses the lowest leakage current, while the highest leakage current is observed in the device utilizing the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) sample. This signifies that the transformation of ZnO into ZnS did not influence the dark current density, and the main contribution results from photoexcitation of ZnO/ZnS due to charge carrier separation as discussed in the photoluminescence section. Thus, negative carriers located at ZnS are less affected by the attractive potential of holes located at ZnO, resulting in higher electron mobility and hence, higher photo currents.

This fact shows that ZnS grown over ZnO in the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) sample, which shows strong traces of ZnS with the disappearance of ZnO, compared to the other compounds, demonstrates an optical absorption capacity higher than that of pure ZnS, making it an interesting candidate for photovoltaic applications, when obtained using the HAM method.
The SEM images of nanoparticles in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) reveal issues related to homogeneity, respectively for the ZnO and ZnO/ZnS systems. Even without the evident presence of ZnO in ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) noted in the XRD and Raman, the SEM-FEG images (Fig. S2, ESI†) show the existence of ZnO clusters encapsulated by spherical particles of ZnS, which prevails in this system, strongly corroborating the better charge transfer of the material obtained, with a similar charge separation process to that which occurs in a type II band alignment,34,71 but with a marked blue shift due to the predominance of ZnS in the sample.72

Fig. 7 shows the Nyquist plot obtained without illumination to observe the electron recombination.71 The equivalent circuit model presents RS as the sheet resistance of the substrates and electrical contacts of the FTO. RPt and CPE1 (constant phase element of the capacitance) represent the charge transfer resistance and the double-layer capacitance of the counter electrode at the Pt/electrolyte interface, respectively. Rrec is the resistance to recombination through the charge transfer in the film semiconductor/electrolyte interface.71,73 CPE2 is related to the chemical capacitance of the photoelectrode representing the electron charge density as a function of the Fermi level.74,75 CPE2 is not a pure capacitance due to the non-homogeneity of the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) semiconductor film and the effect of the double layer present at the interface between the electrolyte and the semiconductor film, which are corroborated by the index n (capacitive ideality index) which is 0.69 and 0.90 for cells (g) and (h), respectively.

In addition to the homogeneity of the particles and the film itself, there is the heterogeneity caused by the presence of a ZnO/ZnS interface that cells with only ZnS do not have, which demonstrates that the presence of ZnO makes the system less homogeneous and also less capacitive, as shown by the EIS analysis performed.
We emphasize for the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) photovoltaic cell a high resistance to interfacial recombination (Rrec) for the cell composed of a ZnS(ZC + TAA) photoelectrode as shown in Table 3. This explains the higher current density obtained by the cell with the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) photoelectrode, as shown in Fig. 5. Thus, the high resistance to recombination effect corroborates the charge transport being more effective,73 which contributes to the higher current density (JSC), as already pointed out for the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) cell compared to ZnS(ZC + TAA) as shown in Table 2. This evidences that better charge transfer is observed in the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) system.

4 Conclusions
After a careful analysis of the results presented in this work, we identified that the transformation of ZnO into ZnS in the sample with zinc chloride and thioacetamide leads to a crystal structure that from an XRD point of view indicates the formation of only ZnS. However, this ZnS structure was somehow affected by the original ZnO structure that was previously prepared. Based on this argument, we understand that the presence of this ZnO at the moment of structural transformation caused the ZnS to have electronic characteristics completely different from those of zinc sulfide obtained by the same method, but without the presence of zinc oxide. This results in less electronic recombination compared to pure ZnS. Thereby, this automatically leads to a higher current present in the system, which translates to current density as presented in the obtained data. The main reason for the increase in current observed in the ZnO/ZnS(ZC + TAA) sample is the greater freedom of the negative charge carriers, as a consequence of the spatial separation of the charges in the sample. Therefore, we believe that the sample preparation methodology and the type of precursor chosen were decisive for obtaining a high photocurrent and a high fill factor, and this proves that the methodology for preparing a photo-electrode is crucial for the ultimate photovoltaic properties. This type of approach can be extended to several other compounds existing in the literature.
