    , Accepted 8th March 2012First published on 28th March 2012AbstractInterfacial interactions are often found in human medical devices, hybrid solar cells, and catalysis. However, there is a lack of control of these interactions when tailoring the materials properties for many technological applications. As a case study, we reported on the synthesis of Ag–CeO2 core–shell nanospheres with the aim of strengthening the interfacial interactions to give enhanced catalytic performance. All core–shell nanospheres were synthesized by a surfactant-free method with a subsequent annealing redox reaction. Systematic sample characterizations indicate that metallic Ag cores with a diameter of 50–100 nm were wrapped by assembled nanoparticles of CeO2 with a shell thickness of 30–50 nm to form a nano-scale core–shell structure. The interfacial interactions between the Ag core and CeO2 shell were strengthened by annealing, surprisingly, as followed by generation of oxygen vacancies to provide abundant of absorption sites for oxygen species. As a consequence, the temperature for oxygen spilling was lowered to 79 °C, and the catalytic performance was abnormally enhanced, as indicated by complete CO oxidation at 120 °C with no sign of deactivation, even when the reaction time is beyond 100 h. The reaction products were desorbed quickly from the surfaces of the core–shell nanospheres, which accounts for their superior stability during catalytic reactions.
1. Introduction
Interfacial interactions are fundamentally important in many sciences and technologies like human medical devices, hybrid solar cells, and catalysis, since they play a key role in improving biocompatibility of biomaterials for biological responses,1 enhancing charge transfer between organic donors and inorganic acceptor materials for increased efficiency,2 or even in activating novel material properties for many applications.3–6 Several strategies have been developed to control the interfacial interactions in many classes of materials, and some big progress has thus been achieved. Nevertheless, it is still very difficult to get insight into the interfacial roles in composite materials, which challenges one's ability to comprehend and moreover control the interfacial interactions essential for designing novel materials and functionalities.
As a well-known example, interfacial interactions in noble-metal supported catalysts directly determine the catalytic processes for many fundamental chemical reactions.7–11 To strengthen the interfacial interactions between the noble metals and supports, supported catalysts prepared by impregnation have to experience a high-temperature sintering like 500 °C for activation.12 However, it is then inevitable that aggregation will occur for the noble metals and oxide supports during the sintering process, which will lead to a significant decrease in the catalytic property. Such a problem can be avoided by confining noble metal particles within carbon nanotubes9 or some other porous materials, which indeed gives rise to a highly catalytic performance from the strengthened contact between reaction gases and catalysts. Unfortunately, the relevant sample preparation methods are usually very complicated, and the sizes of the metal particles are still not controllable for strengthening the interfacial interactions for enhanced catalytic performance.
We propose that if metal particles were wrapped by assembled tiny oxide nanoparticles, one can expect no agglomeration of metal particles at high temperatures, distinct from the conventional noble-metal supported catalytic structures or capsulation structures. Most importantly, the interfacial interactions between core the metal and wrapped support could be conveniently adjusted by relatively simply methods. The synergistic effects from core metals and wrapped supports would become enhanced, yielding a huge leap in catalytic reactivity and stability.
In this work, we took core–shell structure Ag–CeO2 as the catalytic system and CO catalytic oxidation as the model reaction. First, the core of Ag nanoparticles was wrapped in the assembled shell of CeO2 nanoparticles at room temperature. The interfacial interactions for core–shell structure Ag–CeO2 were optimized by hydrothermal treatment and annealing, which has led to an excellent catalytic activity towards complete oxidation of CO with a long-term stability. The strategy reported here is fundamentally important, and could be extended to other metal–semiconductor hybrids with tailored interfacial processes for highly catalytic reactions.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Sample synthesis
All reagents employed in the experiments were analytic grade and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 10.098 g Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and 5.926 g AgNO3 were dissolved into 30 mL distilled water to form a solution, which was then added into 20 mL NH3·H2O diluted solution (7.64g NH3·H2O, 25%) while stirring for 1 min. A precipitate thus obtained was rinsed carefully with distilled water, and dried in air at 80 °C. The final solid powder was core–shell Ag–CeO2 as demonstrated below, and was named as Ag–CeO2-R.
To optimize the interfacial interactions in core–shell Ag–CeO2, four parallel synthetic experiments were performed: i) hydrothermal treatment, during which Ag–CeO2-R was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and stayed at 120 °C for 40 min. The autoclave was then cooled to room temperature naturally, and the obtained precipitate was rinsed carefully with distilled water and dried at 80 °C. The final solid powder was named as Ag–CeO2-H; ii) high temperature annealing, during which Ag–CeO2-H was heated in air at 500 °C for 5 h. The final product was named as CeO2–Ag-A; iii) pure phase CeO2 synthesis, which just follows the procedure for Ag–CeO2-A, but with no AgNO3 reagent involved in the reactions; and iv) pure phase metallic Ag synthesis, for which a solvent thermal process was used. Namely, 1 g AgNO3 and 0.5 g PVP were added into 60 mL methanol to form a mixture solution, which was removed to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (100 mL) and reacted at 160 °C for 8 h. The final precipitate was rinsed thoroughly with methanol and dried at 40 °C.
2.2 Sample characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a Rigaku MinFlex II benchtop X-ray diffiractometer with Cu-Kα irradiation. The crystallite sizes for the samples were calculated according to the Scherrer formula, D = 0.89λ/βcosθ, where λ is the X-ray wavelength employed, θ is the diffraction angle for diffraction peak employed, and β is defined as the full width at the half-height after subtracting the instrumental broadening effect. Morphologies of the samples were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM–6700). Microstructures of the samples were determined by transmission electron microscope (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on JEM–2010.
Specific surface areas of the samples were determined from nitrogen adsorption data at liquid nitrogen temperature using the Barrett–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 Surface Area and Porosity Analyzer. Chemical compositions and binding energy differences for the samples were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on an ESCA–LAB MKII apparatus with Al Kα radiation. The C1s signal was used to correct the charge effects. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) tests were carried out in a conventional flow apparatus with a TCD detector at heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using 5 vol.% H2 in Ar. Before TPR tests, samples were pre-treated in Ar at 200 °C for several hours.
Thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) of the samples were carried out using a STA449C thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in N2 within a temperature range between 20 and 900 °C. Molar ratios of Ag to Ce for a series of Ag–CeO2 samples were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma OES spectrometer (ICP) (Ultima2). Infrared spectra of the samples were measured on a Perkin–Elmer IR spectrophotometer at a resolution of 4 cm−1 using the KBr pellet technique. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker ELEXSYS E300 spectrometer at room temperature. The spectrometer was operated at X-band frequency with a microwave power of 0.635 mW and 100 kHz field modulation.
2.3 CO catalytic oxidation evaluation
Catalytic activities of all samples were evaluated with a fixed-bed flow reactor with a diameter of 6 mm. The weight of catalysts used was 100 mg, and the reaction gas consisting of 1% (v/v) CO and 99% (v/v) high purity air was fed at a rate of 20 mL min−1 under a pressure of 0.1 MPa, equivalent to a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 12,000 mL.g−1.h−1. The composition of the effluent gas was detected with an online GC–2014 gas chromatograph. The conversion of CO was calculated from the difference in CO concentration between the inlet and outlet gases.
CO chemisorption was measured on a Finesorb-3010C Chemisorption Analyzer. Before the experiment, the catalyst was purged with a He stream at a rate of 30 ml min−1 for 30 min at 80 °C, and then the consecutive CO pulses (1% CO balanced with 99% He) were ejected at this temperature. Chemisorption quantity was calculated through comparing the changes of the initial pulses' area and the average pulse area when the pulse area reached constant.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Formation of core–shell nanostructures by wrapping Ag nanoparticles in CeO2 aggregates
The strategy for forming Ag–CeO2 core–shell spheres was proposed to proceed through a continuous evolvement of cerium species and agglomeration of small Ag nanoparticles necessary for a decreased surface energy. Just like what was reported by Kayama and co-workers,13,14 at the beginning of the chemical reactions, addition of ammonia leads to the formation of Ce(OH)3 and Ag2O precipitates. Ag2O precipitates fast transform into Ag(NH3)2+ complexes with excess ammonia addition. Ag(NH3)2+ complexes were then adsorbed onto the surfaces of Ce(OH)3 precipitate, and a subsequent redox reaction occurs between Ag(I) and Ce(III), leading to the formation of Ag nanoparticles and Ce(OH)4 precipitate. To meet the requirements of decreased surface energies for structural stability, fine Ag nanoparticles begin to aggregate and grow quickly, as followed by a dehydration of Ce(OH)4 to form CeO2 that surrounds the Ag core.

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD pattern of sample Ag–CeO2-R. It is clear that all diffraction lines could be well indexed to a cubic fluorite structure of bulk CeO2 (JCPDS, No. 65–5923) mixed with a cubic phase for metal Ag (JCPDS, No. 65–2871). The constructing particles for each component CeO2 or Ag were small but with high crystallinity, as demonstrated by their broadened intense diffraction lines. The crystallite size for component Ag estimated using the Scherrer formula was 18.3 nm, almost three times larger than that of 6.2 nm for component CeO2. Further, these crystallite sizes were much smaller than the diameter (100–200 nm) for the uniform spheres observed by SEM (Fig. 2(a)). The atomic ratio of Ce to Ag was approximately equal to unity for these spheres (Fig. 2(d)). Therefore, Ag–CeO2-R appears to be in an assembled structure.

Microstructures for assembled Ag–CeO2-R spheres were further examined by HRTEM and EDX. As presented in Fig. 3(c), Ag–CeO2-R spheres were completely constructed from a distinct inner-core and outer-shell. The outer-shell was an assembly of 6 nm CeO2 particles. As demonstrated by HRTEM images in Fig. 3(a) and SAED results in Fig. 3(b), the lattice fringe for the outer-shell was 0.311 nm, exactly corresponding to the (111) plane of CeO2, while no lattice fringes were observed for metallic Ag. Further, the constructing particles for the outer-shell showed a dimension of about 6 nm, almost the same as that calculated by XRD. Therefore, the metallic Ag component for Ag–CeO2-R was wrapped by an assembled shell of CeO2. This conclusion is proved by chemical compositions mapped for the core–shell structures using EDX. As expected, element Ag was predominant in the inner-core. Oppositely, the outer-shell mainly contained Ce (Fig. 3(d)). To further confirm the core–shell structure, characterization of the interface between Ag and CeO2 is necessary. Here, a line-scan of the chemical compositions between the Ag core and CeO2 shell for an individual nanoparticle was performed using a 0.2 nm EDS probe (Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN 200KV FE TEM, operating in STEM mode). As indicated in Fig. 3(e), the Ce L-line indicated by a bimodal Ce distribution was observed to reach a maximum at the edge of the particle, while the Ag L-line shows a maximum Ag concentration at the center of the particle. These observations demonstrate that Ag–CeO2-R exhibited a core–shell structure, in which Ag acts as the core, while CeO2 is the shell.

Relative atomic compositions (vertical axis) of Ce (blue) and Ag (red) are plotted against the line-scan probe positions (horizontal axis) and are given next to the STEM image. 
Then, interfaces appeared in between the core Ag and the CeO2 shell. It is well established that the interfacial interactions are fundamentally important to exert a significant impact on catalytic properties.7,10 To optimize the interfacial interactions, sample Ag–CeO2-R was treated by hydrothermal reactions and air-annealing. As indicated in Fig. 1(b) and 1(c), phase compositions for Ag–CeO2-H and Ag–CeO2-A were the same as that for Ag–CeO2-R except for the slightly increased particle sizes for components Ag and CeO2. For instance, the crystallite size of CeO2 increased progressively from 6.2 nm in Ag–CeO2-R to 13.9 nm in Ag–CeO2-A (Table 1). Comparatively, Ag particles wrapped by ceria showed a relatively small change in crystallite size, such as from 18.3 to 23.0 nm. This observation appears to be quite different from conventional supported catalysts. For the latter case, noble metals are usually loaded onto the surfaces of supports, and the metal particles grow very fast during high-temperature annealing.15,16 One of the most likely reasons for the highly stabilized metallic Ag nanoparticles in the present samples is closely associated with the core–shell structure, since the outer shell CeO2 tremendously restrained the growth of core Ag particles. It should be noted that regardless of treatment, the shell CeO2 was porous and showed a pore distribution in a wide range from several nm to 110 nm (Figure S1†). As a result, the interfaces between the core Ag and shell CeO2 are fully accessible by gas molecules like O2 and CO. Further, the interfacial interactions between Ag and CeO2 particles were enhanced after thermal treatment for excellent catalytic properties, though similar core–shell spherical morphology and chemical compositions were retained (Fig. 2(b)–(c), Fig. 4).

3.2 Enhanced catalytic properties of core–shell structures
Catalytic activities of the samples were examined by measuring CO catalytic oxidation performance with a fixed-bed flow reactor. As displayed in Fig. 5(a), complete oxidation of CO was accomplished at 180 °C for Ag–CeO2-R, while pure CeO2 and Ag nanoparticles were almost catalytically inactive at this temperature. This observation indicates that the enhanced catalytic activity is a consequence of interfacial interactions between core Ag and shell CeO2 for Ag–CeO2-R. This catalytic activity was further improved after subsequent treatments. For instance, the temperature for complete oxidation decreased to 150 °C for Ag–CeO2-H and further down to 120 °C for Ag–CeO2-A, while at such a low temperature, Ag–CeO2-R has an extremely low conversion of CO. All these demonstrate a remarkable activity of Ag–CeO2-A. The activity sequence of Ag–CeO2 above is consistent with the trend of TOF values shown in Table 1.
 Fig. 5  (a) CO catalytic oxidation performance of the given samples relative to pure CeO2 and metallic Ag; and (b) reproducibility of catalytic activity for Ag–CeO2-A when running catalytic experiments for three times. Inset shows the long-term catalytic durability for Ag–CeO2-A at 110 °C (95% conversion) and 120 °C (100% conversion) for a period longer than 100 h. 
Further, the durability of the catalytic performance of Ag–CeO2-A was examined by repeating the catalytic experiments under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the catalytic performance of Ag–CeO2-A was reproducible for three runs, maintaining the complete conversion at 120 °C no matter the run sequence. More strikingly, the catalytic stability of Ag–CeO2-A was examined at the conversion rate of 95% and 100%, respectively. It can be observed in inset of Fig. 5(b) that sample Ag–CeO2-A did not show any sign of deactivation, even when the reaction time was beyond 100 h at 120 °C. This catalytic performance is promising, since it is superior to that of many noble-metal (e.g., Rh and Pt) loaded catalysts reported in the literature.7,17 For the latter cases, 5 wt% Ru/CNTs become deactivated towards catalytic CO oxidation when the catalytic reaction duration is longer than 100 h at 100 °C;7 Further, the lifetime for Pt-Ni-Mg/CNTs is only 50h at 100 °C, which is shortened to 20h at 250 °C for Pt-3Na/TiO2 or 20h at 300 °C for Pt/TiO2.14
The excellent durability and stability of catalytic performance may arise from the unique surface properties of the samples. FT–IR spectra were used to detect the surface information of the samples before and after catalytic stability tests. As indicated in Fig. 6, there are some apparent differences before and after the catalytic tests. For instance, a characteristic adsorption from carbonate species18,19 at 1385 cm−1 was observed before the catalyst tests, which is attributed to CO2 adsorption at the sample surfaces. Comparatively, the absorption band for carbonate species evidently decreased in intensity after heating to higher temperatures during the catalytic activity tests, which indicates the absence of any carbon species deposition. Moreover, it is evident that the intensity of carbonate species in the series IR spectra of samples Ag–CeO2 gradually decreased in a sequence of Ag–CeO2-R, Ag–CeO2-H, and Ag–CeO2-A, which indicates that thermal treatment may decrease the adsorption ability of CO2 for Ag–CeO2 samples. Therefore, the superior catalytic stability of Ag–CeO2-A may be closely related to the fast desorption of reaction products. Otherwise, carbon deposition will lead to partial deactivation with shortened catalytic lifetimes as observed by others.20

3.3 Strengthening the interfacial interactions for enhancing catalytic properties
The strengthened interfacial interactions between core Ag and shell CeO2 was confirmed by investigating the relationship between the surface area and the catalytic properties. As listed in Table 1, the surface area for Ag–CeO2-R was 21.28 m2 g−1, which decreased to 13.13 m2 g−1 for Ag–CeO2-H, and further down to 4.68 m2 g−1 for Ag–CeO2-A. Accordingly, the concentration of adsorption sites was reduced as indicated by the adsorption quantity of N2 (Figure S2†). These results are consistent with the adsorption quantity of CO2 as indicated by IR measurements, which probably shows that a large surface area is beneficial for adsorbing surface substances.
However, it is surprising that the sequence for surface area is opposite to that for catalytic activity, namely a decrease in complete CO conversion temperature from 180 °C for Ag–CeO2-R, to 150 °C for Ag–CeO2-H, and to 120 °C for Ag–CeO2-A. Thus, it is highly possible that the interfacial interactions became strengthened after treatment, since as for many other systems, smaller surface areas could not be expected to give a higher catalytic activity.
The strengthened interfacial interactions would give rise to an electronic transfer between core Ag and shell CeO2, pertinent to the catalytic performance. To prove this, chemical states for the samples were examined by XPS. Fig. 7 shows the XPS spectra of O2p and Ag3d for samples Ag–CeO2-R, Ag–CeO2-H, and Ag–CeO2-A. All XPS signals for cerium can be well assigned to Ce4+, while no signals for Ce3+ species are observed in Ce3d spectra (Figure S3†). On the other hand, XPS signals for O2p of samples Ag–CeO2-R, Ag–CeO2-H, and Ag–CeO2-A are quite similar to that for pure CeO2 (Figure S4†). Namely, all O2p core level spectra can be fitted in three symmetrical components: The first component centered at 528.94 eV is assigned to the bulk O2− in the CeO2 lattice; the second component at 530.55 eV could be associated with the hydroxyl groups absorbed on surfaces; and the third component at a higher binding energy of 532.47 eV most possibly originates from the O2− of CO32− adsorbed on surfaces, which reduces its intensity as the treatment temperature increases as proved by the IR results. Concerning the wrapped silver nanoparticles, as indicated in Fig. 7, the XPS signals of Ag 3d5/2 appeared at a binding energy of 368.2 eV with a splitting of about 6 eV for the 3d doublet.21 All these demonstrate the metallic nature of the silver core.
 Fig. 7  (a) O2p and (b) Ag3d XPS core level spectra for samples Ag–CeO2-R, Ag–CeO2-H, and Ag–CeO2-A. 
In spite of the fully oxidized Ce4+ and metallic nature of Ag, there might be electronic transfer in between core Ag and shell CeO2. To confirm this, the binding energy differences of metals (e.g., Ce or Ag) and O2− were calculated by subtracting the binding energy of O2p for bulk O2− of shell CeO2 from that of v(Ce4+) for Ce3d (Figure S3†), or subtracting the binding energy of Ag3d5/2 for core Ag from that of O2p for bulk O2− of shell CeO2. It was found that the binding energy difference of Ce4+ and O2− for Ag–CeO2-A was 352.61 (±0.01) eV, which is close to that of 352.67 (±0.01) eV for Ag–CeO2-R or Ag–CeO2-H. Comparatively, the binding energy difference of O2− and Ag for Ag–CeO2-A was 161.00 (±0.01) eV, about 0.1 eV smaller than that of 161.11 (±0.01) eV for Ag–CeO2-R or Ag–CeO2-H. This observation confirms the occurrence of a partial charge transfer between core Ag and shell CeO2 after annealing. Furthermore, Ag in Ag–CeO2-A is expected to be slightly positively charged as Agδ+, which may account for the strengthened interfacial interactions between Ag and CeO2. The interplay of partial charge transfer in Ag–CeO2-A may contribute to the catalytic activity.
The electronic transfer associated with the strengthened interfacial interactions would also be reflected by the reactivity. Here, all samples were comparatively studied by H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). As shown in Fig. 8, two broad TPR peaks were observed at 410 and 810 °C for pure CeO2, which can be attributed to the reduction of surface capping oxygen and bulk oxygen of ceria, respectively.22 When Ag nanoparticles were wrapped in CeO2 aggregates, the reduction peaks shifted towards lower temperatures.
 Fig. 8  H2-TPR data for (a) Ag–CeO2-A, (b) Ag–CeO2-H, (c) Ag–CeO2-R, and (d) pure-CeO2. 
For instance, as the treatment temperature increased, the reduction peak at 810 °C for bulk oxygen of CeO2 decreased steadily to show a lowest temperature of 766 °C for Ag–CeO2-A. It is also noted that the reduction signal appearing below 200 °C is broadened and asymmetric, which is attributed to the reduction of several forms of surface oxygen species. For Ag–CeO2-A, the component of the asymmetric reduction signal at 79 °C can be ascribed to O− or oxygen species reduced on nanodispersed silver,23,24 while the component reduced at 103 °C is assigned to the reduction of surface O2− of CeO2 interacting with silver. It should be pointed out that silver tremendously promotes to the reducibility of surface oxygen of CeO2, which is in good agreement with the fact that involvement of Ag increases the reducibility of CeO2 at low temperatures as reported elsewhere.25 Furthermore, the temperature of reduction peaks for surface oxygen species of Ag–CeO2-R was higher than those of Ag–CeO2-H and Ag–CeO2-A. Comparatively, Ag–CeO2-A showed the lowest reduction temperature for oxygen at 79 °C. Based on the literature reports for Au-loaded CeO2, the positions of the reduction peaks reflect different interaction degrees of the support with the metal: The higher the interaction, the lower the reduction temperature.26 It can be thus concluded that similar interactions could exist in the current Ag–CeO2 system. High temperature calcination strengthens the interfacial interactions between CeO2-shell and Ag-core, as just concluded by XPS analysis.
The consequence of strengthened interfacial interactions could be the generation of active oxygen species for catalytic reactions. EPR technique was used to examine the existence of active oxygen species in the samples. As shown in Fig. 9, no traces of Ce3+ were detected for all samples, because of the short spin–lattice relaxation time.27,28 Further, both Ag–CeO2-R and Ag–CeO2-H did not show any EPR signals for active oxygen species as that for pure-CeO2. Alternatively, Ag–CeO2-A exhibited multiple sets of signals that are characteristic of superoxide ions (O2−). This observation is quite similar to those for Ag-supported CeO2 reported in the literature,12,14,29,30 where adsorbed oxygen species on the Ag surface can migrate to the CeO2 surface via the Ag–CeO2 interface to form Onx− species after annealing,14 and the metallic Ag loading promotes the generation of superoxide ions.31,32 These superoxide species are molecularly adsorbed in a bent end-on geometry on silver surfaces and act as the key active species for enhanced catalytic reactions, just like what has been previously reported in catalytic epoxidation of ethelene.33
 Fig. 9  EPR spectra of the given samples: (a) Ag–CeO2-A, (b) Ag–CeO2-H, and (c) Ag–CeO2-R and (d) pure-CeO2. 
The key role of the silver surface is represented by its dual abilities: i) to increase the lattice oxygen mobility of CeO2 by producing a high concentration of structural defects for enhanced reducibility, as reported elsewhere for Ag-supported CeO234 and ii) to weaken the Ce–O bond located nearby and furthermore promote the exchange between lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen viaCeO − □ + O2 = CeO ← O⋯O = O − CeO2where □ represents the oxygen vacancy. The existence of vacancy oxygen would lead to the reduced surface of ceria, which promotes the activation of adsorbed oxygen to form superoxides even in the lattice, as proposed by Machida et al.29 As a result, superoxide species O2− was formed, along with various forms of oxygen, O2(gas) ⇔ O2(ad) ⇔ O2−(ad) ⇔ O−(ad) ⇔ O2−(ad) ⇔ O2−(lattice).
In addition, O− is also highly reactive, as concluded by Sberveglieri, Gopel and Maki-Jaskari et al.35–37 Based on TPR and EPR analysis, there exists an interfacial interaction between the Ag core and the ceria shell, which was strengthened by heat treatment to activate the absorbed oxygen on surfaces and to lower the oxygen splitting temperature. Therefore, the superior catalytic activity for Ag–CeO2-A can be well explained in terms of the activation of species O− and O2− that result from the strengthened interfacial interactions. All these indicate that interfacial interactions will play a key role in enhancing the catalytic performance and other functionalities when materials properties are tailored for many technological applications.
Although the complete conversion temperature for CO for our catalysts (120 °C) is still higher than those previously reported for other noble metal supported catalysts (e.g., 20 °C for Au/CeO2 and 100 °C for Ru/CNTs),37,9 our catalysts exhibited excellent long-term stability, which is promising for cleaning high temperature industrial exhaust gas. As indicated in Figure S5,† after staying in air for 10 months, the superior catalytic activity was still maintained, almost the same as that for the fresh catalyst Ag–CeO2-A. Comparatively, the catalytic activity for the well-known catalyst Au/CeO2 decreases significantly when in contact with air for 5 months, and the complete conversion temperature increases from 20 to 100 °C.38
4. Conclusion
Using a facile redox route, we successfully prepared Ag–ceria core–shell nanostructure. Through controlling the synthetic parameters, the interfacial interactions between the core Ag and the ceria shell were strengthened, which leads to oxygen activation and low-temperature spilling. As a result, the Ag–ceria core–shell nanostructure showed an excellent long-term catalytic performance towards CO oxidation at lower temperatures. We are aware that this work is among the few9 that have achieved complete conversion of CO in such a long catalytic period of time >100 h. We conclude that the superior stability for complete CO oxidation may be associated with the fast desorption of reaction products during the catalytic processes. It becomes clear that the methodology reported in this work (i.e., wrapping metals in oxide shells with tailored interfacial interactions) could offer more opportunities for investigating collective properties as well as open a door for many important technological applications.
