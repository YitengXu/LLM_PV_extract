    , Accepted 21st May 2022First published on 23rd May 2022AbstractThe solar selective absorber coating (SSAC), which can maximally harvest solar energy over a broad wavelength range with near-perfect spectral selectivity, is of essential importance for many applications especially the generation of solar-thermal electricity. Herein, inspired by the emerging field of high-entropy nanoceramics, we propose and numerically demonstrate a high-performance AlTiZrHfNbN-based SSAC. Enabled by the synergetic intrinsic absorption and destructive interference characteristics, the AlTiZrHfNbN-based coating demonstrates a high absorptance (α = 0.95) across an ultrabroad wavelength range of 300–3220 nm. Meanwhile, the coating possesses a low emittance (ε = 0.12, 82 °C) in the infrared region. Furthermore, the multilayer coating is stable at elevated temperatures, which shows promising solar-thermal conversion efficiency that enables it to reach 83.9% (C = 200, T = 600 °C). Upon further elevating the annealing temperature to 700 °C, obvious oxidation becomes the driving force for the attenuation of optical properties and changes in microscopic morphology. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) indicates that the physical mechanisms of ultrabroad wavelength absorption and degradation are related to a high density of hybrid cavity and surface plasmon polariton modes overlapped with the double-absorption layers, respectively. All these properties of the multilayer coating suggest its great promise for application in on-site solar-thermal utilization facilities.
Introduction
The efficient development and transformation of abundant solar energy are of theoretical and practical significance to respond to the growing global demand for inexhaustible and environmentally friendly energy. Solar selective absorber coatings (SSACs), with a major ambition to maximize solar absorptance (α) in the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) wavelength and minimize infrared thermal emittance (ε) in the infrared region, govern the key performance for efficient solar-thermal conversion. Since proposed by Tabor in the mid-1950s, various materials have been explored over the years to improve the efficiency of SSACs, including: (a) intrinsic absorber coatings,1,2 (b) semiconductor tandem coatings,3 (c) textured surfaces,4 (d) multilayer interference stacks,5 and (e) cermet absorber coatings.6 Among these coatings, metals such as stainless steel (SS), Cu, Ag, Al, and Ni are typically chosen as substrates based on their enhanced absorption in certain spectral wavelengths excited by the plasma frequency. The desired absorption wavelength can be tailored to the hybridization effect between the resonant characteristics of plasmon excitation caused by the coatings and the high reflectivity caused by the strong metal response originating from the substrates at the nonresonant frequency. However, the required absorption wavelength and the emergence of moderate-temperature (100–400 °C) and high-temperature (>400 °C) systems in recent years have created new challenges to the construction of high-temperature stable SSACs.
Recently, transition metal nitrides have been regarded as promising candidates for SSACs due to their intrinsic spectral selectivity. The optical properties of these compounds are superior to those of pure metals, which can be ascribed to the contribution of the interband transition of bound electrons to the dielectric function.7 For the spectral properties of metals, there is a steep drop in reflectance at the plasma frequency. However, in the case of transition metal nitrides, the reflectance drop is shifted towards short wavelengths due to the interband transition caused by photon excitation.8 Taking this into account, Diu et al. fabricated a Ti0.5Al0.5N/Ti0.25Al0.75N/AlN multilayer structure with an absorptance of 0.94 and emittance of 0.04.9 In Krishna's work, based on stainless steel (SS) and Cu substrates, TiAlCrN/TiAlN/AlSiN functional multilayer nitride coatings showed good spectral selectivity (α/ε = 0.91/0.07).10 Meng et al. reported multilayer Cu/Zr0.3Al0.7N/Zr0.2Al0.8N/Al34O60N6 SSACs with a high absorptance (α = 0.95), and a low thermal emittance (ε = 0.08). The coatings possessed good thermal stability at 400 °C for 192 h in a vacuum atmosphere.11 In terms of broadband efficient solar-thermal conversion, the bandwidth of conventional coatings is generally less than one octave (e.g. 400–700 nm or 800–1100 nm, 1.5–1.6 μm, 3–5 μm, 8–12 μm).12 Wu et al. exploited an ultrabroadband SSAC based on a W/SiO2 absorption layer with a high solar absorption value above 99% in the wavelength range of 435–1520 nm.13 The calculated solar-thermal conversion efficiency of the fabricated coating can reach 75.4% at an operating temperature of 1000 °C. All of these previous achievements highlight the critical need to find other potential candidates to provide more options in the field and to improve the optical performance of SSACs over a wide work temperature range.14,15
High-entropy nanoceramics, usually defined as ceramics with near molar ratios of at least five major cations or anions, have received extensive attention in recent years due to their potential multiple functions.14 Among these compounds, the discrepancy in atomic size of the constituent elements further contributes to the activation energy for grain growth, and the sluggish diffusion kinetics are responsible for its extremely high strength and structural stability when applied at high temperatures.16 In particular, coatings of high-entropy alloy nitrides (HEANs), such as (AlCrTaTiZr)N,17 (AlCrMnMoNiZrB)N18 and (NbTiAlSiZr)N,19 with good physicochemical properties originating from single solid-solution or nanocomposite structures (such as high hardness and wear resistance), are designed as protective hard coatings or thermoelectric materials at relatively high-temperatures.20 In addition, in our previous works, the optical properties of MoNbHfZrTiN and AlCrTaTiZrN in SSAC applications were investigated.21,22 The designed Al/MoNbHfZrTiN/MoNbHfZrTiON/SiO2 multilayer SSACs possess good spectral selectivity (α/ε = 0.94/0.09) with good thermal stability (α = 0.90, ε = 0.15) after annealing at 400 °C for 2 h. In view of such outstanding properties, we further fabricated SS/AlCrTaTiZrN(HMVF, high metal volume fraction)/AlCrTaTiZrN(LMVF, low metal volume fraction)/SiO2 SSACs combining optical fitting with experiments, which exhibit better thermal stability at 600 °C for 10 h in vacuum. These achievements indicate a promising method to increase the high-temperature optical performance of SSACs; however, broader studies need to be expanded based on the new strategy.
In this work, novel AlTiZrHfNbN-based SSACs with different metal volume fraction absorption layers were deposited by a reactive RF magnetron sputtering system. Moreover, an antireflection layer SiO2 is employed to further promote solar absorption by increasing incident light. Compared with previous designs, the coating has a good solar absorptance of 0.95 over an ultrabroad range of 300–3220 nm and a low emittance of 0.12. Further theoretical analyses reveal the establishment of the correlations between chemical composition, microstructure, and optical properties of the components. Investigations on thermals stability are systematically carried out based on the annealing process to explore its practical-service life, and the failure mechanism is evaluated. This strategy opens a new research perspective for the fabrication of high-temperature vacuum-stable SSACs.
Results and discussion
Optical properties and microstructure investigation of the as-deposited AlTiZrHfNbN-based SSACs
The AlTiZrHfNbN-based SSACs were fabricated onto mechanically polished glass, SS, and Si wafer substrates utilizing a commercial reactive RF magnetron sputtering system. A schematic illustration of the layer-added coating and a digital photograph of the as-deposited coating are shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. S1 (ESI†), respectively. The bluish-purple color represents the intrinsic color of the strong absorption coating, which is caused by the low reflectance and small reflective peak located in the visible light region. The typical triple-layer structure is designed with different metal volume fraction AlTiZrHfNbN HEAN layers that act as double intrinsic absorption layers, and SiO2 serves as an antireflection layer. Detailed experimental processes can be seen in the Supporting Information. It is worth noting that the metal volume fraction of the absorption layers is controlled by the gas flow rate and deposition time. To further optimize the absorption performances of the designed absorption layers, we first deposited a single AlTiZrHfNbN coating with different N2 flow rates on SS substrates. The optical reflectance of a series of SS/AlTiZrHfNbN coatings with different N2 gas flows is investigated (Fig. 1(b) and Table S4, ESI†). It can be noted that the spectral reflectance varies dramatically with the gas flow rate change, and the calculated absorptance shows the trend of reaching to the maximum value first and then slightly reducing. Based on the optimization results and interference-induced enhancement strategy, the N2 flow rates of 4 and 6 sccm are selected to prepare HMVF and LMVF layer, respectively. The transmittance spectra of layer-added absorption layers deposited on glass substrates are shown in Fig. 1(c), which confirms the good transparency of the double-absorption layers.

XRD analysis was carried out to determine the structure of the layer-added AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF)/AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF)/SiO2 stacks deposited on the SS substrate, which is indicated in Fig. 1(d). Broad hills rather than sharp peaks are observed, indicating the presence of amorphous structures. However, except for the peaks of the SS substrate, the peaks located at 2θ = 34.5°, 41.1°, and 59.5° are consistent with the AlTiZrHfNbN (111), AlTiZrHfNbN (200), and AlTiZrHfNbN (211) peaks of typical face-centered cubic (fcc) structures, indicating that the coating tends to form fcc-based and short-range-ordered structure (embedded in the amorphous matrix) during the deposition process.23 In addition, the diffraction peaks of the ultrathin SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF) film located at 43°, 50°, and 74° from the (111), (200), and (220) planes, confirm the presence of γ-Fe originating from the stainless steel substrate.24
The surface morphology of the SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF)/AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF)/SiO2 coating is illustrated in Fig. 1(e), which indicates a uniform floccus-like grained structure fabricated by the magnetron sputtering technique. The cross-section SEM topography in Fig. 1(f) exhibits a well-distinguished interface between the AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF) and SiO2 layers. The unrecognizable interface between the AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF) and AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF) layers is caused by the assemblable columnar structures.
It is noticeable that the thermal emittance is closely related to the working temperature (T), since the infrared radiation is proportional to T4. The reflectance spectra of the primary coating were measured at 82 °C. Compared with the blackbody (BB) at 82 °C, the BB at high temperature operating conditions (BB@727 °C, for example) shifts to a shorter wavelength, resulting in overlap with the solar spectrum (Fig. 2(a)). Taking Kirchhoff's law into consideration, an ideal absorber that can capture the solar energy completely is not available because the existence of overlap, but a sharp cut-off wavelength of the reflection spectrum is crucial to suppress heat emission. To evaluate the role of optical properties for each layer on the overall SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF)/AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF)/SiO2 SSACs, reflectance measurements associated with black-body (BB) radiation at 82 °C and 727 °C are carried out, and the calculated α and ε values are shown in Fig. 2(b) and listed in Table S5 (ESI†). Initially, the single SS substrate shows a high reflectance in the full spectrum, indicating metallic characteristics. The substrate contributes a weak absorptance (α = 0.27) and a low emittance (ε = 0.07), which also shows good infrared reflection characteristics. By adding the HMVF layer on top of the substrate, the reflectance dramatically decreases in the wavelength range of 300–3000 nm, which promotes the absorptance to 0.77, while the emittance also rises to 0.12. Considering the actual operating conditions, the calculated solar-thermal conversion efficiency ηsolar-th is 66.5% under 200 sun illumination at 727 °C. The HMVF layer acts as the main absorption layer, and the reflectance spectra show two reflectance minima (R = 0.15 located at 422 nm and R = 0.41 located at 1572 nm). To further improve the absorptance, a LMVF absorption layer is deposited on the SS/HMVF absorption coating. The SS/HMVF/LMVF coating exhibits an obvious extinction interference in the UV-vis-near IR region and further improves the solar absorptance to 0.83, with a slight variation in the emittance. The corresponding ηsolar-th promotes 68.6%. Meanwhile, the cut-off wavelength redshift is observed in the reflectance spectra, which results in a steeper reflectance transition in the VIS-IR wavelength range (1500–3000 nm). Eventually, after the incorporation of the SiO2 antireflection layer, the absorptance of the SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF)/AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF)/SiO2 SSACs increased to 0.95, emittance increased to 0.12, and the ηsolar-th of the as-deposited coating reached to 84.6%. Further addition of SiO2 on top of the SS/(HMVF)/(LMVF) absorber coating improves the absorptance over an ultrabroad wavelength range, which contributes to good spectral selectivity for the as-deposited coating. It is worth noting that, a good optical absorption for the original coating can be obtained at the ultrabroad range of 300–3220 nm, which is consistent with the near-perfect broad wavelength band absorption.13 Remarkably, in Fig. 2(c) and Table S6 (ESI†), both the absorptance and the operating wavelength range of the proposed SSAC are compared to those of recently reported high-performance SSACs, which exhibit relatively advanced optical properties.

The optical constants of the absorption layers are determined utilizing spectroscopic ellipsometry. For these measurements, single AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF) and AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF) coatings are deposited on the SS substrate. Fig. 3(a) shows the experimental ellipsometric angle Ψ and Δ of the SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF) coating along with the best fitted theoretical curve. The described Drude-type dispersion model is employed to theoretically fit the spectra. A rough thin layer is assumed to exist on the surface of the coating. The Drude-type dispersion model can be described as follows:37 (1)where, ε1, ε∞, ωP and ΓD correspond to the complex dielectric constant, the high-frequency component of the dielectric constant, the plasma frequency, and the damping factor, respectively.

(b) Variations of experimentally determined n and k derived from the best-fit structure of the single-layer AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF) coating. (c) Variations in experimental and theoretical ellipsometric Ψ and Δ versus wavelength for a single layer AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF) coating. (d) Variations in the experimentally determined n and k derived from the best-fit structure of the single-layer AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF) coating. 
Between the experimental and theoretical values, the squared difference (χ2) is less than 10, indicating a best-fit structure for the ellipsometric parameters of the AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF) layer. The variations in both the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) plotted with wavelength for the AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF) layer are presented in Fig. 3(b). The refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) which are calculated by ψ and Δ indicate the metallic characteristics of the AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF) layer A similar exercise along with the best fitted theoretical curve is also carried out to determine the optical constants of the SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF) coating, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The n and k values obtained from best-fit ψ and Δ are shown in Fig. 3(d). For the SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF) coating, the refractive index reaches the maximum value and decreases gradually with increasing wavelength. The k decreases monotonously with increasing wavelength. The transformation in the n and k values exhibits the dielectric nature of the single AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF) layer. Therefore, it can be observed that the increase in the N2 flow rate is conducive to the transition from metallic to dielectric properties for the AlTiZrHfNbN HEAN coating.
To further probe the microstructural details, the as-deposited coating is further examined by HRTEM. Fig. 4(a) shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the coating deposited on the Si substrate, indicating the typical three-layer structure of the as-deposited coating. Unlike SEM images, the interface can be revealed with ease, and the thickness of individual layers is corresponds to 113.4, 182.6, and 70.6 nm, respectively. No periodic lattice fringes can be observed in the HRTEM results of interlayer interfaces, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c), which indicates a mixed characteristic of the near-amorphous phase and nanocrystals. Meanwhile, it also follows the calculations from the relationship between ΔHmix and δ (Fig. S2, ESI†). Due to the similar microstructure of the absorption layers, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and corresponding magnified regions of the lattice fringes at the interface of the HMVF and LMVF layers are further determined by HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 4(d) and (e), three diffraction roles (r1, r2, r3) prove the formation of a single fcc solid solution phase with various crystal orientations, which are in accordance with the XRD analysis. Detailed information on the phase and d-spacing of the corresponding diffraction ring is shown in Table 1. This result shows that the high mixing entropy of the system leads to the formation of only one single phase. The large lattice constant of the AlTiZrHfNbN-based SSAC indicates that the mixing of more elements results in a larger volume of the unit cell, rather than belonging to the different single binary nitrides (Al, Ti, Zb, Hf, Nb) (Tables S7 and S8, ESI†).38,39 This result further confirms that the measured d-spacing can be assigned to the oriented HEAN phases and indicates the nature of polycrystalline compounds of the AlTiZrHfNbN-based SSACs.

The HAADF-STEM images and relevant EDS profile are shown in Fig. 4(f)–(g) and Table S9 (ESI†), which indicate an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of each element's content. The discrepancy in the net intensity is attributed to the sputtering threshold differences of the involved elements. As depicted in Fig. 4(h), Fig. 4(i1–8), and Fig S3 (ESI†), the elemental mappings illustrate that the involved elements, Al, Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, N, and Si, are uniformly dispersed on a macro level. By the way, it is worth noting that the oxygen atoms are distributed differently within the coating, which is due to the presence of residual O2 and H2O in the deposition chamber. The results indicate that the designed as-deposited coating consists well with the high-entropy nanoceramic definition.
Investigation of thermal stability
The SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF)/AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF)/SiO2 SSACs are deemed to be used in the high-temperature parabolic trough collector tube. To determine the thermal stability of the as-deposited coatings, these coatings are annealed at elevated temperatures for 10 h in a vacuum. The reflectance spectra and corresponding α and ε values before and after the annealing process are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), the reflectance slightly changes over the wavelength range from 0.3 μm to 1.2 μm with varying annealing temperature, which indicates that the as-deposited coating possesses good thermal stability. Meanwhile, the reflectance in the wavelength range of 1.2–3.2 μm increases, with a slight blueshift of the cut-off wavelength, which might be caused by the chemical changes in the absorption layers. After annealing at 600 °C for 10 h, it is worth noting that the samples still show a good spectral selectivity of 0.91/0.11, with a slight change in the reflectance, which indicates the potential of the coating for high-temperature applications. However, after annealing at 700 °C for 10 h, there is an obvious increase in the reflectance spectra in the wavelength range of 1.2–3.2 μm, and the cut-off wavelength shifts to a short wavelength, which gives rise to decreased absorptance in the UV-NIR region. The greatly undermined optical absorption (84.5%) demonstrates the degradation of the coating.

The calculated solar-thermal conversion efficiency η at different concentration ratios C and operating temperatures T for the (c) as-deposited and (d) annealed at 600 °C samples. 
As shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), the calculated ηsolar-th of the as-deposited coating as a function of operating temperature and incident (normal) irradiance is compared to the annealed coating at 600 °C. The designed AlTiZrHfNbN-based SSACs focused on high-temperature line-focus parabolic trough collectors (T = 727 °C, C = 200). The as-deposited and annealed coating at 600 °C offers a theoretical ηsolar-th as high as 84.6% and 83.9%, which is compatible with the application of in line-focus concentrators with large C values.40 Further evaluating the ηsolar-th of the coating annealed at 700 °C, as given in Fig. S4 (ESI†), significant degradation can be observed. Consequently, these facts underscore that our SSACs for concentrating solar power (CSP) systems provide a highly effective strategy to achieve efficient high-temperature near-perfect absorption at elevated temperatures.
The calculated ηsolar-th is effective not only for solar-thermal power generation but also for various antifreezing structures. The substrate temperature measurements for SS and the AlTiZrHfNbN-based coating were conducted under the illumination of 1 sun (1 kW m−2) provided by a solar simulator at room temperature (22 °C). Fig. S5(a) (ESI†) shows the illumination of a frozen layer partially covering the surface of the substrate and the coating with the same weight of approximately 1 g. It is worth noting that the ice freeze on the coating completely melts in 630 seconds compared to the SS substrate. Fig. S5(b) (ESI†) shows the temperature variations of the substrate background when exposed to the solar simulator. Under the same heating time scale, obvious temperature increases on the AlTiZrHfNbN-based coating can be observed (11.4 °C versus −4 °C). In practical applications, melting ice with a solar-thermal effect causes no damage to the multilayer structures compared with mechanical deicing methods.
In particular, the surface center temperature distribution during simulated solar irradiation for the as-deposited coating and after annealing at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C are recorded utilizing a thermal IR camera to further study their solar-thermal behavior, and representative images are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The room temperature without illumination varied between 26 and 29 °C. As seen in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the central temperature of the as-deposited and annealed at 500 °C and 600 °C coatings could reach near 40 °C quickly in only 5 min and achieved over 44.4 °C and 44.0 °C on equilibrium, indicating good solar-thermal performance. The surface temperature of the coating annealed at 700 °C is approximately 41.5 °C, which is associated with the degradation of the coating.
To determine the possible causal links for the variation in optical performance at high temperatures, intensive investigations in terms of the morphology and roughness of the as-deposited coatings and annealed at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C are carried out utilizing three-dimensional AFM topography. As shown in Fig. 6, all the coatings show significant changes in their surface morphology upon annealing. Compared to the as-deposited coating, the rapid growth of grains along with some agglomerations caused by the annealing process can be observed after annealing at 500 °C. However, when the temperature ranges to 600 °C, the initial ravine areas on the surface are gradually covered by rapidly growing fine particles. Eventually, after annealing at 700 °C, the fine particles are reserved but the size of the particles further decreases. During the annealing process, the aggregation and diffusion of metal atoms into the SiO2 layer will reduce the surface energy, thus relieving the thermal and surface tension of the interface.41 The latter is caused by the increase in annealing temperature. The variations in surface roughness and crystal size are shown in Fig. 7. For the coating annealed at 500 °C, the RMS roughness (Rq) decreases from 1.73 nm to 1.43 nm while the particle size increases from 93.7 nm to 194 nm. After annealing at 600 °C for 10 h, the roughness value increases to 1.72 nm while the particle size decreases to 71.6 nm. Promoting the annealing temperature to 700 °C, the roughness subsequently increases to 2.05 nm, and the maximum grain sizes gradually decrease to 51.9 nm, which is due to the grain refinement of the surface. Associated with the optical response (Fig. 5), the emittance of SSACs evolved with increasing roughness before the degradation of the coating further confirming that the emittance is a surface property closely related to the surface morphology of the coatings.42 Patterns of fine nanostructures, or subwavelength structures, produced by particle growth help trap light by multiple reflections. Meanwhile, it could result in a lower emittance of the incident radiation. However, since the annealing temperature is up to 700 °C, the accumulation of diffusion behavior also leads to the degradation of spectral selectivity for the coating.

To determine the performance degradation mechanism, we employed SEM, XRD, and Raman spectra to determine the crystal structure and phase changes in the coatings before and after annealing, as shown in Fig. 8. There is no difference in surface topography even when the temperature is increased to 700 °C, as given in Fig. 8(a)–(d), which indicates a stable structure. However, beyond that, the cross-section images of the coatings (Fig. 8(e)–(h)) show severe damage during the annealing process. In particular, when elevating the temperature up to 700 °C, a significant change in the thickness of the absorption layers can be observed (from 217.8 nm to 188 nm as measured in SEM cross-sections), with the columnar crystals of the absorption layer disappearing and the microstructure becoming denser. In conjunction with AFM analysis, it is reasonable to assume that this phenomenon is due to further agglomeration and diffusion of metal atoms.

(i) The evolution of XRD diffraction patterns and (j) Raman spectra of the SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF)/AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF)/SiO2 SSACs during the annealing process. 
In addition, a series of XRD results and Raman spectra were obtained and are shown in Fig. 8(i) and (j). As expected, no obvious diffraction peaks are observed except for the peaks of the SS substrate and AlTiZrHfNbN HEAN absorptance layers even after annealing at 600 °C for 10 h due to its stable polycrystalline nature. After the annealing process, the diffraction intensity of each peak owing to HEAN shows obvious damping, which may be due to the content of absorption phases being slightly reduced. The appearance of the peak shift conforms to the average atomic size change of alloys with high metal content (following Bragg's Law).23 However, for the sample annealed at 700 °C, an additional peak centred at 2θ = 35.5° is discernible, which is respectively assigned to the α-Al2O3 phase.43 Corresponding to the respective reflectance spectrum as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), it can be stated that the thermal-induced oxidation behavior may be the main reason resulting for the attenuation of optical properties for the SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF)/AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF)/SiO2 SSACs.
In the Raman spectra of Fig. 8(j), broadbands located at 200 cm−1 and 700 cm−1 are attributed to the metal atoms’ vibration around the N vacancy (longitudinal acoustic mode) and N atoms around the metal vacancy (longitudinal optical mode), respectively.44 After the annealing process, the sharper trend of those broad peaks indicates better crystallization of the coatings. It can be expected that no significant variation in Raman spectra can be observed even after annealing at 600 °C. Upon further elevating the annealing temperature to 700 °C, a new distinct Raman peak approximately emerges at 815 cm−1, which can be attributed to the Al2O3 phase.45,46 When annealed at 700 °C, the rough structure of the coating would accelerate the external oxygen diffusion in absorptance layers and eventually result in Al2O3 formation. It can be seen that the annealing temperatures have a significant effect on the morphology and phase change of the coating. These results obtained from AFM, SEM, XRD patterns, and Raman spectra are consistent with the optical response (Fig. 5).
In addition, using the required data of the elements given in Table S10 (ESI†), the parameters VEC, ΔHmix, ΔSmix, and δr were calculated and are given in Table S8 (ESI†). The high ΔHmix value of −147.06 kJ mol−1, δr of 25.55%, and ΔSmix of 14.22 J K−1 mol−1 confirm that there is no direct correlation between the mixing enthalpy, the mixing entropy, and the formation of the intermediate phase. At elevated temperatures, the high ΔSmix can significantly lower the Gibbs free energy, ΔGmix, which consequently provides a standard method to predict the thermodynamically stable phases in the absorption layers.47
Investigation of electromagnetic wave propagation
To further unravel the absorption mechanisms, we also investigate the electric field distribution for the as-deposited coating and after annealing at 700 °C for 10 h at distinct wavelengths. As shown in Fig. 9(a), at four different wavelengths of 432, 620, 1198 nm, and extensional 3220 nm, i.e., the locations of the four interference peaks (Fig. 5(a)), the as-deposited coating provides a strong electric field within the near-field around the air–SiO2 layer interface. In addition, an intensive electric field around the interface of the SS substrate and the HMVF layer can also be observed. These field localizations indicate that the surface plasmon is excited at these wavelengths, s48–50 The filling of the high-entropy nanoceramic in the absorption layer fundamentally redshifts the high-order cavity resonance frequencies, creating a high-density state in the visible region.51 This can be confirmed by the broader absorption wavelength of the SS/HMVF absorption spectrum compared to the SS/HMVF/LMVF coating in Fig. 2. In comparison, the electric field intensity profiles of the annealed coating at 700 °C are shown in Fig. 9(b), which has a poor electric field response over the UV-vis wavelength due to the degradation of the coating. As shown in Fig. 9(c) and (d), attributed to the plasmon response caused by the extinction coefficient (k) and the effect of the destructive interference, the absorption power is highly concentrated on the HMVF and LMVF absorption layers. Meanwhile, the interface of the SS substrate also shows slight solar absorption ability owing to the near-field enhancement. For the annealed coating at 700 °C, the poor absorption power distribution confirms an obvious degradation of the optical properties. These results further suggest that the synergetic degradation of intrinsic absorption (plasmon response), the destructive interference effect, and the near-field enhancement result in the degradation of the optical properties.

Conclusions
In this work, we have presented theoretical and experimental works of a scalable and highly-efficient solar selective absorber coating based on AlTiZrHfNbN HEAN for solar-thermal conversion at elevated temperatures. The fabricated SS/AlTiZrHfNbN(HMVF)/AlTiZrHfNbN(LMVF)/SiO2 SSACs demonstrate a high absorptance (α = 0.95) and a low emittance (ε = 0.12) over an ultrabroad wavelength range (300–3220 nm). The ellipsometric measurements confirm the intrinsic absorption characteristics of the AlTiZrHfNbN layers. The crystal structure of the as-deposited coating displays an amorphous characteristic combined with the nonuniform distribution of nanocrystals. The systematic investigation indicates high performances related to optical performance and thermal stability, which provide a high solar-thermal conversion efficiency (ηsolar-th = 83.9%) for C = 200 at 600 °C and ensure large-scale practical applications. XRD and Raman analysis indicate that the thermal-induced oxidation behavior detrimentally affects the optical properties. In addition, the numerical results indicate that the failure of the coating should be responsible for the synergetic degradation of intrinsic absorption (plasmon response), the interface interference effect, and the near-field enhancement. It is expected that the new strategy of high-temperature SSACs via high-entropy alloy nitrides, with ultrabroad wavelength strong spectral selectivity, would provide a guide to create a novel high-entropy nanoceramic base SSAC with stable optical behaviours for high-temperature solar-thermal harvesting.
