1. Introduction
Amidst the rapid growth in global economy and population explosion, the world now faces one of the greatest challenges to search for novel, sustainable and eco-friendly energy sources, since the unsustainable fossil fuels are becoming increasingly exhausted.1–4 In recent years, substantial efforts have been devoted to exploiting renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal energy.1–3 Although great progresses have been made, the geographically, seasonally and temporally unbalanced distributions of these renewable energy sources call for developing reliable, efficient and low-cost energy storage devices. In this concern, supercapacitors (SCs)4–9 with high power density and lithium ion batteries (LIBs)10–12 with superior energy density are currently considered to be two promising and complementary candidates as high-performance energy storage devices. Fig. 1a compares some significant parameters of different types of energy devices. As can be evinced, SCs always store several orders of magnitude higher energy densities than conventional capacitors. Meanwhile, substantially higher power densities are also achieved for SCs especially compared with LIBs,13 enabling their particular utilization in high power-demanding electronics. Moreover, the unique charge storage mechanism of SCs also endows them with fast charge/discharge ability and long-term endurance, which are hardly realized for batteries. All these features enable SCs to play an important and irreplaceable role among various energy storage devices.

In general, a SC device is constructed using two electrodes (anode and cathode), an electrolyte and a separator, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. SCs can be further categorized into electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors according to the different charge storage mechanisms of their electrodes.14–16 The capacitances of EDLCs arise from the electrostatic charge accumulation at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte, which is a purely physical process without faradaic redox reactions involved. Carbon materials, such as activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, are the most commonly employed electrode materials in EDLCs, owing to their low cost, high electrical conductivity and easily constructed porous structures. In contrast, the charge storage mechanisms of pseudocapacitors rely on fast and reversible oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions taking place at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Typically, metal oxides and conductive polymers are widely investigated as pseudocapacitive electrodes. It is worth noting that both mechanisms are interfacial phenomena, and can operate simultaneously if the electrodes are well-designed. On the other hand, the capacity of a bulk SC electrode is also restricted by these two mechanisms, owing to that only the surface part of the electrode materials is involved in the energy storage reactions. Hence, increasing the accessible surface area and electron transport efficiency would be the developing trend of SC electrodes.
Unfortunately, with increasing demand for the long endurance of electronic devices or vehicles, the relative low energy densities of SCs severely limit their practical applications as main power sources for those electronic devices. In this respect, boosting the energy densities of SCs without sacrificing the device power and working life is essential for enhancing their performance. The energy density (E) of a SC device can be calculated according to eqn (1): (1)where C is the capacitance of the whole device and V is the operation potential window of the SC device. Based on eqn (1), the enhancement of energy density can be realized through increasing C, V or both. As for the operation potential window of SCs, using organic or ionic liquid based electrolytes can provide SCs a much wider potential window (even up to 3 V) than that of SCs with aqueous electrolytes. But organic or ionic liquid based electrolytes can only suit carbon based electrodes or a small range of other electrodes. Meanwhile, they also suffer from high cost, low ionic conductivity, high toxicity, inflammability and other safety issues, which severely hinder their applications. Another promising approach is designing asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) with aqueous electrolytes. ASCs, also known as electrochemical hybrid supercapacitors, could take advantage of the different potential windows of cathodes (positive electrodes) and anodes (negative electrodes) to widen working potential windows (Fig. 2).17 Furthermore, to enhance the capacitance of the whole device, the general method is to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrodes through multi-strategies like constructing nano-sized structures, hybrid architectures, etc.18 In earlier years, researchers took massive efforts on the development of high-performance SC electrode materials. A large variety of methods were reported for preparing all kinds of electrode materials with different morphologies, such as MnOx, NiO/NiOH, CoOx, VOx, Ppy, PANI and so on.14 However, most of the achievements were made aiming at cathode materials; progress in anode materials is relatively slow, owing to which anodes fail to fulfill the demands of high energy compared to cathodes. Exploration of novel, state-of-the-art anode materials with high capacitance has been largely pursued. Over the past five years, considerable interest has gradually sparked in this issue. In this context, it is definitely the right time to review the recent progress in anodes in terms of their design, synthesis methods and applications in ASCs.

In this review, we briefly summarize the recent advances in various ASC anodes, including carbon based anodes, metal oxide anodes, metal nitride anodes and other novel anodes. The interest in carbon based anodes is mainly focused on the construction of hierarchical porous structures, doping of heteroatoms and introduction of other functional groups. In spite of the advancements achieved in the electrochemical performance, the specific capacitances of carbon based anodes are still relatively low due to the predominant energy storage mechanism of EDLCs. As for pseudocapacitive metal oxides, a large amount of effort was aimed at tackling their insufficient conductivities. Approaches like designing nanoarchitectures, introducing oxygen vacancies, and compositing metal oxides with highly conductive materials were developed and demonstrated to considerably boost their capacitive behaviors. Moreover, with the assistance of nanotechnologies and composite strategies, metal nitrides and other materials were also explored as good alternatives for ASC anodes. The synthesis strategies and capacitive behaviors of these anode materials are emphatically introduced. The merits and demerits of these anodes when applied in ASCs are also discussed. Finally, we propose the new trends and main challenges existing in the design of ASC anodes, which we hope will provide some inspiration for further advancing the development of ASCs.
2. Carbon based anodes
At the current stage of technology, the most prospective anode materials for industrialization are still carbon based materials due to their fascinating advantages such as abundant sources, low cost, light weight, non-toxic nature, and good electronic conductivity.19–21 The suitable electrolytes can be acidic (H2SO4), neutral (Na2SO4, LiCl), or alkaline (KOH). To avoid hydrogen evolution of aqueous electrolytes, neutral and alkaline electrolytes are preferred in most cases, which can push the hydrogen evolution potential to the more negative side. Limited to the EDLC storage mechanisms, the main direction for developing carbon based anodes is constructing nanostructured carbon with high surface areas and rich pores. In this regard, designing carbon based nanostructures becomes a new hot topic of research, considering their hierarchical porous channels created by structural interconnection. Furthermore, it has been reported that the electronic and electrochemical properties could be controllably modified through introducing heteroatoms or functional groups.22–24 These introduced elements can tune the free charge-carrier densities of carbon based materials, improve the electrical conductivities, and even introduce pseudocapacitance with specific functional groups.
Activated carbon (AC) materials are the most commonly applied carbon based materials in ASCs.25–53 However, most of the studies directly used commercial AC as the anode material without any treatment. To maintain charge balance between anodes and cathodes, relatively much larger amounts of AC were used when compared to cathode materials. To boost the electrochemical performance of AC, Kim et al.39 slightly oxidized AC through thermal treatment at a low temperature of 250 °C. They also assessed the influence of thermal treatment time on the electrochemical performance of AC, and found that the specific capacitance of AC after 6 h thermal treatment achieved an enhancement of about 37% at 10 mV s−1. The improvement was believed to be related to the introduction of a large number of oxygen functional groups, which was confirmed from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. They also assembled an ASC device using SiC/MnO2 as the cathode and 1 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte. The optimized device achieved a specific capacitance of 59.9 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 and an outstanding energy density of 30.06 W h kg−1. In order to assemble flexible ASCs, AC was also blended with CNTs28 and graphene,53 fabricating carbon based anodes with high mechanical strength.
However, due to the fact that AC materials usually consist of micro-sized or much larger particles, their specific capacitances are always restricted by their low specific surface areas. By contrast, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a unique open tubular porous structure, rendering them good alternatives for electrode materials.54–64 Strategies like nitrogen doping56,59 and functionalization54,56,60 were applied to boost the specific capacitance of CNTs. Li with his group54,56 reported a novel kind of functional CNTs using poly-dopamine as the precursor and ZnO nanorods as the template, which contained abundant N- and O-functional groups. When they were used as anodes for assembling ASC devices, the devices exhibited an operating cell potential of 2 V in an aqueous electrolyte. The maximum energy density reached 47.4 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 200 W kg−1.
In spite of their fascinating properties, the high production cost of CNTs is still a severe limitation to their wide application. By contrast, graphene, made up of a one-atom-thick 2D layer of sp2-bonded carbon, could be economically produced through exfoliation of graphite based materials.65,66 Not only that, graphene based materials also offer excellent electron mobility, good mechanical strength and large accessible surface area (2600 m2 g−1). All these features promote the fast development of graphene in a large variety of applications, of course including ASC anodes.67–79 For instance, Wu et al.80 directly used freeze-dried graphene as an ASC anode. The specific capacitance of such a graphene electrode reached 281 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Zilong et al.79 coated graphene on carbon cloth through a dropping method, which was demonstrated to be an effective anode with high flexibility. They also assembled a solid-state ASC device with a MnO2@ZnO electrode as the cathode, delivering a high energy density of 0.234 mW h cm−3.
One of the general construction methods of graphene based anodes is directly fabricating graphene film through vacuum filtration with the assistance of membrane filters.53,81–84 As an example, Yang's group85 used such a kind of graphene film as the anode to assemble an ASC device with a MnOx/Au cathode, showing a remarkable cell capacitance of 108.5 F g−1 and energy density of 46.8 W h kg−1 at 1 A g−1. To further enhance the mechanical properties, Alshareef et al. attached the obtained graphene film to carbon cloth, functioning as the anode for an ASC, while they employed a Ni–Co–S nanosheets electrode as the cathode. The ASC device presented a high energy density of 60 W h kg−1 at a power of 1.8 kW kg−1, which was calculated under a fast charge rate of only 248 seconds. Meanwhile, 90.1% capacitance of the ASC device was retained after 10000 charge–discharge cycles, indicating its superior long-term stability. However, the main issue encountered during this process was the aggregation or restacking of the single graphene layer into a graphitic structure, which was a result of the strong π–π stacking interaction and van der Waals attraction among their basal planes. To address this issue, insertion of spacers between the graphene sheets in their structural design was attempted. CNTs are such a good choice for this purpose.55,57,61–64 For instance, Li et al.57 synthesized a kind of graphene@carbon nanotube freestanding hybrid film (GTF) as shown in Fig. 3a. The CNTs function as a conductive backbone to intercalate into the graphene nanosheets, which not only provide a robust network to facilitate the charge transport, but also efficiently prevent the restacking process of graphene. Uniform distribution of CNTs between the graphene layers is clearly revealed from the SEM image in Fig. 3b. As expected, the GTF electrode in 1 M KOH electrolyte showed approximately rectangular shapes in the potential window ranging from −1.0–0 V (Fig. 3c), indicating its ideal EDLC charge storage behavior. Additionally, the good mechanical properties of free-standing GTF provide great promise in assembling solid-state flexible ASC devices. The as-fabricated ASC device based on the as-prepared GTF as the anode and graphene@Ni(OH)2 (GNiF) as the cathode delivered an outstanding volumetric capacitance of 58.5 F cm−3 at a discharge current density of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 3d). Moreover, high electrochemical stability was maintained when the device was under different bending conditions as shown in Fig. 3e. Besides flexible films, CNTs/graphene hybrid anodes were also prepared in the form of fiber62 and foam.63

In addition, 3D porous graphene architectures can be easily obtained through a facile hydrothermal method with graphene or graphite oxide aqueous solution as the precursor.87–89 Such a porous structure would provide a more accessible surface area for active sites, thus greatly enhancing the electrochemical performance. It was also reported that reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was fabricated on the surface of nickel foam by applying a similar hydrothermal method.86,90,91 Most recently, Yu et al.86 tried to assemble an ASC device with this RGO anode and activated nickel foam cathode. As shown in Fig. 4a, aggregates of graphene cover the surface of nickel foam, appearing black. The as-prepared graphene electrode exhibited a good capacitive behavior in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with a potential range of −0.8–0 V, as indicated by its rectangular CV curves (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4c illustrates the CV curves of the ASC device obtained at 50 mV s−1 with different voltage ranges. It can be observed that the ASC can reach a stable potential window of 1.5 V. Furthermore, an outstanding energy density of 1.06 mW h cm−3 was delivered, which was much higher than most of the other ASCs with larger operation windows (Fig. 4d). Besides nickel foam, other micro-scale templates were also utilized to construct the 3D porous structure of graphene based materials. For example, Yan et al.92 constructed a kind of porous graphene electrode using a CVD approach with MgO as the template. Fig. 5a and b present the TEM images of porous graphene. Numerous wrinkled and folded regions can be observed on the sheets, which are believed to benefit its charge storage ability. Under a potential range of −1–0 V, the graphene electrode achieved a high specific capacitance of 245 F g−1 at a discharge current density of 1 A g−1. Huh with his group93 reported a kind of 3D macroporous graphene film (denoted as e-CMG) with the assistance of polystyrene (PS) templates. After removing PS particles, an open porous structure was left without structural collapse (Fig. 5c and d). The e-CMG film was directly used as an ASC anode to couple with a MnO2@e-CMG cathode. Consequently, the maximum energy density of the as-assembled device reached 44 W h kg−1. More importantly, compared with nickel foam, MgO and PS particles are much easier to remove.

Besides the use of graphene based materials, template-assisted methods were also reported for the preparation of other kinds of carbon based materials with high specific surface areas.94–96 Zhao's group96 fabricated a kind of graphitic carbon spheres with the assistance of silica spheres. They synthesized hollow carbon spheres through a chemical vapor deposition method. Ferrocene was employed as the carbon source. When the hollow carbon spheres were used as the anode to assemble an ASC, the obtained ASC device achieved a maximum energy density of 22.1 W h kg−1 with a wide potential range of 2.0 V. Besides zero dimensional spheres, one dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanorods were demonstrated to be superior templates as well. In 2012, Lu et al.94 reported a kind of 1D amorphous carbon anodes using hydrogenated TiO2 nanowires as templates (denoted as H-TiO2@C). As clearly revealed from the TEM image (Fig. 6a), a thin layer of amorphous carbon with a uniform thickness of 18.1 nm was coated on the surface of H-TiO2 nanowire via a combinative method of hydrothermal process and thermal treatment. Interestingly, with a neutral electrolyte solution of 5 M LiCl, the H-TiO2@C electrode achieved a high specific capacitance of 253.4 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1 within the potential range of −1–0 V, much higher than the pristine C electrode (162.2 F g−1) and TiO2@C electrode (197.1 F g−1), as shown in Fig. 6b. Furthermore, they designed a flexible solid-state ASC device by using a H-TiO2@C electrode as the anode, a H-TiO2@MnO2 electrode as the cathode and a PVA/LiCl gel as a polymer electrolyte. The assembled H-TiO2@C//H-TiO2@MnO2-ASC device was able to operate in a wide voltage window range of 0–1.8 V (Fig. 6c). Indeed, the energy density of the as-fabricated solid-state ASC device reached 0.30 mW h cm−3 (59 W h kg−1, based on the mass of active materials) at a discharge current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6d).

Carbon based anodes derived from carbonaceous compounds are also attracting increasing attention since they always inherit the hierarchical porous structure of the original precursor. Meanwhile, some heteroatoms, such as N, can be preserved after carbonization, and could boost the electronic conductivity of the carbon materials.97–100 To date, a large variety of research studies have been conducted with various precursors, including cotton,101 bacterial cellulose,98 protein,97 polyaniline,99,100artemia cyst shell102 and so on. As a typical example, Mitlin with coauthors97 used egg white as the precursor to derive mesoporous carbon (PMC) with the assistance of mesoporous cellular foam silica. Fig. 7a presents the TEM image of the obtained PMC with a pyrolysis temperature of 850 °C. It can be clearly observed that one thin PMC fragment is composed of well-distributed large mesopores with diameters of 20–30 nm. Pore size distribution analysis reveals a sharp peak in the pore diameters centered at 3.8 nm, which is in great accordance with the mesoporous cellular foam silica template (Fig. 7b). Moreover, the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectra demonstrated a rich content of pyridine-N for PMC samples, which was proved to have a significant effect on the electrochemical performance of PMC samples (Fig. 7c). As expected, the PMC sample fabricated at a pyrolysis temperature of 650 °C achieved the best capacitive behavior in 1 M H2SO4 among all the PMC samples. The highest specific capacitance of the PMC-650 electrode reached 390.4 F g−1 at a discharge current density of 0.25 A g−1. Meanwhile, the PMC-650 electrode also showed excellent electrochemical performance with less than 7% capacitance loss after 10000 charge/discharge cycles.

Reproduced from ref. 97. 
In recent years, carbon cloth (CC) has widely been utilized, especially in the construction of flexible electrodes to meet the demand of wearable electronic devices. CC is composed of woven carbon microfibers, which afford excellent conductivity and superior mechanical strength. Thereby, it can function well as a flexible support/current collector to other electrode materials. More interestingly, CC itself is a promising carbon based electrode if it is strategically modified and activated. Attempts have been made to investigate the direct use of CC as a capacitive electrode, such as chemical exfoliation104 and electrochemical modification.103 Wang et al.103 recently developed a high-efficient electrochemical oxidation method to successfully activate CC and demonstrated its superior anode performance for high-energy ASCs. The schematic diagram for the preparation process of electrochemically activated CC (EACC) is shown in Fig. 8a, which was conducted in a mixed HNO3–H2SO4 solution at a constant voltage of 3 V. Significantly, compared with the traditional activation method of carbon materials (chemical or thermal activation), this method was very simple, low-cost, eco-friendly and convenient for large-scale fabrication. As a result, abundant oxygen-containing groups were introduced onto the surface of carbon fiber after the facile electrochemical oxidation, accompanying the formation of an amorphous shell (Fig. 8b). Attributing to such fascinating features, the EACC electrode exhibited a substantially larger capacitive current density than the untreated CC electrode in 5 M LiCl aqueous solution (Fig. 8c). A remarkable areal capacitance of 756 mF cm−2 was achieved in the potential window ranging from −1–0 V at 6 mA cm−2, which is more than three orders of magnitude enhancement over the untreated CC. Furthermore, a high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device was also demonstrated based on the as-prepared EACC as the anode and a MnO2@TiN electrode as the cathode. When the device was charged to 2 V, the potential distribution for the anode and cathode was in good agreement with their working voltage, demonstrating the suitable working window of 0–2 V (Fig. 8d). Operating under such a wide potential range, the as-fabricated ASC device delivered a remarkable energy density of 1.5 mW h cm−3 and super-long cyclic durability without any decrease of its capacitive performance even after 70000 cycles. Table 1 summarizes the capacitive properties of the recently developed carbon based anodes and the corresponding ASC devices.

3. Metal oxide based anodes
Unlike carbon based anodes, the capacitance of metal oxides mainly depends on pseudocapacitance, which means that metal oxides generally undergo faradaic redox reactions during charge/discharge processes. These electrochemical processes can take place even in the bulk near the electrode surface, endowing metal oxide based anodes with far larger capacitances in comparison with carbon based anodes, thereby considerable energy densities. Nevertheless, they have a key drawback of poor conductivity, which leads to poor rate capabilities and low power densities. In recent years, tackling this issue has become a frequent topic and resulted in extensive investigation. Developing small-scale architectures with high specific surface areas and compositing metal oxides with other highly conductive materials have proven to be two effective strategies to improve the capacitive performance of metal oxide anodes. Thanks to the great progress in nanoscience and nanotechnology, metal oxides with a large variety of nano-sized morphologies were designed, which offer significant improvement in terms of the utilization of metal oxides and the shortening of the transport path for ions and electrons. Likewise, hybrid anodes constructed by integrating metal oxides with other highly conductive materials can exhibit synergistic properties, and are able to fulfill different demands, e.g. high conductivity and high energy density.
Among various metal oxides, iron oxides hold great promise as anodes for ASCs due to their remarkable advantages of low cost, earth-abundance, being environmentally friendly, high specifc capacitance and suitable negative working potential windows. Because iron oxides are unstable in acidic solution, the electrolytes generally chosen are neutral (like LiCl, Na2SO4) or alkaline solutions (like KOH, LiOH). As mentioned above, the capacitive performance of iron oxides, especially the rate capability and power density, is severely restricted by their poor conductivities (e.g. 10−14 S cm−1 for α-Fe2O3).105,106 To decrease the diffusion length of ions and charges, and increase the accessible area to the electrolyte, iron oxides were designed with all kinds of morphologies, such as quantum dots,107 nanoparticles,108–110 nanorods,105,106,111 nanotubes,112 and nanosheets.113,114 For example, Yang et al.112 prepared Fe2O3 nanotubes on a carbon cloth substrate with the assistance of a ZnO nanorod template, considerably increasing the active sites of the anode. The as-assembled solid-state ASC device with a MnO2 nanorod cathode and Fe2O3 nanotube anode presented a high energy density of 0.55 mW h cm−3. In addition, the electronic conductivities of iron oxide based anodes were improved using a combination approach with highly conductive materials. These materials were mainly carbon materials and conductive polymers like CNTs,108,110 graphene,107,109,113 polyaniline (PANI)111 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).106 For instance, Guan et al.110 synthesized CNTs on graphite foam to function as a current collector, then Fe2O3 nanoparticles were decorated into CNTs through an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. The optimized anodes exhibited an ultrahigh areal capacitance of about 680 mF cm−2.
Despite these achievements, it is still necessary to enhance the electrochemical performance of ASCs from the aspect of improving the intrinsic electronic conductivity of iron oxides. Most recently, Lu et al. reported a simple and effective approach to dramatically enhance the energy density and power density of Fe2O3 nanorod anodes by introducing oxygen defects105 and Ti-doping.106 Fe2O3 nanorods with enriched oxygen vacancies were easily obtained by annealing akaganeite under a no-oxygen environment (denoted as N-Fe2O3). From the HRTEM image in Fig. 9a, it can be seen that numerous planar defects (stacking faults) corresponding to oxygen vacancies are present in the N-Fe2O3 nanorods. For comparison, pristine hematite nanorods were also prepared by annealing akaganeite in air (denoted as A-Fe2O3). As shown in their O 1s XPS spectra, the peak centered at 531.8 eV for A-Fe2O3 appears with a much lower intensity than that of N-Fe2O3, further implying the presence of more oxygen defects in the N-Fe2O3 sample. The electrochemical properties of N-Fe2O3 were assessed in a neutral electrolyte such as 5 M LiCl with a negative potential window ranging from −1 to 0 V. The smaller IR drop and much longer discharge time of the N-Fe2O3 electrode revealed that the introduction of these defects can not only improve the conductivity of Fe2O3, but also boost its energy storage ability (Fig. 9c). Finally, the N-Fe2O3 anode was further used to assemble an ASC device with a MnO2 cathode. The triangular shapes of the charge/discharge curves for the ASC device showed its superior capacitive properties. A large volumetric capacitance of 1.21 F cm−3 was reached, corresponding to an excellent energy density of 0.41 mW h cm−3. Inspired by this work, the authors further designed a new kind of Fe2O3-based anode based on a Ti-doped Fe2O3 core and highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) shell.106 In comparison with the thermal treatment in the no-oxygen atmosphere to introduce oxygen vacancy, Ti-doping realized through tuning the precursor solution by a hydrothermal process was more facile and easy to achieve. Such unique core–shell architectures can offer high electrical conductivity of the overall electrode for charge transport, a large interface area for reaction, and numerous channels for rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions within the electrode, which enable the designed Ti-Fe2O3@PEDOT electrode to exhibit superior capacitive performances. The as-prepared Ti-Fe2O3@PEDOT core–shell electrode showed a remarkably high areal capacitance of 1.15 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 with outstanding rate capability and ultrahigh cycling durability. Based on the Ti-Fe2O3@PEDOT electrode as the anode, a flexible high-performance ASC device with a higher energy density of 0.89 mW h cm−3 was achieved.

Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) was also widely investigated as an anode material due to its high theoretical specific capacity of about 1111 mA h g−1, and layered structure benefiting the insertion/removal of small ions in electrolytes.115–119 The electrolytes employed include Na2SO4, Li2SO4, and H2SO4. To overcome its low conductivity and increase the specific surface area, Zhou's group116 utilized tungsten oxide (WO3−x) nanowires as scaffolds to load MoO3−x. The WO3−x@MoO3−x core–shell electrodes delivered the highest areal capacitance of 500 mF cm−2 at a discharge current density of 2 mA cm−2. They also fabricated an ASC device using a WO3−x@MoO3−x anode and PANI cathode, which exhibited a good energy density of 1.9 mW h cm−3. Moreover, Chang et al.115 reported improved electrochemical performance of MoO3 based anodes through self-assembled composites with reduced graphene oxide (denoted as GrMoO3). The TEM image in Fig. 10a clearly demonstrates that MoO3 nanosheets are uniformly distributed on the graphene layer. The GrMoO3 composite electrode achieved remarkably higher electrochemical performance in 1 M Na2SO4 than the pure MoO3 electrode (Fig. 10b). Its specific capacitance reached 291 F g−1 with a potential range of −1.0 to −0.1 V at 2 mV s−1, while a specific capacitance of only 226 F g−1 could be achieved for the pure MoO3 electrode. A similar approach was employed to improve the MnO2 cathode. Both the conductivity and capacitance for the MnO2 electrode were improved after combining with reduced graphene oxides. The ASC device assembled by these two electrodes was able to deliver a high specific capacitance of 307 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, a large energy density of 42.6 W h kg−1 as well as good cycling stability without any capacitance decay after 1000 cycles.

In addition to Fe2O3 and MoO3, other metal oxides including stannum oxides,121 tungsten oxides,122 manganese oxides,123 indium oxides,124 and bismuth oxides125 have been recently explored as anode materials for ASCs. In the early years, a nanocomposite of SnO2 and CNTs was synthesized and tested as an ASC anode.121 At a discharge current of 0.17 mA, the CNTs/SnO2 anode delivered a specific capacitance of 113.7 F g−1 in a neutral electrolyte such as 2 M KCl at a potential range of −0.8–0 V. Then the authors coupled the CNTs/SnO2 anode with a CNTs/MnO2 cathode and fabricated an ASC device, which was an early study on aqueous ASCs. A wide working potential of 1.7 V was achieved for the device, and a maximum energy density of 20.3 W h kg−1 was delivered. Chang et al.122 synthesized a high-rated WO3/WO3·0.5H2O anode using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal strategy. Within the potential range was between −0.6 and 0.2 V, the specific capacitance of the anode reached about 300 F g−1 at a low scan rate of 25 mV s−1. When the scan rate rose to 200 mV s−1, the capacitance retention was still 60%, implying its promising rate capability. However, the electrochemical stability of the WO3–WO3·0.5H2O anode was unsatisfactory, and up to 28% capacitance loss was observed after only 100 cycles. Moreover, due to the existence of low-valence-state Mn (Mn2+), Mn3O4 was anticipated to undergo a reversible redox reaction within a negative potential range. Li's group123 deposited amorphous Mn3O4 on conducting paper through a facile electrodeposition method. The amorphous Mn3O4 was demonstrated to show a high specific capacitance of 432 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in 1 M NaOH at a negative potential range of −0.8–0 V. However, the main problem in this case was the poor coulombic efficiency of Mn3O4 reflected by its irregular CV shapes. The authors also assembled a flexible solid-state ASC device with a Ni(OH)2 cathode, exhibiting a decent energy density of 0.35 mW h cm−3. Besides, In2O3 was composited with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by Zhou and his group.124 Such a composited anode could also have a suitable negative potential range of −0.6–0.2 V with a good specific capacitance of 201 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. A similar MnO2 based composited cathode was fabricated and used to assemble an ASC device, the potential range of which was even extended to 2.0 V. The calculated specific capacitance of the device reached 184 F g−1, corresponding to an outstanding energy density of 25.5 W h kg−1 and a power density of 50.3 kW kg−1. Recently, a promising application of Bi2O3 as a high-performance anode for ASCs was also demonstrated by Huang's group.125 Typically, Bi2O3 possesses a high theoretical specific capacitance of more than 1300 F g−1, suitable negative working potential window and superior electrochemical stability. To overcome the intrinsically poor electrical conductivity of Bi2O3, lightweight carbon nanofibers were employed as a support to load Bi2O3. Impressively, the electrode permitted a large mass loading of 9 mg cm−2, which means that about 85 wt% of the entire electrode was active Bi2O3. With such a high mass loading, the electrode exhibited a fascinating areal capacitance of 545 mF cm−2 when charged and discharged at 3 mA cm−2 within the potential range of −0.9–0 V. Moreover, the ASC device assembled with the Bi2O3 anode and MnO2 cathode delivered a maximum energy density of 43.4 μW h cm−2. Although reports on these metal oxides are not available in plenty, they still have great potential as high-performance anodes because they could undergo redox reactions within suitable negative potential windows due to their multi-valence nature.
Another example is vanadium oxide.120,126,127 Actually, various kinds of vanadium oxides were demonstrated as excellent cathode materials for SCs,128–131 but less attention has been paid to their anodic performance. Recently, Zhai et al.120 successfully expanded the potential window of vanadium oxides to negative potentials by introducing the low valence state of V3+ into vanadium oxide, based on the fact that the redox potential of V4+/V3+ is more negative than that of V5+/V4+. They directly annealed V3O7 nanowires in a nitrogen atmosphere in the presence of sulfur vapor to form sulfur-doped V6O13−x (denoted as VOS). The EELS mapping images (Fig. 11a) clearly reveal that sulfur was uniformly doped into the VOS nanowires. For better understanding, a CV test in a potential range of −1–0 V at a slow rate and real-time XPS detection were conducted to study the pseudocapacitive behavior of the VOS electrode. The charge-storage mechanism was identified to include two reversible redox reactions, V4+/V3+ and V5+/V4+ (Fig. 11b). Hence, V3+ plays a significant role in the working of the VOS electrode in the negative potentials due to the relatively negative potential of the V4+/V3+ redox reaction. In addition, the authors also demonstrated that sulfur doping could prominently boost the capacitive behavior through improving the electrical conductivity and Li ion diffusion efficiency in V6O13. Consequently, the VOS electrode exhibited an outstanding gravimetric capacitance of 1350 F g−1 and a corresponding areal capacitance of 0.72 F cm−2 at 1.9 A g−1. These values are pretty high among all the reported anodes, offering a great opportunity to further assemble ASC devices with attracting energy densities. In their case, a MnO2/graphene electrode was taken as the cathode. Superior capacitive properties with a fast and reversible charge–discharge ability were achieved for the as-assembled ASC device in the voltage window of 1.8 V (Fig. 11c). The device could deliver a maximum volumetric capacitance of about 1.9 F cm−3 at 1 mA cm−2, resulting in an excellent volumetric energy density of 0.87 mW h cm−3 (Fig. 11d). Although investigations on these metal oxides are still insufficient, it is believed that these pioneering studies provide an important insight into and inspiration for the construction of metal oxide based anodes. The capacitive properties of metal oxide based anodes and the corresponding ASC devices are summarized in Table 2.

4. Metal nitride based anodes
Metal nitrides are emerging as a kind of promising anode materials in ASCs, owing to their outstanding electrical conductivities (4000–55500 S cm−1), substantially higher than most of the metal oxides.10 Their good conductivities could ensure a high power output, when they are used as anodes to assemble ASCs. At the same time, owing to the multi-valence nature of transition metals, these metal nitrides as anodes can take advantage of of the pseudocapacitance produced by the reversible redox reaction, which endows them with a high capacitance even comparable to those of most of the metal oxides, and thus sufficient energy density for the assembled ASCs. Hence, high-performance metal nitride anodes hold great promise for simultaneously boosting the power and energy densities of ASCs. Most of the metal nitride based anodes were evaluated in alkaline electrolytes, generally KOH solution; meanwhile, neutral solutions, like LiCl aqueous solution, were also employed to evaluate their performance. Unfortunately, one severe drawback of some metal nitrides is their poor electrochemical stability.128,132–134 For example, it was reported that a TiN electrode in alkaline electrolyte solution could only retain 28% of its initial capacitance after only 400 cycles.134 Previous studies also confirmed that the unstable electrochemical properties mainly arise due to the irreversible oxidation reactions.128,132,133
To date, a variety of research studies have demonstrated the use of various transition metal nitrides in ASC anodes, such as titanium nitride (TiN),132–137 vanadium nitride (VN),128,133,136–143 molybdenum nitride (MoN),144,145 and tungsten oxynitride (WON).146 Among them, TiN with superior electronic conductivity and mechanical stability has widely been explored as an ASC anode. Particularly, due to the availability of mature preparation technology for 1D nano-sized TiO2, 1D nano-sized TiN can be obtained through a simple thermal treatment under an ammonia atmosphere. To reveal the unstable nature of TiN, Lu et al.132 studied in detail the morphological and componential evolution of TiN NWs prepared at 800 °C in NH3 (denoted as TiN-800) during the cycling process by XPS and SEM analyses. In accordance with other reported results,134,136,137 poor electrochemical stability was observed for the obtained TiN samples. Only a low capacitance retention of 18.6% was observed for TiN-800 after 5000 charge/discharge cycles in 1 M KOH (Fig. 12a). Subsequently, XPS measurements were employed to understand the modification of chemical composition during the long term charge/discharge process. As revealed by Ti2p core level XPS spectra (Fig. 12b), the Ti–N–O peaks decrease continuously with increasing number of cycles, while the Ti–O peak intensity increases. This result reflects the instability of TiN and can be attributed to the irreversible oxidation reaction in aqueous solution:TiN + 2H2O → TiO2 + 1/2N2 + 4H+ + 4e−
 Fig. 12  (a) Cycle performance of TiO2 and TiN electrodes investigated at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for 5000 cycles. (b) Core level Ti2p XPS spectra obtained for the TiN-800 electrode at different cycles. (c) Cycling performance studied at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for the TiN-SC with a PVA/KOH polymer electrolyte and in a 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Reproduced from ref. 132 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
Additionally, SEM observations also demonstrated that the morphology and structure of the TiN NWs changed as the cycling progressed. Thus, the prerequisite to stabilize TiN NWs is suppression of its irreversible electrochemical oxidation reactions and structural pulverization. In this regard, the authors proposed a novel strategy to stabilize TiN NWs using a KOH/PVA polymer gel electrolyte to replace the aqueous one. The gel electrolyte with a limited water content could not only effectively suppress the irreversible reaction, but also mechanically stabilize the structure of TiN. As shown in Fig. 12c, the TiN-800 electrode using the KOH/PVA gel electrolyte exhibited significantly improved stability (up to 82% after 15000 cycles) compared to the same TiN electrode tested in 1 M KOH electrolyte. More importantly, the capacitive performance was not sacrificed by using the PVA/KOH gel polymer electrolyte. In order to broaden the application of TiN electrodes in aqueous ASCs, Lu et al.133 further developed a thin carbon coating method to improve the cycling stability of TiN electrodes. After 15000 cycles in 1 M KOH aqueous solution, the TiN@C core shell electrode yielded an outstanding long-term stability with retention of more than 91.7% of its initial capacitance. In addition, this method is also suitable for enhancing the electrochemical stability of other metal nitrides, such as VN.
Compared with TiN, VN can deliver a substantially higher specific capacitance of up to 1340 F g−1, but has poorer electronic conductivity.136,137 In this regard, some researchers tried to fabricate composite electrodes by the combination of TiN and VN to meet the requirements of efficient charge transportation and outstanding energy storage ability.136,137 For example, coaxial TiN@VN core–shell fibers were prepared by Cui et al. through electrospinning and post annealing treatment in ammonia.137 As expected, the composite electrode showed good capacitive performance when tested with a neutral electrolyte such as 5 M LiCl in a potential range of −1.2 to −0.2 V. The specific capacitance of this TiN-VN fiber electrode was 247.5 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. Moreover, a large capacitance retention of 160.8 F g−1 was achieved when the scan rate increased to 50 mV s−1, implying its superior rate capability. In addition, VN electrodes with various nano-sized architectures have also been widely explored in recent years.128,133,138–142 Like TiN electrodes, these electrodes also severely suffer from the poor electrochemical stability of VN. Li and his co-workers developed a new kind of neutral PVA/LiCl polymer gel electrolyte to realize the stabilization of porous VN NWs.128 The stability of the VN electrode could be significantly improved using a LiCl/PVA gel electrolyte with a high capacitance retention of 95.3% after 10000 charge/discharge cycles, while only 10% capacitance retention was achieved for the one in an LiCl aqueous electrolyte. Further, a stable and high-performance ASC device based on the stabilized VN NWs as the anode and VOx NWs as the cathode was also demonstrated for the first time. The working voltage window of the as-fabricated VOx//VN-ASC device was 1.8 V. Additionally, the VOx//VN-ASC device delivered a remarkable volumetric capacitance of 1.35 F cm−3 (Fig. 13b) and energy density of 0.61 mW h cm−3 at 0.5 mA cm−2 as well as excellent cycling stability with 12.5% decrease of capacitance after 10000 cycles.

(b) Volumetric capacitance and specific capacitance calculated for the VOx//VN-ASC device based on the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves as a function of current density. Reproduced from ref. 128 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
Although the electrochemical performance of TiN and VN could be stabilized by a protection layer or gel electrolyte, their applications are still restricted to a certain extent. High-performance metal nitride anodes with remarkable electrochemical stabilities have largely been pursued. Some attempts were made to investigate the capacitive performance of Mo144,145 and W based nitrides.146 However, only few studies involved their application as anodes, even though they possess high electronic conductivities and electrochemical stabilities. Most recently, Yu et al.146 synthesized a type of holey tungsten oxynitride (WON) nanowires on carbon cloth by the nitridation of WO3 precursor nanowires. The wire-like morphology was well preserved during the conversion from WO3 to WON as shown in Fig. 14a. The TEM image in Fig. 14b further reveals the rough surface and porous structure of WON nanowires, which greatly increased the number of accessible active sites to the electrolyte. When WON electrodes were evaluated as ASC anodes with a potential window of −1 to 0 V in a solution of 5 M LiCl, they showed a high volumetric capacitance of 4.95 F cm−3 at 12.5 mA cm−3 (Fig. 14c). Unlike TiN and VN electrodes, the WON electrode exhibited a remarkable cycling stability with only 7% capacitance loss even after 100000 cycles (Fig. 14d), which is the best cycling performance ever reported for metal nitrides or oxynitrides. More importantly, the ASC device using the as-prepared WON NWs as the anode and a MnO2 electrode as the cathode could work steadily at a stable electrochemical voltage of 1.8 V and achieved a high volumetric capacitance of 2.73 F cm−3. The maximum energy density for this MnO2//WON-ASC device was 1.27 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 0.62 W cm−3, which is substantially higher than those of most developed ASCs in recent years. Besides, WON electrodes were also demonstrated to be good anodes for microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Based on these bifunctional anodes, an integrated MFC-ASC device was also developed, which could simultaneously realize energy conversion and storage (Fig. 14f). Table 3 summarizes the capacitive properties of metal nitride based anodes and the corresponding ASC devices.

5. Other high-performance anodes
Conducting polymers are also a big family of pseudocapacitive materials because of their good conductivities, reversible redox reactions during the charge/discharge process, and low environmental impact. Nevertheless, research studies on conducting polymers based materials mainly focused on their electrochemical performance as cathode materials rather than anode materials for ASCs. Recent studies demonstrated that polypyrrole (Ppy) can also function as a good pseudocapacitive material within a negative potential range.147–150Ppy based anodes with special morphologies were designed and fabricated with advanced nanotechnology. For example, Wang et al.150 fabricated a kind of WO3@Ppy nanowires on carbon fibers. Fig. 15a clearly shows that a thin layer of Ppy with a thickness of ∼25 nm was uniformly coated on the surface of WO3 nanowires, which effectively enriched the accessible surface of Ppy to the electrolyte. The CV curves in 3 M NaOH at 20 mV s−1 obtained for different electrodes reveal the important role of WO3 scaffolds and Ppy as the main electrochemical active content (Fig. 15b). A satisfactory areal capacitance of 253 mF cm−2 was reached for the core–shell electrode at a current density of 0.67 mA cm−2. The authors further synthesized Co(OH)2 nanowires on fabric as the cathode, and assembled an ASC device. Fig. 15c shows that the as-fabricated ASC device appears to exhibit pseudocapacitive property with a stable potential window of 0–1.6 V. Significantly, the largest volumetric capacitance based on the whole volume of the device was calculated to be 2.8 F cm−3 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 (Fig. 15d). Moreover, the ASC device delivered an outstanding energy density of 1.03 mW h cm−3.

Metal sulfides like nickel sulfide (Ni3S2)151 and vanadium sulfide (V3S4)152 were also explored as anode materials for ASCs. Metal sulfides generally possess higher electrical conductivity and mechanical and thermal stabilities than their corresponding metal oxides. The Das group151 prepared hierarchical Ni3S2 on reduced graphene oxide through a hydrothermal method. The electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 987.8 F g−1 during −0.75–0 V, and an excellent cycle stability of 97.9% after 3000 cycles. They further fabricated a Ni3S2//Co3S4 ASC device, achieving a high energy density of 55.16 W h kg−1. In addition, Zhai et al.152 demonstrated V3S4 as a good pseudocapacitive anode material, which functions as both a good power and energy source. The as-assembled V3S4//MnO2 ASC reached a remarkable energy density of 7.4 W h kg−1 and an average power density of 3000 W kg−1 based on the mass of the whole device. Despite these achievements, electrochemical investigations regarding sulfides are still in the primary stage and deserve more attention. Table 4 summarizes the capacitive properties of other anodes and the corresponding ASC devices.

6. Summary and outlook
For the moment, diminishing the performance gap between anodes and cathodes is significantly important to the assembling of ASCs with high power and energy densities. In this regard, the design and preparation of high-performance anodes will continue to be a crucial task in the future. Based on our review of ASC anodes, it can be concluded that major attention has been focused on carbon material based anodes. In general, their electronic storage mechanism generally relies on EDLCs, which is more like a physical process. Compared to the faradaic reaction, such a charge storage/release process is less likely to damage the structure, thus contributing to the long cycling stability of carbon material based anodes. Moreover, the superior charge transfer efficiency through these carbon anodes leads to their remarkable rate capability. Through constructing hierarchical porous channels, incorporating heteroatoms and functional groups, their electrochemical properties could be effectively boosted, especially in aspects such as accessible active sites, improved electronic properties and introduced pseudocapacitance. Unfortunately, the specific capacitances of carbon based anodes still remain low, which badly restrict their further advancement. Alternatively, metal oxides (like iron oxides, molybdenum oxides, vanadium oxides, etc.), usually possessing high theoretical capacitances due to their reversible redox reactions between different valences, become indispensable in the field of anodes for ASCs. Their main drawbacks are the unsatisfactory conductivities arising from their semi-conductive nature, and irreversible redox reactions and structural deterioration accompanying the charge/discharge process. Therefore, massive effort has been taken towards tackling their insufficient conductivities and electrochemical stabilities. Approaches like designing nanoarchitectures and compositing metal oxides with highly conductive materials have been employed and great success has been achieved. Notably, a fascinating strategy of introducing oxygen vacancies into metal oxides was demonstrated to greatly improve their conductive nature, and thus their capacitive behaviors. On the other hand, metal nitrides seem to combine superior conductivity and pseudocapacitance together, which simultaneously offer decent rate capabilities and large specific capacitances. However, some of them (like TiN, VN) undergo a severe irreversible oxidation process, resulting in poor cycling performance. Given this limitation, researchers tried to stabilize them by using solid-state electrolytes or coating a protective layer. Besides, chemically inert oxynitride tungsten was found to possess ultralong cycling stability in a neutral LiCl electrolyte, which holds great promise as a high-performance anode in all aspects. Furthermore, metal sulfides and other materials were also explored as good alternatives for ASC anodes with the assistance of nanotechnologies and composite methods. Such research studies are relatively few and still in the primary stage. In spite of all these achievements, the following trends or challenges might require large attention of researchers:
(1) As for carbon materials, micro-pores are responsible for offering large accessible surface areas and active sites to the electrolyte, while meso-pores provide efficient ion diffusion channels into the internal regions, accelerating the kinetic process. Therefore, rational distribution of interconnected micro- and meso-pores is a promising method for optimizing the electrochemical performance of carbon based anodes.
(2) Combinations, like metal oxides and carbon materials, are highly perceived as good choices of anode materials. Such composites are believed to have a synergistic effect of high conductivity and highly reversible pseudocapacitance, resulting in both high specific capacitances and good rate capabilities. However, a complete understanding of such a synergistic effect is still in the primary stage, there is large scope for the investigation of interactions between carbon materials and metal oxides. Moreover, the weight fractions of metal oxides in these reported composites remain low, which lead to impractically high energy densities of the ASCs fabricated with them. It is highly imperative to decrease the content of non-active materials in such composite anodes without deterioration of capacitive performances.
(3) Since the final destination of ASC devices is practical application, easy generalization of the methods used in preparing high-performance anodes plays a vital role. Large-scale, cost-effective fabrication methods are becoming a new hot topic. Additionally, safety concerns and “green chemistry” should also be taken into consideration during these processes.
(4) There has been an increasing interest in the assembly of the so-called self-powered systems by integrating energy conversion devices with storage devices. Most of the energy conversion devices, such as solar cells, photovoltaic cells, microbial fuel cells, and nano-generators, can directly harvest energy from the environment, even though with a low output power. Self-sustained systems are believed to be realized by integrating ASCs with these energy conversion devices, which can not only efficiently store the energy generated by the energy conversion part, but also drive other electronics with a high output power.
