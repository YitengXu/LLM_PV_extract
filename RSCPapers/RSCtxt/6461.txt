    , Accepted 20th August 2021First published on 21st August 2021AbstractGd2GaSbO7:Cr3+,Yb3+ phosphors with efficient broadband NIR emission were prepared by a solid-state reaction. Under the excitation of 448 nm, the Gd2GaSbO7:Cr3+ (GGS:Cr3+) phosphor exhibits a broadband NIR emission band centered at approximately 770 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 160 nm. In addition, Yb3+ codoping can distinctly improve the photoluminescence properties of the GGS:Cr3+ phosphor, leading to broadening of the FWHM and greatly enhancing the thermal stability of the phosphor. Moreover, the energy conversion process of Cr3+ → Yb3+ ions was analyzed in detail, demonstrating that the energy transfer mechanism conformed to electric dipole–dipole interaction. The NIR pc-LEDs assembled with the GGS:Cr3+ phosphor and blue LED chips possessed a maximum NIR output power of ∼21 mW at 100 mA driving current, indicating promising applications of the synthesized phosphor in NIR pc-LEDs.
1. Introduction
Broad-band emission phosphors in the NIR region have drawn great attention for widespread applications in food quality inspection, night vision illumination, medical diagnostics, etc.1–8 NIR spectroscopy has been used as a common nondestructive analysis tool to detect specific substances in food, plants, and human biological tissues due to the merits of noninvasiveness, high convenience and efficiency, low background noise, appreciable penetration depth, etc.9–14 To date, various NIR light sources, such as LEDs, organic LEDs (OLEDs), and pc-LEDs, have been developed.15–17 Among them, traditional NIR light sources suffer from some defects of low efficiency, large size, high power consumption and short lifetime, which severely impede their generalized applications.18 Although these problems can be avoided by NIR LEDs, the narrow emission bands and FWHM (<50 nm) of NIR LEDs cause practical restrictions.6 Moreover, the emerging flexible OLEDs also face the issues of low efficiency and poor temperature resistance. In comparison, the NIR pc-LED seems to be an efficient solution,19,20 which has been proven to possess a long lifetime, broadband emissions, high efficiency, and economic applicability.21,22 As a necessary component of pc-LEDs, the broadband NIR phosphor plays an important role in practical applications. Therefore, there is an urgent need to exploit novel NIR phosphors applicable for major blue LED chips.19
To explore broadband NIR phosphors, numerous investigations have been carried out by doping rare earth ions (Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, and Tm3+), Bi3+ ions or transition metal ions (Ni2+, Mn4+ and Cr3+) into host materials.23–27 At present, NIR phosphors using trivalent rare earth (RE3+) ions as NIR luminescence centers have attracted increasing interest.28–30 However, the inherent narrow emission spectrum of rare earth ion doped NIR phosphors cannot satisfy the appreciable needs of broadband NIR pc-LEDs and restricts their applications. Different from the f–f forbidden transitions of rare earth ions, the d–d transitions of transition-metal ions usually show wide excitation and emission bands, exhibiting superior application prospects in NIR pc-LEDs.31 Among the reported transition metal activators, the Cr3+ ion has been confirmed to be an ideal luminescence center due to its high efficiency and optimistic matching with commercial blue LED chips.32 Plenty of Cr3+-activated phosphors have been reported, for instance, LiScP2O7:Cr3+ (FWHM = 170 nm),19 Ca2MgWO6:Cr3+ (FWHM = 170 nm),33 Ca2LaHf2Al3O12:Cr3+ (FWHM = 141 nm),34 and La3Ga5GeO14:Cr3+ (FWHM = 330 nm).35 Nevertheless, this kind of NIR phosphor is usually subject to relatively short emission wavelength and longer emission deficiency (>900 nm). This situation can be improved by energy transfer between codoping ions. Some reports have shown that the phosphors containing Cr3+ and Yb3+ ions can improve the NIR luminescence properties by energy transfer from the Cr3+ to Yb3+ ions.19,36 For NIR Cr3+ doped phosphors, another challenge is a lower thermal quenching temperature. As we know, Cr3+ ions are inclined to be close coupled with the host lattice and have a 3d3 electronic configuration. Consequently, the nonradiative transition of Cr3+ ions is stronger than that of rare earth ions, leading to a lower thermal quenching temperature. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop an efficient strategy to suppress the thermal quenching of the Cr3+-doped NIR phosphors.
Here, we reported a neoteric GGS:Cr3+ phosphor with broadband NIR emissions (650–1150 nm, λmax = 770 nm, FWHM = ∼160 nm) under 448 nm blue light excitation. In addition, the NIR luminescence property of the phosphor was further improved by codoping Yb3+ and Cr3+ ions, exhibiting a broadened FWHM and enhanced thermal stability. The energy transfer and enhancement mechanism of Cr3+ → Yb3+ have been studied and discussed in detail. Moreover, the feasibility of GGS:Cr3+,Yb3+ phosphors for NIR pc-LED and c-Si solar cell applications was also investigated.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and synthesis
Gd2−yGa1−xSbO7:xCr3+,yYb3+ samples were synthesized by a solid-state reaction strategy. The materials Gd2O3, Ga2O3, Sb2O3, Yb2O3, and Cr2O3 were weighed on the basis of the stoichiometric ratio and mixed homogeneously by grinding for 30 minutes. Next, the mixture was sintered at 1400 °C in air (4 h, two times), in which the intermediate grinding step was necessary to obtain homogeneous powders. After cooling to room temperature, regrinding was performed on the samples.
2.2 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were obtained by using a Bruker AXS D8, with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα as incident radiation, operating at 40 kV × 40 mA. The morphologies and chemical compositions of the as-prepared samples were analyzed by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energydispersive (EDS) spectrometer (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The photoluminescence emission (PL) spectra and the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra were recorded at ambient temperature using an Edinburgh Instruments Flsp-920 equipped with a 450w xenon lamp. The fluorescence decay curves were obtained from a Lecroy Wave Runner 6100 Digital Oscilloscope (1 GHz) using a tunable laser as the excitation (Continuum Sunlite OPO) source.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Phase and structural information
XRD measurements were used to verify the phase structure and purity of the synthesized samples. As shown in Fig. 1, the diffraction peaks of the single-doped GGS:xCr3+ and codoped GGS:Cr3+,Yb3+ samples were all well matched with those of the Gd2GaSbO7 standard data (PDF No. 38-0822) and no significant impure peaks were detected, demonstrating high phase purity of the synthesized samples. This result indicated that Cr3+ and Yb3+ ions were successfully incorporated into the host lattice.

Taking the crystallographic data (ICSD No. 201864) as the initial model, retrieved refinements were performed on the XRD spectra of GGS:0.06Cr3+ and GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+ phosphors using the GSAS (General Structure Analysis System) program (Fig. 2a and b). From the refined structural parameters (Table 1), the profile factors are Rp = 6.46% and Rwp = 4.49% for GGS:Cr3+, and Rp = 4.22% and Rwp = 6.05% for GGS:Cr3+,Yb3+, indicating the good fitting quality and single-phase property of the samples. The space group is Fdm.

Fig. 2c shows the crystal structure of Gd2GaSbO7. It can be seen that the atomic framework of GGS mainly includes [GaO6], [SbO6] octahedron and [GdO8] polyhedron. As reported, the ionic radius of Cr3+ is 0.615 Å (CN = 6, CN: coordination number), Yb3+ is 0.985 Å (CN = 8), Gd3+ is 1.053 Å (CN = 8), Ga3+ is 0.62 Å (CN = 6) and Sb5+ is 0.76 Å (CN = 6). Considering the ion radius and charge balance, Cr3+ ions can replace the Ga3+ sites in GGS hosts while Yb3+ ions can occupy Gd3+ sites with similar ionic radii. All Ga3+ sites are identical, meaning that there is just one type of Cr3+-emission center in GGS. Fig. 2d shows the SEM and EDS elemental mapping images of GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+. It is found that Gd, Ga, Sb, O, Yb, and Cr are uniformly distributed in the phosphor particles, indicating the successful doping of Cr3+/Yb3+ ions and homogeneous distribution of chemical elements.
3.2 PL properties of GGS:Cr3+
The PLE and PL spectra of GGS:Cr3+ were monitored at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 3a, three excitation bands at 313, 448, and 631 nm are clearly observed, corresponding to the 4A2 → 4T1(4P), 4A2 → 4T1(4F), and 4A2 → 4T2(4F) transitions of the Cr3+ ions, respectively. At the maximum excitation of 448 nm, GGS:Cr3+ shows a wide emission band with a maximum emission peak at 770 nm and a FWHM of 160 nm, which is due to the 4T2(4F) → 4A2 transition of the Cr3+ ions.

The emission intensity of the Cr3+ ions is affected by the crystal field environment. The energy level distribution of the Cr3+ ions can be represented by the Tanabe–Sugano diagram (Fig. 4). The crystal field parameters can be obtained from the following formula:37,38 (1) (2) ΔE = E(4T1) − E(4T2)(3)where B represents the Racah parameter, Dq is the crystal field parameter, E(4T1) and E(4T2) are the energy positions of the 4T1 and 4T2 levels, respectively, and ΔE is the energy difference between the 4T1 and 4T2 states. The values of E(4T2) and E(4T1) are ∼22321 and ∼15847 cm−1, respectively while ΔE is about 6473 cm−1. Accordingly, the B and Dq values are ∼652 and ∼1585 cm−1, respectively. Therefore, the GGS host shows a lower Dq/B value (∼2.43), indicating that Cr3+ ions are situated in a relatively weaker crystal field environment in the GGS host.

A series of GGS:Cr3+ samples with various contents of Cr3+ were prepared and the homologous PL spectra at the excitation of 448 nm were measured to confirm the optimal doping ratio. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PL intensity first increases to the maximum at x = 0.06 with the increase in the doping concentration (x value) of Cr3+ ions. Upon further increase of the x value, the emission intensity decreases owing to the concentration quenching mainly caused by energy transfer. From Fig. 3a, partial spectral overlap in the range of 650–750 nm is observed between the emission and absorption bands of the GGS:Cr3+ phosphor, indicating the existence of energy transfer among the Cr3+ ions. Generally, the process of energy transfer can be divided into nonradiative and radiative transfer. The difference between radiative and nonradiative transfer is mainly that the radiative transfer is not affected by the decay time.12
The life decay time of GGS:xCr3+ can be obtained from the following formula:39 (4)
As shown in Fig. 3d, the lifetime decreases from 65.26 to 29.57 μs with the increase of the Cr3+ ion concentration from 0.005 to 0.12. Therefore, the concentration quenching in GGS:Cr3+ is mainly caused by nonradiative transfer among Cr3+ ions, which increases at a higher Cr3+ concentration. In general, nonradiative resonance energy transfer involves electric multipole interaction and exchange interaction, which are determined by Rc (critical distance). When Rc ≤ 5 Å, exchange interaction occurs. When Rc > 5 Å, multipolar interaction occurs.40Rc is obtained using the following formula:41 (5)where V is the cell volume, N stands for the number of center cations in a unit cell, and xc represents the critical concentration. In the GGS:Cr3+ host, V = 1082.431 Å3, N = 8 and xc = 0.06. The calculated value of Rc is 16.27 Å. As a result, the mechanism of concentration quenching is mainly controlled by the electric multipolar interaction.
In the light of the Blasse and Van Uitert theory, the following formula can be used to explore the interaction type: (6)where x is the doping amount that is not less than the critical concentration, I is the corresponding emission peak intensity, and K and β are constants. The values of θ = 6, 8, 10 are confirmed as dipole–dipole (d–d), dipole–quadrupole (d–q), and quadrupole–quadrupole (q–q) interactions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3c, there is a linear relationship between logI/x and logx. According to the slope of linear fitting, the value of θ is 9.989, which is close to 10, indicating that the concentration quenching of the GGS:Cr3+ phosphor should be mainly caused by q–q interaction.
3.3 PL properties of Yb3+ and Cr3+codoped GGS
The broadband NIR emission of GGS:Cr3+ mainly locates in the range of 650–1150 nm, which is weak beyond 1000 nm. Yb3+ ions can be excited at 277 nm and produce NIR emission at ∼975 nm. In order to improve the luminescence properties, Yb3+ ions are incorporated into GGS:Cr3+ to synthesize Cr3+ and Yb3+ codoped GGS phosphors. As mentioned previously, Yb3+ ions tend to replace the Gd3+ sites in the GGS host because of the same valence state and relatively close ionic radius. The detailed refined structural data of GGS:Cr3+/Yb3+ are presented in Table 1.

Fig. 5a shows the excitation spectrum of the Yb3+ single-doped GGS sample (monitored at 975 nm). One can see that the band centered at 277 nm is ascribed to the charge transfer transition of the Yb3+–O2− ions. Under the excitation of 277 nm, a NIR emission band at about 975 nm is detected, which originates from the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of the Yb3+ ions. Fig. 5c shows the excitation spectrum of the Cr3+ and Yb3+ codoped sample (monitored at 975 nm). It is found that the excitation spectrum in the range of 200–650 nm shows a similar broadband distribution, compared with the Cr3+ single-doped GGS sample (monitored at 770 nm). Under the excitation peak of the Cr3+ ions (448 nm), the emission spectrum of GGS:Cr3+,Yb3+ (Fig. 5c) consists of a broad emission band at about 770 nm of the Cr3+ ions and a NIR emission at about 975 nm of the Yb3+ ions. In addition, a weak peak at 1036 nm is observed, which is due to the characteristic emission property of the Yb3+ ions. These results confirm that an efficient energy transfer process of Cr3+ → Yb3+ exists for GGS:Cr3+,Yb3+ codoped samples, although there is almost no obvious spectral overlap between the Cr3+ ion emission spectrum and Yb3+ ion excitation bands. On the basis of the above results, we propose that the energy transfer process of Cr3+ → Yb3+ can be carried out through phonon assistance.42
 Fig. 5  PL excitation and emission spectra for (a) GGS:0.06Yb3+, (b) GGS:0.06Cr3+, and (c) GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+. 
To further reveal the energy transfer phenomenon in the Cr3+ and Yb3+ codoped GGS samples, a sequence of GGS:0.06Cr3+,yYb3+ phosphors were synthesized. Fig. 6a shows the PL spectra of GGS:0.06Cr3+,yYb3+ with different amounts of Yb3+ doping when excited at 448 nm. With the increase of Yb3+ ions (y value), the emission intensity of the Yb3+ ions increases significantly, while the emission intensity of the Cr3+ ions decreases, indicating the energy transfer from the Cr3+ to Yb3+ ions. Compared with GGS:Cr3+, the Cr3+ and Yb3+ codoped sample further broadens the emission band. Meanwhile, a sequence of GGS:xCr3+,0.006Yb3+ (x = 0–0.08) samples were prepared and their PL emission spectra (λex = 448 nm) are shown in Fig. 6b. The result indicates that the emission intensity of the Yb3+ ions increases while that of the Cr3+ ions decreases with the increase of the Cr3+ content, further supporting that there is an energy transfer process from the Cr3+ to Yb3+ ions.

To evaluate the energy transfer mechanism of GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+, Rc was calculated to be 12.91 Å according to eqn (5). Hence, the exchange interaction can be ruled out, and the electric multipole interaction should be the main reason for the energy transfer process of Cr3+ → Yb3+ in GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+ samples. In order to further verify the interaction type, the following equation derived from Dexter's energy transfer formula and Reisfeld's approximation is used:43 (7)where ηS0 and ηS stand for the luminescence quantum efficiency of doped Cr3+ ions without Yb3+ ion and with Yb3+ ion doping, respectively, and C represents the total concentration of Cr3+ and Yb3+ ions. Since it is difficult to determine ηS0 and ηS, ηS0/ηS is usually superseded by the relevant emission intensity ratio of IS0/IS. Therefore, eqn (7) can be converted to the following eqn (8):44 (8)
The relationship between IS0/IS and Cα/3 is shown in Fig. 6c. When α = 6, R2 = 0.977 is the best linear fitting, showing that the electric dipole–dipole interaction mechanism is dominated by Cr3+ → Yb3+ energy transfer in GGS:0.06Cr3+,Yb3+ samples. This result is similar to a previous report, where the energy transfer from the Cr3+ to Yb3+ ions is also due to the electric dipole–dipole interaction.45
In order to further verify the energy transfer process, the luminescence kinetics of the Cr3+ ions (λex = 448 nm, λem = 770 nm) is studied. Fig. 6d shows the life decay curves of GGS:0.06Cr3+,yYb3+ and the corresponding lifetimes are calculated by formula (4). It is found that the lifetime of theGGS:0.06Cr3+,yYb3+ phosphor decreases from 43.11 to 23.33 μs with the increase of Yb3+ ions (from 0.02 to 0.16), further proving that the energy transfer process of Cr3+ → Yb3+ exists. The energy transfer efficiency (η) can be calculated by using the lifetime of the Cr3+ ions as follows:34 (9)
where τ0 and τS0 are the fluorescence lifetimes of the synthesized GGS:0.06Cr3+,yYb3+ and GGS:0.06Cr3+ phosphors, respectively. Fig. 6e shows the relationship between the fluorescence lifetime and energy transfer efficiency upon the increase in the Yb3+ ion concentration. One can see that the energy transfer efficiency is improved from 9.0 to 50.7% with the increase of the Yb3+ content (0.02–0.16).
To evaluate the luminescent thermal stability, the temperature-dependent PL spectra of GGS:0.06Cr3+ and GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+ are monitored in the temperature range of 25–200 °C. As shown in Fig. 7, the PL intensity of the GGS:0.06Cr3+ phosphor decreases distinctly with the increase of temperature and the value is about 50% at 150 °C of that at room temperature (25 °C). Comparatively, the overall luminous intensity of GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+ at 150 °C is about 91% of that at 25 °C (Fig. 7b), indicating that the thermal stability of phosphors is immensely enhanced by doping Yb3+ ions.

Fig. 8 shows a simplified energy level diagram of electron transition in GGS:Cr3+,Yb3+. As confirmed previously in Fig. 3a, NIR emission of the Cr3+ ions at about 770 nm comes from the excitation in the range of 200–750 nm. Therefore, the electrons of the Cr3+ ions are first excited from the 4A2 ground state to the 4T1 and 4T2 excited states, and then undergo nonradiative relaxation to the lowest excited state. A part of the electrons return to the 4A2 ground state by radiative transition, which produces NIR light of the Cr3+ ions. The other part of the electrons also return to the 4A2 ground state by nonradiative energy transfer from the Cr3+ to Yb3+ ions, leading to the excitation of electrons of the Yb3+ ions from the 2F7/2 ground state to the 2F5/2 excited states. As a result, Yb3+ ions emit infrared light.

The comparison of the spectral response of c-Si solar cells, the solar spectrum, and the emission and excitation spectra of GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+ samples is shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the GGS:Cr3+,Yb3+ material can effectively convert the energy in the UV–visible region that cannot be absorbed efficiently by c-Si solar cells to the optimum response spectral region, indicating a promising application of the synthesized GGS:Cr3+,Yb3+ phosphors in increasing the conversion efficiency of c-Si solar cells.

3.4 NIR pc-LED devices
GGS:0.06Cr3+ and GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+ phosphors were integrated with commercial blue LED chips (λem = 460 nm) to prepare NIR pc-LEDs and the emission spectra of pc-LEDs under different operating currents were monitored. As shown in Fig. 10, the NIR output power increases gradually with the increase in the current; the value is ∼21 mW for GGS:0.06Cr3+ and ∼13 mW for GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+ at 100 mA. These results show the application prospect of phosphors in NIR pc-LEDs.

4 Conclusion
In conclusion, a sequence of GGS:Cr3+ broadband NIR phosphors were prepared by a solid-state strategy. Under 448 nm excitation, GGS:Cr3+ phosphors show broad NIR emission in the range of 650–1150 nm with a FWHM of ∼160 nm and a peak centered at ∼770 nm. The energy transfer from the Cr3+ to Yb3+ ions further broadens the NIR luminescent region. The electric dipole–dipole interaction should be the main cause of the energy transfer mechanism. Moreover, GGS:Cr3+,Yb3+ phosphors exhibit further enhanced thermal stability. The PL intensity of GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+ at 150 °C remains 91% of that at room temperature (25 °C), revealing good thermal stability. The NIR emission of the GGS:0.06Cr3+,0.06Yb3+ phosphor is in good agreement with the response curve of c-Si solar cells. Hence, the synthesized GGS:Cr3+,Yb3+ phosphors have a promising application in increasing the conversion efficiency of c-Si solar cells. A NIR pc-LED was fabricated by using GGS:Cr3+ phosphors with blue chips and the maximum NIR output was ∼21 mW at 100 mA, indicating the potential application of the synthesized phosphor in NIR pc-LEDs. This study may provide a new idea for Cr3+-activated broadband NIR phosphors and efficient guidance for further improving the NIR emission properties of Cr3+ ions.
