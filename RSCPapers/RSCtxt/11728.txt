    , Accepted 16th May 2011First published on 29th June 2011AbstractA 3D hybrid architecture composed of macroscopic, vertically aligned CNT blocks which are formed via a metal catalyzed CVD process followed by deposition of TiO2 on the CNT side walls in nanocrystalline or amorphous form is presented. The morphology of the deposited TiO2 can be tailored by the deposition method employed. Depositing TiO2 from the gas phase by employing the organometallic precursor Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 leads to formation of nanocrystalline anatase or rutile particles with a dense coverage on the surface and within the 3D CNT scaffold. Phase pure TiO2 (anatase) is formed between 500 and 700 °C, while higher temperatures resulted in rutile modification of TiO2. Below 500 °C, TiO2 forms an amorphous oxide layer. At higher temperatures such initially formed TiO2 layers segregate into particles which tend to crystallize. In contrast, when generating TiO2 by oxidation of Ti metal which is deposited by vaporization onto the 3D CNT block array, and subsequently oxidized in air or controlled O2 atmosphere this leads to a porous layer with a particular nanostructure on top of the CNT blocks. First studies of the fabrication and field emission of the new 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid cathodes display good and stable FE characteristics with onset fields for current density of 1 μA cm−2 of 1.7 to 1.9 V μm−1, while the average field enhancement factor is in the range between 2000 and 2500 depending on the O2 base pressure during the measurements.
Introduction
Functional hybrid nanomaterials based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and transition metal oxides are interesting due to the outstanding properties of their individual material components.1,2 On the one hand the excellent mechanical and electrical properties of CNTs make them an attractive material for applications in sensors,3 transistors4 as well as in field emission (FE) devices.5 The latter are mainly concerned with their small tip radius and high aspect ratio, high electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. On the other hand, nanoscaled oxides of the transition metals are probably the most prominent functional materials in the area of chemical sensors,6,7 printed electronics,8 and in the field of energy storage and conversion, e.g. battery applications9 or photochemical activity.10 Applications for hybrid materials composed of CNTs and ZnO,11–13 CNTs and TiO2,14,15 as well as CNTs and SnO216,17 in areas as photocatalysis, gas sensors, and energy harvesting are prominent. However up to date, mainly stochastically oriented CNTs were so far used and metal oxide nanoparticles or their thin films were deposited in solution. The main disadvantages of employing unordered, stochastically arranged CNTs in such hybrids are the loss of their active surface area, and sometimes their electrical conductivity. A major problem posed by such a composite of entangled CNTs and metal oxide is to control the average active surface area of such a composite in a functional device application in order to maximize its functional efficiency.
Herein we describe a synthetic approach for the formation of macroscopically ordered 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid architectures composed of aligned double walled CNTs (diameter 8–10 nm) forming an organized 3D CNT block array and TiO2 (anatase) nanoparticles (5–10 nm in size). Together, both components form a macroscopically sized composite containing individual, nanoparticulate 1D and 0D components. Two ways for obtaining the new hybrid structure via the gas phase are studied. Firstly, by an all CVD route, in which the CNTs are first grown in a spatially defined pattern by CVD and then the TiO2 nanoparticles are subsequently deposited viaCVD from a molecular precursor onto the patterned 3D CNT blocks. The second approach uses a combination of CVD for the CNT growth, followed by metal deposition and controlled thermal oxidation of the Ti metal to obtain TiO2 particles tethered onto the surface of the CNT blocks.
Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge no reports on the gas phase deposition of TiO2 on CNT structures using molecular precursors have been reported. The resulting CNT/TiO2 composites were studied with respect to their integral FE properties. The deposition methodology was fine tuned with respect to particle size, titania phase and amount of titania deposition. The resulting 3D CNT/TiO2 composites have potential in functional applications such as water splitting or dye sensitized solar cells or as electrodes for a field emission (FE) application. Since FE properties mainly depend on the field enhancement factor and the surface barrier height through which electrons tunnel, a significant lowering of this barrier is required for low electric field operation. CNTs with their high geometrical field enhancement are the most prospective cathode material showing strong FE at low electric field. The FE homogeneity and stability of individual CNTs in defined FE arrays, however, are still limited due to the rather fast and hardly controllable growth,18 leading to strongly varying field enhancement and current carrying capability.19 Therefore, regular arrays of aligned CNT blocks with multiple emitters can provide a suitable strategy to improve the FE cathodes for advanced applications, which require efficient, homogeneous, and stable FE at low fields as well as high current densities.20 One way to improve e.g. the life time and stability of the electron emission from the CNTs is their effective protection by a coating layer. Wide band gap materials (e.g. BN,21,22MgO,23SiO2,23 and ZnO24,25) are preferable in this respect. The titania layer is supposed to stabilize CNTs during FE against oxidation. To the best of our knowledge there are no systematic FE studies available concerning TiO2 (bandgap ΔE = 3.2 eV26) coated CNTs. On the other hand, the combination of titania (in its anatase modification) with electrically conducting CNTs can lead to a composite structure with enhanced photocatalytic activity even under visible light illumination.27,28 In such composites titania acts as a photoactive material generating electron/hole (e/h) pairs. The electron from this e/h-pair is carried away by the CNT, leaving the hole on the oxide available e.g. for a catalytic reaction. To enhance the charge carrier separation, a most intimate contact between CNTs and the tethered TiO2 nanoparticles is necessary. Synthetic routes to tether TiO2 to the CNT surface so far rely on wet chemical solution techniques (electrochemical,29–31 microemulsion,32 sol–gel,33–40 and hydrothermal41,42) to deposit TiO2. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) routes are however better suited to infiltrate macroscopic 3D objects since gas phase processes (i) allow generation of molecular fragments under mild conditions, (ii) are very smooth and mechanically not demanding process to any substrate and (iii) allow interpenetration of 3D objects in a way which leads to a uniform, conformal deposition.
Experimental
Synthesis of 3D CNT block arrays
CNTs were synthesized using a water assisted chemical vapor deposition method.43–45 In a typical experiment, Al (10 nm) and Fe (1 nm) were deposited on a cleaned Si wafer. The ready substrate was then heated to 800 °C in a 30 mm quartz tube using a 3 zone tube oven under flow of hydrogen (400 sccm) and argon (600 sccm) gas. At the growth temperature, ethylene (100 sccm) precursor gas flow was started and a small amount of carrier gas was bubbled through a water bubbler to carry a defined amount of water vapor along with it. The amount of water vapor was monitored using a commercial water vapour sensor built in the line (Mitchel instruments). In order to grow the structured CNT blocks, prior to the deposition of the iron catalyst, a nylon grid was fixed on the Al-coated Si substrate. The grid allows for a spatially defined deposition of iron e.g. in equidistant quadratic Fe islands, thus enabling growth of structured CNT blocks. With a standard CNT growth rate of 30 to 40 μm per minute, 3D CNT block structures were grown up to a to height of 400 to 500 μm. CNT growth, deposition of titania particles as well as oxidation of the titania film were carried out in a programmable three zone oven within a 30 mm diameter quartz tube. The metal deposition (Ti, Al and Fe) was monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance (Cressington MTM 10). The gas flow was controlled using commercially available mass flow controllers (MKS instruments, Munich, Germany).
Deposition of titanium oxides


Chemical vapor deposition route. 

Titanium isopropoxide Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 (Sigma Aldrich, degassed and kept under argon prior to use) was employed as a precursor for TiO2. The precursor was introduced into the CVD reactor using a bubbler and argon as a carrier gas (100 sccm). The process temperature for the CVD process was adjusted between 300° and 800 °C. The precursor temperature was varied between 100° and 140 °C.


Thermal oxidation route. 

            Titanium metal was deposited on as grown structured 3D CNTs film/blocks using an electron beam metal evaporation technique (∼0.5 nm min−1). The as deposited 100 to 200 nm thick metal film was then oxidized in air or in a controlled atmosphere using different rates of oxygen supply (5 sccm to 100 sccm, each time diluted using 200 sccm of argon) in the temperature range between 400 and 550 °C.

Materials characterization

Raman spectroscopy was carried out using a LabRAM HR high resolution microscope (Horiba Jobin Yvon, model HR 800). The excitation wavelength of the laser was 488 nm. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out using an instrument ESCALab 250 (Thermo VG Scientific) using monochromatic Al Kα radiation in constant analyzer energy (CAE) mode with a pass energy of 50 eV for all spectra. SEM investigations were performed using a Philips XL 30 FEG microscope with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. TEM investigations were carried out using a Philips CM200 with a LaB6 cathode at 200 kV. XRD measurements were performed on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with copper Kα radiation in 2θ range of 15 to 90°.
Field emission measurement
Integral FE properties of the hybrid-based structured cathodes were carried out with integral measurement system with luminescent screen (IMLS)46 in diode configuration using dc and pulsed modes. Carbon nanotubes were grown on 1 × 1 cm2silicon wafer in the form of rectangular 3D blocks (50 × 50 μm2 in size) with varying intermediate distances (50, 150 and 250 μm). CNT electrodes were tested for FE before and after TiO2 deposition. In IMLS system, single CNT block or complete wafer was measured for field emission with a standard electrode gap of about 1 mm. Long-term stability of the cathodes was tested in dc mode under various controlled vacuum conditions at stepwise enhanced partial pressure of oxygen in the IMLS as well.
Results and discussion
A hydrogen and water assisted catalytic CVD method was used for the growth of vertically aligned double walled CNTs. The catalyst metals aluminium and iron were first deposited on a p-type silicon wafer. After deposition of the aluminium layer (10 nm) iron is deposited (1 nm) in a structured way using a nylon mesh shadow mask.43 A high CNT growth rate of 25–30 μm min−1 resulted in aspect ratios of up to 250 (heightCNT/diameterCNT = 2 mm/8 nm), a nanoscale tip diameter of ca. 8 nm and a good homogeneity. The blocks patterned by our technique were not exactly in square form, as the mesh used was a woven mesh which tends to lead to nonsquare perforations. The electrical conductivity of the CNT block structure measured in the longitudinal direction is 2–4 S cm−1 (CNTdiameter = 8 nm, CNT length = 300 μm and CNT density ca. 2.5 × 109 tubes per mm2), in good agreement to other values.44,47
Deposition of TiO2 onto the CNT block structures was done using the molecular precursor Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4. Deposition of TiO2 in the anatase or rutile modification strongly depends on the CVD temperature.48 The same holds true for the TiO2 particle size and homogeneity, obtained during the CVD process which depends strongly on the precursor temperature. Therefore a series of CVD experiments were necessary to optimize the deposition parameters in order to gain control over the deposited particle size, morphology and film thickness of the TiO2 deposition. These were conducted in the temperature range from 300 °C to 800 °C leaving all other deposition parameters constant. For a synthesis temperature of 500 °C or even lower, only amorphous layers of TiO2 were deposited on the surface of the structured CNT blocks. In these experiments the CNT blocks were found to have a thin amorphous layer of titanium dioxide on its side wall. This amorphous layer acts as a barrier film, reducing the conductivity of the CNT film across its width drastically. CNTs are then insulated from each other, increasing the film resistance to an order of 500 MΩ. On the contrary, as grown CNT films show a conductivity in the order 2 to 4 S cm−1 (see above).
Above a deposition temperature of 500 °C, TiO2 nanoparticles start depositing on the sidewalls of the CNT blocks within the 3D array. Observing that, the gas flow rate was kept the same and the precursor temperature was varied from 90 to 140 °C over a series of experiments. It was found that the precursor temperature below 120 °C had no major impact on the particle size or on the loading rate of the CNT blocks. A homogeneous growth of titania was observed for the precursor temperature in the range of 130 to 140 °C. In order to get a homogeneous loading of crystalline nanoparticles on the side wall of CNTs, the precursor temperature and argon flow rate were thus held constant, and the CVD process temperature was raised in steps of 50 to 100 °C per single experiment. Each sample was investigated by Raman spectroscopy to identify the TiO2 phase formed. Two illustrative Raman spectra revealing the exact phase of TiO2 formed at different temperatures are depicted in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  (a) Raman spectra of 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid structures obtained at 550 °C, showing the anatase phase; (b) Raman spectra of 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid structures obtained at 700 °C, showing the then predominant rutile phase. The signals of the D and G modes corresponding to the CNTs are marked in dotted signature. 
At 550 °C, the anatase phase is predominant and results in peak intensities at 144, 399, 519 and 639 cm−1 (Fig. 1a). These peaks are attributed to the Raman active modes of the anatase phase with symmetries Eg, B1g, A1g, and Eg, respectively.49,50 On the other hand, the rutile phase formed above 700 °C is identified by Raman active modes but at 143, 235, 447, and 612 cm−1 (Fig. 1b).
The intensity of the peaks at 143 vs. 144 cm−1 is lower in the case of rutile in comparison to that of anatase which is well known from the literature.49,50
A reasonable explanation for the observed film to particle transformation of the deposited TiO2 while increasing the synthesis temperature from 300 over 500 to 700 °C might be found in the segregation of the amorphous thin film caused by the annealing procedure, which causes it to break up into particles which start to crystallize upon annealing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the hybrid material confirms the uniform loading of TiO2 nanoparticles on the individual CNT surfaces within the CNT block structure (Fig. 2). In addition high resolution SEM reveals a uniform deposition of titania nanoparticles on aligned CNTs.

(Scale bars in inset: (a) 100 μm and (d) 250 nm.) 

Fig. 2d shows that the TiO2 deposition by the gas phase route is highly homogeneous with a very dense TiO2 nanoparticle deposition (for high resolution TiO2 particle characterization see below). This indeed is a first cue that the deposition viaCVD using this molecular precursor may also enter the innermost part of the microsized 3D CNT block arrays leading to a homogeneous, overall TiO2 deposition even in the innermost block structure.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies at different process temperatures of 300°, 550° and 750 °C are depicted in Fig. 3. The TEM samples were obtained by unhinging individual CNT/TiO2 objects from the aligned 3D CNT/TiO2 block hybrids (Fig. 2) by intense ultrasound sonification. Below 500 °C, TiO2 formation results in an amorphous titania layer on the surface of the CNTs (Fig. 3a and b). Upon an increase of the growth temperature to 550 °C, and in a follow up experiment to 750 °C, TiO2 nanoparticles were formed and nucleating with well ordered crystallinity on the CNT side walls (Fig. 3c and d).

(e and f) as (c) and (d) but at 750 °C deposition temperature. 
Due to the constant gas flow rate and precursor temperature, TiO2 nanoparticle deposition is homogeneous and within a particle range of 5–10 nm. At 550 °C, the anatase phase of TiO2 is formed, while at 750 °C, the rutile phase is present. The insets in the TEMFig. 3d and f (550 °C and 750 °C process temperature) show well ordered lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 3.5 Å and 2.50 Å, corresponding to (101) anatase and (101) rutile phases respectively. A dense TiO2 side wall coverage and loading rate of about 15 to 20 wt% TiO2 was obtained under the chosen experimental conditions for both temperatures.

X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) allows further insight into the chemical composition of the CNT/TiO2 hybrid (Fig. 4).

XPS spectra of 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrids; (a) survey spectrum; (b) titanium 2p3/2 ionization; (c) oxygen O1s and (d) carbon C1sspectrum. 
In the XPS survey spectrum, the peak for titanium 2p3/2, is found at a binding energy of 458.76 eV, corresponding to Ti(IV). The main oxygen peak was recorded at 532.02 eV corresponding to O2−, confirming formation of TiO2.22 The carbon C1s peak at a binding energy of 284.5 eV and the oxygen O1s peak (shoulder) at 530.15 eV correspond to the CNT support material.51
Varying the deposition procedure of TiO2 from the gas phase molecular precursor route using Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 to a deposition technique employing first a metallic Ti layer which is deposited by metal vaporization onto the 3D CNT block structure and which is then subsequently oxidized to obtain TiO2 changes the morphology of the TiO2 in the final hybrid. A 100 to 200 nm thick layer of titanium metal was deposited onto the 500 μm high block structured 3D CNT film as well as on a glass substrate. This allows studying the influence of the CNT substrate surface vs. a flat surface on the TiO2 morphology. After Ti deposition, both films were heated to 500 °C under air.
The oxidized metal film on the glass substrate depicted a light blue color, whereas the one deposited on the surface of the CNT film appears whitish. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) of both films (Fig. 5) shows indeed different titania phases, indicating a morphological effect of the substrate during the Ti metal oxidation (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  
XRD spectra of (a) TiO2 deposited on glass substrate (grey squares: rutile phase); (b) 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid (grey squares: anatase phase, light square: CNT (100)-reflex, Si—reflexes of Si wafer). Both samples were obtained by first depositing a thin layer of Ti metal followed by subsequent air oxidation at 500 °C. 
On the dense glass surface, the metal film obviously undergoes incomplete oxidation, leading to formation of oxygen deficient unstöichiometric TiOx species with high defect ratio, causing this well known color effect. As crystalline phase only the rutile phase can be detected. On the porous, open surface of the CNT blocks (the distance between single CNTs in the blocks is about 10–15 nm36), the deposited titanium atoms were fully oxidized to yield phase pure anatase.

Raman spectroscopy and EDAX analyses of the 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrids confirm the findings from XRD (not shown). These experimental results do not change when employing a controlled oxygen atmosphere (100 sccm argon, variable O2 amount between 5 and 100 sccm). CNTs within the 3D CNT block structure form a porous scaffold helping enhancement of the contact between the oxygen and the deposited Ti atoms, thus allowing a full oxidation to the low temperature TiO2 anatase polymorph. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy and EDAX analyses of the 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid confirm the oxidation of titanium into anatase phase (not shown). Results on the morphology of the samples were obtained by SEM (Fig. 6). Indeed TiO2 film deposition results in a highly porous structure of the deposited film with a particular granular morphology. TEM micrographs (Fig. 6d) of isolated, unhinged CNT/TiO2 fragments reveal a particle size distribution between 5 and 10 nm. These particles are in intimate contact with each other forming a porous nanocrystalline film.

Field emission results
Structured 3D cathodes based on the 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrids (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, CVD route, anatase phase, particulate coating) were studied for their FE performance and stability aspects. Fairly good FE current homogeneity of the block arrays is observed already at the electric field below 10 V μm−1.
After some initial pulsed-mode processing, a stable FE current as high as 350 μA could be achieved (Fig. 7a). The maximum achievable cathode current was experimentally limited by the maximum power load which could be applied to the luminescent screen in order to avoid destruction of the luminescent screen material by plasma discharge (as detected by a mass spectrometer showing increase of sulfur in the system). For a full exploitation of the FE potential of these 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid cathodes, metallic anodes will be employed in the future.
 Fig. 7  Left side: luminescent screen image of the FE current distribution from a 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid cathode in pulsed mode (duty cycle 2?: ms) at electric field E = 10 V μm−1 and current I = 350 μA; right side: integral long-term current stability at a constant voltage (2 kV) as a function of enhanced pressure of oxygen. 
Long-term FE stability experiments (Fig. 7b) showed some sensitivity of the CNT/TiO2 hybrid cathodes towards higher oxygen atmosphere. Assuming a linear damage effect by oxygen, the total processing time of 4 h under enhanced O2 pressure up to 3 × 10−5 mbar corresponds roughly to about 1000 hours at the base pressure of 10−7 mbar. Passivation and activation of the field emitters were permanently observed by recording the IMLS images. These revealed a recovery of the field emitters afterwards at the base pressure but also a partial destruction by the O2 processing. Therefore, about 15% higher field is finally required to obtain the same current value as before the processing (Fig. 8). Accordingly, the onset field for a current density of 1 μA cm−2 increased from 1.7 to 1.9 V μm−1, while the average field enhancement factor reduced from 2503 to 2093. The titania film on the CNTs is made up of fine TiO2 nanoparticles, which are between 5 and 10 nm in diameter. From REM and TEM investigations, this nanoparticulate film is not thicker than 1 to 3 monolayers (5–30 nm) of titania nanoparticles. The FE stability tests showed though a clear evidence that the TiO2 coating leads to a stabilization of FE at low currents (I < 10 μA) but also reduced maximum currents (factor 2–3) of the blocks. Possibly a still thicker TiO2 coating helps improvement of the FE characteristics further.

However, more detailed FE studies of such hybrid structured cathodes are beyond the scope of this work and in depth FE measurements with systematic variation of the TiO2 coating on the CNT blocks are underway.
Conclusions
A 3D hybrid material composed of vertically aligned double walled CNTs which are arranged in spatially oriented block arrays and TiO2 material is described. The morphology of the TiO2 material on the surface of the CNTs can be tailored by employing different deposition techniques. Phase pure anatase can be synthesized between 500 and 700 °C on the 3D CNT block arrays while higher temperatures resulted in formation of the rutile modification of TiO2. The 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid cathodes displayed good FE characteristics with a distinct influence of TiO2 coating compared to the bare ones. Fabrication and FE tests of hybrid cathodes with an improved geometry and an optimized TiO2 coating suitable for triode applications are the next experimental step in the future.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Raman spectra of 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid structures obtained at 550 °C, showing the anatase phase; (b) Raman spectra of 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid structures obtained at 700 °C, showing the then predominant rutile phase. The signals of the D and G modes corresponding to the CNTs are marked in dotted signature.	 

 	Fig. 2  
          SEM images of 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid structures. (a) Bare 3D CNT structure; (b) 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid structure (inset shows a single CNT block in higher magnification, note the even, flat block surface without protruding CNTs); (c) overview of the TiO2 thin film in low magnification showing the homogeneous deposition of the film over the complete area of the CNT block; (d) 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid structure showing the morphology of the aligned CNT/TiO2 hybrid in higher magnification. (Scale bars in inset: (a) 100 μm and (d) 250 nm.)	 

 	Fig. 3  
          TEM micrographs of isolated, from the block structured hybrids, unhinged individual (double walled) CNT/TiO2 structures prepared at different temperatures by the all-CVD method; (a and b) isolated CNT/TiO2 structures displaying a complete coverage of CNTs with an amorphous layer of titania; (c and d) 550 °C deposition temperature depicting the nanocrystalline structure of the TiO2 deposit under different magnifications. (e and f) as (c) and (d) but at 750 °C deposition temperature.	 

 	Fig. 4  
XPS spectra of 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrids; (a) survey spectrum; (b) titanium 2p3/2 ionization; (c) oxygen O1s and (d) carbon C1sspectrum.	 

 	Fig. 5  
XRD spectra of (a) TiO2 deposited on glass substrate (grey squares: rutile phase); (b) 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid (grey squares: anatase phase, light square: CNT (100)-reflex, Si—reflexes of Si wafer). Both samples were obtained by first depositing a thin layer of Ti metal followed by subsequent air oxidation at 500 °C.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a and b) SEM images of TiO2 films grown on 3D CNT block arrays with different magnifications; (c and d) HRTEM images of TiO2 particles on isolated CNTs which were unhinged from the complete 3D CNT/TiO2 hybrid by ultrasonification, the inset shows an isolated, nanocrystalline anatase particle.
