    , Accepted 4th July 2012First published on 30th July 2012AbstractAn ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) with a nanorod-shaped morphology and enhanced graphitic character was employed as an ideal support for MnOx (major phase of Mn3O4 with a small portion of MnO) nanocrystals which possess a high theoretical conversion capacity as a Li-ion battery anode. The MnOx/OMC nanocomposite was prepared by a simple wet-impregnation of Mn(NO3)2 aqueous solution onto OMC nanorods followed by thermal treatment at 450 °C in an Ar flow. The electrochemical properties of MnOx/OMC were investigated in comparison to those of bare OMC and a commercial graphite as an anode for Li-ion batteries. Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption–desorption analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis revealed that 3–30 nm MnOx nanocrystals at a high loading of 68.4 wt% were formed and well dispersed in the pore structure of OMC nanorods. The MnOx/OMC exhibited a high reversible capacity (>950 mAh g−1) after 50 deep charge–discharge cycles with excellent cycling stability, Coulombic efficiency and rate capability. As an anode for Li-ion batteries, the incorporation of insulating high density MnOx nanocrystals into OMC nanorods showed synergistic benefits of high volumetric capacity as well as specific capacity, and small redox voltage hysteresis compared to OMC nanorods.
Introduction
The current generation of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is based on electrode materials in which Li is stored by intercalation between structural layers of lithium metal oxides for the cathode and C6 carbon for the anode.1–3 The redox cycle versus lithium via intercalation can be repeated without significant structural changes allowing excellent cycling performance. Despite the incremental improvements in LIB performances for the last two decades, the intercalation materials have shown their intrinsic limitations of energy and power densities in satisfying the demanding level of performances for both existing and new emerging applications such as electrified vehicles and storage of renewable energies (wind, solar).1–5 For example, graphitic carbon has been used as an anode material for lithium ion batteries because of its superior cycling performance and low cost since the first commercial introduction of LIBs. However, the major drawbacks of graphitic carbon as anode material come from its low theoretical capacity (372 mAh g−1 with one Li per C6), poor rate performance due to low intrinsic Li intercalation rate into its lattice crystal structure (d = 3.35 Å) raising safety concerns at its high rate of charging due to lithium plating, and relatively low specific density giving low volumetric capacity.
Various anode materials have been proposed to replace graphitic carbon anodes. Among them, nanomaterials of transition metal oxides, such as CoOx,6–8 NiO,9 FeOx10–12 and MnOx,12–14 have shown desirable properties such as high theoretical capacity, low safety concern, high intrinsic specific density, low cost and environmental friendliness for their application in LIBs. These transition metal oxides react with lithium by the “conversion reaction” to form Li2O and metal nanoparticles, as shown in eqn (1) below,7,15 in which full utilization of all the oxidation states of a high-valence transition metal oxides can be achieved and thus can store more than two Li ions per formula unit to deliver 2–3 times higher specific capacity than graphite. MxOy + 2yLi ↔ xM + yLi2O(1)
The reduction reaction of (1) to form nanosized metallic clusters and amorphous Li2O is thermodynamically favorable. Poizot et al. demonstrated that the reverse reaction, that is electrochemical decomposition of Li2O, is feasible due to enhanced reactivity of nano-sized metal particles derived from electrochemical conversion thereby making the conversion reaction reversible at room temperature.7,16 Among transition metal oxides, Mn3O4 could be an attractive candidate for LIB anodes due to its high theoretical conversion capacity (936 mAh g−1), high abundance, and low toxicity. Importantly, Mn3O4 reacts with lithium at much lower voltage vs. Li+/Li with narrower voltage hysteresis between charge and discharge than other transition metal oxides.3 Additionally, Mn3O4 can offer about 5–6 times higher volumetric capacity than graphite when coupled with its intrinsic high specific density. However, the practical application of pure Mn3O4 is frustrated by its extremely low electronic conductivity (∼10−7 to 10−8 S cm−1) and poor capacity retention due to drastic chemical and structural changes that inherently accompany the conversion reaction process.10,17,18
It has been difficult to extract the theoretical conversion capacities from manganese oxides including Mn3O4 as the anode material for Li-ion batteries.19–21 Pasero et al.20 reported that the reversible capacity of pure Mn3O4 was increased from 250 to 400 mAh g−1 by co-doping possibly due to enhanced electronic conduction. Recently, Au and Adams21 investigated the electrochemical performance of Mn2O3 nanoporous hollow spheres of 2 μm average diameter to give the reversible capacity of only 200 mAh g−1 (the theoretical conversion capacity of Mn2O3 is 1018 mAh g−1) at 500 mA g−1 when cycled between 3.0 and 0.01 V. Wang et al.13 showed that near theoretical capacity of Mn3O4 can be achieved by electrically wiring up Mn3O4 nanoparticles to a conducting RGO (reduced graphene oxide) substrate. Gao et al.14 showed that a spongelike nanosized Mn3O4 architecture can deliver a reversible capacity of around 800 mAh g−1 at a very low current density of 30 mA g−1.
Hence, the theoretical capacity of Mn3O4 could be extracted when it is of nanosized-dimension and incorporated with conducting substrates such as carbon. We further hypothesize that the electrochemical conversion reaction (1), especially, the reverse reaction of Li2O decomposition, could be repeated more effectively for prolonged cycles when Li2O particles are in an intimate contact with metallic clusters in a nano-confined space and conducting environment. Such an environment could be provided by a highly ordered 3D mesoporous carbon in which active transition metal oxide nanocrystals are well dispersed, the Li-ion diffusion path is shortened and electron transfer is favored by the highly conducting carbon framework. Zhou et al.22 investigated lithium storage in an ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), CMK-3, and observed that a reversible capacity level as high as 2.3–3.0 Li per C6 can be achieved with a good cycle performance possibly due to the 3D ordered structure of CMK-3. When the intrinsic low density of OMC due to its highly mesoporous nature is taken into account, however, it might offer a relatively low volumetric capacity. It also showed a high voltage hysteresis (i.e., around 1.5 V at the half its reversible capacity) between the discharging and the charging processes, and exhibited a very large irreversible capacity loss (66%) in the first cycle. Recently, other researchers employed conventional OMCs to host sulphur,23 CoO,8 NiO9 and SnO24 as the active materials for lithium storage by using melt-diffusion, hydrophilic encapsulation, sonochemical synthesis, etc.
Herein, we report the electrochemical synergistic benefits of incorporating MnOx (major phase of Mn3O4 with MnO impurity phase) nanocrystals into OMC nanorods which possess an optimized morphology and improved electrical conductivity for Li-ion battery application compared to the conventional OMCs. The MnOx/OMC nanocomposite was prepared by using the facile in situ synthesis approach, i.e., a pore-filling wet-impregnation followed by a moderate thermal annealing, reported in our previous study.11 The as-prepared MnOx/OMC was tested as an anode for LIBs in comparison to bare OMC nanorods and a commercial graphite. The MnOx/OMC exhibited synergistic benefits of higher volumetric capacity as well as higher reversible specific capacity (>950 mAh g−1 at C/10) with smaller voltage hysteresis than OMC nanorods. The MnOx/OMC also showed an excellent cycling stability with high Coulombic efficiency (CE) (>97%), and fairly good rate capability making it an attractive anode material for high capacity Li-ion batteries.
Experimental
Preparation of MnOx/OMC
The ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) nanorods were obtained from Unicam Ltd. (Korea). For Li-ion battery application, the OMC nanorods were prepared under customized conditions different from conventional OMC. In short, a hexagonally ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) of nanorod-shape was used as a template, and phenanthrene was used as a carbon source with a small amount of nitrogen source for the synthesis of OMC nanorods as reported elsewhere.25,26 The OMC nanorods were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight prior to use. The MnOx/OMC sample was prepared by a pore-filling wet-impregnation method as shown in Scheme 1. In a typical preparation, a saturated Mn precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Mn(NO3)2·5H2O in DI water. An amount of Mn solution, equivalent to the pore volume of OMC determined by the BET measurement, was impregnated onto OMC nanorods and the Mn-impregnated-OMC was dried at 80 °C in air. This process was repeated until the desired amount of Mn on OMC, i.e., about 70 wt% as Mn3O4 in MnOx/OMC, was loaded. After drying, the sample was heated in an Ar flow (50 cm3 min−1) to 450 °C at 5 °C min−1 rate and maintained at 450 °C for 2 h to form MnOx nanocrystals in situ in the confined pores of the OMC nanorods (Scheme 1).

Materials characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were recorded on an Ultima IV, Rigaku model D/MAX-50 kV system (Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 at liquid N2 temperature. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods were used to estimate the BET surface area and pore size distributions, respectively. The morphologies of the samples were investigated by using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-35CF operated at 10.0 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010 operated at 200.0 kV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Electron Corporation spectrometer with an Al Kα = 300.0 eV excitation source. The carbon content in MnOx/OMC was determined by the weight loss in a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) run to 800 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 in an airflow.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical tests were conducted using CR2032 coin cells with Li foil as the counter electrode. The working electrodes were prepared by casting a paste that consisted of 80 wt% active material (OMC nanorods, graphite (OCI Materials Co., Ltd. Korea) or MnOx/OMC), 10 wt% Super P Li (Timcal Ltd.) as a conductive additive, and 10 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder onto a copper foil. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was used as the solvent to make a slurry paste. The actual coating densities inclusive of binder and conductive additive of electrodes were determined by measuring the coating thicknesses by SEM. The volumetric capacities of electrodes were determined by using the coating densities coupled with the corresponding gravimetric capacities. A Celgard 2400 microporous polypropylene membrane was used as the separator. 1 M LiPF6 in an ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate–diethyl carbonate (EC–DMC–DEC) mixture (3:4:3 v/v/v) provided by PANAX ETEC Co., Ltd. (Korea) was used as the electrolyte. The cells were assembled in an argon-filled globe box. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were carried out over the potential range of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li+/Li at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The cells were galvanostatically cycled in the voltage range of 3.0–0.01 V (2.0–0.005 V for graphite) vs. Li+/Li at 100 mA g−1 for the initial three cycles and then at 200 mA g−1 for the remaining cycles using a galvanostat/potentiostat battery testing system (WonATech, Korea). The rate performance of MnOx/OMC was investigated at different current densities in the range of 100–5000 mA g−1.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of OMC nanorods and MnOx/OMC. By using OMS (ordered mesoporous silica) nanorods as a template,25 the OMC replicas were of nanorod-shape with average dimensions of around 1.2 μm × 0.15 μm which can offer a higher packed-density (a high energy-density as an electrode) than the conventional OMCs of larger dimensions. The apparent morphology of OMC was mostly retained after MnOx loading as seen in Fig. 1b.

The physical properties of OMC nanorods determined by the BET measurement at liquid nitrogen temperature are as follows; BET surface area = 787 m2 g−1, BJH average pore size = 3.7 nm and total pore volume = 0.87 cm3 g−1. Thus, the OMC nanorods possessed desirable morphology and physical properties as an ideal support for metal oxides. The enhanced electrical conductivity of OMC nanorods derived from phenanthrene as a carbon source compared to the conventional OMCs8,9,22,23 derived from sucrose is also expected to improve electrochemical performances in a Li-ion battery as demonstrated in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) application.26
To prepare MnOx/OMC nanorods, an aqueous Mn precursor solution was loaded onto OMC by a pore-filling wet-impregnation followed by drying and thermal annealing in an Ar atmosphere (Scheme 1). This is exactly the reverse process of carbon coating of nanomaterials commonly employed to prepare metal/C or metal oxides/C nanocomposites for lithium battery applications. This process allows one to avoid separate synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures, time-consuming and difficult subsequent multi-step processes including purification, handling of nanomaterials and their homogenous carbon coating processes afterwards.11 The as-prepared MnOx/OMC was first characterized by X-ray diffraction to identify the manganese oxide phase and the diffraction pattern is presented in Fig. 2a. All the major diffraction peaks could be indexed to the tetragonal Mn3O4 structure consistent with the JCPDS data (no. 24-0734) with a small portion of MnO (JCPDS no. 07-0230) impurity phase marked with an asterisk.

Fig. 2b presents the TGA profiles of the MnOx/OMC sample up to 800 °C in an airflow. The profile displayed a weight loss from 350 °C to 510 °C due to carbon combustion. From the weight change between 150 °C and 510 °C, the carbon content was determined to be 31.6 wt% and thus the balance, i.e., 68.4 wt%, was assumed to be MnOx. This value is very close to the target loading (70.0 wt%) of the Mn precursor as Mn3O4 on OMC, indicating a relatively precise control of the loading amount of manganese oxides by the pore-filling wet-impregnation method. Due to the highly mesoporous nature of OMC nanorods, an MnOx content as high as 68.4 wt% can be achieved by this simple process of pore-filling wet-impregnation followed by thermal treatment in an Ar flow.

Fig. 3 shows the morphologies of OMC and MnOx/OMC examined by TEM. In the TEM images of bare OMC nanorods shown in Fig. 3a, the nano-channels about 4 nm in size were clearly observed. On the other hand, the channels were mostly stained with MnOx nanocrystals as discernible by dark images along the channels and large particles were also observed on the external surfaces (Fig. 3b and c). The high magnification TEM image of MnOx/OMC in Fig. 3d shows Mn3O4 nanocrystals of 3–6 nm and the lattice d-spacings of 4.88 Å and 2.47 Å corresponding to (101) and (211) planes of Mn3O4 are identified. Hence, the initial portions of pore-filling wet-impregnation of Mn precursor solution were preferentially absorbed into the mesopores of OMC by capillary action and MnOx nanocrystals were mostly formed in the confined pores of OMC after annealing. The latter portions of impregnation could result in larger particles (∼30 nm) being formed on the external surfaces but trapped in the macropores between OMC nanorod stacks after thermal annealing (Fig. 3b). From the Scherrer's formula with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (112) peak in Fig. 2a, the average particle size was estimated to be 17.25 nm.

The mesostructures of samples were investigated by small angle XRD and BET measurements. In the small angle XRD patterns (see ESI, Fig. S1†), the intense peak (100) and two weaker peaks (110) and (200), which are associated with the 2D hexagonal mesostructure with the P6mm space group of OMC,26 were absent in MnOx/OMC. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption hysteresis between the P/P0 range of 0.4 and 0.7 for OMC was merely observed for MnOx/OMC (Fig. S2†). Concomitantly, the BET surface area (178 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (0.16 cm3 g−1) of MnOx/OMC were substantially decreased compared to those of bare OMC (Table S1†). The MnOx/OMC was then subjected to HCl etching to remove MnOx in MnOx/OMC. After the HCl etching, the mesostructure OMC was hardly recovered (Fig. S1–S3 and Table S1†) but the OMC morphology was mostly retained with appreciable BET surface area (591 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (0.44 cm3 g−1) (Table S1†). These indicate that there is no mesostructural ordering in MnOx/OMC after incorporation of manganese oxide nanocrystals. The similar observations were reported previously with a much lower loading of CoO (25 wt%)8 and NiO (36.6 wt%)9 on CMK-3 than on MnOx/OMC. The results support that a large portion of small MnOx nanocrystals occupy the mesopores of OMC, which may partly destroy the ordered structure of OMC during the thermal annealing.8 Fair amounts of large MnOx nanocrystals (∼30 nm) are also formed on the external surface of OMC (Fig. 3b) due to the heavy MnOx loading on MnOx/OMC.
The surface chemical composition of MnOx/OMC was further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the result is shown in Fig. 4. The main peaks observed in the spectra were C1s (284.6 eV), O1s (530.2 eV) and Mn2p. The values of binding energies obtained for Mn2p3/2 and Mn2p1/2 were located at 641.5 and 652.9 eV, respectively. Both the binding energies and the FWHM of Mn2p3/2 (2.90 eV) and O1s (1.68 eV) peaks were very close to those of bulk Mn3O4.27–29 A small peak from N1s (400.3 eV) was also detected due to nitrogen incorporated into the OMC structure during its synthesis. Thus, Mn3O4 was the dominant phase of manganese oxides in the sample.

The electrochemical properties of bare OMC nanorods and MnOx/OMC were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic cycling test with a Li-ion half-cell. Fig. 5 shows the cyclic voltammetry curves of MnOx/OMC for the initial three cycles between 3.0 and 0.01 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Three reduction peaks were observed in the first cathodic process. Two small peaks at 1.35 V and 0.75 V observed in the first cathodic scan disappeared in the subsequent cycles suggesting irreversible Li+ reactions with carbon and metal oxides, and decomposition of the electrolyte solvent forming a solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) film.13,14 The third strong spiky peak at 0.2 V could be attributed to the reduction of Mn3+ and Mn2+ to Mn0, and the obvious peak was shifted to 0.4 V in the subsequent cycles possibly due to electrode polarization caused by a partly irreversible phase transformation between polycrystalline Mn3O4 and the Li2O/Mn nanocomposite as observed in the MnO/C system.30,31 The voltage–current curve after the first cycle almost overlapped indicating an excellent electrochemical reversibility of MnOx nanocrystals in OMC nanorods.
 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms of MnOx/OMC for the initial three cycles scanned at 0.1 mV s−1 in the range of 3.0–0.01 V Li+/Li. 
In the anodic process, one main peak was recorded at around 1.3 V and a weak peak at 2.1 V, corresponding to the oxidation of Mn0 to Mn2+/Mn3+, and the decomposition of the SEI layer at high oxidation potential above 2.0 V,30 respectively. Both the currents and the integrated areas of the oxidation peaks at 1.3 V remained stable and overlap after the first cycle. Overall, the voltages for the anodic process (1.3 V) are much higher than the cathodic ones (0.4 V) giving a voltage difference of 0.9 V in the MnOx/OMC. The voltage hysteresis between oxidation and reduction is commonly observed in transition metal oxides3,7,8,11,16,17,24,31 and can be attributed to the poor kinetics of the heterogeneous reactions involving three solid-state components: Mn3O4, Mn0, and Li2O.

Fig. 6 presents voltage profiles of OMC and MnOx/OMC for the initial three cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. For bare OMC nanorods, a large voltage hysteresis between the charge–discharge process, i.e., around 1.5 V at half the capacities of charge–discharge curves, exists without distinct potential plateaus (Fig. 6a), which are typically observed with ordered mesoporous carbons.8,22 The first discharge and charge capacities of bare OMC nanorods were 1395 and 865 mAh g−1, respectively, corresponding to a superior CE of 62.0% compared to the typical literature values of 30–46%.8,9,22 The voltage profiles of MnOx/OMC nanorods for the first three cycles are shown in Fig. 6b. During the first discharge, the voltage dropped quickly down to 1.3 V and a sloping voltage was observed from 1.3 V to 0.3 V. Different from OMC nanorods, a distinct voltage plateau was observed at 0.3 V followed by a downward sloping voltage profile between 0.3 and 0.01 V due to complete reduction of Mn3+/Mn2+ to Mn0 and interfacial lithium storage.13,32 The voltage plateau was shifted to 0.5 V in the subsequent discharge profiles due to electrode polarization as observed in the CV curve in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 6  Charge–discharge profiles of (a) bare OMC nanorods and (b) MnOx/OMC at 100 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V Li+/Li. 
The first discharge and charge capacities were 1190 and 910 mAh g−1, respectively, accounting for the irreversible capacity loss (Cirrev) of 280 mAh g−1 and the CE of 76.5% at the first cycle. As noticed in the first cathodic CV scan in Fig. 5 as well as in the first discharge voltage curve at 1.3–0.3 V in Fig. 6b, the first irreversible capacity loss should be related to the formation of SEI layers on the surface of carbon and MnOx nanocrystals. After the first discharge, the sloping voltages from 1.3–0.5 V were recorded reversibly in the subsequent cycles mainly due to reduction from Mn3+ to Mn2+ similarly observed in Mn3O4 (ref. 13) and Fe3O4 (ref. 11) of spinel structures but were absent or merely observed in MnO based electrodes.31,33 In the charge profiles, sloping plateaus at around 1.3 V and weak short plateaus at around 2.1 V were recorded, corresponding to the oxidative conversion reaction between Mn and Li2O, and reversible SEI decomposition,30 respectively, in accordance with the anodic CV scan in Fig. 5. MnOx/OMC possesses the operating voltages, i.e., 1.3 V on oxidation and 0.5 V on reduction, corresponding to a voltage hysteresis of around 0.8 V. Importantly, the lower operating voltage of MnOx/OMC than those of other transition metal oxides (iron oxides, cobalt oxides, etc.) can provide a real lithium battery cell with a wider operating voltage range and thus a higher energy density. The voltage hysteresis of MnOx/OMC is lower than those of bare OMC nanorods (1.5 V) and other transition metal oxides11,34 which could be an additional benefit for real battery cell operation. For reference, the voltage hysteresis of graphite was less than 0.2 V (Fig. S4†).
The reversible Li storage capacity of MnOx/OMC can be estimated as follows based on the theoretical capacities of Mn3O4 and MnO (936 mAh g−1 by Mn3O4 + 8Li ↔ 3Mn + 4Li2O, 756 mAh g−1 by MnO + 2Li ↔ Mn + Li2O), and the actual reversible capacity of bare OMC nanorods (800 mAh g−1) obtained in this study (MnO content in MnOx is assumed to be 10.0 wt%): (936 mAh g−1 × 0.684 × 0.9 + 756 mAh g−1 × 0.684 × 0.1) + 800 mAh g−1 × 0.316 = 881 mAh g−1. However, the actual reversible capacity of MnOx/OMC (910–950 mAh g−1 for the initial three cycles) was slightly higher than the expected one possibly due to additional interfacial lithium storage in the Mn and Li2O nanograins32,33 corresponding to the sloping voltage profiles close to ∼0 V.

Fig. 7a shows the cycling performances of OMC nanorods and MnOx/OMC, tested between 0.01 and 3.0 V at a current density of 100 mA g−1 for the initial three cycles and then at 200 mA g−1 up to 50 cycles. For bare OMC nanorods, the first discharge and charge capacities were 1390 and 860 mAh g−1, respectively, corresponding to a CE of 61.8%. The CE was maintained at above 96% after the first cycle. Capacity fading was seen up to 12 cycles but no significant capacity loss was observed up to 50 cycles and the reversible capacity was remained at 766 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles, which was still more than twice the capacity of commercial graphite.

MnOx/OMC also exhibited an excellent cycling stability up to 50 cycles and presented a reversible specific capacity gain over OMC nanorods by 30% (i.e., 996 mAh g−1 for MnOx/OMC vs. 766 mAh g−1 for OMC nanorods at the 50th cycle), which was another synergistic benefit of incorporating MnOx into OMC nanorods. MnOx/OMC showed about three times the specific capacity of graphite. Hence, both forward and reverse conversion reactions, MnOx + 2xLi ↔ Mn + xLi2O, were effectively carried out in the 3D pore structures of OMC nanorods. The volumetric capacity of an electrode is also an important factor for small battery packs. For this purpose, the actual coating thicknesses of graphite, bare OMC and MnOx/OMC were measured by SEM (Table S2 and Fig. S5†). The volumetric capacities of electrodes were determined by accounting for the coating densities coupled with corresponding specific capacities. As compared in Fig. 7b, the MnOx/OMC can offer about twice the volumetric capacities of OMC nanorods and about three times that of graphite, respectively, due to the high-density MnOx loading on the mesoporous OMC nanorods. This is a noticeable synergistic benefit of MnOx incorporation into the highly mesoporous OMC nanorods. Of particular note is that OMC nanorods also exhibited about twice the specific and volumetric capacities of commercial graphite. The advanced performance of OMC nanorods for Li storage could be attributed to the combined effects of nanostructured morphology,25 enhanced electrical conductivity attained by employing phenanthrene as the carbon source and nitrogen incorporation during its synthesis process.26 A separate study is underway to get a better understanding of the role of nitrogen incorporated into the OMC structure and of the superior Li storage characteristics in the OMC nanorods to other ordered mesoporous carbons in the literature.8,22,35,36
The rate capability of MnOx/OMC was evaluated at various current densities in the range of 100–5000 mA g−1 at the cut-off voltage between 0.01 and 3.0 V Li+/Li, and the results are given in Fig. 8 in comparison to those of OMC and graphite. The discharge capacities were retained at ∼1000, 845–900, and 730–790 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 100–200, 500 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. Even at the current density as high as 2000 mA g−1, MnOx/OMC still delivered over 500 mA h g−1 which could be one of the highest capacities reported in the literature at similar current densities. However, the capacity was rapidly faded down to 140 mA h g−1 at the higher current density of 5000 mA g−1 possibly due to rather poor kinetics associated with electrochemical conversion reaction at this high current. However, when the current was restored back to 100 mA g−1, the initial capacity of MnOx/OMC was completely retained indicating an excellent reversibility of MnOx/OMC due to the 3D open nanostructure of OMC nanorods and its unique morphology. Bare OMC nanorods also exhibited high rate capability and reversibility mainly due to its 3D open mesostructure. In contrast, the commercial graphite showed very poor rate performances at current densities above 500 mA g−1 (Fig. S6†) indicating a low intrinsic Li intercalation rate into its lattice crystal structure (d = 3.35 Å).

As demonstrated here, MnOx nanocrystals with Mn3O4 as a major phase can be formed in situ in the pore structures of OMC nanorods by a simple pore-filling wet-impregnation of Mn(NO3)2 aqueous solution followed by thermal treatment at a moderate temperature in an inert atmosphere. This synthetic approach could be highly efficient for the large-scale production of MnOx/C and the stable cycling of fast-fading free Mn3O4 nanoparticles.13 For reference, MnOx/OMC exhibited higher capacity especially at high current density (i.e., 550–600 mA h g−1 based on the mass of MnOx/OMC at 2000 mA g−1vs. 390–400 mA h g−1 based on the mass of Mn3O4 (90 wt%) in the Mn3O4/RGO at 1600 mA g−1), and showed higher efficiency at the first cycle (i.e., 76.5% for MnOx/OMC vs. 68.2% for Mn3O4/RGO) than Mn3O4 nanoparticles anchored on RGO by two-step processes.13 Thus prepared MnOx/OMC nanocomposite also showed many beneficial synergies over OMC nanorods as an anode for Li-ion batteries. The reversible specific capacity was improved by 30% and an excellent cycling performance was achieved by incorporating MnOx nanocrystals into OMC nanorods. And the redox voltage hysteresis of ∼1.5 V in OMC nanorods was lowered to ∼0.8 V in MnOx/OMC. The MnOx/OMC also exhibited about 2–3 times higher volumetric capacity than bare OMC nanorods and a commercial graphite due to the intrinsic high density of MnOx. Thus MnOx/OMC showed promising electrochemical properties as a high capacity LIB anode.
Conclusions
In summary, a nanostructured OMC replicated from OMS nanorods was loaded with MnOx (major phase of Mn3O4 with a small portion of MnO) nanocrystals by a pore-filling wet-impregnation of Mn(NO3)2 aqueous solution followed by thermal treatment at a moderate temperature in an Ar flow. The mesostructure of OMC was partly destroyed by the in situ growth of MnOx nanocrystals in OMC while the morphological integrity of OMC was mostly retained. The as-prepared MnOx/OMC exhibited the theoretical conversion capacity of MnOx with excellent cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency mainly due to the 3D open nanostructure and conducting environment provided by OMC nanorods. The incorporation of insulating and high density MnOx into OMC nanorods exhibited synergistic benefits including higher volumetric as well as specific capacities, and smaller redox voltage hysteresis than OMC nanorods. The MnOx/OMC also possessed about three times higher volumetric as well as specific capacities and greater rate capability than graphite. Thus MnOx/OMC showed highly attractive electrochemical properties as anodes for Li-ion batteries.
