    , Accepted 10th March 2020First published on 11th March 2020AbstractNon-fullerene acceptors, especially acceptor–donor–acceptor structured fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), have attracted widespread attention in organic solar cells because of their versatile molecular design in fine-tuning light absorption and energy levels. We report the accuracy of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) for FREAs by comparing their theoretically predicted vertical absorption wavelength (λver-abso) with the experimental maximum absorption (λmax). The λver-abso values of 50 molecules obtained from major types of FREAs have been investigated using TD-DFT by considering the solvent effects. The values of λver-abso predicted with a pure density functional (PBE), global hybrids (B3LYP and PBE0) and range-separated schemes (CAM-B3LYP and LC-ωPBE) follow the exact exchange percentage included at an intermediate inter-electronic distance. Global hybrids outperform all other schemes. The mean absolute error provided is 22 nm by PBE0 and 38 nm by B3LYP for the whole set of molecules. The maximum deviation of 92 nm provided by B3LYP and 69 nm provided by PBE0 confirms that PBE0 is more appropriate for predicting the absorption wavelengths when designing new FREAs. By applying linear regression analysis to obtain the calibration curve, we found that the range-separated methods provide an equal or even more consistent description of FREA excited states. For the whole set of molecules, linearly corrected data yield an average error of 25 and 27 nm for CAM-B3LYP and LC-ωPBE, respectively. Consequently, when a statistical analysis technique is applicable for a certain series of FREAs, a theoretical method permits a chemically comprehensive and empirically good explanation of UV/Vis spectra for newly-designed FREAs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk-heterojunctions have gained much attention as a renewable clean energy technology due to their advantages of easy solution processing, light weight, and flexibility.1 Typically, OSCs are fabricated by sandwiching a light-absorbing active layer (a blend of electron donor/acceptor) between a cathode and an anode.2–6 The active layer absorbs sunlight to generate excitons, which dissociate into free charge carriers at the donor–acceptor (D–A) interface and then move towards the electrodes. Prodigious efforts devoted to material design and device engineering have pushed the power conversion efficiency up to 16% for a single junction and 17% for tandem OSCs.7–9
At present, OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have become the research focus as compared with their fullerene-based counterparts, mainly attributed to their easy synthesis/purification, better device stability, and enhanced light absorption. Among the families of NFAs, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have made tremendous progress due to their versatile structure modification to achieve excellent light absorption and tunable energy levels.10–12 A large library of FREAs has been reported for efficient OSCs, from which a set of 50 representative molecules has been considered (with their corresponding chemical structures shown in Fig. 1–4). The categorization of molecules has been carried out on the basis of the number of fused rings in the electron-donating core, which is a widely-used classification strategy in the current literature.13

Tricyclic FREAs featuring three-fused-ring electron-donating cores have the smallest size among all molecules considered here in this work (Fig. 1). Seven of them have fluorene as the donor core, F(DPP)2B2,14 F8IDT,15 FEHIDT,15 Flu-RH,16 FBM,17 DICTF,18 and FRd2.19 Cz-RH,16 DBS-2DPP,20 CDTBM,17 and ITDI21 have carbazole dibenzosilole, cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and indenothiophene as electron-donating cores, respectively. The spacer units are π-bridges, thiophene, and benzothiadiazole. The electron-accepting end-groups mainly include diketopyrrolopyrrole, 2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-1,3-dione, 3-ethylrhodanine and dicyanovinyl.
Most pentacyclic FREAs studied here in this work adopt the indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit as the electron-donating core (Fig. 2) such as IEICO,22 IEICO-4F,23 IC-IDT-IC,24 DC-IDT2T,25 IDT-BC6,26 IDT-BOC6,26 IFBR-d,27 ATT-1,28 ATT-2,29 ITOIC-2F,30 IDT-2B,31 IDT-2O,31 and IDT-OB.31 IDT as the representative donor core for A–D–A type pentacyclic FREAs boasts a coplanar and rigid structure for wide absorption and high charge mobility.13 The spacer units introduced between the central core and end-groups are mainly thiophene, alkyl-substituted benzene, alkoxyl substituted thiophene, benzothiadiazole, and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene. The mostly introduced A units include 3-ethylrhodanine, 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene) rhodanine and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone. The heptacyclic FREAs considered here in this study are mostly based on indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) as the D core and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) as the A end-group (Fig. 3). The nonacyclic FREAs have 9-fused-ring electron-donating cores, as shown in Fig. 4.
Density functional theory (DFT) is the most commonly used computational tool for the study of electronic structures to understand the ground as well as the excited state properties of OSC materials. The extension of DFT, i.e., the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), permits the computation of emission and absorption spectra. The elucidation helps to investigate the exciton transport and charge-recombination processes in OSC devices. Therefore, TD-DFT is most widely used for modeling emission and absorption spectra of organic molecules.32
TD-DFT simulation may include solvent cavity effects and rapidly generate ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) spectra for most of the organic photovoltaic materials.33–37 Both the performance and the cost of DFT and TD-DFT calculations are immensely influenced by the selection of an approximate exchange–correlation (XC) functional. The global hybrid functionals that contain a fixed fraction of Hartree–Fock-like (HF) exact exchange such as B3LYP (20%),38 PBE0 (25%),39 or M06 (27%)40 are used as distinctive workhorses for electronic-structure theory of organic materials. These functionals sometimes show qualitative failures for numerous electronic properties of organic materials due to their many-electron self-interaction errors41,42 or localization/delocalization errors. To tackle these problems, long-range corrected (abbreviated as LR or LC) functionals have been developed such as LC-ωPBE, CAM-B3LYP, etc.
Numerous studies have been reported on reproducing the experimental UV/Vis spectra and investigating the 0–0 energies of organic and inorganic materials using the global and range-separated hybrids.43–46 Nguyen et al. investigated the maximum vertical absorption wavelength (λver-abso) for four coumarin dyes and found that global hybrids provided more accurate results than range-separated hybrids.47 Jacquemin et al. reported the π → π* transition of 15 anthraquinone dyes and concluded that the theoretical/experimental deviation is larger for range-separated hybrids but less statistical dispersion is produced allowing further useful chemical insights.48 Jacquemin et al. also reported a comparison study of experimentally determined maximum absorption (λmax) and theoretically predicted λver-abso values for a set of more than 100 organic dyes applying HF and TD-DFT with LR and global hybrids. They found that PBE0 performed well and the mean absolute error (MAE) was 22 nm with maximum deviation less than 100 nm for all dyes.49 M. Dierksen and S. Grimme presented a TD-DFT study of excited-state molecular structures. The 0–0 energies were calculated with different functionals to find that the vibronic structure strictly depended on the exact-exchange fraction included in a hybrid functional used.50 B. Durbeej et al. reported a TD-DFT investigation of 0–0 energies using various density functionals as well as different ab initio methods considering 96 excited states of a set of 79 molecules containing both organic and inorganic materials.51 By applying several methods along with TD-DFT, a comparison study on excited states (i.e., absorption, emission, adiabatic, and 0–0 energies) was recently reported for 80 real-life molecules.52 Recently, Suellen et al. reported a benchmark study for 41 electronic transitions in small and medium-sized organic compounds using different TD-DFT and wave function theory approaches. They found that absorption energies could be best estimated with TD-DFT as compared with fluorescence and adiabatic energies.53 To the best of our knowledge, the TD-DFT accuracy in simulating the absorption spectra of advanced FREAs using global and range-separated hybrids has not been reported so far for the molecular design of such materials.
In this paper, we report a critical evaluation of the TD-DFT performance in predicting λver-abso values of an extended set of FREAs using global and range-separated hybrids. The set of 50 FREAs has been categorized into four groups. The molecules in Fig. 1–4 cover the major types of A–D–A FREAs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply TD-DFT for modeling such an extended set of FREAs. The set of molecules was designed to include major types of FREAs reported recently to be substantial for real research in the field of OSCs. The performance of range-separated approaches was evaluated, aiming to provide good guidance for theoreticians towards more rational design of organic photovoltaic materials. Our critical prediction of λver-abso values using the aforementioned different schemes may provide an insight into the performance of these levels of TD-DFT in modeling FREAs.
2. Theory and computational procedures
Our objective is to evaluate the performance of pure, global hybrid and range-separated functionals for predicting the absorption spectra of an extended set of FREAs. Therefore, we have used two global hybrids, two range separated hybrids of different approaches and one pure density functional called the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)54 functional. The employed global hybrids are B3LYP38 and PBE039 having 20 and 25% HF-like exact exchange, respectively. The two range-separated hybrid functionals used are LC-ωPBE by Vydrov and Scuseria55 and CAM-B3LYP (CAM-B3LYP: the Coulomb-attenuating method employed to B3LYP) by Handy.56 The key advantage of LC-ωPBE is that it is the exact asymptote of the exchange potential as compared to the global hybrids. The value of the range separation parameter ω in LC-ωPBE and CAM-B3LYP is 0.4 and 0.33 Bohr−1, respectively. CAM-B3LYP consists of 0.19 HF with 0.81 Becke's 1988 (B88) exchange interaction in the short-range, and 0.65 HF plus 0.35 B88 in the long-range. The intermediate region is smoothly described through a standard error function with a parametric value of 0.33. All the DFT and TD-DFT calculations have been performed with Gaussian 09 software.57 The alkyl chains of all molecules have been simplified into methyl groups before optimization in order to save the simulation time, which is the same strategy used in the literature with no change in the optical properties of molecules.52,58 The optimized ground state chemical geometries have been found for each molecule through a standard process of force-minimization. All the vibrational frequencies have been confirmed and no imaginary frequency has been found. All of the ground-state geometry optimization calculations have been carried out using the PBE0 functional with a double-ζ basis set 6-31G(d,p) containing one polarization function on a hydrogen atom and one on other atoms. The same basis set has been employed to perform the absorption spectrum simulation, since this basis set has been shown to provide consistent electronic trends between theoretically predicted and available experimental data for OSCs.58–60 The PBE0 functional is known for producing optimized ground-state chemical geometries for most organic molecules.61–63 The optimized chemical geometries for the whole set of molecules are given in the ESI.† All the DFT and TD-DFT calculations have been performed in the same solvent as used for the experiment (see Table S1 in the ESI†). The simulation process is summarized in Scheme S1 (see in the ESI†). The Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM)64 is a commonly used model to consider the solvent effects for excited states of organic compounds. A recent study using the PCM computed the absorption, emission, adiabatic and 0–0 energies of 80 real-life compounds, showing the performance of the PCM in describing the excited states of organic compounds.52 Therefore, the solvent effects were taken into account using the PCM approach to give realistic TD-DFT performance for FREA design. Accounting for the solution cavity is very crucial for real-time simulation and significant theoretical/experimental comparisons. The standard non-equilibrium protocol for TD-DFT computation has been selected and particularly developed for the absorption study.37,43–45,50 For a perfect match of simulation spectra with experimental ones, the vibronic couplings are needed. The computation of the Frank-Condon factors for polyatomic molecules makes the perfect match possible between simulation and experimental results.65–67 However, this analysis is not computationally feasible for A–D–A structured FREAs due to the large sizes as well as the extended set of these molecules. Due to these limitations, the approximation used here in this study is vertical approximation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Comparisons with experiment
The λver-abso values calculated for the whole set of compounds using PCM-TD-X/6-31G(d,p) strictly obey the order LC-ωPBE < CAM-B3LYP < PBE0 < B3LYP < PBE. This shows that the value of λver-abso has an inverse trend with the exact exchange ratio at an intermediate inter-electronic distance. This conclusion is exactly in agreement with the order followed by the λver-abso values of organic dyes reported by D. Jacquemin and his coworkers.49
The predicted λver-abso values for 11 tricyclic A–D–A type FREAs are compared with their experimental data in Table 1. The λver-abso values simulated through the PBE0 functional are in better agreement with the experiment ones. The B3LYP trends also show a good agreement with the experimental data but the deviations are much larger than those produced by PBE0. For instance, the PBE0 functional gives the smallest absolute error of 13 nm for F(DPP)2B2, while the B3LYP functional gives the smallest absolute error of 42 nm for DBS-2DPP. Interestingly, the magnitudes of errors from PBE0 and B3LYP follow a similar trend for the individual compound: when the former hybrid gives a larger absolute error for a specific molecule (59 nm for FBM, and 62 nm for CDTBM), the latter will also produce a larger absolute error for that compound (92 nm for both FBM and CDTBM) but with a larger deviation. The range-separated functional CAM-B3LYP performs well with a maximum absolute error not more than 86 nm for ITDI and a minimum of 33 nm for FBM.

The calculated mean signed error (MSE) for PBE0, B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, PBE, and LC-ωPBE is −30, −60, 53, −243, and 105 nm, respectively. The corresponding MAEs are 30, 60, 53, 243 and 105 nm. These results indicate that PBE severely overestimates the value of λver-abso, while LC-ωPBE underestimates it. Consistent with the findings in the literature49 for other organic molecules, PBE0 generated simulation values much closer to the experimental values with MAE equal to or less than half of those produced by other competitors, i.e., CAM-B3LYP and B3LYP. The experimental ∼20 nm bathochromic shift from FEHIDT to F8IDT is successfully reproduced by all theoretical models, but more accurately predicted by PBE0 (19 nm) and B3LYP (20 nm). All the functionals yield an accurate validation CDTBM > ITDI except PBE. FRd2 > FluRH is valid for all functionals except LC-ωPBE, while Cz-RH > FBM is only valid for LC-ωPBE. All functionals provide correct validation for F(DPP)2B2 > DBS-2DPP in Table 1, while none of them performs well for F8IDT > FRd2. Importantly, for three FREAs (Flu-RH, Cz-RH, and FEHIDT) with the same experimental λmax (500 nm), all functionals follow the same order of Flu-RH > Cz-RH > FEHIDT, as shown in Table 1.

Table 2 lists the theoretical λver-abso values for 20 different pentacyclic FREAs against their experimental λmax values. PBE0 provides the best performance, providing a maximum deviation of 43 nm for IFBR-d and zero (MSE = 0) for IDTOT2F and also giving just -1 MSE for ATT-2. For all other molecules, PBE0 also shows excellent agreement between the theoretically predicted λver-abso values and experimentally detected λmax data, indicating a convincing prediction performance. The B3LYP method also performs well, giving a smaller difference between λmax and λver-abso for most of the molecules; e.g., a maximum deviation limited to −92 MSE for IFBR-d and minimum of 8 for SiIDT-IC. B3LYP performs better for pentacyclic rather than tricyclic FREAs while the performance of range separated functionals drops for pentacyclic FREAs. Therefore, the performance variance between the λver-abso values simulated with range separated and global hybrid methods increases. We got a MAE of 39, 16, 116, 241, and 185 nm for B3LYP, PBE0, CAM-B3LYP, PBE, and LC-ωPBE, respectively. The MSE is −36, 0.2, 116, −241 and 185 nm for B3LYP, PBE0, CAM-B3LYP, PBE, and LC-ωPBE, respectively. PBE0 shows the smallest MSE (0.2 nm) and MAE (16 nm). All approaches account pretty well for the red-shift in λver-abso value in response to fluorine atom substitution to the end group of IEICO to produce IEICO-4F. But, in some cases, the global hybrids and range-separated functionals exhibit completely different performance. The B3LYP and PBE0 methods fail to predict the bathochromic shift in absorption spectra from IDT-OB to IDT-2O, while range-separated functionals are able to do so. Cases could also be noted in which B3LYP and PBE0 yield a good prediction of red-shift in absorption spectra. Finally, no functional follows the molecular experimental order from top to bottom for all molecules. B3LYP and PBE0 have the same behavior in following the molecular order for all molecules and are most efficient as compared to other approaches. Accurate validation like IEICO-4F > IDT-BC6 could also be detected for the whole set of functionals.

Table 3 reports the theoretical λver-abso and experimental λmax values for 12 heptacyclic FREAs. The λver-abso values calculated with the global hybrids are in better agreement with the experimental λmax for all molecules. The maximum absolute deviation for B3LYP and PBE0 is 57 and 31 nm for BT-IC and ITVffIC, respectively. These deviations are less than their comparative values, i.e., 92 nm by B3LYP, 62 and 43 nm by PBE0 for tricyclic and pentacyclic FREAs, respectively. It can be seen from statistical data that for the heptacyclic FREAs, the MSE is −24, 11, 120, −205 and 185 nm for B3LYP, PBE0, CAM-B3LYP, PBE, and LC-ωPBE, respectively. These results indicate that the PBE overestimates while the range separated approaches systematically underestimate the λver-abso values when compared with the experimental λmax. All functionals give an accurate experimental validation IT-M > IT-DM and predict the red-shift except PBE. In the case of ITIC-Cl and ITIC-Br, the global hybrids and PBE perform well to predict the red-shift while the range-separated functionals fail to do so. The MAE provided by CAM-B3LYP (120 nm) shows that its performance for heptacyclic FREAs is comparable to that for pentacyclic FREAs (MAE = 116 nm).

Table 4 lists the experimental λmax and calculated λver-abso values for a set of 7 FREAs bearing a 9-fused-ring electron-donating core. The PBE and LC-ωPBE respectively deliver the largest and smallest λver-abso values for nonacyclic FREAs, while the global hybrids provide middle λver-abso values directly proportional to the XC ratio. From Table 5, the MSE value is −2, 38, 156, −214 and 220 nm for B3LYP, PBE0, CAM-B3LYP, PBE, and LC-ωPBE, respectively. The corresponding MAE value is 26, 38, 156, 214 and 220 nm. The B3LYP method is more efficient than all others to give the least MSE and MAE, while PBE0 is the second best. All functionals can successfully but qualitatively predict the experimental red-shifts in wavelength going from IPIC to IPIC-4F and IPIC-4Cl. The experimental bathochromic shift observed when going from INIC to INIC2 (12 nm) is successfully provided by the global hybrids (14 nm by B3LYP and 13 nm by PBE0), while the range-separated functionals underestimate it and PBE overestimates it. It can be seen from the experimental data that λmax does not change between INIC1 and INIC3. The same behavior is shown by the global hybrids for the λver-abso value while all other functionals fail to do so.

The global hybrids perform quantitatively well for the first vertical excitation energy of FREAs with a strong A group as compared to range separated hybrids when applying the linear response TD-DFT and using the vertical absorption approximation. To investigate this effect, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) were obtained for the CDTBM molecule shown in Fig. S1 (see the ESI†) using different functionals including B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, PBE and PBE0. All the molecular orbitals have nearly the same shape with HOMO–LUMO overlaps. To uncover the performance of global and range-separated functionals for through-space charge transfer (CT) analysis, we qualitatively computed the CT magnitude for a subset of 20 FREAs using the T. Le Bahers approach.85,86 This method is based on the electron density difference between the ground and excited states. The amount of CT for 20 FREAs computed with B3LYP, PBE0, CAM-B3LYP and PBE is summarized in Table S2 (see in the ESI†). It is very clear that CAM-B3LYP performs well for CT as compared to the non-asymptotically corrected XC functionals (PBE, PBE0 and B3LYP). However, CAM-B3LYP is not able to provide a quantitative estimate for λmax, at least in the vertical approximation (see Table S3 in the ESI†). The CT strength follows the order CAM-B3LYP > PBE0 > B3LYP > PBE. The theoretical vertical excitation energy (Table S4 in the ESI†) obtained with different functionals obeys the same order as the CT does. The signed errors are obtained by subtracting the theoretical vertical excitation from the experimental one. It can be seen from Table S4 (ESI†) that a functional will show more negative deviation (overestimates the excitation energy) with more CT strength. The difference in ground and excited state electron densities for CDTBM is also shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The electron density depletion zones (clear blue in Fig. S2, ESI†) are mostly located on the D group while the regions of density increase (dark blue in Fig. S2, ESI†) are more localized on the A moieties.
3.2 Statistical analysis and corrections
Statistical analysis for the results of the FREAs is presented in Table 5. The MSEs and MAEs obtained from actual and linearly corrected data for the whole set of FREAs are plotted in Fig. 5a and b. The relationship between experimental and unmodified calculated data is represented by the determination coefficient (R2). Fig. 5c shows the comparison between R2 values for all functionals in simulating the whole set of molecules. The graphical linear correction assessments for both global and range-separated hybrids are presented for the whole set of molecules (Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI†). It is very clear that PBE overestimates the experimental value by −229 nm, while LC-ωPBE underestimates it by 172 nm on average for the whole set of FREAs (Table 5). The corresponding MAEs are 229 and 172 nm, as shown in Fig. 5a. Table 5 clearly shows that the global hybrid functionals perform significantly better for all subsets of molecules. Compared with B3LYP for individual subsets, PBE0 performs better for tricyclic and pentacyclic FREAs, and equally for the heptacyclic FREAs, while B3LYP exhibits less MSE (−2 nm) and MAE (26 nm) for nonacyclic FREAs (Table 5). But, for the whole set of molecules, PBE0 performs better as compared to B3LYP. On average, for all 50 transitions, we obtain a MAE of 22 and 38 nm with PBE0 and B3LYP, respectively, whereas CAM-B3LYP provides a slightly larger error (Fig. 5). CAM-B3LYP performs best for tricyclic FREAs, while giving the MSE and MAE of 109 nm each for the whole set of molecules (Table 5). PBE0 exhibits a MAE of 22 nm (0.061 eV) and the root mean squared error (RMS) of 28 nm, so these values could be considered as the expected accuracy for FREA design using TD-DFT-PBE0 with the 6-31G(d, P) basis set. For B3LYP, this accuracy is 38 nm (0.108 eV) for MAE and 44 for RMS with the same basis set.
 Fig. 5  MSEs and MAEs obtained from (a) unmodified data calculated with PCM-TD/6-31G(d,p) using each functional and (b) the linearly corrected MAEs; (c) comparison of determination coefficient (R2) obtained by relating the actual data calculated with PCM-TD/6-31G(d,p) using each functional and the experimental results. 
To check the consistency between theoretical and experimental data, we performed simple linear regressions using the different sets of FREAs individually and also using the whole set (Table 5). The MAE, MSE and R2 values are compared for different methods (Fig. 5). PBE0 and B3LYP provide the highest R2 value for the whole set of FREAs, revealing the excellent relationship of the unmodified data with the experimental results. CAM-B3LYP and LC-ωPBE, however, provide comparatively lower R2 values than those provided by the global hybrids (Fig. 5c).
The as-discussed performance of range-separated hybrids in simulating existing FREAs may highlight their potential for the design of new FREAs. As shown, PBE provides much smaller correlation coefficients as compared to the global and range-separated hybrids (Fig. 5c), indicating its inappropriateness for FREA design. The linear regression analysis of results obtained by global hybrids (PBE0 and B3LYP) does not provide a larger change in MAE and RMS. The corrected data agree well with the experimental ones, as shown in Fig. S2 (see the ESI†). The R2 value obtained with the range-separated functionals is at least 0.81 (Fig. 5c), assuring the importance of such methods for FREA design. Therefore, a linear correction improves the results of the two range separated methods. Applying eqn (1) for CAM-B3LYP provides a MAE and RMS limited to 25 and 31 nm, respectively. The MAE obtained with the corrected data is more than 4 times smaller than that with the uncorrected CAM-B3LYP data, while this comparison ratio is more than 3 times for RMS. λbest = 1.4 × λCAM-B3LYP − 121.88(1) λbest = 1.64 × λLC-ωPBE − 149.73(2)
In addition, this MAE represents a 42% improvement over the raw B3LYP error while it represents a 4.5% higher improvement over the PBE0 raw data. The impact of eqn (1) is illustrated in Fig. S2 (see the ESI†) for CAM-B3LYP. The same analysis for LC-ωPBE by applying eqn (2) indicates 29% and 13% improvements in MAE and RMS over the raw B3LYP data. LC-ωPBE also maintains good accuracy near to the PBE0 raw data. The impact of eqn (2) for LC-ωPBE is also shown in Fig. S4 (see in the ESI†). It is clear from Table 5 that performing TD-DFT simulation for a specific type of FREAs and calibrating the raw data are extremely efficient since an excellent correlation coefficient and less average deviations are achieved with the range-separated hybrids. Therefore, if it is practical to get a calibration curve for a specific FREA type, the application of long-range corrected TD-DFT must lead to adequate accuracy for the design of novel FREAs.
4. Conclusions
By employing TD-DFT, we have investigated the performance of global and range-separated hybrids (GHs and RSHs) for regenerating experimental UV/Vis spectra using the vertical approximation approach for a set of 50 fused-ring electron acceptors. It was observed that the computed vertical absorption wavelength (λver-abso) values strictly follow the order LC-ωPBE < CAM-B3LYP < PBE0 < B3LYP < PBE. This order explains that the λver-abso value follows the percent amount of exact exchange included in the functional applied. For the whole set of molecules, PBE0 gives the smallest error with an average absolute value limited to 22 nm and a mean signed error of 1.34 nm. The second best GH and even more famous approach B3LYP provides a larger absolute deviation of 38 nm suggesting that PBE0 performs well for the design of FREAs. Moreover, it was found that the GHs produce maximum MSEs and MAEs for tricyclic FREAs. These deviations drop considerably for larger size molecules when applying the same functional. The GHs seem to be more efficient for larger size FREAs with larger absorption wavelengths when applying vertical approximation. The range-separated hybrid functionals cannot beat the GHs in producing the absolute λver-abso value but they can provide more consistent data for λver-abso shifts. By applying the calibration equations such as eqn (1) and (2), the accuracy of TD-DFT with long-range corrected schemes can be greatly enhanced.
This study shows that chemically sound and numerically accurate information could be collected for the design of novel FREAs if a statistical treatment is performed for a specific class. Therefore, one must be careful in applying eqn (1) and (2) given in this work as the performance of these methods varies from one to another type of molecules. This work could contribute to accurate estimations of the excited state energies in designing new FREAs for high-efficiency OSCs.
