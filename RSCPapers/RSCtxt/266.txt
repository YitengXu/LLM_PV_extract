    , Accepted 13th December 2012First published on 14th December 2012AbstractZnMn2O4 structures of various morphologies (nanorods, nanofibers, nanowebs) have been prepared via a facile electrospinning technique by a simple variation of the sintering profile, and have subsequently been employed as anodes in lithium ion battery applications. After the sintering process, as-spun nanofibers with high aspect ratio have broken into short segments of ZnMn2O4 nanorods (ZMO-NR). Incorporating an intermediate carbonization step has strengthened the mechanical integrity of as-spun nanofibers, resulting in the formation of sintered nanofibers (ZMO-NF) and nanowebs (ZMO-NW). On the basis of FESEM, HRTEM and XRD studies, the formation mechanism of nanostructures consisting of hierarchically self-assembled ZnMn2O4 nanocrystals is discussed. Particle size distribution is computed by Rietveld refinement and HRTEM micrographs, while the valence states are confirmed by XPS. The initial discharge of ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW demonstrated a high capacity of ∼1469 mA h g−1 and 1526 mA h g−1, respectively, in the voltage ranges of 0.005 V and 3.0 V versus Li/Li+ at 60 mA g−1, associated with reversible capacities of ∼705 mA h g−1 and 530 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. Morphology tuning of anodes and the importance of interconnected nanoparticulate pathways for lithium ion diffusion are elucidated.
Introduction
Fossil fuel depletion and dependence have raised environmental concerns, including air pollution and global warming.1 Renewable energy resources (e.g. solar and wind power2,3), along with suitable energy storage devices, offer strategies to alleviate our reliance on fossil fuels and their environmental effects. Since the invention of the first graphite/lithium cobalt oxide (C/LiCoO2) rocking-chair cell in 1985 by Asahi Kasei Corporation,3 lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been extensively utilized in portable electronic gadgets. In spite of this, large volume applications such as renewable energy storage systems, electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)2 require advanced LIBs that can provide higher energy/power density. Hence, there has been concerted worldwide research effort into high capacity anode/cathode materials and safe electrolytes for future LIBs.4
A graphite anode is presently used in LIBs with a theoretical capacity of only 372 mA h g−1 due to limited hosts for lithium ion intercalation/de-intercalation in its layered structure.5 Nowadays, transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been widely investigated as high-capacity anodes for LIBs in view of their high theoretical capacity (∼400–1000 mA h g−1), which is due to their ability to reversibly react with more than one lithium ion through the conversion reaction.6 TMO was assumed to be ‘inert’ to lithium ion insertion/de-insertion until the research work by Poizot et al. in 2000.6 CoO is a rocksalt structure that has no vacancy for lithium intercalation and de-intercalation. Poizot et al. successfully demonstrated the reduction of nanosized CoO to Co/Li2O during the first discharge, while nanocrystalline CoO was reversibly formed upon lithium ion extraction. It is worth noting that nanoscaling of TMOs for anode application is very crucial,2,7 as some novel physical and chemical properties are observed only when materials are scaled down to nanodimensions, including the conversion reaction. Nanomaterials provide a higher surface area to volume ratio and a shorter diffusion pathway for lithium ions and electron transportation, so the battery kinetics are significantly enhanced as compared to their micro-sized or bulk counterparts.8 Hence, the reduction of CoO to extremely tiny grain sizes of Co (2–5 nm), well dispersed in a Li2O matrix, is kinetically reversible.9,10 Since then, many reports have been published to employ nanosized TMO as anodes by conversion reaction.11–14
Although cobalt-based TMOs exhibit excellent cyclability and capacity, they are toxic and not cost effective.15 Thus, cobalt oxides have been substituted by some environmentally benign oxides, such as iron oxides16,17 and manganese oxides18,19 prepared by different synthesis methods. Of particular interest is that a combination of more than one TMO, crystallizing in the spinel structure, has shown good capacity values on cycling, such as ZnFe2O4,20,21 ZnMn2O422,23–25 and ZnCo2O4.26,27 By mixing two TMOs, it is possible to consolidate their competitive advantages, such as the flexibility to alter the theoretical capacity and control the working voltage.11 Among the ZnB2O4 series (B = Fe, Mn or Co), ZnMn2O4 has captured the most interest, as Mn is cheap and abundant, with the capability to perform at lower working voltages than the other two spinels. Nanosized ZnMn2O4 synthesized by different techniques was reported in several publications.23–25,28–30 Nanocrystalline ZnMn2O4 by the polymer pyrolysis method25 and nanoparticles by hydrothermal synthesis31 have shown a capacity retention of 569 mA h g−1 and 430 mA h g−1 after prolonged cycling. However, nanoparticles have a greater tendency to agglomerate, due to their high specific surface area and excessive surface energy,8,13 which inhibit their electrochemical performance. To prevent the existence of inactive regions by agglomeration and retain the extraordinary properties brought by nanomaterials, extensive study of the engineering of nanomaterials has been reported.2,7 The nano/micro hierarchical electrode materials combine the competitive advantages of both micro and nanomaterials,8,32 wherein the synthesis method is tailored to fabricate a self-assembled parent micro-sized structure made up of numerous building blocks on the nanoscale. For example, the formation of ZnMn2O4 hollow microspheres by ZnMn2O4 nanosized building blocks, demonstrated by L. Zhou et al.33 Each building block of ZnMn2O4 provides the benefits of nanometer-sized materials during prolonged cycling, while the micro-sized assembly ensures better structural stability and cyclability as an anodic material for LIBs.8
In the present work, such nano/micro ZnMn2O4 nanofibers have been fabricated by a relatively simple and cost effective electrospinning method. By changing the sintering temperature profiles, we have successfully demonstrated the formation of ZnMn2O4 nanorods (ZMO-NR), nanofibers (ZMO-NF) and nanowebs (ZMO-NW). The effect of morphology on the physical and electrochemical properties of ZnMn2O4 is presented. One of the key issues of electrospun oxides is the rupturing of nanofibers during heat treatment that is essential for oxide crystallization.21,34 We report a feasible way to tackle this issue by introducing an intermediate stage in the sintering profile, which promotes the carbonization of polymer constituent in the as-spun nanofibers, resulting in carbon–carbon bond formation, which enhances the mechanical integrity of fibers to prevent breakage of the fibrous morphology.
Results and discussion
Materials characterization of ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW
By electrospinning, high aspect ratio as-spun nanofibers with uniform diameter in the range ∼150–220 nm were prepared (Fig. 1). Poly(vinylpyrrolidone), (PVP) dissolved in absolute ethanol serves as a polymer backbone to contain the metallic precursor. A strong electric field was applied between the electrospinning solution and the collector plate (Fig. S1, ESI†), so long nanofibers were extracted from the needle tip and accumulated on the collector. Subsequently, a sintering step was required for the as-spun fibers to remove the solvent, PVP, as well as to convert the metallic precursors into their respective oxides before battery application. Consequently thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on as-spun nanofibers to understand the chemical compositional change as a function of temperature (Fig. 2). The weight loss of 2% at 98 °C is related to the evaporation of volatile species, possibly moisture, residual ethanol and acetic acid. The second decomposition peak starting at 301 °C corresponds to the decomposition of the metallic precursors, namely manganese acetylacetonate and zinc acetylacetonate. The prominent decline observed at 389 °C is attributed to the removal of the PVP backbone, which is the main constituent in as-spun nanofibers. There is no significant weight change (stabilizes at ∼25%) observed after ∼460 °C, indicating completion of chemical reactions. TGA analysis reflects the decomposition profiles of each chemical species, providing an important guideline to design the sintering temperature profile, in which 400 °C was chosen as the maximum sintering temperature. Three different sintering conditions have been applied to tune the morphology and mechanical integrity of sintered products, leading to the formation of ZnMn2O4 nanorods (ZMO-NR), nanofibers (ZMO-NF) and nanowebs (ZMO-NW) (Fig. 3(d)–(f)).

 Fig. 2  TGA of as-spun nanofibers was conducted in air from room temperature to 650 °C. 
 Fig. 3  Temperature profiles used in the sintering of as-spun nanofibers are illustrated in (a), (b) and (c). FESEM micrographs clearly indicate the influence of sintering temperature on the morphology of sintered products. 1-step sintering (a) has resulted in the formation of (d) ZMO-NR, 2-step sintering has resulted in (e) ZMO-NF. Excessive carbonization step resulted in (f) ZMO-NW. 
Typically, 1-step sintering (Fig. 3(a)) is commonly used after electrospinning to remove polymer backbones such as PVP,21 PVA35etc., and it is commonly seen that the nanofibers experience severe destruction of their fibrous morphology after the sintering, breaking down into nanorods, nanoparticles or irregular shapes.34,36 This is due to the rapid and excessive volume contraction within as-spun nanofibers after removal of the polymer backbone. Thus, metallic precursors lose contact with each other, causing rupturing of the fibrous morphology. To prevent the destruction, an extremely low heating rate might be useful to accommodate the volume contraction of nanofibers, at the expense of extra energy cost and time.34,36
A similar phenomenon was also noticed in this report. Fig. 3(d) shows that the as-spun nanofibers have broken down into shorter segments and formed nanorods (ZMO-NR) with non-uniform diameter after a direct sintering at 400 °C for 2 h. As-spun nanofibers have disassembled into irregular structures as they are unable to withstand the sudden volumetric change upon removal of the polymer backbone (Scheme 1(a)). We introduced a 2-step sintering profile (schematically displayed in Fig. 3(b)) to prohibit the loss of fibrous morphology during heat treatment. The as-spun nanofibers were calcined at 350 °C for 3 h to enable carbonization of PVP. The selected calcination temperature, 350 °C, is lower than the decomposition temperature of PVP (389 °C). The carbonization process leads to shrinkage of the fiber diameter to ∼100–150 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†), which facilitated the reactivity of metallic precursors within the fibers (Scheme 1(b)). Later on, further heating to 400 °C at 0.5 °C min−1 allows the conversion from PVP to carbonaceous products. This carbonization step has retained its fibrous morphology after sintering because it helps to reduce the distance between metallic particles, so they are able to maintain the fiber mechanical integrity with length of several microns to form ZMO-NF (Fig. 3(e)) after sintering. It is worth noting that the heating rate applied to ZMO-NF (1 °C min−1) is double the rate applied to ZMO-NR (0.5 °C min−1), without destroying the fibrous morphology and saving energy costs. The diameters of sintered fibers are thinner (80–130 nm) than as-spun fibers (Fig. 1), due to the removal of the organic component. Individual nanofibers are relaxed and interwoven with one another to form a network with open pores, which could not be observed in the relatively short ZMO-NR. Extending the duration of carbonization to 4 h promoted the merging of as-spun fibers into interlinked nanostructures (Scheme 1(c)), forming nanowebs (ZMO-NW) (Fig. 3(f)). As compared to ZMO-NF, ZMO-NW has relatively few open pores due to the coalescence. FESEM images with lower magnification are shown in Fig. S3, ESI,† with the purpose of showing the uniformity of nanostructures obtained. Further increasing the sintering temperature or extending the carbonization duration causes the breakage of nanofibers and/or diminishment of open pores. Our previous study has emphasized that high aspect ratio nanofibers are able to enhance the cyclability of the anode, and interconnected fibers render an effective diffusion pathway for lithium ions and electrons, while the open pores are beneficial in amplifying the electrolyte/electrode contact area.21 In this report, all three samples were employed as anodes for LIB application, and the importance of providing a 1D electronic pathway will be further discussed in the next section.

In order to understand the transformation of functional groups before and after sintering under different conditions, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to detect the vibrational modes for as-spun nanofibers and sintered products. The FTIR spectra of PVP and as-spun nanofibers (Fig. 4(a)) are very similar, showing that the major constituent in as-spun fibers is the PVP backbone.21 A broad band at ∼3439 cm−1 correlates to the stretching vibration of the O–H bond of either adsorbed water molecules or moisture from the atmosphere. Asymmetric stretching of CH2 and C–H stretching of PVP are observed, due to the presence of two adjacent peaks at ∼2959 cm−1 and ∼2874 cm−1. Subsequently, the vibration band at 1663 cm−1 is attributed to either C–N or CO functional groups. CH2 scissoring and wagging appears at 1452 cm−1 and 1267 cm−1, respectively. All these functional groups are contributed by the presence of PVP, as they were almost eliminated after being heated up to 350 °C and dwelling for 3 h (Fig. 4(b)). Additionally, some new vibration bands appear between 1650–400 cm−1 after the carbonization step, and these peaks are also found consistently in ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW (Fig. 4(c)–(e)). The new peaks are assumed to correspond to organic ligands converted from residual PVP after carbonization, as they are almost negligible when the as-spun nanofibers are heated up to 650 °C (Fig. 4(f)). As a consequence, the weak peak at ∼1629 cm−1 may be assigned to either CC or carbonyl derivative (x–CO–y) with a specific coordination environment (x and y: different functional groups).37,38 Another peak at ∼1130 cm−1 can be interpreted as the C–O stretching presented in all sintered samples.37 Vibration bands at ∼630 cm−1 and ∼516 cm−1, corresponding to the metal–oxygen stretching bond, increase in intensity with increasing temperature (to 650 °C), indicating the formation of ZnMn2O4 oxide.

From the FTIR study, some PVP residue was found in ZnMn2O4 samples after sintering (Fig. 4(c)–(e)) as expected, because the chosen sintering temperature (400 °C) is not high enough to remove PVP thoroughly. As this residue may contribute to battery capacitive storage during cycling, so TGA of sintered samples were conducted (ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW, see ESI† Fig. S4) at atmospheric conditions from room temperature to 650 °C. It was verified that the residual content in all scenarios is below 4 wt%. Hence, the participation of PVP residue embedded inside ZnMn2O4 on battery performance can be neglected.
X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD, Fig. 5) verify the formation of single phase ZnMn2O4 with space group I41/amd (ICSD 15305). Rietveld refinement indicates that ZnMn2O4 crystallizes in a tetragonal spinel structure with the lattice parameters listed in Table 1. There is a slight variation in the lattice parameters, probably due to different sintering conditions. Since the spinel crystal structure is destroyed and the ZnMn2O4 is amorphized into the nanocrystalline phase after the first discharge (lithium insertion), we may assume that the initial lattice parameters of spinel have a negligible impact on long term cycling. Furthermore, crystallite sizes are calculated by Rietveld refinements (Table 1). The results confirm that all three samples have comparable size and this is aligned with the measurement of nanocrystals by HRTEM images (Fig. S5, ESI†).

As mentioned previously, the hierarchically self-assembled nanostructure provides unique properties in battery applications. By HRTEM analysis, ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW consisted of numerous nanocrystals in the ranges of ∼9(2) nm, 9(2) nm and 9(1) nm, respectively (Table 1). XPS chemical state analysis of pristine powders of three morphologies (Fig. S6, ESI†) depicts that the starting powders have Zn and Mn in the same oxidation states, i.e. Zn2+ and Mn3+.
Application of ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW as anodes in LIBs
ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW were prepared as anodes for LIB in the 2016 coin cell configuration. To understand the reaction mechanism of ZnMn2O4 with lithium ions, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted between 0.005–3.0 V at 0.1 mV s−1 for 5 cycles (Fig. 6). Overall, the reduction and oxidation peaks are similar in three different morphologies, and their first cycles (Fig. 6(a)) are evidently distinguishable from the remaining cycles, indicating the change of chemical reaction mechanism towards lithium ions after the first cycle. In the first cathodic sweep, a very shallow reduction peak is observed at ∼1.4 V, which may relate to the intercalation of lithium ions into the spinel structure. This is commonly observed in ZnFe2O4 spinel anodes.20,21,39 However, this is the first time that we are reporting such a mechanism in ZnMn2O4 spinel. Another small hump at ∼0.7 V correlates to the irreversible decomposition of electrolyte to form a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer.24,25 Furthermore, the most intense peak at ∼0.25 V is attributed to the conversion reaction of ZnMn2O4 spinel into Zn and Mn metallic nanograins dispersed in a Li2O matrix.25,30 From this point onwards, ZnMn2O4 spinel experiences the conversion reaction and is thoroughly amorphized; thus the intercalation at ∼1.4 V is not observed in the reverse scans (Fig. 6(b) and (c)). At the first anodic sweep (Fig. 6(a)), two oxidation peaks are observed at ∼1.2 V and ∼1.6 V, respectively. The peak at ∼1.2 V can be ascribed to the reversible oxidation of Mn to MnO, whereas Zn is oxidized to ZnO at ∼1.6 V.24,25,40
 Fig. 6  Cyclic voltammetry of ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW at 0.1 mV s−1, (a) 1st cycle, (b) 2nd cycle and (c) 5th cycle. 
In the second cathodic cycle (Fig. 6 (b)), two peaks are observed as the coupling reduction of ZnO and MnO at ∼0.65 V and ∼0.5 V12 for ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW. Corresponding oxidation peaks are also observed at ∼1.3 V and ∼1.6 V, respectively. However, these redox peaks are not recognizable in ZMO-NR, as there is only a single redox pair at ∼0.6 V and ∼1.3 V at the 2nd cycle (Fig. 6(b)). It is suggested that the diffusion of lithium ions is less efficient in ZMO-NR than in ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW, so the chemical reactions are sluggish and merely a single redox peak is found, indicating that the efficiency of battery cycling is highly dependent on electrode morphology. At the 5th cycle CV of ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW, the reduction peaks of ZnO and MnO merge and appear as a single peak at ∼0.6 V, but its oxidation peaks are still resolvable. By comparing the CV at the 1st, 2nd and 5th cycles, ZMO-NR has a shallower area underneath the curves, so the nanofibers and nanowebs have rendered a better diffusion pathway for lithium ions during electrochemical measurement.
Their electrochemical performances were also investigated by galvanostatic discharging/charging at a current density of 60 mA g−1 with a voltage cut-off of 0.005–3.0 V versus Li+/Li. The discharging/charging curves of the 1st cycle are displayed for comparison (Fig. 7). The first discharge (lithium insertion) capacities of ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW are similar, i.e. 1469 mA h g−1 and 1526 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to ∼13 moles of lithium ions per formula unit of ZnMn2O4. Among the three morphologies, ZMO-NR has the worst performance as its first discharge capacity of 1257 mA h g−1 (∼11 moles of lithium ions). However, by looking closely into the first discharge curve, it was found that all three samples express similar discharge behaviours, especially in the capacity range 0–200 mA h g−1 (∼1.8 moles of lithium ions). A short plateau at ∼1.4 V is considered as the intercalation of lithium ions into the spinels, whereas electrolyte decomposition is seen at ∼0.75 V. In the subsequent discharge, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW take in ∼2 moles lithium ions more than ZMO-NR at the discharge plateau of ∼0.25 V, indicating that the efficiency of the conversion reaction depends on the morphology of the host materials, while ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW outperform ZMO-NR, which matches with our observation in their CV (Fig. 6). At the first charge, the capacities of ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW rapidly levelled off to ∼680 mA h g−1, ∼716 mA h g−1 and 891 mA h g−1, mainly explained by the irreversible reactions of SEI formation21,26 and the conversion of spinel (ZnMn2O4) into binary oxides (ZnO, MnO and Mn2O3).24,25,28,31,33
 Fig. 7  First galvanostatic cycling of (a) ZMO-NR, (b) ZMO-NF and (c) ZMO-NW at 60 mA g−1. 
After a prolonged cycling (Fig. 8), ZMO-NR exhibits the worst storage ability among the three products. Its retention at 50 cycles is ∼318 mA h g−1 (∼2.8 moles lithium ions). This is similar to our previous study on ZnFe2O4 nanorods;21 the capacity fades severely due to the lack of electronic wiring for lithium ion diffusion during discharging/charging in nanorods. The cyclability of ZMO-NW surpasses ZMO-NF at the initial 25 cycles due to its interconnected nanostructures, which promotes a facile transportation channel for lithium ions (Fig. 8). However, the capacity declines to ∼530 mA h g−1 (∼4.7 moles of lithium ions) at the 50th cycle, possibly due to the closure of pores in nanowebs by volumetric expansion in the conversion reaction, leading to the loss of its unique nanostructure. ZMO-NF demonstrates the best performance among the three morphologies. It can be maintained at ∼705 mA h g−1 (∼6.3 moles of lithium ions) after 50 cycles. Hence, the efficiency of ZMO-NF is the best out of all the samples, as it has demonstrated similar capacity to its 1st charge. Furthermore, ZMO-NF performs better than the ZnMn2O4 nanowires reported by Kim et al.,40 indicating the importance of electronic wiring.
 Fig. 8  Cycling performance of ZnMn2O4 with different morphologies at 60 mA g−1. 
Since three samples are formed by numerous nanocrystals of similar size (see Fig. S5, ESI†), we initially assume they shall perform comparably in LIB applications. Nevertheless, when the nanocrystals are hierarchically constructed into a specific morphology, i.e. nanorods, nanofibers or nanowebs, we are able to observe significantly distinguishable battery performances, especially after a long term cycling. ZnMn2O4 nanocrystals provide the competitive advantage of nanomaterials if they are specially arranged to form a secondary morphology. Besides, it is crucial to supply a connected pathway between all the nanocrystals to serve as diffusion channels for lithium ions during cycling. Consequently, it explains why ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW are better than ZMO-NR with poor electronic wiring, whereas ZMO-NW performs badly after the pore closure, as it has lost the characteristic of nanomaterials. This hypothesis is investigated by electrochemical impedance studies (EIS) to understand the kinetic of electrodes and the factors that are responsible for capacity degradation of an electrode.41–46
Impedance measurements were carried out on the bare electrodes with different morphologies of ZnMn2O4 to the working electrodes versus lithium foil. Besides, the cells were also galvanostatically cycled at 60 mA g−1 and hold 3.0 V (charged state) for 2 h before recording the EIS. The data is shown in the form of Nyquist plots (Z′ vs. −Z′′, where Z′ and Z′′ are the real and imaginary parts of complex impedance). Fig. 9 shows the EIS of bare electrodes, as well as the charged electrodes at the 2nd, 5th and 10th cycles. The experimental data are analyzed by fitting with an equivalent electrical circuit consisting of resistors and capacitors as shown in Fig. 10, which is similar to the model employed for battery data analysis elsewhere in the literature.41–43 The circuit elements are denoted as electrolyte resistance (Re), the inseparable surface film (sf) and charge transfer (ct) impedance (R(sf+ct)), the constant phase elements (CPE(sf+dl) (dl: double layer)), the bulk impedance (Rb) and the Warburg impedance (W). CPEs are used instead of pure capacitors, due to the occurrence of depressed semi-circles in the spectra, which is an indication of deviation from the ideal behaviour of a capacitor.

 Fig. 10  The equivalent circuit which is used to fit the experimental data in Fig. 9. 
Results showed that the electrolyte resistance (Re) remained almost constant at 6(±0.5) Ω, irrespective of cycle number, and the morphologies of ZnMn2O4, as presumed. On the other hand, the R(sf+ct) and Rb and the associated CPE(sf+dl) and CPEb are sensitive to the morphology of active materials and vary upon cycling. The Nyquist plots of all the bare electrodes under OCV (Fig. 9) comprise a depressed semi-circle at high frequencies, followed by Warburg-type behaviour in the low frequency region. The spectra was basically fitted to a single semicircle (both R||CPE circuit elements), attributed by surface film formed when the electrode is in contact with the electrolyte. However, the contribution by charge transfer between electrolyte and electrode has also been considered in fitting, hence the overall resistance and the CPE are represented as R(sf+ct) and CPE(sf+dl), respectively. The fitted values are tabulated in Table 2. As seen in Table 2 and Fig. 9, the impedance values of the bare electrodes were noticed to be highest in ZMO-NW, possibly due to the higher surface area of ZMO-NW (BET surface area = ∼47 m2 g−1). The interconnected nanostructure of ZMO-NW offers an excessive surface area that can be accessed by the electrolyte, so it has a substantially larger reaction site on the electrodes. Penetration of the electrolyte into the bulk electrodes through open pores embedded in the nanowebs has also led to greater surface film formation, and thereby high surface resistance. On the contrary, surface film formation was found to be lower in ZMO-NF (BET surface area = ∼44 m2 g−1) and ZMO-NR (BET surface area = ∼40 m2 g−1), due to their lower surface area as compared to ZMO-NW. These results are in tune with the galvanostatic cycling, whereas ZMO-NW has demonstrated the highest first discharge capacity. In bare electrodes, the major constituent of the surface film is salt in the electrolyte, whereas the chemical composition changes upon cycling. After the first discharge, SEI formation and electrolyte decomposition are essentially to be taken into account for EIS fitting, causing the changes in R(sf+ct) values in subsequent cycles.41

In general, the formation and integration of electrodes takes place in the first few cycles of the conversion reaction,47,48 therefore the associated impedance values are not consistent at the initial stage of cycling. Besides, the volumetric contraction and expansion encountered by the electrode during cycling may cause pulverization of the electrode from the current collector or the agglomeration of active materials. This phenomenon is reflected as inconsistent impedance values upon cycling in EIS study, as well as the degradation of capacity values in galvonostatic cycling.44–46 In the present work, impedance of all ZnMn2O4 after 2, 5 and 10 complete discharging/charging cycles were testified. The largest variation of impedance values is noticed in ZMO-NR. More precisely, the radii of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 9(a)) have spread significantly, so it explains the poor cyclability exhibited by ZMO-NR, which lacks of electronic wiring for lithium ion diffusion. As a result, there might be the presence of inaccessible regions within the bulk electrode, since nanorods are weakly connected, and hence ZMO-NR shows poor electrical contact with the current collector.
Similar unstable impedance was also found in ZMO-NW, even though the fluctuation is smaller. The increment of charge transfer and bulk impedances upon cycling may be caused by the closure of open pores embedded in nanowebs by volumetric expansion/contraction or electrochemical grinding. In this case, unique morphology of ZMO-NW has diminished; thus a steady capacity loss is also observed. It is worth noticing that the impedance values derived for ZMO-NF stay relatively consistent as compared to the other two samples. Besides, its impedance values are the lowest among the three samples. It was believed that the enhanced excellent capacity retention of ZMO-NF is contributed to by the continuous framework of nanofibers with open pores, resulting in good electronic conduction pathway for lithium ions and electrons. Overall, EIS has interpreted that the capacity stabilization is sensitive to the morphology and integrity of active materials, especially at prolonged cycling.
Experimental section
The ZnMn2O4 nanorods (ZMO-NR), nanofibers (ZMO-NF) and nanowebs (ZMO-NW) were prepared by electrospinning. Stoichiometric amounts of zinc acetylacetonate hydrate [Zn(C5H7O2)2·xH2O (Sigma Aldrich)] and manganese acetylacetonate [Mn(C5H7O2)3 (Sigma Aldrich)] were mixed in 3 ml acetic acid (Tedia) with vigorous stirring. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP; Fluka) (molecular weight of 360000) was dissolved in absolute ethanol (Sigma Aldrich) to form a 9.5 wt% solution. Subsequently, PVP/ethanol solution was added to the metallic precursor/acetic acid solution and vigorously stirred to obtain a homogenous solution.
The precursor solution was connected to a high voltage power supply (Gamma High Voltage Research DC Power Supply). A positive voltage of 12 kV was applied between the needle tip and the grounded aluminium foil collector, with a distance of 12 cm. The solution was ejected at a constant flow rate of 1 ml h−1 by computer-controlled syringe pump (Kd Scientific). The as-spun fibers were heated in ambient atmosphere at different sintering temperature profiles (ramp rate, duration and maximum temperature) to acquire ZnMn2O4 with different morphologies. ZnMn2O4 nanorods (ZMO-NR) were obtained when the as-spun fibers were heated directly to 400 °C for 2 h at a ramp rate of 0.5 °C min−1. ZnMn2O4 nanofibers (ZMO-NF) were prepared by heating the as-spun fibers to 350 °C at 1 °C min−1 and dwelled for 3 h, then were subsequently ramped up again to 400 °C at 0.5 °C min−1, with a dwelling time of 15 min before cooling down to room temperature at 1 °C min−1. When the dwell duration at 350 °C was increased from 3 h to 4 h, ZnMn2O4 nanowebs (ZMO-NW) were formed.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a TA Instrument Q500 by heating as-spun nanofibers from room temperature (r. t.) to 650 °C under air at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out on the samples in KBr pellets using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum GX at a resolution of 1 cm−1. Besides, the surface area of ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW were recorded on degassed samples (120 °C/6 h) using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET, Micromeritics, ASAP 2020) by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K. The structural information was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Advance, Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.54 Å) with a step size of 0.05° over 10° to 80°. Rietveld refinement was performed using fundamental parameters peak shape profile49 implemented in TOPAS.50 A five-coefficient Chebychev polynomial background, a zero error, unit cell parameters, scale factor and crystallite size were sequentially refined. The morphology of the samples was examined by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL 7600F) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL 2100F). The chemical states of ZnMn2O4 were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) by using a Kratos AXIS Ultra spectrometer equipped with Al-Kα monochromatic radiation. Survey scans were conducted between 0 and 1200 keV calibrated against adventitious carbon. Deconvolution and peak fitting were performed with computer assisted surface analysis (CASA) software using a Voigt function with 30% Lorentzian character and a Shirley background.
The electrochemical performances of ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW were evaluated in a 2016-coin cell. The electrodes were prepared by mixing 60 wt% active materials, 20 wt% binder (Kynar) and 20 wt% Super P (Timcal) in solvent, N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP, Sigma Aldrich) to form a homogenous slurry. The slurry was coated on etched copper foil by doctor blade technique (thickness ∼25 μm) and dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. Subsequently, the coating was pressed between twin rollers to improve the adhesion between the copper foil and the active materials. The electrodes were cut into circular disks with a diameter of 16 mm, each disk containing ∼2–3 mg of active materials. The electrodes were assembled in an argon filled glovebox (MBraun, Germany) with oxygen and water content of less than 1 ppm. Lithium metal served as a counter electrode, Celgard 2400 as the separator and 1 M solution of LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate/diethylene carbonate (EC:DEC = 1:1, Charlston Technologies Pte Ltd.) was used as the electrolyte.
The lithium storage properties of ZnMn2O4 were examined by galvanostatic cycling (Multichannel Battery Tester, Neware Technology Limited) and cyclic voltammetry (CV, Solartron 1470E) measurements. These coin cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged in the voltage window 0.005–3.0 V at room temperature and at 60 mA g−1. CV testing was studied in a similar voltage range at a constant scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in the range 100–0.1 Hz by applying a bias voltage of 10 mV, and the data were shown as a Nyquist plot.
Conclusion
ZMO-NR, ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW were synthesized by electrospinning technique, followed by heat treatment with different sintering profiles. 1-step sintering has created excessive volumetric change within the as-spun nanofibers, causing the breakdown of fibers into short nanorods (ZMO-NR). In this report, a carbonization process is first introduced as the intermediate step during heat treatment, with the purpose of improving the mechanical integrity during sintering and forming ZMO-NF and ZMO-NW. Three samples are similarly comprised by numerous nanocrystals of ∼9 nm, whereas battery performance is greatly influenced by the hierarchical nanostructure formed by nanocrystals. By having a highly connected nanofiber framework with the presence of open pores, a facile transportation route for lithium ions is preserved. Hence, ZMO-NF outperforms ZMO-NR and ZMO-NW to have the best cycling stability.
