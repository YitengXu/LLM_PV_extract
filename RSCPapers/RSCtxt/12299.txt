    , Accepted 7th June 2016First published on 23rd June 2016AbstractFlexible metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been considered promising wearable energy power sources. Recently, various multi-functional charge-transporting layers, with high conductivity and air stability, have been rapidly developed in order to improve device performance. The practical use of flexible PSCs requires the retention of the performance and air stability at large active areas. However, increasing the size of the active layer results in increased contact and series resistance at the interfaces of the device. This hinders the charge transport, leading to charge recombination and degradation of the device performance. Furthermore, the poor stability of organic small molecules is detrimental to long-term stability. As such, flexible PSCs based on Li-doped poly(3-hexylthiopehene) (P3HT) nanofibrils (LN-P3HT), as a hole transporting layer (HTL), are prepared by subjecting a P3HT solution to a cooling process. The nanofibrils obtained via the π-conjugation of the thiophene rings result in improved conductivity and air stability, yielding high-performance, flexible, and air-stable PSCs with an active area of 1 cm2 (PCE = 13.12%). This outstanding performance and mechanical stability are retained (PCE = 12.96%) after 500 bending cycles at r = 15 mm; these PSCs also exhibit a 30-day PCE retention of 87% (relative to the initial PCE) at a relative humidity of 30%. Therefore, this novel and facile strategy for preparing an efficient and air-stable organic HTL is a promising method for the realization of high-performance large-area flexible PSCs.
Introduction
The emergence of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has spurred innovation in the development of next-generation photovoltaic devices.1,2 Perovskites have an excellent light absorption coefficient (5.7 × 104 cm−1 at 600 nm), high charge carrier mobility (66 cm2 V−1 s−1, for a single crystal), and a tunable optical band gap; as such, these materials are used in various applications such as light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and memory devices.3–8 Several device architectures and materials have been developed to improve the photovoltaic characteristics and environmental stability of PSCs.9–13 As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased significantly, to 22.1%, surpassing that of polycrystalline silicon solar cells.14 Low-cost solution-based processes are highly desirable for the fabrication of PSCs suitable for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems incorporated with tandem solar cells, such as perovskite/silicon and perovskite/copper–indium–gallium–selenide (CIGS).15–17 Furthermore, low-temperature processes have enabled the fabrication of flexible architectures on polymer substrates; the resulting high-performance and mechanically flexible PSCs are promising candidates for wearable energy power sources.18–22
The use of flexible PSCs in practical applications requires the scaling up of the constituent active areas in order to obtain a flexible PSC module with a high photocurrent output. However, the integration of large active areas has resulted in a significant decrease in the PCE, owing to the occurrence of a high contact resistance at the interfaces of the interlayers, electrodes, and perovskite.23,24 To obtain both high PCE and a high photocurrent output in these areas, interface engineering has been considered viable for improving the extraction and transfer of charge carriers as well as reducing the contact resistance.23,24 This may be achieved through an alignment of the energy levels and an increase in the electrical conductivity of the interlayers.25–27 Recently, Li-doped NiMnOx and Nb-doped TiOx were used as a hole transporting layer (HTL) and an electron transporting layer (ETL), respectively.28 These dopants increased the conductivity of the interlayers and facilitated charge extraction from the perovskite, leading to a high PCE of 16.2% in an active area of 1.02 cm2.28
However, the protocol required high annealing temperatures, thereby preventing the fabrication of flexible PSCs. The superior flexibility of organic semiconductors, compared to that of metal oxides, and the low-cost room-temperature solution process make flexible PSCs especially attractive. Flexible PSCs based on an inverted planar structure (p-i-n) have employed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as a HTL. PEDOT:PSS is ill-suited for the fabrication of large-area flexible PSCs owing to its poor air stability and high acidity (pH ∼ 1), which lead to the corrosion of the transparent conducting oxide and perovskite layer.29,30 Hydrophobic organic HTLs should therefore be considered for the fabrication of large-area flexible PSCs. Conjugated polymers, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA), exhibit better air stability than PEDOT:PSS and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) and are commonly used as HTLs in PSCs.31 From this perspective, P3HT would be a suitable HTL for the realization of flexible PSCs because the crystallinity and morphologies of the thin films can be simply modified through various methods; this leads, in turn, to improved conductivity and air stability.
As such, we report on highly efficient, flexible, and air-stable n–i–p planar PSCs, with an active area of 1 cm2, realized by employing Li-doped P3HT nanofibrils (LN-P3HT) as a HTL. The HTL exhibited enhanced conductivity along both the vertical and parallel directions, facilitating hole extraction from the perovskite, and lowering the specific contact resistivity between the HTL and Au. This resulted in improved device performance and retention of hysteresis-less behavior with varying sizes of the active area. In addition, the highly crystalline LN-P3HT thin films exhibited enhanced air stability, thereby facilitating the successful fabrication of highly flexible and air-stable planar PSCs. These PSCs exhibited an excellent PCE of 13.12% at 1 cm2, which was almost completely retained (12.96%) after 500 bending cycles at r = 15 mm. Furthermore, a PCE of 11.4% was maintained for 30 days at a relative humidity of 30%.
Experimental
Materials
Anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) (99.8%), anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (99.9%), anhydrous diethyl ether (99.9%), anhydrous m-xylene (>99%), anhydrous chlorobenzene (99.8%), anhydrous acetonitrile (99.8%), anhydrous 2-methoxyethanol (99.8%), polyethyleneimine (80% ethoxylated solution) (PEIE), [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (>99%), regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) (99.95%), and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (tBP, 96%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. In addition, PbI2 (99.9985%) and methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.98%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Dyesol, respectively. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was prepared via the Lewis-base adduct method that was outlined in a previous report; 461 mg of PbI2, 159 mg of MAI, and 78 mg of DMSO were mixed with 600 mg of DMF.10 LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT solutions were prepared by dissolving 12 mg of P3HT in m-xylene at 60 °C, and then adding 12 μL of Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (170 mg mL−1) and 12 μL of tBP/acetonitrile (1:1 volume ratio) to the solution. The LN-P3HT solution was prepared, in 10 min, from the hot stock solution at −20 °C and the yellow-orange color changed to dark purple. Furthermore, the LP-P3HT solution was kept at 60 °C.
Solar cell fabrication
Etched ITO/glass and ITO/PENs (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) were rinsed with 2-propanol and acetone, dried with a N2 blower, and subsequently treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. The 0.2 wt% PEIE, diluted in 2-methoxyethanol, was spin coated at 6000 rpm for 50 s onto the substrate. The substrate was baked at 100 °C for 5 min. Furthermore, 2 wt% of PCBM was dissolved in chlorobenzene, and the resulting solution was spin-coated, for 40 s at 1500 rpm, onto ITO-PEIE. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated, at 4000 rpm for 25 s, onto the sample and 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was dripped, for 10 s, on the rotating sample.10 This solution was then heated at 65 °C for 1 min and at 100 °C for 2 min. Moreover, the LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT solutions were spin-coated, at 3000 rpm for 30 s, onto the perovskite. Before spin coating, the LN-P3HT solution was sonicated for 1 min in order to untangle the nanofibrils. Afterwards, the Au electrode was deposited at a constant rate of 0.5 Å s−1, by using a thermal evaporator.
Characterization
The surface morphologies of the samples were examined via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi S-4100) images. TEM (JEM-2010, JEOL Ltd.) images were also obtained. Moreover, UPS measurements were performed by using a scanning XPS microprobe (PHI 5000 VersaProbe, Ulvac-PHI) equipped with a HeI monochromator (21.2 eV). The structure of the perovskite and the optical properties of the P3HT thin films were determined via XRD (Rigaku Ultima IV) and UV-Vis spectroscopy (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer), respectively. The steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite films were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 550 nm, using a Fluorolog3 photoluminescence spectrometer system equipped with a monochromator (iHR320, HORIBA Scientific). In addition, time-resolved PL measurements were performed at the PL maxima of the perovskite (770 nm), using a time-correlated single photon counting module (TCSPC, MPD-PDM Series DET-40 photon counting detector and Pendulum CNT-91 frequency counter); this module was combined with a monochromator and a second-harmonic-generated 400 nm laser, derived from a 800 nm Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai, Spectra-Physics), which served as a detector and an excitation source, respectively. EIS measurements were performed by using an impedance analyzer (Solartron 1260), and the corresponding Nyquist plots and EIS parameters were obtained by using the Z-View software. J–V curves were obtained by using a Keithley model 2400 source measure unit. A 180 W xenon lamp in a solar simulator (Yamashita Denso YSS-50A) was used as the light source. The light intensity was adjusted to approximately AM 1.5G, which is equivalent to one sunlight intensity, by using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-1 filter. The active areas of 0.12 cm2, 0.48 cm2, 0.72 cm2, and 1 cm2 were defined by using metal masks. Furthermore, IPCE spectra were obtained, at wavelengths ranging from 300–900 nm, using IPCE equipment (PV Measurement, Inc.).
Results and discussion
Long P3HT nanofibrils are formed in solution by controlling the thermodynamic parameters, such as the concentration, solubility of P3HT in the organic solvents, and the cooling temperature. The driving force for one-dimensional (1D) growth is based on the π-conjugation of the thiophene rings formed from the maximum overlap between the π-orbitals.32 This conjugation is most easily induced by reducing the solubility of P3HT.33–36 The schematic in Fig. 1A shows the formation of LN-P3HT during the cooling process. The Li-doped pristine P3HT (LP-P3HT) solution was prepared at 60 °C. The solubility of P3HT in m-xylene decreased significantly with rapid cooling of the red-yellow LP-P3HT solution at −20 °C, and the color of the solution changed to dark purple with the growth of the nanofibrils.34–36Fig. 1B shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the long and ultra-thin nanofibrils obtained from the spin-coating of the LN-P3HT solution. The morphologies of the nanofibrils remained the same after the addition of Li-TFSI, suggesting that Li acted as only a p-type dopant that led to an increased electrical conductivity of P3HT.37 These ∼5–20 μm-long nanofibrils had a diameter of ∼20 nm. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT thin films revealed a significant change in the intensity of the shoulder peaks, which occur at 600 nm, resulting from the π-conjugation (Fig. 1C). In addition, the out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of the films indicate that the level of crystallinity of the LN-P3HT film is higher than that of the LP-P3HT; P3HT grains fill the gaps between the nanofibrils; however, LP-P3HT was mixed with the amorphous phase.36

The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT thin films vary with the measurement direction. Fig. 2A and B show the I–V curves of Li-doped P3HT (LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT) obtained for vertical and parallel measurement directions, respectively. The conductivity (σ) was determined as follows, σ = D/(RA) (for the vertical direction)(1) σ = L/(R′A′) (for the parallel direction)(2)where D is the thickness of P3HT thin films (50 nm), R is the resistance along the vertical direction, A is the area of the Au electrodes (0.12 cm2), L is the distance between the Au electrodes (100 μm), R′ is the resistance along the parallel direction and A′ is the cross-sectional area of P3HT thin films (1.5 × 10−6 cm2). R and R′ were obtained from the inverse slope of the respective plots shown in Fig. 2A and B. In the case of the parallel direction, conductivities of 2.04 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 1.04 × 10−3 S cm−1 were obtained for the respective LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT films; corresponding values of 1.81 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 4.17 × 10−4 S cm−1 were obtained for the vertical direction. The conductivity of LP-P3HT is isotropic. However, in the case of LN-P3HT, the conductivity along the parallel direction is significantly higher than that along the vertical direction. This is attributed to the fact that the charge transport occurs predominantly along the b axis, rather than along the a and c axes of the nanofibrils. In the case of the vertical direction, the conductivity of LN-P3HT was higher than that of LP-P3HT, owing to the numerous grain boundaries in LP-P3HT that suppressed the charge transport. In contrast, the grain-boundary-free nanofibril network in LN-P3HT resulted in a rapid charge transport along the a-axis of the nanofibrils.33,35 This rapid transport is indicative of the specific contact resistivity (ρc) between the HTL and Au; the ρc values of 17.67 Ω cm2 and 7.17 Ω cm2 were determined for the LP-P3HT/Au and LN-P3HT/Au interface, respectively (ESI†).

The 400-nm wavelength incident laser progressed toward the glass substrate, as indicated in the inset. 
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) clearly reveals the effect of enhanced conductivity in the HTL. Fig. 2C shows the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite in the glass/perov, glass/perov/LP-P3HT, and glass/perov/LN-P3HT samples. The fluorescence emission of the perovskite occurred at a wavelength of 768 nm after excitation at 550 nm. The PL intensity of the perovskite decreased significantly with the application of LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT. Moreover, when glass/perov is taken as the reference, quenching efficiencies of 76% and 85.7% are obtained for glass/perov/LP-P3HT and glass/perov/LN-P3HT, respectively. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay, performed at 768 nm using a 400 nm-wavelength incident laser, also indicated that LN-P3HT is a more efficient hole quencher than LP-P3HT (Fig. 2D). The rapid decay results from the quenching of carriers from the perovskite to P3HT, whereas the slow decay results from a radiative decay within the perovskite.38,39 LN-P3HT lowered the decay life time more rapidly than LP-P3HT and this was accompanied by an increase in the amplitude of rapid decay, confirming that the hole extraction from the perovskite was more effective. The average life time of the glass/perov, glass/perov/LP-P3HT, and glass/perov/LN-P3HT was 13.06 ns, 4.68 ns, and 2.86 ns, respectively. The fitting parameters of the double exponential function corresponding to these samples are summarized in Table S1.† The steady-state PL spectra and TRPL decay of the perovskite revealed that the hole-extraction and transport capacities of LN-P3HT were far superior to those of LP-P3HT.
LN-P3HT was applied to an HTL of perovskite solar cells. Fig. 3A shows a schematic of the device architecture. This architecture was realized by modifying the ITO surface with poly(ethyleneimine)-ethoxylated (PEIE), thereby increasing the work function of ITO from −4.6 eV to −4.0 eV; this increase is attributed to the dipole injection of the imine groups of PEIE.26 Moreover, this modification was essential for the efficient transfer of electrons from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM to the work function of ITO. The non-PEIE-treated device performed poorly (PCE: ∼4%) owing to the large difference between the work function of ITO and the LUMO of PCBM (ESI, Fig. S1†). There was a negligible upward shift in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), i.e., −5.08 eV and −5.05 eV for LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT, respectively, as shown in the schematic (Fig. 3B). The HOMO of Li-doped P3HT was determined via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Fig. 3C and D show the cut-off binding energy (Ecut-off) and Fermi edge (EF,edge), respectively, of Li-doped P3HT. The EF,edge remained constant, whereas the Ecut-off of LN-P3HT was shifted by 0.03 eV, owing to its π-conjugation effect.40

Fig. 4A shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the PSC. CH3NH3PbI3 thin films were deposited on PCBM by employing the Lewis-base adduct method.10 These coarse-grained (grain size: 100–500 nm) films have an ultra-smooth pin hole-free surface (ESI, Fig. S2†). Li-doped P3HT thin films were spin-coated onto the perovskite. As Fig. 4B shows, the perovskite is almost homogeneously covered by the LN-P3HT. The Au electrode was then deposited via thermal evaporation. Fig. 4C and D show the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices with active areas of 0.12 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively. These curves were obtained during a backward–forward voltage sweep at a scan-delay time of 200 ms. At an active area of 0.12 cm2, PCEs of 13.41% and 12.51% were obtained for the LP-P3HT device subjected to the backward–forward sweep, respectively; the corresponding values of 15.18% and 15.04% were obtained for the LN-P3HT device. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest-ever PCE attained for P3HT used as a HTL in PSCs (Table S2†). At an active area of 1 cm2, PCEs of 11.16% and 9.2% were obtained for the LP-P3HT device and 13.45% and 13.22% for the LN-P3HT device subjected to the backward–forward sweep, respectively. The change in the photovoltaic parameters and the degree of hysteresis varied with the increasing active area of the LP-P3HT device. For example, at an active area of 1 cm2, the fill factor (FF) decreased significantly from 0.716 to 0.622 during the backward sweep, while the FF of the LN-P3HT device decreased from 0.712 to 0.669. The hysteresis increased substantially with the increasing active area of LP-P3HT, whereas the LN-P3HT device exhibited hysteresis-less behavior (i.e., negligible change occurred) with changes in the active area. This difference in the hysteresis behavior was reflected in the series resistance (Rs, 25.19 Ω cm2 and 10.88 Ω cm2 for the LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT, respectively) of the devices. Similar trends were observed for devices with medium-sized (0.48 cm2 and 0.72 cm2) active areas (ESI, Fig. S3†). Because the Rs strongly relies on the grain size of the perovskite and the ability of interlayers to extract and transfer charge carriers, it is correlated to the hysteresis behavior.41,42 It is known that the larger grains of the perovskite suppressed the charge traps at the grain boundaries, thereby, the Rs was lowered and the hysteresis was mitigated.41 The charge recombination by the imbalanced electron–hole flux also increases the Rs, which mainly gives rise to the hysteresis.43 Therefore, the hysteresis behavior can be considered as a function of the Rs that was determined according to the different HTLs. The FF in the forward sweep is determined by the following equation,44 FF = FF′(1 − r)(3) (4) (5)where FF′ is the fill factor without Rs, r is the normalized Rs, and R′ is the ratio of the voltage (VMP) and photocurrent (IMP) at the maximum point. The significant decrease in the FF of the LP-P3HT devices in the forward sweep was attributed to the increase in Rs; hence, the large hysteresis was observed. This corresponded to the fact that the performance of the LN-P3HT devices was sustained by the lower specific contact resistivity between LN-P3HT and Au, and better hole extraction from the perovskite. The photovoltaic parameters corresponding to the different active areas of the LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT devices are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 4E shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices. At wavelengths ranging from 300–900 nm, the LN-P3HT device exhibits a higher IPCE than its LP-P3HT counterpart, except at 600 nm. As such, the integrated current density of the LN-P3HT device, 21.14 mA cm−2, is higher than that (20.01 mA cm−2) of the LP-P3HT device. This is attributed to the high conductivity of the LN-P3HT thin films. In addition, as shown in the UV-Vis spectrum, the concave spectrum of the LN-P3HT device at 600 nm results from the strong light absorption of the nanofibrils. Fig. 4F shows that the respective steady-states Jsc of 15.1 mA cm−2 and 18.3 mA cm−2 were obtained at the maximum power voltage (Vmax) of the LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT devices. The obtained PCEs of the devices under actual working conditions corresponded closely to those obtained from the J–V curves. In addition, the high reproducibility of rigid devices, consisting of a 1 cm2 active area, was demonstrated for 25 devices. Average PCEs of 10.67% and 12.78% were obtained for the LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT devices, respectively (ESI, Fig. S4†).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the charge transport and recombination processes at the perovskite/P3HT interface in further detail. The bulk recombination lifetime (τbulk) and interface recombination lifetime (τinterface) were determined from the following relation,45 τ = CR(6)by fitting the Nyquist plots to the corresponding equivalent circuit; C is the capacitance and R is the resistance of each component in the circuit (ESI, Fig. S5 and Table S3†). τbulk and τinterface were extracted at 0.8 V under dark conditions. τbulk denotes the recombination lifetime of the charge carriers within the perovskite and is determined by the hole-extraction rate as well as the defect density of the perovskite.45 For the same perovskite, and as previously indicated by TRPL, LN-P3HT extracted the holes from the perovskite more rapidly than LP-P3HT. Therefore, τbulk of the LN-P3HT device was longer than that of LP-P3HT and remained almost constant, regardless of the size of the active area. An increase in the active area from 0.12 cm2 to 1 cm2 resulted in a 59.5% and 16.1% reduction in the τbulk of the LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT devices, respectively (Fig. 5A). τinterface is determined by the recombination resistance at the interface of the perovskite and P3HT. Compared to τbulk, τinterface decreased more with increasing active area of the LN-P3HT and LP-P3HT devices. However, as in the case of τbulk, τinterface of the LN-P3HT device decreases by a smaller amount (54% vs. 79.3%) than τinterface of the LP-P3HT device (Fig. 5B). The results of EIS modeling indicated that, compared to LP-P3HT, the conductive LN-P3HT more effectively suppressed the bulk and interface recombination of the device, thereby leading to improved device performance. The τbulk and τinterface of the active areas are summarized in Table S4.†

The device architecture is suitable for large-area flexible PSCs. More importantly, the device was successfully fabricated on an ITO/poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) substrate owing to the low-temperature deposition of the interlayers and perovskite, through a solution-process. Fig. 6A shows an actual image of the flexible LN-P3HT device with an active area of 1 cm2. Maximum PCEs of 13.12% and 12.96% were obtained during backward–forward voltage sweep, respectively, at a 200 ms scan-delay time (Fig. 6B). Under the same conditions, PCEs of 10.88% and 9.71%, respectively (ESI, Fig. S6†), were obtained for the flexible LP-P3HT device. The layers are all highly flexible, except for the ITO film, and hence the mechanical durability of the devices was retained for a bending radius (r) of up to 10 mm. This durability was confirmed via mechanical stability tests performed on three independent devices that exhibited similar performances. The dependence of the PCE on the bending cycle is shown in Fig. 6C. The initial PCEs of 13.12%, 13.09%, and 13.05% decreased to 12.96%, 12.78%, and 11.12% after 500 bending cycles at r = 15 mm, 10 mm, and 6 mm, respectively. The incomplete shape recovery of the ITO/PEN substrate, after 100 bending cycles at r = 6 mm, is attributed to the plastic deformation of the substrate. A similar tendency in the degradation of the PCE was also observed in the flexible LP-P3HT devices, indicating that the durability of the devices was independent of the structure of P3HT. Initial PCEs of 10.88%, 10.49% and 10.63% decreased to 10.65%, 10.16% and 9.02% after 500 bending cycles at r = 15 mm, 10 mm, and 6 mm, respectively. The bending test results of the flexible LN-P3HT and LP-P3HT devices are listed in Tables S5 and S6,† respectively. The histogram shown in Fig. 6D confirms the high reproducibility of flexible PSCs having an active area of 1 cm2. An average PCE of 12.56% was obtained for 20 devices.

(C) Bending test: flexible PSCs were subjected to 500 bending cycles at r = 15 mm, 10 mm, and 6 mm. (D) Histogram of PCEs for 20 devices. 
The LN-P3HT also improved the air- and photo-stability of the flexible PSCs. Specifically, the amorphous region and the grain boundaries of P3HT serve as the space for the penetration of oxygen species, facilitating the degradation of thiophenes,36,46 whereas the tight packing and long persistence length in the nanofibrils may act as an energy barrier for the change in the structure of the P3HT chains, which limits the oxidation or attachment of hydroxyl groups to the thiophene rings.36,46 The LN-P3HT effectively blocked the penetration of oxygen and water molecules into the perovskite; hence, the flexible LN-P3HT devices stored under ambient conditions (relative humidity: 30%) for 30 days exhibited a more stable performance than the flexible LP-P3HT device. The flexible LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT devices exhibited respective PCE retentions of 87% (PCE = 11.4%) and 71% (PCE = 7.72%) relative to the initial values (Fig. 7A). The good air-stability of the flexible LN-P3HT device was comparable to that of the devices employing dopant-free organic semiconductors such as reduced graphene oxides, triphenylamine/fluorene derivatives and polymeric HTLs consisting of a random copolymer.47–49

(B) PCEs of the flexible LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT devices obtained at 1 sun, 40 °C and a relative humidity of 30% for 12 h. 

Fig. 7B exhibits the photo-stability of the flexible devices under constant environmental conditions (1 sun, 40 °C and relative humidity: 30%). Recently, it has been found out that the degradation of perovskites was independent of light irradiation in the absence of other main factors including TiO2, moisture, and elevated temperature by light.50 Therefore, the environment of our stability test may have an effect on the fast degradation of the perovskite regardless of the HTLs. After 12 h, the flexible LP-P3HT and LN-P3HT devices exhibited respective PCE retentions of 55.7% (PCE = 7.23%) and 40.6% (PCE = 4.48%) relative to the initial values. The better photo-stability of the LN-P3HT device was attributed to the robust LN-P3HT against the light irradiation.36,46 The normalized conductivity in the LN-P3HT and LP-P3HT was found to be 0.963 and 0.885 after 24 h at 1 sun, respectively (ESI, Fig. S7†). The retention of conductivity in the LN-P3HT supported the device performance to some degree. This suggests that the LN-P3HT would have great potential as a bi-functional HTL. As such, the LN-P3HT is a promising HTL for high-performance, flexible, mechanically robust, air- and photo-stable PSC modules.
Conclusions
In summary, LN-P3HT was prepared by employing a cooling process in order to realize highly efficient, flexible, air- and photo-stable PSCs having an active area of 1 cm2. The abrupt decrease in the solubility of P3HT in m-xylene, during this process, facilitated π-conjugation of thiophenes, thereby yielding long P3HT nanofibrils. Compared to LP-P3HT, LN-P3HT exhibited more efficient hole extraction from the perovskite and a lower specific contact resistivity to Au. This resulted in hysteresis-less behavior and improved performance at large active areas. Flexible PSCs based on LN-P3HT exhibited an excellent PCE of 13.12%, which was almost completely retained after 500 bending cycles at r = 15 mm (PCE = 12.96%). A PCE of 11.4% was obtained after 30 days at a relative humidity of 30%. The flexible LN-P3HT devices also exhibited better photo-stability (PCE = 7.23% and 4.48% for the LN-P3HT and LP-P3HT devices after 12 h at 1 sun, 40 °C and a relative humidity of 30%, respectively) due to the robust LN-P3HT against light irradiation. The strategy used to prepare the HTL in this work is a promising method for fabricating high-performance, flexible, air- and photo-stable PSC modules.
