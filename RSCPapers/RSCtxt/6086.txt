    AbstractWe have demonstrated the synthesis of nanostructured CdIn2S4 with a fascinating ‘marigold flower’ morphology using a hydrothermal method, and mixed morphologies (flowers, spheres and pyramids) using a microwave method. In the microwave synthesis, the product was formed within 15 min, whereas by the hydrothermal method more than 24 h was required. In the microwave method, various capping agents were used that result in different particle morphologies. Hydrothermal formation of crystalline CdIn2S4 nanotubes in methanol showed a significant effect of reaction medium on morphology. Synthesis of these crystalline CdIn2S4 nanopyramids and ‘marigold flowers’ has also been demonstrated using microwave synthesis for the first time. An XRD study showed a cubic spinel structure for CdIn2S4 prepared by both methods. The band gap for CdIn2S4 was 2.27 eV when synthesized using the microwave method, and 2.23 eV using the hydrothermal method, implying that the microwave method produces a lower particle size than the hydrothermal method. A noteworthy aspect of this work is that we obtained novel ternary chalcogenide hierarchical nanostructures by simple hydrothermal and microwave methods. Considering that the band gap of the hierarchical CdIn2S4 is within the visible region, we compared its ability to photocatalytically degrade methylene blue (MB) with that of CdS. The marigold flowers, nanoparticle spheres and nanopyramids of CdIn2S4 synthesised by microwave method gave almost 30% enhancement in the degradation of MB as compared to CdS under direct sunlight. This is of importance, considering that CdIn2S4 has potential for applications in solar energy conversion and opto-electronic devices.
1. Introduction
The ternary semiconducting compound CdIn2S4 is attracting increasing attention, the reasons for this being (1) it is a photosensitive semiconductor and has the possibility to be used as a photoconductor in the visible region of the spectrum, and (2) it has a cubic spinel structure that is same as that of the ferromagnetic chromium chalcogenides. Therefore, studies of the semiconducting properties of CdIn2S4 should provide a foundation for the study of ferromagnetic semiconducting spinels. During the last few years, many researchers have studied CdIn2S4 because of its potential application in solar energy conversion,1–6 as well as in opto-electronic and photo-chemical devices.7–9
Recently, CdIn2S4 has been demonstrated to show potential capability for applications in light-emitting diodes, and has been extensively studied in the form of thin films for photo-electronic devices.9,10 Attempts have been made to synthesize photoactive CdIn2S4 thin films by simple and low-cost chemical spray pyrolysis, vacuum evaporation and hot wall epitaxy (HWE) methods.9–11 CdIn2S4 single crystals have also been grown from stoichiometric quantities of the elements by iodine-vapor transport and the horizontal Bridgman method.11 However, most of these methods are complicated, energy-intensive and hazardous.
Recently, the time-dependent evolution of crystal lattice defects and impurities in CdIn2S4 was investigated,12 in which the effect of doping on the crystal structure was demonstrated using spectroscopic measurements. Electrical, optical and scanning tunneling microscopy on layer-type CdIn2S4 has also been performed, along with the selenides.13 Although CdIn2S4 has been synthesized by high-temperature methods and the product been studied structurally, hierarchical nanostructured CdIn2S4 has not been studied extensively. Indeed, the literature for the preparation of CdIn2S4 powder and nanopowders by wet chemical methods is very limited. Previously, we have demonstrated hydrothermal synthesis of CdIn2S4 with interesting optical properties.14
There are many reports on the synthesis of one-dimensional structures and their mechanical, optical, electrical and magnetic properties.15–25 Considering the potential of CdIn2S4 in electronic devices, it is desirable to investigate the effect of hierarchical nanostructures on the efficiency of these devices. In this context, the synthesis of hierarchical nanostructured CdIn2S4 will have the utmost significance.
In the present investigation, we have demonstrated the synthesis of hierarchical nanostructured CdIn2S4 using a microwave method for the first time. In addition, the morphologies and optical properties of CdIn2S4 prepared by the hydrothermal and microwave methods were compared. Since there was no report on the microwave synthesis of CdIn2S4, extensive studies were performed with respect to its structural, morphological and optical properties. It is quite well known that CdS is a very good visible light photocatalyst, but due to photocorrosion its stability is questionable. Considering that the band gap of the CdIn2S4 lies in the visible region, we investigated its ability to photocatalytically degrade the organic dye methylene blue (MB), and compared it to CdS. We found that the ‘marigold flowers’, nanoparticle spheres and nanopyramids of cubic spinel CdIn2S4 efficiently photodegraded MB under direct sunlight.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Hydrothermal synthesis
Hydrothermal reactions are often used to synthesize nanocrystalline materials such as TiO2, ZrO2, CdS and ZnO, but hydrothermal and microwave synthesis of CdIn2S4 has not been studied systematically. Here, we demonstrate that synthesis of CdIn2S4 is possible within 24 h using a hydrothermal method. However, as the crystal growth and morphology is generally dependent on the reaction time and medium, reaction times of 60 h using water and methanol as reaction media were also investigated. We observed fascinating morphologies (‘marigold flowers’ and nanotubes) using this hydrothermal method, and characterized the CdIn2S4 obtained in both aqueous and methanolic systems using XRD.

2.1.1 X-ray analysis. 

Fig. 1a and b show the XRD patterns of the CdIn2S4 prepared in water and methanol respectively. All the peaks in the pattern reveal a cubic spinel structure with no evidence of CdS or β-In2S3. The broad peaks at 2θ = 27° (311) and 47.5° (440) are the main characteristics of the cubic spinel phase of CdIn2S4. All reflection parameters and the lattice parameter a (= 10.84 Å) are in good agreement with the reported values (JCPDS-27-0060). The broadness of the reflections is most probably due to the nanocrystalline nature of the CdIn2S4 powder.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of CdIn2S4 prepared in: (a) water; (b) methanol. 
More broadening of reflections was observed in the methanol-mediated sample, which implies a smaller particle size. From the XRD (using Scherrer’s formula), the average crystallite size for CdIn2S4 was 20–22 nm using the water-mediated route, and 8 nm using the methanol-mediated route.


2.1.2 Morphology. 
As shown in the FESEM micrograph of CdIn2S4 prepared by the water-mediated route (Fig. 2(a)), the CdIn2S4 ‘marigold flower’ comprises numerous particles (‘petals’) that self-organize into spherical assemblies to give the ‘marigold flower’ morphology, with a rather puffy appearance. Under the conditions we used, all the CdIn2S4 particles were in this morphology, with diameters ranging from 5–10 μm. The gap between the particles (‘petals’) was 300–700 nm.

Fig. 2b shows the FESEM of methanol-mediated CdIn2S4. FESEM image clearly shows the CdIn2S4 nanotubes to be of similar diameters (25–30 nm) but different in length (400–800 nm). The internal diameter of the nanotubes was 20–25 nm.


2.1.3 Optical study. 

Fig. 3a and b show the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of CdIn2S4 prepared in water and methanol, respectively. The absorption edges of water- and methanol-mediated CdIn2S4 are 555 and 550 nm, respectively. The band gaps of CdIn2S4 were estimated to be 2.23 eV for the water-mediated and 2.25 eV for the methanol-mediated samples, which match with literature values.26,27 The slight shift in absorption edge for the methanol-mediated sample may be due to a small particle (‘petal’) size and different particle morphology,27 while the broad peak of the methanol-mediated sample is due to the different morphology. The steep absorption edge indicates the presence of single-phase CdIn2S4, in good agreement with our XRD results. The steep visible edge and strong absorption in the visible region also indicates that the absorption band of CdIn2S4 is due to the transition between the valence band and the conduction band, rather than that between the transition metal impurity level and the conduction band.

2.2 Microwave synthesis
Microwave synthesis is a well known rapid reaction technique whereby microwave heating is applied instantly, and the synthesis of many metal oxides and sulfides has been reported using this method.28,29 Here, we synthesized nanostructured CdIn2S4 using a microwave digestion system for the first time. The reaction was firstly optimized with respect to microwave power. The reactions were carried out at 300–600 W using aqueous as well as methanolic media. Complete formation of CdIn2S4 was observed at 300 W within 20 min in aqueous medium and within 10 min in methanol. The reaction time required for the formation of the CdIn2S4 phase is much less than for the hydrothermal method. However, because of the near-instant reaction, it was very difficult to control the morphology and growth of the particles. To do this, we used different capping agents, and studied the effect of methanol on the formation of CdIn2S4. The CdIn2S4 obtained by microwave synthesis was characterized using XRD to assess its phase purity, and a morphological study was performed by FESEM.

2.2.1 X-Ray analysis. 
The CdIn2S4 was synthesized by heating at 300 or 400 W for 20 min in an aqueous medium; Fig. 4a and b show the corresponding XRD patterns of the CdIn2S4. All peaks in the pattern reveal a cubic spinel structure with no evidence of CdS or β-In2S3. Similar parameters for the hydrothermal CdIn2S4 were obtained for microwave-prepared CdIn2S4 (JCPDS-27-0060). From the XRD, the average crystallite size was deduced to be 30–35 nm in both samples.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of CdIn2S4 prepared in aqueous medium at: (a) 300 W; (b) 400 W. 

Fig. 5a–d show the XRD pattern of CdIn2S4 prepared in water with and without the capping agents Triton X, SLS and SDS. Surprisingly, the crystallite size was observed to be 8–10 nm, which is much lower than the hydrothermal CdIn2S4. Interestingly, the XRD pattern of CdIn2S4 synthesized using SLS as a capping agent (Fig. 5c) has a (222) peak higher intensity, but the reason for the enhancement of the (222) peak over the (311) peak is not clear – further experiment is needed to clarify this point.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of CdIn2S4 prepared in water at 500 W: (a) without capping agent, and with (b) Titron-X, (c) SLS, and (d) SDS as capping agents. 
From the XRD (using Scherrer’s formula), the average crystallite size was 8–9 nm in all products, which is surprisingly much lower than for the water-mediated hydrothermal CdIn2S4.
CdIn2S4 was also synthesized by treatment in water for 15 min at 600 W, again with and without the capping agents; Fig. 6a–d shows the corresponding XRD patterns. These show the same cubic spinel structure, with similar reflection parameters being observed as for the 500 W experiments. From the XRD, the average crystallite size was 6–9 nm in all products. In the previous 500 W experiments, that using SLS (Fig. 5c) did not show perfect cubic spinel structure, but at 600 W a perfect cubic spinel structure was obtained. This implies that crystal growth is slower using SLS as a capping agent at 500 W.
 Fig. 6  XRD patterns of CdIn2S4 prepared in water at 600 W: (a) without capping agent, and with (b) Titron-X, (c) SLS, and (d) SDS as capping agents. 
CdIn2S4 was also synthesized in methanol by treatment at 500 W for 10 min; Fig. 7a–d show the corresponding XRD patterns. All the peaks in Fig. 7a, b and d show a cubic spinel structure, with just a slight variation in intensity of the peaks. Interestingly, SLS-capped CdIn2S4 (Fig. 7c) did not show a cubic spinel structure, implying incomplete growth of CdIn2S4. The average crystallite size was 14–20 nm, which is slightly higher than for the water-mediated CdIn2S4. This may be because of the lower boiling point of methanol compared to water. Under similar microwave conditions, methanol will warm more quickly, and thus will have higher vapor pressure after 10 min. This may be responsible for the faster crystal growth.

2.2.2 Morphology. 

Fig. 8a and b show the FESEM images (at different locations) of CdIn2S4 prepared in an aqueous medium at 300 W. These show the CdIn2S4 plates assembling in the form of spheres. The thickness of these triangular plates is 50 nm, with lengths of 100–200 nm; the clusters of triangular plates can be clearly seen. Fig. 8c and d likewise show the FESEM images of CdIn2S4 prepared at 400 W. Interestingly, different morphologies are obtained compared to CdIn2S4 prepared by the hydrothermal method. Surprisingly, these CdIn2S4 plates self-organize and transform into pyramids at 400 W. The FESEM image clearly shows these pyramids, which have 200–500 nm edges. This is the first time that these morphologies have been observed for CdIn2S4 synthesized by a microwave-assisted method.
 Fig. 8  FESEM images of CdIn2S4 prepared in an aqueous medium at (a and b) 300 W and (c and d) 400 W. 
The SEM images of CdIn2S4 prepared in aqueous medium at 500 W are shown in Fig. 9a. This micrograph reveals the existence of spheres of diameter 2 μm, with 8–10 nm particles on the surface of the spheres. An SEM image of CdIn2S4 prepared using SDS as a capping agent is presented in Fig. 9b. Spheres of spherical nanoparticles were observed, with slight agglomeration. When the reaction was carried out at 600 W for 15 min without a capping agent, puffy ‘flowers’ were obtained (Fig. 9c and d). These ranged in size from 1–3 μm, with the ‘petals’ being 5–10 nm thick. This is the first time that ‘marigold-like’ hierarchical nanostructures have been reported using a microwave method. Some of the flowers are diffuse due to overgrowth of petals (Fig. 9d), and so we were curious to investigate the morphology when using a capping agent like SDS. Surprisingly, CdIn2S4 synthesized using capping agent at 600 W in aqueous medium conferred a different morphology (Fig. 9e and f), namely 50–75 nm nanorods of CdIn2S4. One-dimensional growth is known to be possible using capping agents.19
 Fig. 9  SEM of water-mediated CdIn2S4 prepared: (a) at 500 W for 15 min without capping agent; (b) at 500 W for 15 min with capping agent (SDS); (c and d) at 600 W for 15 min without capping agent; (e and f) at 600 W for 15 min with capping agent (SDS). 

Fig. 10 shows the SEM picture of CdIn2S4 synthesized within 10 min in methanol, again showing multiple growths of ‘flowers’. Fig. 10b clearly shows that these range in size from 250 nm to 2 μm, with the thickness of the petals being around 10 nm. Fig. 10c and d show SEM images of methanol-mediated CdIn2S4 with capping agent SDS, which produced dense ‘flowers’ of size 250 nm and above. There is control of growth of the flower, as well as the petals, and hence instead of a diffuse arrangement, dense flowers have been obtained. In microwave synthesis, due to instant heating fast growth is observed, and this is quite well understood.23 The effect of the medium certainly results in differences in morphology because of the different properties of the medium, such as polarity and density. In addition, the reaction time was observed to be lower than for aqueous medium.
 Fig. 10  SEM of methanol-mediated CdIn2S4 prepared (a and b) at 500 W for 10 min without capping agent and (c and d) at 500 W for 10 min with capping agent (SDS). 
Regarding the formation of the spherical ‘marigold flower’ structures, the geometrical building blocks14,20 may be playing a key role, because no surfactants are used during the synthesis. A thin layer of nanoparticles may form at the initial stage of the reaction and then self-orient in the form of plate or petals (see Scheme 1) as the reaction progresses. A simple array of such crystals (petals) will easily generate curvature and develop into a marigold-like structure. (Scheme 1b and c). The curvature of petal is further accelerated by the hydrothermal conditions in the methanol-mediated reaction and results in CdIn2S4 nanotubes (Scheme 1a). However, the reason for such an unusual morphology is not quite clear. The hydrothermal reaction produces puffy flowers due to a long reaction time, but the microwave reaction produces relatively compact CdIn2S4 marigold flowers with a shorter reaction time and a higher power i.e. 600 W, and growth does not take place as expected. It is very difficult to obtain such hierarchical structures using microwave synthesis, but our water-mediated microwave reaction results in a ‘marigold-like’ morphology, which appears to be quite unique. In aqueous medium, the mobility of ions is faster, which accelerates the growth of the petals, and is greatest at 600 W. Hence, hierarchical structures may be possible at higher power and slightly longer reaction times (15 min). Our previous studies showed a diffuse hierarchical structure at higher power due to overgrowth.28 However, in the present case the above conditions are the favourable for the formation of hierarchical structures.
 Scheme 1  Schematic representation of formation of different morphologies of CdIn2S4. 
When the reactions were carried out at lower power i.e. 300 W for 20 min, clusters of triangular plates are observed. There may be orientation of nanoparticles in the form of a triangular shape, followed by self-organization to give a pyramid at 400 W (Scheme 1 d). Surprisingly, the dense flowers of CdIn2S4 (250 nm) are formed in methanol-mediated microwave reactions, rather than the nanotubes which are observed in hydrothermal synthesis, and the reason for this might be the shorter reaction time. The interference of the capping agent strongly influences the morphology and growth of the nanoparticles due to disruption of the surface tension of the nanoparticles. This may be one of the reasons that we obtain diffuse or non-assembled morphologies with capping agents.
Hydrothermal and microwave methods have their own advantages for the synthesis of nanostructured materials. It is possible to synthesise CdIn2S4 within 15 min using microwaves, but the hydrothermal method takes a minimum of 24 h. However, microwave synthesis requires that the precursors are microwave-susceptible, although precise control, uniform size and morphology are achievable using this method. Nevertheless, the hydrothermal method is facile and can confer different types of morphologies, such as flowers, nanotubes, nanowires etc.


2.2.3 Optical studies. 

Fig. 11 shows the UV-DRS spectra of water-mediated CdIn2S4 synthesized at 300 and 400 W. The optical cut-off edge was 557 nm for both spectra, and the corresponding band gap was around 2.22 eV, which closely matches the reported value.14
 Fig. 11  UV-DRS spectra of CdIn2S4 prepared in aqueous medium at (a) 300 and (b) 400 W. 
CdIn2S4 synthesized using different capping agents have shown different morphologies. Accordingly, we investigated their optical properties using UV-DRS. Fig. 12 shows the UV-DRS spectra of water-mediated CdIn2S4 synthesized by treatment at 500 W for 10 min using different capping agents. The optical cut-off edge was 545 nm and the band gap around 2.27 eV, which closely matches the reported value i.e. 2.2 eV. Fig. 13 shows the UV-DRS spectra of water-mediated CdIn2S4 synthesized by treatment at 600 W for 15 min. However, there is no appreciable change in band gap with increase in the power of the reaction.

Fig. 14. shows UV-DRS spectra of methanol-mediated CdIn2S4 synthesized by treatment at 500 W for 10 min using different capping agents. The optical cut-off edge was 550 nm and the corresponding band gap was around 2.25 eV, which is slightly lower than that for CdIn2S4 prepared in an aqueous medium. This implies a lower crystallize size for the water-mediated CdIn2S4.

2.2.4 Photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue with CdIn2S4 prepared by the microwave method. 
CdIn2S4 is a semiconductor with narrow band gap of 2.23 eV at room temperature, and because of its good spectral response to visible light, the photocatalytic activities of CdIn2S4 have been investigated. In this work, we used methylene blue (MB) as a representative organic dyestuff resistant to biodegradation. The activities of the as-prepared CdIn2S4 (nanospheres, ‘marigold flowers’ and nanopyramids) were evaluated without further treatment under direct sunlight.

Fig. 15 shows the degradation data of MB over the irradiation time in the presence of CdIn2S4 synthesized at different powers and using different media, and indicates a higher photocatalytic activity than for bulk CdS. Fig. 16 also shows typical absorption spectra of degraded MB solution after 150 min for simplicity. Degradation of 97.31% was observed within 150 min using the CdIn2S4 nanoparticle spheres and ‘marigold flowers’ (see Fig. 15d and g). The nanopyramids also showed good photocatalytic activity (93.01% degradation). However, mixed-morphology CdIn2S4 had slightly lower activity than ‘marigold flowers’. Overall, a 30% enhancement in the photocatalytic activity was observed using CdIn2S4 synthesized using microwaves as compared to bulk CdS. Clearly, the reason for the good photocatalytic activity for the CdIn2S4 ‘marigold flowers’, nanoparticle spheres and nanopyramids is the good crystallinity and nanocrystalline nature of these materials.14

3. Experimental section
3.1 Hydrothermal synthesis
An appropriate amount of analytical grade Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, In2(NO3)2 and thiourea were dissolved in methanol as well as in distilled water as a reaction medium and placed in a Teflon line stainless autoclave of 100 ml capacity. The autoclave was maintained at 100–150 °C for 12–60 h and then air-cooled to room temperature. The precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water and methanol. The product was dried at 70 °C in laboratory oven. The CdIn2S4 was prepared in both water and methanol.
3.2 Microwave synthesis
In this method, the same precursors as mentioned above were placed in a microwavable Teflon container (40 ml), and reactions were performed in a microwave digestion system (SEM XL 30) at 500 W and 600 W. The synthesis was carried out in aqueous and methanol medium. Different capping agents were also added, such as Titron X, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).
3.3 Characterization
The CdIn2S4 nanostructures synthesized above were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (Model-D8, Advance, Bruker AXS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Philips XL 30) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL-JSM6700F). The optical properties were recorded from their UV-Vis–NIR spectra (Perkin-Elmer λ-950 spectrometer).
3.4 Photocatalytic activity measurement
Visible-light photocatalytic activity was evaluated by degradation of methylene blue (MB) in an aqueous solution, carried out in direct sunlight. For each run, 50 mg of photocatalyst sample was dispersed in 50 ml of a 10 ppm aqueous solution of MB. Prior to the irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 120 min to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and MB. The mixture was then kept in direct sunlight. At certain time intervals, aliquots of about 1 ml were withdrawn from the suspension and filtered. The measurement of MB concentration in the filtrate was carried out using UV-Vis–NIR spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer λ-950 spectrometer). The area of the absorption bands integrated in the range 500–750 nm was used to monitor the progress of reaction. The absorption data obtained was then used to calculate the percent degradation.
4. Conclusion
Hierarchical CdIn2S4 nanostructures resembling marigold flowers have been synthesized in aqueous medium, and CdIn2S4 nanotubes in methanol medium, both using a facile hydrothermal method. The average crystallite size was 20–22 nm for the water-mediated CdIn2S4 (‘marigold flowers’) and 20–25 nm for methanol-mediated CdIn2S4 (nanotubes). Hierarchical nanostructures of CdIn2S4 were also fabricated using microwave synthesis for the first time.
CdIn2S4 ‘flowers’ were obtained in water-mediated microwave reactions, whereas the methanol-mediated microwave synthesis produced clusters of flowers that were dense rather than puffy. The average crystallite size of water-mediated CdIn2S4 was 8–10 nm, and that of the methanol-mediated CdIn2S4 was 20–22 nm. The band gap of CdIn2S4 synthesized by microwave method was 2.27 eV, but CdIn2S4 prepared by the hydrothermal method had a band gap of 2.23 eV. Both methods produce CdIn2S4 with a perfect cubic spinel structure. CdIn2S4 of various morphologies synthesized by microwaves showed excellent photocatalytic activity. The ‘marigold flowers’, nanoparticle spheres and nanopyramids of CdIn2S4 show almost 30% enhancement in the degradation of MB compared to CdS under sunlight. We expect that these hierarchical nanostructures will have immense importance in solar cells, LED and optoelectronics.
