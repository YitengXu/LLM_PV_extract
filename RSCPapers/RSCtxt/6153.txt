O. C.dInstitute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, TaiwanReceived 15th October 2009, Accepted 8th December 2009First published on 5th February 2010AbstractNovel lead pseudo polymorphs supported by diselenophosphate (dsep) ligands, [Pb{Se2P(OiPr)2}2]n (1α and 1β), were synthesized and structurally characterized. The two structures differed in the binding modes of the dsep ligand. Each repeating unit in 1α was composed of a lead atom coordinated by two dsep ligands, one in a chelating mode and the other in a bridging–dangling mode. By contrast, the dsep ligands in 1β adopted a bimetallic-biconnective (μ1-S, μ1-S) binding pattern. The bridging–dangling mode observed in 1α is the first example of this mode for the dsep ligand. [Pb{Se2P(OiPr)2}2]n could be successfully utilized as a single source precursor (SSP) for growing lead selenide (PbSe) nanostructures with different shapes via the solvothermal process. The morphologies of the as-grown PbSe structures were controlled by capping agents, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and ethylenediamine, both bind on the {200} plane and enhance the growth rate of the <111> direction of the PbSe crystals, resulting in the formation of cubes and eight-horned rod dendrites, respectively. Raman spectroscopy was utilized to investigate the phonon vibration behaviour of the as-grown eight-horned rod dendrites. All peaks in the Raman spectra can be attributed to longitudinal (LO) and transverse (TO) optical phonon modes of the PbSe rod dendrites.IntroductionFirst reported in 1968, diselenophosphates (dsep) have been shown to form monomeric, cluster, and polymeric complexes with a wide variety of metal ions due to their capability of adopting several binding modes through two selenium atoms.1 Surprisingly no cluster or polymeric lead complex is known for the dsep ligands except a monomeric Pb(IV) species,2 even though a few polymeric complexes involving its lighter congener, dithiophosphates, are known.3 It is noteworthy that although several binding modes are possible for the dsep ligand (Scheme 1), there is still no report of binding mode I. Scheme 1 The control of nanostructure shapes and compositions by various techniques, such as vapor transport, solvothermal, and sol–gel process etc., have attracted immense research attention in recent years.4 Experiments aimed at identifying suitable precursors and reaction parameters are necessary to create the desired compositions and shapes of nanostructures.5 To overcome this drawback, single source precursors (SSP) are the best choice for the preparation of nanostructures with precise compositions because all the individual elements of the product can be supplied by one single compound. Various kinds of SSPs, such as metal dithiocarbamates,6 and metal xanthates7 have been extensively studied in the past years. Therefore, SSP synthetic routes for the fabrication of metal-chalcogenide nanostructures such as CdS and ZnS nanoparticles,8 CdS nanowires,9 coaxial ZnS–ZnO nanorods,10 CdSe and ZnSe thin films,11 Bi2S3 and Bi2Se3 thin films,12 and EuS nanocrystals13 by various synthetic techniques viz. metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), solvothermal synthesis etc., has drawn much attention. We have recently used metal complexes of dialkyl diselenophosphates (dsep) for the preparation of nanomaterials composed of copper, antimony and bismuth selenides.14 Since dsep ligands are readily prepared on a large scale and have a well defined ability to form complexes with a wide range of metals,1 this has allowed the production of various metal-selenide nanomaterials, whose size and shape can be tuned by simply changing the temperature or solvent or by the addition of an amphiphile during the solvothermal synthesis. Several examples of the fabrication of nanomaterials and nanostructures via SSP synthetic routes are known, however, there are few reports of the preparation of nanomaterials using polymeric species such as SSP.15Three dimensional nano-sized architectures have great potential for applications in advanced devices (e.g., sensors, batteries, and fuel cells), which are dependent on their rapid electrochemical reactions owing to the extremely large specific surface areas for charge, mass, or gas transport.16 Nanostructured PbSe, a II-VI semiconductor with a small band gap (0.28 eV) and large exciton Bohr radius (46 nm),17 is important due to its wide applications in near-IR luminescence,17 infrared detectors,17 thermoelectric devices,18 and photovoltaic solar cells.19 Although PbSe nanostructures such as nanocrystals,20 spheres,21 nanocubes,17,22 nanowires,18a,23 and nanotubes24 were successfully fabricated from two or more precursors in numerous synthetic processes, only in a single instance has the preparation of PbSe thin films via a SSP route25 been reported. Furthermore, the use of SSP to synthesize PbSe nanostructures with different shapes has not been well explored.Herein we report the synthesis and structural characterization of novel lead pseudo polymorphs of the dsep ligand [Pb{Se2P(OiPr)2}2]n (1α and 1β) in which 1α is convertible to 1β at ∼35 °C in solution. The formation of PbSe architectures with different shapes, such as cubes and eight-horned rod dendrites, using the as-synthesized polymeric SSP, [Pb{Se2P(OiPr)2}2]n, is also demonstrated. Furthermore, insight into the change of the PbSe structural shape under the influence of external stimuli that act as capping agents such as PVP for cubes and ethylenediamine for eight-horned rod dendrites are also discussed, along with the Raman spectra of the as-grown PbSe structures.ExperimentalMaterialsAll chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. All the solvents (Mallinckrodt Chemicals, LR grade) were purified prior to use following the standard procedures.26 Pb(OAc)2·3H2O (99.99%) was purchased from Aldrich and the ligand NH4Se2P(OiPr)2 was prepared according to the method published earlier.27 All the reactions were performed in oven-dried Schlenk glassware using standard inert-atmosphere techniques. Elemental analyses were performed on a F002-HERAEUS CHN analyzer. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance DPX300 FT-NMR spectrometer which operates at 300 MHz while recording 1H, 121.49 MHz for 31P and 57.24 MHz for 77Se. The 31P{1H} and 77Se{1H} NMR are referenced externally against 85% H3PO4 (δ = 0 ppm) and PhSeSePh (δ = 463 ppm), respectively. Chemical shifts (δ) and coupling constants (J) are reported in ppm and Hz, respectively. The coupling constants are reported in parentheses. The NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature unless otherwise indicated.Synthesis[Pb{Se2P(OiPr)2}2]n (1α). NH4[Se2P(OiPr)2] (0.195 g, 0.6 mmol) was dissolved in 15 mL ether in a 100 mL Schlenk flask and Pb(OAc)2·3H2O (0.113 g, 0.3 mmol) was added at 0 °C. The resulting mixture was stirred under nitrogen for 3 h at 0oC. The light green solution which formed was evaporated to dryness under vacuum to obtain a light green powder, which was then dissolved in 15 mL acetone. The solution was filtered and the colorless filtrate was evaporated to dryness under vacuum to obtain a white powder. Yield: 0.204 g (83%). Mp. 75 °C. Anal.

NH4[Se2P(OiPr)2] (0.195 g, 0.6 mmol) was dissolved in 15 mL MeOH in a 100 mL Schlenk flask and Pb(OAc)2·3H2O (0.113 g, 0.3 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 3 h at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. After this period the solution was evaporated to dryness under vacuum to obtain a light green powder which was dissolved in 15 mL of acetone and filtered. The colorless filtrate was evaporated to dryness under vacuum to obtain the product as a white powder. Crystals suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction were obtained by diffusing hexane into an acetone solution of the compound. Yield: 0.199 g (81%). Mp. 90 °C. Anal.

The data were collected using the ω scan technique. Data reduction was performed with SAINT,28 which corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. An absorption correction using SADABS was applied. The structures were solved by the use of “Direct-methods”, and the refinement was performed by least-squares methods on F2 using the SHELXL-97 package29 incorporated in SHELXTL/PC V5.10.30 The largest peak was located at 0.76 Å and 0.88 Å in 1α and 1β, respectively, near the lead center (Table 1).

The reaction temperatures employed were between 150 to 220 °C. The heating time was set to 20 h. After cooling the autoclave to room temperature, the product was obtained as a grey solid. The solid product was washed with methanol. The composition of the solid was identified by powder XRD and TEM-EDS to be PbSe. The morphology and dimensions of the products were examined with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7000F). The structure of the products was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL 3000F) operating at 300 kV. Raman spectra of the PbSe rods were recorded on a JOBIN-YVON T64000 Raman spectrometer operating at 4 mW and a laser wavelength of 512 nm.Results and discussionSimple stirring of a stoichiometric mixture of NH4[Se2P(OiPr)2] and Pb(OAc)2 under a nitrogen atmosphere produced two compounds with the chemical formula [Pb{Se2P(OiPr)2}2]n depending on the reaction temperature. Reaction in ether at 0 °C produces 1α whereas that in methanol at room temperature produces 1β; the complexes differ in bonding and connectivity as shown by the single crystal X-ray diffraction study below.Structure 1α. The lead complex 1α crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c. Each repeating unit of the 1D polymeric chain is composed of a Pb atom coordinated by two diselenophosphate (dsep) ligands, one in a chelating mode and the other in a bridging–dangling mode (Fig. 1a). Although several coordination patterns of diselenophosphate ligands have been identified in metal complexes (Scheme 1),1 the bridging–dangling (mode I) pattern is observed for the first time in this compound. Thus, each Pb1 is tetrahedrally coordinated to Se1 and Se2 from a chelating dsep ligand and two bridging Se3 atoms from two more dsep ligands. The geometry around the Pb atom can be better described as a see–saw as the angular geometric parameter τ4 described by Houser is 0.74 (highest and second highest angles around the Pb atom are 159.189(11) and 95.835(12)° respectively).31 The angle Se1–Pb1–Se2, 74.591(11)° is the smallest angle around Pb. The alternating dsep ligands (both types) along the c axis remain in the eclipsed conformation. The Pb–Se lengths 2.8817(4)–3.1572(4) Å lie within the range observed in [Ph(MeO)PSe2Pb]2 in which the diselenophosphonate (abbr. dsepo) ligands adopt chelating as well as chelate-bridging modes (Table 2).32 P–Se distances 2.1107(10)–2.1924(10) Å also lie within the range of those observed in [Ph3Pb{Se2P(OEt)2}] where the connective pattern for the dsep ligand is monodentate.3 Se⋯Se attractive interactions exist between Se atoms of adjacent chelating dsep ligands, as is evident from the Se1–Se2A distance of 3.765(1) Å, which is less than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.80 Å)33 and lies within the range reported for this type of interaction.34,35 The dangling Se atom also shows interactions with the neighboring Pb atom, as is evident from the Pb–Se4 distance of 3.3287(5) Å, which is longer than a typical Pb–Se bond length.

The isomeric structure crystallizes in the triclinic P space group along with a solvated hexane molecule. Each of the Pb(II) atoms is surrounded by four Se atoms from four dsep ligands and the dsep ligands act as a bridge to connect adjacent Pb(II) atoms (Fig. 1b). Thus each of the 8-membered rings formed by two Pb and two dsep ligands is fused to two adjacent rings such that each Pb atom is shared by neighboring rings, forming a 1D chain. The dsep (ethyl derivative) ligand adopts a very similar type of bonding and connectivity in [Cd{Se2P(OEt)2}2]n, a polymeric species.36 The Pb–Se distances (2.8754(4)–3.1293(4) Å) lie within the range observed in [Ph(MeO)PSe2Pb]2.32 The Se–P lengths 2.1107(10)–2.1924(10) Å are comparable to those in the 1α isomer. The geometry around the Pb atom should be described as “see-saw” as the calculated τ4 is 0.73. Two neighboring Se atoms display a nonbonding interaction as evident from the Se1⋯Se2 distance of 3.529(2) Å. In addition the Pb1⋯Se4B distance of 3.369(2) Å suggests the presence of a non-bonding, weak interaction. It is to be noted that Woollins et al. reported [Ph(EtO)PSe2]2Pb in which there were Pb⋯Se secondary interactions having a distance of 3.39(1) Å.32 In both polymers the coordinating atoms are hemidirected,37i.e. clustered on one side of the Pb atom leaving voids on the other, presumably due to the presence of the stereochemically active lone pair of electrons (6s2) which is not unusual for tetracoordinated lead(II).37Pb(II) complexes surrounded by organophosphorus selenide are limited. Pb{Se2P(OEt)2}2 was first reported by Zingaro et al.,38 but the structure was not well characterized in either the solid state or solution. Besides [Ph(MeO)PSe2Pb]2, Woollins reported mononuclear [Ph(EtO)PSe2]2Pb where both dsepo ligands adopt a chelating coordination mode.32 A decade ago Woollins' group also reported a monomeric lead structure [N(PPh2Se)2]2Pb in which the ligands showed a chelating behavior.39 This group showed monocoordination of the dsep ligand towards Pb(IV), leaving a pendant Se in Ph3PbSeP(Se)(OEt)2.2 Although there is no report of a polymeric structure of lead involving an organophosphorus-selenide ligand, its lighter congener, the organophosphorus-sulfide ligand, is known to form a few polymeric structures with Pb(II) in addition to mononuclear40 and dinuclear41 complexes. For example, Larsson et al. reported two Pb(II) complexes [Pb{S2P(OR)2}2]n (R = nPr and Cy-hexyl) where the ligands adopt a chelate-bridging mode to form a 1D polymer.3a A similar binding mode of the ligand also produced 1D polymers in [Pb{S2P(OiPr)2}2]n3c and [Pb{S2P(OMe)2}2]n3d reported by Lawton and Ito, respectively.NMR studiesThe 1H NMR spectra of two isomers, which display the resonances for the isopropyl protons at typical chemical shifts only, are very similar. The 31P-NMR spectra exhibit a singlet flanked by a pair of Se satellites; in the case of 1β the signal resonates ∼7 ppm upfield from that of 1α, additionally the difference in the 1JPSe value is decreased by 29 Hz for 1β. 77Se NMR spectra of both complexes show a doublet with little difference in the signal position and the coupling constant. The coupling constants obtained from 31P and 77Se spectra are comparable for both isomers. These results clearly indicate that the solution state NMR spectrum is not consistent with the solid state structure of 1α, whose two different binding modes of dsep ligands should give more complex spectra. Since both compounds are soluble in organic solvents whereas the solubility of the polymeric species is rather poor in common solvents, the solution state structures of 1α and 1β may exist in a monomeric and an oligomeric form (vide infra), respectively, which could impose the chemical equivalency to all Se nuclei as well as P nuclei. In addition, the labile nature of the Pb–Se bond at ambient temperature has been confirmed by VT 31P NMR studies for the dsep ligand in the lead complex [Ph3Pb{η1-SeP(Se) (OEt)2}].2 Surprisingly, the variable temperature (VT) 31P NMR spectra of 1α show that the increase in temperature to 60 °C results in the signal shifting from 66 ppm to 58.6 ppm, which is the same chemical shift as found for 1β (Fig. S1†). The 1JPSe also decreases from 669 to 649 Hz as the temperature reaches 60 °C. Cooling the sample to room temperature does not result in restoration of the signal position and the coupling constant. We also measured VT31P NMR spectra of a mixture of 1α and 1β (Fig. S2†). Upon increasing the temperature to 30 °C, an averaged signal at 62.7 ppm is observed. This suggests an equilibrium between the two isomers. Increasing the temperature to 35 °C yields a resonance at 58.2 ppm, which corresponds to the chemical shift of 1β. This suggests that 1α has been converted to 1β in solution at high temperature. Although a slight increase in the temperature changes the bonding mode in the title compound, the 31P NMR spectrum at −90 °C showed only a singlet without any shift in the signal position. This suggests a single species exists for both 1α and 1β at RT. Giffard has reported the conversion of one polymorph to the other for a lead(II) compound Pb(SPh)2 upon heating in the solid state.42 Keeping in mind that one of the dsep ligands adopts a chelated mode in 1α and all are bridging in 1β, we propose that a mononuclear species (1a) like Woollins' compound, [Ph(EtO)PSe2]2Pb,32 and a dinuclear species (1b) are in solution upon dissolving 1α and 1β, respectively. A plausible transformation pathway is displayed in Scheme 2. Scheme 2 PbSe cubes and eight-horned rod dendritesThe surface morphologies of the as-synthesized PbSe structures obtained from the typical solvothermal process with [Pb{Se2P(OiPr)2}2]n as precursors in H2O and PVP at 150 °C for 20 h were first investigated by FESEM, as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c). PbSe microcrystals with irregular shapes were clearly observed in the absence of PVP, as shown in Fig. 2(a). However, the simultaneous use of 10 mL H2O and 0.2 g PVP resulted in the formation of the PbSe crystals with cube-like morphologies as shown in the SEM image of Fig. 2(b). Further increase in the amount of PVP to 0.4 g led to an improvement in the morphology from microcrystals to cubes. The PbSe cubes had edge lengths of about 500 nm, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(c). Fig. 2(d) revealed the XRD pattern of the as-prepared PbSe cubes. Also included is the reference pattern of PbSe with a rock-salt type structure (JCPDS file number 65-1040) for comparison. The pattern was in good agreement with that of the reference PbSe, indicating the as-grown PbSe cubes possess a face-centered cubic crystalline lattice.The as-prepared PbSe cubes were further investigated by TEM and HRTEM in order to determine their single-crystalline characteristics. Fig. 3(a) shows the low-magnification TEM image of the PbSe cubes, indicating the as-grown cubes had edge lengths of about 500 nm which is in good agreement with the inset SEM image of Fig. 3(c). The inset in Fig. 3(a) is the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the as-grown PbSe cubes with the zone axis of the SAED pattern set in the [001] direction. The resulting dot pattern reveals the single crystalline nature of the PbSe cube, which can be indexed to the reflections of the face-centered cubic structure, consistent with the corresponding XRD results. The lattice-resolved image shows lattice spacing of 0.31 nm in good agreement with the d-spacing of the two equivalent (200) and (020) planes of the face-centered cubic lattice of PbSe, and leads to the lattice fringes of the {200} planes marked in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 3(c) displays the TEM-EDS spectrum of a single cube. The copper signal came from the copper grid which was supported by a carbon thin film. The Pb and Se signals were detected in an approximately 1:1 atomic ratio of Pb/Se, confirming the PbSe composition.The PbSe truncated octahedra and eight-horned rod dendrites are clearly identified in the SEM images depicted in Fig. 4(a) and (b). These were generated through the typical solvothermal process at 220 °C in solutions composed of 8 mL ethylenediamine/2 mL H2O and 10 mL ethylenediamine, respectively. Increasing the ethylenediamine concentration changes the morphology of the as-grown structures from truncated octahedra to eight-horned rod dendrites, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 5. The inset in Fig. 4(b) shows that the eight-armed rods have diameters of about 500 nm and lengths of about 1 μm. The XRD pattern of the rod dendrites shown in Fig. 4(c) was also in good agreement with that of the reference rock-salt type structure of PbSe, implying that the as-prepared PbSe eight-horned rod dendrites also possess a face-centered cubic lattice.

The crystalline nature of the PbSe eight-horned rod dendrites was also studied by TEM and HRTEM. The eight-horned rod dendrites could be broken by sonication of the as-collected powders for 60 min in ethanol. These was confirmed by dropping powders on the copper grid for further TEM characterization, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The HRTEM images and corresponding SAED patterns of the marked regions in Fig. 6(b) are shown in Fig. 6(c)–(e). All the resulting dot diffraction patterns in the insets of Fig. 6(c)–(e) revealed the single crystalline nature of the PbSe rod dendrites which can also be indexed to the reflections of the rock-salt structure of PbSe, consistent with the corresponding XRD results. The zone axes of the corresponding SAED patterns were all set in the [0-11] direction. The lattice-resolved images showed two interlayer distances. One of the interlayer distances, 0.31 nm, is related to the d-spacing of the (200) plane, while the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm is in good agreement with the d-spacing of the two equivalent (111) and (-111) planes of the face-centered cubic lattice of PbSe [Fig. 6(c)–(e)]. These facts imply that the cubic core is composed of six {200} planes and the eight-horned rods are grown along the eight equivalent [111] directions, respectively. To further clarify the morphologies of the PbSe eight-horned rod dendrites, low-magnification TEM images with different tilted angles are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(b) and (d) are the TEM images at a tilt angle of 20° in Fig. 5(a) and (c), respectively, revealing the eight-armed rods with a growth direction of [111], protruding to the eight corners of the truncated cube core composed of six {200} planes, as clearly shown in Fig. 5(c). Fig. 7 displays the TEM-EDS spectra of a PbSe eight-armed rod dendrite, with the copper signal originating from the copper grid. Nevertheless, the presence of a 1:1 Pb/Se atomic ratio confirms the PbSe composition both in the core and armed rods.

(c)–(e) are the HRTEM images of the marked regions in (b). The insets in (c)–(e) are the corresponding SAED pattern of the PbSe eight-horned rod dendrite.  Fig. 7  TEM-EDS spectra of PbSe eight-horned rod dendrite.  Fig. 8  Raman spectra of PbSe eight-horned rod dendrites with collection times of (a) 60 s and (b) 120 s, respectively. Probable reasons for the different shapes of the PbSe crystals can be proposed. For the face-centered cubic lattice of PbSe, the resulting shapes mainly depend on the ratio of the growth rate in the <100> and <111> directions.17,43 The faster growth rate of the <111> direction favors the cube shapes, whereas that of the <100> direction prefers the octahedral shapes.43 The capping molecules, the shape controlling reagents, can be absorbed on the crystal surface to change the surface energy as well as growth rates of the crystals. In this work, both the capping reagents, PVP and ethylenediamine, were used to bind the {200} planes to block the growth rate of the <200> direction, leading to the enhancement of the growth rate in the <111> direction.17 As a result, the cube shape of PbSe is successfully grown using PVP as the capping agent which binds via either the O or N atom of the pyrrolidone ring to the {200} planes due to the steric effects, as shown in Fig. 2(c). In the case of ethylenediamine, two amine groups bind strongly on the {200} planes accelerating the growth rate along the <111> direction, resulting in the formation of eight rods protruding on the eight corners of truncated cubes, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5.Fig. 8(a) and (b) illustrate the Raman spectra of the as-prepared PbSe eight-horned rod dendrites with collection times of 60 s and 120 s, respectively. The as-grown samples were excited by a 512 nm laser beam with the power set at about 4 mW. All peaks of Fig. 8(a) can be attributed to the longitudinal (LO) and transverse (TO) optical phonon modes of the PbSe rod dendrites with a laser exposure time of 60 s. The peak at 140 cm−1 can be assigned to the first-order LO phonon mode, while those at 171, 235 and 280 cm−1 are contributed to the second-order LO(X), LO(Δ) and LO(Γ) phonon modes of the PbSe rod dendrites, respectively.44 As the laser exposure times increased from 60 to 120 s, photo-oxidation of the as-prepared PbSe samples takes place. A similar phenomenon was observed in a PbS nanowire.45 The peaks in Fig. 8(b) have dramatically changed, as compared to those in Fig. 8(a), due to photo-oxidation of the as-grown PbSe deposits. The photo-oxidation causes the oxidation of PbSe rod dendrites to destroy the PbSe composition, which results in the probable formation of Pb–O under the long exposure time of the laser beam. As a result, the peaks arising from low- and high-order LO and TO phonon modes disappear, and the dominant peak at about 135 cm−1 can be assigned to the Pb–O–Pb stretching in Fig. 8(b).45 It seems that the optimal power, wavelength and exposure times of the excited laser beam should be carefully manipulated in investigations of phonon vibrational behaviors of lead chalcogenides via Raman scattering due to its ease of photo-oxidation.ConclusionWe have successfully synthesized the new polymeric complex, [Pb{Se2P(OiPr)2}2]n, and determined its structure by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. One of the species (1α) among the two pseudo polymorphs identified could be converted to the other (1β) at around 35 °C. Thus 1β is the true SSP in the solvothermal process. For the first time, the use of polymeric SSP of [Pb{Se2P(OiPr)2}2]n to prepare PbSe structures, cubes and eight-armed rod dendrites, via the solvothermal process with the inclusion of the capping agents, PVP and ethylenediamine, is demonstrated. Upon addition of PVP, single crystalline PbSe cubic structures with edge lengths of about 500 nm could be synthesized, while the single crystalline rod dendrites with eight rods protruding on the eight corners of truncated cubes could be prepared with ethylenediamine as an additive. The as-prepared rods had diameters of about 500 nm and lengths of about 1 μm. To investigate the phonon vibrational behaviour of the rod dendrites, the Raman spectra are also studied. The peaks arose from low- and high-order LO and TO phonon modes are displayed under the short exposure time of the laser beam, while that of the Pb–O–Pb stretching mode is observed with the longer exposure time due to the photo-oxidation. Thus the optimal exciton wavelength, power, and exposure time of the laser beam should be carefully considered in the analysis of phonon vibrational modes of lead chalcogenides. The proper choice of solvent and capping agent may lead to the formation of PbSe nanostructures with edge lengths of less than 100 nm. Our research will continue in this direction.
