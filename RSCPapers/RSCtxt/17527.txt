ChinaReceived 27th July 2013, Accepted 23rd September 2013First published on 25th September 2013AbstractA new A′–A–D–A–A′ type low band gap small molecule Cz-TBT-CAC8 with 2,7-carbazole as the center donor (D), benzothiadiazole as an electron acceptor (A) and alkyl cyanoacetate as another electron acceptor (A′) has been designed and synthesized as the donor material for the solution-processed bulk hetero-junction solar cells. This small molecule possesses a low lying HOMO level at −5.30 eV and an optical band gap of 1.73 eV. The solar cell based on Cz-TBT-CAC8/PC61BM blend film spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution exhibits a PCE of 2.87% with a high Voc of 1.05 V. After adding 0.2% DIO into the chlorobenzene solution as an additive, the PCE was further improved to 3.95% with a Voc of 1.03 V, a Jsc of 7.32 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.52.IntroductionOrganic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for renewable energy sources due to their advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, light weight, and the capability to fabricate flexible large-area devices.1–6 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been achieved for solution-processed bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) OSCs based on blends of polymer donors and fullerene acceptors.7,8 Compared with their polymer counterparts, small molecules offer potential advantages in terms of well-defined molecular structure, easy purification and mass-scale production, good batch-to-batch reproducibility and easier band structure control.4,9,10 Recently, PCE of solution-processed OSCs based on small molecules reached 8%,11,12 but their overall performance is still significantly behind that of their polymer counterparts, therefore more small molecules need to be synthesized and evaluated in OSCs.In order to realize highly efficient small molecules based OSCs, an ideal donor material should possess both a low band gap (Eg) and a low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level. A low Eg will favor the harvest of solar photons at longer wavelength, providing a larger short-circuit current density (Jsc) of OSCs, while a low HOMO energy level can increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of OSCs.13 As an excellent electron-donating building block, 2,7-carbazole has been used to construct organic/polymer donor materials with rather low HOMO levels, which lead to high Voc for their OSCs.14–16 Recently, we reported OSCs based on an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type small molecule (Cz-TBT, Fig. 1) with 2,7-carbazole as the core donor, which exhibited a high Voc up to 1.02 V.17 However, due to its large band gap (Eg), the optimized PCE was still rather low. In order to reduce the band gap, electron rich oligothiophenes (D′) were used as end groups to build D′–A–D–A–D′ type molecules. Although lower Eg were obtained, their HOMO levels were up-shifted at the same time, resulting much lower Voc, which were unfavorable to improving their PCEs. Therefore, it would be much desirable to develop a lower band gap donor material with a low HOMO level as Cz-TBT. Fig. 1  Chemical structures of Cz-TBT and Cz-TBT-CAC8. Herein, we report an A′–A–D–A–A′ type low band-gap small molecule Cz-TBT-CAC8 (Fig. 1) with alkyl cyanoacetate as an electron acceptor end group (A′).18–20 Through introducing an electron-withdrawing unit instead of an electron-donating unit as the end group for Cz-TBT, we envisioned that lower Eg could be achieved by decreasing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level without sacrificing the low HOMO level. As we expected, the absorption range of the Cz-TBT-CAC8 is really extended to longer wavelength, while its HOMO level is still similar to that of Cz-TBT. Solution-processed OSC based on blend film of Cz-TBT-CAC8 and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) spin-coated from their chlorobenzene (CB) solution shows a PCE of 2.87% and a high Voc of 1.05 V. By using 0.2% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive, the PCE was further improved to 3.95%.Experimental sectionMaterialsUnless otherwise specified, all chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were distilled over sodium/benzophenone ketyl prior to use.CharacterizationThe 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 400M NMR spectrometer, and chemical shifts were recorded in ppm with tetramethylsilane as interval standard. Mass spectra were obtained with a LDI-1700 MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer series 7 analysis systems under N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured by a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a Chi660b electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode cell in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) in dry CH2Cl2 solution under an argon atmosphere at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and using ferrocene as standards. A glass carbon disk (2 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode with a Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level were estimated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential relative to the reference energy level of Fc/Fc+ (4.8 eV below vacuum). The thickness of the active layer was measured using a Dektak 6 M surface profilometer. TEM experiments were performed on a JEM-1011 (JEOL Co., Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The TEM specimens were prepared by transferring the spin-coated films to the 400 mesh copper grids.Hole mobilities were measured according to a similar method described in the literature,21 using a diode configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au by taking current–voltage curves in the range of 0–8 V. Mobilities were extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship.22Theoretical calculationsGeometry optimizations were computed by the density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 program.23 To simplify the calculation, alkyl chains were replaced by CH3 groups.Fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs)BHJ solar cell devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDTO:PSS/donor:PCBM/LiF/Al. The ITO glass was pre-cleaned and modified by a 35 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P4083) layer which was spin-coated from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution on the ITO substrate, and was dried subsequently at 120 °C for 30 min. Then, the substrates were transferred into a glove box filled with N2. A chlorobenzene (or chlorobenzene with DIO) solution of a blend of donor/PCBM was spin-coated on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer. The LiF (∼1 nm)/Al (∼100 nm) cathode was thermally deposited atop the active layer in vacuum chamber under a base pressure of about 4 × 10−4 Pa. The cell active area was 0.12 cm2, which was defined by the overlapping area of the ITO and Al electrodes. The current–voltage (J–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. An Oriel 150 W solar simulator with an AM 1.5G filter was used to provide an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 for illumination of the photovoltaic cells. The light intensity was monitored by a standard Si solar cell. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum were measured using a Model SR830 DSP Lock-in Amplifier coupled with a SBP500 monochromator, a DSC102 data acquisition system and a Model SR540 chopper controller. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with standard single-crystal Si photodiode.Synthesis5-(4-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-7-yl)thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (1),24 9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole(3)25 were synthesized following the reported methods.5-(4-(5-Bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-7-yl) thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (2). In a 100 mL single-neck round bottom flask, 1 (602 mg, 1.83 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (50 mL) under dark condition, and then a solution of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (327 mg, 1.83 mmol) in 10 mL DMF was added dropwise. After the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 24 h, the reaction mixture was poured into water (150 mL). The mixture was filtrated, and the brown precipitate was washed with 50 mL hot chloroform and then dried under vacuum.

The resulting mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 for three times. The organic layer was collected, washed with water, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica, petroleum ether–CH2Cl2 = 1:1 to CH2Cl2) to give the product as a dark red solid (0.88 mg, 91%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): δ 9.98 (s, 2H), 8.25 (s, 2H), 8.21 (d, 2H, J = 4.0 Hz), 8.08 (s, 2H), 8.01 (d, 2H, J = 7.7 Hz), 7.94 (d, 2H, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.88 (s, 1H), 7.84 (d, 2H, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.71 (s, 1H), 7.58 (d, 2H, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.52 (d, 1H, J = 1.4 Hz), 4.68 (m, 1H), 2.40 (m, 2H), 2.03 (m, 2H), 1.29 (m, 6H), 1.18 (m, 18H), 0.78 (t, 6H, J = 6.8 Hz). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm): δ 182.94, 152.47, 148.68, 148.00, 143.35, 137.94, 136.78, 129.86, 128.05, 127.87, 127.43, 124.67, 124.29, 124.09, 120.90, 117.70, 56.27, 34.01, 31.92, 29.52, 29.36, 29.22, 26.88, 22.54, 14.07.

Cz-TBT-CHO (424 mg, 0.4 mmol) was dissolved in a solution of n-octyl cyanoacetate (473 mg, 2.4 mmol) in dry THF (60 mL) and then three drops of piperidine was added and the resulting solution was stirred for 48 h under argon at room temperature. The resulting mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 for three times. The organic layer was collected, washed with water, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica, petroleum ether–CH2Cl2 = 1:2 to CH2Cl2) to give the product as a black solid (520 mg, 92%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): δ 8.33 (s, 2H),8.24 (m, 4H), 8.08 (m, 2H), 8.01 (d, 2H, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.91 (d, 2H, J = 7.6 Hz), 7.86 (m, 3H), 7.69 (s, 1H), 7.55 (d, 2H, J = 7.7 Hz), 7.50 (m, 2H), 4.69 (m, 1H), 4.30 (t, 4H, J = 5.8 Hz), 2.40 (m, 2H), 2.05 (t, 2H, J = 11.3 Hz), 1.76 (m, 4H), 1.35 (m, 26H), 1.16 (m, 18H), 0.90 (t, 6H, J = 7.0 Hz), 0.78 (t, 6H, J = 6.6 Hz). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm): δ 162.81, 152.24, 152.13, 148.79, 147.94, 145.79, 142.95, 139.71, 137.95, 137.74, 136.00, 131.54, 129.89, 128.01, 127.84, 127.26, 124.30, 124.01, 123.37, 122.32, 120.63, 117.49, 115.97, 108.30, 105.65, 98.37, 66.62, 56.60, 33.89, 31.81, 29.59, 29.47, 29.34, 29.24, 29.21, 28.56, 27.00, 25.83, 22.68, 14.12. MALDI-TOF (m/z): M+ calculated for C81H89N7O4S6, 1415.53; found 1415.5.Results and discussionSynthesis and characterizationThe synthetic route of the A′–A–D–A–A′ type molecule is shown in Scheme 1. 5-(4-(Thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-7-yl) thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (1) was synthesized by a Vilsmeier reaction from 4-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole following the procedure reported in literature,24 which was brominated with NBS to yield compound 2. Compound 2 was then coupled with 9-(heptadecan-9-yl)-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole (3) by Suzuki reaction to afford compound Cz-TBT-CHO. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation reaction of Cz-TBT-CHO and n-octyl cyanoacetate was carried out to give the final product Cz-TBT-CAC8. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measured at 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen reveals that Cz-TBT-CAC8 has excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) at 368 °C (Fig. 2), which is good enough for the application in OSCs devices. The DSC traces show no melting peak from room temperature to 290 °C, suggesting that it could be amorphous. Scheme 1  Synthetic route of Cz-TBT-CAC8.  Fig. 2  TGA curve of compound Cz-TBT-CAC8. Optical propertiesThe UV-vis absorption spectra of Cz-TBT-CAC8 in both dilute dichloromethane solution (concentration: 5.0 × 10−6 mol L−1) and solid film were shown in Fig. 3. Cz-TBT-CAC8 exhibited strong absorption in the visible region (300–700 nm) in both solution and film state. In solution, the absorption peak around 385 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone, whereas the lower energy absorption band peaking at 539 nm with a high extinction coefficient of 1.05 × 105 M−1 cm−1 can be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition. Relative to its absorption in solution, the absorption peak at 569 nm of Cz-TBT-CAC8 as thin film is bathochromically shifted by 30 nm, indicating a strong intermolecular interactions exist in the solid state. The absorption edge of Cz-TBT-CAC8 was extended from 622 nm in solution to 718 nm in film, corresponding to a bandgap of 1.73 eV. Compare to our previous reported Cz-TBT (Eg = 2.02 eV),17Cz-TBT-CAC8 exhibits evident bathochromic shifts, suggesting more efficient light harvesting and therefore higher short-circuit current (Jsc) for OSCs based on Cz-TBT-CAC8. Fig. 3  UV-vis absorption spectra of Cz-TBT-CAC8 in dichloromethane solution (5.0 × 10−6 mol L−1) and solid film. Electrochemical propertiesIn order to investigate the electrochemical property of Cz-TBT-CAC8, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The HOMO and LUMO energies were estimated to be −5.30 eV and −3.55 eV from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, assuming the energy level of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) to be −4.80 eV below the vacuum level.26 Compared with Cz-TBT, introduction of the alkyl cyanoacetate as the end group maintained the low HOMO level and decreased the LUMO level significantly, thus reducing the band gap to 1.75 eV, which is in good agreement with the optical band gap. The fairly low-lying HOMO level (−5.30 eV) of Cz-TBT-CAC8 guaranteed high Voc of its OSCs, because the Voc is proportional to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor.13 Meanwhile, the LUMO level of Cz-TBT-CAC8 is 0.35 eV higher than that of PC61BM (−3.90 eV), promising efficient photoinduced electron transfer at the interface between them.27 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammogram of Cz-TBT-CAC8 in a dichloromethane solution of 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 with scan rate of 100 mV s−1.

As shown in Fig. 5, its HOMO orbital is delocalized almost throughout the whole molecule, while the LUMO orbital is mainly localized on the electron deficient dithiophene benzothiadiazole groups and alkyl cyanoacetate groups. The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels are −5.30 eV and −3.21 eV, respectively. Compared with the calculated results of Cz-TBT (HOMO: −4.93 eV and LUMO: −2.64 eV), the electron-withdrawing end group lead to a much larger decrease of the LUMO level than the HOMO level, thus resulting a lower Eg (2.09 eV relative to 2.29 eV of Cz-TBT). The calculation results are consistent with the experimental data. Fig. 5  Theoretical calculated HOMO and LUMO of Cz-TBT-CAC8. Photovoltaic propertiesTo demonstrate the potential application of this A′–A–D–A–A′ small molecule in OSCs, Cz-TBT-CAC8 was used as an electron donor and PC61BM was used as an electron acceptor to fabricate solution-processed bulk heterojunction OSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC61BM/LiF/Al. Chlorobenzene (CB) was used as spin-coating solvent. The results are summarized in Table 2. The donor/acceptor weight (D/A) ratios of the active layer were changed from 1:0.5 to 1:3 (Fig. S1†). And a D/A ratio of 1:1 showed the best photovoltaic performance with a high Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 6.44 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.42, leading to a PCE of 2.87%. The high Voc should benefit from the deep HOMO level of Cz-TBT-CAC8. The device with a higher D/A ratio of 1:0.5 exhibited lower Jsc and FF while the device with a lower D/A ratio of 1:2 showed slight lower Voc and Jsc.

As increasing the content of DIO, the FF of the devices was gradually increased from the pristine 0.42 to 0.56 at 0.3% DIO while the Jsc reached a maximum of 7.32 mA cm−2 for the device with 0.2% DIO. And the Voc exhibited a slight decrease as increasing the DIO content. As a result, addition of 0.2% DIO into the blend solution resulted in the best PCE of 3.95% with a Jsc of 7.32 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.03 V, a FF of 0.52, which is 1.4 times of the PCE of the device without DIO. For comparison, devices based on Cz-TBT were fabricated with the same device structure. The optimized D/A weight ratio of Cz-TBT/PC61BM is 1:2 for its OSC with a PCE of 1.64% (Fig. S3† and Table 2). The addition of DIO has no clear effect on the Cz-TBT/PC61BM blend systems. In comparison to the devices based on Cz-TBT, the Jsc of Cz-TBT-CAC8 is much higher, which is mainly attributed to its lower Eg, while the Voc maintained at a high value (>1 V).BHJ OSCs based on Cz-TBT-CAC8/PC71BM were also fabricated and tested (Fig. S4, Table S1†). The optimized D/A ratio for Cz-TBT-CAC8/PC71BM system was 1:2, which exhibited a PCE of 3.03% with a Voc of 1.03 V, a Jsc of 6.95 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.42. However, different from device based on Cz-TBT-CAC8/PC61BM, no improvement was observed by using DIO as the solvent additive, and the PCEs were even lower.The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized devices prepared from Cz-TBT-CAC8/PC61BM (1:1, without DIO and with 0.2% DIO) and Cz-TBT/PC61BM (1:2, without DIO) were shown in Fig. 6b. Device based on Cz-TBT/PC61BM exhibited a response from 300 nm to 650 nm with a maximum of 39% at 500 nm. In comparison, device based on Cz-TBT-CAC8/PC61BM showed broader EQE spectra from 300 nm to 700 nm with a maximum of 39% at 570 nm. The EQE of device based on Cz-TBT-CAC8/PC61BM is much higher at longer wavelength region (from 550 to 700 nm) than that of Cz-TBT/PC61BM based device, which is consistent with their UV-vis absorption profiles. By using 0.2% DIO as the additive, the device exhibited a similar broad response with a higher maximum of 43% at 570 nm, thus resulting an even higher Jsc. The Jsc calculated from the devices from integral of EQE curves are in good agreement with the corresponding Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. Fig. 6  J–V curves (a) and EQE curves (b) of the devices prepared from Cz-TBT-CAC8/PC61BM (1:1, without DIO and with 0.2% DIO) and Cz-TBT/PC61BM (1:2, without DIO). The active layer morphologies of devices based on Cz-TBT-CAC8/PC61BM (D/A ratio: 1:1, with and without DIO) were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 7, the bright regions can be attributed to the Cz-TBT-CAC8 domains, while the dark regions can be attributed to the PC61BM domains due to its high electron scattering density.28 Phase separation in the spin-coated film from the pure CB solution was ambiguous, which become more and more distinct as gradually increasing the DIO content. Spin-coated film from CB with 0.2% DIO exhibited continuous nanoscale phase separation about 10–20 nm, which is approaching to the optimum exciton diffusion length in organic materials.30–32 Further increasing DIO content lead to larger domains, which is unfavorable to the charge carrier generation. Thus, a higher Jsc could be obtained from devices prepared from CB with 0.2% DIO, which is consistent with our OSC results. In addition, the hole mobility of the blending film Cz-TBT-CAC8/PC61BM without DIO is increased from 3.49 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 5.21 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S5†) by using 0.2% DIO, thus improving the charge transportation and collection efficiency and leading to a higher Jsc and FF.

ConclusionsIn summary, a new A′–A–D–A–A′ type molecule (Cz-TBT-CAC8) with a 2,7-carbazole as center donor (D), benzothiadiazole as electron acceptor (A) and alkyl cyanoacetate as another electron acceptor (A′) was synthesized and evaluated in solution-processed OSCs. Through introducing the electron-withdrawing unit (A′) as the end group, Cz-TBT-CAC8 exhibits lower bandgap and almost the same low-lying HOMO level compared with the corresponding A–D–A type molecule (Cz-TBT). Solution-processed BHJ OSC device based on Cz-TBT-CAC8 shows a PCE of 2.87% with a high Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 6.44 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.42. The PCE of the device is further improved to 3.95% with a Voc of 1.03 V, a Jsc of 7.32 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.52 by using 0.2% DIO as the additive. This work demonstrates the A′–A–D–A–A′ type molecules may be promising donor materials for solution-processed OSCs.AcknowledgementsThis paper was financially supported by the 973 Project (2009CB623601, 2009CB930603 and 2014CB643504), the Science Fund for Creative Research Groups (no. 20921061), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 21322403, 51173179, 20904055 and 21074130).Notes and referencesJ.
