    , Accepted 4th July 2011First published on 4th August 2011AbstractWe have demonstrated a new strategy for enhancing solar evaporation by using floating light-absorbing materials. Floating Fe3O4/C magnetic particles with an average size of 500 nm were synthesized by carbonization of poly(furfuryl alcohol) (PFA) incorporated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The Fe3O4/C particles had a BET surface area of 429 m2 g−1, and a density of 1.44 g cm−3. Because of their hydrophobicity and a bulk packing density of 0.53 g cm−3, Fe3O4/C particles were floatable on water. Our results indicated that these Fe3O4/C particles enhanced the water evaporation rate by as much as a factor of 2.3 in the solar evaporation of 3.5% salt water. In addition, Fe3O4/C particles were easily recycled using a magnet, and stable after being recycled three times. Our work provides a low-cost and highly effective way for accelerating solar evaporation for industrial applications such as solar desalination, salt production, brine management and wastewater treatment.

Water
evaporation driven by solar energy is widely used in mining, water and energy industries. Currently solar evaporation processes suffer low water evaporation rate, and the efficiency of solar evaporation needs to be greatly improved in order to reduce the land use, capital investment and operational costs. This paper reports a novel strategy for enhancing water surface evaporation by simply applying a very thin layer of floating photothermal material that absorbs solar energy and heats the water surface effectively. In particular, floating Fe3O4/C particles with an average size of 500 nm were synthesized in this study. Only 115 g m−2 of Fe3O4/C particles (around 200 μm thick layer) were required to achieve an as high as 130% increase in water evaporation rate in the solar evaporation of 3.5% salt water. The solar surface heating demonstrated here provides new insights into solar-heat transfer and evaporation processes at liquid–solid interfaces. In addition, these Fe3O4/C particles showed excellent recyclability. Therefore, this work offers a simple and cost-effective way to improve the energy efficiency of solar evaporation systems for portable clean water production, solar mining, concentrate management in inland desalination plants and wastewater treatment, etc.

Introduction
Solar energy is one source of free energy in the world since it is inexhaustible in supply and use.1,2 Tremendous efforts have been directed toward efficient utilization of sunlight for energy and environmental applications such as concentrated solar power and hydrogen generation, solar cells, photocatalysis, and wastewater treatment.3–5Water evaporation driven by solar energy (known as solar evaporation) is widely used in industries. In particular, the solar evaporation ponds are considered as an effective way to produce various salts such as sea salts and lithium salts, and fresh water from seawater and brines; and they are also used for brine management in inland desalination plants.6–10 Over the past few decades, considerable efforts have been made to increase the water evaporation of the solar ponds by optimizing the design of the solar ponds.11–14 For instance, black plastic bubble sheets were placed at the bottom of the solar ponds to increase sunlight absorption, but the evaporation rate rose only by 10%.14 It is clear that a further enhancement in water evaporation rate is required to improve the efficiency of solar evaporation ponds in order to reduce the land use, capital investment and operational costs.15,16
Here we demonstrate a new strategy for enhancing solar evaporation by using floating light-absorbing materials. The light-absorbing materials that float on water absorb sunlight and convert it to thermal energy, resulting in an increase in the water surface temperature and a remarkable enhancement in water evaporation rate. As an example, carbon particles were chosen as a light-absorbing material because (1) carbon is an excellent photothermal material with high absorbance and low emittance, and a highly selective solar absorber;17–19 (2) carbon material is cheap; (3) its density can be easily tuned by controlling its porosity; and (4) its surface can be hydrophobic, which is essential for its floatability on water. A small amount of photothermic and magnetic iron oxides (Fe3O4) was incorporated into carbon to form Fe3O4/C particles to make light-absorbing particles recyclable using a magnet.20–22 Furfuryl alcohol (FA) was used as a cheap carbon source. Floating Fe3O4/C particles were synthesized by a modified two-step polymerization of FA, and subsequent carbonization.23 The resulting Fe3O4/C particles were characterized and used in water evaporation experiments.
Experimental
Chemicals

          Iron (II and III) oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles, Fluronic F127, furfuryl alcohol (FA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (average molecular weight 10000) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Australia. Sodium chloride, absolute ethanol, hydrochloric acid (32%) and sulfuric acid (98%, H2SO4) were purchased from Merck.

Sample preparation

The floating hybrid particles were obtained by modifying a two-step polymerization of FA reported previously.23 Typically, 1 g of Fe3O4, 10 g of F127, 6 g of water, 30 mL of ethanol, 6 g of FA and 1.4 g of hydrochloric acid were first mixed in a 250 mL capped glass bottle, stirring at room temperature overnight. To this solution, 18 mL of 5 M H2SO4 were added. The resulting solution was transferred into a glass beaker, and heated at 90 °C for 1 h under stirring, allowing the solvents to evaporate. After cooling, PFA particles containing Fe3O4 were washed with deionized water and collected after drying at 90–100 °C overnight. Finally, Fe3O4/C particles were obtained by heating PFA particles under flowing argon gas at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and at 550 °C for 3 h.
Characterization
The Fe3O4/C particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, a JEOL JEM 2011 TEM microscope equipped with a Gatan 894 UltraScan 1000 CCD camera), field-emission scanning electronic microscopy (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7001F microscope operating at 15 kV), and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Philips PW1140/90 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments were performed at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020MC instrument to determine the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and micropore volume (via t-plot method) and pore size distribution (via DFT method); the samples were degassed at 200 °C for 5 h before the measurement. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of samples was carried out using a Mettler Toledo TGA-SDTA851 analyser in the temperature range of 25 to 900 °C under nitrogen or air at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The density of Fe3O4/C particles was determined by a pycnometer (AccuPyc 1330, Micromeritics, USA). To prepare a flat surface for contact angle measurement, a small amount of Fe3O4/C particles was pressed at 5 MPa into a disc, and its contact angle was determined using an OCAH-230 contact angle measuring device (Dataphysics, Germany).
The water evaporation experiments were conducted at room temperature and a relative humidity of 50%. A sunlight simulator (CHF-XM500, 20 A) was used as the light source, and a radiation meter (FZ-A) was used to measure the light intensity. A 10 mL beaker with an inner diameter of 2.2 cm filled with 5 g of 3.5% NaCl aqueous solution (salt water) (its salinity is equivalent to seawater24) was placed under the sunlight simulator. The radiation intensity was varied from 1355 to 430 W m−2.25 The amount of water evaporated was determined by monitoring the weight change. The water surface and bottom temperatures of 5 g and 10 g of 3.5% salt water were measured using two thermocouples, respectively (Type K, Amprobe 38XR-A).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the XRD pattern of Fe3O4/C particles. The hump between 10° and 25° arises from a large amount of amorphous carbon in the sample. Fe3O4 peaks are indexed according to a standard pattern PDF no. 01-089-0950. This indicates that the particles consist of amorphous carbon and crystalline Fe3O4. Fig. 1b shows the SEM image of spherical Fe3O4/C particles, whose average particle size is around 500 nm. Fe3O4/C particles with different sizes and densities can be prepared by varying the synthesis composition (see ESI, Fig. S1†). The TEM image of a representative Fe3O4/C particle is displayed in Fig. 1c, revealing that some Fe3O4 nanoparticles are embedded in the carbon, and their particle sizes are around 20–30 nm. The crystal lattice fringe of Fe3O4 is shown in the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 1d), and its d spacing is determined to be 0.257 nm (i.e., = 2/7.771 nm) using a Digital-Micrograph software in conjunction with fast Fourier transform (FFT) dot patterns shown Fig. 1e, which corresponds to the index (311) for Fe3O4. More TEM images are provided in the ESI, Fig. S3†. Our experiment indicates that the Fe3O4/C particles are magnetic and can be easily attracted by a magnet. In addition, Fe3O4/C particles are hydrophobic in nature, and the contact angle of a disc made from Fe3O4/C particles is 108° (Fig. 1e).

TGA was used to analyse the conversion of PFA and Fe3O4 content in the Fe3O4/C particles. As seen in Fig. 2, the carbonization of PFA starts at around 150 °C and ends at 550–600 °C in nitrogen. The carbon yield is around 50%. On the other hand, the oxidation of Fe3O4/C particles commences at about 300 °C and carbon combustion is complete at 480 °C in air. Note that the mass gains at around 325 °C and above 480 °C are attributed to the oxidation of FeO to Fe2O3. The content of Fe3O4 is estimated to be 2% in Fe3O4/C particles.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of Fe3O4/C particles are shown in Fig. 3. The N2 adsorption isotherm is a typical type I isotherm, indicating that Fe3O4/C particles are microporous. The BET surface area and micropore volume of the sample are calculated to be 429 m2 g−1 and 0.16 cm3 g−1, respectively. The pore size of Fe3O4/C particles mainly centres at 0.7 nm, along with a small proportion of pores with sizes of 0.9–1.5 nm. The density of Fe3O4/C particles is determined to be 1.44 g cm−3. It is noted that although the Fe3O4/C particles have greater density than water, their hydrophobic surfaces generate surface tension and additional buoyancy, making the particles float on water. Our experiments show that these Fe3O4/C particles exhibit excellent floatability, and only a very small portion of Fe3O4/C particles adsorbs water and settles down after stirring overnight, and further boiling and ultrasonication for hours (ESI, Fig. S2†). The actual bulk density of packing Fe3O4/C particles is measured to be 0.53 g cm−3 and the volume of interparticle voids is calculated to be 63.1%. Because Fe3O4/C particles are hydrophobic and microporous, water vapour would more likely pass through the interparticle voids than microporous channels of Fe3O4/C particles.

To determine the light absorption capacity, different amounts of Fe3O4/C particles were spread evenly on the bottom of a beaker, and the radiation intensity of the simulated sunlight was measured with and without 3.5% salt water, as shown in Fig. 4. The radiation intensity decreased from 1355 W m−2 to 1200 W m−2 after the sunlight passed through the empty beaker, indicating that 135 W m−2 was absorbed by the beaker. It was significantly reduced from 1200 W m−2 to 100 W m−2, when 58 g m−2 (0.023 g) of Fe3O4/C particles were spread uniformly at the bottom of the empty beaker. When the amount of the Fe3O4/C particles rose to 115 g m−2 (0.045 g), the radiation intensity further dropped close to zero. On the basis of the packing density of 0.53 g cm−3, the Fe3O4/C layer thicknesses were calculated from their weights and presented in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that only about 200 μm thick (0.045 g) Fe3O4/C layer is sufficient to absorb all sunlight. In addition, the absorption capacity of Fe3O4/C particles floating on 3.5% salt water is similar, and 115 g m−2 of particles fully absorb the sunlight; the difference in intensity reduction between with and without salt water is due to sunlight absorption by the salt water while the amount of Fe3O4/C is less than 115 g m−2.

The effect of Fe3O4/C particles on the water evaporation rate was studied using 3.5% salt water at a sunlight intensity of 1355 W m−2. A given amount of Fe3O4/C particles was floating on 5 g of salt water in a 10 mL beaker under the sunlight simulator. As shown in Fig. 5, the water evaporation rate increased as the amount of Fe3O4/C particles was varied from 58 to 115 g m−2. The amount of water evaporated reached around 12.3 L m−2 after exposure to sunlight for 5.5 h while the evaporation rate was 2.30 L m−2 h−1. But when the amount of particles was raised to 256 g m−2 (0.1 g), the evaporation rate slightly dropped (Fig. 5a and b). This is probably due to a limited heat exchange process between the Fe3O4/C layer and surface water when the Fe3O4/C layer is too thick. This result indicates that a 130% increase in water evaporation was achieved when around 115 g m−2 (0.045 g) was applied. For comparison, 115 g m−2 (0.045 g) of Fe3O4/C particles were dispersed in 3.5% salt water by adding 0.001 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone as a dispersant (Fig. S2†). The water evaporation rate in this dispersed Fe3O4/C system was 1.26 L m−2 h−1, which was 104% lower than the floating system with the same amount of Fe3O4/C particles added.
 Fig. 5  (a) The amount of water evaporated, (b) the water evaporation rate as a function of the amount of floating Fe3O4/C particles and dispersed Fe3O4/C particles, (c) the amount of water evaporated using fresh Fe3O4/C particles and Fe3O4/C particles recycled three times, and (d) photo of floating Fe3O4/C particles attracted by a magnet for recycling. 
After the evaporation experiment, the Fe3O4/C particles were collected by a magnet (Fig. 5d) and repeatedly washed by deionized water until the conductivity of spent water is close to 0, ensuring that the NaCl possibly absorbed on Fe3O4/C particles was completely washed away. The amount of water evaporated of the salt water with Fe3O4/C particles recycled three times were almost the same as that with the fresh ones (Fig. 5c). Therefore, the magnetic Fe3O4/C particles are stable and easily recycled in the solar evaporation process.
The enhancement of solar evaporation using floating light-absorbing particles was also modelled, and the modelling procedures are provided in the ESI†. Fig. 6 compares the experimental and the predicted cumulative amounts of water evaporated for both cases of with and without the light-absorbing particles. There is enough consistency between the predicted and the experimental results for both cases. But the overall predicted evaporation rates are somewhat greater than the experimental ones. In the case of the presence of floating particles, the experimental evaporation slows down at the end of the evaporation process because of the increased salinity of salt water. In addition, the model was developed using the insulation boundary conditions, while during the experimental tests, there was some heat loss from the boundary walls of the salt water beaker. That is another reason for the increased gap between the predicted and the experimental evaporation rates as the evaporation process proceeds. The modified Penman's correlation was used to calculate the free evaporation rate from the surface without using the light-absorbing particles.26 Because the modified Penman's correlation was developed for the steady-state condition, the actual amount of water evaporated was slightly lower than the predicted one. Note that the modelling result shows light-absorbing particles can enhance the water evaporation rate by a factor of 2.3, which is in good agreement with the experimental result.

To better understand the enhanced solar evaporation system, the surface (Fe3O4/C layer) and bottom temperatures of salt water were monitored during the water evaporation process and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The surface temperature of 5 g salt water with 115 g m−2 (0.045 g) of floating Fe3O4/C particles increased quickly in the first one hour and finally reached around 68 °C, which was 13 °C higher than that of salt water without Fe3O4/C particles. In contrast, the bottom temperature rose slowly and only amounted to 50 °C, which was 18 °C lower than the surface temperature. When the same amount of Fe3O4/C particles was dispersed in 5 g of salt water, the surface temperature only reached 55 °C while the bottom temperature was 52 °C (ESI, Fig. S5†). The difference in temperature between the surface and bottom increased to 20 °C when the amount of salt water was doubled to 10 g whereas the surface temperature of 10 g of salt water was 3 °C lower than that of 5 g of salt water. These results indicate that the floating Fe3O4/C particles are much more effective in increasing the surface temperature than dispersed Fe3O4/C particles, and thus largely enhancing the surface evaporation rate.
 Fig. 7  The surface (Fe3O4/C layer) and bottom temperatures of salt water change with time under the sunlight radiation. 
The effect of the sunlight radiation intensity on the water evaporation rate was also studied. Not surprisingly, Fig. 8 shows that the water evaporation rate is closely related to the sunlight radiation intensity, and the water evaporation rate decreases from 2.3 to 0.53 L m−2 h−1 as the radiation intensity was adjusted from 1355 to 430 W m−2. At 1000 W m−2, 115 g m−2 of Fe3O4/C particles led to increased water evaporation rate of 3.5% salt water by a factor of 1.9.

Conclusions
We have shown that floating Fe3O4/C magnetic particles were prepared by carbonization of PFA embedded with Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The Fe3O4/C particles absorbed sunlight radiation and improved the water evaporation rate by as much as a factor of 2.3 in the solar evaporation of 3.5% salt water. Furthermore, after being recycled three times using a magnet, the performance of these particles remained almost the same. Therefore, this work offers an attractive alternative to improve the energy efficiency of solar evaporation systems for many industrial applications such as solar desalination, salt harvesting, concentrate management in inland desalination plants and wastewater treatment.
