1. Introduction
GaN and its related III-nitrides have been attracting remarkable interest due to their excellent properties, which make them suitable for applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes (LDs), high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), etc.1–5 By now, GaN-based optoelectronic devices, particularly, LEDs prepared on sapphire substrates have already been commercialized.6–8 However, due to the relatively large mismatches in lattice parameters and thermal expansion coefficients between GaN and sapphire,9,10 the formation of large stress and high dislocation density takes place in the as-grown GaN-based wafers, which deteriorates the performance of GaN-based optoelectronic devices, and hampers the further development of these devices. In order to circumvent this issue, researchers have tried hard to grow GaN films on unconventional oxide substrates other than sapphire, such as MgAl2O4, LiGaO2, LiAlO2, LaAlO3, LaSrAlTaO6 (LSAT), ZnO, MgO, etc.11–18 Compared with the sapphire substrates, these unconventional oxide substrates have superior properties in some aspects. On the one hand, they show very small lattice mismatch with GaN, which is good for the nucleation of GaN films during the initial growth and therefore benefits the growth of high crystalline quality GaN films. For example, the lattice mismatch between LiGaO2 and GaN is as low as 0.9%, and that between LSAT and GaN is 1%. On the other hand, some oxide substrates, such as LiGaO2 (100), LiAlO2 (100), etc., are suitable for the preparation of nonpolar GaN-based devices. These nonpolar GaN-based devices are absent from the so-called quantum confined Stark effects (QCSEs) which cause the bending of the hole and electron wave functions in the quantum wells, and lead to the increase of the radiative recombination efficiency ultimately.
In this work, we review on the recent progress of the epitaxial growth of GaN films on unconventional oxide substrates. The perspectives for the epitaxial growth of GaN films on unconventional oxide substrates are also discussed.
2. Epitaxial growth of GaN films on unconventional oxide substrates
2.1 MgAl2O4
MgAl2O4 is a crystal material which has a face-centered cubic unit cell with a lattice parameter of 0.8083 nm and belongs to the Fd3m space group.29Fig. 1 illustrates the crystal structure of MgAl2O4. As shown in Table 1, MgAl2O4 has smaller mismatches in both the lattice parameter and thermal expansion coefficient with GaN when compared with that of sapphire. The lattice mismatch between MgAl2O4 (111) and GaN (0002) is 9.5%,29 which is smaller than that between GaN and sapphire (13.3%). The mismatch in the thermal expansion coefficient between MgAl2O4 and GaN (12%) is also smaller than that between GaN and sapphire (34%) (Table 2).30

Another merit of the MgAl2O4 substrate is its high thermal conductivity. As known, almost 70% of the input electric energy in LEDs would be eventually transferred into heat,31 which leads to the rapid warming of LEDs and thereby reduces the chance of radiation recombination. Consequently, thermal conductivity of a substrate is of significance in determining the performance of LEDs. As for the MgAl2O4 substrate, its thermal conductivity at room temperature is about 116 W mK−1, which is about four times higher than that of sapphire, i.e. 33 W mK−1.29 In this regard, for the fabrication of high-power GaN-based LEDs, MgAl2O4 is undoubted to be a promising substrate. In addition, MgAl2O4 belongs to the F3dm space group with (111) as its cleavage plane direction, and can be easily etched by chemicals, which gives advantages for the fabrication of free-standing GaN-based LEDs.32
As cubic MgAl2O4 has a spinel structure, both its (111) and (001) planes could be used for the epitaxial growth of α-GaN which has a hexagonal wurtzite structure, and β-GaN which has a cubic sphalerite structure, respectively.33 However, researchers have demonstrated that there are many grains formed at the interface of β-GaN/MgAl2O4 (001), and a high density of stacking faults as well as microtwins going through the β-GaN, which greatly reduces the crystalline quality of the GaN epitaxial layer.33,34 Therefore, α-GaN is mainly grown on an MgAl2O4 (111) substrate, and its properties are comparable to those of GaN grown on a sapphire (0001) substrate.35

2.1.1 GaN films on MgAl2O4 substrates. 
However, there are still some problems for GaN epitaxy on MgAl2O4 substrates. As MgAl2O4 has high Mg partial pressure, when conducting the epitaxial growth of GaN on MgAl2O4 at high temperature, severe evaporation of Mg atoms will alter the crystalline structure of the substrate surface, and consequently enlarges the lattice mismatch between the GaN and the MgAl2O4. Meanwhile, these evaporated Mg atoms would easily react with Ga atoms and N plasma, resulting in a severe interfacial layer. These problems make the subsequent epitaxial growth of GaN on MgAl2O4 substrates difficult. To solve these problems, various methods have been carried out.
2.1.1.1 Buffer layer. 
Though the lattice mismatch between GaN and MgAl2O4 is smaller than that between GaN and sapphire, it still reaches 9.5%, easily introducing defects into the GaN epitaxial layer. To alleviate this problem, a low-temperature buffer layer, such as GaN, AlN and ZnO, is proposed for the growth of GaN on MgAl2O4.
In the 1990s, Kuramata and Yang et al. grew GaN epitaxial layers by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on MgAl2O4 substrates.33,36 A low-temperature GaN buffer layer is firstly deposited at 550 °C, followed by a 2.7 μm-thick GaN film grown at 1050 °C. Characterization indicates that the thickness of the buffer layer makes a great impact on the optical and electrical properties of the as-grown GaN films. Within a suitable range of the buffer layer thickness, the crystalline quality of GaN films grown on MgAl2O4 substrates by MOCVD is comparable to that grown on sapphire substrates.37
It has been demonstrated that the growth of a buffer layer is an effective approach to suppress the Mg diffusion. Especially, when the buffer layer is thick enough, i.e. more than 30 nm in practice, the diffusion of Mg atoms is limited within the buffer layer. In this way, the quality of GaN epitaxial films is greatly improved. Using this method, Kuramata et al. have achieved high-quality GaN films with very smooth surfaces on MgAl2O4 substrates, as shown in Fig. 2.38

2.1.1.2 Surface treatment. 
As-received MgAl2O4 substrates often have many scratches or other defects on the surfaces,30 which would produce negative effects on the subsequent epitaxial growth of GaN. Therefore, prior to GaN deposition, surface treatment for MgAl2O4 substrates is required.
(1) Thermal annealing. 
Li et al. obtained the atomically flat surface of an MgAl2O4 substrate by thermal annealing.39 MgAl2O4 is annealed for 3 h at 1000 °C in a box made from ceramic MgAl2O4. Fig. 3 shows the typical AFM image for the as-annealed MgAl2O4 surfaces, in which the step and terrace structure with a step height of 0.47 nm can be clearly observed. A GaN film grown on the as-annealed substrate shows high crystalline quality, with the full widths at half maximum (FWHM) measured by X-ray rocking curves (XRCs) for GaN (0002) and GaN (10−10) equal to 0.21° and 0.37°, respectively.30 It indicates that the interfacial reaction between GaN films and MgAl2O4 substrates is effectively suppressed by the application of annealing.

(2) Thermal passivation. 
Thermal passivation for MgAl2O4 substrates in an O2 atmosphere will generate a surface layer of Al2O3. Meanwhile, it will remove the residual contamination on the surface. He et al. proposed a simple interfacial engineering approach to improve the properties of GaN films.29,40 MgAl2O4 substrates are first treated by chemical etching with H2SO4:H3PO4 = 3:1 for 10 min at 90 °C. Further thermal annealing for 3 h at 1000 °C in an O2 atmosphere is then carried out to remove the residual contaminants. GaN films are grown on the as-prepared MgAl2O4 (111) by MOCVD after chemical etching and thermal passivation.40 It shows that the Al2O3 buffer layer is formed in the interface of MgAl2O4 (111)/GaN via thermal passivation. Furthermore, this Al2O3 buffer layer remains stable during the following GaN deposition, which is primarily responsible for the epitaxial growth of high-quality single-crystalline GaN films on MgAl2O4 (111) substrates.
2.1.1.3 PLD. 
Commonly, MOCVD and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) are used for the epitaxial growth of GaN. However, the high growth temperature adopted in both techniques will cause interfacial reactions and result in an interfacial layer between GaN and MgAl2O4, which deteriorates the properties of the subsequently grown GaN. In this case, traditional MOCVD and MBE are not suitable for the epitaxial growth of high-quality GaN on MgAl2O4.41–43 A low-temperature growth technique for GaN is urgently needed.
Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has been proven to be a promising technique for the growth of high-quality GaN films even at low temperature. The pulsed laser supplies enough energy for the migration of precursors on the substrates, and thereby makes the film growth at low temperature possible.44–48 In this regard, the PLD technique is undoubtedly an effective approach for the low-temperature epitaxial growth.
Li et al. achieved the high-quality GaN films on MgAl2O4 (111) substrates at low temperature by PLD.49,50 XRC shows that the FWHM of GaN (0002) is only 0.07°, indicating the high crystalline quality of the GaN epitaxial layer. Fig. 4 shows the AFM image of the as-grown GaN film. The root-mean-square (RMS) value of the surface is as small as 2.4 nm.50 GaN grains are of 500 nm in diameter, and are starting to coalesce with each other, which verifies the two-dimensional growth of GaN at low temperature. Since the epitaxial growth is carried out at low temperature, the evaporation of Mg is effectively controlled under low temperature conditions, and thereby the high-quality GaN films can be successively prepared.

2.1.2 GaN-based devices on MgAl2O4 substrates. 
GaN-based LEDs on MgAl2O4 (111) substrates have been demonstrated by now. Low-pressure MOCVD is used to fabricate high-brightness LEDs with InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on MgAl2O4.51,52Fig. 5 shows the structure for these LEDs. It consists of ten-period InGaN/GaN MQWs, and the InGaN and GaN for each unit cell are 2.5 and 5 nm-thick. Ti/Al and Ni/Au are used as the n- and p-type contacts, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the I–V characteristics of the LED. It presents an abrupt turn-on between 3 and 4 V with a total series resistance of about 15 Ω, which are comparable to those for the LEDs grown on sapphire or grown at atmospheric pressure by MOCVD.41 The electroluminescence (EL) spectrum presents a strong band-edge emission peak at 395 nm with a linewidth of only 12 nm.52

Sun et al. used low pressure MOCVD to fabricate Mg-doped green LEDs on MgAl2O4 (111) substrates.53 The I–V characteristics of these Mg-doped LEDs show a high turn-on voltage around 4.5 V, and the reverse leakage current is only 7 μA at the bias voltage of −10 V. The EL spectrum, as shown in Fig. 7, presents a smaller FWHM value of 60 nm, compared favorably to that of 30 nm reported by Nakamura.54 According to the inset in Fig. 7, the total output power reaches 200 μW at a forward current of 20 mA, which is translated to a conversion efficiency of 0.3%. These results verify the relatively high quality of GaN-based LEDs on MgAl2O4 (111) substrates. Nevertheless, to achieve high-efficiency LEDs on MgAl2O4 substrates, the crystalline qualities and surface morphologies of the as-grown epilayers need to be further improved. Therefore, future works should be focused on the optimization of the InGaN/GaN MQW interface and design of the epilayer structure.

2.2 LSAT
La0.3Sr1.7AlTaO6 (LSAT) has a cubic unit cell with the lattice parameter a = 0.7730 nm. LSAT is a mixed-perovskite crystal, which is another suitable substrate for the growth of GaN.13,55 On the one hand, the lattice parameters of GaN are close to that of LSAT (111) with a mismatch as low as 1%,13,56 as shown in Fig. 8,57 which is beneficial for the nucleation of GaN films and reduces the formation of dislocations in the epilayers. On the other hand, the thermal expansion coefficient of LSAT (111) is 5.8 × 10−6 K−1 that is very close to that of GaN (5.6 × 10−6 K−1),13,56 which helps to alleviate strain accumulation in GaN films during the cooling process. Furthermore, LSAT has a low phase transition temperature that is advantageous for achieving high-quality LSAT crystals free of twins.58 In short, these properties make LSAT (111) a superior substrate for the epitaxial growth of high-quality GaN-based LED wafers.

2.2.1 GaN films on LSAT substrates. 
Many researchers have tried hard to grow GaN films on LSAT substrates.59–62 Sumiya et al. grew GaN films by MOCVD at a high temperature of 1040 °C,59 which gives the FWHM value for GaN (0002) XRC of 1080 arcsec, revealing a very poor crystalline quality. Łukasiewicz et al. put much effort to grow GaN films on LSAT substrates by MOCVD at a lower temperature of 850 °C.62 Nevertheless, the crystalline quality of GaN films can be further improved, because these GaN films are grown under a relatively high temperature by MOCVD. It is known that LSAT has high oxygen partial pressure,47,63 which would give rise to heavy evaporation of O atoms and then dramatic interfacial reactions, and significantly reduce the crystalline quality and damage the surface morphology of GaN films during the high temperature growth. It has been reported by Li et al. that a low-temperature GaN buffer layer is an easy and effective way to solve this problem.64 They employed MBE to grow a GaN buffer layer on LSAT substrates with a low temperature of 500 °C.64 High-quality GaN films with c-plane oriented have been grown, and the FWHMs for GaN (0002) and GaN (10–12) are 198 and 400 arcsec, respectively. This is in striking contrast to that grown by MOCVD. Meanwhile, a very smooth GaN surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) of 1.2 nm and an atomically abrupt interface have been obtained. These results indicate that high-quality GaN films have been grown on LSAT substrates by low-temperature MBE. The temperature dependence of crystalline quality, surface morphology, and interfacial properties of as-grown GaN films have also been reported.64 They find that with the increase in growth temperature, the crystalline qualities, surface morphologies, and interfacial properties are gradually deteriorated, as shown in Fig. 9–11. Further study by reciprocal space map (RSM) indicates that the as-grown GaN film is found to be ∼0.0094% tensile along its a-axis, and ∼0.025% compressive along its c-axis,57 suggesting that GaN films are almost fully relaxed. Furthermore, the surface roughness of GaN grown on LSAT at 500 °C is in the same level as the up-to-date results for device-ready GaN films grown on sapphire, SiC, and Si substrates using conventional high temperature growth techniques such as MOCVD, HVPE (hydride vapour phase epitaxy), PLD or MBE.65–74 Evidently, a low temperature GaN buffer layer is an effective way to achieve high-quality GaN films for GaN-based devices.

2.2.2 GaN-based devices on LSAT substrates. 
There is a great breakthrough in the fabrication of GaN-based LEDs on LSAT substrates since the high-quality GaN films have been prepared on LSAT by low-temperature MBE.75 Li et al. tried hard to grow high-quality InGaN/GaN MQWs on LSAT substrates.76 The as-grown InGaN/GaN MQWs reveal homogeneous and abrupt interfaces, as shown in Fig. 12. After achieving high-quality InGaN/GaN MQWs, GaN-based LEDs on LSAT have been successfully grown by low-temperature MBE. As shown in Fig. 13, the structure of this LED includes a 4000 nm-thick undoped GaN (u-GaN) buffer layer, a 3000 nm-thick Si-doped n-GaN layer, 7-period MQWs (In0.125Ga0.875N (3 nm)/GaN (12 nm)), a 20 nm-thick AlGaN electron barrier layer, and a 300 nm-thick Mg-doped p-GaN layer. The sharp and strong PL peak is observed at 445 nm with an FWHM of 24.0 nm. Meanwhile, there is an EL emission peak observed at 448 nm with an FWHM value of 22.6 nm collected at an injection current of 20 mA, Fig. 14b. This result is comparable with the commercial GaN-based LEDs on sapphire. The as-grown LED wafers were fabricated into LED chips with the size of 300 × 300 mm2 by the standard procedure to further study their properties. It is believed that the better crystalline quality of epitaxial layers helps to improve the internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Consequently, the light output for the LED on LSAT is larger than that on sapphire at the same injection current, and the forward voltages for the LED chip on LSAT is smaller than that on sapphire with the identical growth process and structure, as shown in Fig. 15a and b. Although the GaN-based LEDs on LSAT exhibits outstanding properties at low injection current, there is a relatively strong efficiency-droop effect with the further increase of injection current. As a result, further studies on the optimization of the growth conditions and the LED device structure should be carried out to improve the performance of LEDs on LSAT substrates.

2.3 LiAlO2
LiAlO2 is tetragonal with cell dimensions a = 0.5169 nm, c = 0.6267 nm, and the space group is assigned to P41212. LiAlO2 is another alternative for the epitaxial growth of GaN. Firstly, the lattice mismatch between LiAlO2 and GaN is as low as 0.1%.17 Secondly, the thermal expansion coefficient of LiAlO2 is 7.1 × 10−6 K−1,17 which matches well with that of GaN (5.59 × 10−6 K−1). Thirdly, LiAlO2 also is a perfect candidate for the epitaxial growth of nonpolar m-plane GaN with a small lattice mismatch of 1.7%,77 as illustrated in Fig. 16. This nonpolar m-plane GaN is free of internal polarization and is an important development tendency for achieving high-efficiency GaN-based LEDs.

2.3.1 GaN films on LiAlO2 substrates. 
Due to the high equilibrium vapor pressure of Li of LiAlO2, Li atoms easily diffuse to the substrate surface and thereby serious interfacial reactions may occur when growing GaN on LiAlO2 at high temperature, which dramatically deteriorates the crystalline quality of GaN films. As mentioned above, various ways can be deployed to solve this problem. Among them, nitridation and buffer layers are the most common ways in MOCVD and MBE.16,78–81 Chou et al. have reported that the appropriate nitridation temperature for LiAlO2 is at the range from 850 to 1000 °C by NH3 plasma.16 A three-step MOCVD process is employed to grow high-quality GaN, which reveals a 2 nm-thick interfacial layer and a striated surface morphology.81 These results are much better than a highly anisotropic morphology grown by RF plasma-assisted MBE.79 Some researchers have tried hard to grow nonpolar GaN on LiAlO2 without a growing buffer layer.78,80 Xu et al. deposit the m-plane GaN films on LiAlO2 (100) substrates by MOCVD with an FWHM for GaN (1-100) of 530 arcsec.78 Later, this value is significantly improved to 112 arcsec by Gerlach et al. using low-energy-ion-beam-assisted MBE.80 This GaN film grown by low-energy-ion-beam-assisted MBE also shows flat and smooth surface morphology, with a RMS roughness value of 0.6 nm.


2.3.2 GaN-based devices on LiAlO2 substrates. 
Researchers prepared InGaN/GaN MQWs on LiAlO2.82–85 It is found that surface segregation of In and compositional fluctuations in m-plane MQWs on LiAlO2 lead to a redshift of the PL spectrum.82 Furthermore, a comparative study reveals that optical polarization anisotropy in both m-plane and c-plane InGaN/GaN MQWs on LiAlO2 is weakened but does not vanish.83 It shall be noted that In concentration has a significant impact on the properties of MQWs. Mauder et al. reported that the PL peak wavelength for m-plane InGaN/GaN MQWs with different In concentrations grown on fully strained GaN/LiAlO2, is stable at higher excitation intensity, as shown in Figs. 17–19.84 The larger PL FWHM values and a pumping-induced PL peak shift towards higher energy would happen if more In is incorporated. The nonpolar m-plane InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs have been grown on LiAlO2 (100) substrates by MOCVD after hard work.86,87 Further investigation indicates that the turn-on voltage of the nonpolar LED is from 1 to 3 V, which is mainly attributed to the high dislocation density of LiAlO2 (100) substrates, Fig. 20. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 21, EL peaks remain stable with the increase in injection current due to the absence of QCSEs. This result clearly demonstrates that nonpolar m-plane InGaN/GaN LEDs can be deposited on LiAlO2 (100) substrates. Although nonpolar m-plane InGaN/GaN LEDs have been obtained on LiAlO2 (100) substrates, the optoelectronic properties for the LEDs need to be further improved. Nevertheless, it opens up a bright prospect for the fabrication of high-efficiency nonpolar m-plane GaN-based LEDs on LiAlO2 (100) substrates.

2.4 LiGaO2
LiGaO2 belongs to an orthorhombic unit cell with dimensions a = 5.402 Å, b = 6.372 Å, and c = 5.007 Å, and its space group is Pna21.88 Compared with the sapphire substrate, the LiGaO2 substrate is superior for the growth of high-quality GaN. Firstly, the LiGaO2 (001) substrate has a small lattice mismatch with the c-plane GaN of 0.2%, Fig. 22. Secondly, the (100) plane of the LiGaO2 substrate has an excellent lattice and structure match to GaN (1-100). The corresponding interface matching orientations are expected to be [001]LiGaO2‖[11-20]GaN, only with a 0.1% mismatch, and [010]LiGaO2‖[0001]GaN with a 4.0% mismatch. Thirdly, the thermal expansion coefficient of LiGaO2 matches well with that of GaN. It can be found that the [120] of LiGaO2 is parallel to the [-12-10] of GaN. The thermal expansion coefficients for the LiGaO2 (100) plane are equal to 4.0 × 10−6 K−1 and 3.8 × 10−6 K−1 along its [010] and [120], respectively, while those for the GaN (1-100) plane are equal to 5.59 × 10−6 K−1 and 3.17 × 10−6 K−1 along its [-12-10] and [0001], respectively.89,90 Fourthly, LiGaO2 can be easily etched by chemicals,91 which makes the free-standing GaN films possible. The last but not the least, large scale LiGaO2 single crystals can be obtained by the Czochralski pulling method.92 From the merits mentioned above, LiGaO2 is no doubt an outstanding candidate for the epitaxial growth of GaN films.

2.4.1 GaN films on LiGaO2 substrates. 
Since the 1990s, the growth of GaN films on LiGaO2 substrates has been carried on for a long time.93–101 In 1997, high-quality GaN on LiGaO2 is successfully achieved by MBE with an FWHM for GaN (0002) of 260 arcsec.95 In the same year, this FWHM value is sharply reduced to 103 arcsec.97 Interestingly, this FWHM value is further decreased to 85 arcsec in the late two years.98 As for MOCVD growth, the early FWHM value of GaN (0002) is 246 arcsec,100 which is close to the result grown by MBE. By now, it is reported that the best GaN films on LiGaO2 is produced by MOCVD with an FWHM for GaN (0002) of 46.7 arcsec and a RMS roughness value of 0.036 nm.99
However, as pointed out, the as-grown GaN films suffer from both the formation of interfacial layers and the evaporation of Li atoms from the LiGaO2 substrates during the initial high temperature growth by using MOCVD or MBE.102,103 In order to overcome these problems, one of the best ways is to create a lithium gettering layer that effectively traps the lithium in the near-substrate region. It has been demonstrated that pure AlGaN or AlGaN/GaN superlattices can be used as the gettering layer.104 Thanks to the effective suppression of the diffusion of Li atoms, a very high-quality GaN has been formed by MBE for the MSM photodiodes with a (004) FWHM value of 80 arcsec.104 Because the heavy evaporation of Li atoms from the substrates is mainly caused by high growth temperature, low growth technology, for example, PLD, could be a superb way for the synthesis of high-quality GaN on LiGaO2.105 It has been widely acceptable that high temperature annealing before growth can clean the residue on the substrate surfaces and lead to atomically flat surfaces, which is beneficial to the growth of high-quality GaN films. According to the characteristic of the diffusion of Li from LiGaO2, Li et al. designed a novel thermal annealing way to suppress the diffusion of Li and to flatten the substrate surface,106 finally obtaining the atomically flat surfaces with a RMS roughness of 0.2 nm by annealing for 3 h at 1050 °C. Comparative research reveals that the FWHM for the as-grown GaN (0002) by PLD on atomically flat LiGaO2 surfaces is as low as 324 arcsec, which is much smaller than 1152 arcsec for GaN grown on the as-received LiGaO2 surface with scratches. In 2010, Li et al. firstly reported on the high-quality nonpolar m-plane GaN on LiGaO2 (100) grown at low temperature by PLD with a dislocation density of ∼10−8 cm−2.107 This work opens up a prospect for fabrication of high-quality nonpolar GaN-based devices on LiGaO2 substrates. Meanwhile, Li et al. reported that high-quality nonpolar a-plane InN with a dislocation density of 3 × 10−9 cm−2 can be grown on LiGaO2 (001) substrates by PLD,108 which opens up a new approach for highly-efficient nonpolar InN devices. These studies from the group of Li et al. cause an increasing interest in growing nonpolar nitrides on LiGaO2 substrates.92,109–111 Possibly, LiGaO2 is an important candidate for the synthesis of nonpolar III-nitride based devices in the near future.


2.4.2 GaN-based devices on LiGaO2 substrates. 
The first device on LiGaO2 substrates is MSM photodiodes reported in 2001.104 Because the heavy evaporation of Li atoms has been successfully and effectively suppressed by the AlGaN/GaN superlattices, high-quality GaN with low dislocation density and low point defect density has been grown on LiGaO2 by MBE.104 Due to the high crystalline quality of GaN, the MSM photodiodes exhibit excellent electrical characteristics and are comparable to the best device that was ever reported.112 The free electron concentration in this structure is estimated at ∼1013–1014 cm−3 which is consistent with capacitance–voltage measurements on similar samples showing less than 1015 cm−3 by using the standard equations for flat-band voltage. A comparative study shows that there is essentially no degradation of the current–voltage characteristics for the two MSM devices before and after the devices were removed from the LiGaO2 substrate and transferred to an oxidized silicon wafer.104,113
As mentioned above, high-quality GaN films have also been successfully grown on LiGaO2 by PLD at low temperature. However, since the growth rate of PLD is quite high, it is rather difficult for PLD to exactly control the very subtle thickness of InGaN/GaN MQWs. In order to solve this problem, the methodology by the combination of PLD and MBE, for the first time, is deployed by Li et al. to achieve high-quality nonpolar m-plane 7-period InGaN/GaN MQWs on LiGaO2 (100) substrates.114 High crystalline quality, abrupt and smooth InGaN/GaN interfaces are verified by HRXRD and HRTEM, as shown in Fig. 23 and 24. This nonpolar MQWs exhibit strong room temperature PL emission at 445 nm with an FWHM of 22.0 nm, Fig. 25, which is in the same level of the commercially available LEDs and semipolar InGaN/GaN LEDs.75,115,116 This work is considered as an important breakthrough by Semiconductor Today magazine,117 firmly proving that high-efficiency nonpolar m-plane InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs and related devices on a LiGaO2 system are promising.

Later, high-quality nonpolar m-plane LEDs have been successfully grown on LiGaO2 (100) substrates by the combination of PLD and MBE technologies,118Fig. 26. Due to the absence of QCSE and high crystalline quality of GaN materials on LiGaO2, the nonpolar LEDs exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties. It has been found that there is a slight blue shift in the wavelength with the increase in current from 20 to 150 mA, Fig. 27a. Furthermore, as the current increases, the EL FWHM for GaN-based LEDs on the LiGaO2 (100) substrate remains constant, while that for GaN-based LEDs grown on the c-plane sapphire substrate gradually increases, as shown in Fig. 27b. The as-grown LED wafers are fabricated into LED chips with the size of 300 × 300 mm2 by the standard procedure to further study their properties. Ohmic contact between nonpolar m-plane p-GaN and p-electrodes and the low forward voltage have been obtained. The light output power (L) value for LED chips on LiGaO2 (100) is much better than that on c-plane sapphire, as shown in Fig. 28a. It can be noted that the best value of EQE for the LED chip on LiGaO2 (100) is 50.8%, Fig. 28b, which is comparable with the reported value of semipolar GaN-based LED chips grown on bulk GaN substrates.119–122 Likewise, these excellent results can be attributed to the high crystalline quality of LEDs on LiGaO2 and the absence of QCSE. In summary, this work clearly proves that the methodology by the combination of PLD and MBE is an effective approach to achieve high-quality nonpolar m-plane GaN-based LEDs on LiGaO2 (100) substrates. Furthermore, this methodology also can be widely used in the application of other chemically vulnerable substrates for the fabrication of GaN-based devices. Due to the successful and broader applications of this new approach, this work is considered as a significant breakthrough by Semiconductor Today magazine.123

2.5 LaAlO3
LaAlO3 (LAO) belongs to the triangle phase with cell dimensions of a = 0.537 nm, b = 0.537 nm, and c = 1.315 nm, which shows about 3% lattice mismatch with respect to the c-plane GaN or a-plane GaN, as shown in Fig. 29a.21 Furthermore, LaAlO3 has a perovskite-like structure (pseudo-cubic, a = 0.3791 nm) that matches well with the nonpolar m-plane GaN with a lattice mismatch of about 4%.124 With the melting point of about 2180 °C, the thermal stability under normal growth conditions makes it an excellent candidate for nitride growth.125 Additionally, 2-inch large scale LaAlO3 is commercially available with relatively low cost. Therefore, LaAlO3 plays an important role in the epitaxial growth of GaN.

A 0.4 μm-thick GaN film has been deposited on LaAlO3 (001) substrates for the first time by Lee et al. with RF plasma-assisted MBE.126,127 Before the growth of GaN films, an AlN buffer layer is formed to reduce the lattice mismatch between GaN and LaAlO3, which can be clearly observed by HRTEM, Fig. 29b. It is found by Ho et al. that a ZnO buffer layer not only increases the crystalline quality of GaN films,128 but also improves the surface morphologies of GaN films. Additionally, Li et al. found that high phase purity m-plane GaN films can be deposited on LaAlO3 with a smooth surface (RMS = 1.2 nm) by PLD.125 However, high-efficiency GaN-based devices prepared on LaAlO3 substrates have not been reported so far.
3. Summary and prospects
In summary, unconventional oxide substrates share much smaller lattice and thermal expansion coefficient mismatches with GaN when compared with sapphire. Meanwhile, almost all of them can be easily etched by chemicals, which makes them superb for fabricating free-standing GaN substrates or vertical structural devices. Additionally, large scale unconventional oxide substrates are already commercially available with relatively low cost. All the considerations mentioned above lead to a conclusion that unconventional oxide substrates are of great significance in the future fabrication of high-quality GaN-based devices. To date, significant breakthroughs of growing high-quality GaN and GaN-based devices on unconventional oxides have been successfully achieved. On the one hand, thanks to the optimized growth condition and the development of growth technology, high-quality GaN films on unconventional oxide substrates have been grown by some common growth techniques, such as MOCVD or MBE. For example, a free-standing GaN substrate with a (0002) FWHM of 46.7 arcsec and a RMS roughness of 0.036 nm has been grown by MOCVD. These breakthroughs of high-quality GaN provide a powerful force for the further development of highly-efficient GaN-based LED devices. On the other hand, the successful application of new technologies make high-quality GaN-based devices on unconventional oxide substrates possible. After effectively suppressing the heavy evaporation of oxide atoms by low temperature RF-MBE, high-quality LEDs on LSAT have been realized. A strong and sharp EL peak for this LED is observed at 448 nm with an FWHM of 22.6 nm at an inject current of 20 mA. Another important breakthrough is high-quality nonpolar m-plane LEDs grown on LiGaO2 (100) by the combination of PLD and MBE technologies. PLD is employed to grow GaN buffer layers at low temperature in order to effectively suppress the diffusion of Li atoms and the interfacial reactions. Subsequently, RF-MBE is introduced to fabricate nonpolar m-plane LEDs. Investigations of these nonpolar m-plane LEDs reveal the excellent optoelectronic properties. The EL peaks remain constant with the increase of injection current from 20 to 150 mA as well as stable EL FWHM values. After these LED wafers are made into chips by a standard process, the EQE for these nonpolar LEDs is as high as 50.8%, which is comparable to the reported value of a semipolar GaN-based LED chip grown on bulk GaN substrates. The combination of PLD and MBE technologies sheds light on the application of other types of thermally unstable substrates for the nitride epitaxy and is believed to be an effective approach for the fabrication of highly-efficient nitride-based devices on unconventional substrates.
As a matter of fact, these breakthroughs of high-quality GaN films and GaN-based LEDs on unconventional oxide substrates can be easily introduced to other GaN-based devices, such as laser diodes, solar cells, photoelectric detectors, field emission transistors, high electron mobility transistors, and so on, due to the fact that the structures of these GaN-based devices are similar to some extent. Hence, the achievement of high-quality GaN films and GaN-based epilayers on unconventional oxide substrates are of significant importance in promoting the development of the semiconductor devices.
However, there are still some obstacles to be overcome for the industrialization of GaN-based devices on unconventional oxide substrates. On the one hand, due to the inherent properties of unconventional oxide substrates, the unconventional oxide substrates are normally of small size. These are in striking contrast to the sapphire and Si substrates, which are of large size (more than 8 inches for Si substrates). Therefore, the technology of preparation of large-size unconventional oxide substrates must be further developed in order to meet the requirement for the industrialization of GaN-based devices. On the other hand, the detailed mechanisms of GaN films grown on unconventional oxide substrates are not thoroughly studied, which is detrimental to achieve high-quality GaN-based epilayers. Furthermore, the optimized structure for GaN-based devices needs to be done to further enhance the performance of GaN-based devices on unconventional oxide substrates.
To conclude, we believe that with further advancement of growth technology, the quality of nitride materials and the performance of relevant devices on unconventional oxide substrates will be further improved. Very possibly, these unconventional oxides will develop into mainstream commercial substrates for the fabrication of GaN-based devices.
