    , Accepted 14th September 2022First published on 16th September 2022AbstractRecently, centimeter-scale monolayer MoSi2N4 (α1-phase) was successfully synthesized in experiments with excellent ambient stability. However, it is an indirect band gap semiconductor, which hinders its wide application. Here, we systematically studied the stability of the structure and optoelectronic properties of two new α1-phase monolayers (MoSi2Sb4 and WSi2Sb4) and a new family of α2-phase monolayer MSi2Z4 (M = Mo, W; Z = P, As, Sb) using first-principles calculations. Our results indicated that all of these monolayer structures showed high structural stability, and the α2-phase structures are more stable than the α1-phase structures. Moreover, all of them have direct band gaps with fascinating optical absorption efficiencies ranging from infrared to visible light. Importantly, the high hole mobility (up to 105 cm2 V−1 s−1) reveals that these monolayer MSi2Z4 will have potential applications in photoelectric devices. In addition, α2-MoSi2P4 possesses a desirable power conversion efficiency of 20.3%. Interestingly, spin–orbit coupling plays a key role in exploring the optoelectronic properties of MSi2Z4 ternary compounds. These new ternary monolayer structures can effectively broaden the 2D materials family and provide promising potential candidates for optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) optoelectronic materials have attracted a great amount of research attention in the past decade because of their tunable band structure, excellent electron transport properties, and large exciton binding energy.1,2 It is well known that the outstanding 2D optoelectronic materials demand both a reasonable direct band gap and ultrahigh carrier mobility.3,4 Therefore, screening innovative two-dimensional (2D) materials with fascinating mobility and a desirable direct band gap is inspired not only by the interest in fundamental research but also by the actual need for applications of optoelectronic devices.
To date, the synthesized transition metal sulfides represented by MoS2 have a sufficient band gap (1.7–2.5 eV) but unimpressively low carrier mobility (∼102 cm2 V−1 s−1).5–7 Although black phosphorus (BP)8 shows extremely high anisotropic carrier mobility and a moderate band gap,9,10 it is prone to oxidative degradation in air,11–13 which hinders its potential applications in electronic devices. Moreover, many other 2D layered optoelectronic materials have been experimentally synthesized, including layered group III–VI (InSe and GaSe),14–16 group IV–V (i.e., SnAs, GeAs, SiAs, GeP3, and SnP3)17–20 and group VI–IV (i.e., PdSe2, GeS, and SnS)21–23 binary compounds, and the corresponding monolayer structures show a desirable band gap and ultrahigh carrier mobility (of up to ∼104 cm2 V−1 s−1). And the AsSb,24 BiAs,25 SiP,26 and BiSb4 were also forecasted to possess tunable band gaps and high carrier mobilities. Recent experimental evidence suggests that ultrathin (2.4 nm) PbSnS2 sheets possess not only a large anisotropic photoresponse but also highly anisotropic hole mobility synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.27,28 Furthermore, the synthesized layered SnP2S6 exhibits excellent photosensitive capabilities in addition to its rich piezoelectric properties and ionic conductivity.29,30 It has been investigated that the synthesized ternary compounds exhibit not only a favorable band gap and carrier mobility but also high stability, and their variable stoichiometric ratios lead to the construction of abundant 2D optoelectronic materials.
Importantly, centimeter-scale monolayer MoSi2N4 (defined as the α1-phase) was successfully synthesized by the CVD method with excellent ambient stability.31 Following the success of monolayer MoSi2N4, more MoSi2N4-like (α1-phase) optoelectronic materials have been predicted theoretically via high-throughput elemental substitution, which notably displays varied electronic properties including antiferromagnetic metals, semimetals, and semiconductors.32–34 However, most of the semiconductors have indirect band gaps (i.e., MoSi2N4),31 which significantly hinders their application.
Therefore, in this work, both monolayer Mo/WSi2Sb4 (α1-phase) and a new family of α2-phase monolayer MSi2Z4 are proposed. We systematically studied the structural stability and optoelectronic properties using the first-principles calculations. Our results show that all of these monolayer structures show high structural stability and antioxidant ability, and in particular, the α2-phase structures are more stable than the α1-phase structures. Moreover, all of them have direct band gaps with fascinating optical absorption efficiencies ranging from infrared to visible light. Furthermore, the high carrier mobility reveals that these monolayer MSi2Z4 semiconductors will have potential applications in photoelectric devices. Importantly, we have minutely discussed the effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC) for optoelectronic properties on monolayer MSi2Z4. In addition, our proposed α2-MoSi2P4 monolayer may have good applications as a donor material for solar cells.
Methods
All of the calculations are implemented using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) which is based on density functional theory.35–37 The generalized gradient approximation of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)38–40 generalization is applied to describe the exchange-correlation generalization.41 The cutoff energy and the k-points were set to be 500 eV and 16 × 16 × 1 for optimization structures, respectively. The convergence criteria for energy and force were set to 10−6 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1. Meanwhile, the vacuum space was set to be over 20 Å. The high-precision Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06)42 was adopted to correct the band gap values underestimated by the PBE. In addition, the van der Waals interactions (DFT-D3)43 correction was used, and the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB)44 method was used to calculate the O2 decomposition of the barrier in monolayer α2-MoSi2P4 surfaces.
Results and discussion
Motivated by the monolayer MoSi2N4 synthesized in experiments, two new α1-Mo/WSi2Sb4 and four α2-MSi2Z4 monolayers (M = Mo, W; Z = P, As) are proposed in our work. The monolayer MSi2Z4 (M = Mo, W; Z = P, As, Sb) is hexagonal lattices and consists of seven atomic films, which can be considered composed of monolayer SiZ (Z = P, As, Sb) and monolayer MZ2 (M = Mo/W, X = P, As, Sb) forming a sandwich-like intercalation structure. The difference between α1-phase and α2-phase monolayer MSi2Z4 is the location of the top and bottom Z atoms, as shown in Fig. 1. The outermost two Z atoms and the W/Mo atoms are located on the same vertical line, as shown in Fig. 1(d). And the full optimization lattice constants of monolayer MSi2Z4 are listed in Table 1.

To verify the structural stability of the optimized crystals MSi2Z4 (M = Mo, W; Z = P, As, Sb), we first estimated the cohesive energy of the crystals, the results are indicated in Table S1 (ESI†). The calculated cohesive energy of α1-MoSi2P4 is −6.506 eV per atom, which is excellently consistent with the prior literature results.45 The cohesive energy of these monolayer MSi2Z4 is negative, and the lowest cohesive energy of α2-MoSi2P4 is −6.786 eV per atom, significantly higher than that of molybdenum disulfide (−4.98 eV per atom)46 and phosphorene (−3.30 eV per atom)47 compounds. Interestingly, the cohesive energy of α2-phase structures is lower than that of α1-phase monolayer MSi2Z4, revealing higher structural stability. Therefore, we mainly discuss the α2-MSi2Z4 conformation in the following study. Furthermore, the vibrational phonon spectra and the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)48 simulations of these monolayer MSi2Z4 (M = Mo, W; Z = P, As) semiconductors were systemically studied at 300 K, the results are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). Clearly, there are no imaginary frequencies found for monolayer MSi2Z4 (see Fig. 2), and the total energy of structural snapshots of the p(4 × 4) supercell at 3 ps (see Fig. S1, ESI†) are convergent, indicating that they are dynamically and thermodynamically stable.

As we know, a part of 2D optoelectronic materials is easily oxidized in ambient air (i.e., phosphorene, PAs, Ti3C2),49–52 which hinders their wide application. Here, taking the monolayer α2-MoSi2P4 as an example, we considered the situation of O2 adsorption decomposition on the p(4 × 4) α2-MoSi2P4 surface, and the results are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Our findings indicate that the O atoms tend to adsorb on top of the P atoms, and the corresponding dissociation barrier is 1.08 eV, which is prominently larger than that on the black phosphorus surface (0.54 eV),53 revealing a high antioxidant ability at room temperature.
Since the electronic structure with the direct band gap is very superior to two-dimensional photoelectric materials, we systemically computed the band structures of these our proposed monolayer MSi2Z4 (M = Mo, W; Z = P, As, Sb). However, the normal PBE grossly underrates the band gap. Taking the α2-MoSi2P4 for example, the band gaps obtained with PBE and HSE06 methods are 0.91 eV and 1.20 eV without SOC, respectively. It is found that the HSE06 band gap is beyond more than 30% compared with that of the PBE level. Thus, the high-precision HSE06 correction was adopted in the following calculations. As we know, the SOC effects may have a large influence on the optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional materials due to the heavy atoms of the compound. Therefore, the electronic structures with SOC effects have been considered for all monolayer MSi2Z4 using the PBE level, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The results indicated that the SOC slightly change the band structures of monolayer MoSi2Z4. On the contrary, for monolayer WSi2Z4, the SOC can significantly reduce the band gaps with still direct band gaps. Thus, the SOC effects are considered to calculate electronic structure and light absorption spectra in monolayer WSi2Z4.
The band structures of these MSi2Z4 (M = Mo, W; Z = P, As, Sb) monolayers are illustrated in Fig. 3, and corresponding band gaps are listed in Table 1. All of these MSi2Z4 monolayers are direct band gap semiconductors, and the valence-band maximum (VBM) and conduction-band minimum (CBM) are located at the K points. It is worth noticing that the band cleavage is stronger in monolayer α2-WSi2Sb4, which will lead to a smaller band gap calculated by HSE06 than that using the PBE level, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The values of the band gap are from 0.07 eV (α2-WSi2Sb4) to 1.20 eV (α2-MoSi2P4), which are located in the favorable range for infrared adsorption. Interestingly, the shapes of the band structures are similar due to the small structural differences between α1-MSi2Z4 and α2-MSi2Z4, but the band gaps are very different. For example, the band gap of α1-MoSi2P4 is 0.97 eV, while the band gap of α2-MoSi2P4 is 1.20 eV. This means that α2-phase MSi2Z4 is more stable, which is in line with our previous conclusion.
 Fig. 3  The electronic band structure of all considered ML MSi2Z4 (M = Mo/W, Z = P, As, Sb) is calculated based on the HSE06 method. Here, the Fermi level is set to zero. The band structures with SOC are considered in monolayer WSi2Z4 (Z = P, As, and Sb). 
Moreover, the orbital contribution of CBM and VBM has also been analyzed by both fat-band structures (see Fig. S5, ESI†) and the density of states (see Fig. 4). Taking the monolayer α1/α2-MoSi2P4 as an instance, the results indicate that the CBMs are mainly contributed by the dz2, dx2−y2, and dxy orbitals of Mo/W atoms, while the VBMs mainly originated from the d orbital of Mo/W atoms. Meanwhile, the optical absorption spectra of both α1- and α2-phase MSi2Z4 monolayers were calculated at the HSE06 level, as shown in Fig. 5. Our results reveal that these monolayer structures exhibit good light absorption ability from the infrared to visible light wavelengths, revealing they may have a higher adsorption efficiency.

 Fig. 5  The light absorption of monolayers (a) α1-MSi2Z4 and (b) α2-MSi2Z4 (M = Mo/W, Z = P, As, Sb) were calculated at the HSE06 level. The light absorption of WSi2Z4 was calculated by considering the SOC effect. 
Carrier mobility is another significant factor in enhancing photoelectric materials’ carrier transport ability. High carrier mobility means that the electron and hole pair produced by adsorption photon can quickly participate in the response, corresponding to a high photoelectric conversion efficiency.54 Therefore, based on the deformation potential (DP) method,55 we systematically investigated the carrier mobilities of both α1- and α2-phase MSi2Z4 at room temperature (300 K). Since the SOC can increase curvature for VBM and CBM for most materials, which will significantly reduce the effective mass, especially for WSi2Z4. Therefore, all of the parameters of carrier mobilities have been calculated with and without SOC, as shown in Table 2. The detailed process calculated is listed in the ESI,† and the corresponding parameters are displayed in Table 2. The corresponding fitting of each parameter is shown in Fig. S6–S11 (ESI†). And the carrier mobility of the x-direction and the y-direction represent the zigzag direction and the armchair direction, respectively. The results indicated that the SOC can slightly influence the deformation potential and elastic modulus. However, the SOC can significantly decrease the effective mass of monolayer MSi2Z4 in most cases. For example, the effective mass of α2-WSi2Sb4 was reduced by more than 58%, which resulted in the largest carrier mobility. The results indicated that most of the electron and hole mobilities are beyond 103 cm2 V−1 s−1. More importantly, α2-WSi2Sb4 presents dramatically large hole mobility of 1.83 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the y-direction with SOC, which is not only beyond those of monolayer α1-MSi2Z4 but also close to that of phosphorene and graphene56,57 (see Fig. 6). Interestingly, it is found that all of the hole mobilities are significantly higher than the electron mobilities (see Table 2). There are two reasons for this. On the one hand, the efficient masses of holes are lower than electrons in most cases, which can be confirmed in curvatures between the CBMs and VBMs in band structures. On the other hand, the low distortion potential of holes can also result in higher hole mobilities. Based on the above, the proposed α2-MSi2Z4 monolayers may be more advantageous for optoelectronic devices on account of their extremely higher carrier mobilities.

 Fig. 6  Calculated hole carrier mobility with/without SOC as shown in Table 2 for monolayer MSi2Z4 (M = Mo/W, Z = P, As, Sb). 
The direct band gap performance of α2-MoSi2P4 calculated using the HSE06 method (with SOC) is 1.07 eV as shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), manifesting that the α2-MoSi2P4 monolayer is well suited as a donor material for solar cells.58 In order to implement the potential applications for solar cells, it is important to look for the suitable substrates of single materials. Our calculations using the HSE06 (with SOC) method show that the vacuum-level corrected CBM and VBM for α2-MoSi2P4 are located in −4.50 eV and −5.57 eV. After careful investigation of multifarious 2D materials, monolayer SIn2Te59 was found to be an outstanding acceptor material for α2-MoSi2P4, which has CBM and VBM of −4.58 eV and −6.12 eV, respectively. Apparently, α2-MoSi2P4 exhibits type-II heterojunction alignment, as seen in Fig. 7(a). According to the formula listed in the ESI,† the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of α2-MoSi2P4/SIn2Te were obtained, as is seen in Fig. 7(b). We found that the maximum PCEs of the α2-MoSi2P4/SIn2Te is 20.3%, which is comparable to that of the highly efficient perovskite solar cells.58

Conclusions
In summary, we proposed two new α1-phase MoSi2Sb4 and WSi2Sb4 monolayers, and a family of one-layer α2-phase MSi2Z4 (M = Mo, W; Z = P, As, Sb) proven by the phonon calculations, cohesion energy, and AIMD simulations. Cohesion energy indicates that α2-phase structures are more stable than α1-phase structures, possessing high stability under ambient conditions due to the large O2 decomposition of the barrier. Remarkably, all of these monolayer MSi2Z4 are direct band gap semiconductors with fascinating optical absorption ranging from infrared to visible light at the HSE06 level. Moreover, most of the electrons and hole mobilities are beyond the 103 cm2 V−1 s−1, the largest is up to 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 for α2-WSi2Sb4. Interestingly, it is found that all of the hole mobilities are significantly higher than the electron mobilities. The SOC effect significantly reduced the effective mass of carriers, which will result in outstanding carrier mobility. These monolayer MSi2Z4 semiconductors will have potential applications in photoelectric devices due to their larger carrier mobilities. In addition, monolayer α2-MoSi2P4 is anticipated to have a desirable power conversion efficiency of 20.3%, suggesting that α2-MoSi2P4 is a prospective donor material for solar cells. Our finding shows that these monolayer MoSi2N4 semiconductors have dramatic potential applications in high-performance optoelectronic devices.
