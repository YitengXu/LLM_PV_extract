    , Accepted 27th July 2020First published on 28th July 2020AbstractWe report on solution-processed bismuth triiodide (BiI3) solar cells and their optoelectronic properties under different fabrication approaches. The BiI3 films crystallized by annealing under controlled solvent vapour conditions were found to have dominant effects on film morphology as well as the crystal growth. The photovoltaic device with BiI3 film followed by annealing under a chlorobenzene vapour atmosphere demonstrated the best power conversion efficiency of ∼1.01% with an open circuit voltage of 0.587 V in the inverted device configuration. This is attributed to the improvement in film quality comprising uniform morphology, increase in grain size, and hence mitigation of defect profile. Based on the material growth properties, and device analysis, our report provides insight into the correlation between film morphology, opto-physical properties, and defect profile in the BiI3 based device.
1. Introduction
Investigations on halide perovskite-based photovoltaic materials have rapidly emerged due to an exceptional rise in device performance of lead halide perovskite-based solar cells (Pb-HaPCs).1,2 However, there are some challenging issues regarding the toxicity of the Pb constituent3,4 and instability under ambient operating conditions (humidity, heat, and UV light).5 To address these hurdles, several Pb free photovoltaic absorbers, Sn,6–8 Ge,9 Bi,3,10,11 and Sb12-based halide semiconductor materials have been the centre of the research focus as alternative materials. It has been reported that both Pb2+ and BiI+3 are highly polarizable cations with large spin–orbit coupling effects. Note that Bi consists of stable outer-shell electronic configurations with 6s2 coupled with band dispersion and high dielectric constant resulting in high defect tolerance, stable oxidation state and better charge separation.13–15 Therefore, Bi-based semiconductors, bismuth chalcogenide and iodide related material derivatives having various structural dimensions, have been used for solar cell fabrication.16–19
Among various derivatives of Bi-based materials, bismuth triiodide (BiI3) belonging to the layered heavy metal-semiconductor family, is particularly attractive due to its promising optical and electronic properties.13 The binary compound BiI3 has a rhombohedral crystal structure (space group R) with a layered 2D structure. It consists of a hexagonal close packed lattice of iodine anions in which bismuth cations occupy 2/3 of the octahedral sites between every second layer.20 The single crystal and thin film of BiI3 have been previously explored for X-ray imaging,21 and gamma detection22 applications because of its high nuclear mass and wide bandgap. In recent studies, BiI3 has been reported as a potential photo absorber material.13,23–26 To date, there is a lack of experimental attempts towards the exploration of BiI3 film growth in various aspects. Seshadri and coworkers have firstly reported a BiI3 PV device with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼0.3% with a c-TiO2 ETL and an organic HTL by a solution approach.27 Using a similar device configuration, Panthani and co-workers demonstrated a BiI3-based device with a PCE of ∼1% with c-TiO2 and a vacuum deposited inorganic HTL.23 Adopting a similar fabrication approach, a BiI3 device in a TiO2 mesostructured architecture achieved a PCE of ∼0.5%.24 Similarly, Fermin and coworkers have uniquely prepared BiI3 film by gas phase iodination of solution processed Bi2S3 film.28 The device completed with c-TiO2 and an organic HTL demonstrated a record VOC of ∼0.607 V. The above-mentioned reports show much room for improvement in the BiI3-based device. Therefore, it is important to investigate BiI3 prepared by different approaches for photovoltaic (PV) applications.
In this work, we have studied the effect of solvent vapour annealing conditions on the crystallization of BiI3 film. The growth properties of the films and device characteristics were investigated. We found that BiI3 films with a larger grain size and uniform film morphology were grown by annealing under a solvent vapour atmosphere. The inverted device configuration with the BiI3 film grown by annealing under a mild CB vapour atmosphere demonstrated the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼1.01% in the inverted device configuration. This is mainly attributed to improving the film quality (morphology, opto-physical properties, and mitigation of defects in the BiI3 film). We have discussed the insight into the film growth and device characteristics to unravel the limitations of BiI3 for photovoltaic applications.
2. Results and discussion
We have deposited the BiI3 films by spin coating a BiI3 molecular precursor prepared in dimethylformamide (DMF) on glass substrates. The as-deposited films were annealed under different controlled ambient conditions as shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1). To understand the growth properties, the BiI3 films were prepared with and without antisolvent (AS), i.e. chlorobenzene dripping. Then these films were annealed under different ambient conditions by covering with a Petri dish. For our ease, we have denoted the thermal annealed BiI3 films as: without CB dripping (TA), with antisolvent CB dripping (CB-AS), and with CB dripping and annealing under a CB vapour atmosphere (CB-SVA) and DMF vapour atmosphere (DMF-SVA).
The SEM images (Fig. 1a–d and Fig. S2, ESI†) of the respective films show a noticeable effect on film morphology under various annealing conditions. The cross-sectional images of the corresponding films depict thickness in the range of ∼150–180 nm. Interestingly, the BiI3 films with TA and DMF-SVA (Fig. 1a and d) exhibit similar surface texture. This morphological similarity could be governed by an identical annealing ambient solvent. For the TA method, there is mild DMF vapour density as a consequence of the evaporation of DMF solvent from the as-deposited film during annealing, whereas the DMF vapour density is quite a bit higher for the DMF-SVA method. Therefore, the slight difference in morphology is associated with the difference in the DMF vapour atmosphere. The film morphology for TA and DMF-SVA is analogous to other reports.24,29 Unlike our previous report which has shown a better morphology of Cs3Bi2I9 film under DMF-SVA,10 the film with CB-SVA (Fig. 1c) results in compact and uniform morphology compared to other cases. We found that the annealing of BiI3 film under controlled ambient CB vapour atmosphere promotes homogeneous, compact, and pin hole film morphology. It has been reported that the antisolvent promotes direct crystallization of HaP film with homogeneous nucleation bypassing the formation of the crystalline intermediate, which leads to non-uniform morphology.30,31 Bruening et al. have documented the mechanism of antisolvent assisted annealing for the crystallization and film quality by in situ characterization.30 It should be noted that there is a fundamental difference in crystallization using antisolvent dripping and anti-solvent vapour atmosphere. These approaches could have a different mechanism for the crystallization of the perovskite and BiI3 film. In our work, it is presumed that the CB vapour atmosphere is helping to promote crystallization most probably due to the slight pseudo-dissolution of BiI3 under CB vapour density. This might assist in recrystallizing the BiI3 film producing improved morphology. Thus, it is speculated that the annealing in the CB vapour atmosphere further facilitates the homogeneous nucleation of the BiI3 film by prolonging the crystallization window. For DMF-SVA, the DMF vapour atmosphere may partially re-dissolve the BiI3 film and the crystalline intermediate forms. And thermal annealing induces re-crystallization with non-homogeneous morphology like the TA method. In this work, we observed that DMF vapour density is more sensitive so it is comparatively difficult to control the film morphology compared to the CB-SVA method. Our approach (CB-SVA) showed better film morphology compared to other reports by adopting DMF-SVA23 or a recycled vapour annealing approach.24 This suggests that the CB-SVA is very effective for tailoring the morphology of BiI3 film compared to DMF-SVA.

The XRD patterns (Fig. 1e) exhibit the crystal growth of BiI3 film annealed under different conditions. The BiI3 film prepared with TA grows with a dominant peak of (003) orientation along with (113) and (300) having identical crystal orientations to the BiI3 crystal of a rhombohedral structure. This is consistent with other reports.28,32 It is noticed that the BiI3 films under SVA facilitate crystal growth with dominant (113) orientation with multiple crystalline features. It is in excellent agreement with the reported XRD patterns of BiI3 film prepared by SVA.23 Reference XRD patterns (powder and calculated from VEST) (Fig. S3, ESI†) implicate that the BiI3 film coalesces to form larger grains with reorientation under controlled SVA. The intensified characteristic XRD peak for CB-SVA indicates better crystal quality.
To probe the secondary phases, the fabricated films were studied by measuring the Raman spectra (Fig. 1f). The Raman spectra exhibit characteristic peaks at 72, 91, 110, and 157 cm−1. These results are in agreement with the theoretical and experiment reports.28,33 The Raman peak at 112 cm−1 (Ag) is the main characteristic peak of BiI3 under a broad peak range with 91 cm−1 (Eg) mode.33 Another characteristic peak stemmed at 157 cm−1 could be assigned to a second-order. Furthermore, one can see the evolution of the optical Eg mode (91 cm−1) for CB-AS and SVA film. This is attributed to an increase in interlayer force constant. Note that in the polycrystalline film, the tensile and compressive stresses affect the broadening or shifting of the characteristic Raman peaks.33,34 This explains the characteristic features of the Raman spectra of BiI3 films studied in this work. This is supported by XRD results (Fig. 1e).

Fig. 2a displays the absorption spectra having identical characteristic features for all BiI3 films. The BiI3 film exhibits bandgap energy (Eg) ∼ 1.87 ± 0.05 eV (663 nm) along with a distinct exciton absorption peak at ∼2.48 eV and weak exciton absorption peak at ∼1.92 eV. The BiI3 film also possesses an additional band energy (Eg) ∼ 2.33 ± 0.05 eV. The normalized PL spectra (Fig. 2b) reveal the characteristic band edge emission peak centred at ∼1.84 eV ± 0.05 eV. This is in good agreement with the reports.13,23 Multiple reports documented that the PL characteristics of halide perovskite are influenced by the optoelectronic quality of film.13,35–37 In this work, the PL result for CB-SVA (Fig. S4a, ESI†) exhibits higher peak intensity with a narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM) compared to other films. These characteristic features are attributed to the film quality comprising the better morphology and mitigation of trap states. Furthermore, despite absorption spectra with an additional slope of the intercept at ∼2.33 eV and multiple excitonic peaks, no distinctive additional features in the PL spectra were noticed. This implicates that the BiI3 film does not have cascaded excitations suggesting either absence or very weak response anisotropic photoluminescence.38

We fabricated the devices in an inverted planar device architecture using the BiI3 film prepared by annealing under different conditions. So far, to our knowledge, there are no reports on an inverted planar device structure using BiI3 film. Fig. 3a displays the schematic of the energy band alignment. Note that we have used an ozone-treated PTAA layer as the hole transport layer. This is beneficial for passivating the non-wettable surface and tuning the HOMO or LUMO level.39,40 The estimation of the HOMO levels for PTAA and BiI3 are given in the ESI† (Fig. S5). Fig. 3b shows the typical cross-sectional image of the device (schematic of device configuration; Fig. S6a, ESI†). The J–V characteristics display negligible hysteresis (Fig. 3b) except for the device with the TA method. The figures of merit of the respective devices are summarized in Table 1 and ESI,† Fig. S7. The device with BiI3 processed with CB-SVA (steady-state JSC and PCE, Fig. S6c, ESI†) demonstrated the best device performance with PCE of ∼1.013% accompanied by enhanced VOC ∼ 0.587 V, and JSC ∼ 4.35 mA cm−2. The device with BiI3 CB-SVA demonstrated competitive device parameters compared to the other reports.23,24 Importantly, the VOC value of the champion device is comparable to the record VOC reported for the device with BiI3 prepared by iodination of Bi2S3.28 This improvement in device performance is primarily attributed to the better film morphology with larger grain size. It is reported that the compact film with larger grains possesses a low grain boundary density which reduces the recombination centers.41 Furthermore, Panthani and co-workers reported the device of PCE ∼ 1% with higher JSC (∼5 mA cm−2) and VOC < 300 mV comprising the BiI3 film processed by DMF-SVA in the planar regular device structure. But our device with BiI3 DMF-SVA demonstrated much lower device performance. This could be partially affected by different device configurations and consequences of morphology growth.42,43 Our results corroborate that the CB-SVA is very effective for enhancement in the device parameter compared to the DMF-SVA approach.

To understand the spectral response, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured. The champion device with BiI3 CB-SVA (Fig. 3d) demonstrates a much higher EQE response compared to other devices (Fig. S6b, ESI†). This is analogous to the JSC trend. Furthermore, the values of integrated JSC calculated from the EQE spectra are found to be ∼0.452, 2.18, 4.52, and 1.98 mA cm−2 for TA, CB-AS, CB-SVA, and DMF-SVA respectively. These results are in close agreement with the JSC from the J–V characteristics. The bandgaps estimated from differential EQE spectra (Fig. S4b, ESI†) show an excellent agreement with PL spectra. Furthermore, one can notice the suppression of the EQE response in the spectral range ∼410–650 nm. This can be correlated with the absorber layer and interface layer quality. It is speculated that the different surface texture of BiI3 film inherently contains different defect density and also induces interface defects leading to interface quality deterioration.
To get more insight into the surface chemistry, the BiI3 films were probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS core-level spectra (Fig. 4) (Fig. S8; survey spectrum and normalized characteristics spectra, ESI†) show the characteristic signals from the Bi-4f and I-3d electronic states. The XPS characteristic peaks I-3d display a similar feature whereas the shoulder peaks at ∼162 and 157 eV are detected in the core-level signal for Bi-4f. These peaks correspond to the metallic Bi0.11,44 Importantly, the metallic Bi0 is predominantly observed in the TA and DMF-SVA films whereas it is found to be comparatively suppressed in the CB-AS and CB-SVA films. Hence, it is presumed that the volatility of BiI3 results in iodine-deficient stoichiometry and a trace of metallic Bi0 state remains.11,44 This suggests that the controlled annealing condition lessens the formation of metallic Bi0 states on the BiI3 film surface. It should be noted that a trace of metallic Bi0 on the BiI3 film is detrimental for recombination centers and Fermi level pinning which is deleterious for the device parameters. Thus, a higher content of the trace metallic states results in poor performance of the device with the TA film compared to others. For CB-SVA conditions, since the characteristic peak of metallic Bi0 is significantly diminished, this supports the device results. Therefore, we believe that the existence of metallic Bi0 in the film is one of the reasons for the deterioration of device performance. These results suggest that the morphology, as well as the surface chemistry of the film, is very critical for the improvement of the device performance.
 Fig. 4  The XPS spectra of BiI3 films prepared under different conditions assigned for the core-level peak of (a) Bi-4f and (b) I-3d. The two steric signs at ∼162 and 157 eV stand for the metallic Bi0. 
Furthermore, to understand the carrier or defect profile, the capacitance spectra of the device were investigated. Capacitance analysis is a powerful technique to study the optoelectronic properties.45,46 It is rarely reported for this class of materials. We measured capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves under dark conditions and extracted the Mott–Schottky plot as described in our earlier reports.36,42Fig. 4a shows the Mott–Schottky plots of the respective devices. It exhibits a higher diffusion potential (VD) for CB-SVA. This value is consistent with the VOC trend for the device. It is attributed to the optoelectronic quality of the BiI3 film prepared under different conditions. The slanted broader line at the M–S plot implicates the p-type doping at the interfacial junction.

Fig. 5b displays the carrier profile estimated from C–V analysis. Note that the C–V profile gives charge as well as the defect density.47 Therefore, the change in the carrier profile primarily accounts for the change in defect density. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the wide U-shaped carrier profile can be assigned as bulk film quality and quality at the interface (red encircled regime). We found a higher carrier density for TA ∼ 2.83 × 1017 cm−3 in bulk (NBCV)/4.87 × 1018 cm−3 at the interface (NIFCV), whereas those values for other devices have a comparatively lower bulk and interface defect profile (CB-AS ∼ 5.83 × 1016 cm−3/3.82 × 1017 cm−3; CB-SVA ∼ 1.86 × 1016 cm−3/1.75 × 1017 cm−3; and DMF-SVA ∼5.74 × 1016 cm−3/6.27 × 1017 cm−3). The higher density profile in our device is contributed from the defect density induced in the BiI3 bulk layer due to different approaches of crystallization. Cho et al. have documented that BiI3 has low formation energy for intrinsic point defects with deep transition level which can act as nonradiative recombination centers.48 There could be the formation of Bi or iodine interstitial defects (Bii or Ii). This is parallel to the characteristics of XPS and PL spectra as discussed above. The higher carrier profile at the interface, which also accounts for the interfacial defects must stem from a deleterious interface with poor morphology of the BiI3 film with the carrier transport layer. Furthermore, the carrier density at the interface regime for the CB-SVA device (Fig. S9, ESI†) was estimated from the C–V spectra measured at different modulation frequencies in the geometrical capacitance regime. Interestingly, there is no significant change in the bulk density profile. But there is a stark difference in carrier profile at the interface. This suggests that the charges accumulated at the interface, which induce interface carrier profiles, are kinetically active under modulation frequency. Thus, from the capacitance analysis, it is substantiated that the device parameters of the BiI3 device are strongly influenced by the defect density associated with carrier profile, chemistry at the interfacial junction, and surface chemistry of the film. Defect passivation could be a potential approach for further enhancement in the device performance. These results point out much room for further improvement considering many aspects, such as film quality, structural tuning, interface engineering, and defect physics of a BiI3 based device.

Moreover, we also monitored the device stability stored in the air under ambient conditions. The device with BiI3 CB-SVA film exhibited promising stability as depicted in the supporting information (Fig. S6d, ESI†). It retained over 90% of its original PCE after 30 days. The XRD patterns of fresh and aged BiI3 films (Fig. S10, ESI†) indicate promising film stability under ambient air. These stability data implicate that the BiI3 device is more stable than the Pb and Sn-based HaP devices.49 But the Cs3Bi2I9 device demonstrated superior performance stability compared to the device with BiI3.10,44 To date, the device efficiency for Bi-based materials is much poor compared to Pb or Sn-based halide perovskite devices.1 Therefore, the Bi-based materials can be alternatives to Pb-halide based devices only if we can achieve competitive performance. Indeed, there is much room to play with the band alignment for favourable carrier kinetics and improvement in film quality to get a better BiI3 device performance.
3. Conclusions
This work presents the first report on the fabrication of solution-processed bismuth trihalide thin film solar cells in an inverted planar device architecture and their optoelectronic properties under different fabrication approaches. We have investigated the crystallized BiI3 films by thermal annealing under ambient nitrogen or controlled solvent vapour atmosphere (SVA) conditions. The film properties and device characteristics were analysed to get insight into the film quality and device performance. The inverted device structure; ITO/PTAA/BiI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag with BiI3 film processed by annealing under chlorobenzene vapour atmospheres demonstrated the best power conversion efficiency of ∼1.01% with an open circuit voltage of 0.587 V. This is attributed to the better film quality and passivation of recombination states in the device. The analysis of the capacitance spectra shows an increase in diffusion potential and the suppression of the defect profile (∼2.8 × 1017–1.9 × 1016 cm−3) in the BiI3 film processed with SVA and at the BiI3/carrier transport layer interface (also reduced by the same order). It corroborates the better optoelectronic quality and enhancement in the device characteristics. This work opens up multiple aspects for further optimization of the BiI3 material for photovoltaic and other optoelectronic applications.
Experimental section
Materials and preparation
All chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers as mentioned and unless otherwise specified, they were used as received. Bismuth iodide (BiI3; Sigma Aldrich, 99% purity) was purchased from the mentioned company. The BiI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 100 mg ml−1 in DMF at 60 °C for 7 hours in a N2-filled glovebox. The poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) (0.5 wt%) and [6,6]-Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) [Sigma Aldrich, 99% purity] solution (2 wt%) were dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB) at 50 °C for 7 hours. BCP solution was prepared by dissolving 3 mg ml−1 in anhydrous isopropanol for 12 hours. All the solutions were filtered using 0.45 μm syringe filters to avoid the risk of unwanted particles in the precursor solutions.
Device fabrication
Solar cell devices were fabricated on pre-cleaned patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (15 Ω square−1). A thin PTAA HTM layer (∼20 nm) was deposited onto the ITO substrate by spin coating at 5000 rpm–50 seconds followed by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Before 5 minutes of BiI3 film deposition, ITO/PTTA films were baked under ozone treatment for 10 seconds. For the fabrication of the BiI3 film thin, the precursor solution was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 20 s (ramping rate; 500 rpm s−1) and 3000 rpm for 30 s (chlorobenzene (100 μl) was dripped at the 30th second during spinning). Then the spin-coated films were crystallized under different ambient conditions by annealing at 120 °C for 15 min inside a glovebox; (a) thermal annealed (TA), (b) CB dripped film thermal annealed (CB-AS) by covering with a Petri dish. The CB-AS films were crystallized under solvent vapour annealing (SVA) putting about 5 μl of CB or DMF on the edge of the Petri dish; (c) CB solvent vapour annealed (CB-SVA), (d) DMF solvent vapour annealed (DMF-SVA) at 120 °C for 15 min inside the glovebox. A schematic of the film fabrication approach is given in ESI† (Fig. S1). For the ETL, PC61BM was spun on top of the BiI3 films at 700 rpm for 30 s coupled at 4000 rpm for 10 s annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then a thin electron selective layer (ESL), BCP layer, was dynamically deposited by spinning at 4000 rpm for 20 s and dried by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. The device structure was completed by depositing thermally evaporated Ag of 100 nm at a pressure <10−4 Pa. We sealed our devices of area ∼0.26 cm2 using UV-curable resins.
Device characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fabricated films were measured using a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer (CuKα radiation, λ = 1.54050 A). The morphology of the films and cross-sectional images were collected by a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 5 kV accelerating voltage (Hitachi, S-8000). The absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of various films were taken using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (7200, V-Jasco) and spectrofluorometer (FP8500, Jasco), respectively. HOMO levels of the transport layers were measured using a photoelectron spectrometer (Riken Keiki, AC-3). Raman spectra were measured from a micro Raman spectrometer (Horiba, green laser 532 nm). XPS spectra were obtained using a Versa Probe II (ULVAC-PHI, Japan). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1 under 1 sun with an AM 1.5G spectral filter (100 mW cm−2) coupled with an MPPT system (Systemhouse Sunrise Corp.). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a spectrometer (SM-250IQE, Bunkokeiki, Japan). Capacitance–frequency response (C–f) was obtained using an LCR meter (IM3536, Hioki), which probes from 20 Hz to 2 MHz at the AC voltage amplitude of 30 mV under dark conditions. Then, capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were carried out under conditions at 20 kHz frequency and 30 mV ac voltage under dark conditions.
