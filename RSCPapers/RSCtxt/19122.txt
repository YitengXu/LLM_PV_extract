1. Introduction
Lanthanide (Ln3+) activated upconversion (UC) materials, which are able to convert long-wavelength stimulation into short-wavelength emission, have been widely used in solid state lasers, flat displays, optical communications, and other photonic devices. In comparison with the multiphoton absorption or second harmonic generation that requires expensive ultra-short pulse lasers (e.g., a femtosecond pulse laser) to perform the excitation, Ln3+-doped UC materials generally take advantage of a more efficient energy transfer UC process, and thus can be excited using a low-cost continuous-wave (CW) near-infrared (NIR) diode laser (e.g., 808 nm or 980 nm laser). It is their unique electronic structures that enable the Ln3+ ions in crystals to effectively emit photons from high energy levels through successive photon absorption and energy transfer from their low-lying energy levels. Thanks to the pioneering work reported by Auzel and others in theoretical and experimental studies on UC within 4fN electronic structure, much of the spectroscopy and the mechanism involved in Ln3+-doped UC materials are well understood.1–9 With the rapid advances in nanotechnology and biotechnology, particularly the development of new methods for material synthesis, there has been growing interest in the controlled synthesis, optical properties and bioapplications of Ln3+-doped UC materials on the nanoscale. Nanocrystalline and nanostructured UC materials, typically with particle sizes smaller than 100 nm, may exhibit novel electronic, magnetic, optical or thermodynamic properties in comparison with their bulk counterparts. In particular, the core–shell nanostructure design may endow the UC nanoparticles (NPs) with novel optical properties or integration of other functional modalities to function as multimodal bioprobes for various biological applications.10–15
As compared to conventional downshifting luminescence (DSL) bioprobes like organic dyes and quantum dots (QDs), Ln3+-doped UCNPs possess superior physicochemical features, such as large anti-Stokes shifts, high resistance to photobleaching, low autofluorescence background, low toxicity and high penetration depth, and thus are regarded as a new generation of luminescent bioprobes. These functional UCNPs, although most of their bulk counterparts were well studied previously, have attracted reviving interest for their biomedical applications in areas as diverse as biodetection,16–20 bioimaging,21–32 drug delivery,33–46 photodynamic therapy (PDT),47–52 photothermal therapy (PTT),53–55 and disease theranostics.56–60 Despite extensive research, UCNPs still suffer from a low quantum yield (QY), which is currently the major bottleneck towards their commercialization. Therefore, pursuing a high QY for UC luminescence (UCL) becomes a goal of general concern. To realize this goal, a comprehensive survey of the photophysics of Ln3+-doped UCNPs is essential.
Recently, with the rapid development of Ln3+-doped UCNPs, many significant advances have been accomplished in the structure/morphology control, functionalization design, and optical performance optimization of these UC nano-bioprobes for versatile biomedical applications, as summarized in many recent reviews and book chapters.61–99 It should be noted that most of them merely reviewed the chemistry and potential applications of UCNPs in drug delivery, PDT, cellular or small animal imaging. To date, there have been little reviews focusing on the fundamental photophysics and bioassay applications of UC nano-bioprobes. Meanwhile, it is urgent to renew the knowledge about their optical properties because more new understanding or progress has been gained very recently. Rather than being exhaustive, this review is aimed at providing a comprehensive survey of the latest advances towards the developments in Ln3+-doped UCNPs as potential luminescent nano-bioprobes, which covers from their fundamental photophysics to biodetection, including electronic structures (energy levels and local site symmetry of emitters), excited-state dynamics, optical properties, and their promising applications for in vitro detection of biomolecules like tumor markers. This review will be organized as follows (Fig. 1). To begin with, we briefly introduce our customized lanthanide photophysics measurement platforms specially designed for UCL in Section 2. The fundamental photophysics of Ln3+-doped UCNPs, including the UC mechanism, electronic energy levels, local site symmetry, and excited-state dynamics of Ln3+ emitters as well as the effect of NP size on UCL, is reviewed in Section 3. In Section 4, we highlight the novel optical properties of UCNPs with emphases on their excitation, emission and luminescence lifetime manipulation and QY improvement especially for biomedical applications. Section 5 exemplifies several key applications of Ln3+-doped UC nanoprobes in homogeneous and heterogeneous bioassays. Finally, some future prospects and efforts towards this rapidly growing field are put forward.

2. Lanthanide photophysics measurement platform for upconversion luminescence
Spectroscopic data such as photoluminescence (PL) excitation and emission spectra, PL transients, and the pump-power dependence of PL intensities are essential to understanding the excitation mechanisms in UCNPs and improving their optical performance. Different from conventional DSL fluorophores that can be excited at UV or visible regions by using a xenon or a tungsten lamp, Ln3+-doped UCNPs usually require a high pump power density in the NIR to activate the UC process due to its nonlinear optical nature. As such, the optical measurement on UCNPs is normally carried out on a commercial fluorescence spectrometer with an external NIR laser as the excitation source. A CW NIR diode laser with a medium power density is sufficient to trigger UCL for Ln3+-doped UCNPs. The steady-state UC emission spectrum and UCL lifetime are most frequently recorded in routine optical characterization of UCNPs. In steady-state UCL measurement, the CW NIR diode laser is preferred to give a stable laser beam for the excitation; whereas in transient UCL measurement, a pulse laser is necessary to provide the time-dependent UCL signal within two pulses. Upon pulse excitation, time-resolved UC emission spectra can be obtained by setting appropriate delay time and gate time within the temporal domain of Ln3+ luminescence. Unlike the UC emission spectrum and PL lifetime that are commonly measured, the PL excitation spectrum of UCNPs is seldom recorded unless critically demanded, because it is often difficult and tedious to conduct such a measurement with the availability of tunable pulse lasers. It should be noted that most of these optical measurements are conducted for the ensemble of NPs, and single NP measurement is now accessible by combining the optical instruments with diverse electronic microscopes.100–104
Fundamental research on lanthanide spectroscopy in Ln3+-doped UCNPs, for example, the localized electronic structure, local site symmetry and excited-state dynamics of Ln3+ ions, is of vital significance for optimizing their optical performance and discovering novel optical properties, which relies on sophisticated optical measurement instruments and advanced spectroscopic methods. However, commercial and integrated fluorescence spectrometers could not satisfy the crucial demands for high-resolution and ultrafast spectroscopic measurements in view of their limited spectral resolution and expansibility. In this regard, we developed a low-temperature and high-resolution spectroscopic measurement system equipped with a variety of laser sources (Fig. 2a). Based on modular and open optical path design by integrating various excitation sources and making full use of the four windows of the optical cryostat, the functionality of the system is maximally expanded. The techniques such as multiple grating design, the microchannel-plate photomultiplier tube and time-correlated single photon counting are adopted in this spectroscopic measurement system, which greatly improve its detection sensitivity (10−18 W) and spectral resolution (0.0053 nm). Utilizing this system, the PL transients in the order of tens of picosecond can be detected, and the measurement is allowed to be performed at a cryogenic temperature as low as 3 K.

Evaluation of the optical performance of Ln3+-doped UCNPs is essential to the material optimization and application. However, currently it still lacks a criterion for the quantitative comparison of optical performance among different Ln3+-doped UCNPs. Due to the nonlinear nature of the UC process, UCNPs exhibit a power density dependent efficiency, which makes it difficult to compare the UC efficiency of the NPs measured under various conditions in the literature. To aim at providing such a standard for quantitative comparison of UC efficiency, we recently proposed the design of an absolute UC QY measurement system (Fig. 2b). With the simplified patented design (namely, single grating + single detector configuration), this system enables the measurement in a broad emission wavelength range from 300 nm to 1700 nm and allows for fast and sensitive measurement of UC QY with a detection limit down to 0.01%. Particularly, this system covers a wavelength range of 410–2400 nm in the UC excitation and an UCL lifetime range of 1 μs–100 ms. Based on the above instrument developments, we further constructed a state-of-the-art optical measurement platform for lanthanide photophysics (Fig. 2c). The platform shares various excitation sources (including femtosecond, picosecond and nanosecond pulse lasers, CW lasers, and xenon lamps) and integrates diverse modules of the spectrometer systems (including UV to NIR steady-state and transient fluorescence, high-resolution fluorescence, UV to mid-infrared (MIR) steady-state and phosphorescence lifetime, picosecond fluorescence lifetime, femtosecond-to-submillisecond transient absorption (TA), and high-throughput UCL microplate reader) and the cryogenic systems (4 K and 10 K), thus facilitating a comprehensive study on lanthanide photophysics and photochemistry properties of UCNPs in the time, frequency, and/or space domains with high resolution.
3. Electronic structures and excited-state dynamics
Ln3+ ions are excellent structural and spectroscopic probes, and their optical properties in diverse host materials are critically dependent on the localized electronic structures and excited-state dynamics. A comprehensive survey of the optics and photonics of Ln3+-activated UCNPs is fundamentally important for discovering novel optical properties and exploring their new applications. In this section, we will focus on the fundamental photophysics of Ln3+-doped UCNPs, including the UC mechanism, electronic energy levels, local site symmetry, and excited-state dynamics of Ln3+ ions involved in the UC process. The effect of particle size on UCL is also overviewed in this section.
3.1 Upconversion mechanism
The so-called UC refers to a nonlinear optical process that converts two or more low-energy pump photons into a higher-energy output photon. With the advent of inexpensive high power infrared diode lasers (e.g., 980 nm or 808 nm NIR laser), the UC emission of Ln3+ ions, especially from NIR to visible, has been extensively studied for its significant applications in the field of biosensing. Several different mechanisms have been recognized to be involved in the UC process either alone or in combination, including excited-state absorption (ESA), energy transfer UC (ETU), photon avalanche (PA), cooperative UC (CUC), and energy migration-mediated UC (EMU) (Fig. 3).1,69
 Fig. 3  Simplified energy level diagrams describing reported UC processes. ESA, ETU, PA, CUC, and EMU denote the excited-state absorption, energy transfer UC, photon avalanche, cooperative UC, and energy migration-mediated UC, respectively. 
In the case of ESA, excitation takes the form of successive absorption of pump photons by a single ion (Fig. 3a). ETU processes also utilize sequential absorption of two photons to populate the metastable level, but differing from ESA it is realized through energy transfer between two neighboring ions rather than successive absorption of two photons in a single ion (Fig. 3b). As a result, ETU can be distinguished from ESA by a rising edge in the initial stage of the PL decay curve, since the population of the luminescent level in the ETU process requires an energy transfer between two ions.105–107 Although the ESA process takes place in single Ln3+ ions (e.g., Er3+), the weak absorption induced by parity-forbidden intra-4f transitions within Ln3+ strongly suppresses its efficiency. By contrast, the ETU takes advantage of the larger absorption cross-section of a sensitizer (e.g., Yb3+), and thus is established as the most efficient UC process in practical applications.
The phenomenon of PA was first discovered by Chivian and co-workers in Pr3+-based infrared quantum counters.108 The PA UC features an unusual pump mechanism that requires a pump intensity above a certain threshold. In the PA process (Fig. 3c), the intermediate reservoir level is initially populated by nonresonant weak ground state absorption (GSA), followed by the resonant ESA or energy transfer from another excited ion (i.e., ETU) to populate the luminescent level from which UCL occurs. After this initial stage, an efficient cross relaxation (CR) takes place between the excited ion and another adjacent ground-state ion, resulting in the population of the reservoir level of two UC ions. Subsequently, the feedback looping of ESA (or ETU) and CR will exponentially increase the population of the reservoir and luminescent levels, thus producing strong UCL known as the PA UC.109,110 Although the PA UC is considered to be the most efficient due to the feedback looping of ESA (or ETU) and CR in UC processes, its disadvantages including weak GSA, high pump threshold and much longer rise time (even up to seconds) limit its commercial applications.
CUC is a three-body process, which involves the interaction of three ions and takes place with a much lower probability.111,112 In the CUC process (Fig. 3d), the luminescent level is populated through cooperative energy transfer from two adjacent ions, where the emitters have no intermediate energy level matchable to that of the donors. CUC usually happens as cooperative luminescence in Yb3+ singly-doped and as cooperative sensitization in Yb3+/Tb3+ or Yb3+/Eu3+ co-doped bulk materials,113,114 especially in those host matrices with Ln3+ heterovalent doping (e.g., CaF2), in which Ln3+ clusters are easily formed. So far, no solid evidence has been provided to support CUC luminescence in monodisperse UCNPs and their potential bioapplications have not yet been explored.
The EMU process was first proposed by Liu and Wang in NaGdF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@NaGdF4:Ln3+ (Ln = Tb, Eu, Dy, and Sm) core–shell nanostructures (Fig. 4a).115,116 In this novel UC process, Ln3+ ions designed for realizing EMU are classified into four types, i.e., sensitizers (type I), accumulators (type II), migrators (type III), and activators (type IV) (Fig. 3e). A sensitizer ion (Yb3+) is used to harvest pump photons and subsequently promote a neighboring accumulator ion (Tm3+) to the excited states. A migrator ion (Gd3+) extracts the excitation energy from high-lying energy levels of the accumulator, followed by random energy hopping through the migrator ion sublattice and trapping of the migrating energy by an activator ion (e.g., Tb3+, Eu3+, Dy3+, and Sm3+) (Fig. 4b). To control the energy exchange interaction between the accumulator and the activator, the sensitizer/accumulator and the activator are spatially confined in different layers of the core–shell structure, which is essential for eliminating deleterious CR. To generate an efficient EMU process, arrays of migrator ions through the core–shell interface are needed to bridge the energy transfer from the accumulator to the activator. A key feature of the EMU design is that the excitation energy collected by the sensitizer can be amassed in the accumulator by successive energy transfer while enabling one step energy transfer to the activator. Thus, stringent selection rules for activators (type IV ion) can be largely exempted, in parallel with the benefit of inherent high conversion efficiency of ETU for low energy excitation photons. The core–shell layout also allows a facile modulation in activator composition and concentration while minimizing luminescence quenching. As a result, multicolor UCL from activators without long-lived intermediate energy levels can be realized (Fig. 4c and d). This novel UC mechanism is an important extension of traditional UC processes including ESA, ETU, CUC, and PA, and thus may broaden the applications of Ln3+-doped UCNPs.

Besides these established UC mechanisms, other new types of UC processes have been proposed recently. For example, a mechanism termed as hetero-looping enhanced energy transfer (hetero-LEET) was suggested for UC in LaF3:Yb,Er NPs embedded in silica sol–gel thin films.117 The combination of resonant GSA and ETU with a CR feedback looping makes it potentially more efficient than any other established UC processes. Meanwhile, a thermal avalanche process that involves a thermally induced production of free carriers was revealed to account for the broadband white-light UC emissions from several rare earth oxides (e.g., Yb2O3).118 Although the actual mechanisms remain to be confirmed, these UC processes produce intense UCL, thus may find potentials in the fields of lighting, imaging and displays. More recently, the persistent luminescence nanophosphors were also demonstrated to function as UC materials.119 By utilizing CaS:Eu2+,Dy3+ NPs as energy reservoirs to store UV photon energy, red UC emission was observed upon NIR excitation.
3.2 Electronic energy levels and local site symmetry of lanthanide ions in UCNPs
The intricate optical properties of Ln3+ ions originate from the unique features of their electronic [Xe]4fN configurations (N = 0–14). They are characterized by three quantum numbers: S, L and J, within the framework of the Russel–Saunders spin–orbit coupling scheme.120–123 Since the energy levels of Ln3+ are well-defined due to the shielding of the 4f orbitals by the filled 5s25p6 subshells, Ln3+ ions show little sensitivity to the chemical environments into which they are inserted. As such, inner-shell 4f–4f transitions of Ln3+ in nanocrystals resemble the spectra of their free ions and are sharp and easily recognized. Upon placing a Ln3+ ion in a dielectric crystal, the energy levels split under the influence of the electric field produced by the crystalline environment. The f-electrons have very localized states that are conventionally described within the framework of crystal field (CF) theory.124 The electronic energy levels of Ln3+ and their CF parameters in a given host are usually obtained through the energy-level-fitting performed by parametrization of an effective operator Hamiltonian including free-ions and CF interactions. The commonly used effective operator Hamiltonian has been described by Crosswhite, Carnall and Wybourne et al.123–125 Once a set of experimental CF levels of Ln3+ occupying a single dopant site in a given host are identified from the high-resolution PL and/or absorption spectra, the energy-level-fitting can be performed by using the f-shell empirical program suite, which enables a complete diagonalization without truncation of the 4fN wave functions.70 The computing programs have been widely spread and used for decades in the community of lanthanide spectroscopy, which are available upon request from Prof. M. F. Reid.
It is well known that the optical properties of Ln3+ are very sensitive to their local coordination environment, and the emission intensity of Ln3+-doped NPs is critically dependent on the crystal structure and CF of the surroundings around Ln3+ emitters. A slight variation of local structure will bring about a significant change in the optical properties of Ln3+ ions doped into NPs.126 In general, host matrices with low site symmetries of dopants are more favorable for UCL than their higher symmetry counterparts, because low-symmetry hosts typically exert a CF containing more uneven components around the dopant ions. The uneven components enhance the electronic coupling between 4f energy levels and their higher electronic configuration and subsequently increase 4f–4f transition probabilities of the dopant ions.127 For example, hexagonal-phase NaYF4:Yb,Er bulk materials exhibit about one order of magnitude enhancement in UC efficiency relative to their cubic-phase counterparts that are higher in the site symmetries of Ln3+ dopants.128 Therefore, it is fundamentally significant to determine the localized electronic structures and the site symmetries of Ln3+ in given UC host matrices, which are essential for optimizing their optical performance as well as exploring novel host materials for efficient UCL.
On the nanoscale, structure disordering and surface defects are inevitable upon the introduction of Ln3+ ions into the lattices of inorganic NPs. Consequently, multiple sites of Ln3+ with different CF surroundings come into being.130–135 In view of their different CF surroundings, Ln3+ ions possessing multiple sites in NPs will display a distinct PL pattern and PL decay for each single site. These optical behaviors may facilitate the determination of local structures (or site symmetry) of Ln3+ ions embedded in NPs by means of high-resolution site-selective or time-resolved PL spectroscopy. Among all the Ln3+ ions, the Eu3+ ion is considered to be the most useful spectroscopic probe due to its non-degenerate emissive state of 5D0 and the ground state of 7F0.136–140 The 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+ is of an electric-dipole (ED) nature and hypersensitive to its local site symmetry, while the 5D0 → 7F1 transition is of a magnetic-dipole (MD) nature and insensitive to the site symmetry. Thereby, the intensity ratio of the 5D0 → 7F2 emission to the 5D0 → 7F1 emission of Eu3+ can provide site symmetry information.141,142 Moreover, according to the ED selection rule, the 5D0 → 7F0 transition of Eu3+ induced by CF J-mixing may emerge in the emission spectrum, which is only allowed for the following 10 site symmetries, Cs, C1, Cn and Cnv (n = 2, 3, 4, 6).137,143 Based on the above analysis as well as the Judd–Ofelt (JO) theory and the selection rules for ED and MD transitions, the allowed transition lines of 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) for Eu3+ ions at 32 crystallographic point groups are known.144–146 By comparing the CF splitting numbers of the 5D0 → 7FJ transitions with the theoretical predictions, multiple luminescent sites of Eu3+ within different CF surroundings can be easily identified in NPs.
Recently, by means of low-temperature and high-resolution PL spectroscopy that utilizes Eu3+ as the structural probe, we provided solid spectroscopic proof accounting for the universal breakdown of crystallographic site symmetry in Ln3+-doped disordered crystals, in which two or more cations statistically occupy a single lattice site (Fig. 5a and b).129 NaYF4 in the form of cubic (α) and hexagonal (β) phases was chosen as a model host, because the spectroscopic site symmetry of Ln3+ ions doped in NaYF4, particularly in β-NaYF4, has been the subject of much debate.147–150 The symmetry of spectroscopic sites for the Ln3+ dopants was observed to deviate from that of the crystallographic sites. Particularly, we found that the highest spectroscopic site symmetries of Eu3+ descended from crystallographic Oh to Cs (or C2) in α-NaYF4, and from crystallographic C3h to Cs in β-NaYF4 (Fig. 5c and d), which was further supported by the corresponding CF-level-fitting that yielded a very small standard deviation from the experiments. A similar breakdown of crystallographic site symmetry was also observed in other disordered crystals, such as α-KLaF4 and α-KGdF4.151,152 Meanwhile, a set of CF parameters and energy levels of Er3+ in both α- and β-NaYF4, which are critically important and have long been sought for designing highly luminescent NaYF4-based UC materials, were determined in our most recent work. The unambiguous spectroscopic revelation of local site symmetry breakdown in this family of disordered crystals is crucial to optimizing their optical performance for further applications. Similar work was conducted for Er3+ in anatase TiO2 semiconductor NPs (Fig. 6).107 A set of reliable CF parameters and energy levels of Er3+ assuming a site symmetry of C2v were identified through CF-level-fitting (Table 1). Both UCL and DSL were observed in Er3+ singly-doped or Yb/Er co-doped TiO2 NPs. The UCL intensity of Er3+ in Yb/Er co-doped NPs was found to be about five times higher than that of Er3+ singly-doped counterparts as a result of efficient Yb3+ sensitization and ETU evidenced by its distinct UCL dynamics. These findings provide deep insights into the fundamentals of Ln3+-doped semiconductor NPs like TiO2 that may function as the spectral convertor in solar cells and are currently of great interest. Table 1 compares the CF parameters and strengths of typical Ln3+ UC emitters in some host materials with different site symmetries. As shown in Table 1, a larger CF strength (S) generally indicates stronger CF interaction experienced by Ln3+ ions, and a low site symmetry occupied by Ln3+ ions in the host usually results in a large CF strength.

3.3 Excited-state dynamics of lanthanide ions involved in the upconversion process
The excited-state dynamics of Ln3+ in the UC process has been extensively investigated in bulk materials, most of which is also applicable to their nanoscale counterparts. In principle, the UC process can be quantitatively expressed by a set of rate equations describing the population density (Ni) of each 4fN manifold of Ln3+, taking into account all population and depopulation paths involved:153–156  where AEDij and AMDij are Einstein coefficients for ED and MD radiative transitions from manifold i to j; WNRi,i−1 is the nonradiative multiphonon relaxation rate from manifold i to i − 1; CETij,kl represents the microscopic parameter of the energy transfer involving the donor i → j and the acceptor k → l transitions. In this model, the interactions among more than two ions (e.g., cooperative sensitization) are not considered. The ED and MD transition rates and the energy transfer parameter CETij,kl can be calculated using the JO theory,141,142 while the nonradiative multiphonon relaxation rates can be treated with a modified energy gap law.157,158 The intensity of any given UC emission peak is proportional to the product of the population density of the emitting manifold and its radiative transition rates. Once the transition rates are determined, the UC characteristics, including spectral ratios, luminescent lifetimes and QYs, can be calculated directly by solving these differential equations. The critical energy transfer involved in the UC process can also be determined using this model. Although this model is usually simplified to include only the major transitions and nonradiative multiphonon relaxations, it remains challenging to give an accurate solution to these rate equations due to the difficulty in determining all the rate constants.
The rate equations for the UC process are often built for theoretical analysis or prediction, but there are only very few reports on the use of this approach in UCNPs mainly because of the complexity of the UC process on the nanoscale.155,156 Instead, most of the optical characteristics of UCNPs were determined experimentally. The investigation into the time-dependent PL behavior (or luminescence lifetime) of UC emissions is a good way to verify the validity of the proposed UC processes, and the rate constants could be extracted by fitting the measured time-dependent emission intensity with transient rate equations.168–170 In a typical ETU process, energy transfer from the sensitizers (e.g., Yb3+) will apparently lengthen the PL lifetimes of the activators (e.g., Er3+ and Tm3+), which are intrinsically orders of magnitude shorter than that of the sensitizers, due to slow population of the activator's excited state from the long-lived sensitizer's excited state.171 As a result, the apparent UCL lifetime of the activators strongly depends on those of the sensitizers, which differs markedly from its downshifting PL lifetime upon direct excitation to the high-lying states. It was predicted that the UCL lifetime of the activators for an n-photon UC process in bulk materials was 1/n of the sensitizer's lifetime.172,173 However, in the nano-systems, the nonradiative de-activation plays a dominant role due to the surface quenching effect, thus the UCL lifetime of the NPs is closely related to their particle size and surface structure and usually deviates from the theoretical prediction.174,175
Owing to its nonlinear optical feature, UC displays a power density dependent efficiency under CW laser excitation. The analysis of power dependence of UC emissions combined with the steady-state rate equations provides useful hints on UC kinetics. A theoretical model was proposed by Pollnau and Suyver et al.,3,4 which is now frequently used as evidence for UC processes in Ln3+-doped UCNPs. Briefly, the UC emission intensity (I) is proportional to n orders of the pump power density (P): I ∝ Pn. By plotting the emission intensity versus the pump power density in a double-logarithmic diagram, the order n of the UC process, i.e., the number of pump photons required to excite the emitting state, can be obtained by the slope of the power dependence curve (Fig. 7).4 This slope indicates the multi-photon nature of the UC emissions. It should be noted that the power density dependence of the UC emissions is valid only in the regime of low excitation power density and will turn more complicated for higher excitation power densities due to the competition between UC and linear decays in the individual excitation steps. The slope of the power dependence curve is known to decrease with increasing excitation power density. When the excitation intensity is high enough such that saturation of the intermediate energy state involved in the UC process occurs, the multiphoton UCL will appear with a slope of 1.

3.4 Size effect on UCL
Currently, there is growing interest in understanding how size-dependent confinement affects the excited-state dynamics of the doped Ln3+ ions including radiative and nonradiative lifetimes, energy transfer, and thermalization phenomena in nanomaterials. In general, the quantum confinement effect has little impact on the localized electronic states of Ln3+ ions doped in insulating NPs with an average size larger than 2–3 nm considering their rather small exciton Bohr radius. Instead, many of these effects can be interpreted as consequences of modified ion–phonon interactions in NPs when compared with their bulk counterparts.176–178 For instance, some novel spectroscopic properties such as anomalous thermalization and prolonged lifetimes have been discovered in Ln3+-doped DSL NPs.179–181 It is well known that the observed lifetime (τ) of a particular excited state (luminescent level) of Ln3+ ions is determined by the sum of the inverse of the radiative and nonradiative decay rates, which can be expressed as: τ−1 = WR + WNR, where WR and WNR are, respectively, the radiative and nonradiative relaxation rates from the excited state of interest. The radiative relaxation rate can be evaluated via the Einstein spontaneous emission coefficient, while the temperature-dependent nonradiative relaxation rate is mainly dependent on the magnitude of the energy gap between the luminescent state and its next low-lying states. As a rule of thumb, the smaller this energy gap is, the easier nonradiative de-activation processes take place.182–184
Compared with the downshifting Ln3+ emitters like Tb3+ and Eu3+, upconverting Ln3+ emitters (e.g., Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+) possess smaller energy gaps between the emitting and their next low-lying energy levels. Therefore, the nonradiative relaxation is ordinarily the dominant influential factor on the luminescence of Ln3+-doped UCNPs, in which a high proportion of superficial dopant ions are exposed in incomplete coordination environments.98 Luminescence of the superficial dopant ions is readily quenched by high energy oscillators arising from weakly bound surface impurities, ligands, or solvents due to the lack of effective protection by the host lattice.184 Excitation energy of the interior ions can also be transferred to the surface through energy migration and eventually dissipated nonradiatively. Besides, incomplete coordination environments result in a decrease of the CF strength around the superficial dopant ions and consequently lead to low UC efficiency. This phenomenon is known as the surface quenching effect.175 Smaller NPs typically possess a higher surface-to-volume ratio, and thus are more susceptible to surface quenching relative to the larger ones. It is a common sense that the UC emission of NPs is less efficient than that of their bulk counterparts.
In principle, the depletion of low-lying intermediate levels (e.g., 4I11/2 of Er3+ and 3H4 of Tm3+) by surface quenching will suppress the population in high-lying levels (e.g., 4S3/2 of Er3+ and 1G4 of Tm3+) via subsequent ESA or ETU processes. Therefore, the UC emissions in the UV/Vis region involving more excitation steps should be more susceptible to surface quenching than that in the NIR region involving less excitation steps. As a consequence, the UCL intensity ratios of the green band to the red band of Er3+ and the blue band to the NIR band of Tm3+ normally decrease with decreasing particle size, although exceptions for Er3+ were occasionally found in some host matrices.185–188 Direct evidence of a surface quenching effect on size-dependent luminescence of UCNPs was recently provided by Liu and Wang (Fig. 8).175 They found that the overall UCL intensity and the relative intensity ratio of the blue to NIR decreased constantly with the decreasing particle size in NaGdF4:Yb,Tm NPs (Fig. 8a). By contrast, the emission spectrum of the NPs after growing a thin NaGdF4 shell became essentially identical and closely resembled the UCL pattern of their bulk counterparts due to effective surface passivation (Fig. 8b). These results verify the prominent role of the surface quenching effect on UC emissions of Ln3+-doped NPs. Similar results were also found in NaScF4:Yb,Er and LiYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs in our recent work.48,189 The overall UCL intensities, UCL lifetimes and the UC QYs were determined to increase with increasing particle size, as a result of the reduced surface quenching effect. Such surface quenching deteriorates the UC efficiency of Ln3+ in small UCNPs, making it notoriously difficult to fabricate ultrasmall but highly emissive UCNPs that are highly desirable for in vivo bioimaging and in vitro biodetection.190–192 Fortunately, this difficulty can be overcome through the synthetic optimization or surface passivation by growing a homogeneous shell on the core NPs as will be discussed in Section 4.5.4.

4. Optical property designing
Due to the parity-forbidden intra-4f transitions within Ln3+ ions and their peculiar electronic structures, Ln3+-doped UCNPs possess superior optical characteristics, such as sharp emission peaks, large anti-Stokes shifts, long PL lifetimes, and high resistance to photobleaching and photoblinking. Along with the remarkable light penetration depth and the absence of autofluorescence in biological specimens under NIR excitation, these UCNPs are ideal for use as alternatives to conventional DSL bioprobes for various bioapplications. In this section, we will focus on the optical properties of Ln3+-doped UCNPs that are structurally designed for biological applications, including UC emission manipulation, UC excitation manipulation, UCL lifetime manipulation, UC QY, and UCL enhancement.
4.1 Upconversion emission manipulation
The emissions of Ln3+-doped UCNPs can be manipulated over a wide spectral region covering from UV to visible and NIR by the control of either emission peaks or their relative emission intensities through tuning the host–dopant combination, the dopant concentration, and the NP phase, size, morphology, crystallinity and surface ligands.62 Many efforts have been devoted to manipulating UC emissions to meet the requirements for the proposed applications. For in vivo bioimaging, NIR or red emissions are preferred due to their deep tissue penetration, while in UC-based photosensitizing nanoplatforms, UV or blue photons are preferred considering their ability to trigger photochemical reactions. Multicolor emissions are desired for multiplexed bioimaging and biodetection. Single-band emissions with a high chromatic purity are ideal candidates in multiplexed biosensing to avoid fluorescence cross talk between each channel signal.

4.1.1 Multicolor emission. 
It is highly desirable to fine-tune the color output of Ln3+-doped UCNPs for their applications in multicolor labeling and multiplexed biodetection.81,193,194 The strategies for tuning the color output of UCNPs primarily involve the control over dopant combinations and host lattices. The structure, size, morphology, crystallinity and surface ligands of UCNPs have a complex effect on UC emissions and are critically dependent on the synthesis.195–200 For example, Huang et al. reported the structure-induced red UC emissions in hexagonal-phase NaScF4:Yb,Er NPs, which were in stark contrast to the green emissions in NaYF4 counterparts.197 Wu et al. demonstrated that the UC multicolor output of NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs mainly resulted from the effect of NP crystallinity and could be easily tuned by changing reaction time and temperature.198,199 They also revealed that the UC emission colors of NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs were strongly affected by the coordinating ligands capped on the surface of NPs.200
Compared with the control over host lattices, the tuning of dopant combinations and concentrations is a more effective and general strategy to manipulate multicolor UC emissions.203–210 A systematic research study on this effect was conducted by Liu and Wang in Yb/Er and/or Yb/Tm co-doped NaYF4 NPs.201 By precise control over dopant combinations as well as their concentrations, multicolor UC emissions ranging from visible to NIR regions were obtained upon single-wavelength excitation at 980 nm (Fig. 9a). Zhang and co-workers designed sandwich-structured UCNPs with a NaYbF4 matrix sandwiched between two NaYF4 layers to fine-tune UC emission wavelengths. By doping different emitters (Er3+ and Tm3+) into each of the shells and adjusting their thickness, intense and tunable UC color output were observed (Fig. 9b).202 Very recently, Liu and co-workers reported UC multicolor tuning in a single NaYF4 microrod through end-on growth and dopant control (Fig. 9c).100 Despite these achievements, only a few Ln3+ ions (Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+ in most cases) are efficient activators in the conventional UC process, which limits the available spectral profile for manipulation and thus restricts the tunability of emission colors. A smart strategy to overcome this constraint is the utilization of EMU as described in Section 3.1. Through EMU, additional tunable UC emissions can be realized for DSL emitters (e.g., Tb3+, Eu3+, Dy3+, and Sm3+) without long-lived intermediate reservoir levels, which remarkably broaden the spectral regions of UCL.

Besides the above two basic strategies, other approaches such as the assembly of optical NPs with different chemical properties into one composite particle are also allowed for UC multicolor tuning. For example, by encapsulating NaYF4:Yb,Er and NaYF4:Yb,Tm NPs into polystyrene beads and changing the molar ratio between the particles, the emission colors can be tuned from green to blue.211 Organic dyes and QDs were also encapsulated with UCNPs into SiO2 NPs to tune their emission colors through either Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or the “inner-filter” effect (i.e., the irradiation/reabsorption process).212–216 However, the introduction of molecular fluorophores or QDs may raise new concerns over photostability and toxicity, and decrease the overall UCL intensity due to luminescence scattering or quenching.


4.1.2 Single-band emission. 
The abundant 4fN electronic energy levels of Ln3+ endow UCNPs with multiple transitions under single-wavelength excitation. However, the multiple transitions from different Ln3+ ions may cause signal interference in both in vivo bioimaging and in vitro biodetection. To avoid this disadvantage, single-band UCL with a high chromatic purity is an ideal choice.63 To this end, many efforts have been devoted to realizing single-band UCL by rational control over the spectral profiles of Ln3+. The commonly used method to realize single-band UCL is the control of energy transfer between Ln3+ ions by varying the dopant combinations or concentrations.155,156,217–221 For example, by virtue of the energy back transfer from the activators (Er3+ and Tm3+) to Yb3+, enhanced intensity ratios of the red-to-green and NIR-to-visible UCL were obtained, respectively, in Yb/Er and Yb/Tm co-doped NaYF4 UCNPs along with the increasing Yb3+ concentrations.219,220 Utilizing the energy transfer between Ho3+ and Ce3+, a high red-to-green ratio was achieved in NaYF4:Yb,Ho,Ce NPs.221 Similarly, based on the energy transfer between Er3+ and Tm3+, pure red UCL in NaYF4:Er,Tm NPs was observed upon 980 nm excitation.155,156
Another efficient approach to generate single-band UCL is the introduction of Mn2+ ions, which participate in the energy transfer and facilitate the excitation energy to accumulate in a single emitting level of the emitters (Fig. 10).217,222–224 One of the most representative examples of this approach was reported by Zhao and co-workers,223 who developed a facile strategy to manipulate green or red UC emissions in NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs by controlling the Mn2+ content. The doping of Mn2+ ions increased the red emissions of Er3+ at the expense of the green emissions, thus resulting in UC emission colors tunable from green to red. Meanwhile, Liu and co-workers developed another strategy to generate pure single-band UC emissions in the red and NIR spectral regions based on KMnF3 doped with Ln3+ (Yb/Er, Yb/Ho and Yb/Tm) (Fig. 10).222 It was found that the single-band feature in KMnF3 NPs was independent of the dopant concentration, pump power, and temperature, which differs markedly from that observed in multicolor UCNPs and thus makes them particularly attractive in deep-tissue bioimaging and multiplexed biodetection. Other host materials such as NaMnF3, MnF2, YOF, and Na3Zr(Hf)F7 exhibited also single-band UCL behavior when doping with Ln3+ ions, because of either the existence of Mn2+ or their peculiar crystal structures.224–227

All spectra were recorded under excitation of a 980 nm CW diode laser at a power density of 10 W cm−2. (Adapted with permission from ref. 222. Copyright 2011, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.) 
The other way to achieve single-band UCL is to tailor the emission spectra by introducing specific absorbers, quenchers, or other energy transfer donors. Photonic crystals and other non-lanthanide fluorophores such as organic dyes, QDs and Au NPs could be ideal candidates through the interaction with Ln3+ emitters in UCNPs to selectively filter the emission bands of UCNPs and produce single-band emissions.214,228,229


4.1.3 Broad-band emission. 
In comparison with the line-like emissions, broad-band emissions cover a wide spectral region with an FWHM typically larger than 50 nm, which may sometimes find their advantages in lighting, displays, solar cells, and biomedical applications. Broad-band UCL is able to provide an enhanced detection signal and therefore improved detection sensitivity relative to the line-like UCL at equivalent maximum emission intensities in biosensing considering the high optical flux through band-pass filters. It is also desirable for the NIR-triggered photosensitizing platform to maximize spectral overlaps between UCNPs and the photosensitizers, which would improve the sensitizing efficiency of the platform.
Since the Ln3+ luminescence is characterized by sharp emission peaks, broad-band UCL is not available in Ln3+-activated UCNPs. Nonetheless, it was reported that Yb3+/Mn2+ couples exhibited broad-band UCL in some bulk materials at cryogenic temperature, and the UC mechanism was determined to consist of a sequence of GSA/ESA steps assuming an exchange interaction within Yb3+/Mn2+ dimers.230–232 Broad-band UCL from Yb3+/Mn2+ co-doped UCNPs was first demonstrated by Zhang and co-workers in KZnF3:Yb,Mn NPs.233 By precise control of the dopant concentrations, intense yellow UCL at 585 nm (FWHM = ∼80 nm) with an UCL lifetime of ∼31 ms was observed at room temperature upon 980 nm excitation. Another paradigm of broad-band UCL was reported by Tanner and Song et al. in rare earth oxides assuming a thermal avalanche mechanism.118,234 It was demonstrated that free carriers were produced due to the thermal effect of the CW NIR diode laser irradiation, which resulted in intense white light UCL (FWHM = ∼300 nm) with a power efficiency approaching 10%.118 Other strategies such as FRET from Ln3+-doped UCNPs to other fluorophores may facilitate broad-band UCL.214 Broad-band UCL adds new spectral profiles to Ln3+-doped UCNPs and may explore new applications in biosensing, thus deserves extensive attention.


4.1.4 Polarized emission. 
Micropolarized spectroscopy that focuses on the single particle fluorescence has attracted great attention in the semiconductor system, not only for their fundamental scientific importance but also because of their potential applications, such as polarized light-emitting diodes (LEDs), microscopic information transportation, flat panel displays and photodetectors.235,236 In contrast to single emission peaks observed for the semiconductor system, Ln3+-doped UCNPs generally show a distinct set of sharp emission peaks arising from 4f–4f orbital electronic transitions. The multiple peak pattern should provide spectroscopic fingerprints, which are particularly useful for accurate interpretation in the event of overlapping emission spectra, thus possibly lending themselves to detailed theoretical analysis. Qiu and co-workers recently observed for the first time the polarized emissions from Ln3+-doped UCNPs in single β-NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanorods (Fig. 11a).237 Upon excitation with 980 nm linearly polarized laser, several unique UCL phenomena were discovered. For instance, sharp spectral-line splitting and singlet-to-triplet transitions that normally occur at cryogenic temperature were observed at room temperature (Fig. 11b). Meanwhile, the UCL intensity of the nanorod was found to discretely vary with the polarization of the excitation light, as visualized from the polar plots of the UCL intensity as a function of the emission polarization angle (Fig. 11c). It was revealed that the intra-ion transition properties and the local site symmetry of Ln3+ dominate the polarization anisotropy, which accounts for the polarized UC emissions. These findings reveal the great promise of Ln3+-doped UC single nanorods in polarized microscopic information transportation, thus broadening the applications of Ln3+-doped UCNPs.

4.2 Upconversion excitation manipulation
Despite the progress in emission color tuning, the excitation wavelength of Ln3+-doped UCNPs has been restricted to 980 nm (Yb3+: 2F7/2 → 2F5/2) for a long time, which is mainly ascribed to the available efficient sensitizer of Yb3+ and a commercially low-cost 980 nm CW diode laser. However, the 980 nm NIR excitation of Yb3+ has its own limitations, such as a low extinction coefficient of Yb3+, large water absorption and tissue overheating in biosystems.10 These concerns greatly motivate the manipulation of UC excitations beyond 980 nm, with the aim of achieving a high UCL output and facilitating their applications in bioimaging and biodetection.

4.2.1 Excitation wavelength tuning. 
The excitation wavelength of Ln3+-doped UCNPs can be optimized according to their absorption spectra in principle, but intense UCL occurs only upon excitation to the energy levels of Ln3+ dopants that have a large absorption coefficient and easy and efficient energy transfer. As a result, very limited excitation wavelengths are accessible to Ln3+-doped UCNPs to yield efficient UCL. One earlier attempt of excitation wavelength tuning for UCNPs was reported by He and co-workers, who employed the Yb3+ absorption at 915 nm instead of the commonly used 980 nm NIR light as an excitation source to minimize water absorption thereby suppressing the tissue heating effect.238 In another work, Prasad and co-workers employed the absorption of Er3+ at around 1490 nm to shift the UC excitation to a longer wavelength, by which intense UC emissions from Er3+ were observed.239
Furthermore, Yan and co-workers proposed another strategy to tune the excitation of UCNPs in NaGdF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4:Nd,Yb core–shell nanostructures (Fig. 12),10 in which Nd3+ ions were selected as sensitizers to harvest the 808 nm NIR light, and Yb3+ served as migrators to extract the excitation energy from Nd3+, followed by random energy hopping through the Yb3+ sublattice, trapping of the migrating energy by Er3+ activators and finally resulting in intense UC emissions. The spatial separation of Nd3+ and Er3+ in different layers of the core–shell structure is crucial to realizing efficient UCL through the inhibition of CR between them. It was demonstrated that the UC excitation efficiency of 808 nm was comparable to that of 980 nm due to the large absorption cross-section of Nd3+ at 808 nm (4I9/2 → 4F5/2). Meanwhile, as the water absorption cross-section at 808 nm is much smaller than that at 980 nm, the laser-induced tissue heating effect was minimized. Inspired by this work, many groups have been dedicated to similar studies of Nd3+-sensitized UCNPs,240–244 because these materials are very attractive for in vivo bioimaging in which long-duration and high power-density irradiation are required. It is also of great interest to employ these NPs as dual-modal UCL/DSL probes under single-wavelength excitation, which feature both NIR-to-visible and NIR-to-NIR conversions.244 It should be emphasized that, the commercially available inexpensive 808 nm NIR diode laser makes the Nd3+-sensitized UCNPs more appealing in practical applications.

4.2.2 Excitation band broadening. 
The motive to broaden the excitation band of Ln3+-doped UCNPs is to improve their UC efficiency or to effectively harvest NIR light from sunlight for applications in solar cells.245,246 One facile strategy to broaden UC excitation bands relies on the combination of different Ln3+ absorption. For example, by using the Ho3+ and Er3+ absorption at around 1160 nm (Ho3+: 5I8 → 5I6) and 1530 nm (Er3+: 4I15/2 → 4I13/2), an extended NIR wavelength excitable range from ∼1000 nm to 1600 nm for UC emissions was obtained in NaGdF4:Er@NaGdF4:Ho@NaGdF4 nanostructures.247 Such combinations of Ln3+ absorption are also allowed for multi-wavelength excitation to improve the UC efficiency by eliminating the energy mismatch between the neighboring excited ions that is inevitable under single-wavelength excitation.248
The intrinsic electronic structures of Ln3+ ions determine their low absorption coefficient and narrow absorption bands, and thus practical and effective broad-band excitation for Ln3+-doped UCNPs has to rely on other types of fluorophores through the antenna effect. This concept was first demonstrated by Hummelen and co-workers in cubic NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs via the sensitization from a NIR dye (Fig. 13).249 Because of its broad absorption band and large absorption cross-section, the commercially available cyanine dye IR-780 was selected as an antenna to broaden the excitation of UCNPs. Benefiting from the sensitizing process and increased absorptivity, the overall UC efficiency was enhanced by ∼3300 times and the excitation band was significantly broadened by over 3 folds (ranging from 720 to 1000 nm). Likewise, other fluorophores such as NIR QDs, Au NPs, or transition metal ions like Cr3+ may be exploited to broaden the excitation bands of Ln3+-doped UCNPs in an effort to enhance their UC efficiency.250 Nonetheless, it remains a challenge to make full use of such an antenna effect from other types of fluorophores for Ln3+-doped UCNPs in view of the rarity of suitable sensitizers.

4.2.3 Pulse excitation. 
Currently, the commercial CW diode laser is the most frequently used excitation source for Ln3+-doped UCNPs. However, CW excitation at safe power densities within ANSI standards gives rise to a low UC QY for UCNPs,251 which limits most of their potential bioapplications. One opportunity to break through the low power density restriction of UC emissions while suppressing thermal effects of the excitation light is employing pulse excitation.252 Due to the nonlinear power density dependence of UC emissions, pulse excitation would be highly beneficial. Since the excitation of UCNPs relies on intermediate states with long lifetimes, pulses shorter than a few microseconds do not improve the UC QY substantially. As such, a microsecond or millisecond pulse laser with a high peak power density and acceptable low average power would be a good choice for exciting UCNPs efficiently.253 The validity of pulse excitation for enhancing UC QY and for deep-tissue optical imaging has been demonstrated in NaYF4:Yb,Er and NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNPs.253,254 By using a square-wave excitation with a pulse width of 20 ms and a repetition rate of 2 Hz (power density 0.12 W cm−2), a signal gain of 8.7 was achieved in 42 nm β-NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYF4 core–shell UCNPs, which facilitated deep-tissue UCL imaging with a depth of 13 mm.254
Another profit of pulse excitation is the ability to achieve stimulated emission or lasing from UCNPs as reported by Yu and co-workers (Fig. 14).255 By using NaYbF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4 core–shell UCNPs as the gain medium, UC multicolor microcavity lasers were constructed under pulse excitation. It was shown that the optical gain of the NPs, which arises from the 2- and 3-photon UC processes, could be maximized via sequential pulse pumping. As a consequence, amplified spontaneous emission was observed from a Fabry–Perot cavity containing the NPs dispersed in cyclohexane solution. By coating a drop of silica resin containing the NPs onto an optical fiber, a microcavity with a bottle-like geometry was fabricated. It was demonstrated that the microcavity enabled lasing emission through the formation of whispering gallery modes. This work presented a substantial advance in the field of UCNPs-based lasers and thus may open up new avenues for the exploration of Ln3+-doped UCNPs in versatile UC lasing-based applications.

4.3 UCL lifetime manipulation
In comparison with the UC emission and excitation that are extensively studied and specially designed for the proposed applications, the utilization of the UCL lifetime of Ln3+-doped UCNPs is often neglected. In most cases, the UCL lifetime of Ln3+-doped UCNPs was merely characterized as supporting data to verify a proposed assumption or to elucidate an UC process. However, in view of the tunability in the time domain, the UCL lifetime may add a new dimension to manipulating Ln3+-doped UCNPs, which may promote their applications in biosensing and optical coding or encoding.

4.3.1 Time-resolved UCL. 
Since the f–f electronic transitions are Laporte–forbidden, the UCL of Ln3+ is usually characterized by a long PL lifetime. This optical feature makes the time-resolved PL (TRPL) detection technique readily feasible to minimize the interference of the undesired short-lived background fluorescence that occasionally originates from biological tissues, organic species, or other dopants under multiple-photon excitation. As compared to the conventional steady-state PL detection technique, the TRPL detection offers significantly improved signal-to-noise ratios and therefore a remarkably higher detection sensitivity.151,171 Meanwhile, because data sampling in the TRPL detection is completed in a few milliseconds, it can be repeated several thousand times during one minute, leading to a very high sensitivity within a few minutes.256
Another merit of time-resolved UCL is the ability to tune emission colors in the temporal domain. For instance, we achieved the UC emission color tuning through TRPL detection in NaGdF4:Yb,Tm@NaGdF4:Eu NPs (Fig. 15).15 By setting an appropriate delay time and gate time, the long-lived UC emissions of Eu3+ can be easily distinguished from that of Tm3+ in view of their different PL lifetimes. In short delay time (1–3 ms), the whole UC emission spectrum was dominated by the short-lived blue emissions of Tm3+ upon excitation at 976 nm, while the long-lived red emissions of Eu3+ were prominent when the delay time was longer than 3 ms, inducing a significant UC color change from blue to red as revealed by their corresponding CIE chromaticity coordinates. These time-resolved UC color outputs coupled with the downshifting mode and the good paramagnetic capability of the host cations (Gd3+) in such core–shell NPs may have versatile applications in multiplexed biosensing, offering remarkably higher detection sensitivity than the steady-state luminescent nano-bioprobes.

4.3.2 UCL lifetime multiplexing. 
Optical multiplexing plays an important role in applications such as optical data storage, document security, molecular probes and bead assays for personalized medicine.257–260 Conventional fluorescent color coding is limited by spectral overlap and background interference, thus restricting the number of distinguishable identities. Hence, it is highly demanded to find additional optical coding dimensions, which would be helpful when the new identities can be accurately decoded by a simple, rapid and low-cost device. Among the optional identities, fluorescence lifetime is a good choice.
Owing to its tunability in a wide microsecond-to-millisecond range, the PL lifetimes of Ln3+-doped UCNPs are ideal candidates for luminescent lifetime multiplexing, which would provide myriad coding identities when combining with the ample UC emission colors. This concept was first proposed by Jin and co-workers in NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNPs (Fig. 16).261 By varying the dopant concentrations, varied luminescent lifetimes in the microsecond region were explored to code individual nanocrystals (named “τ-dots”) based on their customized time-resolved confocal scanning system (Fig. 16a). A single color band could generate more than ten nanocrystal populations with distinct lifetimes ranging from 25.6 ms to 662.4 ms, which were easily decoded and were independent of both color and intensity. Such “τ-dots” potentially suit multichannel bioimaging, high-throughput cytometry quantification, high-density data storage, as well as security codes to combat counterfeiting (Fig. 16b–d). This demonstration extends the optical multiplexing capability by adding the temporal dimension of luminescent signals, opening up new opportunities in the life sciences, medicine and data security.
 Fig. 16  (a) Results for τ-dots-encoded populations of microspheres carrying unique lifetime identities. By adjusting the co-dopant concentration, NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNPs can generate eight lifetime populations of microspheres in the Tm blue-emission band under 980 nm excitation. The open spaces suggest more populations could be engineered. (b–d) Demonstration of lifetime-encoded document security and photonic data storage. Three overlapping patterns are printed with different Tm τ-dots. Intensity-based luminescence imaging only gives a complex picture (b), but time-resolved scanning separates the patterns based on the lifetime components of every pixel (c), so that genuine multiplexing information contained in the same overlapping space of the document can be decoded (d; pseudocolour is used to indicate the UCL lifetime for each pixel.)

4.4 Upconversion quantum yield
UC QY, defined as the ratio of the number of emitted UC photons to the number of absorbed photons, is an important indicator to evaluate the optical performance of various UC materials. It is a reliable tool to quantify the UC efficiencies of diverse Ln3+-doped UCNPs. Different from conventional DSL dyes and QDs, the QYs of UCNPs are dependent on the power density rather than constant considering the nonlinear nature of UC processes. Thus, the determination of the excitation power density is critical for QY measurements of UCNPs. For an n-photon UC process, the theoretically maximal UC QY is 100/n%; but practically, the measured UC QY is much lower than the theoretical one (typically within several percentages) in view of the energy losses in UC processes. Particularly, the QY of UC nanomaterials is normally orders of magnitude lower than their bulk counterparts due to the serious surface quenching effect on the nanoscale. To date, the low UC QY has been the major bottleneck of Ln3+-doped UCNPs towards their commercial bioapplications. Pursuing a high QY is a goal of general concern for the commercialization of UCNPs.
The QY measurement of UCNPs is usually carried out using an integrating-sphere based setup. The excitation power density and the number of absorbed photons should be carefully determined to guarantee a correct measurement, and the emission intensity should be converted to the number of photons at different wavelengths before calculating the QY.270 Then, the absolute UC QY can be calculated according to the following equation:262  where Lsample is the emission intensity of the sample, Ereference and Esample are the intensities of the excitation light in the presence of the reference sample and UCNPs, respectively. Since the first report on the measurement of absolute UC QYs for different sized NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs,262 there has been growing attention on the characterization of QYs for Ln3+-doped UCNPs (Table 2).263–269,271 For example, Li and co-workers synthesized sub-10 nm β-NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Tm NPs and achieved a QY of 0.47 ± 0.06% at 800 nm under 980 nm NIR excitation with a power density of 17.5 W cm−2.263 Prasad and co-workers realized the efficiency as high as ∼ 1.2 ± 0.1% in 85 nm LiYF4:Er NPs upon 1490 nm excitation at a power density of 150 W cm−2.239 By using a core–shell strategy, they subsequently attained a higher QY of ∼3.9 ± 0.3% in 38 nm NaYF4:Er@NaYF4 core–shell NPs with a lower excitation power density of 18 W cm−2.268 Recently, based on a customized absolute UC QY measurement system (Fig. 2b), we realized record-high UC QYs of 5.0% and 7.6% for Er3+ and Tm3+, respectively, under an excitation power density of 127 W cm−2, in LiLuF4:Yb,Er (or Yb,Tm) core–shell UCNPs synthesized by successive layer-by-layer shell growth.269 It should be noted that such high QYs were obtained under relatively high excitation power density, which is not permitted for in vivo bioapplications. Therefore, it is still highly desired to improve the QYs of UCNPs at lower excitation power density that is acceptable to biological tissues. This goal can be achieved through the optimization of the host materials or synthesis as presented in the following section.

4.5 UCL enhancement
The major bottleneck for the practical application of UCNPs lies in their low UC QYs. When compared with the conventional DSL bioprobes like organic dyes or QDs, Ln3+-doped UCNPs often suffer from low-to-medium brightness, which strongly restricts their commercial biomedical applications. Therefore, it is of fundamental significance to enhance the QY of UCNPs, in order to achieve a high UCL output and promote their commercial applications. A variety of methods have been proposed to improve UCL, which can be classified into the following categories: (i) selection of the host materials, (ii) optimization of the dopant concentrations, (iii) intentional cation incorporation, (iv) surface passivation, (v) plasmonic enhancement, and (vi) excitation manipulation. The manipulation of UC excitation, such as pulse excitation, multi-wavelength excitation and broadening the excitation band through the antenna effect, has been elaborated in Section 4.2.2 and 4.2.3, and thus will not be described in this section.

4.5.1 Selection of the host materials. 
The UC efficiency of Ln3+ is critically dependent on the structure, local site symmetry, CF strength, and phonon energy of the host materials. Careful selection of host materials is essential for achieving efficient UCL. Generally, desirable host materials should bear adequate transparency within the wavelength range of interest, low phonon energy, high optical damage threshold, and close lattice matches to Ln3+ dopants. In this regard, inorganic compounds of rare earth ions, alkaline earth ions, and a number of transition metal ions (e.g. Zr4+, Ti4+, and Mn2+) are suitable candidates for Ln3+ dopants to generate efficient UCL.98
Phonon energy of the host matrix has a profound effect on UC efficiency. Host materials with low phonon energies are favorable for Ln3+ doping to achieve intense UCL, as the low-energy phonons assure a low multiphonon relaxation rate and minimal nonradiative energy losses.182–184 Nevertheless, UC may sometimes require phonon assistance, and thus there is a balance between phonon properties and UC efficiency. Among various inorganic materials, fluorides, owing to their high chemical stability and suitably low phonon energies (<350 cm−1), are considered to be the most efficient host materials for Ln3+ doping to achieve desirable UCL for versatile applications. Particularly, β-NaYF4 has been recognized as the most efficient UC host materials for decades.92,203 Recently, some novel UC host materials such as β-NaLuF4 and tetragonal-phase LiLuF4 were found to yield a higher UCL output than β-NaYF4.269,272,273 Although the real UC efficiency of these materials needs to be confirmed, these studies greatly encourage researchers to find novel UC materials with QYs higher than β-NaYF4.
In addition to phonon energy, crystal structure of the host matrix plays an important role in UC efficiency. The local site symmetry and CF strength around Ln3+ dopants determine their intrinsic electronic transitions. In general, low-symmetry hosts are more favorable for UCL than those high-symmetry counterparts, since low-symmetry hosts typically exert a CF containing more uneven components around the dopant ions, which would increase 4f–4f transition probabilities of the emitters. Besides, the lattice constants and the localized structure of the host matrix that influence the energy transfer between Ln3+ dopants have a significant impact on UC efficiency. For instance, by preserving the excitation energy within the Yb3+ sublattice, an unusual four-photon violet UC emission from Er3+ was observed in KYb2F7:Er NPs, with an intensity that was more than 8 times higher than the previously reported value of NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs (Fig. 17).274

4.5.2 Optimization of the dopant concentrations. 
The potentially easiest way to improve UC QY is the optimization of the dopant concentrations within a single NP. The underlying mechanism for this approach involves the control over the distance-dependent energy transfer and CR as well as the concentration-dependent photon absorption. UCL through GSA/ESA processes in Er3+ or Tm3+ singly-doped NPs is often found to be too weak for bioapplications. To improve UC efficiency, Yb3+ ions with a larger absorption cross-section in the NIR spectral region are co-doped as sensitizers, as Yb3+ ions can effectively absorb NIR radiation and then transfer their energy to the activators through the ETU process.
Concentration quenching,275,276 a typical nonradiative process, should be avoided when optimizing the dopant concentrations. Concentration quenching often occurs to those Ln3+ activators with rich energy levels (e.g., Tm3+, Er3+, Nd3+, and Pr3+) via a CR process at high doping concentrations, resulting in nonradiative depopulation of the excited activator ions.277,278 As a result, the UC QY and lifetime decrease with the increasing dopant concentrations even though the contents of the UC emitters increase. To this end, the doping level of the activators is usually kept low (typically below 2 mol%) to minimize the loss of excitation energy by CR. Unlike the activators, the sensitizer Yb3+ ion has a simple energy level structure, and thus is barely affected by CR; but luminescence quenching induced by energy migration from Yb3+ to the impurities, defects or surface ligands increases with the Yb3+ concentration. To maximize the absorption, Yb3+ ions are often heavily doped. For example, the dopant concentrations of Er3+ and Yb3+ in NaYF4 UCNPs are optimized to be 2 mol% and 20 mol%, respectively.6,203 It is worthy of mentioning that in the hosts (e.g., CaF2) heterovalently doped with Ln3+, the optimized dopant concentration is usually lower than that in NaYF4, because ion clusters are easily formed in this kind of UCNPs, which might shorten the distance between Ln3+ ions and thus increase the energy losses through CR or energy transfer to defects.127
Concentration quenching may be alleviated in some hosts by optimizing the synthesis and enhancing the excitation power density. It was demonstrated that a monotonous increase of the Yb3+ concentration up to 100 mol% resulted in orders of magnitude enhancement of UCL in NaYF4:Yb,Tm, NaYF4:Yb,Tm@CaF2, and KLu2F7:Yb,Er NPs.219,264,274 Similarly, enormous UCL enhancement was found in LaF3:Yb,Er NPs via a hetero-LEET UC process by simultaneously increasing the Yb3+ and Er3+ concentrations to 50 mol% and 5 mol%, respectively. Recently, Jin and co-workers demonstrated that high excitation irradiance (2.5 × 106 W cm−2) was able to alleviate concentration quenching in UCL when combined with higher activator concentration (Fig. 18),101 which could be increased from 0.5 mol% to 8 mol% for Tm3+ in NaYF4. The UCL signals were significantly enhanced by up to a factor of 70. These unusual findings present a new approach for understanding and predicting the optical properties of Ln3+-based UC systems.

4.5.3 Intentional cation incorporation. 
Cation incorporation is an effective way to enhance UCL through either controlling the energy transfer process or tailoring the local site symmetry and CF surrounding of Ln3+ dopants.279 For instance, Yb3+ ions are usually co-doped as sensitizers to harvest the excitation energy and improve UCL through ETU. Gd3+ ions serve as energy migrators in EMU to facilitate UCL for those Ln3+ ions without intermediate energy levels matchable to Yb3+.115,116 Mn2+ ions enable excitation energy redistribution among different emitting levels of Er3+ and improve UC red emissions.222,223 Li+ and Na+ ions are excellent co-dopants or charge compensators to modify the CF surroundings of Ln3+ to improve their UCL.280–283
Cation incorporation also influences the synthesis of UCNPs, resulting in the change of the size, phase, and morphology of the NPs, which may in turn improve UC efficiency.284–286 For instance, Liu and Wang reported that Gd3+ doping influenced the growth process of NaYF4:Ln3+ NPs to give simultaneous control over the crystallographic phase, size and UCL properties.286 We recently found that the Na+ doping had a significant effect on the growth of ultrasmall CaF2:Ln3+ NPs, which significantly improved the crystallinity of the NPs as well as their DSL and UCL properties.126 By recording the steady-state PL spectra and PL transients of CaF2:Ce,Tb NPs, we showed solid spectroscopic evidence for the CF modification induced by Na+ doping (Fig. 19). It was observed that, the excitation band of Ce3+, the spectral-line splitting and the branching ratio of Tb3+, and their PL lifetimes varied significantly with the co-doped Na+ concentration, which unambiguously verified the modification of the CF environment around Ln3+ induced by Na+ co-doping. These DSL properties of Ln3+ are very sensitive to their local coordination environment, and thus may be exploited to monitor the impurity-induced local structure and CF modification for Ln3+-doped UCNPs.

4.5.4 Surface passivation. 
The main reason for the low UC QY of Ln3+-doped UCNPs lies in the deleterious surface quenching effect in colloidal dispersions deriving from their high surface-to-volume ratio. To overcome this shortcoming, surface passivation by growing a uniform shell with similar lattice constants is regarded as an effective way to improve UC QY of UCNPs. Several strategies have been explored for the fabrication of high-quality core–shell UCNPs, with either homogeneous or heterogeneous shells. An ideal shell coating is that all dopant ions are totally confined in the interior of the core particles and the shell is homogeneously grown around the core, thereby effectively suppressing the energy losses related to the crystal surface and eventually enhancing UCL.78
In homogeneous core–shell architectures, the shell has similar compositions to the core. The first demonstration of UCL enhancement using homogeneous core–shell architectures was reported by Chow and co-workers in β-NaYF4:Yb,Er(or Yb,Tm)@NaYF4 NPs.288 By growing an inert NaYF4 shell with a thickness of 1.5 nm on the 7.7 nm core, the UCL intensity of the resulting NPs was enhanced by factors of 7.4 and 29.6 for Er3+ and Tm3+, respectively. Since then, the concept of core–shell architectures has been established as the most general and effective strategy for UCL enhancement in UCNPs of varied hosts and Ln3+ compositions.289–293 Core–shell structures bearing completely different chemical compositions (namely, heterogeneous core–shell architectures), with matched lattice parameters, can also be constructed for UCL enhancement. To exemplify this, Yan and co-workers successfully realized a ∼300-fold enhancement of UCL intensity in 10–13 nm α-NaYF4:Yb,Er@CaF2 core–shell NPs relative to their parent core-only counterparts.294 Similarly, Prasad and co-workers coated the hetero-shell of CaF2 on α-NaYbF4:Tm NPs, which yielded a 35-fold enhancement of NIR-to-NIR UCL intensity.264
Apart from the inert shells without Ln3+ dopants, the active shells doped with Ln3+ activators or sensitizers are also designed in surface passivation for UCL enhancement. Capobianco and co-workers demonstrated that the growth of the NaGdF4:Yb active shell around the NaGdF4:Yb,Er core was more effective in UCL enhancement than the growth of an inert NaGdF4 shell, which was attributed to the increased Yb3+ absorption.295 Later the strategy of the active-core–active-shell architecture was extensively applied to other Ln3+-doped UCNPs for improving their UC efficiency, such as LaPO4:Er@LaPO4:Yb,296 BaGdF5:Yb,Er@BaGdF5:Yb,297 and BaF2:Ln3+@SrF2:Ln3+.298 Such an architecture may endow UCNPs with desired UC properties by incorporating Ln3+ dopants into different shell layers. The detrimental CR between Ln3+ dopants can be completely eliminated by the spatial confinement of Ln3+ ions in different layers. For instance, the design of NaGdF4:Yb,Tm@NaGdF4:Ln EMU NPs and the Nd3+-sensitized NaGdF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4:Nd,Yb UCNPs was based on the spatial separation of Ln3+ dopants in different layers of core–shell structures and the control over the energy transfer between the layers.
In most cases, the shell growth is not as ideal as expected and the dopant ions are often partially shielded by the shells, thus the UC efficiency is strongly dependent on the thickness or the number of shell monolayers. Zhang and co-workers established a linear link between the thickness of the NaGdF4 shell and the UCL intensity response of β-NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4 core–shell NPs (Fig. 20).287 Along with the homogeneous epitaxial shell growth layer-by-layer, surface defects of the cores were gradually passivated by the shells, which resulted in a significant enhancement in the overall UCL intensity and the increase in UCL lifetime. With the development of the synthesis and characterization of core–shell nanostructures, ideal core–shell UCNPs with dopant ions totally confined in the core can now be readily fabricated. For instance, van Veggel et al. developed a facile approach based on self-focusing by Ostwald ripening for the synthesis of core–shell UCNPs that are tunable both in thickness and compositions.299 Zhang et al. reported one-pot successive layer-by-layer synthesis of 16-monolayer core–shell UCNPs by injecting the shell precursors into the reacting solution without the lengthy multi-cycle batch operation necessitated in conventional seed-mediate heat-up synthesis.266 Similarly, we developed a unique strategy based on successive layer-by-layer injection of shell precursors for the synthesis of multi-shell LiLuF4:Ln3+@LiLuF4 UCNPs through a thermal decomposition route (Fig. 21).269 Compared to the method reported by Zhang et al., our strategy is much easier to handle without the need for the precipitation of core NPs and the tedious alterative injection of different shell precursors, thus providing a more convenient and general synthetic method for core–shell UCNPs. Due to the successive shell growth, the overall UCL intensity was remarkably enhanced. The absolute UC QYs of Er3+ and Tm3+ were, respectively, improved from 0.11% and 0.61% in the core-only NPs to 5.0% and 7.6% in 16-monolayer core–shell counterparts, upon 980 nm NIR laser excitation at a power density of 127 W cm−2. It is worthy of emphasizing that the UC QYs for Yb/Er (or Yb/Tm) co-doped LiLuF4 core–shell UCNPs with 16 monolayers are the highest among those Ln3+-doped UCNPs ever reported, upon NIR excitation at equivalent power density. Moreover, due to the effective shell protection, these multi-shell UCNPs exhibited very high resistance to luminescence quenching in colloidal dispersions. These results clearly demonstrate that the LiLuF4 crystal is a promising host material for UCL, and the strategy of successive surface passivation is effective for improving UC QY.

4.5.5 Plasmonic enhancement. 
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is the collective oscillation of electrons at the interface of metallic structures, and is produced by the electromagnetic interaction of the metals with lights of specific wavelengths within the skin depth of the metal surface.300,301 It is established that SPR of metallic structures can effectively enhance the fluorescence of the adjacent fluorophores like organic dyes and QDs.302,303 Similarly, SPR can also be used to enhance the UC efficiency of Ln3+-doped UCNPs. The coupling of UCNPs with SPR of noble metals is capable of amplifying the electromagnetic field acting on UCNPs, resulting in improved UC efficiency. Meanwhile, the electronic transitions of the Ln3+ ion and the energy transfer between ions may be affected by SPR under the resonant condition of UC emissions with SPR of noble metals, which also accounts for the improvement of UC efficiency.304–312 It should be noted that the SPR effect is sensitive to the distance between UCNPs and the metal surface, which may also cause unwanted luminescence quenching to UCNPs.
Generally, noble metals such as Au and Ag are employed to create a SPR enhancement effect on UCNPs. For instance, Duan et al. reported a factor of ∼2.6 enhancement of UCL intensity by SPR through the attachment of Au NPs onto NaYF4:Yb,Tm NPs.304 Kagan et al. designed a configuration in which close-packed monolayers of UCNPs were separated from a dense multilayer of metal NPs (Au or Ag) by a nanoscale Al2O3 spacer (Fig. 22a).305 UCL enhancements were found to be dependent on the thickness of Al2O3 spacers and the type of metal NPs with enhancements of up to 5.2-fold proximal to Au NPs and of up to 45-fold proximal to Ag NPs. They also fabricated a tunable plasmonic nanohole Au array that can accommodate only a single UCNP and be resonant at the excitation wavelength of NaYF4:Yb,Er (Fig. 22b).306 UCL enhancements of up to 35-fold were observed and attributed to the combined effects of enhancement in the excitation of sensitizers and an increase in the radiative decay rate of emitters, as corroborated by the measured decrease in the rise and decay times of the UCNPs in nanohole arrays. Recently, Nagpal et al. reported the resonant surface-plasmon-polariton waves enhanced UCL of NaYF4:Yb,Er on Au pyramid substrates (Fig. 22c).307 Their analysis indicated that surface-plasmon-polariton waves not only enhanced the electromagnetic field, but also increased the rate of resonant energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ by 6 folds. Despite the improvement observed, the underlying mechanism and the optimal design of such a plasmonic-enhanced UC system remain obscure and thus deserve an in-depth study.

Besides the above chemical routes, other approaches such as the external electric-field or the magnetic-field can also be applied to UCNPs for efficient UCL enhancement.313,314 For instance, by applying relatively low voltages to Yb/Er co-doped BaTiO3 thin films, an enhancement factor of ∼2.7 was observed for Er3+ UCL.314 Such an enhancement was revealed to originate from the increase in the radiative transition probabilities resulting from the lower symmetry of Er3+ sites which arises when an external electric-field is applied. These findings will aid further investigations of luminescence and the widespread applications of UC materials because they provide an additional degree of freedom in the design of luminescent materials and devices.

5. Luminescent biodetection
Sensitive and specific biodetection is essential for a variety of biomedical applications, including protein identification, DNA immunoassay and early cancer theranostics.315–317 Among diverse in vitro biodetection methods, luminescent bioassay is currently the primary analytical tool because of its convenient optical signal transduction, high sensitivity and fast response.318–322 Conventional luminescent bioprobes such as organic dyes, Ln3+-chelates and QDs might suffer from a series of disadvantages, such as high background noise and considerable photodamage to biological specimens associated with UV excitation, low photobleaching threshold, and potential long-term toxicity. In sharp contrast, Ln3+-doped UCNPs show little damage to biological specimens and are free of background autofluorescence upon excitation at NIR, where the biological samples have nearly no response. The large anti-Stokes shift of UCL under NIR excitation produces a neat emission spectrum without any interference from the excitation light. Moreover, the line-like multi-wavelengths and single-band emissions of UCNPs are highly desired for multiplexed bioassay to avoid any fluorescence cross talk. These features promise Ln3+-doped UCNPs as a new generation of luminescent bioprobes to circumvent the above limitations of traditional ones. In the past decade, many novel and efficient bioassay techniques based on Ln3+-doped UCNPs have been developed. According to their signal detection formats, two broad categories can be divided into: heterogeneous and homogeneous luminescent bioassays. In this section, we will provide a brief overview on the most recent advances in the development of Ln3+-doped nano-bioprobes and their in vitro detection of biomolecules with an emphasis on tumor markers, based on both homogeneous and heterogeneous UCL assays.
5.1 Heterogeneous assay
Heterogeneous assay commonly refers to a solid-phase assay and has the advantages of specific recognition and high binding affinity between target analytes and capture molecules anchored on a solid substrate carrying trace amounts of analyte for detection. The target analytes cover from small biomolecules to biomacromolecules including proteins and nucleic acids, and the capture molecules can be avidin, biotin, antigens, antibodies or aptamers etc., specific to the targeted analytes. Heterogeneous assays involve sandwich assay and competitive assay, and usually require multiple washing steps to separate the probe–analyte complexes from the unreacted or unbound species for subsequent detection. In a typical procedure for a heterogeneous sandwich assay based on Ln3+-doped UCNPs (Fig. 23a), the capture molecules are first immobilized on a solid substrate like a microtiter plate via incubation, and then conjugated with the target analyte followed by a thorough washing step to avoid any negative effects of other biological species in the sample. Thereafter, a solution containing UCNP-labelled capture molecules is added to mark the analyte. As such, the analyte is sandwiched between the capture molecule immobilized on the solid phase and the UCNP-labelled capture molecule. After washing off excess unbound UCNP-labelled capture molecules, the substrate is subjected to UCL detection. The concentration of the analyte can be quantified by directly measuring the optical signal of the UCNP label. For comparison, in a heterogeneous competitive assay, a solution containing UCNP-labelled analytes instead of UCNP-labelled capture molecules is added in the second step in order to compete with the free analyte to bind to the capture molecule anchored on the substrate, and therefore the optical signal varies inversely with the concentration of the free analyte (Fig. 23b).
 Fig. 23  Schematic illustration of typical heterogeneous UCL assays based on Ln3+-doped UC nanoprobes: (a) sandwich assay and (b) competitive assay. 
The first demonstration of UCL bioassay dated back in 1999.323 Since then, considerable efforts have been devoted to the use of UCNPs as sensitive bioprobes for diverse heterogeneous bioassays, including DNA microarrays, lateral-flow assays, microplate assays and magnetic-separation-assisted assays. Typical heterogeneous UCL bioassays based on Ln3+-doped UCNPs are summarized in Table 3.

One of the pioneering UCL bioassay applications based on Ln3+-doped UCL probes was documented in DNA microarrays in order to improve their hybridization efficiency and detection sensitivity. For instance, Tanke and co-workers used biotinylated Y2O2S:Yb,Er submicrons as UCL probes in DNA microarrays for the detection of nucleic acid hybrids.324 Due to the absence of autofluorescence under NIR excitation, the use of UC phosphors yielded a 4-fold lower limit of detection (LOD) than that using conventional DSL probe cyanin 5. Zhang and co-workers developed UC microbarcodes based on multicolor NaYF4:Yb,Ho,Tm UCNPs and combined them with organic dyes for multiplexed signaling and nuclei acid encoding.194 Because there was no optical cross talk between the UC optical code and any reporter dyes under different excitation conditions, the target labels can be selected in a wide emission range, and thus the code number was significantly increased. This kind of novel barcode material or bio-chips can be used for rapid and sensitive analysis of antigens and nucleic acids, which may have many potential applications in clinical, food and environmental detection.
Another bioassay platform for Ln3+-doped UCNPs is the lateral-flow assay, which is highly promising for point-of-care testing in community medical practice.336 The lateral-flow platform typically consists of a sample pad, a nitrocellulose membrane, and an absorbent pad (Fig. 24).326 The nitrocellulose membrane provides one or more test lines for target capture, depending on the number of analyte species. These test lines contain antibodies specific to the target analyte of interest that is adsorbed onto the membrane. If the analyte is present in the sample it will be captured and subsequently labelled by UCNPs at the test line. At least one additional control line captures any free UCNPs in order to confirm correct performance. Such UC lateral-flow bioassays have been extensively studied and established for the detection of several pathogenic microorganisms, nucleic acids, drugs of abuse, cytokines and antibodies, through either a sandwich assay or a competitive one.325–330,337–344 For example, Corstjens et al. applied UC phosphors to these test strips for the detection of human papilloma virus and achieved a 100-fold improved sensitivity as compared to established assays using Au NPs.338 Similarly, Lu et al. employed NaYF4:Yb,Er microcrystals in an UC lateral-flow assay to detect a hepatitis B surface antibody in standard positive sera and clinical sera, with distinctly higher sensitivities and reliability than those of conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).328 Multiplex detection based on UC lateral-flow assays was conducted by Niedbala et al. for simultaneous detection of amphetamine, methamphetamine, phencyclidine and opiates in saliva.345 An important step towards point-of-care and on-site monitoring using UC lateral-flow assays was accomplished by the development of a portable UC reader (called Uplink) for scanning lateral-flow strips that were integrated in a disposable plastic cassette (a self-contained immunoassay device).342,343

Magnetic separation and concentration are an effective way to amplify the optical signal and improve the detection sensitivity in heterogeneous UCL bioassays.331–333,346–348 Li and Wang proposed a sandwich-hybridization assay based on magnetic separation for the ultra-sensitive detection of DNA using sub-50 nm NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs (Fig. 25).348 In their study, a three-component sandwich assay was employed, in which capture DNA-modified Fe3O4 NPs were conjugated to probe DNA-modified NaYF4:Yb,Er NPs through the hybridization of the target DNA. When combined with magnetic techniques for facile separation, this method produced an LOD of ∼10 nM without polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Likewise, Wang and co-workers employed dual-color NaYF4:Yb,Er,Tm UCNPs for quantitative analysis of viral loads in clinical samples with enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16).332 Through magnetic bioseparation and concentration using Fe3O4 NPs, extremely high sensitivity and selectivity were achieved with LODs of 20 and 25 pM for EV-71 and CV-A16, respectively. Based on this method, they further developed simultaneous aptasensors for multiplex pathogenic bacteria detection by using aptamer-functionalized multicolor NaYF4:Ln3+ UCNPs as bioprobes and oligonucleotide-conjugated Fe3O4 NPs as magnetic separators.333 The proposed simultaneous detection shows great potential to specifically detect various types of pathogenic bacteria coexisting in the food matrices through the substitution of suitable aptamers. The combination of UCNPs and magnetic NPs greatly simplifies the operations in sample separation and purification that are often tedious in a typical heterogeneous assay, and thus provide a convenient approach for rapid and sensitive biodetection.

After incubation with target DNA, UCNPs and magnetic NPs form binary NP aggregates. The aggregates can be purified with magnetic separation and analyzed by UCL measurement.

Recently, a novel heterogeneous UCL bioassay approach (i.e., UCL microplate assay) has been developed in our lab, which makes use of the surface-functionalized Ln3+-doped UCNPs as bioprobes to detect trace amounts of analytes in fluid samples, ranging from model biomolecules like avidin to important tumor markers such as the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), α-fetoprotein (AFP), prostate-specific antigens (PSA) and the β subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG). The concentration of analytes is quantified by measuring the optical signals of UC nanoprobes bound to a 96-well microplate upon 980 nm laser excitation based on our customized UCL biodetection system equipped with a microplate reader (Fig. 26a). For instance, utilizing biotinylated NaScF4:Yb,Er UCNPs as bioprobes, we realized the detection of avidin protein in UCL microplate assays with an LOD of ∼180 pM (Fig. 26b).189 More recently, we developed a novel and highly emissive avidin-functionalized LiLuF4:Yb,Er@LiLuF4 core–shell UCNPs and explored them as sensitive UC nano-bioprobes for the detection of β-hCG.269 It was observed that the UCL intensity of the nanoprobes exhibited a linear dependence with the concentration of β-hCG at 0–310 ng mL−1. The LOD, defined as the concentration that corresponds to three times the standard deviation above the signal measured in the control experiment, was determined to be ∼3.8 ng mL−1, which is comparable to the β-hCG level in the serum of normal humans (Fig. 26c). These results reveal the great potential of the avidin-functionalized LiLuF4:Ln3+ UCNPs as a sensitive UC nano-bioprobe for the detection of diverse disease markers. More encouraging results were also obtained for the assay of uPAR, CEA and AFP with LODs ranging from 1 to 20 pM, which are much lower than those in conventional fluorescence immunoassays like ELISA. Further work is underway on the analysis of human fluid samples such as serum and saliva, in order to fulfil the requirements for clinical applications.

In these detection processes, an external 0–4 W adjustable CW 980 nm laser was used as the excitation source, and the Synergy 4 multi-mode microplate reader (BioTek) was used as the signal collector.

5.2 Homogeneous assay
Homogeneous assay is primarily based on the distance-dependent energy transfer (commonly FRET or LRET) from an energy donor to a nearby acceptor through long-range dipole–dipole interactions.322,349 Unlike heterogeneous assay that involves laborious separation or washing operations, homogeneous assay is a liquid-phase assay and can be performed directly in the test solution through a simple “mix-and-read” step, and thus is the most convenient bioassay method for fast detection in practical applications. The detection sensitivity in a homogeneous assay relies on the efficiency of the FRET process, which is critically dependent on the integral of spectral overlap between the emissions of the donor and the absorption of the acceptor as well as the distance between the donor and acceptor molecules.350 To maximize the FRET efficiency and achieve high detection sensitivity, the energy donors and acceptors in homogeneous FRET assays should be judiciously selected. Conventional DSL probes like Ln3+-chelates and QDs as energy donors in the FRET system always suffer from serious background autofluorescence from the samples or assay plates in the test solutions, thus offering a low signal-to-noise ratio and detection sensitivity. Moreover, the UV excitation of the energy donors is apt to simultaneously excite the energy acceptors, which could interfere with the FRET signal and give a fault detection result. Alternatively, Ln3+-doped UCNPs are free of such background noise and co-excitation of energy acceptors under NIR irradiation, providing an improved signal-to-noise ratio and high sensitivity for detection, and thus are regarded as ideal energy donors in homogeneous UC-FRET bioassays. The multi-wavelength emissions of UCNPs allow the acceptors to selectively quench one emission band and leave the others nearly constant, thus making ratiometric detection feasible. Ratiometric detection is independent of the excitation intensity, which endows the assay with high stability and flexibility.351
In a typical UC-FRET process, Ln3+-doped UCNPs are first excited upon NIR excitation and then nonradiatively transfer the excitation energy to the spectrally matchable acceptors in close proximity (normally within 10 nm or smaller), leading to the luminescence quenching of UCNPs or the emissions of the acceptors at a given wavelength, subject to the type of acceptor used. The acceptors are commonly those molecules or nanomaterials with a large absorption coefficient at the wavelength matchable to the peak emission from UCNPs, such as fluorescent proteins, organic dyes, QDs, Au NPs or nanorods, MnO2 nanosheets, aromatic polymer nanospheres, carbon NPs or nanotubes, graphenes, and graphene oxides.358,362,367–370 Since the first demonstration of Ln3+-doped UCNPs in homogeneous UC-FRET assays in 2005,371 a number of homogeneous UC-FRET bioassay methods have been developed, typically, sandwich assay and inhibition assay distinguished according to the assay format (Fig. 27). Typical homogeneous UC-FRET assays by employing Ln3+-doped UCNPs as energy donors are summarized in Table 4.

UC-FRET sandwich assays generally utilize a sandwich structure to detect an analyte in which UCNPs and the acceptors are both labelled with the capture molecules that can specifically recognize the analyte (Fig. 27a). The UCNPs and the acceptors are initially far apart from each other in the test solution due to the absence of specific recognition, thus no detectable FRET signal (namely, no UCL quenching of the donor or the lack of the acceptor fluorescence) can be resolved. Upon the addition of analyte, the UCNPs and the acceptors are brought into close proximity through specific binding between their surficial capture molecules and the analytes, which forms a FRET pair and gives rise to the binding-modulated signals. As a result, the analyte can be quantified by directly measuring the optical signals of the UCNPs or the luminescent ratios of the acceptors to the UCNPs. A series of homogeneous UC-FRET sandwich assays have been established by utilizing different donor–acceptor combinations.352–359,370,372–375 For instance, Li et al. reported an UC-FRET biosensor for the detection of avidin with sub-50 nm NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs as the donor and Au NPs as the acceptor, where an LOD as low as 0.5 nM for avidin was achieved under non-optimized conditions. Xu et al. developed a sandwich-type UC-FRET system comprising human IgG labelled NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs as the donor and rabbit anti-goat IgG labelled Au NPs as the acceptor, yielding a very low LOD of 0.88 μg mL−1 for goat anti-human IgG.352 In their proof-of-concept experiment, Li et al. developed a DNA sensor using streptavidin-functionalized NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs as the donor and reporter-DNA-TAMRA as the acceptor to detect trace amounts of target-DNA with a non-optimized LOD ranging from 10–60 nM (Fig. 28).370 For the detection of disease markers, Hao et al. established a sensitive UC-FRET biosensor based on the pair of oligonucleotide-modified BaGdF5:Yb,Er UCNPs and Au NPs for rapid detection of H7 hemagglutinin genes of avian influenza viruses with an LOD down to 7 pM.353 Simultaneous detection of multiple analytes by using multipeak emission profiles of UC particle donors was accomplished by Rantanen et al.374 In a dual-parameter sandwich-hybridization assay, two probe oligonucleotides with sequences complementary to a target sequence of β-actin and HLA-B27 were selectively conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546 (AF546) and Alexa Fluor 700 (AF700), respectively. The oligonucleotide-modified dye molecules and target oligonucleotides were then mixed with NaYF4:Yb,Er UC particles pre-modified with capture oligonucleotides. Upon formation of the sandwich complex through hybridization, the donor emissions at 540 and 653 nm were quenched by AF546 and AF700, respectively. By measuring the intensities of probe-specific emissions at 600 and 740 nm, two different target-oligonucleotide sequences can be detected simultaneously and quantified with a dynamic range of measurement from 0.35 to 5.4 nM.

The analyte concentration can be quantified by the emission intensity ratio of 580 nm to 540 nm. (Adapted with permission from ref. 370. Copyright 2008, American Chemical Society.) 
Besides sandwich-type assays, UC-FRET assays can also be performed in an inhibition way. In an UC-FRET inhibition bioassay (Fig. 27b), the luminescence of UC donors is initially quenched by the energy acceptors linked to the donors through FRET or the “inner-filter” effect. The linkage can be cleaved by the analyte, thus recovering the luminescence of UCNPs. As a result, the optical signal of the UC donors is proportional to the analyte concentration. This method is also known as “quenching/recovery” assay since the detected optical signal experience a quenching and recovery process. The initial quenching efficiency of the UCNPs is essential for the detection, which requires that the acceptors or quenchers possess a large extinction coefficient at the wavelength matchable to the emissions from UCNPs. In view of their unique electronic and thermal properties, manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets, carbon nanomaterials like carbon NPs (CNPs), and graphene oxide (GO) are superior quenchers for UC donors.360–364,366–369,376–381 For example, based on the nonradiative energy transfer from UCNPs to GO, Liu and co-workers constructed a novel biosensor for the detection of glucose in human serum samples without any background interference (Fig. 29a).362 They also designed another type of homogeneous biosensor for the detection of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2, a very important biomarker in blood) by employing CNPs as energy acceptors (Fig. 29b).378 A polypeptide chain containing a specific MMP-2 substrate domain and a π-electron-rich region was coupled with PEI-modified NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs to serve as energy donors. Upon NIR excitation, the UC-FRET process was initiated via the π–π stacking interaction between the probe peptide and CNPs, thereby leading to the quenching of emissions from UC donors. Upon addition of MMP-2, such an UC-FRET process was inhibited due to the cleavage of the substrate peptide between UCNPs and CNPs. As a consequence, the UC emissions of the donors were recovered, thus providing a straightforward approach to quantify MMP-2 in solution with an LOD as low as 10 pg mL−1. Recently, a novel UC-FRET inhibition assay was proposed for the rapid detection of glutathione in aqueous solutions and living cells based on the FRET pair of NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs and MnO2 nanosheets (Fig. 29c).367 MnO2 nanosheets coated on the surface of UCNPs served as efficient quenchers for UCL. The luminescence was then turned on by introducing glutathione that reduced MnO2 into Mn2+. These MnO2 nanosheets were further explored as a label-free nanoplatform for homogeneous UC-FRET detection of ochratoxin A (OTA) and cathepsin D (Cat D) by using different probes and following different sensing principles.376 So far, some novel devices (such as UC-μPAD) and signal amplification strategies have been developed for homogeneous UC-FRET assays, with the aim of providing a clinical point-of-care test and improving the detection sensitivity.359,377,381

Besides the detection of biomolecules, the UC-FRET platforms have been exploited to serve as sensitive sensors for the detection of temperature, pH and other molecules or ions in biological, food and environmental monitoring, as summarized in some recent reviews.316,351,382,383 It should be noted that we use the term FRET here following the common convention. In fact, in most cases, the energy transfer from UCNPs to the acceptors might be dominated by the irradiation/reabsorption process instead of the nonradiative process, since the Ln3+ emitters on or near the surface of UCNPs that contribute primarily to the distance-dependent FRET process might suffer from a serious surface quenching effect. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms in the so-called UC-FRET systems need an in-depth study, which is essential for improving their performance in biodetection. It is also highly desirable to develop ultrasmall and highly emissive UCNPs for the distance-dependent homogeneous UC-FRET assays in the future, in order to develop a rapid and ultrasensitive biodetection platform for practical applications.
6. Conclusions and perspectives
Ln3+-doped UCNPs, emerging as a new class of luminescent nanoprobes and as an alternative to conventional DSL molecular probes, have been rapidly developed and pushed forward with unprecedented speed towards diverse biomedical applications in recent years. These nano-bioprobes inherit the unique optical properties of Ln3+ ions such as long-lived luminescence, large anti-Stokes shifts, narrow emission bands, high resistance to photobleaching and photoblinking and low toxicity. By taking advantage of these distinct optical features of Ln3+ along with the remarkable light penetration depth and the absence of autofluorescence in biological specimens under NIR excitation, a series of efficient analytical methods, such as heterogeneous UCL and homogeneous UC-FRET assays, UCL bioimaging, NIR-triggered PDT, PTT, and targeted drug delivery techniques have been established based on these novel Ln3+-doped UC nanoprobes in the past decade.
Although it is still a long way to go for their commercialization, substantial progress has been made on Ln3+-doped UC nanoprobes from their fundamental chemistry and physics to bioapplications, including controlled synthesis, optical spectroscopy and diverse proof-of-concept bioapplications. Through manipulation over the emissions, excitations, and PL transients of these UC nanoprobes, many novel UC properties, such as multicolor emissions, single-band emissions, polarized emissions, stimulated emission and lasing, excitation wavelength tuning and broadening, and UCL lifetime multiplexing, have been explored very recently, which strikingly stimulate the application of UCNPs in life science. Currently, it is highly demanded to develop ultrasmall (sub 10 nm) biosensors with high UCL efficiency to fulfil the key requirements for in vitro biodetection, especially for UC-FRET bioassays. However, it remains a challenge to synthesize small-sized but highly emissive UC nanoprobes due to the deleterious surface quenching effects in colloidal dispersions. The UC-based bioassay for tumor markers is still in its infancy and most of the assay LODs and specificity do not satisfy clinical requirements. Therefore, one top priority in the future is to further improve the LOD for various tumor markers and directly analyze human fluid samples (including serum and saliva) to validate their detection accuracy, recovery and reliability for clinical diagnosis. Particularly, salivary diagnostics of tumor markers, which offers a more convenient sampling strategy than common serum-based bioassays to reduce the patient discomfort, is highly promising for versatile cancer screening and monitoring in community medical service. We believe that these goals can be achieved by enhancing the UCL efficiency of nano-bioprobes and optimizing current protocols involved in the nanoprobe synthesis or bioassays.
The major problem of current Ln3+-doped UCNPs lies in their low UC QYs, which inevitably limits their commercial bioapplications. Despite a high QY of 7.6% already achieved in some UCNPs, one should bear in mind that it was obtained upon high power density excitation that is not acceptable for some in vivo applications. Therefore, one urgent task in the future is to enhance the QY of UC nanoprobes at safe excitation power densities within ANSI standards. This relies on a comprehensive study on the optical properties of UCNPs, which offers a guide to the synthesis and optimization of the materials. In addition, a criterion on the characterization of the absolute UC QY is highly demanded in view of its excitation power density dependency and different laser sources used, in order to make quantitative comparison of the results from worldwide laboratories. This work is now in progress in our laboratory. We look forward to providing a standard protocol for the measurement of absolute UC QY of UCNPs and a criterion for the performance evaluation of various Ln3+-doped UCNPs with certain sizes, structures and morphologies.
On the other hand, some undesirable side-effects of Ln3+-doped UC nano-bioprobes should be eliminated prior to their use in biosensing. For instance, some key issues like biocompatibility, stability, and the long-term toxicity of nanoprobes need to be tackled for in vivo applications, although they may not be a big problem for in vitro biodetection. Moreover, due to the design inadequacy of commercial equipment like microplate readers for UC biodetection or confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) for UC bioimaging, there is a growing demand for the development of new-generation economic and sensitive detection or imaging systems for UCL. For example, UC-based equipment such as a UCL microplate bioassay system or UC-modified CLSM, UCL flow cytometry and time-gated orthogonal scanning automated microscopy (OSAM) systems that integrate with an internal or an external NIR (e.g., 980 nm or 808 nm) diode laser as the excitation source, thereby enabling heterogeneous and homogeneous UCL bioassays and UCL bioimaging for disease diagnosis and high throughput drug screening.
