    , Accepted 31st August 2020First published on 31st August 2020AbstractA pulsed Nd:YAG laser ablation of FeS in water and ethanol produces FeS-derived colloidal nanoparticles that absorb onto immersed porous ceramic substrates and create solar-light photocatalytic surfaces. The stability, size distribution and zeta potential of the nanoparticles were assessed by dynamic light scattering. Raman, UV-Vis and XP spectroscopy and electron microscopy reveal that the sol nanoparticles have their outmost layer composed of ferrous and ferric sulphates and those produced in water are made of high-pressure orthorhombic FeS, cubic magnetite Fe3O4 and tetragonal maghemite γ-Fe2O3, while those formed in ethanol contain hexagonal FeS and cubic magnetite Fe3O4. Both colloids absorb solar light and their adsorption to porous ceramic surfaces creates functionalized ceramic surfaces that induce methylene blue degradation by daylight. The laser induced process thus offers an easy and efficient way for the functionalization of porous surfaces by photocatalytic nanoparticles that avoids aggregation in the liquid phase. The formation of an orthorhombic high-pressure FeS phase stable under ambient conditions is the first example of high-pressure structures produced by laser ablation in liquid without the assistance of an electric field.
1. Introduction
Pulsed laser irradiation onto a solid target immersed in liquid leads to target ablation and immediate plasma formation. Laser ablation/irradiation in liquid (LAL) is somewhat different from laser ablation approaches operating in vacuum or gaseous environments, since the liquid medium not only controls the fabrication parameters but also greatly affects the morphology and microstructure of products.1 Depending upon the choice of target and its chemical affinity to the surrounding liquid, nanoparticles of noble metal, metal oxides, metal nitrides, carbides, hydroxides, alloys, polymer colloidal dispersions and even metastable phases can be synthesized.2–6
It is known that the shock wave generated by the expansion of laser-induced plasma under the confinement of liquid pushes plasma into a thermodynamic state with temperature, pressure and density that are higher than can be achieved by laser ablation in a vacuum.7 Despite this knowledge, little attention has been paid so far given the potential of LAL for the formation of metastable crystalline structures and particularly high-pressure structures. The literature shows only one study describing a high-pressure form of Ge obtained by electric-field assisted pulsed laser ablation in liquid.8 Early LAL studies have focused mainly on the preparation of nanoparticles via the laser ablation of (mainly noble) metal targets9–14 and on the modification of the nanoparticles size and morphology.15,16 LAL has been later developed into a simple and versatile technique producing various colloidal nanoparticles with novel properties and applications in biodetection,17–19 controllable luminescence,20–22 thin films for SERS detection23 and photocatalysis.24,25
One of the typical problems faced in the catalytic applications of transition metal nanoparticles is their instability towards aggregation and the formation of larger particles, which change the catalytic properties and can even lead to inactive materials. A strong effort is therefore devoted to achieving a higher colloidal stability by various stabilizers or by suitable liquid media.26 However, the stabilizers are usually not environmentally friendly and freely moveable nanocatalysts can enter biogeochemical cycles and become harmful to the environment and living organisms.
It is therefore a novel and attractive idea to make use of the adsorption of nanoparticles on rough surfaces to bind these nanoparticles before they agglomerate in the liquid phase. In this simple way, colloidal catalytic nanoparticles could adhere on a porous carrier, functionalize its surface and create a catalytic filter. For such purpose, the formation of a filter with open-cell porosity and sufficient mechanical and absorption properties allowing waste medium to flow through is desirable.
The occurrence of various organic pollutants in the ecosystem still remains a serious problem27 and a photocatalytic oxidation process using photocatalytic nanoparticles strongly anchored on porous carriers is considered an important part of a promising technology for the degradation of harmful organic pollutants into non-toxic products,28,29 although most photocatalysts can only be activated under UV-light irradiation because of their large band gap.30 It is therefore desirable to develop solar light driven photocatalysts and avoid the use of external sources of UV radiation.
A suitable candidate is photocatalytic ferrous sulfide having no toxicity, specific electron-transfer ability,31 good adsorption characteristic,32 band gap value,33 earth abundance and low cost.34,35 Apart from its photocatalytic properties,36 ferrous sulfide is attractive for solar cell application37 and exhibits interesting semiconducting,38 magnetic39 and biocatalytic40 properties and HER electrocatalytic activity.41 Some iron sulfides such as mackinawite (FeS) and pyrite (FeS2) are considered as excellent materials for mercury adsorption due to their high affinity towards Hg2+42 and for their ability to also capture other toxic elements, including Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb, and As.43–46 Iron sulfide (FeS) belongs to the family of polymorphic compounds and has a complex phase diagram including eight phases: pyrite (cubic-FeS2), marcasite (calcium chloride structure-FeS2), pyrrhotite-IT (Fe1−xS), pyrrhotite-4 M (Fe7S8), Fe9S10, greigite (cubic spinel-Fe3S4), troilite-2H (FeS) and mackinawite (Fe1−xS).47–50 Apart from stable pyrite (FeS2p) and pyrrhotite, other phases are metastable or unstable.
The pyrite phase of iron sulfide is suitable as an absorbing material for thin film solar cells because of its band gap (Eg = 0.95 eV) and high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1).51 The stoichiometric iron sulfide (FeS) has a troilite structure and antiferromagnetic properties at room temperature. Above 120 °C, troilite transforms to the NiAs-type structure composed of (Fe1−xS) and Fe7S8 pyrrhotites.52 Vacancies of Fe lead to the formation of many pyrrhotites (Fe1−xS) and create compositions with interesting magnetic and electric properties.53,54 Troilite transforms to an MnP-type structure at 3.4 GPa and to a monoclinic structure at 6.7 GPa as pressure increases at room temperature.55
Various different morphologies of iron sulfide including nanorods,56 whiskers57 or U shaped microslots58 have been observed. Iron sulfide nanoparticles have been obtained by high energy mechanical milling59 and by hydrothermal methods.60
Pulsed laser deposition of nanostructured FeS in a vacuum has been described in our recent studies,61,62 where reactive depositions on unheated substrate and the formation of metastable crystalline phases have been reported. To the best of our knowledge, no information about the laser ablation of iron sulfide in liquid except our recent brief conference contribution, has been published yet.63
Here we report on a laser ablatively prepared FeS-derived colloid dispersion and on the phase transformation of FeS taking place in the course of laser ablation in water and ethanol. We also reveal a solar light photocatalytic effect of the ablatively prepared FeS-derived nanoparticles and show that their adsorption onto porous ceramic substrates leads to solar light photocatalytic surfaces. The porous ceramic surfaces thus serve as efficient filters preventing nanoparticles to enter biogeochemical cycles and after the adsorption of sols they function as solar light photocatalytic bodies useful for the degradation of organic pollutants in an aquatic environment.
2. Experimental
2.1. Laser ablation of the FeS target and analyses of FeS-derived colloids
The XRD patterns of the FeS target were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance Eco instrument using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) with a silicon-strip linear LynxEye XE-T detector eliminating fluorescence and the Kβ line. The range of the measured 2 theta angle was 10–80° (0.02° step and 5 s time per step). Phase fraction was estimated by the reference intensity ratio method using standard values from the PDF database. The phase fraction of FeS crystallites is undervalued due to the preferential orientation of FeS in our layers.
A 3rd harmonic of the pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a base wavelength 1064 nm (model Q SMART 850, 355 nm, 20 ± 3 mJ per pulse, FWHM 23 ns, repetition rate 10 Hz,) was focused by a lens (f = 15 cm) on the spot area of 0.02 cm2 of the FeS target. A simple tubular Pyrex reactor (25 mL in volume) was furnished with a borosilicate glass window and filled with DEI water or ethanol. The irradiated FeS target (a lump of FeS, 99% Fe, Aldrich) was positioned vertically in the center of the reactor. The weight concentration of colloidal particles obtained by 2 h irradiation was around 0.01 wt% in ethanol and 0.004 wt% in water.
After the irradiation, the colloid was characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) for the size of particles and zeta potential. Parts of colloids were dipped on a Ta substrate and the solid residues formed after solvent evaporation were assessed for morphology (SEM, TEM, HRTEM), chemical composition (EDX, XPS) and phase composition (Raman and XP spectroscopy, electron diffraction, HRTEM).
The size distribution of the colloid particles and zeta potential were measured by Dynamic Light Scattering – Litesizer 500 (Anton Paar).
An SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope, Tescan Indusem, acceleration voltage 15 kV) with a mounted EDS was used for the analysis of particles residing on tantalum substrate after evaporation of the solvents of the colloids.
The Raman spectra were obtained using a DXR Raman microscope with a diode-pumped solid state laser emitting at 532 nm by using high resolution gratings working in the range of 50–1800 cm−1 and a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1 FWHM.
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (particle size and phase analysis) was carried out with a Transmission Electron Microscope JEM 2200FS (Shottky) from JEOL operated at 200 kV with CCD Gatan (Digital Micrograph software), in-column Omega energy filter for EFTEM and EELS analysis, STEM mode with a HAADF detector and EDS 80 mm2. SDD (Silicon Drift Detector) X-Max detector from Oxford on scraped samples that were subsequently dispersed in ethanol followed by the application of a drop of diluted suspension on a polymer/carbon coated Cu grid. The diffraction patterns were evaluated using the database JCPDS-2 and ProcessDiffraction software package.64
The samples for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were prepared by dispersing solid residues in acetone, dropping dispersion on a polished Cu substrate and evaporation of the solvent. XP spectra were obtained by Kratos Esca 3400 with a working pressure better than 5.0 × 10−7 Pa, using a polychromatic Mg X-ray source (Mg Kα, 1253.4 eV). Spectra were taken over Fe 2p, S 2p and O 1s valence bands. S 2p spectra were recorded between 150 and 174 eV to evaluate all possible chemical states of sulfur. Sulphur 2p3/2–2p1/2 bands were generally constrained to a 2:1 area ratio and doublet separation was set to 1.18 eV for all contributions. The overlapping spectral features were resolved into individual components using the damped non-linear least squares method and the lines of the Gaussian–Lorentzian shape. Prior to fitting, the Shirley background was subtracted. The samples were also sputtered with Ar+ ions at 1 kV with a current of 10 μA for 90 s to remove a superficial layer. The estimated sputtering rate of these parameters was about 7 nm min−1. The binding energies of the measured peaks were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.
The UV-vis spectra of the colloids were measured by using a DU 730 Beckman Coulter spectrometer. This instrument was also used to assess the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) by FeS-derived colloidal particles dispersed in water and ethanol, which was conducted under the following conditions: 2.5 ml of 0.05 mM MB solution and 1 ml of freshly prepared aqueous/ethanol colloid was mixed and exposed to daylight (without an external light source) for 180 minutes. The intensity of the light was Φ ∼ 800 lm. The depletion of MB was measured every 20 minutes.
The band gap energy of the FeS-derived colloids was assessed as follows: the ablatively obtained nanoparticles were dispersed in ethanol and absorption spectra were recorded using ethanol as blank. The absorption coefficient for direct transition is given by the Tauc's equation: α(hν) = A(hν − Eg)n where hν = photon energy, α = absorption coefficient (α = 4πk/λ; k is the absorption index or absorbance, λ is the wavelength in nm), Eg is the band gap energy and A = constant, and n = 1/2 for the allowed direct band. The exponent ‘n’ depends on the type of transition and it may have values 1/2, 2, 3/2 and 3 corresponding to the given order to the allowed direct, allowed indirect, forbidden direct and forbidden indirect transitions.
2.2. Porous carriers
Two types of porous carriers selected to test the adsorption ability of prepared colloidal FeS-derived particles are a commercial product based on sintered alumina purchased at LANIK s.r.o.65 (A-carrier) and the laboratory prepared filter based on metakaolin, chamotte powder and fumed silica whose fabrication description follows (B-carrier).

2.2.1. B-carrier fabrication. 
Metakaolin (MK) and chamotte powder (CP) were supplied by České lupkové závody, a.s. – Czech Republic.66,67 Amorphous fumed silica (FS) was purchased from OCI Comp Ltd – South Korea.68 The chemical composition of these raw materials is given in Table 1.

Aqueous alkali potassium silicate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a liquid part with silica modulus Ms 1.6 (molar ratio SiO2/Me2O). The quantitative analysis using acid–base titration was applied to determine the weight fractions of SiO2 (17.57), K2O (17.10) and H2O (65.33).
A suitable formulation for the production of the porous carrier with open porosity was based on trial tests and adapted on a procedure published elsewhere.69 The aluminosilicate slurry was prepared as a three-component system using alkaline potassium silicate solution, metakaolin and fumed silica. The composition was formulated using SiO2/Al2O3 = 9, SiO2/K2O = 3.5, Al2O3/K2O = 0.4, H2O/K2O = 20 molar ratios and the paste was prepared by mechanical stirring for 20 min at 500 rpm. Chamotte powder was added to the geopolymer slurry as a particulate filler in an amount of 1100 wt% with respect to solid components to prevent the presence of incipient cracks due to extensive stress generated during heat treatment. After the addition of the ceramic filler, the mixture was stirred for an additional 20 min. Polyurethane (PU) cube-shaped samples with an average porosity of 7–15 pores-per-inch (PPI) and bulk density of 19–22 kg m−3, were used as a polymeric template. PU sponge was immersed in the geopolymer mixture and taken out several times. After that, it was dried in laboratory conditions (23 °C, 35%) for 1 day before heat treatment. Silica-modified geopolymer foam was sintered in a kanthal furnace for a further 3 h (soak time) at 1300 °C with a ramp of 1 °C min−1 up to 600 °C followed by 3 °C min−1 up to the target temperature. The fabrication and characterization route is schematically presented in Fig. 1.

2.2.2. A- and B-carrier characterization. 
A wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) spectrometer Supermini200 (Rigaku) was used to obtain the chemical composition of input raw material and a laser particle size analyzer Partica LA-960 (Horiba) was used to determine the mean particle size of the powders.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted using an X'Pert pro automatic X-ray diffractometer (Philips). This device uses a copper X-ray tube and an ultra-fast semiconductor detector PIXcel with high resolution ability. For all measurements the symmetrical Bragg–Brentano (θ–2θ) geometry was used. The 2θ measuring range was set from 10° to 90°. The measurements were performed on powder samples in cuvettes ensuring an X-ray irradiation area of 10 × 10 mm.
Scanning electron microscopy images were obtained with a SEM Tescan Indusem (Tescan) microscope at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV, equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) detector.
Compressive strength values were determined on cube-shape samples (20 × 20×20 mm) with a LabTest 6.100 testing machine (LABORTECH) at a loading rate of 0.25 mm min−1. Standard deviations were calculated for the results of ten measurements per type.
Porous carrier samples were scanned by an Xradia MicroXCT 400 analyzer. It utilizes a low voltage X-ray source (20–90 kV) and interchangeable high resolution detectors. All the samples were initially scanned at a source voltage of 50 kV, source power of 8 W, pixel size of 16.67 μm, detector resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels (binning 2), rotation angle of 360°, number of images of 1500, exposure time of each image 5 s, and an overall scanning time of 3.25 h. To obtain microporosity data, more detailed scans had to be performed on smaller pieces that were cut out of the large samples. These scanning parameters were source voltage 50 kV, source power 5 W, pixel size 1.12 μm, detector resolution 2016 × 2016 pixels (binning 1), rotation angle 360°, number of images 1800, exposure time of each image: 6 s, and overall scanning time 5 h.

2.3. Adsorption of FeS-derived colloids and carrier photocatalysis
The A and B carriers were immersed for 24 h in water and ethanol colloids prepared after a 2 h laser ablation of the FeS target in water and ethanol and then removed from these colloids and slowly dried at room temperature. The level of covering was measured by EDS (acceleration voltage 15 kV). Thereafter, the coated carriers were immersed in 50 ml of 0.05 mM MB solution exposed to daylight (without an external light source) for 8 hours. The intensity of the daylight was Φ ∼ 800 lm. The MB degradation of MB was measured every 20 minutes using a UV-vis spectrometer (DU 730 Beckman Coulter spectrometer).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of colloidal particles
The highly focused pulsed irradiation of the FeS target in water and ethanol induces a slightly brownish coloration of both liquids and allows laser ablative formation of FeS-derived colloidal particles.

3.1.1. DLS evaluation of nanoparticle agglomeration. 
The different behavior of the sol particles in water and ethanol is demonstrated in Fig. 2. In water, the size of the colloidal nanoparticles measured immediately after a 2 h laser irradiation is about 180 nm and after the next 1 hour these entities decrease in number and evolve a peak corresponding to particles 1000 nm large. The next measurement after 24 hours confirmed a continuing aggregation, since the intensity of the peak of 180 nm large nanoparticles decreased and a new peak of approximately 5000 nm sized aggregates was observed. The zeta potential of the colloid measured immediately after laser irradiation and after the next 1 hour and 24 hours varies around 9 mV, which suggests the incipient instability of the colloid and is in agreement with agglomeration. Conversely, nanosols produced in ethanol exhibit great stability and consist of 215 nm-sized nanoparticles that do not change their size for an entire day. Their stability is also confirmed by zeta potential −41 mV.

3.1.2. Elemental composition of particles. 
The SEM of the solid residues remaining after evaporation of water or ethanol from the colloids revealed that the morphology of FeS-derived particles obtained in water and ethanol is different. Round shaped about tens of μm large and smaller spherical and needle-like features are observed for the solid phase obtained from the water colloid (Fig. 3a), whereas sheet-like particles with random orientation and size spanning from units of μm to tens of nm are observed for the residue obtained from the ethanol colloid (Fig. 3b). We note that similar sheet-like and flower-like FeS morphologies have been obtained via poly(vinylalcohol)-assisted precipitation,70 thermal decomposition of the organometallic precursor in oleylamine,71 ultrasonic spray pyrolysis-assisted deposition of mackinawite72 and from a dithiocarboxylate precursor complex.73
 Fig. 3  SEM images of FeS-derived particles obtained after evaporation of water (a) and ethanol (b). 
The elemental mapping of these solid residues (Fig. 4) shows regions enriched by Fe and sulfur and the EDS-derived at% Fe/S ratios measured for several tens of μm larger areas scatter between 4 and 3.25 (H2O-borne residue) and 3 and 1.2 (ethanol-borne residue). These values of S-deficient compositions suggest some decomposition of FeS during LAL, which is more pronounced in water, where iron sulfide could undergo some hydrothermal processes.74

3.1.3. Raman spectroscopy of particles. 
The Raman spectra of the residues obtained after the evaporation of water and ethanol reveal similar scattering patterns (Fig. 5). For both spectra, sharp intensive peaks positioned around 240 and 300 cm−1 followed by a less intense band at 410 cm−1 and scattering humps between 600 and 700 cm−1 have been detected. The peaks at 310, 240 and 410 cm−1 are assignable to the hexagonal (Fe1+xS) phase,75 while the less intense scattering at higher wavenumbers may correspond to Fe oxides.76,77 We note that the LAL conditions may also be favorable for the formation of FeSO4 hydrates having a ν4(SO4) band at 620 cm−1, but the absence of their most intense peak near 1000 cm−1 (ref. 78) is in accordance with a negligible, if any, presence of these species.

3.1.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 
Ablation of FeS in H2O. 
In the as prepared samples, a major contribution with S 2p3/2 binding energy 168.6 eV due to sulphate (SO32−) and very weak and broad bands in the sulphide region have been observed on the surface (Fig. 6a). After sputtering the superficial layer, the sulphate band vanished and a set of new bands with S 2p3/2 binding energies in the lower BE region proves the presence of sulphide (161.3 eV) and disulphide species (163.0 eV). The band with an S 2p3/2 binding energy of 166.4 eV is assigned to sulphur atoms in a SO32− environment. We note that surface sulphates are commonly observed on FeS/FeS2 surfaces exposed to water.79The Fe 2p3/2 spectra (Fig. 6b) show broad features, proving the presence of several iron bonds. In the as prepared sample, the band at 709.8 eV corresponds to Fe2+ in FeO,80 the band at 711.4 eV to Fe3+–O environments81 and the band at 713.7 eV is attributed to Fe atoms in FeSO4 or Fe2(SO4)3.79 After sputtering, a higher content of lower oxidation states of iron is visible, because the top of the broad Fe 2p3/2 band is shifted to lower binding energies. The band at 707.2 eV is unequivocally attributed to Fe atoms in iron sulphide and disulphide60 in accordance with the S 2p XP spectrum. The band at 709.2 corresponding to FeO shows a much higher content in comparison with the as prepared sample. The band at 711.2 eV is assigned as Fe3+–O and the band at 713.4 eV corresponds to the sulphite species.
 Fig. 6  Laser ablation of FeS in water, (a) as prepared samples, (b) Ar ion sputtered samples. 
Based on areas under Fe–S and combined Fe2+–O and Fe3+–O contributions, we can estimate that only 16 per cent of iron is bound as sulphides. The feature observed at about 714.8 eV can be regarded as a Fe2+ satellite of Fe 2p3/2 together with the corresponding 730.1 eV feature of Fe 2p1/2.
These data thus reveal that the highly oxidized surface composed of ferrous and ferric sulphates undergoes change by removing a 10 nm thick outer layer through Ar+ ion sputtering (90 s at 1.0 kV) into the surface with sulphides and a higher content of Fe2+ species, as proved by a more intense Fe2+ contribution and strong satellite lines belonging to the lower oxidation state of iron.
Ablation of FeS in EtOH. 
The ablation of the FeS target immersed in ethanol affords material, completely covered by sulphate, as observed in the S 2p XP spectrum of the superficial layer (Fig. 7a). The Fe 2p3/2 spectrum reveals contributions of Fe2+–O (709.6 eV), Fe3+–O (711.1) and iron sulphate (713.3 eV) species which have also been observed with LAL in water. Argon ion sputtering (90 s, 1.0 kV) confirms the preponderance of monosulphide, evidencing that FeS was kept in its original form (Fig. 7b). In the S–O region of the S 2p spectrum, sulphate predominates over sulphite, which is consistent with the easy oxidation of sulphites. In the Fe 2p spectrum of the sputtered material, Fe–S (707.2 eV), Fe2+–O (709.3 eV), Fe3+–O (711.2 eV) and iron sulphate/sulphite (713.5 eV) were recognized in the deconvoluted spectrum. Due to a higher content of Fe2+, the satellite line is more intense in comparison with that of FeS–H2O ablated material. A comparison of areas under Fe 2p3/2 contributions shows that only 12 per cent of iron is bound as sulphides.

3.1.5. HRTEM and electron diffraction analysis of particles. 
The X-ray diffraction analysis of the original FeS target is in accordance with hexagonal troilite (83%) (PDF 01-075-8712) and cubic iron (12%) (PDF 00-006-0696) and wüstite (5%) (PDF 01-074-6141). The TEM images (Fig. 8) show the presence of sub-μm-sized spheres in the residue obtained from water and sub-μm-sized platelets obtained in the residue obtained from ethanol. Hence, they provide complementary support to the SEM images of these residues.

The electron diffraction (Fig. 9) of the residue obtained from water indicates the presence of high-pressure orthorhombic FeS (JCPDS 76-0963), tetragonal maghemite γ-Fe2O3 (JCPDS 15-0615) and cubic magnetite Fe3O4 (JCPDS 07-0322). These data are consistent with an interlayer spacing of d = 0.311 nm (210) and d = 0.485 nm (111) respectively, corresponding to orthorhombic FeS and cubic Fe3O4 (Fig. 10).

The electron diffraction of FeS-derived particles generated in ethanol (Fig. 11) reveals hexagonal FeS (JCPDS 76-0962, JCPDS 80-1034) and cubic magnetite Fe3O4 (JCPDS 07-0322). The HRTEM images agree with electron diffraction results.

These data confirm the XPS identification of iron oxides and reveal that LAL in water results in orthorhombic FeS which represents a high-pressure FeS structure stable under ambient conditions. This phase has been so far identified only at 3.4 GPa (ref. 55) and there have been no reports on high pressure crystalline phases stable under ambient conditions produced by LAL except the transient detection of tetragonal Ge in an electric-field assisted LAL of Ge.8
It is assumed that LAL aids the formation of metastable phases due to laser-induced plasma confined in the surrounding liquid,82,83 resulting in delayed plasma expansion and shock wave emanation. The absorption of the later part of the laser pulse together with an ablated (ionized/evaporated) species from liquid-target interface leads to the shock wave and ensuing high pressure and high temperature that are by one order of magnitude higher than in laser ablation in a vacuum. Previous studies of LAL are consistent with a quite high plasma-induced pressure even without electric-field assistance. Thus, an XeCl laser pulse of 50 ns duration and 1–2 GW cm−2 power used in the LAL ablation of Al in water results in a plasma-induced pressure of 2–2.5 GPa84 or irradiation by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (λ = 532 nm, fluence = 80 J cm−2, pulse duration = 10 ns) onto a titanium target in DEI water, leading to pressures of about 18 GPa.85
The occurrence of an orthorhombic FeS phase under our conditions of a focused pulse of length 8 ns and an energy of 20 mJ thus shows that sufficient high-pressure and high temperature conditions for the formation of a high-pressure phase can be achieved by simple laser ablation in liquid without electric-field assistance and under a relatively low pulse energy.


3.1.6. Plausible media effects on the structure and stability of ablated nanoparticles. 
The LAL of FeS performed in water and ethanol under aerobic conditions can be judged to involve a complex scheme of plausible reactions of plasma-generated/plasma-ionized species and laser-ablated nanoparticles with both liquids and molecules of nitrogen and oxygen dissolved in these liquids. The solubility of O2 (ref. 86) and N2 (ref. 87) in ethanol being about 30 times higher than in water might enhance the chances for the plasma decomposition of both solutes in ethanol, but such assumption can be mistaken due to differences in plasma-induced decompositions of both liquids.
Reactions induced in plasma generated in aerated liquid water can be those of a multitude of highly reactive (e.g. electrons, H, N, O atoms and ions and OH radical) species that finally yield stable products like H2, O2 and H2O2. Such plasma processes were documented with an LAL of metals,88 laser-induced breakdown of aqueous colloidal solutions of nanoparticles,89,90 and various plasma-induced decompositions of water (e.g.91,92). Neither NO, NO2 and anionic NOx− species93,94 nor NH3 molecules94,95 can be rejected as possible products, since they have been detected in processes applying plasma over a water surface.
As for the above reactions induced in plasma generated in liquid ethanol, they are described as a source of H2, CO, CH4, other gases like CO2, C2H4 and C2H2 (ref. 96 and 97) and carbon dots96 and graphene nanosheets.98 These final products have been considered to arise from ethanol decomposition, but some oxidation steps are also possible due to dissolved molecular oxygen.
The surface of ablated FeS particles produced by LAL in water can be therefore modified by many routes of which oxidation steps appear to be dominant and permit the initial formation of FeS2, Fe3O4 or Fe2O3 and later oxidation of FeS2 to iron sulfates, supposedly FeSO4 and subsequently Fe2(SO4)3. In fact, such scheme terminated by the transformation of ferric sulfate to Fe2O3 was reported for the conventional thermal oxidation of FeS.99 The persistence of iron sulfates but not Fe3O4 in the outmost layer of the particles produced in the course of LAL thus indicates the effect of a short (ms) occurrence of ablated particles in LAL plume in the course of which sulfates cannot undergo transformation to Fe3O4.
The surface of ablated FeS particles produced by LAL in ethanol can be surmised to be modified by the oxidation steps initiated by the decomposition of dissolved O2 and ensuing radical abstractions of H from both C–H and O–H bonds by atomic O, resulting in a OH radical.100 Other routes can be those recognized as a decomposition of ethanol on noble metal surfaces into CO2 and CH4via C–C bond splitting101 and various catalyzed routes, some of which also lead to multiply oxygenated organic compounds.102 We hypothesize that these polyoxygenated compounds are also produced in the LAL of FeS in ethanol and can stabilize produced nanoparticles and protect them against agglomeration. A similar stabilizing action of nanoparticles is well known for polyols.103
It is therefore probable that the interaction of the topmost iron sulfate layers with ethanol or water is not important for particle stabilization and that an additional stabilization of nanoparticle surface observed in ethanol is provided by polyoxygenated compounds.
As for the formation of the high pressure form of FeS in water, it can be obviously ascribed to laser plasma expansion and/or shock wave under confinement of water. However, any discussion on why this form is produced in water and not in ethanol is difficult, since there is still a lack of knowledge regarding how different stages of complex mechanism of LAL nanoparticle formation are affected by the nature of liquid. Although liquid confinement effects on the mechanism of LAL have been reviewed (e.g.104) to show a multitude of reactive or at least noncongruent ablative formations of various nanosized particles in different liquid environments, the understanding of the formation and development of nanoparticles in different stages of complex LAL process is still limited to few cases utilizing a combination of highly sophisticated experimental and theoretical methods (e.g.105,106).


3.1.7. UV-vis spectroscopy of colloids. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra of FeS-derived colloids in water and ethanol (Fig. 13) are hardly affected by the superficial layer of ferrous and ferric sulphate hydrates on FeS-derived nanoparticles. These Fe2+ and Fe3+ compounds are respectively non-absorbing and slightly absorbing solar light, dissolve in water and are also slightly soluble in ethanol. The colloids show maximum absorption at 296 nm, which decays to 500 nm (sol in ethanol) or to 800 nm (sol in water). Such absorption corresponds107 to FeS nanoparticles, but can be partly due to iron oxides that have absorption, depending on their morphology,108 centered at 233 nm (magnetite109) or 290–310 nm (Fe2O3 (ref. 110)) and decaying to 650 nm. It thus appears that both colloids absorb visible light and that solar light absorption of the aqueous sol is higher, which is in accordance with the calculated band gaps of sols prepared in ethanol (3.062 eV) and water (2.66 eV). It is known that the band gap energy is directly related to the size of the materials111 and that the band gap of hexagonal FeS nanoparticles varies from 2.75 to 3.13 eV.112 We thus assume that the band gaps observed for both colloids may reflect the concomitant magnetite with a band gap of 2.12 eV (ref. 113) and tetragonal maghemite γ-Fe2O3 with a band gap energy of 2.17–2.18 eV.114

3.1.8. Photocatalytic activity of FeS-derived colloids. 
The photocatalytic effect of FeS-derived colloidal particles prepared in water and ethanol was tested in terms of MB degradation (Fig. 14). The MB solution without colloidal particles does not exhibit any depletion of MB after 3 h in the dark and only 2% depletion after 3 h exposure to daylight. In the presence of both colloids, a negligible depletion of MB in the dark reflects MB sorption to colloids and we assume that the small difference in absorption curves is due to a stronger interaction of MB with ethanol-borne sols that possess a greater surface area as confirmed by the DLS measurement. The exposure to daylight has a striking effect, since ∼53% MB depletion by sols borne in water and 46% MB depletion by sols borne in ethanol are observed. This can be accounted for only by MB degradation due to the absence of an adsorption peak at 256 nm assignable to the leuco-MB form (original UV-vis spectra of MB degradation are provided in the ESI, S1†). The somewhat greater MB depletion with water-borne sols may relate to differences in composition and/or physical nature (particle size and stability) of these sols.

3.2 Porous carriers

3.2.1 Morphology and porosity. 
The visualization of ceramic carriers on a macro scale showed the presence of a continuing structural grid formed by an interconnected, open porosity network. As seen from the μ-CT scan, the A-carrier shows a homogeneous open porosity115 with a macro pore size in the range of 1.25 to 2 mm (Fig. 15a).
 Fig. 15  (a) μ-CT scan of an A-carrier interconnected structure; (b) cross-sectional fracture area of an A-carrier strut; (c) μ-CT scan of a B-carrier interconnected structure; (b) cross-sectional fracture area of a B-carrier strut. 
It appears that the surface is shaped by partially sintered ceramic grains that form an open microporosity on the carrier surface. Fig. 15b shows in detail the fracture area of the neck of the ceramic strut, which presents a triangular profile of filament with an inner diagonal dimension from 250 to 300 μm. In addition, it is observed that a wall thickness of the struts varies in the range of 50 to 100 μm. Compared to microstructure and porosity, the B-carrier shows an interconnected cellular grid with a larger pore size in the range of 2 to 3 mm (Fig. 15c). The lower overall porosity is caused by the larger dimensions of the struts (300 to 400 μm in the cross-section) and the higher proportion of the solid phase. It was also seen that a uniform distribution of closed pores115 that occurred in the walls of the B-carrier struts with a diameter size between 10 and 50 μm as shown in Fig. 15d. Based on μ-CT data, the open porosity of the A, B-carriers was defined as a void space between the solid phase and closed pores in the walls of ceramic struts.
The data evaluation shows a higher open porosity in the A-carrier with a significantly lower content of closed porosity in the body struts. However, in both cases, the open porosity was higher than 70 vol% and the compressive strength of the experimental samples exceeded 2 MPa as summarized in Table 2. The reason for the structural differences of the carriers is undoubtedly the production method and chemical composition of both carriers, which is studied and compared in the following section.

3.2.2 Chemical and phase composition. 
The WDXRF analysis of the chemical composition of the A- and B-carriers is summarized in (Table 3). The A-carrier consists mostly of Al2O3 (∼85 wt%) with a lower content of SiO2 (∼14 wt%) and minor amount of CaO, MgO, Na2O, and Fe2O3. These results are in accordance with XRD analysis which confirms a majority of α-alumina, lower amount of quartz and minor content of cristobalite. The chemical composition of the B-carrier is expressed in the main oxides of a silica-modified geopolymer after heat treatment at 1300 °C. Table 3 shows the chemistry of a chamotte reinforced potassium-silica-based geopolymer matrix. A highly amorphous phase is predominantly formed from potassium silica solution, indicating a high content of silicon oxide (>50 wt%) and potassium oxide (>10 wt%).

The chemical composition is in good agreement with the detected crystalline phases evaluated by XRD. The main ones are tetragonal leucite (KAlSi2O6) and orthorhombic potassium aluminum silicate (KAlSiO4) with the remaining content of amorphous phase presented as a broad halo. The chamotte phase composition is in accordance with the manufacturer's report, giving mullite (Al6Si2O13), cristobalite (SiO2) and quartz (SiO2).67

3.3. Adsorption of FeS-derived sols onto porous carriers
The porous filters (A-and B-carriers) were immersed in ablatively prepared colloids in order to examine the adsorption of FeS-derived colloidal particles on porous rough surfaces and subsequently to investigate the potential for the functionalization of a porous filter by photocatalytic particles. The presence of Fe and S adsorbed on the surface of the A-carrier after immersion in ethanol- and water-borne FeS-derived colloids has been detected by many EDX analyses.
The average content of about 0.5 at% of Fe and S-deficient regions was assessed on the A carrier after immersion into a FeS-derived colloid in ethanol and that of about 0.2–0.3 at% of Fe and S-deficient regions were observed on the A carrier after immersion in FeS-derived colloid in water. These findings are in line with EDS analyses (in 3.3.1.) of the solid residues obtained upon dipping the colloids on Ta surface and evaporation of water or ethanol. The lower adsorption of the FeS-derived particles from the water colloid can be explained by a higher aggregation tendency of these particles in water (Section 3.1.1.) or by the different compositions of water- and ethanol-borne FeS-derived particles. EDX analyses of the B-carriers surface after immersion into the FeS-derived colloid confirm the absence of Fe and S and hence no adsorption ability of the B-filter.
The different adsorption ability of both porous carriers is explainable by the different surface morphology and different volume of surface open porosity. SEM images (Fig. 15d) show a relatively smooth morphology and closed porosity of the B-carrier. The surface morphology of the A-carrier (Fig. 15b) exhibits an abundant open-cell micro-porosity and a ragged morphology which is more favorable for the physical adsorption of the colloidal particles and their agglomerates. The open porosity values measured by μ-CT (Table 2) agree with a higher volume for the A-carrier (80.23 vol%) and a lower volume (72.89 vol%) for the B-carrier. This difference and rougher surface morphology and larger surface area of the A-carrier can be the main reason for its higher adsorption ability.
3.4. Photocatalytic activity of carriers coated with FeS-derived particles
The photocatalytic activity of pristine porous carriers and those with adsorbed FeS-derived particles, assessed in terms of MB degradation, is illustrated on Fig. 16 and we will compare MB depletions after 8 h. The curves of MB depletion in the presence of pristine B-carrier assessed in the dark and in daylight show 28% MB depletion, which implies mere MB adsorption and no photocatalytic effect. No photocatalytic effect is also seen with the B carrier functionalized by the FeS-derived colloids.
 Fig. 16  MB degradation with pristine and functionalized A- and B-carriers. (UV-vis spectra of individual samples are provided in the ESI, S1†). 
The curves of MB depletion in the presence of pristine A carrier assessed in the dark and daylight respectively show 60% and 72% MB depletion and confirm the good adsorption ability of the A carrier and some photocatalytic effect. The absorption is perhaps due to the mesoporous state,116 while the photocatalytic effect arises from alumina/silica nanoparticles117 and a minor amount of iron oxide (Fe2O3) in combination with the alumina matrix.118 The almost identical curves of MB depletion in the presence of the A carrier coated with the FeS-derived colloids formed in water or ethanol show 87% MB depletion and imply that the photocatalytic effect of both types of colloids is the same.
The same photocatalytic effect of water- and ethanol-borne sols bound to the A carrier (Fig. 16) and the somewhat higher photocatalytic effect but lower adsorption to the A carrier of the water-borne colloid compared to ethanol-born colloid (Sections 3.1.7. and 3.3.) deserve some comment. An intuitive and attractive explanation of these facts is the different photocatalytic effect of the high-pressure orthorhombic and hexagonal FeS structures, but other reasons, particularly the different content of iron oxides in water- and ethanol borne sols and different stabilities and agglomeration (Section 3.1.1.) can also play some role. The laser plasma provides many opportunities for elemental or multi-elemental targets to interact/react with highly energetic electrons, ionic or atomic (H, O) and radical (˙OH, ˙O2H) species and to take part in various redox paths.119 In non-degassed water, these paths are also affected by dissolved oxygen.120–122 The observed FeS polymorphs, disulfides, Fe oxides and sulphates thus reflect two key LAL channels that are (i) mere FeS physical ablation leading to FeS polymorphs (interestingly also a high-pressure polymorph) and (ii) reactive ablation in the course of which the disulfide and oxygenated compounds are produced. We can now just note that their birth is different from those of high temperature oxidation of FeS in dry air123 or room temperature oxidation of FeS in oxygen-bearing acidic solutions,124 which respectively take place via iron oxide to iron sulphates and via the oxidation of a protonated FeS surface leading to iron oxidic entities (Fe(OH)3, goethite and lepidocrocite), polysulfide and elemental sulfur.
Conclusions
Laser irradiation of hexagonal FeS in water and ethanol allow ablative dispersion of colloidal nanosized particles; the water-borne particles easily agglomerate and the ethanol-borne particles are stable for long periods of time.
The laser-produced nanosols show sulfur deficiency and their composition depends on the liquid medium. Hexagonal FeS and cubic magnetite Fe3O4 nanophases were produced in ethanol, while cubic magnetite Fe3O4 and tetragonal maghemite γ-Fe2O3 nanophases along with highly interesting high-pressure orthorhombic FeS nanophases stable under ambient conditions were detected in water.
Both types of FeS-derived sols absorb solar light radiation and act as solar light photocatalysts for methylene blue degradation. The unstable FeS-derived aqueous colloid shows a higher solar-light photocatalytic activity for MB degradation than the stable FeS-derived colloid obtained in ethanol.
Dipping of the colloids on Ta surface and subsequent evaporation of the liquids leads to different morphology. The water-borne colloid creates round-shaped nano- and micron-sized bodies, while the ethanol-borne colloid creates nano and micron-sized platelets.
The examination of adsorption of the colloidal FeS-derived particles on two porous alumina/silica-based filters of different surface morphology and volume of surface porosity confirmed that effective adsorption requires a higher open porosity and significantly lower content of closed porosity in the body struts. This pristine filter can act as a solar-light photocatalyst for MB degradation, but its solar-light photocatalytic efficiency is enhanced upon the absorption of FeS-derived sols.
The laser ablation in water without assistance of electric field allows conversion of hexagonal FeS into its orthorhombic phase and is the first LAL process leading to high-pressure phase stable under ambient conditions. The findings encourage further research on LAL directed to the formation of novel high-pressure phases.
The LAL is also revealed as a novel, facile and green approach for the functionalization of rough surfaces.
