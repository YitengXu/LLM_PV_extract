    , Accepted 25th August 2015First published on 27th August 2015AbstractThree novel copolymers P1–3 with alkylthiophenyl substituted benzodithiophene as the donor unit, thiophene as the spacer, and benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit have been designed, synthesized, and used as donor materials for polymer solar cells. Polymer solar cells with P3:PC71BM blends as the active layer exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.7% and a good tolerance to the change of film thickness. PCE higher than 7.3% can be obtained with the thickness of the active layer ranging from 90 to 380 nm, indicating that P3 is a very promising donor material for practical application.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted intensive research interest due to their unique characteristics, such as light weight, flexibility, and roll to roll processability.1 By material design, interfacial modification and device optimization, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been dramatically improved to more than 11% in the last two decades.2–4 However, due to the relatively low hole mobility of polymer materials, most high efficiency polymer donor materials are very sensitive to the thickness of the active layer. For most high efficiency polymer materials, the optimal thickness of the active layer is around 100 nm. Increasing the thickness of the active layer usually leads to a dramatic decrease of the PCE. For practical applications, it is quite difficult to fabricate defect free PSCs with an active layer thickness of about 100 nm by a roll to roll process. Only a limited number of conjugated polymers, which can produce high efficiency with a thick active layer, were reported.5–14 Therefore, it is quite important to develop new polymer donor materials that can still have high efficiency with a thicker active layer.
Donor–acceptor (D–A) design for conjugated polymers has been proved to be an efficient strategy to finely tune the energy levels of conjugated polymers.15–22 Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) is a commonly used donor unit for the synthesis of low band gap polymers and small molecules used for high performance polymer/organic solar cells.23–28 PCE higher than 10% has been achieved for single junction devices based on BDT containing polymers and small molecules.29,30 For BDT based polymers, introducing two-dimensional (2-D) conjugated side chains has been proved to be an efficient strategy to achieve high device performance. The influence of side chains on the performance of PSCs has been intensively investigated.31–35 Recently, the alkylthiothienyl group has been demonstrated to be a better substituent for BDT based polymers due to the weaker electron donating ability of the sulfur atom.35–37 Additionally, conjugated polymers bearing lateral alkylphenyl substituents could also afford high performance solar cells.21,38 Here, we designed and synthesized three new conjugated polymers, which contain benzodithiophene bearing two alkylthiophenyl side chains as the donor unit, benzothiadiazole derivatives as the acceptor unit, and thiophene as the spacer. PSCs based on P1 and P2, which contain a 5,6-bis(alkyloxy)benzothiadiazole acceptor unit, gave PCEs of 5.4% and 6.1%, respectively. PSCs based on P3, which contains a 5-alkyloxy-6-fluorobenzothiodiazole acceptor unit, exhibited the highest PCE of 7.7%. Most importantly, a PCE of 7.3% can still be achieved for P3 based PSCs with an active layer thickness of 378 nm, demonstrating that P3 is a very promising polymer for practical applications.
Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
The syntheses of monomer M4 and copolymers P1–3 are shown in Scheme 1. The treatment of compound 1 with n-BuLi at −78 °C was followed by quenching the formed aryl lithium with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione to afford the diol, which was converted to compound 2 in a total yield of 39% by the treatment with SnCl2 and dilute hydrochloric acid. The subtraction of two hydrogen atoms from compound 2 with n-BuLi at −78 °C was followed by reaction with trimethyl tin chloride to afford M4 in a yield of 90%. M1, M2 and M3 were prepared according to the literature.39–41 Three copolymers P1–3 were synthesized in yields of 62–96% by Stille polycondensation of M1, M2 and M3 with M4, respectively, using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst precursor in a solvent mixture of toluene and DMF at 110 °C under the protection of a nitrogen atmosphere. During the polymerization, part of the polymers precipitated from the reaction mixture and the precipitated polymer chains cannot further grow, leading to a broad molecular weight distribution. Since P1, carrying two octyloxy substituents on the benzothiadiazole unit, exhibits the poorest solubility among these three polymers, it has the largest polydispersity index (PDI) among these three polymers (vide infra). Although these copolymers exhibited limited solubility in chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) at room temperature, they could become fully soluble at elevated temperature.

The number average molecular weight (Mn) and PDI of copolymers were determined by GPC at 80 °C using CB as an eluent and narrow distributed polystyrenes as the calibration standards, and the results are summarized in Table 1. It is worth noting that high molecular weight polymers were obtained, which are beneficial to achieve high photovoltaic performance.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that all polymers have good thermal stability with the 5%-decomposition temperature up to 300 °C for P1, 300 °C for P2, and 310 °C for P3 under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI†). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements showed that only P3 had clear melting and recrystallization peaks located at approximately 165 °C and 120 °C, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). No obvious glass transition was detected for P1 and P2 by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements in the range of 50 to 250 °C. As shown in Fig. 1, P1–3 exhibit almost the same powdery X-ray diffraction (XRD) curves in the wide angle region with the broad diffraction peaks located at 2θ of 24.29°, 23.78° and 24.07°, respectively. The π–π stacking distances between polymer backbones are therefore calculated to be 3.66 Å for P1, 3.74 Å for P2 and 3.70 Å for P3.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of P1–3 were investigated by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and their absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2. All three polymers exhibit a broad absorption in the range of 350–700 nm. As shown in Fig. 2a, the absorption spectra of P1 in dilute DCB solution at room temperature and as thin films showed similar profiles with three peaks located at 425, 588 and 628 nm. After the solution was heated to about 150 °C, the absorption spectrum of P1 blue shifted and became much narrower. Such a phenomenon indicates that P1 undergoes aggregation even in dilute solution at room temperature, and the aggregates can be dissociated to form real solution at elevated temperature. In comparison with the solution absorption spectrum of P1 at 150 °C, the film one exhibited a red-shift of about 73 nm with the absorption onset at 692 nm. The optical band gap (Eg,opt) of P1 was therefore calculated to be 1.79 eV, according to the equation: Eg,opt = 1240/absorption onset. As for P2, its optical properties are quite similar to those of P1 as demonstrated in Fig. 2b. Similarly, the Eg,opt of P2 is calculated to be 1.78 eV. The absorption spectra of P3 in DCB solution at 150 °C, in DCB solution at room temperature, and as thin films are shown in Fig. 2c. Moving from solution at 150 °C to thin films, the absorption spectra of P3 are gradually red-shifted. The above results demonstrated that P3 forms real solution at 150 °C in DCB solution, after being cooled down to room temperature, the polymer chains form weaker aggregates, and as thin films the aggregation is further enhanced. The different behaviour of P3 is probably due to its better solubility in DCB solution than that of P1 and P2.

The electrochemical properties of P1–3 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a standard three electrode electrochemical cell.
As shown in Fig. 3, these three polymers exhibited quasi reversible redox processes. The onset oxidation potentials of polymer films for P1, P2 and P3 are 0.71, 0.70, and 0.89 V, respectively. HOMO levels of P1, P2, and P3 were determined, using the equation EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71), to be −5.42, −5.41, and −5.60 eV, respectively. LUMO levels of P1, P2 and P3 were therefore calculated according to the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt to be −3.63, −3.63 and −3.84 eV, respectively. In comparison with P1 and P2 with 5,6-bis(alkyloxy)benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit, P3 with 5-fluoro-6-alkyloxybenzothiodiazole as the acceptor unit exhibits not only a slightly broader absorption spectrum but also lower HOMO and LUMO levels (Table 2).

Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of P1–3, PSCs with a device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/LiF/Al were fabricated. Firstly, devices with an active layer thickness of about 100 nm were fabricated to optimize the weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM. For P1 and P2, devices fabricated from DCB solutions with a polymer:PC71BM weight ratio of 1:2.5 gave the best performance. A PCE of 5.4% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 11.60 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.63 for P1 and a PCE of 6.1% with a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 11.26 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.72 for P2 were obtained. For P3, devices fabricated with a polymer to PC71BM weight ratio of 1:2 from DCB solution gave the best performance with a PCE of 5.7%, a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 9.38 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.72. The results are summarized in Table S1.† Solvent additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphalane (1-CN) were used in different concentrations to further optimize the film morphology of the active layer. Only for P3, the use of DIO (2.0%, by volume) as the processing additive has a positive effect. The PCE of polymer solar cells can be markedly enhanced to 7.4% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 12.28 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.73. J–V curves of devices under simulated solar illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4 with the corresponding parameters summarised in Table 3.

After the preliminary optimization, the thickness of the active layer was further screened, and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5. It was difficult to obtain a thick active layer for P1 due to its limited solubility in hot DCB. For P2, after the thickness of the active layer was increased to about 220 nm, the Jsc enhanced to 13.18 mA cm−2, the FF decreased to 0.59, and the PCE decreased to 5.7%. For P3, after the thickness of the active layer was increased to 250 nm, devices gave the best performance with a PCE of 7.7%, a Jsc of 14.33 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.79 V, and an FF of 0.69. Further increasing the thickness of the active layer to 378 nm, the Jsc increased to 15.12 mA cm−2, but the FF decreased to 0.60, leading to a slightly decreased PCE of 7.3%. Even after increasing the thickness of the active layer to 480 nm, devices still gave a PCE of 6.6% with the Jsc slightly decreased to 14.84 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.57. It is worth noting that efficiencies higher than 7.3% can be achieved for devices with a thickness in the range of 90 to 380 nm. The detailed device characteristics including standard deviations are summarized in Table 4, indicating that P3 is a very promising donor material for practical applications. To further understand the unique behaviour of P3, hole mobilities of blend films were measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method and the data are summarized in Table 4. The hole mobility of P3 based blend films was calculated to be 3 orders higher than P1 and P2 based blend films. Such a high hole mobility for the P3:PC71BM blend films is consistent with the high PCE of P3 based PSCs even with an active layer thickness up to about 500 nm. High mole mobility is beneficial for the efficient charge separation and transportation.

As shown in Fig. 6, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the P1–3 devices fabricated under the optimized conditions were measured and used to verify the accuracy of the Jsc values from the J–V measurements. The Jsc values obtained by integrating the EQE curves with the AM 1.5G solar spectrum agreed well with the Jsc values from J–V measurements, namely the difference is within 5%.

The morphology of the active layer plays a very crucial role in the performance of PSCs; high efficiency PSCs require that the polymer donor and PC71BM acceptor form bicontinuous networks, which have a large interfacial area and a phase-separated domain size of 10–20 nm, and can facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport. Therefore, the film morphology of active layers was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the images are shown in Fig. 7. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM blend films fabricated from DCB solutions formed relatively homogenous films with sparse large domains, and no obvious nanoscale phase separation can be observed. As shown in Fig. 7c, the P3:PC71BM blend films fabricated from pure DCB solutions exhibited a large scale phase separation. The dark domains are probably PC71BM aggregates and the lighter ones are probably polymer aggregates. After the addition of DIO (2.0%, by volume) as the processing additive, the P3:PC71BM blend films became much more homogenous; nanofibrils and bicontinuous interpenetrating networks were formed as shown in Fig. 7d. The morphology of P3:PC71BM blend films obviously benefits the charge dissociation and transportation, leading to a high hole mobility and a high efficiency even when the thickness of the active layer is up to 480 nm.

Conclusions
Three novel copolymers P1–3 with benzodithiophene bearing two alkylthiophenyl side chains as the donor unit, thiophene as the spacer, and benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit have been designed, synthesized and characterized. BHJ PSCs fabricated with P1–3 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor with a thickness of about 100 nm afforded high device performances with PCEs up to 5.4% for P1, 6.1% for P2 and 7.4% for P3. Only for the mono-fluoro substituted benzothiadiazole based P3, the PCE of devices is insensitive to the thickness of the active layer. Devices with an active layer thickness of 250 nm gave the best PCE of 7.7%. Even when the thickness of the active layer was increased to 480 nm, devices still gave a PCE of 6.4%. The good tolerance to the thickness of the active layer made P3 a very promising donor material for practical applications.
