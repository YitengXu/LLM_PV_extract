    , Accepted 4th January 2021First published on 5th January 2021AbstractSurface modification of exoelectrogens with photoelectric materials is a promising way for achieving photo-assisted microbial fuel cells (MFCs). However, the poor conductivity of most photoelectric materials inevitably hampers the electron transfer inside bacterial biofilms. Herein, by utilizing the electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly strategy, the conductive Au nanoparticles (NPs) and photo-responsive CdS NPs were alternatively modified onto the surface of Escherichia coli for photo-assisted bioanodes in MFCs. The CdS layer was found to protect the bacterial cells from light illumination-induced inactivation. When the CdS layer coexisted with an outer layer of Au NPs, the modification of the CdS layers can generate photocurrent without any loss of biocurrent, because the outer Au layer could serve as a conductive channel for the photoelectron and bioelectron transfer between each bacterium. But the increase of CdS layers failed to further improve the photocurrent, implying that the light was inaccessible to the inner CdS layer. This work brings a universal way to fabricate conductive and photo-responsive bacteria, which would deepen the application of cell-surface modification technology in photo-assisted MFCs.
1. Introduction
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a class of electricigen-involving electrochemical systems, which can extract chemical energy from organic waste and convert the chemical energy into electric energy, making them highly appealing for wastewater treatment and renewable energy generation.1–3 But the fact is that the output of MFCs is relatively low and may not satisfy the power demands for most electronic products independently.4–6 In this context, performance improvement has been the main stream of the development of MFCs. Aside from the optimization of each component, another effective route is the exploitation of photo-assisted MFCs, through which solar light harness is integrated with MFC technology to realize multiple energy conversion and performance improvement.7
Up to now, photo-assisted MFCs have been diverse, and now include the use of photosynthetic strains, photo-cathodes and photo-anodes in the traditional MFCs.8–13 Among them, the introduction of a photo-anode is complicated and challenging due to the fact that bacterial adhesion may block the permeability of light towards the photo-anode. To avoid this issue, photo-responsive materials are usually modified onto one side of the ITO electrode, while leaving the other side exposed to light.9,14–16 Obviously, such an arrangement reduces the utilization efficiency of the anode compared to a double-sided bacterial attachment in traditional MFCs, which may produce a lower operating voltage. More recently, our group has created a new mode to introduce a photo-responsive material into a MFC anode by cell-surface modification technology.17 Carbon dot-modified bacterial cells can be absorbed onto both sides of the substrate electrode, in which at least the carbon dots modified on the surface of the outmost bacterial cells can absorb solar light without any obstacles for further upgrading the performance under light illumination. A carbon dot is a special photo-responsive material, which can meet the demands of both photo-responsive ability and conductivity. However, most of the known photo-responsive materials possess poor conductivity, which will hamper the electron transfer.18 With the intention to improve the flexibility of the cell-surface modification technology in photo-assisted MFCs, it is still interesting to search for a way to make this technology work when such a photo-responsive material with poor conductivity is used as a modifier.
To offset the poor conductivity of a photo-responsive material, a general solution is to simultaneously introduce an extra conductive material as a surface modifier. However, how to modify and arrange these two types of materials should be considered. The electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly technique seems to be a very convenient way to realize this target.19–22 Through the electrostatic LbL process, the negatively charged cell membrane can be modified by a kind of positively charged material, and other kinds of negatively charged materials can be subsequently modified to achieve the number of desired layers.23 Moreover, the LbL self-assembly process is tunable and can be stopped at any layer to regulate the surface composition,24 which is beneficial to achieve an optimal arrangement that can produce high biocurrent and photocurrent.
As is well-known, Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) are widely identified as good surface modifiers of electricigens to improve the electron transfer because of their good biocompatibility and conductivity, as well as tunable surface charge for electrostatic layer-by-layer self-assembly.25–27 And CdS NPs have been successfully used as the surface modifier of different bacteria to harness solar light for CO2 reduction and H2 evolution due to their broad-spectrum absorption and high light-harvesting efficiency.28–30 In this study, Au NPs and CdS NPs were selected as candidates for the conductive material and photo-responsive material with poor conductivity, respectively. Based on the electrostatic LbL self-assembly technique (Scheme 1), the positively charged Au NPs and negatively charged CdS NPs were alternatively modified onto the surface of Escherichia coli for the formation of functionalized bacterial cells (E. coli@Aun@CdSm, n is the number of Au layers and m is the number of CdS layers). When they were integrated with carbon felt to fabricate the photo-bioanode, the photo-bioanode with E. coli@Au2@CdS1 instead of E. coli@Au1@CdS1 displayed an obvious photocurrent while retaining a high biocurrent, implying that the outmost Au layer was indispensable for accelerating the transfer of bioelectrons and photoelectrons between each functioned bacterial cell. Although the E. coli@Au3@CdS2 has an increased number of CdS layers compared to E. coli@Au2@CdS1, no increased photocurrent was produced in this photo-bioanode, which might be attributed to the weak penetration of light towards the inner CdS layer. Moreover, the viability of bacterial cells under light illumination was found to be better after the modification of the CdS layer. These results would provide guidance on the future investigation of single cell-surface modification technology for photo-assisted MFCs.

2. Experimental details
2.1 Chemicals and materials

E. coli K-12 (ATCC 29181) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Chloroauric acid, thioacetamide (TAA), glucose and poly(diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the other chemicals including cadmium chloride, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA), Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. M9 buffer solution (KH2PO4, 3 mg mL−1; Na2HPO4·4H2O, 15 mg mL−1; NaCl, 5 mg mL−1; MgSO4, 0.12 mg mL−1) was prepared for further use. Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ resistivity, Milli-Q, Millipore) was used in all experiments. All media and solutions were sterilized before use.
2.2 Apparatus
Zeta potentials were measured by using a ZETASIZER nanoseries (Nano-ZS, Malvern) at room temperature. Hydrodynamic diameter distribution was obtained by using a 90° Nanoparticle Size Analyzer BI-200SM (Brookhaven, US). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a hot field-emission scanning electron microscope, JSM-7800F (JEOL, Japan). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were carried out on a JEM-2800 at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV (JEOL, Japan). Confocal microscopy images (CLSM) were acquired via a TCS SP8 microscope (Leica, Germany). The crystalline properties of the samples were analyzed by using an X-ray diffraction XRD-6000 (Shimadzu, Japan). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using an Autolab PGSTAT-204 (Metrohm, Switzerland) with a frequency change from 105 to 10−3. Other electrochemical measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation CHI-660D (Chenhua, China) with a conventional three-electrode system using a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode in M9 buffer solution. A xenon lamp 7ILX-500 (500 W, 20 A, SOFN Instruments Co., Ltd, China) coupled with an AM 1.5 global filter was utilized as the light source.
2.3 Synthesis of positively charged Au nanoparticles
To obtain the positively charged Au NPs, the PDDA protected Au NPs were synthesized according to the literature.31 NaOH (4 mg) and HAuCl4 (1 wt%, 100 μL,) were added into the PDDA solution (0.025 wt%, 40 mL). After stirring for 2 min, the mixed solution was maintained at 100 °C for 15 min until the color of the solution changed from colorless to red. PDDA-protected Au NPs were collected by centrifugation (14000 rpm, 25 min) and washed three times to remove the remaining precursors. The SEM image, TEM image, XRD pattern and UV/Vis spectra of the sample demonstrated the successful preparation of Au NPs, while the ζ-potential measurement revealed that the Au NPs presented highly positive charge (41.3 ± 0.9 mV). Moreover, the hydrodynamic diameter of Au NPs was 18.36 ± 0.18 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†).
2.4 Synthesis of negatively charged cadmium sulfide nanoparticles
CdCl2·2.5H2O (18.27 mg) and 3-MPA (17.2 μL) were dissolved in 20 mL of ultrapure water followed by adjusting the pH to 10. TAA (15 mg) was added into the solution after the air was replaced by nitrogen gas. The solution was constantly stirred for 0.5 h and maintained at 80 °C for 2 h until the yellow transparent solution was obtained. The final reaction products were centrifuged and washed thoroughly with absolute ethanol and ultrapure water three times, respectively. The resulting product was dispersed in 20 mL of ultrapure water for further use. The SEM, TEM, XRD and UV/Vis spectroscopy characterization demonstrated that the sample was indeed the CdS NP. Its ζ-potential value was −38.9 ± 1.6 mv, while the hydrodynamic diameter was 7.29 ± 0.14 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†).
2.5 Construction of LbL self-assembled bacterial cells and bacteria/carbon felt photo-bioanodes

E. coli K-12 cells were cultured in LB broth for 24 h (37 °C, 150 rpm) and washed three times for further use. The bacterial cells were then dispersed in 10 mL of M9 buffer solution to prepare a uniform suspension (OD600 = 0.78). The negatively charged cells were then mixed with positively charged Au NPs (4 mL, 3 mg mL−1) on a shaker (200 rpm) for 15 min. The cells were collected by centrifugation and reacted with negatively charged CdS NPs (2 mL, 4 mg mL−1) using the previous step. Then the previous two steps were alternately performed. By controlling the number of self-assembled layers, we obtained different LbL self-assembled bacteria. The as-obtained different bacterial cells were washed and absorbed onto carbon felt (1 × 1 × 0.1 cm) to build photo-bioanodes. For comparison, native bacteria/carbon felt electrodes were also fabricated by the same procedure.
2.6 MFC construction and operation

I–T curves were measured at a constant potential of 0.2 V in a three-electrode configuration with a SCE as the reference electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode and the obtained photo-bioanode as the working electrode. 20 mL of M9 buffer solution containing 5 wt% LB broth, 55 mM glucose and 5 mM HNQ was used as the electrolyte solution.32 The bio-current produced by the electrochemical cell was measured in the first cycle, while the light illumination (on/off, 45/15 min) was introduced three times when the biocurrent reached a plateau in cycles 2, 3 and 4. Meanwhile, the cooling equipment was used to maintain a consistent system temperature under illumination conditions.
The H-shaped dual-chamber MFCs were prepared, in which the chambers were separated by a proton-exchange membrane (Nafion 117, DuPont).33 After sterilization, 30 mL of M9 buffer solution containing 5% LB broth, 55 mM glucose and 5 mM HNQ was added to the anodic chamber. The catholyte contains 30 mL of phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 7.4) and 50 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]. The prepared photo-bioanode was used as the anode, while the carbon paper (2 × 2 cm) was utilized as the cathode and connected to an external resistance of 1000 Ω. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to obtain the polarization curves at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 with or without light when the MFC reached a steady state. The current density and power output density in electrochemical measurements were normalized to the projected area of the anode with no special instruction.
2.7 Analysis of LbL self-assembled bacterial cells (SEM, TEM and viability test)
The LbL self-assembled bacterial cells were suspended in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution overnight for cell fixation, and then a series of ethanol solutions (25%, 50%, 75%, 95% and 100%) were used to dehydrate the cells.34 Finally, 20 μL of ethanol solution of LbL self-assembled bacterial cells were added dropwise on the ITO electrode or copper grids, and dried at room temperature for SEM and HRTEM tests, respectively.
The cell viabilities were estimated by examining the membrane integrity using a LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit.35 The LbL self-assembled bacterial cell suspension (1 mL) was mixed with 10 μL of the dye mixture (SYTO 9/propidium iodide (PI), 1:1). After being incubated under dark conditions for 20 min, the samples were imaged through a TCS SP8 microscope. SYTO 9 signals were detected using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 503 nm. PI was excited at 543 nm and the emission was collected through a long band-pass filter at 605 nm. The viabilities of the bacterial cells on the photo-bioanodes were also monitored. After the operation of MFCs for 0 and 200 h, the photo-bioanodes were removed from MFCs. To investigate the effect of light illumination on the viabilities, 3 h of light illumination (on/off, 45/15 min, four times) was used for the MFC with a 200 h of operation. After that, the photo-anode was also removed from the MFC. These removed photo-bioanodes were washed three times followed by immerging in 2 mL of phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0) containing 50 μL of SYTO 9 and 50 μL of PI dyes. After being incubated under dark conditions for 20 min, the samples were imaged through a TCS SP8 microscope. The following procedure was similar to that disclosed above. For comparison, native cells and different LbL self-assembled bacterial cells were also examined using the same procedure mentioned above.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the LbL self-assembled bacterial cells
Given the positively charged Au NPs and negatively charged CdS NPs in hand, we alternatively modified them onto the bacterial surfaces. Each modification step was monitored by ζ-potential measurements. As shown in Fig. 1A, the E. coli presents an initial ζ-potential of −45.3 ± 0.3 mV, confirming that the native bacterial cell is usually negatively charged.17 The ζ-potential of E. coli periodically alternates between positive values and negative values after each modification. The cell surface is positive when the outermost layer is Au NPs, while it is negative with each CdS-modification step. The crystallographic structure of E. coli was investigated by XRD analysis after each modification. The first modification of the Au NP layer produced four new characterization peaks in the XRD pattern of E. coli@Au1@CdS0, which are located at the 2θ = 38.2°, 44.4°, 64.6° and 77.6° (curve 1/0, Fig. S2A, ESI†). They can be ascribed to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of Au NPs according to previous reports.36 After the further modification of the CdS NP layer, two other new characterization peaks at 2θ = 26.4° and 51.9° are observed in the XRD pattern of E. coli@Au1@CdS1, which can be assigned to the (111) and (311) planes of CdS NPs (curve 1/1, Fig. S2A, ESI†).37 As the modification process continues, no new peak appears in the XRD patterns. But the intensity ratio of the peak at 38.2° (Au NPs) to the peak at 26.4° (CdS NPs) periodically oscillates, which is above the value of 1 with Au NPs as the terminating layer while below the value of 1 with CdS NPs as the terminating layer (Fig. S2B, ESI†).

(J–M) TEM mapping images of E.coli@Au3@CdS2. 
The above results of alternating surface charges and compositions powerfully indicate that the Au NPs and CdS NPs are sequentially coated with bacterial cells through electrostatic interactions. On the basis of this, we then investigated the morphologies of native E. coli and the LbL self-assembled E. coli by means of SEM and TEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B and F, a smooth surface is observed for the native E. coli. After undergoing an Au NP-modification step, some particles with a diameter of more than 10 nm existed on the surface of E. coli@Au1@CdS0 (Fig. 1C and G). The subsequent CdS NP-modification step made the cell surface rough (Fig. 1D and H). And the high-resolution image inset in Fig. 1H reveals that some particles with a size of a few nanometers were present on the surface of E. coli@Au1@CdS1 except the Au NPs. When the fifth modification step was completed, the E. coli cells were encapsulated by these two kinds of nanoparticles (Fig. 1E and I). Moreover, the TEM mapping images display the existence of high-density Au and Cd elements on their surface. These results further confirm that the electrostatic LbL self-assembly of Au and CdS NPs on the cell surfaces of E. coli is indeed feasible.
Addressing the biocompatibility of the modification process and surface modifiers is a prerequisite for the application of functionalized bacterial cells into various areas. Therefore, we evaluated the viability of native E. coli and the LbL self-assembled E. coli by using a LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit, which examined the membrane integrity of the cell. The viable cells with an intact membrane will stain SYTO 9 to emit green fluorescence, whereas the dying cells will stain propidium iodide (PI) to produce red fluorescence due to its compromised membrane. Obviously, the CLSM image of native E. coli exhibits bright green fluorescence and negligible red fluorescence (Fig. 2A). Such bright green fluorescence can also be observed in the CLSM image of E. coli@Au1@CdS0 (Fig. 2B), while the red fluorescence has no obvious increase in the CLSM image of E. coli@Au1@CdS1 (Fig. 2C), indicating that the E. coli sustains a high viability. Thus, we can conclude that both the Au NP-modification and CdS NP-modification have almost no adverse influence on the viability of E. coli. In addition, the CLSM image of E. coli@Au3@CdS2 is still dominated by green fluorescence (Fig. 2D), which supports that the whole LbL self-assembly process is cytocompatible. The cell-growth curves (Fig. S3, ESI†) of LbL self-assembled E. coli cells showed that the cells kept normally dividing and growing after each modification. More importantly, there were no obvious differences between native E. coli cells and LbL self-assembled E. coli cells, which further confirmed that the cell viabilities had not been obviously affected by the self-assembly processes.

3.2 Conductivities and current generation capabilities of photo-bioanodes with LbL self-assembled bacterial cells
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the conductivity of E. coli after each modification.
Before the test, the bacterial cells were absorbed onto carbon felt for the fabrication of the photo-bioanode. The diameter of the semicircle in Fig. 3A represents the electron transfer resistance (Rct).32 The Rct value of the photo-bioanode with native E. coli is about 980 Ω (curve I), confirming the poor conductivity of the bacterial cell. As for the E. coli@Au1@CdS0, the Rct value of the prepared photo-bioanode decreases to 65 Ω (curve II), due to the fact that the conductive Au NPs can act as a high-speed channel for electron transfer between each bacterial cell. In contrast, this high-speed channel may be hampered by CdS NPs due to their poor conductivity, so the Rct value of the prepared photo-bioanode with E. coli@Au1@CdS1 increases to 220 Ω (curve III). With a further modification of Au NP layers (E. coli@Au2@CdS1), we observe that the Rct value of the prepared photo-bioanode restores to 60 Ω, implying that the high-speed electron transfer channel can be rebuilt. The Rct values of photo-bioanodes with E. coli@Au2@CdS2 and E. coli@Au3@CdS2 (230 and 67 Ω, Fig. S4A, ESI†) further demonstrated that the Au NP-modification indeed improved the conductivity whereas the CdS NP-modification negated the positive effect of Au NP-modification in conductivity to some extent.
 Fig. 3  The Nyquist curves (A) and current–time curves (B) of the photo-bioanode with native E. coli (I) and LbL self-assembled E. coli (II E. coli@Au1@CdS0, III E. coli@Au1@CdS1, and IV E. coli@Au2@CdS1). The frequency ranged from 105 to 10−3 Hz, and the inset shows the enlarged view of the curves. The substrate and electron mediator was refreshed for each cycle. The yellow arrow indicated the introduction of light illumination (on/off, 45/15 min for each time). 
We then probed the current generation capabilities of these photo-bioanodes in the electrochemical cells (ECs) with the addition of HNQ as the mediator. All the ECs were tested under dark conditions in the first cycle (cycle 0) to assess the biocurrent generation ability, while the light illumination (on/off, 45/15 min) was introduced three times when the biocurrent reached a plateau in each of the three remaining cycles. As shown in Fig. 3B and Table S1 (ESI†), the plateau current density produced by photo-bioanodes with native E. coli without light illumination is 0.23, 0.21, 0.16 and 0.15 mA cm−2 for each cycle. And the averaged plateau current density is 0.19 ± 0.04 mA cm−2, which can be regarded as its maximum biocurrent density. With light illumination, we can observe that the plateau current density increases or decreases according to the light on/off in every cycle. The averaged plateau current density in each cycle is 0.27, 0.24 and 0.2 mA cm−2, and thus the average value of these three cycles is 0.24 ± 0.04 mA cm−2, which reflects a net increase of 0.05 mA cm−2. As no photo-response is obtained, such a net increase can be attributed to the background current density caused by the increased electron mediating capability of HNQ under light illumination.38 As for the photo-bioanode with E. coli@Au1@CdS0, the maximum biocurrent density increases to 0.48 ± 0.06 mA cm−2, but no obvious current was detected when Au NPs were modified on the electrode without the cells (Fig. S5, ESI†), indicating that the modification of the Au NP layer improves the electron transfer for producing higher current. Meanwhile, the net increase of current density under light illumination is 0.12 mA cm−2. But the ratio of this net increase to the maximum biocurrent density (Cnet/BioCmax) is almost equal to that of photo-bioanodes with E. coli (25.00 vs. 26.32%), thus the higher net increase is due to the fact that the improved conductivity of photo-bioanodes makes the background current more prominent. After a further CdS NP-modification (E. coli@Au1@CdS1), we find that the maximum biocurrent density decreases to 0.38 ± 0.02 mA cm−2, suggesting that the poor conductivity of CdS NPs lowers the electron transfer efficiency. Interestingly, although CdS NPs are photo-responsive materials, the net increase in the current density with light illumination is only 0.13 mA cm−2. And the Cnet/BioCmax slightly increases to 34.21%, which indicates a poor production of photocurrent.
With the modification continuing, the maximum biocurrent density of the photo-bioanode with E. coli@Au2@CdS1 restores to 0.53 ± 0.03 mA cm−2 due to the rebuilding of highly efficient electron transfer channels. More importantly, the net increase in the current density with light illumination reaches 0.26 mA cm−2 with a Cnet/BioCmax as high as 49.06%, indicating a good photocurrent generation ability. The E. coli@Au2@CdS2 produced a low maximum biocurrent density (0.40 ± 0.04 mA cm−2) and Cnet/BioCmax value (32.50%) whereas the E. coli@Au3@CdS2 generated a high maximum biocurrent density (0.52 ± 0.03 mA cm−2) and Cnet/BioCmax value (53.85%), which further confirmed that the modification of CdS NPs could produce high photocurrent without any loss of biocurrent only when the outmost layer is Au NPs (Fig. S4B, ESI†). Moreover, the E. coli@Au3@CdS2 exhibits a similar maximum biocurrent density and Cnet/BioCmax value compared to those of E. coli@Au2@CdS1; we thus conclude that the inner CdS NP layer may be inaccessible to the light.
3.3 MFC performance and mechanism discussion
To further probe the application potential of the photo-bioanodes with LbL self-assembled E. coli, they were used to fabricate the photo-assisted MFCs with carbon paper as the traditional cathode. As the photo-bioanodes with E. coli@Au2@CdS2 and E. coli@Au3@CdS2 exhibited similar performance to E. coli@Au1@CdS1 and E. coli@Au2@CdS1, there were no further investigations on these two kinds of LbL self-assembled E. coli. Fig. 4A shows the polarization curves of these photo-assisted MFCs. Under dark conditions, the output voltage of MFCs with E. coli decreased fast with the decrement of external load (dotted line I). In contrast, this downward trend becomes very slow for the MFCs with E. coli@Au1@CdS0 and E. coli@Au2@CdS1 (dotted line II and IV), reflecting a much smaller internal resistance due to the facilitated electron transfer. The downward trend of E. coli@Au1@CdS1 is faster than that of E. coli@Au2@CdS1 (dotted line III vs. IV), further confirming that the CdS NP-modification hampers the electron transfer and thus increases the internal resistance. Moreover, under light illumination, we observe that the downward trend of MFCs with E. coli@Au2@CdS1 becomes more gente (solid line IV vs. dotted line IV) while it slightly changes for the MFC with E. coli@Au1@CdS0 (solid line II vs. dotted line II), highlighting the function of CdS NPs in harvesting the solar light. With regards to power output (Fig. 4B), the MFCs with E. coli@Au2@CdS1 and E. coli@Au1@CdS0 exhibit a similar maximum power density under dark conditions (1704.3 vs. 1630.9 mW m−2, dotted curve II and IV), which is 2.9 and 1.4 times that of the MFC with E. coli and E. coli@Au1@CdS1 (590.2 and 1185.7 mW m−2, dotted curve I and III), respectively. Under light illumination, the maximum power density of MFCs with E. coli@Au2@CdS1 increases to 2300.4 mW m−2 (solid curve IV), and the net increase value (596.1 mW m−2) is 9.2, 2.5 and 2.8 times that of MFC with E. coli, E. coli@Au1@CdS0 and E. coli@Au1@CdS1 (64.8, 232.2 and 215.6 mW m−2, solid curve I, II and III), respectively. More impressively, the output power density of the presented photo-assisted MFC with E. coli@Au2@CdS1 is obviously superior to those of previously reported photo-assisted MFCs using carbon dot-modified exoelectrogen or biofilm-attached photoanodes. Even under the dark conditions, the maximum power density is also higher than those of MFCs integrated with cell-modification technology (Table S2, ESI†). The above results demonstrated the superiority of E. coli@Au2@CdS1 in photo-assisted MFCs.

TThe cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis of these photo-bioanodes was performed in the presence of HNQ to obtain insight into the performance improvement mechanism of MFCs. As shown in Fig. 4C, no obvious redox peaks are observed in the CV curve of the photo-bioanode with E. coli under dark conditions (dotted curve I). In contrast, a pair of redox peaks at −0.27 V and 0.02 V appears in the CV curve of the photo-bioanode with E. coli@Au1@CdS0 (dotted curve II), which matches with the electrochemical response of the HNQ.39 As for the photo-bioanodes with E. coli@Au1@CdS1, similar redox peaks (dotted curve III, −0.32 and 0.06 V) can be found but with a larger peak distance (0.38 vs. 0.29 V), indicating relatively low electron transfer efficiency caused by the poor conductivity of CdS NPs. The peak distance shortens again in the CV curve of photo-bioanodes with E. coli@Au2@CdS1 (dotted curve IV, 0.31V), indicating that the electron transfer efficiency can be restored by the further Au NP-modification. More importantly, the reduction peak potential positively shifts from −0.28 to −0.26 V while the oxidation peak potential negatively shifts from 0.05 to −0.01 V under light illumination (solid curve IV), indicating an accelerated electron transfer. As the reduction and oxidation peak potentials in the CV curve of photo-bioanodes with E. coli@Au1@CdS0 basically remain unchanged under light illumination (solid curve II), such accelerated electron transfer can be attributed to that the photo-induced electrons and carriers produced by CdS NPs promote the redox of HNQ. And both the reduction and oxidation peak potentials shift negatively in the CV curve of photo-bioanodes with E. coli@Au1@CdS1 (solid curve III), indicating that the relatively inefficient electron transfer channel between each bacterial cell hampers the promotion of the redox of HNQ by photo-induced electrons and carriers.
3.4 Viability of LbL self-assembled E. coli in photo-assisted MFCs
To probe whether the nanoparticle-modification could provide protection during the operation of the photo-bioanode, the viabilities of bacterial cells on the photo-bioanode were assessed by using a LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit. As shown in Fig. 5A–D, all the CLSM images of photo-bioanodes exhibit bright green fluorescence in the initial stage, suggesting that the fabrication process of the photo-bioanode does not have any effect on the bacterial activity. After operation for 200 h, the red fluorescence increases in the CLSM images of photo-bioanodes with E. coli, while the CLSM images of the other three photo-bioanodes still show negligible red fluorescence, confirming that the surface modifiers can protect the bacterial cells from unfavourable factors produced by MFC operation.35 Interestingly, the CLSM images of photo-bioanodes with E. coli show strong red fluorescence after operation of the photo-assisted MFCs with light illumination for 3 h, reflecting that the UV light damages the bacterial cells. But in the CLSM images of photo-bioanodes with E. coli@Au1@CdS1 and E. coli@Au2@CdS1, much weak red fluorescence can be observed, indicating an improved viability. As the CLSM image of photo-bioanodes with E. coli@Au1@CdS0 also shows relatively strong red fluorescence, it can be understood that such improved viability should have originated from the inherent properties of CdS NPs, which can absorb UV light to diminish the damage,40 instead of the protection function of cell-modification. This result further highlights that the photo-bioanode fabricated using photo-responsive material-modified exoelectrogens can withstand front lighting, which would lead to a fascinating application vision of cell-surface modification technology in photo-assisted MFCs.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a LbL self-assembled E. coli by alternatively coating Au and CdS NPs onto the cell surface for the fabrication of photo-bioanodes in MFCs. The presence of Au layers can tune the surface charges of bacterial cells to guarantee the modification of CdS NP layers. Meanwhile, the Au NP terminating layer can serve as the pathway for the transfer of bioelectrons and photoelectrons. As a result, the MFCs with E. coli@Au2@CdS1 exhibited a 1.9-fold and 2.5-fold increase in the power output compared to those of the MFC with native E. coli in the dark and under light illumination, respectively. Moreover, the viability assay revealed that the CdS NP-modification could diminish cell damage during the illumination of the MFC. On the other hand, the photo-bioanode with E. coli@Au3@CdS2 and E. coli@Au2@CdS1 possessed a similar photocurrent under light illumination, probably due to the fact that the inner CdS NP layer was inaccessible to light. The presented work builds an avenue to use exoelectrogens modified by photo-responsive materials for photo-assisted MFCs, which would provide valuable information for the future investigation of cell-surface modification technology in photo-assisted biological energy areas.
