    , Accepted 1st April 2019First published on 2nd April 2019AbstractLuminescent materials such as Cd-based quantum dots, CuInS2 quantum dots, and perovskite-based materials play an important role as an exceptional class of optoelectronic materials due to their unique and novel characteristics for optoelectronic applications. However, a key challenge for luminescent materials and devices is their poor long-term stability, which is typically attributed to the irreversible changes of surface ligands or chemical structure against oxygen and moisture when exposed to ambient atmosphere. Thus, this review mainly focuses on recent important work on the stability-enhanced strategies of luminescent materials. Various strategies for their fabrication, including surface engineering and surface coating routes have been summarized, followed by their advantages and challenges. Furthermore, the corresponding optoelectronic applications of these promising stability-enhanced luminescent materials in light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, solid-state lighting chips, and solar cells were also reviewed. Afterward, the outlook and perspective are presented.
1. Introduction
Luminescent materials such as Cd-based quantum dots, CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs), and perovskite-based materials have received increasing attention mainly due to their broad optoelectronic applications, including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), field-effect transistors, photo-detectors and solar cells.1–12 However, the poor resistance of these luminescent materials against oxygen, moisture, temperature or UV light results in fast performance degeneration and finally restricts their practical application. Particularly, perovskite-based materials with ionic structures are very sensitive to an ambient environment, polar solvents and even decompose in the presence of water.10,13–19 In recent years, many efforts have been made to solve or relieve their stability issues via surface engineering and surface coating approaches. However, as an effective stability-enhanced route, there are several issues that should be considered: (a) the maintenance of luminescent performance after posttreatment; (b) the phase separation of luminescent materials when dispersed into protective layer materials; (c) the transparency of luminescent materials/protective layer composites restricting light-emitting applications; (d) thermal conductivities and protection from the external environment of the protective material; (e) the balance between charge transport properties of the materials for practical application and the stability of passivation; and (f) processing compatibility, difficulty in large-scale production and expensive cost of the encapsulation processes. The chemical and optical stability of stability-enhanced luminescent materials is usually measured in designed harsh conditions, for example, immersion in water, high temperatures, continuous UV illumination or exposure to ambient conditions for a long time.
In this review, various fabrication techniques to enhance the stability of luminescent materials were discussed in detail. Afterwards, the applications of these stability-enhanced luminescent materials were further discussed, including white light-emitting diodes (WLED), photodetectors, field-effect transistors and solar cells. Finally, the outlook for stability-enhanced strategy development trends was presented.
2. Fabrications
2.1 Surface engineering
QDs have a large surface-area-to-volume ratio, and most atoms located on the surface would consist of many dangling bonds. Moreover, the loss of ligands on the QD surface causes an increase in defects during the purification treatment or device fabrication. The surface defects of QDs are generally to be passivated by surface engineering routes such as epitaxial shell growth or surface ligand engineering.

2.1.1 Epitaxial shell growth. 
Epitaxial shell growth is one of the typical routes towards improving the stability of quantum dots against oxygen and water, such as CdSe/ZnS,20 CdSe/ZnSe/ZnS,21 and CdSe/CdS/ZnS (Fig. 1a).21 The matching of the energy-level alignment, crystal structure and the lattice constant between the core and shell are a key factor in avoiding lattice strain at the interface.1 To reduce core–shell interface strain, the grade shell structure was introduced, such as CdSe/Cd1−xZnxSe1−ySy (Fig. 1b).22 Shell thickness is another important factor. Lim et al. achieved a high-performance light-emitting diode with an EQE of over 7% and a luminance of 105870 cd m−2 by optimizing the shell thickness of quantum dots.23 These high-band-gap inorganic shells not only decreased the defects of the quantum dots surface to maintain the stability of the core but also confine carriers to the core portion. However, there is still no efficient way to grow a semiconductor shell to form exquisite core/shell perovskite quantum dots due to their ionic nature and fast anion exchange effect. Synthesis strategies of perovskite quantum dots core/shell nanocrystals (NCs) by encapsulated methods will be further discussed in Section 2.2.5.

2.1.2 Surface ligand engineering. 
The quantum dots are typically synthesized covered with surface ligands to prohibit the formation of dangling bonds on the surface. The bonds between ligands and quantum dots are weak, and the ligands are liable to desorb during the treatment of proton solvent and purification. Emre Yassitepe proposed that the proton transfer between oleic acid and oleylamine surface capping agents would lead to ligand loss.24 They used quaternary alkylammonium halides as the precursor to eliminate the need for oleylamine and finally enhanced the stability of perovskite quantum dots during purification with excess organic content removed. The balance between the transportation of carriers and effective surface passivation is an important issue. Peng's group reported high-performance CdSe/CdS QDs LED based on ligand-exchange. They used 1-dodecanethiol to replace the oleate ligands and achieved a device with an EQE over 20.5% and a long operational lifetime of over 100000 hours at 100 cd m−2.25 Haibo Zeng's groups introduced another route by the modified purification method (Fig. 2).26 They used a hexane/ethyl acetate mixed solvent to control the ligand density of the QD surface after the recyclable purification treatment. By studying the influence of such a purification treatment on the optical and electrical properties systematically, they finally optimized the recyclable times of purification. The QD-LEDs they fabricated exhibited 50-fold EQE improvement compared to that of QDs treated with acetone. Surface ligand engineering is essential to achieve high performance. However, the surface ligands could still be easily removed; this causes the QDs to aggregate feasibly to form bulk particles and even decompose, leading to the failure of device performance under environmental effects such as high temperatures or UV light.

2.2 Surface coating
To improve the stability of luminescent material-based devices against oxygen, moisture, temperature or UV light, surface coating serves as one of the most effective approaches. Coating with a passivation layer is possibly one of the most direct ways to insulate luminescent materials from an external environment. However, the balance between material stability and processing compatibility during device fabrication as one of the most important issues that influences the performance of the materials and devices will also be discussed in the following sections.

2.2.1 Embedding in polymeric matrices. 
Among the capsulation methods that do not need expensive vacuum equipment, embedding the luminescent materials into the organic matrix has been one of the most popular techniques to obtain stable QDs film. Fully dispersing luminescent materials into polymeric matrices is one key step in this method because slight aggregation or phase separation will bring about poor photoluminescence properties. Another key point to note is to prepare encapsulated composites with high transparency for photoelectronic applications. In 2014, Min et al. proposed the method of embedding QDs into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel to prepare bulk nanocomposites.27 Owing to the hydrophilic nature of the PVA hydrogel from the hydroxyl group, water-soluble QDs can be well incorporated into the PVA hydrogel and prevent the aggregation that easily induced scattering effects.27 However, the well-known ligand exchange is not appropriate for perovskite-based materials due to their unstable ionic structure nature. In 2016, poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMA) was applied to perovskite NCs by Michaela et al. due to its good encapsulation of oleic or oleylamine-coated inorganic NCs. The encapsulated CsPbX3 NCs were synthesized in the presence of PMA and achieved an increased QY and optical stability under illumination under ambient conditions.28 Besides, a variety of polymers such as PMMA, CPB, PVP have been discussed in detail in recent publications, see Table 1. However, most reports mentioned above exhibited low PLQY or unsatisfactory protection, which was mainly due to serious phase separation or poor interface interaction between the nanoparticles and the polymeric matrix. Yana et al. developed a swelling–deswelling microencapsulation process to in situ grow high-PLQY perovskite NCs with great dispersion within polymeric matrices (Fig. 3a).29 When in contact with good solvents, the polymer chain will swell and expand, which results in the mutual penetration of solvents and solutes. The deswelling process occurs reversibly when the solvent evaporated. Interestingly, the stability properties of the perovskite–polymer composite films were different widely for different polymers such as polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), cellulose acetate (CA), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), etc. (Fig. 4). Most perovskite–polymer composite films exhibited unprecedented stability against water and heat except for perovskite–PMMA, which degraded within an hour. Particularly, the perovskite–PS and perovskite–PC exhibited extraordinary thermal and water resistance stability. Even after continuous heat treatment at 100 °C, which is near the PS transition temperature (Tg), the perovskite–PS still maintained brightness for the first hour. However, when heated higher than polymer Tg, luminescence decay occurred quickly, indicating that the stability properties of these perovskite–polymer composites were mainly attributed to the protection and encapsulation of the polymer substrates.

Such a swelling–deswelling mechanism was also explained by Melanie et al. in 2005.36 They compared two preparation processes: swelling PS microgel particles in a solvent mixed with QDs and the direct polymerization of styrene droplets containing dispersed PS microgel particles. The results showed that the swelling–deswelling processes would result in the good distribution of QDs over all of the PS particles, while the aggregation occurred in direct polymerization processes. Generally, it is difficult to avoid the aggregation and phase separation of luminescent materials in direct polymerization even within mixed solvents. Qingchao et al. successfully developed an in situ fabrication strategy to prepare MAPbX3 NCs embedded in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) by separating the crystallization processes of PVDF and MAPbX3 in terms of their good solubility in common solvents (Fig. 3b).30 The fabrication processes involved three stages: (Stage I) the MAPbX3 precursor was mixed with PVDF in DMF solvent; (Stage II) the fabricated film was placed in a vacuum oven to accelerate the evaporation of DMF solvent under vacuum pumping, causing the film to become colorless; and (Stage III) the residual DMF was removed, and the film gradually turned green. The as-fabricated film possessed good optical properties with excellent transparency and a uniform distribution of perovskite NCs. Moreover, after even 400 h UV irradiation or immersion in water for 400 h, the composite film still exhibited high stability. It was noted that many key factors greatly differed from the typical method mentioned above including the strong interactions between the perovskite particles and the PVDF–CF2-groups, the common solvent of the precursor and the quick evaporation of the solvent helping to achieve homogeneously dispersed composites with good optical properties and good encapsulation ability. Inspired by this approach, our group reported one simple method to fabricate ultra-stable core–shell CdxZn1−xSeyS1−y QDs/PVDF composite films (Fig. 3c).31 To adjust the solubility of CdxZn1−xSeyS1−y QDs and PVDF in DMF solvent, chloroform was added to DMF to stabilize the mixture precursor. Finally, the uniform CdxZn1−xSeyS1−y QDs/PVDF composite films were achieved with fabrication processes similar to Qingchao's work except for their luminescent property with different fluorescence wavelengths. The thermal and water stability of the as-fabricated composite film were tested and obtained (Fig. 5). Even after heating in boiling water for more than 60 min, the film still kept good brightness under UV irradiation, and the intensity of PL experienced little degradation after 80000 minutes under ambient conditions. Due to the good stretchability of the PVDF materials, Wen-Gao et al. proposed a simple method to fabricate wire-aligned perovskite/PVDF composite films along the stretching direction (Fig. 3d).32 The aligned perovskite NCs were formed possibly owing to the migration of precursors or nanoparticle formation during the stretching process. Another interesting in situ route via supersaturate recrystallization processes was proposed by Yang et al. (Fig. 3e).33 The key points to their fabrication processes are that CsPbBr3 QDs can be synthesized via supersaturate recrystallization, and additionally, ethylene vinylacetate (EVA) is soluble in toluene. A DMF solution of PbBr2, CsBr and ligands, owing to their compatible properties, was added to the ethylene EVA–toluene system. Because toluene is a poor solvent for CsPbBr3 QDs, the CsPbBr3 QDs were recrystallized in the EVA–toluene system. Yumeng et al. developed a universal strategy that integrated the formation of perovskite crystals and the matrix in a one-pot reaction.34 Moreover, no organic solvent was required during the preparation process (Fig. 3f).34 A number of strategies mentioned above were attempted to encapsulate the QDs into bulk polymers as luminescent materials/polymer composites and these composites as known could not be dispersed in aqueous solution. In Shuang et al.'s works, MAPbBr3@PS-b-PEO vesicles were allowed to disperse in aqueous solution with hexane as an intermediate solvent (Fig. 3g).35 These vesicles had been stored in water for more than 7 months, and their PLQY had decreased to 33% compared to 43% of their initial value, indicating that the PS-b-PEO vesicle structures effectively offered colloidal stability in aqueous solutions. More previous work is listed in Table 1.

2.2.2 Electro-spinning. 
As mentioned above, the QD encapsulation method embedding the QDs into polymer matrices via the polymerization process is often challenged by the homogeneous distribution of QDs in polymer matrices.54,55 In 2005, Xiaofeng L. et al. first reported the well-dispersed PbS nanoparticles in polymer fiber matrices fabricated by the electrospinning method.55 Their group prepared PVP/lead acetate in an ethanol/water solution as a precursor at first, and then, the PVP/lead acetate fibers reacted with H2S gas to obtain PVP/PbS fibers in situ, as depicted in Fig. 6a. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the PVP/PbS fibers show that the indicated PbS nanoparticles are well dispersed in the PVP matrices. Further investigation was demonstrated by Min Jie Liu to explore the mechanism that caused QDs to maintain a uniform distribution in the PVA matrix instead of aggregation and phase separation with PVA.54 They compared the formation process of electrospun nanofibers and cast film with the same precursor. The fluorescence spectra of the cast film were tested, showing the aggregation of CdTe QDs that appeared as the solvent evaporated, which led to the red shift of the emission peak. In addition, the DSC results indicated that the rapid solidification of polymer chains helped the QDs obtain a looser aggregation structure. Therefore, they concluded that the large specific surface area of nanofibers and fast evaporation of that solvents finally resulted in the formation of uniformly dispersed PbS QDs/PVP fibers that were also applied to other various QDs/polymer fibers.54 To identify the encapsulation quality of polymer fibers for luminescent materials, their water and heat resistance were further tested.56–59 Yuanwei et al. prepared CsPbBr3 QDs/PS fibers with extraordinary stability in aqueous solution and in ethanol, while it was known that the perovskite QDs could only maintain stability in very few weak polar solvents.57 After immersion in water for 10 days, the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of the CsPbBr3 QDs/PS fibers still remained nearly 100%. Moreover, these polymer fibers had good heat conductivity compared to the traditional polymer bulk film, promoting the heat dissipation of luminescent materials to avoid the temperature quenching of their photoluminescence.56 Particularly, the PLQY of CsPbBr3 NCs/PS fibers maintained over 50% of its original value after being heated at 80 °C for 2 hours and over 70% after 192 hours of water immersion.58 Recently, a new in situ preparation method of perovskite/polymer fibers was proposed instead of the processes where perovskite NCs were synthesized first and then dispersed with polymer precursor.58–61 Junjian et al.60 and Kangzhe et al.61in situ synthesized perovskites/polymer fibers via two-step processes: precursor fibers were firstly synthesized, and then, the perovskite was obtained by simple chemical reactions. In 2018, Ping-chun et al. successfully prepared perovskite NCs/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers via a one-step coaxial electrospun method (Fig. 6c).59 Afterwards, Hao et al. demonstrated a general strategy for preparing in situ CsPbX3 (X = Br, I and Cl) NCs/polymer fibers (Fig. 6d).58 As the solvent evaporated rapidly, the CsPbX3 precursors left and led to the nucleation and growth of CsPbX3.58 Meanwhile, the PS was deswelled with shrinkage and became a uniform coherent layer around the NCs.58 Furthermore, the color of these composite fibers could be tuned by tailoring the composition of lead halide. Additionally, many works focusing on the fabrication of luminescent material/polymer nanofibers were listed in Table 2 and further used in photoluminescence devices.56,58,62–66 For instance, Sung et al.62 proposed the fabrication method of wafer-scale free-standing QD/polymer films (Fig. 6e), Namhun et al.63 developed CuInS2/ZnS QDs/PS fiber-based color conversion films and Varun et al.67 invented electrospun conjugated polymer nanofibers as luminescent layers (Fig. 6f).

As the microfibers and film came into contact, 1D–2D microreactors were built at the interface between the fibers and the film, wherein CsPbBr3 PNCs were generated in situ. Then, the PMMA-encapsulated CsPbBr3 PNC fibers were successfully obtained, exhibiting good PL (see the fluorescence microscope image displayed in the center of the picture) and demonstrated potential application in displays and WLEDs.61 Copyright 2017, Royal Society of Chemistry.

2.2.3 Silica-based material coating. 
Besides hydrocarbon-based polymer capsulation routes, silica-based encapsulation has been intensively studied and utilized in recent years. Generally, silica-based composites include silica shell overcoating individual luminescent materials, embedment into the silica matrix and the silica monolith. Sol–gel polyol silicates and siloxanes had been used in encapsulation in 1998 by Iqbal Gill et al.68 In 2011, Seung-Yeon et al. introduced dye-bridged nanohybrids into a silicone nanohybrid (Fig. 7a). They concluded that this inorganic siloxane component was responsible for the dye-bridged long thermal stability and resulted in less temperature-dependent photoluminescence. Hwea Yoon et al. first reported on the fabrication of a siloxane-encapsulated CdSe/ZnS QDs, and these composites exhibited stability for over 1 month even in boiling water.69 However, conventional SiO2 coating methods were unsuitable for perovskite-based materials, because the presence of water in the precursors led to the quenching of perovskite materials. Thus, Shuqiang et al. used tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) as a precursor with low-water-content toluene solvent and successfully produced SiO2 layers on perovskite QDs, as the minimal water would drive the degradation of the perovskite.70 Chun Sun et al. chose (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) as both the capping agent for CsPbX3 QDs and as the precursor for a silica matrix (Fig. 7b).71 In this process, water in the air drove the hydrolysis of triethoxysilane groups and allowed condensation among silyl ethers and silanols.71 They further explained that the amino group of APTES coordinated on the QD surface was helpful for maintaining high PLQY.71 Besides, Zhichun Li further prepared perovskite QDs incorporated into a silica/alumina in the solid state, namely monolith, via the sol–gel reaction (Fig. 7c).72 To maintain the original optical properties of QDs after condensation reactions, they invented the strategy of ligand exchange with didodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB). These DBATES/DDAB treated CsPbBr3 QDs had greatly enhanced optical properties after the condensation process with a high PLQY of up to 90% and a narrow emission width of 25 nm, even maintaining an emission of ∼90% the initial value after operation for 300 h. Another new type Cd-free CuInS2 QDs was also successfully encapsulated by SiO2 using tetramethylammonium silicate (TMAS) as silica precursors.73 Different from the typical bulk-coated SiO2, Jin et al. developed CsPbBr3@SiO2 nanocomposites with spherical morphology with a high PLQY of 87% and stability for more than 1 month; these composites were used as a solution-processable luminescent ink (Fig. 7d).74 Huicheng Hu et al. produced more interesting CsPbX3/oxide Janus nanoparticles with a PLQY of 80%. They explained that these Janus nanoparticles exhibited enhanced PL stability due to the surface passivation derived from water treatment and silica modification. The stability results of these nanoparticles showed only a 2% drop in PL intensity after continuous irradiation by intense UV light for 10 h as compared with the initial value (Fig. 7e).75 In 2018, Qixuan Zhong et al. reported a facile one-pot approach to synthesizing CsPbX3@SiO2 core–shell nanoparticles. They also investigated this in detail by controlling the formation rates. With the protection of the SiO2 shell, these nanoparticles even maintained long-term stability against the treatment of ultrasonication in water (Fig. 7f).76 More silica-coated methods, such as silica-glass coated with luminescent materials, are summarized in Table 3.

2.2.4 Confinement in mesoporous templates. 
Confinement in porous templates is one of the most popular luminescent material coating routes. So far, the perovskite-based materials have been coated in various porous templates, such as TiO2, AlOx and SiO2.86–88 Generally, perovskite quantum dots cannot be mixed due to the ion exchange. Hung Chia et al. addressed this problem by confining the perovskite quantum dots in mesoporous templates to prevent the anion-exchange effect (Fig. 8a).89 They mixed green perovskite quantum dots-contained mesoporous silica spheres with red perovskite quantum dots and finally achieved perovskite-based LEDs with high thermal- and photostability. Dmitry N. Dirin further represented the template-assisted synthesis for in situ grown perovskite (Fig. 8b).88 They first soaked the mesoporous silica templates in the perovskite precursor followed by drying, leading to the crystallization of the perovskite materials. However, the mesoporous silica templates routes above are limited in the photoelectric applications for they cannot maintain good contact with the conductive electrode of the device. Interestingly, Michael J. Ashley synthesized the oriented perovskite nanowires in anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) templates (Fig. 9).87 They employed a surface-cleaning step to remove residual material of the AAO surface and drew liquid into the pore via capillary and centrifugal forces, and finally, the perovskite nanowires formed at the bottom of pores. Typically, the AAO templates could be synthesized by anodization processes combined with TiO2 and FTO glass, which acted as a hole-blocking material and anode, respectively. Hence, this method provides a new path to produce array photovoltaic devices with high stability. In 2017, Stepan Demchyshyn further used AAO templates as a stability scaffold of the luminescent layer in the light-emitting diode.90 They found that confining perovskite nanocrystals within porous oxide thin films increased the photoluminescence stability for the effective protection of the porous templates. In addition, the size of the as-grown perovskite materials could be designed by controlling the hole size of the porous templates.90 The as-grown perovskite materials via porous templates did not require the use of ligands with the aid of surface chemistries and led to the high stability of materials against moisture, oxygen or heat; however, it may be difficult for the quantum dots materials to fill the pores and maintain good contact with the conductive electrode. Moreover, due to the semi-enclosed structure of these mesoporous templates, part of unprotected luminescent materials would be inevitably exposed to an ambient environment during the solvent evaporation process.

The mesoporous template (e.g., with a characteristic pore width of 2.5, 4.0, or 7 nm) is impregnated with precursor solution, followed by the removal of excess solution and finally the drying-induced crystallization of the APbX3 NCs.88 Copyright 2016, American Chemical Society Publications.

2.2.5 Core–shell structures. 
For traditional QDs materials, one route to passivate their unstable surface and reduce surface defect is to grow an epitaxial shell of a second semiconductor on the luminescent core that formed the core/shell structure, such as CdSe/ZnS core–shell quantum dots.91 From there, various shell materials were reported to obtain stable quantum dots, such as CdSe, CsPbX3, etc. Jyongsik Jang synthesized CdS@PMMA core–shell nanoparticles by dispersion-mediated interfacial polymerization.92 This PMMA shell effectively protected the CdS core from oxygen and moisture. However, the optical performance of this nanoparticle is low. In 2012, Changhua et al. demonstrated a simple method to produce water-soluble CdSe/ZnS QDs-PMAH@SiO2 with a high PLQY of 95%.78 These core–shell nanoparticles almost maintained their PL intensity close to the initial value even after UV irradiation for 600 h, indicating good photostability.78 However, most shells are insulating materials, which restricts charge transport and blocks further use in optoelectronic applications. Therefore, Zhi-Jun et al. introduced the TiO2 shell to produce CsPbBr3/TiO2 with water resistance and the charge separation increased.93 The resulting CsPbBr3/TiO2 core–shell NCs exhibited high stability and kept size, morphology and crystallinity unchanged in water for more than 12 weeks.93 Bo Wang proposed another route to prepare core–shell perovskite NCs through post-synthetically controlled phase transformation and cation exchange Cs+ with Rb+ simultaneously.94 They compared CsPbBr3@Rb4PbBr6 core–shell NCs with typical CdSe/CdS QDs. The test results showed that the as-fabricated NCs maintained a PLQY of over 90% the initial value after 42 h of illumination, while the PLQY of CdSe/CdS shell–core QDs dropped to only 50% after 18 min of illumination under the same conditions. Previous work on encapsulated luminescent films with core/shell architectures are summarized in Table 4.

2.2.6 Atomic layer deposition. 
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a useful method for the encapsulation of nanocrystal films, since their open structure allows the diffusion of gaseous precursors, thus allowing an easy layer-by-layer filling of interstices.97,98 Alexandre Pourret et al. applied ZnO ALD to a CdSe film.98 To improve the infiltration of ZnO, they treated the CdSe film with NH4OH to reduce the infiltration block of long-hydrocarbon-chain ligands. The results showed that the films of CdSe dots that had been treated with NH4OH led to the faster deposition of ZnO. Moreover, it was found that ZnO could help electron transfer between quantum dots. Further understanding of the charge carrier mobility enhanced between QDs and ZnO was also demonstrated by other researchers.99–101 Yao Liu et al. further showed that aluminum and oxygen were distributed throughout the NC layer, meaning that alumina filled the nanoscale void network of PbSe NC according to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) elemental depth profile of the PbSe NC film (shown in Fig. 10a–c).100 They employed the low-temperature ALD method to prepare the PbSe NCs films infilled or merely over-coated with alumina by adjusting the purge time after a water pulse.100 As a result, the ALD infilling of PbSe NCs films was used in field-effect transistors and solar cells with high stability against oxidation.
 Fig. 10  ALD-infilled NC solids as robust and functional granular electronic materials. (a) Conductive NC films made by ligand exchange with short-chain organic molecules are infilled with metal oxides by low-temperature ALD, creating stable inorganic nanocomposites. Organic ligand exchange reduces the inter-NC barrier width, while infilling with an appropriate inorganic material can lower the barrier height and boost carrier mobility. (b) XPS depth profile of a PbSe NC film (330 nm thick film of formic acid treated, 6.1 nm NCs on an ITO substrate) infilled with ALD alumina at 70 °C. The elemental profiles and constant Al:O ratio show that Al2O3 is present throughout the NC film. ALD infilling is a general process that works for many different ligands, NC sizes, and deposition temperatures, including room temperature (supplemental Fig. 2, supporting information). (c) XPS profile of an EDT-treated NC film overcoated (not infilled) with CVD Al2O3 at 70 °C in the same deposition chamber. The core levels plotted are Al 2p, O 1s, Pb 4d5/2, In 3d5/2, and Sn 3d5/2.100 Copyright 2011, American Chemical Society Publications. 
For perovskite quantum dots, their poor compatibility with deposition condition and surface treatments would limit ALD deposition, as mentioned above. In 2017, Anna L. et al. first developed an ALD process for the deposition of AlOx on a CsPbBr3 QD film.102 They employed low temperature and short water pulses to avoid QD degradation and successfully fabricated the assembly of CsPbX3 (X is Br, Cl, I) QD/AlOx inorganic nanocomposites. The QDs were embedded into the alumina matrix, as was clearly shown in the STEM-HAADF image, and the results showed that the QDs kept their size and shape as compared with pristine QDs (shown in Fig. 11). Besides, no significant changes were observed in the composition test and absorption features. The CsPbX3 QD/AlOx nanocomposites kept stable against air and water and even at temperatures of 200 °C, indicating its high stability properties against light, water and heat. However, their PL intensity decreased around 50% compared to the initial value of CsPbX3 QDs. It was believed that the interaction of trimethylaluminum (TMA) with QDs was a key factor in this PL quenching.102 Besides, other QDs/inorganic nanocomposites via ALD processes with different deposition conditions are summarized in Table 5.

2.2.7 Magnetron sputtering. 
It is well known that inorganic metal oxides exhibited better stability than organic materials.105–107 Recently, some groups deposited inorganic metal oxides such as MgZnO and ZnO to improve the stability of perovskite-based devices.106–111 These metal oxide layers with a densely packed structure could not only act as the robust diffusion barrier against moisture under ambient conditions but also isolate the perovskite emissive layer from the metal contact.109 Zhifeng et al. deposited inorganic p-type MgNiO as the carrier injectors. To reduce the effect of the sputtering process on the surface of perovskite, one ultra-thin layer of PMMA was spin-coated at first. The as-fabricated device achieved nearly 80% of the initial efficiency even after 10 h continuous operation, which was greatly superior to that of conventional organic carrier injector-based devices. In 2017, Ye et al. first introduced the ZnO film as a protective layer for inorganic halide perovskite memristors.109 As the results showed, ZnO was the key factor in the improvement of the characteristics of the memristors. ZnO as a protective layer not only reduced the effect of perovskite film roughness and modified the contact of the perovskite film with the electrode but also reduced the charge-carrier injection barrier and power consumption.109 However, likely due to the unstable characteristics of the perovskite, they sputtered at room temperature and deposited the amorphous ZnO.

2.3 Other methods
Various methods for synthesizing stability-enhanced luminescent materials were also reported.112–121
Zhichun Li et al. presented a general self-passivation method by aluminum doping to enhance the stability of core–shell QDs.122 The Al in the CdS shell can be oxidized to Al2O3, which serves as a shield for the CdSe core and effectively stops further degradation during long-term illumination. The results showed that the prepared CdSe/CdS:Al QDs could be kept for 24 h under LED illumination (450 nm, 0.35 W m−2) without significant degradation. Weiwei et al. synthesized CsPbX3/ZnS QD heterodimers with enhanced chemical stability via a solution-phase method, and this was also evidenced by systematic density functional theory-based first-principles calculations.115 Integration with ZnS results in the good charge diffusion of CsPbX3, which is beneficial for photovoltaic applications. Xiaoming developed another route to separate the perovskite QDs, which would then not contact as closely as in the films.116 Yang-Fan et al. developed one simple room-temperature anti-solvent precipitation method to synthesize CsPbBr3 QDs/graphene oxide (GO) composite materials, and those films were fabricated by the centrifugally-cast process.119 As the TEM images showed, the CsPbBr3 QDs were uniformly distributed on the GO sheets. Besides, the introduced GO effectively improved the electron extraction and transportation of CsPbBr3 QDs. Unlike the typical routes, e.g., the embedment of QDs into the matrix, they designed amino-mediated anchoring QDs onto the surfaces of mono-disperse silica, and those silica spheres as scattering media provided a scattering path, which greatly enhanced their photoluminescence (PL) and luminescent stability. Surprisingly, these amino-mediated anchoring QDs could be stored for over 40 days under ambient conditions, even retaining 80% of the initial PL intensity after 108 hours of continuous UV irradiation.
3. Applications
Instability, as one of the most serious issues for the luminescent materials such as Cd-based QDs, Cu-based QDs, perovskite-based materials and so on, greatly limits their reliability in practical applications. Therefore, various methods were discussed above to enhance the stability of these luminescent materials, and these stability-enhanced materials were broadly used in many photoelectronic devices, including light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, solar cells and so on.
3.1 Light-emitting diodes
Surface engineering routes were utilized to improve both the stability and performance of QD-based LEDs. Emre Yassitepe et al. developed an amine-free synthesis process for perovskite QDs, which endows QDs films with low organic content and increased stability.24 Those inverted QD-based red, green and blue LEDs with EQEs of 0.05%, 0.325% and 0.075% were further fabricated, respectively (Fig. 12a). Haibo Zeng's group controlled the ligand density to balance carrier injection and surface passivation and achieved CsPbBr3 quantum dots-based LEDs with an EQE of up to 6.27% (Fig. 12b–d).26 Fanghao Ye et al. synthesized short-chain ligand-anchored CsPbBr3 NCs under an ambient environment at room temperature (Fig. 12e and f).123 They finally fabricated CsPbBr3 NC-based LEDs with a luminance of 5033 cd m−2, an EQE of 5.4% and good thermal stability under ambient conditions. Stepan Demchyshyn et al. proposed a different way to keep perovskite materials stable. They confined perovskite NCs within the AAO thin film that served as the encapsulation scaffold, and the luminescence stability of the as-synthesized perovskite NCs drastically increased.90 The PLQY of these perovskite NCs was up to 90%, while only a 0.03% EQE of the device was achieved and further optimization was needed for this architecture.

3.2 White light-emitting diodes
White light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) are one of the most popular applications for luminescent materials. As seen in Table 6, WLEDs could be synthesized via various methods such as polymerization, silica-coating, electron spinning and so on. Recently, the perovskite-based WLEDs attracted more attention due to their high luminescent performance and effective stability-enhancement strategies. Huicheng et al. combined CsPbBr3/SiO2 Janus NCs-PMMA as a green emissive composite with CdSe-PMMA and put them in a blue-emissive GaN chip to fabricate WLEDs (Fig. 13).75 The CsPbBr3/SiO2 NC-based WLEDs had a color coordinate of (0.3, 0.32) and a color rendering index of 63. To verify the stability of these devices, they tested the time-dependent spectra of CsPbBr3/SiO2 NC-based WLEDs as compared with WT-CsPbBr3 NCs and HI-CsPbBr3 NCs, and the CsPbBr3/SiO2-based WLEDs still kept a white emission.

Our group encompassed CdxZn1−xSeyS1−y/PVDF composites into a UV cure adhesive with a red-emissive phosphor to fabricate the WLED device.31 As Fig. 14 depicted, the test results of CIE were (0.3307, 0.3387), which is close to the standard value. Moreover, we continued to change the current from 20 to 50 mA and found that there was almost no change for the CIE and CCT value, indicating the high drive current-independent stability with potential for further use in optoelectronic applications.

3.3 Photodetectors
One of the challenges for unstable luminescent materials is to enhance stability without sacrificing charge transportation. Most of the stability-enhanced methods used were water and oxygen resistant due to non-conducting materials such as polymers, silica, etc. Zhi-Jun introduced TiO2 as the core–shell protection matrix and fabricated CsPbBr3 @TiO2 photodetectors (Fig. 15).93 As the test results showed, the photoluminescence and electrochemical characterizations exhibited increased charge separation efficiency due to the electrical conductivity of the TiO2 shell and meanwhile enhanced the water-resistance of the device.93 This provided a new path for optoelectronic applications. Besides, ZnO,100,110,124 AlOx99,100 and SnO2121 are also good choices to increase both the stability and conductivity of luminescent materials.

3.4 Solar cells
The stability of the solar cells is critical for utilization in practical applications.1,5,86,100,106,107,120,121,124–126 However, perovskite-based materials such as CsPbI3, as with most popular photovoltaics materials, are unstable and would easily change the cubic perovskite phase under ambient conditions. To solve this problem, Xiangliang et al. reported a route to coat CsPbI3 on PbS QDs.120 After forming the CsPbI3 coating on the PbS QDs, the hysteresis almost disappeared and simultaneously, their photovoltaic characteristics, Von, Jsc and FF greatly improved, as depicted in Fig. 16.120 Moreover, according to the long-term illumination stability results of this device, it showed almost no change in terms of photovoltaic parameters even after 16 h of illumination aging. Another group utilized low-temperature ALD to incorporated pinhole-free Al2O3 and TiO2 into an inverted perovskite solar cell as a protective layer.102 As shown in Fig. 17, the PCE of this encapsulated-device retained 97% of the initial value after 1000 hours under ambient conditions, and there was no significant degradation after immersion in water for 2 hours.

4. Summary and perspective
The poor stability of the luminescent materials against moisture, oxygen and heat limits their reliability in the use of optoelectronic applications. So far, many efforts were made to enhance the stability of the luminescent materials. In this review, recent work on the fabrications and applications of these stability-enhanced luminescent materials fabricated via surface engineering and surface coating routes were summarized. One surface engineering strategy is to decrease the surface defects via epitaxial shells growth. The high-band-gap inorganic material shells are typically used to improve the stability of QDs, such as ZnS and CdS. These shell–core structures not only decrease the defects of the QDs surface to maintain the stability of core but also confine carriers to the core part. However, it is difficult for perovskite QDs to grow a semiconductor shell to form an exquisite core–shell structure due to their unstable ionic nature. Another surface engineering strategy is to optimize the surface ligands of QDs. The balance between the transportation of carriers and effective ligands passivation is an important issue. However, the surface engineering strategies above are still unable to meet the requirement of photoelectric devices under environmental conditions, such as moisture, high temperature or UV light. Coating with passivation layers is a direct way to protect luminescent materials from environmental damage. An important challenge for the fabrication of luminescent materials/passivation layer composites is maintaining their original optical properties after sol–gel processes or physical deposition. Controlling the water content of the precursor and solvent is one of the most effective paths to avoid the quenching of luminescent materials. Another strategy is to create a strong interface interaction between the luminescent materials and protective materials via ligand exchange treatment or introducing functional groups such as an amino group for the better dispersion of their composites. To reduce the effect of the sputtering process on the surface of the luminescent materials, an ultra-thin PMMA would first be spin-coated.
To date, most reports focus on embedding the luminescent materials into polymeric or silica matrices to isolate them from moisture and oxygen due to simple construction, low cost and easy large-scale production. Most luminescent materials/polymer composites possess a low PLQY due to their aggregation, low heat of conductivity or phase separation. Haizheng Zhong groups introduced MAPbX3/PVDF and achieved a high PLQY of 94.6% and long-term stability, but the DMF polar solvent they utilized was harmful to other QDs, which limited its use to an extent. Besides, Haibo Zeng groups provided a different path to achieve illumination stability materials. Embedding perovskite quantum dots into silica spheres exerted positive effects similar to those in polymeric matrices. In fact, the architecture of the composite would greatly affect various characteristics of luminescent materials/polymer composites including the degradation of light extraction efficiency and low thermal conductivity. The composites produced by electron spin coating have good thermal conductivity and well-dispersed properties, but the practical fabrication process is greatly limited by the precursor properties such as solubility and viscosity. Other methods, such as microencapsulation by an organic material shell or GO, are limited by complex processes, uniformity and large-scale production. However, these passivation materials are usually insulators, which limit their further use in optoelectronic applications to a large extent. Some groups proposed different strategies using metal oxide materials such as TiO2, ZnO or AlOx as a protective layer to both increase the stability and charge transportation of unstable luminescent materials. Michael J. Ashley provided a new way to balance the performance and long-term stability of luminescent nanomaterials. They synthesized the oriented perovskite nanowires in AAO templates and Stepan Demchyshyn further used them in LEDs with high stability. In this respect, little research has been done, and there are still more efforts that are required for more material choices. Seeking both well-encapsulated and good charge transport materials is also essential for application in the development of optoelectronics.
It is important to note that only stability-enhanced strategies were reviewed here, but investigations on the properties of intrinsic luminescent materials are also worth deep discussion. Particularly, more environmentally friendly Pb-free and Cd-free luminescent materials are badly needed in the future. Meanwhile, until now, there have been few fundamental theoretical studies on modeling the protection mechanisms of luminescent materials/polymer composites. Many present works on luminescent encapsulation are mainly based on simple experimental results. Systematic theoretical investigation for stability-enhanced luminescent materials is greatly needed for the better design for stability-enhanced materials.

 	Fig. 10  ALD-infilled NC solids as robust and functional granular electronic materials. (a) Conductive NC films made by ligand exchange with short-chain organic molecules are infilled with metal oxides by low-temperature ALD, creating stable inorganic nanocomposites. Organic ligand exchange reduces the inter-NC barrier width, while infilling with an appropriate inorganic material can lower the barrier height and boost carrier mobility. (b) XPS depth profile of a PbSe NC film (330 nm thick film of formic acid treated, 6.1 nm NCs on an ITO substrate) infilled with ALD alumina at 70 °C. The elemental profiles and constant Al:O ratio show that Al2O3 is present throughout the NC film. ALD infilling is a general process that works for many different ligands, NC sizes, and deposition temperatures, including room temperature (supplemental Fig. 2, supporting information). (c) XPS profile of an EDT-treated NC film overcoated (not infilled) with CVD Al2O3 at 70 °C in the same deposition chamber.
