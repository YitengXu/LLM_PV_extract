Broader context
The well-defined metal–semiconductor hybrid micro-/nano-structured Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres, with controllable sizes and shell thicknesses, are easily synthesized by the hydrothermal method. When Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres are used as the photoanodes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a power conversion efficiency of 8.13% is achieved, which exhibits a 30% increase compared with the conventional DSSCs fabricated with P25 TiO2 photoanodes. The strategy adopted in this work is expected to be broadly employed for fabrication of many types of advanced materials with the varying composite structures, which may have more efficient and practical applications in the fields of energy and environment.

With the growing requirements in global renewable energy, new generation of solar cell technologies have been attracting much attention. Among those, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have great potential to be broadly used in our daily life due to their unique advantages, e.g., high energy conversion efficiency and inexpensive production cost. Since first being introduced by Grätzel and coworkers in 1991, intensive research on DSSCs has been focused on achieving higher device efficiency and better performance by (1) screening new dye sensitizers for absorbing a wider range of light,1 (2) searching novel hole scavengers for facilitating photogenerated charge separation,2–5 or (3) rationalizing the construction of the photoelectrodes to either enhance light scattering6–15 or speed up electron transfer.16–18
As a comparison of the above three routes to improve the DSSC performance, routes (1) and (2) generally need tedious trials to explore the potentially useful materials, whereas route (3) is relatively simple and straightforward so that it is viewed as one of the most efficient ways. For example, recent studies confirm that simple alternation of the photoanode materials' shapes from nanosized particles to spherical aggregates, hollow spheres, core–shell particles or hierarchy structures can dramatically improve the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs due to the increased surface areas to adsorb dye molecules and relatively large sizes for scattering incident light.19–22
Except for enhancing light harvesting, an alternative way that receives less attention is to reduce the recombination of photogenerated charges by changing the photoanode materials from a single type of semiconductor metal oxide (normally is TiO2 or ZnO) to composites. For instance, if Au nanoparticles doped with the metal oxide nanoparticles are used for the photoanodes, a Schottky barrier can be formed in the interfacial region of Au and semiconductor.23 When an electron in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the dye tunnels to the conduction band of the semiconductor via the Au nanoparticle, it is unlikely to go back to either the dye or the electrolyte due to the presence of the Schottky barrier.
However, until now, few studies have been reported to considerably improve the performance of DSSCs by using composites.24 One of the important causes is absence of structural control over such composites. As an example, simple deposition of Au nanoparticles on the surface of semiconductors are usually unstable under reaction conditions, and they tend to migrate and aggregate into larger particles, leading to the loss of the unique properties of the original nanoparticles.25 This is particularly true for the case of gold nanoparticles dispersed on TiO2 substrate, a composite of great interest because of its synergistic effect in the promotion of oxidation26,27 and photochemical reactions.28
Herein we report facile synthesis of Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with well-defined hollow structures by controllably hydrolyzing TiF4 in Au nanoparticle solution under hydrothermal condition. The Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres were synthesized following the seminal work done by Zeng's group29 with some modifications. An important improvement is to use the water–ethanol system rather than pure water as the reaction medium (Experimental Section in ESI†). In our system, the well-defined hollow submicrospheres are easily obtained in the presence of ethanol (Fig. S1†). A plausible explanation is that ethanol can accelerate both the formation process of amorphous Au@TiO2 solid microspheres and the subsequent Ostwald ripening process, resulting in production of Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres (below Fig. 3). Meanwhile, both the size and the shell thickness could be easily adjusted by changing the amount of TiF4 in reaction mixture (Scheme 1a). Notably, when these Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres were used as the working electrodes for DSSCs, an obvious improvement in conversion efficiency is achieved compared to those solar cells based on TiO2 hollow spheres or TiO2 nanoparticles. We also notice that the previous DSSCs with Au–P25 composite materials30 and Au–TiO2 core–shell nanowires31 can achieve an efficiency of 3.3% and 4.53%, respectively. As comparison, in our system, Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres achieve a remarkably higher efficiency of 8.13%. Such a large enhancement should be ascribed to the fact that the sealed Au particles in the TiO2 shells can effectively suppress both back electron transfer and energy transfer from dye to Au particles.32

Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres are easily synthesized by heating the mixture of Ti precursors and Au nanoparticles at 180 °C for 6 h under the hydrothermal condition. The selection of the hydrothermal method is based on the consideration that this method is green, simple and cheap, and can produce the materials in a large quantity. These advantages are critical for realization of practical applications of advanced materials. The morphology and structure of as-prepared Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres are explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1). Several important features can be distinguished: (1) All the products are roughly spherical in shape, have rather uniform sizes (the size distributions are less than 13%), and show clearly hollow core–shell structures (Fig. 1d–1f). (2) By changing the added amount of TiF4 precursors, both the sizes of submicrospheres and the shell thicknesses can be tuned. For example, when 2.0 mL of TiF4 solution (40 mM) is mixed with Au nanoparticles, the average diameter of the prepared Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres is around 500 nm and the shell thickness is about 150 nm (Fig. 1d). We name this product as the Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thick shells. When the amounts of TiF4 solution are decreased to 1.0 mL, the geometrical features of the products are changed to a size of ∼250 nm and thickness of ∼50 nm (Fig. 1e), which we call the Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with medium-thickness shells. Further decrease of the added amount of TiF4 solution to 0.5 mL gives rise to products with a size of ∼200 nm and thickness of ∼25 nm (Fig. 1f), which are named Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thin shells. (3) The number and size of Au cores can also be manipulated by altering the amount of TiF4 precursors added. Multiple Au nanoparticles with mean size of 10 nm are observed in the cores of the Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thick shells (Fig. 1d and Fig. S2†). When the added amount of TiF4 precursors are gradually decreased, the numbers of Au nanoparticles in the cores are continuously decreased and the corresponding sizes are increased, eventually leading to formation of a single Au nanoparticle with a size of ∼20 nm in the core (Fig. 1f). (4) Elemental mapping from high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging reveals that the submicrospheres have hollow structures with Au cores and TiO2 shells (Fig. 1h). (5) The spacings between the adjacent lattice fringes measured in high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image are 0.235 nm in the core and 0.355 nm in the shell (Fig. 1g), pointing to the (111) planes of face-centered cubic Au and the (101) planes of anatase-type TiO2, respectively. The HRTEM image also indicates that both Au cores and TiO2 shells are polycrystalline.

The crystal structures of the submicrospheres are further discerned by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 2). There are two series of peaks, which are respectively attributed to face-centered cubic Au (blue dots) and anatase-type TiO2 (black triangles), to be found for all three types of core–shell hollow spheres. It is also observed that the peak intensity of TiO2 phase becomes smaller with decreasing the amount of TiF4. This is reasonable because more TiF4 precursors could lead to products with relatively high crystallinity under hydrothermal condition.

How does the mixture of Ti precursors and Au nanoparticles evolve into the core–shell hollow submicrospheres? In order to answer this question, the intermediate states of Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thin shell are monitored by both TEM images and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 3). After 3 min at 180 °C under hydrothermal condition, solid submicrospheres with the embedded Au nanoparticles are obtained (Fig. 3a), and moreover the dispersive diffraction rings in SAED patterns (insert in Fig. 3a) suggest the amorphous nature of the submicrospheres (the pattern of crystalline Au nanoparticles cannot be distinguished because of the low content). Both TEM and SAED observations are consistent with the well-known fact that Ti precursors are easily hydrolyzed into amorphous TiO2 in the water/ethanol solution, and such hydrolysis products are prone to adopt the spherical shapes due to minimization of surface energy. In the subsequent heating process, the amorphous centers are gradually dissolved, meanwhile the edges of the submicrospheres transform into polycrystalline structures, resulting in formation of hollow spheres (Fig. 3b–d). This evolution process follows a typical Ostwald ripening process, in which the amorphous cores have high free energy and will change into the crystalline shells via dissolution and crystallization. A similar growth mechanism has been explored in the formation of various types of hollow micro-/nano-structures.33–36 Except for TiO2, the embedded Au nanoparticles in the submicrospheres also experience obvious change. At the early stage of the hydrothermal reaction, Au nanoparticles are highly dispersed in the amorphous TiO2 matrix while keeping the original sizes of ∼ 5 nm (white circles in Fig. 3a and Fig. S3†). With the reaction proceeding and the hollow structure forming, small Au nanoparticles migrate and aggregate into a big Au nanoparticle in the cavity, leading to formation of a core–shell structure (Fig. 3b–3d). Such self-aggregation, similar to a phase-separation process, is energy favorable so that it can spontaneously happen. When the amount of Ti precursors is increased, the sizes of the prepared TiO2 hollow submicrospheres increase (Fig. 1a). Since the amount of Au nanoparticles in the reactants is fixed, the density of Au nanoparticles should be low inside the large TiO2 submicrospheres. Thus, the possibility of Au nanoparticle aggregation is low at the same reaction condition, and this is why there are multiple Au nanoparticles of small sizes in the Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thick shells (Fig. 1d and Fig. S2†).
 Fig. 3  TEM images and SAED patterns (inset) of Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thin shell at different crystallization times: (a) 3 min, (b) 9 min, (c) 1 h and (d) 6 h. 
Since the reaction appears to be very fast (Fig. 3), another interesting question arises: Can such core–shell microspheres be still obtained with a shorter time or lower temperature, for instance, even at room temperature? When the crystallization time is further shortened to 1 min or 2 min at 180 °C, the morphologies of the intermediate products are quite similar to those obtained at 3 min (Fig. S4†), confirming the extremely quick formation of Au@TiO2 composite submicrospheres. When the crystallization temperatures are gradually increased from room temperature to 180 °C, the morphologies of the products experience dramatic change. The morphologies of TiO2 products prepared at room temperature are not uniform because low reaction temperature is not favourable for hydrolysis of Ti source (Fig. S5†). When the crystallization temperatures are set in the range of 50 °C to 100 °C (Fig. S6a–d†), no hollow structures appear in the final products. The products of the hollow structures are only achieved when the crystallization temperatures are in the range of 120 °C to 180 °C (Fig. S6e–h†). The possible cause is that high temperature is helpful for dissolution of amorphous centers and acceleration of the Ostwald ripening process, leading to formation of hollow submicrospheres.
Recently, Wong et al.37 synthesized the multi-shelled Au@SiO2 yolk–shell spheres by using selective etching in hot water. We wonder what would happen if the Au@TiO2 nanoparticles are used as seeds to mediate the TiO2 continuous growth. When the Au@TiO2 submicrospheres are used as the seeds (Fig. S7a†) and Ti source is added for the second growth, Au@TiO2 submicrospheres with double shells can be further prepared (Fig. S7b†). TEM images also reveal that the Au nanoparticles are coated by the first layer of TiO2 shells, and there is a cavity between the first and second layer of TiO2 shells (Fig. S7c†).
The performance of the as-prepared Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres is examined as the photoanodes of DSSCs. In order to highlight the structural advantages of the prepared Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres, TiO2 hollow submicrospheres of different thicknesses are synthesized in absence of Au nanoparticles (Fig. S8†). Meanwhile commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa) are also selected as the photoanodes. To standardize the comparison of energy conversion efficiency, the DSSC devices are fabricated with the classic dye sensitizer N719 and iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox electrolyte, and all the thicknesses of different types of TiO2 photoanodes are controlled to be 7.0 μm.
The DSSC devices are characterized by measuring the current density–voltage behavior using a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.20 cm2 under standard AM 1.5 simulated sunlight (power density of 1000 W m−2). Fig. 4 shows the typical curves of current density versus voltage for P25 (curve a), TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thin shell (curve b), and Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thin shell (curve c). Compared to the P25 electrode with an energy conversion efficiency of 6.25% (Table 1), the electrode made of TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thin shell has the obvious increased efficiency of 7.06% (Table 1), which mainly originates from the increase in the short-circuit current density from 13.6 mA cm−2 (curve a in Fig. 4) to 15.7 mA cm−2 (curve b in Fig. 4). Such an increase of energy conversion efficiency mostly results from enhancement of light scattering and absorption by using hollow micro-/nano-structures, which has been disclosed in a recent report.38 More impressively, when Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thin shell are used as the working electrode, we achieve a remarkably high current density of 22.1 mA cm−2 (curve c in Fig. 4) and a fairly large conversion efficiency of 8.13% (Table 1). With respect to TiO2 hollow submicrospheres, there is about a 41% increase in the short-circuit current density, 15% enhancement in the conversion efficiency, and slight decrease in the open circuit voltage (from 0.72 V to 0.63 V). Compared to P25 electrode, the conversion efficiency of the electrode made of Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thin shell is greatly increased by 30%.

For hollow TiO2 submicrospheres and Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres, the significant difference in both current density-voltage characteristics and the conversion efficiency are likely attributed to the following reasons: (1) The open-circuit voltage is in proportion to the difference between the Fermi level and the Nernst potential of the I−/I3− redox;39 (2) a Schottky barrier is formed at the metal Au and semiconductor TiO2 interface;23 (3) Au cores in the submicrospheres further increase the light absorption due to strong surface plasmon resonances (SPR);40 (4) the Au portion in the submicrospheres facilitates the conductivity of the electrolyte. Here, we individually discuss the effect of each factor on the performance of DSSCs.
Firstly, the Fermi level corresponding to the Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres is created because the electrons in this submicrosphere are moved to attain a stable balance (Scheme 1b). Compared to pure TiO2, the gap between the Fermi level of Au@TiO2 and the Nernst potential of the I−/I3− redox is smaller, leading to slight decrease of the open circuit voltage (Table 1). When the sensitizers N719 are under photoexcitation, the electron flows toward the submicrospheres, and therefore the conduction and valence bands of TiO2 particle are bent downward (Fig. S10†). Also, the Fermi level of the Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres moves downward. As a result, the Schottky barrier of the Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres is enhanced, and it can effectively reduce the possibility of electrons going from the semiconductor (such as TiO2) back to either the dye or the electrolyte (Scheme 1b and Fig. S10†). The change in the Schottky barrier should largely contribute to improvement in the short-circuit current density of Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres (Table 1).
In addition to the Schottky barrier, the SPR feature of Au nanoparticles in the composites is also responsible for the increase of short-circuit current density. The diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. S9†) indicates that the hollow submicrosphere architectures dramatically increase the light scattering and adsorption in the visible region compared to P25 TiO2 nanoparticles. Interestingly, Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres could offer additional optical absorption in the region of 500–600 nm. The direct comparison of the absorption characteristics (Fig. 5) clearly confirms an obvious enhancement in the region of 500–600 nm, which matches very well with the SPR characteristic of Au nanoparticles.41

To demonstrate the general advantages of the heterostructures on improvement of DSSC efficiency, Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with different shell thicknesses are examined, and the results are listed in Table 1. It is evident that regardless of the shell thickness, the Au@TiO2 core–shell structures have a great increase in the energy conversion efficiency (15–17%) compared with the corresponding TiO2 hollow submicrospheres.
We also notice that with respect to the thick shell, Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with thin shells have an improvement of 4% on the conversion efficiency. The difference is in agreement with the fact that for the thin TiO2 shells, bulk recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes is restrained.
In conclusion, Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres with controllable sizes and shell thicknesses are easily synthesized by the hydrothermal method. Different to conventional synthesis of hollow core–shell structures that needs hard template technique followed by selective etching,42 our method can prepare a large number of Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres in a short time with dramatic reduction of chemical waste products by taking advantage of the Ostwald ripening process. When Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres are used as the photoanodes of DSSCs, a power conversion efficiency of up to 8.13% is obtained, which exhibits a 30% increase compared with the conventional DSSCs fabricated with P25 TiO2 photoanodes. The strategy adopted in this work is expected to be broadly employed for fabrication of many types of advanced micro-/nano-structures, which may have more efficient and practical applications in the fields of energy and environment.

The well-defined metal–semiconductor hybrid micro-/nano-structured Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres, with controllable sizes and shell thicknesses, are easily synthesized by the hydrothermal method. When Au@TiO2 hollow submicrospheres are used as the photoanodes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a power conversion efficiency of 8.13% is achieved, which exhibits a 30% increase compared with the conventional DSSCs fabricated with P25 TiO2 photoanodes. The strategy adopted in this work is expected to be broadly employed for fabrication of many types of advanced materials with the varying composite structures, which may have more efficient and practical applications in the fields of energy and environment.
