    , Accepted 24th August 2019First published on 26th August 2019AbstractElectrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via oxygen reduction is a two-electron electrochemical process that has promising applications in production. In practical applications, developing high-performance nonprecious metal or metal-free electrocatalysts with cheap and commercially available source materials is challenging. Here, we prepared a high-performance electrocatalyst from commercial mesoporous carbon, CMK3, via microwave treatment for H2O2 production. Only 1 minute was consumed for the conversion of pristine CMK3 to a high-performance electrocatalyst via a microwave treatment and liquid nitrogen freezing process. The catalyst exhibited higher selectivity (∼90%) and current efficiency (∼95%) than pristine CMK3 (∼50% and ∼55%) in alkaline solution. Higher productivity of H2O2 was obtained (2476 mmol gcatalyst h−1 at 0.3 V vs. RHE) than for the catalysts reported before. We investigated the system containing the H2O2 produced in situ for formaldehyde-containing wastewater treatment, and it exhibited high performance for reducing formaldehyde. This process presented a simple, fast and readily scalable approach to change a low-performance carbon material into a high-performance electrocatalyst. This work will be helpful in developing a high-performance electrocatalyst for producing H2O2 and the practical industrial application of reducing O2 to H2O2 by an electrochemical method. It will also help to develop other high-performance electrocatalysts.
1. Introduction
With the development of global chemical industries, the importance of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in environmental renovation and production is increasing because H2O2 is cheap, ecofriendly and essential as an oxidant for producing various chemicals.1–3 At present, the industrial route for synthesizing H2O2 mainly includes an anthraquinone process, which involves the ordered oxidation/reduction of anthraquinone molecules. Although this method can be used in large-scale production, many challenges remain to be addressed, such as separation of organic impurities from large volumes of H2O2, industrial waste treatment, and potential security risks related to the storage and transportation of final products.2 Alternatively, H2O2 can be synthesized directly from hydrogen and oxygen using catalysts. However, this process carries the risk of explosion when mixing hydrogen and oxygen.4,5 Direct conversion of O2 to H2O2via a two-electron electrochemical process has recently become a promising method due to its many advantages, such as mild conditions, ease of operation, and scalable production. However, to produce H2O2, developing high-performance electrocatalysts with high current density, selectivity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a key issue.6–15
Noble metals, such as Pt, Pd, and Au, and their alloys, including Pd–Hg and Ag–Hg, have been explored for H2O2 production because of their high efficiency, low overpotential and great selectivity.16–18 Although these metals have optimal catalytic properties, the global scarcity of noble metals hampers their practical application. Accordingly, developing high-performance, nonprecious metal or metal-free electrocatalysts with cheap and commercially available materials poses a great challenge for practical applications in directly converting O2 to H2O2.6,7,12,19,20
Carbon-based materials have more potential to generate H2O2 through electrochemical processes than noble-metal materials. They are abundant on earth, inexpensive, and more importantly, adjustable and stable during the electrochemical reaction.21,22 In addition, the catalytic performances of carbon materials are associated with their structure and heteroatom doping.11,13,23,24 Very recently, we reported an electrocatalyst (N-, O-, and P-tridoped porous carbon) derived from fungal hyphae and its excellent activity for electrochemical production of H2O2.25
Because of the high surface area and various pore sizes, mesoporous carbon (pore size of 2–50 nm) has extensive applications in many fields. CMK-3 is an ordered mesoporous carbon that can be manufactured on a large scale and has become a commercially available material.26,27 It is meaningful and important to develop an electrocatalyst based on CMK-3 for H2O2 production. Here, we propose a fast and convenient microwave route to change commercial CMK3 (pristine CMK3) to a high-performance electrocatalyst for H2O2 production in only 1 min. The H2O2 produced by the in situ process can be directly used in formaldehyde-containing wastewater treatment, and the system containing the electrocatalyst as a cathode exhibited high-performance formaldehyde removal in alkaline media.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of the typical product (CMK3-20 s) preparation. The electrocatalyst was obtained from pristine CMK3 that was only microwave-treated for 20 seconds and subsequently treated with liquid nitrogen for 40 seconds. The complete process from pristine carbon to an electrocatalyst lasted only 1 minute. In a typical process, 299.6 mg of pristine CMK3 could yield 298.3 mg of electrocatalyst. The process did not need high-temperature treatment, centrifugation operation, or organic solvents. Therefore, this is a simple, fast, effective, environmentally friendly and readily scalable approach. The method is of significance in the preparation of carbon nanomaterials and it may also be used in the preparation of other nanomaterials.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the typical product (CMK3-20 s) preparation. 
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 2a) reveals that pristine CMK3 had a clear and ordered mesoporous structure. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM; Fig. 2b–d) shows that C and O were homogeneously distributed throughout the entire CMK3. Fig. 2e shows that CMK3-20 s has a clear and ordered mesoporous structure, which is the same as pristine CMK3.27 The elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 2f–h) suggests that C and O are homogeneously distributed throughout the entire CMK3-20 s. Fig. S1† shows the Raman spectra of CMK3 and CMK3-20 s, which demonstrate almost no change in the ratio of the D to G bands after the microwave treatment.

The high resolution C1s XPS spectra of all samples (Fig. S2a–d†) reveal that the samples exhibit a strong peak at 284.8 eV (corresponding to graphitic carbon) and three weak peaks belonging to hydrocarbons (C–OH) from defect sites on the graphitic (at 285.8 eV) carbon, which combined with oxygen to form single and double bonds (O–CO) (at 288.7 eV) and the signature of π–π* transition at 290.5 eV.7 The high-resolution O1s spectra of all samples (Fig. 3a–d) indicate that two types of oxygen are doped in the samples. The peak at 531.6 eV corresponds to the double bonded carbon to oxygen (CO), and the peak at 533.2 eV represents the C–O configuration.7,28Fig. 3a–d and Table S1† show an obvious change in the ratio of CO to C–O among the samples after microwave treatment, and the ratio of CO decreased as the microwave time increased. For pristine CMK3 and the typical CMK3-20 s product, the ratios of CO to C–O are 1:2 and 1:3, respectively. Importantly, the XPS data (Table S1†) show that pristine CMK3 has a similar oxygen content (approximately 3%) to the other microwave-treated samples. Microwave treatment can only change the ratio of CO to C–O in the samples but cannot change the oxygen content. In addition, the sample CMK3–N2 was prepared and was treated only with liquid nitrogen for 40 s and without microwave treatment. XPS results of CMK3-20 s–C and CMK3–N2 (Fig. S3†) show that the ratio of CO to C–O is close to 1:2.5 and 1:2, respectively. Only microwave treatment partly changed the ratio of CO to C–O (from 1:2 to 1:2.5). Only liquid nitrogen treatment did not change the ratio of CO to C–O. Fig. 3e and f show pristine CMK3 with a BET surface area of 1009.4 m2 g−1, an average pore size of 4.0 nm and a total pore volume of 1.32 cm3 g−1. Fig. 3g and h show that CMK3-20 s has a BET surface area of 1018.8 m2 g−1, an average pore size of 4.0 nm and a total pore volume of 1.30 cm3 g−1. Fig. 3e–h, S4 and Table S2† show that the microwave-treated samples have similar surface areas and porous structures to pristine CMK3.

From the above results, we proposed a simple, fast, effective and readily scalable approach to change the CO to C–O ratio in pristine CMK3 without changing the oxygen and carbon content. According to previous reports, microwave treatment could have enough energy to break the stable bonds on the surface of carbon materials.29,30 Therefore, we believe that some CO existing in carbon materials could be broken to form C–OH or C–O–C at high temperature and in an inert gas atmosphere during the rapid microwave treatment, changing the ratio of CO to C–O.29 The XPS results of CMK3-20 s–C (Fig. S3a†) and CMK3-20 s (Fig. 3c) show that liquid nitrogen treatment could rapidly cool the carbon material and prevent the produced C–OH or C–O–C from being oxidized by oxygen in air. The XPS results of CMK3–N2 (Fig. S3b†) and CMK3-20 s (Fig. 3c) show that only liquid nitrogen treatment could not change the ratio of CO to C–O.
RRDE measurements were performed to investigate the ORR activities of pristine CMK3, CMK3-10 s, CMK3-10 s and CMK3-30 s for producing H2O2. Fig. 4a shows the RRDE voltammograms for each of these samples in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at room temperature (1600 rpm at 10 mV s−1). For pristine CMK3, CMK3-10 s, CMK3-20 s, and CMK3-30 s, the values of the onset potential (vs. RHE) were nearly the same. Compared with other pristine CMK3, the iring value for catalysts synthesized via microwave treatment increased from 0.045 to 0.076 mA, and the disk current density (jdisk) increased from −2.3 to −3.3 mA cm−1 at 0.3 V. The selectivity of the H2O2 yield in 0.1 M KOH was obtained from the corresponding RRDE polarization curves. Fig. 4b reveals that the selectivity of pristine CMK3 was estimated to be only 47–54% (range 0.25–0.75 V vs. RHE). However, CMK3-20 s had 88–91% selectivity at potentials ranging from 0.25–0.75 V (vs. RHE). Considering overpotential, reduction current and selectivity, CMK3-20 s showed the highest H2O2 production performance compared with the other catalysts. In addition, all microwave-treated samples had higher performances than pristine CMK3. The microwave treatment significantly improved the electrocatalytic performance in alkaline solution. CMK3-20 s–C, which was only microwave-treated for 20 s without liquid-nitrogen treatment, and CMK3–N2, which was only treated with liquid nitrogen for 40 s without microwave treatment were prepared for comparison. Their RRDE results (Fig. 4c and d) reveal that CMK3-20 s–C and CMK3–N2 had lower activities than CMK3-20 s. The process involving both the microwave and liquid-nitrogen treatments is essential to promote the catalytic activity of producing H2O2. We also investigated the ORR activities for producing H2O2 in neutral media. Fig. 4e shows the RRDE voltammograms for the ORR of pristine CMK3 and CMK3-20 s in O2-saturated 0.1 M K2SO4 (1600 rpm at 10 mV s−1) at room temperature. The microwave-treated samples had a higher ring current and disk current density (iring was up to 0.88 mA and jdisk increased from −1.85 to −2.3 mA cm−2 at 0.15 V). Their onset potentials were lower than those of the sample in alkaline solution (decreased from 0.79 V to 0.46 V). Fig. 4f shows the H2O2 selectivity of these catalysts in 0.1 M K2SO4, which slightly improved after treatment (51–75%) ranging from 0.15 V to 0.4 V (vs. RHE). In addition, the RRDE of CMK3-20 s was also measured in acidic media (0.5 M H2SO4). However, the results (Fig. S5†) were not ideal compared with those of the above electrolytes.

The faradaic efficiency and H2O2 productivity for the catalytic activities of CMK3-20 s were investigated in a bulk preparation using a flow-cell and a three-electrode method on a CHI750e electrochemical workstation at room temperature (Fig. 5). The faradaic efficiency and H2O2 productivity of CMK3-20 s were measured (in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH) at 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 V (vs. RHE). Fig. 5a shows that the faradaic efficiency increased with more positive potential (the highest faradaic efficiency was up to 95%), and higher H2O2 productivity was obtained as the potential became more negative (the highest H2O2 productivity of 2476 mmol gcatalyst h−1). According to the previous literature studies and our recent report, CMK3-20 s exhibited superior activity to most of the reported catalysts, including transition-metal-based catalysts and nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts (Table S3†).12,21,24,25,31–36 One potential (0.4 V vs. RHE) was selected to investigate the stability of CMK3-20 s. Fig. 5b shows that CMK3-20 s had superior stability (lasting 8 h) towards electrocatalytically generating H2O2 with a high faradaic efficiency (85–93%). The durability of the ORR electrocatalyst to produce H2O2 is one of the most important issues.8,25,37 Activities of CMK3-20 s were also measured at three potentials (−0.1 V, 0 V and 0.1 V vs. RHE) in neutral solution (0.1 M K2SO4). The results (Fig. 5c) reveal that the faradaic efficiency reached over 78%, and the highest production reached 837 mmol gcatalyst h−1. Therefore, CMK3-20 s exhibited higher activity in alkaline media than in neutral media. The basic solution containing H2O2 may have applications in many fields, including the pulp and paper industries.7,10

To further investigate the catalytic activity of CMK3-20 s, a two-electrode method was employed using a flow-cell in 0.1 M KOH. The faradaic efficiency and productivity of H2O2 are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a displays the polarization curve of the liner sweep voltage (LSV). The first potential generated by H2O2 was 0.6 V, and the current reached −30.1 mA when the potential was 1.8 V. Fig. S6† shows the curves for the current at different cell potentials. Fig. 6b shows the faradaic efficiency and productivity of H2O2, which were 91% and 1281 mmol gcatalyst h−1 at 1.8 V in 0.1 M KOH. The faradaic efficiency and productivity of H2O2 were also measured by a two-electrode method driven through a solar-energy battery in a flow cell. The schematic diagram of the device is shown in Fig. 6c. The results (Fig. 6d) show that high current efficiencies (up to 90.5% and 92%) and production rates (up to 695 mmol gcatalyst h−1 and 829 mmol gcatalyst h−1) of H2O2 were obtained for 30 min when the solar battery voltages were 2.5 V and 3.0 V. Therefore, the system containing CMK3-20 s as the cathode showed promising potential for directly producing H2O2 driven using a solar-energy battery instead of electric power.38,39 CMK3-20 s showed a superior performance to the N-, O-, and P-tridoped nanoporous carbon that we recently reported.25

Formaldehyde is harmful to the environment and human health; therefore, treating industrial wastewater containing formaldehyde is of great importance.40–42 Removal of formaldehyde in alkaline solution using H2O2 is a promising method. We investigated the process of removing formaldehyde using H2O2 produced in situ. The process was similar to that of measuring the H2O2 bulk productivity, but the electrolyte in the cathode contains formaldehyde (14.0 mg L−1). The formaldehyde content was determined via acetylacetone spectrophotometry on a UV-3600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Fig. 7a depicts the schematic diagram of the device. Fig. 7b shows the formaldehyde content and its removal efficiency during different reaction times at 2.4 V (cell potential) in 0.1 M KOH and Fig. 7c shows the absorbance curves of formaldehyde after different reaction times. Fig. 7b and c show that the content of formaldehyde decreased from 14.0 to 0.07 mg L−1 over just 45 min at a cell potential of 2.4 V, and the formaldehyde removal efficiency reached 99.5%, which indicated that this method can markedly decrease the formaldehyde in wastewater. Fig. 7d shows the removal efficiency of formaldehyde (initial concentration of 14.0 mg L−1) at different cell potentials for just 30 min, demonstrating the highest efficiency at 2.7 V (up to 95%). Therefore, the system containing H2O2 produced in situ exhibited high performance for reducing formaldehyde and it may have potential application in formaldehyde-containing wastewater treatment.
Why does CMK3-20 s have a high performance? The results suggest that CMK3-20 s has a similar surface area and porous structure to pristine CMK3. Microwave treatment did not alter the oxygen and carbon content in pristine CMK3, but changed the ratio of CO to C–O. For pristine CMK3 and the typical CMK3-20 s, the CO to C–O ratios were 1:2 and 1:3, respectively. Recent density functional theory (DFT) studies have shown that the excellent H2O2 production activities via the ORR process may be from the doped N or O in the carbon materials, and different N or O played different roles in the catalytic activity.7,43,44 The process of two electron oxygen reduction reactions can be described as following:7O2 + H2O + e− → OOH* + OH−OOH* + e− → HO2−
The binding energies between the intermediates and active sites can determine the activity of carbon materials. The ΔGOOH* represents the activity of different oxygen-containing functional groups (CO and C–O) and the content of these groups could influence the performance of materials.7 When the ratio of CO to C–O became 1:3, the ΔGOOH* may reach the optimal value for catalytic activity. As a result, the electrocatalytic properties of carbon materials have been obviously improved. Therefore, we believe that microwave treatment followed by liquid-nitrogen treatment changed the CO to C–O ratio in the carbon materials, and the optimized ratio led to the excellent performance. Catalysts should have larger surface areas and as many catalytic sites as possible.22,27 Fortunately, the products treated via microwave followed by liquid nitrogen have similar BET surface areas to pristine CMK3, which plays an important role in the excellent performances of the products.
3. Conclusions
We proposed a fast and convenient method to change commercial CMK3 (pristine CMK3) to a high-performance electrocatalyst for H2O2 production via microwave and liquid-nitrogen treatment. The process took only 1 minute. This is a simple, fast and readily scalable approach to turn low-performance carbon materials into high-performance electrocatalyst with high current density, selectivity and stability for H2O2 production. The typical catalyst exhibited higher selectivity (∼91%) and current efficiency (∼95%) than pristine CMK3. The treatment combining microwave and liquid nitrogen changes the ratio of CO to C–O, but does not change the oxygen and carbon content in pristine CMK3. Furthermore, we investigated the system containing H2O2 produced in situ for the formaldehyde-containing wastewater treatment, and it exhibited high performance for reducing formaldehyde. This work is of great value for developing new carbon-based electrocatalysts for producing H2O2 and practical industrial applications for reducing O2.
4. Methods
4.1 Chemicals
K2SO4, C2H5OH, KOH, formaldehyde, acetylacetone, acetic acid, ammonium acetate and cerium sulfate tetrahydrate were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). CMK3 was purchased from XFNANO Corporation (Nanjing, China).
4.2 Preparation of the electrocatalyst
Commercial CMK3 (300 mg) was first placed uniformly in a glass dish, and then placed into a microwave oven (Media M1-L213C, JiangSu, China) and treated for a specific time (10 s, 20 s, or 30 s) at a fixed microwave power (100 watts). The materials were removed immediately and frozen using liquid nitrogen for 40 s. The materials were labelled CMK3, CMK3-10 s, CMK3-20 s and CMK3-30 s. Fig. 1 shows the typical electrocatalyst process.
Additionally, the products CMK3-20 s–C, which was only microwave treated for 20 s without liquid nitrogen, and CMK3–N2, which was only treated with liquid nitrogen for 40 s without microwave treatment were prepared for comparison.
4.3 Characterization
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were acquired using a JEM-2100F field emission transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analytical system. The samples were dispersed in absolute alcohol and then dropped and dried onto copper grids for examination. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected using an ESCALAB MKII X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo VG Scientific Ltd., East Grinstead, Sussex, UK). A Micromeritics ASAP2460 analyzer (USA) was used to analyze the BET surface area and the pore size distribution of all samples. Raman spectra were obtained using an inVia-Reflex spectrometer (Renishaw).
4.4 Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements
The catalyst ink was prepared as follows.22,45,46 For each sample, the powder (10 mg) was dispersed in 2 mL of mixed solvent (1:3 v/v isopropanol/deionized water) with Nafion solution. Next, the mixture was ultrasonicated for 40 min to obtain the catalyst ink. For each measurement, a 10 μL volume of the ink was uniformly deposited onto a glassy carbon ring-disk (Pine Research Instrumentation, Durham, NC, USA) for use as the working electrode. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. The potential has been converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the following equation:E(RHE) = Eθ(Ag/AgCl) + E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.0591 × pHwhere the value of Eθ(Ag/AgCl) is 0.196 V. The ring current (iR) was measured with a Pt-ring electrode separately in both alkaline and neutral media. The Pt-ring electrode was polarized at 1.2 V (vs. RHE) in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M K2SO4 solution.
The selectivity for the H2O2 yield was evaluated using the following equation according to the RRDE voltammogram of each sample:7  where iD is the disk current, iR is the ring current, and N is the current collection efficiency of the Pt ring. N is 0.33 from the reduction of K3Fe[CN]6.25
4.5 Measurements of H2O2 bulk productivity
The catalyst-coated gas diffusion electrode (GDE) was prepared by depositing 150 μL of catalyst ink onto a precut GDE strip (2.0 cm × 2.0 cm) and then immediately dried. The H2O2 productivity of the catalysts was investigated using a three-electrode and two-electrode method on a CHI750e electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Shanghai, China). The experiments were performed in a flow electrochemical cell with two compartments separated using a Nafion 117 membrane. The electrolyte (0.1 M KOH or K2SO4) was placed on the side of the flow cell. The GDE, an IrO2/C electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively.25 Before the measurement, the cathodic compartment of the cell was saturated with high-purity O2 (99.99%) for at least 30 min. O2 was continuously bubbled into the cathodic chamber at 30 mL min−1 during the reduction. All experiments were measured at least three times.
4.6 Determination of the H2O2 concentration
The concentration of H2O2 generated during the electrocatalytic process was measured using ultraviolet colorimetry based on the reaction between the yellow Ce4+ solution and H2O2, where Ce4+ can be reduced to colorless Ce3+. The H2O2 concentration can be calculated based on the reduced Ce4+ amount. The Ce4+ concentration was tested by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry using a UV-3600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Kyoto, Japan).7 Our recent report details this process.23 All experiments were measured at least three times.
4.7 Calculation of the productivity and faradaic efficiency of the produced H2O2
Faradaic efficiency (FE) for the H2O2 production was calculated using the chronoamperometric measurements by determining the charge required to produce the measured product concentration and dividing it by the total charge passed. The productivity of the produced H2O2 was calculated using the hydrogen peroxide concentration produced in a 100 mL solution, the reaction time and the area of the carbon paper supported by the catalyst.
4.8 Formaldehyde removal using the H2O2 produced in situ
The formaldehyde removal process is similar to that of the measurements of H2O2 bulk productivity, but the cathodic electrolyte contained formaldehyde. The formaldehyde content was determined via acetylacetone spectrophotometry on a UV-3600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
