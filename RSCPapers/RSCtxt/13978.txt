    , Accepted 6th June 2012First published on 13th June 2012AbstractA composite counter electrode (CE) made of electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNs) and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles has been demonstrated for the first time to improve the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The new ECN–Pt composite CE exhibited a more efficient electro-catalytic performance with lower charge transfer resistance (Rct), larger surface area, and faster reaction rate than those of conventional Pt. It reduced the overall series resistance (Rse), decreased dark saturation current density (J0) and increased shunt resistance (Rsh) of the DSCs, thereby leading to a higher fill factor (FF) and larger open circuit voltage (Voc). The reduced electron transport resistance (Rs) and faster charge transfer rate in the CE led to a smaller overall cell series resistance (Rse) in the ECN–Pt composite based DSCs. The DSCs based on an ECN–Pt CE achieved a η of ∼8%, which was improved over those of pure Pt or ECN based cells.
1. Introduction
In recent years, photovoltaic (PV) power generation has gained tremendous interest because it can produce clean renewable electricity without noise, greenhouse gases, or other environmental concerns. The PV devices/systems have the flexibility to be set up directly at various locations, such as residential houses and industrial/commercial buildings, thus providing the possibility to avoid transmission losses and the associated expenses. However, owing to high processing and material costs in conventional silicon solar cells, PV power generation has not yet been able to compete with traditional power sources based upon fossil fuels.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) show potential as low-cost alternatives to silicon solar cells due to their lower costs.1,2 A DSC is typically made of a photoanode and counter electrode (CE) with an electrolyte containing an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple filled in between.3 The photoanode is usually a porous film of sintered TiO2 nanoparticles deposited on fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO) sensitized by dye molecules; the CE is generally a Pt-coated FTO glass substrate. When dye molecules are illuminated with sunlight, photoelectrons are produced and then injected from the dye molecules to TiO2, followed by traveling to the CE through an external circuit. Finally, the electrolyte regains electrons from the CE, and the dye molecules recover lost electrons from the electrolyte. The DSCs with the above device structure using an I−/I3− redox electrolyte and Ru-based dyes achieved an energy conversion efficiency of ∼11%;1 recently, the efficiency of DSCs has been further increased to ∼12.3% under simulated AM 1.5 global sunlight.4 This world-record efficiency was achieved using a donor–π-bridge–acceptor zinc porphyrin (YD2-o-C8) to replace commonly used Ru-based dyes as the sensitizer while using a Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl)-based redox couple to replace conventional I−/I3− redox as the electrolyte. The new YD2-o-C8 porphyrin can absorb a broader spectrum of light across the visible solar spectrum, leading to a larger photocurrent generation than that for typical Ru-based dyes; while the combination of the Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl)-based redox couple with YD2-o-C8 porphyrin significantly reduces the interfacial back electron transfer rate from TiO2 to the oxidized cobalt mediator, leading to a strikingly high open circuit voltage (Voc) close to 1 V.
Platinum (Pt) has been extensively used as the CE in DSCs due to its effective catalytic nature. However, due to concerns of the high cost of platinum, carbonaceous materials like graphite, carbon black, carbon nanotubes, electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNs), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) doped with p-toluenesulfonate (PEDOTTsO) or polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT-PSS) have been investigated as potential low cost replacements for platinum.5–21 Platinum in DSCs is generally deposited by sputtering or solution processing, which leads to planar deposition with little roughness and hence has a limited contact area with the electrolyte. This leads to a large charge transfer resistance which adds to the overall series resistance, limiting device performance. On the other hand, carbonaceous materials can provide large effective surface areas due to their porous or rough morphology, leading to a large number of reduction sites and hence low charge transfer resistance. However, due to the low conductivity of carbon compared to that of platinum, the resistance through the bulk of the carbon electrode and the high contact resistance of carbon with FTO outweigh the reduction in charge transfer resistance, leading to an overall increase in series resistance.
In this work, an innovative ECN–Pt composite CE was developed via solution-depositing Pt nanoparticles onto carbon nanofibers. This new CE exhibited a more efficient electro-catalytic performance with lower charge transfer resistance (Rct), larger surface area, and faster reaction rate than those of conventional Pt, without any increase in series resistance. This CE has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the DSC performance compared to those of conventional Pt-based devices.
2. Experimental
Preparation of electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNs)
ECNs were prepared by electrospinning polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers followed by thermal treatments of stabilization and carbonization. PAN (S.A.F 3K, Courtaulds, U.K.) was first dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to make a 14 wt% solution. The PAN solution was then filled into a 30 ml BD Luer-Lok tip plastic syringe with a stainless-steel needle having an 18 gauge 90° blunt end. The electrospinning setup included a high voltage power supply (model number ES30P), purchased from Gamma High Voltage Research, Inc. (Ormond Beach, FL), and a laboratory-produced roller with a diameter of 10 inches. During electrospinning, a positive high voltage of 25 kV was applied to the needle, and a flow rate of 1.0 ml h−1 was maintained by a digitally controlled syringe pump (model number KDS 200) purchased from KD Scientific Inc. (Holliston, MA). The PAN nanofibers were collected as an overlaid mat on the electrically grounded aluminum foil that covered the roller. The speed of the roller was set at 10 rpm. After electrospinning, the PAN nanofiber mat was first peeled off from the aluminum foil after immersion in distilled water; thereafter, the thermal treatments of stabilization in air and carbonization in argon were performed in a Lindberg 54453 Heavy Duty Tube Furnace purchased from TPS Co. (Watertown, WI). During the stabilization, a constant flow of air was maintained through the furnace; the PAN nanofiber mat was sandwiched between two graphite plates and heated to 280 °C for 6 h. The stabilized nanofiber mat was subsequently heated at a rate of 5 °C min−1 to 1200 °C in argon and maintained at this temperature for 1 h to prepare ECN mats. The prepared ECN mats had a width and length of ∼10 cm, thickness of ∼40 μm, and a mass per unit area of ∼15 g m−2.
Fabrication and evaluation of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)
A compact TiO2 layer was spin coated onto a fluorine doped tin dioxide (FTO) coated glass substrate, followed by the depositions of a TiCl4 treated nanocrystalline TiO2 layer (Solaronix Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP) and a light-scattering layer (Dyesol WER4-0) by doctor blading. The photoanode was then sintered at 475 °C and finally immersed in an N719 dye solution containing 0.5 mM Ruthenizer 535-bisTBA dye (Solaronix N-719) in acetonitrile/t-butanol (volume ratio: 1/1).
Crushed ECNs were soaked into a Pt precursor solution (0.02 M H2PtCl6·6H2O in anhydrous ethanol) for 6 h and then taken out; thereafter, the samples were heated at 400 °C for 15 min in a furnace. To prepare the ECN–Pt composite CE, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) sodium salt in DI water was added as a binder to make a paste and then applied onto the FTO coated glass substrate by doctor blading.7 Finally, the sample was sintered at 60 °C for 12 h.
The photoanode was subsequently assembled with the ECN–Pt CE and sealed using a thermoplastic sealant. The I−/I3− electrolyte was then injected into the cells. For comparison, similar DSCs using the solution-processed Pt and ECN separately as the CE were also fabricated. The fabricated devices were tested under AM 1.5 illumination at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussions

Fig. 1 shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of (a) the original ECN mat, (b) crushed ECNs, and (c) a composite ECN–Pt CE prepared by doctor blading the paste onto an FTO glass substrate. As shown in Fig. 1a, diameters of the originally prepared ECNs were in the range from ∼150 to ∼300 nm. The ECNs, which were initially tens of micro-meters long (Fig. 1a), were broken into much shorter ones with lengths ranging from sub-microns to several microns (Fig. 1b); this was due to sonication and/or pressing of the nanofibers prior to deposition onto FTO. After soaking with a Pt precursor and heating to 400 °C, Pt nanoparticles with sizes of several hundred nanometers were formed relatively uniformly onto the ECNs in the CE (Fig. 1c).

Fig. 2 shows the mapping images acquired from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of C, Pt, and Cl in the ECN–Pt composite CE. The EDS measurement was conducted by the chemical microanalysis technique coupled to a Hitachi S-4300N SEM. The red regions in Fig. 2a represented carbon nanofibers in the ECN–Pt composite; the bright blue dots in Fig. 2b signified Pt nanoparticles; while the bright green dots were from Cl. It is evident that the Pt nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the ECNs. Table 1 shows the percentage concentrations by weight of carbon, Pt, and Cl in the CE. Based on the acquired EDS analysis results, these were 46.7% C, 52.9% Pt, and 0.355% Cl by weight. The small amount of Cl was from the Pt precursor solution (0.02 M H2PtCl6·6H2O in anhydrous ethanol).

Fig. 3 shows cyclic voltammograms of ECN, ECN–Pt and Pt CEs. Two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks can be seen for all the electrodes. The oxidation peak on the left is attributed to the reduction of triiodide (I3− + 2e− → 3I−). This oxidation–reduction pair directly affects the performance of DSCs. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the larger oxidation–reduction current density for the ECN–Pt device indicates a faster reduction of triiodide ions and suggests that the composite CE has the more efficient electro-catalytic capabilities. The right side oxidation–reduction pair resulted from the redox reaction of 3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−, which has almost no effect on cell performance.5,22,23

The reference electrode is Ag/AgCl. The thicknesses of the ECN and Pt counter electrodes were 50 μm and 40 nm, respectively. 
To reduce photoanode effects on the study of CE, symmetrical dummy cells containing an electrolyte of the I−/I3− redox couple were made for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization on the ECN, Pt and ECN–Pt CEs. Such dummy cells were made with two identical ECN, Pt or ECN–Pt films deposited onto FTO substrates. Fig. 4a shows Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells from the ECN, ECN–Pt and Pt CEs, which were then fitted with an equivalent circuit diagram as shown in Fig. 4b. The circuit includes elements such as charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface of CE and electrolyte, constant phase element (CPE), series resistance (Rs), and Warburg impedance (ZW).5,16 The Warburg impedance was neglected while fitting the Nyquist plot of ECN–ECN dummy cells. The left side high frequency semicircle was caused by a charge transfer process (Rct) at the interface between CE and electrolyte, while the right side low frequency one was from the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZW) of the I−/I3− redox couple.5,24,25Table 2 summarizes the results from fitting the Nyquist plots. The Rct of ECN–Pt CE was merely 0.175 Ω cm2, much smaller than that (1.15 Ω cm2) of Pt CE and that (0.44 Ω cm2) of ECN CE, suggesting significantly stronger electro-catalytic capability in the ECN–Pt CE. Several factors, such as surface roughness, porous films, leaky capacitor, and non-uniform current distribution, can cause a semicircle to depress into an ellipse in the Nyquist plots, leading to a smaller β.16,26 A smaller β suggested higher porosity in the ECN–Pt and ECN CEs than in the Pt CE, consistent with previous reports.5,16 The larger capacitance (C) in the ECN–Pt CE indicated a higher surface area than that of the Pt CE, in agreement with other large surface area nanostructured CEs.16 In our previous study, we found that the Rs of pure ECN CE was about twice that of the Pt electrode.5 Intriguingly, by attaching Pt nanoparticles onto ECNs, Rs (3.16 Ω cm2) became smaller than those of pure Pt CE (3.31 Ω cm2) and pure ECN CE (4.12 Ω cm2). This would also contribute to a lower overall series resistance in the overall DSC devices, which will be discussed later.

Fig. 5 shows experimental and fitted current density versus voltage (J–V) curves for ECN–Pt composite and conventional Pt based cells under AM 1.5 illuminations with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Device performances are summarized in Table 3. The conventional Pt device achieved a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.27 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.81, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.61, leading to a power conversion efficiency (η) of ∼7%. The ECN device achieved a Jsc of 12.98 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.89 V, and a FF of 0.54, leading to a η of ∼6.31%. The new ECN–Pt composite CE device exhibited a Jsc of 14.35 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.83 V, and a FF of 0.67, yielding a higher η of ∼8%. The improvement in performance for the ECN–Pt CE device was mainly attributed to the increase in FF (0.67, 0.61 and 0.54 for ECN–Pt, Pt, and ECNs, respectively). The experimental J–V curves were also fitted to identify dark saturated current density (J0), series resistance (Rse), and shunt resistance (Rsh), and their fitted results are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that Rse (10.6 Ω cm2) of the ECN–Pt composite CE devices was smaller than that (12.9 Ω cm2) of conventional Pt cells and that (16.8 Ω cm2) of ECN based devices, consistent with a smaller Rs in the ECN–Pt CE dummy cells observed by EIS measurements. Additionally, the charge transfer rate from ECN–Pt CE to electrolyte was much faster than that in a conventional Pt CE due to a large surface area. Such a smaller Rs and faster charge transfer rate led to a smaller overall Rse in the ECN–Pt CE cells. In addition, the ECN–Pt CE cells exhibited a smaller J0 than that of Pt cells. The Rsh (1734.6 Ω cm2) in the ECN–Pt CE cells was also larger than that (1106 Ω cm2) of conventional Pt devices and that (485.27 Ω cm2) of ECN based devices. Such a lower Rse and J0, as well as a higher Rsh, led to a higher FF in the ECN–Pt devices.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the new ECN–Pt composite has been demonstrated as a more efficient electro-catalyst with lower charge transfer resistance (Rct), larger surface area, and faster reaction rate for the reduction of I3− ions than those of conventional Pt in DSCs. It was made by solution-depositing Pt onto low-cost ECNs. The ECN–Pt CE reduced Rse and J0 and increased Rsh in the DSCs, thereby leading to a higher Voc and FF for a higher η. DSC devices using ECN–Pt CE achieved a η of ∼8%, which was higher than that of the conventional Pt cells. This new ECN–Pt CE may also be combined with the recently developed DSCs with breakthrough efficiency made from broad spectrum porphyrins and Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl)-based redox electrolyte.
