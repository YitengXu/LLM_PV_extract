By optimizing the selenization method by using rapid thermal processing (RTP) combined with an improved graphite box, large grains throughout the whole absorber layer were successfully obtained. Based on such a high-quality CIGSSe absorber layer, an encouraging power conversion efficiency of 11.8% has been achieved with a Jsc of 28.25 mA cm−2, a Voc of 596 mV and a FF of 69.79% and without an antireflection coating.
Introduction
Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2(CIGSSe) thin film solar cells have been regarded as a promising alternative to well-developed silicon solar cells, as the highest reported efficiency is up to 22.6%.1 Solution-processed CIGSSe thin films deposited by roll-to-roll printing have advantages of low-cost and high-throughput compared to vacuum-based methods.2–5 To date, the most successful solution-based approach for fabricating CIGSSe thin film solar cells is based on hydrazine solutions. Mitzi et al. reported the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.2% by dissolving Cu2S, In2Se3 and Ga in anhydrous hydrazine in the presence of excess chalcogens.4 Advantages of this approach are that it can easily provide a large-grained absorber layer and it does not introduce undesirable impurity elements such as C, Cl, and O. However, this process was undermined by the inflammability, the high toxicity and the explosive nature of the solvent.4,6 It is therefore of interest to trigger global efforts to explore and seek safe alternative solvents.7–14 The two main issues of the current non-hydrazine solution process are the existence of a fine-grained layer between the Mo substrate and the large-grained layer, and the impurity elements introduced from starting materials. The use of metal chalcogenides and bulk metals as starting materials would be a better approach to deposit CIGSSe thin films. Unfortunately, bulk metals and metal chalcogenides have extremely low solubility in common solvents.
In 2013, Webber et al. found that the solvent mixture of 1,2-ethanedithiol and 1,2-ethylenediamine has the ability to dissolve the nine V2VI3 chalcogenides.15 However, device performances based on such ethylenediamine–ethanedithiol solvent mixtures were not reported. In our previous work, we dissolved elemental Cu, In, Ga, and Se in 1,2-ethanedithiol and 1,2-ethylenediamine to form the CIGSe solution; a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.5% could be achieved through this method.14 Unfortunately, the fine-grained layer hampers further improvement of the device performance. Xin et al. suggested that small grains are mostly detrimental to device performance as they decrease the carrier mobility and increase the chance for recombination at grain boundaries.16 Therefore, obtaining a large-grained absorber and employing metal chalcogenides and bulk metals as starting materials are still of great significance to improve the PCE of CIGSSe solar cells.
Herein, we first employed Cu2S, In2Se3, and Ga as metal sources and dissolved them in a 1,2-ethanedithiol and 1,2-ethylenediamine solvent mixture, which did not introduce unfriendly elements at all. Using this route, we could synthesize the final film with high phase purity and uniform composition. Surprisingly, we found that Cu2S, In2Se3, and Ga can also be highly dissolved and form a homogeneous precursor solution. Compared to our previous work, we optimized the selenization process by adopting a rapid thermal selenization process using a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace instead of a traditional tubular furnace. Finally, large grains throughout the bulk of the CIGSSe film were successfully obtained. An encouraging power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.8% has been achieved.
Experimental section
Materials
Copper sulfide (Cu2S, 99.5%), indium selenide (In2Se3, 99.9%), and gallium pellets (Ga, 99.99999%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar chemical company. 1,2-Ethanedithiol (C2H6S2, 97%), cadmium sulfate 8/3-hydrate (CdSO4·8/3H2O, 99%), thiourea (NH2CSNH2, 99%), and selenium (Se, 99.9%) were purchased from Aladdin company. 1,2-Ethylenediamine was bought from Kemiou chemical company. Ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, 25%) was obtained from Beijing chemical works. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
Formation of CIGSSe precursor solution
To prepare a typical CIGSSe precursor solution, Cu2S (0.073 g, 0.46 mmol), In2Se3 (0.163 g, 0.35 mmol), Ga (0.021 g, 0.30 mmol), and Se (0.158 g, 1.99 mmol) were weighed and transferred to a round-bottom flask. Next, 3.3 mL of 1,2-ethylenediamine and 0.33 mL of 1,2-ethanedithiol were added into the argon-filled flask. After about 12 h of magnetic stirring at 70 °C, a homogeneous reddish brown solution was obtained. The obtained CIGSSe precursor solution remained stable for periods ranging from days to months.
Deposition and selenization of CIGSSe films
First, 90 μL of solution was spin-coated onto a molybdenum-coated soda lime glass with a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s in an argon-filled glovebox (water and oxygen levels were maintained below 1 ppm). The coated thin films were heated on a hot plate at 350 °C for 2 min to form the CIGSSe nanocrystal thin films. The spin-coating/annealing steps were repeated different times and different targeted thicknesses were achieved. Subsequently, the CIGSSe nanocrystal thin films and selenium were placed in a round graphite box. The selenization process was conducted at 550 °C for 900 s in a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace (ramp to 550 °C at 9 °C s−1) and under an argon flow (80 mL min−1).
Fabrication of CIGSSe photovoltaic devices
The CdS buffer layer with about 70 nm thickness was deposited onto the CIGSSe film by a chemical bath deposition method. CdS deposition was conducted by immersing the CIGSSe films in a solution mixture of 200 mL of deionized H2O, 12.5 mL of NH4OH, 50 mL of CdSO4 (0.006 M), and 50 mL of NH2CSNH2 (3.0 M) at 70 °C for 15 min.27,28 Next, 50 nm intrinsic ZnO (i-ZnO) followed by a 300 nm indium tin oxide (ITO) layer were successively deposited by RF magnetron sputtering. Finally, silver grid electrodes (∼200 nm) were thermally evaporated to form the front contact. Nine CIGSSe devices were defined by mechanical scribing according to the designed area. Each CIGSSe device follows the standard structure of Mo/CIGSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag grids with an active area of 0.21 cm2 (∼94% of total device area) without an antireflection coating.
Characterization
The morphologies of CIGSSe samples were determined using a Nova Nano SEM 450. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. Current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter to determine the basic characteristics of the CIGSSe devices with an active area of 0.21 cm2. The CIGSSe devices were illuminated with a Newport solar simulator under AM 1.5 at 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by using a Newport optical power meter (model 842-PE). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was recorded using a Zolix SCS100 QE system equipped with a lock-in amplifier and a 150 W xenon light source. Admittance spectroscopy (AS) measurements were performed on a Keithley 4200-SCS Semiconductor Characterization System with 0 V DC bias and 30 mV AC amplitude in the range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz in darkness. DLCP measurements were performed with AC amplitude from 15 mV to 140 mV and DC bias from −0.5 V to 0 V and the temperature range from 160 K to 300 K.
Results and discussion
We have previously reported a robust route to fabricate CIGSe solar cells.14 However, the presence of a fine-grained layer has been shown to limit the efficiency of the CIGSe solar cells. As shown in Fig. 1a, the selenized CIGSe film is clearly composed of a bilayer structure with a 550 nm thick large-grained top layer and a 650 nm thick small-grained bottom layer. The larger grains can effectively reduce the grain boundaries in the direction of carrier motion. Furthermore, fine grains lead to a high series resistance and decrease the current generation.17 It has been found that only the top large grains contributed to the device photo-response under illumination.16–19 Therefore, the elimination of the fine-grained layer and the thickening of the large-grained layer is believed be an effective route to improve the solar cell performance.

In this work, we chose Cu2S, In2Se3, Ga and Se as starting materials dissolved in a 1,2-ethanedithiol–1,2-ethylenediamine solvent mixture. It is speculated that deprotonated thiols and protonated amines are formed in this solvent mixture.20 The remarkable ability of the mixed amine-thiol solvent is thought to be due to the presence of RS− species in the solvent mixture, which can bind to metal ions and generate complexes.21 More importantly, we optimized the selenization process by adopting a rapid thermal process using a RTP furnace (ramp to 550 °C at 9 °C s−1, Ar: 80 mL min−1) instead of the traditional tubular furnace. Meanwhile, we also replaced the obsolete rectangle graphite box used in our previous work with an improved round-shaped graphite box (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Surprisingly, we obtained larger grains of ∼1.2 μm throughout the bulk of selenized films (obtained by 8 spin-coating/sintering cycles), as shown in Fig. 1c. The top-view SEM image of CIGSSe films also exhibits a compact and densely packed morphology with a crystal size larger than 2 μm (Fig. 1d); this will be shown to make a great contribution to the final performance of CIGSSe solar cells. Moreover, the CIGSSe thin film composition was measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The chemical composition of the selenized thin film is Cu22.82In17.03Ga8.04Se48.02S4.09, as determined by averaging 5 random spots. The selenized CIGSSe film has a Cu/(In + Ga) ratio of 0.91 and a Ga/(In + Ga) ratio of 0.32; these values are very close to the ratios between starting materials within the precursor solution (Cu/(In + Ga) = 0.92, Ga/(In + Ga) = 0.30) and consistent with those previously reported for high-efficiency CIGSSe devices.13,22
To better understand why our procedure led to the reduction of the fine-grained layer, we made a comparison of effects between a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace and the traditional tubular furnace, combined with two types of graphite boxes, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The cross-section and top-view SEM images of CIGSSe films with different selenization setups are shown in Fig. 2. In the setup corresponding to the tubular furnace selenization (Fig. 2a and b), a thick fine-grained layer (Fig. 2a: 400–580 nm; Fig. 2b: 300–350 nm) forms between the Mo electrode and the large-grained layer. As demonstrated in the experiment, the fine-grained layer became thinner when using the round graphite box (Fig. 2b). Thus, the round graphite box is better than the rectangle graphite box and is more effective in the elimination of the fine-grained layer. When the RTP furnace was used in the selenization setup (Fig. 2c and d), the fine-grained layer almost disappeared. The largest grains throughout the whole thin film were obtained when using the round graphite box was combined with the RTP furnace, which is much better than the tubular furnace for eliminating the fine-grained layer. It is necessary to provide a sufficient selenium partial pressure for obtaining the largest-grained absorber layer during the whole selenization process.18 Advantages of the RTP furnace include a faster heating rate (ramp to 550 °C at 9 °C s−1, about 60 s) and that it can effectively relieve the selenium vapour loss during the heating process. The tubular furnace requires a relatively long time to reach the desired temperature (the ramp to 550 °C at 50 °C min−1 takes about 660 s). During this heating process, a lot of selenium vapour tends to leave the graphite box. Residual selenium vapour cannot provide a sufficient selenium partial pressure through the whole selenization process. In addition, our improved round-shaped graphite box has a better ability to maintain the selenium vapour with respect to the rectangular-shaped graphite box during the selenization process. To summarize, the synergy between the RTP furnace and the round graphite box plays a key role in eliminating the fine-grained layer in CIGSSe thin films. Therefore, we used this selenization setup (RTP plus round graphite box) to fabricate CIGSSe solar cells.
 Fig. 2  Cross-section and top-view SEM images of CIGSSe films corresponding to different selenization setups (spin-coating: 8 times; annealing: 350 °C, 2 min; selenization: 550 °C, in the RTP furnace-15 min, in the tubular furnace-20 min): (a) tubular furnace with a rectangular graphite box; (b) tubular furnace with a round graphite box; (c) RTP furnace with a rectangle graphite box; (d) RTP furnace with a round graphite box. 
To investigate the influence of the as-prepared film thickness on the crystal growth and device efficiency, we made a series of comparative experiments for different spin-coating/sintering cycles, as shown in Fig. 3. When the spin-coating/sintering cycles were more than 8, and for a selenization at 550 °C for 15 min, all top-view images of selenized CIGSSe thin films exhibited a compact and densely packed morphology. However, when the spin-coating/sintering cycles were repeated for less than 8 times, top-view image showed an incoherent coverage. Interestingly, cross-section images indicate a transition from a unique layer, to a tri-layer, and then to a bi-layer structure with the increase of the number of spin-coating/sintering cycles (Fig. 3b–f). When the spin-coating/sintering is repeated 14 times, the cross-section image exhibits a tri-layer morphology; this may be due to nucleation that occurs at both the top and bottom of the CIGSSe film, leaving a fine-grained layer sandwiched between two crystalline layers.18

To investigate the crystal structure, phase formation, and quality of the as-prepared and selenized thin films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed, as shown in Fig. 4. The as-prepared CIGSSe thin film shows very broad and weak diffraction peaks, indicating that the film is comprised of small grain size nanocrystals. Sharper and more intense XRD peaks obtained in the selenized CIGSSe thin films indicate the presence of large densely packed grains. The main XRD diffraction peaks of the selenized CIGSSe thin films at 26.9°, 44.7°, 53.1° correspond to the (112), (204)/(220), and (312)/(116) planes of chalcopyrite, respectively, which is in good agreement with what was previously reported.23 In addition, diffraction peaks at 2θ = 40.4° and 73.6° correspond to the Mo. The presence of broad and weak diffraction peaks from MoSe2, at 2θ = 31.9° and 56.1°, indicates that a MoSe2 layer is formed between the Mo and the CIGSSe layer at a high selenization temperature.13,14,23

Fig. 5 shows the digital photograph and cross-sectional SEM images of the champion CIGSSe solar cell with a typical structure of glass/Mo/CIGSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag. The different layers have been coloured differently for clarity. The Mo layer is composed of Mo (∼800 nm) and MoSe2 (∼280 nm, purple). The CIGSSe absorber (850–1250 nm), CdS buffer layer (∼70 nm, yellow), i-ZnO (∼50 nm, blue), and ITO (∼300 nm) were highlighted respectively.

Fig. 6a presents the J–V characteristics of the champion CIGSSe cell under AM 1.5 illumination and in the dark; this yields a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.75% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 28.25 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 596 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 69.79%. The average power conversion efficiency of the nine sister devices on the same substrate is 11.11%. Detailed device parameters of the nine cells are reported in Table 1. Compared to other groups, the device performance is mainly limited by the low Voc resulting from the relatively large bandgap (Eg) value of 1.17 eV.1,24 The larger bandgap typically implies a larger Voc deficit (Voc,def) or higher Eg/q-Voc. Reducing the absorber bandgap close to the optimum value of 1.14 eV is believed to be a key factor leading to the improvement of the device efficiency in the current work.4 In addition, the high Rs is possibly attributed to the thicker MoSe2 layer (∼280 nm) formed between the absorber and the Mo electrode.24,25Rs values were calculated from the plot of dV/dJ versus (J + Jsc)−1 redrawn from the standard light J–V curves.27 The plots showing dV/dJ versus (J + Jsc)−1 of nine CIGSSe solar cells deposited on the same substrate (C-1–C-9) are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Series resistance results drastically decreased compared with those from our previous work thanks to the elimination of the fine-grained layer (Table S1†). To further reduce the series resistance to a level as low as that of other superior CIGSSe solar cells (∼0.5 Ω cm2),24,25 a barrier layer must be inserted to suppress the formation of a thick MoSe2 layer. This will require adjusting the Se partial pressure and optimizing the preparation process conditions of the Mo back contact in the future. Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†) show SEM images and typical J–V curves of the CIGSSe solar cells with different spin-coating/sintering cycles, respectively. Table 2 lists current density-voltage (J–V) parameters of solar cells based on CIGSSe films formed with different spin-coating/annealing cycles. The data show average values from 18 devices with standard deviations. All samples were fabricated through the same process with 11.75% efficiency of the champion cell.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the best device is shown in Fig. 6b. The maximum value in the visible light range is above 80% (at 550 nm). A gradual decay in the range of 550–1100 nm is observed at longer wavelengths, which is probably attributed to the recombination at the backside and to the presence of a narrow depletion region. The low-lying decay below 530 nm is mainly due to the absorption of the CdS buffer layer.11,13 The calculated Jsc from the EQE curve is 27.95 mA cm−2, which is very close to the measured value obtained from the light J–V curve. The absorber bandgap (Eg = 1.17 eV) near the band edge was extracted by plotting [E × ln(1 − EQE)]2versus E, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6b.
To investigate the electrical properties of the solar cell, admittance spectroscopy (AS) measurements were performed by acquiring capacitance-frequency (CF) scans over the range of 120 K to 290 K in the dark with a frequency range from 103 to 107 Hz, as shown in Fig. 7a. An AC voltage of 30 mV was applied and DC bias was kept at zero. The capacitance at high frequency indicates the response of the free carrier density, while the capacitance at low frequency represents the response of the sum of free carriers and deep traps.26 The decrease of the capacitance at high frequencies indicates the presence of defects in the CIGSSe film. Trap conductance spectra also confirm these peaks in the high-frequency region (Fig. 7b). From the slope of the fitting curve derived from the temperature-dependent AS spectrum, the Arrhenius plot allows for the extraction of the activation energy (Ea = 112 meV); this demonstrates a relatively shallow defect distribution in the CIGSSe thin film, as shown in Fig. 7c.4 Drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) was another effective way to characterize electrical properties. The carrier density reaches ∼4 × 1016/cm−3 at 300 K (Fig. 7d), and the depletion width was 0.23 μm at 0 V bias, which is in the typical range of CIGSSe solar cells.4

Conclusions
In summary, we presented a robust solution approach to fabricate high-quality CIGSSe thin films. Cu2S, In2Se3, Ga and Se were simultaneously dissolved in a mixture of 1,2-ethanedithiol and 1,2-ethylenediamine. Compared with previous studies, we successfully obtained larger grains throughout the absorber layer allowing for high-efficiency CIGSSe photovoltaic cells. In addition, the influence of the as-prepared film thickness on the crystal growth and device efficiency was investigated in detail. Based on such a high-quality CIGSSe absorber, an improved power conversion efficiency of 11.8% has been achieved without an antireflection coating. In the future work, reducing the absorber bandgap close to the optimum value of 1.14 eV is used to improve the device efficiency. Meanwhile, we will focus on understanding the formation mechanism of the large-grain absorber layer and suppressing the formation of the thick MoSe2 layer for further improving the power conversion efficiency of CIGSSe solar cells.
