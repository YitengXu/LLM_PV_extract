    , Accepted 19th August 2021First published on 20th August 2021AbstractIncorporation of ultrathin nanosheets with dopants/defects shows great potential to enable metal (oxy)-hydroxide electrocatalysts with enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance via the regulation of atomic structure and bonding arrangements. However, it remains challenging in synthesis especially for such dual control and at large scale. In this study, we present a stepwise chemical oxidation route, involving phase transition and reconstruction processes, to access ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets with a thickness of ca. 4 nm and abundant oxygen vacancies. Other transition metals were also doped into CoOOH nanosheets through this strategy. Among them, the optimized FeCoOOH nanosheets demonstrated an efficient OER activity with overpotential as low as 252 mV (current density: 10 mA cm−2) and excellent stability. A high and stable solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 10.5% was acquired when FeCoOOH nanosheets were used as the anode in a constructed water splitting device driven by solar energy. This study offers a noble and facile strategy for potentially scalable preparation of atom-modulated ultrathin metal (oxy)-hydroxide nanosheets, and also demonstrates the OER applications.
Introduction
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a vital half reaction in various sustainable energy conversion technologies, e.g., artificial photosynthesis, water splitting and chargeable metal–air batteries.1–4 However, the intrinsic sluggish kinetics in the multistep proton and electron transfer processes greatly hamper its functions, and thus the development of efficient OER electrocatalysts is indispensable.5,6 Recently, great research efforts have been made to exploit 3d transition metal (TM) compounds as OER electrocatalysts, which can replace noble-metal oxides, such as RuO2 and IrO2, to reduce the costs in applications.7,8 These compounds range from transition-metal oxides, (oxy)-hydroxides, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), sulfide/selenides, nitride/phosphides, and alloys to metal organic framework (MOF)-derived materials.7–15 However, significant research studies recently pointed out that transition metal (oxy)-hydroxides (FeOOH, CoOOH and NiOOH etc.) are actually the electro-catalytically active components in many types of 3d TM compounds during OER processes resulting from irreversible surface reconstruction.16,17 Thus, the direct research on modification of transition metal oxyhydroxides would be more effective for the design of OER electrocatalysts.
Among various transition metal oxyhydroxides, cobalt (oxy)-hydroxide (CoOOH) has drawn great attention due to the appropriate electronic configuration of Co3+ for the adsorption of reactants/intermediates.18,19 The modifications on CoOOH could be implemented via the doping of other metals and creating surface defects. The dopants and defects can directly serve as the adsorption sites for the OER, or regulate the electronic structure of the active centers and optimize adsorption energy/reactivity of intermediates to expedite the OER processes.20,21 On the other hand, most of the reported CoOOH catalysts are in the bulk form with limited surface area, highly restricting the mass transport and electron transfer processes during the OER. The fascinating characteristics of optimized electronic structure and highly exposed catalytic active centers could be obtained by thinning bulk CoOOH into two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets, resulting in an effective improvement in their electrocatalytic OER performance.22 Additionally, the low-dimensional layered structure of CoOOH with tunable bonding arrangements could serve as one of the most representative platforms for mechanistic studies.23 Taken together, the incorporation of ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets with dopant/defects shows great potential to enable the enhanced OER performance of electrocatalysts, and the challenge ahead lies in the synthesis.
Liquid exfoliation is the most common technique for the preparation of 2D nanosheets, which is however not applicable for CoOOH synthesis due to the small interlayer distance. Other methods such as the “atomic-scale phase transformation” approach using Co(OH)2 as a precursor24 and laser ablation in liquid (LAL),25 suffer from tedious procedures and low production yield. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a novel method for the synthesis of ultrathin CoOOH-based nanosheets, with effective incorporation of dopant/defects as aforesaid. Chemical transformation is a common way to obtain various structures as desired. In this process, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs)26 are a promising precursor to be transformed into various nano-structured materials, e.g., transition-metal alloys, oxides, sulfides, phosphides etc.27–30 Recently, Zhang et al. reported an electrochemical oxidation process for the in situ transformation of FeCo-PBAs into ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets. They demonstrated that the surface structure underwent a two-stage evolution process with the applied potentials.31 A similar result was also obtained with FeNi-PBAs.32 However, the electrochemical oxidation method is difficult to scale up and often requires binders and carbon supports, which cause coverage and loss of some electrocatalytic active sites. By employing specific oxidants with the oxidizing capacity equivalent to the applied potentials in electrosynthesis, we reason that PBAs could be converted into CoOOH nanosheets via stepwise chemical oxidation treatments. More importantly, such chemical oxidation methods with flexible controls would facilitate the introduction of dopants/defects into CoOOH nanosheets during the synthesis. Until now, however, none of the research work has achieved this process.
In this study, we first present a stepwise chemical oxidation route to access ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies for efficient OER. The Na2CoFe(CN)6 (FeCo-PB) nanocubes were pre-oxidized by H2O2 solution, resulting in a phase transition from a rhombohedral lattice to cubic lattice. Further oxidation with NaClO solution induced an intermediate reconstruction into ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets with about 4 nm thickness. The as-synthesized CoOOH nanosheets were able to be easily doped with other transition metal ions during the chemical oxidation treatment. The synthetic Fe-CoOOH nanosheets showed excellent OER performance, with an overpotential as low as 252 mV (@10 mA cm−2), a Tafel slope as low as 61.8 mV dec−1, and high stability in 1 M potassium hydroxide electrolyte. When coupled with commercially acquired polycrystalline silicon solar cells, the two-electrode configuration with the FeCoOOH-NF anode demonstrated a stable solar-to-hydrogen efficiency as high as 10.5%. This work not only demonstrates the OER applications of metal (oxy)-hydroxide nanosheets with doping and defects, but also offers a facile approach for their potentially scalable preparation at a low cost.
Experimental section
Preparation of Na2CoFe(CN)6 (FeCo-PB)
Na2CoFe(CN)6 was synthesized in water solution at room temperature as reported by previous literature with some minor modifications.33 Typically, 2000 mL of 5 mM Na4Fe(CN)6 solution was poured into 2000 mL of a 12.5 mM Na3C6H5O7 and 2.5 mM CoCl2 mixture solution under magnetic stirring and aged for 48 h. The obtained solid sample was filtered, washed and dried overnight.
Preparation of CoOOH ultrathin nanosheets
First, 500 mg of FeCo-PB was dissolved in 1250 mL of water and then sonicated for 10 min to get a dark yellow solution. 100 mL of H2O2 solution (30%) was dropwise added into the above solution at a speed of 5 mL min−1, and then stirred for 30 min until the color of the solution turned dark grey. 250 mL of 0.1 M NaClO solution was added into the above solution dropwise at a speed of 10 mL min−1 with continuous stirring. The reaction was conducted for 6 h and the solution finally turned brown. The final product was then collected, washed with distilled water several times, and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. To better understand the effect of oxidants during the synthesis, FeCo-PB was only oxidized by H2O2 and NaClO solutions according to previous procedures and named FeCo-PB-H2O2 and FeCo-PB-NaClO, respectively.
Preparation of transition metal doped CoOOH ultrathin nanosheets (M-CoOOH, M = Fe, Ni, Mn)
In a typical synthesis of Fe-CoOOH nanosheets, 500 mg of FeCo-PB was dissolved in 1250 mL of water and then sonicated for 10 min to get a dark yellow solution. 250 mL of ferrous acetate (2 mM) was added dropwise into the above solution and stirred 12 h for ion exchange. 100 mL of H2O2 solution (30%) was dropwise added into the above solution and stirred for 30 min. 250 mL of 0.1 M NaClO solution was added into the above solution dropwise with continuous stirring. The reaction was conducted for 6 h. The final product was then collected, washed with distilled water several times, and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 60 °C.
Ni-CoOOH nanosheets and Mn-CoOOH nanosheets were synthesized through a similar procedure. For the preparation of Ni-CoOOH and Mn-CoOOH, nickel acetate tetrahydrate and manganese acetate tetrahydrate were used as the transition metal sources.
Preparation of MoNi4/MoO2/NF as the cathode for water splitting
MoNi4 has been widely used to replace noble metals as an efficient HER electrocatalyst and the detailed synthesis procedure is described as follows:34 a piece of pretreated nickel foam (1 cm × 3 cm) was vertically put into a 50 mL Teflon autoclave containing 15 mL of a solution containing 0.04 M Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.01 M (NH4)6Mo7O24·6H2O. The autoclave was maintained at 150 °C for 6 h to obtain NiMoO4 on nickel foam (NiMoO4/NF). Finally, NiMoO4/NF was annealed at 500 °C for 2 h under a H2/Ar (v/v, 1/9) atmosphere to obtain MoNi4/MoO2/NF.
Characterization
The morphology of the as-prepared samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S4800/Cryo). The composition of the samples and elemental mapping were analyzed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) attached to the SEM instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and HRTEM images were obtained using a JEM-2100F instrument with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The morphology and height profile study of the CoOOH nanosheets was performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Agilent-5500). The elements on the surface of the as-prepared samples were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PerkinElmer PHI 5000 C ESCA) with a monochromic Al/Kα X-ray source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a MiniFlex diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu, Japan).
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical setup using a computer-controlled electrochemistry workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instrument Inc.). A platinum wire electrode and an Ag/AgCl saturated KCl electrode served as the counter and reference electrode, respectively. The catalysts were loaded on nickel foam (NF) as the working electrode with a mass loading of 0.5 mg cm−2. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed with the potential range from 0 to 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl for OER activity measurements, which were conducted in 1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Potentials reported in this study were all quoted against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the equation E vs. RHE = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.059 × pH. All polarization curves were corrected with 90% iR-compensation. The long-term stability of the electrocatalyst was measured by a chronopotentiometry test at 10 mA cm−2.
Electrochemical capacitance was determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), which was performed over a potential window of −0.036 to 0.064 V vs. Ag/AgCl (open-circuit potential: −0.014 V) and scan rates ranging from 5 to 800 mV s−1. EIS was recorded under the following conditions: AC voltage amplitude 1.5 V vs. RHE and frequency ranges 106 to 0.1 Hz. The resistance values were fitted to the data using the simplified Randel's circuit. The faradaic efficiency (FE) was assessed by the water drainage method.  where VO2 is the volume of water drainage by O2 generation, Qtest means the passing charges recorded by the electrochemical station, and F is the Faraday constant.
The TOF value is calculated from the equation:TOF = (J × A)/(4 × F × n)where J is the current density at the given overpotentials, A is the surface area of the electrode, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the number of moles of metal on the electrode, which assumed all the Co ions in the electrocatalysts taking part in the reactions. So, the TOF values represented the lower limit, since some of these metal sites in the catalyst were electrochemically non-accessible.
Water splitting devices and measurements
Overall water splitting measurements were performed in a two-electrode system consisting of FeCoOOH-NF as the anode and MoNi4/MoO2/NF as the cathode. The LSV test was performed in 1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. A solar-driven electrolyzer for water splitting was demonstrated by coupling a commercial planar polycrystalline Si solar cell with the abovementioned electrolyzer set-up. The polycrystalline Si solar cells with a geometric dimension of 12.0 cm2 presented a short circuit current density of 5 mA cm−2 and open circuit potential of 2.0 V. The solar to hydrogen efficiency (STH) is calculated by this equation: ηSTH = 1.23 × JOP × F/Pphoto, where JOP refers to the operation current under light illumination and F refers to the faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution.35
Results and discussion
A stepwise chemical oxidation route was used for the preparation of the CoOOH material, in which the oxidants H2O2 and NaClO were used in succession. After the synthesis of the FeCo-PB precursor at room temperature in water solution, the precursor chemically oxidized only by H2O2 was gathered (the FeCo-PB-H2O2 intermediate). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterization was conducted to understand the changes in structure during this oxidation process. As shown in Fig. 1a, the (220) and (220) doublets of FeCo-PB combined into the single peak centered at ca. 25° after H2O2 oxidation. This phenomenon suggests that a phase transition occurs from the rhombohedral phase into the cubic phase, which was also found previously in the charging process of the FeCo-PB cathode in sodium-ion batteries, accompanied by the reaction: Na2CoII[FeII(CN)6] → NaCoIII[FeII(CN)6] + e− + Na+.36 With the further oxidation by NaClO, the diffraction peaks of FeCo-PB completely disappeared and the phase was transformed into the typical β-CoOOH (JCPDS card no. 07-0169). More importantly, the low intensity of (003) at 20.2° implied the formation of ultrathin nanosheets. To further confirm this phase transition behavior and the formation of CoOOH, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed to examine the chemical valence states and compositions of the samples. Fig. 1b shows an obvious change of the contents of Na, Fe, and N in the XPS survey during the oxidation processes. Notably, the decreased intensity of the Na 1s and Auger peaks further demonstrates the extraction of Na+ ions after H2O2 oxidation, as shown in Fig. 1c. Meanwhile, XPS tests confirmed that the valence states of Fe and Co partially changed from +2 to +3 after H2O2 oxidation, as shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI.† Furthermore, the absolute disappearance of the Na 1s, Fe 2p and N 1s peaks in CoOOH indicates the successful structural transformation and the total leakage of [Fe(CN)6]4− and Na+. The single peak at about 713.6 eV was assigned to the Co Auger peak by comparison with FeCo-PB and FeCo-PB-H2O2 (Fig. S3†). The generation of the [Fe(CN)6]4− species in the resultant solution could be further confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy (Fig. S3†). To directly observe these structural changes, morphological characterization was performed. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 1d and Fig. S4† show that the FeCo-PB sample possessed a cubic morphology with dimensions of about 550 nm. After oxidation with H2O2, the size and morphology were mostly maintained. However, the edges and corners of the nanocubes were etched, with the surfaces becoming rough (Fig. 1e). Interestingly, etching on the edges and corners in our case was different from previous reports, which demonstrated that the flat surfaces of PBAs are more unstable than the corners or the edges.37 Further oxidation with NaClO solution resulted in structural transformation into ultrathin nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 1f. However, the direct oxidation of FeCo-PB by NaClO resulted in the deficient structural transformation and the aggregation of CoOOH nanosheets into a large bulk with a thickness of about 200 nm (Fig. S5 and S6†), which in turn proves the benefit of the stepwise oxidation procedure by H2O2 and NaClO.

The schematic diagram for the overall evolution processes from FeCo-PB nanocubes into ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets based on the above characterization results is presented in Fig. 1g. When FeCo-PB nanocubes (dark yellow) were treated with H2O2 solution, the Co2+ species on the FeCo-PB nanocube surface were oxidized into Co3+ species, accompanied by the extraction of Na+ ions to keep the charges balanced. The partially oxidized Co3+ ions lowered the stability of FeCo-PB, and some of the [Fe(CN)6]4− ligands would thus escape from the surface of FeCo-PB. Therefore, the oxidation treatment by H2O2 not only led to phase transition (rhombohedral phase → cubic phase), but also etched the edges and corners of the nanocubes and turned the smooth surface into a rough one. The above changes were accompanied by the color change of the mixture solution from dark yellow to dark grey, as visually observed in Fig. S7.† The subsequent oxidation using the stronger oxidant NaClO further broke the coordination of Co3+ and [Fe(CN)6]4−, and deconstructed the etched nanocubes, leading to the formation of cobalt oxyhydroxide nanosheets with uniform morphology. The leaking [Fe(CN)6]4− ligands were quantified by UV/Vis (Fig. S8†), and the result showed that about 93.8% of [Fe(CN)6]4− ligands were recycled after the stepwise chemical oxidation process. In our case, 125 mg of CoOOH nanosheets were obtained from 500 mg of FeCo-PB, and the yield was calculated to be 86.2% according to the Co content. Moreover, our method was also extended to synthesize some other transition metal (oxy)-hydroxide materials, e.g., β-NiOOH with a similar procedure (Fig. S9†). Therefore, the above explications indicate that the stepwise chemical oxidation is a feasible strategy to prepare metal (oxy)-hydroxide nanosheets.
The detailed structural information of the CoOOH nanosheets was characterized as follows. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows numerous wrinkled nanosheets (Fig. 2a). The thickness of the nanosheets was further determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The scanning image in Fig. 2b and corresponding height profiles in Fig. 2c show that the size is about 1 μm for the nanosheets with a thickness of about 4 nm, confirming the formation of ultrathin nanosheets. Notably, the thicknesses of the nanosheets in the 20 μm × 20 μm region were all almost 4 nm, demonstrating the advantages of the stepwise chemical oxidation method to prepare nanosheets with a uniform thickness. The valence state of cobalt in CoOOH nanosheets was investigated by XPS, which exhibits two spin–orbit doublets at 780.1 and 795.2 eV, which were assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively.38 The difference in energy values between them is 15.1 eV, indicating the coexistence of Co3+ and Co2+ species (Fig. 2d). The Co 2p3/2 peak was deconvoluted into Co2+ (781.0 eV) and Co3+ (779.9 eV), and the corresponding areas could be used to calculate the relative atomic ratio of Co2+ and Co3+ species on the CoOOH surface. Obviously, the ratio of Co3+ species in the as-synthesized CoOOH nanosheets is lower than that in the CoOOH bulk material, suggesting more oxygen vacancies in the CoOOH nanosheets. Besides, four peaks centered at 529.2, 530.2, 531.5 and 532.9 eV were obtained by deconvolution of the O 1s spectra, corresponding to lattice O (OLO), lattice OH (OLOH), absorbed OH (AOH), and absorbed H2O (AH2O), respectively (Fig. 2e).25 The relative ratios of OLO and OLOH in CoOOH nanosheets are lower than those in the CoOOH bulk, respectively, confirming more oxygen vacancy defects in the CoOOH nanosheets. The above results were further solidified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). As shown in Fig. 2f, the EPR signal (g = 2.003) intensity of CoOOH nanosheets is significantly higher than that of the CoOOH bulk, further demonstrating the existence of more oxygen vacancy defects in the CoOOH nanosheets. In general, all the above results clearly demonstrate the successful preparation of high quality and uniform ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies by the stepwise chemical oxidation processes.

Other transition metals could be easily doped into ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets via stepwise chemical oxidation processes. As shown in Fig. 3a, the as-synthesized oxyhydroxides can be indexed as the β-CoOOH lattice (JCPDS card no. 07-0169) after the incorporation of Fe ions into the lattice of CoOOH. Moreover, there was no obvious offset from the standard card after Fe doping, suggesting that the doping almost did not influence the lattice of CoOOH, and a similar phenomenon has also been reported.23,38 To demonstrate the uniform dispersion of Fe in the FeCoOOH nanosheets, the elemental mapping and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were also obtained. As shown in Fig. S11,† Fe and Co overlapped well, which indicated the uniform dispersion of Fe in the FeCoOOH nanosheets. The HRTEM image of the FeCoOOH nanosheets in Fig. S12† shows distinct lattice fringes of 0.244 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane of CoOOH as reported in previous works.22,39 However, the Fe doping would regulate the electronic configuration in the metal (oxy)-hydroxide nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Co 2p peak shifts positively by ca. 0.50 eV in FeCoOOH compared with that of CoOOH which was observed in the XPS spectra, which indicated that Co and Fe had strong electronic interactions. Due to the modified electronic structure, lower energy levels of intermediates during the OER processes could be obtained after Fe incorporation as reported in previous works,40,41 which was further confirmed by electrochemical tests in the following section. The Fe 2p XPS spectrum of FeCoOOH showed the valence of Fe is +3 (Fig. 3c). The O 1s spectrum could be deconvoluted into lattice O (OLO), lattice OH (OLOH), absorbed OH (AOH), and absorbed H2O (AH2O), respectively (Fig. S10†).42

The positive shift of the metal–O peak of FeCoOOH (529.6 eV) in comparison with CoOOH (529.3 eV) indicated that Fe3+ species could affect the O chemical state.43 The average contents of Fe and Co were uncovered by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses, which were 21.17 and 51.33 wt%, respectively (Fig. S13†). The atomic ratio of Co:Fe was calculated to be 2.30. The results above show that Fe3+ species could be easily doped into CoOOH ultrathin nanosheets and the doping of Fe3+ could effectively modulate the electronic state of Co.
To verify the influence of oxygen vacancies and dopants towards electrochemical performance, we first carried out linear scan voltammogram (LSV) measurements to elaborate the OER performance of the metal (oxy)-hydroxide nanosheets. The tests were conducted with the iR correction at 5 mV s−1 in 1 M KOH solution employing a three-electrode electrolytic cell. For comparison, the performance of commercial IrO2 was also examined. Firstly, the OER performances of FeCo-PB, FeCo-PB-H2O2 and FeCo-PB-NaClO are shown in Fig. S14,† which indicates that stepwise chemical oxidation would slightly increase the OER activity of FeCo-PB. Fig. 4a shows that CoOOH nanosheets could acquire 10 mA cm−2 current at the potential of only 1.583 V, that is 0.04 V lower than that of CoOOH bulk, which showed the benefits of the nanosheet structure and oxygen vacancies. The overpotentials at 10 and 100 mA cm−2 of CoOOH nanosheets (353 and 471 mV) further decreased to 252 and 298 mV after Fe3+ doping, which were much lower than those of most state-of-the-art IrO2 (310 mV) and other Co-based electrocatalysts (Tables S1†). The turnover frequency (TOF) of FeCoOOH nanosheets was much higher than that of other materials (Fig. S15†), suggesting enhanced OER kinetics. The bigger metal oxidation wave at the potential of ca. 1.37 V for FeCoOOH nanosheets, suggests their better water oxidation ability compared to CoOOH nanosheets, as previously reported in other (oxy)-hydroxide nanosheets.31 Mn and Ni were also doped into CoOOH nanosheets by the stepwise oxidation processes, and both showed an enhanced OER performance compared to CoOOH nanosheets (Fig. S16†), but were inferior to FeCoOOH nanosheets. The excellent catalytic activity of the FeCoOOH nanosheets was also reflected by the low Tafel slope (61.8 mV dec−1), in comparison with that of CoOOH nanosheets (119.7 mV dec−1), CoOOH bulk (141.3 mV dec−1) and IrO2 (96.0 mV dec−1), demonstrating the most rapid electrochemical kinetics (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the potential increased by only 15 mV after galvanostatic electrolysis at 10 mA cm−2 for 40 h in 1 M KOH electrolyte on FeCoOOH nanosheets, indicating extraordinary stability (Fig. 4c). To check the evolution of structure and components, XRD, TEM, SEM and XPS were conducted. It is found that after a long-term OER test, the β-CoOOH phase still remained (Fig. S17†) but the diffraction signals from XRD weakened, which may be due to the presence of Nafion binder and/or the partial amorphization of FeCoOOH nanosheets during long-term tests. XPS spectra revealed a significant decrease in the intensity of both Co and Fe after the OER stability tests (Fig. S18†), which may also come from the partial coverage with Nafion binder on the FeCoOOH nanosheets after the OER test, as evidenced by the subsequent SEM and TEM images (Fig. S19†). Meanwhile, SEM and TEM images (see Fig. S19a and S19b†) showed that the structure of the nanosheets could be maintained after long-term tests, manifesting the good morphological stability of the FeCoOOH catalyst. The faradaic efficiency for the OER was assessed by analyses of the theoretical and experimental amount of evolved O2 gas as quantified by the water drainage method. Galvanostatic electrolysis at a fixed current (10 mA cm−2) was carried out for 1 h to generate sufficient O2 for measurement. The electrochemical station had recorded 36 C of passing charges, leading to the generation of 2.0 mL of O2. Consequently, the faradaic efficiency was as high as 96% based on the 4e− reaction process. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was first analyzed to investigate the modulation effects of dopants and defects. It is known that the ECSA should be linearly proportional to the double layer capacitance (Cd). The FeCoOOH nanosheets had a Cd value of 0.0160 mF from CV tests (Fig. S20 and 21†), close to that of CoOOH nanosheets (0.0176 mF), suggesting their similar ECSA.44 Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was also conducted. The corresponding fitting curves as shown in Fig. 4d are elliptical semicircles for both as a result of the roughened surface structure. FeCoOOH displayed a pronounced decrease in the contact resistance (Rs = 2.15 Ω) and charge transfer resistance (RCT = 2.81 Ω), much better than those of CoOOH (Rs = 2.60 Ω, RCT = 11.5 Ω). This indicates the enhanced electric conductivity and faster charge transfer processes with Fe doping.45 All the results above suggested that the superior OER activity of FeCoOOH nanosheets should be ascribed to the enhancement of intrinsic activity by atom modulation.

Encouraged by the excellent OER performance of FeCoOOH nanosheets, we have further assessed their potential application for water splitting by testing in an assembled two-electrode electrolyzer. MoNi4/MoO2/NF was synthesized as a noble metal-free cathode for the HER to replace commercial Pt–C (Fig. S22†) and FeCoOOH nanosheets were loaded on NF as the anode for the OER. The LSV curve of the electrolyzer shows that only voltages as low as 1.50 and 1.57 V were required to obtain a current of 10 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively (see Fig. 5a). During the water splitting at 100 mA cm−2, H2 and O2 bubbles are clearly found from the optical photo (inset in Fig. 5a). This excellent performance is comparable to most of the advanced materials reported recently (see Table S2†). Furthermore, the commercial planar polycrystalline Si solar cells could power this water electrolyzer. This solar cell-driven water splitting under the illumination of chopped simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) showed a current output of about 105 mA cm−2 with negligible decay after 3600 s of continuous operation (Fig. 5b). The solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (ηSHE) reached up to 10.5% using FeCoOOH-NF as the anode, demonstrating the feasibility of using the as-synthesized FeCoOOH nanosheets as the OER electrocatalyst in a practical unbiased solar-driven water splitting setup.

Conclusions
In summary, we report a unique stepwise chemical oxidation approach for preparing ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets with a modulated atomic structure. In the process, H2O2 oxidant etched the edges and corners of FeCo-PB nanocubes accompanied by phase transition; further oxidation by NaClO resulted in structural reconstruction into ultrathin CoOOH nanosheets, with a uniform thickness of ∼4.0 nm and abundant oxygen vacancies. This method was further extended to the synthesis of Fe, Mn, and Ni-doped CoOOH nanosheets. Among them the ultrathin FeCoOOH nanosheets exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 252 mV (at 10 mA cm−2), a Tafel slope as low as 61.8 mV dec−1, as well as high long-term stability during the OER. The application of ultrathin FeCoOOH nanosheets as the anode in a solar-driven water splitting setup demonstrated a stable solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency as high as 10.5%. This work not only demonstrates atom-modulated metal oxyhydroxide nanosheets for OER applications, but also provides a new and facile stepwise chemical oxidation strategy for potentially scalable preparation of ultrathin metal (oxy)-hydroxide nanosheets.
