    , Accepted 5th November 2020First published on 6th November 2020AbstractEnergy storage devices with the merits of low cost and high energy/power densities (e.g., sodium/potassium ion batteries and hybrid capacitors) have recently drawn increasing interest due to their unique advantages as promising candidates for grid-level applications. However, the relatively larger K+/Na+ radius generally causes sluggish ion diffusion kinetics and inferior cycling stability. Herein, we realize the synergy of Sn cluster incorporation and nitrogen doping into a carbonaceous hierarchical nanosheet-assembly (denoted as c-SnNC-HNA) through a scalable one-pot strategy based on a supramolecular formation process, which can act as a universal alkali metal ion storage host with remarkable specific capacity and outstanding cycling performance. Specifically, a high specific capacity (411.4/386.2/1065.4 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 for K+/Na+/Li+, respectively) and ultra-stable cycling capability can be obtained (74.8% retention rate for K+ after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1; almost 100% retention rate for Na+ after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1). The underlying mechanism is investigated based on ex situ XPS, in situ Raman analysis and GITT measurements. Importantly, potassium ion hybrid capacitors based on the c-SnNC-HNA anode can deliver a decent energy/power density of 112.5 W h kg−1/49.1 W kg−1 and exhibit superior cycling stability up to 10 K cycles at 2000 mA g−1.
1. Introduction
The consistently growing energy demand is the irresistible trend to meet the development of the modern society and human civilization, while the current fossil fuel dominated energy framework has caused non-negligible environmental concerns, which has violently propelled the research on exploiting renewable energy based techniques.1,2 It is then imperative to develop low cost yet high energy storage devices in order to tackle the intrinsic disadvantages of uneven distribution and intermittency for various renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and water. Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have made great success on portable electronics and electric vehicle markets, the rapidly increasing cost of Li resources has become a huge obstacle for future grid-level applications.3–5 In this context, developing practicable energy storage devices beyond Li has recently gained tremendous interest. Owing to the natural abundance, and low cost and being an electrochemical analogue to Li, potassium/sodium (K/Na) based energy storage devices, such as potassium/sodium ion batteries (KIBs/NIBs) and hybrid capacitors (KIHCs/NIHCs), are drawing increasing attention as alternative candidates to LIBs.6–8 However, the much larger K+/Na+ radius (1.38/0.98 Å) compared with that of Li+ (0.68 Å), generally causes seriously sluggish ion diffusion kinetics and inferior cycling stability, which put forward high requirement on the composition, morphology and dimension of electrode materials.9,10 Therefore, it is one of the central tasks to develop suitable anode materials for K+ and Na+ storage with high reversible capacity and promising cycling stability through a rational design strategy. Moreover, hybrid capacitor devices require outstanding high-rate cycling capability of anode materials in order to match the kinetic balance of the capacitive behavior of the cathode, which is one of the remaining bottleneck issues.11,12
Carbon based materials possessing the features of low cost, high physicochemical stability and electrical conductivity, hold great promise as a class of anode candidates for various energy storage systems.13–16 However, the much more sluggish K+/Na+ intercalation kinetics and limited theoretical capacity compared to that of Li+ storage have become the major obstacle for future practical applications.17,18 Generally, there are two approaches, i.e. advanced micro-/nanostructure design and heteroatom doping, to optimize the electrochemical behavior of carbon based anode materials.17 It has been demonstrated that building micro-/nanostructures could shorten the ion diffusion path, introduce more active sites by increasing defects and better alleviate the volume change, while heteroatom doping could enhance the intercalation kinetics and modify the electronic structure, which could both benefit the electrochemical performance enhancement in different ways.17 For instance, Share et al. demonstrated that nitrogen doping could largely increase the potassium ion storage capacity of graphite, due to the modified electronic structure with a particularly high affinity for the electron from a nearby K atom.19 Chen and coworkers reported that nitrogen doped carbon microspheres could enhance potassium adsorption capability and improve electronic and ionic conductivities, which exhibited enhanced potassium ion storage properties.20 Although these inspiring achievements, there are still some remaining challenging tasks. Firstly, the current heteroatom doping strategy mainly focused on non-metal elements including P, N or S, which is difficult to achieve satisfactory capacity enhancement. It is expected to further increase the ion storage capacity with the incorporation of electrochemical active metals with much higher theoretical capacities, such as Sb (660/660 mA h g−1 for Na+/K+),21,22 Bi (385/385 mA h g−1 for Na+/K+)23,24 and Sn (847/226 mA h g−1 for Na+/K+).21,25 To the best of our knowledge, the simultaneous incorporation of Sn clusters and nitrogen doping into carbon based nanostructures, and the influence of a small amount of electrochemical active metal elements on carbon materials have rarely been noticed until now. Moreover, K+ based battery-capacitor type devices are of broad interest yet undeveloped until now although Na+ hybrid capacitors have been much investigated.1,26,27
Herein, we realize the synergy of Sn cluster incorporation and nitrogen doping into a carbonaceous hierarchical nanosheet-assembly (denoted as c-SnNC-HNA) through a supramolecular formation directed one-pot strategy followed by subsequent calcination, which exhibits great potential as a universal alkali metal ion host with high reversible capacity and an outstanding lifespan. Specifically, it can deliver high specific capacities of 357.3, 360.9 and 1326.7 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.1 A g−1 for K+, Na+ and Li+ storage, respectively. Moreover, it can also maintain decent storage capacity and ultra-stable cycling capability at high rates (74.8% retention rate for K+ after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1; almost 100% retention rate for Na+ after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1; almost 100% retention rate for Li+ after 500 cycles at 2 A g−1). More importantly, potassium ion hybrid capacitors (KIHCs) based on the c-SnNC-HNA anode and activated carbon (AC) cathode can deliver a decent energy/power density of 112.5 W h kg−1/49.1 W kg−1 and exhibit superior cycling stability up to 10 K cycles at 2 A g−1, demonstrating their great potential for practical applications.
2. Results and discussion
The formation process of c-SnNC-HNA can be schematically illustrated as shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, 4 mmol of melamine and certain amounts of SnCl2·2H2O were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is then mixed with an equal amount of cyanuric acid in DMSO to generate the precipitate of the precursor based on the supramolecular assembly (denoted as Sn-MCA). The final product can be obtained by convenient thermal annealing treatment under an Ar atmosphere. For convenience, we use “x” to represent the amount of SnCl2·2H2O and “y” to represent the annealing temperature of the sample (denoted as c-SnNC-HNAx/y). For example, c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 represents the sample with the addition of 0.75 mmol SnCl2·2H2O and annealed at 800 °C.
 Scheme 1  The illustration of the formation process of the c-SnNC-HNA hybrid nanostructures. 
The morphology and microstructure of the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 particle are studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. Fig. 1A and B display the FESEM and TEM images of the Sn-MCA precursors, where the interesting oblate sphere-like particles composed of the sheet-like assembly with average diameters ranging from 1.5–2 μm can be obtained. After high temperature carbonization, the overall morphological feature of the nanosheet-assembly spheres can be almost inherited from the Sn-MCA precursors, as shown in Fig. 1C–E. An enlarged view (Fig. 1F) clearly indicates that the thickness of the nanosheets in c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 is much smaller than that of precursors. Moreover, it's noteworthy that the Sn particle can be barely identified, which is in accordance with the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) results in Fig. 1G. As for the carbon matrix, the interplanar spacing is enlarged from 0.338 nm to 0.350 nm based on the Bragg equation according to the XRD results, corresponding to the sample without Sn precursor addition (denoted as NC800) and c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800, respectively. We calculate an empirical R value (Fig. S1, ESI†) based on the intensity ratio of the (002) and background at the equivalent peak,28 where the lower R value suggests a lower degree of graphitization. As indicated, the R value decreases from 2.02 to 1.98 after Sn incorporation, suggesting the lower graphitization degree of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800, which is confirmed by the higher ID/IG ratio (∼1.08 vs. ∼1.02 for c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800vs. NC800) in the Raman spectrum shown in Fig. 1H. As demonstrated above, it can be claimed that the interplanar spacing is enlarged and more defect sites are generated upon Sn incorporation, which could be beneficial for ion diffusion kinetics.17 The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and corresponding pore size distribution of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 (Fig. 1I) indicate a high specific surface area of 416.2 m2 g−1 and a hierarchical porous structure with sizes ranging from about 2 to 50 nm which is considered to be advantageous for mass transportation during the electrochemical process.29

The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 is further conducted as shown in Fig. 1J and S2 (ESI†), which confirms that the incorporated Sn clusters are uniformly distributed on the carbon matrix with average sizes smaller than 5 nm. The interplanar spacing of the lattice fringes (Fig. 1K) are calculated to be 0.28 nm corresponding to the (101) lattice plane of Sn (JCPDS no. 04-0673). Moreover, the carbon matrix in c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 showed disordered and defect rich structures, which could not only perform as active sites for ion storage, but also facilitate the permeation of electrolyte and promoted contact with the Sn clusters.30Fig. 1L shows the elemental mapping results, which confirm that the C, N and Sn elements are uniformly dispersed throughout the sample. The weight ratio of Sn in c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 (Fig. S3, ESI†) is calculated to be about 22.9%.
In addition, the control samples treated at different temperatures (c-SnNC-HNA0.75/700 and c-SnNC-HNA0.75/900) and with different amounts of SnCl2·2H2O (c-SnNC-HNA0.5/800 and c-SnNC-HNA1/800) are also investigated, where the Sn particles grow in size with increasing the treating temperature (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†) or increasing the amount of SnCl2·2H2O (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). Moreover, the samples treated at different temperatures and with different amounts of SnCl2·2H2O share similar Raman results and porous structures (Fig. S8–S11, ESI†). It is worth mentioning that only irregular carbonaceous nanosheets can be obtained without Sn addition (Fig. S12, ESI†), suggesting its critical function on hierarchical structure maintenance.
The surface chemical states of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 and NC800 are investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. As shown in Fig. 2A, the survey spectrum showed that c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 consisted of C, N and Sn with atomic contents of 73.9%, 25.0% and 1.0%, respectively. As for NC800, only C and N elements can be detected with an atomic ratio of about 80.9% and 19.1%, respectively. The existence of oxygen species can be attributed to the absorbed oxygen from the ambient environment. The high resolution C 1s spectrum (Fig. 2B) can be deconvoluted into CC/C–C (284.7 eV), CN (285.8 eV), CO (287.1 eV) and COOH (288.9 eV) bonds, respectively. The existence of CN bonds indicates the successful doping of the heteroatom in carbon.31 The binding energy of CN bonds is slightly shifted to a lower position after Sn incorporation (from 286.1 to 285.8 eV), which may be due to the electron transfer from Sn to CN bonds through N species. As shown in Fig. 2C, the Sn 3d spectrum can be deconvoluted into Sn 3d5/2 at 486.6 eV and Sn 3d3/2 at 495.0 eV, respectively. The binding energy of Sn 3d is higher than that of Sn0 (484.9 eV), indicating that the Sn cluster exists in an oxidative state and is possibly bonded with nitrogen species in the carbon matrix.32 The N 1s spectrum (Fig. 2D) can be deconvoluted into pyridinic N (398.3 eV), pyrrolic N (399.5 eV), graphitic N (401.0 eV) and N–Sn (397.5 eV). The pyridinic N and pyrrolic N could serve as electrochemical active sites by absorbing K+/Na+/Li+ through surface-induced capacitive processes, and the graphitic N could contribute to the electronic conductivity of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 caused by its electron-donor characteristics.33–35 Noteworthily, the binding energy of N 1s is slightly shifted to a lower position due to the existence of N–Sn bonds in the hybrid structure, confirming the strong coupling effect between the Sn cluster and N species in c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800, which is in line with the oxidative state of the Sn as confirmed by the XPS results. The XPS results for the products obtained with different treating temperatures are similar (Fig. S13, ESI†).

The potassium ion storage performance of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 is firstly investigated in a half cell configuration using potassium metal as the counter and reference electrodes. Fig. 3A shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves recorded between 0.01 and 3 V (vs. K/K+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. As indicated, a notable irreversible peak can be observed at around 0.62 V in the first cathodic scan, possibly due to the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI),36 which is consistent with the plateau centered at 0.62 V in the first discharge curve (Fig. S14, ESI†). After that, a strong cathodic peak below 0.2 V could be associated with the alloying reaction between Sn and K, together with the intercalation of K+ into the carbon matrix.17 As for the first anodic scan, two distinct peaks at 0.59 V and 1.32 V could be assigned to the step-by-step depotassiation processes from the host.37–39 The subsequent CV curves overlapped with each other, demonstrating the good reversibility of the insertion/extraction of K+ into/from the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 host. Fig. 3B displays the charge/discharge profiles of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 at 100 mA g−1 between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. K/K+), where a pseudo-linear voltage response can be obtained, suggesting the possible fast ion storage kinetics. As an important descriptor for electrode materials, the cycling stability of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 for K+ storage is then evaluated at various current densities. As indicated in Fig. 3C, it can maintain a capacity retention rate of 90.7% after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1 (324.2 at the 200th cycle vs. 357.3 at the 10th cycle), besides the capacity decay during the first few cycles, which delivers better potassium ion storage capability and cycling stability than NC800. Moreover, better cycling performance of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 can also be attained at 1 A g−1 (Fig. S15, ESI†).

As we know, high rate cycling stability is a necessary requirement of appropriate anode candidates for hybrid capacitors. Prior to high rates, the electrodes are cycled at 500 mA g−1 and the current density is increased in steps to form a uniform and compact SEI, which is beneficial for high rate performance. Excitingly, our c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 electrode exhibits an ultra-small fading rate of 0.06‰ during 4000 cycles even at 5000 mA g−1 (129.2 at the 4000th cycle vs. 172.8 at the 10th cycle) (Fig. 3D and S16, ESI†), which is outstanding compared with recent literature regarding carbonaceous based electrode materials for K+ storage (Table S1, ESI†). c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 also shows remarkable rate performance with an impressive retention rate of 42.9% with the current density increasing from 100 to 5000 mA g−1 (152.8 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1vs. 355.9 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1), as shown in Fig. 3E and F, which is much higher compared to that of NC800 (31.5%). In addition, c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 also shows the best potassium ion storage performance among the samples at various temperatures and amounts of SnCl2·2H2O (Fig. S18 and S19, ESI†).
The K+ storage kinetics of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 is then studied based on CV curves at various scan rates, as shown in Fig. 3G. On the basis of the power law (eqn (1)) proposed by Dunn and coworkers,40 the qualitative and quantitative analysis of capacitive contributions of the total stored charge can be obtained from the relationship of the peak current (i) vs. scan rate (v) from CV curves at various scan rates. i = avb = k1v + k2v1/2(1) logi = blogv + loga(2) (3)where i obeys a power relationship with v, k1v represents the capacitive behavior induced current response and k2v1/2 represents the diffusion-controlled current response. Both a and b are constant, where the b value can be calculated from the slope of the linear relationship of log(i) vs. log(v) (eqn (2)). Theoretically, when the b value equals to 0.5, it is a total diffusion controlled process, while it shows a capacitive behavior when it is close to 1.41 The b values of the cathodic and anodic peaks of the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 electrode are 0.96 and 0.91 (Fig. S20, ESI†), respectively, implying the capacitive behavior induced current response accounting for the major part of the total charge storage. After that, the capacitive contribution of the total stored charge at different scan rates is sketched out based on eqn (3) (Fig. 3H). Noteworthily, a high capacitive contribution ratio of 83.6% can be obtained at 0.9 mV s−1, proving the superior rate and cycling performance. Compared with the NC800 electrode (capacitive contribution ratio of 76.1% at 0.9 mV s−1), c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 displayed enhanced capacitive contribution, which is thought to be due to the Sn cluster incorporation as mentioned above (Fig. S21, ESI†).
In order to demonstrate its capability as a universal host for alkali ions, sodium ion and lithium ion storage performances are further evaluated in half-cell configurations. Fig. 4 shows the sodium ion storage performance of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 using metallic sodium as the counter and reference electrodes. Fig. 4A displays the CV curves measured between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. A distinct irreversible peak at 1.0 V during the initial cathodic scan is due to the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of the SEI layer. Besides, a notable peak below 0.2 V can be assigned to the formation of the Sn–Na alloy and the intercalation of Na+ into the carbon matrix. For the first anodic scan, two distinct peaks at 0.41 and 1.28 V could be assigned to the step-by-step desodiation processes from the host.25 The galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles obtained at 100 mA g−1 for the first few cycles (Fig. 4B and S23, ESI†), exhibit a pseudo-linear voltage response and coincide with each other after the initial cycle, implying high reversibility. Notably, an initial reversible specific capacity of 386.2 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 can be achieved for Na+ storage, which is lower than that of K+ storage (411.4 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1). This could be due to the thermodynamically unstable character between Na and the carbon substrate, which leads to a weak chemical bonding between them, further resulting in the experimentally lower storage capacity for Na+ despite its smaller radius compared to K+.42 The cycling stability of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 is then measured at various current densities of 100, 500 and 5000 mA g−1, as shown in Fig. 4C, D and S25 in the ESI,† respectively. As can be seen, it can maintain a high capacity of 326.9/307.5 mA h g−1 after 200/500 cycles when cycled at 100/500 mA g−1, respectively, leading to outstanding capacity retention rates of 91.0%/100%. More impressively, even when cycled at a high rate of 5000 mA g−1 after the pre-cycle process, the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 anode can still maintain a decent specific capacity of 180.5 mA h g−1 with almost 100% capacity retention after 4000 cycles, indicating ultra-stable cycling performance. The c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 electrode can also achieve excellent rate performance, as shown in Fig. 4E and F, where a retention rate of 38.7% can be obtained with the current density increasing from 100 to 10000 mA g−1 (332.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1vs. 128.7 mA h g−1 for 10000 mA g−1). Importantly, the specific capacity goes back to 330.7 mA h g−1 when the current density is set back to 100 mA g−1, showing remarkable recoverability of the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 electrode. In addition, the sodium storage kinetics of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 is also investigated with an identical method to that of potassium storage, as shown in Fig. 4G, H and S26 (ESI†); the calculated b-values are 0.89 and 0.92 for cathodic and anodic processes, respectively, implying capacitive-controlled storage behavior. The capacitive contribution is about 61.8% at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1, which gradually increases with increasing scan rates and reaches 81.0% at 0.9 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 27 (ESI†) and 4H, the sodium storage kinetics of NC800 are also measured, which delivered a much lower b value and capacitive contribution than c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800, manifesting the significance of Sn cluster incorporation for capacitive contribution.

(A) CV curves at 0.1 mV s−1, (B) charge/discharge profiles at 100 mA g−1, (C) cycling stability at 100 mA g−1, (D) cycling stability at 5000 mA g−1, (E) rate capability, (F) charge/discharge profiles at various currents, (G) CV curves and (H) capacitive contributions. 

Fig. 5 displays the lithium ion storage performance in half-cell configuration with lithium metal as the counter and reference electrodes. Fig. 5A shows the CV curves measured between 0.01 and 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. A distinct irreversible peak at 0.61 V during the initial cathodic scan could be caused by the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of the SEI layer. Besides, a notable peak below 0.1 V should be related to the formation of the Sn–Li alloy and the intercalation of Li+ into the carbon matrix. For the first anodic scan, two distinct peaks at 0.4 V and 1.18 V could be assigned to the step-by-step delithiation processes from the host.43 The initial few galvanostatic charge/discharge curves at 100 mA g−1 are displayed in Fig. 5B and S28 (ESI†), showing a pseudo-linear voltage response and affirming the capacitive behaviors. The cycling performances are tested at 100, 500 and 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 5C, D and S29 in the ESI†), where a specific capacity of 1505/1326.7/651.8 mA h g−1 after 50/300/500 cycles with negligible capacity fading can be observed, indicating superior cycling stability. The increase in capacity with cycling could be attributed to the activation process of the active species in the hybrid.44Fig. 5E and F show the rate performance of the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 electrode, which delivers a capacity retention rate of 41.3% upon the current density increasing from 100 to 5000 mA g−1 (1373.3 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1vs. 568.0 mA h g−1 at 5000 mA g−1). Importantly, the capacity returns to 1493.0 mA h g−1 when the current density decreases to 100 mA g−1, showing remarkable reversibility for lithium ion storage. As presented above, c-SnNC-HNA exhibits universal alkali metal ion storage performance when evaluated as anodes for KIBs, NIBs and LIBs with outstanding cycling stability and rate performance. It is worth mentioning that the initial coulombic efficiency of the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 anode is unsatisfactory possibly due to the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) films and the existing irreversible side reactions, which could be disadvantageous for practical applications when assembling full cell devices.45 It has been demonstrated that the prepotassiation/presodiation/prelithiation techniques are effective approaches to deal with this problem for practical applications.45–47

In order to uncover the possible origins for the enhanced electrochemical performance of the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 electrode, we further conduct ex situ XPS, in situ Raman and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements in the case of K+ storage as a typical example. Fig. 6A shows the comparison of the XPS spectra of pristine and fully discharged electrodes in half cell configuration. As displayed, the emerged K peaks at a fully discharged state can be assigned to C–O–K/COO–K/N–K (293.1 eV), metallic K (294.1 and 296.4 eV) and KCx (293.6 eV), respectively.29,48 Specifically, the existence of C–O–K/COOK/NK corresponds to the intensity reduction of the COOH group in C 1s spectra and pyridinic-N species in the N 1s spectrum, while the formation of KCx is consistent with the reduction of C–C/CC peaks and the shift to lower positions of C 1s spectra, suggesting the absorption and intercalation process of potassium onto the carbon matrix. Besides, the full width at half maximum of the C 1s peak also decreases due to the reduction of the COOH and CN groups upon the absorption and intercalation of K+. Moreover, the appearance of metallic K peaks is due to the formation of the tin-potassium alloy during the alloying process, which can also be proved by the shift of the Sn 3d peak to higher binding energy. Furthermore, as displayed in Fig. 6B, in situ Raman analysis is also carried out with charge/discharge at 100 mA g−1 for the first cycle. When discharged to 0.01 V, the G peak becomes broader and has a red shift from 1591 to 1547 cm−1 with the ID:IG ratio decreasing from 0.99 to 0.87, corresponding to the intercalation of K+.49,50 When the charging process started, the position of the G peak and the ID:IG ratio gradually recover to their original one with the depotassiation of K+, indicating reversible structural stability. These results could suggest that there are multiple active sites existing in the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 hybrid structure, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 6C, which could significantly contribute to the high specific capacity. In details, the pyridinic N, existing in the defect or at the edge of the carbon plane by replacing a carbon atom with a nitrogen atom, is ready to get an electron from the adjacent K atom, thus acting as active sites for potassium storage.50 Besides, the functional groups of COOH could also function as a redox site to store potassium ions by converting into COOK. Moreover, the Sn cluster can easily facilitate the alloying reaction with K+ due to the enhanced electronic conductivity of the carbon matrix by electron-donor characteristics of graphitic N.

Besides the feature of multiple active sites, the advantage of the storage kinetics for c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 is also investigated by comparing the K+ diffusion constant (DK+) based on GITT measurements, as shown in Fig. 6D. Intuitively, the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 electrode displays a smaller overpotential than NC800, indicating possible faster diffusion kinetics.50,51 As shown in Fig. 6E and F, the calculated DK+ of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 based on eqn (S4) and (S5) (ESI),† is a much higher value than that of NC800 electrodes, possibly owing to the fast charge storage reaction furnished by uniformly distributed Sn clusters and the increased interplanar spacing and defect sites. In addition, the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 electrode has smaller Rct and σω values than the NC800 electrode (Fig. S31 and S32, ESI†), indicating better mass and electron transfer kinetics at the interface of the electrode/electrolyte, which could further contribute to the enhanced electrochemical performance.
In order to prove the promising practicability, KIHCs using the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800 anode and active carbon (AC) cathode (denoted as c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800//AC) with an optimized mass ratio of 1:3 are investigated (Fig. S33–S35, ESI†). The working principle of the KIHCs can be schematically illustrated in Fig. 7A, in which the charge/discharge process corresponds to the adsorption/desorption of FSI− ions on/from the surface of the AC cathode through the electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) mechanism and the potassiation/depotassiation of the c-SnNC-HNA anode.52 The CV curves of the device (Fig. S36, ESI†) are tested in various voltage windows (0.1–3.0, 0.1–3.5, 0.1–4.0 V) at 0.5 mV s−1 in order to confirm the optimized working potential of the device. Specifically, as the voltage window is set between 0.1 and 4.0 V, the CV curves of c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800//AC devices display an acute current response increasing in the range of 3.5–4.0 V, which is thought to be due to the possible side reaction, i.e. the decomposition of the electrolyte, indicating the mismatching of the voltage window.29 When the voltage window is set between 0.1–3.0 and 0.1–3.5 V, the CV curves of three c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800//AC devices display rectangular shapes overlaid with pseudo-capacitive hump peaks, which is due to the battery-type alloying/insertion mechanism for the anode material and the EDLC mechanism for the cathode material, indicating the optimized voltage window.53,54 Noteworthily, because c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800//AC could reach a higher energy density in a higher voltage window, 0.1–3.5 V is selected as the most suitable voltage window for the following measurements.

Fig. 7B displays the charge/discharge profiles of the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800//AC device at various current densities calculated based on the total mass of both the cathode and anode, showing a slight deviation from the linear relationship of the voltage vs. charging/discharging time with negligible IR drops, as a result of the different charge storage mechanisms.31 The discharge capacity is calculated to be 120.0, 97.2, 63.4, 49.5, 44.1 and 35.0 mA h g−1 corresponding to current densities of 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2500 mA g−1, respectively. The Ragone plot of the device can then be calculated, as shown in Fig. 7C, where a maximum energy density of 112.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 49.1 W kg−1 can be obtained. Even at a ultrahigh power density of 7369.0 W kg−1, a satisfactory energy density of 14.47 W h kg−1 can still be maintained, which is superior compared to recent literature about KIHCs24,54,55 and is even competitive compared to recent results about NIHCs.36,40,54–57 The maximum energy/power density of 111.15 W h kg−1/7356.29 W kg−1 based on the total mass of the anode and cathode demonstrates that it can act as the bridge device for LIBs and capacitors indicating the-state-of-the-art performance (Fig. S38, ESI†). Remarkably, the c-SnNC-HNA0.75/800//AC device also exhibits excellent long term cycling stability, as shown in Fig. 7D, where a capacity retention rate of 97.6% after 10000 cycles at 500 mA g−1 can be achieved.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have realized the synergy of Sn cluster incorporation and nitrogen doping into a carbonaceous hierarchical nanosheet-assembly (denoted as c-SnNC-HNA) through the developed supramolecular formation directed one-pot strategy followed by conventional thermal annealing treatment, which enables universal alkali metal ion storage capability with remarkable specific capacity and superior cycling stability. The possible origins of the outstanding electrochemical performance are investigated based on ex situ XPS, in situ Raman analysis and GITT measurements, which could be attributed to the multiple active sites, unique nanostructure and high porosity. Importantly, the potential applications of the c-SnNC-HNA electrode are further demonstrated by building two-electrode full cell devices, i.e. potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (KIHCs), where high energy/power density and ultra-long cycling performance at high rates can be achieved. This work could not only shed light on the unique design principles for promising anode candidates for universal alkali metal ion storage to advance next generation cost-effective energy storage systems, but could also contribute to the development of high energy/low cost battery-capacitor-type devices.
