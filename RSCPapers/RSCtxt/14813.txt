    AbstractTwo types of conjugated polymers were prepared with the goal to blend them with rod-like CdSe nanocrystals. The polymers of the first type were synthesized through copolymerization of 3-octylthiophene and 3-methylene-ethylcarboxylate-thiophene to give polythiophene with solubilizing alkyl groups and methylene ester functional groups (PE series). Post-polymerization hydrolysis of the ester type polymers yielded acid-type ones (PA series). Photoluminescence (PL) quenching in these polymers induced by their titration with nanocrystals solution was chosen as a measure of the polymer–nanocrystal interactions. PL of polyacids turned out to be more efficiently quenched as compared to the case of polymers with ester groups which was interpreted as an indication of better electronic communication between the hybrid components. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy confirmed efficient coordination of the carboxylic groups to CdSe. Voltammetric studies combined with UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry enabled the determination of energy levels alignment of the molecular composite components which turned out to be of staggered type—appropriate for photovoltaic applications. The obtained blends of polyacids with CdSe nanocrystals, when studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), revealed the presence of an interpenetrating network in which nanorods were homogeneously distributed within the polymer matrix without any indication of agglomerates formation both on the film surface and in the cross-section. Blends with polymers containing ester groups were less homogeneous which could be explained by weaker polymer–nanocrystals interactions. Photovoltaic cells based on these hybrid materials are also discussed.
1. Introduction
Composites of electroactive polymers and semiconductor nanocrystals have become the subject of intensive research interest in the past decade, especially after the discovery that they can be used as active layers in hybrid organic–inorganic optoelectronic devices.1–4 Among them, molecular composites of solution processable polythiophene derivatives and CdSe nanocrystals deserve a special attention. Polythiophene can be functionalized with appropriate anchor functions while retaining its electroactivity, whereas the morphology of CdSe nanoparticles can be better controlled than in other related semiconductors.5
The main issue in the preparation of CdSe composites with polythiophene derivatives is the phase separation, promoted by the distinctly different chemical nature of both components of such materials.2–4,6 Several preparation strategies are exploited to impede this phenomenon with the goal to obtain composites with controlled distribution of nanocrystals within the polymer matrix. The most common approach consists of exchanging the initial nanocrystals' ligands by labile ones, for example pyridine, which are then removed during the composite processing. The nanocrystals are, in this case, stabilized by the polythiophene matrix, which in the same time prevents their aggregation.3,6 This procedure, although proven successful in the preparation of hybrid solar cell devices, has several limits: (i) it is very sensitive towards even small changes in the processing procedure which sometimes leads to serious reproducibility problems; (ii) although dispersibility of the nanocrystals in the polymer matrix is improved, still nano-aggregates can be easily found since the interactions between “bare” nanocrystals and polythiophenes, which do not contain complexing groups, are rather weak.
In another approach, both poly(thiophene)s and nanocrystals are functionalized with special groups capable of strongly interacting with each other.7 In this case, enhanced macromolecule–nanocrystal interactions efficiently impede the phase separation.8,9 Molecular composites of diaminopyrimidine side-functionalized poly(hexylthiophene)s and mercaptoalkylthymine capped CdSe nanocrystals can be considered as an instructive example of this approach in the preparation and processing of hybrid materials.10,11 Hydrogen bond assisted molecular recognition between both diaminopyrimidine and thymine groups promotes the formation of composites with uniformly distributed nanocrystals in the poly(3-hexylthiophene) matrix. The main disadvantage of this method is the necessity of functionalizing both components of the composite by complementary functional groups which significantly increase the average distance between the nanocrystals and the π-conjugated polymer chain, which in turn perturbs the charge transfer between the two partners.
Preparation of molecular composites can be simplified if nanocrystals' capping groups constitute an inherent part of the polythiophene macromolecule.8,9,12 Such molecular composites can be processed directly after the exchange of the initial surface ligands with macromolecular ones containing appropriate anchoring groups. Applying this strategy to end-functionalized polythiophenes, it was possible to significantly improve the distribution of CdSe nanocrystals in the polymer matrix compared to the standard blending approach.13–18 In such systems the interparticle distance is typically defined by the polymer chain length. Stronger interactions between the two components of the blend can also be achieved by side functionalization of the polymer with appropriate anchoring groups. To the best of our knowledge, there exist very few published examples of this type of nanocomposites. In the first case tetrahydro-4H-thiopyran-4-ylidene-functionalized polythiophene was blended with CdTe nanocrystals,7 in the second one polythiophene polymer chains with pendant carbodithioate complexing groups were blended with CdSe nanoparticles.19
Carboxylic groups are popular nanocrystals′ capping ligands. For example, it has been demonstrated that oligothiophenes substituted with a carboxylic group in the α-position can serve as efficient CdS nanocrystals′ ligands.20 Similar complexing ability should be expected from macromolecular compounds like for example polythiophenes containing lateral substituents with carboxylic terminal groups, provided that no unfavorable steric effects interfere.
The main goal of this paper is to describe the processing of molecular composites of CdSe nanocrystals and soluble polythiophene derivatives driven by nanocrystals complexation with the polymer lateral carboxylic groups. We investigate the effect of interactions of the composite constituents on their redox and spectroscopic properties, which are crucial for the composite potential applications. We also demonstrate that by using functionalized poly(thiophene)s containing octyl and methylene-carboxylic acid side groups, it is possible to obtain hybrid photovoltaic materials, where the CdSe nanocrystals are well dispersed within the polymer matrix.
2. Experimental
The reagents for the nanocrystal and copolymer synthesis were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification.

1H and 13C NMR spectra of the synthesized monomers, polymers and ligands were recorded on a Bruker AC 200 MHz and a Varian Unity 400 MHz spectrometer using chloroform-d (CDCl3) solvent containing TMS as internal standard.
Infrared spectra were obtained on a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectrometer equipped with ATR (attenuated total reflection) Pike-Miracle device. The detector was a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) working at liquid nitrogen temperature. The spectra were obtained after 256 scans at 2 cm−1 resolution.
The molecular mass of the synthesized polymers was measured by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), on a LabAlliance chromatograph equipped with a Jordi Gel DVB Mixed Bed column, using refractometric detection (RI-2000-F refractometer, CHCl3 eluent). The column temperature and the flow rate were fixed at 35 °C and 1 mL min−1, respectively. The column was calibrated using polystyrene standards provided by Polymer Standards Service.
UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the polymers and composites in solution and in the solid state were recorded on a HP 8452A spectrometer. Luminescence spectra were measured on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrometer.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the composite films were obtained on a Jeol 4000 EX microscope (400 keV). To obtain cross section images, the photovoltaic active layers were coated with a thin layer of epoxy then detached from the glass substrate by dissolving the PEDOT:PSS layer in water with sonication. The layers were then embedded in an epoxy resin (Struers Epofix) and cut into thin slices (thickness approx. 90 nm) with an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC 6 fitted with an Ultra 35° diamond knife). The cross section layers were observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) using a Hitachi 5500 STEM operated at 30 kV in bright field mode.
For UV-vis-NIR spectroelectrochemical studies thin polymer or composite films were deposited on an ITO transparent working electrode by spin-casting from chloroform. The spectroelectrochemical experiments were carried out in 0.1 M Bu4NBF4/acetonitrile electrolyte, using a specially designed one compartment electrochemical cell equipped with a Pt counter-electrode and an Ag/0.1 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile as a reference electrode. UV-vis-NIR spectra were obtained on a Cary 5000 (Varian) spectrometer (wavelength range 300–2500 nm). All spectroelectrochemical experiments were performed on an Autolab potentiostat (Eco Chemie).
2.1. Synthesis

Poly(3-octyl-2,5-thienylene-co-3-methylene-ethylcarboxylate-2,5-thienylene) (PE). 

PE was obtained by copolymerization of 3-octylthiophene (3OT) and ethyl-3-thiopheneacetate (3ETA) (see Scheme 1) using the method described in detail in ref. 21. Two initial co-monomer ratios were used: 3OT:3ETA = 1:1 and 3OT:3ETA = 2:1 to give PE1 and PE2 of the formulae represented in Scheme 1. The comonomer ratios in the resulting polymers were determined from the integration of the 1H NMR peaks at 0.87 and 4.19 ppm, corresponding to the methyl group of the alkyl substituent and the methylene group adjacent to oxygen in the ester substituent. 1H NMR (CDCl3, ppm): PE1−6.98 (m, H thiophene); 4.19 (CH2 ethyl); 3.79; 3.60; 2.79; 2.55; 1.69; 1.28; 0.87 (CH3).

CdSe nanocrystals. 
Nanorods (23 × 6.5 nm) were prepared following the procedure reported by Aldakov et al.23 In a typical preparation CdO (105 mg) and dodecylphosphonic acid (464 mg) were placed into a 3-neck flask, then trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) (4 mL) melt was added, and the mixture was heated to 260 °C for 1.5 h under Ar and stirring. At the end of complexation, the solution became homogeneous and transparent. TOPSe (2 mL, 0.8M Se) was then rapidly injected and the solution was heated for another 10 min. Nanorods were twice precipitated with MeOH from the cooled solution, then centrifuged, decanted and finally redispersed with CHCl3.

2.2. Nanocrystal ligand exchange and hybrid material preparation
Pyridine coated nanorods were obtained by dispersing TOPO coated nanocrystals in pyridine. The solution was then stirred and heated at 110 °C for 10 min to allow ligand exchange. Hexane was added to the cooled solution to precipitate the pyridine coated nanocrystals. The solution was centrifuged and decanted. The separated nanorods where then redispersed in a CHCl3:pyridine mixture (v:v 9:1). Concentration of the solution was determined by weighing the dry residue obtained from a known volume of the solution.
The pyridine coated nanocrystals' solutions were used afterwards for the photoluminescence quenching experiments by adding known volumes of the solution (10 mg mL−1) to a solution of the PA or PE copolymer (0.4 mg mL−1). Based on the SEC results and using the derived average molecular weight, we estimate the concentration of the copolymer solution to be 10 μM. For the pyridine coated CdSe nanorods used in this work, we estimate a molecular weight of approx. 2.500 kg mol−1, consequently the concentration of the nanocrystals' solutions used for the titration (10 mg ml−1) is approx. 4 μM.
For the preparation of the hybrid materials, the nanocrystal solution in CHCl3:pyridine was mixed with the polymer solution of similar concentration in chloroform. Typically, the absolute concentration in the cosolution was 6–10 mg ml−1. Alternatively, hybrid materials were obtained by using directly as synthesized nanocrystals provided that sufficient time, typically a few hours, was left to allow the functional polymer to replace the TOPO capping ligands. In this work, we used both methods. For TEM studies, thin films of the hybrid materials were prepared by spin-casting the cosolution on a freshly cleaved NaCl crystal, then floating the film in deionized water and finally picking it up with a TEM copper grid.
2.3. Solar device preparation and characterization
Preparation of the solar cell devices were performed at the French National Institute for Solar Energy, INES, Chambéry. The structure of the fabricated cells was as follows: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer (60–90 nm)/LiF(1.3 nm)/Al (70 nm). The devices with deposited active layer were annealed at 150 °C for 30 min before the cathode evaporation. Illuminated surface of a PV device was 28 mm2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and studies in solution
The synthetic route to polythiophene derivatives containing an acid function (PA) generally follows the methodology proposed by Buga et al.21 and is shown in Scheme 1. It involves oxidative copolymerization of the ester monomer with 3-octylthiophene followed by post-polymerization hydrolysis22 of the intermediate ester-functionalized polymer (PE) to give the polyacid form, containing lateral carboxylic groups capable of nanocrystals' surface complexation. This two step procedure, with ester derivatives of thiophene as monomer, is highly recommended. The main reason is connected with the potential of the monomer oxidation to its radical cation form, which initiates the oxidative polymerization. The presence of a carboxylic group significantly increases this potential and this increase is not totally compensated even in cases where the carboxylic group is separated from the ring by an alkylene spacer.24 As a result, the polymerization process is difficult to control because the monomer oxidation potential overlaps with the onset of the polymer oxidative degradation. Ester substituents show much less pronounced effect on the π-electron density at the Cα coupling position of the thiophene ring and by consequence on the potential of the radical cation formation which constitutes the initial polymerization step. For this reason the oxidative polymerization of the ester derivatives can be carried out in milder conditions assuring better control of the polymerization process. The polymer containing ester substituents can be easily converted into the desired polyacid form by post-polymerization hydrolysis with high yield as proven by spectroscopic studies of the post-functionalisation product.
Two statistical copolymers PA1 and PA2 with a different copolymerization ratio were obtained by varying the initial monomers proportion. PA2 is expected to have higher solubility because of the higher content of octylthiophene units, while PA1 possesses more functional groups for grafting to the nanocrystals.
Anchoring groups in the copolymers are homogenously distributed along the polymer backbone which should assure uniform interactions with the nanocrystals on the nanometre scale. This is of course advantageous for the electron separation and transport. The nanocrystals chosen for the molecular hybrids were cadmium selenide nanorods about 6.5 nm in diameter and 23 nm in length. TOPO ligands that cap the as synthesized CdSe nanorods can be replaced by more labile pyridine molecules,25 which can provide a more efficient exchange in the presence of functional polymers.
Before studying the properties of molecular composites in the solid state, it is instructive to separately investigate its components in solution. Absorption and photoluminescence spectra of PA and CdSe nanocrystals used for the preparation of the composites studied are shown in Fig. 1. The CdSe spectra represent a typical absorption plot of semiconductor nanocrystals with the first exciton absorption peak at 646 nm. Their photoluminescence (PL) spectrum is characterized by a symmetrical peak centred around 667 nm. The absorption spectrum of PA2 follows in general the classical spectra of polythiophenes with a dominating peak at 428 nm corresponding to the π–π* transition of the polymer. The ester forms of the polymers used give essentially the same spectra that do not depend much on the comonomers’ ratio.
 Fig. 1  Absorption and photoluminescence spectra recorded in chloroform solution of TOPO-coated CdSe nanocrystals (a) and PA2 polymer (b). Inset shows a TEM micrograph of the CdSe nanocrystals. 
Cosolutions of both components were prepared by adding the nanocrystals solution to a stock polymer solution. In this process partial ligand exchange of the capping ligands by macromolecular ones, which bind to the nanocrystals' surface via carboxyl groups, takes place. The absorption spectrum of a typical solution represents essentially a superposition of the individual constituents' spectra: it is dominated by a strong band originating from the π–π* transition in the conjugated polymer backbone and, in addition, the excitonic band with a maximum at π = 645 nm, characteristic of nanorods, can be distinguished (Fig. 2a).
 Fig. 2  Spectra of the composite material PA2–CdSe and its components registered in chloroform: (a) absorption and (b) normalized photoluminescence (λexc = 450 nm). The inset shows the corresponding non-normalized PL spectra to illustrate quenching of the polymer fluorescence by addition of CdSe nanocrystals. 
Different behavior is observed for the PL spectra of the composite in solution: the polymer spectrum is strongly quenched by the nanocrystals present in the solution (see inset in Fig. 2b). This can be considered as an indication of energy or electron transfer from polythiophene to CdSe nanocrystals upon excitation, due to the binding of the polymer onto the nanocrystals' surface. The interactions of the polymer with the nanocrystals induce a vibrational state in the photoluminescence spectrum which is non existent in the spectrum of the pure polymer solution (Fig. 2b). This is manifested by a small shoulder on the lower energy side of the photoluminescence spectrum at approx. 615 nm, which also overlaps with nanocrystals' photoluminescence peak at 667 nm.
Photoluminescence quenching can be taken as a convenient measure of PA interactions with CdSe nanorods and their capability of exchanging the initial ligands.26,27 To better understand its nature, a titration experiment was designed, in which a known amount of the polymer is titrated with small quantities of nanocrystals solution or vice versa.26–28Fig. 3a shows the change in the intensity of the normalized PA2 PL peak induced by the addition of increasing amounts of pyridine capped nanocrystals, while Fig. 3b compares the PL quenching upon titration of solutions of PA2 and PE2. The peak intensity was corrected with respect to the polymer absorption changes. As expected, the photoluminescence of the acid form of the polymer is quenched more efficiently than that of the ester form. This implies that the polyacids interact more strongly with nanocrystals′ surface, and an easier exchange for the initial pyridine ligand occurs in the dynamic processes between the nanocrystals and the polymer containing the coordinating groups. The ester form nevertheless retains some ability to replace the initial ligands despite the fact that it is not as good anchoring group as the acid one.

The PL spectra are normalized with respect to the corresponding absorptions. 
Similar results were obtained with polymers PE1 and PA1 (data not shown), however no clear effect of the comonomers ratio could be observed. A possible explanation for this phenomenon can be obtained by comparing the average distance between the functional groups in the polymer with the sizes of the nanocrystals used in this work. As the size of a thiophene unit in poly(alkylthiophene)s is about 0.38 nm,29 the average distance between the carboxylic functional groups is ca. 1.4 and 1.1 nm for PE2/PA2 and PE1/PA1, respectively, whereas the size of the CdSe nanorods is 23 × 6.5 nm, i.e. significantly larger. It seems that the number of functional groups is already sufficient for PE2/PA2 and adding more functional groups would not improve the anchoring efficiency on nanorods' surface.
As the most promising application of the proposed hybrids of conducting polymers with semiconducting nanocrystals lies in photovoltaics, special care should be taken with regard to the alignment of the HOMO and LUMO levels of both components. The energy levels of the nanorods can be determined from the absorption and PL spectra, by comparing their shift with respect to that of the bulk materials, for which the positions of the valence and conduction bands are known. In the case of the conducting polymers, these values are typically obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies or from a combination of CV and spectroscopic studies. The potential of the onset of the anodic peak during the oxidation (Fig. 4) of the polymer, deposited on the working electrode, can be used for the calculation of the position of its HOMO level. By using ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple as an internal standard and taking into account its position with respect to the vacuum level (−4.8 eV),30 the energy levels of all polymers used have been calculated (Table 1). As has already been stated, the nature of the terminal group in the monomer substituent affects the potential of the electrochemical polymerization onset.24 However, as seen from the data presented in Table 1, it has little influence on the potential of the onset of the oxidative doping in the already formed polymer. Evidently, due to the presence of a methylene spacer, the π-electron density, which determines the potential of the oxidative doping, is not significantly changed if the ester group is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic one.

3.2. Molecular composites of PE and PA polymers and cadmium selenide nanocrystals
Strong polymer/nanocrystals interactions, expected for the functionalized polymers used, should facilitate the ligand exchange process, which constitutes the necessary condition for the preparation of the polymer—nanocrystal molecular composites.
Coordination of the carboxylic group of the polymers to the surface of the nanocrystals can be followed by IR spectroscopy of the corresponding films. Fig. 5 shows comparative spectra of the ester PE2 film and the composite PA2–CdSe. The bands at 2921 and 2852 cm−1 can be attributed to the aliphatic stretching originating from the pendant octyl groups. In the spectrum of PE2 the peak at 1737 cm−1 corresponds to the CO stretch of the ester group. After the hydrolysis and coordination to the nanocrystals the spectrum undergoes significant changes, especially in the region corresponding to the carbonyls, 1400–1800 cm−1 (Fig. 5, inset). The initial carbonyl peak at 1737 cm−1 considerably decreases in intensity but does not disappear completely, indicating the presence of some remaining unreacted ester groups. Four new peaks appear in the composite film: at 1622, 1536, 1456, and 1436 cm−1. These peaks were assigned to the asymmetric (two former bands) and symmetric (two latter) stretchings of the carboxylate in the anionic form bound to the cadmium ions of the nanocrystals. These results are in agreement with previous analysis of a similar hybrid system31 and can serve as an additional proof of chemical coordination of the functionalized polymers to nanocrystals' surface.
 Fig. 5  IR spectra of PE2 (top) and PA2–CdSe (bottom) films on Au. Inset shows the carbonyl stretch region. 
To get a better understanding of the electronic effects resulting from these coordination phenomena, it is instructive to compare the spectroelectrochemical data obtained for PA2 and PA2–CdSe composites films (Fig. 6). The most striking difference between the spectra of the neutral form of pure PA2 and PA2 in the hybrid PA2–CdSe (see the spectra registered at E = 0.1 V) is a hypsochromic shift of the π–π* transition band from 448 nm (PA2) to 430 nm (PA2–CdSe). This means that the band gap of PA2 in the hybrid increased by approx. 0.12 eV. It can serve as an indication of a conformational change occurring in PA2 upon its coordination to nanocrystals′ surface that lowers its effective conjugation length. A similar phenomenon has previously been observed for the composite of dimethylpyrimidine functionalized poly(3-hexylthiophene) and thymine-capped CdSe nanospheres.11PA2 in this less planar conformation should be more difficult to oxidize. This is indeed the case, upon rising the electrode potential from 0.1 to 0.7 V one observes an essentially total disappearance of the π–π* transition band in pure PA2, whereas in the case of the hybrid this band is still of significant intensity. The doping results not only in bleaching the π–π* transition peak but also in the appearance of two doping-induced bands, which grow in intensity as the electrode potential raises. The positions of the doping induced bands in PA2–CdSe, registered at E = 0.7 V, are also hypsochromically shifted as compared to the corresponding bands in pure PA2. In the former, they are located at 750 and 1340 nm compared to 775 and 1534 nm, respectively, in the latter. These differences are consistent with a larger gap of the polymer in the hybrid, which also results in a higher spacing between the polaron levels. In a very highly doped conjugated polymer the two polaron bands disappear, which gives rise to a monotonic absorption tail characteristic of the metallic state.32 This is not the case either in pure PA2 or PA2–CdSe, however the former is more heavily doped, which can be concluded from the relative intensities of the doping induced bands with respect to the π–π* transition band. At E = 0.7 V, this ratio is higher for PA2 as compared to PA2–CdSe. One should note that in the case of PA2–CdSe such comparison requires the subtraction of the background originating from the presence of nanocrystals. Similarly difficult doping was reported for polymers of low conjugation length.33

By taking the low-energy onset of the π–π* transition peak of the polymer reduced form in PA2–CdSe, maintained at E = −0.2 V, its band gap was found to be 2.12 eV (data not shown). Thus, the data obtained from the spectroelectrochemistry coupled with electrochemical studies allow for obtaining the HOMO/LUMO levels for the polymeric component in the PA2–CdSe composite. However, complete characterization of the latter requires the determination of the corresponding HOMO/LUMO levels for the CdSe nanocrystal component. For that purpose, we applied a previously developed procedure23,34 to TOPO-coated CdSe nanorods of a similar size as that in the composite. The energy diagram of PA2–CdSe is displayed in Fig. 7. Staggered configuration of the energy levels is favourable for the efficient electron transfer between PA2 and CdSe nanocrystals. Taking into account similar HOMO values obtained for all polymers studied as well as their similar polymer band gaps determined from the absorption studies, the band diagrams for the respective composites are expected to have a very similar character.

Morphological studies of composites' films were carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using free-standing hybrid films on TEM grids. Fig. 8a and c show micrographs of thin layers of PE2–CdSe and PA2–CdSe composites containing 50 wt% of rod-shaped CdSe nanocrystals. In the case of both ester and acid functionalized polymers, individual nanorods, which do not form aggregates, can be distinguished. The image is very different from that recorded for blends of nanocrystals with different types of nonfuctionalized poly(alkylthiophenes) where strong phase separation occurs and nanocrystals form large aggregates of tens of nanometres to even microns size.6,23
 Fig. 8  TEM images of molecular composites: (a) PE2–CdSe; (c) PA2–CdSe with 50 wt% of nanocrystals. STEM cross-sections of molecular composites: (b) PE2–CdSe; (d) PA2–CdSe. The scale bar corresponds to 100 nm. 
Evidently, the presence of anchoring carboxylic function in the polymer substituents induces stronger interactions between the inorganic and organic components of the composite and by consequence impedes their phase segregation. In PE2–CdSe (Fig. 8a) some tendencies for phase segregation of nanometres size can be observed, which by analogy with the PL quenching interpretation can be attributed to weaker interactions between the nanocrystal and the polymer ester group as compared to the case of PA2. But even these composites are surprisingly homogeneous, at least in the film plane.
To check the distribution of the nanocrystals in the depth of the composite layer we have performed scanning TEM (STEM) imaging of thin cross-sections of the composite films (Fig. 8b and d). In the case of the PE2–CdSe composite, the nanocrystals are more segregated, showing a clear tendency of stratification. As a result, in the composite film they are predominantly located close to its surfaces. Such morphology might impair the charge transport within the film. The cross section of a representative PA2–CdSe film reveals a homogenous distribution of the nanocrystals within the composite layer. These observations are in agreement with the surface TEM analysis and corroborate our hypothesis that the composites with acid-functionalized copolymers have a better spatial nanocrystal distribution than those with the ester ones.
High resolution TEM (HRTEM) performed on the same samples of the composites confirmed that the integrity of the nanocrystals is preserved after their introduction to the polymer matrix. Crystal lattice planes of CdSe nanorods can clearly be distinguished (see Fig. S1, ESI).† We have also prepared nanocomposites of PA2 with CdSe nanocrystals of different aspect ratios, namely with nanospheres (diameter: 5 nm) and with nanorods and branched nanocrystals (typical size of the arms: 40 nm in length by 4.5 nm in diameter). The composite based on the nanospheres shows an excellent dispersion of the nanocrystals within the acid-functionalized copolymer PA2 (Fig. S2, ESI).† In the case of nanorods and branched nanocrystals, the composite shows some aggregation of the nanocrystals although homogeneity is still better than that observed for standard non functionalized P3HT blended with nanocrystals.2,23
3.3. Photovoltaic devices
Finally, based on the promising preliminary studies, hybrids of nanocrystals and polymers in the form of esters and acids were used as active layers in photovoltaic cells. The device configuration and fabrication are described in detail elsewhere.23,35 Solutions of the hybrids were cast from the chloroform/pyridine mixture (9:1 vol.).6 Despite the electronic communication between the nanocrystals and the polymers, the nanoscale morphology of the hybrid films, and the favourable position of the energy levels of the components, the photovoltaic performance of the materials containing 50 wt% of CdSe nanorods remained very modest, generally below 0.01%.
At the same time we should point out systematically higher short circuit currents Jsc obtained for the hybrids with polymers in the acid form as compared to the ester substituted ones. Cell characteristics were as follows: for the ester form (PE2), the open circuit voltage was Voc = 0.218 V, Jsc = 0.005 mA cm−2 and the fill factor FF = 0.260 giving an overall power conversion efficiency η = 0.0003%. For the acid form (PA2), these values were Voc = 0.264 V, Jsc = 0.147 mA cm−2, FF = 0.284 and η = 0.011%. Analysis of these data reveals that short circuit currents of the hybrid cells based on PA copolymers are about 30 times higher than those based on PE ones. This important result corroborates our previous observation of the superior electronic and morphological properties of the acid based hybrids. Better anchoring of the acid group to the nanocrystals surface results in improved charge transfer as well as in better dispersion of the CdSe in the polymer matrix.
There might be several explanations of the very poor performance of the materials studied here in solar cells. One reason could be that we used a regiorandom polythiophene derived copolymer which might result in significantly lower hole mobilities and light absorption as compared to its regioregular equivalent.36 To a lesser extent, the short CdSe nanorods (6.5 nm × 23 nm) used in this work might also limit the cell efficiencies as compared to nanoparticles with larger aspect ratios.3 In our case, the use of nanorods of a higher aspect ratio resulted, however, in their worse dispersion in the polymer matrix. This directed our choice of the short nanorods used here for the proof-of-concept of preparation of nanocomposites with side-functionalized copolymers. Finally, the very close and regular contact on the nanometre-scale between the electroactive polymer chain and the nanocrystals, although beneficial for charge separation, might also result in a significant back charge transfer and charge recombination. This could explain how the low fill factors obtained as such processes would increase the equivalent series resistance of the cell. Therefore an alternative approach, which could eliminate these drawbacks, would be to use a tricomponent system such as unmodified regioregular poly(alkylthiophene) mixed with hybrids of its complexing equivalent with nanocrystals. The latter can assure an efficient charge separation while the former will improve the hole transport. Preparation of the composites with regioregular polymers is underway.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized polythiophene-based copolymers containing ester and acid functional groups. Blending the acid-functionalized copolymers with CdSe nanorods results in the formation of a hybrid molecular nanocomposite material exhibiting no signs of phase separation at the nanometre level. Quenching of the polymer photoluminescence in solution is an unambiguous indication of the electronic communication between the components of the hybrid. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical studies of the hybrid films allowed further investigating the copolymers as well as their interaction with the nanocrystals. Nanocomposites with polyacid-type copolymers expectedly interact more efficiently with the CdSe than those containing ester groups. Photovoltaic cells of bulk heterojunction type have been fabricated from these molecular composites and characterized.
