Herein, the use of a hybrid functional reduces the error in bandgap estimation from 95% to 5% resulting in a bandgap of 3.7 eV. This is expected to help controlling the electronic and structural properties of the material.
1. Introduction
Metal oxides have been extensively studied for decades due to their exotic properties making them attractive candidates for several applications, especially in solar energy conversion systems and CMOS-based technology. In those systems, understanding the band structure of the material as well as the accurate determination of the positions of valence and conduction band edges is crucial in determining its performance. Also, the electronic properties of the material, which depend on its crystal structure, are another important factor that determines its efficiency.
One of the most widely used large band gap metal oxides is Ta2O5, which has an experimental band gap in the range 3.9–4.0 eV.1–3 This large band gap can be tuned to fit a specific application.1,4–6 Several polymorphs have been reported for Ta2O5 which can be divided into low-temperature (L-Ta2O5) and high-temperature (H-Ta2O5) Ta2O5. The most common polymorphs in L-Ta2O5 are β-Ta2O5 and δ-Ta2O5. Early experiments by Stephenson et al. reported an orthorhombic β-Ta2O5 with 22 Ta atoms and 55 O atoms.7 Aleshina and Loginova pointed out later that the data on β-Ta2O5 are contradictory and proposed a new orthorhombic structure, which consists of four Ta atoms and ten O atoms.8 A hexagonal structure (δ-Ta2O5) has been observed for Ta2O5 films prepared by chemical vapor deposition9 and magnetron sputtering.10 However, the calculated density11 is twice the experimentally reported value.12 Based on the extinction rule, Fukomoto and Miwa13 suggested one of the lattice constants should be twice that of the measured value in order to agree with the measured density. Using density functional theory (DFT), it was shown that β-Ta2O5 is more stable than δ-Ta2O5 by 0.8 eV per cell.14,15 More interestingly, a recent study showed that both β- and δ-phases show some instability and that large supercells should be used in calculations to optimize the structure.16 As was the case with L-Ta2O5, orthorhombic,17 tetragonal,18 and monoclinic19 crystal structures were also reported for H-Ta2O5.
The band structure of Ta2O5 represents another controversial issue. Several research investigations have employed DFT to calculate the material band structure. Numerous functionals have been used in an attempt to get closer to the experimental results. Using Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), Gu et al.14 reported bandgaps of 0.2 eV and 1.06 eV for β-Ta2O5 and δ-Ta2O5, respectively. This result was asserted by Wu et al.20 who reported similar bandgaps of 0.1 eV and 1.1 eV for β- and δ-Ta2O5, respectively. However, the calculated bandgaps are very far from the experimentally reported bandgap,1–3 which would hinder further study on Ta2O5 such as studying the effect of doping on its electrical and optical properties. This underestimation is expected as the exchange-correlation functional in GGA does not contain the correct 1/R dependence (R is the charge separation distance).21 Hubbard correction factor (U-correction) is one of the methods used to overcome this underestimation.22 Ivanov et al.23 implemented GGA + U to calculate the bandgap of δ-Ta2O5, reporting 1.31 eV compared to 1.2 eV without U-correction. Unfortunately, the U-correction did not give enough improvement to the calculation and therefore other methods have been investigated. Hybrid functionals may overcome this problem through the incorporation of the exact Hartree–Fock exchange functional.21 Wu et al.20 used Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06),24,25 trying to get a more accurate bandgap than that obtained using GGA. Their calculated bandgaps were 0.9 eV and 2.0 eV for β- and δ-Ta2O5, respectively. This is one step closer to the practical results. However, it is not close enough to experiments.
The above introduction shows that there is a lot of controversy about the crystalline structure as well as the electronic properties of Ta2O5. This opens the door for further improvement and suggestion of new structures that fit better with experimental data. In this work, we used the PBE0 hybrid functional to calculate the bandgap and band structure of β- and δ-Ta2O5. We also proposed a new crystal structure for Ta2O5 that allows for a much lower computational cost compared to other proposed structures. Our study shows the opportunity to reduce the bandgap estimation error from 95% to only 5%, resulting in a bandgap that is in a very close agreement with experimental values.
2. Computational method
The electronic band structure calculations for all Ta2O5 crystals were based on density functional theory and performed on the CASTEP package in Materials Studio (version 5.5) using plane wave basis sets. The initial crystal structures for β- and δ-Ta2O5 were taken from ref. 20. A geometry optimization was carried out on β- and δ-Ta2O5 using the BFGS algorithm to obtain the optimum positions of O atoms which leads to minimum energy.26–32 The geometry optimization was carried out using Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) by Perdew, Barke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).27 Two levels of calculations with different computational costs were performed. The low-computational-cost calculation was based on GGA-PBE with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials28 were used to approximate the core electrons. A Monkhorst–Pack29 k-point grid of 4 × 4 × 2 was adopted. A Fermi smearing of 0.1 eV was used to compute the DOS plots. The high-computational-cost calculation was based on the PBE0 hybrid functional. This functional is based on the pure PBE functional and is made hybrid by Adamo41 by incorporating 25% exchange and 75% correlation weighting. The cutoff energy was 400 eV and the Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid was 3 × 3 × 2. The method does not allow for ultrasoft pseudopotentials so we used Norm-conserving pseudopotentials.31 The Fermi smearing was kept at 0.1 eV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Bandgap calculation of Ta2O5

Fig. 1(a) and (b) shows the obtained energy band structures of β- and δ-Ta2O5 using the GGA-PBE calculations. The β-phase has a direct bandgap of 0.2 eV whereas the δ-phase has an indirect bandgap of 1.04 eV, which occurs between the A-point and the Γ-point. The calculated bandgaps are in good agreement with calculations from previous reports.14,20,23

The partial and total density of states for β- and δ-Ta2O5 are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. The valence band is attributed to O 2p orbitals for both β- and δ-phases, whereas the Ta 5d orbital has the main contribution to the conduction band. The partial density of states of oxygen is similar in both β- and δ-phases. On the other hand, the partial density of states of tantalum is quite different in both phases, especially in the conduction band. This is the main reason for the difference in the bandgap values between the β- and δ-phases.

The results shown in Fig. 1–3 are in good agreement with those reported in ref. 14,20,23. However, the calculated bandgap is still far from the experimental results. This is a well-known feature of pure density functionals, such as PBE, that tends to underestimate the energy bandgap.3,21,22,24 Hybrid functionals are known to give more accurate results. The energy band structures for β- and δ-Ta2O5 based on PBE0 hybrid functional calculations are shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. The calculated bandgap for β- and δ-phases using the PBE0 functional are 2.45 eV and 2.92 eV, respectively. This corresponds to a reduction in the percentage error from 73%, using GGA, to 25%, using PBE0 for δ-Ta2O5. In β-Ta2O5, the error is reduced from 95% using GGA to 37% using PBE0. B3LYP is considered another commonly used hybrid functional. Using B3LYP, the obtained bandgaps for β- and δ-Ta2O5 were found to be 2.15 eV and 2.65 eV, respectively. This is even worse than the PBE0 functional. The reason why GGA gives a poorer result than hybrid functionals is due to the fact that GGA fails to correctly describe the asymptotic behavior of the exchange potential. This is remedied in hybrid functionals through incorporating nonlocal Hartree–Fock exchange.36,37 It is noteworthy to mention that the two structures give comparable bandgaps under hybrid functional calculations, which suggests that Ta2O5 is polycrystalline with β- and δ-phases coexisting together. This is in line with the reported X-ray data showing the amorphous nature of Ta2O5.38–42
We believe that phase transformation is undertaken in Ta2O5 in which all the different phases are transformed into a single phase to form crystalline Ta2O5. This also explains the reason of having a single bandgap reported in experiments to date. If the two structures have different bandgaps as the literature suggests, there would have been two different reported experimental bandgaps. Fig. 2 and 3 compare the partial and total density of states under GGA-PBE and PBE0 calculations for β- and δ-Ta2O5, respectively. It is clear that both calculations are similar with the conduction band shifted to the right in the case of PBE0 to signify an increase in the bandgap. This implies that GGA-PBE is good enough for qualitative analysis whereas PBE0 can be used when quantitative results are required.
Wu et al. have previously used the HSE06 hybrid functional to calculate the band gap of Ta2O5.34,43 However, they reported bandgaps of only 0.9 eV and 2 eV for β- and δ-Ta2O5, respectively.20 This corresponds to an error of 77% for β-Ta2O5 and 49% for δ-Ta2O5, compared to the measured bandgaps.
The improved results upon the use of PBE0 compared to HSE06 may stem from the fact that the exchange energy for HSE06 has less Hartree–Fock (HF) fraction than PBE0. HSE06 employs HF in short range exchange only while computing the long range exchange using the pure GGA-PBE functional. However, PBE0 does not have this splitting of exchange energy terms. As HF reduces the self-interaction error of the density functional,44 PBE0 is expected to give more accurate results than HSE06, in agreement with our results. The exchange-correlation expression (Exc) for PBE0 is given by: EPBE0xc = ¼EHFx + ¾EPBEx + EPBEc(1)where EHFx is the HF exchange energy and EPBEx and EPBEc are the correlation energies based on the PBE functional. In HSE06, the Exc is split into two regions: short range and long range, with a parameter ω that determines the separation range. Only the short range part is a mixture of HF and the PBE functional, whereas the long range is expressed in terms of PBE without including HF. The resulting expression for the Exc is then given by: EHSExc = ¼EHF,SRx(ω) + ¾EPBE,SRx(ω) + EPBE,LRx(ω) + EPBEc(2)where EHF,SRx(ω) is the short range exchange energy based on HF calculations, EPBE,SRx(ω) and EPBE,LRx(ω) are the short range and long range PBE exchange energies, respectively. Comparing eqn (1) and (2), the correlation energy is the same for both hybrid functionals, however, the exchange energy for HSE06 has less HF fraction than PBE0.
An earlier version of HSE06, called HSE03,43 has been assessed for the evaluation of bandgaps. HSE03 is similar to HSE06 with the only difference being the splitting parameter, ω. In HSE03, two different values of ω are being used for HF and PBE exchange. Whereas for HSE06, ωHF = ωPBE. Krukau et al.34 showed that HSE06 introduces more error than HSE03 in calculating the bandgap and that the deviation between the two functionals decreases by decreasing the value of ω used in HSE06 calculations. Therefore, it is relevant here to mention the comparison between HSE03 and PBE0 to highlight why HSE06 would give worse, or at most equivalent, results to HSE03. Heyd et al. used HSE03 to calculate the bandgap of 40 semiconductor and insulator materials.33 The mean absolute error was calculated to be 0.26 eV. However, the method tends to greatly underestimate solids with large bandgaps. For example, the error in calculating the MgO bandgap was 0.72 eV, which is about three times higher than the mean absolute error. Paier et al. has also compared between HSE03 and PBE0 in calculating the bandgap of MgO.35 PBE0 showed an error of 0.46 eV compared to 1.36 eV for HSE03. This is in agreement with our results since Ta2O5 is considered as a relatively high bandgap material with a bandgap of about 4 eV. Another advantage of PBE0 over HSE06 is that PBE0 is parameter-free whereas HSE06 depends on the splitting parameter (ω), whose optimum value might vary according to the system of consideration.
3.2 Proposed Ta2O5 structure
Our proposed structure (Fig. 4a) involves re-orienting the conventional β-Ta2O5 (Fig. 4b) such that the b-vector becomes along the Z-axis and the c-vector is in the XY plane. After that, a P1 symmetry is imposed on the structure to maximize the number of degrees of freedom for the arrangement of atoms. We then optimized the unit cell and looked for the nearest symmetry group. The cell consists of 2 Ta atoms and 5 O atoms. This is the most primitive Ta2O5 crystal structure. Having such primitive structure would decrease the computational time considerably, allowing for more detailed computations. Note that the original β-structure can be reconstructed from a 1 × 2 × 1 super cell of the modified β-structure. The proposed structure has an orthorhombic crystal lattice with PMMM symmetry group. The lattice parameters were optimized till we reached a = 7.9 Å, and b = c = 3.75 Å. These values are comparable with those reported in ref. 13. The calculated density is about 6.6 g cm−3, which is in a good agreement with the tabulated experimental densities (5–7.2 g cm−3) of amorphous Ta2O5.45 It is also in agreement with the calculated density (6.82 g cm−3) reported by Wu et al.20

To determine the bandgap, two levels of computation were carried out: the pure GGA-PBE functional and the hybrid PBE0 functional. The electronic structure under both levels of computations is shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). Under pure PBE functional, the calculated bandgap is 1.45 eV, which is about 0.4 eV higher than δ-Ta2O5 calculated under the same conditions.
Using PBE0, the calculated bandgap of the proposed structure was 3.7 eV. This is only 0.2 eV far from the reported experimental results, corresponding to a relative error of only 5%. It is worth mentioning here that the computational time for our proposed structure is six times less than β- and δ-structures. This allows for carrying out detailed computations on large supercells with relatively viable computational cost.
For comparison purposes, Table 1 shows the computed bandgap for different Ta2O5 polymorphs using different functionals as compared to the experimental value. Note that the calculated bandgap of our proposed structure under PBE0 is the closest to the experimental value. Fig. 5 shows the partial and total density of states of our proposed structure under GGA-PBE and PBE0 calculations, respectively. As was the case with β- and δ-Ta2O5, O 2p forms the valence band of Ta2O5 whereas the conduction band is mainly formed of Ta 5d.

As a final remark, we want to emphasize on the several strengths of our proposed structure. Firstly, the structure is based on a primitive cell with 2 Ta atoms and 5 O atoms. This reduces the computational cost considerably compared to other proposed structures. Secondly, the proposed structure gives the closest bandgap and density to experiment and hence it can be used to accurately determine the electronic and structural properties of Ta2O5.
4. Conclusions
The PBE0 hybrid functional is shown to be an efficient method for the bandgap estimation of Ta2O5. PBE0 showed better results compared to HSE06 due to the incorporation of HF exchange energy in short and long ranges, which allowed for a smaller self-interaction error. The calculated bandgap for δ-Ta2O5 under PBE0 calculation is 2.92 eV, which is the closest reported bandgap to experiment so far, suggesting that low-level computation can be used for qualitative analysis whereas high-level computation can be used whenever accurate results are required, at the expense of a more demanding computational power.
A new Ta2O5 orthorhombic structure is proposed. Using the PBE0 hybrid functional, this structure showed a bandgap energy of 3.7 eV, which is only 0.2 eV from the reported experimental value. The structure has a PMMM symmetry group with lattice constants a = 7.9 Å, and b = c = 3.75 Å. The computational time of our proposed structure is six times less than other reported structures under the same computational method, which allows for more detailed computations and hence investigation of more subtle properties of Ta2O5. We recommend this structure for further theoretical investigations and experimental verifications as it provides a minimum error in the calculated bandgap.
