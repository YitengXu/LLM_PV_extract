    , Accepted 28th February 2022First published on 28th February 2022AbstractSolar steam generation and supercapacitors are considered the best solutions for society's foremost issues such as wastewater treatment and energy storage. Nanoporous carbons derived from the metal–organic framework are of great interest for these applications because of their high specific surface areas, tunable pore structures, good conductivity, high optical absorption, and controllable shapes. To date, various nanostructures of carbons have been studied for solar steam generation and supercapacitors individually. This work portrays the simple synthesis of multifunctional nanoporous carbon for solar steam generation and electrochemical supercapacitor applications. The structural and surface area analysis confirms the formation of graphitic carbon with a high specific surface area of 321.4 m2 g−1. The polyhedron-shaped carbon-based solar absorber with a high absorption coefficient performs as a solar steam generator with an evaporation rate of 1.4 kg m−2 h−1 for 2D devices and 2.1 kg m−2 h−1 for the modified cone-shaped 3D devices under one sun illumination. Moreover, the symmetric two-electrode supercapacitor device for these materials in an ionic liquid electrolyte ([emim][BF4]/PC) demonstrates a maximum specific energy of 16.9 W h kg−1 and specific power of 10.9 kW kg−1.
1. Introduction
Next-generation technologies need the development of low-cost, environmentally stable multifunctional materials with new controlled approaches. Materials need to satisfy properties such as particle size and shape, graphitic degree, pore size distributions, surface area, conductivity, optical absorption, and mechanical and chemical stability for use in diverse applications.1–3 Generally, optimizing one specific material property hampers the other properties. For instance, materials need to be treated at a high temperature for improving graphitic degree, resulting in a change in pore size and pore size distributions.4 It is not easy to realize multifunctional carbons that can be applied for various applications.
Researchers have demonstrated that metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can be used directly or indirectly (after carbonization) to improve the performance of a broad range of devices, thanks to their tunable particle size and shape, controllable surface area, and pore size distributions.5–7 They have been used in various gravitating fields, including catalysis,8 sensors,9 gas storage10 and separation,11 chemical sensors and biosensors,12 photocatalysis,13 batteries14 and supercapacitors.15 Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are a subclass of MOFs used recently to develop nanoporous carbons (NPCs) due to good surface area values and mechanochemical stability. Owing to their 3D structure, high-graphitic degree, good conductivity, high optical absorption, and well-developed porous structure ZIF-derived NPCs provide an ideal platform for multifunctionality.16,17 Of the thousands of well-known porous coordination polymer-derived materials, only a handful of them reported multiple applications such as solar steam generation (SSG) and electrochemical energy storage.18,19
Recently, MOF-derived NPC has shown great potential in applications such as SSG, which is considered a promising solution for freshwater production.20–22 Previous literature reports demonstrated that the unique properties of MOF-derived carbons such as porosity, defects, and free radical concentrations help to improve photothermal performance. In addition to this, the ZIF-derived NPC inherits excellent mechanochemical stability, which can further increase its utilization as an absorber under harsh environmental conditions (strong acidic and basic). This can be further applied to treat wastewater from various chemical factories and other industries. Recently, Tsang et al. used cobalt-based MOFs over stainless steel mesh to develop a layered light-trapping structure for SSG applications.23 This kind of structure enabled them to achieve an evaporation rate of 1.2 kg m−2 h−1. The absence of cobalt removal treatment from carbonized materials may be the possible reason for their hindered performance. Even though some reports show improved performance for MOF-derived materials for SSG applications,24 there is still plenty of room for MOF-derived carbon materials to improve SSG performance and field advancement further.
Carbon nanomaterials including carbon onions (0-D), CNTs (1-D), graphene (2-D), activated carbons (3-D), and other soft and hard template (3-D) carbons are promising supercapacitor materials. Different approaches have been proposed to enhance the supercapacitor performance of NPCs, such as pore size optimization,25,26 and use of various non-aqueous electrolytes.27 The use of organic and ionic electrolytes for the extension of the voltage window and consequently the SC performance is a promising route that has been utilized broadly in the literature.28,29 Interestingly, various researchers explored the mixture of ionic liquids with organic solvents to amplify their good conductivity and fewer viscosity values.30 However, the use of this kind of approach for MOF-derived carbons is scarce.
Here, we have synthesized MOF-derived NPC via direct carbonization of ZIF-67 in an inert atmosphere. The synthesized NPC has been utilized as an active material for SSG and SC applications. The developed NPC material's superior optical absorption and high effective surface area foster a water evaporation rate of 1.4 kg m−2 h−1 and 2.1 kg m−2 h−1 in a conventional 2D SSG design and 3D (cone-shaped) configurations. Further, the same material (NPC) was studied as an electrode material for SC applications. The symmetric supercapacitor device (SSD) has shown a great specific energy (SE) of 16.9 W h kg−1 with a maximum specific power (SP) of 10.9 kW kg−1. The use of ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte helped in the extension of the working voltage window of the device. Interestingly, the addition of propylene carbonate (PC) in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([emim][BF4]) increases the ionic conductivity and reduces the viscosity of electrolytes.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
2-Methylimidazole (MIM, purity 99%) and cobalt (II) chloride (CoCl2, purity 97%) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Chemical Co. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30), hydrofluoric (HF) acid solution and methanol (AR) were obtained from TCI Co. Ltd. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filter membranes (0.45 μm) were purchased from Merck Millipore.
2.2 Synthesis of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-67 and NPC
ZIF-67 particles were synthesized as per our earlier report31 with slight modifications. Briefly, CoCl2 (520 mg) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K-30, 600 mg) were dissolved in methanol (40.0 mL) and stirred for 15 min to form a solution. Another clear solution of 2-methylimidazole (2.63 g) was achieved via mixing it in methanol. Then, both solutions were mixed and further stirred for 30 min to get a homogenized solution. This solution was aged at room temperature for 24 h. On completion of the reaction, the violet-colored powder was precipitated. The precipitated powder was collected after carefully washing with methanol (3 times) and ethanol (2 times), aging with methanol and drying at 80 °C. The obtained violet-colored ZIF-67 particles were directly carbonized under a nitrogen flow (5 LPH) at 800 °C. First, the ultrapure N2 gas was purged for 2 h before starting the heating of the sample. Then, the temperature was gradually increased with a rate of 5 °C min−1, and after achieving the target temperature, it was maintained for 5 h under N2 flow. Then the samples were cooled down to room temperature naturally. Washing of the as obtained black particles was done using 10% HF solution for 24 h. This procedure was repeated three times, and after this, the particles were washed carefully with ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ) four times and methanol 3 times and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. The obtained fine black powder (denoted as NPC) was stored under an inert atmosphere for further characterization studies. The detailed synthesis schematic is shown in Scheme 1.

2.3 SSG device preparation
5 mg NPC material was well dispersed in 10 mL deionized (DI) water using ultrasonication. The dispersed solution was loaded on cellulose filter paper of a diameter of 2 cm using the vacuum filtration setup. The film was kept in a hot air oven at 60 °C for a few minutes. After cooling, the film was directly used for steam generation as a 2D evaporator. The 3D evaporator was obtained by cutting the plane film into a cone-shaped structure, as illustrated in Fig. S1.†
2.4 Solar evaporation experimental details
The filter paper deposited with the NPC material was kept on polystyrene foam (PF) used as a thermal insulation layer. A small hole in PF was made through which water was supplied to the evaporator using air-laid paper thread. The evaporator was placed under a xenon light source (66921, Newport Corporation) which was turned on when the water reached the edges of the filter paper. An analytical balance (ME204, Mettler Toledo) monitored the mass change profile once the light fell on the evaporator. The thermopile sensor (919P-003-10, Newport Corporation), which was connected to a light meter (843 R, Newport Corporation), was used to adjust the desired light intensity. The error due to the uneven light distribution was reduced by taking the average value of different locations over the desired area. The infrared camera (FLIR E75) connected to a computer was used to measure the system's temperature. All the experiments were conducted at an ambient temperature of ≈ 25 °C and relative humidity of ≈ 56%.
2.5 SC electrode preparation and measurements
The graphite electrodes were used as the current collector in the three-electrode study, while stainless steel (SS) electrodes were used as the current collector for two-electrode measurements. The graphite substrate (1 cm2) was polished with zero-size polish paper and rinsed in ultrapure water flow. Then the substrates were first ultrasonicated in 0.5 M HCl solution for 15 minutes and then in ultrapure water for 30 minutes, followed by drying overnight at 80 °C. The mass of each electrode was determined by using an ultra-micro balance (Mettler Toledo). The slurry was prepared by mixing 90% active material (NPC) and 10% PVDF in the NMP solution. The slurry was drop cast over the electrodes and dried at 80 °C for 5 h. SS disk-shaped electrodes (diameter = 15 mm) with an active mass loading of ∼1.6 mg for two-electrode measurements were used.
2.6 Electrochemical analysis
The electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode and symmetric two-electrode configuration. The drop cast NPC over the graphite electrode was used as a working electrode in the three-electrode cell while platinum wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. We have used a 6 M KOH aqueous solution as an electrolyte for measurement. All the electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 1150C, CH Instruments, USA). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results were studied in the potential window of −0.8 V to 0 V. Moreover, the SSD was constructed utilizing the HS flat test cell (Hohsen Corp.) to pack SS electrodes. The CV and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) insights were considered to investigate the material's performance. For detailed discussion over formulae used for various calculations, refer to Note S1 in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
ZIF-67 particles were synthesized successfully using the room temperature precipitation method and confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Panalytical Empyrean, Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). The XRD pattern of ZIF-67 is compared with the simulated pattern, as shown in Fig. 1a. The wide-angle XRD pattern of NPC is demonstrated in Fig. 1b. The peaks at about 26° and 44° correspond to the graphitic planes of (002) and (101), respectively (ICDD card no. 00-041-1481). Precursor cobalt helps produce graphitic carbon (high sp2 content).32 However, high-temperature annealing, intense acid treatment, and the indirect synthesis of graphitic carbon are responsible for broadening peaks in the XRD spectra. In addition to these, the chemical state and elemental insights of NPC were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Nexsa ThermoFisher Scientific with an Al Kα X-ray source) at room temperature. The survey spectra (Fig. S2a†) predict the approximate atomic percentage of C (93.5 wt%), N (3.7 wt%), and O (2.8 w%). The high-resolution narrow region XPS scans of C 1s and N 1s are shown in Fig. 1c and d. The deconvolution of the C 1s peak shows the presence of C–C (sp2 carbon at 284.5 eV), CN, i.e., nitrogen bonded with sp2 carbon (284.8 eV)33 and C–O (286.1 eV) named C1, C2, and C3, respectively. Additionally, the satellite feature C4 at 291 eV is assigned to the π = π* electronic transitions, further indicating the formation of graphitic structure.34 The deconvoluted peaks of the N 1s enlarged scan as shown in Fig. 1d are attributed to pyridinic-N (399 eV), graphitic-N (401 eV),35 and elemental N2 (∼404 eV)36 denoted as N1, N2, and N3, respectively. The deconvoluted O 1s spectra (Fig. S2b†) show the presence of CO (532.4 eV), –OH (536.6 eV), C–O–C (533.4 eV), and physically absorbed oxygen (530.6 eV).36 These structural characterization studies validate the excellent quality of synthesized NPC. Further, the structural conformation of the synthesized material is verified with Raman spectroscopy (Photon Design, Horiba- Jobin-Yvon T64000), as shown in Fig. S3.† The peaks observed at 1346 cm−1, 1580 cm−1, and 2681 cm−1 correspond to the D, G, and 2D bands, respectively.37,38 The IG/ID ratio was calculated to be 1.3, further supporting the claim of the catalytic action of cobalt.

(b) Wide-angle XRD spectra of the as-synthesized NPC confirming the presence of graphitic planes. The deconvoluted XPS narrow region spectra of (c) C 1s and (d) N 1s. 
Moreover, the morphological information about the sample was obtained using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL 7900 F) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, TECNAI 3010, operated at 200 kV) images, as shown in Fig. 2a–c. The polyhedron particles of ZIF-67 with sizes of about 1 μm are shown in Fig. 2a, verifying the successful synthesis of high-quality ZIF-67 particles. After carbonization, the material retains ZIF's polyhedron shape, as displayed in Fig. 2b. The removal of cobalt ions and the rough surface due to the high temperature and acid treatment is evident in the high-resolution FESEM image, as shown in Fig. S4.† Moreover, the rough surface and the porous structure of the NPC particles are apparent from the FESEM images. This novel polyhedron shape of the material decreases the agglomeration. The porous structure enables easy ion intercalation through the material, which is desirable for SC and SSG applications.

(f) Solar radiance spectra and the absorbance for the NPC powder and the inset shows the magnified diffused reflectance spectrum of the NPC powder. 
Furthermore, the HRTEM images confirm the presence of graphitic planes in the sample, as displayed in Fig. 2c. The inset of Fig. 2c shows the SAED pattern of NPC, revealing the presence of crystalline graphitic planes, namely (101) and (110). The porosity of NPC was descriptively investigated via N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and density functional theory (DFT) modeled pore size distribution as displayed in Fig. 2d and e, respectively. Before adsorption–desorption analysis, the material is degassed under high vacuum at 200 °C for 3 h. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of ZIF-67 and NPC samples are shown in Fig. 2d. The DFT model predicts that the pore diameter of 0.92 nm is inherited from the ZIF-67 network, as shown in Fig. S5.† The DFT pore size distribution of NPC is shown by highlighting the micropore distribution region in Fig. 2e. The material's multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Autosorb-iQ (Quantachrome)) surface area (at 77 K for N2 gas adsorption) was measured to be 321.4 m2 g−1. This high surface area results from the hierarchical pore structure derived from the parent MOF material. The visible porous structure from the FESEM images and well-developed porosity as predicted by gas adsorption measurements encouraged us to check its light absorption ability. The UV-vis-NIR spectrum of the developed NPC powder was measured in the wavelength range of 300 to 2500 nm, as displayed in Fig. 2f. The solar absorbance of NPC (calculated using eqn S5†) was around 96% of the entire solar spectrum, which was superior to some of the carbon-based materials and metal oxides (Fig. S6a†).
Motivated by the high absorption of NPC, we have applied it for solar steam generation. First, we deposit the material on the filter paper to prepare the 2D disk-shaped device. The diffused reflectance of the 2D device was measured in a wet state (Fig. S6b†) and was found almost the same as that of the powder sample discussed earlier. The 2D disk was converted into a 3D cone-shaped structure to enhance the light absorption further, and the total absorption reached 99% (Fig. S6b†). This enhancement in the absorption can be attributed to the conical structure in which the energy losses caused by diffused reflectance are greatly reduced. The photothermal conversion properties of the 2D NPC evaporator was examined by recording the surface temperature under 1 sun illumination using a thermal infrared camera. As shown in Fig. 3a and its insets, upon light illumination, the temperature of the 2D NPC evaporator increased rapidly to the saturation temperatures of 76 °C and 38 °C in dry and wet states, respectively, suggesting an efficient light-to-heat conversion capacity of the NPC.

The SSG performance of the 2D disk and the 3D cone was analyzed using the setup shown in Fig. S7.† In the dark the evaporation rates were 0.12 kg m−2 h−1 and 0.35 kg m−2 h−1 for 2D and 3D evaporators, respectively. Under 1 sun illumination, these evaporation rates increased to 1.4 kg m−2 h−1 and 2.1 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. 3b), which were much faster than those of pure water (0.4 kg m−2 h−1) and cone-shaped pristine filter paper without the absorbing material (0.9 kg m−2 h−1), indicating NPC as an efficient material for SSG applications. These evaporation rate metrics are among the best values reported in the literature, and the comparison is shown in Table S1.† The estimated evaporation efficiency (calculated using eqn S6†) of 2D and 3D evaporators under 1 sun illumination was 80% and 110%, respectively. The evaporation efficiency of the 2D evaporators is limited by various types of energy losses in the form of reflection, convection, and radiation,51 which can be greatly resolved using 3D evaporators.52 Furthermore, over 100% evaporation efficiency can be explained by the heat energy harvesting capacity of the 3D evaporation from the environment. The outer surface temperature of the 3D evaporator is about 4 °C lower than the environment (see ESI Fig. S8a–f† for more details), leading to convection and radiation energy gain. Along with this, we have also compared our material's performance with various traditional carbon materials (carbon black, graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide, and biomass-derived carbons) and advanced carbons (MOF-derived carbons) as displayed in the bar graph in Fig. 3c.
The durability of the 3D NPC evaporator was also investigated under higher solar intensities, and it delivers a stable performance for continuous 16 cycles showing its good recycling ability (Fig. 3d). The evaporation tests were performed under strong acidic (pH = 1) and strong alkaline (pH = 13) conditions. The evaporation rate of the 3D NPC evaporator for 10 cycles hardly shows any change (Fig. 3e), indicating excellent tolerance toward harsh conditions. We further measured the pH values of these solutions before and after purification using a pH and conductivity meter (Jenway, 3540). The pH values changed from pH = 1 (acidic) , pH =13 (basic) to pH = 7 (Fig. S9†), indicating effective purification of water in harsh environments. The color of the pH test papers in the inset of Fig. 3e also confirms the purified nature of condensed water from acid and alkali solutions. The NPC evaporator's wastewater purification was simulated using soap water (SW) and methylene blue (MB) solutions. The UV-vis absorption spectra of these solutions were measured before and after purification. The zero absorption in the UV-visible spectra (Fig. 3f) of the condensed water from both the solutions confirms the NPC evaporator's ability for wastewater purification. The purification is also evident from the color change of solution after condensation, as shown in the insets of Fig. 3f.
Along with excellent SSG performance, we have used NPC for SSD in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. Initial tests were conducted to determine the material's electrochemical signature and active potential window using the standard three-electrode arrangements in an aqueous 6 M KOH electrolyte. The developed material has shown an excellent capacitance of 299.3 F g−1 in the potential window of −0.8 to 0 V at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1. This capacitance retained up to 162.8 F g−1 (55%) even at a higher scan rate of 200 mV s−1. The rectangular CV curves at varying scan rates and the capacitance retention curves are plotted in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The rectangular nature of the plot itself confirms the electric double layer capacitance type nature of the material, similar to previous literature reports on NPC derived from ZIFs. Interestingly, this capacitance value is comparatively higher than the recent reports on carbon derived from various MOFs, as tabulated in Table S2†. The main reason behind this is the improved pore structure and graphitic degree of the material, which facilitated more ion adsorption inside the pores and significantly enhanced SC performance.

Moreover, to check the practical applicability of the developed material, it was tested in the HS Flat cell in the mixture of IL in PC. The actual pictures of the as used device and electrode arrangement setup are shown in Fig. S10a and S10b.† We have tested NPC performance in [emim][BF4]/PC at a stable voltage window of 2.5 V. The voltage window variation is shown in Fig. 4c. The stable voltage is fixed at 2.5 V for all the SC testing as there is no irreversible or sharp increase in the current values. Here, the addition of PC in [emim][BF4] enables the fast electrolyte ion conduction with the reduction in the viscosity of bare [emim][BF4].29 This synergistic effect helped achieve the excellent performance metrics for NPC when used as an SSD. The CV curves at different rates are shown in Fig. 4d. The assembled SSD has shown a device capacitance of 25.4 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 owing to NPC's superior pore structure and graphitic degree. As a well-known fact, the energy density is directly proportional to the square of the voltage window; therefore, the voltage window extension using IL electrolyte helped improve the device's SE.
We have utilized the GCD technique for specific capacitance, SE, and SP calculations. The charge–discharge current curves of the device at various scan rates are shown in Fig. 4e. The capacitance value of the device is calculated to be 20.1, 17, 13.8, 12.4, and 9.9 F g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 A g−1, respectively (49.3% retention even after 100-times current density increment). The linear charging-discharging behavior suggests the excellent SC behavior of the device. The SSD (NPC//NPC) exhibited an excellent SE of 16.9 W h kg−1 at a decent SP of 242.1 W kg−1 at a low current density of 0.1 A g−1. Also, the device has shown an exceedingly high SP of 10890 W kg−1 at an acceptable SE of 3.8 W h kg−1 even at a high current density of 10 A g−1.
Further, we have compared our material's performance with other packed cell devices reported in the literature as displayed in the Ragone plot in Fig. 4f. Our material exhibited much better performance than the other carbon materials reported in the literature due to the IL/PC electrolyte mixture.53–57 The SE and SP values at different current densities are formulated in Table S3†. The overall capacitive performance of our material is significantly enhanced due to the use of the IL/PC mixture as the electrolyte media. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies were performed in the assembled device at a 5 mV input signal, as displayed in Fig. S11a.† The impedance spectra suggest the capacitive nature of these materials. Interestingly, when this device was tested for 5000 cycles, it retained about 95.6% of its initial capacitance values (Fig. S11b†).
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a NPC material that showed a better graphitic degree, excellent chemical stability, and superb light absorption, making it a suitable candidate for the SSG and SC applications. Our material offers evaporation rates of 1.4 kg m−2 h−1 and 2.1 kg m−2 h−1 and evaporation efficiencies of 80% and 110% in 2D and conical 3D configurations, respectively, under 1 sun illumination. Also, it has demonstrated a stable evaporation rate under harsh environmental conditions such as acidic and alkaline, showing that the NPC material is one of the best alternatives for water purification. Additionally, we have demonstrated how selecting the appropriate electrolyte can improve SC performance. IL and PC mixture utilization helps in achieving outstanding SE and SP values. These performance metrics demonstrate the multifunctionality of the NPC material. Although the results are promising, further research efforts should be devoted to optimizing performance for commercial applications.
