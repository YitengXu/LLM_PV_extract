    , Accepted 7th January 2022First published on 7th January 2022AbstractThe increasing energy demand and related environmental issues have drawn great attention worldwide, thus necessitating the development of sustainable technologies to preserve the ecosystems for future generations. Electrocatalysts for energy-conversion reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are at the heart of these renewable energy technologies, but they suffer from sluggish kinetics due to the multistep electron and mass transfer. State-of-the-art catalysts are thus highly desired to boost the conversion efficiencies, which are still inadequate. Recently, as a typical transition metal dichalcogenide, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with unique physicochemical properties has been verified as a promising material for catalyzing key electrochemical reactions (i.e., HER, NRR, and CO2RR), presenting excellent performances. Therefore, in this review, we give insight into the structure and synthetic strategies of MoS2. Recent advances in MoS2-based materials for the three key electrochemical reactions are briefly summarized. Open challenges and perspectives of MoS2-based electrocatalysts toward HER, NRR, and CO2RR are also outlined.

1. Introduction
Global concerns over the rapidly increasing energy demand, increase in fossil fuels depletion, and associated severe environmental issues (such as global warming) have made the search for renewable energy sources one of the top priorities in the coming decades.1,2 Notably, tremendous effort has been devoted to improving renewable energy technologies (such as fuel cells and various electrolysis systems) based on key energy-conversion reactions,3–6 which have been recognized as the most practical options for meeting the demand for energy storage and conversion and fulfilling the requirements for a sustainable way of life. Hydrogen (H2), with high energy density and renewability, is regarded as an environmentally attractive energy resource for achieving a carbon-neutral world.7–9 However, current industrial H2 production mainly relies on methane steam reforming and coal gasification, inevitably leading to massive greenhouse gas emissions.10 The electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction, which converts water into high-purity H2, is a viable, efficient, and environmentally-friendly way to mitigate severe energy shortages and greenhouse gas emissions.11–14 Similar to H2, ammonia (NH3), with a high energy density, is a potential carbon-free transportation fuel.15 It is also a crucial feedstock for fertilizers and has become the second highest produced chemical in the world.16 Recently, electrochemical nitrogen (N2) fixation by using water as the proton source has emerged as a highly appealing alternative to the Haber–Bosch process for ambient and green NH3 synthesis.17–21 Except for the electrocatalytic water splitting and N2 fixation, carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction proceeds via multi-electron (even twelve-electron) reduction pathways and generates more products,22–29 offering a clean and promising approach for generating fuels such as CH4 and C2H5OH under mild conditions. Thus, it is highly desirable to reduce the unsustainable consumption of fossil fuels via the conversion of gaseous feeds (such as H2, N2, and CO2) into fuels and other value-added products using renewable electricity.30 Although these energy-conversion reactions including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) hold great promise for applications, the practical applications are still constrained by the high kinetic barriers and large overpotentials. It is thus imperative to develop highly active and durable electrocatalytic materials since the use of proficient catalysts with both high activity and selectivity can effectively boost the aforementioned electrocatalytic reactions.
Generally, noble metal catalysts have drawn remarkable attention stemming from excellent catalytic activities in the fields of energy-related electrocatalysis (Pt31,32 for HER; Au,33 Ag,34 Pd35 and Ru36 for NRR; and Pd37,38 for CO2RR). Nevertheless, such catalysts are only suitable for small-scale applications because they are expensive. The search for high-performance electrocatalysts made from earth-abundant elements has thus become a top priority to decrease the use of precious metals.
Recently, due to the unique electrochemical catalytic performance and easy availability, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted the interest of researchers.39–42 This type of material has a general formula MX2, where M can represent Mo, W, Ti, Zr, and V, etc., and X can represent S, Se, and Te. Among the various TMD materials, MoS2 is the most representative and has already been used as a catalyst industrially in hydrodesulfurization.43 Early in 2005, Hinnemann et al.44 found that the Mo end face of MoS2 is similar to the active sites of nitrogenase, which can catalyze the HER. DFT (density functional theory) calculations showed that the hydrogen adsorption energy at the Mo edge bears a striking resemblance to that of platinum. They then loaded MoS2 nanoparticles on graphite for further experiments. With an overpotential in the range 0.1–0.2 V, the experimental results implied that MoS2 has outstanding hydrogen evolution performance. In 2018, we demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that MoS2 is an active electrocatalyst for nitrogen fixation.45 Since the NRR and CO2RR have some characteristics in common (both of these reactions require high energy to cleave strong NN/CO bonds and effectively suppress HER activity),46 it is reasonable to consider MoS2 as a promising CO2RR electrocatalyst.
At present, some high-quality articles have systematically summarized the application of MoS2-based materials in specific fields.47–50 Nevertheless, most of them exclusively focus on MoS2-based materials towards energy storage, HER, bio-applications or environmental applications, while the NRR to produce ammonia has gradually become a research hotspot in recent years, and the CO2RR to convert carbon dioxide into desired organic products is full of challenges. Moreover, with the development of the related technologies, novel strategies in the HER, NRR, and CO2RR have been proposed in recent years. Therefore, in this paper, we systematically summarize recent advances in MoS2-based electrocatalysts for the HER, NRR, and CO2RR. Firstly, we focus on the structure and synthetic methods of MoS2. Then, various strategies toward optimizing the HER and NRR performances of MoS2 are briefly summarized. After that, we introduce MoS2-based materials for CO2RR catalysis with two types of products (CO or other organic products). The remaining challenges and personal perspectives are discussed at the end of the review, highlighting the future directions in this active field.
2. Structure and synthetic methods of MoS2-based materials
As discussed previously, in MoS2, Mo atoms are coordinated by six S atoms arranged in an octahedral or triangular prism geometry to form fundamental units. Each unit is cross-linked to form a sandwich layered structure, in which the transition metal Mo atomic layer is between the upper and lower S atoms. These sandwich layers are stacked together by weak van der Waals forces (Fig. 1a). Based on the different coordinations of the Mo atom, the crystal phases of MoS2 are commonly classified into three types, namely, 1T MoS2, 2H MoS2 and 3R MoS2. As shown in Fig. 1b, both 2H and 3R types of MoS2 have trigonal prismatic coordination. In contrast, the 1T MoS2 (metastable and metallic phase) has octahedral coordination.47,48,51,52 During explorations in energy storage and energy-related reactions, the 2H and 1T phases of MoS2 have been widely studied. The top and bottom sulfur sublayers of 2H MoS2 are in an eclipsing configuration and 1T MoS2 is formed when  and  are the in-plane lattice vectors accompanied by the top and bottom sulfur layer skewing 1/3. Beyond that, 1T MoS2 also includes another type of phase, denoted as 1T′, distinguished by small distortions. In addition to the in-plane distortion of molybdenum ions, sulfur ions of the 1T′ phase of MoS2 have a relative offset. Fig. 1c presents the atomic structure of 2H, 1T and 1T′ phase of MoS2.53,54

Both 2H and 3R types of MoS2 exist widely in nature. However, 3R MoS2 is also the metastable phase and therefore it can be easily transformed into the thermodynamically more stable 2H MoS2 during heating, which possesses D6h point group symmetry. Except for the section on phase transition, if there is no special case, we consider the 2H phase of MoS2 throughout this paper. At room temperature, moderate mobility (200 cm2 (V s)−1) with a high on/off current ratio (108) can be delivered by monolayer MoS2.55 In addition, monolayer 2H MoS2 possesses a direct bandgap of about 1.90 eV as compared to bulk 2H MoS2 (before mechanical exfoliation), which has an indirect bandgap of 1.29 eV, giving it huge potential in wide applications such as optoelectronics,56 light-emitting diodes,57 and photodetectors.58 In contrast, 1T MoS2 monolayers do not possess a band gap.59 Because the two planes of the S atoms are interlaced with a single sheet of Mo, each single layer of bulk 2H MoS2 is a 2D hexagonal crystal structure, possessing D3h point group symmetry (Fig. 1d and e). As shown in Fig. 1f, the interlayer spacing and a free spacing of bulk 2H MoS2 monolayer is 0.62 nm and 0.30 nm, respectively.50,60,61
To date, two main strategies to synthesize monolayer to few-layer MoS2 have been proposed, which are top-down and bottom-up methods. The top-down preparation method is mainly based on a unique property of bulk MoS2, in which van der Waals forces between the layers are weak, so it can be easily peeled off to obtain single- or few-layer nanosheets. Therefore, this method mainly includes mechanical exfoliation,62 ultrasonic exfoliation,63 solvent exfoliation,64 and electrochemical exfoliation.65 As for the bottom-up approach, two main synthetic methods can be introduced, which are chemical vapor deposition (CVD)66 and hydro/solvothermal synthesis.67
3. Applications of MoS2-based materials in HER activity
Electrochemical water splitting can be divided into two important half-reactions, one is the HER, taking place at the cathode, the other is the OER, taking place at the anode.68 For the HER, two basic mechanisms can be introduced, namely, the Volmer–Heyrovsky and Volmer–Tafel mechanism.11 As for which mechanism is the dominant or the controlling step, it depends on the electrode material, especially its adsorption strength of hydrogen atoms. And based on these two mechanisms, three reaction steps can be discussed in detail as follows. The first step is the Volmer reaction, which is the initial electron transfer process, where protons get electrons to generate adsorbed hydrogen atoms (Hads) on the surface of the catalyst. The second one is the Tafel reaction, in which the Hads combine with the protons of the electrolyte and obtain electrons at the same time to complete the electrochemical absorption process. The final step is the Heyrovsky reaction, a chemical desorption process, which is the formation of H2 molecules due to the recombination of two Hads atoms. The reaction equations of these three basic reactions are different in acidic and alkaline media, which can be visualized in Table 1.11,69–72

Generally, the catalytic performance of the catalysts towards HER activity based on these three principal steps can be evaluated by some standardized indices, which include overpotential (η), Tafel slope (b) and exchange current density (j0), turnover frequency (TOF), stability, the Gibbs free energy, faradaic efficiency (FE) and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA).39,73,74 Among all these indices, overpotential, Tafel slope and durability are the most widely used indices for evaluating the performance of HER electrocatalysts. In particular, a large overpotential leads to low energy conversion efficiency.74–79 Besides, theoretical Tafel slope values for the Volmer reaction, Heyrovsky reaction and Tafel reaction are 118, 39, and 29.5 mV dec−1, respectively.80
Although it is rather appealing to produce H2 electrochemically from water splitting, the rational development of active, durable, and inexpensive catalysts to enable a kinetically faster HER is the key step in the realization of a hydrogen energy society. Note that superb catalysts trigger proton reduction with minimal overpotential and have fast kinetics, achieving an energy-efficient HER. Encouragingly, MoS2 has emerged as an active, earth-abundant, and inexpensive H2 evolving electrocatalyst, presenting extraordinary HER activities. Both theoretical44 and experimental81 results have identified the edges of MoS2 as its catalytically active sites, but its basal plane is rather inert for the HER, which renders MoS2 with limited catalytic activities.12,40,82 In this regard, enormous progress has been made in the past decades for achieving higher catalytic performances of MoS2-based materials towards the HER. Therefore, in the following section, we will discuss some useful strategies for improving MoS2-based materials towards HER activity, which include doping, heterojunctions, MoS2 nanomaterials with conductive supporting materials, defect-MoS2 electrocatalysts, and turning the phase of MoS2 from 2H to 1T.
3.1 Doping
The introduction of foreign atoms into the lattice of catalysts is defined as doping.83 The weak van der Waals forces of MoS2 with a sandwich-like structure result in weak interactions between its layers, enabling MoS2 to be doped with various atoms during the crystal growth.84 Such doping treatment not only increases the density of active sites but boosts the intrinsic activity of S atoms, thus leading to more efficient electrocatalysis.85,86 It provides other advantages such as improved electronic carrier density, enhanced water adsorption, and phase transition, greatly enhancing the overall conductivity and reaction kinetics.40

Metal-atom doping. 
The introduction of metal atoms into the lattice of MoS2 offers the following: (i) new active sites (the doped metal atoms), (ii) vacancies or edge catalytic sites, and (iii) phase transition (from 2H to 1T), thereby leading to boosted HER performances.
Both the theoretical and experimental results suggest that the adsorption behaviour of H atoms and exchange current densities can be tailored by the doping of metal dopants in MoS2, resulting in excellent HER performances.87–89 Early in 2015, Deng et al.88 achieved higher activity by doping Pt atoms into few-layer MoS2, where the increased electronic states occurred around the Fermi level, leading to the enhancement of the H adsorption ability of basal S atoms. Ni-doping in MoS2 nanosheets was reported in another work, and the as-obtained Ni0.13Mo0.87S2 attained an overpotential of 98 mV and a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec−1. Ni incorporation dramatically decreased the kinetic energy barrier of the initial water dissociation step and enabled newly formed –OH to be desorbed.90 Zn-doped MoS2 was synthesized via the one-pot solvothermal method and DFT calculations indicated that doping with Zn atoms can quicken the thermodynamic and kinetic reaction of the whole process by increasing the number of active sites and modulating the electronic density of the catalyst (Fig. 2a and b), thereby resulting in enhanced HER activity (onset η = 0.13 V, Tafel slope 51 mV dec−1).91 Co as an element possessing great catalytic power towards HER is also used to improve the HER performances of MoS2.92,93 In Zheng's work, Co clusters were anchored on the basal plane of MoS2 to enhance the HER performances.92 The basal plane activity of MoS2−x was found to be improved by decorating S-vacancies with Co clusters, which implies the positive effect and great potential of modifying the intrinsic basal plane S-vacancy activity with Co atoms. Duan et al.94 synthesized Co-doped MoS2 electrocatalysts for the HER, delivering an overpotential of 137 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec−1 (Fig. 2c and d). The excellent HER performances can be ascribed to the enhancement of the hydrogen adsorption capacity, as well as higher electron density of basal plane S atoms (Fig. 2e and f). The authors also found that Co-doping can lead to an increase in the value of saturation magnetization and over 50% of S atoms in the basal plane of MoS2 can be activated for the HER process. In addition to the metals mentioned above, doping other metals to tailor MoS2 electrocatalysts for the HER is also feasible, such as Sn42 and Mn.95

Non-metal atom doping. 
The incorporation of non-metal dopants with atomic size to replace S atoms of MoS2 electrocatalysts can also adjust their catalytic HER performances by modifying their electronic properties and boosting the intrinsic conductivity.96 In 2015, Gong et al.97 prepared three representative samples by using Se as the dopant and among these samples, the MoSSe catalyst delivered the best HER results and strong durability as compared to the other two samples, bare MoS2 and MoSe2. Considering that the orbital orientation would play a vital role in improving the intrinsic properties of MoS2, Zang et al.98 prepared C-doped MoS2, in which C dopants produced empty 2p orbitals that are perpendicular to the MoS2 basal plane. Accordingly, this resulted in a substantial improvement in the water adsorption and dissociation, thus achieving a low overpotential.
The electronic structure of MoS2 can be effectively optimized by doping non-metal atoms with higher electronegativity such as N, O and F. In Xiao's study, N-doped MoS2 was synthesized by an optimized one-step sintering method and attained an overpotential of 121 mV (100 mA cm−2) and 41 mV dec−1 for the Tafel slope. The authors found that N atoms were doped on the edge as well as on the basal plane, which also enabled charges to be spread and transferred more quickly over the basal plane.99 In another work, DFT calculations suggested that doping O atoms into MoS2 can result in the formation of S and Mo vacancies and sharply decrease the Gibbs free energy, which are beneficial for HER performances.100 In Zhang's work,101 the activities of individual MoS2 nanosheets at the etched edge sites after F atom doping were measured by electrochemical microdevices, which indicated that pristine MoS2 nanosheets were five times less energized as compared to the activity of F-doped MoS2 nanosheets. These three experiments proved that doping with non-metal atoms having greater electronegativity is a promising strategy for HER activity improvement.


Dual-atom doping. 
Compared to single-atom doping, the co-doping of MoS2 provides more active sites (in both the basal plane and the edges), as well as further optimized capacity for H adsorption.102 Ni-Co-MoS2 nanoboxes with constructed defects have been synthesized by Yu et al.103 by simultaneously doping with Ni and Co atoms, which presented better HER activity with a small overpotential of 125 mV and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec−1. In another work, optimized hydrogen adsorption energy was achieved due to the activation of sulfur anions resulting from simultaneously doping Pd and Ru into MoS2 material.104 Liu et al.105 prepared MoS2 nanosheets with O and P doped together. Experiments revealed that the as-obtained P–O bond not only transformed MoS2 nanosheets into continuously integrated frameworks, which was conducive to the rapid transmission of electrons but also exposed more active sites for the HER process by preventing MoS2 agglomeration and stacking, leading to a preeminent HER activity (an overpotential of 277 mV and Tafel slope of 54 mV dec−1). Additionally, MoS2 has become more active toward hydrogen evolution via dual P and Se doping, presenting significantly optimized electronic structures and thus great HER performances (an overpotential of 277 mV and Tafel slope of 54 mV dec−1),106 much better than P-MoS2 and Se-MoS2, undoped MoS2 counterparts. Unlike pure metal doping or non-metal doping, Zheng et al.102 fabricated Co/Se co-doped MoS2 nanosheets with strong durability and a lower overpotential (382 mV) as compared to that of the 40 wt% Pt/C catalyst (671 mV) when at the same current density (1000 mA cm−2). Doping with Co/Se atoms simultaneously could enhance the formation of edges and change the electronic structures of the S atoms. These reports highlight that dual or multiple atomic incorporations offers a facile way to engineer HER catalysts with high activities.

3.2 Heterojunction
Apart from heteroatom doping, designing heterostructures is another forceful strategy for improving the HER performances of a catalyst by modulating the intermediate adsorption, regulating the electrochemical surface area, and introducing exotic catalytic sites. Moreover, both the core and shell of a heterostructure make contributions to improving the overall catalytic performances.40,107,108 Wu et al.107 synthesized the hierarchical MoS2@MoP core–shell catalyst for the HER with low overpotential values of 42 mV and 29 mV in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. MoS2 and MoP simultaneously make contributions to elevate the HER performance. The MoS2@MoP enabled the quick transfer of electrolyte ions and provided more active sites. Jiang et al.108 synthesized the MoS2/NiS heterostructure as a catalyst for the HER, achieving an overpotential of only 84.1 mV and the Tafel slope of 76.9 mV dec−1. The improved HER performance was ascribed to abundant active sites and low inherent resistance generated on the surface of the catalyst, resulting from the unique structural design. Hu et al.109 prepared a series of MoS2/metal oxide heterostructures that included MoS2/Ni2O3H, MoS2/Co3O4, and MoS2/Fe2O3. DFT calculations disclosed that the electronic modulations can be illustrated by the electroactive bonding and anti-bonding orbitals of the interface near the Fermi level (EF). MoS2/Ni2O3H exhibited the most intensive electronic distribution, leading to structure distortion, and presented a favorable HER catalyst because the electronically coupled interfaces with high electroactivity are vital in boosting the intrinsic catalytic activity of the HER process. Therefore, compared to other catalysts, the MoS2/Ni2O3H catalyst presented a lower overpotential of only 84 mV and a Tafel slope of 82.3 mV dec−1 (Fig. 3a and b).

Many novel heterostructures based on MoS2 are being designed to enhance HER performances. More heterostructures with improved electron transfer efficiency and optimized reactant adsorption and product desorption processes are thus expected in further research. These studies would, in turn, provide both theoretical and experimental guidelines for development and mechanism explorations based on MoS2.
3.3 MoS2 with conductive supporting materials
Selecting conductive supporting materials as the growth matrix for MoS2 nanomaterials to form a hybrid will help to ameliorate the catalytic activity for the following two reasons. (1) These carriers enable the electrons to be transferred more quickly and efficiently, thereby leading to higher HER kinetics. (2) The unique structure of these carriers enables H+ ions to have access to the active sites of MoS2 nanomaterials through the electrolyte.99,110,111 Carbonaceous materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanofibers have been proven to be effective matrices that can endow MoS2 with specific shapes, expand the interlayer spacing, and increase the conductivity, etc. Various MoS2/carbon nanohybrids with boosted HER performances have been reported in recent works.

Graphene. 
Li et al.76 demonstrated that growing MoS2 nanoparticles on graphene could result in the creation of abundant electroactive edges, enhancement of conductivity, and prevent MoS2 from aggregating, thus greatly advancing the HER activity. Accordingly, MoS2 nanosheets were anchored uniformly and perpendicularly on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as proposed by Deng et al.112 to tune the electronic properties of MoS2. This hybrid catalyst was prepared by a hydrothermal method and found to exhibit outstanding HER activity (Fig. 3c and d) and stability (overpotential of 172 mV, a Tafel slope of 43.5 mV dec−1, and durability of 3000 cycles). The excellent performances are ascribed to the formation of more active edges and improved electrical conductivity offered by using rGO as a substrate. Notably, the author also investigated the effect of graphene content and the results indicated that the optimal sample (15% graphene) is more conductive and exhibited the best HER activity. However, two distinct drawbacks still exist, which prevent us from getting satisfactory HER performance. Specifically, full use of active surfaces is hindered due to strong sheet-to-sheet π–π interactions, which leads to the restacking of graphene oxide. Besides, the amount of transferred electrons is still limited. Therefore, to solve these two problems, Zheng et al.113 prepared h-rGO@MoS2 by attaching MoS2 nanosheets to rGO hollow spheres, as shown in Fig. 3e; the synthetic process includes three main steps, namely, GO coating, hydrothermal reduction, and a SiO2 etching step. The enhanced HER activity can be ascribed to a unique 3D structure with a large surface area leading to more exposed electroactive sites.


Carbon nanotubes. 
Carbon nanotubes with unique structure, high specific surface area, low impedance, high conductivity and electrochemical stability, were applied to improve the electrochemical properties of MoS2 as well. By taking advantage of carbon nanotubes with N incorporation (NCNT), Li et al.114 synthesized the MoSx-NCNT forest hybrid as HER electrocatalysts with dense catalytical active sites and fluent charge transport, achieving an excellent corresponding performance (onset overpotential of 75 mV, overpotential of 110 mV, and Tafel slope of 40 mV dec−1). Liu et al.115 synthesized MoS2 nanosheets coated with single-walled carbon nanotubes (MoS2@SWNT) via a facile solvothermal method, affording an overpotential of 150 mV and the Tafel slope of 41 mV dec−1. The good HER performance resulted from decorating MoS2 nanosheets with SWNT, which not only enabled the exposure of more active sites, but also ensured good electrical communication between flexible substrates. Notably, these results were also confirmed by XANES analysis.


MXene. 
In addition to the above-mentioned carriers, in recent years, an inorganic material called MXene, with unique electronic conductivity (higher than carbon nanotubes, graphene or GO materials), large surface area and hydrophilic behavior, has come to the forefront. MXene can also facilitate electron transfer and is thus used as a carrier for MoS2-based materials towards the HER and has been widely reported.116–118
From the above works, it is rational to conclude that selecting high-conductivity materials as substrates for MoS2 electrocatalysts is a practicable way to enhance HER activity.

3.4 Defect-MoS2 electrocatalysts
One of the most powerful tools for designing various functional materials is utilizing elemental vacancies (also called defects) in materials.119 Promoting the density of the S vacancies of MoS2-based electrocatalysts to achieve better catalytic results is essential since they are regarded as active sites for the HER process, and defect/disorder engineering is regarded as an attractive way to make it come true.81,120
Early in 2013, Xie et al.121 reported that MoS2 nanosheets with controllable disorder engineering and incorporated oxygen (O) simultaneously achieved an overpotential of 300 mV at a current density of 126.5 mA cm−2, an onset overpotential of 120 mV, and Tafel slope of 55 mV dec−1. Their reports disclosed that a disordered structure enables more unsaturated sulfur atoms to be employed as active sites and interdomain electrons can be transported more quickly in the HER process, thus leading to a higher HER activity (Fig. 4a). In addition, oxygen incorporation also made indispensable contributions, which were confirmed by the decrease in the band gap, indicating that incorporation will modulate the electronic structure, and thus higher conductivity could be achieved (Fig. 4b). Similarly, Li et al.122 created and strained S-vacancies to further regulate the basal plane of monolayer 2H MoS2. Through DFT calculations, the authors found that the hydrogen adsorption free energy and the active site density could be effectively adjusted by increasing the number of S-vacancy sites. Experimental results further revealed that the catalytic activity of MoS2 could be ameliorated, which was inferred from a higher turnover frequency per S-vacancy site (TOFs-vacancy).

In Ajayan's work, monolayer MoS2 treated with H2 showed greater improvement in HER activity than that treated with O2 plasma, in that the H2 annealing treatment led to the higher density of the exposed edges, thus improving the HER performance of MoS2.123 Although satisfactory HER performance was achieved, both of these methods still have obvious drawbacks due to the requirements of high temperature, which hinder its application industrially. Therefore, a facile and environmentally-friendly strategy was proposed by Li et al.124 They obtained few-layer or even monolayer of MoS2 by exfoliating multi-layer MoS2via coupling ball-milling and the ultrasonic process without adding any chemicals and surfactants (Fig. 4c). The increasing HER activity could be attributed to introducing holes and lattice defects, which resulted in more active edge sites and basal planes, higher conductivity, and stronger hydrogen adsorption ability.
Although vacancies easily improve the HER catalytic activities of MoS2, the impact of vacancy states in addition to concentration on HER catalysis remains vague. In this regard, Wang et al.125 used DFT calculations to study the effects of S-vacancy concentration and distribution on the HER performance of MoS2 (Fig. 4d–f). They also fabricated homogeneously distributed single S-vacancies onto the MoS2 nanosheet surface. The optimal sample (12.11% single S-vacancies) exhibited a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec−1 and an overpotential of 131 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Their work highlights that both vacancy concentration and distribution can broaden the field of vacancy design.
3.5 Turning the phase from 2H to 1T
MoS2 naturally occurs as the 2H phase, which is thermodynamically stable. However, this simultaneously endows MoS2 with semiconducting properties, inevitably limiting the electrocatalytic activities, as well as charge-transfer kinetics, toward H2 generation.126 Notably, the metallic phase (1T) of MoS2 shows nearly 105 times the electrical conductivity as compared to its semiconducting phase (2H).127 Moreover, both edges and basal sites of 1T MoS2 are active for the HER while the basal plane of 2H MoS2 is inactive. Hence, 1T MoS2 with higher electrical conductivity and more electrochemically active sites would be more active for the HER than its 2H counterpart. However, 1T MoS2 reverts to the 2H phase with time or heat due to its instability.128 Despite this drawback of the 1T MoS2, phase engineering still plays a vital role in achieving superior HER performances of MoS2 by simultaneously improving the conductivity and creating more active sites.129–131 This strategy was pioneered by Lukowski et al.132 and Voiry et al.133,134 Generally, chemical exfoliation, electrochemical intercalation, assisted exfoliation, and inducing S-vacancies, etc. can result in phase transition and enhanced intrinsic activity of MoS2-based materials.135–138 Hence, in this section, we systemically review recent advances in successfully transforming the phase of MoS2 from 2H to 1T when it comes to the HER.

Doping. 
As mentioned previously, doping can induce phase transformation, resulting in higher HER performance. Attanayake et al.139 introduced Ni and Co atoms into the distorted 1T phase of MoS2 under hydrothermal conditions. DFT calculations showed lower energy after Ni or Co atom doping. Ni or Co-modified metallic MoS2 presents prominent HER activity with lower overpotentials of −145 mV and −165 mV (10 mA cm−2) and smaller Tafel slopes of 110 mV dec−1 and 124 mV dec−1, respectively. Gao et al.84 simultaneously used Co and Ni atoms to help to transform the phase of MoS2 from 2H to 1T via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. It was found that co-doping results in more phase transition than doping atoms separately, leading to the highly pure 1T phase. Compared to 2H MoS2, the interaction between the Mo and S sites of 1T MoS2 was much lower. Also, the catalytic activity for the HER was enhanced in alkaline media, which was ascribed to a greater number of active sites. Moreover, in contrast to 2H MoS2, Co-MoS2 and Ni-MoS2, the Co, Ni-MoS2 sample exhibited lower Gibbs free energy values that were closer to zero (the Gibbs free energy is an important parameter for assessing the catalytic performance, and the criterion for judging whether catalytic performance is excellent is a value that is close to zero.84). Researchers also found that compared to other active sites, Co was better. According to Xiong et al.'s report,140 P was incorporated into metallic MoS2 nanosheets supported by N, P,S-codoped hierarchical flowerlike carbon (HCMF) hybrids via a hydrothermal reduction route after dopamine self-polymerization as well as a molybdate process. The phase of MoS2 was transformed from 2H to 1T, and S vacancies were created. In addition, researchers found that S vacancies and P dopant, as well as conductive and tensile carbon as the support, play an important role in hampering the barriers of nanosheets from agglomerating. Doping elements or ion intercalation not only results in 1T MoS2 but also brings abundant active sites by introducing defects, as well as decreasing the band gap. As such, Deng et al.141 simultaneously doped N atoms and PO43− by selecting the conductive matrix vertical graphene (VG) as a support to achieve the phase transition of MoS2. The conversion from 2H MoS2 to 1T MoS2 was confirmed by the XRD powder diffraction peaks and the S 2p and Mo 3d spectra of the as-obtained samples. The co-doping method is an efficient way to achieve 1T MoS2. (N,PO43−)-MoS2/VG catalysts exhibited superior HER activity with a lower overpotential of −85 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a smaller Tafel slope of 42 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, better than other samples, making (N,PO43−)-MoS2 a potential material for accelerating water electrolysis.


Electrochemical intercalation. 
Apart from doping, electrochemical intercalation is also an effective way that is widely used. In 2013, Jin and co-workers132 firstly reported a phase transition from 2H MoS2 to 1T metallic MoS2via chemical exfoliation by lithium intercalation (Fig. 5a) and the as-prepared catalysts delivered an overpotential of 187 mV. Compared to 2H MoS2 (110 mV dec−1), the much lower Tafel slope obtained by 1T metallic MoS2 (43 mV dec−1) further suggests that this phase transition profoundly improved the reaction kinetics (Fig. 5b). The greatly boosted HER catalysis can be attributed to the phase transition from 2H MoS2 to 1T MoS2, which not only facilitates electrical transport and electrode kinetics but also leads to the formation of new catalytic active sites. In the same year, Voiry et al.134 also obtained 1T MoS2 nanosheets by intercalating lithium ions. With low overpotentials of ∼100 mV, 1T MoS2 nanosheets greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Researchers also inferred that the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism (including two steps, a primary discharge step and the third recombination step76) is responsible for the HER because the desorption of hydrogen confines the rate of increase, leading to a lower Tafel slope (40 mV dec−1). Furthermore, after oxidizing the edges of MoS2 nanosheets, TEM and STEM images showed that the basal plane of the nanosheets remained stable while the edges were highly disordered. Moreover, HER measurements indicated that the catalytic performance of 2H MoS2 decreased after oxidizing, while that of 1T MoS2 remained preserved. Hence, they concluded that the basal plan instead of edges serves as the main active sites of MoS2 nanosheets. This experiment also demonstrated that ion intercalation could change the phase of MoS2, resulting in two different phases of MoS2 (2H and 1T) existing simultaneously within a single nanosheet. Attanayake et al. also utilized intercalating cations to achieve the transition of the phase of MoS2.142 They firstly intercalated the lithium by using LiBH4 and n-butyl lithium as reducing agents to convert 2H MoS2 to 1T MoS2. Then, the metallic monolayer of MoS2 nanosheets was prepared by exfoliating LixMoS2 in water. Co2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, and Na+ ions were added to the solution individually to prepare the target products. Smaller overpotentials were achieved while values of the Tafel slope remained stable, implying that such intercalation will not affect the reaction mechanism (Volmer–Heyrowsky). Besides, H+ reduction kinetics were boosted as the surface charged and interlayer spacing between the sheets was reduced. The Gibbs free energy of H-adsorption (ΔGH) also decreased after metal ion intercalation treatment, especially Na+ intercalation, resulting in a ΔGH close to zero. This work highlights the importance of growing 1T-MoS2 layer by layer with different intercalants to understand the layer dependence and interlayer distance effects in HER catalysis.

Hydrothermal method. 
The hydrothermal method is considered as a common route for preparing 1T/1T′ MoS2. In early 2015, Cai et al.143 turned 25% of the 2H phase into the 1T phase by introducing sulfur vacancies into 2H MoS2 nanosheets via a two-step hydrothermal method. Ding et al.144 synthesized 1T MoS2 through a hydrothermal method under a strong magnetic field, and the as-obtained samples exhibited strong electrochemical performance and stability. In 2016, Geng et al.145 fabricated metallic MoS2via a pressurized hydrothermal process by using MoO3 as the precursor in water. They found that M-MoS2 samples presented high stability ascribed to the existence of the water molecule layer, which prevented the agglomeration and stacking of the M-MoS2 and maintained its original octahedral structure. M-MoS2 has excellent catalytic activity towards HER with an overpotential of −175 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec−1. Liu et al.146 reported that 1T MoS2/CC synthesized via a hydrothermal method also afforded better catalytic activity.


Other methods. 
Zhu et al.147 proved that 2H-1T phase boundaries of MoS2 can serve as new highly active sites for the HER reaction to over-regulate its activation performance. The catalysts obtained also exhibited strong durability and scalability. Wang et al.148 achieved partial phase transition and fabricated 1T-2H MoS2 heterostructures through the one-pot annealing treatment of bulk 2H MoS2 in the mixing of two different gases, phosphorous vapor and Ar, as depicted in Fig. 5c. Phosphorous can lead to the expansion of MoS2 and also facilitate a part of the phase transition of MoS2 during the process. In addition, higher conductivity and more exposed active sites simultaneously made great contributions to the enhancement of the catalytic performance for HER activity. This strategy has also been utilized by Liu et al.,149 although they used sulfur vapor to take place of Ar vapor.

4. Applications of MoS2-based materials in NRR activity
Compared to the industrial Haber–Bosch process, using catalysts and renewable electricity to drive electrochemical nitrogen fixation provides a new strategy for ammonia production under ambient conditions.150–152 There are two common parameters used to evaluate whether the catalysts are efficient or have higher activity, namely faradaic efficiency (FE) and NH3 yield rate (VNH3). Faradaic efficiency reflects the selectivity of products in the ammonia synthesis process. The value can be obtained by dividing the number of electrons required for nitrogen reduction by the total number of electrons in the loop (formula 1), and the NH3 yield rate reflects the amount of NH3 produced per minute, which can be calculated by formula 2.153,154 VNH3 = n × F × C × V/M × Q(1)(n = 3: the number of electrons required to produce ammonia; F = 96485.33, Faraday constant; C: concentration of NH3 obtained; V: the volume of the electrolyte; M = 17: relative molecular mass of NH3; Q: the number of electrons transferred during the reaction). FE = C × V/t × S(2)(the definitions of C and V are mentioned above; t: the reaction time; S: the amount of catalyst loaded or the area with catalytic activity in the entire reaction).
For the NRR, two basic mechanisms are responsible for the process, namely, the dissociative pathway and associative pathway (Fig. 6). The dissociative pathway (Fig. 6a) is like the Haber–Bosch process, which involves high energy to cleave the strong NN triple bonds to ensure the combination of single N atoms and H atoms to form NH3. The associative pathway (Fig. 6b and c) is much more complicated than the dissociative pathway because of the influence brought by stable NN triple bonds and the sequence of combining a single N atom with a single H atom to form NH3. DFT calculations play an important role in deeply understanding these reactions, for instance, by estimating the Gibbs free energy during the process in the specific reaction pathways.68,155–159

The accurate detection of NH3 and the by-product N2H4 produced is important for calculating the FE and NH3 yield rate. The FE and NH3 yield rate of a catalyst can reflect its catalytic performance toward the NRR. Since N2 reduction to NH3 is a 6-electron reaction, which is extremely complicated, and accurate measurement often involves difficulties and challenges. Therefore, this data should be quantified precisely so that we can obtain reliable statistics. Hence, in this short section, we discuss the methods used to detect NH3 and N2H4 and some strategies that can be used to avoid unnecessary errors.160,161 Currently, five common methods are widely employed by researchers to determine the total production of NH3 in aqueous media during the process, which include the indophenol blue method, salicylate method, Nessler's reagent method, ion chromatography method, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance method. The advantages and shortcomings of these methods can be clearly visualized in Table 3; accordingly, it is necessary to choose these methods reasonably.19,162–166 Only recently, after a detailed analysis of these detection methods, Zhao et al.167 found that if these methods are used in combination, the detection of low NH3 content in the solution can be solved. The accurate detection of the total production of NH3 can be achieved at extremely low concentrations (lower than 1 ppm or even 0.2 ppm) according to their reports. Liu et al.160 systematically summarized the sources of unforeseen errors in the NRR activity and provided corresponding countermeasures (Table 4 systemically summarizes these errors and related methods based on their reports). At the same time, they pointed out that it is necessary to re-examine and explore the electrocatalytic activity of previously reported or new materials. In addition to the accurate detection of produced NH3, sometimes the ammonia produced in our experiments is a result of adventitious contamination rather than electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation, thus, identifying the source of nitrogen should also be taken seriously. According to Yang and co-workers, experiment control plays a vital role in eliminating the contamination while conducting the NRR tests, which includes three main experiments (blank or background control experiments, Ar-based control experiments, and 15N-isotopic labeling experiments).168

Understanding the competition between the HER activity and NRR activity is also important. To be more specific, in the electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation reaction system based on an aqueous electrolyte, two reactions simultaneously occur at the cathode due to the similarly balanced electrode potential. One is the 6-electron nitrogen reduction reaction, which requires the potential to cleave the strong NN triple bonds, and the other is the 2-electron competitive reaction, as discussed in section 3, the HER process. Although the NRR seems to have certain advantages thermodynamically, the six-electron NRR to NH3 is more complicated than the two-electron HER process. Generally, the HER tends to dominate in terms of kinetics, which generates unwanted H2 and hinders effective contact between the catalyst surface and the N atom (most protons and electrons tend to form H2 rather than NH3), leading to rather low conversion efficiencies of the NRR process. Therefore, suppressing the HER will be the priority.169–171 Although competition occurs between the HER and NRR activity, considering that nitrogen fixation is highly determined by the Mo and S elements in nitrogenases, MoS2-based electrocatalysts are still active for the NRR which was confirmed by us theoretically and experimentally.45 It is worth noting that the edge sites of MoS2 act as the active sites for two electrochemical activities.172
4.1 Doping
Heteroatom-doping is a powerful way to improve the electrocatalytic performances of MoS2.153 As aforementioned, chemical doping with metals or non-metals has been proven to be a good strategy for boosting the HER activity of MoS2. Likewise, MoS2 can also be doped with metal heteroatoms to boost the NRR performances.
Very recently, Fe-doped 2H MoS2 showed considerably improved NH3-producing activity as compared to the un-doped counterpart, indicating that the doped Fe indeed promoted the N2 reduction process. Theoretical calculations (Fig. 7a) revealed that the enhanced NRR activity was independent of the location of doped Fe.173 Interestingly, MoS2 with bimetal-doping (Ni and Fe) was reported as a new promising NRR catalyst, exhibiting trimetallic synergistic interactions and thus great NRR performances (an NH3 yield rate of 128.17 μg h−1 mg−1cat. and FE of 11.43%) in Chen's work.174

Apart from doping with Fe atoms, other transition metals such as Co have also been used as dopants to enhance the catalytic performance of MoS2 towards the NRR. Zhang et al.175 devised a novel type of active site for the NRR in 2H-MoS2−x atomic layers by introducing Co atoms into MoS2−x with sulfur vacancies. From the EDAX (energy-dispersive X-ray analysis) results of the as-fabricated Co-doped MoS2−x, Co atoms automatically substituted for the Mo atoms and no clusters were formed. DFT calculations revealed that Co-doping decreased energy barriers from 1.62 to 0.59 eV, and thus the overpotential. Great improvements in both FE (1.7% to 10%) and NH3 yield rate (0.32 mmol g−1 h−1 to 0.6 mmol g−1 h−1), as well as the NRR selectivity of S-deficient MoS2−x nanoflowers, were achieved.
4.2 MoS2 with conductive supporting materials
Li et al.176 synthesized MoS2-rGO as a catalyst for the NRR. The large surface of rGO guaranteed the neat distribution of MoS2 nanosheets, leading to abundant exposed active sites, contributing to a preeminent NRR performance with FE of 4.56% and an NH3 yield rate of 24.82 μg h−1 m−1cat.. DFT calculations revealed that the distal pathway was inert, while the alternating pathway was more active during the process and only entailed an energy barrier of 0.49 eV that could drive the formation of *NH2NH2 from *NHNH2. Despite the great efforts that have been devoted, the achieved NH3 yield rate and FE are still unsatisfactory. Therefore, Liu et al.177 came up with a new strategy to utilize rGO, which significantly enhanced the electron transfer. In their work, lyophilization and thermal treatment methods ensured that the surface of rGO was coated with MoS2 nanodots, and was named MoS2 NDs/rGO. Owing to the unique structure that enabled the uniform distribution of MoS2 NDs, more defects were exposed to serve as active sites. Reaction kinetics were visibly improved owing to the successful construction of strong C–S–C bonds. Therefore, the as-obtained catalyst presented a prominent NRR activity with a high FE of 27.93% and an NH3 yield rate of 16.41 μg h−1 m−1. MoS2 NDs/rGO also revealed good durability, exhibiting a slight decrease in the NH3 yield rate after 10 continuous cycles (from 12.07 μg h−1 m−1 to 16.41 μg h−1 m−1).
Apart from graphene, graphitic-C3N4 is also a good support for MoS2 nanomaterials to build a hybrid. To create more active sites for the NRR process and activate NN triple bonds, Zhao et al.178 fabricated the MoS2/C3N4 hybrid via a pyrolysis strategy. Growing MoS2 nanosheets on C3N4 resulted in a crystal with a honeycomb structure. Except for more exposed active sites, Mo–N coordination was formed to improve the NRR performance due to strong interactions between MoS2 and C3N4. The as-prepared catalysts showed faster NRR kinetics (the smallest semicircular diameter from Nyquist plots), more active sites (the largest value of Cdl) and a better NRR activity with FE of 6.87% and NH3 yield rate of 19.86 h−1 m−1cat., both at −0.5 V, as compared to bare MoS2 and C3N4. Xu and co-workers179 also took advantage of g-C3N4 nanosheets by attaching 1T-MoS2 nanodots to them. The 1T-MoS2/g-C3N4 achieved an NH3 yield of 29.97 μg h−1 m−1cat. and FE of 20.48%. The authors used two different strategies to confirm that NH3 was produced from the electrochemical N2 reduction. UV-Vis adsorption spectra showed the peak intensity after NRR electrolysis under two different conditions: (i) Ar-saturated solution at −0.3 V (Fig. 7b) and (ii) N2-saturated solution at open circuit potential (Fig. 7c). The 1H nuclear magnetic resonance method was also used, as shown in Fig. 7d. Both the UV-vis adsorption spectra and NMR spectra confirmed that N2 was reduced to NH3 electrochemically on 1T-MoS2/g-C3N4. DFT calculations disclosed that an alternating pathway and associative distal pathway with a lower energy barrier are the best reaction pathways.
4.3 Heterojunction
Similarly, heterojunction design also provides a promising method for improving the catalytic performance of MoS2 towards the NRR. A novel 2D/2D MoS2/C3N4 heterostructure with the exposure of a set of Mo edges was prepared by Chu et al.180via a facile solvothermal treatment. DFT analysis suggested that the MoS2/C3N4 heterostructure has more occupied state electrons at the Fermi level than MoS2 and C3N4 alone, thereby enabling a massive number of electrons to be transferred more rapidly and efficiently, showing better NRR kinetics. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7e and f, compared to bare MoS2 (0.87 eV), the MoS2/C3N4 heterostructure only entailed the reaction energy barrier of 0.55 eV, enabling the formation of *N2H and efficiently suppressing the HER activity. Therefore, the as-prepared heterostructure achieved a high NH3 yield rate of 18.5 μg h−1 m−1 and FE of 17.8%. Xu et al.181 reported that MoS2 on carbon cloth with electrodeposited Fe(OH)3 to form a heterostructure was active for NRR, reaching an NH3 yield rate of 4.23 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 and FE of 2.76%. Owing to the great adsorption of N2 molecules and H+, as well as suppressing the HER of Fe(OH)3, it was an efficacious way to hybridize with MoS2 to form a heterostructure, resulting in higher NRR performance. Jiang et al.182 utilized Cu2−xS quantum dots as a substrate, prepared the Cu2−xS/MoS2 heterostructure and achieved an NH3 yield rate of 22.1 μg h−1 m−1cat. and FE of 6.06%. Four factors contributed to the enhanced NRR performance, which include successfully suppressing the HER, quick electron transformation, increased nitrogen adsorption capacity and electrochemical active surface area.
4.4 Defect-MoS2 electrocatalysts
As discussed previously, both the NRR and HER share the same active sites of MoS2-based electrocatalysts, that is, the edges sites of these materials.183 However, the basal plane of MoS2 is also inert for the NRR.184 Therefore, we fabricated defect-rich MoS2 nanoflowers to expose the active sites in the basal plane, which was denoted as DR MoS2, presenting a FE of 8.34% and an NH3 yield rate of 29.28 h−1 m−1cat. (Fig. 8a), as well as strong durability.183 It is widely acknowledged that abundant defects can result in the expansion of lattice and distorted edges, leading to greater catalytic performance for the NRR. As shown in Fig. 8b–d, DFT calculations revealed that bare Mo atoms can transform the inter-N2 into a more active one when defects exist but the energy barrier of the PDS (0.6 V) needs to be overcome. Ma et al.185 also introduced defects to MoS2 nanosheets for better NRR activity. The as-prepared materials were named Vs-MoS2. The successful formation of sulfur vacancies did not change the original crystal phase; however, characteristic peaks of XRD were altered from narrow to broader, indicating the existence of a set of defects. Besides, the enrichment of Mo atoms also resulted in the appearance of defects. As shown in Fig. 8e, Vs-MoS2 exhibited better catalytic properties than DF-MoS2 (defect-free MoS2). Fig. 8f indicates that among all the as-obtained catalysts, when the ratio of Mo atoms and S atoms was 5:2, the catalyst presented the best performance, affording a FE of 4.58% at −0.4 V and an NH3 yield rate of 46.1 × 10−11 mol s−1 cm−2 at −0.5 V. Zeng et al.186 introduced sulfur vacancies to MoS2 materials by doping with N atoms and successfully obtained N@MoS2 nanoflowers. The speed of electron transfer can be improved due to the enhancement of conductivity brought by N atoms. Besides, faster NRR kinetics and lower energy to drive the process together made non-negligible contributions for higher performance. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 8g, compared to the bare MoS2 catalyst, the N@MoS2 catalyst achieved a better NRR performance with a FE of 9.14% and an NH3 yield rate of 69.82 μg−1 h−1 mg−1cat., both at −0.3 V. The as-prepared catalyst provided better catalytic performance, ascribed to the existence of more sulfur vacancies as well as more active sites. Similarly, a sulfur vacancy-rich MoS2 resulting from the doping of P atoms was reported as a new promising NRR catalyst, exhibiting a FE of 12.22% and an NH3 yield rate of 60.27 μg−1 h−1 mg−1cat., both at −0.6 V in Fei's work.187 Liu et al.188 designed MoS2 catalysts with different defects for NRR activity. The DFT calculations of free energy and the Bader charge of every intermediate revealed that compared to the other two samples, VMo-MoS2 (molybdenum-vacancy defect) and D-MoS2 (sulfur and molybdenum-vacancy defect), Vs-MoS2 (sulfur-vacancy defect) had the lowest limiting overpotential (0.48 V) along the enzymatic pathway. In addition, as shown in Fig. 8h, Vs-MoS2 also presented an outstanding NRR performance among the as-obtained three samples, affording a FE of 4.58% at −0.3 V and an NH3 yield rate of 29.55 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.5 V, making MoS2 nanosheets with defects potential catalysts towards NRR activity.

4.5 Other methods based on MoS2 nanomaterials for the NRR
Liu et al.189 constructed strong Li–S interactions by taking advantage of a Li+-containing electrolyte and the S-edge sites of MoS2, which led to greater electron transfer. DFT calculations revealed that the improvement of the H* adsorption energy on both S-edge sites and Mo-edge sites is ascribed to the strong interactions between S-edge sites and Li+ in the electrolyte, indicating that the HER activity was effectively suppressed. The as-obtained catalyst exhibited a prominent NRR performance with a high NH3 yield rate of 18.5 μg h−1 mg−1 and FE of 9.81% at −0.2 V in 0.1 M Li2SO4, better than its catalytic performance in 0.1 M Na2SO4, since in the Na+-containing electrolyte, the HER activity was not retarded. In another work, MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) were fabricated to achieve superior NRR performances (an NH3 yield rate of 39.6 μg h−1 mg−1 and a FE of 12.9%) to MoS2 nanosheets,190 highlighting the great potential of MoS2 QDs for efficient NH3 synthesis by the NRR. MoS2 QDs presented good durability with stable NH3 yields and FEs during the cycling tests. DFT calculations demonstrated that the NRR proceeds via an energetically-favored enzymatic pathway on the MoS2 QDs catalyst, resulting in a low overpotential of 0.29 V.
5. Applications of MoS2-based materials in CO2RR activity
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) as a promising carbon utilizing strategy can suppress the greenhouse gas emission from the overuse of fossil fuels by converting CO2 into useful products, and also effectively storing renewable energy.191,192
Similar to the NRR, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction proceeds via a series of proton and electron transfer reactions, producing diverse products including C1 products (C, CO, HCOOH, CH2O, CH3OH, and CH4), C2 products (H2C2O4, C2H4, and CH3CH2OH) and other chemicals, which greatly depend on the cathodic catalysts.193 These products are identified and analysed by using gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.194
CO2RR contains three main steps, including (1) CO2 adsorption and interaction on the catalyst surface, (2) electron/proton transfers catalyzed by catalysts, and (3) the desorption of CO2 reduction products (Fig. 9a).193,195–197 Notably, electrochemical CO2RR involves multiple proton-/electron-transfer processes and thus is highly complex. This inevitably leads to sluggish kinetics and low faradaic efficiency for a specific product. In addition, the low solubility of CO2 in most solvents and the CO bond with high dissociation energy (750 kJ mol−1) make the CO2 reduction process energy consuming and kinetically slow. Hence, it is extremely desirable to develop electrocatalysts that will not only exhibit attractive catalytic activity, selectivity and stability, but also facilitate high-efficiency CO2 conversion.22,192,197–200

MoS2 possesses high CO2RR activity close to that of noble metals.201,202 Bulk MoS2 for the CO2RR in aqueous electrolytes has been reported by Asadi et al.201 and Francis et al.203 Moreover, through the comparison of the economics of CO2RR products by Bushuyev et al.,204 CO, formic acid, ethylene, aldehydes and methanol are the most promising target products, which can be used to produce substitutes for fossil fuels in the future. Based on this point, in the following section, the recent progress in MoS2-based catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction are mainly classified into two main categories, CO2RR to CO products and CO2RR to ethanol/methanol products.
5.1 CO2RR to CO products
As was mentioned before, CO is one of the most common products of CO2 reduction, and is thermodynamically formed at −0.11 V.205 In this section, CO2 reduction to CO based on MoS2 electrocatalysts is briefly discussed.
Amorphous 2D-molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) on a polyethyleneimine (PEI)-modified GO substrate was developed by Li et al. to catalyze the CO2RR (Fig. 9b), and the as-prepared catalyst performed brilliantly in terms of the FE and overpotential (85.1% and 140 mV respectively) to convert CO2 into CO. The excellent CO2RR performance of rGO-PEI-MoSx is attributed to the inhibition of the HER activity by PEI, which also ensured the long-term stability.206 Controlling the ratio of CO2 to H2 plays an important role in determining the product yield, hence, Lv et al.207 came up with a new method for the CO2RR. As shown in Fig. 9c and d, by changing the humidity of the electrode and the applied potential, the ratio of CO and H2 also changes accordingly, and the as-obtained high FE proved the enhancement of the CO2RR activity brought by hydrophobic exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets, as compared with E-MoS2 nanosheets. DFT calculations revealed that the HER activity can be efficiently retarded due to the decrease in the energy barrier. Li et al.208 combined N-doped carbon with edge-exposed 2H MoS2 to get a hierarchical hollow catalyst (NCMSH), as shown in Fig. 9e. DFT calculations indicated that on selecting NC as the support, there were more exposed active sites and greater electron transfer. Hence, high catalytic performance towards CO2RR can be achieved through NCMSH, providing the selectivity of the conversion of CO2 to CO with a FE of 92.68% at an overpotential of 590 mV and a CO production rate of 34.31 mA cm−2, both at −0.7 V.
Lv and his co-workers209 used a one-pot solvothermal method to fabricate N-MoS2@NCDs catalysts (NCDs refers to N-doped carbon dots). According to the different reaction temperatures during the synthesis process, the researchers obtained 3 samples with different doping concentrations of nitrogen atoms, and compared to the other two samples (N-MoS2@NCDs-200 and N-MoS2@NCDs-220), the N element content of N-MoS2@NCDs-180 was the highest, which was 8.35 at%. The increase in conductivity can be attributed to the coverage of NDCs on the MoS2 surface. DFT calculations showed that only a small energy barrier (0.76 eV) needs to be overcome to drive the generation of COOH*. Therefore, the N-MoS2@NCDs-180 catalyst exhibited prominent performance in CO2 transformation into CO with a FE of 90.2% at −0.9 V and a relatively lower overpotential of 130 mV. Yu et al.210 fabricated 3D TiO2@MoS2 as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. DFT calculations revealed that the electric properties of the MoS2 layer and adsorption characteristics of Mo exposed edges were modulated due to the successful formation of Ti–S bonds. In addition, the binding energy of CO2 and the energy barriers of CO2 reduction reaction pathways declined, contributing to the successful transformation of CO2. During the following experiments, high FE (∼82%) for CO2 conversion to CO was confirmed at −0.7 V vs. RHE, which proved that the as-prepared catalyst delivers an impressive electrochemical activity. Shi et al.211 used Cu nanoparticles to modify MoS2 and synthesized the Cu/MoS2 composite as a catalyst for CO2 reduction, delivering a maximized FE of 85.48% at −1.4 V vs. SHE. This satisfactory electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the enhancement of the electronic conductivity and CO2 adsorption properties.
5.2 CO2RR to other products
Other products such as methanol and ethanol can also be produced on MoS2-based electrocatalysts. Hu et al.212 reported a new CO2RR method in which CO2 can be converted to methanol at room temperature. In their experiment, sulfur vacancy-rich MoS2 was selected as a promising catalyst because the dissociation of CO–O and the activation of H2 can be effectively balanced, and also H2 on the sulfur vacancies can be activated at a relatively lower temperature. DFT calculations disclosed that the selectivity of methanol production can be enhanced due to sulfur vacancies. Hence, the as-prepared catalyst exhibited prominent CO2 reduction with the selectivity of methanol of 94.3% and the CO2 conversion of nearly 12.5% at 180 °C. The catalyst also showed robust durability. Qi et al.213 fabricated TiO2/MoS2 nanosheets to convert CO2 into ethanol. Decorating MoS2 with TiO2 did not change the original morphology of the MoS2 material but resulted in more exposed active sites due to the neat distribution of TiO2 on the surface of MoS2. The TiO2/MoS2 catalyst achieved CO2 reduction with a FE of 50% and a partial current density of 1.2 mA cm−2, both at −0.6 V.
6. Conclusions and perspectives
As the environmental issues and energy crises are receiving increasing attention, the pursuit of efficient and robust catalysts for energy electrocatalysis such as the HER, NRR, and CO2RR continues to ignite the passion of researchers. Among the numerous developed catalysts, MoS2 is regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to noble metals, exhibiting intriguing catalytic properties. Recent years have witnessed substantial research progress in MoS2-based nanocatalysts for energy catalysis. In this review, we have summarized the most representative improvements in MoS2-based electrocatalysts for the HER/NRR/CO2RR. Herein, the structure and synthetic methods of MoS2 were briefly reviewed, then the basic concept and common parameters of HER activity were discussed. Common methods that can be employed to regulate electrocatalysts towards HER activity, which include doping, heterojunction, MoS2 with conductive supporting materials, defect-rich MoS2 electrocatalysts, and phase transition from 2H to 1T were summarized. Some strategies for phase transition have also been exploited, including doping, electrochemical intercalation, hydrothermal preparation and other methods. By modulating the limitations of 2H MoS2 structures, these strategies greatly improved the performance of MoS2-based catalysts. In the second section, we summarized the recent progress in MoS2-based electrocatalysts towards NRR activity. We discussed the basic reaction pathways, evaluated parameters and some methods, as well as potential errors in the accurate detection of the amount of produced NH3. Useful methods that have been reported in recent years were discussed, including doping, MoS2 with conductive supporting materials, heterojunctions, defect-rich MoS2 electrocatalysts, along with other methods such as construction of Li–S interactions and the utilization of MoS2 quantum dots. Finally, we discussed recent advances in MoS2-based catalysts for CO2 reduction. Two main categories were systematically introduced, including CO2RR to CO products or other products. The reported studies and the performances of MoS2-based electrocatalysts are systemically summarized in Tables 2, 5 and 6.

Although a large number of methods have been successfully conducted, visible challenges and bottlenecks still exist, and the following aspects should be considered in the future.
(1) The exploration of various simple, scalable, and low-cost synthetic methods of MoS2-based materials continues to be an exceedingly active field for its electrocatalysis.
(2) In order to make full use of MoS2-based electrocatalysts to achieve high performance in the fields of energy-related reactions, many modified methods have been reported so far, which have been covered in this review. However, current research on MoS2-based electrocatalysts is still confined to laboratories and their production quantities still have room for improvement; therefore, in the future, promoting industrial applications will be the priority.
(3) Stability is an important determinant of catalytic performances. Although 1T MoS2 has more outstanding advantages than 2H MoS2 and presents huge potential in the fields of energy electrocatalysis, its instability (easily transformed back to the 2H phase over time or at high temperatures128) renders limited industrial applications. Future investigations into the stabilization process are thus expected to facilitate systematic control over the catalytic activity of MoS2 nanocatalyts.
Other phases of MoS2 have also been investigated for HER electrocatalysis, nonetheless, phase conversion involving these phases during catalysis is often ignored. MoS2 commonly adopts one of three polymorphs (i.e., 2H, 1T, and 3R).214 The 3R phase does not occur naturally; high-temperature methods have to be employed for its synthesis. Apart from 2H and 1T MoS2, the 3R-MoS2 also attracts some interest for the study of electrocatalysis.215,216 While the electrochemical performance of 2H and 1T phases have been studied extensively, the performance of 3R for the HER has only been reported in two scientific papers.216,217 Additionally, similar to 1T MoS2, the 1T′-phase MoS2 is also a polymorph of MoS2 found in recent years.218 It evolves from 1T MoS2 but is relatively stable, which has also been studied towards HER catalysis.117,219–221
(4) Although a large number of publications on MoS2-based electrocatalysts for the HER have emerged, as shown in Table 2, their catalytic performance still has room for optimization, the same as for the NRR. For the CO2RR, very little work has been done. Therefore, in the future, the different reactions require different emphasis.
(5) Providing deep insight into the mechanisms through the combination of experiments and theoretical calculations (e.g., DFT calculations) represents one crucial direction, which not only presents us with a comprehensive picture of complex reaction pathways such as the NRR process, but also help us to design targeted catalysts. Different methods for characterizing the structure of MoS2 also deserve much attention.
(6) In addition to the fields of HER/NRR/CO2RR activity, in just the past few years, owing to its superior electronic properties and capacities, MoS2 has also been widely employed in a wide range of applications such as the environmental applications,222 electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),223 NO reduction,224 supercapacitors,225 sensors,226 secondary batteries (e.g., Li-ion batteries (LIBs),227 Li–S batteries,228 Li–O2 batteries,229 Na–S batteries,230 Na–O2 batteries,231 Mg-ion batteries,232 Al-ion batteries,233 and Na-ion batteries,234etc.), and antibacterial activity.235 Therefore, in the future, further exploration of the various applications of MoS2-based materials is encouraged.

Indophenol blue method	Intervened slightly by nitrogen-containing compounds or sources, and various electrolytes	Less accurate at high concentration and in acidic media
Salicylate method	Less poisonous and volatile substance	Time and reagent consuming
Nessler's reagent method	Less time-consuming and fewer required reagents	Calculations of the NH3 yield rate will be disturbed in metal ion-containing media (e.g., Ru3+, Ce3+, and Fe2+)
The reagent contains mercury, which is harmful
Ion chromatography method	High sensitivity, selectivity and good reproducibility	Expensive operating equipment
Ions with the same retention time may interface with each other

1H nuclear magnetic resonance method	Highly effective	Expensive

Nitrogenous catalyst	Pre-treat the electrocatalyst material before the experiment several times to prevent potential pollutants such as some nitrogen-containing substances from interfering with the final experimental results.
Electrolyte environment	A stable electrolyte environment should be achieved by using a buffer system instead of the natural salt.
Electrolyte purity	When using lithium salt as an electrolyte, researchers not only need to test the purity of the reagents used, but must also test the purity of the electrolyte.
Gas purity	The experimenter needs to check the purity of the nitrogen used and the purity of the control test gas.
Membrane separators	The membrane that is completely inert and has the least amount of NH3 absorption or release during the experiment is the first choice.
Detection method	
Table 3 has already summarized five common methods for NH3 detection, and the experimenter should choose the best one based on the situation.
Background subtraction	Perform multiple experiments under different conditions and select data that has undergone background correction.
Reporting the experimental details	Introduce and report in detail all experimental methods and data, equipment used; do not exclusively focus on the final statistics.
Selectivity and faradaic efficiency	Clearly explain which parameter to use for performance judgement, and elucidate the data calculation process and source.
