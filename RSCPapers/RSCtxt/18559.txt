    , Accepted 20th June 2021First published on 22nd June 2021AbstractAs an emerging and growing family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides, MXenes have received increasingly close attention due to their intriguing surface features, excellent electrical conductivity, and layered structures. The spatial conditions ascribed by the nanostructure of MXene-based photocatalysts are the decisive factor for their surface and interface characteristics, which play a vital role in expanding the light response range and inhibiting the recombination of photoinduced carriers. Although some reviews focus on the properties, synthesis strategies, and applications of MXene-based photocatalysts, there is still a lack of a comprehensive review that can provide the basis for MXene-based photocatalysts from the perspective of spatial conditions created by various nanostructures. In this review, we systemically summarize the action principles of surfaces and interfaces in MXene-based photocatalysts and highlight the impact of spatial conditions on surface and interface engineering by analyzing recent research on MXene-based photocatalysts. Furthermore, we put forward the advantages and challenges of the research direction of MXenes and MXene-based photocatalysts in the future.
1. Introduction
Currently, the global situation of energy shortage and environmental crises is becoming increasingly severe. Due to the properties of ecological friendliness, photocatalytic technology is capable of energy storage,1 hydrogen production,2 nitrogen fixation,3 pollutant degradation,4,5 and reduction of carbon dioxide;6–8 thus, it is a promising approach to solve the current energy and environmental problems. Photocatalytic technology has aroused broad research interest and has been put into practical applications. However, traditional semiconductor photocatalysts such as TiO2, ZnO, and CdS exhibit disadvantages such as rapid recombination of electrons and holes, limited solar energy utilization, and low electrical conductivity.9–11 Thus, photocatalytic technologies have not been applied on a large scale.12 The low photocatalytic efficiency leads to higher costs for large-scale industrial applications. Therefore, it is of significant importance to find high-efficiency photocatalysts.
New members of the 2D material family are discovered continuously, which provides a basis for developing new photocatalysts. 2D transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are emerging 2D materials that were discovered recently. The structural formula of MXenes is generally Mn+1XnTx, where M, X, and Tx represent early transition metals, C and/or N (n = 1, 2, 3 or 4), and surface functional groups, including –F, –O, and –OH or some combination of them, respectively.13,14 Grayson Deysher et al. reported a new type of MXene named Mo4VAlC4 with n = 4 in 2019.14 Before that, the traditional structure of MXenes was only n = 1, 2, or 3. MXenes are obtained from 3D layered ceramic materials named MAX phases by a selective etching of the A element. A represents an element from groups 13 and 14 of the periodic table, such as Al, Si, and P (Fig. 1).15,16 MAX phase is a layered ternary carbide and nitride that has attracted extensive attention for its magnetic properties and unique atomically laminated structures.15 Ti3C2Tx, which could represent the larger family of MXenes, was firstly synthesized by selective etching of Ti3AlC2 by Naguib et al. in 2011.17 To reflect the family's composition and emphasize its similarity to graphene, it was given the name “MXene” as a composite of M, X, and part of the word “graphene”.13 In 2013, the successful preparation of monolayer MXene flakes opened the door to formally exploring the nature of MXenes.18 Since then, research on MXenes has increased, as single-layer 2D materials are dangling-bond-free atomic sheets, exhibiting remarkable electronic and optical properties.19 Therefore, monolayer MXene flakes with single or few-atom thicknesses can be used in various fields due to their extraordinary properties. In addition to the advantages of 2D materials, MXenes have other attractive properties, including outstanding hydrophilicity, chemical stability, metallic conductivity, element tunability, and environmental friendliness.13,20,21

At present, MXenes are widely used in photocatalysis, such as hydrogen production, pollutant degradation, and carbon dioxide reduction.23–26 The surface properties of MXenes have interesting effects on the hydrophilicity and bandgap. The unique surface terminals can achieve a tighter interface between the MXenes and other materials, which will shorten the migration path of photoinduced carriers. Due to all of these features, the application of MXenes in photocatalysis is attracting extensive attention. The bandgap adjustment, influenced by the type and number of surface functional groups, allows the formation of band-matched interface structures between MXenes and other materials, such as Schottky junctions. Simultaneously, the tunability of the bandgap allows MXenes to switch roles between metal and semiconductor.
The currently reported MXenes are mainly applied with other materials as co-catalysts because only a few MXenes present semiconductor features. The metallic properties can enable them to collect electrons or holes to enhance the separation of photoinduced carriers. Some MXenes display semiconductor characteristics upon increasing the specific gravity of the hydroxyls at the surface terminations or decreasing the layers. By adjusting their defect structures, MXenes can also show semiconductor properties. Due to the semiconductor properties of MXenes, they have the potential to be freestanding photocatalysts, which we will discuss later. Additionally, the family of MXenes are 2D materials with large specific surface areas; therefore, they readily agglomerate in air. Based on their lamellar characteristics and hydrophilicity,27 MXenes can be used to randomly match other materials of various forms, such as 2D nanosheets, 0D nanoparticles, or 1D nanowires. The adorned photocatalysts are called MXene-based photocatalysts. Nanostructures of MXene-based photocatalysts will cause disparate spatial conditions for the transfer of photoinduced carriers at the interface, which will have a meaningful impact on enhancing the photocatalytic performance.28 Compared with single-component semiconductor photocatalysts, MXene-based photocatalysts have superior photocatalytic efficiency, including expanding the optical response range and reducing the recombination of photoinduced carriers. Surface and interface engineering play central roles in the research of MXene-based photocatalysis. (1) The large surface functional groups bring hydrophilic surfaces to the MXenes, which is conducive to forming close contact between MXenes and the host photocatalyst, thereby providing a flexible channel for separating photoinduced carriers under irradiation.1 (2) Unlike MoS2, whose activity is mainly limited to the edges, the large-area 2D-based surface of MXenes is active.29,30 Therefore, the large contact surface area of the material interface facilitates the separation of photoinduced carriers in the two materials and inhibits their recombination. (3) The bandgap of MXenes can be adjusted by the type and number of surface functional groups, facilitating the design of excellent heterojunction interfaces. Therefore, surface and interface engineering are predominant strategies for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts (Fig. 2).

In the composite of different materials with MXenes, a large-scale lattice mismatch will not occur at the interface, while some point defect structures can exist.19 Lattice mismatch can affect the defect structures of materials, which is an essential factor in studying the composite structures. The lattice problems arise from the structural characteristics of the precursor MAX phase and the synthetic method of the MXenes. The synthesis method can generate a wide range of surface defects.31 The defective structures of MXenes are not detrimental to the photocatalysts because they can provide more active and monoatomic-doped point sites to improve the performance of photocatalysis. Due to the high specific surface area inherited from 2D materials, it is sufficient to form the intimate interface, and even 2D semiconductors have widespread defects.32,33 The unique hydrophilic surface features and impressive electrical conductivity facilitate the formation of prominent surface contact with other semiconductor materials and form an interface with other semiconductors, promoting the separation of photoinduced carriers. In surface and interface engineering, due to their excellent conductivity, MXenes act as electron trappers in forming the Schottky junction to inhibit recombination of photoinduced carriers.
To date, there have been many reports on MXene-based photocatalysts; however, most of them are focused on specific synthesis methods and applications.1,13,34–40 We will present the main contents of several reviews on MXene-based photocatalysts to further explain this view. The separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers resulting from the nanostructure of the photocatalyst has attracted wide attention from researchers. However, in surface and interface engineering, reviews involving the perspective of spatial conditions brought by various nanostructures have not been collated systematically. You et al. started with the synthesis route focusing on MXene-derived 0D quantum dots (MQDs). Then, they proposed an improvement strategy for the defective structures of MXenes by improving the synthesis route. In addition, the design and application of MXene-based photocatalysts have been thoroughly analyzed.41 Anasori et al. reviewed the synthetic strategy, structure, and performance of MXenes and then summarized the application of MXenes in energy storage.13 Sharma et al. mainly outlined the synthetic methods and photocatalytic applications of MXenes and MXene-based photocatalysts.34 Sun et al. summarized the four classic synthesis strategies of MXene-based photocatalysts in detail.35 Recently, Lim et al. outlined the latest strategy of MXene-based photocatalysts in the design of industrial applications in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and photoelectrocatalytic applications.36 Additionally, Xie et al. detailed the function of MXenes in MXene-based photocatalysts.37 Gao et al. and Cheng et al. summarized the relevant contents of MXenes from the specific application fields of the hydrogen evolution reaction and solar fuel generation.1,38 Kuang et al. mainly outlined the role of MXenes in MXene-based photocatalysts and introduced the specific application areas of MXene-based photocatalysts in detail.39 In the aspect of surface and interface engineering, Peng et al. reviewed the structural, optical, and electronic properties of MXenes.40 Numbers of researchers have continuously explored the mystery of MXene-based photocatalysts. Relevant reviews have also covered the structure, performance, application, and other aspects of MXene-based photocatalysts with their emphasis.
We investigated some current reports of MXene-based photocatalysts with different nanostructures, including 2D/2D, 0D/2D, and other nanostructures. In this review, the mechanism and performance of MXene-based photocatalysts are analyzed from the perspective of synergistic spatial conditions. Our work indicates that surface and interface engineering plays a vital role in guiding the design of MXene-based photocatalysts. We also summarize some types of MXene-based photocatalysts with various nanostructures, such as 0D/2D and 2D/2D combinations, to analyze their enhanced photocatalytic performance in spatial conditions. Through statistical analysis of dozens of MXene-based photocatalysts, the effects of different nanostructures on photocatalytic performance are compared. We studied the regulatory influence of diverse spatial conditions on the surface and interface engineering from the point of view of practical applications to clarify the impact of the nanostructures of MXene-based photocatalysts on the migration of photoinduced carriers. Su et al. considered that the MXene-based 2D/2D interface is the most helpful for forming large interface areas, excellent stability, and numerous catalytic active sites.42 At the same time, we discuss the regulating semiconductor properties of MXenes. Finally, we provide summative remarks about the development of MXene-based photocatalysts, indicating the directions for future action in this promising field.
2. Challenges faced by traditional photocatalysts
The development of traditional photocatalysts is facing a problem that is widely accepted. A narrower band is needed to enlarge the optical response range, and in contrast, a wider band is required to reduce the recombination of photoinduced carriers; meanwhile, it is difficult to realize both effects simultaneously in traditional photocatalysts. In the process of photocatalysis, an appropriate energy band structure and a high separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers play vital roles because they ensure thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility. If the energy of the photon is greater than the width of the bandgap, the electrons in its valence band (VB) will be excited into the conduction band (CB), and holes will be created in the VB. Semiconducting materials with a narrow bandgap have a wide range of photoresponse, which is also conducive to the excitation of electrons in the VB. However, an additional result is that the electrons in the CB and holes in the VB can recombine rapidly to produce heat or some other emission form, which is a disadvantage. The holes in the VB and electrons in the CB contribute to active species formation in the photocatalytic process to achieve oxidation or reduction reactions such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, and pollutant degradation.12,23,43
The key to improving photocatalytic performance is to inhibit the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and expand the range of photoresponse. However, in the case of traditional single-component photocatalysts, these two conditions cannot be met simultaneously. Therefore, new kinds of photocatalysts need to be designed to solve these problems. To date, various strategies have been developed to realize this process, such as creating heterojunctions,43,44 element doping,45,46 co-catalyst loading,47 defect engineering,48 crystal-facet engineering,49 and modification with carbon materials.50,51 The construction of MXene-based 2D/2D heterojunctions is one of the most promising approaches because MXenes have unique properties that facilitate the formation of special interface structures between the two materials to enhance the separation of photoinduced carriers.42
3. The role of surface and interface engineering in MXene-based photocatalysts
3.1 Surface engineering of MXene-based photocatalysts
Due to the etchant used to synthesize MXenes from the precursor of the MAX phase, the surface of the MXenes produced is not bare but contains some functional groups, such as –F, –OH, and –O. The etching conditions will affect the type and number of surface functional groups of MXenes, such as the etching agent concentration and reaction temperature. Research on the properties and applications of surface functional groups in MXenes has long attracted scholars' interest. For example, Kurtoglu et al. studied the electronic and mechanical properties of bare MXenes.52 Peng et al. compared the effects of MXenes with –OH and –F surface functional groups on lead ion adsorption. They claimed that MXenes containing –OH have a more vital ability to adsorb lead ions than MXenes containing –F.53 Xie et al. studied the conversion relationship of the functional groups on the surface of MXenes. They found that the –F would spontaneously convert into –O or –F in water.54
In the field of photocatalysis, the surface characteristics of MXenes play a strategic role. The influence of surface termination on MXene-based photocatalysts is reflected in the following three aspects. (1) The hydrophilicity of MXenes depends on their surface functional groups. Besides, as channels for the separation of photoinduced carriers, the surface functional groups are associated with the formation of intimate interfaces with other materials.22 (2) The band structures of MXenes can also be adjusted by the type and number of surface functional groups of MXenes, leading to a change of the redox activity. (3) The surface functional groups of MXenes provide many active centers, which can significantly affect the adsorption and activation of the target molecules.55 Therefore, whether MXenes are used as photocatalysts alone or in combination with other semiconductors to form an MXene-based photocatalyst, surface characteristics have to be taken into account.
The types of surface functional groups of MXenes are demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,22 and the content ratio between the three kinds of functional groups is quantified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).22,58 However, EDS cannot distinguish between –O and –OH. Meanwhile, interlayer water and etching by-products will affect the judgment of the surface functional groups of MXenes. Therefore, the results are not objective. At present, HF and fluorinated salts (such as LiF/HCl) are commonly used as etchants. Hope et al. studied the effects of these two etchants on Ti3C2Tx surface groups using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.56 As shown in Fig. 3(a), in Ti3C2(OH)xFyOz prepared with HF and LiF/HCl, the –OH accounts for fewer functional groups, while the –F and –O account for more. The MXenes synthesized with HF have a larger proportion of –F, while MXenes synthesized with LiF/HCl have a larger proportion of –O.56 Because the work function (W) of MXenes is not intrinsic, it can be adjusted by surface functional groups due to the dipole effect. Liu et al. found that –O always increases W, while –OH decreases W,57 as shown in Fig. 3(b). They reported the mathematical relationship between W and the surface dipole moment of MXenes.57 By defining the relationship between the WT of MXenes with surface terminations and the Wbare of bare MXenes, ΔW was studied as WT = Wbare + ΔW(1) ΔW = C·ΔDS + EF(2)where ΔW is the change of W of the MXenes affected by the surface terminations. ΔW is associated with the evolution of surface dipole moment density (ΔDS) and Fermi level shift (ΔEF) induced by surface terminations. ΔDS can be studied by the change of charge density on the material surface (Δρ). Research shows that the O termination always leads to positive ΔDS and OH termination always leads to negative ΔDS, while the effect of F termination on ΔDS depends on the specific MXene.57 Therefore, the surface terminations of MXenes affect W by the influence of the surface dipole. The difference between the W values of two materials forms the contact potential difference (CPD) between the materials, enabling the creation of an internal electric field (IEF) and facilitating the separation of photoinduced carriers at the interface.59 Therefore, the surface functional groups of MXenes can be adjusted by experimental means to change the W of MXenes. An efficient IEF can then be formed between the MXenes and other semiconductors to enhance the separation of photoinduced carriers on the two materials. Experimental results show that the ratio of O/F can be increased/decreased by etching with LiF/HCL instead of HF, and the concentration of –OH can be increased by alkalization.56 The surface functional groups of MXenes can also be adjusted by applying a high-temperature electrochemical potential treatment.54,57 Therefore, both the adjustment of the IEF and the provision of active sites are inseparable from the surface and interface features of MXene-based photocatalysts.

3.2 Internal electric field of MXene-based photocatalysts
In addition to surface considerations, interface characteristics of MXene-based photocatalysts should be considered because the surface functional groups of MXenes enable control of their band characteristics, which can influence the migration of photoinduced carriers at the interface of MXene-based photocatalysts. Growing attention is being paid to studying the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic performance of MXene-based photocatalysts. The critical method to improve activity has two directions: improving the separation of photoinduced carriers and expanding the optical response range. A narrower bandgap is needed for a single catalyst to develop the optical response range, while a wider bandgap is required to enhance the separation of photoinduced carriers.60 However, the two requirements cannot be met simultaneously. In a photocatalyst with multiple materials, as long as the photoinduced carriers can migrate to two materials efficiently, narrow bandgap materials can be selected for a more extensive optical response range. Therefore, MXene-based photocatalysts can effectively do both, attracting the attention of researchers. Thus, the surface and interface engineering of MXene-based photocatalysts is the key to solve this problem.
The enhanced separation of photoinduced carriers is mainly due to the difference in W between the two materials and the IEF generated at the interface. The dipole inside the photocatalyst primarily causes an IEF without additional energy consumption.61 The production of the IEF is essentially caused by the uneven distribution of charge in the photocatalyst, which leads to different electronegativities of the constituent cells.59,62 The orderly arrangement of these unit cells with additional charges produces a dipole moment, which creates a local IEF.63 From Fig. 4, the IEF can be generated between the layers of layered materials and the crystal surfaces of the unit cells.64,65

The close contact between 2D MXenes and other semiconductor nanocrystals promotes interface structure formation, facilitating the transfer of photoinduced electrons and holes. Ti3C2Tx MXenes are widely studied, and they possess exhibited metallic properties.66,67 Due to the metallic properties of most MXenes, the Schottky junction is formed at the interface in the MXene-based photocatalyst, which is a type of interface between the semiconductor and the metal. The IEF in the Schottky junction is one of the factors that enhances the separation of photoinduced carriers. IEF engineering is a promising strategy for guiding the separation of photoinduced carriers in the photocatalytic field.
The surface energy level below the Fermi level is full of electrons. Due to the different Fermi levels of the two materials in contact with each other, the electrons are transferred from the high Fermi level material to the low Fermi level material, which will balance the discontinuous Fermi energy. This phenomenon is beneficial to form CPD between the two materials and accumulate a dipole layer at the interface.68W refers to the amount of energy required to move electrons from the Fermi level to the free spaces of the metal surface. For semiconductors, there are no electrons at the Fermi level. Therefore, the W of a semiconductor refers to the electron affinity, which is precisely the amount of energy required to move electrons from the bottom of the conduction band of the semiconductor to the free space outside the semiconductor surface. Therefore, the CPD is the difference in the work functions of the materials, which forms the IEF at the interface.69 The IEF drives the transfer of photoinduced carriers to realize directional migration, thereby reducing the recombination rate of photoinduced electron–hole pairs.
Therefore, IEF engineering is an impressive strategy to improve the performance of photocatalysts.59,61,70 Due to the role of the IEF, the Schottky barrier will appear at the material interface when the MXene is coupled with a semiconductor. MXenes can serve as an electron storage library, promoting the separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs.71
3.3 Type of the interface between materials
The heterojunction is a concept that describes the phenomenon in which the IEF between the MXene and the primary catalyst improves the performance of MXene-based photocatalysts. There are many studies on heterojunctions; however, the relationship between various interface types has not been investigated systematically. Currently, two concepts are accepted widely, namely, the generalized heterojunction and the exact heterojunction (type I and type II heterojunctions), in the narrow sense. Some studies consider that a heterojunction is a generalized interface used to transmit electrons and holes, and others believe that a heterojunction is merely an interface between semiconductors. Some reports refer to the interface structures formed by their synthesized MXene-based photocatalysts as Schottky junctions, without mentioning the concept of heterojunctions.72,73 In some experimental papers, when the photocatalytic mechanism of a new MXene-based photocatalyst is reported, the mechanism diagram of the Schottky junction is drawn, and a text explanation is written that the junction is a heterojunction.74 These reports agree with the generalized heterojunction statement that a Schottky junction is a kind of heterojunction. At present, most researchers endorse the concept of generalized heterojunction; however, they will expressly point out that this kind of interface structure is a Schottky junction.71,75,76 According to the separation and transfer mechanisms pf different carriers, the generalized heterojunction concept mainly includes type I heterojunctions, type II heterojunctions, p–n heterojunctions, Schottky junctions, Z-scheme heterojunctions, and S-scheme (or step-scheme) heterojunctions.60,77,78 The narrow sense of the heterojunction concept only includes type I heterojunctions and type II heterojunctions. In comparison, the p–n heterojunction, Schottky junction, Z-scheme heterojunction, and S-scheme heterojunction are juxtaposed with heterojunctions. There are additional classifications of heterojunctions. For example, heterojunctions can be divided into homotypic heterojunctions (p–p junction or n–n junction) and heterotypic heterojunctions (p–n or p–n). Multilayer heterojunctions are called heterostructures. The generalized heterojunction concept is often used when it is emphasized that the interface enhances photoinduced carrier separation. We believe that the narrow sense of the heterojunction concept is clearer from the point of view of the mechanism. The six interface types will be elaborated on in the following paragraph.

3.3.1 Type I heterojunction and type II heterojunction. 
As shown in Fig. 5(a), in a type I heterojunction, the valence band (VB) of semiconductor A is lower than that of semiconductor B, and the conduction band (CB) of semiconductor A is higher than that of semiconductor B. The electrons and holes of semiconductor A are both transferred to semiconductor B. Therefore, it makes no prominent contribution to inhibiting the separation of photoinduced carriers in the type I heterojunction.79 In Fig. 5(b) (type II heterojunction), the VB and CB of semiconductor A are lower than those of semiconductor B. Thus, holes are transferred from semiconductor A to semiconductor B and electrons from semiconductor B to semiconductor A to achieve the higher separation effect of charge carriers and improve the photocatalytic performance.80 However, a type II heterojunction is not decisive in separating electrons and holes, and photoinduced carriers still have a greater tendency to recombine. Therefore, the p–n heterojunction system is designed based on the type II heterojunction (Fig. 6).

3.3.2 p–n heterojunction and Schottky junction. 
In addition to inheriting type II heterojunction characteristics, the p–n heterojunction generates an electric field at the interface between the p-type and n-type semiconductors to enhance the separation of photoinduced carriers.79 The Schottky junction is formed between the metal and semiconductor. At the interface of the two materials, electrons are transferred from one component to the other,81,82 achieving the separation of carriers (Fig. 5(c)). In this system, electrons can flow through the photocatalyst interface to the metal co-catalyst, from the higher Fermi energy level to the lower Fermi energy level, and adjust the Fermi energy level until thermodynamic equilibrium is reached. The co-catalyst has an excessive negative charge near the interface, while the semiconductor has a positive charge. Thus, a space charge layer is formed on the interface, causing the CB and VB curve to “bend upwards”. The space charge layer leads to the development of the Schottky junction between semiconductors and catalysts, known as the metal–semiconductor (MS) heterostructure. Therefore, the Schottky junction can be used as an electron trap to effectively capture photoinduced electrons and enhance the photocatalytic activity.43,81,83


3.3.3 Z-scheme heterojunction and S-scheme heterojunction. 
Z-scheme heterojunctions are among the most prevalent interface types in recent years since they were proposed in 1979 based on the natural photosynthesis of plants.84 The interface mechanism of the Z-scheme heterojunction is shown in Fig. 5(d). The semiconductors A and B have an interlaced band structure.85 The holes in the VB of semiconductor B react with the electrons in the CB of semiconductor A, which causes the remaining electrons and holes in the two semiconductors to participate in the reduction and oxidation reactions.86 The bonding of the holes and electrons in the two semiconductors is not a simple direct reaction but an indirect response between the intermediate electron donor and the electron acceptor.60 A traditional Z-scheme heterojunction has some disadvantages, such as harsh application conditions, side reactions, light-shielding, and pH sensitivity.60,87 As a result, the scheme was modified to the all-solid-state Z-scheme and direct Z-scheme, in which the direct Z-scheme heterojunction has no intermediate.88,89 The S-scheme heterojunction interface mechanism is shown in Fig. 6, and a new concept recently was put forward by Xu et al.60 The S-scheme heterojunction is similar to the type II heterojunction and p–n heterojunction. The type II heterojunction and p–n heterojunction strengthen the separation of photoinduced carriers. However, the photoinduced carriers accumulate on the CB and VB of the two kinds of semiconductors and still tend to recombine. The S-scheme heterojunction recombines the meaningless photoinduced carriers to minimize the separation of photoinduced carriers.90–93
Of the six types of heterojunctions, only the Schottky junction is formed from semiconductors and metals, while the remaining types are formed from semiconductors and semiconductors. Our work mainly discusses the interface formed by a combination of 2D MXenes with other semiconductors. Due to the bandgap's dependence on the surface groups, MXenes can exhibit metal properties and semiconductor properties.94 Therefore, the interface type in an MXene-based photocatalyst can include all the above types, especially the Schottky junction.


3.3.4 Schottky junctions in MXene-based photocatalysts. 
Due to the high metallic conductivities (6000–8000 S cm−1) and surface characteristics, which result in hydrophilicity and bandgap adjustability of MXenes, there are many reports about MXene-based photocatalysts.20 At present, the most studied interface type of MXene-based photocatalysts studied is the Schottky junction. MXenes primarily act as co-catalysts for the electron acceptor due to their metal properties.
As described in the surface engineering section above, Yuan Yue Liu et al. proved the relationship between the surface terminations and W of MXenes.57 The W of MXenes indicates their ability to acquire electrons. However, the enhancement of MXenes on composite photocatalysts is also related to the Schottky barrier (SB). Electrons need to go over the SB to reach the co-catalyst and achieve separation of photoinduced carriers. Therefore, a lower SB, preferably zero or negative, is advantageous. The SB is related to the W of the metal, the energy gap of the semiconductor, and its doping type and concentration. If the W of an MXene is favorable for capturing electrons, if the SB is too high, the photoinduced carriers cannot be separated efficiently. The Schottky barrier height (Φ) is generally defined as Φe = ECBM − EF(3) Φh = EF − EVBM(4)where Φe and Φh are the Schottky barrier heights of the electrons and the holes, respectively. CBM and VBM represent the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band, respectively. Without considering the defect structure, the interaction between the metal and the semiconductor can be ignored in the interface. The following formula can be obtained from the relationship between the W and the Fermi energy level: Φe = ECBM0 + WT(5) Φh = −WT − EVBM0(6)where ECBM0 and EVBM0 are the energies of the CBM and VBM under vacuum conditions, respectively.
Yuan Yue Liu et al. studied two groups of materials with lattice mismatch rates of less than 3% and greater than 5%. They concluded that the SB of 2D MXenes is related to the level of the W and the weak van der Waals forces at the interface. It can be seen that the W has a significant influence on the SB of electrons and holes. The MXenes with lower W have a lower SB in the MXene-based photocatalysts. Therefore, the electrons can “climb” the lower SB to the co-catalyst easily, realizing carrier separation. However, the ability of MXenes with low W to capture electrons will be reduced. Therefore, it is necessary to select appropriate MXenes or adjust them to achieve coordination between the ability of the catalyst to capture electrons and the height of the SB to achieve the optimal separation efficiency of photogenic charge carriers.

4. Defect engineering of MXene-based photocatalysts
The application of defect engineering can further improve the efficiency of the surface and interface engineering of MXene-based photocatalysts. The defect structures of materials generally include bulk defects and surface defects. In surface and interface engineering, surface defects often play a more critical role. Surface defects can provide many active sites to facilitate photocatalytic reactions.95,96 There are many kinds of crystal defects in materials, such as point defects, line defects, planar defects, and bulk defects, according to their dimensional morphology.48 The defect structures of 2D materials, including graphene and MoS2, have been widely studied. As typical representatives of the 2D material family, MXenes also have defect structures. The forms include control point defects and one-dimensional atomic arrays on two-dimensional sheets.97 Among them, point defects are most widely used, including the entry of single atomic catalysts such as platinum, iridium, and palladium into host sites to enhance the efficiency of the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), generation of amine from carbon dioxide, and other applications.98 For example, Pt atoms have been doped in the Mo vacancies of Mo2TiC2Tx to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction.99 The defect structures of MXenes will affect many properties, including nanostructures, surface groups, and magnetic and electronic properties.100,101
The MXenes with ordered vacancies are mainly caused by the corrosion process of the etchant and can be adjusted by the etchant concentration.21,102 Studies have found that when MXenes are produced from the MAX phase with an etching agent, the higher the concentration of the etching agent, the greater the number of defects that will be created in the synthesized MXenes, which will affect the stability of the MXenes.21 Indeed, the choice of etching also depends on the type of MXene to be synthesized. The larger the atomic number of the M element, the more stringent the etching conditions will be. Both experimental observations and theoretical calculations are used to study the defect structures. For example, high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) imaging can be used to observe the crystal structure and defect configurations,103 and calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) can predict how the material properties will be influenced by the defect structure. Sang et al. studied the atomic defects in single-layer Ti3C2Tx. The HAADF-STEM images and DFT simulations of the Ti vacancies (VTi) observed in monolayer Ti3C2Tx are shown in Fig. 7(a and b).21 It is of great significance to study the properties of crystal defects. Defect structures have an exciting impact on the performance of MXenes, and this area has attracted much attention. However, there are few studies on the design of defect structures in photocatalysis to adjust the band structures of MXenes to improve their photocatalytic performance. In most MXenes or MXene-based photocatalysts, defects are primarily applied to generate active sites and to serve as vacancies for monoatomic doping.

Atomic defects can be found in all materials.100 In MXene-based photocatalysts, MXenes are usually not the only materials that can increase the number of active sites by creating vacancies. For instance, the existence of molybdenum vacancies in MoS2 introduced a large number of active sites for a MoxS@TiO2@Ti3C2 photocatalyst, as shown in Fig. 7(c and d), which improved the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction.104 It was demonstrated that the method of vacancy doping helps adjust the bandgap of MXenes and facilitates the formation of excellent band matches with different materials to build an appropriate internal electric field, which can enhance the photocatalytic performance of MXene-based photocatalysts.105
5. Advances in surface and interface engineering in MXene-based photocatalysts with controllable nanostructures
In recent years, pure photocatalysts such as TiO2 and g-C3N4 have been widely studied. However, because of the limitation of the bandgap, the effect is not ideal. The usual improvement is to add co-catalysts such as Pt, MoS2, and graphene to capture electrons and reduce the recombination of photoinduced carriers. Pt is the most effective co-catalyst for photocatalysis, but its wide use is difficult owing to the scarcity and high price of precious metals.
MXenes can be a highly efficient co-catalyst for their superior performance, such as excellent electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and abundant active catalytic sites. Simultaneously, the productive surface groups render it hydrophilic, which is conducive to combination with other materials. In addition to serving as an electron acceptor, MXenes can change the CB and VB positions of the photocatalyst, narrowing the energy bandwidth and enhancing the light collection ability.106 Synthesis methods of MXenes have been reviewed in detail, such as HF etching, fluorinated salt etching, ammonium hydrogen fluoride etching, etc. Taking Ti3C2Tx as an example, the principle of these methods is that HF etches the aluminum layer of Ti3AlC2. It can be seen that the existence of protons and fluoride ions is a necessary condition for the synthesis of MXenes from their MAX phase precursors.107 The fluorinated salt and ammonium hydrogen fluoride methods differ from the HF etching method in that they can widen the layer spaces of Ti3C2Tx. Fluorinated salt etching achieves this by inserting Li+ into the lays of Ti3C2Tx,58 while ammonium hydrogen fluoride etching widths the Ti3C2Tx layer spaces by inserting NH3 and NH4+ into them.108 In addition, the post-processing methods and storage conditions of MXenes affect their surface terminals.109 Both the synthesis method and the post-treatment process determine the chemical properties of MXenes, affecting the surface characteristics and chemical stability of MXenes.110 For example, the surface terminals of Ti3C2Tx were changed under different gas conditions,72,109 ultrasonic treatment was performed in layered solutions (dimethyl sulfoxide, isopropyl alcohol, etc.) to expand layer spacing,40 and hydrothermally assisted intercalation (HAI) was used to improve the yield of Ti3C2Tx and reduce structural defects.111 Due to the security risks of corrosion, a large number of fluoro-free etching agents are also used to synthesize MXenes, including tetramethylammonium hydroxide,112 flaky KOH,113 molten ZnCl2 salt,114 and molten CuCl2 Lewis salt.115 The methods indicated above can synthesize MXenes by etching off the A layer in the MAX phase. MXenes can also be synthesized by etching off the MA or AX layer in the MAX phase.116
Unlike the rigorous synthesis conditions for MXenes, the requirements for the synthesis of MXene-based photocatalysts are relatively straightforward, such as the self-assembly method and in situ growth method. Self-assembly can be driven by electrostatic gravity because there is always a high negative charge on the surface of Ti3C2Tx. When the primary catalyst in an MXene-based photocatalyst is positively charged, the electrostatic force can cause them to attract each other for easy hybridization.117,118 Self-assembly can also be achieved by evaporation induction119 and mechanical mixing (grinding or stirring).118,120,121In situ growth is also a common method for forming MXene-based photocatalysts, mainly through calcination,122 hydrothermal,123 and solvothermal methods.124 The in situ growth method mainly appears in MXene-based photocatalysts with 0D/2D nanostructures because MXenes can be used as precursors to generate TiO2 and other materials, most of which generated 0D nanoparticles. The most significant difference between the hydrothermal method and the solvothermal method is that the solvothermal method can better control the interlayer space of Ti3C2Tx by changing the inserted solvent.110,125
Due to the 2D material character of MXenes, in the presence of a monolayer or fewer layers, they very readily aggregate or produce folds, which reduces the active centers and destroys the separation of photoinduced carriers. Thereby, they must be loaded on other substrates to play a better role. MXenes synthesized by hydrofluoric acid etching will generate rich surface terminal Tx on the edge and basal planes,126 which plays a vital role in improving the photocatalytic performance of MXene-based photocatalysts by increasing the hydrophilicity and enhancing the close contact between the MXenes and the host catalyst. The increase of hydrophilicity can promote the ability of MXene-based photocatalysts to capture water molecules and hydrogen ions. The close contact between MXenes and the host catalyst can provide stable channels for electrons or holes to transfer and thus inhibit the recombination of photoinduced carriers. On the basis of surface engineering, interface engineering can further enhance the efficiency of MXene-based photocatalysts. The role of interface engineering is to improve the separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers, while the role of surface engineering is to capture more water molecules and hydrogen ions so that the photoinduced carriers separated at the interface can be used to generate active substances such as superoxide radicals or hydroxyl groups. 2D/2D and 0D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts are the most widely studied. Moreover, the MXene-based photocatalysts formed by the combination of three substances showed better performance.
Although there are many reports on MXene-based photocatalysts, there is still a lack of reviews of the mechanisms of surface and interface engineering of MXene-based photocatalysts from the perspective of morphological modulation of nanostructures. The 2D/2D and 0D/2D forms have different characteristics, both in the synthesis and application fields. Therefore, a review in this regard will help provide references for the following synthesis methods of MXene composites and their corresponding photocatalytic properties. We analyzed the surface and interface engineering of MXene-based photocatalysts from the perspective of nanostructures and morphological modulation. Various nanocrystals (NCs), including nanosheets (NSs), nanoparticles (NPs), nanowires (NWs), and nanofibers (NFs), are discussed. According to the content of our review, the MXene-based photocatalyst performance produced by different synthesis methods can be judged to select the appropriate way.
5.1 2D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts
The interface types, synthesis methods, nanostructures, and photocatalytic properties of reported 2D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts are summarized as shown in Table 1. Three main nanostructures of 2D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 8. MXenes and other 2D materials can demonstrate interleaved stacking, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The MXenes are interleaved, stacking with other semiconductors to form multi-layer heterojunctions, also known as heterostructures, conducive to the transfer of electrons between layers of materials to enhance the separation of photoinduced carriers. Besides, MXene nanocrystals can distribute on 2D substrates of other materials or vice versa (as shown in Fig. 8(b) and (c)). 2D/2D In MXene-based photocatalysts, two 2D-layered materials combine to form a surface and interface, possessing many excellent features. (1) The sizeable intimate interface between 2D/2D materials and the matching band of the heterojunction can promote the separation and transportation of photoinduced carriers.43,127 (2) The synergistic action of 2D semiconductors and the 2D co-catalyst can expand the absorption range of light from the ultraviolet light region to the visible light area. (3) The stability of the photocatalyst is improved by reducing photo-corrosion and aggregation.128

In a 2D/2D MXene-based photocatalyst, the type of interface is mainly a Schottky junction, in which the MXene mostly acts as an electron or hole acceptor. MXenes are primarily electron acceptors, and very few are hole receptors. The interface type of a few 2D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts is the type II heterojunction.135 However, there are some special MXene-based photocatalysts with type II heterojunction interfaces, in which the electrons of the MXenes are not excited to transfer to the VB but simply accept electrons. For example, Li et al. showed that a type II heterojunction was formed between the 001 and 101 crystal surfaces of TiO2 to complete the transfer of photoinduced carriers, and then the electrons were received by Ti3C2.138 g-C3N4 is used in most of these photocatalyst materials and MXenes, while the most widely used material, TiO2, is less common. The primary reason is that g-C3N4 is a 2D material and has the advantages of a suitable energy band structure, high chemical stability, low cost, non-toxicity, and a high specific surface area. Although g-C3N4 is an excellent alternative material, exploring other combinations with MXenes is also of great significance. This can be achieved by various synthesis methods, including hydrothermal, electrostatic self-assembly, calcination, and ultrasonic methods. 2D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts have a wide range of applications, covering CO2 photoreduction, photocatalytic HER, photodegradation, and even gas sensors.139
2D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts possessing the structure of interleaved stacking have been studied extensively. Their basic structure is shown in Fig. 8(a) and 9(a–c). The lamellae of the MXenes match the size of other 2D materials, facilitating close contact between the two materials. Therefore, the IEF can be formed to enhance the separation of photoinduced carriers. The vast MXene surface with surface groups is conducive to the adsorption of reactants and the provision of active points.

The situation in which MXene nanocrystals are distributed on 2D substrates of other materials is relatively rare. Schematics of this structure are shown in Fig. 8(c) and 9(d). Because MXenes generally have a multi-layer system, the operation method of dispersing single-layer or few-layer MXenes on other substrate materials is complicated. MXene-based photocatalysts with the opposite structure are more common (shown in Fig. 8(b) and 9(e)). Due to their weak interlaminar van der Waals forces, MXenes are easily interlaminated by other materials. The MXene-based photocatalyst has a multi-layer structure similar to the photocatalyst with interleaved stacking discussed earlier. Their multi-layer structure is conducive to the layer-by-layer transfer of photoinduced electrons to reduce recombination of photoinduced carriers. Meanwhile, the interlayer sheet material has the characteristics of small size and large quantity to provide more active sites. However, these photocatalysts are not easily generated, which means that small-size sheet materials cannot be uniformly intercalated in MXenes.
5.2 0D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts
It can be seen from Table 2 that in the MXene-based photocatalysts with 0D/2D nanostructures, various types of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) are distributed in a few layers or multiple layers of MXenes. Different from 2D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts, TiO2 is the semiconductor photocatalyst used in the majority of 0D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts. This is because MXenes can be used as a precursor of TiO2, where TiO2 NPs are grown in situ. In addition to TiO2, other semiconductor photocatalysts can form NPs distributed on MXenes by in situ growth. The in situ growth method connects MXenes and the primary photocatalyst more closely, which can have better chemical stability. The interface types of 0D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts are mainly Schottky junctions and a few heterojunctions, including Z-scheme heterojunctions. The large surface functional groups of MXenes provide hydrophilicity, making it easier for photocatalysts with nanoparticle nanostructures to combine with the MXenes. Compared with the 2D/2D structure, the distance between the 0D nanoparticles and MXene is shorter, promoting the migration and separation of photoinduced carriers. Meanwhile, the surface functional groups of the MXenes can provide channels for the migration of photoinduced carriers.1 Besides, the terminal Ti exposed on the surface of the MXene can induce a reduction reaction to generate hydrogen-containing groups. The participation of hydrogen-containing groups in the photocatalytic reactions can also increase the adsorption and connection between 2D-MXenes and other photocatalysts.141

This class of MXene-based photocatalysts is the most common because of the simplicity of the synthesis method. As shown in Fig. 10, the photocatalyst is generally based on MXenes as the substrate, and other OD materials are attached. Fig. 11(a and b) shows other 0D materials distributed on the MXene layer, and Fig. 11(c and d) offers two types. The MXene-based photocatalyst shown in Fig. 11(e) is unique because MXenes are 1D. However, overall, the other 0D materials are very small in size and are distributed on the surface of the MXenes. During the whole process, the MXenes play a similar role to 2D MXenes, which can be regarded as an 0D/2D photocatalyst. Besides, MXenes exhibiting nanorod structures have other characteristics. Although 1D MXenes seem to lose a large comparison area, they avoid the uneven intercalation of different materials or surface distribution of multi-layer MXenes; therefore, not too much of the effective active area will be lost.

Defect engineering plays a crucial role in single-atom doping or nanoparticle doping. Some researchers have doped nanoparticles at the defect vacancies of MXenes to form MXene-based photocatalysts with excellent properties. MXenes are easily intercalated by polar groups.150 The 0D photocatalyst can enter the interlayers of MXenes to occupy their active surface sites, forming a close-contact interface to separate the photogenerated carriers in the two materials. The main synthesis methods of 0D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts are hydrothermal and in situ growth. These two approaches are not independent and can be combined to achieve in situ growth by the hydrothermal method. In terms of applications, 0D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts are mainly used in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, while carbon dioxide reduction and hydrogen production are slightly less studied than photodegradation. Although the 0D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts have many advantages, they are relatively inferior to 2D/2D MXene photocatalysts. Because 2D materials have many unique properties, combining 2D/2D materials can surprise researchers. The surface-to-surface contact between materials leads to a more extensive total effective contact area than the combination of 0D/2D. The photocatalytic efficiency of different applications can be compared in the table.
5.3 MXene-based photocatalysts with other nanostructures
In most MXene-based photocatalysts, MXenes mostly appear as two-dimensional lamellar structures. Apart from 2D/2D and 0D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts, semiconductors with other morphologies can be distributed on 2D MXenes, such as 1D NWs, nanofibers (NFs), and nanorods, as well as 3D octahedra, flower-like microspheres, and cubes (as shown in Table 3). A semiconductor photocatalyst with 3D nanostructures will expose different active crystal surfaces, and photoinduced carriers will separate in different directions. Therefore, only part of the area is in contact with the MXenes substrate, which reduces the separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers. The solution to this problem is improving the contact area.153

Moreover, MXenes can also exist in non-2D forms. For example, 0D MXene nanoparticles are developed and distributed on the surface of TiO2 nanowires or 2D photocatalysts. In the case of a small total area, 0D MXene quantum dots (QDs) have a larger proportion of surface functional groups, which will lead to better hydrophilicity and more prosperous active edge sites. This is conducive to combining MXenes QDs and substrate materials, enhancing the separation of photoinduced carriers.165,166 Compared with the photocatalyst composed of 2D multi-layer MXenes, the phenomenon of photoinduced carriers separating through the interlayers will not appear during the photocatalytic process of the non-2D form. In MXene-based photocatalysts produced by non-2D methods, the interface type mainly focuses on Schottky junctions and heterojunctions. In contrast, the other kinds of interfaces have not been well studied.
In ternary MXene-based photocatalysts, the MXenes are mainly used as precursors of various materials, especially TiO2. There is another type of MXene-based catalyst (generalized MXene-based catalysts) in which MXenes as precursors are consumed and converted to other materials, such as the g-C3N4/TiO2/C photocatalyst reported by Yang et al. with the interface type of S-scheme heterojunction,167 an NPT-TiO2/C photocatalyst reported by Kong et al. for water-splitting,168 and the 2D MOF thin films reported by Wu et al. for use in electronic and electrochemical fields.169 Ternary MXene-based photocatalysts are relatively complex; however, they are mostly combined with the morphological characteristics of the previously discussed binary MXene-based photocatalysts. Complex morphologies also bring complex surface and interface types, which are mainly Schottky junctions. MXenes also act as fast electron transfer channels, and in most cases, the two other semiconductor photocatalysts transfer electrons to the MXenes. This process promotes the separation of photoinduced carriers and increases the number of excitons on the photocatalyst surface, which is conducive to forming more active species involved in the photocatalytic process.
There are other types of structures of MXene-based photocatalysts. For example, other materials are embedded in the multi-layer MXenes (shown in Fig. 12). Fig. 12(a and b) shows that photocatalysts with different active crystal faces are embedded in the multi-layer co-catalyst MXenes. Through continuous exploration by researchers, they can find the most active crystal face in the crystal to form an interface structure with the MXenes, thereby promoting the separation of photoinduced carriers most efficiently. Such a configuration can make more use of the layered system of MXenes, which will prevent the nanoparticles from being distributed only on the surface of the multi-layer MXenes. Fig. 12(c and d) shows a ternary MXene-based photocatalyst, which combines embedded and 0D nanoparticle distribution characteristics. Such nanostructures are more conducive to the application of surface and interface engineering, thereby improving photocatalytic performance. Additionally, there are 1D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts (Fig. 13). This type of photocatalyst is common because many materials are easily synthesized in nanofibrous forms.

The nanostructures of MXene-based photocatalysts are varied but regular, and different types have their own advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is necessary to select the appropriate type in combination with the specific application field of the photocatalyst and the materials and morphology characteristics used. The factors which affect the nanostructures directly are the number of active sites of the material and the surface and interface engineering.
6. Conclusions and outlooks
This review summarized the relationship between the surface characteristics and interface mechanisms of MXene-based photocatalysts from the perspective of surface and interface engineering. It then analyzed the influence of these factors on the photocatalytic performance. Combined with the spatial conditions ascribed by the nanostructures of MXene-based photocatalysts, we specifically investigated the reasons for the difference in the photocatalytic performance of surface and interface engineering. The surface functional groups of MXenes can adjust their bandgap and work function, which can affect the power of separation of photoinduced carriers driven by the IEF at the interface of MXene-based photocatalysts. The IEF is the essential characteristic of the surface and interface engineering of MXene-based photocatalysts. Furthermore, on a theoretical basis, the characteristics of interfacial photoinduced carrier transfer of MXene-based photocatalysts with various nanostructures were analyzed. Under the action of large surface groups of MXenes, a close interface contact can be formed due to the characteristics of 2D materials, which is conducive to the separation of photoinduced carriers and the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance.
Through the analysis of the MXene-based photocatalysts, it can be concluded that there are some rules in the influence of nanostructures and interface types on photocatalytic performance. The main directions of the applications of MXene-based photocatalysts are photocatalytic HER, photodegradation of pollutants, CO2 photoreduction, etc. Some MXene-based photocatalysts are used for H2O2 production, overall water splitting, N2 reduction, etc. The nanostructures of MXene-based photocatalysts are diverse, which brings prosperity to their mechanisms and applications. 0D/2D and 2D/2D nanostructures have been studied most. For the 0D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts, the photoinduced carriers are easy to separate because of the short distance between the 0D point and the 2D surface. However, the distribution of the 0D photocatalysts is not easy to control. Suppose the 0D photocatalyst is sparsely distributed on the 2D MXenes layer. In that case, it will cause some waste of active sites on the MXene layer, which is not conducive to the performance of the overall MXene-based photocatalyst. A large-area close contact interface can be formed between 2D and 2D nanosheets, increasing the utilization of active surface sites of MXenes. Therefore, the 0D/2D and 2D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts have their advantages, and their photocatalytic performance is comparable. At present, in addition to these two basic nanostructured MXene-based photocatalysts, there are some multi-element MXene-based photocatalysts with more complex structures. In a multi-element photocatalyst, there are two or more photocatalysts or co-catalysts in addition to MXenes. The multi-element MXene-based photocatalysts, especially ternary MXene-based photocatalysts, mostly integrate the two primary forms of nanostructures of 0D/2D and 2D/2D, exhibiting a more interesting photoinduced carrier transfer mechanism in the interface. Therefore, the multi-element MXene-based photocatalysts possess superior photocatalytic performance. At the same time, the more complex synthesis methods relatively limit the application of multi-element MXene-based photocatalysts.
Defect engineering is closely related to surface and interface engineering of MXene-based photocatalysts. For most nanostructures of MXene-based photocatalysts, the vacancies formed by the surface defects of the materials at the interface can increase the active points, allowing the separated photoinduced carriers to react quickly with the substances in the environment to form the active species in the photocatalytic process. This is beneficial to the improvement of the photocatalytic efficiency. This effect of defect engineering can be better reflected in 2D/2D MXene-based photocatalysts. The contact area between the two 2D materials is relatively large, and various reactions can be entirely carried out at the interface. The 0D/2D MXene-photocatalyst has an additional connection with defect engineering, as the 0D photocatalyst particles can be embedded in the defect vacancy of 2D MXenes directly, which can produce bizarre effects. Although the 0D/2D MXene photocatalyst has a sufficient contact interface, the total effective area is small. Binary MXene-based photocatalysts with other nanostructures have various characteristics. Different synthesis methods result in distinct surface and interface features, which bring their own advantages and disadvantages in promoting the separation of photoinduced carriers. For example, the active crystal surface brings high photocarrier separation efficiency, limiting the interfacial area. Therefore, based on the surface interface engineering of MXene-based photocatalysts, proper nanostructures should be selected according to specific application fields to improve photocatalytic efficiency effectively.
Because they possess metallic properties rather than semiconductor properties, most MXenes act as co-catalysts. However, the bandgap of MXenes can be adjusted through surface engineering, which can endow them with semiconductor characteristics. In addition to surface functional groups, defect engineering can modulate the semiconductor properties of MXenes. Thus, MXenes have potential to be independent photocatalysts. Studies on the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants by pure MXene photocatalysts have been reported. MXenes show excellent photocatalytic performance but low stability. Thus, the research directions of MXenes as independent photocatalysts can start from two aspects: surface feature regulation and defect engineering.
The stability of MXene-based photocatalysts has received extensive attention. Due to the role of surface and interface engineering, the resultant synthesized MXene-based photocatalysts show better photocorrosion resistance. Therefore, the degree of oxidation of MXenes should be of concern in the process of constructing MXene-based photocatalysts. Ti3C2Tx, the most studied MXene, is unstable both in aqueous solution and in air, and the oxidation of the surface terminals of Ti3C2Tx is likely to weaken the photocatalytic performance of the MXene-based photocatalysts.110,172 At present, there have been many studies devoted to improving the stability of MXene-based photocatalysts. The degradation of the performance of MXene-based photocatalysts has been observed through multiple photocatalytic cycling applications to measure the stability and judge the reusability of photocatalysts.72,122,149 In addition to constructing MXene-based photocatalysts, creating the appropriate environment to reduce the oxidation of MXenes at the root is a strategy. For example, Zhang et al. used the method of ultrapure Ar aeration to remove oxygen in the solution to relieve the oxidation of Ti3C2Tx particles.173
The critical research direction to promote the development of photocatalysis is the study of mechanisms. The current interface theory can explain some experimental phenomena well; however, many concepts have not been formed into a well-established system and cannot be explored and confirmed. At present, most researchers focus on improving properties by exploring new materials or synthetic methods to obtain high-performance materials. They then devise a theory to explain the phenomenon. However, if there is no strong theoretical system to support it, there will be no clear direction for exploring performance improvement. Therefore, the research on the mechanism of photocatalytic performance enhancement should be enhanced.
There are millions of members of the MXene family, theoretically. More than 30 MXenes have been prepared,14,174 but their specific characteristics have not been explored thoroughly. According to the contents of the table, Ti3C2 is the predominant MXene in MXene-based photocatalysts. The properties of other kinds of MXenes that have been prepared have not been studied intensely. Many properties can only be obtained through simulation calculations and cannot be verified by experiments. Hence, studies on the properties of synthesized MXenes should be intensified, and the predicted MXenes should also be synthesized continuously.
The study of a theoretical system can further establish a precise mechanism of action of MXene-based photocatalysts from the point of view of surface engineering to improve their performance and accelerate the discovery of new members of the MXene family, which can help to screen out better MXene materials. Computational material design has developed rapidly, which has brought a new direction for the analysis and calculation of the MXene mechanism. Studies have shown that computational materials design can bring a 3–7 times return based on time savings.175 An essential factor in the development of this field is the implementation of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI).176,177 At present, more than 30 kinds of MXenes have been synthesized experimentally, and more members of the MXene family have been proved by calculation and prediction. The application of computational material design can first identify MXenes with excellent performance potential and then search for synthesized objects in a narrower range, thus reducing the trial and error cost of traditional experimental synthesis methods, which will significantly promote the development of MXenes and MXene-based photocatalysts.178
With the progress of theoretical calculation and equipment conditions, experimental data have exploded in recent years. Big data technology has been gradually introduced into the field of materials to process complex data information. Gabriel R. Schleder et al. reviewed the methods of modern computational materials science and guided the design of new materials with enhanced properties.179 Density functional theory (DFT), high-throughput (HT), and machine learning (ML) are introduced in detail, and the relationship between these three methods is discussed. DFT is widely used to generate data. HT can automate any experimental and computational method (including DFT) to generate large amounts of data. ML is used to extract patterns from existing large amounts of data.180,181 ML actually grew out of the field of artificial intelligence as a combination of statistics, computer science and technology, and neuroscience.179 The most common computational analysis method in materials science is the generation of data with DFT and then use HT and ML methods.
DFT is a mature theory. When the crystal or molecular structure of a material is known, DFT is an excellent way to study the material. Its original source is Hohenberg and Kohn's paper published in 1964, which proposed the DFT as we know it now.182 Later, DFT evolved to allow for more realistic system calculations, such as surfaces, defects, and total energy.183–185 In addition, the effective masses of band gaps, photoelectric transitions, and electron holes can be calculated using the DFT.179 More recently, DFT has been used to build sizeable 2D material databases.179 DFT is widely used in various fields, such as catalysis,186 electrons,187 and optics.188 In the field of MXenes, DFT is gradually being used.189–192
The critical role of ML application in the material area is to shorten the time needed to discover new compounds with the support of large amounts of data, thus speeding up the transition of new materials from laboratory to the commercial application market. With the discovery of any new material with superior performance, scientists hope that it will move out of the laboratory and into industrial production. The scientific community has high hopes for 2D materials with superior performance and a wide range of applications. However, very few 2D materials are used formally for commercial purposes, with the most critical limitations being that they are too expensive or difficult to mass-produce. In the 2D material family, MXenes have promising industrial application potential not only due to their excellent mechanical strength,193 thermal stability,194 and machinability,195,196 but more because they can be mass-produced while retaining the ideal material properties.197 In addition, as a material rather than a chemical, the forms of Mxenes, which include films, powders, fibers, and colloidal solutions,13,198,199 will significantly determine their performance and application fields.200
