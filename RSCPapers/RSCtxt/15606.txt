    , Accepted 16th November 2011First published on 22nd December 2011AbstractHierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire (HNW) arrays consisting of long single crystalline nanowire trunks and short single crystalline nanorod branches have been synthesized on Ti-foil substrate via a two-step hydrothermal growth process. The formation of the HNW arrays based on anatase TiO2 nanowire (NW) arrays can be ascribed to the crystallographic relationship between trunk and branch. The power conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on such a HNW photoelectrode (4.51%) shows a significant enhancement compared to TiO2 nanowire (NW) array photoelectrode (3.12%) with similar thickness (∼15 μm in nanowire length), which can be attributed to more dye loading, superior light scattering ability and comparable electron transport rate for the former. Furthermore, flexible DSSC using TiO2 HNW arrays on Ti substrate as working electrode and transparent PEDOT/ITO-PET prepared via in situelectrodeposition as counter electrode shows a comparable photovoltaic performance to the rigid Pt/FTO-glass cell. A power conversion efficiency as high as 4.32% (Jsc = 7.91 mA cm−2, Voc = 796 mV, FF = 0.69) is obtained for the first time for fully flexible DSSC based on hierarchical TiO2 nanowire arrays and Pt-free counter electrode.

Broader context
Owing to its unique opto-electronic properties, TiO2 with various morphologies from 0D nanoparticles, 1D nanostructures to 3D spheres have been intensively investigated as photoanode materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Our work here focuses on novel TiO2 photoanode materials possessing larger surface area, superior light scattering ability and faster electron transport to improve the performance of DSSCs. Hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire (HNW) arrays consisting of long nanowire trunks and short nanorod branches are prepared via a two-step hydrothermal process, and demonstrate the highest conversion efficiency (4.51%) so far for dye-sensitized TiO2 nanowire arrays/Ti photoelectrode. Flexible DSSCs based on transparent PEDOT/ITO-PET counter electrode show a comparable photovoltaic performance (4.32%) to the rigid Pt/FTO-glass cell.

Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as one of the promising alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells have attracted intensive attention for their low cost and excellent photoelectrical conversion efficiency.1–3 Up to now, the highest power conversion efficiency of DSSC that has been achieved is more than 12%,4 but the overall performances are still lower than the predicted values (31%) due to poor utilization of near infrared light and recombination losses in the random network of TiO2 nanocrystallines.5–7 Furthermore, the lattice mismatches at the grain boundaries of nanoparticle photoelectrode could influence the electron transport and act as electron traps, which could result in slow electron mobility in the conduction band of the semiconductor.8,9 To overcome the slow electron transport of nanocrystalline-based photoelectrode, extensive researches have focused on one-dimensional (1D) or quasi-1D nanostructures.10–13 These 1D nanostructured photoelectrodes provide direct pathways for photogenerated electrons and enhance electron transport rate due to the smaller amounts of grain boundaries, which can significantly improve the charge collection efficiency.14 However, the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs based on 1D nanostructured photoelectrodes are still not satisfactory due to the smaller surface area ascribed to the large diameter of nanowire (or nanorod) and considerable free spaces between 1D nanostructures, which together leads to a lower dye loading and poor light scattering property. Our recent report on hierarchical TiO2 microsphere photoelectrodes consisting of both nanoparticle and 1D nanorod showed a significant photovoltaic performance (10.34%) because of its excellent electron transport, large surface area, and superior light scattering property.15 Recently, rutile single-crystalline 1D TiO2 nanorod arrays on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass has been reported for DSSC application and showed a power conversion efficiency of 3–4%.16,17 Hierarchical rutile TiO2 1D nanostructure arrays on FTO glass substrate consisting of rutileTiO2 nanowires and rutile nanorods have also been prepared viatitanium(IV) tert-isopropoxide or TiCl4 treatment of the as-prepared rutile single crystalline TiO2 nanowire arrays, and showed power conversion efficiencies of 1.30% and 3.75%, respectively.18,19 However, all these nanowire or hierarchical nanowire arrays were grown on rigid FTO glass substrate which limited the application in flexible electronic device. Furthermore, it is well known that rutile TiO2 exhibits an inferior photovoltaic performance because of smaller dye loading and slower electron transport rate compared to anatase TiO2 nanostructures.20 Hence, it will be very desirable to synthesize hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays for the enhancement of photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.
Flexible DSSCs have been attracting significant interest because of its lightweight, low cost roll-to-roll production and potential applications in powering mobile electronic products.21–23 Typically, a thin and lightweight polymer substrate, such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate) coated with indium-doped tin oxide (ITO), or metal substrate, such as Ti-foil substrate, is used as the flexible substrate instead of the rigid FTO glass. However, the plastic substrate suffered from a lower sintering temperature which was critical for nanoparticle based photoanode to enhance the connection among the particles on the substrate. Hence, the photovoltaic performance of flexible DSSCs is still hampered by slow electron transport in nanoparticle films and a large resistance of the ITO coated polymer current collector.24 Instead, a metal substrate can meet the requirements of sintering temperature. Recently, DSSCs based on anatase single-crystalline TiO2 nanorod arrays on flexible Ti-foil substrate and rigid Pt/FTO counter electrode showed low efficiency of less than 2%.25,26 On the other hand, although the Pt counter electrode exhibits high electrocatalytic activity towards the iodide/triiodide redox couple, it constitutes the most expensive component in DSSCs. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to exploit alternative counter electrode materials to reduce the cost of flexible DSSCs. Recently, PEDOT based counter electrodes have been actively exploited as Pt-free counter electrodes because of its low cost, high transparency in visible light region, high conductivity and remarkable stability at room temperature.27–29
In this study, a new type of hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays has been successfully prepared via a two-step hydrothermal procedure. Fully flexible DSSCs based on the HNW photoelectrode and electrodeposited PEDOT/ITO-PET counter electrode shows an efficient photovoltaic performance of 4.32%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest for hierarchical TiO2 nanowire array photoelectrodes based flexible DSSC.
Experimental
Preparation of hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays
A piece of titanium foil (2.5 × 3.0 cm2) ultrasonically cleaned in water, acetone and ethanol for 15 min, respectively, was placed against the wall of a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave filled with 30 mL 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. Then, the sealed autoclave was put in an electric oven at 220 °C for 24 h. After the first-step hydrothermal reaction, titanium foil covered with nanowire array was immersed in 1 M HCl solution for 10 min to replace Na+ with H+, rendering H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowire array on Ti foil. Then, the Ti foil was removed from HCl solution and rinsed with water, ethanol and dried in ambient condition. The TiO2 nanowire array was obtained after heat treatment of the H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowire arrays in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 3 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1. Finally, the hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire array consisting of long TiO2 nanowire trunks and short TiO2 nanorod branches was formed through the second-step hydrothermal reaction. To be specific, the above TiO2 nanowire array on Ti foil was further put into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave filled with 40 mL of a solution containing 0.05 M K2TiO·C4O8, 20 mL H2O and 20 mL diethylene glycol (DEG), and kept at 150 °C for 6 h.
Preparation of TiO2 working electrode
The as-prepared TiO2 nanowire arrays and hierarchical TiO2 nanowire arrays were soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C. After sintering at 520 °C for 30 min, the TiO2 photoelectrode films were immersed in 0.5 mM N719 dye (Ru[LL′-(NCS)2], L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate, Solaronix Co.) in acetonitrile/tert-butanol (volume ratio 1:1), and sensitized for about 16 h at room temperature. Afterwards, these films were rinsed with acetonitrile in order to remove physisorbed N719 dye molecules.

Dye-sensitized solar cell assembly
To evaluate their photovoltaic performance, the dye-sensitized TiO2 NW or HNW/Ti films were sandwiched together with Pt coated FTO glass which was used as counter electrode. Platinized counter electrodes were fabricated by thermal deposition of H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in isopropanol) onto FTO glass at 400 °C for 15 min. For flexible dye-sensitized solar cells, electrodeposited PEDOT on ITO-PET was used as counter electrode to replace the Pt/FTO glass. The PEDOT/ITO-PET films were synthesized by electrodeposition of 0.1 M EDOT monomer in acetonitrile solution, where ITO-PET served as working electrode, a Pt net as counter electrode, and using a supporting electrolyte (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide, 0.1 M).30 A I−/I3− based liquid electrolyte, which contained 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tertbutylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15) was injected into the space between the sandwiched cells.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F), transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL-2010 HR), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) are used to examine the phase purity, crystalline structure and morphologies of the samples. The current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192). A 1000 W Xenon arc lamp (Oriel, Model: 6271) served as a light source and its incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with an optical filter to approximate AM 1.5 G one sun light intensity before each measurement. The IPCE spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 400 to 800 nm on the basis of a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. In order to measure the adsorbed dye amount of the TiO2 film, the dye was desorbed into 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution, and the absorption spectra of desorbed-dye solution and reflectance of films were measured using a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3150).
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer at a bias potential of −800 mV in the dark with a frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 1 MHz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. The impedance parameters were determined by fitting of the impedance spectra using Z-view software. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were carried out on the electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under a modulated green light emitting diodes (457 nm) driven by a source supply (Zahner, PP211), which can provide both dc and ac components of the illumination. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 1 KHz to 0.1 Hz. The active area of TiO2 film was measured by using a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1).
Results and discussion
The hierarchical TiO2 nanowire arrays on Ti-foil substrate were synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal growth process: Firstly, H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowire arrays are prepared on Ti foil through an alkali hydrothermal process combined with an ion-exchange process. Afterwards, TiO2 nanowire arrays (NW) can be obtained via heat treatment of the as-prepared H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowire arrays. Secondly, the second-step hydrothermal reaction of the TiO2 nanowire arrays/Ti is performed in the solution containing K2TiO·C4O8, diethylene glycol (DEG) and H2O, which results in hierarchical TiO2 nanowire arrays (HNW) consisting of TiO2 nanowire trunks and nanorod branches. The crystal structures of the synthesized materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 1. After the ion-exchange process (in 1 M HCl) of the sample prepared via the first step of alkali hydrothermal growth, single crystalline H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowires are obtained, as shown in Fig. 1a. Compared to the JCPDS (No. 47-0124) card, the (020) diffraction peak is significantly enhanced, which indicates that the growth of H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowire is along the [010] direction. After calcination at 500 °C for 3 h, the H2Ti2O4(OH)2 is completely converted to anatase TiO2 through a topotactic transformation (Fig. 1b). The sample prepared after the second-step hydrothermal reaction of the TiO2 nanowire can be still indexed as the anatase TiO2 phase (Fig. 1c) according to the PDF card (JCPDS No. 65-2900, a = 3.785, b = 3.785, c = 9.514).

        Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a and b show the longitudinal SEM image of H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowire arrays. The mean diameter and length of H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowires determined from SEM are 85 ± 5 nm (enlarged SEM image, Fig. 2a) and 15 ± 1 μm (Fig. 2b), respectively. After heat treatment of the as-prepared H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowires at 500 °C for 3 h, the morphology and length of nanowire arrays (Fig. 2d) remain unchanged despite the crystal structure transformation from body-centered orthorhombic for H2Ti2O4(OH)2 (Fig. 1a) to body-centered tetragonal for anatase TiO2 (Fig. 1b).26 In addition, the diameter of TiO2 nanowires undergoes a slight reduction to 70 ± 5 nm (Fig. 2c) because of the dehydration of H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowires during the annealing step. Further (or the second-step) hydrothermal reaction of the calcined TiO2 nanowires/Ti foil in the solution containing K2TiO·C4O8, DEG and H2O leads to the formation of hierarchical TiO2 nanowire arrays consisting of long nanowire trunks (15 ± 1 μm in length, 70 ± 5 nm in diameter) and short nanorod branches (30 ± 10 nm in length, 8 ± 3 nm in diameter), as depicted in Fig. 2e and f.

Further morphological and structural characterizations of the TiO2 NW and HNW arrays are performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3a is a typical TEM image of a TiO2 nanowire with 72 nm in diameter which agrees with the SEM observation. HRTEM (Fig. 3b) together with SAED (inset in Fig. 3a) further show that the TiO2 nanowire is single crystalline across its entire length and grows along the [100] direction. The interplanar space of d101 = 0.36 nm is in excellent agreement with the d-spacing of the anatase (101) planes. Furthermore, from a statistically significant number of measurements, an average angle of 71.4° was found between the (101) planes and the axis of nanowires, which is in agreement with the results of Aydil and co-workers.25,26 After a second-step hydrothermal reaction of the TiO2 NW array, typical TEM images of the TiO2 HNWs are shown in Fig. 3c and d, which clearly show a number of short TiO2 nanorods (5–12 nm in diameter, 20–40 nm in length) covering the long nanowire side surface. Moreover, the short TiO2 nanorod forms an angle of around 90 degrees with the long growth axis of TiO2 nanowires. Fig. 3d displays a HRTEM image taken from the interfacial region of the nanowire trunk and nanorod branch denoted in Fig. 3c. It reveals that the growth direction of the TiO2 nanorod branch is along [101] and the TiO2 nanowire trunk still maintains the single-crystalline structure after branch growth. In addition, the well-developed {101} twinned structure at the boundary of the TiO2 nanowire trunk and nanorod branch (Fig. 3d) may suggest that the twinned boundaries are developed during the second-step hydrothermal growth of the sprouts on the sides of TiO2 NWs. Then, the TiO2 perpendicular nanorod branches are subsequently epitaxially grown from the sprouts to construct the hierarchical TiO2 NWs featuring the aforementioned crystallographic relationship.18

Insets in (a) and (c) are the SAED of TiO2 nanowire and hierarchical TiO2 nanowire, respectively. 
In order to investigate the formation process of the TiO2 HNW arrays during the present two-step hydrothermal reaction, a detailed time-dependent morphology and schematic diagram evolution studies were performed as shown in Fig. 4. H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowires (Fig. 1a,b) were firstly obtained through the first-step hydrothermal reaction of Ti foil in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution and an ion-exchange process, and then transformed into smooth anatase TiO2 nanowires (Fig. 1c,d) via heat treatment. When the calcined TiO2 nanowire/Ti foil was put in the solution containing K2TiO·C4O8, DEG and H2O for the second-step hydrothermal reaction at 150 °C, sparse TiO2 nanoparticles were formed on the surfaces of the TiO2 nanowires (Fig. 4a, 1 h). These TiO2 nanoparticles would serve as crystal seeds to guide the growth of subsequent spiny TiO2 branches. With increasing the reaction time to 2 h, a thin layer of slim TiO2 nanorods formed surrounding the primal TiO2 nanowires (Fig. 4b). The length and diameter of TiO2 nanorod branches further increased with prolonging the hydrothermal reaction time (4 h), as shown in Fig. 4c. Clearly, both the length and the diameter of short TiO2 nanorod branches could be controlled by simply tuning the reaction time. According to the detailed SEM observations of the time-dependent samples, the schematic diagram of the formation process of hierarchical TiO2 nanowire arrays is shown in Fig. 4 (left) based on top view.

The TiO2 NW and HNW arrays were further used as photoanode materials to fabricate rigid or flexible DSSCs. The preparation of TiO2 HNW array-based rigid, as well as flexible, DSSCs are shown in Scheme 1. (I) H2Ti2O4(OH)2 nanowire arrays were firstly fabricated through the first-step hydrothermal reaction (a) and ion-exchange process (b); (II) anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays were obtained via a heat treatment at 500 °C for 3 h; (III) TiO2 nanowire array film was transferred to an autoclave for the second-step hydrothermal reaction to prepare hierarchical TiO2 nanowire arrays; (IV) the as-prepared hierarchical TiO2 nanowire array films were used as photoanodes for rigid or flexible DSSC applications. Fig. 5 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of three DSSCs with the corresponding photoanode and counter electrode of A: TiO2 NW, Pt/FTO-glass; B: TiO2 HNW, Pt/FTO-glass; C: TiO2 HNW, PEDOT/ITO-PET, respectively, and the photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs are summarized in Table 1. It reveals that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is greatly enhanced from 5.29 mA cm−2 for TiO2 NW cell (A) to 8.03 mA cm−2 for TiO2 HNW cell (B), which can probably be attributed to the larger surface area for the latter to adsorb more dyes because of the additional TiO2 nanorod branches. The adsorbed dye amount on the TiO2 HNW (117.9 nmol cm−2) is significantly larger than that of TiO2 NW (59.6 nmol cm−2) according to the UV-vis absorption measurement, which can reasonably explain the higher photocurrent density for the former. The open circuit voltage (Voc) is 816 mV and 793 mV for NW (A) and HNW (B) based cells, respectively, which could be the result of different recombination resistances and electron lifetimes (see below EIS and IMVS measurement). Hence, the overall power conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on TiO2 HNW (B: 4.51%) shows a 45% enhancement compared to that of TiO2 NW photoelectrode (A: 3.12%).

The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra as a function of wavelength for those three cells are displayed in Fig. 6a. Compared to cellA (TiO2 NW), the IPCE of cellB (TiO2 HNW) increased from 28% to 55% at around 520 nm. The higher IPCE of cellB over a wide range (450–800 nm) was ascribed to the increase in light harvesting efficiency (larger amount of dye loading and superior light scattering), resulting in a higher short-circuit current density. It is well known that the Jsc is strongly related to the dye loading on the TiO2 photoelectrode. As shown in Table 1, a larger amount of dye molecules for HNW photoelectrode (cellB) compared to that of NW photoelectrode (cellA) will lead to more photogenerated electrons and higher photocurrents for the former. In addition, it is worth noting that the IPCE spectrum of cellB (HNW) shows an obvious red shift to a longer wavelength (600–750 nm) compared to cellA (NW) due to better light-scattering ability for the former. To investigate the light scattering ability of the two materials, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of TiO2 NW and HNW arrays films with a similar thickness of around 15 μm without dye adsorption were measured. As shown in Fig. 6b, the reflectance of TiO2 HNW array films is about 40% in the range of 400–800 nm, which is much higher than that of the TiO2 NW array film. Hence, such hierarchical TiO2 nanowire array photoanode materials would maximize the use of solar light, which could enhance the light harvesting efficiency and Jsc.

J–V data shows that the TiO2 HNW based cell (B) exhibits a higher Jsc but lower Voc value compared to TiO2 NW cells (A). In general, the Voc value is quite sensitive to the recombination resistance and electron lifetime in the conduction band of TiO2.31,32 To further shed light on the difference in Voc, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of these DSSCs based on different photoanodes were measured in the dark under a forward bias of −0.8 V.33,34 As shown in Fig. 7, two semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots. The smaller and larger semicircles in the Nyquist plots are attributed to the charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface and the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively. The sheet resistance (Rs) of substrate, charge transfer resistance of the counter electrode (R1) and recombination resistance (R2) were analyzed by Z-view software using an equivalent circuit containing a constant phase element (CPE) and resistances (R) (Fig. 7, inset). As shown in Fig. 7 and depicted in Table 1, the cells based on TiO2 NW (A) and HNW (B) arrays possess similar Rs and R1 of 9.6 ± 0.2 and 3.5 ± 0.1 Ω, respectively, due to the use of the same counter electrode (Pt/FTO glass) and electrolyte. However, the recombination resistance (R2) of cellA (54.2 Ω) is larger than that of cellB (33.9 Ω) implying a slower electron recombination process for the former, which is in agreement with the higher open-circuit voltage for the DSSC based on TiO2 NW photoelectrode (cellA).

Intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) have proven to be powerful techniques for investigating the electron transport and charge recombination in nanostructured films and were further used to examine the electron lifetime and transport time of DSSCs based on TiO2 NW and HNW array photoelectrodes.35,36Fig. 8 show the time constants of electron transport (IMPS) and electron recombination (IMVS) as a function of light intensity, showing that all time constants decrease with increasing light intensity. Due to higher surface area of TiO2 HNW anode, which is responsible for more abundant electron back reaction with I3− in the electrolyte, the electron lifetime (obtained from IMVS measurement) of cellB is shorter than that of cellA, coupled by a decreased open circuit voltage for the former. On the other hand, the transport time (obtained from IMPS measurement) of a TiO2 HNW based cell (B) is larger than that of a TiO2 NW based cell (A) which could be attributed to the presence of numerous boundaries between the TiO2 nanowire trunk and TiO2 nanorod branches according to the HRTEM results. Another possible explanation for the slow electron transport rate in TiO2 HNW based DSSC may be the increased traps for the hierarchical structures that allow for multiple trapping/detrapping events, which prolong the electron transport time. The IMPS and IMVS studies reveal a slower electron transport and faster electron recombination for cellB compared to cellA. Hence, the higher short-circuit current density and conversion efficiency for the former could be attributed to the larger surface area for adsorbing more dyes and higher light scattering ability for enhancing the utilization of solar light, which were confirmed by the aforementioned dye adsorption and UV–vis diffuse reflectance measurements.

Recently, flexible DSSCs have attracted immense attention since its wide applications in mobile electronic devices. Here, the hierarchical TiO2 nanowire arrays/Ti is used as photoelectrode and an electrodeposited PEDOT on ITO-PET substrate is used as counter electrode to assemble a fully flexible DSSC (cellC). The J–V curve and photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc, η and FF) of such a flexible DSSC device (cellC) are shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 1, respectively. A power conversion efficiency of 4.32% has been obtained for fully flexible DSSC (cellC) accompanied by a Jsc of 7.91 mA cm−2, Voc of 796 mV and FF of 0.69, which displays only a slight decrease of Jsc, FF and η compared to the rigid solar cell using Pt/FTO glass counter electrode (cellB). It is worth noting that such an efficiency (4.32%) is the highest one reported up to now for flexible DSSCs based on TiO2 NW photoelectrode and Pt-free counter electrode. The IPCE (Fig. 6a) of TiO2 HNW-PEDOT/ITO-PET cell (C) shows a somewhat lower value than that of HNW-Pt/FTO-glass cell (B), which is consistent with lower Jsc as observed in the J–V measurements.
The photovoltaic performances of DSSCs based on Pt/FTO-glass and PEDOT/ITO-PET counter electrode were further analyzed by EIS investigations which were carried on in the dark at an applied potential bias of −0.8 V. The sheet resistance (Rs: 18.2 ohm) of flexible DSSC based on PEDOT/ITO-PET counter electrode is two-fold larger than that of a rigid DSSC (Rs: 9.5 ohm) based on Pt/FTO-glass. Furthermore, the interface resistances of counter electrode/electrolyte (R1) are 8.6 ohm and 3.4 ohm for cellC and cellB, respectively. Therefore, the lower FF of flexible DSSC based on PEDOT/ITO-PET substrate could be ascribed to the higher Rs and R1 values corresponding to the poor electric conductivity of PEDOT catalyst at the PEDOT/ITO-PET counter electrode.
Conlusions
In summary, a simple two-step hydrothermal process was demonstrated to prepare hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays consisting of long TiO2 nanowire trunks and short TiO2 nanorod branches. To our knowledge, it is the first report of the fabrication of such hierarchical TiO2 nanowire arrays on Ti foil and its application in DSSCs. The investigations of IMPS, IMVS and EIS reveal that the electron lifetime and transport time for TiO2 HNW cell are inferior to those of TiO2 NW cell due to the additional boundaries between the TiO2 nanowires and TiO2 nanorod branches for the former. However, the photocurrent and photovoltaic performance of the DSSC based on TiO2 HNW increase 52% (from 5.29 to 8.03 mAcm−2) and 45% (from 3.12 to 4.51%), respectively, which can be attributed to a larger surface area to adsorb more dye molecules and superior light scattering property of the TiO2 HNW photoelectrode.
Furthermore, fully flexible DSSCs based on highly ordered hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays/Ti foil as photoanode, electrodeposited PEDOT on transparent ITO-PET as counter electrode, N719 as light absorber and I−/I3− as redox couple shows an efficient photovoltaic performance of 4.32% accompanied by a Jsc of 7.91 mA cm−2, Voc of 796 mV and FF of 0.69. This is the highest power conversion efficiency for flexible DSSC based on TiO2 nanowire array photoelectrode and Pt-free counter electrode. The present hydrothermal method opens an elegant path to fabricating novel hierarchical nanowire arrays for highly efficient flexible DSSCs, which exhibit potential applications in various mobile electronic devices.

Broader context
Owing to its unique opto-electronic properties, TiO2 with various morphologies from 0D nanoparticles, 1D nanostructures to 3D spheres have been intensively investigated as photoanode materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Our work here focuses on novel TiO2 photoanode materials possessing larger surface area, superior light scattering ability and faster electron transport to improve the performance of DSSCs. Hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire (HNW) arrays consisting of long nanowire trunks and short nanorod branches are prepared via a two-step hydrothermal process, and demonstrate the highest conversion efficiency (4.51%) so far for dye-sensitized TiO2 nanowire arrays/Ti photoelectrode. Flexible DSSCs based on transparent PEDOT/ITO-PET counter electrode show a comparable photovoltaic performance (4.32%) to the rigid Pt/FTO-glass cell.
