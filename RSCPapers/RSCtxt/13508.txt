    , Accepted 22nd February 2017First published on 22nd February 2017AbstractCerium dioxide, CeO2−δ, remains one of the most attractive materials under consideration for solar-driven thermochemical production of chemical fuels. Understanding the rate-limiting factors in fuel production is essential for maximizing the efficacy of the thermochemical process. The rate of response is measured here via electrical conductance relaxation methods using porous ceria structures with architectural features typical of those employed in solar reactors. A transition from behavior controlled by material surface reaction kinetics to that controlled by sweep-gas supply rates is observed on increasing temperature, increasing volume specific surface area, and decreasing normalized gas flow rate. The transition behavior is relevant not only for optimal reactor operation and architectural design of the material, but also for accurate measurement of material properties.
1. Introduction
The redox behavior of non-stoichiometric oxides is central to a vast range of energy and environmental technologies, from fuel cells,1–4 permeation membranes and batteries,5–8 to photoelectrochemical cells and catalytic converters.9,10 Nonstoichiometric oxides have received particular attention in the context of solar-driven thermochemical production of fuels.11–13 This technology relies on the capacity of such oxides to accommodate large swings in oxygen content in response to changes in temperature and/or changes in gas-phase oxygen chemical potential. In many of these applications, rapid response is essential to achieving high efficiency. Consequently, the oxides are often structured as mesoporous or microporous forms having relatively short bulk diffusion lengths, high specific surface area on which reactions can occur, and accessible porosity for facile transport of reactant and product gases.14–16 For thermochemical fuel production, large porosity is further desirable for promoting radiative heat transfer.17–20
Clear identification of the rate-limiting step in a process involving reaction on a porous oxide of random morphology presents serious challenges. Two key material properties in this context are the bulk diffusion coefficient and the surface reaction constant,21,22 knowledge of which informs the design of optimal architecture. Electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) methods have been widely employed to measure these properties,23–26 but the analytical solutions required for treating the relaxation profiles are generally available only for samples with simple geometries. In an ECR experiment, the material is subjected to a step change in gas-phase oxygen partial pressure (pO2) and the rate at which the oxygen nonstoichiometry (δ) in the oxide changes is tracked by a measurement of the conductivity. It has recently been recognized that even where the sample geometry has been appropriately controlled, gas-flow dynamics can play a critical role in the observed relaxation behavior.27 Specifically, instead of being limited by bulk diffusion or surface reaction, the response can be limited by the rate at which the reactant gas is supplied to the material, a phenomena which becomes dominant when the gas flow rate is low relative to the quantity of reactive oxide.28 Significantly, such gas-limited response has also been observed during thermochemical fuel production, with high-temperature hydrogen production rates from porous ceria (resulting from the reaction of reduced ceria with steam) being proportional to the flow rate of the reactant gas. At lower temperatures, surface reaction kinetics were found to overtake gas-flow limitations as the overall rate-limiting factor.29 These observations suggest a significant interplay between morphology, gas flow rate, and inherent material properties in establishing the rate at which porous oxides interact with a flow of reactant gases.
In our previous study,28 the transition behavior from the gas-phase limited to the material-kinetic limited regime was shown as only a function of pO2 at a fixed temperature (1400 °C) for dense ceria with well-defined geometry. Here, with the aim of deconvoluting the various factors specified above, we investigate the effects of morphology, temperature and gas flow rate on the global redox kinetics of porous ceria. A theoretical framework for predicting the temperature, morphology and flow-rate dependence of the conductance relaxation behavior is presented, which is then compared to the experimental results. The experimental work is performed using several types of structures, including reticulated porous ceria which has attracted attention for its potential to support high solar-to-fuel conversion efficiencies in solar-driven thermochemical fuel production.17,20,30
2. Theory: electrical conductance relaxation of porous oxides
We treat the case in which a porous, non-stoichiometric oxide is subjected to a small step change in pO2 at a fixed temperature. The perturbation serves as a chemical driving force to change the oxygen content in the material, and thereby its electrical conductivity. In the ideal scenario, the oxygen concentration in the gas phase, including the regions within the pores of the sample, is spatially uniform. In the limit of a low flow rate of reactant gas supplied to the oxide, the solid changes oxidation state as quickly as the gas can provide reducing (or oxidizing) power. The solid is thus in quasi-equilibrium with the gas phase and operates within what has been termed the thermo-kinetic limit.31,32 At high gas flow rate, the material response can no longer keep pace with the rate at which the reactant species are supplied, and the change in oxidation state is limited by material kinetic factors: surface reaction rate and/or bulk solid-state diffusion. The material in this case operates in the material-kinetic limited regime. We consider these extreme regimes below, recognizing that material behavior in the real experiment may be dictated by a combination of rate-limiting factors, depending on gas flow rate (relative to the quantity of oxide), surface reaction constant, bulk diffusivity, and material microstructure.
2.1. Regimes of limiting behavior
In the thermo-kinetic limit, the surface reaction rate and bulk diffusivity are so fast as to have no impact on the overall reaction rate between oxide and gas. Relaxation behavior for the specific situation in which the step change in pO2 is small, the oxygen concentration in the solid is constant with respect to position (spatially homogeneous), and the total system pressure is 1 atm, all of which apply to the experimental situation considered here, has been treated elsewhere.28 Building on a comprehensive model for the behavior of a porous material operating in the thermo-kinetic limit,31 it was shown that the normalized oxygen content, , where co(t) is the time dependent oxygen concentration, t is time, and co,i and co,f are the initial and final oxygen concentrations, respectively, is expected to follow a simple exponential form. For a material in which the conductivity is proportional to the oxygen concentration (as would be expected under a sufficiently small perturbation in pO2) the normalized conductance will follow the same form, given as:28 (1)where G is the conductance, Gi and Gf are the initial and final conductance values, respectively, t is time, and τ is the relaxation time constant, defined according to (2)where Ptot is the total pressure, F is the molar flow rate of gas, nMOx is the number of moles of oxide, pO2(δ,T) is the oxygen partial pressure of a gas in equilibrium with the oxide at a nonstoichiometry δ at temperature T, and δf is the final equilibrium nonstoichiometry of the oxide. The term pO2(δ,T) is a material specific quantity, which expresses the gas-phase oxygen partial pressure at which the material displays an equilibrium oxygen nonstoichiometry of δ. It is to be emphasized that the relaxation time of eqn (2) is entirely unrelated to a conventional reactor flush time, a time constant which reflects the characteristics of the experimental configuration, but bears no relationship with the thermodynamic properties of the materials under study. Moreover, while theoretically expected, the thermo-kinetic characteristic time has not been experimentally observed in a relaxation experiment.28
From the form of eqn (2), it is immediately evident that increasing the normalized gas flow-rate (flow rate per unit oxide) monotonically decreases the relaxation time. However, this relationship cannot hold indefinitely. At extremely large normalized flow rates, material kinetic factors, the surface reaction step and/or bulk diffusion, ultimately become important. Of these, the relaxation behavior in the surface reaction limited regime of a material with a simple geometric shape is well known. The relaxation will follow an exponential profile, similar in form to eqn (1), with a characteristic time that depends on sample dimensions. It can be shown that a porous material behaves similarly, where the relevant dimension is the volume specific surface area (SSA) or A/V (ESI†), where A is the total surface area of the porous material and V is its volume (excluding pores). Specifically, the characteristic time is defined by (3)In this limit, material thermodynamics, gas flow rate, and sample mass no longer play a role. However, as has been noted previously, the relaxation profiles in the thermo-kinetic and surface-reaction limited regimes are identical in functional form.28
If the bulk diffusion lengths of the oxide are long relative to the characteristic length defined by DChem/kChem, where DChem is the chemical diffusion coefficient, then diffusion will play a role in determining the overall relaxation profile. In such case, the oxygen concentration in the solid will depend on position as well as time. Accordingly, the solution to the concentration profile will depend sensitively on the architecture of the porous material. Although a general solution cannot be written, in principle, a finite element treatment that accounts for Fickian diffusion in the bulk along with a reaction flux across the oxide-gas interface could be used to describe the relaxation behavior of a material with arbitrary pore architecture. In light of known solutions for simple geometries,33 such treatment would be unlikely to produce an exponential function of the form of eqn (1).
The overall phase space for the various regimes considered is presented in Fig. 1, along with the functional form of the relaxation profile for each regime. Because relaxation influenced by bulk-diffusion limitations cannot generally be described by a simple exponential profile, evidence of diffusion effects can be detected simply from profile analysis. However, extraction of the diffusion coefficient would be extremely challenging. This challenge is conveniently circumvented when evaluating typical porous ceria structures for thermochemical fuel production. All studies to date indicate that material kinetic limitations arise from low surface reaction rates, with no influence of bulk diffusivity.34 Accordingly, we focus hereafter on thermo-kinetic and surface reaction limited behaviors.
 Fig. 1  Phase space of parameters establishing the rate limiting step(s) in the reaction of an oxide with a flowing reactant gas, and regimes of limiting behavior. With increasing normalized gas flow rate material kinetic factors become dominant over thermodynamic factors. Within the material kinetic regime, increasing diffusion length causes diffusion to become dominant over surface reaction. 
2.2. Influence of flow rate, morphology and temperature on relaxation behavior
In the thermo-kinetic regime the inverse of the characteristic relaxation time is linearly proportional to the normalized gas flow rate. The slope relating the two is readily computed from knowledge of the material thermodynamic properties. Specifically, from eqn (2), one obtains (4)
At the temperatures and oxygen partial pressures of interest here this slope decreases with temperature. This result can be understood by recognizing that, although the slope of log δ vs. logpO2 (atm) is approximately constant (between ∼1/5 and ∼1/6)35,36 under the conditions of interest, the absolute value of δ increases. The relaxation time thus depends on the normalized flow rate as shown schematically in Fig. 2(a). For reference, the value of  at a pO2 of 8.2 × 10−4 atm (as used in this work) is presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
 Fig. 2  Schematic behavior of the relaxation time constant (τ): (a–c) τ as a function of normalized flow rate (, where the normalization is with respect to quantity of oxide, either mass or moles) at various temperatures for oxides of low and high specific surface area, in which the redox reaction is in the regime of (a) the gas-phase limit, (b) the surface reaction limit, and (c) a combination of the gas-phase and the surface reaction limits. (d) log(1/τ) as a function of temperature. The black dotted and solid lines in (d) correspond to τ for the more high and low specific surface area oxides, respectively, at the fixed flow rate marked in (c). Blue and Red thick curves are guides to the eye. 
In the surface reaction limited regime, one can anticipate the behavior of 1/τ vs. normalized flow rate at different temperatures for two materials with differing specific surface areas to appear as shown in Fig. 2(b). The relaxation time constant in both cases is independent of flow rate and decreasing with increasing temperature. However, that of the oxide with smaller specific surface area (SSA) is larger than that of the other. Here it is assumed that the surface reaction constant increases monotonically with temperature, as is typical.37,38
The experimentally observed relaxation time constant will always correspond to the larger of the two values of τ implied by the thermo-kinetic and surface reaction limited regimes (i.e., the slower process will be rate-limiting). Thus, the overall 1/τ will be given as Fig. 2(c), with a transition from gas-limited to material-kinetic-limited behavior with increasing flow rate. The schematic further reveals that the transition point between the two regimes shifts to higher flow rate with increasing temperature or increasing specific surface area (with all else held equal).
The interplay of temperature, gas flow rate and surface area are more clearly revealed in an Arrhenius representation. To that end, from expressions (2) and (3) one obtains, respectively, the logarithmic relations (5)and (6)Here it is recognized that, in addition to its temperature dependence, kChem typically depends also on oxygen stoichiometry (generally manifest as a dependence on pO2); for consistency with the behavior of the gas-limited regime, we define kChem relative to the δ at the conclusion of the relaxation experiment. The second terms in the right-hand side of eqn (5) and (6) are independent of temperature (as well as being independent of oxygen partial pressure). They serve only to uniformly translate the value of log(1/τ) along the y-axis in the Arrhenius representation, raising its value with increasing normalized flow rate or volume-specific surface area, Fig. 2(d). Because the relaxation will be limited by the slower process, a transition from a material-kinetic-limited to a gas-limited regime will occur on heating, with the cross-over temperature being dependent on the normalized gas flow rate and the specific surface area of the oxide. Consider specifically the case in which conductance relaxation is measured as a function of temperature at the same fixed, large value of normalized gas flow rate for two materials with differing specific surface areas as indicated by the vertical lines in Fig. 2(c). The behavior of the low SSA oxide will follow the solid black line in Fig. 2(d), transitioning to gas-limited behavior at relatively high temperature. In contrast, the high SSA oxide will follow the dotted black line, with the transition occurring at a lower temperature. Significantly, in the gas-limited regime, the observed relaxation rate will be independent of the oxide morphology. Overall, it is evident that one must take care to understand the regime under which the measurement is performed if one is to meaningfully extract material properties.
3. Sample preparation
Ceria of four different morphologies was prepared for conductance relaxation measurements: (i) a dense polycrystalline compact; (ii) a highly porous, low SSA structure with unimodal pore distribution; (iii) a highly porous structure, high SSA oxide with bimodal pore distribution;18 (iv) and a ‘less porous’ monolith of large volume. The majority of the relaxation studies were performed with the two highly porous structures. For the polycrystalline compact, ceria powder (Aldrich, 211575, 99.9% purity) was compressed under uniaxial pressure at 100 MPa, followed by cold isostatic pressing at 250 MPa. The green body was then sintered under stagnant air at 1500 °C for 10 h. The relative density of the resulting material was >96% of the theoretical value. The sample was cut and polished into the shape of a parallelepiped 0.79 mm × 4.71 mm × 16.30 mm in linear dimensions and 0.3930 g in mass.
The highly porous samples were reticulated porous ceramic (RPC) structures. The RPC fabrication process permits facile dimensional control at the macroscopic lengthscale.39,40 As is typical for RPC fabrication, a polyurethane sponge template with large scale pores, ∼3 mm, (Fig. 3a) was coated with a ceramic slurry (Fig. 3b). Upon removal of the polymer at high temperature, a macroporous monolith consisting of a network of struts with open porosity was obtained (Fig. 3c). The starting powder for RPC preparation here was a mixture of coarse (Alfa Aesar, 11328, 5 micron powder, 99.9%) and fine (STREM chemicals, 58-1400, <7 nm, >99.7%) ceria combined in a 7:3 ratio. The powders were mixed with water in a 6:4 powder:water weight ratio, to which Darvan® 821A (Vanderbilt Minerals, 14442, 5 wt% relative to ceria) was added as a dispersant, and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC, Tokyo Chemical Industry, C0603, 0.25 wt% relative to ceria) was added as a thickening agent. To create the RPC with bimodal pore structure, hereafter RPC-50, 50 vol% carbon pore-former (STREM chemicals, 93-0601, 325 mesh, vol% relative to ceria) was added to the slurry.18 The RPC with unimodal pore structure, preparation of which did not include this additional pore former, is hereafter referred to as RPC-00.

The slurries were ball-milled for 24 h using YSZ (yttria-stabilized ZrO2) grinding media. After this homogenization, commercial 10 PPI (pores per inch) Polyurethane (PU) sponges (Foam-Partner, Fritz Nauer AG) of cylindrical shape were immersed in the slurry and then dried at 70 °C for 1.5 h. After 4 repetitions of this coating step, the samples were fired under stagnant air to gently remove the polyurethane matrix and carbon pore-former. The heat treatment protocol was selected on the basis of the thermal decomposition behavior of the organic components as guided by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fig. S2 (ESI†). Specifically, the materials were heated stepwise under stagnant air to 500 °C for RPC-00, and to 900 °C for RPC-50, at a rate of 1 °C min−1 with intermediate 30 min holds at 300, 325, and 500 °C. The temperature was then raised up to 1500 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 and held for 5 h. The image in Fig. 3(c) is that of a typical RPC-00 structure.
The ‘less porous’ monolith, hereafter PM, was prepared from coarse ceria powder (Alfa Aesar, 11328). This was combined with starch (Alfa Aesar, A11961, 37.5 wt% relative to ceria) then ball-milled (YSZ milling media) for 24 h in anhydrous ethanol. After drying at 40 °C, graphite powder (Alfa Aesar, 14735, 98 wt% relative to ceria) was added to this mixture. The composite powder was uniaxially pressed at 40 MPa and subsequently sintered using the same heat-treatment protocol as employed for RPC-50 (stepwise heating to gently oxidize and remove organics, final hold at 1500 °C). The dimensions, mass, and implied porosity of the resulting structures are listed in Table 1.

Scanning electron microscopy images (Hitachi S4800-II cFEG SEM), Fig. 4, reveal the three porous materials to display very different pore architectures. While the two RPCs have similar macroscopic porosities (∼86%), RPC-50 has a visibly larger volume-specific surface area (A/V) and a higher concentration of open pores within the struts. The PM has a relatively random distribution of pore sizes, with both open and closed pores evident, and porosity of 61.5%. The ranking of the volume-specific surface area of this material relative to the two RPCs is not immediately apparent from the images. Attempts to determine A/V by gas absorption (BET) methods were unsuccessful due to the relatively low mass-specific surface areas. Mercury intrusion porosimetry and X-ray tomography measurements, Table S1 (ESI†), confirmed the substantially higher A/V of RPC-50 relative to the RPC-00. However, the results are not entirely quantitative because of assumptions about pore structure required in order to convert mercury intrusion behavior to accessible surface area, and because of the extensive image processing required to estimate specific surface area from tomographic results.

4. Relaxation behavior: methods, results, and discussion
4.1. Methods
DC conductance relaxation profiles were measured in a small volume reactor (∼23 cm3) used in previous such studies.26,28 The dense rectangular sample was evaluated using a true four-probe configuration, whereas the porous materials were measured in quasi-four-probe arrangements, Fig. S4 (ESI†). Pairs of contacts were applied to the distant ends of the dense sample by tightly wrapping Pt wires around notches made at the far ends of the sample, Fig. S4a (ESI†). For the two RPCs, struts at either end were wrapped with Pt wire (Fig. S4b, ESI†), and Pt paste (Platinum ink A3788A, BASF Catalysts) was then applied to the contact points. In the case of the PM, two small holes (∼1 mm in diameter) were drilled through the sample at opposing sides close to the circumference. As with the RPCs, Pt wires were passed through these holes, firmly secured, and then contacted to the oxide using Pt paste, Fig. S4(c) (ESI†). For all experiments, the pO2 was measured in situ using a zirconia based oxygen sensor (SIRO2 C700+, Ceramic Oxide Fabricators, Australia) placed approximately 2 cm downstream of the sample.
The conventional dense sample was utilized to measure kChem as a function of temperature over the range 800 to 1400 °C under high gas flow conditions at which gas-limitations are overcome,28 using specifically, a flow rate of 300 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), equating to 763 sccm g−1 or 1.31 × 105 sccm mol−1. The conductance profiles were recorded upon abruptly changing the oxygen partial pressure from 1.5 × 10−3 to 7.9 × 10−4 atm, achieved using digitally controlled mass flow controllers that provided predetermined mixtures of Ar and O2. We define the oxygen partial pressure in the final state as that of the measurement, consistent with the expression in eqn (2). The response of the two RPCs was measured using the same step change in pO2 and same range of temperatures (800, 1000, 1200, 1300, and 1400 °C), but with the flow rate varied from 150 to 500 sccm, implying mass and mole normalized flow rates of ∼600 to ∼2100 sccm g−1 or ∼1.0 × 105 to ∼3.6 × 105 sccm mol−1, respectively. The PM sample was evaluated to provide additional flow rate dependent data at 1400 °C. The step change in pO2 was 1.6 × 10−3 → 8.2 × 10−4 atm, and the flow rate was varied from 50 to 400 sccm. Because a larger oxide sample was employed, this provided access to smaller values of oxide mass normalized flow rates (107 to 857 sccm g−1), without having to decrease the flow rate to levels that jeopardize pO2 control.28
4.2. Results and discussion
All the normalized relaxation profiles measured in this work were described well by a simple exponential decay function, as given generically in eqn (1), indicating the absence of bulk diffusion effects on the kinetic response. For the dense sample, measured as a function of temperature, Fig. S5 (ESI†), the fits yielded reduced R2 values >0.993 and percent error of 0.8%. The surface reaction constant obtained from this analysis, taking τ = a/kChem, where 2a is the thickness of the sample in the thinnest direction, is shown in Fig. 5. The value measured at 1400 °C is consistent with our earlier study, performed using a dense compact at this single temperature.28 The surface reaction constant generally increases with temperature, with a change in slope on the Arrhenius plot at ∼1180 °C. Further discussion of the behavior of kChem and comparison to the sparse literature available on the surface properties of ceria at this high temperature is presented in the ESI† (Fig. S6). Of relevance here is that the trend with temperature aligns with the discussion of the expected impact of changing parameters on the measured relaxation time.

The normalized conductance relaxation profiles for RPC-00 and RPC-50 are presented in Fig. 6 for selected temperatures and for the highest and lowest gas flow rates examined. The reduced R2 values for fits of the entire range of RPC profiles against eqn (1) were >0.992 and percent error of was <1.9%. At 800 and 1000 °C, the relaxation characteristics of both RPC-00 and RPC-50 are insensitive to flow rate, indicating that at these temperatures, the process is in the surface reaction limited regime for all flow rates of 200 sccm and higher (∼850 sccm g−1). At 1200 °C, only RPC-00 continues to display a flow rate independent response, whereas at 1400 °C the profiles of both the RPC-00 and RPC-50 are flow rate dependent, with higher flow resulting in faster relaxation, indicative of entry into the thermo-kinetic regime.

Solid lines are the best fit exponential decay function (eqn (1)). 
The relaxation times measured over the broad range of temperatures and flow rates examined are summarized in Fig. 7. The trends generally follow the predicted behavior (Fig. 2c). The 1/τ values measured from RPC-00 are largely independent of flow rate for temperatures up to 1300 °C, whereas they increase monotonically with flow rate at 1400 °C. In the case of RPC-50, a flow-rate independent 1/τ is similarly evident at lower temperature. At 1200 °C, 1/τ is initially linearly dependent on flow rate, then sharply transitions to a region where it is flow-rate independent. At the higher temperatures, the relaxation behavior is always dependent on the gas supply for the flow rates probed, similar to RPC-00. The data for a selected high and selected low flow rate are recast in Arrhenius format in Fig. 8. The results again follow the predicted behavior (Fig. 2(d)). At low temperatures, at which the response is governed by the surface reaction rate, the sample with higher surface area has a relaxation time constant 5–6 times greater than that with low surface area, and the response times for both samples decrease with temperature. At high temperature, in the gas-phase limit, the relaxation time constants of the two types of samples approach one another, and the response times increase with temperature. Thus, if one inadvertently assigned the response to the surface reaction behavior, one would obtain, in this high temperature, low gas flow-rate regime, a peculiar material which displays a surface reaction constant that decreases with temperature.

Dotted lines show the average value in the material-kinetic regime.

Beyond their temperature dependence, the absolute values of the relaxation time constants in the gas-phase limited regime merit discussion. In principle, in this regime the two types of materials should relax at precisely the same rate, and the time constant can be precisely predicted from the thermodynamic properties of the oxide according to eqn (2). Examination of Fig. 7 and 8 and reveals, however, that the two materials do not relax at the same rates as each other in the high temperature and low gas-flow rate regime, and nor does either match the thermodynamic prediction. For example, at 1400 °C and a mass-normalized flow rate of 640 sccm g−1, the relaxation time constants for the RPC-00 and RPC-50 samples are ∼70 and ∼46 s, respectively, as compared to the expected value of 21.6 s. A potential reason for this discrepancy lies in the details of the sample arrangement in the reaction chamber. Eqn (1) and (2) are valid when the gas surrounding the sample is uniform in composition, effectively attaining the exit gas composition instantaneously on entry into the reaction chamber. However, the cross-sectional areas of the RPC samples used for this study, with radii of ∼0.26 cm, were substantially smaller than the cross-sectional area of the reaction chamber, with radius 0.5 cm, suggesting that some gas may flow past the sample at a distance far enough away that the gas is not ‘felt’ by the oxide. Furthermore, the large pores in the RPCs may result in gas-phase composition gradients even within the macroscopic volume of the sample.
Recognition of the possible impact of unfavorable gas flow dynamics on the measurement of the relaxation time in the gas-limited regime motivated examination of the PM sample, which has a larger cross-sectional area (∼80% that of the chamber vs. ∼25%), smaller pores, and lower porosity than the RPC samples, Table 1. Similar to the other samples, fits to the PM relaxation profiles according to eqn (1) yielded R2 values >0.996 and percent error <1.4% (Fig. S7, ESI†). The time constants obtained at 1400 °C from the two RPCs and the PM are compared in Fig. 9 to that of the theoretically predicted value. Faster relaxation time for the PM sample over the RPCs is clearly evident, as is a sharper transition between gas-flow and surface reaction limited regimes. Nevertheless, even the PM does not relax as quickly as expected in the thermokinetic regime, suggesting limitations due to gas flow dynamics have not been fully resolved. The faster response time of the RPC-50 sample over the RPC-00 sample within the gas-limited regime may be due to the fact that the large-scale pores in RPC-00 are larger than those in RPC-50 (the former has thinner, denser struts). Large pores may generate substantial gas-phase compositional non-uniformity within the volume of the RPC-00 structure. Further discussion is provided in the ESI† (Fig. S8 and S9). Overall, the response rates of these porous materials point to the value of engineering pore structure and morphology and macroscopic material dimensions to manipulate gas flow dynamics. However, within the thermo-kinetic regime increasing specific surface area cannot directly influence the response rate by simply providing a greater number of reaction sites.
 Fig. 9  Relaxation time constant as a function of flow rate at 1400 °C for the three different types of porous ceria structures of this study, compared to the theoretical value expected under gas-limited kinetics. The latter is computed according to eqn (4) using the thermodynamic data of Panlener et al.36 Solid lines are guides to the eye. 
Returning to the behavior in the material-kinetic regime, here the relaxation times obtained from the dense and porous structures are expected to be related according to (7)where subscripts d and p signify dense and porous, respectively. The measured relaxation times for the RPC-00 structure in the material-kinetic region, Fig. 7a, are 2 to 4 times smaller than those of the dense sample (as measured to generate Fig. 5), suggesting a volume specific surface area of 5 to 10 mm−1. The analogous amplification for the RPC-50 is 12 to 32 times, suggestive of a volume specific surface area of 30 to 80 mm−1. These values would equate to the close-packing of particles with diameters of 300–600 μm in the case of RPC-00 and 40–100 μm in the case of RPC-50, generally consistent with the large feature sizes of Fig. 3 and 4. The specific surface areas implied by the relaxation experiments are, however, substantially lower than those obtained from preliminary X-ray tomography analyses (Fig. S3, ESI†), which yielded 25 and 370 mm−1, respectively, for the RPC-00 and RPC-50 structures. Whereas the tomography result refers to the total surface area, including that from internal pores, catalytic enhancement is possible only from open pores, explaining at least some of the differences in surface areas measured by these two methods. Indeed, a much greater fraction of the pores of RPC-50 are closed compared to those of RPC-00, such that the factor of 15 difference between the two RPCs in tomography-inferred specific surface area is not fully replicated in the kinetic response. Analytical methods for treating tomography data obtained from RPCs with dual-scale porosity, which go beyond the scope of the present work, are described in depth by Ackermann et al.41
5. Summary and conclusions
The results presented here demonstrate several important features of the kinetic response of ceria, a representative nonstoichiometric oxide, to small, stepped perturbation in oxygen partial pressure. First, when the bulk diffusion lengths are small enough that transport through the oxide bulk can be treated as infinitely fast, the conductance relaxation profile will follow an exponential decay curve. This will be true whether the process is limited by surface reaction kinetics or is limited by the supply of sweep gas. Second, the process will be gas-phase limited under conditions of low normalized gas flow rate, high temperature, or high specific surface area of the oxide. Under such conditions, the relaxation time is dependent only on the thermodynamic properties of the oxide and the normalized gas flow rate, with no influence of pore architecture, so long as the pathway of the gas ensures its full interaction with the solid phase. Conversely, the process will be material-kinetic (specifically surface-reaction) limited under conditions of high normalized gas flow rate, low temperature, or low specific surface area. Under these conditions, the relaxation time is dependent only on the surface reaction constant kChem, and the accessible volume-specific surface area, A/V. Third, the interplay between these process parameters implies that the transition between material-kinetic and gas-phase limitations will shift to higher temperatures as specific surface area is decreased or normalized gas flow rate is increased.
These results have implications for both fundamental characterization of materials and for design of reactive components for solar-driven thermochemical cycling. For materials characterization, it becomes evident that it is imperative to assess the measurement regime if one is to properly interpret the relaxation time. Typically, one aims to employ a relaxation method for the determination of surface reaction constants. At high temperature, at which both the oxygen non-stoichiometry and the surface reaction constant can be large, the thermo-kinetic response can easily overwhelm the surface reaction response. Peculiar behavior of kChem, with an apparently decreasing value with increasing temperature, is a feature of measurements in the gas-phase limited regime. The remedy to this situation is simply to increase the gas flow rate until one observes a constant relaxation time. For thermochemical fuel production, typical porous structures have short bulk diffusion lengths such that diffusion limitations do not appear. Furthermore, gas flow rates are low so as to minimize the energy penalty of heating large volumes of gas. At the high temperatures of oxide reduction, this low flow rate can place the material response within the gas-phase limited regime. A deviation between the relaxation expected on the basis of material thermodynamic properties and the observed relaxation behavior can thus be used as a diagnostic for evaluating the accessibility of the solid to the sweep gas.
