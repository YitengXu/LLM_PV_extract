    , Accepted 10th January 2023First published on 10th February 2023AbstractThe rational design and development of highly efficient and stable photocatalysts is a major focus in the field of photocatalysis. The transformation of solar energy into chemical energy is considered a powerful technique for implementing a clean, effective, and affordable energy source. The main challenges associated with this process are stability, low light absorption and fast recombination of charge carriers. Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) coupled with plasmonic materials has recently been reported as an auspicious technique to promote enhanced photocatalytic activity by transferring plasmonic energy to GCN. In this context, this review article provides a critical comprehensive overview of the development of plasmon mediated GCN based photocatalysts and summarizes the recent progress in the field of energy conversion, environmental remediation and organic transformations. Finally, the summary and future perspectives conclude the review.
1. Introduction and scope
The exploration of clean energy solutions is very necessary for tackling environmental issues arising from fossil fuel consumption and hence for sustainable development.1,2 The increasing energy demand and abrupt environmental changes have posed a threat to survival on earth for the upcoming century and it is highly desirable to develop alternative for clean energy resources and pollution-free technologies for the environment of carbon neutrality.3–6 In this regard, solar energy is recognized as an abundant, clean and renewable source of energy, which can meet the requirements for the development of pollution-free technologies.7,8 For the efficient utilization of solar energy, the use of semiconductor photocatalysis has emerged as an effective and fast developing process, which allows the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy which provides an alternative path for resolving the energy and environmental crisis. Herein, we mainly aimed for the environmental applications of photocatalysis, which cover the degradation of organic pollutants in water and air purification by the elimination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In addition, solar energy can also be utilized for organic transformation reactions to synthesize important organic molecules.9 The main advantage of using semiconductor photocatalysts is their heterogeneous nature that allows the efficient recycling of the photocatalysts and their multiple use without compromising with their catalytic activity.10,11 Thus, the development of efficient photocatalytic materials is of great importance and could turn out to be “Holy Grail” in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis.
For a long time, TiO2 has been studied as a dominating semiconductor for various photocatalytic applications such as environmental remediation, hydrogen generation, organic transformations and many more.12–18 However, the drawback of low absorption of light photons (absorbs only under ultraviolet light) and fast recombination of charge carriers (electrons and holes) has limited its use for large scale applications. To address these challenges, many research efforts have been made to develop alternative photocatalytic materials with efficient light absorption and with enhanced charge carrier separation capability. However, there is a need to find a material with appropriate band edge positions and high stability during photocatalytic reactions. Over the past few years, graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has grown as a promising visible light active photocatalytic material for various large-scale applications. GCN is a two-dimensional (2D) π-conjugated polymer made up of earth-abundant elements (carbon and nitrogen), with a moderate band gap (approx. 2.7 eV), which shows effective absorption of visible light. Carbon nitride is one of the forms of an oldest material (melon) reported long back in 1834; however, research on it remained inactive for about 150 years.19 For the first time Cohen and Liu reported the synthesis of ultra-hard material β-C3N4 by replacing Si with C in β-Si3N4.20 Further advancements were made by Niu and coworkers, to synthesize the mixture of amorphous and crystalline β-C3N4 by using the pulse laser ablation method.21 The obtained material showed superb hardness and excellent thermal stability. Furthermore, various allotropes of the carbon nitride family, such as α-C3N4, β-C3N4, cubic C3N4, g-C3N4 (or GCN), etc., were also reported by the researchers. Among them, GCN was found to be the most stable allotrope of the carbon nitride family under ambient conditions.22
To date, GCN has been widely explored for various applications such as photocatalysis, sensing, supercapacitors, adsorption, etc.1,23–26 GCN possesses high stability in acidic or basic media and is insoluble in various common solvents such as water, ethanol, diethyl ether, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, etc.27 The high chemical stability of GCN originates from the van der Waals forces between the stacked graphitic layers. Thermally, GCN is stable up to 600 °C and shows almost complete decomposition of the s-triazine network up to 700 °C.28 In addition, GCN is non-toxic, low cost and can be easily synthesized from various easily available precursors29,30 and is well known to exhibit excellent electronic and optical properties.31 Despite these tremendous merits, the use of GCN for practical applications is unconvincing due to the pronounced fast recombination of charge carriers, small surface area and low electric conductivity.32,33 The faster recombination of charge carriers is responsible for the poor redox reactions over its surface, which results in lower photocatalytic efficiency. Also, the moderate band gap (∼2.7 eV) of GCN is still considerably large for harvesting visible light efficiently and thus leaves a large portion of visible light unexploited. To address these issues, different strategies including doping, defect engineering, noble metal loading, coupling with appropriate semiconductors and conducting materials, etc. have been employed by the researchers.1,34 Among them, the modification of GCN with plasmonic materials is an attractive and facile approach to enhance its photocatalytic performance and to reduce many issues such as low stability, poor recyclability and low light absorption. Plasmonic materials coupled with semiconductors help in absorbing light photons due to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and plasmonic heating effect.17 Also the formation of the Schottky junction results in the effective separation of the charge carriers that results in enhanced photocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic performance. Parida et al. provided mechanistic insight into the visible light driven hydrogen generation using plasmon mediated GCN based photocatalysts.35,36 Recently, our group has investigated the plasmonic behaviors of Au nanostars decorated onto two dimensional carbonaceous GCN nanosheets for the elimination of pollutants and organic transformation reactions.37
In this review article, the recent developments in plasmon mediated GCN based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts for energy generation, environmental remediation and organic transformations have been discussed comprehensively. Initially, the basic principle of photocatalysis has been discussed along with the mechanism of plasmon mediated photocatalysis, followed by the different strategies for the synthesis of GCN based plasmonic photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts. Subsequently, a detailed literature survey on the use of plasmon mediated GCN based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts in hydrogen generation, organic pollutant degradation, VOC elimination and organic transformation reactions has been presented (Fig. 1). Finally, the summary and future perspectives have been discussed to provide a clear view of the advancements in the field of GCN based plasmonic photocatalysts for various futuristic applications.

2. Basic principles of photocatalysis
Photocatalysis is a light-driven process in which a semiconducting material absorbs energy equal to or greater than that of its bandgap (Eg) which results in the excitation of electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). Due to photoexcitation, electrons are excited to the CB (reducing) and positive holes are created in the VB (oxidizing). The optical nature and the color of the photocatalyst depend upon the energy gap between the VB and CB of the photocatalyst. The photocatalysts with a moderate band gap (1.5 eV to 3.0 eV) absorb in the visible region and show a wide range of colors (VIBGYOR). The band gap of well-known semiconductors is summarized in Table 1.

After the formation of electron–hole pairs, several processes take place. One of the possible processes is the recombination of photo-generated charge carriers, which occurs within nanoseconds releasing the absorbed energy as heat or light radiation. Due to the recombination of majority of the photo-generated charge carriers, very few can reach the surface of the catalyst resulting in poor catalytic efficiency. Secondly, the trapping of excited electrons in the defect/surface sites has a slightly lower energy than that of the CB of semiconductors. The separated charge carriers which reach the catalyst surface are available for the redox reactions wherein they react with the adsorbed electron acceptors or donors. A simple schematic diagram showing the generation of electron–hole pairs in a semiconducting material is presented in Fig. 2a. The CB electrons are captured by molecular oxygen to form active species, superoxide radicals (O2−˙), while the VB holes react with water molecules or hydroxyl anions (OH−) to generate an extremely powerful and non-selective oxidizing agent, hydroxyl radicals (OH˙). Thus, the formed active species (O2−˙ and OH˙ radicals) take part in the photocatalytic redox reactions to give the desired products.

Schematic representation of the functional mechanisms of plasmons in chemical reactions under light irradiation, (b) surface plasmon resonance effect, (c) plasmonic enhancement of light absorption, (d) plasmonic sensitization and (e) photoelectrocatalytic generation of electron–hole pairs. 
The various reactions responsible for the generation of above-mentioned active species are depicted in eqn (1)–(7), as follows: PC + h+ → PC (h+VB) + P (e−CB)(1) PC (h+VB) + H2O → OH˙ + H+(2) P (e−CB) + O2 → O2−˙(3) OH˙ + OH˙ → H2O2(4) H2O2 + h+→ 2OH˙(5) H2O2 + O2−˙ → OH˙ + O2 + OH−(6) PC (e−CB) + H2O2 → OH˙ + OH−(7)However, when plasmonic metal nanoparticles (NPs) are decorated over semiconducting materials, two active functional mechanisms take place leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity as depicted in Fig. 2. Firstly, the plasmonic metal NPs can enhance the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor under visible light irradiation due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect (Fig. 2c). Secondly, the electrons in the hybrid nanostructure consisting of metal NPs and semiconducting material are excited with simultaneous plasmonic resonance energy (only with specific absorption for plasmonic metal) and the separation of charge carriers takes place in the semiconductor as shown in Fig. 2d. Photoelectrocatalysis is another coveted application of photocatalytic systems that extends into the energy sector (Fig. 2e). While photoelectrocatalysis is deemed as one of the most promising technologies to be utilized in solar energy utilization, it suffers from several drawbacks: unavailability of suitable photocatalysts that (1) are capable of absorbing the light photons across the UV-visible region; (2) can enable a facile separation of electron–hole pairs and their transfer to the water/photocatalyst interface; and (3) have an engineered surface electronic structure to make half-reactions thermodynamically feasible. Many scientists working in the field of photoelectrocatalysis have the conviction that the breakthrough has to come from the materials side to achieve the commercial potential of the process. In this regard, a wide variety of semiconductor photocatalysts have been developed and evaluated for the photoelectrocatalysis process.41–45
3. Synthesis strategies for plasmon mediated GCN
Various synthetic methods have been developed for the synthesis of plasmon mediated GCN. The different strategies adopted for the synthesis of plasmon mediated GCN can directly influence light absorption, electron transfer, charge recombination rate and the amount of surface-active sites.46–48 The introduction of different elements onto the GCN network via doping can effectively tune the band gap of the photocatalysts which can facilitate enhanced light absorption. The combination of GCN with other nanomaterials for the synthesis of nanocomposites results in the formation of heterojunctions which can help in fast electron transfer leading to slower charge recombination rate. The amount of surface active sites in plasmon mediated GCN can be enhanced by generating defects in the GCN motif which in turn enhances photocatalytic activity. In this section different methods for the synthesis of plasmon mediated GCN such as thermal condensation, hydrothermal/solvothermal and sonochemical methods have been discussed in detail.
3.1 Thermal condensation method
For the synthesis of GCN, thermal condensation of nitrogen-rich precursors is the most attractive and widely explored method. Nitrogen-rich precursors such as urea,49,50 cyanamide,51 dicyanamide,52–55 melamine, thiourea,56etc. are non-toxic, low cost and easily available. The synthesis of GCN from nitrogen-rich cyanamide involves condensation to dicyanamide and then melamine.57Fig. 3 depicts the process of synthesis of GCN from nitrogen-rich precursors such as cyanamide. During the thermal condensation process, the nitrogen-rich precursors undergo a loss of ammonia molecules to form melam. This melam upon further loss of an ammonia molecule undergoes polymeric condensation to form polymeric melon. The melon units undergo extensive polymerization to form the tris-triazine GCN network.

There are several reports available on the synthesis of plasmonic NP decorated GCN through thermal condensation of available precursors followed by photodeposition of plasmonic NPs.58–61 In one such report Wei et al.62 synthesized Ag decorated GCN nanosheets via thermal condensation of urea. A weighed amount of urea was taken in an alumina crucible and heated at 550 °C with a heating rate of 2.5 °C min−1 in a muffle furnace for 4 h. After 4 h, the crucible was allowed to cool and the obtained GCN powder was crushed to a fine powder for further use. Ag NPs were decorated over GCN sheets via an in situ photodeposition method. In this process, 100 mg of GCN powder was dispersed in 30 mL mixture of methanol and deionized water by sonication and a calculated amount of AgNO3 solution was added to the dispersion with vigorous stirring under dark conditions for 30 min. Nitrogen was purged into the reaction mixture for 30 min to eliminate atmospheric oxygen. The suspension was illuminated with a 300 W mercury lamp for 3 h to obtain a dark yellow suspension. The suspension was then centrifuged and washed several times with distilled water. The obtained Ag-GCN photocatalyst was dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. Similarly, Faisal et al.63 synthesized Au-GCN via a facile thermal condensation method. In brief, 10 g of urea was heated at 550 °C for 3 h. The obtained yellow GCN powder was crushed to a fine powder for further use. For the decoration of Au NPs, 500 mg of GCN was first of all ultrasonicated for 1 h in 50 mL of distilled water and a calculated amount of HAuCl4 solution was added to prepare 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0% Au-doped GCN nanocomposites. The as-synthesized nanocomposites were centrifuged and washed with ethanol and water several times. The samples were dried overnight at 65 °C for further use.
Surface defects can also be introduced in the tris-triazine network of GCN through the thermal condensation process. Ag decorated phosphorus doped GCN (P-GCN) was synthesized via a thermal condensation method and the subsequent photoreduction process.64 In brief, a 1:1 mass ratio of urea and melamine was crushed to a fine powder and was calcinated at 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 4 h. The resultant mixture was then mixed with 0.15 g of diammonium phosphate and was again calcinated at 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 4 h to obtain P-GCN nanosheets. The Ag NPs were then decorated onto the obtained P-GCN catalyst via the photoreduction process. 500 mg of P-GCN was dispersed in deionized water via sonication for 30 min. A specific amount of AgNO3 was added to the dispersion and then the suspension was irradiated by using a 500 W xenon lamp for 2 h with continuous stirring. The obtained mixture was then centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol several times to obtain the Ag/P-GCN catalyst. The samples were further vacuum dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The narrow band gap of Ag/P-GCN led to enhanced visible light absorption, hence improved the photocatalytic activity. Raizada et al.65 also synthesized phosphorus doped GCN (PCN) via a thermal polycondensation method. They mixed a calculated amount of dicyandiamide and diammonium hydrogen phosphate in 20 mL of ethanol through magnetic stirring and sonication for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then dried at 80 °C. The dried product was then crushed to a fine powder and calcinated at 550 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 20 °C min−1 and a yellow PCN powder was obtained. The as-synthesized PCN and V2O5 were sonicated in distilled water for 20 min and then AgNO3 was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 30 min. To this reaction mixture, KBr solution was added slowly and the resultant mixture was sonicated for 15 min and stirred for 30 min. The resultant mixture was irradiated using a UV lamp for the reduction of Ag+ to Ag0. The obtained Ag/AgBr/V2O5/PCN nanocomposite was precipitated out and dried at 80 °C for further use as shown in Fig. 4a.

Kim and coworkers67 synthesized Ag decorated S-doped GCN via a thermal condensation method. For the synthesis of S-doped GCN, thiourea (10 g) was dissolved in water and was lyophilized via freeze-drying. The frozen solid was then calcinated at 550 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. After calcination, the obtained S-GCN was further washed with water and dried at 60 °C. Ag NPs were decorated over the S-GCN surface via a chemical reduction method using NaBH4. First of all, S-GCN was dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol via sonication and then 1 mL of AgNO3 (37 mM) was added to the dispersion with vigorous stirring. Then, 0.2 mL of NaBH4 (1.5 M) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 30 min to reduce Ag+ to Ag0. The gray-colored Ag/S-GCN powder was obtained through centrifugation and washed with water. The final product was dried using a freeze dryer. In another report, Cong et al.68 synthesized GCN with structural oxygen and cyano defects (COCN) via a thermal condensation method. COCN was prepared by mixing 10 g of urea with 10 mg of ascorbic acid and calcinating the mixture at 520 °C for 4 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. In COCN the edge nitrogen atoms of GCN are replaced by highly electronegative oxygen atoms and cyano groups are incorporated into the GCN skeletal. Furthermore, Ag NPs were in situ grown over COCN nanosheets. 100 mg of COCN was dispersed in deionized water via sonication. To this dispersion, AgNO3 and a calculated amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were added with continuous stirring for 20 min. Afterwards 0.8 mM sodium borohydride was injected and the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred. The resultant mixture was then filtered and washed with ethanol and deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
3.2 Hydrothermal/solvothermal method
In hydrothermal/solvothermal methods, chemical reactions are carried out in organic aqueous media. Generally, for the hydrothermal process, an aqueous dispersion of GCN and plasmonic NPs are mixed and transferred to a Teflon lined autoclave which is further subjected to high-temperature treatment for a particular time period. The resulting product is washed and dried thoroughly for further use. In the case of solvothermal treatment, instead of water, several organic solvents such as ethanol, methanol, dimethyl formamide, toluene, etc. are used. For the synthesis of plasmon mediated GCN, hydrothermal/solvothermal methods have been proved very effective.69 In one such report Kumar et al.37 synthesized Au–GCN–RGO nanocomposites via hydrothermal treatment. GCN nanosheets were synthesized by calcination of dicyandiamide at 550 °C for 4 h and re-calcinated at 500 °C for 2 h. The obtained GCN nanosheets were protonated with HCl solution with continuous stirring and sonication for 3 h. The thus obtained protonated GCN was washed with water and dried at 70 °C. Au–GCN–RGO nanocomposites were synthesized by mixing protonated GCN, GO and Au nanostars in 40 mL of ethanol while stirring. The reaction mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and was heated for 24 h at 180 °C. Under such high temperature conditions, GO gets reduced to RGO. The resulting nanocomposite was washed with the water/ethanol mixture and dried at 70 °C for 10 h for further use. In another report, Gao et al.70 reported a facile hydrothermal synthesis of the 3D GCN/Ag/LaFeO3 photocatalyst. The Ag/LaFeO3 NPs were synthesized by a photo-reduction deposition method wherein LaFeO3 and AgNO3 were dissolved in deionized water and stirred for 1 h. The obtained solution was subjected to Ag reduction using 400 W metal halide light irradiation for 1 h. Finally, the sample was washed with ethanol and deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 4 h. GCN was synthesized by the calcination of melamine at 250 °C for 1 h and 550 °C for 2 h. After calcination the sample was washed with HNO3 and deionized water and dried for further use. The 3D photocatalyst was then prepared by mixing the solution of GCN and Ag/LaFeO3 NPs in ethanol via sonication and heating it at 120 °C for 6 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel. The obtained photocatalyst was centrifuged and washed with ethanol and deionized water thoroughly and dried for further use.
Wang and coworkers66 reported a facile hydrothermal method for the synthesis of a 3D silver/silver bromide/graphitic carbon nitride@nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (Ag/AgBr/GCN@NGA) photocatalyst. GCN and GO were modified by uniform dispersion of chitosan onto their surfaces which gets self-assembled to form GCN@NGA. GCN@NGA was further subjected to hydrothermal treatment using a nitrogen source to form a 3D framework. Further, the 3D hydrogel was immersed in NaBr and AgNO3 solutions which resulted in the in situ growth of Ag/AgBr NPs. The final Ag/AgBr/GCN@NGA photocatalyst was obtained by freeze-drying as shown in Fig. 4(b). The synergistic combination of Ag/AgBr/GCN@NGA enhances the visible light absorption, charge separation and mass transport efficiency. In addition, the 3D porous structure of NGA prevents the photo corrosion of AgBr. The HRTEM images of NGA (Fig. 4c) and Ag/AgBr/GCN@NGA (Fig. 4d and e) show uniform distribution and dispersion of Ag/AgBr NPs over the GCN@NGA photocatalyst.
Zhao et al.71 synthesized a ternary Au/GCN/Co3O4 plasmonic nanocomposite using a facile hydrothermal route. GCN nanosheets were synthesized by calcination of urea at 550 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. The obtained product was re-calcinated at 550 °C for 2 h and finally exfoliated using isopropanol through ultrasonication. The obtained GCN nanosheets were dried at 80 °C for 6 h. The Au/GCN nanosheets were synthesized by dispersing 0.1 g of GCN nanosheets in 50 mL of distilled water via sonication and adding 0.002 g of HAuCl4·3H2O into the dispersion. After continuous stirring for 1 h, 15 mL of NaBH4 (15 mM) solution was slowly added to the reaction mixture and allowed to stir for 3 h. Finally, the Au/GCN samples were obtained through centrifugation. Furthermore, the Co3O4 nanocubes were in situ fabricated onto Au/GCN nanosheets via a hydrothermal method. In brief, Au/GCN and Co(NO3)2.6H2O were mixed in 40 mL of distilled water with continuous stirring for 1 h to ensure complete absorption of Co2+ ions. To this reaction mixture, 1 mmol NaOH solution was added and stirred for 30 min. The reaction mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless vessel and heated at 180 °C for 5 h. The final product was obtained through centrifugation and washed with water and ethanol several times. Finally, the Au/GCN/Co3O4 photocatalyst was vacuum dried for 12 h at 80 °C.
Plasmon mediated GCN having distinct morphologies can also be synthesized using solvothermal processes. In this regard, Xu et al.72 reported the synthesis of Ag/AgCl decorated carbon nitride (CN) nanorods by a solvothermal method using melamine and cyanuric chloride as the precursors in acetonitrile solvent. The Ag/AgCl NPs were synthesized by a facile precipitation and photoreduction method using AgNO3. The Ag/AgCl-CN nanocomposites were formed by the hydrothermal treatment of as-synthesized CN nanorods and Ag/AgCl NPs at 120 °C for 12 h. The obtained CN samples were further washed with distilled water and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The as-synthesized photocatalysts exhibited nanorod morphology with a diameter of about 25 nm and length around 1.5 μm wherein Ag/AgCl NPs were decorated irregularly over the CN surface. The Ag and CN heterojunctions showed enhanced photoabsorption and photocatalytic performance. In another report, a novel ternary Pd/GCN/Bi2MoO6 photocatalyst having flower-like hollow morphology was synthesized via solvothermal and a subsequent photodeposition method.73 GCN nanosheets were synthesized by calcination of melamine at 550 °C. GCN/Bi2MoO6 heterojunctions were synthesized by a solvothermal precipitation–calcination method. A weighed amount of GCN and Bi2MoO6 was dispersed in methanol ultrasonically for 1 h. The obtained product was subjected to calcination at 300 °C for 1 h. Pd NPs were dispersed over GCN/Bi2MoO6 heterojunctions via a photodeposition method. A calculated amount of PdCl2 and GCN/Bi2MoO6 composite was dispersed in deionized water while stirring. The reaction mixture was irradiated using a 60 W UV lamp for 2 h. The obtained product was washed and dried thoroughly for further use.
3.3 Sonochemical method
Sonication-assisted chemical reactions take place through a phenomenon called acoustic cavitation.74 This process involves the formation of a bubble, its subsequent growth and finally implosive collapse of the bubble. At the time of collapse, intense localized hot spots are generated, which have high pressure and transient temperature. At these hot spots, a large amount of energy is available which is utilized for completion of different chemical processes.75 Using this principle, Jin et al.76 utilized an ultrasonication method for the facile synthesis of the MoS2/Ag/GCN nanocomposite. The Ag/GCN photocatalyst was synthesized by dispersion of 0.5 g of GCN in distilled water via sonication and subsequent addition of AgNO3. The reaction mixture was then irradiated under UV light for 3 h. The obtained product was then washed thoroughly and dried for further use. Furthermore, the MoS2/Ag/GCN nanocomposite was synthesized by sonication of 0.5 g of MoS2 and 0.5 g of Ag/GCN for 2 h. A uniform combination of MoS2 with GCN occurs via electrostatic interactions. The resultant MoS2/Ag/GCN nanocomposite was dried at 60 °C. Both GCN and MoS2 have similar layered structures; hence the MoS2/GCN heterojunction can significantly improve the electron transfer and avoid the recombination of charge carriers which in turn enhances the photocatalytic activity.
Mao and coworkers77 reported innovative fabrication of Ag NPs and GCN on pre-treated carbon fiber paper (t-CFP) using the ultrasonic spray atomization (USA) process. The role of t-PFP was to provide 3D large surface areas to promote the nucleation of GCN. USA is a micro droplet system which employs combined thermal polymerization and improved electroless plating (IEP) processes for the synthesis of the desired nanocomposites. GCN/t-CFP was synthesized by thermal condensation of melamine and t-CFP at 550 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace. After 4 h the resulting mixture was allowed to cool naturally and the obtained powder was crushed to a fine powder. GCN/t-CFP was further dispersed in water and sonicated for 30 min to remove any additional surface adsorbed GCN on the t-CFP surface. The sonicated GCN/t-CFP was immersed in silver ammonia solution for 1 h with constant stirring. This solution was placed horizontally over USA with addition of hydrazine monohydrate as a reducing agent. The obtained final product was washed with distilled water and dried overnight at 70 °C. USA can effectively eliminate the adverse effects of the concentration gradient, and hence small sized Ag NPs with high dispersity can be achieved as shown in Fig. 5a–g. The TEM images of GCN/t-CFP synthesized via IEP show high dispersity of Ag nanoparticles as compared to those synthesized via conventional electroless plating (CEP) method.

Joseph et al.79 reported the facile synthesis of a S doped GCN/Ag3VO4/β-AgVO3/Ag (SGA-x) quaternary nanohybrid using the ultrasonic assisted Kirkendall effect and diffusion method followed by low temperature phase conversion. First of all S doped GCN was synthesized by calcination of thiourea at 550 °C in static air. The obtained yellow powder was crushed to a fine powder and subjected to sonication in distilled water for 16 h. The suspension was then centrifuged to remove the bulk S doped GCN. The exfoliated S doped GCN was further dried thoroughly for further use. Further to synthesize the S doped GCN/Ag3VO4 nanocomposite (SGA), 100 mg of S doped GCN was sonicated in distilled water for 30 min. After complete dispersion, 78 mg of AgNO3 was added to the reaction and allowed to react while stirring for 1 h. 5 M NaOH solution was added to the reaction mixture slowly until the pH reached 10 followed by the addition of ammonium metavanadate. The obtained suspension was further sonicated for 2 h followed by washing with distilled water and ethanol and drying at 60 °C for 24 h. The SGA-x nanocomposites were synthesized via a phase transition method, wherein SGA was dispersed in water and the calculated amount of Na2S was added while stirring for 4 h under dark conditions. The obtained SGA-x was washed with water and dried at 80 °C for 2 h. The as-synthesized nanocomposites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity arising from the combined effects of heterostructured hollow morphology, high surface area, high solar utilization, reduced photocorrosion and the SPR effect of Ag NPs. In another report, Chuaicham et al.80 synthesized a sepiolite/GCN/Pd ternary composite via ultrasound-mediated borohydride reduction. GCN was synthesized by thermal polymerization of melamine by calcination at 550 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. The furnace was allowed to cool naturally and a yellow-colored GCN powder was obtained. For the synthesis of the sepiolite/GCN/Pd NP composite, a calculated amount of GCN and sepiolite was dissolved in distilled water with vigorous stirring. To this mixture, 320 mL of HCl (0.1%) and PdCl42− solution was added and the pH of the reaction mixture was maintained at 2. Furthermore, 0.1 M NaBH4 solution was added to the reaction mixture slowly with continuous stirring and subsequent sonication for 3 h. The final product was obtained as a gray colored solid which was then filtered and washed thoroughly for further use.
In another report, a Ag/Bi2Sn2O7-CN plasmonic photocatalyst was synthesized via combined sonication, thermal treatment and the subsequent sono-photodeposition processes.81 GCN was synthesized by calcination of melamine at 550 °C for 4 h with a ramp rate of 1 °C min−1. GCN was dispersed over Bi2Sn2O7 by ultrasonication. First of all, GCN was dispersed in distilled water under 150 W ultrasonic energy for 1 h. To this dispersion, Bi2Sn2O7 was added and again the reaction mixture was sonicated for 30 min. The resulting mixture was heated in an autoclave at 150 °C for 6 h. The obtained Bi2Sn2O7-CN precipitates were washed and dried for 24 h. Furthermore, Ag NPs were deposited over Bi2Sn2O7-CN through a sono-photodeposition method. This involves ultrasonic dispersion of Bi2Sn2O7-CN in distilled water by using a 100 W probe sonicator for 30 min. To this dispersion, AgNO3 solution was added slowly and the resultant mixture was irradiated using a 400 W tungsten halogen lamp for 2 h. Finally, the solution was filtered and washed with water several times and dried for 24 h at room temperature.
3.4 Other strategies
Synthesis of plasmon mediated GCN also involves several other strategies besides the above-mentioned processes. In one such report, a GCN/Ag photocatalyst was prepared using a laser ablation method in liquid phase (LAL).82 LAL is a simple green synthetic route for the synthesis of various nanocomposites as it is inexpensive, fast and does not make use of any catalysts, reducing agents and surfactants which can cause adverse environmental impact. GCN was synthesized by pyrolysis of urea at 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 3 h. The obtained yellow GCN powder was used for the LAL process. For the synthesis of pure Au NPs, a Au plate was cleaned thoroughly via ultrasonication using acetone and distilled water. The washed Au plate was immersed in 5 mL of distilled water and was subjected to a fiber laser having a laser pulse of 100 ns and the process was continued for 360 s. To prevent aggregation of Au NPs the LAL process was stopped after every 60 s and repeated using 5 mL of fresh distilled water. After each 60 s cycle the red-colored colloidal NP solution was transferred to a separate beaker. The GCN/Au nanocomposite was prepared by dispersion of 100 mg of GCN powder in 30 mL of ethanol/water (2:1) mixture through sonication for 3 h. After this process, the obtained solution of Au NPs was added to the dispersion and again sonicated for 1 h and magnetically stirred for 1 h. The as-synthesized GCN/Au nanocomposite was separated via centrifugation and dried at room temperature for further use. In another report, Abbasi et al.83 synthesized Ag2C2O4/Ag/GCN nanocomposites with different weights of Ag by a precipitation method. GCN was synthesized by calcination of melamine at 500 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace. The GCN powder was exfoliated for 2 days via sonication and dried at 80 °C. For the synthesis of Ag2C2O4, Na2C2O4 (0.849 g) was dissolved in 25 mL of water with continuous stirring, and then a 25 mL solution of AgNO3 (0.67 g) was added to the reaction mixture. The resulting dispersion was precipitated and washed thoroughly for further use. The Ag2C2O4/Ag/GCN nanocomposite was synthesized via a facile precipitation method. First of all, the GCN powder was dispersed in distilled water via sonication. Then the calculated amounts of Na2C2O4 were added to the GCN suspension and stirred for 30 min; after this, 25 mL solution of AgNO3 was added to the mixture. The obtained precipitates of Ag2C2O4/Ag/GCN were washed with distilled water and ethanol and finally dried at 50 °C.
Sun et al.78 synthesized a Ag@AgCl/CNNS photocatalyst by an in situ ion exchange implantation and anchoring approach as shown in Fig. 5h. At first, the bulk GCN was prepared by thermal polymerization of melamine at 550 °C for 4 h. The bulk GCN was further exfoliated and chlorinated using 1 M NaClO solution with continuous stirring for 5 h. The resulting chloridized GCN nanosheets (CNNS) were washed with distilled water several times and vacuum dried at 60 °C. The anchored Cl sites onto the GCN nanosheets are utilized for the implantation and anchoring of Ag NPs by positive/negative charge combination. For the synthesis of the Ag@AgCl/CNNS nanocomposite, a calculated amount of CNNS nanosheets was added to 100 mL of AgNO3 solution and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The solution was then irradiated with 280 nm UV light (0.02 W cm−2) for 5 min. The resulting gray precipitates were then washed thoroughly and dried to obtain the Ag@AgCl/CNNS plasmonic photocatalyst for photocatalytic applications.
Hassani et al.84 synthesized mpGCN/Ag/ZnO NWs/Zn photocatalyst plates using a facile dip coating of GCN and Ag NPs onto ZnO nanowires. mpGCN was synthesized by a hard template method which involves the thermal condensation of guanidine hydrochloride using Ludox HS-40 colloidal silica as the template.85 ZnO nanowires/Zn plates were synthesized via electrochemical anodic oxidation of Zn plates. For the synthesis of mpGCN/Ag/ZnO NWs/Zn plates using dip coating, 100 mg of mpGCN was sonicated in 100 mL of water for 15 min (solution A) and 0.1 M AgNO3 solution was prepared by dissolving 1.7 g of AgNO3 in 100 mL of distilled water (solution B). 25 mL of solution A was mixed with 25 mL of solution B and the resultant mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min. Furthermore, ZnO NWs/Zn plates were dipped in the reaction mixture for 60 min with continuous stirring. The resultant composite was then washed with water several times and dried at room temperature. The obtained samples were subjected to annealing at 200 °C for 2 h to acquire crystalline mpGCN/Ag/ZnO NWs/Zn plates. The plasmon mediated GCN based photocatalysts synthesized from the above-mentioned techniques can be effectively utilized for photocatalytic applications with high catalytic efficiency having high light absorption and minimum charge recombination.
4. Photocatalytic applications
4.1 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
To address the current energy and environmental demands, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution comes out as a potential means for converting solar energy into a chemical form. To achieve this target, it is highly desirable to design and develop an ideal photocatalytic material with suitable band gap energy and band edge positions that are capable of absorbing sufficient solar light.86
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is a thermodynamically uphill reaction, with a standard Gibbs free energy of +237.2 kJ mol−1 as shown in equation 8. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process involves three major steps:
(1) generation of electron–hole pairs when the photocatalyst is excited with the light photons having energy equal to or greater than the bandgap of the semiconductor,
(2) migration of the charge carriers to the catalyst surface or recombination of the charge carriers and
(3) photogenerated electrons in the CB of the photocatalyst are responsible for generating hydrogen from water as shown in equation 8 and 9. 2H2O + 4hν → 2H2 + O2, ΔG0 = +237.2 kJ mol−1(8) 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2, E0 = 0 V vs. NHE(9)Stable heterogeneous photocatalysts such as TiO2, CdSe, GCN, etc. have been widely studied for hydrogen generation reactions due to suitable energy band edge positions and their high photocorrosion resistance.87,88 However, these photocatalysts are associated with limited absorption of light and fast recombination of charge carriers due to their large bandgap and slow kinetics of charge transfer.89 For efficient utilization of solar energy, it is highly desirable to look for an effective strategy that enables light harvesting in the broad solar region as well as triggers the fast transfer of photogenerated charge carriers. Zhang et al. have synthesized plasmon-mediated self-assembled Au/CdSe nanocrystal clusters with a remarkable H2-evolution rate (almost 10 times higher than that of bare CdSe).90 Similarly, the plasmonic metal NPs coupled with GCN play a dual role in enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen generation efficiency. Firstly, they can act as a cocatalyst to improve the rate of hydrogen generation via separating the charge carriers in the presence of sacrificial agents such as triethanolamine (TEOA), triethylamine (TEA), methanol, etc. Secondly, by utilizing their plasmonic effect they can harvest a broad solar spectrum for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.37,91 The plasmonic effect is influenced by the size, shape and surrounding environment of the metal NPs which play a major role in harvesting the different regions of the solar spectrum.92 Thus, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency and apparent quantum yield (AQY) efficiency can be easily tuned by decorating the metal NPs on GCN. Various plasmonic metal NPs of Au, Ag, Pt, Rh, Ni, etc. decorated on GCN have already been utilized for improving the photocatalytic hydrogen generation process.93–97
In this regard, Leung and coworkers have synthesized a novel Z-scheme GCN/SnS2 photocatalyst decorated with plasmonic Ag NPs for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation under visible light irradiation.98 The wt% of Ag NPs was varied as 1 wt%, 3 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt% over GCN/SnS2 nanosheets. Among the prepared photocatalysts the GCN/SnS2 decorated with 5 wt% Ag NPs exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution of 1104.5 μmol g−1 h−1. The photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the improved visible light absorption caused by the SPR effect and effective interfacial charge transfer. In another work, Li and coworkers used sequential photodeposition of auric and platinic precursors to synthesize a photocatalytic system consisting of Au and metallic/oxidized Pt NPs decorated on GCN for hydrogen generation.99 The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the synergistic effect of the plasmonic Au and Pt NPs to harvest the broad solar spectrum and the electron-sink effect of Pt. The 0.3% Au–0.3% Pt decorated GCN samples showed the best photocatalytic performance with hydrogen generation rates of 139 and 2560 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible and solar light irradiation, respectively. In addition, the representative nanocomposite achieved an AQY of 1.92% at 420 nm which was 3 times higher than that of the 1 wt% Pt/GCN sample. On a similar line Wang and coworkers developed a novel and facile metal–organic supramolecular hydrogel as a self-template for the synthesis of Ag/GCN nanofibers which exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen generation.100 A series of photocatalysts abbreviated as AgMA1, AgMA2 and AgMA3 were synthesized by varying the metal–precursor molar ratio as 1:12, 1:6 and 1:2, respectively. The prepared nanofibers exhibited plasmonic enhanced visible light absorption, excellent specific surface area and enhanced separation of charge carriers. The optimized nanofibers (AgMA2 with 26% of Ag) showed 1.66 times higher hydrogen generation efficiency as compared to pristine GCN under visible light irradiation. However, negligible photocatalytic activity was observed with higher amount of Ag (55%) due to higher numbers of defects caused by the high Ag content hampering the charge transfer process as shown in Fig. 6a and b. Furthermore, the optimized nanohybrid (AgMA2) showed an almost negligible decrease in the photocatalytic activity even after three cycles of reusability.

The combination of plasmonic and upconversion effects solves the issue of insufficient utilization of the full solar spectrum by semiconductor photocatalysts.102 Zeng et al. reported a plasmonic photocatalyst consisting of carbon quantum dots (CQD)/GCN decorated with Ag NPs and utilized it for photo-driven hydrogen generation.101 The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite was attributable to the synergistic effect of the plasmonic Ag NPs and upconverted PL properties of CQD. The presence of Ag NPs and CQD accelerates the separation of charge carriers by accepting the electrons from the conduction band of GCN. A remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen generation of 626.93 μmol g−1 h−1 was achieved using the 3 wt% Ag NP/CQD/GCN nanocomposite, which is about 6.7 and 2.8 times higher than that of pristine GCN and CQD/GCN, respectively. A plausible mechanism has been formulated for the light-driven aqueous proton reduction as shown in Fig. 6c. It was observed that the GCN matrix absorbed visible light (λ < 460 nm) to excite the electrons from VB to CB. At a wavelength less than 550 nm, the strongly induced local electromagnetic fields by Ag NPs allow the photocatalytic system to capture further photons thereby accelerating the separation of charge carriers. Furthermore, the CQD up-converted the longer wavelengths (λ > 550 nm) to shorter wavelengths, which contributed to the excitation of GCN and Ag/GCN systems. The LSPR effect of the Ag NPs further promoted the light-harvesting capacity of CQD due to the photosensitization effect. Overall, the representative nanocomposite was successful in utilizing the broad solar spectrum for an efficient photocatalytic hydrogen generation process. Table 2 shows the summary of plasmon mediated GCN based materials reported for the photocatalytic hydrogen generation and water splitting processes.

4.2 Photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution
GCN is a promising photoanode material because of its appropriate band gap (∼2.7 eV) for the absorption of photons with a wide energy range, suitable band edge positions that allow the design of a variety of heterostructures consisting of metals and nonmetals, dense and accessible active sites in the form of pyridinic-N, unique electronic structure due to the graphene-like framework, and so forth. As highlighted in the introduction section, one of the overriding challenges of photocatalytic systems is undesired electron–hole pair recombination, which is the major energy-wasting process. To address this challenge, the preparation of a photoanode comprising GCN and employing it in the PEC process is a promising technical solution. A schematic showing the basic mechanism of the PEC process involving GCN is shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Schematic showing the generation and transfer of charge carriers leading to water oxidation and H2 production in the presence of the GCN photoanode. 
When the photons carrying sufficient energy strike the GCN surface, absorption takes place. As a result, the electrons accumulated in the VB are excited to the available CB. Under the influence of a potential bias, the excited electrons are carried away, through an external circuit, from the surface of GCN to the cathode where they participate in the reduction of H2O and H+ to produce H2 gas. The photo-excited holes, which would have recombined with electrons otherwise, remain available for water oxidation. In addition, the surface of GCN can be modified to tap its potential in photoelectrocatalytic water splitting or H2 production. Modification of GCN with metals and nonmetals showing plasmonic characteristics is particularly useful as it can enhance the light absorption threshold and the density of excitons and reduce electron–hole pair recombination. With this view, the surface of GCN is modified with noble metals, metals, metal nitrides, metal phosphides, and so forth. In this section, we highlight some interesting studies which focus on the improvement of the water or OH− oxidation property of GCN through surface modification with metals and nonmetals showing plasmonic behavior. Note that the extensive literature investigation reveals that most of the studies have utilized GCN and its modified compositions for photocatalytic application, and hence potential lies in engineering the GCN structure for the PEC process.
Au and Ag NPs show the SPR effect when exposed to visible light radiation. Since the electronic and optical attributes of noble metals can be modulated by fine-tuning their size and shape, modification of the GCN surface with Au, Pt and Ag can improve its properties in multiple ways and make it a highly desirable catalyst for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Noble metals are capable of (1) serving as cocatalysts to facilitate redox reactions, (2) acting as an electron sink to improve the charge capture, separation and transfer, and (3) harvesting more energy from visible radiation through the SPR effect. This aspect has been investigated in detail by conducting experiments under UV (250–380 nm), UV-vis (256–600 nm), and green laser (532 nm).140 For any study, it becomes important to distinguish the role of noble metals. In addition to serving as a visible light absorber, select noble metals, such as Au NPs, can act as a thermal redox active center.141 Parida et al. prepared a Au-modified GCN plasmonic photocatalytic system for highly efficient H2 production.142 The photocatalysts were prepared by a deposition–precipitation method. GCN was obtained by heating melamine at 550 °C for 2 h. Then, different amounts of Au NPs were deposited onto the surface of GCN using HAuCl4 acid and urea solution by thermal decomposition at 80 °C. After filtration and drying, the product was again heated at 300 °C for 2 h. The surface of Au/GCN is shown in Fig. 8a–d.
 Fig. 8  TEM images of Au/GCN: (a) 0.5 wt% Au, (b) 1.0 wt% Au, and (c and d) 2 wt% Au, and HRTEM image of Au/GCN (with 1 wt% Au) and the SAED pattern (inset of (d)), (e–g) comparison of current–potential curves of GCN and Au/GCN with 1 wt% and 2 wt% Au.

Using these images, the particle size of the Au NP was determined to be between 12 and 16 nm. The optical spectra revealed that the presence of Au NPs on the surface of GCN enhanced the visible light absorption because of the SPR effect of Au NPs. The band gap energies of GCN and 1 wt% Au/GCN were calculated to be 2.71 eV and 2.36 eV, respectively. The photoelectrodes were prepared by the electrophoretic deposition method, and the photoelectrochemical water oxidation was performed using a standard three-electrode cell in the presence of visible light (λ ≥ 400 nm). The current–potential curves of pure GCN and GCN modified with 1 and 2 wt% Au NPs are shown in Fig. 8e–g. It is clear from the figure that the water oxidation improved substantially after Au deposition on GCN. The photocurrents in the presence of pure GCN, 1 wt% Au/GCN and 2 wt% Au/GCN were calculated to be 15 μA cm−2, 49.5 mA cm−2 and 23.5 mA cm−2, respectively. Such a remarkable enhancement in photocurrent was attributed to visible light absorption and SPR brought about by Au NPs. It was proposed that the induced plasmonic resonance of Au facilitated the electron migration through the Schottky barrier at the Au/GCN interfaces. Similarly, Wang et al. prepared a Au-modified phosphorus-doped GCN photocatalyst, which exhibited excellent visible light photocatalytic activity.143 The bare GCN showed <1 μA cm−2, while phosphorus doped GCN and Au-modified (3 wt%) phosphorus doped GCN exhibited ∼3 μA cm−2 and 15 μA cm−2, respectively. The improvement in photocurrent density was explained in terms of enhanced light absorption and better charge carrier separation and transfer, which were brought about by the SPR effect of Au and phosphorus doping.
In another study, Chang and coworkers demonstrated efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of GCN after Au deposition.144 The enhancement in performance was rationalized in terms of the SPR effect of Au. First, bulk GCN was prepared by heating melamine at 550 °C in air for 4 h. Then, the GCN sheet was obtained by further exfoliating bulk GCN in an oxidation process. The Au deposition was carried out using HAuCl4 acid and urea solutions at 80 °C for 4 h. After the reaction, the collected powder was heated again at 300 °C for 2 h in air. The microstructural information of the GCN nanosheet and Au/GCN nanosheet was collected based on TEM images. It is evident that the deposited Au NPs are spherical in shape and uniformly distributed across the surface of GCN. The average particle size of Au NPs was measured to be ∼15 nm. The study performed by Chang et al. clearly showed that the Au NPs have an SPR effect on GCN and hence on oxygen evolution reaction. This was confirmed by performing measurements in the absence of light, with 520 nm laser radiation and under simulated sunlight irradiation. A 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution was used as an electrolyte. The polarization curves of GCN and Au/GCN recorded under different conditions are compared in Fig. 9a and b. In the absence of any radiation, GCN produced 10 mA cm−2 at 1.92 V with an overpotential of 690 mV. Under simulated sunlight, the potential requirement decreased to 1.87 V or an overpotential of 640 mV for the same current density. Note that when the electrode was illuminated with the laser at 520 nm, the current density remained the same as that observed in the case of GCN. This was expected as no SPR effect is likely in the absence of Au NPs. Interestingly, the current densities are significantly improved when Au-modified GCN is used as a photoelectrode. The Au/GCN photoanode generated 10 mA cm−2 at 1.71 V with an overpotential of 480 mV under dark conditions, 210 mV lower than that of the GCN sheet. Moreover, under simulated sunlight excitation, the Au/GCN photoelectrode required only 400 mV overpotential (80 mV less) to generate the same current density. Interestingly, the Au/GCN photoelectrode required an overpotential of 440 mV upon irradiation with a 520 nm laser, which is 40 mV smaller than that obtained under dark conditions. The finding clearly suggested that the SPR effect of Au NPs is capable of improving the OER reaction. These findings were further supported by Tafel plots (Fig. 9c). The Faraday efficiency of the Au/GCN electrode was recorded under simulated sunlight illumination, and the results are shown in Fig. 9b. The stability of the Au/GCN photoelectrode was also evaluated by performing potentiostat measurement at an overpotential of 400 mV for 8 h. Up to 8 h of continuous operation, the photoelectrode showed 14 decreases in the current density. In addition to the potentiometric experiment, cyclic voltammetry was also performed to evaluate the electrode stability. The spent electrode, obtained after 1000 cycles, was re-polarized and LSV was recorded. The comparison of LSVs recorded before and after the stability test, Fig. 9d, indicated that the performance of the spent electrode remains almost intact. These results indicated the good stability of the Au/GCN electrode under applied photoelectrochemical conditions.

The improvement in the OER performance of Au/GCN under visible light was primarily attributed to three factors:
(1) Absorption of photons by GCN leads to the generation of electron–hole pairs. Under an applied bias, the excited charge carriers get effectively separated from each other through the channeling of electrons from the anode to cathode. The presence of holes on the GCN surface lowers the adsorption energy of OH−, and the OH− adsorption/desorption process is considered as the rate-determining step for the oxygen evolution reaction.145 Effective charge separation and reduced adsorption energy of OH− together lead to the better catalytic performance.
(2) The second factor relates to the Schottky barrier presumably formed between Au and g-C3N4. Driven by the differences in the work function of Au and GCN, the electrons generated and separated at the surface of GCN can shuttle to Au nanoparticles (and finally to the cathode) through the Schottky barrier, preventing electron–hole pair recombination making GCN a more electron-deficient body. The positive polarization of the GCN surface in the presence of abundant holes is likely to facilitate OH− adsorption and ensuing oxidation reactions. In addition, Au NPs contribute to overall performance through the SPR effect, which is likely to amplify the absorption and increase the concentration of charge carriers.
(3) The third factor is correlated to the combined effect of hot electron injection due to SPR and the presence of external bias. It was proposed that under such conditions, the Schottky barrier is likely to reduce, which leads to an increase in charge transfer and hence the OER performance.
In addition to Au NPs, the presence of Ag NPs can contribute to the enhancement of PEC performance of the electrode, when exposed to visible light radiation. A ternary visible-light-responsive plasmonic photocatalyst was obtained by coupling GCN with Ag/AgBr.124 While Ag NPs showed the SPR effect, surface modification of semiconductors with halides of Ag (e.g., AgCl, AgBr, AgI) alleviated the electron–hole pair recombination. The Ag/AgBr/GCN nanocomposite was prepared by an improved deposition-precipitation, followed by in situ photoreduction of the silver ion (Ag+). The bare GCN was obtained by calcination (600 °C, 4 h) of urea (10 g) in an air environment. The nanocomposite of Ag/AgBr/GCN was synthetized by deposition-precipitation, and in situ photoreduction, using silver nitrate and 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide as the Ag and Br source, respectively. The nanosheet morphology with a large specific surface area seemed to provide sufficient sites for the growth of Ag/AgBr NPs. The particle size distribution was determined to be mainly between 40 and 60 nm. Photoelectrochemical water splitting was performed under visible light irradiation (>420 nm, 100 mW cm−2) using Ag/AgBr/GCN as the working electrode, while the Pt plate and Ag/AgCl served as counter and reference electrodes. The photocurrent was recorded under intermittent visible illumination as a function of Ag/AgBr amount. The bare GCN produced 0.13 μA cm−2, and the photocurrent increased with increasing Ag/AgBr, up to 18% Ag/AgBr (0.87 μA cm−2), followed by a decrease. The optimized ternary composition, 18%Ag/AgBr/GCN, exhibited 27-fold better H2 production than that of pristine GCN. In addition, the photoanode comprising Ag/AgBr/GCN exhibited approximately 7-fold higher photocurrent as compared to GCN for photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation under visible light irradiation. The improvement in the performance was attributed to the enhancement of light absorption through the SPR effect of Ag and the formation of a heterostructure between AgBr and GCN. A schematic highlighting the energy diagram and charge separation in Ag/AgBr/GCN under visible-light irradiation is presented in Fig. 9e and f. Due to energetically favorable band edges of AgBr and GCN, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of GCN can move to the CB of AgBr, while the holes from the VB of AgBr can migrate to the VB of GCN preventing electron–hole pair recombination. The presence of Ag NPs presumably amplified the overall charge concentration on the surface of photocatalytic systems when exposed to visible light radiation.
Although noble metals show a strong plasmonic effect, their high cost remains a challenge for the final application. Researchers also focused on developing GCN-based plasmonic photocatalysts comprising cost-effective metals. In addition to low cost, bismuth NPs show unique optical–electronic properties and surface plasmon resonance. The SPR behavior of Bi NPs can be tuned from near-UV to NIR region.146 Driven by such intriguing properties, bismuth NPs are coupled with several photocatalytic systems, such as BiVO4,147,148 BiOCl,149 and GCN/Bi/Bi2WO6,150 to create heterojunctions and improve the performance. Similarly, Subrahmaniyam and coworkers designed a plasmonic photocatalyst consisting of GCN/Bi2S3 decorated with Bi NPs and evaluated the photocatalytic systems for photoelectrochemical water oxidation reaction.151 GCN was first prepared by heating melamine at 550 °C for 4 h. Bi NPs were synthesized separately by chemical reduction of bismuth acetate (Bi(CH3COO)3) by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in acidic solution. The working electrode or photoanode was prepared by depositing GCN on FTO glass by the doctor blade technique, followed by the growth of Bi2S3 quantum dots. The Bi2S3 quantum dots were grown by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method using precursor solutions of Bi(NO3)3·3H2O in acetone and Na2S in methanol. Finally, the ternary photocatalytic assembly (GCN/Bi2S3/Bi) was obtained by drop-casting pre-prepared Bi NPs on the GCN/Bi2S3 film. Bismuth NPs, due to their plasmonic properties, showed strong absorption in the range of 300–680 nm, while the absorption spectral range of GCN was narrow with an absorption edge at 460 nm which corresponds to its bandgap (∼2.7 eV). The surface modification of GCN with Bi2S3 QDs led to the extension of the absorption threshold into the infrared region. The absorption quality of GCN/Bi2S3 was further improved, in the visible regime in particular, upon immobilization of Bi NPs.
Comparative linear sweep voltammograms obtained in the presence of GCN, GCN/Bi2S3 and GCN/Bi2S3/BiNPs are shown in Fig. 10. All the photocurrent generated due to water oxidation was recorded under visible light illumination using 0.1 M Na2SO4 and Na2SO3 as electrolytes. The results indicated that the photoanode consisting of the GCN/Bi2S3/BiNPs ternary composite showed a high photo-current density of 7.11 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V. The photocurrent obtained with GCN/Bi2S3/BiNPs was approximately 2 and 10 times higher than that of GCN/Bi2S3 (3.54 mA cm−2) and GCN (0.74 mA cm−2) photoanodes, respectively. In addition, the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (η) of electrodes was determined using η = J (1.23 – V)/Plight. The variation in η with respect to applied potential is shown in Fig. 10a and b. The ternary composite electrode again demonstrated superior η. At 0.4 V, the η for GCN, GCN/Bi2S3 and GCN/Bi2S3/BiNPs photoelectrodes was estimated to be 0.05, 1.23 and 3.51%, respectively. Fig. 10c compares the photostability of different electrodes, performed using potentiostatic measurements at 0.4 V. The photoelectrode consisting of GCN/Bi2S3/BiNPs showed excellent chemical stability for 100 min. In addition, the formation of H2 at the cathode was quantified and the change in H2 concentration with irradiation time in the presence of GCN/Bi2S3/BiNPs is shown in Fig. 10d. The experiment was performed at 1.23 V vs. RHE for 2 h. The GCN/Bi2S3/BiNPs photoanode showed the maximum H2 evolution over 2 h. Although the results obtained in the presence of GCN and GCN/Bi2S3 were not presented, the authors claimed that the photoelectrode comprising GCN/Bi2S3/BiNPs exhibited the highest H2 formation.

For the concurrent charge transfer in the GCN/Bi2S3/BiNPs composite, the authors proposed that first excitation takes place in Bi2S3 and GCN producing electron–hole pairs. Owing to the energetically favored band-edge alignment, the photogenerated electrons migrate from the conduction band (CB) of Bi2S3 to the CB of GCN while the photogenerated holes are transferred from the valence band (VB) of GCN to the valence band of Bi2S3. Such charge transfer tends to minimize the electron–hole pair recombination. Meanwhile, the electrons generated because of the surface plasmon BiNPs can efficiently channel through the CB of Bi2S3 and the CB of GCN, and reach the contact electrode (FTO). Since the majority of holes are likely to accumulate in the valence band of Bi2S3, water oxidation takes place on the Bi2S3 surface. Meanwhile, the electrons travel through the external circuit and reach the cathode (Pt) to reduce protons and evolve H2 gas. The enhancement in the PEC performance was ascribed to (1) the SPR property of BiNPs that improves light-harvesting and (2) charge carrier density of Bi2S3 QDs which increases the light absorption range and reduces the charge carrier recombination. Construction of such heterostructure was possible due to the band-edges of GCN, which aligned very well with those of Bi2S3 to facilitate the charge transfer.
In addition to metal NPs, metal nitrides also show plasmonic properties and improve the properties of materials and hence their performance.153–158 Titanium nitride (TiN), a semi-metallic ceramic, has been shown as a potential composition for photo-generating hot charge carriers.159 Nagao and coworkers synthesized titanium nitride/zinc oxide/titanium dioxide tri-layers, and corroborated the generation of photocurrent under visible light irradiation.159 It is noteworthy to mention here that both ZnO and TiO2 are active only in the ultraviolet region. The excitation of hot electrons from TiN in the presence of visible light was discussed. The photocurrent produced under visible light was, therefore, attributed to the presence of TiN. In addition, the photocurrent generated in the presence of TiN was compared with that of Au by preparing a similar ZnO/TiO2 structure. It was shown that the photocurrent produced by using TiN was much larger than that obtained by using Au. These findings provided fresh impetus to use TiN, which is efficacious and cost-effective, in harvesting the visible region of the solar spectrum. Following the encouraging findings of TiN/ZnO/TiO2 trilayers, Nagao and colleagues prepared a three-component nanoassembly consisting of titanium nitride–GCN–carbon dots (TiN–GCN–C dots).152 The performance of the photocatalytic system was evaluated by studying the PEC under simulated sunlight. GCN was prepared by calcination of melamine at 550 °C for 2 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. The NPs of TiN were obtained by a thermal plasma method.160 The C dots were prepared by a hydrothermal method using citric acid and ethylenediamine.161 Preparation of TiN–GCN–C dots was carried out as follows: 10 mL of 10 wt% TiN in ethanol and 7 mL of 2.5 g L−1 C dots were added to 5 g of melamine, and heated under identical conditions that were used to prepare GCN. Similarly, GCN–C dot and Au–GCN–C dot composites were prepared. To perform the photoelectrochemical measurements, a thin film of the composite was deposited on an ITO glass by a drop-cast method. The microscopic studies revealed the uniform distribution of TiN onto the surface of GCN–C dots. The average size of TiN was measured to be ∼50 nm. In the case of the Au–GCN–C dots, the average size of Au was ∼13 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of GCN showed a strong peak in the 385–410 nm range. GCN exhibited an absorption edge at ∼450 nm, which corresponded to the intrinsic band gap of 2.7 eV. The addition of C dots increased the overall absorption spectra in the 320–700 nm range.
The photocurrent densities were recorded using different electrodes in the range of 450–700 nm. The photocurrent density can be directly related to photocatalytic performance. The performance trend was discerned to be TiN–GCN–C dots > Au–GCN–C dots > GCN–C dots > GCN under all radiation wavelengths. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of all the electrodes was also calculated and was found to follow the trend of photocurrent density. It was concluded that the light absorption and catalytic property of carbon nitride were improved by combining it with NPs of plasmonic titanium nitride (TiN) and carbon dots, respectively. During the photoelectrochemical process, carbon dots acted as a catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce oxygen (O2), as the in situ generated H2O2 can poison the GCN surface, while the hot-electrons generated in TiN are transferred to GCN. As a result, a six-fold enhancement in the PEC water splitting performance of GCN was recorded after modification with C dots and TiN.
An attempt was made to understand the mechanism of the increased optical absorption and photocurrent density after the addition of TiN or Au and C dots. The band structures of TiN–GCN–C dots and Au–GCN–C dots under light are delineated in Fig. 10e and b, respectively. The work function of TiN is 4.6 eV, the band gap of GCN is 2.7 eV, and the Fermi level lies at 4.07 eV from the vacuum level.23,162 It was suggested that when TiN is coupled with GCN, its Fermi levels undergo a re-alignment, and formation of a Schottky barrier of 0.7 eV at the interface of TiN and GCN is likely. Upon illumination, hot electrons were generated in TiN, and the hot electrons with energies higher than the Schottky barrier energy can be injected into the conduction band (CB) of GCN. Similarly, the band diagrams of Au–GCN–C dots are presented in Fig. 10f. The work function of Au is 5.2 eV, and when Au is interfaced with GCN, the formation of an energy barrier of 1.3 eV is expected. Such a high potential barrier, higher than that of TiN–GCN, can resist the transfer of hot carriers from Au to GCN. As a result, the Au–GCN–C dots exhibited poor performance as compared to the TiN–GCN–C dots. In addition, the absorption of Au NPs in the spectral range beyond 650 nm is weak.163 A summary of water splitting reactions in the presence of TiN–GCN–C dots is presented in Fig. 10g. As evident, the band edge positions are well-aligned to facilitate the charge transfer process, prevent the recombination rate, and drive both oxidation and reduction. In the case of the PEC process, the generated electrons will travel to the cathode through the external circuit, further reducing the electron–hole pair recombination and increasing the surface availability for water oxidation.
Recently, Lu and coworkers prepared a plasmonic photocatalyst, boron phosphide/graphitic carbon nitride composite (BP/GCN), in the form of a core–shell structure.125 The performance was assessed by monitoring the water oxidation under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) using a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The photoelectrochemical performance of BP/GCN was found to be ∼3 times higher than that of bare GCN. The respective photocurrent densities in the presence of BP/GCN and GCN were measured to be 3.5 μA cm−2 and 1.2 μA cm−2. The enhanced performance of BP/GCN was suggested to be due to the electromagnetic field enhancement induced by the LSPR effect. In addition, the catalyst also showed photocatalytic H2 production even under 730 nm.
5. Plasmon mediated GCN for environmental remediation
5.1 Photocatalytic pollutants’ degradation
The photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants is one of the most attractive strategies for wastewater treatment.164 Earlier used conventional adsorbents for the treatment of wastewater, such as active charcoal, metal–organic frameworks, silica gel, etc., are non-green and require harsh reaction conditions.165–168 Sometimes the secondary pollutants generated from the conventional methods are even more harmful than primary pollutants.169 To overcome these issues, photocatalytic pollutant degradation comes out as an alternative approach for wastewater treatment. The photocatalytic process is greener, reliable and involves complete mineralization of the organic pollutants to CO2 and water on light illumination. The charge carriers (electrons and holes) get separated in the presence of light which results in the generation of active species. These generated active species further attack the organic pollutants to degrade them into smaller fragments and then mineralize them completely. However, to achieve efficient photocatalytic activity, there should be minimal recombination of the charge carriers. In addition, the high adsorption capability of photocatalytic materials is another important factor that influences photocatalytic efficiency. The organic pollutants get adsorbed over the surface of the photocatalyst and get mineralize during the degradation process and are finally desorbed from the surface. Further, the new molecules get adsorbed and the process continues. Thus, this process shows high recyclability due to its heterogeneous nature. GCN as a polymeric photocatalyst allows multiple excitations from absorption of a single photon of light which results in the generation of highly active species responsible for the degradation of organic pollutants. However, photocatalysis is associated with the problem of fast recombination of charge carriers in photocatalysts and the photocatalysts do not remain photoactive for a longer time. The fast recombination of charge carriers can be avoided by the use of plasmonic metal NPs. In addition, these plasmonic metals also enhance the stability and thereby the reusability and recyclability of the photocatalyst. Dao et al. have reported the long term high stability of the Au@CeO2 photocatalyst even after five repetitive cycles.170 The plasmon mediated photocatalyst loses only 5% of activity while the activity of CeO2 decreases by 37.5%. The higher stability of the photocatalyst was ascribed to the electronic interactions between Au and CeO2. In addition, Xu et al. have reported the high photocatalytic activity and stability of AgX (X = Br, I) supported on GCN due to the formation of heterojunctions and the decrease in surface energy.171
Li and coworkers synthesized the Ag/GCN nanocomposite by depositing Ag NPs of size 5–20 nm over GCN nanosheets by a photodeposition method.172 Further the prepared nanocomposite (denoted as AGCN) showed effective visible light absorption and improved charge carrier separation and was utilized for the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation. It was observed that the optimum concentration of Ag NPs (8%) exhibits almost 7 times higher photocatalytic activity than bare GCN and a further increase in the concentration of NPs resulted in a decrease in the activity due to recombination of charge carriers.
Fu et al. studied the photocatalytic degradation of MO, MB and neutral dark yellow GL (NDY-GL) dyes over a Ag/GCN nanocomposite synthesized using NaBH4 reduction of AgNO3 over GCN.173 The photocatalyst showed the highest photocatalytic activity with the optimized amount of Ag NP (4%) loading under visible light irradiation. It is noteworthy to mention here that the borohydride ions (BH4−) showed remarkable improvement in the activity even under dark conditions. For the degradation of the above-mentioned dyes over the Ag/GCN photocatalyst, superoxide ions (O2−˙) were identified as predominantly active oxidizing species. The separation of charge carriers occurs in GCN under visible light irradiation due to band gap excitation. Subsequently, the electrons from the CB of GCN are transferred to Ag NPs wherein they are trapped by adsorbed oxygen or water molecules to generate superoxide radicals. Further, the adsorbed BH4− ions on the surface of the catalyst are oxidized resulting in more electron generation from oxygen to form additional radicals and thus accelerating the degradation process. In addition, under dark conditions, the observed photocatalytic activity is due to the superoxide radicals generated from the hydrolysis of BH4− ions releasing hydrogen that was oxidized by hydroxide ions.
Recently our group reported an efficient hot electron induced plasmonic photocatalyst, namely Au nanostar (NST) decorated GCN/RGO, for the removal of organic dyes MB and TC under visible light irradiation.37 For the synthesis of the photocatalyst, GCN was protonated by acid to obtain protonated GCN. Subsequently, the mixture of protonated GCN, Au NST and GO was subjected to hydrothermal treatment to form the desired ACG photocatalyst. During the hydrothermal treatment, the GO was in situ reduced to form RGO. The best photocatalytic performance was observed with the ACG2 photocatalyst with 2 wt% of Au NST and GO content for both MB and TC degradation under visible light. A plausible mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation of MB and TC using the Au NST-GCN/RGO photocatalyst under visible light irradiation is presented in Fig. 11a and b. The Au NST plays a dual role, firstly as a cocatalyst where the electrons are transferred from the CB of GCN to the Au NST due to its lower Fermi energy level. Secondly, the addition of Au NST significantly improves the photocatalytic performance due to the generation of hot electrons confirmed from the light intensity dependent degradation study. Furthermore, to get insights about electrochemical and thermal hotspots, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopic and water heating studies were performed.

Deng et al. reported a novel dual Z-scheme plasmonic Ag decorated P doped ultrathin GCN nanosheets/BiVO4 photocatalyst (Ag@GCN/BiVO4) synthesized by using the impregnation process followed by a photoreduction method for the efficient removal of CIP as a targeted contaminant under visible (λ > 420 nm) and near-infrared (λ > 760 nm) light irradiation.174 The prepared hybrid nanocomposite showed 92.6% and 18.1% removal of CIP in 120 min under visible and NIR light, respectively (Fig. 11c and d). Under visible light irradiation, both GCN and BiVO4 can be excited resulting in the separation of charge carriers. Due to the lower Fermi energy level of metallic Ag NPs, they can capture electrons from the CB of BiVO4. Further, the strong SPR effect of metallic Ag NPs establishes an enhanced local electric field that leads to electron transfer to the VB of GCN and their combination with holes via direct electron migration or plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer as shown in Fig. 11e. The remaining electrons in the CB of GCN thus react with dissolved oxygen to generate superoxide radicals (o2˙−), and holes in the VB of BiVO4 possess enough energy to react with adsorbed water molecules to generate hydroxyl radical (OH˙) species. Finally, these highly active species can attack directly on CIP molecules to give mineralized products. Thus, this dual Z-scheme based plasmonic photocatalyst can bring about promoted electron and hole generation simultaneously.
Dong's group discovered that the Bi metal also shows the SPR effect, similar to Ag, Au and Cu, and synthesized a novel Bi sphere doped GCN photocatalyst, which was further used for the efficient removal of NO.175 The diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) investigations revealed that the light harvesting enhanced from UV to NIR region after deposition of the Bi metal on GCN nanosheets. The broad SPR absorption peak of the Bi metal centered at 500 nm was observed and the sample color change was attributed to the charge-transfer transition between the Bi metal and GCN as shown in Fig. 11f. Furthermore, as theoretical evidence for the SPR effect of the Bi metal the simulation of the local electromagnetic field arising from the SPR effect of the Bi metal was performed using rigorous Maxwell's solver based on the finite integration techniques. A significant enhancement of the electromagnetic field under visible light (420 nm) was observed and a 3D view and a 2D cross-section perpendicular to the x, y, and z axes are shown in Fig. 11g. These theoretical investigations have revealed that the maximum intensity of the electromagnetic field near the Bi particle surface is due to its SPR effect, which is responsible for photocatalytic performance.
Zhao and coworkers prepared a series of Pd modified GCN photocatalysts by using a simple mechanical mixing-illumination method and used them for dechlorination activities of 2-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2-CDD), an anthropogenic environmental toxicant.176 Among all the samples the 5 wt% Pd/GCN nanocomposite exhibited the best photocatalytic performance with 54% conversion in 4 h. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the SPR effect of plasmonic Pd NPs and the formation of the Schottky barrier between Pd NPs and GCN which results in enhanced light absorption ability and suppresses the recombination of charge carriers in GCN, respectively. Choudhury and coworkers have revealed the photocatalytic role of Au and Ag decorated over GCN nanosheets for decomposition of RhB under UV (250–380 nm), UV-visible (256–600) and green light (532 nm) illumination.140 The core level X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra for Au-4f (Au/GCN) and Ag-3d (Ag/GCN) are shown in Fig. 12a and b. From XPS studies it was observed that the Au and Ag NPs formed electrostatic binding with nitrogen defect sites on GCN. The additional shoulder peak in Au NPs other than the characteristic peaks was assigned to oxidized Auδ+ species which confirms the presence of Au2O (Au+). The colloidal Au and Ag NPs exhibit a plasmonic absorption band at 526 and 425 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 12c. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of Au/GCN and Ag/GCN under UV, UV-visible and green laser irradiation was compared with that of bare GCN (Fig. 12d). Under UV light illumination, the Au and Ag NPs act as a cocatalyst by capturing the electrons from the CB of GCN nanosheets. Furthermore, under UV-visible light illumination, the plasmonic NPs exhibit the SPR effect by injecting the hot electrons into the CB of GCN triggering the SPR-driven photocatalysis (Fig. 12e and f). The combined effect (plasmonic and band gap excitation) under UV-visible light illumination results in enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of the RhB dye. The to-and-fro transfer of electrons at the metal–semiconductor interface results in increased charge carrier recombination.

Furthermore, Sun et al. synthesized a highly selective Z-scheme Ag/Ag3VO4/GCN molecular imprinted photocatalyst (MIP) for the efficient removal of TC and OTC from wastewater.177 The efficiency of the photocatalyst improved drastically due to the synergistic effect of the Z-scheme heterostructure and the SPR effect of the photoreduced Ag NPs. In addition, the MIP provides the recognition ability to specially adsorb the target molecules. A plausible mechanism was formulated based on the radical scavenger and electron spin resonance experiments that indicated the main active species (O2−˙ and h+) in the degradation process. These investigations suggest that the molecular imprinting method is an effective strategy for improving the photoactivity and selectivity of materials.
The plasmonic effect of metal NPs can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity of GCN based photocatalysts for degradation of organic pollutants. Table 3 shows the summary of various plasmonic mediated GCN based photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emerging as major gas pollutants amid the various indoor air pollutants apart from biological pollutants and particulate matter.246 According to the World Health Organization (WHO) VOCs are defined as all organic compounds with boiling point ranging from 50 to 260 °C except pesticides.247 VOCs cover a wide range of organic compounds starting from alcohols, halocarbons, aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, butyraldehyde, etc.) and aromatic compounds (toluene, benzene, xylene, styrene, paradichlorobenzene, etc.).248,249 Numerous indoor items including furniture, flooring materials, fire-resistant materials, paints, and building materials, as well as natural gas combustion and burning of coal result in the production of VOCs.246 Thus the concentration of VOCs is constantly higher indoors than outdoors.248 VOCs combined with nitrogen oxides are held accountable for the escalating photochemical smog in urban areas.250,251 Exposure to VOCs can contribute to serious health issues and cause acute symptoms like irritations of eyes, throat and nose, and skin allergy and it can also damage the internal organs including kidneys and liver.249 Some of the VOCs may not have immediate effects but can result in chronic health risks.249 While keeping in mind the hazardous effects of VOCs it becomes very important to develop various techniques to treat or at least reduce pollution caused by VOCs.
Out of diverse techniques available for the removal of VOCs, the adsorption/desorption process is considered as an easy, cost effective and efficient technique for treating air polluted with these organic gases.251 For the adsorption process, porosity and high surface area are the two main and very essential factors held responsible for the effective removal of VOCs. Adsorption using carbon based filters for removing gas pollutants is quite popular but this method may also become inefficient if the VOCs are present at the sub-ppm level due to the decrease in their equilibrium adsorption capacity.246 Air cleaning, increasing ventilation rates and source control are some other methods for the removal of VOCs.248 Apart from these methods, photocatalysis is one of the trending techniques to treat indoor air pollutants because it can degrade several air pollutants into CO2 and H2O under ambient conditions.252,253 Out of various photocatalysts available, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely used due to its low cost, strong oxidation power and high chemical stability.246 TiO2 grabs almost two-thirds of the reported articles based on air purification using photocatalysis.246 But the limitation of this material is associated with its absorption power restricted to the UV region (Eg = 3.2 eV); thus it cannot be used efficiently for indoor environments.252 So there is a dire need of photocatalysts that should be visible light active along with the stability factors.254
Apart from TiO2, another popular semiconducting material is graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) which is a metal free polymer and possesses n-type semiconducting properties with the band gap ranging from 2.6 to 2.8 eV.247,255 Although GCN is used often for energy harvesting there is a drawback of low activity towards pollutant degradation.256 The reason behind this moderately low activity of GCN is the low valence band potential of 1.4 NHE which is insufficient for generating hydroxyl radicals.250 In order to conquer this drawback, developing various GCN based heterojunction structures proves to be helpful.249 The use of co-catalysts such as Au, Ag, Pt, etc., which have an SPR effect, deposited on the 2D GCN nanosheets can act as active sites for the redox reactions.252 The integration of plasmonic materials with semiconducting GCN has significantly improved the photocatalytic activity of the material in any one of the possible ways of improving the photocatalyst stability or photocatalytic activity.247 Some of the reports from the literature on plasmonic metal incorporated GCN involving the SPR effect are given and discussed below.
Sun et al. reported a Ag NP decorated GCN for the improved photocatalytic treatment of nitrogen oxide when irradiated under visible light.257 The decorated Ag NPs on the surface of GCN nanosheets enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the prepared Ag/GCN nanocomposite and oxidized NOx to the final product. Different nanocomposites (GCN/Ag-5%, GCN/Ag-10% and GCN/Ag-20%) were prepared using variable amounts of Ag NPs and the prepared nanocomposites were characterized using different techniques including PXRD, UV-vis, PL, XPS, TEM, etc. The morphology of the prepared GCN and Ag/GCN was studied using TEM and it was found that the sub-micrometer sized nanosheets of GCN possessed a 2D structure with stacked sheets (Fig. 13a and b). The nanocomposite 10% Ag/GCN was also claimed to possess a 2D structure along with Ag NPs (size in the range of 8–50 nm) dispersed uniformly on the surface of GCN nanosheets (Fig. 13c and d). Further, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was performed to check the optical properties of the different nanocomposites, and it was found that the Ag nanoparticle decorated GCN showed the same absorption edge as that of pure GCN but with enhanced visible light absorption ability due to the SPR effect shown by the decorated Ag NPs. The high visible light absorption property showcased that the Ag/GCN nanocomposites can absorb more solar energy and produce more photogenerated charge carriers which finally results in enhanced photocatalytic activity. Apart from this, photoluminescence analysis was done to reveal the efficiency of charge carriers, their separation and lifetime. It was observed that the PL intensity of the Ag/GCN nanocomposite was decreased significantly as compared to that of pure GCN and thus implied lower recombination chances of photogenerated charge carriers. The dispersion of Ag NPs on the GCN surface forms an intimate interface which prevents the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. Thus Ag/GCN nanocomposites absorbed more visible light energy and along with the superior photogenerated charge carrier separation resulted in enhanced photocatalytic activity for the oxidation of NOx. The best activity was reported for the GCN/Ag-10% nanocomposite (Fig. 13e) and the mechanism behind this increased activity of Ag nanoparticle decorated GCN as compared to pure GCN was also discussed. It was mentioned that the Fermi level of the Ag metal lies at a lower position than the conduction band of the GCN and the photogenerated electrons would transfer easily from the conduction band of the GCN to Ag NPs and result in proficient separation of charge carriers. The holes in the VB directly oxidized NO whereas electrons in the Fermi level of the Ag NPs reacted with O2 to create active O2˙− that transformed to produce OH˙ which further participated in the photocatalytic oxidation process (Fig. 13f). Thus, the enhanced visible light absorption was contributed by the plasmonic effect of Ag NPs.

Kubacka et al. reported metallic Ag deposited onto a GCN based photocatalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of toluene.252 Metallic Ag was deposited onto GCN at different wt% ranging from 1 to 10 wt% and the resulted composites were tested for the photocatalytic degradation of toluene under sunlight and visible light irradiation. The loaded silver content in the samples was measured using ICP-MS, and TEM was used for the structural analysis of the composite samples (Fig. 13g–j). From TEM images the micrographs of the sample were clearly visible with Ag NPs as darker zones. It was observed that the efficiency for photocatalytic degradation of toluene was highest with 1 wt% loading amount. The quantum efficiency calculations were done for all illumination conditions, and the efficiency was found to be maximum for the 1 wt% Ag/GCN composite sample under both visible and sunlight irradiation (Fig. 13k). The reason behind this exceptional efficiency was attributed to the fact that the excessive amount of silver may behave as the recombination center for the photogenerated electrons and holes. The authors also claimed that the optimum Ag-GCN composite was able to outperform the activity of TiO2 based reference systems under sunlight irradiation. The schematic mechanism explained that the main factor responsible for the enhanced efficiency was the electronic interaction between the components of the material.
Dong et al. reported a bismuth nanosphere (Bi NS) decorated GCN nanohybrid through the in situ deposition technique for enhanced visible light activity towards the removal of NO as compared to GCN alone.258 The thin nanosheets of GCN were utilized as a substrate for the green synthesis of the Bi-g-C3N4 nanojunction having Bi nanosphere incorporated GCN and this nanohybrid was claimed to have enhanced stability and increased visible light activity due to the SPR effect of Bi as seen in previous cases. The growth of Bi nanospheres on the GCN surface was demonstrated to result in enhanced light absorption and extended light harvesting ranging from UV to NIR region because of the charge migration between GCN and Bi NS. The process of polymerization of urea under high temperature was used to prepare GCN and then elemental Bi nanospheres were deposited on the surface of GCN nanosheets with varying mass ratio of Bi to GCN ranging from 15 to 200% and the resultant samples were designated as Bi-GCN-x accordingly. The thin nanosheets of GCN and uniformly dispersed Bi NS on the GCN nanosheets were clearly visible in TEM images (Fig. 14a–d). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance (DRS) of Bi/GCN shows an extensive peak around 500 nm corresponding to the distinctive SPR peak of Bi which intensifies with increasing Bi content from 15 to 200% (Fig. 14e). Moreover, the DMPO-ESR analysis (Fig. 14f) showed that more O2−˙ radicals were generated after incorporation of Bi NPs on GCN nanosheets and generation of OH˙ was inhibited. The photocatalytic activity was found to be superior in the case of Bi-CN-25 as compared to other Bi-CN composites and pure GCN as well (Fig. 14g). Similar to previous cases, transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of GCN to the Bi metal took place due to the reason that the position of the CB of GCN tends to be more negative than that of the Fermi level of the Bi metal (Fig. 14h). The electrons then form O2˙− radicals by reacting with O2 on the Bi metal surface and these photogenerated electrons also react with O2 to form OH˙ via the production of H2O2. These reactive species (O2˙ radicals) then oxidize NO to HNO2/HNO3 (final products) and the photogenerated holes present in the VB of GCN along with OH˙ radicals also oxidize NO to HNO2/HNO3.

Another study was reported by Kangle et al. where the authors prepared a pure metallic Bi incorporated GCN composite (Bi-CN) using in situ grafting treatment and the resulted composite adopted a pomegranate like structure.259 The prepared Bi-CN composite was explored for the photo-oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) in the visible light spectrum. The incorporated Bi metal in the GCN layers effectively enhanced the light absorption of the composite from UV to NIR region owing to the SPR effect of the Bi metal. The morphological analysis by using SEM displayed spherical particles of the Bi metal (Fig. 14i) with a diameter of approx. 1 μm and homogeneously dispersed spheres of metallic Bi within the thick GCN layers (Fig. 14j) with a diameter of around 300 nm. The reason behind the decreased size of Bi metal spheres incorporated in GCN layers as compared to free Bi metal particles was assigned to the grain boundary size effect of GCN during synthesis via the solvothermal process. Along with the strong light absorption, the other important factor examined was the effectual photogenerated charge carrier separation in the prepared composite through PL measurements. The effective quenching of the PL emission peak was observed in the Bi-CN composite upon introducing the Bi metal. The reason behind this quenching was ascribed to the unidirectional migration of the electrons from the CB (conduction band) of GCN to the Bi metal due to Bi metal's Mott-Schottky effect (Fig. 14k). Concurrently the holes collected in the VB of GCN had strong oxidizing power to degrade NO. The dispersed Bi metal over the GCN surface effectively hindered the photogenerated charge carrier recombination which in turn enhanced the photo-oxidation of NO with improved visible light activity. Thus, the two factors held responsible for the enhanced activity of Bi-CN were ascribed to the enhanced photo-absorption of Bi-CN due to the SPR effect of the Bi metal and inhibited recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Further, the catalytic stability was tested by using the 10% Bi-CN composite for the photo-oxidation process in the visible light spectrum up to five consecutive cycles and the activity was reported to be nearly the same even after five cycles (Fig. 14l). The strong interaction between GCN and pure metallic Bi was responsible for the tremendous stability of the prepared composite and the Bi-CN composite can be a promising candidate for practical applications of air purification.
Jiang et al. reported monodispersed Bi based GCN composites designed by a size-controlled synthesis method of Bi NPs in organic colloidal solution and subsequently dispersed on the GCN surface.260 The construction of the Bi decorated GCN (Bi/GCN) heterojunction resulted in enhanced photocatalytic activity for the removal of NO due to the heterojunction and SPR effects as both these effects can enhance the separation of photogenerated charge carriers in GCN. In addition, the specific control of the SPR intensity and heterojunction effect was made by tuning the size of the Bi NPs and thus the contribution of each effect was optimized and identified for the enhanced activity. The prepared composite (Bi/GCN) with Bi NPs of diameter 12 nm was observed to achieve tremendous efficiency for NO removal (60.8%) which was superior to that of pure GCN (38.6%) and Bi/GCN composites with large- or small-sized Bi NPs. The large-sized Bi NPs can make only a few numbers of heterojunctions which results in a poor heterojunction effect. The mechanism behind the increased photocatalytic activity can be described in terms of the enhanced O2˙− radical generation due to the incorporated Bi NPs which ultimately triggered OH˙ radical formation. The authors explained well how the strategy of size control of Bi NPs can tune the synergistic SPR and heterojunction effects in Bi/GCN composites and this generalization could help further to design cost-effective and highly efficient photocatalysts for the removal of air pollutants.
5.2 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) pollutant degradation
Photoelectrocatalytic pollutant degradation is a rapidly growing research field as it can solve huge engineering challenges related to conversion of solar energy for wastewater treatment261,262 and the water splitting process.263,264 During the photocatalysis process, the light photons result in the separation of the charge carriers in a semiconductor by exciting the electrons from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band. However, in photoelectrocatalysis, an external electrical circuit helps in the separation of the photoinduced charge carriers when a constant bias is applied.262,265 GCN comes out as a promising photo-anodic material due to wide absorption of light and appropriate positions of band edges. However, the photoelectrocatalytic performance of GCN can be further improved by modifying it with a dopant or by adding a co-catalyst.
Huang and coworkers266 used the photo-assisted reduction method to synthesize a highly mesoporous GCN/Ag (mpg-GCN/Ag) plasmonic photocatalyst with improved photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic properties for the removal of MB under visible light irradiation. A series of photocatalysts were synthesized by varying the amount of Ag and it was observed that 3 wt% Ag in mpg-GCN shows almost 3 times higher activity than mpg-GCN. Also, the limit current density was enhanced twice with modified Ag NPs compared to that of the pristine mpg-GCN. The enhancement in the activity was deeply investigated by using first principles density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the band structure and density of state in the nanocomposite. The investigations show that the N-2p orbital occupies the VB and the C-2p/N-2p hybrid orbitals occupy the CB. After modification with Ag NPs, the impurity level Ag-5s that appears in the forbidden region of mpg-GCN improves its electronic transitions by reducing the energy gap. Furthermore, due to the SPR effect of Ag NPs, the localized surface electromagnetic wave along the cross-section of Ag NPs and mpg-GCN and the local resonance result in the near field electromagnetic enhancement beneficial for separation of charge carriers. The external circuit moves the photogenerated electrons towards the Pt electrodes rapidly thereby improving the photocatalytic efficiency under visible light irradiation. The optimized amount of Ag NPs in the nanocomposite would cause the SPR effect that improves the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties of the mpg-GCN/Ag nanocomposite.
Similarly, in another work Chang and coworkers144 designed a catalyst comprising of Au NPs decorated over GCN nanosheets for improved photoelectrocatalytic activities. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and particle size distribution curves show that Au NPs of 15.3 nm average grain diameter are homogeneously distributed on GCN nanosheets (Fig. 15a and b). Furthermore, the investigation of the crystallographic structure of Au NPs/GCN nanosheets was done using X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. 15c. Two deconvoluted peaks of Au NPs at 84.7 eV and 88.4 eV correspond to the Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 orbitals, respectively, confirming the presence of Au NPs in their metallic state (Fig. 15d). A negative shift of 0.3 eV in the binding energy of the Au/GCN nanocomposite as compared to pure Au NPs corresponds to the difference between the work function of Au NPs and GCN nanosheets confirming the successful synthesis of the nanocomposite. The enhanced activity of the photoelectrocatalyst was attributed to the combination of the photoelectric effect of the GCN nanosheet, the diffusion current drifting effect due to the built-in electric field at the Schottky junction of Au NPs and GCN, and the SPR induced hot-electron injection effect of plasmonic Au NPs. Thus, the plasmonic Au/GCN nanocomposite shows excellent photocatalytic as well as electrocatalytic properties due to the visible light active SPR enhanced transition metal electrode and UV light active pure GCN.

In another work, Bharath and coworkers268 synthesized a ternary nanocomposite of TiO2/RGO decorated with plasmonic Ag NPs (Ag-TiO2/RGO) using a facile hydrothermal route. Furthermore, the as-synthesized nanocomposite was used for the efficient photoelectrocatalytic removal of organic pollutants and CO2 reduction under UV-visible light irradiation. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigations revealed a high photocurrent density of 23.5 mA cm−2 and a lower electrode resistance of 125 Ω in a CO2-saturated 1.0 M KOH-aqueous electrolyte solution using the Ag-TiO2/RGO photocathode. The catalytic investigations proved that the Ag-TiO2/RGO photocathode possesses an outstanding photoelectrochemical property due to the synergistic effect of semiconducting, plasmonic and carbanion properties.
Like Ag and Au NPs, Bi NPs also possess plasmonic properties which help in the absorption of visible light. The excitation of free electrons in Bi NPs results in a strong SPR effect that causes enhanced light absorption.269,270 Wang and coworkers267 designed a high-performance Bi-doped ultrathin polymeric carbon nitride (Bi/GCN) nanocomposite using a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis route. It was observed that the PEC signal of the Bi/GCN nanocomposite was 2, 6 and 24 times higher than that of the porous GCN, GCN and pristine Bi NPs, respectively, which can be ascribed to the SPR effect and the carbon vacancies in the samples. The SPR effect of the Bi NPs boosted the absorption of visible light photons and the intermediate energy states generated due to the carbon vacancies enhance the separation of charge carriers thereby contributing towards improved PEC performance.
Furthermore, the TEM measurements show that the Bi NPs are of hollow spherical morphology with a diameter of 100–150 nm and are well dispersed over the thinner sheet structure of porous GCN as shown in Fig. 15e. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry (DRS) was used to analyze the optical absorption properties of Bi NPs, GCN, porous GCN and the Bi/porous GCN nanocomposite (Fig. 15f). The pure metallic Bi NPs exhibit the absorption range from 200 nm to 800 nm with the SPR peak at 510 nm. A well-defined red shift was observed (from 460 nm to 600 nm) in porous GCN nanosheets as compared to GCN nanosheets indicating the increased absorption of visible light. Furthermore, Fig. 15g demonstrates the detailed mechanism of detection of enrofloxacin (ENR) in the concentration range of 10−5 to 103 mg mL−1, with a limit of detection of 3.3 × 10−6 mg mL−1. Under visible light irradiation, the photogenerated holes in the nanocomposite oxidize ENR which prevents the recombination of charge carriers and thereby enhances the photocurrent response.
In another work, Li and coworkers271 also synthesized a Bi microspheres/carbon nitride (Bi/GCN) heterojunction using a hydrothermal route and used it to determine BPA in water. The PEC performance of the Bi/GCN nanocomposite was ascribed to the construction of heterojunctions between Bi microspheres and GCN nanosheets and to the SPR effect of the Bi microspheres. The metal–semiconductor heterojunction results in the generation of more charge carriers and accelerates their separation. At the same time, the plasmonic Bi microspheres increase the absorption of visible light photons and the accelerated charge transfer at the heterojunction resulting in enhanced PEC performance.
6. Plasmon mediated GCN for organic reactions
6.1 Photocatalytic organic reactions
The development of a sustainable energy process is required for the decrement of the various harmful processes followed in several chemical industries.272,273 The solution to this problem is the usage of sunlight as a rich source of energy which has the true potential for various organic transformation processes which will be completely green in nature. The usage of a light source will favor room temperature chemical synthesis, avoid side reactions and also decrease the overall cost of the process.274 One of the solid semiconductors suitable for photocatalytic organic transformation is GCN which is easy to synthesize and low cost, having a band gap of 2.7 eV.275,276 It is comprised of two dimensional stacked nanosheets having nitrogen atoms present in the ring structure and on the terminal edges having free lone pair of electron.27 In combination with the GCN as a semiconductor, the presence of plasmonic metal NPs on its surface accelerates the rate of organic transformation. Plasmonic metal NPs interact strongly with electromagnetic radiation through localized surface plasmon resonance. Due to the interactions between light and matter, elevation in the electric fields happens on the surface of the NPs. This elevation in the electric field accelerates the formation of electron–hole pairs which finally increases the rate of organic transformation by localized heating of the NPs.277 So, plasmonic materials present on GCN is a great combination for the photocatalytic transformation of organic reactions. In this section, we will be discussing various types of organic transformations with different plasmonic metal NPs loaded on the GCN nanosheets in the presence of a light source.

6.1.1 Reduction reactions. 
Selective reduction is a difficult task in the modern chemical industry. It needs high energy in the form of temperature and pressure.278 Fortunately, the usage of a light source and a suitable semiconductor material makes this process low cost and sustainable in nature. We will discuss various reduction reactions using plasmon mediated GCN as the catalyst.
Verma et al. fabricated AgPd@GCN as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the hydrogenation of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin) with the help of formic acid as a hydrogen source under visible light irradiation.279 Vanillin is the most common component present in lignin that can be used as a precursor for the synthesis of 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, a beneficial future biofuel.280 The addition of Ag and Pd NPs on the surface of GCN increases the surface area by 300% and also the NPs are completely sandwiched in the GCN nanosheets which ultimately enhances the adsorption of visible light. Due to the lack of hydrophilicity and interactions with vanillin, palladium supported on carbon (Pd@C) offers only a trace amount of the desired product. Changing the Pd support from carbon to graphene oxide (GO) increases the hydrophilic nature of the catalyst but still the yield obtained is less. Further, N doped graphene was chosen as a support for Pd NPs, but still the yield was not improved. Bimetallic catalysts Cu-Pd and Ag-Pd were prepared on GO as a support which further improved the yield but not in a significant way. The authors changed the support from GO to photoactive GCN and tried several bimetallic catalysts under visible light irradiation. Ag-Pd@GCN turned out to be the best catalyst for the conversion of vanillin to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol. The main reason behind the improved catalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of Ag and Pd which also accelerated the decomposition of formic acid to produce hydrogen gas. The recyclability of the photocatalyst was investigated for up to ten cycles and no change in the activity of the catalyst was observed. After the recyclability study, the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis was performed and no leaching of the plasmonic NP was found due to the strong non-covalent interactions between the NP and the support. Most of the reports used elevated temperature and pressure for the conversion of vanillin to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol and also side products like 4-hydroxymethyl-2-methoxyphenol were obtained which decreases the overall production of the desired product. Therefore, photocatalytic plasmonic catalysis is preferred over thermo-catalysis.
Ag NP decorated GCN (Ag/GCN) was synthesized for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) and its catalytic activity under dark, room light and xenon light conditions was compared by Wang and co-workers.183 4-Aminophenol is used as a precursor for the synthesis of paracetamol, antipyretic analgesic drugs, sulfur dyes, antioxidants, etc.281 Different percentage of Ag was decorated on GCN layers and it was found that Ag/GCN-10 shows the best catalytic activity. The catalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP with Ag/GCN-10 in the presence of NaBH4 was performed under the irradiation of a xenon lamp without (C4) and with a 420 nm cut-off filter (C3), under the irradiation of room light (C2) and in dark conditions (C1). The reduction rate was calculated for all conditions and it turned out that the reduction rate was higher in the presence of light in comparison to the dark conditions and it was as follows: kappC4 > kappC3 > kappC2 > kappC1 as shown in Fig. 16a and b. The synergistic effect of Ag NPs and the good contact between Ag NPs and GCN nanosheets enhanced the interfacial charge transfer and also decreased the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed for GCN and Ag/GCN-10 under dark and light conditions and it proved that the Ag/GCN-10 nanocomposite shows more transfer of charge between the Ag NP and the GCN lamellar structure which delays the recombination of electron–hole pairs and enhances the photocatalytic activity of the composite. The possible mechanism for the catalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP under dark and light conditions is as follows. In dark conditions, BH4− transfers electrons to the Ag NP which are further passed to GCN through the interfacial contact of the Ag/GCN composite. Finally, the adsorbed 4-NP on the surface of the composite accepts the electrons and is reduced to the desired product. On the other hand, in the presence of visible light, photoinduced electrons are also present which are immediately transferred to the Ag NP from GCN and decrease the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. The increased catalytic activity under visible light irradiation is due to the combination of photoinduced electrons and electrons donated by BH4−.

Dong et al. recently reported the plasmonic photocatalyst of Pd supported on GCN for the photocatalytic hydrogenation of various aldehydes to their respective alcohols in the presence of formic acid (HCOOH) and triethylamine (TEA) as the proton source and sacrificial electron donor, respectively.284 With Pd/GCN, furfuryl alcohol was formed with a yield of 27% from furfural in the presence of HCOOH and TEA in 6 h. The control reactions were also performed with only GCN, under dark conditions and in the absence of TEA-HCOOH, which resulted in the negligible formation of furfuryl alcohol, which clearly indicates that Pd/GCN and TEA-HCOOH play a synergistic role in the hydrogenation reaction. The presence of Pd NPs on the surface of GCN improves the absorption of visible light which enhances the hydrogenation of furfural. The authors further replaced the Pd NPs with Pt NPs on the surface of GCN which resulted in the negligible formation of furfuryl alcohol. The addition of rare earth element La (lanthanum) in Pd/GCN increases the conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. The doping of rare earth elements causes a red shift in the absorption spectra which leads to better catalytic activity. The hydrogenation of various aldehydes like 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, benzaldehyde, etc. was further done with Pd/GCN which resulted in the formation of valuable products. A decrease in the formation of furfuryl alcohol was observed after five cycles in the recyclability study. The major reason for this decrease is the agglomeration of Pd NPs which suppresses the interaction between the reactant and the active sites of the catalyst.
The hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfuran (HMF) results in two possible products, 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) and 2,5-di-hydroxy-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (DHMTHF).285 Guo and coworkers prepared platinum decorated graphitic carbon nitride (Pt/GCN) for the photocatalytic reduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran in the presence of visible light.286 DHMF was formed selectively from HMF by the usage of Pt/GCN with a yield and turnover frequency (TOF) of 4.5% and 0.32 h−1, respectively, in an aqueous medium with triethylamine (TEA) as a sacrificial electron donor in the presence of visible light. Under 80 °C temperature and visible light conditions, the yield of DHMF was increased to 6.5%. Pt/GCN resulted in the DHMF product with a selectivity of more than 90%. The further reduction of DHMF to DHMTHF was not observed with the Pt/GCN catalyst under visible light irradiation. Mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpGCN) was prepared by the authors for better structural and electronic properties. Under the same reaction conditions, Pt/mpGCN gave less yield of DHMF in comparison with Pt/GCN. Pt/GCN absorbed more visible light than Pt/mpGCN which eventually enhanced the catalytic activity of Pt/GCN. The role of Pt NPs is that they accept the electrons from the conduction band of GCN; therefore the regular dispersion of NPs favors the active transfer of electrons. A decrease in the yield and TOF values has been observed with the increase in the loading of Pt NPs beyond 2.0 wt% on the GCN support.
Kumar and coworkers synthesized nickel decorated phosphorus doped GCN (Ni@g-PC3N4) for the reduction of various nitrobenzenes to their corresponding anilines in the presence of visible light as shown in Fig. 16c.282 The optimization reaction to obtain the best possible yield was performed with nitrobenzene as the model reactant using hydrazine monohydrate as a source of protons. Different percentage of nickel was decorated on g-PC3N4 nanocomposites, i.e., 2%, 5% and 7.5%. The percentage yields of aniline synthesized from nitrobenzene were 82%, 96.5% and 97% from 2% Ni@g-PC3N4, 5% Ni@g-PC3N4, and 7.5% Ni@g-PC3N4, respectively, under the same reaction conditions. With Ni NPs, g-C3N4 and g-PC3N4, the yields obtained were 0%, 24.6% and 54.2%, respectively. Doping of P in g-C3N4 increases the absorption of visible light in comparison with g-C3N4 which eventually increases the yield of aniline. The decoration of nickel NPs on the surface of g-PC3N4 causes an increment in the rate of reaction and also the yield of aniline. Nickel NPs act as an electron sink which accept the electrons from the conduction band of g-PC3N4, which leads to the reduction of recombination of electron–hole pairs due to the unavailability of electrons required for recombination, which finally increases the catalytic activity of the catalyst. The nanocomposite with 5 wt% nickel NPs showed the best catalytic performance. The conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline was not possible in the dark conditions with g-C3N4, g-PC3N4, and Ni@g-PC3N4. The reduction of different substituted nitrobenzene was further done with the best catalyst, i.e., 5% Ni@g-PC3N4, and the results proved that the yield of the product does not rely on the substitution effect on the reactants. The recyclability of the photocatalyst was investigated for up to five cycles and no change in the activity of the catalyst was observed. The yield of aniline remained constant even after five cycles. After five cycles, the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis was performed which confirmed that the percentage of nickel remains the same after the recyclability study and no leaching was detected.
Varma et al. prepared the bimetallic AgPd catalyst supported on the surface of graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) and applied this catalyst for the synthesis of gamma valerolactone (GVL) from levulinic acid (LA) in the presence of visible light.287 GVL is an important chemical that can be synthesized from biomass derived chemicals and it is used in the formation of anticancer drugs, antihypertensive drugs, and insecticides and also as a green solvent.288,289 The hydrogenation of LA to GVL was performed in the presence of formic acid as a hydrogen source under visible light. The loading of different percentage of Pd on GCN nanosheets resulted in a low yield of GVL. Therefore, silver metal NPs were chosen along with Pd to increase the conversion of LA to GVL. The highest yield of 98% of GVL was formed with 5%Ag:5%Pd-GCN. Without visible light and with only silver metal, no formation of GVL was found which confirms that Ag does not play the role of a catalyst but acts as a catalyst promoter. The recyclability test was carried out and it turned out that AgPd@GCN shows stability up to five cycles.


6.1.2 Oxidation reactions. 
Varma et al. prepared Pd@GCN for the oxidative esterification of various alcohols and photocatalytic C–H activation in the presence of air.290 GCN is a photoactive catalyst and is an electron-rich nitrogenous material which acts as a chromophore material. The loading of Pd on GCN enhanced the absorption of visible light and thus decreased the activation barrier required for the esterification of alcohols. Initially, Pd@GCN was used for the oxidative esterification of benzyl alcohol as a model reaction in methanol under the irradiation of visible light using air as an oxygen source. As the loading of Pd on GCN was increased from 1% to 4%, the yield of methyl benzoate increased from 47% to 87%. The highest yield of methyl benzoate, i.e., 96%, was obtained with 5% loading of Pd on GCN. A further increase in Pd loading did not affect the conversion of benzyl alcohol to methyl benzoate, which confirms that 5% Pd@GCN shows the best catalytic activity. As the catalyst amount was increased from 5 mg to 10 mg, the yield of methyl benzoate increased from 78% to 96%. A further increase in the catalyst amount up to 20 mg did not affect the yield of methyl benzoate. Different aromatic alcohols were subjected to the oxidative esterification process with the best optimized conditions as shown in Table 4. The various alcohols contained different electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents and none of them showed any significant change in the reactivity and yield of the product. The recyclability of the photocatalyst was tested up to five cycles and no change in the activity of the catalyst was observed. The best part of this reaction is the usage of the aerial oxygen as a co-oxidant which is consumed by Pd@GCN and used for the activation of C–H and finally for the oxidative esterification.

Lima et al. synthesized various metal-supported GCN catalysts and used them as photocatalysts for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAL)291 as benzaldehyde is an important chemical used in agricultural, pharmaceutical, and other industries and its synthesis route is from the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. The authors prepared various NPs like Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru, and Rh NPs and decorated them on GCN and also on the commercial support P25 TiO2. The catalytic activity of different metal NPs supported on semiconductors depends on various factors like type of semiconductor, type, size and dispersion of NPs, etc. The yield of BAL obtained with bare GCN and Au/GCN was 35% and 60%, respectively. The oxidation of BA to BAL under visible light irradiation happens with the adsorption of BA on the surface of the photocatalyst in water as a reaction medium. Photogenerated holes are formed which induce deprotonation of BA, resulting in the formation of a carbon radical. One more electron is transported from the BA radical to the semiconductor which finally leads to the formation of BAL with the production of one hydrogen molecule.
It is a tough task to oxidize alkanes as the C–H bond is inert, so it is very challenging to oxidize different alkanes and prepare valuable products.292 Among various alkanes, oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol is attractive because these products are used as intermediates for the synthesis of nylon 6 and nylon 66.293 Kang and co-workers synthesized a gold NP decorated GCN (GCN/Au) composite for the total green oxidation of cyclohexane to selectively cyclohexanone without using any initiators and oxidizers under visible light irradiation.294 With GCN/Au, the oxidation of cyclohexane leads to the formation of a single product, i.e., cyclohexanone, with 100% selectivity, and 10.54% conversion efficiency was observed after 24 h of reaction time. Usually, H2O2 is added to the oxidation reactions for the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) which ultimately helps in the oxidation process. The authors have claimed that with the GCN/Au composite, H2O2 is formed in the reaction mixture and they detected it with UV-Vis spectroscopy by using o-toluidine as an indicator. Initially, the production rate of H2O2 is 34.5 μmol h−1 but with time the production of H2O2 decreases because it degrades the photocatalyst which further confirms that GCN catalyzes the oxidation of water to form H2O2 by the water oxidation process under visible light irradiation. After confirming the formation of H2O2, electrochemical tests and spin-trapping electron spin resonance (ESR) were performed for proving the decomposition of H2O2 and to confirm the formation of OH˙ as an active species, respectively, in the presence of GCN/Au for the photocatalytic oxidation process. The reactive species trapping experiment was performed which confirmed that the active species in this oxidation process is OH˙, not O2−˙ and hole scavengers. The SPR effect of the Au present on the GCN nanosheets was tested at different wavelengths of light and the best activity was observed at 500 nm which resonated with the SPR of Au NPs, i.e., near 500 nm. The same catalyst was used for the photocatalytic oxidation of cyclooctene to epoxycyclooctane under the best possible conditions which resulted in a conversion and selectivity up to 32.41% and 94.4%, respectively. The recyclability of the photocatalyst was investigated for up to five cycles and a very slight change in the yield of the product was observed.
Kailasam and co-workers have reported Pt loading on the surface of graphitic carbon nitride (SGCN) and performed photocatalytic oxidation of 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF).295 Also, simultaneous production of H2 takes place by the water splitting process in natural sunlight. As SGCN is stable under all pH conditions and also it has a low optical band gap, it is a suitable semiconductor in which the position of the valence band is responsible for the oxidation of the –OH group to the –CHO group and the conduction band is responsible for the production of H2 gas.1 With triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent, the bare SGCN shows exceptional catalytic activity based on the evolution of H2 with a rate of 31 μmol h−1 m−2. The replacement of TEOA with HMF leads to a decrease in the formation of H2 gas due to the less electron-donating capacity of HMF than that of TEOA. But the best part of this replacement is the simultaneous oxidation of HMF to DFF with >99% selectivity. In the absence of visible light and with bare SGCN, no formation of DFF was observed. The time studies for the Pt supported SGCN photocatalyst were performed and the production of H2 and oxidation of HMF to DFF were found to increase with the increase of time from 6 h to 48 h. Overall, the holes formed in the valence band due to irradiation of visible light are responsible for the formation of DFF from HMF and the electrons present in the conduction band reduce water to H2 with the help of Pt present on the SGCN.


6.1.3 Other reactions. 
Krishnan and group have developed an efficient heterogeneous catalyst which comprises Au nanostars (Au NST) supported on the surface of graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) for the photocatalytic environmental remediation and organic reaction application.37 The 2D GCN has a narrow band gap and exhibits fast electron–hole recombination which limits its photocatalytic activity; therefore, the combination of GCN with RGO increases the mobility of electrons within the nanocomposites and also increases the overall surface area of the nanocomposites.296,297 The Au NST in combination with the semiconductor material enhanced the photocatalytic phenomenon because it shows surface plasmon resonance (SPR), direct hot electron transfer (HET), near field electromagnetic enhancement and plasmon resonant energy transfer.298 All the three components, i.e., Au NST, GCN and RGO, together improve the surface area and electron transfer and decrease the electron–hole recombination due to the formation of heterojunctions between them which makes these nanocomposites better for the photocatalytic activity. The 2.0 wt% Au nanocomposite, i.e., ACG2 photocatalyst, has been used for the synthesis of benzimidazoles, which are used in various antifungal, anticancer, and antiviral drugs. The photocatalytic reaction between o-phenylenediamine and benzaldehyde was chosen as a model reaction under visible light irradiation in the presence of an oxygen atmosphere and tert-butyl as a reaction medium. The highest yield obtained was 90% with 10 wt% ACG2 in 6 h of reaction time. The green metrics calculations have been performed by the authors for the model reaction. A high atom economy up to 91% was obtained and a low environmental factor of 0.16 was calculated which clearly shows that the reaction is sustainable in nature and the conditions are favorable for industrial use. Different substituted diamines and aldehydes were subjected to the coupling reaction with the best optimized conditions as shown in Table 5. The various diamines and aldehydes contain different electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents and none of them show any significant change in the reactivity and yield of the product.

The plausible reaction mechanism was proposed for the model reaction as shown in Fig. 16d and it mainly comprises of the formation of an imine intermediate, radicals and their cyclization and in the last oxidation of the cyclic intermediate in the presence of an oxygen atmosphere. The recyclability of the photocatalyst was investigated for up to five cycles and a slight change in the yield of the product was observed.
Verma et al. fabricated GCN with various single metal and bimetallic NPs supported on the surface and used it as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol via activation of the C–H activation bond with visible light.283 Phenol is an important precursor for the formation of dyes, antiseptic and phenolic resins, etc., and globally its production was 6.6 megatons in the year 2000.299 With the loading of single metal NPs like iron, palladium, silver, nickel and copper on the surface of GCN, a low yield of phenol was observed with H2O2 under visible light. The formation of different bimetallic catalysts with the combination of Fe with Cu, Ag, Pd and Ni led to the low conversion of benzene to phenol with FeAg@GCN and FeNi@GCN, but FePd@GCN and FeCu@GCN showed yields up to 70% and 67%, respectively. Other bimetallic combinations like PdCu@GCN, PdNi@GCN, PdAg@GCN and CuAg@GCN were tried for the same reaction and CuAg@GCN turned out to be the best photocatalyst. Various optimization reactions by varying the catalyst amount, time and solvents were performed with CuAg@GCN and the yield of 99% of phenol was obtained with both acetonitrile and ethanol in 30 min. In the presence of visible light, the hydroxyl radical was formed on the bimetallic photoactive catalyst from the decomposition of H2O2. The reactant molecules adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst via non-covalent interactions and activation of the C–H bond of the benzene ring took place with the help of CuAg@GCN and finally led to the formation of phenol. The schematic representation of the mechanism for the hydroxylation of benzene with CuAg@GCN is shown in Fig. 16e. The recyclability study was done with CuAg@GCN up to five cycles and no leaching of the metal was obtained from ICP-AES analysis which proves that the GCN nanosheets tightly hold copper and silver by non-covalent interactions.
Park and co-workers prepared CuPd bimetallic alloys uniformly coated on the surface of holey GCN (HCN) for the production of phenol from the hydroxylation of benzene300 HCN was prepared by the pretreatment of GCN with KOH which helps in the uniform distribution of metal NPs. Different percentage of CuPd was loaded on HCN and HCN-5 showed the highest selectivity of 89.6% and conversion of 98.1% for the production of phenol from benzene under visible light irradiation. The recyclability test was performed up to five cycles and the stability of the recycled catalyst was proved by XRD and XPS. Further, PL spectra proved that HCN-5 showed the best photocatalytic activity and the ESR result showed that the O2−˙ and OH˙ species are responsible for the conversion of benzene to phenol with HCN-5. The proposed mechanism for the selective conversion of benzene to phenol with HCN-5 is shown in Fig. 17a. In the absence of CuPd alloy particles, the combination of electron–hole pairs is very fast which clearly confirms that the SPR effect of the CuPd alloy particles is responsible for the hydroxylation of benzene to phenol.

6.2 Photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules
Photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules over metal–semiconductor nanocomposites has attracted significant attention due to their potential applications.303,304 The synergistic effects of photoelectrocatalysts promote the separation of charge carriers and improve the photoelectrocatalytic performance.305 In an interesting work highly efficient Au NP loaded GCN (Au/GCN) nanocomposites were synthesized using a citrate reduction method.301 In this report different Au/GCN nanocomposites with different percentage of Au loading from 20 wt% to 90 wt% were synthesized and their catalytic potential was examined in photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of small organic molecules. Fig. 17 shows the influence of different Au loading percentage on the current density of formic acid (HCOOH) in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. From Fig. 17b it is evident that different loading of Au NPs did not affect the oxidation peak potential of formic acid. Fig. 17c shows that the peak current density varies with the increased percentage of Au NPs. It follows the order 20 wt% < 50 wt% < 60 wt% < 90 wt% < 70 wt% < 80 wt%, which can be attributed to the increased active sites with the increase in Au loading. However, excess loading of Au NPs results in the aggregation of nanocomposites which decreases the charge separation efficiency, hence decreasing the photoelectrocatalytic efficiency.
The Au/GCN nanocomposites exhibited excellent photoelectrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of formic acid and other small organic molecules like ethanol which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of GCN nanosheets and Au NPs which facilitates the effective separation of charge carriers and interfacial charge transfer. The Au/GCN nanocomposites lowers the oxidation potential and increases the oxidation current which effectively diminishes the surface poisoning species. Cheng et al. reported a ternary nanocomposite of N doped GCN nanosheets, Ketjen Black (KB) and Pt NPs (Pt/GCN/KB) for the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of methanol.306 The Pt/GCN/KB nanocomposite showed 2 times higher catalytic activity than the Pt/KB catalyst. Under light irradiation, the catalytic potential of the Pt/GCN/KB nanocomposite was enhanced 1.6 times. The slower decay of methanol oxidation current density under light irradiation was observed in chronoamperometric curves which indicates that the presence of light promotes the CO oxidation reaction. The enhanced photoelectrocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the ternary components. The photoactive N-GCN helps in light absorption to generate photo-induced charge carriers which help in carrying out the oxidation process. In another report, Pieta and coworkers reported highly active anode materials comprising of Ni, Cu and Cu-Ni nanocomposites decorated over 2-D GCN nanosheets.307 The desired catalysts were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method and their catalytic potential was examined in photoelectrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction. It was observed that under visible light irradiation Cu-Ni/GCN electrocatalysts exhibited 2.7 times higher catalytic performance as compared to dark conditions. This work suggests that the rational design of hierarchical nanostructures can result in high photoelectrocatalytic activity.
In another report, Pt-Au/GCN nanocomposites were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method wherein GCN nanosheets were decorated with 3-D Pt islands anchored on Au nanoarchitectures.302 The as-synthesized Pt-Au/GCN nanocomposites were utilized as the working electrode for light accelerated electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reactions. It was observed that the Pt-Au/GCN electrode demonstrated 13.8 times enhanced catalytic activity as compared to the bare Pt/GCN electrode. In contrast, in the presence of light, the electrocatalytic activity of Pt-Au/GCN was increased 1.7 times. The process of catalytic methanol oxidation was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Pt-Au/GCN at different potentials in the absence and presence of light. Fig. 17d shows that with the increase in the potential, the semicircle arc diameter (DSA) was decreased which can be attributed to the formation of intermediate species. In Fig. 17e, it is observed that with the increase in the potential from −0.40 to −0.15, the DSA was increased which can be ascribed to the poisoning of the catalyst surface by Co intermediates. The arcs show positive DSA and large DSA which is due to decreased active sites. In the presence of light (Fig. 17f and g) a similar trend was observed with smaller DSA. From these results, it can be concluded that in the presence of light the interfacial charge transfer efficiency is enhanced which results in higher photoelectrocatalytic activity.
The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the following reasons: (i) the 3-D Pt islands provide active sites for methanol oxidation reaction, (ii) GCN nanosheets provide a large surface area for the effective adsorption of reacting molecules, (iii) the bimetallic effects of Au and Pt enhance the stability and activity, and (iv) both photo and electrocatalytic performances contribute towards the enhanced activity for the methanol oxidation reaction.
7. Summary and future perspectives
In summary, plasmon mediated GCN based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts have been extensively exploited to achieve higher performance for energy conversion, environmental remediation and organic transformation applications. The introduction of plasmonic materials in a minute quantity in GCN has been proven to be an efficient strategy to enhance light absorption and charge separation and for tailoring catalytic sites in the resulting materials. The progress in the development of GCN based plasmonic photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts has resulted in the ironic knowledge for their smart design, characterization and utilization for various applications (Fig. 18). Plasmon mediated GCN based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts have emerged as fascinating materials, by exploiting some of the attractive properties such as enhanced visible light response, environmental friendliness, high oxidation potential, excellent chemical and thermal stability, facile synthesis from easily available precursors and easy modification of properties due to the flexible polymeric structure of GCN. In this journey, the enhancement in the photocatalytic performance of GCN based plasmonic materials has been recognized by the following important factors: (i) efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated charges (suppression of electron–hole recombination), (ii) enhanced light absorption in the visible region (harvesting of a major portion of the solar spectrum) and (iii) tailoring of active sites over the surface of GCN (enhanced surface area and catalytic site engineering). Despite tremendous efforts invested in this field, still there is room for more advancements to take the lab-scale research toward large-scale applications.
 Fig. 18  Advantages and properties of plasmon mediated graphitic carbon nitride photocatalysts and their use for various applications. 
Therefore, it can be anticipated that GCN based plasmonic photocatalysts will be explored in more detail in the upcoming decade. In this context, the following points are very important and must be considered while working in the field of GCN based plasmonic photocatalytic materials.
(1) A lot of work needs to be done for the development of GCN based plasmonic photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts for practical applications. There is a massive difference in the reported literature on photocatalytic performance of plasmon mediated GCN due to the lack of systematic protocols. The use of different synthesis procedures, reactors and light sources misleads to a certain extent and makes it difficult to evaluate the claim of superior photocatalytic activity. Thus, it is of utmost importance to develop a universal protocol to evaluate the photocatalytic performance to get a clear idea of where we are in terms of photocatalytic advancements for large-scale applications.
(2) It can be concluded from this review that there is a gradual increase in the research exploration from bare GCN to plasmon mediated GCN based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts and there is a huge improvement in the photocatalytic activity upon incorporation of plasmonic materials. However, a clear understanding of the charge transfer mechanisms and controlled loading of each component is important to achieve optimum catalytic performance. Thus, the development of extensive theoretical tools is necessary to understand the interactions between the various components in the nanocomposite to get an insight into the efficiency of charge transfer. Besides, theoretical investigation confirms the sufficient modifications in the band structure of the photocatalyst, which ensures the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the resulting materials.
(3) In most of the reports available in the literature, more emphasis has been put on the importance of band gap while synthesizing photocatalysts, but the band positions or potentials are not considered in most of the reports. However, a clear understanding of band positions and band structures is a key parameter for designing novel photocatalytic materials. The band gap only gives information about light absorption while there is no information about the redox potentials of band edges. The formation of redox species is responsible for the degradation of pollutants and depends upon the band edge potentials.
(4) The design and development of plasmon mediated GCN based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts seems to be an attractive solution for solving the environmental issues and for the production of useful organic compounds. Still, more work needs to be done in the design of photocatalysts with homogeneous distribution of plasmonic NPs to ensure a strong contact between GCN and plasmonic materials. This will result in minimum leaching and enhanced recyclability of these catalysts.
Finally, the prompt development in the field of photocatalysis in the past few decades has triggered a revolution in heterogeneous catalysis and resulted in the formation of various advanced photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysts. The exploration of interesting properties of GCN based plasmonic materials will continue in the future to develop more efficient and stable catalysts in combination with other suitable semiconductors and plasmonic materials. The tailback of global environment and organic synthesis-related issues could be addressed in upcoming decades by an enhanced understanding of the underlying catalytic mechanisms by employing advanced in situ and operando characterization techniques. Overall, it can be concluded that there are several unexplored opportunities in the field of GCN based plasmonic materials and a collective global effort by researchers could pave the way for their uncovering and development of more advanced photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic materials.
