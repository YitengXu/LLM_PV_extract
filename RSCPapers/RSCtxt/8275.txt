In this study, highly (00l)-oriented Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films have been fabricated on single-crystal MgO substrates using a facile magnetron co-sputtering method. Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films with Te contents of 63.8 at% show an optimized thermoelectric performance, which possess a Seebeck coefficient of −157.7 μV K−1 and an electrical conductivity of 9.72 × 104 S m−1, leading to a high power factor approaching 25 μW cm−1 K−2. The partially decoupled behavior of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity is contributed to Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure interfaces, which causes interfacial barrier filtering and scattering effects; thus, a high level of the Seebeck coefficient is obtained. Meanwhile, carrier transport in a–b plane can benefit from the highly preferred orientation, which guarantees a remarkably high electrical conductivity. We anticipate that our strategy may guide the way for preparing high-performance thermoelectric materials by microstructure design and regulation.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, the large proliferation of the demand on cost-effective, pollution-free power resource stimulates worldwide interests in novel energy technologies such as solar cells,1 superconductors,2 and thermoelectrics.3–5 Among them, thermoelectric technology, which enables direct conversion of heat into electricity without maintenance, has attracted growing attention.6–8 Especially, bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3)-based thermoelectric materials (Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3 and their ternary alloys) have already exhibited prominent performance at room temperature and have been used in some fields.9–12 The efficiency of thermoelectric materials is usually evaluated by a dimensionless figure of merit ZT, ZT = S2σT/κ, where S, σ, T and κ are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, absolute temperature and thermal conductivity, respectively, and S2σ is the power factor.13–15 Therefore, to develop high-performance thermoelectric materials, it is essential to decouple these thermal-electrical parameters even though they are usually interdependent.16,17
Low-dimensional (LD) thermoelectric nano-structures have been found to increase grain boundaries to suppress κ by increasing the phonon scattering.18,19 However, this value in crystalline materials has a theoretical limit, leaving little room to improve ZT if only considering κ.20 Therefore, to achieve further improvement in ZT, relevant theory and technical process in enhancing S and σ are also desirable. Recently, despite that high-performance p-type Sb2Te3 films have been fabricated on monolayer graphene by sputtering with an optimum S2σ of 85.8 μW cm−1 K−2,21 n-type counterpart with comparable thermoelectric performance has not emerged. Few attempts have been reported to achieve high-performance n-type thermoelectric films by doping Bi2Te3-based thermoelectric materials. For example, Zhou et al. reported n-type Pb-doped Bi2Te3 thin films with peak S2σ of 21.5 μW cm−1 K−2 through annealing at 473 K.22 However, besides the complex annealing process, this film showed strong interdependent S and σ.
Recently, studies on improving ZT by increasing S2σ rather than only decreasing limited κ are attracting more and more attention. Dun et al. reported that n-type Cu-doped Bi2Se3 nanoplate/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite films, fabricated by chemical solution method, show a high S2σ of 1.03 μW cm−1 K−2 and peak ZT of 0.1 at 290 K, in which S and σ can be partially decoupled because PVDF can introduce the energy barrier at inorganic/organic interfaces.23 Wan et al. demonstrated n-type organic intercalated TiS2 single crystals with peak ZT of 0.28 at 373 K by decreasing κ and increasing σ.24 Luo et al. showed that electron doping and grain orientation are essential to enhance the thermoelectric performance of SnSe2, which increase S2σ and decrease κ, leading to a high in-plane ZT of 0.68.25 These reports suggest that decoupling thermal-electrical parameter is an alternative strategy to construct high-performance thermoelectric materials by energy-dependent carrier filtering effect resulting from heterostructure interfaces. Additionally, Choi et al. prepared Te-embedded Bi2Te3 (Te–Bi2Te3) thin films by the molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) method, showing a decreased κ through enhanced interface phonon scattering between the Te–Bi2Te3 boundaries.18 Meanwhile, Osamu Yamashita et al. fabricated the p-type (Bi0.25Sb0.75)2Te3 doped with 8 wt% excess Te and n-type Bi2(Te0.94Se0.06)3 doped with 0.02 wt% Te prepared by the Bridgman method, from which the improved ZT of 1.41 and 1.13 are observed, respectively.26 All these studies indicate that introducing nanoscale heterostructure interfaces into the Bi2Te3 matrix is an effective strategy to optimize the thermoelectric properties of Bi2Te3-based materials. Thus far, there are few reports exploring the effects of Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure interfaces on Bi2Te3 thin films prepared by a magnetron sputtering method.
In this study, we fabricate Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films on single-crystal MgO substrates by a facile magnetron co-sputtering method. Such thin films show a high S of −157.7 μV K−1 and a competitive σ of 9.72 × 104 S m−1. Through detailed structural analyses and thermoelectric properties evaluation, we illustrate the underlying reason for the improved thermoelectric properties, which are attributed to the highly preferred orientation structure of Bi2Te3 thin films and low-energy carrier filtering effect by the native interphase of Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure.
2. Experimental details
The magnetron sputtering method was chosen to prepare Bi2Te3 thin films on single-crystal MgO substrates at 573 K. The hot-pressed Bi2Te3 (99.999 at%) and Te (99.999 at%) targets with a diameter of 75 mm were used as the source materials. The Bi2Te3 and Te targets were connected to the direct power supplier and the radio frequency (RF) supplier with different powers, respectively. The distance between substrates and targets was 140 mm. The substrate holder rotated around 30 rpm. The pressure of deposition chamber was below 7.5 × 10−4 Pa before deposition, and the working pressure was about 0.65 Pa with the 200 sccm of Ar as the sputtering gas. The time of sputtering was 1 h and the thickness of films was about 420 nm.
The surface morphology and chemical composition of the (00l)-oriented Bi2Te3 thin films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI-Siron) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attached in the SEM. The phase structure of Bi2Te3 thin films was analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Focus) with Cu Kα radiation with operation voltage and operation current fixed at 40 kV and 40 kA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Tecnai G2 F20S-TWIN electron microscope. The Hall coefficient RH was determined using a Quantum Design PPMS-9T instrument using alternating current transport configuration. The carrier concentration n and in-plane Hall mobility μ were calculated according to n = 1/eRH and μ = σRH, respectively. The S and σ of highly (00l)-oriented Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films were measured by ZEM-3 (U1vac Riko, Inc.).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural and chemical characterizations
Bi2Te3/Te thin films were deposited on single-crystal MgO substrates by the co-sputtering process using Bi2Te3 and Te targets, in which case the Te content of thin films could be regulated by controlling the Te target's power (0, 5, 8 and 12 W). Moreover, there is no extra replenishment of Te element when Bi2Te3 thin films were fabricated under 0 W of Te target's power. The phase structure of thin films was investigated by XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the main composition of films is Bi2Te3 phase (JCPDS no. 15-0863). In addition, the dominant diffraction peak is (0015), except for the MgO substrate (004) peak, as shown in Fig. 1(a), which demonstrates that most Bi2Te3 grains grow along the z-axis through inducing single-crystal substrates. It is well known to all that the lattice constants between MgO crystals (a = 0.4384 nm) and bismuth telluride (a = 0.4203 nm) are similar to have a very small lattice misfit, leading to epitaxially grown Bi2Te3 thin films along the z-axis. Furthermore, the peak of (005) is significant when Bi2Te3 thin films were deposited under 0 W of Te target's power, which could be attributed to the BiTe phase (JCPDS no. 44-0667). It suggests that the films prepared only by Bi2Te3 target have both Bi2Te3 and BiTe phases. Fig. 1(b) was obtained by the logarithm to base 10 of the values on the y-axis of Fig. 1(a) when 2θ ranges from 12° to 40°, from which some diffraction peaks could be observed more clearly. For example, the peak of about 2θ = 18° shifts to the low angle with the increasing power of Te target. As a result, the peak (005) of BiTe phase is gradually replaced by the peak (006) of Bi2Te3, which indicates that BiTe phase disappears and changes into Bi2Te3 when the sputtering power of Te target increases. Particularly, for Bi2Te3 thin films which were prepared under 8 and 12 W of Te target, there is almost no BiTe phase. Additionally, it is expected that some other peaks, such as (104) and (110), are also observed, which belongs to Te phase (JCPDS no. 23-1000) by comparison with standard powder diffraction card. That is, additional Te atoms existed in the main matrix of the Bi2Te3 thin films. Specifically, the content of Te atoms could be adjusted as 63.5 at%, 63.8 at%, and 64.1 at% when the power of Te target was 5, 8 and 12 W, respectively, which suggest that there are more Te atoms distributed in the matrix with the increasing sputtering power of Te target. Actually, when Bi2Te3 thin films were prepared under 0 W of Te target, the Te content is slightly less than 60 at% (theoretical value) owing to the evaporation of Te atoms at high deposition temperature. Related analysis is performed by EDS, with the related values listed in Table 1.

Fig. 1(c)–(f) show the surface morphology evolution of Bi2Te3 thin films prepared under different powers of Te target. It has been modified with the increase in Te content, suggesting that the morphology is closely related to film compositions, as shown in Fig. 1(d)–(f). Furthermore, the surface of all the samples is smooth and dense, which is beneficial for carrier transport and improvement of thermoelectric properties for Bi2Te3 thin films. In addition, almost all the grains of Bi2Te3 thin films have an average planar dimension of about 300 nm, which is nearly independent of compositions.
In order to further verify the existence Te phase, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies of the grain boundaries and interfaces of Bi2Te3 thin films were adopted in our experiments. As a typical example, the detailed elemental mappings with Te target power of 8 W are given in Fig. 2(a)–(c), which confirm the homogeneous distribution of Te and Bi elements. Furthermore, the atomic percent of Te and Bi are 63.78 at% and 36.22 at%, respectively, which is consistent with the results of EDS analysis based on the whole thin films (Table 1). The HRTEM image of Fig. 2(d) clearly reveals the crystalline structure of Bi2Te3 thin films with lattice distances of 0.498 nm and 0.322 nm, which is also consistent with XRD analysis. More importantly, Te dopants, as a crystalline phase, are clearly observed in Fig. 2(d), which have a different crystalline structure and are segregated from Bi2Te3. In this case, the Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure interfaces are formed. It is noteworthy that the interfaces between Te and Bi2Te3 phases have the potential for a localized high-strain field, which can also act as a carrier transport barrier to filter the ones with lower energy. All these unique morphologies are beneficial to partially decouple the intrinsic inter-dependent S and σ, owing to the adjustable Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure interfaces.

3.2 Thermoelectric properties
Temperature-dependent thermoelectric performance of Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films was systematically investigated. As can be seen in Fig. 3(a), σ of all samples decreases slowly with increased temperature, which indicates the metallic conduction behavior. It is well known that carrier transport in a–b plane could benefit from the highly (00l)-oriented structure.27 Thus, the high σ can be attributed to the preferred orientation structure along z-axis and the high crystallinity of Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films. With the increased Te content (from 59.85, 63.5, 63.8 to 64.1 at%), the room temperature σ first decreases, then shows a peak value at Te content of 63.8 at% and finally decreases, which are determined as 8.68 × 104, 6.96 × 104, 9.68 × 104 and 3.42 × 104 S m−1, respectively. As we all know, the σ can be expressed using the following formula:σ = neμwhere n is the carrier concentration; e is the carrier charge; and μ is the carrier mobility. In order to uncover the detailed mechanism behind this trend, the Hall measurement was performed. First of all, with the increasing content of Te dopants, the n of thin films decreases monotonously. This is expected, because Te (p-type) and Bi2Te3 materials (n-type, in this work) have different types of carriers, leading to the neutralization reaction. Furthermore, this might be closely related to the increased interfacial scattering between the Bi2Te3 and Te grains because there may be more Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure interfaces when the Te content increases. Due to the optimized carrier concentration, the carrier mobility first increases to the maximum at around 13.07 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a Te content around 63.80 at% when deposited at 8 W of sputtering power of Te target, and then decreases with more Te (∼64.1 at%) distributed in thin films. In the last case, when the Te content is higher than the saturated value, what would play a major role is the increased Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure interfaces carriers scattering instead of the reduced carrier collision related to the decreased concentrations. Nevertheless, as the present Bi2Te3 thin films have the highly preferred orientation along z-axis that is beneficial for the carrier transport in a–b plane, all σ is comparable to other reported values for Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films, as can be seen in Tables 1 and 2.

Temperature-dependent S of Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films were shown in Fig. 3(b) and (d). All in-plane S are negative, suggesting the n-type carrier transport mechanism in the deposited films. The room-temperature values of S are −53.6, −67.3, −157.7 and −109.0 μV K−1 when the power of Te target is 0, 5, 8 and 12 W, respectively. Surprisingly, the absolute value of S also increases first and then decreases as Te content increases. Similarly, the optimized sputtering power of Te target is also determined as 8 W, as shown in Fig. 3(d). That is, the S and σ for the samples significantly increase and then achieve the peak values at the same time with the increasing content of Te dopants. For the degenerate semiconductor under assumption of a simple parabolic electronic band structure, the relationship between S, n and scattering parameter could be expressed by Mott formula,  where kB, m*, h and r are the Boltzmann constant, carrier effective mass, Planck's constant and scattering parameter, respectively. Therefore, it is straightforward that the improved S is contributed to the scattering and decreased n around the optimized range. With controllable Te content in the present study, the S of Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films can be well adjusted. Actually, a great enhancement in the S of Bi2Te3 thin films (Te content of 63.8 at%) has been achieved because of the Te phase that affects the electron/phonon transport. Previously, Zhang et al. showed that an intermetallic phase introduced an interfacial barrier between the cold and hot carriers, with which cold carriers were more strongly scattered than that of the hot ones and thereby an over 50% enhanced S2σ (∼2 μW cm−1 K−2) was obtained.28 In this study, besides the highly preferred orientation structure, the interfaces between Te and Bi2Te3 phases also affect the enhanced S and σ of thin films. The detailed analysis of HRTEM (Fig. 2(d)) reveals that the enhancement in S and σ can be ascribed to the electron scattering by distinct nanostructures, such as interfaces from Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure, as well as other details that will be analyzed in the following section.
The S2σ of highly (00l)-oriented Bi2Te3 thin films with different amounts of Te dopants were calculated based on the above-mentioned measurement. As a result of the decoupled S and σ, the room temperature S2σ of Bi2Te3 thin films improve remarkably to about 25 μW cm−1 K−2, with the optimized compositions deposited at 8 W of Te target's sputtering power (as shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f)), which corresponds to about tenfold enhancement compared with Bi2Te3 without Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure interfaces (2.49 μW cm−1 K−2). Table 2 and Fig. 4 compare thermoelectric parameters from some representative reports and the present study, which demonstrate that the optimized S2σ (25 μW cm−1 K−2) in our study is remarkable among the values of Bi2Te3 thin films prepared by the magnetron sputtering method. In addition, S2σ exhibits quadruple enhancement compared with that of the best n-type Bi2Te3-based films materials synthesized by a chemical solution synthesis method (as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4). Therefore, the achieved data indicate that the carrier transport in a highly (00l)-oriented crystalline structure and nano-structure interface critically contributes to the enhancement of S2σ.

3.3 Mechanism of energy filtering
The boost in S2σ results from the decoupled S and σ, which can be further explained by the interfaces barrier introduced through Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure. To clarify the mechanism, the band alignment between Bi2Te3 and Te phases is demonstrated in Fig. 5. The detailed electrical information of Bi2Te3 and the work function of Te phases are taken from the literatures.20,34 Before contact, the initial Fermi level of Te is located above the intrinsic Bi2Te3, as shown in Fig. 5(a). After introducing Te dopants, the blend band gap between the matrix Bi2Te3 and Te dopants forms a potential interfacial barrier with height ΔE (∼0.35 eV, Fig. 5(b)). As a result, interfaces in Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure introduce an energy-dependent barrier to prevent the transport of electrons with lower energy, i.e., when electrons with an energy distribution higher than ΔE can pass through the interfacial barrier, electrons with energy lower than ΔE would be strongly scattered or stopped. On the one hand, the ones with higher energy could contribute to an enhancement of S compared with the cases without an interfacial barrier. On the other hand, highly preferred orientation structure along z-axis is beneficial for electron transport in a–b plane, resulting in a high σ. This decoupling strategy gives a high room temperature S2σ value (25 μW cm−1 K−2) for Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films prepared by a simple magnetron sputtering method in this study.

4. Conclusions
In summary, highly (00l)-oriented Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure thin films have been deposited on the single-crystal MgO substrates by a facile magnetron co-sputtering method. The optimum values of S and S2σ are −157.7 μV K−1 and 25 μW cm−1 K−2, respectively. Additionally, this work illustrates that the strongly coupled parameters, i.e., S and σ, could be largely decoupled due to the introduction of heterostructure interfaces into the structure of Bi2Te3 thin films as well as the highly preferred orientation structure along the z-axis. Specifically, the Bi2Te3/Te heterostructure results in: (I) the neutralization reaction of carriers that optimized n and μ and (II) the interfacial barrier effects, boundaries and interfaces scattering. It is believed that the present study will provide a guideline to prepare metal-chalcogenide thermoelectric materials with high-performance.
