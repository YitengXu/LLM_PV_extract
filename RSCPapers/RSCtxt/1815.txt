    , Accepted 5th February 2016First published on 5th February 2016AbstractIn this study, we report solution-processed vanadium oxide (s-VOx) as the hole extraction layer (HEL) for polymer solar cells (PSCs). A s-VOx thin film is prepared simply by the spin-coating of ammonium metavanadate ammonal water solution on the surface of indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates, followed by thermal annealing at 210 °C for 5 minutes in air. The scanning Kelvin probe measurement indicates that the work function of the s-VOx HEL is −5.3 eV, which allows most of the conjugated polymers to form an Ohmic contact with the s-VOx HEL, resulting in a large open-circuit voltage for PSCs. It is found that PSCs incorporated with the s-VOx HEL possess a comparable power conversion efficiency and better shelf-stability with those incorporated with the poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) anode buffer layer. Thus, our method provides a simple approach to prepare a solution-processed s-VOx HEL for higher performance PSCs.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their intrinsic merits of low-cost, flexibility and possibility of high throughput manufacturing.1,2 Improvements in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have been achieved by novel conjugated polymers with narrow band-gap and high absorption coefficients, optimal device architectures and interfacial engineering.3–14 In BHJ PSCs, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is typically used to modify the surface of the indium tin oxide (ITO) anode. However, high acidic PEDOT:PSS has been demonstrated to corrode the ITO surface and further induce the degradation of PSC performance.15–17 In order to circumvent these problems, transition metal oxides, such as molybdenum oxide (MoO3),18,19 tungsten oxide (WO3),20,21 nickel oxide (NiO)22,23 and vanadium oxide (V2O5),24,25 have been used as the hole extraction layer (HEL) to substitute the PEDOT:PSS layer. PSCs incorporated with these metal oxide HELs have been demonstrated to possess better stability and comparable PCEs as compared with those with PEDOT:PSS layers.
Among these metal oxides, V2O5 was widely used as the HEL because it is a wide bandgap semiconductor and possesses a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (∼−7.0 eV).26 Such a high HOMO energy level would offer an Ohmic contact between V2O5 itself and conjugated polymers. Shrotriya et al. first reported a vacuum-evaporated V2O5 layer as the HEL in PSCs with a device structure of ITO/V2O5/BHJ composite/Al.27 Solution-processed VOx (s-VOx) was also used as the HEL in PSCs, but high-temperature processing (>300 °C) was required to achieve a certain micro-structure or a crystalline phase for enhancing the electrical conductivity of s-VOx.28 Such a high-temperature is not suitable for manufacturing PSCs on the flexible substrates. Moreover, the PCEs of PSCs incorporated with the s-VOx HEL were significantly lower than those either incorporated with a PEDOT:PSS layer or a vacuum-deposited V2O5 HEL.29
In this study, we report a facile way to fabricate a solution-processed VOx layer followed by thermal annealing treatment at 210 °C for 5 minutes in air, as the HEL in PSCs. We find that PSCs incorporated with the s-VOx HEL possess comparable PCEs, but better shelf-stability with those with a PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layer.
Experimental
Materials
Poly[4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithio-phene-2,6-diyl-altethylhexyl-3-fluorothithieno [3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate-4,6-diyl] (PTB7) and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methylester (PC71BM) were purchased from 1-Material Inc. and used as received without further purification. Ammonium metavanadate was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was synthesized in our laboratory.30,31
s-VOx thin film preparation
A 40 mg metavanadate powder is dissolved into 4 mL of ammonium hydroxide 28% NH3·H2O solution (1:3 by volume).32 The mixture is continually stirred at 50 °C till the solution becomes a transparent solution. After that, the s-VOx thin film is spin-cast on the ITO substrates from the transparent solution after being filtered using a 0.45 μm size filter, followed by thermal annealing at 210 °C in air for 5 minutes. Scheme 1 presents the processing steps for the preparation of a s-VOx thin film.

Thin film characterization
The thickness of the thin film is measured using a surface profilometer (Tencor, Alpha-500). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is conducted on a Thermo Nicolet 510, USA, using a KBr disc containing the 1% finely ground sample. UV-vis absorption spectra of thin films are conducted on a HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements are conducted on a NanoScope NS3A system (Digital Instrument). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are performed on a ESCALAB MK II (VG Co., Ltd, England) spectrometer, with Al Kα excitation radiation under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The work function of the s-VOx thin film is estimated by the scanning Kelvin probe measurement (SKP 5050, KP Technology).
Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
The device structure of PSCs is displayed in Scheme 2. The pre-cleaned ITO substrates are firstly treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 4 minutes. After that, the s-VOx HEL is deposited on the top of the ITO surface as described above. Afterwards, an ∼100 nm BHJ composite is spin-coated on the top of the s-VOx layer from chlorobenzene solution composing of PTB7 and PC71BM (1:1.5 by weight, a polymer concentration of 9 mg mL−1), with 3% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) in the glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere. Before depositing the top metal cathode, a ∼5 nm PFN layer is spin-coated from methanol solution. Finally, an ∼100 nm Al electrode is thermally evaporated on the top of the PFN layer in a vacuum with a base pressure of 2.0 × 10−4 Pa. The device area is measured to be 16 mm2.

The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs are measured on a Keithley 2400 source meter under 1 sun, AM 1.5 G spectrum from a class solar simulator (Japan, SAN-EI, XES-40S1) with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity is calibrated using a Newport certified reference silicon cell (PV Measurements, with a KG-5 visible filter). A spectral mismatch factor (M) value of 1.03 was used to obtain the correct photocurrent and efficiency for the devices according to the previously published paper,33 where the measurement condition is identical.
The PSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/Al (Scheme 2) are also fabricated and characterized. ∼40 nm PEDOT:PSS is spin-coated on the top of the ITO surface, followed by thermal annealing at 150 °C for 15 minutes in air. The fabrication of a PTB7:PC71BM BHJ composite layer and an Al cathode is the same as described above.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSCs were performed on a DSR100UV-B spectrometer with a bromine tungsten light source, a SR830 lock-in amplifier and a calibrated Si detector.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the FTIR spectroscopy of s-VOx thin films. A strong stretching vibration peak at 1000 cm−1 attributed to VO is observed from both the as-prepared and thermally annealed thin films. Moreover, a strong peak at 3460.3 cm−1 is observed from the as-prepared thin film. These two peaks are attributed to the stretching vibration of H–O and the N–H bending vibration, respectively. These peaks completely disappear after the thin films are thermally annealed at 210 °C for 5 minutes. These results demonstrated that the s-VOx thin film can be formed from ammonium metavanadate solution via thermal decomposition at 210 °C for 5 minutes.

XPS is further carried out to study the chemical composition of s-VOx thin films and the asymmetry V2p spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. The binding energies and oxidation states are summarized in Table 1. A Lorentzian–Gaussian combination is utilized to approach the fitting curves.34 The binding energies for V2p1/2 are peaked at 523.60 ± 0.1 eV and 524.55 ± 0.1 eV. The binding energies for V2p3/2 peak at 516.30 ± 0.1 eV and 517.25 ± 0.1 eV. The positions and shapes of these peaks are representative of V atoms with oxidation states of +5 and +4, which correspond to the stoichiometric V2O5 and substoichiometric V2O4, respectively.26,35,36 The O1s spectra with binding energies of 531.10 ± 0.1 eV and 532.20 ± 0.1 eV are also observed. The former one is assigned to the O atom in the s-VOx structure, and the latter one is attributed to the O atom from the undecomposed precursor.25

The degree of reduction from V5+ to V4+ depends on the variation of processing conditions of VOx thin films.24 The relative atomic concentrations are calculated by dividing the total peak area of V2p and O1s with the appropriate relative sensitivity factors.37 From the XPS measurements, VOx has been calculated to be substoichiometric with a V:O ratio of 1:2.35.

Fig. 3 displays the transmission spectra of s-VOx thin films and PEDOT:PSS thin films. It is clear that the transmittance of s-VOx thin films is higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS thin film from 400 nm to 800 nm. The higher transmittance of s-VOx thin films is favorable for the BHJ composite to harvest more light, which would result in a high photocurrent.

The AFM images of s-VOx and PEDOT:PSS thin films are shown in Fig. 4. It is observed that the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of s-VOx and PEDOT:PSS thin films is 0.863 nm and 1.110 nm, respectively. A small surface roughness of s-VOx thin films on the top of ITO substrates indicates that the surface of ITO (RMS: 1.384 nm) is smoothed, which would result in a high photocurrent.13

The J–V characteristics of PSCs based on the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ composite under white light illumination with a light intensity of 100 mA cm−2 are shown in Fig. 5. The device performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. The PSCs without any HEL exhibit an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.64 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 15.38 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 59.71%, with a corresponding PCE of 5.88%. The PSCs with PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layers exhibit a VOC of 0.74 V, a JSC of 15.58 mA cm−2 and a FF of 67.21%, with a corresponding PCE of 7.75%. The PSCs with s-VOx HELs exhibit a VOC of 0.73 V, a JSC of 15.79 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.82%, with a corresponding PCE of 7.70%. These device performance parameters are comparable to those from PSCs with PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layers. A smaller VOC observed from PSCs without any HEL indicates that the contact between the ITO anode and the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ composite is non-Ohmic contact,38 a rational VOC value from s-VOx device originates from Ohmic contact due to the work function of −5.3 eV.

Fig. 6 presents the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PSCs. By comparing PSCs with PEDOT:PSS, the EQE spectrum of PSCs with s-VOx HELs reveals an enhancement of the wavelength (λ) ranging from 400 nm to 700 nm, with a maximum value of 71.82% at λ = 630 nm. The JSC values estimated from the EQE spectra are 14.69 mA cm−2, 15.18 mA cm−2 and 15.42 mA cm−2 for PSCs without any anode buffer layer, with the PEDOT:PSS layer and the s-VOx HEL, respectively. The JSC values estimated from the EQE spectra are in good agreement with those estimated from J–V characteristics.

While the JSC values from PSCs are different, the significant differences in PCEs are due to the variation of the FF and VOC. VOC was reported to be proportional to the energy difference between the HOMO energy level of the electron donors and the LUMO energy level of the electron acceptors, but it was also influenced by the electrode work function difference when the non-Omhic contact is formed between the electrode and the BHJ active layer.39–41 In this study, the smallest VOC value is observed from PSCs built on the bare ITO anode, where the non-Ohmic contact between the ITO anode and the BHJ active layer is formed. However, large VOC values (VOC > 0.50 V (−4.7 V − (−4.2 V) = −0.5 V), where −4.7 V and −4.2 V are the work function of the ITO anode and the Al cathode, respectively) are observed from PSCs with the device structure of ITO/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/Al or ITO/s-VOx/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/Al or ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/Al. These large VOC values rule out the rules described above. The VOC values of PSCs with the s-VOx HEL and the PEDOT:PSS layer are higher than those of PSCs built on the bare ITO anode. Such a difference is originated from the energy level differences between the BHJ composite layer and the insert layer.42,43
For solar cells, the J–V characteristics in the dark can be described as:44 (1)where Jo is the reverse dark current density; q is the electron charge; n is the diode ideality factor; k is Boltzmann's constant; T is the temperature; and Jph is the voltage-dependent photocurrent produced by the cell. In the dark, the photocurrent density is zero (J = 0), Jph = JSC and the RSH is considered sufficiently high to eliminate the term  in eqn (1). Therefore, the dark J–V characteristics can be described as (2) From eqn (2), it can be seen that for a low value of Jo, there is a large apparent value of VOC. The Jo value of PSCs with the s-VOx HEL is remarkably lower than that without any HEL. Thus PSCs with the s-VOx HEL possess a higher VOC. For PSCs with the PEDOT:PSS layer, Jo is also lower than that without any HEL. Thus, the VOC value obtained from PSCs with the PEDOT:PSS layer is larger than that from PSCs without any HEL.
The FF value is related to the series resistance (RS) and the shunt resistance (RSH) of solar cells.45 The RS and RSH values can be estimated from J–V curves under dark, which are shown in Fig. 3a. The estimated results are summarized in Table 2. The RS values obtained from PSCs with the PEDOT:PSS layer (∼5.17 Ω cm2) and the s-VOx HEL (∼ 5.28 Ω cm2) are smaller than that built on the bare ITO anode (∼7.32 Ω cm2). The RSH value from PSCs with the s-VOx HEL (∼1303.52 Ω cm2) is much higher than that from PSCs built on the bared ITO anode (∼372.69 Ω cm2). The higher RSH implies that the leakage current and charge recombination are effectively suppressed and higher hole selectivity by the s-VOx EHL is induced.46 We therefore conclude that the s-VOx HEL can also serve as an effective electron blocking layer that significantly reduces leakage currents in PSCs, resulting in high PCEs.
The shelf stabilities of PSCs tested in air are presented in Fig. 7. It is clear that the PCEs of PSCs are continuously decreased along with the storage time. However, the degradation in PCEs of PSCs incorporated with s-VOx HELs is smaller than that in PCSs either with PEDOT:PSS or without any hole extraction layer. The PCEs of PCSs incorporated with PEDOT:PSS and ITO-only show 32% and 38% degradation after 4 days, respectively. While the PCEs still maintain 83% of their initial value after 4 days for PSCs incorporated with s-VOx HELs. Such better shelf stability observed from PSCs incorporated with the s-VOx HEL is attributed to the durability of transition metal oxide films, while the PEDOT:PSS layer in atmosphere humidity has been implicated in degrading the interface of the ITO anode.47

Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated that s-VOx prepared from metavanadate solution, followed by thermal annealing at 210 °C for 5 minutes can be used as the hole extraction layer (HEL) in polymer solar cells. Polymer solar cells with the s-VOx HEL possess comparable efficiency, but better shelf stability as compared with those with the PEDOT:PSS layer. Thus, our findings provide a simple approach to prepare solution-processed s-VOx HEL PSCs.
