    , Accepted 4th May 2022First published on 14th May 2022AbstractSolar-driven chemical processes are promising alternatives to conventional chemical production, especially considering the global challenges faced by humans, such as energy shortage, environmental pollution and global warming. Designing and constructing high-performance semiconductor photocatalysts with broad light absorption, matching band positions, fast carrier transfer, and sufficient active sites are highly desired but also challenging. Since bulk photocatalytic materials generally suffer from rapid carrier recombination due to their large physical dimensions, fabricating nanometer-sized photocatalytic materials is regarded as an effective strategy to shorten the carrier migration distance, thereby encouraging more carriers to be involved in photocatalytic reactions before recombination. 2D ultrathin materials are an important family of photocatalysts due to their large lateral dimension/thickness ratio. The goal of this review is to summarize the latest progress in 2D ultrathin materials from a green synthesis perspective, involving specific synthetic strategies and approaches. The discussed 2D materials include bismuth oxyhalides (BixOyXz), carbon nitrides (C3N4), conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).
1. Introduction
Energy shortage, environmental pollution and global warming are three great challenges faced by the governments of many countries. Although many remedial actions have been implemented, to solve these issues thoroughly, human society has to use more renewable energy sources in industrial production and manufacturing. In this context, photocatalysis, which includes photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction, photocatalytic nitrogen fixation, and the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, is a promising alternative to conventional chemical production processes due to the use of solar light as a driving force.
The key to photocatalysis is to design and construct high-performance semiconductor photocatalysts with broad light absorption, matching band positions, fast carrier transfer, and sufficient active sites. However, in practice, few known photocatalysts possess all these properties. Further works on optimization and screening are needed to obtain perfect photocatalysts. To realize this goal, a large number of semiconductors with different chemical compositions and structures have been fabricated and screened. In the field of inorganic, organic, and metal–organic semiconductors, there are some representative materials with high stability and nontoxicity favored by researchers, such as bismuth oxyhalides (BixOyXz),1,2 carbon nitrides (C3N4),3–5 conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs),6,7 and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).8,9 However, bulk materials suffer from the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers due to their physical dimensions (larger than 10 nm), leading to suppressed carrier excitation, separation and migration.10 To deal with this drawback, an effective strategy is to fabricate nanometer-sized photocatalysts to shorten the carrier migration distance, thereby encouraging more carriers to be involved in photocatalytic reactions before recombination. Moreover, nano-photocatalysts usually exhibit extraordinary physical and chemical properties, making them important components of functional materials.
2D ultrathin materials generally have extended lateral dimensions (100 nm to several microns) and atomic or molecular thicknesses typically less than 5 nm. Ultrathin nanosheets in particular exhibit significant imparity in their local atomic zones and have a lot of surface dangling bonds that are prone to introducing surface atomic defects or producing active sites.11 In the case of BiOCl nanosheets with dominant (001) facets, many exposed dangling Bi–O bonds with long bond length and low bond energy make the terminal oxygen atoms escape to form oxygen vacancies.12 Similarly, abundant unsaturated metal atoms exposed in 2D MOF nanosheets can act as active sites due to the enhanced adsorption to reactants.9 The intrinsic porous structure of 2D COFs is beneficial to the introduction and exposure of active sites.13 In addition, ultrathin materials have good photopermeability, which can result in improved solar-energy-conversion efficiency. These merits of 2D ultrathin materials greatly promoted the development of photocatalysis in recent decades.
Although photocatalytic reactions are normally regarded as pollution-free processes, the photocatalysts can be harmful and their synthesis is sometimes environmentally unfriendly, which is often ignored in many publications. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal the eco-friendly or relatively eco-friendly preparation methods of 2D inorganic materials, 2D organic materials, and 2D metal–organic materials, providing insights for the development of green synthesis methods and harmless 2D photocatalytic materials. 2D chalcogenide materials composed of metal sulfides, metal selenides and metal tellurides are typical inorganic photocatalysts, and a series of reviews have been published on the preparation of each subclass in recent years.14–18 In addition, the famous molybdenum sulfides and molybdenum selenides are widely used in photocatalysis as cocatalysts, due to their narrow bandgap (1–2 eV).19–21 Hence, in this review, the emerging 2D bismuth oxyhalides are selected as the representative of 2D inorganic photocatalysts with non-toxicity, high stability and tuneable band structure. Likewise, the synthetic methods of 2D g-C3N4, 2D COF, and 2D MOF photocatalysts are systematically discussed and summarized.
2. Green synthesis strategies for 2D nanosheets
For the preparation of bismuth oxyhalides, MOF, carbon nitride and COF nanosheets, a direct preparation strategy (i.e. bottom-up strategy) and two-step strategy (i.e. top-down strategy including synthesis and exfoliation) are mainly discussed. The direct preparation strategy essentially restricts the reaction of precursors in 2D space and hampers the stacking of 2D nanosheets. The two-step strategy frequently focuses on the exfoliation of layered bulk materials. Based on the two preparation strategies, a variety of synthesis and exfoliation methods have been developed (Fig. 1), such as solvothermal method, thermal procedure, colloidal synthesis, interfacial synthetic method, surfactant assisted synthesis, etc. For various methods, their environmental friendliness is discussed and compared in the following sections.
 Fig. 1  The synthesis of 2D nanosheets evolved from direct preparation and two-step preparation. 
2.1. 2 D bismuth oxyhalides
Bismuth oxyhalides were selected as representative inorganic photocatalytic materials in this review due to their typical layered structure, superior carrier transport properties, excellent chemical stability, nontoxicity, and resistance to corrosion. Moreover, the band gaps of bismuth oxyhalides are adjustable by replacing the halogen source or changing the stoichiometric ratio of Bi, O and halogen elements,22,23 because their valence-band maximum (VBM) is primarily composed of hybridized O 2p and X np orbitals (n = 3, 4, and 5 for X = Cl, Br, and I) and their conduction band minimum (CBM) mainly consists of Bi 6p orbitals.24,25 Therefore, bismuth oxyhalide materials can be categorized into classical BiOX and extended BixOyXz and the synthesis details for the two are different.

2.1.1. Synthesis strategies of BiOX. 
The preparation of BiOX is mainly through bottom-up synthesis strategies such as precipitation, hydro-/solvothermal synthesis and colloidal synthesis. BiOX crystals have a layered structure and different crystal facets with various surface energies will be exposed during the growth of nanosheets. BiOX with different halogens has been demonstrated to have different active crystal facets for photocatalysis. Generally, BiOCl nanosheets formed along the [001] zone axis have high photocatalytic activity,22 because the top and bottom surfaces of the nanosheets are (001) facets that have high oxygen density (Fig. 2),26 therefore benefiting the formation of oxygen defects.27 For BiOBr nanosheets, their (102) facets exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than the (001) facets, because the (102) facets have lower CBM, higher VBM, and therefore narrower bandgap, which is beneficial to the generation of photoinduced carriers.28 In contrast, BiOI with (110) facets exposed displays significantly improved visible-light photocatalytic activity.29 The bandgaps of BiOX mainly depend on the halogen atoms. For example, the bandgaps for BiOCl, BiOBr, and BiOI are 3.3, 2.7, and 1.8 eV, respectively.2

Rough BiOX sheets with a thickness of tens of nanometers can be prepared by the precipitation method, which is an oxidation-hydrolysis process. Briefly, Bi2O3 was dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form BiCl3–HCl solution, to which polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was added as a stabilizer. Then water was added dropwise to the solution under ultrasonic treatment to generate the (001) facet-dominant BiOCl sheets.30 When Bi2O3 is replaced by NaBiO3, BiOCl nanosheets can be formed without PVP and ultrasonic assistance.31 For the formation of 2D BiOI sheets, bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) as a Bi source was dissolved in potassium iodide (KI) solution, followed by vigorous stirring to produce a precipitate.32
Hydro-/solvothermal synthesis is another typical and facile method that has been widely used for the synthesis of (001) facet-dominated layered BiOX nanosheets. Essentially, this method is a hydrolysis process of Bi salts. In this process, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and halogenated potassium are usually used as precursors; the pH value and reaction time play a key role in the growth of BiOX nanosheets. For example, BiOCl single-crystalline nanosheets with exposed (001) facets could grow in a mixture of Bi(NO3)3 and KCl solution, via a hydrothermal process at 160 °C for 24 h,22 while (010) facet-dominant BiOCl crystal was obtained by adjusting the pH using NaOH solution to 6.0 before hydrothermal treatment. Unlike the synthesis of BiOCl, BiOI nanosheets with dominant (001) facets can be obtained by solvothermal synthesis (in ethanol) at 180 °C for 24 h.33 When reducing the reaction time to 2 h, BiOI with (100) facets exposed is the main product. In addition, the single-crystal nanosheets of BiOI with dominant (001) facets can also be synthesized through annealing BiI3 at 350 °C in air.34 However, the obtained BiOX nanosheets from the two methods are usually very thick (80–200 nm).
In comparison to the hydro-/solvothermal synthesis, colloidal approaches do not need high pressure and can produce ultrathin 2D BiOX nanosheets. In this method, the assistance of surfactants (e.g., oleylamine and oleic acid) is vital for the formation of ultrathin nanosheets, where the surfactants serve as soft 2D colloidal templates for directing the crystal growth.35 For different Bi sources, the reaction conditions need to be adjusted accordingly. For instance, single-crystalline BiOCl ultrathin nanosheets with thicknesses of 3.7–8 nm were fabricated by hydrolysis of BiCl3 in octadecylene solution (Fig. 3a).36 In this process, apart from the surfactant, the synergistic effect between Fe3+ and acetylacetone (acac) was demonstrated to be another key factor facilitating the formation of well-defined BiOCl ultrathin nanosheets. It is speculated that Fe3+ might be a nucleating reagent for the growth of crystalline BiOCl nanosheets, and the coordination of acetylacetonate with iron ions may restrict the growth of BiOCl crystals along the [001] crystal direction. However, when Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and halogenated potassium are employed as Bi and halogen sources respectively, iron(III) acetylacetonate is no longer needed for the growth of BiOX nanosheets (Fig. 3b), therefore avoiding the Fe3+ contamination.37 It is worth mentioning that so far only BiOCl and BiOBr ultrathin nanosheets with highly exposed (001) crystal facets can be prepared via the colloidal method.

2.1.2. Synthesis strategies of BixOyXz. 
It is reported that lowering the X/O ratio can result in materials with lower valence band (VB) position, narrower bandgap, and rich oxygen vacancies,38 so that the extended bismuth oxyhalides (BixOyXz), such as Bi3O4Cl, Bi3O4Br, Bi12O17Cl2, Bi5O7Br, and Bi15O16Cl2, have been developed for the visible-light-driven photocatalysis.39 Besides the above-mentioned methods for the synthesis of BiOX, there are more approaches for preparing extended BixOyXz, such as water-induced self-assembly,38 ionic-liquid-assisted solvothermal method,40 calcination,41 mechanical stirring,39 and thermal procedure.42 However, the solvothermal method and thermal procedure are more popularly used to prepare 2D BixOyXz nanosheets. For example, Bi3O4Cl single-crystalline nanosheets were obtained from an alkaline mixture of Bi(NO3)3 and NaCl (or KCl) via a solvothermal process.43,44 Calculation results showed that the (110), (010) and (001) crystal faces of Bi3O4Cl had different band structures, and carbon doping could enhance the internal electric field (IEF) inside Bi3O4Cl, promoting the migration of electrons and holes to (010) and (110) facets along [Bi3O4] and [Cl] slices, respectively (Fig. 4a and b).44 Likewise, Bi24O31Br10 nanosheets were formed in the mixture sequence containing ethylene glycol (EG), Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, NH4Br, and ethanol amine through solvothermal processing.45

Generally, the solvothermal method can produce defect-deficient Bi3O4X, which exhibits poor photocatalytic activity. Thus, J. Di and co-workers developed a simple thermal procedure to fabricate defect-rich single-unit-cell Bi3O4Br nanosheets.42 Briefly, NaBr solution was slowly added into a mannitol solution containing Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and PVP under vigorous stirring, and the pH was controlled at 11.5 using NaOH solution (Fig. 4c). The ultrathin Bi3O4Br nanosheets with a thickness of 1.9 nm were obtained after heating the mixture solution at 160 °C for 24 h. Recently, J. Tian and co-workers prepared Bi5O7Br nanosheets by directly heating Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and KBr in ammonia solution. In addition, BixOyXz nanosheets can be also obtained from mechanical stirring. For instance, J. Xia and co-workers obtained Bi12O17Cl2 nanosheets by stirring a mixture of BiCl3 ethanol solution and NaOH.39
For a brief summary, there are many bismuth oxyhalide synthesis methods, but only a few of them are suitable for the preparation of 2D bismuth oxyhalides, such as hydro-/solvothermal, and colloidal synthesis methods. The 2D BiOX and 2D BixOyClz nanosheets usually grow in weak acid and strong alkaline environments, respectively. In terms of Bi source, besides Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, bismuth oxide and bismuth chloride can also be used to synthesize 2D bismuth oxyhalides in the presence of HCl or HNO3. However, the use of strong acids or bases is normally regarded as an eco-unfriendly process. Therefore, new green synthesis routes are highly desired. Moreover, although BiOBr and BiOI show narrowed band gaps, the rapid carrier recombination and the incompatible band-edge positions for target redox reactions still hinder their practical application.

2.2. 2D ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride
Carbon nitride (C3N4) is one of the most widely studied photocatalysts, which has good tolerance to the surrounding environment even under strong acid or alkaline condition, and can be easily prepared in an environmentally friendly manner. Pristine C3N4 can be prepared via polymerization of nontoxic or low toxic nitrogen-rich precursors such as cyanamide,46 dicyandiamide,47 melamine,48 and urea.49 The polymerization methods can be thermal polymerization,50–53 microwave-assisted condensation,54 and ultraviolet irradiation driven synthesis.55 For example, bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is usually fabricated by thermal polymerization. This material exhibits poor photocatalytic performance due to its small specific area, slow charge carrier mobility, and rapid carrier recombination. To solve this problem, increasing the contact area with reactants and shortening the electron migration path by constructing ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets could be an effective method. Until now, the ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets are mainly produced by exfoliating bulk g-C3N4. Since the carbon nitride layers are bonded with each other through van der Waals forces (VDW), they can be easily exfoliated through methods such as ultrasonic treatment, acid exfoliation, gas exfoliation, thermal oxidation etching, thermal annealing, etc.
In many publications about g-C3N4, the exfoliation of layered bulk g-C3N4 into large and intact nanosheets in water can be achieved solely by ultrasonic treatment. However, the g-C3N4 nanosheets obtained from sonicating bulk g-C3N4 show a wide thickness range, and the ultrasonic method often requires long time and a subsequent centrifugation process, which usually results in low yield. It is surprising that atomically thin g-C3N4 nanosheets can be obtained when bulk g-C3N4 is further etched by thermal oxidation in air or annealing under a flowing Ar atmosphere. For instance, ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets with thicknesses of 1.5–2 nm can be obtained by sonicating bulk g-C3N4 that has been thermally treated at 520 °C for 3 h (Fig. 5a).56 Using the same method, R. Yang and co-workers obtained atomically thin 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets with a thickness ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 nm.57 Moreover, the ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets with a thickness between 1.2 and 2.2 nm can also be produced by annealing bulk g-C3N4 at 700 °C under an Ar atmosphere.58 However, the two approaches have different mechanisms. The essence of the thermal oxidation etching method is to oxidize interlaminar hydrogen bonds formed by NH/NH2 groups,59 while the thermal annealing process not only causes the expansion of bulk g-C3N4, but also changes the local structure and edge groups of g-C3N4 layers. Specifically, the NC–N structure in melon units loses nitrogen atoms during annealing, forming C–C bonds within layers and CN/C–OH groups at the edges (Fig. 5b).58

In addition to oxidation in air, another way of g-C3N4 exfoliation is acid oxidant etching. Briefly, the bulk g-C3N4 can be treated in K2Cr2O7-H2SO4 or concentrated H2SO4 for a certain time to obtain g-C3N4 nanosheets.60,61 In this process, hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl were introduced onto g-C3N4 frameworks, which promoted the dispersion of g-C3N4 in water (Fig. 6a). The oxidation exfoliation can also work with a mixture of multiple oxidants such as sodium nitrate, potassium permanganate, and hydrogen peroxide.62 However, the use of oxidizers and concentrated H2SO4 results in the formation of micropores on g-C3N4 layers, which is not desired, and the strong acids and oxidizers also cause environmental concerns.

Gas exfoliation is another method for 2D material preparation and it has been used for the production of boron nitride nanosheets,63 graphene nanosheets64 and V2O5 nanosheets.65 Recently, H. Si and co-workers extended this method to the exfoliation of g-C3N4 nanosheets.66 Specifically, bulk g-C3N4 is heated to 550 °C to expand its interlayer spacing, and then quickly immersed in liquid N2 to facilitate the diffusion of N2 molecules into the interlayer and thus maintain the swelling structure (Fig. 6b). The final 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets are obtained after several gasification processes.
To sum up, the top-down exfoliation strategies including thermal oxidation exfoliation, acid oxidation exfoliation, ultrasonic exfoliation, and gas exfoliation are mainly used to prepare ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets from layered bulk g-C3N4. Among these methods, thermal oxidation exfoliation and ultrasonic exfoliation are two easiest ways of generating atomically thin 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets. However, a disadvantage of the ultrasonic exfoliation method is that the resultant nanosheets have a wide thickness distribution. Gas exfoliation is another green approach to produce single- or few-layered g-C3N4 nanosheets, but it is challenging to scale up this method due to the high swelling temperature and low annealing temperature required. In addition, although the acid oxidation exfoliation could be an effective approach, the challengeable posttreatment of the excess oxidizers and strong acids limits its practical application.
2.3. 2D COF nanosheets
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively studied in photocatalysis due to their tunable structure and excellent photothermal stability. 2D COF nanosheets are especially important in photocatalysis. It is worth mentioning that in a typical de novo synthesis of COFs, the key for forming crystalline frameworks is the requirement of a highly reversible covalent linkage,67 which can be realized through Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, Yamamoto reaction, Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction, oxidative coupling reaction, Schiff-base reaction, phenazine-ring-fusion reaction, etc. For instance, acetylene can be introduced into the linkages of frameworks via Sonogashira reaction; the bonding of two aromatic building blocks involves Yamamoto reaction or Suzuki coupling reaction; hydrazine bonds form through Schiff-base reaction or imine condensation. Although the complete preparation process of COFs involves the use of many harmful chemicals and solvents, we discuss the green preparation of 2D COF nanosheets mainly focusing on the polymerization and exfoliation steps. As many 2D materials, the methods for 2D COF nanosheet production can be classified as top-down or bottom-up strategies.

2.3.1. Top-down strategies for 2D COF nanosheet preparation. 
Since most bulk COFs organize their layered structure through van der Waals interaction or weak hydrogen bonds, the top-down building strategies are mainly used for preparing 2D COF nanosheets. Therefore, ultrasound, solvent intercalation, and chemical reactions are employed to overcome the interlayer forces and delaminate the layered COFs, which largely determine the thickness of 2D COF nanosheets.
COFs with weak interlayer forces can be delaminated by solvent swelling and ultrasonic processing. For instance, W. R. Dichtel and co-workers investigated the stripping abilities of solvents by soaking the hydrazone-linked COF-43 directly in various solvents.68 They found that COF-43 can be exfoliated to ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of ca. 1.3 nm in dioxane, water, and DMF without structural damage. A similar method can be used to prepare few-layered nanosheets of hydrazone-linked COF (TPT/OH) that is synthesized through condensation of 2,4,6-tris(p-formylphenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine and dihydrazide.69 The solvent swelling method works perfectly with the help of ultrasonication, which allows more layered COFs to be exfoliated. The nanosheets of JUC-510, JUC-511, and JUC-512 containing porphyrin units are stripped in isopropanol by ultrasonic processing.70 Likewise, the typical COF-1 nanosheets made of 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriborinane were ultrasonically exfoliated in dichloromethane.71 In order to improve the exfoliation and dispersion of COF nanosheets, organic acids were used to protonate the COF nanosheets to prevent them from approaching each other. W. R. Dichtel's group found that imine-linked COF disperses well in acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran mixture or water simply by stirring in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, due to the protonation of imine linkages.72 Better suspensions would be formed with further ultrasonic treatment. However, part of the exfoliated COF nanosheets would re-aggregate during the solvent removal, resulting in a wide thickness and diameter distribution. Nevertheless, solvent swelling and ultrasonic treatment are regarded as powerful methods for the exfoliation of most bulk COFs.
For some specific bonds, groups or structures, chemical exfoliation protocols were proposed to break the π–π stacking interactions between layered frameworks of COFs. It is well known that anthracene containing conjugated double bonds can undergo Diels–Alder reaction with maleic anhydride. Thus, S. Haldar and co-workers used maleic anhydrides as functionalizing exfoliation agents (FEA) to exfoliate the anthracene functionalized IISERP-COF7 and IISERP-COF8 into few-layered nanosheets.73 However, this chemical protocol breaks down the conjugation of frameworks, which would change the photoelectric properties of resultant nanosheets.
For the highly crystallized CTF-1 with good thermochemical stability, intercalation and oxidation exfoliation using oxidizing acids is an effective approach. For example, X. Fan's group treated H2SO4-intercalated CTF-1 with a mixture of H2SO4 and HNO3, obtaining single-layered or few-layered nanosheets (Fig. 7a).74 Similarly, concentrated H2SO4 solution of ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) was also employed as an intercalation medium and oxidizing agent to exfoliate layered CTF.13 In the oxidation step, the end-CN and some triazine rings of the framework were oxidized and hydrolyzed to active groups such as amide and amino. However, some conjugated linkages may also be oxidized and therefore lose their conjugation, which is detrimental to the application of the resultant nanosheets in photocatalysis. Recently, Y. Xu's group developed a novel redox strategy to prepare ultrathin nanosheets (ca. 1.5 nm) with complete conjugated frameworks (Fig. 7b).75 Briefly, the layered CTF-1 was stirred in concentrated H2SO4 at room temperature for intercalation. Water was then added into this mixture to generate a lot of heat, which could promote delamination of nanosheets. In the oxidation process, some oxygen-containing groups were introduced to the phenylenes in CTF frameworks, which promoted the intercalation and subsequent exfoliation. However, during this process, the 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine in CTF frameworks was also changed remarkably. Therefore, hydrazine hydrate was needed to selectively reduce the oxygen-containing groups to the original structure.

Moreover, some building blocks exhibit photoresponsive conformational transition, such as azobenzene that shows UV-driven conformational transition from trans to cis. This property can be utilized for exfoliation as well. For instance, J. Yao and coworkers reported a UV-driven exfoliation protocol for azobenzene-linked COF-x.76 Specifically, azo molecules were uniformly mixed with polymer monomers in order to embed azo molecules in the interlayers of COF during polymerization. Under UV light irradiation, the transformation of azo from trans to cis conformation enlarged the interlayer spacing, and sonication further promoted the layer slipping.


2.3.2. Bottom-up strategies for 2D COF nanosheet preparation. 
Bottom-up synthesis strategies of 2D COF nanosheets are relatively ecofriendly compared to the top-down strategy, because the use of organic solvents and organic acids was avoided. One way of realizing the bottom-up construction of 2D COF nanosheets is to restrict or induce the polymerization of precursor molecules in 2D space, such as the interfacial synthetic method and substrate-induction growth method.
For the interfacial synthetic method, the precursors polymerize at a confined interface, which allows horizontal growth of COF while limiting its vertical growth. There are two types of interfaces for the growth of 2D COF nanosheets: liquid–liquid interfaces and gas–liquid interfaces. The selection and configuration of suitable interfaces depend on the properties and reaction conditions of precursors and catalysts. Moreover, the immiscibility and density gradient of the two solvents are also key factors in the formation of liquid–liquid interfaces. In this context, halogenated hydrocarbons and water are usually used to form oil–water interfaces. Taking COF (Tp-Bpy) prepared by Schiff-base reaction as an example, since 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol is soluble in dichloromethane and diamine/triamine-p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA) salt can be dissolved in water, the reaction between 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol and diamine/triamine can occur at the biphasic interface (Fig. 8a).77 During this process, the slow diffusion rate of amine-PTSA salt at interfaces is favored for the thermodynamically controlled growth of 2D nanosheets. Considering that some precursors are water-insoluble and the organic solvents that can dissolve them are miscible with water, L. Ma and co-workers proposed an A–C–B multiphase reaction system to grow 2D COF nanosheets (NS-COF) at the interface of the two miscible organic solvents (Fig. 8b).78 In this reaction system, the lower phase A and upper phase B are miscible organic solutions, while the middle phase C is a low-density solvent (solution) and is immiscible with A and B. Due to the high density of the upper solution B that contains one monomer, it will gradually permeate through the middle phase C and reach the CA interface to react with another monomer dissolved in the phase A. The middle phase C essentially acts as a buffer, and catalysts can be dissolved in this phase.

Besides the interface formed by two bulk phases, microscopic interfaces that are generated under stirring can also serve as a platform for reaction. For the cyclotrimerization reaction of 1,4-dicyanobenzene (DCB) in liquid phase, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) is usually used as a catalyst. Y. Xu and co-workers reported a method in which the DCB was dissolved in dichloromethane and stirred with a small amount of TfOH to generate micro-interfaces (Fig. 8c).79 The reaction occurs at these interfaces, resulting in the formation of CTF-1 nanosheets. Moreover, gas–water interfaces can also be used for the synthesis of 2D COF nanosheets. Sodium oleyl sulfate (SOS), as a classic surfactant, can self-assemble into a monolayer at the gas–water interface driven by the hydrophilic interaction of SO4− polar head groups. With the assistance of the SOS monolayer, 2D polyimide and 2D polyamide films were fabricated at interfaces (Fig. 8d).80–83 Furthermore, X. Feng and co-workers obtained a highly crystalline film (PI-2DP) through pretreating 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (4-aminophenyl) porphyrin with HCl, by which the adsorption and orderly assembly of monomers under the SOS monolayer were facilitated due to the improved hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction.83
The substrate-induction growth method, also known as the template-assisted method, is another fabrication method of COF nanosheets, in which the groups or atoms on the substrate surface induce COF growth along or perpendicular to the substrate surface. Therefore, the choice of substrate material is determined by the polymerization reactions. In the case of cyclotrimerization of 2,4,6-tris(4-ethynylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine, conjugated 2D TzF was successfully prepared using cheap copper foils as a 2D substrate, because copper was a catalyst to the cyclotrimerization reaction and its 2D surface led to thermodynamically more stable 2D COF nanosheets (Fig. 9a).84 The TzF flakes could easily detach from the copper foil by gentle washing with H3PO4, and the residual copper species embedded in the organic flakes could be removed by concentrated HNO3. However, amorphous 3D TzG could be formed on the 2D TzF in later stages of the reaction, which makes it difficult to obtain pure 2D nanosheets.

Moreover, some 2D materials with functional groups at surfaces can also be used as substrates. The functional groups can covalently anchor the precursors and induce the growth of 2D COF nanosheets. For instance, A. V. Talyzin's group reported the first case of anchoring benzene-1,4-diboronic acid (DBA) molecules to oxygen-rich groups of GO surfaces via a solvothermal reaction.85 The unreacted hydroxyl groups at the other end of DBA served as nucleation sites for COF-1 growth in mesitylene/dioxane solvent, resulting in the formation of ultrathin COF-1 nanosheets perpendicular to GO surfaces (Fig. 9b). However, due to the challenge of removing the covalently linked substrates, this method is mainly used for the fabrication of 2D/2D complexes or hybrid materials. Apart from GO, indium tin oxides,86 silicon wafer,87 single-layer graphene88,89 and polymeric substrates90 have also been employed as substrates for the growth of COF nanosheets, but their removal is rarely reported.
The essence of the bottom-up preparation strategy is to hamper the π–π stacking of 2D nanosheets in the COF synthesis process by weakening the interlayer interaction and increasing the interlayer spacing. In this regard, molecular-exchange could be an effective strategy in which many molecular modifiers are introduced onto the COF nanosheets to prevent them from tight π–π stacking and promote the horizontal growth. Taking advantage of the dynamic reversible imine bonds, J. Jiang and co-workers conducted imine-exchange for the imine-linked COF-367, in which far excess 2,4,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde (TBA) was added during the preparation of COF-367 under solvothermal conditions.91 By this way, numerous bulky 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl groups covalently bonded to the edges of COF nanosheets, leading to a high yield (55%) of COF-367 ultrathin nanosheets (Fig. 10). However, this method is only applicable to the preparation of COF nanosheets containing reversible bonds.

Besides the molecular-exchange method, the use of some specific precursors can also result in the spontaneous exfoliation of COFs into nanosheets,92 such as the monomers containing ionic groups,93–95 large branched chains, or non-planar structures,68,96–98 which can enhance the interlayer electrostatic repulsion or increase the interlayer distance, so as to prevent the orderly arrangement of COF nanosheets. Although the mentioned building blocks are almost useless for photocatalysis, this method inspires the development of self-exfoliated strategies.
To summarize, there are many strategies for the preparation of 2D COF nanosheets. The popular top-down exfoliation strategies, such as ultrasound exfoliation, solvent intercalation exfoliation and acid oxidation used for g-C3N4, are also suitable for exfoliating 2D COFs. However, the effect of ultrasonic and solvent intercalation on COFs is not as good as that on g-C3N4, probably because of the stronger interlaminar force in COFs. Although the acid oxidation exfoliation method works well for preparing ultrathin 2D COF nanosheets with excellent photocatalytic performance, the produced acidic oxidizing waste solution can raise serious environmental concerns. Besides, some chemical reactions on frameworks are employed to strip COFs into 2D nanosheets, but this strategy only works with COFs that contain specific groups, and has the risk of breaking the conjugation of frameworks. On the other hand, ultrathin COF nanosheets can also be constructed through bottom-up strategies; especially, the interfacial polymerization method is widely applied to the preparation of hydrazone functionalized 2D COFs. However, the design and construction of interfaces highly depend on the properties of monomers, resulting in poor universality of a specific interface. For the substrate-induced growth strategy, it is difficult to get rid of the substrates and obtain the pure COF nanosheets, although this is a viable strategy for 2D COF nanosheet preparation. The molecular-exchange approach is also not a universal method because the addition of excessive exchange monomers could damage the structural integrity of monolayer COF nanosheets.

2.4. 2D MOF nanosheets
The diversity of coordinated metal nodes and organic ligands allows for the preparation of MOFs with tailorable compositions, which exhibit extraordinary physical and chemical properties suitable for photocatalysis. On one hand, the exposed metal atoms or ligands are normally good absorption sites to substrates for photocatalysis. On the other hand, the coordination interaction between metal nodes and ligands induces the formation of layered MOFs, which is conducive to the preparation of 2D MOF nanosheets for photocatalysis. Due to the similar structures and interlayer forces involved in layered MOFs and COFs, some of the top-down and bottom-up synthesis strategies used for the construction of 2D COF nanosheets are also applicable to the preparation of 2D MOF nanosheets. For instance, both layered MOFs and COFs can be stripped into nanosheets by top-down sonication-assisted exfoliation. For materials with strong interlayer forces, exfoliation can still be achieved through this method, simply by increasing the sonicating power or prolonging the time.99–102 Likewise, the interface preparation approach and surfactant-assisted synthesis strategies are also widely applied to the preparation of 2D MOF nanosheets.9,103,104 Despite the unique advantage of the substrate-induced strategy for the growth of 2D ultrathin MOF nanosheets,105,106 this method is more suitable for the preparation of MOF based heterogeneous materials, due to the difficulty in substrate removal. Therefore, only some selected preparation methods of pure 2D MOF nanosheets will be described and discussed in this section.

2.4.1. Top-down strategies for 2D MOF nanosheet preparation. 
The metals of MOF with unsaturated coordination, acid radical ions, or terminal capping ligands can increase the interlayer spacing of MOFs, which is conducive to the infiltration and diffusion of small molecules between layers. The volume of these inserted molecules would change upon thermal expansion, contraction, or phase transformation. Therefore, the interlayer distance of MOFs can be further enlarged by freeze–thaw processing. For example, the layered MAMS-1 (Ni8(5-bbdc)6(μ-OH)4) composed of 5-tert-butyl-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (5-bbdc) ligands (Fig. 11a), μ-OH groups and Ni atoms was exfoliated into nanosheets by repeatedly freezing at −196 °C and thawing at 80 °C (Fig. 11b–d).107 Though this strategy can avoid serious fragmentation of the exfoliated nanosheets, the exfoliation yield is low.

Adapted with permission from ref. 100 Copyright 2017, American Chemical Society. 
Besides, some chemical exfoliation approaches have been developed for special ligands and metal nodes. For MOFs containing unsaturated coordination metals, the ligand intercalation protocol can greatly improve the exfoliation efficiency. Y. Ding et al. reported that using 4,4′-dipyridyldisulfide (DPDS) as the intercalating ligand to coordinate with Zn in Zn2(PdTCPP) (TCPP = 4,4,4,4-(porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzoic acid)) resulted in a significant interlayer distance expansion.108 The irregular disulfide bonds were cleaved by trimethylphosphine (PMe3), further weakening the interlayer force, which resulted in the formation of ultrathin 2D nanosheets upon gentle stirring at room temperature (Fig. 11e). The exfoliation yield of this approach is 6 times that of the sonication method.
Some pillared-layer MOFs (3D MOFs) can be exfoliated into 2D nanosheets by selectively removing or replacing the pillars through chemical reactions. Different exfoliation protocols have been developed based on the property of pillars. For the pillar ligands with a redox active backbone, their coordination ability can be reduced by oxidizing the ligands, which facilitates the selective removal of pillars while preserving the 2D layered structure. For example, in the cobalt carboxylate framework (3D-Co), the pillar ligand 2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid could be oxidized in an electrolyte solution, by which a transformation of 3D-Co to ultrathin nanosheets (2D-Co-NS) was achieved (Fig. 12a).109 Besides, considering that the coordinated metals usually preferentially interact with ligands having stronger coordination ability, replacing the pillar ligands with stronger terminal capping ligands is a good strategy. For example, exfoliation of {[Cd5(IDC)2(HIDC)(bpy)3(py)2-(H2O)3]2NO3·2H2O} and {[Cd5(IDC)3(bpy)2-(H2O)2]·NO3·3.5H2O}n (HIDC = imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid, bpy = 4,4′-bipyridine, and py = pyridine) can be realized through replacing their pillar ligands 4,4′-bipyridine with methylated pyridine derivatives, such as 4-methylpyridine, 2,6-dimethylpyridine, 3,5-dimethylpyridine, and 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (Fig. 12b).110

2.4.2. Bottom-up strategies for 2D MOF nanosheets. 
Unlike 2D COF nanosheets, 2D MOF nanosheets such as copper porphyrin MOF nanosheets (Cu-TCPP),111,112 cobalt-based MOF nanosheets,113 and porphyrin-based 2D lanthanide MOFs114 can be prepared directly under hydro-/solvothermal conditions using conventional or microwave heating. However, the nanosheets obtained by conventional thermal treatment are usually thick and have poor photocatalytic performance.
Recently, some thinning strategies for thick nanosheets based on poly-carboxyl ligands have been reported. One effective protocol is to use sacrificial templates that can induce the growth of ultrathin MOF nanosheets. In this protocol, amorphous metal oxide nanosheets (M-ONS), including monometallic and bimetallic M-ONS (e.g., Ni-ONS, NiFe-ONS, Co-ONS, Fe-ONS, Cu-ONS and CoCu-ONS), can be used as sacrificial templates.115 These templates release metal ions on or around their surface under hydrothermal conditions, which can coordinate with acidic ligands and therefore orient the growth of MOF nanosheets along the surfaces (Fig. 13a).

However, some metal ions or clusters show a nonplanar geometric coordination, which is more favorable to the growth of 3D MOFs. To prevent isotropic growth in three dimensions, the molecules having one carboxyl group are used as capping agents to connect with the non-planar coordination sites so that the remaining sites can coordinate with ligands to form 2D MOF layers under solvothermal conditions. For example, the Hf4+ cluster [Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(carboxylate)12] has 12 coordination sites, unable to meet the geometric requirement of the 2D layer. Cao and co-workers used formate as a capping molecule to occupy six coordination sites on the Hf4+ cluster, by which the left six sites in the same plane can coordinate with benzene-1,3,5-tribenzoate (BTB) ligands to form a 2D layer of Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(HCO2)6(BTB)2 (Fig. 13b).116 In this process, water is crucial to the formation of ultrathin nanosheets because it promotes the hydrolysis of supersaturated [Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(HCO2)12] and accelerates the decomposition of DMF into dimethylamine, which neutralizes the generated HCl.
In addition, using a nucleating modulator to control the 2D growth of MOFs is another effective pathway. For example, biphenyldicarboxylic acid (BPDC) and benzoic acid (BA) can selectively combine with zinc ions through coordination bonds, leading to the controllable growth of 2D Zn-TCPP nanodisks (TCPP = 4,4,4,4-(porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzoic acid)) (Fig. 13c).117 Likewise, in Y. F. Li and C. Z. Huang's work, acetic acid was used as a modulator to inhibit the deprotonation of carboxyl in tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (H2TCPP) for the preparation of 2D lanthanide-based MOFs (Ln-TCPP).114 For the synthesis of ultrathin bimetal MOF nanosheets with 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (1,4-BDC) as a ligand, a facile method was developed that is simply stirring the common Fe/Co salts and 1,4-BDC in dimethylformamide (DMF)/ethanol/triethylamine (TEA)/water at room temperature.118 In this process, the presence of water and TEA is critical for the growth of 2D nanosheets. TEA deprotonates the 1,4-BDC, accelerating the coordination of 1,4-BDC with metal ions (Fig. 13d). Meanwhile, small amount of OH− can be produced from TEA and water, which prevents the formed 2D MOF nanosheets from aggregation.
To summarize this section, many green synthesis strategies have been developed for the preparation of 2D MOF nanosheets, although each strategy only targets certain MOF materials. According to the aforementioned examples, the carboxyl ligands seem to be more likely to construct 2D MOF nanosheets with metal nodes. The preparation of MOF ultrathin nanosheets is usually in small scales, and requires long preparation time and harsh reaction conditions. On the other hand, the structure of MOF nanosheets can be precisely tuned via controlling unsaturated metal nodes or choosing diverse organic ligands, and functionalized by post-synthetic modification. Nevertheless, suitable structures for photocatalysis are limited to a few conjugated ligands, such as those containing porphyrin, phenyl, and multi-phenyl units. Therefore, the further development and practical application of 2D MOF nanosheets in photocatalysis still have a long way to go.

3. Conclusions
In this review, we have provided a comprehensive overview of the synthesis strategies and approaches of the rapidly expanding 2D ultrathin photocatalytic materials, such as bismuth oxyhalides (BixOyXz), carbon nitrides (C3N4), conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). The hydro-/solvothermal and colloidal synthesis methods have been reported to be the most effective for preparation of 2D bismuth oxyhalides. However, the 2D BiOX and 2D BixOyClz ultrathin nanosheets usually grow in weak acid and strong alkaline environments, respectively. For the preparation of g-C3N4 ultrathin nanosheets, the most widely used method is top-down exfoliation, including thermal oxidation exfoliation, acid oxidation exfoliation, ultrasonic exfoliation, and gas exfoliation. Although the thermal oxidation exfoliation and ultrasonic exfoliation are easy-operation, the resultant nanosheets have a wide thickness distribution. Similar top-down exfoliation approaches are also applicable to the preparation of 2D COFs. For COFs having specific groups at surfaces, 2D nanosheets can be obtained by stripping bulk COFs through chemical reactions on frameworks, despite the risk of breaking the conjugation of frameworks. Besides, 2D COF nanosheets can be synthesized through a bottom-up strategy, specific methods including interfacial polymerization, substrate-induced growth, and molecular-exchange approach. However, these methods are not universal, depending largely on the properties of monomers. The preparation of MOF ultrathin nanosheets involves both top-down and bottom-up strategies. Many methods are available for precisely tuning the structure of MOF nanosheets.
In an environmental friendliness view, the synthetic processes of 2D inorganic nanosheets are relatively green compared to that of most 2D COF nanosheets and 2D MOF nanosheets, given that organic solvents or some harmful chemicals are usually present in the preparation process of monomers and ligands. Although green or relatively green synthesis methods have been developed for 2D g-C3N4, 2D COF, and 2D MOF, the photocatalytic performance of the materials obtained is usually poor, requiring further post-processing with a strong acid or base. Even the high-performance ultrathin bismuth oxyhalides are prepared in strong alkali environments. Therefore, more effective and eco-friendly synthesis methods for 2D ultrathin materials with high photocatalytic activity are still highly desired and challenging.
