    , Accepted 6th November 2014First published on 10th November 2014AbstractThe organic polymer solar cell is recognized as one of the most competitive technologies of the next generation. Au nanoparticles and ZnO nanorods were combined to improve the inverted-structure low-bandgap polymer solar cells and enhance the absorption and efficiency of the devices. However, the Au nanoparticles tend to aggregate in solution, thus reducing the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect. The cluster effect on the spectral range of enhancement in the absorption is investigated and the absorption characteristics of the LSPR receive proper modification through our experiment. After reducing the number of Au nanoparticle clusters, the LSPR effect in the devices was clearly verified. The proper combination of the Au nanoparticles and ZnO nanorods leads to the power conversion efficiency of the PTB7:PC71BM inverted organic solar cell reaching 8.04% after optimizing the process conditions.
1. Introduction
Over the past few years, organic solar cells have been regarded as the most promising source of green energy for the future, taking advantage of their flexibility and potential to achieve large-scale and low-cost manufacturing under the solution process.1–3 The efficiency and the life time of polymer organic cells are influenced by the absorptivity and stability of the device structure and material. The inverted-structure organic solar cell adopts a high work function metal as the anode and avoids PEDOT:PPS on ITO.4,5 This helps to reduce the negative effects to the structure and life time, thus enhancing the efficiency and stability of the device.6–16 Cs2CO3,17,18 TiOx,19,20 and ZnO21,22 are three kinds of electron extraction layer that have been used to modify ITO. The features of ZnO include a wide energy gap, the capability to match the energy level of the polymer active layer, and the potential to allow large-scale solution processes.23 In earlier articles, there were discussions about different processes for generating a ZnO layer.24,25 In addition, the method of growing ZnO nanorods via a hydrothermal process was used for penetrating the active layer to extract carriers so that they could improve the short mobility distance of the organic material carrier and the insufficient absorption caused by the lack of thickness on the device.
To further enhance the device performance, we have adopted the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and applied it to the ZnO nanorod arrays in the inverted-structure organic cell. The metal nanoparticles, Au in this study, are blended into the organic active material. With the organic active material flowing into the spacing of the ZnO nanorod arrays, the 4 nm Au nanoparticles can exist in the spacing of the ZnO nanorods. Because the free electron vibration on metallic surfaces interacts with the photons from external interference, plasmon oscillation occurs and begins to transport dilatational waves along the metallic surface.26 Moreover, due to the uncertainty principle, the matching criteria of light energy and momentum are easy to meet after the space is localized. This brings out an obvious enhanced electromagnetic resonance effect from the near field of the nanoparticle surface, which is called localized surface plasmon resonance.27 In other words, through the application of surface plasmon resonance, the additional absorption (in particular the wave band) of the organic active layer material is therefore increased. In the past studies, it was confirmed that adding metallic nanoparticles to polymer solar cells or establishing an ordered metallic nanostructure was effective for boosting the light absorption and the potential of photocurrent, thereby enhancing the photoelectric conversion efficiency.28–30 Currently, there are applications that employ metallic nanoparticle surface plasmon resonance in the conventional structure of the device,31–36 the tandem polymer solar cells,37,38 and the devices with nanorod structures and sputtered metallic nanoparticles.39,40
For LSPR, the size of the nanoparticles has to be smaller than a certain number, such as smaller than 25 nm, to effectively excite the LSPR.41 In addition, the absorption spectrum due to LSPR depends on the size of the metallic nanoparticles.41–43 However, past studies using metallic nanoparticles for polymer solar cells have not clearly indicated that the size of the added metallic nanoparticles matches the mechanism of LSPR well.34 Therefore, it was impossible to determine exactly if the enhancement was prompted by the LSPR or the scattering effect. The aggregation would alter the main mechanism of metallic nanoparticles from the LSPR effect to the common scattering effect.43
From the experiment, we discovered that once the process was not kept in a low temperature environment, the Au nanoparticles in the solution would bring about intense clustering and affect their absorption spectrum performance on the LSPR effect. After the clustering, Au nanoparticles had a tendency to act as an enlarged effective size, causing a red shift on the absorption spectrum. However, the expected results based on the actual Au nanoparticle size were not obtained. In fact, the red shift on the absorption-enhanced band caused the device to display worse absorption performance. As a result, we discuss in the following, the solution we devised. In order to get the best absorption performance of the device, pretreatment with ultrasonic vibration was carried out to break apart the clustering of the Au nanoparticles and obtain the features on the absorption spectra that matched the LSPR effect of the correct Au nanoparticle size. From the above, we also verified that it was the surface plasmon effect giving rise to the enhancement of absorption.
Through adjusting the morphology, concentration, and doping method of Au nanoparticles, we were able to excite the surface plasmons of metallic nanoparticles by evenly doping the appropriate small-sized Au nanoparticles into the organic active material. We then applied the optimized morphology of ZnO nanorods with a greater length. Because of more volume of the rod spacing for the active material to fill, the effective thickness for light absorption was increased. In addition, the ZnO nanorods that were embedded into the active layer were able to serve as a carrier pathway and help the carrier transport. Furthermore, the nanorod morphology of ZnO caused an increase in the interface contact between organic and inorganic materials, which increased the absorption of the organic active layer, enhanced the transport and collection of carriers, and improved the absorption of light.44,45 In order to achieve the best performance, the thickness of the MoOx hole transport layer, which could influence the short-circuit current and fill factor, was fine-tuned.45 As a result, under single junction configurations, the development of an inverted-structure organic cell was encouraged, to pursue higher efficiency performance. By employing the doping of small-sized Au nanoparticles to induce the surface plasmon effect and embedding a ZnO nanorod array in the organic active material, the PTB7:PC71BM inverted organic solar cell system reached 8.04% photoelectric conversion efficiency.
2. Experimental
The devices were fabricated in an inverted structure. The active layer of PTB7/PC71BM was sandwiched between MoOx (molybdenum oxide) and ZnO, with ITO and Ag employed as electrodes.
In order to embed a ZnO nanorod array in the organic active material, a seed layer coating process and a hydrothermal growth process were used. Firstly, the sol–gel ZnO seed layer was prepared by mixing zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.0%) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH) (Alfa Aesar, 99%) and ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH). Secondly, the sol–gel was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO-coated glass substrate to form a ZnO seed layer. Afterwards, the device was annealed at 200 °C for an hour in nitrogen. In the next step, to fabricate the ZnO nanorod array, a growth-promoting solution for the hydrothermal process was prepared with zinc nitrate, HMT, and DI water. The hydrothermal process was implemented at 90 °C for 80 minutes, with the device suspended in the solution upside down. As the hydrothermal process finished, the device with the well-grown ZnO nanorod array was cleaned by IPA and DI water.
Next, to prepare the active layer material, PTB7/PC71BM (with a weight ratio of 1:1.5) was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene–chlorobenzene mixed solvent (with a volume ratio of 1:1) with a 3% additive solvent of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). In order to fabricate the solar cell devices with LSPR, 4 nm Au nanoparticles were then blended into the active layer material. After the Au nanoparticles were blended, ultrasonic vibration pretreatment at different time periods (from 0 to 60 minutes) was adopted to reduce the aggregation of the Au nanoparticles. Then, the active layer material was spin-coated onto the surface of the ZnO nanorod array in the glove box, followed by a post-treatment of drying in the glove box for 5 hours.
Lastly, after the active layer was implemented, the devices were fabricated with molybdenum oxide (MoOx) deposited as the hole-transport layer and silver (∼250 nm) as the back contact through thermal evaporation in a 3 × 10−6 Torr vacuum. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under solar irradiation simulated by a SUN 2000 (Abet Technologies, Inc.). The solar illumination, generated by a Thermo Oriel 150 W solar simulator with AM 1.5G filters, was calibrated at the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 by a NREL certificated mono-crystalline silicon reference cell (PVM-236). The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured, using QE-R-3015 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd). The lamp was calibrated using a mono-crystalline silicon reference cell provided by Newport Corporation.
3. Results and discussion
In the inverted-structure polymer solar cell, it is not easy to keep the high FF and levels of the absorption and the photocurrent solely through alternating the concentration and thickness of the active layer. Hence, by combining the ZnO nanorods and the surface plasmon effect of the Au nanoparticles, the absorption can be enhanced. In addition, the generated carriers that have been separated by the additional excitons can be transported through the channel provided by the ZnO nanorods. This enhances the absorption of the active layer and makes even more effective use of solar light. Besides, in previous studies, we have proven and also applied ZnO nanorods to the enhancement of the efficiency of the inverted polymer solar cell.46–52 As a result, the ZnO nanorods, which were 90 nm in average height, 27 nm in average spacing and 25 nm in diameter were used as the electron transport channel.53 The SEM images of the ZnO nanorods and the active layer are shown in Fig. 1. The thickness of the active layer was 160 nm. The devices with Au particles shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d) had been pretreated with ultrasonic vibration. From the SEM images, the 20 nm Au nanoparticles can be observed. They appear as bright spots above the nanorods in the SEM image. However, the 4 nm Au particles embedded inside the active layer cannot be observed because they are too small.

We added Au nanoparticles into the active layer of the device, which was embedded with ZnO nanorods. The illustration of the device is shown in Fig. 2(a), and the energy band diagram is shown in Fig. 2(b). The size of the Au nanoparticles is important. First, they have to be small enough to be embedded into the spacing among ZnO nanorods. Second, the size should correspond well to the absorption spectrum of the PTB7/PC71BM blend so that the LSPR can be induced to enhance the solar-cell performance. In order to make an effective arrangement of ZnO nanorods and Au nanoparticles, we inferred from Fig. 1 that if the Au nanoparticles were not chosen in the appropriate size, they would stick to the top of the ZnO nanorod array and cause difficulty in the permeation of the active layer material. Therefore, the 4 nm Au nanoparticles were incorporated into the active layer for coordination with the ZnO nanorod spacing, which had an average size of 20–30 nm (size ranging from less than 10 nm to over 40 nm). The method was used to observe how the different Au nanoparticle concentrations influenced the absorption and efficiency performance of the solar cell.

After adding different concentrations of Au nanoparticles, there was an increase in the devices’ absorption band and absorption amount which can be seen in Fig. 3. From the absorption spectrum, we observed that the surface plasmon resonance of Au nanoparticles contributed a considerable degree to absorption in the organic active layer. In addition, when the concentration increased, the spectrum showed that the absorption values increased between 550 nm and 700 nm. The characteristic peak was located at 610 nm. Due to the increase in the active layer absorption, the amount of carriers increased, and the Jsc of the device therefore increased.

According to Fig. 4, the optical analysis of the 4 nm sized Au nanoparticles (size from nanoComposix Company), the localized surface plasmon of a 4 nm particle should correspond theoretically, to an absorption band of around 500 nm. Compared to the absorption measurements in Fig. 3, the red shift of the increased absorption area did not match the localized surface plasmon effect of this nanoparticle size. Yet, the absorption band, which was contributed by a localized surface plasmon effect, should theoretically move toward higher wavelengths as the particle size increased.30,41 Therefore, we inferred that the use and the preservation of the 4 nm Au nanoparticles affected its dispersion. If the dispersion was under poor circumstances, then it would cause a cluster and show an absorption tendency that is similar to that of a large particle size.

Fig. 5 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase image analysis of the cluster and distribution condition with Au nanoparticles in the active layer. For the scan range of 500 nm × 500 nm, we observed a lot of clusters that were composed of many small dots. From the AFM, some small dots are under 10 nm and the size of the clusters range from 50 to 100 nm. The above confirms the distribution of the nanoparticles in the active layer. Because of the selection of solution, the preservation method, and the stirring, the nanoparticles were not ideally distributed evenly, but rather unevenly clustered into small pieces. This phenomenon was attributed to the condition that the colloidal solution of the Au nanoparticles was in an imbalanced state of thermodynamics, so the ambient temperature was likely to have a drastic impact on the preservation of the colloidal solution. However, when preparing the active layer, the nanoparticles were not in a low temperature and light-protected environment. They went through the heating and stirring process and thus, the high temperature at that point would induce clustering and precipitation of the nanoparticles in the solution.

To further confirm that the clustering of the Au nanoparticles had an impact on the shifts of the absorption-enhanced wave band, and to prove that the device enhancement was led by a localized surface plasmon effect, the active layer solution was prepared and pretreated using ultrasonic vibration to break apart any aggregation or precipitation of the Au nanoparticles and to improve their homodispersion. Prior to spin coating, the active layer solution that contained 0.20 mg mL−1 Au nanoparticles was treated with ultrasonic vibration over time periods ranging from 0 to 60 minutes. This caused precipitation of the cluster of Au nanoparticles, so the actual distribution of nanoparticles gradually became ideal. Fig. 6 shows the effect of the ultrasonic pretreatment over different time periods on the absorption spectrum. The measurement of the device efficiency performance is shown in Table 1 and the J–V curves are displayed in Fig. 7. As the processing time with ultrasonic vibration was increased, the absorption spectrum was enhanced between 450 nm and 570 nm. The absorption-enhanced characteristics above 600 nm started to decline after 1 or 2 minutes of the treatment. As the process time of ultrasonic treatment was prolonged to 60 minutes, the characteristic peak of the surface plasmon effect came near to 510 nm. On the contrary, the wave band where the absorption was enhanced before going through the ultrasonic pretreatment now shared the same characteristics as the device that did not have added Au nanoparticles. Due to the fact that the Au nanoparticles started improving their dispersibility all over again, the chances of the clustering of larger-sized metallic nanoparticles were reduced. As a result, the surface plasmon effect for 4 nm Au nanoparticles was enhanced at 510 nm.

Fig. 8 shows the absorption spectra of the organic active layer devices having different concentrations of Au nanoparticles and pretreated with ultrasonic vibration for 60 minutes. Compared with Fig. 4, the enhanced peaks of these spectra show good correspondence to the absorption characteristics of the metallic surface plasmon effect. It also shows that once the concentration increases, the absorption near the 510 nm band is also enhanced but without a significant shift. Because the nanoparticles are dispersed using ultrasonic vibration, the peaks for the various concentrations all appear between 450 nm and 570 nm. On the other hand, the LSPR effect is enhanced when there are more Au nanoparticles, so the peaks increase with the concentration. In short, in this series of experiments, we found that the application and pretreatment of metallic nanoparticles have an impact on the performance of the device. By comparing the characteristics of the absorption before and after the treatment, we verified that the surface plasmon effect of metallic nanoparticles played a leading role in the device's absorption enhancement. Table 1 demonstrates the device performance with different concentrations of Au nanoparticles. In comparison with the device without Au nanoparticles, the ones with Au nanoparticles enhanced the Jsc due to the fact that the Au nanoparticle surface plasmon effect contributed to the absorption enhancement of the active layer. Furthermore, the Jsc kept climbing up as the concentration increased. It reached its peak at 0.20 mg mL−1 and declined at 0.40 mg mL−1.
 Fig. 8  The comparison of the absorption spectra of organic active layer devices prepared with and without the addition of 0.10 mg mL−1, 0.15 mg mL−1, 0.20 mg mL−1, 0.30 mg mL−1, 0.40 mg mL−1 Au nanoparticles, respectively, and pretreated with ultrasonic vibration for an hour. 
The trend change of fill factor (FF) was similar to Jsc, but FF with Au nanoparticles performed worse than the ones without. FF went from 65.5% to 65.9% for 0 to 0.20 mg mL−1 of Au nanoparticles, but declined to 61.2% at 0.40 mg mL−1. The variations here were attributed to Rs and Rsh. The conducting power of Au nanoparticles was far better than those of conductive organic materials. By adding the right amount of Au nanoparticles, a carrier transport shortcut was provided. Therefore, the series resistance of the device dropped as the addition of Au nanoparticles increased. The figure declined from 3.0 Ω without Au nanoparticles to 2.7 Ω with 0.40 mg mL−1 of Au nanoparticles.
The addition of Au nanoparticles helped conductivity, yet the electrical conductivity direction was hard to control. Therefore, the leakage of current became severe as the concentration of Au nanoparticles increased. The parallel resistance dropped from 593 Ω without Au nanoparticles to 328 Ω with 0.40 mg mL−1 of Au nanoparticles. To conclude, when the concentration of Au nanoparticles was too high, it generated too many false transport channels, resulting in the loss of carriers. This condition influenced the performance of FF, and the Voc also declined as the concentration increased. As the energy level of Au was set to around −5.1–−5.47 eV (there were slight differences depending on the stacking patterns), it affected the carrier's ability to separate the built-in electric field on the donor–acceptor material interface. The exceeding addition damaged the material energy match of donor and accepter and caused the decline of Voc. The figure dropped from 0.71 V without Au nanoparticles to 0.65 V with 0.40 mg mL−1 of Au nanoparticles. The changes of Jsc and FF were determined by the positive and negative aspects of the enhancement of the device absorption, energy match, and carrier transport. Therefore we tried to maintain the dominance of high absorption and reduce the negative effects of carrier transport. The device increased the effect of its conversion efficiency from 7.22% without Au nanoparticles to 7.55% with 0.20 mg mL−1 of Au nanoparticles.
Even so, in order to achieve the best performance of the device, the thickness of the MoOx hole transport layer required adjustment for strengthening the transporting effect. It is cited that the thinner the active layer, the more sensitive it is to the thickness of MoOx.45 In addition, the main factor of the above influences lies in the short-circuit current and fill factor. Therefore, we took the optimal factor acquired from above to generate the device with various thicknesses of MoOx. The parameters of the devices are shown in Table 2, and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 9. When using 4 nm MoOx, the external quantum efficiency of the device reached the maximum, the Jsc was enhanced to 16.9 mA cm−2, and FF achieved 65.6% as shown in Fig. 10. Thus, the best device performance efficiency reached 7.88%. Lastly, the longer ZnO nanorod array was combined with the Au nanoparticle surface plasmon effect. By replacing the originally used 90 nm ZnO nanorod array with a 200 ± 10 nm ZnO nanorod array, the enhancement of Jsc brought out higher conversion efficiency results and achieved an optimal PCE of 8.04%. The performance is shown in Table 3.

4. Conclusion
We incorporated the Au nanoparticles into the active layer of the device and embedded it with a ZnO nanorod array. By adjusting the concentration and the method of doping, we were able to determine the optimal matching of Au nanoparticles and ZnO nanorod array. The device successfully improved absorption through the effect of surface plasmon, which was excited by the Au nanoparticles. In addition, by pretreatment with ultrasonic vibration, we effectively reduced the clustering of Au nanoparticles and disturbed the position of the characteristic peak in the absorption spectrum regarding the surface plasmon effect. From the above results, we confirmed that the surface plasmon effect plays a significant role in the absorption of a device. Consequently, the efficiency performance was enhanced from 7.22% to 7.55% through the surface plasmon. Lastly, by optimizing the device through offering a suitable hole transporting layer and an optimal ZnO nanorod array, the polymer solar cell with Au nanoparticles and ZnO nanorod array eventually enhanced the efficiency performance to 8.04% under the single junction configurations.
