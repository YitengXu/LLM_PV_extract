    , Accepted 7th February 2017First published on 7th February 2017AbstractAn inorganic lead halide perovskite film, CsPbI3, used as an absorber in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was optimized by controlling the annealing temperature and the layer thickness. The CsPbI3 layer was synthesized by one-step coating of CsI mixed with PbI2 and a HI additive in N,N-dimethylformamide. The annealing temperature of the CsPbI3 film was varied from 80 to 120 °C for different durations and the thickness was controlled by changing the spin-coating rpm. After annealing the CsPbI3 layer at 100 °C under dark conditions for 10 min, a black phase of CsPbI3 was formed and the band gap was 1.69 eV. Most of the yellow spots disappeared, the surface coverage was almost 100%, and the rms roughness was minimized to 3.03 nm after annealing at 100 °C. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the CsPbI3 based PSC annealed at 100 °C was 4.88%. This high PCE value is attributed to the low yellow phase ratio, high surface coverage, low rms roughness, lower charge transport resistance, and lower charge accumulation. The loss ratio of the PCE of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CsPbI3 based PSCs after keeping in air was 47 and 26%, respectively, indicating that the stability of the CsPbI3 based PSC is better than that of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x based PSC. From these results, it is evident that CsPbI3 is a potential candidate for solar cell applications.
Introduction
Organolead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as promising absorber materials for photovoltaic applications due to their various advantages such as high electron mobility (∼66 cm2 V−1 s−1), high light absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1), long carrier diffusion length (100–1000 nm) and tunable band gap which can be obtained by controlling the chemical composition.1–15 Since the introduction of the organolead halide PSC in 2009 as a sensitizer for dye-sensitized solar cells,16 several materials, such as spiro-OMeTAD as a solid electrolyte and Al2O3 as a scaffold, and techniques for sequential vapor deposition, have been developed in order to increase the efficiency of the PSCs.17–20 Consequently, organolead halide perovskites which showed increased power conversion efficiency (PCE) were established as an excellent absorber material.
Among the organolead halide materials, methylammonium (MA) lead halide has been widely used and shows the highest efficiency of 19% in PSCs.21 However, it is vulnerable to moisture because of the hygroscopicity of the MA cation.22 To overcome such problems, cesium halide materials were used as active layers of the PSCs and they showed outstanding stability due to their lower hygroscopicity compared to the MA cation and the higher thermal stability of Cs-perovskite.23–28 The band gaps (Eg) of CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 are reported to be 1.73 and 2.25 eV, respectively.29,30 Therefore, CsPbI3 is believed to be more suitable for the active layer of PSCs when compared with CsPbBr3 from the view point of light absorption. However, CsPbBr3 is more frequently used as the absorber compared to CsPbI3 in solar cells. This is because a high temperature process (>300 °C) is needed to transform the light yellow phase of CsPbI3 into the dark brown phase for improved absorption, which is not suitable for commercialization or flexible applications. It has been reported that hydroiodic acid (HI) produces the black phase of CsPbI3 at low temperatures and also results in a uniform and smooth film surface. HI induces the formation of smaller grains and stabilizes the black phase at lower temperatures because the smaller the size of the nanocrystals, the more stable they are in the black phase.29,31 Therefore, it is expected that the formation of CsPbI3 films with a HI additive would decrease the process temperature, and the PSCs based on the CsPbI3 film would exhibit improved PCE and stability.
In this article, inorganic lead halide perovskite compounds, CsPbI3, were applied as visible-light sensitizers in PSCs using a low-temperature process (100 °C) and the PCE was improved (4.88%). The CsPbI3 layer was synthesized by one-step coating of CsI mixed with PbI2 and a HI additive in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The cell structure was indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/CsPbI3/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/LiF/Al. UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were used to confirm the formation of the CsPbI3 perovskite layer. The yellow phase and its coverage were studied using a field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The root-mean-square (rms) roughness was measured with an atomic force microscope (AFM). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were also analysed to investigate the variation in the PCE with the temperature of formation of the perovskite layer. From these results, the principle of formation of CsPbI3 with a HI additive in PSCs was investigated.
Experimental details
Fabrication of CsPbI3 PSCs
Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass was used as the starting substrate; its surface was cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized (DI) water in the same sequence, and then dried using high purity nitrogen gas. The samples were treated with UV/ozone for 15 min. After the treatment of the substrate, PEDOT:PSS was formed at the active area and then the substrates were loaded into a N2-filled glove-box (<0.1 ppm of O2 and H2O). The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was 50 nm. To form the CsPbI3 precursor solution, CsI and PbI2 were dissolved in anhydrous DMF in a 1:1 molar ratio. For the low-temperature processing route, 33 μL of HI acid (57% w/w) was added to 1 mL of the 0.48 M precursor solution following previous reports.10,29 Then, the solution of the perovskite precursor was spin-coated at 6000 rpm for 30 s to prepare the perovskite films. The substrates were subsequently heated at temperatures in the range of 80–120 °C on a hot plate under dry conditions for 10 min to determine the optimized conditions. The color of the film changed from transparent light yellow to transparent dark brown with an intermediate opaque black phase. PCBM (Nano-C, used as received) was dissolved in chlorobenzene to prepare a 40 mg mL−1 solution. The PCBM solution was stirred for approximately 24 h in a glove box before being spin-coated (700 rpm, 15 s, 40 nm) on top of the CsPbI3 active layer. The substrates were subsequently heated at 75 °C on the hot plate for 30 min. The cathode consisted of BCP (3 nm), LiF (1 nm), and Al (100 nm) deposited at a base pressure of 1 × 10−6 Torr using a thermal evaporator. The BCP layer was used as the hole blocking layer. The active device area was 0.2 × 0.2 cm2. The schematic representations of the fabrication procedure and the structure of the solar cell are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b).

Fabrication of the CH3NH3Pb3−xClx PSCs
To compare the stability, a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx based PSC was also prepared. HI acid (10 mL, 57 wt% in water, Aldrich) and methylamine (22 mL, 33% in ethanol, Aldrich) were stirred in an ice bath for 3 h. Next, the solution was evaporated at 90 °C using a rotary evaporator to remove ethanol and DI water. Then, the dissolution of the precipitate into anhydrous ethanol and recrystallization with diethyl ether were performed three times, which resulted in the formation of methylammonium (MA) iodide (CH3NH3I). To prepare a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor, CH3NH3I, lead(II) chloride (PbCl2, Aldrich), and lead(II) iodide (PbI2, Aldrich) in a 4:1:1 molar ratio were dissolved in anhydrous DMF. Then, the prepared CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s to prepare the perovskite films. The other layers of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx PSC are the same as those of the CsPbI3 PSC except for the perovskite active layer.
Characterization
The XRD patterns (D8-Advance/Bruker-AXS) were obtained to study the structures and the crystal sizes of the perovskite materials. The UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained using a V-670 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The FE-SEM images were recorded to measure the thickness of each layer and to study the surface morphology. Contact-mode AFM (XE-100/PSIA) was used to measure the surface rms roughness. The current density–voltage characteristics of the PSCs were measured with a Keithley 2400 semiconductor parameter analyzer. The photocurrent of the PSCs was measured under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination using an Oriel 150 W solar simulator. The voltage was swept from 0 to 1 V at intervals of 100 steps with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. The maximum PCE for the conversion of solar radiation to electrical power was calculated as  where Voc is the open-circuit voltage, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, FF is the fill factor, and Pin is the illumination power. The impedance values of the PSCs were measured using an Iviumstat electrochemical interface and an impedance analyzer to investigate the change in the interfacial resistance as a function of the annealing temperature. The applied bias was varied from 0 to 0.6 V with 10 mV amplitude and the frequency range was changed from 100 kHz to 1 Hz under dark conditions at room temperature. From the measured data, the equivalent circuit element parameters were extracted using Zview equivalent circuit modeling software.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD data for the CsPbI3 layer after annealing at 80, 100, and 120 °C. The CsPbI3 layer was formed by directly depositing the mixture of CsI and PbI2 (1:1 molar ratio) in DMF solution onto the ITO substrates. No peaks were observed before the annealing process. After annealing the substrate on a hot plate under dark conditions (<0.1 ppm of O2 and H2O) for 10 min, two high-intensity peaks and a low-intensity peak were observed. The two intense peaks located at 14 and 28° correspond to the black phase of CsPbI3. The low-intensity peak observed at 20.5° arises from the strain in the crystal due to the HI additive which is consistent with the literature.29 The positions of the peaks did not change with the annealing temperature, but the peak intensity of CsPbI3 annealed at 100 °C was stronger than those obtained after annealing at 80 and 120 °C. This result indicates that CsPbI3 thin films with higher crystallinity could be obtained after the annealing process at 100 °C. Furthermore, the XRD peaks corresponding to the yellow phase of CsPbI3 and PbI2 were not found, suggesting that the thin film predominantly consisted of the black phase. In the case of the CsPbI3 film prepared without the HI additive, no peaks were observed even after a similar annealing process, suggesting that the crystal phase could not be formed due to the low annealing temperature. It has been reported that HI forms an intermediate compound HPbI3 with PbI2, and it increases the solubility of PbI2 in DMF. In addition, HI promotes the formation of small grains and stabilizes the black phase of CsPbI3 at low temperatures.32 Therefore, the XRD peaks of CsPbI3 were observed in the presence of the HI additive in the low-temperature annealing process. Fig. 2(b) shows the absorption spectra of the CsPbI3 film obtained after the annealing process. The absorption spectrum of CsPbI3 exhibiting the yellow phase before the annealing process is also shown as a reference. The Eg of the yellow phase was measured to be 2.81 eV. After annealing, the absorption area increased and the band gap decreased. The absorption band edge is constant at 733 nm regardless of the annealing temperature, indicating that the Eg of the annealed film is 1.69 eV which is adequate for the PSCs. The absorption areas of the film annealed at 100 and 120 °C are slightly larger than that annealed at 80 °C. This result suggested that the coverage of the CsPbI3 film was affected by the annealing temperature.

Fig. 3 shows the top-view FE-SEM images of the CsPbI3 layer at different annealing temperatures and durations. At the annealing temperature of 80 °C, the spots corresponding to the yellow phase of CsPbI3 were found even when the annealing time was extended from 30 to 70 min. It is believed that the annealing temperature of 80 °C was not sufficient to form the black phase of CsPbI3. After annealing the CsPbI3 film at 100 °C, most of the yellow spots disappeared regardless of the annealing time, suggesting that the heat applied at 100 °C is strong enough to transform the yellow phase of CsPbI3 into the black phase. However, the yellow spots reappeared after annealing at 120 °C. It was also observed that the number and the size of the yellow spots increased with the annealing time at 120 °C. The addition of more HI solution to the CsPbI3 precursor could maintain the black phase for a longer time, but it could not prevent the formation of the yellow phase at 120 °C. Therefore, the appearance of the yellow spots at 120 °C may be due to the evaporation of the HI solution. The HI acid was used to enhance the solubility of the CsPbI3 precursor for the formation of a uniform film, and to transform the yellow phase of the CsPbI3 film into the black phase at low temperatures.10,29,33 The yellow phase of CsPbI3 perovskite is not suitable for use as an active material in solar cells because of its wide band gap (2.81 eV).34 The ratio of the yellow phase (which hinders the cell performance) was the lowest at 100 °C. Therefore, it is expected that the PSCs with the CsPbI3 film annealed at 100 °C would exhibit the best PCE value.

Fig. 4 shows the top view FE-SEM images of the CsPbI3 layer on PEDOT:PSS after the annealing process. The coverage of CsPbI3 on PEDOT:PSS was calculated using ImageJ software. Fig. 4(a) shows the variation in the coverage rate of CsPbI3 on PEDOT:PSS as a function of the annealing time at 80 °C. The coverage rates were calculated to be around 90% irrespective of the annealing time. This result indicates that CsPbI3 could not cover the whole surface of PEDOT:PSS during the annealing process at 80 °C. Furthermore, it is clear that the annealing time does not affect the coverage rate of CsPbI3 on PEDOT:PSS. Hence, the variation in the coverage rate of CsPbI3 on PEDOT:PSS as a function of annealing temperature for 10 min was studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 4(b). It is evident that the coverage rates of CsPbI3 annealed at 80 and 90 °C were around 90% whereas those annealed at 100, 110 and 120 °C were almost 100%. These results are consistent with the absorption data shown in Fig. 2(b). The coverage of the CsPbI3 film plays a crucial role in the performance of PSC devices and therefore, the annealing of CsPbI3 at temperatures above 100 °C is necessary to optimize the PSC devices.

Fig. 5 shows the AFM images of CsPbI3 on PEDOT:PSS after the annealing process. The annealing time was fixed at 10 min. The rms roughness values were measured to be 3.75, 3.74, 3.03, 3.03, and 4.38 nm for samples annealed at 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 °C, respectively. The roughness value was the smallest for the samples annealed at 100 and 110 °C. At these annealing temperatures, the ratio of the yellow phase was reduced as shown in Fig. 3, indicating that the existence of the yellow phase in the CsPbI3 film affects the rms roughness. There was no change in the surface composition with the annealing temperature as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Therefore, it can be considered that the yellow phase in the CsPbI3 film adversely affects the PSC performance not only because of its wide band gap but also due to the temperature.

The current density–voltage characteristics of the CsPbI3 based PSC as a function of the annealing temperature are shown in Fig. 6(a). The annealing time for each temperature was fixed at 10 min. The Voc values were almost the same, 0.9 V, regardless of the annealing temperature. However, the Jsc values were 4.56, 6.01, 6.49, 6.15, and 5.19 mA cm−2 for the samples annealed at 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 °C, respectively. Consequently, the PCE values were 2.71, 3.92, 4.27, 3.83, and 2.32%, respectively, for the samples annealed at 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 °C. The variation in the work function of the CsPbI3 layers annealed at different temperatures and the schematic band diagram of the CsPbI3 based PSC are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The changes in the values of Jsc, FF, and PCE as a function of the annealing temperature are shown in Fig. 6(b). The J–V curves of the solar cells in reverse and forward modes are observed to be almost the same, indicating little hysteresis in these samples. These phenomena are in accordance with previous reports.10 The detailed characteristics of the PSCs at different annealing temperatures are summarized in Table 1. It is considered that the combination of low roughness, low yellow phase ratio, and 100% surface coverage of the CsPbI3 film annealed at 100 °C resulted in the highest PCE value. For the sake of optimization of the CsPbI3 layer thickness, the speed of the spin-coater was altered. Fig. 6(c) shows the current density–voltage curve of the CsPbI3 PSC at different values of rpm. The highest PCE of the PSC was 4.88% at 6000 rpm. The detailed characteristics of the PSCs under different spin-coating conditions are summarized in Fig. 6(d) and Table 2.

EIS measurements were performed on all devices in order to fully understand the charge transport characteristics at the interface between the active layer and the electrode after different annealing processes.35Fig. 7(a) shows the Nyquist plot of the CsPbI3 PSC annealed at 80, 100, and 120 °C with an applied bias of 0.6 V. The obtained results were fitted to the equivalent circuit model of the PSC, which is shown in the inset of Fig. 7(a). In general, a semicircle on the Nyquist plot is associated with the charge transfer across the electrode interface. Under dark conditions, the internal resistance of the solar cell is composed of sheet resistance (RSH) and charge transfer resistance (RCT). RSH represents the ohmic resistance of the electrodes and the bulk resistance in the active layer, which can be obtained from the starting point in the Nyquist plot. RCT is related to the interfacial resistance (at the electrode/selective charge carrier transporting layer interface, and at the selective charge carrier transporting layer/CsPbI3 layer interface), which can be obtained from the diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot.36 The constant phase element (CPE) indicates the non-ideal capacitor element which includes the surface roughness or porosity.37,38 In Fig. 7(a), the measured results shown as dots formed a semicircle for each sample with a different diameter, and were confirmed by the fitted results shown as solid lines. The high-frequency region of Fig. 7(a) is magnified in Fig. 7(b). The PSC based on the CsPbI3 film annealed at 100 °C exhibited the smallest semicircle in the Nyquist plot, suggesting that it has the lowest value of RCT. The extracted equivalent circuit element parameters are summarized in Table 3. As is expected, the RCT value of the PSC based on the CsPbI3 film annealed at 100 °C was the lowest, 3.570 kΩ, indicating a decreased charge transport resistance. The low value of RCT can be ascribed to the low yellow phase ratio, high surface coverage, and low rms roughness at the annealing temperature of 100 °C. Furthermore, the PSC annealed at 100 °C showed the lowest CPE value, indicating the lowest charge carrier accumulation at the interfaces and efficient extraction of the charge carriers. Therefore, the high PCE value of the PSC annealed at 100 °C can be attributed to the low charge transport resistance and low charge carrier accumulation. To make a clear comparison, the Nyquist plots were obtained at various applied bias voltages as shown in Fig. 7(c). The RCT values were extracted by equivalent circuit calculations. The value of RCT decreased as the applied bias increased which is similar to the cases of other solar cells reported in the literature.39,40 The value of RCT was the lowest at 100 °C and the highest at 80 °C at any applied bias voltage. This may be attributed to the presence of the yellow phase at 80 °C which increased the internal as well as the interfacial resistance.

Fig. 8(a) shows the current density–voltage curves of CsPbI3 and CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x based PSCs. The PCE of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x based PSCs is 8.05% which is higher than that of the CsPbI3 based PSC (5.38%). In order to compare the stability of the Cs-based cell with the CH3NH3-based cell, the samples were kept in air without encapsulation and the changes in the values of Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE were measured as shown in Fig. 8(b)–(e). The value of Voc was almost the same at 0.95 and 0.85 V, respectively, for the CsPbI3 and the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x based PSCs. However, the Jsc, FF, and efficiency values decreased with the keeping time. The Jsc values of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CsPbI3 based PSCs reduced from 13.9 to 8.31 mA cm−2 and from 8.26 to 6.68 mA cm−2, respectively. The decrease in the value of Jsc for CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x is larger than that for CsPbI3. The FF values of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CsPbI3 based PSCs also reduced from 0.69 to 0.61 and from 0.67 to 0.64, respectively. Therefore, the PCE values of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CsPbI3 reduced from 8.05 to 4.28% and from 5.38 to 3.98%, respectively. The loss ratios of the PCE for the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CsPbI3 based PSCs are 47 and 26%, respectively. It is reported that the intrinsic affinity of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x for moisture leads to its degradation under ambient conditions and eventually the formation of PbI2 or PbCl2 due to the loss of CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x.41 This result indicates that the stability of the CsPbI3 based PSC is better than that of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x based PSC.

Conclusions
The inorganolead perovskite compound CsPbI3 was applied as a visible-light sensitizer in PSCs. The CsPbI3 layer was formed by directly depositing the mixture of CsI and PbI2 (1:1 molar ratio) in DMF solution onto ITO substrates. After annealing the CsPbI3 layer on a hot plate at 100 °C under dark conditions for 10 min, two intense peaks were observed at 14 and 28° in the XRD spectra indicating the existence of the black phase of CsPbI3. Furthermore, the absorption band edge in the UV-vis absorption spectrum is shown to be 733 nm, indicating that the band gap of the annealed film is 1.69 eV which is adequate for the PSCs. FE-SEM studies indicated that most of the yellow spots disappeared after annealing at 100 °C, suggesting that the heat applied at 100 °C is strong enough to change the yellow phase of CsPbI3 to the black phase. The rms roughness value was the lowest (3.03 nm) for the samples annealed at 100 °C, indicating that the existence of the yellow phase in the CsPbI3 film affects the rms roughness. The PCE value of the CsPbI3 based PSC annealed at 100 °C is 4.88%. The RCT and CPE values of the CsPbI3 based PSC annealed at 100 °C were the lowest, indicating a decreased charge transport resistance and lower charge accumulation. Therefore, the high PCE value of the CsPbI3 based PSC annealed at 100 °C is attributed to the combination of the low yellow phase ratio, high surface coverage, low rms roughness, lower charge transport resistance and lower charge accumulation. The loss ratios of the PCE for the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x and CsPbI3 based PSCs after keeping in air are 47 and 26%, respectively, indicating that the stability of the CsPbI3 based PSC is better than that of the CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x based PSC. From these results, it can be concluded that the inorganic lead halide perovskite CsPbI3 is a potential candidate for solar cell applications.
