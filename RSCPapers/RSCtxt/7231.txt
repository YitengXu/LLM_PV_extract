    , Accepted 7th April 2014First published on 9th April 2014AbstractThe inorganic–organic perovskite is currently attracting a lot of attention due to its use as a light harvester in solar cells. The large absorption coefficients, high carrier mobility and good stability of organo-lead halide perovskites present good potential for their use as light harvesters in mesoscopic heterojunction solar cells. This work concentrated on a unique property of the lead halide perovskite, its function simultaneously as a light harvester and a hole conductor in the solar cell. A two-step deposition technique was used to optimize the perovskite deposition and to enhance the solar cell efficiency. It was revealed that the photovoltaic performance of the hole conductor free perovskite solar cell is strongly dependent on the depletion layer width which was created at the TiO2–CH3NH3PbI3 junction. X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that there were no changes in the crystallographic structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite over time, which supports the high stability of these hole conductor free perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the power conversion efficiency of the best cells reached 10.85% with a fill factor of 68%, a Voc of 0.84 V, and a Jsc of 19 mA cm−2, the highest efficiency to date of a hole conductor free perovskite solar cell.
Introduction
The search for alternative energy solutions is currently a leading research area and will remain so for the foreseeable future, and photovoltaics (PV) are a key technology for a sustainable energy supply. The basic requirement for PV devices is the charge separation of electrons and holes in a material, which absorbs the light, and the conductivity of these charges to different contacts.
A recent breakthrough was made by using a new light absorber, the inorganic–organic perovskite, in the solar cell. The inorganic–organic perovskite consists of an inorganic part, usually a divalent metal cation to satisfy the charge balancing. The organic part consists of an organic cation to form the three-dimensional perovskite structure.
The inorganic–organic perovskite has a direct band gap, large absorption coefficients1 and high carrier mobility,2,3 which present good potential for its use as a light harvester in mesoscopic heterojunction solar cells.
Several studies used the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite as a sensitizer in photoelectrochemical cells with a liquid electrolyte.4–6 However, the performance of these systems rapidly declined due to dissolution of the perovskite. This problem was solved by replacing the electrolyte with a solid state hole conductor.7 Moreover, the tin iodide-based perovskite CsSnI3 has been employed as a hole conductor together with N719 as a sensitizer in solid state dye-sensitized solar cells, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.5%.8 Several reports showed9–11 efficient hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells, based on a meso-superstructured organo-halide perovskite, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 10.9% to 12.3%.
A high open circuit voltage was demonstrated for these perovskite based solar cells, having Voc of 1.15 V and 1.3 V.12,13 Recently impedance spectroscopy was carried out on these high efficiency perovskite solar cells, the authors recognized charge accumulation in the absorber material (the perovskite) which derives from the capacitance of the devices.14 Good correlation between the calculated electronic and optical band gap and the experimental results was found using theoretical modeling of the perovskite based halides.15 In addition, the high efficiency achieved for the perovskite based solar cells was supported by measuring the long-range electron–hole diffusion length.16,17
Recently, more than 15% power conversion efficiency was reported. In one work a two step deposition technique of the perovskite was demonstrated18 while in another work a co-evaporation deposition technique on a flat surface was used.19 Besides this breakthrough, Etgar et al.20 reported on the use of hole conductor free perovskite solar cells. The authors demonstrated for the first time that the perovskite can function as a light harvester and as a hole conductor at the same time. In early work 5% efficiency was reported and recently this performance was improved to 8% efficiency for depleted hole conductor free perovskite solar cells.21 In addition a PCE of 10.49% was achieved for a hole conductor free perovskite solar cell.22 Elimination of the hole conductor can improve the stability, lower the cost and simplify the fabrication process.
In this research, we concentrated on using CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite as a light harvester and as a hole conductor simultaneously in the solar cell. We performed a complete study of several parameters, which influence the PV performance of these hole conductor free lead halide iodide perovskite solar cells. We optimized the use of the two-step deposition technique of the perovskite, and we have found a correlation between the depletion layer width at the TiO2–CH3NH3PbI3 junction and the power conversion efficiency observed. X-Ray diffraction analysis revealed that there is no change in the crystallographic structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite over time, indicating the high stability of these cells. Finally, the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved in this work was 10.85%, the highest efficiency to date of a hole conductor free perovskite solar cell.
Results and discussion
This work concentrates on the use of lead halide perovskite as a light harvester and as a hole conductor simultaneously in the solar cell. The solar cell structure and its energy level diagram are shown in Fig. 3A and B, respectively, which consists of a blocking layer followed by the deposition of mesoporous TiO2 film, perovskite film and gold as the back contact. The blocking layer has an important role as it improves the PV parameters of the solar cell. In this work, the blocking layer was fabricated by spin coating a solution of diluted titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) (TiDIP) in ethanol, which permitted more control of the blocking layer thickness and density. The influence of the blocking layer on the PV performance was investigated by changing the blocking layer thickness and concentration. Table 1 presents the PCE of cells made under different blocking layer conditions (spin velocity (rounds per minute (rpm)) and the TiDIP precursor concentration). In order to study the influence of the blocking layer conditions on the PV performance all the other parameters were held constant.

The best PCE was observed for a spin velocity of 1500 rpm and 0.15% volume fraction of TiDIP under the blocking layer conditions. Looking at the results, it was observed that for each concentration, there is an optimal spin velocity. At low concentrations, the best efficiency was observed at low spin velocity. The spin velocity determines the blocking layer thickness, so when using low TiDIP concentration, a thick blocking layer is preferred (i.e. low spin velocity). On the other hand, at a high concentration of TiDIP, the best efficiency was observed at high spin velocity. The high spin velocity enables achieving a thin, uniform blocking layer, so that a high TiDIP concentration can be used. In the case of high TiDIP concentration and low spin velocity, a thick and condensed blocking layer was formed resulting in low PV performance.
The deposition of the lead halide iodide perovskite on the mesoporous TiO2 was done based on the two-step deposition method (spin and dip) described earlier18 but with several modifications which assist in controlling the lead halide iodide perovskite deposition on the mesoporous TiO2. The first step was spinning PbI2 on the mesoporous TiO2 film and annealing at 70 °C, while the second step was dipping the PbI2 electrode into CH3NH3I solution. After PbI2 reacts with CH3NH3I, CH3NH3PbI3 was formed. An important step in this deposition technique is the wait time period after dropping the PbI2 on the mesoporous TiO2 film, before spinning. We investigated the wait time parameter and observed its influence on the PV parameters of these cells. The results are summarized in Fig. 1. The highest efficiency (8.0%) was achieved at a wait time of 3 minutes.
 Fig. 1  The current density and the efficiency of the cells versus the wait time (min) between dropping PbI2 until the beginning of the spinning. 
During 3 minutes of waiting time, PbI2 creates a uniform coating on the mesoporous TiO2 surface while a longer waiting time (5 min) causes evaporation of the PbI2's solvent, which could create a non-uniform coating of the PbI2 on the mesoporous TiO2 surface. Conversely, the coverage of the surface by PbI2 isn't complete during a too-short wait time.
The influence of the TiO2 film thickness was investigated by making hole conductor free perovskite based solar cells using different thickness of mesoporous TiO2 films while keeping the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film thickness constant (the same deposition parameters were used for the perovskite deposition). To achieve different TiO2 film thicknesses, the TiO2 paste was diluted by ethanol at various ratios. The various dilutions produced different thicknesses of TiO2 films as seen in Fig. 2A–E. The thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film was measured using the Dektak 150 profiler, and the results are shown in the Fig. 2E graph. Fig. 2A–D presents extra high resolution scanning electron microscopy (XHR-SEM) of the various TiO2 thicknesses in the complete set of thicknesses of TiO2–CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells. It can be observed that CH3NH3PbI3 formed an overlayer on top of the TiO2 film. Probably some of the CH3NH3PbI3 penetrated into the TiO2 film, however the thick overlayer of the CH3NH3PbI3 film (300 nm ± 50 nm) indicates that most of the perovskite stays on top of the TiO2 film. Table 2 summarizes the results obtained for the solar cells made with various TiO2 thicknesses. For each TiO2 thickness more than 5 cells were fabricated in order to investigate the reliability of the presented results. The highest efficiency was observed for cells made with mesoporous TiO2 film of 620 ± 25 nm thickness. In these cells, the current density and the open circuit voltage were higher than the other cells made with different thicknesses of TiO2. The lowest efficiencies were observed for the thick TiO2 film (750 ± 25 nm) and for the thin TiO2 film (400 ± 25 nm). In addition, the FF and the current density for these cells were also the lowest compared with the other TiO2 thicknesses.

To understand the reason for the difference in PV performance observed when using a variety of TiO2 film thicknesses, capacitance voltage measurements were performed. In our previous work,21 it was reported that a depletion layer is created in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film and in the TiO2 mesoporous film. This depletion layer assists in the charge separation and inhibits the back reaction of electrons from the TiO2 to the CH3NH3PbI3 film. To estimate the depletion region width, Mott Schottky analysis23 of the TiO2–CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction solar cells was performed.
The capacitance at the junction which is described in eqn (1) is calculated from the depletion approximation.24 The depletion approximation implies that there are no free carriers in the space charge region at the junction under investigation. (1)where C is the measured capacitance, A is the active area, V is the applied bias, ε is the static permittivity, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, q is elementary charge and N is the doping density of the donor. The static permittivity of CH3NH3PbI3 was measured and calculated to be 30.25,26 From the slope of the Mott Schottky plot in the linear regime, the net doping density of the CH3NH3PbI3 film can be calculated. Moreover, the intersection of the linear regime in the Mott Schottky plot with the x-axis determines the built-in voltage, which suppressed the back reaction of electrons from the TiO2 film to the CH3NH3PbI3 film.
The depletion width is calculated according to:27 (2)where Na and Nd are the doping densities of the acceptor and the donor, respectively. Literature values of doping density in nanoporous TiO2 start at Na = 1 × 1016 cm−3.28–30

Table 3 summarizes the calculated Wn, Wp, total depletion width (Wt) and the built-in potential (Vbi) for the various TiO2 film thicknesses.

The correlation between the power conversion efficiency for the various TiO2 film thicknesses and the depleted fraction of the TiO2 film can be observed in Fig. 4. In the case of the highest efficiency, the total depletion width (Wt) is the maximum and equals 395 nm; moreover, half of the TiO2 film is depleted (depleted fraction is equal to 0.49), suggesting that the depletion region indeed assists in the charge separation and suppresses the back reaction, and consequently contributes to the increase in the power conversion efficiency of the cells. For the low efficiencies, the Wt is the lowest, and the depleted fraction of TiO2 is around 0.1, which means that only 10% of the total TiO2 thickness is depleted. Furthermore, there is good agreement between the open circuit voltage and the built-in potential observed from the Mott Schottky plot. In conclusion there is a very good agreement between the depletion region width and the PCE observed.

Fig. 6A presents XRD diffraction of a fresh cell and the same cell (which stayed in the dark) after a month; the peaks in the figure are indexed according to ref. 25, while two third of the peaks belong to the orthorhombic structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, and one third belongs to the tetragonal structure of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Moreover the peaks are matched completely between the two measurements, suggesting that there is no change in the crystallographic structure of the perovskite over time, which indicates the high stability of these hole conductor free perovskite solar cells. Fig. 6B shows the reproducibility of the CH3NH3PbI3–TiO2 heterojunction solar cells made using the optimum conditions describe above (TiO2 thickness, wait time, blocking layer conditions). More than 45% of the cells show efficiencies above 8%, while more than 11% show efficiencies above 10%. The average power conversion efficiency is 7.7%.

Using the optimum conditions discussed in this paper, our best cell achieved a PCE of 10.85% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a FF of 68% and a Jsc of 19 mA cm−2. Its current density–voltage curve is presented in Fig. 7A. The corresponding IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 7B, it reaches its maximum of 88% at 400 nm–600 nm wavelengths and gradually drops at longer wavelength corresponding to its absorption spectrum. Without a hole conductor the charge carriers at the gold back contact aren't extracted efficiently, which influences the carrier collection at a longer wavelength (explains the decrease in the IPCE spectra from 600 nm wavelength). The integration of the IPCE spectra gives a current density of 18.3 mA cm−2 as shown in Fig. 7B, there is good agreement with the current density measured using the solar simulator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency reported for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite based solar cells without a hole transport material.

Conclusions
This work describes an in-depth study of the parameters influencing the PV performance of hole conductor free lead halide iodide solar cells. A two-step deposition technique of the perovskite was used, which assisted in achieving higher efficiencies. We have found a correlation between the depletion region width at the TiO2–CH3NH3PbI3 junction and the efficiency observed. The highest efficiency was achieved when half of the TiO2 film was depleted. It was observed from the XRD analysis that the crystallographic structure does not change over time which supports the high stability of these cells. The best PCE achieved in this study was 10.85% which is, to date, the highest efficiency of these hole conductor free perovskite solar cells.
Experimental
Method and device fabrication
CH3NH3I was synthesized as described earlier5 by reacting 30 mL of methylamine (40% in methanol, TCI) and 32.3 mL of hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 mL round bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The precipitate was recovered by putting the solution on a rotavap and carefully removing the solvents at 50 °C. The yellowish raw product of methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was washed with ethanol by stirring the mixture for 30 min. Then the mixture was filtered and washed with diethylether. The washing step was repeated three times. After filtration, the solid was collected and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
Device fabrication
The substrate of the device was a SnO2:F(FTO) conducting glass (15 Ω cm−1, Pilkington). A blocking layer was deposited on the FTO glass using a solution of titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate)(TiDIP, 75% in isopropanol, Aldrich) in ethanol. Various volumetric ratios (0.05%, 0.10%, 0.15%, 0.20%) of the TiDIP solution were spin coated and then annealed at 450 °C for 35 min. Various dilutions of titania paste (20 nm, dyesol) were prepared by diluting the titania paste with ethanol at different weight ratios. The TiO2 solution was spin coated and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min subsequent to TiCl4 treatment for 30 min at 70 °C and annealing at 500 °C for 30 min.
The synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3 on the TiO2 surface was carried out by a two-step deposition technique as described previously18 but with several modifications. At the beginning, PbI2 was dropped onto the TiO2 film and spin coated after various wait time periods (1 min, 1.5 min, 3 min, or 5 min) followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 min. In the second step, the cell was dipped into 10 mg ml−1 of CH3NH3I solution at 70 °C for 20 s, and then annealed at 70 °C for another 30 min. During the dip and the annealing, CH3NH3PbI3 was formed, indicated by the dark brown color of the electrode. Finally, the back contact was deposited by evaporating 50 nm of gold under a pressure of 5 × 10−6 Torr. The active area was 0.09 cm2.

Profiler. 
The thickness measurements of the TiO2 films were performed using a Veeco Dektak 150 profiler.


Extra high resolution scanning electron microscopy (XHR-SEM). 
Magellan XHR SEM was performed using a FEI (Field Emission Instruments), The Netherlands. The measurement conditions were 5 kV at a magnification of 100000.


X-ray diffraction. 
X-ray powder diffraction measurements were performed in grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) mode on the D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) with a goniometer radius of 217.5 mm, a secondary graphite monochromator, 2° Soller slits and a 0.2 mm receiving slit. XRD patterns within the range 5° to 60° 2θ were recorded at room temperature using CuKα radiation (l¼ 1.5418 Å) with the following measurement conditions: a tube voltage of 40 kV, a tube current of 40 mA, step-scan mode with a step size of 0.02° 2θ and a counting time of 1–3 s per step. The value of the grazing incidence angle was 2.5°.


Photovoltaic characterization. 
Photovoltaic measurements were made on a New Port system, composed of the Oriel I–V test station using an Oriel Sol3A simulator. The solar simulator is class AAA for spectral performance, uniformity of irradiance, and temporal stability. The solar simulator is equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp. The output power is adjusted to match AM1.5 global sunlight (100 mW cm−2). The spectral match classifications are IEC60904-9 2007, JIC C 8912, and ASTM E927-05. I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. Oriel IQE-200 was used to determine the monochromatic incident photon-to-electric current conversion efficiency. Under full computer control, light from a 150 W xenon arc lamp was focused through a monochromator in the 300–1800 nm wavelength range onto the photovoltaic cell under investigation. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined by IPCE (λ) = 12400 (Jsc/λφ), where λ is the wavelength, Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm−2), and φ is the incident radiative flux (mW cm−2). Photovoltaic performance was measured by using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.09 cm2.


Capacitance voltage measurements. 
The measurements were performed using a Metrohm Autolab system, equipped with a PGTSTAT302N potentiostat instrument. The frequency was 1 kHz at bias potentials between 0 and 0.9 V.
