Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2001, 3, 1699-1704Photooxidation of alkylphenothiazines in SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieves†Zhixiang Chang, R. M. Krishna, Jie Xu, Ranjit Koodali and Larry KevanDepartment of Chemistry, Uniersity of Houston, Houston, Texas 77204-5641, USAReceived 12th October 2000, Accepted 15th December 2000First published on 24th January 2001AbstractPhenothiazine
 derivatives were introduced into SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48 mesoporous molecular
 sieves by impregnation. Alkylphenothiazine cation radicals (PCn+) were generated by photooxidation within MCM-48 samples and characterized by EPR and diffuse reflectance UV–VIS spectroscopy.
 A series of VMCM-48 and AlMCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieves with different metal contents were synthesized
 hydrothermally and increased the PCn+ cation radical photoyield compared with SiMCM-48.
 The photooxidation efficiency to form PCn+ cation radicals increases in the order SiMCM-48<AlMCM-48<VMCM-48.
 Increasing the alkyl chain length affects the alkylphenothiazine cation radical
 photoyield and stability. PCn+ cation radicals are stable in MCM-48 samples at room temperature from
 several hours to several days. Mesoporous MCM-48 molecular sieves are shown to be effective heterogeneous
 hosts to achieve long-lived
 photoinduced
 electron transfer
 of PCn molecules at room temperature.IntroductionPhotochemical solar energy conversion based on artificial
 photoredox systems is an important and active research area
 because solar energy is an inexpensive and ever renewable
 energy source.1–4 The conversion and storage of solar energy
 requires transformation of abundant and low-cost raw
 materials like H2O, CO2 and N2 into fuels like H2, CH3OH,
 CH4 and NH3. Many studies in the field of solar photochemistry
 are devoted to the photoinduced cleavage of water into
 H2 and O2.1–6 For photoinduced electron transfer, a molecule
 adsorbs a photon of suitable energy and is converted to
 an electronically excited state which is a better oxidant or
 reductant than the ground state. Photoinduced electron transfer
 between such an excited state and a suitable reaction
 partner converts a fraction of the absorbed light energy into
 chemical energy.7
 Usually, the raw materials to be converted
 into a fuel cannot be electronically excited by visible light. For
 example, the electronic absorption of water occurs at 167 nm
 in the far-UV region. In such a case, the process must be
 mediated by a suitable chemical species called a photosensitizer.8
 Phenothiazine derivatives are good photosensitizers and efficient electron-donor molecules and can be
 photooxidized by near-UV irradiation to form alkylphenothiazine cation radicals, which can be characterized by
 EPR and optical absorption.9–12The efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer is generally
 limited by back electron transfer, so current research is oriented
 toward the design of efficient photoredox systems that can
 inhibit back electron transfer and lead to relatively stable
 charge separation between the electron donor and the electron
 acceptor.13–15 The back electron transfer rate is typically
 retarded in heterogeneous systems compared to a homoge
neous solution. The photoionization efficiency in organic
 assemblies is typically higher than that in homogeneous solution,
 but the photoinduced radicals are not stable at room
 temperature. However, photoinduced charge separation in
 porous inorganic materials such as zeolites16,17 and silica
 gel18 can achieve long lifetimes of photoinduced radical ions
 at room temperature.Zeolites have a relatively small pore size (typically ⩽13 Å)
 which has been claimed as a main drawback for the extensive
 use of zeolites as microporous reactors.19 Mesoporous
 materials like silica gel are typically amorphous with irregularly
 spaced pores with a broad size distribution. However,
 ordered M41S-type mesoporous molecular sieves20 possess
 uniform hexagonal (MCM-41) and cubic (MCM-48) pore
 systems ranging from 20 Å to more than 100 Å. MCM-41
 materials have been extensively studied, but MCM-48
 materials have been less studied, probably due to the difficulty
 of reliable synthesis.21,22 For potential applications, MCM-48
 with its three-dimensional channel system seems to be more
 advantageous than MCM-41 with one-dimensional channels,
 because three-dimensional channels allow faster diffusion and
 are more resistant to pore blocking. Tetrahedral Si(IV) in the
 MCM-48 framework can be replaced by other metal ions such
 as V(V),23 Al(III),24 Zr(IV)25 and Mn(II).26 This makes it possible
 to modify the MCM-48 framework to enhance the
 photoionization efficiency of incorporated molecules such as
 alkylphenothiazine derivatives (PCn).In this research, a series of aluminium and vanadium-containing
 MCM-48 molecular sieves with different Al and V
 contents have been hydrothermally synthesized to act as heterogeneous
 hosts for photoinduced electron transfer from
 PCn. The photoinduced PCn+ cation is characterized by EPR and
 diffuse reflectance (DR) UV–VIS spectroscopy. V5+ in VMCM-48
 acts as an electron acceptor because V4+ can be observed
 by EPR after photoirradiation. The PCn+ photoyields
 increase in the order SiMCM-48<AlMCM-48<VMCM-48,
 indicating that framework modification by 
incorporating
 aluminium and vanadium into MCM-48 enhances
 the electron-accepting ability of the MCM-48 framework.ExperimentalMaterialsThe
 following chemicals were used without further purification: cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Aldrich),
 aluminium sulfate hexadecahydrate (Fluka), tetraethylorthosilicate
 (TEOS, Acros), 35 wt.% aqueous solution of
 tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, Alfa), vanadyl
 sulfate hydrate (Alfa) and vanadium (V) oxide (Aldrich).
 Deionized water was used throughout the syntheses and a 125
 cm3 Teflon beaker was used for crystallization.Synthesis
 of SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48SiMCM-48
 and AlMCM-48 were hydrothermally synthesized.26,27
 We found that MCM-48 samples prepared with
 TEAOH instead of NaOH have higher crystallinity. In a
 typical AlMCM-48 synthesis, 15 g of 2 M TEAOH was added
 to a mixture of 136 g of 10 wt.% CTAB and 120 g of water.
 After stirring for about 10 min, the required amount of 0.088
 M aluminium sulfate solution was added to this solution and
 stirred for 10 min. Finally, 15 ml of TEOS was added to the
 above solution and stirred for 1 h. The molar composition of
 the final gel was 1 Si:(0.005–0.02) Al:0.58 TEAOH:154
 H2O. The gel was heated at 373 K for 72 h to obtain the
 product. The product was filtered, thoroughly washed with
 deionized water, and dried at 353 K overnight. The as-synthesized material was calcined in flowing nitrogen while
 raising the temperature slowly to 823 K and then in flowing
 oxygen at 823 K for 10 h. These calcined samples are labeled
 AlMCM-48(n), where n indicates the Si/Al ratio. The calcined
 material was cooled to 573 K and put in a dessicator to
 prevent water adsorption from ambient air.For synthesis of VMCM-48 and SiMCM-48, 10 ml of tetraethylorthosilicate
 was added to a mixture of 87 g of 10 wt.%
 CTAB solution and 10 ml of 2 M TEAOH and stirred for
 several minutes. When the above solution became cloudy, different amounts of vanadium sulfate dissolved in 5 ml of water
 were added. The timing is crucial to ensure simultaneous
 coprecipitation. The molar composition of the final gel was 1
 Si:
(0.00–0.30) V:(0.46–0.92) TEAOH:120 H2O. The gel
 was heated at 373 K for 72 h. The as-synthesized samples were
 dried and calcined as described above. These calcined samples
 are termed VMCM-48(n), where n indicates the Si/V ratio.Sample
 preparation for photoirradiation and measurementMethylphenothiazine
 (Aldrich) was incorporated into
 MCM-48 samples by impregnation. For impregnation, 0.1 g
 of the sample was immersed in 1 ml of 10−2 M PCn
 in C6H6
 overnight, and the solvent was then removed by flowing nitrogen
 through the samples for about 40 min. The loading of PCn
 in MCM-48 was 40 μmol g−1 of sample. For EPR measurements
 the sample powder was filled into 2 mm id × 3 mm od Suprasil
 quartz tubes to about 20 mm in height. The tube was connected
 to a vacuum line and evacuated to about 1 × 10−4 Torr.
 Then the samples were sealed in the tube under vacuum. For
 DR UV–VIS measurement the sample powder was put into
 a cylindrical quartz sample cell (19 mm diameter × 1 mm path
 length) which was evacuated to about 10−4 Torr and sealed.
 All the samples were handled in the dark to minimize exposure
 to visible light.X-Ray
 powder diffraction patterns were recorded on a
 Philips PW1840 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, 25 mA)
 with a 0.025° step size and 1 s step time over the range 1.5<2θ/degrees<10.
 The samples were prepared as thin 
layers on aluminium slides. The elemental composition of the samples
 was analyzed by a JEOL JXA-8600 electron microprobe
 with a beam diameter of 20 nm with resolution of 2.5 eV.
 Five or more randomly selected spots on the samples were averaged.
 The EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature
 at X-band frequency using a Bruker ESP 380 spectrometer
 with 100 kHz field modulation and microwave power
 low enough to avoid saturation. The photoproduced PCn+
 radical yields were determined by subtracting the EPR intensity
 of any dark reaction from that of the photoirradiated samples
 by double integration of the EPR spectra using the ESP 380
 software. The DR UV–VIS spectra were recorded before
 and after different times of photoirradiation at room temperature
 using a Perkin-Elmer model 330 spectrophotometer
 with an integrating sphere accessory.N2
 adsorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a
 Micromeritics Gemini 2375 analyzer. Prior to adsorption,
 samples were dehydrated at 623 K for 5 h. The specific area,
 ABET, was determined from the linear part of a BET plot
 (P/P0
= 0.05–0.30). The pore size distribution was calculated
 using the adsorption branches of the N2
 adsorption isotherms
 and the Barret–Joyer–Halenda (BJH) formula.28The evacuated PC1/SiMCM-48, PC1/AlMCM-48 and
 PC1/VMCM-48 samples were irradiated with a 300 W
 Cermax xenon lamp (ILC-LX 300 UV) at room temperature.
 The light was passed through a 10 cm water filter and a
 Corning No. 7-51 glass filter, which passes light of 320
 nm ± 30 nm. Every sample was irradiated in a quartz dewar
 that was rotated at 4 rpm to ensure even irradiation of the
 samples. The photoproduced PCn+ radicals were identified by EPR and UV–VIS spectroscopy.ResultsSamplesThe
 powder X-ray diffraction patterns of as-synthesized
 SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48 samples are shown
 in Fig. 1 and 2. The pattern for MCM-48 samples consists of
 several distinguishable Bragg peaks which can be indexed to
 different (h k l) reflections. These reflections verify the presence
 of a cubic phase.29
 Electron microprobe analysis shows that
 vanadium and aluminium in VMCM-48 and AlMCM-48 are
 uniformly distributed. Table 1 shows the BET surface areas,
 Si/V ratios, Si/Al ratios, and the pore sizes of SiMCM-48,
 AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48. Fig. 1  XRD patterns of as-synthesized SiMCM-48 and AlMCM-48.  Fig. 2  XRD patterns of as-synthesized VMCM-48.

 of the specific surface area and the mesopore size distribution.
 The N2 adsorption isotherms for calcined MCM-48 samples
 are type IV adsorption isotherms, typical of mesoporous
 solids with H2 hysteresis.30 At a relative pressure P/P0
 between 0.35 and 0.45, the isotherm exhibits a sharp inflection
 characteristic of capillary condensation within the mesopores.
 The sharpness of this step reflects the uniform pore size in
 these materials. The corresponding BJH plots of the derivative
 of the pore diameter (dV/dD) s. the pore diameter are calculated
 and show very narrow pore size distributions. The BET
 surface areas were calculated with a 16.2 Å cross-sectional
 area for N231 and are larger than 1400 m2 g−1 for all samples,
 indicating that they have high crystallinity.DR spectra in the UV–VIS region were obtained to characterize
 the structure of V in VMCM-48. It is known that the
 charge transfer energy is strongly influenced by the number of
 ligands on the central ion and thus gives information on the
 coordination of V.32,33 As the number of ligands on V
 decreases from 6 to 4, the adsorption bands shift to shorter
 wavelength, and isolated tetrahedral V5+ shows an absorption
 band at 230∽300 nm.34 The broad charge transfer band near
 450 nm is characteristic of the DR spectrum of V2O5 (Fig. 3F)
 and has been attributed to charge transfer to a delocalized
 acceptor site, such as to chains of VO6 units. Fig. 3  Diffuse reflectance UV–VIS spectra of (A) VMCM-48(33), (B) VMCM-48(120), (C) VMCM-48(180), (D) VMCM-48(240), (E) VMCM-48(540) and (F) V2O5. Since as-synthesized VMCM-48 does not show a V4+ EPR
 signal and the vanadium source added to the synthesis gel is a
 V4+ salt, it seems clear that the V4+ ions are oxidized to V5+
 ions during synthesis. The DR UV–VIS spectra of calcined
 MCM-48 samples with different V contents are shown in Fig.
 3. The UV–VIS spectra of the VMCM-48 samples have a
 broad band at 230∽340 nm with a maximum at ∽260 nm
 for VMCM-48(33) and at ∽240 nm for lower vanadium contents.
 V5+
 may exist in a less distorted tetrahedral site at the
 highest vanadium content (Si/V = 33).35 It is noted that the
 colors of all the VMCM-48 samples are white after calcination
 (dehydrated). After exposure of calcined VMCM-48 to
 ambient (hydrated) air the color changes rapidly from white to
 bright yellow and then orange indicating rapid hydration.
 VMCM-48 becomes white again upon dehydration. The tendency
 of an isolated tetrahedral V5+ to increase its coordination
 with available water molecules has been described.35 It
 is now generally agreed that the color change is due to water
 adsorption on V5+ centers, causing tetrahedral V5+ to
 become octahedral V5+. It can thus be concluded that V is
 incorporated into a tetrahedral framework position in
 VMCM-48.24,34–37PCn+
 formation by EPR and DR UV–VIS spectroscopyThe
 EPR spectra from photoinduced PCn+ in SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48
 and VMCM-48 after 20 min photoirradiation with
 λ>320 nm at room temperature are shown in Fig. 4. The
 samples show EPR signals of PCn+ at g
= 2.005 with incompletely
 resolved hyperfine structure.38 In addition to the EPR
 signal of PCn+ cation, PCn/VMCM-48(33) samples also give
 two axially symmetric sets of eight EPR lines originating from
 VO2+ coupled to its own nuclear spin (51V, I
= 7/2, natural
 abundance 99.8%) after photoirradiation. The EPR parameters
 are g‖
= 1.92, A‖
= 195 G, g⊥
= 2.00 and A⊥
= 65 G,
 where A is the hyperfine coupling constant. The g values and
 hyperfine coupling constants are typical of vanadyl VO2+ complexes
 with square pyramidal coordination.36 The SiMCM-48,
 AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48 samples without PCn give
 no EPR signals after photoirradiation. The DR UV–VIS spectra
 of PCn/AlMCM-48(60) before and after irradiation at room temperature are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. Before irradiation,
 the DR spectra show a strong absorption in the UV region
 which is assigned to PCn within AlMCM-48. After different
 UV irradiation times, the absorption spectrum in the 
visible range is the same as that of PCn+ cation radical in liquid,
 silica gels, layered material and zeolites.38–42 Similar behavior
 is observed in all MCM-48 samples. This shows that some
 stable PCn+ radicals are produced by 320 nm irradiation
 at room temperature and confirm the photoionization of PCn into
 PCn+ in AlMCM-48(60). Fig. 4  EPR
 spectra of photoinduced PCn+ cation radical in SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48(60), and VMCM-48(33) after 20 min irradiation with 320 nm at room temperature.  Fig. 5  DR UV–VIS spectra of photoinduced PC1+ radical in AlMCM-48(60) before and after different irradiation times with 320 nm at room temperature.  Fig. 6  DR UV–VIS spectra of photoinduced PC6+ and PC16+
 radicals in AlMCM-48(60) before and after different irradiation times with 320 nm at room temperature. Photoyields in SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48After removal of the organic template by calcination in
 oxygen at 823 K, SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48
 showed no EPR signal at room temperature or 77 K.
 However, SiMCM-48 and AlMCM-48 samples impregnated
 with PC1 show a weak EPR signal of PC1+ and VMCM-48 samples
 showed a stronger EPR signal of PCn+. So, some dark
 reaction occurs which is largest in VMCM-48.Fig.
 7 and 8 show an increase in the EPR intensities of
 SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48 impregnated with
 PCn with irradiation time. The EPR signal increases rapidly
 during the first 5 min and reaches a plateau in about 20 min.
 An irradiation time of 20 min was selected for comparative
 photoyield and stability studies. The low loadings (0.01 M) of
 PCn molecules correspond to maximal photoyields. The 0.01
 M loadings cover about 3% of the surface area of SiMCM-48,
 AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48. The AlMCM-48 samples turn
 pink in color after irradiation, which is characteristic of PC1+ cation38
 which confirms the photoionization of PC1 into PC1+.
 PC1/SiMCM-48 produces only a weak PC1+ EPR signal.
 PC1/AlMCM-48 samples give higher photoyields than PC1/SiMCM-48,
 and lower photoyields compared with PC1/VMCM-48
 as shown in Fig. 9. The photoyields in AlMCM-48
 increases with increasing Al content as shown in Fig.
 10 and the photoyield in VMCM-48 increases with increasing
 V content as shown in Fig. 11. The color of fresh evacuated
 PC1/VMCM-48 is pink before irradiation and turns
 dark brown after irradiation. After 20 min photoirradiation
 PC1+ radicals decay 50% for SiMCM-48 and 12% for 
AlMCM-48 after 24 h at room temperature. PC1+ radicals in VMCM-48
 do not decay after 48 h at room temperature. Fig. 7  Increase
 of EPR intensities of PCn+ radical at room temperature s. 320 nm irradiation time for SiMCM-48 and AlMCM-48(60).  Fig. 8  Increase of EPR intensities of PCn+ radical at room temperature s. 320 nm irradiation time for VMCM-48(33). Note the large dark reaction.  Fig. 9  PC1+ net photoyields after dark reaction in SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48(60) and VMCM-48(33) after 20 min irradiation with 320 nm at room temperature.  Fig. 10  PC1+ net photoyields after dark reaction in AlMCM-48 s. Al content after 20 min irradiation with 320 nm at room temperature.  Fig. 11  PC1+ net photoyields after dark reaction in VMCM-48 s. V content after 20 min irradiation with 320 nm at room temperature. The effects of the alkyl chain length (PC1 to PC16) on the
 photoyield of PCn+ in AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48 samples are shown in Fig. 7 and 8. The diameters of PC1, PC6, and PC16
 molecules are about 6.5, 11 and 20 Å, respectively. The photoyields
 decrease with increasing alkyl chain length. The stability
 of the PCn+
 radicals increases from PC1 to PC16 in AlMCM-48
 and VMCM-48 from several hours to several days.
 Therefore, the photoyield and stability of PCn+ cation radicals
 are affected by the alkyl chain length and the metal ion.DiscussionPhenothiazine
 derivatives are known to undergo slow oxidation
 by single step electron transfer in solution into their
 respective cation radicals.39 The EPR and DR UV–VIS
 results clearly confirm the photo-oxidation of PCn molecules
 into PCn+ cation radicals in SiMCM-48, AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48
 by 320 nm irradiation at room temperature. The
 PC1+
 photoyield increases in the order SiMCM-48<AlMCM-48<VMCM-48
 as shown in Fig. 9. The surface hydroxy
 groups on silica gel have been suggested to serve as electron
 acceptors.41 The SiMCM-48 and AlMCM-48 frameworks
 may involve surface hydroxy groups as likely electron acceptors.
 SiMCM-48 has only terminal Si–OH hydroxy groups,
 and lacks acidic sites and ion-exchange capacity.25
 In
 other work, surface hydroxy groups on silica gel have been suggested
 to act as electron acceptors to form hydrogen atoms
 that are trapped at 77 K in large pore silica (>40 Å) and are detected
 by EPR. The hydrogen atom signal decreases with smaller
 pore size.38 Since MCM-48 has a small pore size (∽22 Å), the
 lack of trapped hydrogen atoms is consistent with earlier
 studies on silica gel.38 Isomorphous substitution of Al into the
 framework of MCM-48 creates acidic sites.20,21 The PC1+ photoyield
 in AlMCM-48 increases with increasing Al content, probably
 because acidic sites in AlMCM-48 are better electron
 acceptors than terminal Si–OH hydroxy groups.Samples
 of VMCM-48 impregnated with PC1
 molecules show
 a stronger dark reaction to form PC1+ compared with PC1/SiMCM-48 and PC1/AlMCM-48 because V5+ ions in VMCM-48 oxidize
 some PC1 to form V4+ ion consistent with V4+
 observation
 by EPR after photoirradiation. This supports the hypothesis
 that V5+ ions in VMCM-48 do accept electrons from
 PC1 to enhance the PC1+ photoyield. The EPR intensities
 of both V4+ and PC1+ radical increase with irradiation time,
 supporting the hypothesis that V5+ ion is an electron acceptor.
 The increase of PC1+ spin concentration is smaller than that of
 V4+ spin concentration, probably because of secondary reactions
 of PC1+ cation radicals.17,38The
 photoyield of PC1/VMCM-48 increases with V content.
 Fig. 7 and 8 show that the initial slopes for PC1+ increase
 in the order SiMCM-48 (0.02 s−1)<AlMCM-48(0.07 s−1)<VMCM-48(0.57 s−1). The photo-oxidation of PC1 molecules in
 mesoporous MCM-48 molecular sieves is more efficient than
 in silica gel and less efficient than in AlPO-5 molecular sieves.17,38The
 absorption near 700 nm in the UV–VIS spectra (Fig. 6) of
 PC6/AlMCM-48(60) and PC16/AlMCM-48(60) might suggest
 that some photoproduced PCn+ radicals changed to (PCn)22+
 or other species.38 The photoyield of PCn+ cation radicals decreases
 as the alkyl chain length increases from PC1 to PC16 in
 MCM-48, AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48 as shown in Fig. 7 and 8.
 A possible explanation is that phenothiazine derivatives with
 longer chain length have decreasing reactivity toward oxidizing
 agents.43,44 However, the stability of PCn+ cation radicals
 increases from PC1 to PC16. This trend in stability can be explained
 in terms of an increased inductive effect 
in PCn+ cation radicals
 as a function of longer alkyl chain length.39,45
 PCn+
 cation radicals are more stable in VMCM-48 than in MCM-48
 and AlMCM-48 probably because VO2+ is stable
 and it is difficult for it to transfer an electron back to PC1+.ConclusionsPCn
 molecules trapped in AlMCM-48 and VMCM-48 can be photoionized
 efficiently. The EPR and diffuse reflectance UV–VIS
 results clearly confirm the photooxidation of PCn
 into
 PCn+ in MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieves. The photoyield
 and stability of the PCn+ cation radicals depend on their
 alkyl chain length. The PCn+ radical photoyield increases
 in the order SiMCM-48<AlMCM-48<VMCM-48. The PCn+ radical
 is more stable in VMCM-48 and AlMCM-48 in comparison
 with SiMCM-48. AlMCM-48 has a higher PCn+ radical
 photoyield than does SiMCM-48 probably because incoporation
 of Al into the MCM-48 framework creates the acidic sites
 which act as better electron acceptors than the terminal Si–OH hydroxy
 groups in SiMCM-48. The V5+ sites in the VMCM-48 framework
 enhance the electron-accepting ability of the framework
 by reduction of V5+ to V4+. MCM-48 mesoporous molecular
 sieves seem attractive for solar energy conversion and storage.ReferencesK. Kalyanasundaram, Photochemistry
