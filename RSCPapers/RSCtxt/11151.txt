    , Accepted 23rd July 2015First published on 28th July 2015AbstractEstablishing heterostructures, as a good strategy to improve gas sensing performance, has been studied extensively. In this research, In2O3-composite SnO2 nanorod (ICTOs) heterostructures have been prepared via electrospinning, followed by calcination. It is found that In2O3 can improve the carrier density and oxygen deficiency of SnO2. In particular, the 3ICTO (Sn:In atom ratio of 25:0.3) nanorods with special particle distributions show an excellent sensing response towards different concentrations of NOx at room temperature. The highest sensing response is up to 8.98 for 100 ppm NOx with a fast response time of 4.67 s, which is over 11 times higher than that of pristine SnO2 nanorods at room temperature and the lowest detection limit is down to 0.1 ppm. More significantly, it presents good stability after 30 days for NOx of low concentration (0.1 ppm and 0.5 ppm). In addition, the rational band structure model combined with the surface depletion model which describe the NOx gas sensing mechanism of 3ICTO are presented. The 3ICTO nanorods may be promising in the application of gas sensors.
Introduction
The heterojunction theory was put forward in the 1930s for the first time.1 After that, a series of applications of heterojunctions in nanomaterials have been widely researched due to their super injection of carriers. From 2005 to now, a large number of semiconductor–semiconductor heterostructural nanomaterials (TiO2–SnO2,2 ZnO–TiO2,3 CuO–ZnO4etc.) have been extensively investigated and used in many fields, including solar cells,5 Li-ion batteries,6 diode devices, photoelectrochemical cells,7 and sensors.8,9 In particular, an electron depletion layer or an accumulation layer will form between the interfaces for the equilibrium condition of the heterojunctions.10 As is well known, the heterojunctions act as a lever in electron transfer through which electron transfer is facilitated or restrained, resulting in the enhanced sensing properties of the sensor.11 Therefore, establishing heterostructures12,13 in sensor materials has long been regarded as the best strategy.
Among the semiconductor–semiconductor heterostructural nanomaterials, In2O3–SnO2 nanomaterials attract much interest in particular due to the low cost of SnO2 species and the high conductivity of In2O3. Additionally, according to previous reports, In2O3–SnO2 nanofibers showed high sensitivity to methanol at 280 °C14 and In2O3–SnO2 composites coated with La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 nanoparticles presented an excellent response to trimethylamine at 80 °C.15 Other studies16,17 also show that In2O3 is sensitive to the detection of low concentrations of oxidising gases. All the above investigations suggest that establishing In2O3–SnO2 heterojunctions in SnO2 nanomaterials can enhance the sensing properties of SnO2. However, it still does not reach the room temperature (RT) level with high response. Therefore, it would be a worthy research topic to synthesize excellent In2O3–SnO2 heterostructural sensing materials at RT.
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are major air pollutants generated from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen in the air during combustion processes, such as power plants and automotive engines. They can cause acid rain and photochemical smog, and even endanger life when the NOx concentration exceeds 25 ppm.18–20 Therefore, it can be said, gas sensors of NOx play critical roles in monitoring environmental pollution, controlling industrial production, and for ensuring household and human security.21–23 However, there are few literature reports about In2O3–SnO2 sensors which detect low concentrations of NOx (0.1 ppm) at RT.
In this work, we suggest a one-step method for the fabrication of In2O3-composite SnO2 nanorod (ICTOs) heterostructures with different atom ratios by directly annealing electrospun composite fibers obtained from a poly(vinylpyrrolidone) solution. The In2O3 additive might control and stabilize the SnO2 nanoparticles. The enhanced sensing performance of the ICTOs towards NOx is investigated, reaching a detection limit as low as 0.1 ppm at RT. Moreover, excellent response and a fast response time are also achieved. The distribution of SnO2 in the ICTOs is uniform. SnO2 nanoparticles around In2O3 might form more heterojunctions, resulting in more electron transfer channels, increased oxygen deficiency and enhanced sensing performance.
Experimental
Materials
All reagents (analytical-grade purity) were used as purchased without further purification. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW = 1300000) and indium nitrate were obtained from Shanghai Reagent Co. The tin(II) chloride dihydrate was purchased from Xilong Chemical Co. Ltd. N,N-Dimethylformamide and ethanol were obtained from Beijing Chemical Co. Ltd.
Synthesis of In2O3-composite SnO2 nanorods (ICTOs)
The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.386 g PVP in 4.5 mL of ethanol and DMF. Then, In(NO3)3 and SnCl2·2H2O of different masses were added to the precursor solution. The mixed solution was stirred vigorously at RT for 8 h. Finally, the transparent solution was transferred into a 10 ml syringe with a capillary tip (0.8 mm in diameter) for spinning. A high voltage of 15 kV was applied at the spinneret by a direct-current power supply (DFS-001, Beijing KAIWEIXIN Technology Ltd, China). The solution was pushed out of the spinneret with a feeding rate of 0.004 mL min−1, and the In2O3-composite SnO2 nanofibers (NFs) were collected using aluminium foil at RT. The NFs were treated at 550 °C for 4 h in air with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. The In2O3-composite SnO2 nanorods (ICTOs) with atom ratios of SnO2 and In2O3 of about 25:0.1, 25:0.3 and 25:0.5 were named 1ICTO, 3ICTO and 5ICTO, respectively.
Material characterizations
The crystal phase of the samples was characterized using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D/max-IIIB-40 KV, Japan, Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å). The morphology and structures were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHIS-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100). X-Ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded with a VGESCALAB MK II using Mg-Kα (1253.6 eV) achromatic X-ray radiation. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the products was measured by N2 adsorption–desorption (TriStar II 3020). The pore-size distribution was calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky plot measurements (M–S) were carried out using an electrochemical working station (CHI660C, Shanghai, China) in a half-cell setup configuration at RT. M–S analysis was performed in a conventional three-electrode cell in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution with a frequency of 1 kHz. A Pt sheet and a saturated calomel electrode were used as the counter and the reference electrode, respectively. In the EIS measurement, the range of frequency was 0.01–100 kHz and the excitation amplitude was 2 mV. In order to obtain an asymmetrical Schottky contact at the interface between the ICTOs and the Au electrode, the ICTOs were mounted on the Au electrode. Current–voltage characteristics (Ids–Vds) were performed on ICTO devices using a Keithley 4200 source meter. Ids–Vds curves of the ICTO devices were measured by ramping the drain–source voltage Vds and simultaneously by recording the drain–source current Ids (the gate voltage Vg = 0.1). The diagram of the Ids–Vds measurement device is shown in Fig. S1.†
Gas sensing tests
An interdigital Au electrode was selected for gas sensing detection and the electrode spacing was 2 μm. A suspension was formed by dispersing the samples ultrasonically in ethanol for 30 s. Then the suspension was coated onto the interdigitated electrode to form a sensitive film. Finally, it was treated at 250 °C for 1 h in Ar to obtain a thin film gas sensor.
The sensor was installed into a test chamber with an inlet and an outlet (Fig. S2†). The chamber was flushed with air for 2 min to remove any contaminants from the flask and also to stabilize the film before testing by opening valve 1. A syringe was used to inject the required volume of NOx into the chamber through valve 3 and the chamber was purged with air through valve 4 to recover the sensor resistance. The resistance measurements of the sensor were carried out at room temperature and the relative humidity (RH) was controlled by an air moistener through valve 2 to achieve the desired humidity of 26%.
The sensor response was defined as the ratio (R0 − RN)/RN, where R0 and RN are the resistances in air and NOx gas, respectively. The response time was defined as the time required for the variation in resistance to reach 85% of the equilibrium value after a test gas was injected.
Results and discussion
Composition and morphology
Morphology and microstructures of the ICTOs were examined by SEM. Fig. 1A shows the SEM image of the pristine SnO2, which is composed of nanorods (NRs) with an average diameter of 474 nm. The average diameter of 1ICTO is 463 nm, similar to the pristine SnO2 (Fig. S3A†). However, the average diameter of the 3ICTO is about 230 nm, which is obviously smaller (Fig. 1B). This might be related to the In3+ ion, which promotes the reduction of diameter. Since In3+ could promote the nucleation of SnO2 crystals,24 the SnO2 NPs doped by In3+ tend to aggregate and form nanorods with a smaller diameter during thermal treatment. Meanwhile, the higher aggregation of SnO2 crystals also results in the formation of larger nanoparticles that are inclined to be exposed on the surface of the ICTO NRs.25 This makes the surface of the nanorods rough. Hence, the 5ICTO NRs with a rough surface are obtained when the content of In3+ is increased, as shown in Fig. S3B.†Fig. 1C shows the powder XRD patterns of the ICTO samples. All the diffraction peaks can be well assigned to SnO2 (JCPDS, no. 41-1445). There is no shift and no new phases of indium and tin are observed with an increasing amount of In2O3 for the ICTOs. This is mainly because the ionic sizes of Sn4+ and In3+ are 0.069 nm and 0.080 nm26 with a small substitutability.27 Nevertheless, in contrast with the pristine SnO2, the diffraction peak intensity of the ICTOs is decreased obviously. Thus, we deduced that the crystallinity of the SnO2 structure was influenced by the presence of In2O3 in the structure. This conclusion has been proved by the results of TEM. Furthermore, no In2O3 diffraction peaks have been observed in the XRD which may be because the content of In2O3 was too small to be detected.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the BET pore-size distribution were also investigated. Fig. 1D shows that the BET surface area of 3ICTO is about 26.46 m2 g−1, which is about twice that of the pristine SnO2 (12.04 m2 g−1). The dominant pore sizes of 3ICTO and pristine SnO2 are 29.55 nm (inset of Fig. 1D) and 42.25 nm, respectively. The enhanced surface area of 3ICTO is mainly attributed to the decreased pore size. Moreover, the BET data of 1ICTO and 5ICTO are 23.55 m2 g−1 and 19.02 m2 g−1, respectively. Notably, the surface area of 3ICTO is the highest among all the samples.

Fig. 2(A–D) show the TEM/HRTEM images of the pristine SnO2 and 3ICTO. It is clear to see that the metal oxide NPs are connected with each other, which form necks between the grains. To the best of our knowledge, these necks are favourable for electron transfer.28Fig. 2A presents a representative TEM micrograph of the pristine SnO2, which clearly displays NRs with an average diameter of 474 nm. The lattice fringes of pristine SnO2 with d-spacings of 0.331 and 0.260 nm are indexed to the (110) and (101) planes, respectively (as shown in Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C shows the 3ICTO nanorods with diameters of about 230 nm, and lots of pores among the particles (proved by Fig. S4†). Fig. 2D shows that the interplanar distance of 0.253 nm can be indexed to the (400) plane of cubic In2O3. The distribution of SnO2 particles in 1ICTO is not uniform (Fig. S5A†) and the SnO2 NPs in 5ICTO are relatively large (Fig. S5B†). Compared with 1ICTO and 5ICTO, the SnO2 NPs of 3ICTO are uniformly aggregated around the In2O3 NPs, forming more necks. This special structure is advantageous to the gas-sensing properties.29 To examine the composition of 3ICTO, the element maps of 3ICTO are generated as shown in Fig. S6A.† The result indicates that there is elemental In in the nanorods. Fig. S6B† gives the nanoparticle diameter distribution of 3ICTO. The size of the SnO2 NPs is in the range of 2–20 nm, dominated at about 9–10 nm (Fig. S4†). The inset in Fig. S6B† shows a SAED pattern taken from the corresponding area. The SAED of the nanoparticles is consistent with tetragonal rutile SnO2 with strong ring patterns due to the (110), (101), (200), (211) and (112) planes. The surface compositions of the pristine SnO2 and ICTOs were characterized by XPS. From the full XPS spectra (Fig. S7A†), the In3d peak can be detected, confirming the existence of the In component in the samples which corresponds to the results of TEM and element mapping.

Fig. S7B† gives the O 1s spectra of all samples. It is noted that the O 1s peaks for the ICTOs shifts to a higher binding energy in comparison with the pristine SnO2, which indicates increased chemisorbed oxygen.30Fig. 3A shows the Sn 3d XPS spectra of the 3ICTO and pristine SnO2. It can be seen that the two Sn 3d peaks of 3ICTO (Sn 3d5/2 = 486.5 eV, Sn 3d3/2 = 494.8 eV) all shift to a lower binding energy than that of pristine SnO2 (Sn 3d5/2 = 486.7 eV, Sn 3d3/2 = 495 eV).

This result might be attributable to the oxygen deficiency which decreases the binding energy of Sn.31Fig. 3B shows the In 3d peaks of all samples. The In 3d XPS spectrum consists of two peaks centered at 451.4 and 443.8 eV for the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks, respectively, corresponding to the reported value.32 All the binding energies of In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2 are shown in Table S1.† A significant positive chemical shift of 0.8–1.0 eV in the In 3d5/2 (or In 3d3/2) peak relative to the peak for pristine In2O3 is observed for the ICTOs. This suggests that electronic interactions exist between Sn and In.33
Here, the high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra were also investigated. Fig. 3(C and D) show three peaks of the oxygen species. The peak at 529.9 (∼530.0) eV corresponds to the oxygen species (Od) originating from the oxygen deficiency at the surface of the SnO2 crystallites. The peaks at 530.5 eV (∼530.6) and 531.4 (∼531.5) eV correspond to the lattice oxygen (O2−) and chemisorbed oxygen (Ochem) at the SnO2 surface. The percentages of the Od component are calculated as 23.5% and 28.3% for the pristine SnO2 and 3ICTO. In contrast with pristine SnO2, the content of the Od component for 3ICTO is increased by about 5%, resulting in the shift of Sn 3d. That means the deficiency of the 3ICTO surface is higher than that of pristine SnO2. Meanwhile, the calculated amount of Ochem for the pristine SnO2 and 3ICTO are about 23.6% and 39.8%, respectively. Chemisorbed oxygen is known for its good catalytic activity in gas sensors, improving the performance of NOx sensors.
The XPS valance bands of pristine SnO2 and 3ICTO are shown in Fig. 3E. Obviously, the valence band peak of 3ICTO shifts to a low binding energy. The results are mainly attributed to the higher defect density in 3ICTO.34
UV-vis diffuse reflection–absorption curves of the pristine SnO2 and 3ICTO were measured. As shown in Fig. 3F and S8,† it is clear that the absorption edge red-shifts gradually with the increase of added In2O3. The computational value of the band gap is 3.52 eV for the pristine SnO2, which is close to the bulk one. The band gaps of 1ICTO, 3ICTO and 5ICTO were estimated to be 3.48 eV, 3.38 eV and 3.40 eV, respectively. Obviously, the band gap energies of the ICTOs shifted to a lower energy after SnO2 was composited with In2O3. This result is mainly ascribed to the presence of defects and oxygen vacancies in the ICTOs.35 It further confirms the results of XPS.

Fig. 4A shows typical M–S plots for the pristine SnO2 and ICTOs, which suggest n-type characteristics due to the positive slope of the linear plots.36 It can be clearly seen that the slope reduced after doping, and the slope of 3ICTO is the lowest. This indicates that the 3ICTO has the highest carrier density, consisting with the report.37 Nevertheless, due to the increasing amount of In2O3, the carrier density of 5ICTO is lower than that of 3ICTO. It is mainly because adding the proper amount of In2O3 is advantageous to promote the SnO2 particle distribution around the In2O3 particles, result in the formation of more heterojunctions. These heterojunctions are equal to the electron transfer channels, improving electronic transmission. However, excessive In2O3 will lead to higher aggregation of SnO2 particles. This is not beneficial to the electron transfer. As a consequence, the carrier concentration of 5ICTO is lower than that of 3ICTO.

The carrier densities of pristine SnO2, 1ICTO, 3ICTO, and 5ICTO are calculated to be 3.25 × 1019, 3.79 × 1019, 9.32 × 1019, and 4.46 × 1019 cm−3, respectively (see ESI†). These data further verify that the carrier density of 3ICTO is much higher than that of the others.
The EIS measurement studying the charge transfer rate reveals the expected Nyquist plots for the samples, but with a significantly decreased diameter for the 3ICTO, as shown in Fig. 4B. It indicates faster transport of carriers in 3ICTO. The Nyquist plots are fitted by an appropriate electric equivalent circuit38 (the inset of Fig. 4B) and obtained impedance parameters as given in Table S2.† Here the resistance contribution from the electrolyte, separator and electrode is represented as RΩ.39,40 The (Q1R1) parallel element corresponds to the electrode film interface capacitance (Q1) and surface pore resistance (R1).41 The (Q2R2) parallel element might be attributed to the possible breakdown of the electrolyte and the interface resistance of SnO2/In2O3.42Rct is attributed to the charge-transfer resistance at the active material interface; C is the constant phase angle element, involving double layer capacitance. Furthermore, the values of 3ICTO resistance RΩ and charge-transfer resistance Rct are lower than those of the others. Both the RΩ and Rct are related to the conductivity of the electrode. Also, the Schottky contact resistance at the interface of the one dimensional 3ICTO and the Au electrode is smaller than that of the pristine SnO2 (see Fig. 5). The inset of Fig. 4B shows the slope of the logarithmic plot of Im Z (the imaginary part of the 3ICTO impedance) and ω (angular frequency), which is −0.51, close to −1/2. It confirms that the 3ICTO electrode possesses highly porous structures.43 That is consistent with the description of N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm.
 Fig. 5  
I–V curves measured for the Schottky contacted devices (SCD) of pristine SnO2 and 3ICTO (Vgate = 0.1 V) at 250 °C, inset shows the amplified plot for the I–V curve near the zero voltage. 
In general, a Schottky barrier can be formed at the interface between a metal electrode and a semiconductor. The current passing through the metal–semiconductor contact is mainly controlled by the barrier height and barrier width. Therefore, the electrical property of the device is then dominantly controlled by the characteristics of the Schottky contact. Thus, in order to study the difference in barrier height, the I–V characteristics of the device were investigated, as shown in Fig. 5. The nonlinear current–voltage characteristic of the plot reveals the typical property of the Schottky contact between the samples and the electrode. The inset of Fig. 5 shows that the I–V profile shifts in the direction of lower voltage when the 3ICTO device is exposed to air, compared with the pristine SnO2 device. It indicates that the barrier height of the 3ICTO sensor decreases compared to the pristine SnO2 sensor.44,45 Moreover, in order to further identify the electric behavior of the samples, the devices composed of the 3ICTO and pristine SnO2 mounted on Au electrodes were treated at 60 °C, 250 °C and 400 °C for 1 h in Ar and the I–V curves are depicted in Fig. S9.† It shows the nonlinear characteristic no matter if the devices were treated at 60 °C, 250 °C or 400 °C in Ar. It testifies that the Schottky barrier indeed exists between the samples and the electrode.
In short, the In2O3 modified SnO2 materials exhibit much faster electron transfer and improve the conductivity of SnO2. That is to say, the decrease of equivalent series resistance makes the electron transfer from 3ICTO to O2 easy, forming chemisorbed oxygen and reacting with target gas molecules, then releasing electrons to 3ICTO. A similar situation has been reported by Kim et al.46 and Belysheva et al.47
Gas sensing properties of ICTOs
The sensing response of the pristine SnO2 nanorods to NOx is shown in Fig. S10.† It shows a gas sensing performance at room temperature comparable with other literature reports. It could be ascribed to three points: (i) the SnO2 NRs obtained by heat-treatment at 550 °C. The surface oxygen vacancies of SnO2 generated by heat-treatment allow the surface to strongly adsorb NOx at room temperature; (ii) the size distribution of the pristine SnO2 NPs is dominated by particles of about 9–10 nm. It is well known that some inactive bulk material can become active because of the size effect in small particles; (iii) the SnO2 NPs are often overlapped and connected with four or more neighbors through necks in our work. Therefore, the quantity of necks contacting sections is increased. Great changes in the equivalent resistance of necks would occur after the injection of NOx, and the gas sensor performance of SnO2 in response to NOx is greatly promoted. Thus, the pristine SnO2 responds to NOx at room temperature.

Fig. 6A shows the dynamic gas response of the 3ICTO at concentrations of NOx ranging from 100 ppm to 0.1 ppm. It is evident that when the NOx gas is injected into the sensing chamber, the resistance of the 3ICTO sensor rises rapidly and reaches a maximum resistance value in a short time. Then a decline to its initial value is seen after the sensor is exposed to air. Obviously, the thin-film sensor based on 3ICTO exhibits a rapid and reversible response signal to NOx gas, even at low concentration detection for NOx (0.1 ppm). This is attributed to the reaction of NOx with the adsorbed oxygen species O2−.48 For 100 ppm NOx, the gas response and response time of the 3ICTO are 8.98 and 4.67 s, respectively. The response to low concentrations of NOx is 4.81 for 5 ppm and 2.20 for 1 ppm. The lowest detectable NOx concentration of the 3ICTO sensor is down to 0.1 ppm with a fast response time of 20 s and a high response of 0.92. Compared with other NOx gas sensors at room temperature, such as HCFs–Ni-NPs which could detect 97 ppm NOx in 8.3 s,49 rGO–CNT–SnO2 hybrids with a detection limit down to 5 ppm and a response of 2.5350 and In-doped SnO2–RGO for 1 ppm NO2 with a response of 0.15, the fast response time and high response at low concentrations of our work mean that 3ICTO might be suitable for commercial application in NOx sensing detection.

(F) Relationship between the resistance and the operating temperature of 3ICTO and pristine SnO2 in the air, the inset shows the dotted portion magnified. 

Fig. 6B shows the sensing performance of four sensors towards NOx at RT. It demonstrates that the gas response of 3ICTO to NOx with different concentrations is better than that of the others. The response of 3ICTO at 100 ppm is 4.5, 3.6 and 11 times that of 1ICTO, 5ICTO and pristine SnO2, respectively. With the amount of In2O3 increased to Sn/In = 25:0.5, the lowest detectable NOx concentration of the 5ICTO only reaches 0.5 ppm. This phenomenon might relate to the structure and morphology of the sample. Furthermore, when the NOx concentration is low, a small amount of electrons are adsorbed on the gas molecules. This results in small changes in the resistance. As a result, the sensor response declines with the decreasing concentration of NOx. Moreover, the response of 3ICTO at the lowest detectable concentration of 0.1 ppm can also reach 0.92.

Fig. 6C shows the response time of the four samples. Compared with the pristine SnO2, the response time of all ICTOs becomes faster by introducing the appropriate amount of In2O3. Though the slowest response time of the ICTOs at 0.5 ppm NOx is about 35 s, it is still faster than those previous reports about the sensor performance of SnO2 to NOx.51–53 As shown in Fig. 6D, the stability of the 3ICTO thin film sensor is measured at 0.5 ppm and 0.1 ppm NOx; although the gas response to 0.1 ppm NOx shows a decline of 17% after 10 days, it also can reach 0.79 which is higher than in our previous study.54 After 30 days of aging, the gas response to 0.1 ppm NOx reaches 0.64 and the lowest detectable NOx concentration is still down to 0.1 ppm with a response time of less than 1 min. The detection limit after 30 days is still better than other reports.55,56 In summary, the 3ICTO sensor presents good stability and repeatability. In addition, the sensor selectivity is very important for practical and commercial applications.57,58 To explore the selectivity of the 3ICTO sensor, we have detected CO, H2 and NH3 gas at RT, and the result is shown in Fig. 6E. It is clear to see that the 3ICTO sensor exhibits a higher gas response to NOx than to the other gases, which is mainly because of the enhanced reaction between NOx and the absorbed oxygen (O2−) at RT.59,60 Moreover, the insert in Fig. 6E exhibits a linear calibration curve in the range of 0.1–100 ppm. The degree of linear correlation was evaluated by R2 (R2 = 0.9939). Obviously, the response of 3ICTO versus concentration variation (especially at low concentrations 0.1–10 ppm) is close to linear.
The relationship between the resistance and the operating temperature of the 3ICTO and pristine SnO2 sensors is studied in Fig. 6F. The resistances decrease with the increase of temperature in the range of 25–250 °C, showing semiconductor properties. However, the resistance of the SnO2 at room temperature is over 7 times that of 3ICTO. The 3ICTO shows an evidently enhanced electrical conductivity compared with that of SnO2, consistent with the M–S analysis. Therefore, the 3ICTO sensor presents excellent sensing performance. The greatly enhanced sensitivity and response speed of the device show the potential application in NOx sensors and related nanodevices.
Sensing mechanism

Fig. 7 depicts the proposed mechanism for the enhanced NOx response of the 3ICTO sensor. The HRTEM image (Fig. 7A) shows that the SnO2 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed around the In2O3 and are connected to In2O3 forming a lot of heterojunctions in the structure. There are lots of defects (include oxygen vacancies) in the interfaces. It is well known that the defects can induce trap energy levels at the surfaces and interfaces, and the trapping of carrier electrons in the trap states can cause accumulation layers in the surface and interface regions.11 According to the reports, it is favorable to form many electronic transfer channels,28,61 and the greater number of oxygen vacancies of 3ICTO (proved by XPS) can provide active sites for the chemisorption activity,62,63 improving sensing performance.
 Fig. 7  The scheme of the proposed gas sensing mechanism: (A) HRTEM image of 3ICTO; (B–C) band structure model before and after equilibrium (EV = valence band edge energy; EC = conduction band edge energy; EF = Fermi level); (D–E) model of the 3ICTO sensor exposed in air and in NOx (NO, NO2), respectively. 

Fig. 7B and C show the energy band diagram near the In2O3–SnO2 heterojunctions. The work functions of In2O3 and SnO2 are 5.5 and 5.7 eV by measurement (Fig. S11†), and the energy band gaps of In2O3 and SnO2 are 3.24 and 3.52 eV, respectively. The electron affinities of In2O3 and SnO2 are 3.5 eV64 and 4.5 eV,65 respectively, according to the above, and the Fermi energy level of In2O3 is higher than that of SnO2. When the n-type semiconductor In2O3 and n-type semiconductor SnO2 contact with each other (Fig. 7B), electrons would transfer from In2O3 to the lower-energy conduction band of SnO2 until the Fermi energy levels (EF) of them become equal. This process leads to a band bending (Fig. 7C).66 In this case, the In2O3–SnO2 interface will form a wide “accumulation layer” in the SnO2 and a narrow depletion layer in the In2O3. The accumulation layer can be depleted by subsequent oxygen adsorption on the surface of the SnO2, resulting in the formation of more chemisorbed oxygen.67 Meanwhile, the conduction band of SnO2 is filled with electrons. To further explain the mechanism of the reactions between 3ICTO and the target gas NOx, a rational model is proposed, as shown in Fig. 7D and E. When the SnO2 is exposed to air at room temperature, oxygen molecules on the surface capture electrons from the conduction band of SnO2, and electrons divert from the oxygen vacancies of SnO2 to the oxygen molecule, forming more chemisorbed oxygen species O2− in the surface.68–70 The reactions of eqn (1)–(3) take place on the surface of SnO2 as follows: O2 (g) → O2 (ads)(1) O2 (ads) + e → O2−(2) (3)wherein VO is an oxygen vacancy, and  is a single electropositive oxygen vacancy. It has been reported that a higher oxygen vacancy density would induce more surface absorbed oxygen species.71 Consequently, the NOx molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the thin film sensor, which leads to an enhanced performance in the gas sensing of 3ICTO.
Upon exposure to NOx gas, the gas molecules act as the electron acceptor, trapping the electrons from SnO2, which leads to electron transfer from the 3ICTO to surface adsorbates NOx. The adsorption of NOx on 3ICTO leads to NO2− and NO−, as shown in the following reaction: NOx + e → NO−/NO2− (x = 1, 2)(4)
At the same time, the target gas molecules directly adsorb on the surface and react with O2− and generate bidentate NO3− and NO2−, as shown in the following reaction: NOx + O2− → NO2−/NO3− (x = 1, 2)(5)
These reactions widen the surface depletion layer in the SnO2, resulting in an increase in the resistance of the nanorods sensor. On the contrary, after stopping the NOx gas supply, the resistivity will recover to the initial value due to the release of electrons trapped by the adsorbed NOx molecules.
In summary, there are two important roles of In2O3 in the system. One is that it can modify the distribution of the SnO2 nanoparticles by adding the proper amount of In2O3. This is favourable to form more electronic transfer channels, resulting in faster electron transport. Another is that electrons can transfer from In2O3 to SnO2. Thus, when the SnO2 is exposed to air at room temperature, oxygen molecules on the surface capture more electrons from the SnO2. It is beneficial to form more chemisorbed oxygen species in the surface, and hence the gas sensing property increases.
Conclusion
In summary, the present study has demonstrated a facile electrospinning approach combined with subsequent annealing to synthesize In2O3-composite SnO2 nanorods. After adding In2O3, the conductivity, carrier density and chemisorbed oxygen of ICTOs are improved. This enhanced the sensing performance for NOx at room temperature. Especially, 3ICTO nanorods show a high sensing response and a fast response time toward different concentrations of NOx. Most importantly, the 3ICTO nanorods present superior stability, which is demonstrated with a low detection limit still down to 0.1 ppm after being used for 30 days. The excellent sensing performance of the 3ICTO nanorods could be explained by the band structure model combined with the surface depletion model and the In2O3–SnO2 heterojunctions are beneficial to improve the sensing performance.
