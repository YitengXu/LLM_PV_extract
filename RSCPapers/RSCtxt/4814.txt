    , Accepted 10th June 2021First published on 11th June 2021AbstractA piezo-photocatalytic therapy based on thermally treated natural sphalerite nanosheet (NSH700 NS) heterojunction was applied to efficiently induce intracellular ROS burst and apoptosis of cancer cells. Upon ultrasound and laser irradiation, the formation of a polarized electric field and band bending of NSH700 NSs allow the directional separation of charges both in the bulk and their interface, thereby minimizing the probability of charge recombination. The piezo-photocatalytic effect leads to an efficient catalytic performance, exhibiting high-performance superoxide radical (˙O2−) and hydroxyl radical (˙OH) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion, which results in a intracellular ROS burst-triggered apoptosis of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.

New concepts
Catalytic therapies generate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that trigger target cell apoptosis. The current strategies are limited by the rapid recombination of charges (electron–hole pairs) in the bulk or surface of employed catalysts. Herein, the concept of piezo-photocatalytic therapy has been demonstrated to improve electron–hole pair separation both in the bulk and their interface, thereby inducing intracellular ROS burst and cancer cells apoptosis. A heterojunction structure based on thermally treated natural sphalerite nanosheets (NSH700 NSs) with piezo-photocatalytic effect was prepared through calcination and liquid exfoliation. The formation of a polarized electric field and band bending in the NSH700 NS heterojunction under ultrasound (US) and light irradiation allow the directional separation of charges both in the bulk and their interface. Significantly, the piezo-photocatalytic effect leads to efficient catalytic performance, exhibiting high-performance superoxide radical (˙O2−) and hydroxyl radical (˙OH) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. The resulting intracellular ROS burst-triggered the apoptosis of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. As far as it is known, this is the first study to report piezo-photocatalytic cancer therapy based a heterojunction structure, and provides a strong experimental basis for applying this strategy in other biomedical applications.

Introduction
Catalytic therapies, including photocatalytic therapy (PCT) and sonocatalytic therapy (SCT), which eliminate target cells with reactive oxygen species (ROS), are highly attractive for cancer treatment as ROS not only simultaneously disrupts diversely crucial cellular substances but also consequently circumvents drug-resistance mechanisms in cancer cells.1–5 However, high concentrations of photo-/sono-catalysts, high excitation energy, or harsh reaction environment are believed to be essential for sufficient ROS generation, which can cause significant damage to normal tissues.6–9 Therefore, thoroughly analyzing the mechanism behind the catalytic therapy and developing novel strategies for substantial ROS generation under low catalyst concentration and excitation energy are necessary, which still remain rarely explored and challenging.
Similar to dynamic therapy, catalytic therapy generally involves three fundamental steps:10 (i) excitation energy absorption and electron–hole pair generation in internal catalysts, (ii) electron–hole pair separation and migration from the bulk to surface, and finally, (iii) surface transfer and catalysis of the corresponding redox reaction. The efficacy of catalytic therapy substantially relies on charge separation and transfer kinetics, and it is still generally below the threshold level required for clinical applications.10,11 Therefore, several strategies, including surface defect engineering,12–17 surface metal or metal oxide decoration,18–20 and heterojunction (type II, Z-scheme, or p–n junctions) construction,10,21–23 have been investigated to promote excitation energy absorption and charge migration on the surface of the catalyst, which mainly focus on steps i and iii. Nevertheless, bulk charge separation and transfer to the surface are the rate-limiting steps and are still lagging far behind.
Recently, piezoelectric materials, in which the piezoelectric characteristic originates from their non-centrosymmetric nature, have attracted a lot of attention due to the form of the polarized electric field and subsequent band bending induced by mechanical energy.24–26 Hence, the utilization of piezoelectric effect has been demonstrated to be an efficient strategy for improving the separation and transport behaviors of electrons and holes both in the bulk and on the surface of photocatalysts with enhanced redox potentials.27–29 The coupling effect between the photoelectric process and piezoelectric polarization is a subcategory of piezotronics, which is referred to as piezo-phototronics for using piezoelectric polarization charges to tune/enhance optoelectronic processes.30–33 This makes the engineering of charge-carrier characteristics at the heterojunction interface and bulk phase possible as a result of the built-in electric field, and provides a driving force for the transport of photo-/sono-induced charges (electrons/holes) in desired directions, facilitating their separation and suppressing their recombination. Therefore, the construction of piezo-photocatalytic heterojunction using both light and US as excitation energy might be the most efficient strategy for improving the catalytic therapy efficiency with minimized adverse effects.
Piezocatalysis, which involves the coupling of piezoelectric polarization and semiconductor properties, gives rise to superior synergetic effects, which offer various advantages compared to traditional sonocatalysis, such as directed and efficient charge separation and transport guided by piezoelectric polarization-induced build-in electric field, slow undesired electron–hole pair recombination, and improved redox potentials.11 Therefore, in the case of ultrasound as an external energy resource, piezocatalysis can be regarded as piezoelectric polarization-induced build-in electric field and energy band shifts enhanced the sonodynamic effect, in which the build-in electric field under opposite surfaces of piezoelectric materials facilitates the separation of sono-excited electron–hole pairs and the energy band shifts improve the redox potentials. Due to the limited piezoelectric materials, dynamic integration of the piezoelectric effect with photo- or chemo-catalysis is more conducive for practical application. The concept of piezo-phototronics was first proposed by Prof. Wang in 2010.33 Piezo-phototronics focuses primarily on regulating the piezopotential and piezoelectric charges to combine the migration behaviors of photo- or sono-excited electron–hole pairs, which is simultaneously based on the coupling construction of semiconducting, photo-/sono-exciting, and piezoelectric properties. Since then, significant progresses have been made in various fields, especially water splitting and pollutant degradation. For instance, ZnO-based nanostructures,25 BaTiO3 nanoplates,34 NaNbO3 nanorods,35 and Bi4NbO8X (X = Cl, Br) single crystalline nanoplates36 have been applied as efficient piezo-photocatalysts for catalyzing water splitting and pollutant degradation with largely enhanced electron–hole pair separation under build-in electric fields and piezoelectric polarization-induced high redox potentials. In addition, various heterojunction-based piezo-photocatalysts, such as CuS/ZnO nanowires,37 TiO2/ZnO nanowires,38 and ZnO/WO3 nanorod arrays,39 have been developed using both solar and mechanical energy for degrading organic dyes or H2 evolution from water. Coupling solar illumination with sonication-induced mechanical vibration energy, the piezoelectric field created by piezoelectric materials, such as ZnO, can separate the photo-/sono-generated electrons/holes and lower the recombination rate both in their bulk and interface; meanwhile, piezoelectric polarization-induced catalyst band bending can also improve the redox potentials of these separated electrons and holes. Hence, the catalytic performance of heterojunction-based piezo-photocatalysts could be largely improved by the piezo-photocatalytic effect.
Recently, cost-effective natural sphalerite (NSH) composed of biocompatible ZnS and FeS-based heterojunction has been demonstrated to be a good mineral photocatalyst for water treatment.40 In addition, after calcination at high temperature, the composition of NSH turns to ZnS/ZnFe2O4/ZnO,41 forming an interesting heterojunction composed of two piezoelectric catalysts (ZnS and ZnO) and one photocatalyst (ZnFe2O4), which might possess extraordinarily efficient catalytic performance via the enhanced piezo-photocatalytic effect in this heterojunction. However, the piezo-photocatalytic performance under light and sonication of NSH or calcinated NSH has remained unexplored in any research field. In addition, a novel piezo-photocatalytic therapy based on the piezo-photocatalytic effect mediated effective electron–hole pairs separation and enhanced redox potential might provide a more significative option for the dynamic treatment of solid tumors or other related diseases.
Herein, we describe a novel elementary piezo-photocatalytic mechanism that can co-use mechanical and photonic energy for the production of ROS, including ˙O2− and ˙OH, and consumption of glutathione (GSH), inducing redox imbalance and apoptotic cell death directly, via the coupling of the photoelectric and piezoelectric properties of thermally-treated natural sphalerite nanosheets (NSH700 NSs). The NSH700 NSs heterojunction, composed of ZnS/ZnFe2O4/ZnO, was prepared through calcination at 700 °C and exfoliation in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) of natural sphalerite (NSH, ZnS/FeS). Under both 650 nm laser and US irradiation, the excited electrons and holes voluntarily migrate from the bulk to the surface under a piezoelectric field in the opposite directions, in which electron–hole pair recombination can be suppressed by transfer to the surface. Furthermore, the heterojunction between ZnS/ZnFe2O4/ZnO further redistributes the surface electrons and holes to specific locations for reduction and oxidation reaction, respectively, which further restrains the undesired recombination of electron–hole pairs on the surface of the catalysts. Hence, ROS burst under low concentration of the catalyst and excitation energy were obtained based on the piezo-photocatalytic effect. With the goal of complete remission of tumors without recurrence, our work presents a novel piezo-photocatalytic mechanism based on NSH700 NSs with multiple independently-targeted ROS bursts for effective cancer therapy. This is, to our knowledge, the first time report on the piezo-photocatalytic effect in cancer therapy, and provides a proof-of-principle for the development of similar piezo-photocatalytic heterojunctions.
Results and discussion
The ultrathin piezo-photocatalyst NSH700 NSs were synthesized by coupling calcination and liquid exfoliation (Fig. 1A). Firstly, relatively uniform NSH microparticles with ∼1 μm were prepared through wet grinding in NMP at 1000 rpm for 30 min (Fig. S1, ESI†). Although the main composite of NSH, ZnS, is piezoelectric material, in order to introduce much stronger piezoelectric effect and construct a heterojunction to improve the charge separation and migration in the bulk and the surface, calcination at 700 °C was applied to prepare NSH700, composing a very interesting structure of ZnS/ZnFe2O4/ZnO. After that, the interlayer attraction force of NSH700 was completely broken down, and ultrathin NSH700 nanosheets (NSH700 NSs) were fabricated under ultrasound-facilitated exfoliation in NMP. Ultrathin NSH700 NSs with a few layers endow huge specific surface areas and active sites, and much shorter charge transfer distance for better implementation of the piezo-photocatalytic effect. For the sake of elucidating the piezo-photocatalytic mechanism and highlighting the excellent properties of NSH700 NSs, NSH NSs without calcination were also fabricated. As shown in Fig. 1B, D and Fig. S2, S3 (ESI†), ultrathin NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs, with an average size of ∼130 nm were obtained. High-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) imaging of the representative NSH NSs confirm the crystalline nature of ZnS and FeS, showing a clear interference fringe with a d-spacing of 0.33 nm and 0.26 nm, corresponding to the plane of ZnS and FeS structures, respectively (Fig. 1C).42 After calcination at 700 °C, the HRTEM images with a clear interference fringe and d-spacing of 0.33 nm, 0.28 nm, and 0.49 nm, corresponding to the plane of ZnS, ZnO, and ZnFe2O4 structures (Fig. 1E),42,43 provided a direct evidence for the successful preparation of the piezo-photocatalyst NSH700 NSs. In addition, the obvious color change from black to brown also indicated the composition and structure transformation of NSH700 NSs (Fig. S4, ESI†). Next, the crystal structures of pristine NSH NSs and calcined NSH700 NSs were studied in detail by applying X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1F, NSH NSs features obvious peaks at 2θ = 76.6° (331), 69.4° (400), 56.3° (311), 47.5° (220), 33.1° (200), and 28.5° (111), corresponding to the standard curve of sphalerite (ZnS, JCPDS 77-2100).44 In addition, some minor peaks at 2θ = 64.3° (321), 61.7° (023), 40.8° (211), and 37.1° (210), were also exhibited in the XRD spectrum of NSH NSs, which could result from the presence of impurities in the sphalerite matrix, such as pyrite (FeS, JCPDS 42-1340).45 After calcination at 700 °C, besides the major characteristic peaks of FeS and ZnS, a new set of peaks at 2θ = 69.1° (201), 67.9° (112), 66.4° (200), 62.9° (103), 56.6° (110), 47.5° (102), 36.3° (101), 34.4° (002), and 31.8° (100) were also observed in the XRD spectrum of NSH700 NSs, which is well-indexed to zincite (ZnO, JCPDS 79-2205).46 Therefore, crystalline ZnO and ZnS were the main composition of NSH700 NSs. Compared with NSH NSs, with the appearance of ZnO, the peaks of ZnS were weakened. Meanwhile, the trace peaks of iron compounds in NSH700 NSs were partially changed into franklinite (ZnFe2O4, JCPDS 79-1500) with non-overlapping peaks of 73.7° (533), 62.3° (440), 53.2° (422), 42.9° (400), 35.3° (331), and 30.0° (220).47,48 Moreover, the Raman shifting seen with NSH700 NSs (Fig. 1G) also indicated the composition and structure changes during calcination at 700 °C. In the XPS analysis, as exhibited in Fig. 1I, compared with the XPS spectrum of the bulk ZnS powder, the peak of O from the XPS spectrum of NSH700 NSs was higher, which should be ascribed to surface oxidation. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1J, in the O 1s scans of NSH NSs, there was only one O species that could be ascribed to the absorbed oxygen on the surface of the samples (532.2 eV). In the O 1s scans of NSH700 NSs (Fig. 1K), there were two O species at 532.2 eV and 529.5 eV, which should be attributed to the absorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen on the surface of NSH700 NSs. All the above observations demonstrated the successful fabrication of ultrathin piezo-photocatalyst NSH700 NSs.

The stability and physiological dispersibility of nanomedicines are crucial for biomedical applications. After ultrasound-facilitated exfoliation, the surfaces of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs were negatively charged (Fig. S5, ESI†), which allowed surface modification with positively charged PEG–NH2 through electrostatic attraction. About 30% (w/w) PEG–NH2 was loaded on the surface of the NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs, as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S6, ESI†). PEGylation of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs exhibited negligible agglomeration and remarkably better dispersibility in the cell culture medium, phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and water compared to bare NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs (Fig. S7, ESI†). In addition, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were also applied to test the PEGylation of NSH700 NSs (Fig. 1H and L). In the FT-IR spectrum, the absorption bands at ∼1250 cm−1 and ∼2900 cm−1 should be attributed to the CO stretching vibration and –CH vibrations in the PEG–NH2 segment. Moreover, the elements, Zn (red), S (olive green), Fe (green), O (yellow), C (purple), and N (pink), appeared in the EDS mapping of PEGylated NSH700 NSs (Fig. 1L), further confirming the successful surface coating by PEG–NH2. For the long-term stability and potential biodegradability of the prepared NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs, the NSs were immersed in PBS solution and stirred for one month. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), there was no detectable change observed in their XPS and XRD spectra, which demonstrated the good long-term storage stability of the prepared NSs.
Next, the properties of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs as an efficient piezo-photocatalyst for inducing ROS burst was investigated in depth. From this point on, the NSs, including NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs, applied for all in vitro and in vivo experiments, were PEGylated NSs. At first, light absorption from the visible to the NIR region of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs was detected and a concentration-dependent light absorption was observed, as shown in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†). Superoxide anion (˙O2−) generation by NSH700 NSs through the reduction of separated and transferred electrons was measured with the dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123) probe. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, neither nanostructure showed any increase in the fluorescence in the absence of laser or ultrasound (US) irradiation. Weak fluorescence was detected following excitation with a 650 nm laser, which indicated that NSH NSs or NSH700 NSs are suitable photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). On the other hand, US irradiation increased the fluorescence intensity, which was indicative of their piezoelectric characteristics (Fig. 2A). Finally, co-stimulation with both energy sources rapidly and significantly enhanced DHR 123 fluorescence, especially for NSH700 NSs, due to synergistic piezoelectric and photoelectric effects.

(G) The EPR signals of ˙O2− and ˙OH after treatment with NSH NSs or NSH700 NSs and 650 nm laser and US as the excitation energy sources. The power of the 650 nm laser was 0.3 W cm−2. The power of US was 0.8 MHz, 0.5 W cm−2, 50% duty cycle. 
The piezo-catalytic effect of NSH700 NSs was further assessed in terms of hydroxyl radical (˙OH) production through the oxidation of separated and transferred holes using methylene blue (MB) as the specific probe of ˙OH. Consistent with the above results, higher levels of ˙OH were produced following US irradiation relative to 650 nm laser irradiation, and the co-irradiated NSH700 NSs exhibited strongest ˙OH generation, which further confirmed their synergistic piezo-photocatalytic effects (Fig. 2C and D). In addition, glutathione (GSH), one of the most important antioxidants for maintaining intracellular redox balance, could also be oxidized to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) by the separated and transferred holes. As observed in Fig. 2E and F, NSH700 NSs also exhibited great ability to oxidize GSH, especially under the treatment of 650 nm laser and US irradiations. Electron spin resonance (ESR) using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide as the spin trapping agent directly showed that NSH700 NSs generated ˙O2− and ˙OH synchronously from O2 and H2O (Fig. 2G and F). In addition, the stability of the prepared NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs under 650 nm laser and US irradiations was further studied. As exhibited in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the XPS and XRD spectra of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs after 30 min of 650 nm laser and US irradiations were nearly the as same as those of fresh NSs. The steady chemical composition and structure further confirm the good stability under laser and US irradiations.
To illuminate the piezo-photocatalytic effect in NSH700 NSs, the photo-electronic and piezo-electronic properties of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs were analyzed in detail. For the photo-electronic properties of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs, the electronic band structure of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs was investigated through solid UV-vis-NIR absorption and XPS spectroscopy. The Eg of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs could be calculated from Fig. 3A based on the Kubelka–Munk conversion. As exhibited in Fig. 3A, two and three respective curves are shown for NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs, respectively, which means there were two and three main ingredients in NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs heterogeneous structures. Based on the above analysis, the main components of NSH NSs were ZnS and FeS, and after calcination, the NSH700 NSs were composed of ZnS, ZnFe2O4, and ZnO. Through the intercepts of the tangent with the abscissa, the band gaps (Eg) of ZnS, FeS, ZnFe2O4, and ZnO were calculated to be 3.5, 1.3, 1.7, and 3.2 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the number of valence band (VB) of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs also demonstrated the heterogeneous structure of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the VB values of ZnS, FeS, ZnFe2O4, and ZnO were calculated to be 2.5, 0.6, 1.1, and 2.7 eV, respectively. Next, the conductive band (CB) values of ZnS, FeS, ZnFe2O4, and ZnO were determined to be −1.0, −0.7, −0.6, and −0.5 eV, respectively, from the difference between Eg and VB. Hence, the energy band and possible electron transfer mechanism under 650 nm laser irradiation are vividly described in Fig. 3C. For NSH NSs, under exposure to 650 nm light, the ZnS and FeS of NSH NSs would be excited and the electron–hole pair separated simultaneously. However, the photoexcited electrons in the CB of ZnS prefer to transfer to the CB of FeS and the holes in the VB of ZnS prefer to transfer to the VB of FeS due to the lower energy. This type I heterojunction of NSH NSs could postpone the recombination of the electron–hole pairs; however, the reduction and oxidation potentials of the electrons and holes were all attenuated due to the need of stabilization of the excited electrons and holes. In addition, the E0 for the reduction of O2/˙O2− (−0.16 eV) and the oxidation of GSH/GSSG (0.32 eV) was lower than the energy lever of CB and VB of FeS, signifying that it was feasible, from a thermodynamic point of view, to transfer electrons from the CB of FeS to O2 for producing ˙O2− and capture electrons by the VB of FeS to oxidize GSH. Nevertheless, the E0 of H2O/˙OH was 2.38 eV, which was much higher than the energy lever of VB of FeS; thus, it is very difficult to catalyze ˙OH production from H2O via the holes at the VB of FeS. Moreover, the relative energy level difference (ΔE) between the band level and E0 was one of determining factors for the catalytic efficacy, in which greater ΔE guarantees higher electron transfer and catalytic efficacy. As shown in Fig. 3C, the ΔE between the CB of FeS and E0 of O2/˙O2− and the ΔE between the VB of FeS and E0 of GSH/GSSG were relatively small, which might be the main cause for the poor performance of NSH NSs for GSH oxidation and ROS production. Similarly, the electron–hole pair separation and transfer in the NSH700 NSs-based heterojunction is also exhibited in Fig. 3D. Similar to NSH NSs, from the viewpoint of need of stabilization of excited electrons and holes, the excited and separated electrons and holes prefer to transfer to a lower energy band, which means that the electrons and holes in NSH700 NSs would aggregate at the CB of ZnO and the VB of ZnFe2O4, respectively. The weak GSH consumption and ROS generation could be attributed to the type I heterojunction of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs, leading to the adynamic reduction and oxidation ability of electrons and holes. In addition, although the type I heterojunction of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs retarded the recombination of electron–hole pairs on the surface, bulk charge separation and migration from the bulk to the surface are the rate-limiting steps and still remain unsolved, which might lead to the recombination of electron–hole pairs though their transfer from the bulk to the surface; this should be another key for the weak GSH consumption and ROS generation of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs under 650 nm laser irradiation.

Because of the asymmetry of the crystal structure, the displacement of the center of negative and positive charges in the unit cell leads to spontaneous polarization. Under strain or stress, the polarized negative and positive charges will be produced on the two ends of ZnS and ZnO crystals, which induce a build-in electric field on the two ends of the crystals. In order to get an in-depth understanding of the piezoelectric property, NSH700 NSs were characterized by scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). As shown in Fig. 3E, nanosheet-shaped NSH700 with a corresponding height of 20 nm were obtained. Fig. 3F exhibited the phase map of NSH 700 NSs, which matches well with the morphology map in Fig. 3E. Next, a surface potential of 30 mV of NSH700 NSs was observed in the piezoelectric potential map of NSH700 NSs (Fig. 3G) obtained by SKPFM in the darkness, which demonstrates its piezoelectric property (Fig. 3G). On applying a ramp voltage loop from −10 to 10 V, a localized hysteresis loop was observed for NSH700 NSs, where the phase angle changed by 180° and was accompanied by the typical butterfly shape in the displacement-voltage curve (Fig. 3H and I). The piezoelectric potential map and typical butterfly shape in the displacement-voltage curve of NSH700 NSs provided direct evidences for the good piezoelectric property, in which the build-in electric field and band bending would be constructed under US irradiation. As mentioned before, the prepared NSH700 NSs possess strong piezoelectric characteristics. With the polarized negative and positive charges produced on the two ends of the ZnS and ZnO crystals, a new electron–hole pair separation and transfer mechanism was formed and is illustrated in Fig. 3J and K. Taking ZnS crystals in NSH700 NSs as an example, with the guidance of the polarized surface of ZnS, the excited electrons and holes were much easier to separate and transfer from the bulk to their surface along the driving force provided by the internal electric field. Hence, the rate-limiting step, charge separation and migration from bulk to surface, was fundamentally improved, and the recombination of electron–hole pairs in the bulk was drastically reduced. Furthermore, the separated electrons and holes transfer on their surface and those in the heterojunction interface were also rearranged. As shown in Fig. 3J, the negative and positive charges on the surface of ZnS not only improved the electron–hole pair separation and transfer in the bulk of ZnS but also provided a driving force for neighboring electrons and holes (FeS). Although the holes in the VB of ZnS tend to transfer to the VB of FeS, under the guidance of a build-in electric field in ZnS, a certain amount of the holes in the VB of FeS would transfer to the VB of ZnS with highly improved oxidation potentials. Besides, the enhanced ˙OH generation and GSH oxidation further demonstrated the improved oxidation potential energy of the holes from the VBs of ZnS and FeS. Similarly, Fig. 3K exhibits that the negative and positive charges on the surface of ZnS not only improved the electron–hole pair separation and transfer in the bulk of ZnS but also provided a driving force for neighboring electrons and holes (ZnFe2O4), in which a certain amount of the holes at the VB of ZnFe2O4 would transfer to the VB of ZnS with highly improved oxidation potentials. In the same way, the electrons at the CB of ZnFe2O4 would transfer and aggregate in the VB of ZnO. Moreover, the piezo-electronic effect not only improved the efficacy of charge separation and transfer but only rearranged their band level, which would be one of the most effective strategies for improving the ΔE between the band level and E0 of reactions. Hence, as exhibited in Fig. 3J and K, under the 650 nm laser and US irradiation, the charge separation, transfer from the bulk to the surface, rearrangement in the heterojunction, and the redox potentials were fundamentally improved, which guarantee a drastic ROS burst by inducing two ROS species generation and one ROS blocking pathway (GSH consumption).
In order to further confirm the highly-efficient piezo-photocatalytic effect in NSH700 NSs-based heterojunction structure, the photo-/sono-chemical properties of NSH700 NSs, including the current curve and time-resolved fluorescence lifetime, were further investigated under exposure to 650 nm laser and US irradiations. As shown in Fig. 3L, the current response versus time of NSH700 NSs under 650 nm laser and US irradiations is the highest. The current response of NSH700 NSs is stable and reversible, in which, by turning the irradiation on and off, the current was increased and quenched. The current is responsible for the piezo-photocatalytic activity; this forecasts that the electrons excited by 650 nm laser and US irradiations were transferred from the sacrificial agents, such as H2O and O2, to the electrode through the NSH700 NSs. Moreover, time-resolved fluorescence decay analysis was further employed to demonstrate the suppressed recombination of electron–hole pairs in NSH700 NSs through the piezo-photocatalytic effect. As shown in Fig. 3M, under 650 nm laser and US irradiations, the excited state electron radioactive decay lifetime indicated that NSH700 NSs had the longest fluorescence lifetime in comparison with treatment by 650 nm laser and US irradiations separately, demonstrating that the incorporation of the piezo-photocatalytic effect in NSH700 NSs-based heterojunction structure increased the photoelectron lifetime of the NSH700 NSs. This result further certified that NSH700 NSs have good coordination of the piezo-photocatalytic effect for the most efficient and fastest photoexcited electron–hole pair separation and transfer both in the bulk and on the surface.
In the next set of experiments, the TME-modulating and ROS-generating capacity, as well as the antitumor effect in vitro of the prepared piezo-photocatalyst, were assessed. Firstly, the biocompatibility of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs with the cancer cells, such as human cervical carcinoma cell (HeLa) and human breast cancer cells (MCF7), were tested via MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 4A and Fig. S11 (ESI†), the NSs showed negligible cytotoxicity in the absence of excitation, and more than 80% of the cells were viable even when exposed to 200 μg mL−1 of the respective NSs. However, stimulation with a 650 nm laser or US increased the cytotoxic effects of both NSH and NSH700 NSs (Fig. 4B and Fig. S12, ESI†). Less than 10% of the cells survived following treatment with NSH700 NSs coupled with the 650 nm laser and US irradiation. The cytotoxic effect could be attributed to the physical force such as heat and membrane disruption induced by laser and US irradiation and the drastic ROS burst induced by the piezo-photocatalytic effect in the presence of photo-/sono-excitation. In order to confirm the main mechanism of the efficient cytotoxicity toward the cancer cells, the temperature of the cancer cells was firstly recorded during piezo-photocatalytic treatment. After 10 min of 650 nm laser and US irradiation, the temperature of the cancer cells only increased about 6 °C so that the physical force induced by laser and US irradiation would not be the main reason for the cytotoxicity. In addition, flow cytometry (FCM) was applied to analyze the cancer cells by detecting the manner of death and the intracellular ROS concentration. As shown in Fig. 4C, apoptosis is the main manner for cancer cell death, and the drastic ROS burst should be the main reason for cancer cell apoptosis. Compared with the cancer cells treated with NSH700 NSs alone, the intracellular ROS contents in the cells treated with NSH700 NSs and 650 nm laser or US irradiation were obviously improved. The highest intracellular ROS concentration was exhibited when the cancer cells were treated with NSH700 NSs coupled with 650 nm laser and US irradiations, which not only further confirmed the intracellular ROS burst-induced apoptosis of cells but also demonstrated the good coordination of the piezo-photocatalytic effect of NSH700 NSs (Fig. 4D). In addition, intracellular ROS increase was detected by enhanced intracellular green fluorescence intensity using 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate as the ROS probe, which could be oxidized by ROS and emit the green fluorescence. As exhibited in Fig. 4E and F, compared with the control group, the cancer cells treated with NSH700 NSs, coupled with the 650 nm laser and US irradiations, showed the highest ROS increasement. Moreover, cancer cells have learned to adapt to oxidative stress by activating antioxidant systems, often through the upregulation of GSH. Hence, blocking the consumption of ROS from GSH is another crucial strategy for indirectly inducing intracellular ROS increase. With the highly-efficient piezo-photocatalytic effect, the separated holes of NSH700 NSs not only catalyzed the oxidation of H2O, generating ˙OH, but also oxidized GSH to produce GSSG, which blocked the consumption of ROS, and indirectly induced intracellular ROS increase. Therefore, the GSH-depletion ability of NSH700 NSs in the MCF7 cells was investigated via the GSH assay kit. Fig. S13 (ESI†) exhibited an obvious and concentration-dependent decrease in the GSH content, suggesting a strong GSH-depletion ability of the NSH700 NSs, which could induce the intracellular ROS level indirectly. Moreover, in order to directly prove that intracellular ROS burst is the main mechanism of the efficient cytotoxicity toward the cancer cells, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, one of the most efficient and broad-spectrum ROS scavengers, was applied to eliminate intracellular ROS generated through the piezo-photocatalytic effect of NSs under 650 nm laser and US irradiation. As observed from Fig. S14 (ESI†), after the co-culture MCF7 cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, the anti-tumor effect of the piezo-photocatalytic treatment dropped dramatically, which further directly demonstrated that intracellular ROS burst induced by piezo-photocatalytic effect was the main mechanism of the efficient cytotoxicity toward the cancer cells.

As is well-known, ultrasound can generate sonodynamic effect on traditional sonosensitizers. For piezoelectric materials, ultrasound-generated piezoelectric effect can be regarded as piezoelectric polarization-induced build-in electric field and energy band shifts enhanced the sonodynamic effect. Hence, it is difficult to distinguish the sonodynamic effect or the piezoelectric effect on the piezocatalytic performance in piezocatalytic therapy, which should result from piezoelectric polarization-enhanced sonodynamic effect. For the piezo-photocatalytic effect of NSH700 NSs (NSH700 + L + S group) in this study, the anti-tumor effect should be a simple combination of NSH700 + L and NSH700 + S, if there is no piezoelectric effect. However, the piezo-photocatalytic performance of NSH700 NSs was much better than that of the simple combination of NSH700 + L and NSH700 + S. This largely enhanced the anti-tumor effect of the NSH700 + L + S group demonstrates that the piezo-photocatalytic effect is not a simple combination of the photodynamic and sonodynamic effects but piezoelectric polarization-induced build-in electric field and energy band shifts enhanced the photodynamic and sonodynamic effects, which also provides a direct evidence for the exist of the piezoelectric effect.
The anti-cancer potential of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs was further evaluated in vivo using the MCF7 tumor-bearing mice. The mice were each injected intravenously with Cy7-labeled NSs at the dosage of 3 mg kg−1, and the fluorescence intensity of Cy7 in the blood was measured at different time intervals. As shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), the Cy7-loaded NSs exhibited a largely enhanced internal circulation time compared with free Cy7, which guaranteed much more tumor accumulation of the NSs. The biodistribution and tumor accumulation of Cy7-labeled NSH700 NSs after tail intravenous injection at different time intervals were tested using the MCF7 xenograft tumor model. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), NSs started to show significantly higher level of accumulation in the tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect 12 h post-injection. The fluorescence intensity in the tumor started to decrease 24 h post-injection, suggesting that NSs could be excreted outside of the body. After 12 h post-injection, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumor and some important organs were dissected. As exhibited in Fig. S16 (ESI†), the tumor and some organs including the spleen, kidney, and liver show bright fluorescence signals, which was in accordance with the results in vivo.
The MCF7 tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into the following groups and treated accordingly: Group 1: saline; Group 2: NSH/NSH700 NSs; Group 3: NSH/NSH700 NSs + 650 nm laser; Group 4: NSH/NSH700 NSs + US; and Group 5: NSH/NSH700 NSs + 650 nm laser + US. The power density of the 650 nm laser was 0.3 W cm−2, and US irradiation was performed at the frequency of 0.8 MHz and power density of 0.5 W cm−2 with 50% duty cycle. The irradiation time for the 650 nm laser and US irradiation was 10 min. Both laser or US treatments were carried out 12 h post-injection (Fig. 5A). The tumor volume was measured every 2 days, and as shown in the growth curves in Fig. 5B, the untreated and non-irradiated controls did not show any significant inhibition of tumor growth. The combination of 650 nm laser irradiation and NSH/NSH700 NSs achieved only a slight inhibitory effect, which can be attributed to the low levels of ROS generated by the photocatalytic effect of the nanosheets. In contrast, the ultrasonic stimulation of NSH/NSH700 NSs led to a significantly greater reduction in the tumor volume, indicating that their piezocatalytic effect generated high levels of intracellular ROS upon sonication and induced cancer cell apoptosis. The co-stimulation of NSH NSs with both 650 nm and US irradiation markedly inhibited the tumor growth, whereas NSH700 NSs completely ablated the tumors under the same conditions. These findings are consistent with the piezo-photocatalytic effect and the heterojunction structure of NSH700 NSs that induces an intracellular ROS burst. The largely enhanced anti-tumor effect of NSH700 NSs stimulated by both 650 nm and US irradiation further demonstrated that the piezoelectric polarization-induced build-in electric field and energy band shifts enhanced the photodynamic and sonodynamic effects, in which the build-in electric field under opposite surfaces of piezoelectric materials facilitates the separation of photo-/sono-excited electron–hole pairs and the energy band shifts improve the redox potentials. The representative images of the tumors from the differentially-treated mice are shown in Fig. 5C. No significant changes were observed in the body weight of the animals during the experimental period (Fig. S17 and S18, ESI†), indicating the negligible adverse effects of this therapy in vivo.

(H) In vivo DNA damage of the tumors after different treatments was measured by the 8-OHdG assay and the apoptosis ratio of the tumors calculated from the section studies in (E and H). The power of the 650 nm laser was 0.3 W cm−2. The power of US was 0.8 MHz, 0.5 W cm−2, 50% duty cycle. The exposure time was 10 min. 
Moreover, a series of immunostaining and H&E staining were applied to further analyze the mechanism of the piezo-catalytic effect of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs in vivo. The ROS burst effect was also studied by staining with a fluorescent probe (DCFH-DA). The results in Fig. 5D and G show consistent ROS accumulation after different treatments with their corresponding anti-tumor effects, in which strongest green fluorescence was detected in the NSH700 NSs + 650 nm laser + US group, further indicating a drastic ROS burst in the tumor cells. As previously reported, the reason for the ROS-induced cell toxicity is mainly DNA damage caused by ROS.49 We thus further assessed DNA damage levels and cell apoptosis in the tumors after different treatments using γ-H2AX as the marker for DNA double-strand breaks and TUNEL and H&E staining, respectively. Treatment with NSH700 NSs alone induced negligible irreparable DNA damage and cancer cell apoptosis, which further confirmed the good biocompatibility of the NSH700 NSs. Treatment with NSH700 NSs and 650 nm laser or US induced a certain extent of irreparable DNA damage and cancer cell apoptosis. Coupling 650 nm laser and US, remarkably high levels of irreparable DNA damage and cell apoptosis in the tumor section were observed (Fig. 5E, F, and H). Moreover, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), as one of the reliable markers for oxidative stress, was detected after different treatments to further demonstrate this potential mechanism. As displayed in Fig. 5H, the 8-OHdG results showed trends consistent with the γ-H2AX data. These results together further confirmed that the therapeutic strategy based on NSH700 NSs efficiently induce ROS burst and specifically killed the cancer cells.
Due to the poor biodegradability of NSH NSs and NSH700 NSs, the retention of NSs in the mice body was tested via inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). As exhibited in Fig. S19 (ESI†), NSs aggregated significantly in various organs, especially liver, spleen, and lung, several hours after being injected into the mice through the tail vein. With the passage of time, the accumulation of NSs in each organ gradually decreased. After 30 days, the accumulation of NSs in the heart, lung, and kidney was almost zero, and only a small amount of NSs remained in the liver and the spleen. Therefore, we speculated that the NSs would be completely excreted out of the body after two or three months. In addition, in view of the early accumulation of NSs in some normal organs, the biocompatibility and biosafety of NSH700 NSs was further evaluated via hematological, histological, and immunological indices. For immune toxicity detection, the amount of IFN-γ, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-12 + P40 in the serum samples from mice 12 h and 24 h post i.v. injection of NSH700 NSs (10 mg kg−1) were measured. Fig. S20 (ESI†) shows that all cytokine levels were nearly the same as those in the control group. For the histology and hematology assays, routine blood examination was conducted 1, 7, and 14 days after i.v. injection of NSH700 NSs (10 mg kg−1). As shown in Fig. S21 (ESI†), the amount of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), white blood cells (WBC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), red blood cells (RBC), platelet (PLT), hemoglobin (HGB), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), creatinine (Cr), lymphocyte (LYM), hematocrit (HCT), and neutrophil (NEU) were not statistically different from those in the control group. In addition, the influence of NSH700 NSs on some major organs was detected through H&E staining. Fig. S22 (ESI†) shows that no detectable injury could be observed in the major organs, including heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney. These data further confirmed that the obtained NSH700 NSs are biocompatible in vivo.
Conclusion
In summary, a heterojunction structure based on NSH700 NSs with piezo-photocatalytic effect was synthesized by coupling simple calcination and liquid exfoliation, and was firstly applied to efficiently induce intracellular ROS burst and apoptosis of cancer cells. Under the co-irradiation of light and US, NSH700 NSs exhibits superior catalytic activity, exceeding the sum of the light and ultrasonic independently, outperforming most state-of-the art photo- or sono-sensitizers reported in the literature under similar conditions. The considerably high piezo-photocatalytic activity and curative effect should be attributed to efficient charge separation and transfer in the bulk and the interface derived from the polarized electric field, band bending, and the unique heterojunction structure. The modulation of TME through the oxidation of GSH and two ROSs generation through the reduction of O2 and the oxidation of H2O efficiently destroys the intracellular redox equilibrium and induces the apoptosis of cancer cells. This study exposes the promising prospect of utilizing light and mechanical energy in the generation of ROS, aiming at a wide area of energy, environmental, and biomedical applications.

New concepts
Catalytic therapies generate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that trigger target cell apoptosis. The current strategies are limited by the rapid recombination of charges (electron–hole pairs) in the bulk or surface of employed catalysts. Herein, the concept of piezo-photocatalytic therapy has been demonstrated to improve electron–hole pair separation both in the bulk and their interface, thereby inducing intracellular ROS burst and cancer cells apoptosis. A heterojunction structure based on thermally treated natural sphalerite nanosheets (NSH700 NSs) with piezo-photocatalytic effect was prepared through calcination and liquid exfoliation. The formation of a polarized electric field and band bending in the NSH700 NS heterojunction under ultrasound (US) and light irradiation allow the directional separation of charges both in the bulk and their interface. Significantly, the piezo-photocatalytic effect leads to efficient catalytic performance, exhibiting high-performance superoxide radical (˙O2−) and hydroxyl radical (˙OH) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. The resulting intracellular ROS burst-triggered the apoptosis of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. As far as it is known, this is the first study to report piezo-photocatalytic cancer therapy based a heterojunction structure, and provides a strong experimental basis for applying this strategy in other biomedical applications.
