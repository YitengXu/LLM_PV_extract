    , Accepted 6th November 2016First published on 7th December 2016AbstractTwo easily accessible π-conjugated pyrene sulfonates, 1-pyrenesulfonic acid sodium salt (PyS) and 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (PyTS), as cathode interfacial layers (CILs) for polymer solar cells (PSCs) are demonstrated. The two interlayer materials, with polar sulfonates directly linking to a conjugated unit, are quite different from other kinds of interfacial materials with functional groups attached to non-conjugated alkyl chains. Moreover, the two molecules show distinct intramolecular dipoles. PyS with a strong permanent dipole moment can reduce the work function of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) films, while centrosymmetric PyTS with no overall dipole has little effect on the work function of BHJ films. It is also found that PyS based devices show much improved charge transport ability and conductivity than those based on PyTS. As a result, PyS based devices exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.46% for the PBDTTT-C:PC71BM system, while PyTS based devices show a relatively low PCE of 6.28%. A higher efficiency of 8.82% is achieved for PTB7-Th as the donor. In addition, benefitting from the planar structure of the pyrene units, PyS with high conductivity can function efficiently in a wide thickness range of 2 to 41 nm.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted continuously growing attention in the past few decades due to their potential applications in lightweight, flexible and large-area devices by low-cost solution processing.1,2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs has reached 12%.3,4 For conventional PSCs, a commonly used cathode is thermally evaporated Ca/Al, which is readily oxidized in air, and hence damages the performance of PSCs.5,6 Therefore various cathode interfacial layers (CILs) are developed as the substitute for Ca and they show excellent effects on optimizing the device performance. For example, metal fluorides, metal oxides, and low work function cathodes have been reported to improve the cathode contact.7,8 Currently the most popular CILs are water/alcohol soluble polymers and organic small molecules.9–12 Compared to polymers, small molecules have advantages of easy modification and purification, well-defined structures, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility.13 Successful small molecular cathode interlayers include fullerene derivatives,14–16 perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives,13 metallophthalocyanine (MPc) derivatives,17,18 porphyrin derivatives,19 ionic liquids,20,21 and so on.
In typical small molecule cathode interface materials, such as electrolytes and zwitterions,22–25 ammonium is widely used as the cation moiety, while sulfonate is a favorite anion candidate.13,16,26 However, the sulfonate anions are usually attached to non-conjugated alkyl chains, which shows relatively low electron mobility and conductivity, and therefore these interlayers only work efficiently when a very thin film is employed. In view of potential advantages of π-conjugated semiconductors from the aspects of molecular packing, it will be interesting to directly link sulfonate groups onto conjugated building blocks for the improvement of charge carrier mobility and conductivity. In this work, two new small molecule interlayer materials with conjugated pyrene as the central core substituted by one (PyS) and four (PyTS) nonacid sodium sulfonate groups (Fig. 1) for PSCs were investigated. The two conjugated molecules are commercially available, which are more accessible than those reported CILs prepared by complicated synthesis. PyS with one polar group has a large permanent dipole moment (4.85 debye), while PyTS shows no overall dipole (0 debye) due to the symmetrical arrangement of polar groups around pyrene. The two molecules with entirely different polarities show remarkable difference in energy-level alignment at the interface of organic semiconductors and electrodes, and therefore result in distinct device performances. Using PBDTTT-C:PC71BM (PBDTTT-C:poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexan-oyl)-thieno[3,4-b] thiophene)-2,6-diyl] PC71BM: [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester) as the active layer, a PCE of 7.46% for PyS based devices was achieved, much higher than that of PyTS-based devices (6.28%). Furthermore, the investigation of the dependence of device performance on the CIL thickness shows that PyS can function efficiently in a wide thickness range of 2 to 41 nm. Our results suggest that pyrene-based water/alcohol soluble small molecules are promising interlayer materials for PSCs and could be potentially used in R2R processed large-area optoelectronic devices.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Fabrication of PSCs
The ITO/glass substrates were cleaned sequentially by sonication with acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol and then dried in a N2 flow, followed by ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) treatment. A PEDOT:PSS layer (∼40 nm) was spin-coated on the ITO substrate and dried at 160 °C for 15 min in air. A blended solution was prepared by mixing PBDTTT-C and PC71BM in a 1:1.5 weight ratio into o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) with DIO as the additive (ODCB:DIO = 97:3, v/v). The PBDTTT-C:PC71BM layer was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS film with a thickness of ∼70 nm. The PTB7-Th/PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w) layer was deposited onto the PEDOT:PSS film by spin-coating the chlorobenzene solution (CB:DIO = 97:3, v/v). The thickness of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blended layers was ∼100 nm. The PyS or PyTS dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 0.05–2.5 mg mL−1 was spun onto the active layer at the same speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s to tune the thickness of CILs. The Al electrode (100 nm) was finally deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask under a pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa.
2.2 Measurements and characterization
The J–V curves of all devices were measured with an efficient area of 6.4 mm2. The device photocurrent was measured under an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Taiwan, Entelich) at illumination of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell with a KG5 filter. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the devices were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The thickness of the interlayer films was determined using a Profilometer (Bruker). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography images and roughness analysis were obtained by using a Multimode Nanoscope III-D atomic force microscope (Bruker) in the tapping mode. The work functions of the films were measured by the scanning Kelvin probe method (Bruker). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out under an inert atmosphere by using tetra-n-butylammoniumhexafluoro-phosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M in acetonitrile) as the supporting electrolyte with a glass carbon electrode as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as an internal standard, which was assigned an absolute energy of −4.8 eV vs. vacuum level.
3. Results and discussion
The two pyrene sulfonates are easily soluble in polar solvents, such as water and methanol, which provides orthogonal solubility to chlorinated solvents employed in the processing of organic semiconductors. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of both molecules are shown in Fig. 1c. In methanol, the band shape of absorption spectra of PyS and PyTS resemble each other, whereas the absorption peak of PyTS is obviously red-shifted compared with that of PyS. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were used to determine the frontier molecular orbitals of the molecules in the thin films. Based on the onset reduction potential (Fig. 1d), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PyS and PyTS are estimated to be −3.58 eV and −3.54 eV, respectively. The low-lying LUMOs of PyS and PyTS were close to that of PCBM, which can facilitate electron transport from the fullerene to the cathode. From the onset oxidation potential, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PyS and PyTS are estimated to be −5.96 eV and −5.83 eV, respectively. The two molecules with pyrene as the central core provide a large band gap and a deep HOMO level, which is a key parameter for CILs to block holes from transporting to cathode with respect to various donor materials.27
The effects of the two molecules as the CILs for PSCs were evaluated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM/PyS or PyTS/Al (Fig. 1a). It was demonstrated that methanol treatment of the active layer can improve the performance of the PSCs due to the passivation of surface traps and a corresponding increase of surface charge density in the active layer.28,29 Therefore, reference devices with and without methanol treatment of the active layer were also fabricated. The device performances are summarized in Table 1. For the PyS based device, a PCE of 7.46% is obtained, which is over two times higher than that of the Al-only device (3.12%). Notably, this value is even significantly higher than that of the device with methanol treatment (5.32%). The PyTS-based device also exhibits a PCE of 6.28%. The results indicate that the pyrene sulfonates are a promising type of CILs.

The effect of CIL thickness on the performance of the devices based on PBDTTT-C:PC71BM was then investigated. The thickness of PyS or PyTS was modulated by changing their concentrations from 0.05 to 2.5 mg mL−1. The J–V curves of the devices with various thicknesses of PyS are shown in Fig. 2c and the device performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. The best PCE (7.46%) was achieved with a 5 nm PyS layer. Increasing the CIL thickness to 22 nm leads to a slight decrease of PCE to 6.65%, induced by a reduction of JSC from 15.80 to 14.06 mA cm−2. When the thickness of PyS reaches 41 nm, the device still shows a PCE of 5.59%. The series resistance (RS) increased from 5.33 to 10.12 Ω cm2 when the thickness increased from 5 nm to 41 nm, which was in agreement with the trend of efficiency decrease. However, when the thickness of PyTS increased from 12 nm to 23 nm, the PCE reduced from 6.28% to 4.41% due to the decrease of JSC (14.82 mA cm−2vs. 12.05 mA cm−2) and FF (0.58 vs. 0.51), accompanied by an increase of RS from 7.69 Ω cm2 to 11.31 Ω cm2. The increased RS indicates the poor charge transport of the devices with a thick layer of PyS or PyTS, as shown in Table 2.

The surface morphology of the various CILs was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). All samples were prepared under the same conditions as device fabrication. The AFM images are shown in Fig. 3a–d. The pristine PBDTTT-C:PC71BM film exhibits a very smooth surface with the surface root mean square roughness (RMS) of 1.479 nm. The methanol treated film has a similar RMS of 1.489 nm and shows no distinguished difference in morphology. When the active layer film is covered by PyS (5 nm), PyS distributes uniformly on the active layer, and the RMS of the surface slightly increases to 1.588 nm (Fig. 3c). However, in the case of the PBDTTT-C:PC71BM/PyTS layer, the film exhibits a much rougher surface with a RMS of 6.038 nm. Notably, there are some visible islands distributed randomly over the surface, probably owing to the self-aggregation of PyTS.

Bottom: Surface potential images of the PBDTTT-C:PC71BM film (e), and treated by methanol (f), PyS interlayer (g), and PyTS interlayer (h). 
We also investigated the morphology of the CILs with different thicknesses on PBDTTT-C:PC71BM. As seen in Fig. S1,† PyS atop the active layer can form uniform films in a wide range of thicknesses (2–41 nm), while for PyTS the films show much rougher surface morphology due to its self-aggregation on the active layer (Fig. S2†). This is reasonable in consideration of the hydrophobic surface of the active layer and the strong hydrophilic properties of PyTS with four polar sulfonate groups. Moreover, the film roughness increases with the increasing film thickness. The rough morphology of PyTS on the active layer is unfavorable for the device performance due to the non-uniform coverage of the active layer. Different film formation properties of the two molecules atop the hydrophobic active layer might be one of the reasons why the devices with PyS as the CIL show better performance and less thickness dependence of the CIL than the case of PyTS.
To study the charge transport properties of the CILs, the charge carrier mobilities were measured using the space charge limited current method. Electron-only devices were fabricated using the architecture of ITO/Al/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM/CILs/Al and tested in the dark. J–V characteristics (Fig. S3a†) of single-carrier devices were measured and the electron mobilities of the devices were calculated by fitting to the Mott–Gurney law (Fig. S3c†).30 As shown in Table 3, it is clear that the electron mobility increases by two times from 2.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the pristine blend film without any treatment to 5.80 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the film with methanol treatment. In comparison, the mobilities of the devices with PyS and PyTS as CILs are 2.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. On the other hand, hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C:PC71BM/CILs/MoO3/Au were fabricated. The hole mobilities of the devices were determined to be 1.28 × 10−4 and 6.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PBDTTT-C:PC71BM/PyS and PBDTTT-C:PC71BM/PyTS films, respectively, which are much higher than those of the pristine films (2.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Obviously, upon the incorporation of PyS or PyTS as the CILs, both the electron and hole mobilities increase, and the mobility of the PyS based devices increases more significantly. This is in agreement with the increasing trend of PCEs in PSCs as listed in Table 1.

The pyrene core possesses a coplanar structure, which is more likely to form ordered molecular arrangement, offering high mobility and conductivity. These properties are favorable for developing thickness-independent CILs.31 To further understand the difference of the device performances with PyS and PyTS based CILs, the conductivities of the two CILs were measured with a configuration of ITO/CILs/Al (Fig. S4†). The conductivity measurements demonstrate that PyS has a slightly higher conductivity (5.78 × 10−6 S cm−1) than that of PyTS (4.01 × 10−6 S cm−1). The high conductivities can also account for the observed low RS values of these pyrene-based devices, with more prominent performance for PyS-based devices due to its higher conductivity. This is also a reason for the less thickness dependence on device performance.
Finally, the effect of the various CILs on the work function (WF) of the active layer was studied by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM), and the results are shown in Fig. 3e–h. Each value was calculated relative to the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), which was given a reference value of 4.60 eV.32 The WF of the original PBDTTT-C:PC71BM film was measured to be 4.72 eV. Methanol treatment reduced the WF by 0.04 eV. After deposition of an ultrathin layer of PyS (5 nm), the WF decreased to 4.56 eV. However, the WF of PBDTTT-C:PC71BM/PyTS (12 nm) remained basically unchanged (4.73 eV). It was surprising that PyTS exhibited no WF reduction, and still showed a high Voc (0.73 V) within PSCs.
Previous studies proposed that polar organic molecules can induce a large interfacial dipole on the conducting surface, leading to better energy level alignment to enhance the device performance.33–36 However, non-polar molecules containing polar groups as CILs have never been reported. Our results indicate that in addition to having appropriate energy levels, PyS with high polarity can contribute to the formation of an interfacial dipole when the molecule is associated with the conductive surface. For nonpolar PyTS, no interfacial dipole was found between the active layer and the interlayer according to the SKPM results. Besides, a potential molecular orientation of PyS on the hydrophobic active layer could also induce the interfacial dipole formation at the cathode interface. In order to figure this out, measurements of the water contact angle were performed on the surface of PBDTTT-C:PC71BM films with various treatments. The results (see details in ESI, Fig. S5†) indicate the accumulation of an ionic component at the topmost organic surface, which suggests that the sulfonate group in PyS tends to orient upward while the pyrene ring faces the active layer. As a result, we hypothesize that the interfacial dipole formed at the cathode interface may origin from the intrinsic intramolecular dipole and the possible molecular orientation of PyS, which lowers the WF of the active layer and contributes to the favorable energy level alignment at the organic/cathode interface, thus enhancing the device performance. For the PyTS, such a molecular orientation could not be expected because of symmetrical locations of four polar groups and its ease of aggregation as mentioned above. The PCE improvement of the PyTS-based devices can thus only be ascribed to the appropriate LUMO and HOMO levels to transport electrons and block holes.
Inspired by these outstanding properties of the pyrene sulfonate CILs, we further tested their performances in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system. The CILs with optimized thicknesses of 5 nm for PyS and 12 nm for PyTS were employed. The J–V characteristics of the devices under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation are presented in Fig. 4, and the performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. As we expected, introducing PyS as the CIL led to enhanced JSC from 17.60 to 18.10 mA cm−2, Voc from 0.62 to 0.78 V, and FF from 0.46 to 0.62, consequently resulting in a PCE of 8.82%, which is much higher than that of the Al-only device (5.04%). And the devices incorporating PyTS also have higher PCE values than those with the conventional Al cathodes.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, two easy-accessible water/alcohol soluble pyrene sulfonate small molecules are employed as CILs for efficient PSCs. The highly polar PyS shows a PCE of 7.46% in the PBDTTT-C/PC71BM system, while the nonpolar PyTS exhibits a relatively low PCE of 6.28%. A higher efficiency of 8.82% is also achieved for PTB7-Th as the donor. Further studies reveal that PyS with a large dipole moment induces favorable energy level alignment at the cathode interface, while PyTS with no overall dipole induces a little energy level shift at the interface. Therefore, intramolecular dipoles could be particularly important in developing high performance organic interlayer materials. Moreover, the uniform film forming properties, high charge carrier mobility and high conductivity of PyS also make it a thickness-insensitive cathode interlayer material. This work demonstrates that PyS is promising as a low-cost and eco-friendly cathode interlayer in PSCs, and intramolecular dipoles could be particularly useful for developing high performance organic interlayer materials.
