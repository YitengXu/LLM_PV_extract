    , Accepted 18th July 2018First published on 18th July 2018AbstractSelf-assembly of sensitizer and acceptor molecules has recently emerged as a promising strategy to facilitate and harness photon upconversion via triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA-UC). In addition to the energetic requirements, the structure and relative orientation of these molecules can have a strong influence on TTA-UC rates and efficiency. Here we report the synthesis of five different acceptor molecules composed of an anthracene core functionalized with 9,10- or 2,6-phenyl, methyl, or directly bound phosphonic acid groups and their incorporation into self-assembled bilayers on a ZrO2 surface. All five films facilitate green-to-blue photon upconversion with Φuc as high as 0.0023. The efficiency of TTA, and not triplet energy transfer, fluorescence, or losses via FRET, was primarily responsible for dictating the Φuc emission. Even for molecules having similar photophysical properties, variation in the position of the phosphonic acid resulted in dramatically different ΦTTA, Ith values, γTTA, and D. Interestingly, we observed a strong linear correlation between ΦTTA and the Ith value but the cause of this relationship, if any, is unclear.
1. Introduction
Photon upconversion via triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA-UC), wherein two low energy photons are combined to generate a higher energy excited state, is of interest for a number of applications including bioimaging,1,2 oxygen sensing,2 photocatalysis,3 and solar energy conversion.4–11 Regarding the latter, TTA-UC is particularly intriguing since it provides a means of surpassing the Shockly–Queisser limit (∼33%)12 and increase maximum theoretical solar cell efficiencies to upwards of 43% under AM 1.5 solar irradiation.9,13,14
During TTA-UC, a sensitizer molecule (S) absorbs a low energy photon, then undergoes intersystem crossing followed by triplet energy transfer to an acceptor (a.k.a. an annihilator or emitter) molecule (A). When two A triplet excited states are in proximity they can undergo TTA where emission from the resulting singlet excited state is hypsochromically shifted relative to the excitation light and thus the photon energy is upconverted during the process.
A majority of TTA-UC research has been performed with sensitizer and accepter molecules suspended in solution or a rubbery polymer matrix.15–21 Through this effort, a great deal has been learned about how the thermodynamics of the molecules suspended in a medium can influence TTA-UC. For example, subtle variations in the structure of the prototypical anthracene acceptor molecule22 can have a large impact on the triplet excited state lifetime, singlet/triplet potential energy surface, and ultimately the TTA-UC yield.23–25
Building upon these host-based UC schemes, recently there has been a sharp increase in using supramolecular assemblies26,27 like micelles/lipid membranes,28 polymers/dendrimers,29,30 host–guest interactions,31 ionic crystals,32 and MOFs33,34 to facilitate TTA-UC. Of the assembly strategies, binding S and A molecules on nanocrystalline metal oxide surfaces (TiO2 or ZrO2) has emerged as a means of not only facilitating UC emission,10,35–38 but also extracting charge from the upconverted state and directly harnessing TTA-UC in a solar cell.5,6,10,33,39,40 Self-assembled bilayers (Fig. 1) are particularly promising in that under solar flux, TTA-UC photocurrents of >0.1 mA cm−2 have been achieved which is above the device relevance threshold proposed by Schmidt and coworkers.41
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the self-assembled bilayer on ZrO2 and structures for Pt(II)-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (S) and acceptor molecules (1–5). 
The bilayer films are prepared by stepwise soaking42 of a metal oxide film in a solution of A, then linking metal ions, and finally S.39 Unlike in a solvent or host matrix, where molecules are relatively free to rotate and collide, these assembled systems geometrically restrict the mobility and orientation of the S and A molecules. Thus, in addition to the energetic influence noted above, presumably structural variations that tune the intermolecular distance and orientation are critical in dictating TTA-UC rates and efficiencies.
Recently, our group reported that for two energetically similar diphenylanthracene molecules (1 and 2 in Fig. 1), changing the phosphonate metal ion binding group from the para- to the meta-position results in a 3-fold decrease in the TTA-UC emission quantum yield.11 In an effort to further elucidate the role of the acceptor structure on TTA-UC in bilayer films, here we report the synthesis of three new anthracene dyes substituted at the 9,10- or 2,6-positions with phosphonate metal ion binding groups (Fig. 1). The photophysical properties of dyes 1–5 in solution, on films and combined with Pt(II)-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (S) sensitizer in the bilayer film are described.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
1,4-Dibromobenzene, 1,3-dibromobenzene, anthraquinone, n-butyl lithium, nickel bromide, triethylphosphite, trimethylsilyl bromide, toluene, benzene, benzyl alcohol, N,N-dimethylformamide, aluminium chloride, chromium(VI) oxide, copper(II) sulfate, zinc powder, potassium carbonate, N-bromosuccinimide, 9,10-dibromoanthracene, acetic anhydride, 95% sulfuric acid, glacial acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, ammonium hydroxide solution, bis(dichloromethyl)anthracene, iodomethane, 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone, phosphorus tribromide, lithium aluminium hydride, zinc acetate dihydrate, and Pt(II) meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (Frontier Scientific), were purchased from their respective suppliers, in parentheses, and used as received.
All other reagents and solvents (analytical reagent grade) have been purchased and used without further purification from Alfa Aesar. Tetrahydrofuran and dichloro-methane used in synthesis have been dried and degassed prior to use. Glass substrates were purchased from Hartford Glass Co. Meltonix film (1170-25) and a Vac’n Fill Syringe (65209) were purchased from Solaronix. Micro glass cover slides (18 × 18 mm) were obtained from VWR. ZrO2 sol–gel paste and nanocrystalline films were prepared following previously reported procedures.43–45
2.2 Sample preparation – device fabrication
Spectroscopic samples were prepared in a sandwich cell-type architecture.5,6,11,39,40,46 Briefly, glass was cut into 2.2 × 2.2 cm pieces, and an active area of 1 cm2 metal oxide was prepared by doctor blading ZrO2 (1 layer of Scotch tape) and sintering. Dyes were then loaded onto the metal oxide, as described below. A small hole (d = 1.1 mm) was drilled into the corner of the 2.2 × 2.2 cm glass slide. A 2 mm wide 2.2 × 2.2 cm Meltonix film was placed between the two glass slides, and the entire ensemble was heated to ∼150 °C for 7 s using a home-built heating/sealing apparatus described previously.47 The cells were then transferred to a glovebox (a VTI Universal purified glovebox, N2 atmosphere) where dry and oxygen-free acetonitrile was injected using a Vac’n Fill Syringe through the 1 mm hole to fill the interior of the cells. A meltonix film and small piece of a micro glass cover slide were then heated to seal the hole used for solvent injection.
2.3 Sample preparation – film formation
Photophysical cells were prepared following our previously published procedure with minor modification.5,6,11,39,40,46 Adsorption isotherms of the A molecules on ZrO2 were measured by immersing thin films in 3 mL of DMSO solutions of 1–5 with concentrations of 25, 50, 70, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 μM. The slides were removed, rinsed with methanol, and dried under a stream of air. More details will be seen in the results and discussion section.
2.4 Surface area measurement
The surface area of the ZrO2 nanocrystalline film was determined from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K (Quantachrome Corportion, Autosorb iQ.). The surface area was determined using the BET equation.48 The samples were degassed under vacuum (5 × 10−3 mmHg) at 120 °C for 4 h, prior to measurement, to evacuate physiosorbed moisture. The surface area was calculated to be 113.6 m2 g−1. 4 strips of 10 cm × 1.5 cm ZrO2 film were scraped off the glass and dried in an oven overnight. It yielded 30.1 mg, which further gives the surface area (A1×1) of a 1 cm × 1 cm area of film as 565 cm2.
2.5 Photostability measurements
The light from a blue (375 nm, fwhm ∼30 nm, 1.53 mW cm−2) mounted high power LED (Thorlabs, Inc., M455L2) powered by a T-Cube LED driver (Thorlabs, Inc., LEDD1B) was used. The light output was directed onto the derivatized thin films placed at 45° in a standard 10 mm path length cuvette containing 3 mL of MeCN. The illumination spot was adjusted to coincide both with the thin films and the perpendicular beam path of a Varian Cary 50 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The absorption spectrum (360–800 nm) of the film was obtained every 10 s for 11600 s (decreased by 5% after the first 4000 s of measurement). The incident light intensity was measured using a thermopile detector (a Newport Corp 1918-C meter and a 818P-020-12 detector). The solution temperature, 22 ± 2 °C, was consistent throughout the duration of the experiment.
2.6 Absorption measurements
Absorption spectra were recorded using an Agilent 8453 UV-visible photo diode array spectrophotometer. Extinction coefficients for A in DMSO were determined from the absorption spectra of solutions with a known concentration of dye in a 1 × 1 cm quartz cuvette. Thin film absorption spectra were obtained by placing dry, derivatized ZrO2 slides perpendicular to the detection beam path.
2.7 Steady-state emission
An Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer was used to collect emission data at room temperature. A housed 450 W Xe lamp/single grating (1800 λ/mm, 250 nm blaze) Czerny–Turner monochromator or a Nd:YAG laser (Aixiz, AD-532-400T) was used as an output to excite the samples. The Nd:YAG laser was passed through a variable neutral density filter (Edinburgh F-B01 laser mount), a 2 mm diameter iris (Newport ID-1.0) and then directed to the sample via a flip mirror. Emission from the sample was passed through a 532 nm notch filter (Thorlabs Inc., NF533-17), the single grating (1800 λ/mm, 500 nm blaze) Czerny–Turner monochromator and then detected by a Peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube. A power meter (Ophir Vega 7Z01560) with a high sensitivity power sensor (Ophir 3A-FS 7Z02628) was used to measure laser intensities. Fluorescence quantum yields of A in DMSO are estimated relative to DPA in EtOH (ΦF = 95%)49 by ,39 where IA and IDPA are the integrated emission intensities of A in DMSO and DPA in EtOH (from 380–550 nm) under excitation at 360 nm, respectively. AA and ADPA are their respective absorbances at 360 nm. 1.3650 and 1.4751 are used for the refractive indices of ηA and ηDPA. Emission quantum yields for upconverted emission from ZrO2–A–Zn–S (A = 2–5) are estimated relative to ZrO2–1–Zn–S using equation  where IUC and IUC1 are the integrated emission intensities of ZrO2–1–Zn–S and ZrO2–A–Zn–S, respectively. AUC and AUC1 are their respective absorbances at 532 nm. Given the similar cell architecture, composed of glass, ZrO2 and MeCN, the refractive indices (ηUC and ηUC1) are assumed to be the same for both samples. The emission intensities were acquired with 532 nm excitation (2.5 W cm−2) using the sandwich cell architecture placed at an ∼45 degree angle relative to the incident excitation. Emission, perpendicular to the incident laser, was passed through a 532 nm notch filter (Thorlabs Inc., NF533-17) before entering the monochromator/detector.
2.8 Time-resolved emission
Emission decay kinetics, not including TTA-UC emission, were collected at room temperature using an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer. The emission decay traces were acquired using either time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC; 1024 channels; a 200 ns window) with data collection for 10000 counts or multichannel scaling (MCS) acquisition mode with 532 nm excitation from a 60 W microsecond flashlamp (pulse width < 2.5 μs) at a 100 Hz repetition rate for lifetime measurements of A and PtP, respectively. TCSPC excitation was provided by an Edinburgh EPL-360 ps pulsed light emitting diode (360 ± 10 nm, pulse width 892 ps) operated at 10 MHz. Emission was passed through a single grating (1800 λ/mm, 500 nm blaze) Czerny–Turner monochromator and detected by a Peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube. Emission decay kinetics for the films were fitted with a biexponential function y = A1e−k1x + A2e−k2x + y0 using the Edinburgh software package, and a weighted average lifetime calculated using 〈τ〉 = ∑Aiτi2/∑Aiτ.
TTA-UC emission decays for A and PtP in DMSO used to determine τA3 were collected using an Edinburgh Instruments LP980-KS laser flash photolysis spectrometer. Measurements were carried out using sealed 1 × 1 cm quartz cuvettes containing oxygen free DSMO solutions. The spectrometer is composed of a Continuum Surelite EX Nd:YAG laser combined with a Continuum Horizon OPO (532 nm, 5–7 ns, operated at 1 Hz, beam diameter ∼0.5 cm, 2.5–5 mJ per pulse) integrated into the Edinburgh LP980 spectrometer. For time-resolved scans, the emission was passed through a TMS302-A monochromator (1800 grooves per mm grating) with a 300 mm focal length in the Czerny Turner configuration and detected by a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube. Edinburgh's L900 (version 8.2.3, build 0) software package was used to process detector outputs. As with emission, the decay kinetics were fit using a biexponential function, and the results are presented as a weighted average lifetime.
3. Result and discussion
3.1 Acceptor design and synthesis
Acceptor molecules 4,4-(anthracene-9,10-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene) diphosphonic acid (1),39 and 4,4′-(anthracene-9,10-diyl)bis(3,1-phenylene)diphosphonic acid (2)11 were prepared by following previously published procedures. Anthracene-9,10-diphosphonic acid (3)52 and anthracene-9,10-diylbis(methylene)diphosphonic acid (4)53 were prepared by first generating the ethyl ester compounds from 9,10-dibromo anthracene and 9,10-bis(dichloromethyl)anthracene, respectively, using variations of the Arbuzov reaction,54 followed by ester group cleavage using TMS-Br.
The multistep synthesis of 2,6-anthracenediylbis(methylene)bisphosphonic acid (5) is shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, 2,6-dimethylanthracene (5a) was prepared from benzyl alcohol following the procedure of Cao et al.55 Initially we attempted to generate 2,6-bis(bromomethyl)anthracene (5d) using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) following a previously published procedure.56 However, bromination of the methyl substituents was unsuccessful presumably due to the higher reactivity of the 9 and 10 positions of the anthracene core.57,58 Instead the product was synthesized by oxidizing the methyl groups with CrO3 (5b), followed by reduction and rearomatization of the anthroquinone core, and further reduction to obtain 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)anthracene (5c). Bromination at the methyl positions was then achieved with PBr3 (5d) followed by an Arbuzov reaction and finally ester group cleavage to yield 5.

3.2 Solution photophysics
The photophysical properties of 1–5 dissolved in DMSO are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, the absorption spectral features of 1–5 are similar to the characteristic vibronic progression of anthracene.59 Relative to the parent anthracene (λabs = 380 nm; Fig. S1, ESI†), the substituted compounds exhibit a bathochromic shift in the order 5 (λ = 385 nm) < 1 (λ = 398 nm) ≈ 2 (λ = 398 nm) < 4 (λ = 406 nm) < 3 (λ = 410 nm). Similar to that of 9,10-diphenylanthracene, the bathochromic shift in 1 and 2 is due to increased conjugation between the anthracene core and the phenyl substituents at the 9,10-positions.59 As noted previously,11 absorption energies and extinction coefficients of 1 and 2 are similar indicating that the phosphonate groups are sufficiently decoupled so as to not strongly influence the anthracene chromophoric unit. While 4 and 5 are both methylphosphonic acid derivatives, substitution at the 9,10-position (4) results in a 0.25 eV hypsochromic shift relative to anthracene, whereas 2,6-substitution (5) has a nominal effect on the absorption energy but lowers the extinction coefficient. A similar spectral shift has been observed by Jones et al. for dimethylanthracene where this behavior is attributed to greater π electron delocalization at the 9,10-position relative to the 2,6-position.59 Compound 3 exhibits the largest hypsochromic shift presumably due to the electron withdrawing PO3H2 groups being bound directly to the anthracene core. The trend in emission energies for 1–5 (Fig. 2b) is comparable to that observed for their absorption. However, while the quantum yields (ΦFL > 0.80) as well as radiative (kr ≈ 1 × 108 s−1) and non-radiative (knr ≈ 1 × 107 s−1) rates are similar for 1–4, there is a notable decrease in the emission quantum yield for 5 (ΦFL = 0.14) which is due to the four-fold decrease in kr (2.4 × 107 s−1) and an order of magnitude increase in knr (1.5 × 108 s−1).

3.3 ZrO2–A film formation, photophysics, and photostability
The bilayer films were prepared using a step-wise soaking procedure first implemented by Mallouk, Haga, and others on planar surfaces45,60,61 and then later extended to mesoporous substrates.42 Briefly, nanocrystalline ZrO2 is first soaked in a DMSO solution of A for 12 hours, then ZnII, and finally a DMSO solution of S.39 Each step of the surface modification procedure was monitored by UV-vis or attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy. ZrO2 was chosen as the substrate for this work because of its relatively high conduction band potential which inhibits excited state electron transfer from the dyes to the metal oxide surface and thus emission can be observed without concerns of quenching by the substrate.62,63
The binding of 1–5 to ZrO2 obeys Langmuir isotherm behavior64 with the maximum surface coverage (Γmax) and the surface adsorption constant (Kad) reported in Table 2. Surface coverages (Γ in mol cm−2) are estimated with the expression Γ = (A(λ)/ε(λ))/1000, where A(λ) is the maximum absorbance of each molecule on the slides and ε is the molecular molar extinction coefficient for the dyes in DMSO.65 From the isotherms (Fig. S2, ESI†), it was determined that a 250 μM solution of 1 and 300 μM solutions of 2–5 were sufficient to achieve high surface loadings (∼1 × 10−8 mol cm−2) and were used for all measurements reported below.

Because the Γmax values are only a relative estimate of surface coverage and are film thickness dependent, we sought to determine the center-to-center distance between A molecules (dA–A) and the results are summarized in Table 2. These values were determined by first quantifying the surface area of ZrO2 using BET isotherm measurements with N2 as the adsorbent. The dye molecules were then loaded on the surface under full coverage conditions, desorbed by soaking the films in a 0.1 M KOH solution, and the amount of loaded dye was calculated from the absorption intensity of the solution using Beer's law (see ESI† for more details). The dA–A values were then calculated from the surface area and total number of dye molecules assuming hexagonal packing of spherical molecules. dA–A for 1, 2, 4, and 5 were similar, ranging from 9–11 Å. Compound 3 exhibited the largest intermolecular spacing at 16 Å. Given the similarity in size of these molecules it is not entirely clear to us why 3 would exhibit a lower surface coverage and larger intermolecular distance. Regardless, all intermolecular spacings are sufficiently close such that intermolecular Dexter energy transfer66 and TTA can occur.67,68
The absorption and emission spectra for 1–5 bound to ZrO2 (herein referred to as ZrO2–A) are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. The dyes on ZrO2 exhibit similar absorption energies and spectral features as in solution (Fig. 3a). Upon excitation at 360 nm, blue emission is observed from all ZrO2–A films (Fig. 3b) with similar but broadened emission features when compared to in solution.

The photostability of acceptor molecules is critical to maintaining high TTA-UC efficiencies for long term applications. This is a particular concern with anthracene molecules since they are known to undergo dimerization and decomposition.69,70 With this in mind, the photostabilities of ZrO2–A films in MeCN were investigated following a previously published procedure71 by monitoring changes in the absorbance spectra of the films under continuous 365 nm irradiation (1.5 mW cm−2). The results for ZrO2–1 can be seen in Fig. 4a with the remaining spectra in the ESI.† For the films of 1–5 there is a uniform decrease in the absorption intensity at all wavelengths. There was no absorption from the external solution after irradiation and color did not return after heating the films to 80 °C overnight indicating that that the spectral changes are due to dye decomposition and not desorption or photo-dimerization of A.69 Under similar conditions but using deaerated MeCN, the decomposition is slowed by several orders of magnitude (Fig. S4, ESI†). Given their sensitivity to the atmosphere, the photoinduced dye decomposition is presumably due to the well known [4+2] cyclcoaddition of singlet oxygen across the 9,10-positions of anthracene.70
 Fig. 4  Changes in the absorption spectrum of (a) ZrO2–1 in MeCN under constant 365 nm (1.5 mW cm−2) irradiation from 0 (black) to 2 hours (green) and (b) the normalized absorbance intensity versus time for 1–5 on ZrO2 in MeCN. 
The time-dependent changes in absorption were fit with the biexponential function and are presented as an average decomposition rate constant (kdec) calculated as the inverse of the weighted-average lifetime (kdec = 〈τ〉−1), and the results are summarized in Table 2. The spectral change and desorption rate constant were reproducible within ±10% across two independently prepared samples.
Of the films, ZrO2–4 and ZrO2–5 were the least stable decomposing with a rate constant greater than 3 × 103 s−1. Slightly more stable (kdec = 2.6 × 103 s−1) were diphenyl substituted compound 1 and 2. Phenyl substituents are known to decrease reactivity at the 9,10-positions due to increased steric hindrance.72 Interestingly, compound 3 was the most stable of the series which may be due to similar steric hinderance and/or a change in reactivity at the 9,10 position due to the phosphonate groups.
3.4 ZrO2–A–Zn–S film formation
ZnII was chosen as the metal linking ion for bilayer film formation because it is photophysically and electrochemically inert under the measurement conditions applied here.73 ZnII coordination to the non-surface bound phosphonate groups of A was achieved by soaking the ZrO2–A films in a solution of 400 μM Zn(CH3COO)2 in methanol for 30 minutes.5,39,40,46 Metal ion coordination was monitored using ATR-IR spectroscopy and the results are shown in ESI.† All ZrO2–A films exhibit a peak at ∼950 cm−1 that is indicative of O–P–O bending of the non-surface bound PO3H2 group.74 Upon soaking ZrO2–A, the ∼950 cm−1 peak disappears with concomitant growth of features at 1000 to 1150 cm−1 consistent with metal ion coordination to the PO3H2 groups of 1–5.75
The bilayer film (ZrO2–A–Zn–S) was then prepared by submerging ZrO2–A–Zn in a 100 μM solution of S in DMSO. The soaking time for each film (see ESI† for treatment times) was varied to generate films with an A to S ratio of 10 to 1 which was previously reported to minimize “self-filtering” losses and maximize TTA-UC emission from bilayer films.39 Upon soaking ZrO2–A in a solution of S, without Zn(CH3COO)2 treatment, there was minimal absorption contribution from the porphyrin molecule (Fig. S6, ESI†). This observation indicates that the surface coverage of A is sufficiently high to inhibit the sensitizer from binding directly to the ZrO2 surface.
While we do not have direct structural information about the interface, the necessity of ZnII linking ions for S loading supports the formation of a bilayer architecture similar to that depicted in Fig. 1 and not a co-deposited film. The lack of structural data also brings into question the dynamic motion of the molecules on the surface which would influence the energy transfer and TTA dynamics. Previously published neutron scattering experiments76 and theoretical modelling77 of molecular monolayers on metal oxide surfaces indicate that at high surface loadings, the molecular rotation and cross-surface mobility are significantly limited by steric hindrance due to tight intermolecular packing. Presumably this molecular motion is further hindered in the bilayer film because of the layered structure but further structural characterization is necessary to test this hypothesis.

3.4.1 ZrO2–A–Zn–S TTA-UC emission. 
Samples for emission measurements were prepared in a glove box under a N2 atmosphere following a previously published procedure.39 Upon 532 nm excitation (3 W cm−2) all of the ZrO2–A–Zn–S films exhibit a blue emission feature from 420–500 nm (Fig. 5) that resembles emission from ZrO2–A under direct excitation of A at 360 nm. This is in contrast to ZrO2–A and ZrO2–S under 532 nm excitation where no emission was observed in this region due to the lack of absorption and lower energy emission (λem = 670 nm), respectively. The sharp increase in intensity above 500 nm in Fig. 5 can be attributed to scatter from the excitation source.

Upconverted emission quantum yields were measured relative to ZrO2–1–Zn–S (Φuc = 0.0023)39 and the results are summarized in Table 3. These measurements were performed under relatively high excitation intensities (3 W cm−2) to ensure that all samples are operating in the maximum efficiency, linear regime (vida infra). The highest quantum yield was observed with our prototype bilayer, ZrO2–1–Zn–S, and then decreases in the order 2 (0.0008) > 4 (0.0007) > 3 (0.0004) > 5 (0.0001).

The upconverted emission efficiency is equal to the products of the efficiency of each step in the TTA-UC process as shown in eqn (1),78 (1)where ΦISC is the intersystem crossing yield of the sensitizer molecule, ΦFL is the fluorescence quantum yield for A, ΦTET is the sensitizer-to-acceptor triplet energy transfer yield, Φout is the fraction of upconverted states that generate photons that exit the sample and ΦTTA is the efficiency of generating a singlet excited state via TTA. The two in the denominator is to account for the two photons in one photon out nature of the TTA-UC process. The measured and calculated quantum yield values for these events in the ZrO2–A–Zn–S films are summarized in Table 3. ΦISC was not measured directly here but is assumed to be 1.0 as near unity intersystem crossing yields are known for platinum(II)porphyrin molecules.78
Sensitizer-to-acceptor triplet energy transfer rates and yields were determined using time-resolved spectroscopy following previous published procedures.46 Briefly, the phosphorescent emission lifetime from the sensitizer molecule (λem = 670 nm) was monitored following 532 nm excitation of two different samples, ZrO2–A–Zn–S (τs(bl)) and ZrO2–B–Zn–S (τs). While the former samples exhibit porphyrin-to-anthracene TET, the latter contains terphenyl-4,4′′-diylbisphosphonic acid (B) which retains the bilayer structure but is a photo- and electrochemically inert structural analogue of the acceptor molecule that does not undergo TET.46,79 The triplet energy transfer rate (kTET) and yield (ΦTET) were calculated using eqn (2) and (3) (2) (3)and the results are summarized in Table 3.
The rate and efficiency of TET are primarily dictated by the thermodynamic driving-force for electron exchange and the distance between the donor (S) and acceptor (1–4) molecules.66 Of the acceptor molecules, 3 exhibited the fastest (kTET = 2.1 × 104 s−1) and most efficient (ΦTET = 0.59) TET. This high yield is presumably due to the lack of phenyl or methyl groups between the anthracene core and the phosphonate metal ion binding group, effectively decreasing the distance between S and 3. Based on the experimentally determined singlet excited state energies, one could assume that the triplet of 3 is also lower than the other complexes, and thus increases the driving force for TET, however we were unable to quantify the triplet energy by directly observing phosphorescent emission from 3, or any of the acceptor molecules reported here, even at low temperatures and in the presence of methyl iodide.80
Interestingly, 1 and 2 exhibit the same TET rates (kTET = 1.3 × 104 s−1) and efficiencies (ΦTET = 0.33). Given the difference in position of the surface/metal ion binding groups, one would anticipate differences in orientation and/or distance between S and 1 or 2 in the bilayer film. However, the similarity in the TET rate/yield suggests that energetics, which are similar for the two molecules, are primarily responsible for dictating TET. Likewise, the methyl phosphonate complexes 4 and 5 exhibit similar TET metrics.
As noted above, Φout is the fraction of upconverted states that generate photons that exit the sample. That is, photons that are not lost through quenching viaA-to-S Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET).81 Similar to the method described above for TET, FRET was quantified by measuring time-resolved emission at 470 nm upon direct excitation of A in films with, ZrO2–A–Zn–S (τA(bl)), and without, ZrO2–A (τA), sensitizer which in this case quenches A emission. The FRET rate (kFRET) and efficiency (ΦFRET) were calculated using eqn (4) and (5) (4) (5)and the results are summarized in Table 3.
The rate of FRET is dictated by the A and S dipole orientations, the spectral overlap between A emission and S absorption (J), and the distance between A and S.82,83

J values were calculated and the result can be seen in Table 3. Compounds 1 and 2 have similar J values of 2.6 × 10−11 cm3 M−1 and 2.8 × 10−11 cm3 M−1, respectively. Again, although we anticipate differences in orientation and distance between the donor and acceptor in ZrO2–1–Zn–S and ZrO2–2–Zn–S films, the J values, combined with the similarity in kFRET and ΦFRET, indicate that the differences in structure of these two bilayers play a nominal role in dictating FRET.
In contrast, compound 3 has a similar J value as 4 (3.3 × 10−11 cm3 M−1 and 3.4 × 10−11 cm3 M−1, respectively), but exhibits an order of magnitude faster FRET (kFRET = 2.4 × 108 s−1) and a more than two-fold higher FRET efficiency (ΦFRET = 0.38). As was used to rationalize differences in TET, the distance between S and 3 is presumably decreased relative to the other A molecules resulting in an increased rate and efficiency of FRET in ZrO2–3–Zn–S.
Interestingly, compound 5 exhibits the fastest (kFRET = 1.86 × 108 s−1) and most efficient (ΦFRET = 0.58) FRET despite the three orders of magnitude lower J value (2.8 × 10−14 cm3 M−1) relative to 1–4. Collectively these results suggest that both structural factors and spectral overlap can play a critical role in dictating energy transfer in the bilayer. Presumably, molecular engineering could be used to maximize TET but minimize losses due to FRET. Unfortunately, we have no direct structural information about the interface. Efforts are currently underway to use DFT and dynamic molecular mechanics simulations to understand the role of the average intermolecular distance and orientation in dictating FRET and TET. Assuming that FRET is the dominant mechanism quenching the singlet excited state of A, then Φout can be calculated using Φout = 1 − ΦFRET.
Using eqn (1) and the values reported above,78 the efficiency of triplet–triplet annihilation (ΦTTA), was calculated and the values are reported in Table 3. ΦTTA decreases in the order 1 (0.0057) > 5 (0.0027) > 2 (0.0020) > 4 (0.0013) > 3 (0.0009). Of the various steps responsible for TTA-UC, these relatively low numbers suggest that ΦUC in the bilayer films are primarily limited by the ΦTTA values.
For ZrO2–1–Zn–S, despite having the lowest ΦTET, a combination of large ΦFL, Φout, and ΦTTA results in the highest overall UC yield. In terms of the efficiency of each process, molecules 1 and 2 are comparable except that ΦTTA of 2 (ΦTTA = 0.0020) is ∼3 times lower than for 1 (ΦTTA = 0.0057) which is directly responsible for its lower ΦUC. Interestingly this observation suggests that while the difference in structure between 1 and 2 has no bearing on TET or FRET, it does impact the cross surface migration and TTA events that are responsible for ΦTTA.
While ΦTTA is larger in 5 than for 2–4, the drastically lower ΦFL and Φout result in the significantly lower overall emission from the upconverted state of 5. However, it is worth noting that in an integrated bilayer TTA-UC solar cell, electron injection from the UC state is typically much faster (∼1012 s−1)46 than the kr, knr, or kFRET values reported here (∼108 s−1) and may not be affected by ΦFL and Φout. As such we anticipate an increased photocurrent from 5 relative to 2–4. Such an observation would emphasize the importance of molecular design in targeting specific applications of TTA-UC. Device measurements for TiO2–A–Zn–S bilayers containing 1–5 are currently underway and will be reported at a later time.


3.4.2 TTA-UC intensity dependence. 
The emission intensity for ZrO2–A–Zn–S films with respect to the 532 nm excitation intensity are shown in Fig. 6.84,85 All five bilayers exhibited a quadratic (slope = 2) to linear (slope = 1) intensity dependence that is symptomatic of a TTA-UC mechanism.85 The quadratic to linear crossover intensities, also known as the Ith values,84 for ZrO2–A–Zn–S decrease in the order 3 (880 mW cm−2) ≈ 4 (870 mW cm−2) > 2 (790 mW cm−2) > 5 (750 mW cm−2) > 1 (470 mW cm−2).
 Fig. 6  Emission intensity versus 532 nm excitation intensity for ZrO2–A–Zn–S in MeCN where A = 1–5 (slopes of 1 and 2 are denoted by blue and green lines, respectively). 
The Ith value is inversely related to several parameters as described in eqn (6): (6)where τA3 is the triplet excited state lifetime of A, ΦTET is the TET efficiency, α(E) is the sensitizer absorption cross-section at 532 nm, and γTTA is the second-order rate constant for TTA.46
Following a previously published procedure,86τA3 was determined for each A, using τA3 = 2 × τUC, where τUC is obtained by tail fitting the TTA-UC emission decay at 430 nm for a DMSO solution of A and S after 532 nm excitation. As can be seen in Table 3, molecules 2–4 exhibit similar triplet excited state lifetimes on the order of 0.5 ms. In contrast, molecule 5 has the shortest lifetime of 0.07 ms which is in reasonable agreement with its singlet excited state behavior where it has an order of magnitude larger knr than the other molecules. Similar non-radiative decay channels may be accessible from the triplet state.
Strikingly, 1 has a τA3 that is four times larger than 2–5. This is particularly remarkable given that 1 and 2 give almost identical singlet excited state energetics and kinetics. It is possible that while the position of the phosphonate group has minimal influence on the singlet manifold, it may perturb the triplet state potential energy surface and lead to subsequent mixing/overlapping between states as previously observed by Gray et al.25
Using eqn (6), and the parameters listed in Table 4, γTTA was calculated for each A. γTTA for ZrO2–A–Zn–S ranges from 4.4 × 10−13 cm3 s−13 to 1 × 10−15 cm3 s−1 for 5 and 1, respectively. Despite 1 having the lowest γTTA, it has the lowest Ith value due to the four-fold larger τA3, whose exponent of 2 in eqn (6) makes it a more strongly impactful variable in dictating Ith than γTTA. For 5, the short lifetime is partially offset by the much larger γTTA, resulting in the second lowest Ith value of the series. If one were able to combine the γTTA of 5 while still retaining the long triplet excited state lifetime of 1, Ith values on the order of the solar flux (∼5 mW cm−2) would be feasible for TTA-UC emission from the bilayer film.

The values for γTTA in Table 4 are orders of magnitude smaller than for anthracene molecules in solution or crystals.41 This observation could imply one of two things, either diffusion (i.e. the rate of triplet migration across the surface) or the rate of TTA after the triplets have encountered is significantly slower in the bilayer film than in other media. If we assume, as with most other TTA-UC schemes,87–89 that the rate limiting process is triplet migration, then the triplet exciton diffusion constant (D) can be calculated using γTTA = (8πDa0)28,84 where a0 is the effective triplet–triplet interaction distance which in this case is assumed to be the intermolecular packing distance on the surface, dA–A. For ZrO2–A–Zn–S, D increases in the order 5 (2.0 × 10−7 cm2 s−1) > 4 (1.4 × 10−9 cm2 s−1) ≈ 3 (1.7 × 10−9 cm2 s−1) > 2 (3.1 × 10−9 cm2 s−1) > 1 (4.6 × 10−10 cm2 s−1) again with 5 and 1 being the upper and lower extremes of this parameter.
The lowest diffusion rate is observed with the diphenyl derivatives 1 and 2. Presumably the phenyl groups provide some form of hindrance or molecular rigidity that decreases electronic coupling between adjacent molecules. The order of magnitude difference between 1 and 2 may be a manifestation of how the molecules orient relative to the surface and to adjacent molecules. The origin of the two orders of magnitude higher D for 5 (2.0 × 10−7 cm2 s−1) is currently unclear to us. One could envision that lower steric hindrance or the forced relative orientation dictated by the methyl groups at the 2,6-position would favour face-to-face stacking of the acceptor molecules. Alternatively, the flexibility afforded by the methyl phosphonate group may allow for additional mobility of the tethered molecule such that it can sample a larger orientation space on the timescales of triplet diffusion. These observations again emphasize the importance of obtaining either experimental or theoretical insights into the molecular structure at the interface. Understanding and then controlling these structural parameters is critical to improving TTA-UC efficiencies in self-assembled systems.
As a somewhat unrelated side note, it was intriguing to us that there is a strong linear correlation (R-sq = 0.98) between the Ith values and ΦTTA for this series of molecules (Fig. S7, ESI†). To the best of our knowledge there is no intrinsic or causal reason for this correlation. The values are measured independently and ΦTTA is effectively the y-offset of the intensity dependence graph (i.e. the Ith curve). We attempted to determine if this was a general trend among TTA-UC systems but unfortunately a majority of the manuscripts that report ΦTTA do not also include the Ith values, or vice versa, under the same conditions. It is however worth mentioning that if this linear relationship holds true, then increasing ΦTTA to 0.01, for example, would result in an Ith value of 5 mW cm−2.
Given its strong impact on both Ith and ΦUC, these results indicate that dramatically increasing ΦTTA is a necessary step in increasing the efficiency of TTA-UC in bilayer films. One contribution to ΦTTA is the probability of obtaining a singlet excited state after annihilation of two triplet states, sometimes denoted as f.90 Pure spin statistics limit f to only 1/9 (ΦTTA(max) = 0.11).91 However this fraction can be increased if the quintet state is energetically inaccessible (ΦTTA = 0.25), and even further so if an upconverted triplet state can undergo reverse ISC into the singlet state. Experimental f values as high as 0.66 have been reported.92 Presumably, as is well known in singlet fission (SF), or roughly the reverse of TTA, molecular packing could have a profound influence on the rate and thus the efficiency of TTA. However, the role of relative molecular orientation, if any, in dictating f is currently unknown but newly developed self-assembled systems may provide a scaffolding to study this relationship.

4. Conclusion
Here we have reported the synthesis and photophysical characterization of phosphonated anthracene derivatives that act as the acceptor molecule in self-assembled bilayers for TTA-UC. The acceptor molecules are composed of an anthracene core functionalized with 9,10- or 2,6-phenyl, methyl, or directly bound phosphonic acid groups for metal ion coordination. In terms of ZrO2 surface binding, the molecules obey Langmuir isotherm behavior with a maximum surface loading giving a center-to-center packing distance on the order of 10 Å. Binding the molecules to the surface has minimal influence on the photophysical properties of the dyes relative to solution. Increased steric hindrance at the 9,10-positions, as opposed to the 2,6-positions, was found to increase the photostability of the dyes at the interface with the primary decomposition mechanism likely being a reaction with oxygen of the anthracene core.
The acceptor molecules were incorporated into self-assembled bilayer films with zinc as the linking ion and platinum porphyrin as the sensitizer. All five films facilitate green-to-blue photon upconversion with UC efficiencies as high as 0.0023 for 1. ΦTTA and not ΦTET, ΦFL, or Φout, was found to be the primary variable limiting the TTA-UC emission efficiency. Films containing compound 1 also exhibited the lowest Ith value despite having a lower second-order rate constant for TTA and diffusion constant. Regardless of having similar photophysical properties, variation in the position of the phosphonic acid on diphenylanthracene (1versus2) resulted in dramatically different ΦTTA, Ith values, γTTA, and D. Molecule 5, with a methylphosphoic group at the 2,6-position exhibited the highest triplet exciton diffusion rate and γTTA but they could not compensate for the short triplet lifetime and low fluorescence quantum yield and thus 5 exhibited the least efficient TTA-UC emission. Interestingly, we observed a strong linear correlation between ΦTTA and the Ith value but the cause of this relationship, if any, is unclear.
Collectively the results reported here point to three primary conclusions, (1) increasing ΦTTA is the key factor in lowering the Ith value and increasing ΦUC in bilayer films, (2) the structure of the molecule, and not simply the energetics, can be, but is not always, a critical factor influencing TTA-UC in the bilayer architecture, and (3) measuring and modelling the structure at these interfaces will be a necessary step in fully explaining and then controlling migration, triplet energy transfer, back energy transfer and ultimately the TTA-UC efficiency in self-assembled bilayer films.
