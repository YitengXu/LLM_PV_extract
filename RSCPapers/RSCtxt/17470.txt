    AbstractMicrometre-sized mesoporous materials have characteristic grains as well as pores nearly in the same scale. Electrodes of mesoporous materials for lithium batteries have short transport lengths for Li+ ions due to their nano-sized grains (10–20 nm), and easy access for electrolytes due to their nanopores (5–10 nm). Such mesoporous materials have high packing densities unlike nanopowders, nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes. Despite such advantages, electronic conduction over micrometre-sized particles limits the rate performance of mesporous materials. Occasionally counductive thin layers (2–5 nm) of carbon or RuO2 have been used to overcome such kinetic limitations and to achieve high storage performances. In this manuscript, we present a simple approach for the synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 anatase using a soft-template method, which shows superior storage performance without such conductive surface layers. Various cationic surfactants with different chain lengths have been selected for this investigation to assist the formation of the mesoporous TiO2 structure. Among these, cetyl trimethylammoniumbromide templated C16-TiO2 has the highest surface area of 135 m2 g−1 and reversible capacity of 288, 220, 138,134 and 107 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 1, 5, 10 and 30C respectively. The storage performance of the as-synthesized mesoporous TiO2 is nearly five times better than the commercially available TiO2 nanopowder. The packing density of meso-TiO2 is found to be 6.6 times higher than the TiO2 nanopowder. In addition, battery testing using mesoporous TiO2 electrodes without the 15% carbon additive exhibits nearly the same performance at low rate as the meso-TiO2 with carbon additives. These exciting results suggest a facile conduction path for electrons, a unique character of micrometre-sized mesoporous TiO2 with highly interconnected nanograins of 15–20 nm.

Broader context
Storage of clean and sustainable energy is the greatest challenge in today's energy-based society especially to power the enormously growing global energy demands of the electric automotive industry. Li-ion batteries have been proven to be one of the best technologies in the global market among the other rechargeable batteries for electric vehicle technology, but still requires the development of efficient cathode and anode materials. It is common practice to reduce the grain size or to make it nanostructured in order to make the diffusion path for both Li-ions and electrons as short as possible. Several groups have attempted to prepare nanostructured materials such as nanopowders, nanowires, nanotubes, nanorods etc., for this purpose. Though such nanostructured materials show high storage capacity and very good cyclic performance compared to bulk materials, the packing density is so low that the volumetric energy density, which is an important parameter of Li-ion batteries, is rather low. Nanostructured mesoporous TiO2 which we have synthesized using a soft-template method with various cationic surfactants shows not only superior lithium storage capacity, but also excellent rate performance and cyclic stability without any conductive surface coatings such as RuO2 or carbon. Most importantly, we demonstrate a high packing density at least 6 times higher than the corresponding TiO2 nanopowder. This novel mesoporous TiO2 would be a superior material for Li-ion batteries with high rate capabilities.

Introduction
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are the most successful electrochemical power sources, whose market has penetrated significantly in the past decade with emerging modern electronic devices. LIBs have also been recognized for electric vehicle applications due to their potential high energy density and high power density. Considerable attention has been paid recently to developing novel materials for both the cathodes and anodes of LIBs which are inexpensive, safe and environmentally benign. Nanomaterials have attracted great attention in this context due to their anomalous physical and chemical behaviour.1 Nanostructured materials such as nanopowders, nanowires, nanorods and nanotubes have shown promising advantages as electrode materials because of their high storage capacity and high rate performance.2a–c The main disadvantage of nanocrystalline electrode materials is their extremely low packing density. Poor volumetric storage capacity is an important issue that has to be addressed when considering them for lithium-ion battery applications. In this regard, mesoporous electrode materials offer a clever solution to achieve high volumetric energy densities for lithium-ion batteries. Mesoporous materials are usually micrometres in dimension with nanopores in the range 2–10 nm, thus when employed as electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries enable easy access for the Li ions from the electrolytes facilitating Li+ transport within the bulk grains which are typically in the range 10–20 nm. However, the electrons within the mesoporous particles need to be transported across a few microns to the nearest conductive carbon additive. For example, a recent report on mesoporous α-Fe2O3 by Jiao et al.2d clearly demonstrated a poor rate performance due to low electronic conductivity. Thus in mesoporous materials, it is often observed that longer transport lengths for the electrons limit their storage performance. To avoid such kinetic issues in mesoporous cathode or anode materials, electronically conductive carbon3e or RuO2 has been coated on the interior or exterior surfaces. Recently spacers such as Al2O3 or SiO2 have been introduced within mesoporous TiO2 to enhance its rate performance by improving the access to liquid electrolytes.3f
Though such electronic wiring or spacer techniques have been widely employed for achieving optimum storage performances, the authors feel that there is a need to investigate simple and inexpensive conditions for the synthesis of mesoporous electrode materials having enhanced storage behaviour at high rate, preferably without surface conductive or spacer materials. In this manuscript, we present a simple synthetic approach for preparing mesoporous materials of TiO2 with high packing densities using a soft-template method. The materials show superior storage performances at low as well as high rate operation without surface conductive or spacer media.
TiO2 exists in various polymorphs anatase, rutile and TiO2-B. Among these, anatase is considered to be the most desirable electroactive host for Li+ insertion.3 Storage in bulk rutile has not been successful and has only been achieved with insignificant amounts of Li (<0.1 mole of Li per formula unit) at ambient temperature.4 However, nano-rutile has shown a moderately higher performance than bulk rutile.5 The template-synthesized mesoporous electrode materials normally exhibit a large particle size but small crystallite size, high surface area, large surface-to-volume ratio, high crystallinity and favourable structural stability.6 These mesoporous electrode material characteristics are thus beneficial for their electrochemical storage behaviour because of a reduced transport length for Li+ ions, superior electrode–electrolyte contact area, and better accommodation of strain during Li intercalation. Improved electrode performances such as high capacity, high-rate capability, and longer cycling life are thus expected accordingly. Therefore, introducing a template technique in preparing electrode materials offers new opportunities to improve the performance of existing lithium-ion batteries.
With the aid of ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ templates, a variety of electrode materials with diverse structures and morphologies can be synthesized.7,8 This work highlights the synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 electrode materials with systematic control of pore size and specific surface area yielding a high packing density, through a soft-templating approach using various cationic surfactants. Three types of structure-directing cationic surfactants, namely cetyl trimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB), dodecyl trimethylammoniumbromide (DOTAB) and octyl trimethylammoniumbromide (OTAB) were selected for the current investigation due to their ability to assist the formation of mesoporous assembled structures. The electrochemical storage performances of the as-synthesized mesoporous titanium dioxide are reported in this manuscript. The results showed that the storage performances of mesoporous TiO2 depends on the chain length of the cationic surfactant. Specifically, the CTAB-templated mesoporous titanium oxide delivers high storage capacity and good rate capability. Thus this manuscript highlights the development of a very simple synthesis methodology that yields high quality mesoporous anatase which exhibits superior lithium storage with high packing density compared to those nanostructures produced from more complex synthetic procedures. The other salient features of this work are as follows: a) study of the mesoporosity on the electrochemistry of anatase, and b) demonstration of enhanced lithium storage capability without the presence of any additives or conductive coatings. The above key points are elaborated in the Results and Discussion section and also the structural and morphological merits of the template-directed materials are further addressed in comparison with the commercial TiO2 anatase nanoparticles.
Experimental section
All the solvents and chemicals were commercially available and were used as received unless otherwise stated.
Synthesis of mesoporous TiO2
The mesoporous TiO2 samples were synthesized using a soft-template method with titanium isopropoxide as a titanium source. Various cationic surfactant molecules like OTAB, DOTAB and CTAB were used as templates. OTAB, DOTAB, CTAB, titanium isopropoxide (TiOpr) and ethanol were of high pure grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. P25, a commercial titania powder from Degussa (received as a gift) with a grain size of 25 nm was used for comparison purposes. We present here the synthetic methodology for a representative case of CTAB-templated mesoporous TiO2. A definite weight (3.64 gm) of the cationic surfactant CTAB was taken in a round-bottomed flask and was dissolved in a mixture of de-ionized water and absolute ethanol in a volume ratio of 4:1. To this solution, 14.31 mL of TiOPr was added dropwise with continuous vigorous stirring. The resulting gel was then continuously stirred for several hours. The precipitate was then filtered, washed several times with ethanol and heated at 373 K for 1 h. Calcination was done in static air at 450 °C for 5 h to remove the organic template and to increase the cross-linking of the inorganic framework. A similar procedure was followed for the synthesis of DOTAB- and OTAB-templated mesoporous TiO2 in the same molar ratios.
Characterization of the as-synthesised mesoporous TiO2 materials
The crystallinity and purity of the as-synthesised mesoporous TiO2 were examined using powder X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD), which was recorded using a D5005 Bruker X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation. The accelerating voltage and current used were 40 kV and 40 mA respectively. A scan speed of 0.015° per second was employed. Lattice parameters were obtained using the TOPAS-R (version 2.1) software. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken with a JEOL JSM-6700F field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) operated at 5 kV and 10 mA. For SEM analysis, the samples were coated with a 100 nm thin platinum layer using DC sputtering. A JEOL JEM-2010 instrument was used to obtain high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images as well as selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns. These TEM images were used to investigate the morphology while the SAED confirmed the nature of crystallinity. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the as-synthesised mesoporous TiO2 were obtained using a N2 adsorption–desorption apparatus (Nova 1200, Quantachrome) at 77 K. Pre-treatments of the samples were carried out at 423 K for 8 h under high vacuum. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on as-synthesized and calcined titania powder using Labsys Evo, TGA-DSC-1600 (Setaram instruments) using alumina crucibles under an argon atmosphere at a rate of 10 °C min−1 from ambient temperature to 600 °C. Raman spectra were recorded using a micro Raman system JYT 64000.
Electrochemical storage behaviour
For electrochemical studies, composite electrodes were fabricated with the active material (meso-TiO2), super P carbon black and binder (Kynar 2801) in the weight ratio of 70:15:15 using N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent. A thick and uniform slurry of the above mixture was coated onto an etched copper foil using the doctor blade technique. The solvent was then evaporated by drying at 80 °C in an air oven for 12 h. The dried thick-film electrode was pressed between twin rollers to improve its packing density and ensure intimate contact of the active material and the current collector. Circular discs of 16 mm diameter were cut and subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 12 h and then transferred to an Ar-filled glove box which maintains <1 ppm of H2O and O2 (MBraun, Germany). Lithium metal foil, 1M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)–diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 volume ratio) and Celgard 2502 membrane were used as counter electrode, electrolyte and separator respectively to assemble coin-type 2016 cells. The geometrical area of the electrode was 2.0 cm2. The active material content in the electrode was around 3 mg. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling was performed on several duplicate cells after aging for 24 h at ambient temperature (25 °C) by computer controlled Arbin battery tester (BT2000, USA). Details of the cell fabrication have been described previously.9 Storage performances are presented at various current rates. Here 1 C is defined as 1 Li per formula unit of TiO2 in 1 h, which refers to a storage capacity of 335 mA g−1.
Results and discussion
The mesoporous TiO2 synthesized using the OTAB template was designated as C8-TiO2 and similarly the other mesoporous TiO2 materials synthesized from DOTAB and CTAB were designated as C12-TiO2 and C16-TiO2 respectively according to the chain length of the surfactant. Commercial P25 TiO2 from Degussa was used for comparison purpose and was labelled as com-TiO2. Fig. 1 shows the PXRD patterns of the as-synthesized mesoporous TiO2 samples using various cationic surfactants (OTAB, DOTAB and CTAB). The diffraction patterns clearly reveal the formation of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272) without any mixed phases like rutile and brookite. The calculated cell parameters for the anatase phase are in good agreement with earlier reports.10

In order to infer the morphology of the template synthesized meso-TiO2, sintered powders were analyzed using FESEM. Low-magnification FESEM imaging (Fig. 2a) shows an irregular sphere-like morphology of TiO2 particles with various sizes in the range 300–800 nm. Upon observation of these spheres under higher magnification, we note that these micron-sized particles are formed due to the agglomeration of TiO2 nano-grains of dimension 15–20 nm (Fig. 2b).

These TiO2 samples were further analysed using TEM after ultrasonication. Isolated nanograins of TiO2 in the range 15–20 nm were observed as a result of this ultrasonication treatment (Fig. 3a, d and g).

The HRTEM image recorded on the meso–TiO2 samples provide an added insight into the microstructures of these materials as shown in Fig. 3b, e and h. The clear lattice fringes observed indicate that the as-synthesized meso-TiO2 samples are highly crystalline in nature. The observed width of 3.495 ± 5 Å between neighboring lattice fringes corresponds to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. Figs. 3c, f and I show the SAED pattern of the meso-TiO2 sample, with diffraction rings (101), (004), (200) and (105) of randomly oriented anatase TiO2, consistent with the PXRD pattern in Fig. 1. PXRD, HRTEM and SAED results strongly suggest that the soft-template method used in this investigation to synthesise mesoporous TiO2 is an attractive process for the production of high quality mesoporous transition metal oxides especially in bulk quantities using a simple procedure, a key requirement for industrial applications.
The results of nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments indicate that the nanostructured titanium dioxide prepared by this soft-template method has a large specific surface area with a mesoporous structure. All samples exhibit a distinct large hysteresis loop from 0.6 to 0.8 of relative partial pressure (P/P0) and this type of behaviour is a typical characteristic of mesoporous materials, namely a type-IV isotherm due to capillary condensation in the mesoporous channels and/or cages. This sharp increase can be attributed to the capillary condensation, indicating a good homogeneity of the sample. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherms appears to be narrow (see inset of Fig. 4). The surface area, the total pore volume and the pore size of meso-TiO2 samples were calculated using the BJH method. It is noticeable that although all the mesoporous titania materials synthesized using various surfactants exhibit similar nitrogen sorption isotherms (Figs. S1 and S2 of the ESI†), the capillary condensation step (of the adsorption isotherm) shifts to higher partial pressure for materials prepared from longer chain surfactants and this shift implies an increase of pore size with increase in the chain length of the surfactant from OTAB to DOTAB to CTAB. The corresponding mean pore sizes are 5.7 nm, 6.1 nm and 7.0 nm respectively for the samples C8-TiO2, C12-TiO2 and C16-TiO2. The surface area of OTAB, DOTAB and CTAB, templated TiO2 was found to be 90, 109, and 135 m2 g−1 respectively. It can be noted that the surface area of meso-TiO2 is two to three times higher than that of P25 powder (50 m2 g−1). A relationship has been clearly observed between the surfactant and the surface area of mesoporous TiO2. As the surfactant chain length increases, the pore size and surface area increase. As a representative example, isotherm of CTAB-templated TiO2 is given in Fig. 4.

In order to measure the dependence of lithium storage behaviour of meso-TiO2 (Li intercalation) on the specific surface area, it is mandatory to keep both the crystallinity and the size the same.11 For this purpose, we have used the same temperature for calcination process to remove the surfactant, thereby retaining almost the same grain size in all cases, as confirmed from the TEM images (see Figs. 3a, d and g).
TGA and Raman spectroscopy were performed on meso-TiO2 to ascertain the absence of any residual carbon content. The mesoporous titania powder (calcined at 450 °C) when subjected to TGA study, undergoes negligible weight loss as shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI,† thus confirming that the calcination process that was employed during the synthesis has completely removed the organic agents and surfactants. To confirm this further, we performed Raman spectroscopy on meso-TiO2. Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive technique that can be used to analyse the presence of traces of carbon. Fig S4 of the ESI† shows the Raman spectrum of the sample C16 TiO2. As can be seen, there are no peaks observed for the carbon and this clearly reveals that the sample does not contain any residual carbon.
Electrochemical properties
It is known from the literature12 that Li insertion into anatase TiO2 is accompanied by the phase transition from tetragonal TiO2 (space group I41/amd) to orthorhombic Li0.5TiO2 (space group Imma). This phase transition happens along with a spontaneous phase segregation of lithium-poor Li0.01TiO2 phase into lithium-rich Li0.5TiO2. Such a process has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally.12Fig. 5 shows the discharge–charge curves of mesoporous C8-TiO2, C12-TiO2, C16-TiO2 and commercial TiO2 at 66 mA g−1 within the potential window 1.0–3.0 V. All the mesoporous TiO2 materials synthesized using the soft-template method show higher storage capacities and better stabilities when compared with the com-TiO2 sample. The Li insertion/extraction reaction in TiO2 can be written as, TiO2 + xLi+ + xe− ⇆ LixTiO2(1)where, x is the amount of inserted Li+ in anatase and it depends upon the crystallography and microstructure of the materials used.13

All the mesoporous TiO2 materials synthesized using various templates showed distinct potential plateaus at 1.73 and 1.90 V for Li insertion (discharging) and Li extraction (charging) processes respectively. A similar voltage profile has been reported previously for anatase in the literature.14 During the first discharge process, the voltage drops rapidly from the open-circuit voltage (OCV) to 1.73 V and reaches a plateau after which it gradually decreases to the cut-off voltage of 1.0 V. A negligible amount of Li is inserted into the mesoporous TiO2 before the plateau regime starts at 1.73 V and this is attributed to the formation of a solid solution. At 1.73 V, lithium insertion to about half of the vacant octahedral positions of anatase occurs and the corresponding insertion capacity during this plateau is found to be 116 mAh g−1 for meso C16-TiO2, 106 and 94 mAh g−1 for meso C12-TiO2 and meso C8-TiO2 respectively. A large amount of Li is inserted during the sloped region from 1.73 to 1.0 V and the corresponding capacities at these sloped regimes are found to be 184.5, 148 and 140 mAh g−1 for meso C16-TiO2, C12-TiO2 and C8-TiO2 respectively. The total storage capacity for meso C16-TiO2, C12-TiO2 and C8-TiO2 during the first discharge process is 343 (x = 1.02), 301(x = 0.90) and 276 mAh g−1 (x = 0.82) respectively. In the case of com-TiO2 the lithium storage capacity is 94.5 mAh g−1 corresponding to 0.28 mole of Li+.
The mesoporous TiO2 materials synthesized in the present study show far better storage performances than the com-TiO2. This observed larger capacity is attributed due to the fact that the templated materials are associated with a small grain size with high surface area. The subsequent charging (Li+ extraction) shows a monotonic increase in the capacity up to 1.90 V and this region is complementary to the Li insertion during the sloped region (1.73–1.00 V). However, it is important to note that the amount of Li+ extracted up to 1.9 V upon charging is found to be less than the inserted Li during the sloped region at the end of the discharging process. Extraction capacities up to 1.90 V were 87, 73 and 70 mAh g−1 for C16-TiO2, C12-TiO2 and C8-TiO2 respectively. At 1.90 V continuous extraction of Li occurred during the plateau, followed by a curved solid solution regime up to 3.00 V. The total extraction capacity was 272, 242 and 224 mAh g−1 for meso C16-TiO2, C12-TiO2 and C8-TiO2 respectively. Li extraction at the 1.90 V plateau is similar to the insertion plateau at 1.73 V. Long and flat charge–discharge voltage profiles of the mesoporous TiO2 observed at 1.73 and 1.90 V correspond to a characteristic bi-phasic electrochemical reaction.15,12b Upon subsequent Li insertion/extraction processes, the extraction plateau at 1.90 V did not alter, while the potential of the insertion plateau increased slightly from 1.73 to 1.77 V.
Above results suggest that the intercalation of Li into the interstitial octahedral sites of the anatase phase of all the meso-TiO2 samples reported here is highly reversible, whereas Li ions inserted in the irreversible sites of TiO2 at 1.56 V and the possible side-reactions with liquid electrolyte due to the large surface area of meso-TiO2 are not fully reversible and seem to cause a decrease in the Coulombic efficiency of the first cycle. However, in subsequent cycles, the short voltage plateau observed near 1.56 V for discharging vanished and also the conductivity of meso TiO2 was increased16 by the residual Li which results in the improvement of Coulombic efficiency in the subsequent cycles. After the 5th cycle the cyclic performance is quite reproducible, from the end of the 10th cycle onwards the Coulombic efficiency of C16-TiO2, C12-TiO2 and C8-TiO2 were recorded as 98, 98.2 and 97.7% respectively. The insertion capacity achieved at the end of 30th cycle was found to be 256.7, 230 and 217 mAh g−1 for meso C16-TiO2, C12-TiO2 and C8-TiO2 respectively. The discharge–charge capacities of the plateaus observed at 1.73 V and 1.90 V were extremely stable upon cycling. In all the meso-TiO2 samples investigated here, the capacity loss occurred mainly during the sloped region within the potential window 1.73–1.00 V.

Fig. 6 depicts the trend in the discharge–charge capacities versus cycle number at 0.2C (66 mA g−1) rate. All the meso-TiO2 samples show good reversibility with excellent performance upon successive cycling up to 30 cycles. Reversible capacities observed for the cycles from the 3rd until the 30th in the case of C16-TiO2, C12-TiO2 and C8-TiO2 lie in the ranges 268.0–256.7, 242.0–230.0 and 232.0–217.0 mAh g−1 respectively, whereas, it was only 71–62 mAh g−1 for the com-TiO2 sample.

These template-directed meso-TiO2 materials possess a favourable morphological stability which helps to alleviate any structural damage caused by the insertion and extraction processes during the cycling.

Fig. 7 shows the long-term galvanostatic cyclic performances of the meso C16-TiO2 sample at 2C and 5C rates. Under the 2C rate (670 mA g−1) 200 cycles were carried out. Reversible capacities of 195 mAh g−1 and 177 mAh g−1were observed at the end of 5th and 200th cycles respectively. At the 5C rate (1675 mAh g−1) reversible capacities of 135 mAh g−1 and 108 mAh g−1 were found at the end of 5th and 500th cycles. The observed capacity degradation was found to be just 0.05 mAh/g per cycle. In addition to this, the observed Coulombic efficiency was found to be more than 99% during these long-term cycles, Where as in the case of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous anatase TiO2 films, the macroporous architecture was found to be destroyed after continuous cycling, eventually changing into a dense film after insertion of lithium.17 Our soft-template mediated meso-TiO2 exhibits a stable morphology with improved cyclability even after 500 cycles at high rates. In the field of lithium-ion batteries, it is worth mentioning that robust structures with smaller transport pathways are often desired. Unlike TiO2 nanoparticles of 5–20 nm reported earlier, the meso-TiO2 exhibits not only smaller transport pathways for Li+ ions within the grains, but also less volume change and more importantly grains remain well connected without pulverization for many cycles. More importantly, open pores in the range 5.7–7.0 nm allow penetration of the liquid electrolyte throughout the volume of the particles, providing access for Li ions at the grains which are located at the centre of the particles. Such Li-ion availability is crucial for high rate performance.18

Upon increasing the C-rate, it is known that the polarization of the electrode material which is reflected in terms of potential difference between the discharge–charge plateaus increases. The electrolyte resistance also increases, thereby reducing the storage capability of the electrode.19Fig. 8 shows the voltage–capacity profile of all the meso-TiO2 samples at different current densities between 1.0–3.0 V. While increasing the rate, the plateau at 1.77 V becomes steeper and vanishes at 10C in all the meso-TiO2 samples, whereas the Li extraction plateau observed at 1.90 V is still present even at 10C but at a slightly higher potential (2.2–2.5 V). This observation indicates that Li insertion is more difficult compared to the extraction process and it is likely that the insertion reaction is the rate-limiting factor for the lithium storage behaviour of these meso-TiO2 materials.19

High rate performance is one of the significant electrochemical aspects of lithium-ion batteries for high-power applications such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and electric vehicles (EV).10,20 The insertion/extraction capacity of meso-TiO2 was studied at different C-rates as illustrated in Fig. 9. Excellent specific storage capacity is achieved for discharge–charge rates tested up to 10C. The reversible capacity is about 268, 220, 138, and 134 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 1, 5, and 10C respectively for C16-TiO2. Table 1 compares the reversible capacities at different C-rates for C16-TiO2, with those for C12-TiO2, C8-TiO2 and com-TiO2. On the best sample C16-TiO2, the rate performance was tested up to 30 C and the results are presented in Fig. 9 and Table 1. Even at a rate of 30C we observed a reversible storage capacity of 107 mAh g−1 which is comparable to that of RuO2-TiO220 and graphene-TiO2 composites.3e

 Fig. 9  Cycling performance of various meso-TiO2 materials: (a) C8-TiO2, (b) C12-TiO2, (c) C16-TiO2 and (d) com-TiO2 at various C-rates (rate capability). For C16-TiO2 the rate performance was tested up to 30C. 
The above results, suggest that when the chain length of the surfactant is increased from C8 to C16, an increase in the pore size and specific surface area is observed from 5.7 nm to 7.0 nm and 90 to 135 m2 g−1 respectively and this has a strong impact on the electrochemical storage behaviour of the meso-TiO2. In short, CTAB-templated mesoporous TiO2 showed the best storage performances at various current densities followed by C12-TiO2 (DOTAB) and C8-TiO2 (OTAB) templated mesoporous TiO2.
It is believed that a high surface area favours efficient contact between active materials and electrolytes thereby providing more active sites for the electrochemical reactions. The surface area of mesoporous C8-TiO2, C12-TiO2 and C16-TiO2 were found to be 90, 109 and 135 m2 g−1 respectively. Fig. 10 depicts the Li insertion capacities of all the meso-TiO2 samples versus their specific surface area at 0.2C. Only selected cycles are displayed (1st, 15th, and 30th cycles) in the figure for the sake of clarity. The observed trend in the Li-insertion capacities is as expected, that is a decrease in specific surface area resulted in a decrease in the lithium storage capacity.11 While comparing the meso C16-TiO2 with previous reports published on mesoporous TiO2, the C16-TiO2 sample synthesized using this soft-template methodology exhibits relatively higher specific surface area and excellent electrochemical performance at low current rates (0.2C) as well as at higher current rates (10 C).20,21 However, when compared with the performances of TiO2 with various other morphologies like nanotubes16,22 and nanorods,23 meso C16-TiO2 exhibits equal and in some cases slightly better electrochemical performance. Yet another point to be noted is that the synthesized mesoporous TiO2 used in the present investigation shows better performance at 10C when compared with the mesoporous TiO2,24a and RuO2-coated TiO2 materials reported in the past, where RuO2 was used to improve the rate performance.24b

It is worth analyzing the superior storage performance observed for the meso-TiO2 in the present investigation synthesized via a soft-template approach. As discussed in the introduction, enhanced storage capacity is observed in meso-TiO2 due to enhanced active electrochemical sites. A relatively high surface area of 135 m2 g−1 is achieved for C16-TiO2 synthesized in the present study when compared to those reported in literature for example, 130 m2 g−1 for meso-TiO2 synthesized using a Ti–Cd precursor24b and 90 m2 g−1 in the case of Brij56-templated meso-TiO2 synthesized by Kubiak et al.19 These three samples exhibit storage capacities of 268, 210 and 184 mAh g−1 at 0.2C respectively.
Though the crystallite sizes of meso C16 or C12 and C8-TiO2 reported here are in the range 15–20 nm and comparable to that of P25 nanopowders (25 nm), the electronic transport is expected to be significantly different in these two cases.
In P25 with loosely connected grains having free surfaces, the electrons are transported from grain-to-grain across well defined boundaries at their contact. It is highly improbable that each nanograin is connected to the current collector through additive carbon particles. On the other hand, micron-sized mesoporous TiO2 particles (2–3 μm) have nearly 100–150 grains (with grain size of 15–20 nm) across their diameter and about ∼1 million grains within them and these grains are well connected at their interfaces. It is believed that this unique connectivity between the nanograins in meso-TiO2 facilitates the electron transport almost like a channel within the TiO2 particles. Once the electrons reach the surfaces of the particles, they are contacted to the current collector via 15% conductive carbon. As the electronic conductivity within the mesoporous materials is the major rate-limiting factor2d and the fact that lithium ions are easily accessible due to a short transport length for Li+ and high surface area, we presume the facile electronic transport due to channel-like conduction pathways within mesoporous TiO2 particles is responsible for their superior storage performance.
In order to infer explicitly the influence of additive conducting carbon particles (15%) during the storage processes of meso-TiO2, we tested the battery performance without carbon additives. For this purpose, we used electrodes comprising 85% meso-TiO2 and 15% PVDF binder. Fig. 11 presents the storage performances of C16-TiO2 without carbon additive at the selected rates 0.2 and 1C. It is worth mentioning that the electrode made without conductive carbon exhibits equally good storage performance at 0.2C as that of the meso-TiO2 with carbon additive (see Fig. 5). However, the cyclic as well as the high rate performances of meso-TiO2 without carbon are relatively poor as seen from Figs. 5 and 10. In the case of P25-TiO2 electrodes fabricated without carbon additives, they shows very poor storage capacities and cyclic stabilities under similar conditions (see Fig. S5 of the ESI†).

Fig. 12a and b present the impedance spectra recorded on meso-TiO2 with and without carbon additive at various states of discharge. The impedance spectrum comprises an internal resistance of the battery at high frequencies, a depressed semicircle at the middle frequencies characteristics of the charge transfer process at interfaces or boundaries and a slope at low frequencies representing the diffusion process for the charge transport.

Detailed analysis of the impedance spectra will be published elsewhere. It is seen that the impedance spectra for meso-TiO2 electrodes with and without conductive carbon look quite similar except those at the open-circuit voltage prior to lithiation (note the impedance spectra for location ‘a’ in both samples), suggesting similar electronic conduction as well as transfer processes in both electrode materials irrespective of the additive conducting carbon. It is believed that the excellent storage performance in meso-TiO2 without conductive carbon is a consequence of the unique character of well sintered nanograins (at interfaces) of meso-TiO2 thus forming a facile electronic transport path with a long diffusion length as in 1D single crystalline nanorods.25 We assume that this enhanced diffusion length for electrons in meso-TiO2 is because of the formation of accumulation of electrons at the grain–grain contact or interface.26 Such accumulation of electrons at the interface would facilitate electronic conduction across the grains almost like in a 1D single crystalline nanorod. Analogous nanosize effects have already been demonstrated in multilayers of CaF2/BaF2 resulting in enhanced ionic conduction by several orders of magnitude.27 This explains why meso-TiO2 has a long diffusion path for electrons with no impedance at the grain boundaries compared to isolated P25 particles, favoring highly reversible capacity in the meso-TiO2. Further support for the enhanced diffusion path in meso-TiO2 is evident from the high solar energy conversion efficiency of 7.5% obtained in dye-sensitized solar cells using meso-TiO2 compared to P25 nanopowders which showed a conversion efficiency of 5% under the same conditions.28 Formation of a reduced layer of LixTiO2 at the surfaces of meso-TiO2 providing a continuous electronic conduction path along well-connected grains compared to loosely compacted P25 grains can not be excluded. Such conductive wiring could also explain the extraction of electrons at low rates across several grains (∼1 million) within a particle of 2–3 micron though there are no carbon additives. Further experiments are in progress to address the details of the conduction mechanism.
The poor rate performance of meso-TiO2 without carbon additives suggests that the transport of electrons at the contact of the meso-TiO2 particles is not significantly high enough to facilitate rapid lithium insertion or extraction. However carbon additives provide a conductive wiring for efficient charge collection at high rate operation in meso-TiO2.

Fig. 13 illustrates the volume occupied by the synthesized meso-TiO2 and the commercial TiO2 (P25) nanopowder. Though meso-TiO2 exhibits a high surface area, it is worth mentioning that they occupy less volume, resulting in a high packing density compared to the commercial nanopowder. The packing density of meso-TiO2 was found to be 0.714 g cm−3 whereas, for com-TiO2 it was 0.108 g cm−3 which is 6.6 times lower compared to meso-TiO2 (Fig. 13). Thus, we have shown here that the mesoporous TiO2 exhibits high storage capabilities as well as significantly high packing density hence having high volumetric storage capacity compared to TiO2 nanopowders. It may be noted that high volumetric storage capacity is highly relevant for lithium-ion battery technologies, since a smaller volume of electrode material could be used to achieve high energy densities, thereby reducing the volume of battery systems for various applications.

Conclusions
Micron-sized mesoporous titanium dioxide was prepared with a grain size of 15–20 nm through a soft-template approach using various cationic surfactants with different chain lengths. The as-synthesized meso-TiO2 materials were characterized using PXRD, SEM, HRTEM and SAED. Surface area analysis clearly shows the importance of surfactant chain length on the pore size and the specific surface area of meso-TiO2. CTAB-templated C16-TiO2 exhibits a high surface area of 135 m2 g−1 with better electrochemical performance than the other meso-TiO2 materials reported in literature. Nanopores in the meso-TiO2 favour the complete wetting of the TiO2 by the liquid electrolyte so that rapid Li+ insertion/extraction can be achieved. The superior storage behaviour observed in meso-TiO2 without any conductive surface coating synthesized by a soft-template method is attributed to the large surface area and enhanced electronic diffusion length due to nanosize effects. We present herein yet another example where a nanosize results in favourable conduction pathways across well-contacted grains of anatase within the meso-TiO2 particles, hence improving the charge collection during lithium storage at high rates. Meso-TiO2 thus exhibits excellent cyclic stability with reversible capacities close to the theoretical value at low rates and a remarkable high rate performance up to 30C. The volumetric storage capacity of meso-TiO2 is expected to be higher than that of commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles. Results reported here support meso-TiO2 as a promising anode material for high rate lithium-ion battery applications. The synthesis methodology used in this study is very simple and yields high quality mesoporous anatase in bulk quantities compared to more complex synthetic procedures, a key requirement for industrial applications.

Broader context
Storage of clean and sustainable energy is the greatest challenge in today's energy-based society especially to power the enormously growing global energy demands of the electric automotive industry. Li-ion batteries have been proven to be one of the best technologies in the global market among the other rechargeable batteries for electric vehicle technology, but still requires the development of efficient cathode and anode materials. It is common practice to reduce the grain size or to make it nanostructured in order to make the diffusion path for both Li-ions and electrons as short as possible. Several groups have attempted to prepare nanostructured materials such as nanopowders, nanowires, nanotubes, nanorods etc., for this purpose. Though such nanostructured materials show high storage capacity and very good cyclic performance compared to bulk materials, the packing density is so low that the volumetric energy density, which is an important parameter of Li-ion batteries, is rather low. Nanostructured mesoporous TiO2 which we have synthesized using a soft-template method with various cationic surfactants shows not only superior lithium storage capacity, but also excellent rate performance and cyclic stability without any conductive surface coatings such as RuO2 or carbon. Most importantly, we demonstrate a high packing density at least 6 times higher than the corresponding TiO2 nanopowder. This novel mesoporous TiO2 would be a superior material for Li-ion batteries with high rate capabilities.
