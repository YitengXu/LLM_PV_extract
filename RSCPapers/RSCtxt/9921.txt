    , Accepted 17th December 2021First published on 17th December 2021Abstract3D tin-based halide perovskites are promising light absorbers for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their non-toxicity, suitable optical band gaps, and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the inherent rapid crystallization and easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in 3D perovskites result in a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) and poor stability of tin perovskite solar cells compared with the lead counterparts. In this report, quasi-2D hybrid tin-based perovskite films are fabricated by using 2-thiopheneethylammonium (TEA+) as the spacer cation in MASnI3 (MA: CH3NH3+), leading to the formation of quasi-2D perovskite films with high orientation and a low content of Sn4+. As a result, the perovskite solar cells show a considerable power-conversion efficiency of 6.8%, which is among the highest values reported for MASnI3-based solar cells. Moreover, the devices exhibited excellent stability compared with the device without TEAI.
Introduction
Lead-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great advancement with power conversion efficiencies up to 25.5%.1–4 However, the heavy metal lead ions can be easily separated from the water-soluble perovskites, which is highly harmful to both the environment and humans and is considered as one of the drawbacks for their practical applications.5,6 As an alternative, some less toxic perovskite materials based on Sn, Bi, Cu, Ge, Sb, etc. have been developed for PSCs in the past ten years.7–12 Among them, Sn-based perovskites are expected to be the most promising alternatives to Pb-based perovskites due to their similar electron configuration and coordination geometry. Recently, tin-based perovskite solar cells have achieved an efficiency of up to 14.6%.13 In addition, Sn-based perovskites have optimal band gap (1.2–1.4 eV), higher charge-carrier mobility, and lower exciton binding energy, potentially having a higher PCE than the Pb-based counterparts. However, Sn-based perovskites are highly unstable towards moisture and oxygen, and the corresponding PSCs exhibit much lower PCEs with worse stability, as compared with lead-based PSCs. There are two key factors limiting their application: easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and fast crystallization of solution-coated tin perovskite films. Oxidation leads to serious p-doping of the perovskite film, deteriorating the optoelectronic properties, while fast crystallization results in poor film morphology with low coverage and poor crystallinity with high defect density.
To address these issues, many different strategies have been proposed to fabricate 3D Sn-perovskite films, such as solvent engineering,7 anti-solvent assisted treatment,14 composition control,15 and reducing additives.16–22 However, the resultant 3D perovskite devices are still unstable, especially when exposed to ambient conditions. Recent studies demonstrated that tin-based perovskite solar cells incorporated with quasi-2D layers showed higher stability with increased efficiencies. Quasi-2D perovskites can be represented by the general formula (RNH3)2An−1BnX3n+1, where RNH3+ = organic spacer; A+ = HC(NH2)2+, CH3NH3+, Cs+; B2+ = Sn2+; and X− = I−, Br−, or Cl−.22 The enhanced stability could be ascribed to hydrophobic organic spacers from 2D perovskites, which mitigate ion migration of the perovskite device, and prevent external moisture intrusion.24–26 In addition, the organic spacer cations could regulate crystal orientation, passivate defects, and protect Sn2+ from oxidation.23,27 Ning's group and Kanatzidis’ group first employed quasi-2D tin-perovskites.28,29 Kanatzidis’ group discussed BA2MAn−1SnnI3n+1 films as light absorbers in PSCs, and the n = 4 devices exhibited a PCE of 2.53% with high stability.28 Liu's group further investigated the effects of chain length on crystal orientation and phase distribution of quasi-2D Sn-based perovskite films by incorporating various aliphatic ammonium spacers.30 On the other hand, aromatic alkyl ammonium cations such as phenethylammonium (PEA) have been extensively investigated for the formation of quasi-2D perovskite films.31–33 Ning and co-workers were the first to incorporate PEA as the spacer in tin-based perovskites, resulting in the formation of quasi-2D tin perovskites.29 They discovered that, with the addition of 20% PEA in HC(NH2)2SnI3 precursor solution, the resultant quasi-2D structure grew perpendicular to the substrate, and the corresponding device gave a high PCE of 5.94% with good stability.
Thiophene-based materials have been generally used in organic electronic devices with promising properties, and are also successfully employed as spacers for the fabrication of quasi-2D lead-based perovskite solar cells.34 Lai et al. used 2-thiophenemethylammonium as a spacer cation to develop quasi-2D lead-based perovskites, and the resultant solar cells exhibited high photovoltaic performance with enhanced stability.35 Sutanto et al. deposited a 2D layer with various thiophene alkylammonium iodide cations to protect the degradation of the underlying 3D layer in ambient air.36 Thus, thiophene-based spacers could be expected to form low-dimensional tin halide perovskites, simultaneously enhancing the performance and stability of Sn-based perovskite devices, which has not been studied yet.
Herein, 2-thiopheneethylammonium iodide (TEAI) was first introduced as an additive into methyl ammonium tin iodide (MASnI3) perovskite precursor solution for the fabrication of tin-perovskite films. It was found that TEAI could induce highly oriented growth of quasi-2D tin-based perovskite films and suppress the oxidation of Sn4+. The resultant perovskite solar cells show a considerable power-conversion efficiency of 6.8% with enhanced air stability.
Experimental section
Materials
Tin(II) iodide (SnI2) (99.999%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) (>99.5%), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, 1–3% in water), [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and bathocuproine (BCP) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology in China. Hydroiodic acid (HI) (57 wt.% solution in H2O) was purchased from Aladdin. 2-Thiopheneethylamine (C6H9NS) was purchased from Beijing Innochem Science & Technology Co. Ltd. Tin(II) fluoride (SnF2) (99%), chlorobenzene, isopropyl alcohol, anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and anhydrous dimethylformamide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Indium tin oxide (ITO, TECA7 7 Ω sq−1) was purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co. Ltd.
Synthesis of TEAI
C6H9NS and HI were reacted in an ice bath at a molar ratio of 1:2. The white salt powder was collected and washed with diethyl ether for five times. The obtained powder was dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 40 °C.
Perovskite solution preparation
0.9 M MASnI3 perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 143 mg of MAI, 335 mg of SnI2 and 14 mg of SnF2 in 1 mL of DMSO solvent. For the 0.9 M perovskite solution with TEAI, the molar ratio of MAI:TEAI:SnI2:SnF2 = (1 − x):x:1:0.1, in which the values of x were 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4, corresponding to 5% TEAI, 10% TEAI, 20% TEAI and 40% TEAI, respectively. All the perovskite solutions were stirred at room temperature for 2 hours and filtered using a 0.22 μm PTFE filter before use.
Solar cell fabrication
ITO-coated glasses were cleaned by sequentially washing with detergent, deionized water, isopropyl alcohol, and acetone for 20 min, respectively. The substrates were dried using a N2 gun, following the treatment with UV–ozone (UVO) about 20 min before use. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was dispersed using an ultrasonic machine for 5 min and then filtered using a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. The solution was spin-coated onto the ITO glasses at 4000 rpm for 30 s in air, and then annealed on a hot-plate at 140 °C for 20 min. Then the substrates were subsequently transferred to a glovebox. The perovskite precursor was spin-coated on the substrate at 5000 rpm for 60 s. During this stage, 200 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the substrate at the 18th second, and then the substrates were annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 10 min. For the electron transport layer, 18 mg mL−1 PC61BM solution in chlorobenzene was spin-coated on the film at 1500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 10 min. After this, 0.5 mg of BCP was dissolved in isopropanol, followed by spin-coating onto the substrate at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed on a hotplate at 70 °C for 10 min. Finally, 100 nm Ag electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.01–0.03 nm s−1.
Characterization of films and devices
X-Ray diffraction pattern of the films was obtained using a X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, D/MAX RINT-2500) with Cu K radiation (= 1.54 Å) at a speed of 5° min−1. The grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement was conducted using a XEUSS WAXS/SAXS system from Xenocs, using X-rays at a wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The measurement used a Pilatus 300K detector, which was placed 132 mm from the samples, with a grazing incidence angle of 0.5°. The light absorption spectra were obtained using a UV-vis spectrometer (SHIMADZU, UV-1800 UV-vis spectrophotometer) with the wavelength ranging from 300 to 1000 nm. The SEM morphology figures were analyzed using a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at 5 kV. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using an Edinburgh FLS980 system with excitation at 486 nm.
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using an Avance III 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Current–voltage (J–V) curves were analyzed in a N2-filled glovebox. While the curves were measured by applying an external potential bias to the device, the generated photocurrent was recorded using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The J–V curves were collected at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under AM 1.5G solar light conditions. A metal shadow mask was used to confirm the active area of 4 mm2. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) pattern of the unenveloped device was collected in an air atmosphere at constant temperature and humidity, using a commercial setup (PV-25 DYE, JASCO). The light source for the generation of a monochromatic beam was a 300 W xenon lamp, and calibrations were standardized using a silicon solar cell.
Results and discussion
2-Thiopheneethylammonium iodide (TEAI) was synthesized by the reaction of 2-thiopheneethylamine and HI acid in ethanol. The synthetic detail is described in the Experimental section, and the 1H NMR spectrum of the TEAI is presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). SnI2, SnF2, MAI and different amounts of TEAI (MASnI3: TEAI = 0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 40%) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare various perovskite solutions. The perovskite films were prepared using a typical anti-solvent method through a one-step deposition process. Fig. 1a displays X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the resultant perovskite films with different contents of TEAI. The pristine MASnI3 perovskite film exhibits six main peaks at 2θ = 14.1°, 24.2°, 28.2°, 31.6°, 40.5°, and 43.2°, corresponding to the (100), (111), (200), (210), (220), and (300) reflections, respectively, which are assigned to the cubic perovskite phase of MASnI3.37,38

The enlarged XRD pattern ranging from 3°–15° is presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It is clear that the pristine MASnI3 film is composed of random nanocrystals. With the addition of TEAI from 0% to 20%, the (100) facet series are intensified significantly, and the (111), (210), and (220) facets are absent in the films, indicating that TEAI may induce the oriented growth of the quasi-2D perovskite (TEA)2MAn−1SnnI3n+1, films with high member (n > 4). When TEAI is increased to 40%, new diffraction peaks below 10° can be observed, indicative of a material with a larger unit cell, which can be ascribed to the low-member 2D structure (n < 4).32 This indicates that the perovskite film contains both low-member 2D structures and high-member 2D structures. It is noted that for perovskite films with 0 to 20% TEAI, no signal related to low-member 2D structure was detectable on the films, indicating that an appropriate amount of TEAI may favor the formation of high-member 2D perovskite films with high orientation, which is desirable to achieve performances close to those of their 3D counterparts.
Crystal growth orientation is essential in a perovskite layered structure to reduce defect states density and control effective charge transport in the devices. To further evaluate the crystal growth orientation of the perovskite films with the addition of TEAI, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was implemented. As presented in Fig. 1b, the Debye–Scherrer rings of the pristine sample consist of many isotropic randomly distributed spots, suggesting that the crystal orientations in the polycrystalline MASnI3 film are randomly distributed. In the film with 10% TEAI, we observed sharp and discrete Bragg spots closer to the central point in the qz direction, as shown in Fig. 1c. This indicates that the orientation growth of the 10% TEAI film perpendicular to the substrate is thermodynamically favourable with the (100) planes being parallel to the substrate surface, as schematically shown in Fig. 1d. GIWAXS patterns of various contents of TEAI are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). For the film with 40% TEAI, additional peaks between 3 and 14 degrees belong to quasi-2D perovskites (n = 1), which have the same XRD pattern as TH2MASn2I7 as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the corresponding perovskite films were obtained as shown in Fig. 2. The films with 0–20% TEAI exhibited almost the same absorption properties, and the band gap is estimated to be 1.27 eV. For the film with 40% TEAI, the absorption was decreased over the entire spectrum, followed by the appearance of an absorption band at 670 nm for lower-member 2D perovskite films,29,39 which is consistent with results from the above XRD and GIWAXS patterns.

The surface morphology of the absorber films with different contents of TEAI was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 (ESI†). All the films are compact with full coverage. The pristine film shows distinct grains, and the grains slightly increased with the addition of TEAI, consistent with the enhancement of the peak intensity in the XRD patterns. For the film with 10% TEAI, it was found that the grains turn fused, which could reduce carrier recombination and improve charge transport of the device for high-efficiency PSCs.40 With the addition of 40% TEAI, the grains appear to be platelike due to the formation of lower-member 2D perovskites, which is consistent with the previous reports on 2D tin and lead perovskites.39,41 After the demonstration of high-quality 2D layered perovskite films with the TEAI contents ranging from 0 to 20%, the corresponding PSCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, and the cross-sectional SEM image of a complete device is shown in Fig. 4a. Their photocurrent density versus voltage (J–V) curves were measured to evaluate the photovoltaic metrics of the devices. The photovoltaic parameters of all PSCs are listed in Table 1. As we can see, the PSC without TEAI exhibited a low open circuit voltage (Voc) with an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.5%. The poor device performance can be ascribed to the poor crystallinity of the perovskite film and carrier recombination from high concentration of Sn4+ due to the oxidation of Sn2+ in the film.42,43 In Table 1, it can be seen that device performance is significantly improved with the addition of TEAI. The device with 10% TEAI showed the best performance, with an average PCE of 6.1%. Fig. 4b shows the J–V curves of the device with 10% TEAI, measured under forward and reverse scans, where hysteresis is negligible. The 10% TEAI device exhibits a PCE of 6.8% along with a Voc of 0.53 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.8 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 65.1%. The PCE is among the best efficiencies for MASnI3-based solar cells.44,45 With further increase of TEAI, the PCE decreased, probably due to high resistance of the perovskite film from the excess TEAI incorporated. Fig. 4c shows the IPCE spectrum for the 10% TEAI device, which is similar to the J–V curve.

To evaluate the stabilized power output of the devices, the 10% TEAI device was measured at a maximum power voltage of 0.41 V for 200 s under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, exhibiting a steady-state PCE and a current density of 6.6% and 16.10 mA cm−2, respectively, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The PCE histogram in Fig. 4d presents an average PCE of 6.1% for 25 parallel samples. In addition, the role of TEAI on the stability was examined by the UV-vis absorption and XRD spectra of the perovskite films without and with 10% TEAI, as shown in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†). Thus, the TEAI incorporation can enhance the efficiency and also significantly improve the stability of the PSCs.
To further clarify the reasons for the enhanced efficiency and stability of the device with the incorporation of TEAI as discussed above, the Sn 3d states were analyzed and compared using X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) for the MASnI3 films without and with 10% TEAI. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the Sn 3d XPS spectra of the samples could be divided into two components associated with Sn2+and Sn4+ species, where the amounts of Sn4+ are calculated to be 12.1% and 2.6% for the films without and with 10% TEAI, respectively. Clearly, the quasi-2D tin perovskite with 10% TEAI could dramatically suppress the oxidation of Sn2+, which can reduce the background carrier density in the Sn-based perovskite film and improve the efficiency and stability of the corresponding device.19,20 To investigate the charge dynamics of the films, time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was measured, as shown in Fig. 5c. The time-resolved PL plots show that the 10% TEAI film presents a longer carrier lifetime of 5.15 ns, compared with the pristine film carrier lifetime of 0.77 ns, indicating decreased defect density and alleviated non-radiative recombination within the tin perovskite film;6,40,44 the corresponding TRPL characteristic values are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Fig. 5d presents the steady-state PL spectroscopy of the control film and the 10% TEAI film. The PL intensity of the 10% TEAI film has been greatly enhanced by 70% as compared with that of the pristine film. In addition, the emission peak was slightly blue-shifted by 10 nm with the incorporation of TEAI, which may imply fewer defect states in the film.46

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that TEAI can be successfully embedded into the MASnI3 based 3D perovskite and induce the crystalline growth and orientation of the quasi-2D perovskite films. TEAI could effectively suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and reduce the concentration of Sn4+ species in the resulting films. With the 10% TEAI perovskite layer as the light absorber, the solar cell exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.8% with significantly enhanced stability. This work provides a new and effective strategy for the fabrication of high-efficiency Sn perovskite solar cells. We anticipate that the performance of Sn-based perovskite solar cells would be improved with further optimization of the perovskite composition, charge transport materials, structural design, and interface engineering.
