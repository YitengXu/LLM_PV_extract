    , Accepted 21st October 2022First published on 21st October 2022AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have become promising candidates for future photovoltaics (PV) with significant advancements in their performance over recent years. Along with PV, HOIPs possess applications in photodiodes, photodetectors, photocatalysis, and memory devices. Generally, perovskites are structurally flexible to accommodate various cations on their respective sites through compositional engineering, thereby altering the characteristic material properties of the system. HOIPs have ABX3 structures, in which organic or inorganic moieties occupy the monovalent ‘A’ site. In this work, the effect of formamidinium (FA) on the optical and morphological properties of HOIPs using two different bromide perovskites – FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 and MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 – is examined. After ‘FA’ modification, we noticed a reduction in the bandgap and an increase in the grain size of the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite compared with the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite. As a result, a better photocurrent response during photoelectrochemical analysis and an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) for photovoltaic devices were detected with the FA-modified HOIP (FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3).
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP) materials have actively been researched due to their significant advancement in photovoltaic (PV) performance for several years. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cell devices has grown from 3.13%1 to 25.2%.2 Along with PV, HOIPs also find applications in photodetectors,3 light-emitting diodes,4 photocatalysis,5 and memory devices.6 This is are attributed to their characteristic material properties such as high absorption coefficients,7 tunable bandgaps,8 and considerable carrier diffusion lengths.9 Also, HOIP thin films can be obtained through easy and low-cost fabrication methods.10 The optimization of perovskite material performance for various applications is primarily obtained through compositional engineering.11 Generally, HOIPs have three-dimensional (3D) structures represented as ABX3, where the ‘A’ site is occupied by a combination of monovalent organic moieties such as FA (formamidium; HC(NH2)2+) and MA [(methylammonium; CH3NH3+)], and inorganic cations such as Cs+ (cesium), Rb+ (rubidium) and K+ (potassium). Further, the B-site is occupied by metals such as Pb2+ (lead) or Sn2+ (tin), and the X-site is occupied by halide species such as I− (iodide), Br− (bromide), and Cl− (chloride) or pseudohalides such as SCN− (thiocyanate). The monovalent A-site significantly influences the optical properties and stability of HOIPs.12 The latest developments in mixed ‘A’ site perovskite materials research include ‘A’ site cation engineering for the development of blue emissive light emitting diodes,13 influence of Cs on the dynamics of mixed cation wide bandgap bromide-based perovskites,14 hydrogen bonding effect on the electronic properties of mixed FA–MA lead iodide-based perovskites15 and so on.
This work reports the effect of FA on a mixed cation lead bromide perovskite. Earlier reports on a pure FA-based lead halide perovskites (FAPbI3) indicated that it has a suitable direct bandgap, superior thermal stability, extended charge diffusion,16 and longer lifetime over MA and Cs+ monocations.17 But on the other hand, FA exhibits phase instability between the 3D perovskite black α-phase and the non-perovskite yellow δ-phase.18,19 Furthermore, among these two phases, the probability of FA stabilizing in the non-perovskite yellow δ-phase is high because of its large size (253 pm).19 But the partial substitution of monovalent MA or Cs+ along with FA inhibits its phase transformation towards the non-perovskite yellow δ-phase.18 After considering the above-mentioned observations, we explored the impact of FA on the optical and morphological properties using two different lead bromide HOIPs: FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 and MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to obtain information regarding the valence band (VB) maximum energy level of HOIPs. Earlier, Cardenas-Morcoso et al. reported that the electrochemical bandgap measured with the CV analysis is in good agreement with the optical bandgap obtained through PL for some perovskite quantum dots (QD) such as CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3, CsPbI3, CsPb(I0.5Br0.5)3, and CsPbBr3.20 Also, Samu et al. reported the challenges in determining the bandgap by the electrochemical method for CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3 perovskites.21 Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed to obtain information regarding perovskite–electrolyte interface activities, which can be correlated to the perovskite morphology. Earlier, Srivastava et al. reported the effect of the MAPbI3 perovskite fabricated with different morphologies on the diffusion of charge carriers across the perovskite–electrolyte interface via EIS analysis.22
From this work, it was observed that the VB maximum of FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 is lower than that of MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3. We attributed this energy level variation to the lattice expansion in the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite. Further, the EIS analysis shows a lower charge transfer resistance across the perovskite–electrolyte interface (Rct) for the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite over the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite because of its relatively large grains with a smaller grain boundary density.

Diethyl ether, anhydrous ((C2H5)2O) and ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.9%) were procured from Finer and Changshu Hongsheng Fine Chemicals, respectively. All chemicals and reagents were used without further purification. The thin-film fabrication of HOIPs was carried out over non-conductive plain glass slides for XRD, PL, and TRPL experiments, and the rest of the experiments were carried out using thin films fabricated over fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass slides.
Materials characterization
The HOIP thin films were prepared by utilizing an EZspin-A1 Apex spin coater on glass and FTO substrates. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα’ (1.54 Å) radiation at 40 mA current and 40 kV potential in the diffraction angle (2θ) range of 10–50°. Further, the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy analysis was performed using a Fluorolog FL3-211 HORIBA Scientific with a 450 watt xenon arc lamp. The UV-visible spectroscopy analysis was performed using a Shimadzu UV-2600 in the wavelength range from 450 nm to 600 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis was performed using HORIBA Scientific DeltaFlexTM and DeltaProTM Fluorescence Lifetime Systems using 453 nm excitation pulses and the software used was EzTime. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (cross-section and surface morphology) were captured using Zeiss Gemini SEM500 instruments. The HOIP thin film samples were sputtered with gold for 2 minutes before SEM analysis to make the surface conductive.
For photoelectrochemistry-related experiments and analyses in our studies, a Metrohm Dropsens μStat-i 400s electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode setup and DropView 8400 software were used. The HOIP thin film was illuminated using a calibrated solar simulator (model: ScienceTech) with a light intensity equivalent to one sun (1.5 AM) to perform the photoelectrochemical experiment.
The current density–voltage (J–V) measurement was carried out (photocurrent and dark current) with a 2400 series source meter (Keithley). The source light with an intensity equivalent to one sun (1.5 AM) was used for the J–V measurement provided by a Class AAA SS-F5-3A steady-state solar simulator (Enlitech). The EQE (external quantum efficiency) analysis was carried out using a quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech) at zero bias voltage. The measurement was calibrated using a standard silicon photovoltaic cell with incident monochromatic light.
Methods

Materials synthesis. 
Methylammonium bromide (MABr) was synthesized by adding an equimolar concentration of CH3NH2 to HBr in ethanol solution for 2 hours in an ice bath to prevent the vaporization of CH3NH2. A few drops of H3PO2 were added during the reaction to inhibit unnecessary side reactions. After completion of the chemical reaction, a white salt of MABr was obtained. The remaining solvent was evaporated, and the desired product was washed in (C2H5)2O, filtered, and dried for further use.


Fabrication of compact TiO2 (c-TiO2). 
The synthesis of c-TiO2 was carried out by a method reported earlier with minor modifications.23 An equimolar mixture of titanium isopropoxide and diethanolamine dissolved in ethanol was used as the precursor solution. The precursor solution was spin-coated over the substrate at 7000 rpm (with three equal ramp steps), followed by annealing at 500 °C. The thin film of c-TiO2 fabricated over the FTO substrate acts as the electron transport material (ETM).


Fabrication of mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2). 
Initially, 1.2 g of TiO2, 0.2 ml of CH3COOH, and 1 ml of H2O were mixed by slowly adding ethanol (up to 26 ml) in a mortar and pestle. On the other hand, 12.5 g of α-terpineol, 1.25 g of ethyl cellulose 46, and 1.25 g of ethyl cellulose 10 were well dissolved in 25 ml C2H5OH. 8 g of the freshly prepared solution was then added to the initial mixture in the mortar and pestle and sonicated for 30 minutes. After that, C2H5OH was evaporated using a rotary evaporator, and the remaining mixture turned into a white paste. This white paste was kept as the stock, and for the fabrication of the thin film, the m-TiO2 paste was diluted with ethanol in a mass ratio of 1:7 and spin-coated for 30 seconds at 2000 rpm. After that, the m-TiO2 film was annealed at 500 °C for 2 hours.24


Fabrication of the perovskite film. 
Initially, 1.1 M concentrated precursor solutions of MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 and FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites were prepared from the corresponding salts (FABr, MABr, CsBr and PbBr2). The precursor salts were weighed as per the stoichiometry of the corresponding HOIPs and dissolved in the solvent mixture of DMF:DMSO in a ratio of 7:3. Later, HOIP thin films were fabricated over the preheated (80 °C for 5 minutes) substrate (m-TiO2 film coated FTO or glass slide) by spin coating of the precursor solution at 4500 rpm for 25 seconds. During the spin-coating process, the anti-solvent toluene was added at the 7th second. The substrates were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min after the completion of the spin-coating process in a controlled environment.


Fabrication of the hole transport material (HTM). 
PTAA was used as the hole transport material (HTM) in this work. Initially, 15 mg of PTAA was dissolved in 1 ml of chlorobenzene. Further, 6 μl 4-tert-butyl pyridine diluted with acetonitrile in a ratio of 1:1 and 7.5 μl lithium salt in acetonitrile (108 mg/200 μl) were dissolved in PTAA solution as dopants. Next, the final solution was spin-coated over the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 40 seconds and thermally annealed at 80 °C for 5 minutes.


Fabrication of perovskite solar cell devices. 
The perovskite solar cells were fabricated via n–i–p geometry with MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 and FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites as the active PV materials and also c-TiO2 as the ETM as well as PTAA as the HTM. Initially, a thin layer of c-TiO2 was spin-coated over the FTO substrate. Next, the mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer was fabricated over c-TiO2. Then the perovskite active layer and PTAA layer were spin-coated consecutively. The spin-coated films were stored for 12 hours in a limited oxygen atmosphere before the thermal evaporation of gold contacts. Finally, the thermal evaporation process was carried out at a deposition rate of 0.04 Å s−1 up to ∼50 nm thickness.


(Photo)electrochemical (PEC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of perovskite films. 
All the electrochemical experiments were conducted using a three-electrode setup. The analyte FTO/APbBr3 (A = MA, FA, Cs) was used as the working electrode. Ag/AgCl and Pt-wire were the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. Also, 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) salt was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) solvent, which was the supporting electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and chronoamperometry studies were performed with the electrodes as mentioned configurations.

Results and discussion
The basic structural framework of the HOIPs is attributed to PbBr64− octahedral units, forming a cubic structure where Pb2+ occupies the corners and Br− occupies the edge centers. The ‘A’ site monocations (either FA or MA or Cs) occupy the void spaces formed at the center of the cuboctahedral structure created among eight PbBr64− octahedral units, as shown in Fig. 1a. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of HOIPs (deposited over a glass substrate) was performed to understand the phase purity of the crystal structure. The XRD patterns of the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite form diffraction peaks at 15.06°, 21.30°, 26.16°, 30.25°, 33.90°, 37.27°, 43.15°, and 45.93° which correspond to (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), (211), (220), and (300) crystal planes, respectively (Fig. 1b). The XRD peaks obtained in this study match with the similar composition of bromide perovskites reported in the literature.25 The material crystallizes in a 3D perovskite lattice, which belongs to the Pnma space group.26 Further, the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite also shows a similar diffraction pattern, but the incorporation of FA in the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite causes a slight peak shift towards the left (∼0.06°) (Fig. 1c and d). The shift of the peaks towards a lower angle is due to the higher interplanar spacing in the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite caused by the partial substitution of relatively large FA (ionic radius: 253 pm) over MA (ionic radius: 215 pm).

The octahedral factor (μ)27 and Goldschmidt's tolerance factor (t)28 of both HOIPs were calculated. The ‘μ’ value of both perovskites is 0.607. Also, the ‘t’ value of the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite is 0.961, and that of the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite is 0.92 (see Section S1, ESI†). The obtained values of the octahedral factor and tolerance factor indicate that both HOIPs have a cubic structure. The optical properties of HOIPs were examined using UV-visible spectroscopy analysis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The Tauc plot was utilized to determine the optical bandgap from the transmittance data (Fig. 2a). The bandgap obtained for the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite was 2.26 eV, and that for the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite was 2.29 eV, as shown in Fig. 2b and c. In addition, the PL emission analysis depicts peak positions at 542 nm for the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite and 547 nm for the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite, as shown in Fig. 2d. The observed shift in PL peaks agrees with the bandgap obtained from Tauc plots. The average lifetime (τ) of both perovskites was obtained through TRPL analysis, as shown in Fig. S4 (see the ESI†). The average lifetime of the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite is higher by 31% in comparison with the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite. Also, the SEM images of both HOIPs spin-coated over FTO were captured to understand the surface morphology and cross-section width. Both HOIPs demonstrate fully covered, pinhole-free, smooth, repeatable SEM images (Fig. 2e and f). The larger grain size was observed for FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 (∼662 nm) compared to MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 (∼304 nm), though the thickness of both HOIPs was within the range of 450 ± 50, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2e and f. Also, the EDAX analysis of both perovskites shows similar atomic percentages (%) for Cs, Pb, and Br as shown in Table S1 (see the ESI†).

Surface morphology of (e) FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 and (f) MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 coated over the FTO substrate (cross-sectional views of the HOIPs are shown in the inset). 
Further, to determine the VB maximum of both HOIPs, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis was performed in the dark within an electrochemical window of −0.8 V to 1.5 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. We selectively choose the electrochemical window from our controlled measurements. The HOIP films do not degrade within the above-mentioned potential window but start degrading on applying potential beyond the electrochemical stability window (Fig. S1, ESI†). The electrochemical system was calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) internal redox reference standard, and a formal potential of 0.41 V was obtained (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The information regarding the calibration of the electrochemical system is given in Section S2, ESI.† Further, CV analyses were performed on both HOIP films in the same electrochemical setup. For FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 and MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites, the oxidation peaks are obtained at 1.29 V and 1.21 V, respectively (Fig. S2b and c, ESI†). Meanwhile, a few minute peaks appeared on the reduction side, which might be due to (1) the irreversibility of the HOIPs after any particular oxidation or reduction processes29 and (2) some unintended side reactions of the HOIPs with moisture or impurity in the solvent or electrolyte.30 Hence, the reduction peaks are discarded, and the energy bands are determined only by accounting for the oxidation potentials of both HOIPs. The VB maximum of both HOIPs was calculated from the formal and oxidation potentials observed (see Section S2, ESI†). Thus, the calculated VB maximum of the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite is at −5.68 eV, and that of the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite is −5.60 eV. Further, the CB minimum was obtained by adding the VB maximum obtained from CV and the bandgap obtained from the Tauc plot. The calculated CB minimum was at −3.42 eV for the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite and −3.31 eV for the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite. Fig. 3 represents the complete energy band diagram for both HOIPs. The energy bands of HOIPs are contributed by the ‘antibonding orbital’ formed by the overlap of the Pb′6s′ and Br′4p′ atomic orbitals (VB maximum) and non-bonding Pb′6p′ orbital.31 It was noted that the VB maximum of the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite is 80 meV lower than that of the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite (Fig. 3). This variation can be attributed to the distortion in the overlap of the Pb′6s′ and Br′4p′ atomic orbitals in the lattice. The presence of the relatively large FA in the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite can expand the lattice of the 3D perovskite (as observed in XRD; Fig. 1b) and eventually disturb the overlap of the Pb–Br orbital.
 Fig. 3  Energy band diagram of both FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 and MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites (where VB indicates the valence band and CB indicates the conduction band). 
Along with the abovementioned variations in optical properties, there are also variations in morphological properties between the two HOIPs. The SEM images showing the surface morphology of both perovskites indicate that the average grain size of the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite (∼662 nm) is more significant than that of the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite (∼304 nm), as shown in Fig. 2e and f. Large grain perovskites show better charge transport, device performance,32 and stability.33 The large grain size of the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite is most likely due to its low nucleation rate compared to the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite. Among the two HOIPs, the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite is more heterogeneous, and this enhances the Gibb's free energy of nucleation over the substrate.34 Therefore, the number of nucleation sites generated over the substrate decreases, and eventually the nuclei grow into larger grains in the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite. On the other hand, for the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite, more nuclei are developed over the substrate, and as a result, relatively small grains are formed. Some observations regarding the impact of grain size difference on perovskite electrical properties are obtained from EIS analysis.
We conducted EIS experiments on HOIP films over the AC frequency range from 105 Hz to 0.1 Hz at a constant amplitude of 10 mV. EIS data were interpreted based on a fitting circuit model equivalent to the Nyquist plot obtained, as shown in Fig. 4a. The series resistance in the circuit model is equivalent to the hindrance of charge flow due to electrolyte solution, FTO substrates, and electrode contacts. Next, the RC component (resistant and capacitor in parallel) is equivalent to charge transfer resistance (Rct) and double-layer capacitance (Cdt), which is observed at the ‘perovskite–electrolyte’ interface. The information from the RC component in the equivalent circuit reflects the electrical properties of the perovskite grains. Finally, the ‘W’ component represents the Warburg impedance which denotes the diffusion of ions at the perovskite–electrolyte interface.35

EIS analysis of both HOIPs was conducted under open circuit potential (OCP) conditions to prevent the formation of the space charge layer at the interface. A similar trend was observed in these analyses, in which the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite shows a lower Rct than the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite (Table 1) at two different thicknesses (450 ± 50 nm and 300 ± 50 nm). As the grain size of the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite is much larger than that of the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite, the density of grain boundaries in the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite is lower compared to the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite. As a result, the charge carriers in the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite flow without many barriers.36 On the other hand, in the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite, the flow of charge carriers is more restricted and the possibility of accumulation of charge carriers in the perovskite material is more, resulting in a higher Rct.

The response of the HOIP toward light was analyzed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry methods. For this analysis, a solar simulator with the light intensity equivalent to one sun was used as the light source. LSV was measured within the range of 0 V to 0.8 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Electron–hole pairs are generated on the radiation of light towards HOIPs, and electrons travel through the external circuit. Complementary to this electron flow via the external circuit, there is the movement of ions through the DCM solvent internally. The supporting electrolyte TBAPF6 present in DCM splits into [PF6]− and [Bu4N]+ ions and helps maintain the electrical neutrality of the system by providing conductivity in the solution through ion migration. TBAPF6 stays chemically inert37 within the potential range (−0.8 V to 1.5 V) used in this work. From LSV analysis, it is observed that FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites show a relatively high current response in comparison with MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites, as shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  LSV response of FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 and MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 in both light and the dark. 
Furthermore, the chronoamperometric response of both HOIPs in light was analyzed at two different potentials (0 V and 0.3 V), as shown in Fig. 6. The direction of the current response obtained is in agreement with the LSV measurements. Both the HOIP materials degrade after prolonged exposure to light at 0.3 V.

Perovskite solar cell devices were fabricated using TiO2 and PTAA as the electron transport material (ETM) and the hole transport material (HTM), respectively, in a conventional n–i–p configuration. Several research groups reported solar cell devices in similar configurations for both iodide-based38,39 and bromide-based perovskites.40,41 The current density vs. voltage curves (in the dark and under illumination) for both devices, along with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) plot and the SEM image of the device cross-section, are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The state-of-the-art device data of both HOIPs, such as short circuit current (JSC), open circuit potential (Voc), fill-factor, and efficiency values, are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Among the HOIPs, the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite demonstrated an improvement in PCE by 18.72% and in JSC (short circuit current) by 15.76% (the perovskite solar cell devices fabricated in this work are unoptimized). The larger grain size makes FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites better PV materials than MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites. Also, the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites show a higher EQE compared to MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites. Further, a blueshift in the EQE response is observed for the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite due to its higher bandgap compared to FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskites.
Conclusions
In this work, the effect of FA on perovskite properties was examined in mixed A-site lead bromide perovskites – MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 and FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3. We observed that the presence of FA in the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite impacted both energy bands (VB maximum and CB minimum) and its bandgap is reduced by 30 meV in comparison with the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite. The FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite forms larger grains compared with the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite due to its reduced nucleation rate. As a result, the electron movement is more facile in the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite, and correspondingly in the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite, the relatively small grains hinder electrons from flowing across the boundaries. This effect is reflected in the EIS results, in which the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite shows more charge transfer resistance (Rct) in comparison with the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite. Furthermore, the FA0.5MA0.4Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite demonstrates a higher photocurrent response and better PCE over the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 perovskite. Overall, the presence of FA makes HOIPs better candidates for various light-driven applications, including photovoltaics.
