    , Accepted 1st June 2017First published on 1st June 2017AbstractDespite the superior photovoltaic efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the relatively low long-term stability of the perovskite layer against ambient moisture is a tremendous obstacle for the practical applications of PSCs. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) suffers from the limitations of high acidity and low work function. Herein, for the first time, dopamine was doped to modify PEDOT:PSS to develop a new hole extract material (HEM), DA-PEDOT:PSS; moreover, since dopamine is basic in nature, it reduced the acidity of PEDOT:PSS, thereby improving the device stability of planar heterojunction PSCs. The new HEM exhibited extremely low acidity and showed highly enhanced device durability. Moreover, when compared with that of PEDOT:PSS, the work function of DA-PEDOT:PSS was higher and made the DA-PEDOT:PSS-based PSC achieve a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.4% due to the obvious enhancement of Voc, and DA-PEDOT:PSS showed significantly enhanced long-term device stability as compared to PEDOT:PSS under unencapsulated condition. Intriguingly, after 28 days of aging, the PCE and Jsc of DA-PEDOT:PSS still remained 85.4% and 89.2%, respectively, as compared to those of PEDOT:PSS (PCE of 60.4% and Jsc of 59.3%). Dopamine-copolymerized PEDOT:PSS showed great advantage over PEDOT:PSS for the enhancement of device durability.
Introduction
To solve serious energy and environmental problems, it is necessary to develop new, high-efficiency, and low-cost solar cells. Recently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their advantages of high power conversion efficiency (PCE), low-cost, simple-processing, and high-flexibility. The initial PCE of PSCs was 3.8%, as reported by Miyasaka in 2009.1 To date, a PCE higher than 20% has been reported.2 Significant efforts, including enhancement of the crystallinity of the perovskite material,3–6 synthesis of new perovskite materials,3,7–10 micro-morphology control of the perovskite material,1–13 and modification of the electron transport layer (ETL)14,15 or hole transport layer (HTL), have been made towards improving the efficiency of PSCs.16
Although some PSCs without an HTL have been reported in the literature, the HTL still plays an indispensable role in obtaining a high-efficiency PSC. An ohmic contact was formed between the HTL and perovskite light absorption layer, and HTL could help to effectively transport the hole and block the electron at the same time. To date, rapid progresses have been made on the development of hole transport materials. Spiro-OMeTAD,17 PTAA,18 and P3HT19 are commonly used as HTL in PSCs, whereas poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulphonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS)20 is still the most popular hole transport material in inverted PSCs due to its high conductivity and good transparency in the visible range.21,22 Usually, PEDOT:PSS is spin-coated on the transparent anode, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), to make its surface smooth and reduce the energy gap between ITO and perovskite light absorption layer.23,24 However, there are still some drawbacks, including high acidity and low work function (WF) of around 5.1 eV, of PEDOT:PSS that needs to be considered. Moreover, the insulated PSS exhibits adverse effect on the improvement of the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, modification of PEDOT:PSS is necessary. Currently, various processing approaches that focus on the modification of PEDOT:PSS have been reported. The performance of organic electronics (OEs) was improved by adjusting the pH of PEDOT:PSS,25 changing the morphology of PEDOT:PSS using an organic solvent,26 and enhancing the conductivity of the polymer matrix containing PEDOT:PSS and other conductive dopants or surfactants.27,28
However, phenol-based p-type material has rarely been reported. In our previous studies29–31 as well as in some other studies,32,33 it has been reported that hydroxyl-rich aromatic compounds have hole mobility. Moreover, hole mobility increased with the increasing content of the hydroxyl group. Therefore, we have developed several aromatic phenolic derivatives such as lignin, phenolic resins, to act as p-type materials in OPVs and OLEDs.29–31,34,35 Melanin-like polydopamine (PDA), with a high hydroxyl group content, was obtained via the self-polymerization of DA in a weak alkaline solution under ambient conditions or via acid oxidation with an oxidant agent such as ammonium persulfate (APS).36,37 PDA attracted attention as a novel coating material in 2007,38 and gradually, its derivatives were applied in batteries, supercapacitors, and catalysts, as reported in the literature.39–42 PDA, with electron-rich blocks containing catechol hydroxyl and semiquinone radical,43 was speculated to act as either an amorphous organic semiconductor or an electronic-ionic hybrid conductor.44–46 Moreover, it has the ability to fine-tune the electronic properties with suitable co-substrates during the polymerization process.
In the pursuit of high PCEs, we tried to modify PEDOT:PSS directly to improve the efficiency of the devices. DA, EDOT, and PSS were mixed, and the oxidant agent ammonium persulfate was subsequently added. DA-PEDOT:PSS was obtained after the reaction was carried out for 24 h. PSS was used as a template and dispersant to disperse the DA-EDOT copolymer during the process of polymerization. Interestingly, the work function of DA-PEDOT:PSS increased to 5.33 eV owing to the introduction of a DA building block, quite well matched that of the perovskite light absorption layer. This novel material was carefully studied and applied in PSCs as an HEM. The detailed chemical/physical properties and working mechanism in the devices have been discussed hereinafter.
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of DA-PEDOT:PSS
In this study, PSS was doped into PEDOT and PDA, and then, the resulting PEDOT:PDA:PSS was dispersed in an aqueous solution. Self-polymerization of DA could occur in the presence of the oxidizing agent APS under acidic conditions. DA-PEDOT:PSS with a mass ratio of 1:0.2:6 (PEDOT:PDA:PSS) was prepared, and its structure was studied via FTIR, UV-vis absorption, and transmittance measurements. The FTIR spectra of DA-PEDOT:PSS, EDOT, and DA are shown in Fig. S1.† The bending vibration peak at 892 cm−1 attributed to the thiophene ring disappeared after polymerization. Moreover, the vibration absorption peaks, including the CC, C–C, and C–S stretching vibration peaks observed at 1486 cm−1, 1365 cm−1 and 935 cm−1, and 761 cm−1, respectively, of the thiophene ring of the EDOT monomer shifted as a result of PSS doping. Moreover, a weak absorption peak appeared between 800 and 700 cm−1 after polymerization, indicating the replacement of aromatic hydrogen. In addition, the peak around 3349 cm−1 was attributed to amidogen of DA and it disappeared in the spectra of DA-PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, the strong absorption peak at 1630 cm−1 can be ascribed to the indole structure obtained due to the self-polymerization of DA. Upon the introduction of PSS, the absorption peaks at about 1125 cm−1 and 1037 cm−1 were obtained that corresponded to the stretching modes of the SO bond of the sulfonic groups in PSS (Scheme 1).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of PEDOT:PSS and DA-PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions are demonstrated in Fig. S2.† There was an evident absorption band at around 800 nm in both the PEDOT:PSS-4083 and DA-PEDOT:PSS UV-vis absorption spectra, which further confirmed the successful preparation of DA-PEDOT:PSS in the present study. Compared to the transmittance of the blank glass substrate (Fig. S3†), the transmittance of PEDOT:PSS and DA-PEDOT:PSS films exhibited a decline to some extent depending on the content of the dopant and film thickness. However, the dopant content and film thickness still met the requirement for high transmittance.
The electrochemical behaviors of PEDOT:PSS and DA-PEDOT:PSS were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). PDA:PSS and DA-PEDOT:PSS were deposited on the working electrode in a 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 (in CH2Cl2) solution, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. Note that the work function (WF) of DA-PEDOT:PSS was estimated to be 5.33 eV, which was lower than 5.1 eV of PEDOT:PSS. Moreover, in the presence of PDA, a pronounced quasi-reversible redox process occurred. It was reasoned that PDA was capable of fine-tuning the electronic property during the polymerization with the co-substrate PEDOT, further controlling the WF and improving the reversibility of the oxidation process. The repeatability of DA-PEDOT:PSS was excellent after 10 scanning runs. As a comparison, there was no obvious initial oxidation potential in PEDOT:PSS-4083 CV curve, but it showed very good electrochemical reversibility.

For PEDOT:PSS, the conductivity was determined to be 0.020 S cm−1 when the thickness was 8383 nm, whereas for DA-PEDOT:PSS, it was 0.016 S cm−1 when the thickness was 3419 nm. This demonstrated that the addition of dopamine had a negligible effect on the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. However, note that DA-PEDOT:PSS had a higher pH value of 5.2 as compared to PEDOT:PSS that had a low pH value of 1.8, thereby generating less acid corrosion.
The morphology of PEDOT:PSS and DA-PEDOT:PSS films was evaluated via AFM (Fig. 2). The surfaces of both samples were quite smooth. In contract, nanoaggregates were observed for DA-PEDOT:PSS and a compact and uniform film was detected, which indicated that PEDOT:PSS chain would bend into nanoparticles due to the introduction of PDA. Furthermore, the surface morphology of different HTLs on the ITO substrates was also evaluated. The root mean square (RMS) surface roughness values of PEDOT:PSS and DA-PEDOT:PSS were 2.07 and 3.63 nm, respectively.

The film quality of perovskite on PDEOT:PSS and DA-PEDOT:PSS was investigated via XRD, SEM, and UV-vis and PL spectroscopies. As shown in Fig. 3b, the perovskite films exhibit similar diffraction patterns at (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite phase. The PEDOT:PSS-based film showed slightly higher diffraction intensity, indicating a higher degree of film crystallinity. The UV-vis spectra shown in Fig. 3a also exhibited similar absorption from UV down to the near-infrared range with slightly decreased intensity for DA-PEDOT:PSS-based film, which was consistent with the XRD results. The surface morphology determined via SEM exhibited uniform crystallites with better surface coverage (Fig. 4). This result indicated that the morphology and crystallization behavior was not affected by the HEL. The PL quenching efficiency of perovskite onto different HELs was investigated to evaluate the charge-transfer efficiency between them. As shown in Fig. 5, the DA-PEDOT:PSS-based device exhibited slightly higher quenching efficiency than the PEDOT:PSS-based device; this suggests better hole transfer in the DA-PEDOT:PSS-based device.

Moreover, 2 sets of 12 solar cell devices each were fabricated with an identical structure of ITO/HEL/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PC61BM/BCP/Ag with different HELs as the hole interlayers. The statistical device performances are shown in Fig. 6, and the average J–V curves of the PSCs with PEDOT:PSS and DA-PEDOT:PSS as the HELs are presented in Fig. 7a. The device based on DA-PEDOT:PSS exhibited a much higher Voc of 1.08 eV and slightly decreased Jsc and FF as compared to PEDOT:PSS-based device. Therefore, the PCE was enhanced to 16.6%, While PEDOT:PSS-based device only showed an efficiency of 15.2% with a Voc of 0.97 V, Jsc of 20.63 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.78. Note that the Voc of the device was significantly enhanced, which could be attributed to the fact that WF of DA-PEDOT:PSS (5.33 eV) was better aligned with the VB of perovskite (−5.4 eV). The Jsc of both devices was similar, and this was further confirmed via the IPCE curves (Fig. 7b). The integrated Jsc values obtained from the IPCE curves were 20.34 mA cm−2 and 19.40 mA cm−2, which were consistent with the Jsc measured from the J–V curves. We speculated that the self-organized PDA network could optimize the interface energy level of the HEL and reduce the energy offset at the HEL/perovskite interface. Hence, the Voc and PCE of the device enhanced after the introduction of PDA into PEDOT:PSS. To further confirm these results, the results of steady-state current density and PCE at maximum power point as a function of time were obtained. As shown in Fig. 8, for the DA-PEDOT:PSS-based device, at the voltage bias of 0.90 V, the current density and PCE remained stable after 130 s scan, and over 16.4% of PCE was demonstrated as compared to 15.1% for the PEDOT:PSS-based devices. The hysteresis behavior of the devices with different HELs was also investigated; as shown in Fig. 8, only small hysteresis could be observed between reverse and forward scans for different HELs. Therefore, the hysteresis behavior was probably not related to the HELs in the perovskite devices.

The voltage step is 0.01 V, and the delay time is 100 ms. 
Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurement was performed to investigate the built-in field of the perovskite devices. The C–V measurements were carried out in the dark at room temperature. The capacitance was measured against different bias voltages, with the AC excitation amplitude of 30 mV at the frequency of 10 kHz. For a Schottky diode, the junction capacitance showed bias dependence according to the Mott–Schottky relation, C−2 = 2(Vbi − V)/(A2qεε0N), where Vbi is the built-in potential, V is the applied voltage, A is the device active surface, q corresponds to the elementary charge, ε accounts for the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite (assumed to be 6.5), ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, and N is assumed as the doping density of perovskite. The Vbi could be estimated by the voltage corresponding to the maximum capacitance that equals the flat-band condition. As shown in Fig. S4,† the Vbi of the devices was compared. We attained 0.91 V of Vbi for the PEDOT:PSS-based device. The Vbi was enhanced to 1.08 V for the DA-PEDOT:PSS-based devices. The larger Vbi obtained for the DA-PEDOT:PSS-based device suggests larger driving force for the photogenerated carriers to be separated in the PSC. Hence, the Voc was enhanced.
Since the conductivity of the HEM was not improved, the thickness of the HEL had a significant effect on the device performance. The optimization process of the HEL was also conducted. The photovoltaic devices with various thicknesses of the HEL were fabricated. The thickness of the HEL was controlled by changing the concentration of the DA-PEDOT:PSS solution. The photovoltaic parameters extracted from the J–V curves are summarized in Table S1.† Similar to that observed in the PEDOT:PSS case, the Jsc and FF of the device gradually enhanced with the decreasing concentration of the DA-PEDOT:PSS solution. The device employing an HEL obtained from a DA-PEDOT:PSS solution having a concentration of 0.15 wt% showed the highest Jsc and FF; this could be explained by the lower series resistance caused by the reduction in the interlayer thickness. Therefore, to obtain best device performance, the interlayer should be as thin as possible and its full coverage over the ITO substrates should be ensured to control the current leakage and charge recombination. To further optimize the device efficiency, solutions were pre-filtrated before coating, and better PCE was attained.
The devices stability was also investigated by storing the unencapsulated devices under N2 condition for 28 days and measured under ambient conditions (Fig. 9). It was observed that the DA-PEDOT:PSS-based devices exhibited improved stability as compared to the PEDOT:PSS-based devices. After 28 days of aging, for the DA-PEDOT:PSS-based device, the PCE and Jsc still remained 85.4% and 89.2% as compared to 60.4% and 59.3%, respectively, for the PEDOT:PSS-based device. The reason for lowered PCE could be mainly due to the decreased Voc and Jsc. It was speculated that a less acidic solution and self-organized PDA could help block the diffusion of the impurities from ITO into CH3NH3PbI3−xClx and prevent the deterioration of the stability of the device. Contact-angle studies of several solution droplets on glass, as shown in Fig. S5,† indicated that DA-PEDOT was less hydrophilic than PEDOT:PSS, and then, it could alleviate the problem of the decomposition reaction of the perovskite layer with water.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully developed a new HEM of DA-PEDOT:PSS, in which dopamine was first doped into PEDOT:PSS. In comparison with PEDOT:PSS, the higher work function (5.33 eV) of DA-PEDOT:PSS made it an efficient HEM, which resulted in relatively higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.4% due to an evident enhancement of Voc (0.11 V). The PSC based on DA-PEDOT:PSS showed highly enhanced long-term device durability under unencapsulated condition. The PCE and Jsc retained 85.4% and 89.2% of their original values. Even after 28 days of aging as compared to 60.4% and 59.3%, respectively, for the PEDOT:PSS-based device. These results indicate a bright future for dopamine-doped PEDOT:PSS due to its promising properties.
