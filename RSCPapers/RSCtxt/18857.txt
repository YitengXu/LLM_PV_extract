    , Accepted 3rd December 2021First published on 4th December 2021AbstractThe intertwined ferroelectricity and photovoltaics in two-dimensional (2D) materials will enable the favorable improvement and control of photovoltaic performances. In this paper, we take 2D 3R bilayer BX (X = P, As, Sb) as prototype systems to study the photovoltaic characteristics of intrinsic 2D out-of-plane (OOP) ferroelectric materials, and try to explore a strategy to regulate the photoelectric properties by changing the strength of ferroelectric polarization. Due to the spatial inversion symmetry broken due to special 3R stacking, spontaneous OOP ferroelectric polarization is induced in the 3R bilayer BX, which can be switchable through specific interlayer sliding. This in turn leads to charge transfer between layers, realizing efficient spatial separation between holes and electrons and forming the characteristics of type-II band alignment. Moreover, due to perfect lattice match of two identical layers, 3R bilayer BX is more stable and easier to realize in experiments compared with most traditional 2D heterostructures made up of different materials. The 3R bilayer BX shows moderate band gap, ultra-high carrier mobility and efficient optical absorption, and its nano-devices present large photocurrent, high photon responsivity and excellent external quantum efficiency. More importantly, all these photoelectric parameters are closely related to the intrinsic OOP ferroelectric strength. By changing the interlayer distance of bilayer BX, ferroelectric polarization can be regulated effectively to achieve an optimal photoelectric performance. Finally, we emphasize the importance and universality of spatial inversion symmetry broken in 2D layered materials beyond the 3R bilayer BX to realize the co-regulation of ferroelectricity and photovoltaics.
1 Introduction
The reversible spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials is essential for high-density data storage and fast device operation without quantum tunneling or high power consumption/dissipation.1,2 Traditional ferroelectric materials were commonly based on complex oxides including ABO3 perovskites,3 lithium niobate (LiNbO3) ferroelectric crystals,4,5 and BaBi2Ta2O9,6 and plenty of their investigations and commercial applications have been proposed in the last few decades.7,8 With continuous miniaturization of electronic devices and rapid development of 2D materials, more efforts have been made toward exploring ferroelectricity in 2D materials.9–11 More strikingly, the out-of-plane (OOP) ferroelectricity in these 2D materials is more favorable than the in-plane one because the vertical polarizability is more desirable for most practical technologies.12,13 The most direct idea is to process the bulk ferroelectric materials to thin film by experimental methods. However, due to the depolarizing electrostatic field and electron reconstruction, the OOP ferroelectricity tends to vanish in experiments when the thickness of the film is below several to tens of nanometers.14,15 Therefore, it is desirable to explore 2D ferroelectric materials with intrinsic OOP polarization. So far, a series of elemental and compound 2D materials with OOP polarization have been proposed, including TMDC,16,17 BN,18 InSe,19,20 In2Se3,21,22 BiFeO323 and some other materials.24–26 Exploring 2D materials with excellent OOP ferroelectricity is still in its infancy,27,28 and it is of great significance to reveal the microscopic origin of OOP ferroelectricity and further assess its fascinating facilitation in the modern micro-electronics industry.
The utilization of solar energy by photovoltaic conversion is an effective and promising method to meet the urgent requirements of the energy crisis. In view of different generation processes of electron–hole pairs, photovoltaic systems can be generally classified into two groups. One is the traditional bulk inorganic semiconductors such as Si, CdTe, and GaAs,29 where the photo-excited electrons and holes are generated without intermediate steps but also a lack of long-range Coulomb interactions. The other refers to the excitonic solar cells (XSCs), in which the electron–hole pairs are generated upon illumination.30,31 As indicated in previous studies, the different ionization potentials and electron affinity at the donor–acceptor interfaces of XSCs would induce a high yield dissociation of excitons, and hence a substantial power conversion efficiency (PCE).32 However, the PCE of most recent XSCs is still below 12% although considerable efforts have been devoted to improving their relevant performances.33,34 Besides, many critical factors are non-negligible for highly efficient XSCs, including high visible light optical absorption,35,36 carrier mobility,37,38 small exciton binding energy,39 and moderate direct band gap (1.2–1.6 eV) of the donor.40,41
Very recently, the staggered band offset of 2D type-II heterostructures was confirmed to be favorable for the effective separation of the excitons, implying potential applications in the XSCs.38,42,43 However, type-II heterostructures cannot always be guaranteed due to the different chemical potentials between different components (there exist three different types of semiconductor heterostructures).44 In addition, most of the proposed type-II heterostructures are composed of different monolayer materials which are probably unstable in experimental manipulation due to lattice mismatch and large potential barrier between two components. Fortunately, this problem is overcome in recently proposed 2D bilayer ferroelectric films because they are stacked by the same layered materials.45,46 Due to the special stacking mode, the spatial reflection symmetry is broken, and thus a spontaneous vertical polarization between two layers is induced.26,47 This intrinsic electrostatic field gives rise to an existing possibility in designing 2D photovoltaic devices because the electrons and holes can be separated effectively in space. Moreover, recent experimental techniques of growing high-quality atomic crystals layer by layer also guarantees the feasibility of stacking individual thin films into different layered materials with van der Waals (vdWH) interactions.18,45,46 In light of the charge transfer between the interfacial layers, these newly combined 2D layered materials can enrich the exceptional properties of the isolated components and remove the limitations of their applications in many fields, and one of the potentially inspiring combinations is ferroelectricity and photoelectricity. So far, a series of 2D materials with out-of-plane polarisation based photovoltaic devices have been proposed and illustrated great potential in improving the qualities of photovoltaic devices.48–50 However, there is still a fundamental mechanism missing when designing stable and highly-efficient 2D ferroelectric/photoelectric hybrid materials or understanding their inherent physical mechanisms for diversity and efficiency. Therefore, it is timely to explore 2D ferroelectric/photoelectric hybrid materials, where the photoelectric efficiency can be naturally improved and adjusted by the intrinsic ferroelectricity.
2D hexagonal group-VA boride BX (X = P, As, Sb), derivatives of h-BN, is one of the most promising families of 2D materials, which has been successfully fabricated experimentally and widely studied in recent years.51 Plenty of prominent physical properties have been discovered in this family, including ultra-high carrier mobilities, moderate direct band gaps and novel electronic, thermal and optical properties.38,51 In this work, we take the special 3R stacking configurations of bilayer BX (X = P, As, and Sb) as examples to explore the coexistence of OOP ferroelectricity and photoelectricity using the first principles calculation method. Due to the charge redistribution induced by the unique lattice stacking, sizable and switchable OOP ferroelectric polarizations could be found in these crystals accompanied with intrinsic type-II band alignments between two semiconducting layers. The advantages of a 3R bilayer BX structure can be summarized as follows. (1) Moderate quasi-direct band gaps, ultra-high carrier mobilities and efficient optical absorptions show the appealing applications of these materials in the stable and novel 2D XSCs. (2) The photovoltaic performance can be adjusted effectively by changing the strength of OOP ferroelectric polarization. The decrease in OOP dipole moment can enhance the PCE efficiently, while its increase can induce an obvious red-shift of optical absorption in the visible light region. (3) Moreover, extremely large photon responsivities and external quantum efficiencies are obtained in the 3R BP based few-layer optoelectronic devices, which can be further enhanced by adjusting the OOP dipole moment. Our numerical results show that 2D OOP ferroelectricity can promote the improvement in photoelectric performance of 3R bilayer BX materials omnibearingly. More importantly, the fundamental mechanisms of all the above phenomena are universal and can be applied to study other layered photovoltaic ferroelectrics, and hence all these fascinating findings predicted in 3R bilayer BX systems may give guidance in the future experimental design and practical application of 2D photoelectric conversion devices and XSCs.
The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. In Section 2, the computational methods used in this work are briefly introduced. In Section 3, the numerical results accompanied with physical mechanisms are presented, including experimental feasibility, electric polarization, ferroelectric switching and tunable electronic/photovoltaic performances of the 3R bilayer BX structures. The tunable photocurrent and photovoltaic relevant quality factors in the 3R BP based nano-devices are also performed. In Section 4, a brief summary of this work is presented.
2 Model and numerical method
In this study, the structural and electronic properties of the 2D BX (X = P, As, Sb) lattices were implemented by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) based on the density functional theory (DFT).52 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)53 was used to deal with the exchange–correlation functional, and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)54 was employed to better describe the electronic and optical properties, with the fixed mixing ratio of 0.25/0.75 between Hartree–Fock and PBE exchange. The wave functions were constructed using a projector augmented wave (PAW) approach55 with a plane wave cut off energy of 500 eV, and a vacuum larger than 20 Å was used to eliminate the spurious interaction perpendicular to the 2D plane. Monkhorst–Pack k-point meshes of 9 × 9 × 1 and 15 × 15 × 1 were used for geometry optimization and self-consistent electronic structure calculations. The structures are fully relaxed with convergence criteria of 0.01 eV Å−1 for force and 10−5 eV for energy. The phonon spectrum was implemented using the Phonopy code,56 and the ab initio molecular dynamics simulation was performed within a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell with canonical (NVT) ensemble at zero pressure under 300 K with a time step of 1 fs lasting 5 ps. The energy barriers during ferroelectric switching were calculated using the method of nudged elastic band (NEB),57 and the ferroelectric polarization was evaluated using the Berry phase approach.58,59
The photovoltaic transport in the 2D BP-based nano-device was studied by the first principles quantum transport package NanoDcal,60–62 which was based on the combination of non-equilibrium Green's function and DFT (NEGF-DFT).60 In this calculation, the norm-conserving nonlocal pseudo-potential was used to define the atomic core,63 and the wave function was expanded by the atomic orbital basis set with double-zeta polarization (DZP). The exchange–correlation potential was handled at the PBE level.64 A 24 × 1 k-meshed grid was set in the self-consistent calculation, and a 256 × 1 k-meshed grid was adopted in the photocurrent calculation. Finally, the convergence criteria of self-consistence was set less than 10−5 eV.
3 Numerical results and discussions
3.1 Electric polarization and ferroelectric switching in 3R bilayer BX (X = P, As, Sb)
Monolayer BX is a planar hexagonal lattice material similar to graphene, where B atoms and X atoms are evenly distributed in the vertices of the hexagon adjacently, and can be exfoliated from their ultra-pure single crystals.65 Similar to those of h-BN, different stacking configurations of the 2D bilayer BX can be divided into three typical stacking pattens, namely 1T, 2H and 3R stackings. For the 1T bilayer BX, the top and the bottom layers overlap completely without any dislocation or distortion, and thus no vertical electric polarization occurs due to the mirror symmetry between two layers (see Fig. S1(a), ESI‡). For the 2H stacking, where B(X) atoms in the bottom layer are right below the X(B) atoms in the top layer, the top layer is 180° rotated with respect to the bottom, which makes the crystals centrosymmetric and thus no OOP polarization is induced.66 Here, we mainly consider the 3R stacking pattens. While for the 3R stacking BX, the X atoms in the bottom layer are right below the hexagon centers of the top layer, and the B atoms in the bottom layer are right below the X atoms in the top layer as shown in Fig. 1(a). Due to this staggered stacking configuration, the horizontal mirror symmetry between the top layer and the bottom layer is broken, and a spontaneous electric polarization perpendicular to the plane is induced. The relaxed interlayer distance is equal to 3.5 Å, 3.4 Å and 2.6 Å for BP, BAs and BSb, respectively. With an increase of interlayer interaction from BP to BSb, the planar bilayer structures gradually evolve into wrinkled ones especially for BSb as shown in Fig. 1(a), which further increases the spatial reflection asymmetry and induces larger polarization. In order to obtain the polarization direction, the renormalized real space charge density difference Δρ(r) was calculated. Δρ(r) = [ρ3R − ρtop − ρbottom]/n, where ρ3R, ρtop and ρbottom are the charge density of 3R bilayer BX, and the individual top and bottom monolayer, respectively, and n = 2 indicates bilayers. Both the 1D plane integrated Δρ(z) and 3D isosurface plot of Δρ(r) are displayed in Fig. 1(b). Obviously, charge depletes in the top layer, while it accumulates in the bottom layer for each 3R BX, which can be qualitatively understood by the distortion of the 2pz orbital of the X atoms sitting atop B atoms.67 Bader charge analysis suggests that there are 0.014, 0.023 and 0.257 electrons transferred from the top layer to the bottom layer for 3R BP, BAs and BSb, respectively. The increased charge accumulation at the interface from BP to BSb indicates stronger interlayer interaction of the latter than the former. This asymmetry induced interlayer electric polarization has been reported in other 2D vdWHs and confirmed a 2D out-plane ferroelectric phase.18,25,47 In addition, for 3R bilayer BP and BAs, the optimized interfacial distances are 3.5 Å and 3.4 Å, which are much larger than the summation of the covalent radii of the B and P(As) atoms, thus no covalent bonding is formed in their bilayers as shown in the side view panels of electron localized functions (ELFs) in Fig. S3 (ESI‡), and suggesting a weak vdW interaction of 3R bilayer BP and BAs. As for 3R bilayer BSb, strong interlayer interactions and charge transfers are driven because of the relatively smaller interlayer distance, and covalent bonding tends to form between the interlayer. As a result, a larger interlayer potential barrier is formed as indicated in Fig. 1(b). However, this potential barrier is still acceptable compared with those of the conventional vdWHs.44 In order to quantitatively characterize the polarization intensity, the magnitude of interfacial polarization density P was calculated based on the Berry phase method, which is roughly equal to the polarized surface charge density multiplied by the interlayer distance.68 The calculated values are PBP = 1.6 × 10−12 C m−1, PBAs = 2.2 × 10−12 C m−1 and PBSb = 13.9 × 10−12 C m−1, which are comparable or larger than those of bilayer BN (2.0 × 10−12 C m−1)69 and 1T MoS2 (0.22 μC m−2),70 indicating strong out-plane ferroelectricity of 3R bilayer BX. The increased P from BP to BSb is attributed to the discontinuity of electrostatic potentials (ΔV) between the top and bottom layers, which is equal to 0.15 V, 0.18 V and 0.47 V, respectively, for 3R BP, BAs and BSb as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI‡). It should be noted that the larger the ΔV, the larger the interface dipole and the resultant polarization.71,72 The much larger difference of ΔV between BSb and BAs than that between BAs and BP is attributed to the wrinkled structure of BSb.

(c) The reaction energy barriers and (d) the magnitudes of dipole moment along the ferroelectric switching pathway. The three insets in (c) are side view atomic structures at the initial, middle and final states in the ferroelectric switching pathway. 
In order to confirm the ferroelectric phase of this out-plane polarization, the modest energy barrier Φ is detected by evaluating the total energies at different transition states for each 3R BX. A series of transition states can be obtained by sliding the top layer along the armchair direction until the bilayer BX returns to its initial 3R configuration. It is easy to find that when the sliding distance is equal to two times the B-X bond length, the final stacking is the same as the top-bottom flipped initial 3R stacking. Using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method, the evolution of total energies along the reaction path is shown in Fig. 1(c). Due to the interlayer vdW interactions, the reaction energies increase firstly and then decrease symmetrically for all the bilayer BX due to the same initial and final 3R stacking configurations. In other words, the modest energy barriers of ΦBP = 19.5 meV per f.u., ΦBAs = 28.4 meV per f.u., and ΦBSb = 128.5 per f.u. meV−1 should be surmounted during the interlayer translation from the initial 3R stacking to the final 3R stacking. The gradually enlarged energy barriers from BP to BSb can be ascribed to the enhanced interlayer vdW interaction. These values of reaction energy are comparable or lower than that of bilayer 3R MoS2 (17.3 meV per f.u.),73 α-In2Se2 (50 meV per f.u.),74 functionalized bismuth layer (120–548 meV per f.u.),75 and γ-GeSe (887 meV per f.u.),76 implying entirely robust experimental feasibility.
Furthermore, the ferroelectric switching of the 3R BX structures along the reaction path is shown in Fig. 1(d). Owing to the top-bottom reversion between the initial and the final stackings, the magnitudes of the interfacial dipole moments are centrosymmetric along the total reaction path indicating a reversion of out-plane ferroelectricity. Based on the obtained P, the interlayer voltage U can be estimated coarsely by using the formula U = P/ε0, where ε0 is vacuum permittivity. For 3R stacking BX, U is equal to ±0.12 V, ±0.15 V and ±0.57 V, respectively, for BP, BAs and BSb. By dragging either monolayer along the armchair direction, these interlayer voltages can be reversed periodically. This theoretical modeling of lateral sliding can be realized equivalently in experiments though domain-wall motion of twisted bilayers.66,77 Such intriguing vertical ferroelectric switching properties can be used as a nanogenerator, where the electron flow and energy harvesting will be manipulated with the mechanism akin to the previously designed triboelectric nanogenerator.78–80
3.2 Crystal stabilities and electronic properties of 3R BX (X = P, As, Sb)
Before further evaluating the electric properties of ferroelectric 3R bilayer BX, their structural stability should be examined. First of all, the real space projection of electron localized functions (ELFs) was calculated to characterize the bonding types of 3R BX. The magnitude of ELF from 0 to 1 describes the spatial localization of the reference electrons, where ELF = 1 or 0 represents complete localization or full decentralization of the electrons. For each 3R bilayer BX, substantial concentration of electrons is located between the B and X atoms as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI‡), indicating a strong covalent bonding feature and stable configuration. Next, the interfacial binding energy was calculated to examine the energy stability of the 3R bilayer BX by Eb = (E3R − Etop − Ebottom)/S, where E3R, Etop and Ebottom are energies of the unit cell of the 3R bilayer BX, the free-standing top and bottom monolayer, respectively, and S is the area of the unit cell. The interfacial binding energies were found to be Eb,BP = −0.27 J m−2, Eb,BAs = −0.35 J m−2 and Eb,BSb = −1.20 J m−2, which are comparable to those of some recently reported vdWHs including WTe2/HfS2 (−0.204 J m−2),81 phosphorene/SnSe2 (−0.019 J m−2),82 and KAgSe/SiC2 (−0.327 J m−2).44 Moreover, the stability of 3R bilayer BX was further confirmed by a phonon spectrum and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. As shown in Fig. 2(a–c), no imaginary phonon mode is observed in the entire Brillouin zone, confirming the dynamical stability of the 3R BX structures. Finally, the temporal evolution of the total energies of 3 × 3 3R BX supercells was evaluated to examine their thermal stabilities. The temperature is set equal to 300 K and the evolutionary time is up to 10 ps with a time step of 1 fs. As shown in Fig. 2(d–f), the total energy of each 3R BX oscillates around a fixed value with only small fluctuations, indicating the thermal stability of each 3R BX during the temporal evolution. Meanwhile, the structural integrity of dynamic configurations is maintained well without a broken bond or geometry reconstruction, revealing the excellent thermal stability of each 3R BX structure even at high temperature. Finally, we also mention that the above calculations only deduce the stability of the 3R bilayer BX to a certain extent theoretically, which is discrepant with the judgement of the medium-low thermodynamic stability in experimental synthesis.83,84 In view of the detailed numerical exploration to the general strategy of co-existence of photovoltaics and ferroelectricity, the 2D layered BX are still very interesting materials theoretically.

In the following, we examine the electronic properties of the 3R bilayer BX. Fig. 3(a) shows the band structure, projected density of states (PDOS) and partial charge densities of 3R bilayer BP with the exchange–correlation interaction considered at both PBE and HSE06 levels. Obviously, the band structures based on both exchange–correlation interactions are qualitatively consistent. The 3R bilayer BP shows indirect band gap semiconducting behavior with a band gap equal to 0.73 eV at the PBE level and 1.15 eV at the HSE06 level. The moderate band gap at the HSE06 level is very close to the optimum range of 1.2–1.6 eV for excitonic solar cells (XSCs).40 The conduction band minimum (CBM) is located at the K point, while the valence band maximum (VBM) is slightly deviated away from K point accompanied with tiny upward movement from the B point to C point. Considering that the bands of the bilayer should be roughly a superposition of those from two individual monolayers (see Fig. S1(b), ESI‡) due to very weak vdWH interaction, we expect that this indirect band gap can be ascribed to the interlayer built-in electric field caused by the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization. To further confirm this conjecture, the electronic behaviors of the 1T bilayer BP is also plotted in Fig. 3(b). Obviously, direct band gap behavior is observed for either PBE or HSE calculation, where both the CBM and VBM are located at the K point. Its band gap is equal to 0.42 eV at the PBE level and 0.78 eV at the HSE06 level, which is smaller than that of the corresponding 3R bilayer BP, indicating the stronger interlayer vdWH interaction of 1T BP. As shown by PDOS in the middle panels of Fig. 3(a) and (b), the CBMs are dominated by the B-pz orbitals, while the VBMs are mainly contributed by the P-pz for both 3R and 1T bilayer BP indicating their similarity. However, further calculation of partial charge densities as shown in the right panels of Fig. 3(a) and (b) points out their differences. For the 1T bilayer BP, both the CBM and the VBM are equally contributed by the top layer and the bottom layer, and therefore there is no interlayer charge polarization. Meanwhile, for the 3R bilayer BP, the CBM is mostly dominated by the bottom layer, and the VBM is mainly contributed by the top layer, indicating obvious spatial separation between the CBM and the VBM. As a result, a type-II band alignment is formed for the 3R bilayer BP owing to the real space charge separation between CBM and VBM. This typical type-II band alignment can be seen more intuitively from the fourth panel of Fig. 5(a), where the bands are projected to the top and the bottom layers and distinguished using different colors. A similar behavior of type-II band alignment and real space electron–hole separation was also found for 3R bilayer BAs and BSb as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively, apart from the enlarged delocalizations of VBM and the decreased band gaps due to the stronger electric polarization. In Fig. 4(a), we provide a more essential and intuitive physical image to present the type-II band alignment of 3R BP, where the left and right line segments indicate different orbital energies of acceptor and donor layers. Although the arrangement of energy levels is qualitatively correct, the quantitative values can be obtained by ranking the energies of the maximum value of PDOS projected to different orbitals of each atom. The CBM and VBM of the top and bottom layer are dominated by B-pz and P-pz, respectively. Obviously, driven by the interlayer built-in electric field, the energy levels of B-pz and P-pz from the top layer are higher than those of the bottom layer.

In each panel, the Fermi level of each system is set to zero and marked by the green vertical dotted lines. The band structures at the PBE (HSE06) levels are labeled with black (red) lines, the DOS, PDOS, and partial charge densities are obtained at the PBE level, and the value of the isosurface in each middle panel is set at 0.0007 e Å−3.

The region of visible light in each panel is denoted by the colored translucent shadow areas between two vertical dashed lines. 
For this type-II 3R bilayer BP ferroelectric system, a series of intriguing photovoltaic merits will be formed naturally. (1) Different from 1T bilayer BP, the built-in electric field in 3R bilayer BP can facilitate the separation of the free electrons and holes into different layers, accompanied with a reduction in the photo-excited electron–hole recombination opportunity. (2) As for the heterojunctions with distinct 2D materials, a lattice mismatch would induce large potential barriers which limits their stability and experimental synthesis. In addition, the possible type-I or type-III band alignments between layers may restrict their application in the photovoltaic field.38,44,85,86 Instead, the 3R bilayer BP possesses identical component materials, intrinsic type-II band alignment and nearly complete real space electron–hole separation. (3) The unique vertical ferroelectric switching properties enable the realization of electron–hole separation and reversion in real space by relative translation between layers. These properties of 3R bilayer BP are appealing for experimental design, application and manipulation in the field of optoelectronic devices and solar energy conversions.87 More importantly, these ideal performances of ferroelectric photovoltaic materials may also exist in other 2D layered crystals beyond the 3R bilayer BX.
3.3 Carrier mobilities and optical absorptions of 3R BX (X = P, As, Sb)
In light of the potential application in 2D photoluminescence devices, the carrier mobility and optical absorption coefficient are two fundamental factors to be explored. The carrier mobilities of the 3R bilayer BX are calculated based on the deformation potential (DP) theory, which can be expressed as follows,88 (1)where C2D is the elastic modulus, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature,  is the effective mass of electrons or holes, and E1 is the deformation potential. This model of deformation potential theory has been used extensively to examine the μ2D of 2D atomic structures. Herein, the validity of this method was firstly examined by calculating the carrier mobility of MoS2. Numerical results show that the carrier mobility of MoS2 is equal to ∼1.16(1.31) × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and ∼1.62(1.48) × 102 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes along the armchair (zigzag) direction, which are in accordance with previous first principles results (∼1.36(1.37) × 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and ∼1.78(1.51) × 102 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes along the armchair (zigzag) direction).89 As shown in Table 1, ultra-high carrier mobilities were found for the proposed 3R bilayer BX structures. For example, the maximum μ2D of the 3R bilayer BP can reach 5.72 × 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons along the armchair direction. These ultra-high carrier mobilities of 3R bilayer BX can further highlight their potential application prospects in electronics and photoelectronics.

The optical absorption coefficient a(ω) was calculated based on the following formula,90 (2)where ω is the frequency of incident light, c is the light velocity, and ε1 and ε2 are the real and imaginary parts of the frequency-dependent dielectric function, respectively. ε2 is firstly calculated in the independent-particle picture without including the local field effects,90,91 and then ε1 can be calculated by Kramers-Kronig transformation. In view of three electric polarization vectors along the x, y and z directions of the incident light, there are three corresponding components of a(ω), namely ax, ay and az. For a 2D system, az can be ignored because it is significantly weaker than ax and ay. Meanwhile, ax and ay are very close for each 3R BX bilayer, and thus we only consider ax in the following. In this calculation, the directions of polarization vectors of the incident light were set parallel to the plane. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 4(b), a(ω) maintains zero for each 3R BX until ω of the incident light is larger than the cut-off frequency, and then increases versus the energy of incident light. Besides, the curves of a(ω) obtained at the HSE06 level are qualitatively consistent with the curves obtained at the PBE level with proper blue shifts, which is in accordance with the information given by the band structures as shown in Fig. 3. Intriguingly, all a(ω) curves possess wide peaks over the range of visible light (∼1.6–3.2 eV). The maximum values can reach ∼4.95–7.75 × 105 cm−1 for 3R BP, BAs, and BSb, respectively, which are very close to that of MoS2 (∼1.5 × 106 cm−1),92 and one order of magnitude larger than those of ideal 2D layered MoSSe93 and InSe.94 To further understand the mechanism of the large absorption coefficients of these 3R bilayer BX, the absorption spectrua of the monolayer and 1T bilayer BP were also evaluated to make a comparison as shown in the right panel of Fig. 4(b). Obviously, a(ω) of the 3R bilayer BP is the largest over the visible light range, indicating most excellent optical absorption performances.
3.4 Tunable effects of interfacial distance on the 3R bilayer BP
In light of the qualitatively consistent band structures, and electric and photoelectric properties of the 3R bilayer BX, in the following, we chose the 3R bilayer BP as a representative to regulate the electric and photoelectric properties by changing its interfacial distance, which can be implemented through applying a vertical strain by vacuum thermal annealing or imposing pressure with a scanning tunneling microscopy tip in experiments.95,96 As shown in Fig. 5(a), when the interfacial distance d of the 3R bilayer BP increases from 2.9 Å to 4.1 Å, the band gap increases from 0.91 eV to 1.29 eV (HSE06), accompanying a conversion from indirect band gap to direct band gap. This variation in band gap is desirable to enhance the photovoltaic performance of the material. To understand the variation in band gap, charge transfer Δq and binding energy Eb under different d were evaluated and are presented in Fig. 5(b). Eb remains negative within the entire range of d, indicating the energetic stability of the 3R bilayer BP under all vertical strain, and the minimum value appears at the equilibrium distance d = 3.5 Å. The energy of the system is increased as a uniaxial tensile or compression strain is applied perpendicular to the plane, which is similar to other 2D materials.44 Meanwhile, Δq decreases monotonically versus d, revealing declined charge transfer from the top layer to the bottom layer. More visually, real space charge transfer under three typical interfacial distances is shown in the top panel of Fig. 5(c), where charge accumulation at the interface attenuates with an increase in interlayer distance, indicating decaying interfacial interaction. Considering that the dipole moment P is roughly proportional to the product of Δq and d, P decays monotonically as a function of d as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 5(c). Finally, the transition from indirect band gap to direct band gap happened along with the decaying of the interfacial interaction.
 Fig. 5  Band structures of the 3R bilayer BP under various interlayer distances d at the HSE06 level. In each panel, the bands are projected to the top and the bottom layers with different magnitudes indicated by different colors. The green horizontal lines denote the Fermi level, and the red arrows indicate the indirect-to-direct band gap variation. (b) Electron transfer (Δq) from the top layer to the bottom layer and the binding energy (Eb) as functions of d. (c) Top panel: Isosurface of the charge density difference under three different d. The yellow and green regions correspond to charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. Bottom panel: Dipole moment P changes over d. (d) Band gap ΔE, conduction band offset ΔEc and band gap of the donor segment Egversus interlayer distance d. In (b) and (d), the white vertical line represents the equilibrium interfacial distance of the system. 
Next, we explore the tunable photovoltaic performances of the 3R bilayer BP under various vertical strains. Fig. 6(a) presents the optical absorption coefficients a(ω) under different interlayer distances at both the PBE and HSE06 levels. The curves obtained at the HSE06 level are roughly in accord with the blue-shifted curves obtained at the PBE level with qualitative agreement. More intriguingly, both the magnitudes and positions of the peaks of a(ω) were changed obviously under different vertical strains. Especially when d is compressed to 2.9 Å, a significant red-shift and stronger capture performance of the visible light spectrum is generated due to the band recombination under vertical strain. The red-shift of a(ω) along with the decreased interlayer distance is mainly attributed to the decaying band gap. Such an interesting phenomenon is rarely found but is highly desirable in practical light-harvesting applications.

The polarization vector is set parallel to the plane and along the zigzag edges. The two vertical dashed lines indicate the visible light region. (b) Phase diagram of PCE as functions of donor bandgap Eg and conduction band offset ΔEc under different interlayer distance d. 
PCE is another important factor used to describe the efficiency of XSC, which can be calculated by,97 (3)where 0.65 is the assumed value of the band-fill factor, Eg is the band gap of the donor segment, ΔEc is the magnitude of the conduction band offset, which is equal to the difference between the CBM of the donor segment and CBM of the acceptor segment, (Eg − ΔEc − 0.3) is the estimated value of the maximum open circuit voltage, and P(ħω) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux with the photon energy of ħω. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the band gap of 2D 3R bilayer BP (ΔE) increases gradually with stretching of the interlayer distance d, while Eg and ΔEc decrease monotonically due to the reduced vdWH interaction. As a result the PCE increases with interlayer distance. Fig. 6(b) shows the phase diagram of PCE versus Eg and ΔEc of the 3R bilayer BP under different interlayer distances. At the equilibrium interlayer distance (3.5 Å), Eg and ΔEc are 1.74 eV and 0.60 eV, respectively, and the PCE can reach 11.7%. This large PCE is equal to the best certified efficiency of the organic solar cell (11.7%),98 and is larger than that of the typical MoS2/p-Si heterojunction solar cell (5.23%).99 Here, we should mention that the calculated PCE values of bilayer BP is based on HSE06. In view of the influence of excitonic effects on the electronic properties of 2D materials,100,101 we further take monolayer BP as an example to calculate the band structure at the G0W0 level. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI‡), the band structures at both levels are qualitatively consistent with the band gap at HSE06 (1.55 eV) which is slightly smaller than that at the G0W0 level (1.66 eV). As a result, the underestimated value of Eg under HSE06 rather than the G0W0 level may slightly overestimate the value of PCE, but the regulation trend of d on PCE is consistent. Therefore, considering the expensive cost of G0W0 computation, we take the HSE functional inside, which has been proved a proper approximation to obtain accurate band gaps for lots of semi-conducting materials. When d is widened from 3.5 Å to 4.5 Å, the PCE increases from 11.7% to 22.6%. This high PCE is better than those of most available materials so far,102 such as the recently reported TiNX1/TiNX2 XSCs (X1 ≠ X2 = F, Cl, Br) (∼18–22%).40 In addition, the effects of interlayer sliding on PCE were also studied. As sliding occurs in the first half period, the PCE is increased from 11.7% to more than 14.5% with the OOP dipole moment P disappearing gradually. All these excellent tunable performances of solar absorption and PCE indicate that our new designed 3R bilayer BP structure can behave as an ideal XSCs.
3.5 Photocurrent in different types of 2D BP based nanodevices
Although favorable photovoltaic properties of 2D 3R bilayer BP have been discovered, they are still qualitative predictions due to the limitation of periodic boundary conditions. For a practical nano-electronic device, electrodes must be included and the quantum scattering inside the device has to be solved under the open boundary condition. Therefore, it is necessary to build a 2D 3R bilayer BP based device and further examine its photovoltaic transport performances. Fig. 7(a) shows two schematic structures of pure monolayer and 3R bilayer BP based 2D two-probe devices, where both leads are constructed by periodic extension of the scattering region. Compared with traditional metal-semiconductor tunneling junctions, there are more advantages of these pure BP devices including simple structure, perfect lattice matching, smooth and continuous interface and easy device preparation. As reported in previous studies, this simplified device model was confirmed to be effective at evaluating the photo-electronic transport in practical devices,38,40,41 and has been employed extensively in experimental battery design.38,40,41,44,82 For each nanodevice shown in Fig. 7(a), the whole scattering region was irradiated using a linearly polarized light which is perpendicular to the planar, and a small bias voltage was applied between the source and the drain to drive the flow of photocurrent. When the photon energy is greater than the band gap, electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band accompanied with the generation of electron–hole pairs. Driven by the potential difference between the source and drain, the electron–hole pairs were further separated to electrons and holes transferring along opposite directions, and finally a photocurrent occurs. In our calculation, the bias voltage is equal to 0.2 V, which is far less than the band gap of BP to ensure only the photocurrent is generated. At the first order of Born approximation, the photocurrent flowing into the left probe can be expressed as follows,103–105 (4)where ΓL is the line-width function representing the coupling between the central scattering region and the left electrode; G<(ph) = Gr(ph)Σr(ph)Ga(ph) is the lesser Green's function of the two probe system including an electron-photon interaction with Gr(ph) being the retarded Green's function and fL is the Fermi distribution function of the left electrode. More detailed theoretical formalism of photocurrent can be found in ref. 104 and 105.
 Fig. 7  (a) Schematic structures of 2D two-probe devices based on the monolayer BP (top panel) and the bilayer 3R BP (bottom panel). The drain and source are marked by the left red box and right green region, respectively. The yellow zone in the center scattering region indicates the lighting area. (b) Photocurrent of the two-probe systems based on the monolayer (1L) and bilayer BP under different vertical strains. The incident photon energy of each system is set equal to the corresponding band gap. 

Fig. 7(b) shows the photocurrent density Jph = IphL/S of monolayer BP and 3R bilayer BP nanodevices with three different interlayer distances d when the incident photon energy Eph is equal to the band gap ΔE of the corresponding BP. Jph of different BP devices can reach 13.8–213.5 μA mm−2, which are large enough for experimental detection. For the 3R bilayer BP device at an equilibrium interlayer distance (3.5 Å), Jph is roughly 3.5 times larger than that of the monolayer BP device due to the stronger absorption ability and type-II band alignment. For the bilayer 3R BP devices, Jph is largely improved from 13.8 μA mm−2 to 213.5 μA mm−2 with increasing d from 2.9 Å to 4.1 Å (here, the control of d has been experimentally realized by interlayer engineering intercalated with different ions such as cations, multivalent cations, molecules, or ionic liquid106,107). This phenomenon can be attributed to increasing PCE and conversion from an indirect to direct band gap as d is varied, considering their similar optical absorptions and type-II band alignments. Compared with the indirect band gap systems, the excitation of electrons in the direct band gap devices no longer needs the assistance of phonons, hence suggesting a much larger photocurrent. On the contrary, the obvious indirect band gap and ultra-low PCE of the bilayer device with d = 2.9 Å reduce Jph even smaller than that of the monolayer device. Note that all results in Fig. 7(b) were calculated at the PBE level considering the huge computational cost of photocurrent in the HSE06 calculation. We believe that the photocurrents obtained at the HSE06 level should be accordant qualitatively with those obtained at the PBE level with quantitative difference.
In the following, we discuss the variation of Jphversus energy Eph and polarization angle θ of linearly polarized incident light. As shown in Fig. 8, broad peaks of Jph are detected in the visible light region with the maximum value equal to 72 μA mm−2 for the monolayer BP device and 108–144 μA mm−2 for the three 3R bilayer devices. The maximum peaks of Jph are slightly shifted to the lower energies compared with the peaks of the optical absorption coefficients a(ω) shown in Fig. 6(a). This is reasonable in terms of the high electron–hole recombination rate and quantum transport in the 2D devices.108 In addition, the energy difference between the maximum peaks of Jph is also close to the energy difference between the two maximum values of the density of states near the Fermi energy (see Fig. S4, ESI‡). The detected maximum values of Jph are far larger than those of the MoS2 and KAgSe devices under the same external conditions,41,109 indicating appealing photoelectric conversion performances of these 2D BP devices in the visible light range. For the three 3R bilayer BP devices, an obvious red-shift of the Jph peak is observed when the interlayer distance is stressed from 4.1 Å to 2.9 Å. In addition, Jph of each BP device is roughly symmetrical relative to θ = 90° with the maximum values located at θ = 90°. This is reasonable because Jph can be expressed as a linear superposition of three terms, which is proportional to sin2θ, cos2θ, and sin2θ, respectively, and the final magnitude of Jph is determined by the competition of these three trigonometric terms.104 In view of the enlarged band gaps and right-shift a(ω) peak under HSE06 calculations, we expect that the peaks of Jph obtained at the HSE06 level should be pushed toward the ultraviolet direction as happened in previous reports.41
 Fig. 8  Photocurrent density Jphversus incident light energy Eph and polarization angle θ, for (a) monolayer BP and bilayer 3R BP with an interlayer distance d is equal to (b) 4.1 Å, (c) 3.5 Å, and (d) 2.9 Å at the PBE level. The power density Pin of the incident light is 103 μW mm−2. 
Finally, the photon responsivity Rph and external quantum efficiency τeqe were evaluated based on Jph, which are also essential parameters in describing the photovoltaic performance in experiments. Rph is defined by the ratio of Jph to the incident photon flux Fph,110,111 (5)where e is the electron charge, and the photon flux Fph = Pin/(e·Eph) describes the number of incident photons per unit area and time, and the power density of incident light (Pin) was set to 103 μW mm−2, which is a typical value of the solar power, i.e. AM1.5. τeqe describes the ratio of the excited photoelectrons to the incident photons, which can be calculated by38,111 τeqe = RphEph/e.(6)
In our calculation, the maximum values of the aforementioned parameters are located at Eph = 2.62 eV, 2.61 eV, 2.31 eV, and 2.11 eV for monolayer and 3R bilayer BP with d = 4.1 Å, 3.5 Å, and 2.9 Å, respectively. In Table 2, the Rph and τeqe are listed including our designed BP devices and previously reported experimental and theoretical parameters. We find that these parameters in our designed BP devices are comparable and even larger than most of the previous reported ones. Especially, both Rph and τ are strongly enhanced in the 3R bilayer BP with large interlayer distance. All these results suggest that the 3R bilayer BP structures are appealing 2D solar cell materials, and the fundamental mechanisms inside can be generalized to other 2D 3R bilayer BX. More importantly, these ideal performances of ferroelectric photovoltaic materials may also exist in other 2D layered crystals beyond the 3R bilayer BX. Therefore, this tunable photoelectric performance may provide a thought for future experimental design of 2D photoelectric conversion devices.

4 Discussion
In summary, we carried out first principles calculations and NEGF-DFT transport models, etc to investigate the photovoltaic properties of 3R bilayer BX(X = P, As, Sb) and explore their potential applications as 2D XSCs. Due to the intrinsic OOP ferroelectricity induced by inversion symmetry breaking, the CBM and VBM are dominated by different layers and a type-II band alignment is formed spontaneously. Lots of intriguing performances were demonstrated for these systems, including moderate band gaps, ultrahigh carrier mobilities, efficient optical absorption in the visible light region and large PCE. These essential parameters of photoelectric materials can be further enhanced and a desirable red-shift of the Jph peak is presented by increasing the interlayer distance, which makes better use of visible and near-infrared light. Excellent photoelectric conversion behaviors are also detected in the 3R bilayer BP based nanodevices. Remarkable photocurrents, photon responsivities and external quantum efficiencies were also obtained. These ideal properties reveal an appealing application of 3R bilayer BX in photoelectric conversion and XSCs. Moreover, the efficient and adjustable photovoltaic performances driven by the intrinsic OOP ferroelectricity in 3R bilayer BP may well provide an alternative platform for future experimental design of various nanoscale ferroelectric-photovoltaic devices.
