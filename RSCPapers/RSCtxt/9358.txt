    , Accepted 26th March 2013First published on 5th April 2013AbstractWe report here the first study illustrating the attraction of fabricating solution-processed small molecule field-effect transistors and bulk heterojunction solar cells with semiconductors prepared using new sustainable synthetic procedures which minimize waste per kg of product (E-factor minimization).
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJ) composed of conjugated polymer–fullerene blends currently display power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in the range of 6–9%.1 However, PCE values and processing conditions are strongly affected by polymer batch variations in solubility, molecular weight, polydispersity and purity. These issues are absent with solution-processed small molecule (SM) BHJ solar cells, where the high degree of molecular precision circumvents the statistical variability of polymers. A record PCE of 7% under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) has been recently achieved by Nguyen, Bazan and co-workers2 for SM BHJ solar cells, thus demonstrating that such devices can be competitive with their polymeric counterparts.
In parallel, by combining the advantages of solar cells fabricated from small donor molecules with new eco-friendly synthetic procedures, new opportunities for the production of green energy from green materials may emerge. The synthetic methodologies currently available for organic semiconductors are demanding from both raw materials/chemical costs and environmental points of view, and these aspects may seriously affect their large-scale production. An effective waste-minimized synthetic approach that focuses on reducing the volume of waste generated is therefore highly desirable.3 Waste production should be reduced by using minimal amounts of reagents and by using easily recoverable/recyclable catalytic systems in order to simplify costly purification procedures. Furthermore, the use of green alternative reaction media such as water and solvent-free conditions, as well as new solid catalytic systems, could lead to improved material performance and stability. For many years we have been developing synthetic protocols employing eco-compatible reaction protocols, including the use of water,4 solvent-free conditions (SolFC),5 and supported organocatalysts, 6 proving that significant improvements in both chemical efficiency and process sustainability can be obtained.
In this regard, and in continuation of our efforts7 to understand the interrelationships between molecular structure and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell performance, the present work is devoted to the sustainable synthesis, characterization, and implementation in OFETs/BHJ OPVs of a series of asymmetrically substituted donor arylacetylenes 1–4 (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Chemical structure of compounds 1–4. 
In our design strategy, compounds 1–4 comprise an anthracene core linked to two ethynylene–phenylene units at both 9,10-positions which are peripherally functionalized with electron-releasing and electron-accepting species at the extremities, thus leading to a so-called push–pull architecture.
It is well established that as a consequence of a favorable push–pull effect of donor and acceptor species, efficient intramolecular charge transfer may occur upon excitation, lowering the band gap, which is desirable for OPV light absorption at longer wavelengths.8 It is also known9 that such band gaps can be simply controlled by adjusting the electron donating strength of the donor and the electron withdrawing strength of the acceptor units. In designing compounds 1–4 we also bear in mind that anthracene is a promising candidate for use in the development of organic semiconductor devices as it may combine large carrier mobilities, greater solubility, and improved stability10 as compared to pentacene, which has become a benchmark in the field. Moreover, the anthracene nucleus is a good chromophore unit. Finally, the n-hexyloxy chains at the 3- and 4-positions of the terminal phenyl rings are introduced to enhance the semiconductor solubility as well as to promote their self-organization in the solid state. Indeed, n-hexyloxy chains along the main molecular axis (i.e. at the 4-positions) may also promote enhanced π-stacking, thus improving charge transport properties.11
The optoelectronic properties of these new compounds have been studied by UV–Vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry. The thin film microstructure and morphology has been investigated using X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), and is discussed in relation to molecular structure and device response.
Results and discussion
It is known that a low Environmental factor (E-factor, kg waste per kg product) is one of the most essential contributions to the overall efficiency of a synthetic process.12 The synthesis of donors 1–4 was therefore carried out by means of unconventional Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reactions to reduce the E-factor of these processes, as exemplified in Scheme 1 for compound 1. In all cases, various environmentally-sustainable reaction media and different recoverable heterogeneous palladium sources were considered and the obtained data are reported in Tables S1–S6, ESI.†
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of compound 1: i, trimethylsilylacetylene (1.5 eq), PdEncatTPP30 (2 mol%), CuI (2 mol%), diisopropylamine (1.5 eq), 2-methyl-THF, 18 h, 30 °C, 99%; ii, 10% TBAF/SiO2, 3 h, 30 °C, 96%; iii, 9-iodo-10-bromoanthracene (0.9 eq), PdEncat30 (3 mol%), CuI (1 mol%), diisopropylamine (27 eq), cyclopentyl methyl ether, 18 h, 55 °C, 90%; iv, 3,4-bis(hexyloxy)ethynylbenzene 6 (0.9 eq), PdEncatTPP30 (6 mol%), CuI (4 mol%), diisopropylamine (45 eq), cyclopentyl methyl ether, 20 h, 50 °C, 70%; v, trimethylsilylacetylene (1.5 eq), PdEncatTPP30 (2 mol%), CuI (2 mol%), diisopropylamine (1.5 eq), 2-methyl-THF, 3 h, 30 °C, 99%; vi, 10% TBAF/SiO2, 3 h, 30 °C, 96%. 
The synthesis of compound 1 begins with Sonogashira coupling between 1-nitro-2-hexyloxy-4-iodobenzene 5 and trimethylsilylacetylene. The most efficient result was accomplished in 2-methyl-THF, a reaction medium included in the list of green solvents,13 and by using 2% mol of PdEncatTPP30 in the presence of 2% mol of CuI and 1.5 equiv. of base.
The subsequent desilylation reaction was optimized by using TBAF/SiO2, allowing the desired acetylenic compound 7 to be isolated as a pure product in quantitative yield (Scheme 1, Table S2, entry 11, ESI†). Note that the desilylation step could be carried out by using only 10 mol % of TBAF/SiO2, instead of (over)-stoichiometric amounts of TBAF that are routinely employed. Next, the selective cross-coupling reaction between 9-bromo-10-iodoanthracene and the alkyne 7 in cyclopentyl methyl ether, included in the list of green solvents,13 proceeded in 90% yield when PdEncat30 (3% mol) was used (Scheme 1, Table S3, entry 19, ESI†). Importantly, due to the very low amount of CuI co-catalyst used in this case (1 mol%) essentially no alkyne homocoupling by-product was observed.14 The resulting monocoupling product 8 was then subjected to additional cross-coupling with 3,4-bis(hexyloxy)ethynylbenzene 9 to provide the target compound 1 in yields up to 70% (Scheme 1, Table S4, ESI†). Note that the previously reported synthesis15 of 3,4-bis(hexyloxy)ethynylbenzene 9 has in turn been revisited (Scheme 1, Tables S5 and S6, ESI†), and it was found that the optimal conditions for the Sonogashira cross-coupling involve PdEncatTPP30 as the palladium source (2 mol %), 2% mol of CuI co-catalyst, and 2-methyl-THF as reaction media. The de-silylation reaction was optimized by using 10% TBAF/SiO2. All of the new compounds were characterized by conventional chemical and analytical methods (ESI†).
Note here the importance of using green reaction media such as those selected in our protocols (i.e., 2-methyl-THF and cyclopentyl methyl ether); organic solvents accounting for more than 80% of the waste production of a process. Further, carrying out the chemical reactions by using a recoverable heterogeneous catalysts simplified the purification steps, avoiding in most cases the need for chromatography, and prevent metal contamination of the semiconductor which is known to negatively affect performance. This is particularly evident in comparing our optimized protocols and the conventional ones previously reported,15,16 when available (see ESI†).
Calculation of the E-factors12 confirm that the present approach is very efficient for waste reduction. In our case, the E-factors range from ∼101 to ∼102 and are significantly smaller than those for conventional protocols previously reported,13,16 where an average of ∼5 × 103 was obtained. A reduction of waste by 94.4–99.1% has been achieved for the Sonogashira cross-couplings as well as the alkyne desilylation reactions (when applicable) by adopting the newly reported procedures (see also ESI†).
The redox properties of compounds 1–4 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV, see Fig. S1, ESI†), and the results are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO and LUMO energies of semiconductors 1–4 were estimated from optical absorption and CV data17 using the standard approximation that the Fc/Fc+ HOMO level is −4.8 eV. These data are compiled in Table 1 and show that the HOMO energies of compounds 1–4 are within the required range to ensure an acceptable Voc in a PCBM BHJ device (vide infra). Note also that the LUMO energy for compound 3 lies below those of anthracene derivatives 1, 2 and 4, reflecting the stronger electron-withdrawing character of the ethynylene phenylene fragment 4-substituted by the nitro group.

Optical absorption data for compounds 1–4 in chloroform and as thin films, are summarized in Table 1 and Table S7, ESI.† The solid-state spectrum of 1 was blue-shifted relative to that in solution (Fig. S2, ESI,†Table 1). This result could be explained by H-aggregation of the molecules.18 In contrast, the absorption peaks of the solid-state spectra of compounds 2–4 are ∼50 nm red-shifted relative to the solution spectra,16 which can be attributed to greater structural organization in the solid state and/or formation of J-aggregates.
Bottom-gate top-contact OFETs were fabricated by spin coating semiconductor solutions in CHCl3 (5 mg mL−1)7d on doped Si(gate)/SiO2 (dielectric layer, 300 nm thick) substrates. Vacuum-deposited Au source and drain electrodes completed the FET structure. Device fabrication and characterization details are given in the ESI.† Typical p-type organic semiconductor characteristics are observed for the compounds 1, 3 and 4, whereas semiconductor 2 was not FET active. Representative transfer plots for compounds 1, 3, and 4 are shown in Fig. 2A, and Fig. S3, ESI.† Table S8, ESI† summarizes the FET performance response for optimal devices, including the charge carrier mobility (μ), on-off current ratio (Ion/Ioff), and threshold voltage (VT). Semiconductors 1 and 3 exhibit hole mobilities up to ∼4.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and Ion/Ioff approaching 3 × 104 and 3 × 101, respectively, when measured in vacuum. Film thermal annealing over the range 40–120 °C was found to have a generally detrimental effect both on 1 and 3 FET performance in terms of mobility, whereas the Ion/Ioff for 1 is slightly enhanced.
 Fig. 2  (A) Typical transfer plot for a spin-coated 4 OFET annealed at 80 °C. (B) XRD scans for films of semiconductor 4 spin-coated from chloroform onto bare Si/SiO2 and annealed at 80 °C. 
Semiconductor 4 exhibits the best FET performance, with a hole mobility up to 3.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and Ion/Ioff of 1 × 105, after thermal annealing at 80 °C for 2 h. By further increasing the annealing temperature up to 120 °C, no FET responses are observed, likely due to drastic morphological changes (vide infra).
In order to better understand the effects of the various substituents on the electrical performance of the present arylacetylene derivatives, film microstructure and film morphology were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. S4, ESI† and Fig. 2B show XRD data using standard θ–2θ scan for spin-cast 1–4 films on bare Si/SiO2 substrates. All the semiconductor films are crystalline and exhibit multi-order X-ray reflections.
The diffraction data indicated that 1 films exhibit a single low intensity reflection at 2θ = 3.95° (Fig. S4A, ESI†), corresponding to a d-spacing of 26.8 Å. The estimated molecular or long axis tilt angle φ with respect to the substrate normal, defined by the d-spacing and computed molecular lengths (Table S9, ESI†), is ∼ 36.4°, suggesting predominant edge-on molecular orientation on the substrate surface, with a modest inclination.
We also investigated how film microstructure evolves as a function of annealing at increasing temperatures (40–120 °C). Fig. S4A, ESI† shows that on going from 60 to 120 °C, an extension of visible reflections at lower diffraction angles is observed for arylacetylene 1. Moreover, the major peak shifts towards smaller diffraction angles when the annealing temperature is increased from 80 to 120 °C, whereas its intensity decreases somewhat with the increase in temperature. Further, the 2 film XRD scan (Fig. S4B, ESI†) exhibits a major reflection at 2θ = 6.71° whereas for 3 films reflections at 2θ = 4.67° are observed (Fig. S4C, ESI†), corresponding to a d-spacing of 27.6 Å and 18.9 Å, respectively. Multiple diffraction features at 2θ = 3.2°, 13.43°, 16.79° and 2θ = 9.9°, 14°, respectively, are also observed. The estimated molecular tilt angles of these molecular structures (φ ∼ 34.0° and φ ∼ 46.8°, respectively) were similar to those observed for 1 (Table S3, ESI†). From the XRD data in Fig. S4B and S4C, ESI† it is also clear that in the case of 2 and 3, respectively, on increasing the annealing temperature, thin film crystallinity generally increases, presumably due to a more ordered π–π stacking of the phenyl–ethyne–anthracene–ethyne–phenyl core. Next, the 2θ diffraction angles basically remain unchanged regardless of the investigated annealing temperature. The XRD plot shown in Fig. 2B confirms the high crystallinity of 4 films, which correlates well with the optimal OFET performance (Table S2, ESI†). A primary reflection is observed at 2θ = 2.21 corresponding to a d-spacing of ∼40 A. Additionally, multiple Bragg reflections at 2θ = 4.46°, 6.62°, 9.02°, 11.31°, 13.55°, 15.77° and 18.05° (inset Fig. 2B) are also observed. Note that the experimental d-spacing of semiconductor 4 (∼40 Å) is significantly larger than the semiempirical AM1-calculated molecular length of this molecule (∼27.64 A). This finding correlates well with the typical19 antiparallel self-assembling of push–pull systems (Fig. S5, ESI†).
The AFM images of the 1-derived films on bare SiO2 substrates (SI Fig. S6A, ESI†) indicate that the morphology consists of plate-like grains, which increase in size when annealed up to 60 °C. On the other hand, films of compound 2 (Fig. S6B, ESI†) exhibit a sponge-like surface morphology, the channel width increasing after annealing at 40–60 °C. Thermal annealing over the range 80–120 °C results in extensive film degradation for compound 1, whereas it induces a progressive formation of large clusters in 2-derived films (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). In the case of 3, the AFM images (Fig. S6C, ESI†) reveal large crystal-like features protruding from the thin films. Upon thermal annealing, decreased film continuity is observed with increasing temperature, although the grain sizes increase, which explains the depressed mobility.20 After thermal annealing at 120 °C, well-isolated features are clearly visible (Fig. S9, ESI†). Similar to the case of 3, the surface morphology of as-spun 4 films reveals large features protruding from the films (Fig. S5D, ESI†). AFM characterization of the 4-derived films after thermal annealing (40–120 °C) is reported in Fig. S10, ESI.† Indeed, optimum annealing conditions for such semiconductor are 80 °C/2 h, as evidenced by the structured grains in Fig. S10C, ESI.† This is consistent with the unique XRD pattern observed as well as the FET data (vide supra).
BHJ OPV cells were fabricated by spin-coating from CHCl3, under an ambient atmosphere, a blend of 1, 3 or 4 as the donor and PCBM as acceptor onto cleaned ITO-coated glass anodes modified by first spin coating on a PEDOT:PSS layer as a hole extraction/electron blocking layer. After drying, the cells were then completed by sequential vacuum deposition of LiF and Al as the cathode. The solar cell device performance was optimized by varying both the active layer 1, 3 or 4/PCBM (wt/wt) blend composition, film thickness and annealing temperatures. Table 2 summarizes the results of this screening process. All devices were characterized under standard AM1.5G 1 Sun test conditions using the NREL calibrated instrumentation described previously.21 Device fabrication and characterization details are given in the ESI.† Representative OPV current density–voltage (J–V) plots under illumination for the present devices based on chromophores 1, 3 and 4 are shown in Fig. S11, ESI† and in Fig. 3A.

The low photocurrents (JSC) of 1 and 3/PCBM blended films, accompanied by poor FFs and, in the case of 3, small VOC values, afford modest PCEs up to ∼0.4% for the compound 1. For cells based on 4/PCBM (1:1) a maximum JSC value of 4.45 mA cm−2 was achieved. Combined with good VOC values, and a fill factor (FF) of ∼ 50%, these data yield PCEs up to ∼1.3%. The optimization of the D:A blend ratio for 4/C61-PCBM based device, demonstrates that 1:1 is the best composition; in fact, an increase or decrease of the PCBM content leads to degradation in device performance. Representative AFM images of the resulting morphologies are shown in Fig. S12, ESI.†
The 4/PCBM (1:1) device annealed at 50 °C exhibits a slightly decreased PCE. Despite the slight improvement of the FF value – over 50% – the drop in JSC (from 4.45 to 4.07 mA cm2) limits the efficiency. The improved hole conductivity (higher FF), probably reflecting the good charge carrier mobility (μh ≈ 4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1), can be attributed to 4 self-assembling by thermal treatment. However, a different phase-separation, as suggested by the major change in the thin-film morphology (see representative AFM images in Fig. S13, ESI†), may influence the interfacial areas between the BHJ components, thus limiting the exciton separation efficiency and the resulting photocurrent.
A number of arguments have been presented in the literature to describe the impact of material parameters on device VOC, one of the most widely accepted involving the relation between the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO.22 However, there is also an observed and important relationship between VOC and film morphology23 which may relate to the observed impact of the substitution pattern on the VOC of the solar cells. For instance, when a 1:1 wt/wt ratio with respect to PCBM is used, donor 1 shows a higher VOC than derivatives containing the electron-withdrawing group at the 4-position of the peripheral ethynylene phenylene fragment. The magnitude of this difference (∼0.3 V) is greater than would be estimated from the differences in HOMO energies (on the order of 0.15 eV). Contributing to this phenomenon may be the very different morphology of 3- and 4- vs.1-based films (Fig. S12, ESI†).
The optical absorption spectra of the 1-, 3–4/PCBM blend films were also examined (Fig. S14, ESI†). The enhanced long wavelength absorption by the 4/PCBM blends correlates with higher device efficiencies. Spectral response data for the most efficient of the present OPVs are shown in Fig. 3B. Plots for devices using non-optimal PCBM content are included for comparison. For 4/PCBM 1:2 wt/wt films the EQE maximum is lower (∼28% at 550 nm) than that obtained for devices based on 1:1 wt/wt (∼35% at 440 nm) and 2:1 wt/wt blends (∼31% at 440 nm). Additionally, the 1:1 and 2:1 spectral responses exhibit a broader profiles, which may account for the appreciably high Jsc response of the 1:1 and 2:1 vs. 1:2 device (4.45 and 3.50 vs. 2.27 mA cm−2, respectively).
Conclusions
An effective waste-minimized approach to the synthesis of a new family of soluble extended π-conjugated arylacetylenic optoelectronic materials with a push–pull architecture is reported. Since the organic solvents account for more than 80% of the synthetic waste production, green reaction media were used. Furthermore, the use of recoverable heterogeneous catalysts simplify the process purification steps, avoiding in most cases the need for chromatography. This approach leads to the definition of synthetic methodologies featuring a very good E-factor for each semiconductor. By adopting these newly defined synthetic protocols a 94.4–99.1% waste reduction is demonstrated for the Sonogashira cross-couplings as well as for the alkyne desilylation reactions (when applicable). Field effect transistor measurements demonstrate that arylacetylenes 1, 3 and 4 are p-type semiconductors with a hole carrier mobilities up to ≈ 4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Organic BHJ solar cells using PCBM as electron acceptor were also fabricated with these new extended arylacetylenes. Power conversion efficiencies range from ∼0.1% to ∼1.3%. A direct correlation is identified here between the nature/position of electron-withdrawing groups substituted on the peripheral phenylene fragment and the BHJ device VOC. Furthermore, a particular crystal packing arrangement for arylacetylene 4 (antiparallel self-assembling) consistently yields the best performing OFETs and OPVs. All of the obtained results argue that film morphology/microstructure is a major factor in determining OFET/OPV characteristics.
Although the investigated arylacetylene performances are not sufficient for practical applications, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of combining the advantages of SM-based organic optoelectronic TFT/OPV devices and new sustainable synthetic procedures with minimal waste production per kg of the desired material. This approach may open the route to photovoltaics as a truly viable technology for cost-competitive applications. Further investigation along this line is currently in progress.

(ADS) and was further purified by several cycles of sonication in toluene followed by filtration, and then sonication in pentane, followed by centrifugation. Petroleum ether as the 40–60 °C boiling fraction was used. Electrochemistry was performed on a C3 Cell Stand Electrochemical Station equipped with BAS Epsilon software (Bioanalytical Systems, Inc., Lafayette, IN) in an electrolyte solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4N+PF6−) in dry dichloromethane. Platinum wire electrode was used as working electrode, platinum wire was used as counter electrodes, and a silver wire was used as the pseudo-reference electrode. A ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple was used as an internal standard and the potential values obtained in reference to the silver electrode were converted to the vacuum scale.

Device fabrication and measurements

OFET devices. 
Prime-grade n-doped silicon wafers having 300 nm thermally grown oxide (Process Specialties Inc.) were used as device substrates. Before film deposition, the substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with ethanol and then in an oxygen plasma cleaner for 5 min under vacuum. Films of compounds 1–4 were spin-coated from 0.5% (w/v) CHCl3 solutions and, if annealed, heated under N2 at various temperatures from 40 to 120 °C for 1 h, unless otherwise noted. Spin-coated films were 30–40 nm thick as determined by profilometry (Tencor P10). For FET device fabrication, top contact gold (500 Å) were deposited by evaporating gold (pressure < 10−5 Torr); channel dimensions were 25/50/100 μm (L) by 1.0/2.0/5.0 mm (W). The capacitance of the insulator is 1 × 10−8 F cm−2 for 300 nm SiO2. TFT device measurements were carried out at 21–23 °C in a customized high-vacuum probe station (1 × 10−6 Torr) or in air. Coaxial and/or triaxial shielding was incorporated into Signaton probes to minimize noise levels. TFT characterization was performed with a Keithley 6430 subfemtoamperometer (drain) and Keithley 2400 (gate) source meter, operated by a locally written Labview program and GPIB communication. OFET response parameters were extracted from I–V data using the standard field-effect transistor equation.24 Mobilities (μ) were calculated in the saturation regime by the standard relationship: μsat = (2IDSL)/[WCi(VG − VT)2], where IDS is the source–drain saturation current, Ci is the gate dielectric capacitance (per area), VG is the gate voltage, and VT is the threshold voltage. The latter can be estimated as the intercept of the linear section of the plot of VGvs. (IDS)1/2


OPV devices. 
These devices were fabricated by spin-coating a blend of 1, 3 and 4 + PCBM (D:A wt:wt ratio, D = 1, 2; A = 1, 2), sandwiched between a transparent anode and a cathode. The anode consisted of glass substrates pre-coated with indium-tin-oxide (ITO, Delta Technologies; RS = 8–12 Ω). Before device fabrication, the ITO-coated (150 nm) glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with deionized water + detergent, deionized water, isopropyl alcohol, methanol, and acetone sequentially, and finally in a UV-ozone cleaner for 30 min under ambient atmosphere. A thin layer of PEDOT/PSS (Baytron P) was then spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 1 min (unless otherwise noted) on the anode to modify the ITO surface. After baking at 150 °C for 15 min, the active layer was deposited by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 1 min (unless otherwise noted), the D/A blends under air using a solution concentration of 16 mg ml−1. Dry chloroform was used as solvent. Contact areas were cleaned with dry toluene and a cotton swab. The cathode consisted of LiF (∼0.6 nm, Acros, 99.98%) capped with Al (150 nm, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%). The deposition rates used were 0.1 Å s−1 for LiF and ∼2 Å s−1 for Al, with a chamber pressure of 1.1 × 10−6 Torr. Device characterization was performed at 298 K using a Class A Spectra-Nova Technologies solar cell analyzer having a xenon lamp that simulates AM1.5G light from 400–1100 nm. The instrument was calibrated with a monocrystalline Si diode fitted with a KG3 filter to bring spectral mismatch to unity. The calibration standard was calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Four-point contacts were made to the substrate with Ag paste and copper alligator clips. Individual devices were isolated by a mask during testing to avoid current collection from adjacent devices and edge effects. Power conversion efficiencies were calculated from the following equation: PCE = (JscVocFF)/P0, where Jsc (mA cm−2) is the short circuit current, Voc (V) the open circuit voltage, FF the fill factor, and P0 the power of incident light source (mW cm−2).

Thin-film characterization
Thin films were analyzed by wide angle X-ray film diffractometry (WAXRD) on a Rigaku ATX-G instrument using standard θ–2θ techniques with Cu-Kα1 radiation. Atomic force microscopy was performed on a Jeol 5200 SPM instrument with silicon cantilevers in the tapping mode, using WinSPM Software. Optical absorption spectra were acquired on a Shimadzu 1601 spectrophotometer.
