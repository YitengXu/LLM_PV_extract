    , Accepted 8th September 2021First published on 9th September 2021AbstractThe indirect bandgap of two-dimensional GaN hinders its application in the optical field. Hydrogenation can convert the bandgap type of the GaN monolayer from an indirect to a direct one and also tune the bandgap size. The thermal transport, an important property in the application of two-dimensional materials, is also influenced by hydrogenation. By performing first-principles calculations and solving the phonon Boltzmann equation, we investigate the effect of hydrogenation on the thermal conductivity of the GaN monolayer. The results show that hydrogenation will slightly increase the thermal conductivity of the GaN monolayer from 70.62 Wm−1 K−1 to 76.23 Wm−1 K−1 at 300 K. The little effect of hydrogenation on thermal conductivity is mainly dominated by two competing factors: (1) the reduction of ZA mode lifetime due to the breaking of reflection symmetry after hydrogenation and (2) the increased contribution from TA and LA modes due to the reduction of anharmonic scattering caused by the enlarged phonon bandgap after hydrogenation. The results are compared with other two-dimensional materials with hexagonal monolayer structures.
Introduction
Gallium nitride (GaN) has attracted considerable interest for its wide direct bandgap and high carrier mobility.1–3 Apart from its well-known application in light emitting diodes (LEDs),1 GaN has also been utilized in the fabrication of microwave power transistors,4 solar cells5 and terahertz detectors.6 Motivated by the exploration of two-dimensional (2D) materials, 2D GaN, especially GaN monolayer, has also attracted much attention.7–16 Onen et al.11 systematically investigated three- to two-dimensional GaN and demonstrated that GaN monolayer has a wider bandgap and a totally different optical spectrum, demonstrating its new optoelectronic applications. Nocona et al.10 further demonstrated its promising potential in nonlinear optics, energy-efficient display applications and germicidal and water-purification processes.
While possessing the abovementioned advantages, GaN monolayer has an indirect electronic bandgap, a critical defect that would largely decrease photoelectric conversion efficiency and hinder its further application in optical–electronic devices.17 The indirect bandgap mainly comes from surface dangling bonds resulting from the bond breaking when bulk GaN reduces the dimension to 2D.18–20 Since the polarized covalent bond in GaN plays an important role in inducing dangling bonds at the surface, chemical functionalization provides an effective way to modulate the electronic band by changing the bonding state.21 Recent research has proved that hydrogenation can tune GaN monolayer from indirect to direct band and further enlarge the electronic bandgap.9 The change of bond state by functionalization will also alter the bond strength and then influence the thermal properties.22–30 However, the effect of chemical functionalization on the thermal conductivity is not universal. For example, hydrogenation will largely suppress the thermal conductivity of graphene22,23 and tetrahexcarbon29 while significantly enhancing the thermal conductivity of silicene26 and penta-graphene.25
Previous studies have revealed the anomalously temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and orbital driven low thermal conductivity of GaN monolayer.7,13 But the thermal transport in hydrogenated GaN and the effect of hydrogenation remain unknown. In this work, we systematically investigate the thermal transport in the hydrogenated GaN monolayer using first-principles calculations. By comparing with pristine GaN monolayer, we demonstrate that hydrogenation only slightly increases the thermal conductivity of the GaN monolayer, which is further investigated by mode analysis.
Methods
First-principles calculations are performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) based on density functional theory (DFT).31,32 Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) is used to describe the exchange correlation functional.33 The projector-augmented-wave (PAW) potentials are used for Ga and N where the 3d electrons of Ga are classified as valence electrons. A vacuum of 20 Å is set in the out-of-plane direction to prevent the interaction from neighbouring images. The energy cut-off for the plane wave basis set is 900 eV. The convergence criterion for energy and Hellman–Feynman force are set as 10−8 eV and 10−6 eV Å−1, respectively. A Gamma-centered 15 × 15 × 1 k-mesh is used to sample the Brillouin zone during structural optimization.
The thermal conductivity is calculated iteratively by solving the phonon Boltzmann using the ShengBTE34 code. The harmonic interatomic force constants (IFCs) are calculated with a 5 × 5 × 1 supercell and a 2 × 2 × 1 Γ-centered K-mesh using Phonopy.35 The anharmonic IFCs are calculated with a 5 × 5 × 1 supercell using code package called thirdorder.34 The Born effective charges and dielectric constants are also calculated for the correction of long-range electrostatic interactions within density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). A converged cut-off of 5th nearest neighbours and a q grid of 130 × 130 × 1 are employed after testing. The thickness of the monolayer is chosen as 3.74 Å for both the GaN monolayer and hydrogenated GaN monolayer, which is important in comparing the thermal conductivities of different 2D materials.25,36
Results and discussion
Optimized structures
The optimized structures of the GaN monolayer and hydrogenated GaN monolayer are presented in Fig. 1. The GaN monolayer exhibits a graphene like planar honeycomb hexagonal structure with the space symmetry group of P6m2, which is lower than that of graphene (P6/mmm). The optimized lattice constant is 3.21 Å and the N–Ga bond length is 1.85 Å, which is consistent with previous reports.11,37 The planar hexagonal structure comes from sp2 hybridization due to the dangling bonds when the bulk GaN changes to monolayer one. Hydrogenation saturates the missing bonds and restores the 4-coordinated state as in the bulk GaN. After hydrogenation, the space symmetry degenerates to P3m1. The hydrogenated GaN monolayer shows a bulk-like structure with a buckling height of 0.72 Å. The lattice constants slightly decrease to 3.207 Å, while the N–Ga bond is elongated to 1.98 Å.

As an accepted rule of thumb, thermal conductivity is closely related to crystal structure. A complex crystal structure (low space group symmetry) and a weak interatomic bonding strength always lead to a lower thermal conductivity. The impact of hydrogenation on thermal conductivity is discussed in the following.
We calculate the thermal conductivities of pristine and hydrogenated GaN monolayers at 300 K. The total and relative contributions from different phonon modes are shown in Fig. 2(a). At 300 K, the thermal conductivities of pristine and hydrogenated GaN monolayers are 70.62 Wm−1 K−1 and 76.23 Wm−1 K−1, respectively. As mentioned above, a more complex crystal structure usually leads to a lower thermal conductivity. For example, it has been reported that symmetry breaking would lead to a planar to bulked structural transition for graphene due to hydrogenation, causing a rapid drop of thermal conductivity from 3590 Wm−1 K−1 to 1328 Wm−1 K−1.22 The slightly increased thermal conductivity of the hydrogenated GaN monolayer is intriguing here.
 Fig. 2  (a) Thermal conductivity and relative contributions from different phonon modes of pristine and hydrogenated GaN monolayers; (b) cumulative thermal conductivity as a function of frequency. 
To figure out the reasons for the slight increase of thermal conductivity, we perform a detailed mode analysis. Firstly, we decompose the total thermal conductivity into contributions from different phonon modes as shown in Fig. 2(a). For both pristine and hydrogenated GaN monolayers, the main contributions come from acoustic phonon branches, whereas the optical branches only contribute 3.04% and 3.15%, respectively. For the pristine GaN monolayer, the ZA (out-of-plane flexural acoustic) mode dominates the thermal conductivity with a contribution of 66.46%. TA (transverse acoustic) and LA (longitudinal acoustic) modes contribute 24.22% and 6.28%, respectively. While hydrogenation has little effect on the apparent thermal conductivity of the GaN monolayer, it significantly changes the phonon mode contributions. The contributions from different acoustic branch modes are 35.79%, 30.15% and 31.42% for ZA, TA and LA, respectively, after hydrogenation. The absolute contribution of ZA modes drops by 20.05 Wm−1 K−1, while the absolute contributions of LA and TA modes increase by 19.55 Wm−1 K−1 and 5.89 Wm−1 K−1, respectively, after hydrogenation. The increased contributions of the TA and LA modes compensate for the decreased contribution from the ZA mode and eventually cause a slight increase of the total thermal conductivity.
The different phonon mode contributions to the total thermal conductivity can also be illustrated from the cumulative thermal conductivity dependence on frequency in Fig. 2(b). For both pristine and hydrogenated GaN monolayers, the main contributions come from the low phonon frequency under 10 THz. For the pristine GaN, the thermal conductivity from the low frequency is especially significant. The cumulative thermal conductivity is already 23 Wm−1 K−1 at 0.3 THz for pristine GaN, while it is only 2.5 Wm−1 K−1 at 1 THz for hydrogenated GaN.
Phonon dispersion and group velocity
By solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (PBTE), the thermal conductivity of a crystal can be expressed as  where λ denotes a phonon mode, cλ denotes the phonon specific heat, υλ denotes the phonon group velocity and τλ denotes the phonon lifetime. The phonon specific heat values for the pristine and hydrogenated GaN are 1.83 × 10−6 J m−3 K−1 and 2.65 × 10−6 J m−3 K−1, respectively. Phonon group velocity that can be derived from the harmonic term of crystal potential energy is related to harmonic properties. Furthermore, the phonon lifetime derived from anharmonic terms is denoted as an anharmonic property.38 Phonon dispersions are shown in Fig. 3(a and b) for pristine and hydrogenated GaN monolayers, respectively. Here, the Born effect charges and dielectric constants are calculated to consider the long-range Coulomb interactions, which are drawn in blue. As shown in Fig. 3(a), long-range interactions mainly affect the high frequency LO modes that are less important to thermal conductivity at room temperature. Both the dispersion curves have no imaginary frequency, indicating the thermal dynamic stability of the materials. It is worthwhile to note that, when approaching the Γ points, the ZA modes of both hydrogenated and pristine GaN are quadratic, which is consistent with the prediction of 2D continuum elasticity theory.39 This further demonstrates the accuracy of our results.

From the comparison of Fig. 3(a and b), hydrogenation changes the phonon frequency distribution significantly. On one hand, hydrogenation suppresses the energy of acoustic phonons as the highest frequency of LA mode dropped from 10 THz to 5 THz, causing a flatter and more localized phonon dispersion. The localized frequency will produce a considerable impact on the phonon group velocity. On the other hand, hydrogenation elevates the frequency of the ZO mode above the acoustic-optical gap, which suppresses the scattering involving the ZO mode (such as ZA + ZA → ZO, ZA + TA → ZO, ZA + LA → ZO…). The phonon densities of states (PDOS) are illustrated next to the phonon dispersion in Fig. 3(a and b). For the pristine GaN monolayer, both N and Ga atoms show considerable contributions at a lower phonon frequency (<10 THz). For the hydrogenated GaN monolayer, the PDOS at a lower phonon frequency (<5 THz) is mainly contributed by the Ga atoms, while the N atoms contribute relatively less. The introduction of H atoms mainly manifests in the PDOS at high frequency indicating that H itself do not contribute directly to thermal conductivity a lot. However, it affects the structure of the GaN monolayer and the influence on the thermal transport is due to the change of the structure after hydrogenation.
The group velocities of acoustic phonon branches and optical branches are presented in Fig. 3(c and d). With the suppression of energy at low frequencies, the group velocities of the three acoustic phonon branches decrease largely. The maximum group velocities of the hydrogenated GaN monolayer are 2.51 km s−1 (ZA), 4.16 km s−1 (TA) and 6.70 km s−1 (LA), which are lower than those of pristine GaN (3.03 km s−1 (ZA), 5.78 km s−1 (TA) and 8.48 km s−1), respectively. The decline of the group velocity has a negative effect on the thermal conductivity and it is hard to give an explanation for the increased contribution of LA modes. To this end, we further calculate the anharmonic properties related to the variation of mode contribution as discussed below.
Anharmonic properties
The relationships between phonon lifetime and phonon frequency are shown in Fig. 4(a and d). For the pristine GaN monolayer, the ZA mode has the longest phonon lifetime, about one order of magnitude larger than that of the TA mode. This is consistent with the largest contribution of the ZA mode to thermal conductivity. LA modes have the shortest phonon lifetime compared with ZA and LA modes, corresponding to the weak contribution to thermal conductivity as shown in Fig. 1(a). For the hydrogenated GaN monolayer, the phonon lifetime of the LA mode increases sharply by about two orders of magnitude, which is even larger than that of the ZA mode. The phonon lifetime of the TA mode also increases obviously, especially at low frequencies under 5 THz. The increased phonon lifetime of the LA mode clearly explains its increasing contribution to thermal conductivity. Moreover, the phonon lifetimes of the three different acoustic phonon branches are almost equal, corresponding to a more even contribution to the thermal conductivity from the acoustic phonon modes. Such a consistency between phonon lifetime and mode contribution to the thermal conductivity indicates that phonon lifetime is the determining factor affecting the thermal conductivity of pristine and hydrogenated GaN monolayers.
 Fig. 4  Phonon lifetime (a and d), Grüneisen parameter (b and e) and phonon phase space (c and f) for pristine (upper panel) and hydrogenated (lower panel) GaN monolayers. 
It is well known that phonon lifetime mainly depends on two factors. One is the anharmonicity of each scattering channel, and the other is the number of scattering channels.27 The anharmonicity of scattering channels can be characterized by the Grüneisen parameter γ, which is defined as  
where A is the area of the unit cell and ω is the mode dependent phonon frequency. A larger Grüneisen parameter usually means stronger anharmonicity and a lower thermal conductivity. The increase of the phonon lifetimes of TA and LA modes can be explained by the decreased phonon anharmonicity as shown in Fig. 4(b and e). At 5–10 THz, the Grüneisen parameters of LA and TA modes drop obviously, indicating the decreased phonon anharmonicity of LA and TA modes.
We further calculate the phonon phase space (P3) which can characterize the number of scattering channels, as shown in Fig. 4(c and f). It is obvious that hydrogenation largely suppresses the P3 of the GaN monolayer. The P3 values of the three acoustic phonon modes decrease by about one magnitude.

Fig. 5 shows three phonon scattering rates before and after hydrogenation of monolayer GaN. The scattering rates of TA and LA modes decrease significantly, which is consistent with the decreasing phonon phase space and stronger anharmonicity. This can be understood from the phonon dispersion. After hydrogenation, the ZO mode is lifted, reducing the three-phonon scattering channels involving LA, TA and ZO modes. What is abnormal is that the scattering rate of the ZA mode increases greatly after hydrogenation. Comparing Fig. 4(c and f), the possible scattering channels for ZA decrease after hydrogenation. The reason for the increasing scattering rate after hydrogenation is that the buckling structure after hydrogenation breaks the inversion symmetry along the z direction.40 The protected three-phonon scattering involving odd numbers of ZA modes for the pristine GaN monolayer is no longer forbidden, causing more ZA modes to participate in three-phonon scattering and resulting in an even shorter lifetime compared with that of the pristine GaN monolayer.
 Fig. 5  Three phonon scattering rates of the pristine (a) and hydrogenated (b) GaN monolayers. 
From the above analysis we can see that the main reason causing the change of thermal conductivity after hydrogenation is the structural transformation. We investigated the relationship of structure and phonon dispersion on two-dimensional hexagonal monolayer materials. The monolayers of BAs,41 BP,41 SiC,42,43 BN,44 and graphene45,46 have planar hexagonal structures and their corresponding phonon dispersions show overlaps of the ZO mode with the acoustic modes as shown in Fig. 3(a). After hydrogenation (the same hydrogenated style as discussed in our paper), all the planar structures become buckling, resulting in a lifted ZO mode as shown in Fig. 3(b). At the Γ point, the ZO mode corresponds to opposite vibration of two neighbour atoms. After hydrogenation, these vibration modes become harder to be excited. The existence of an acoustic-optical gap reduces the three-phonon scattering involving LA, TA and ZO modes, resulting in an increase of thermal conductivity. However, the buckling structures also broke the inversion symmetry which increases the three-phonon scattering rate involving an odd number of ZA modes. The structure and phonon dispersion show similar relationships of the two-dimensional hexagonal monolayers before and after hydrogenation; however, the thermal conductivities do not display the same trend since there are at least two competing factors.
Conclusion
By performing first principles calculations and solving the PBTE, we systematically investigate the thermal conductivity and phonon transport of hydrogenated and pristine GaN monolayers in detail. Hydrogenation would slightly increase the thermal conductivity of the GaN monolayer, which could be attributed to the coupling effect of decreased ZA mode's contribution and increased LA and TA modes’ contributions. The anharmonic properties dominate the thermal conductivity. The phonon lifetime decreases for the ZA mode due to the symmetry breaking after hydrogenation. The increased contributions of LA and TA modes can be attributed to the increase of phonon lifetime due to the decreasing scattering channels after hydrogenation. The relationship between the structure and phonon dispersion of other two-dimensional hexagonal monolayer materials shows a similar trend: the ZO mode overlapping with acoustic modes for a planar hexagonal structure and an acoustic-optical gap arising for the buckling structure after hydrogenation.
