    , Accepted 28th February 2013First published on 28th February 2013AbstractHydrogen production from solar power energy is an important energy and environmental issue. Silicon (Si) has been widely studied as a photocathode for hydrogen production from water splitting. In this study, the electrochemical behavior of a Si photocathode for water splitting is highly dependent on its nanostructure. The optimum nanostructure of a Si photocathode exhibits an enhanced photocurrent and a lower overpotential compared to the planar bulk Si. The limiting current density of nanostructured Si is 1.58 times greater than that of the planar structure for p-type Si/aqueous electrolyte solution. Nanostructured Si without any catalyst notably produced a current density of −10.65 mA cm−2 under Air Mass 1.5 Global conditions with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at the reversible potential vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, which is about 43 times higher than that of the untreated Si structure. The solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of the optimized Si nanowire without depositing any catalyst has reached up to about 70% of the efficiency of planar Si decorated with Pt. This significant enhancement achieved in this study emphasizes the importance of a controlled nanostructure in the development of highly efficient photoelectrochemical devices for hydrogen production.
1 Introduction
The development of efficient and cheap photoelectrodes for water splitting is one of the fundamental challenges in hydrogen production.1–3 Despite the fascinating advances in controlling the nanostructure interface and advances in the discoveries of material compositions,4,5 kinetic issues regarding the high overpotential are still one of the most difficult issues that need to be solved. Here, we demonstrate that controlling the nanostructure can make another significant contribution to lowering the overpotential. In the present work, the 250 mV decrease in overpotential by the silicon (Si) nanostructuring is close to the lowering effect achievable by the well-known platinum (Pt) catalysts. Furthermore, the current density at reversible potential vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is about 43-fold enhanced compared to the planar Si substrate.
Considering the thermodynamic potential, a single component semiconductor that possesses a higher band gap than 1.23 V can generate hydrogen and oxygen gas from water simultaneously as long as its conduction and valence bands are in their proper positions.6,7 Successful examples include Ti, Nb, and Ta based compounds, oxynitride, oxysulfide, and sulfide photocatalysts.8,9 However, overall water splitting by one single component semiconductor is usually limited by the kinetic overpotential.10 Therefore, only half of the reaction such as water oxidation or proton reduction reaction occurs instead of both side evolutions. This leaves the other half of the reaction to be possible with the use of sacrificial reagents for reduction, and silver or sulfide ions for oxidation.8 However, the maximum solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency still does not exceed the range of 5%.8 Because of such inherent weakness of one-component-approaches, many developments have been made in photoelectrochemical cells that have a cathode and an anode separately, and they are easily implementable in terms of tunability and efficiency. The detailed advances have been well presented in recent comprehensive reviews.11 Among the many issues in photoelectrochemical hydrogen production, one of the most fundamental questions concerns the effect of nanostructuring in photoelectrodes. In an effort to address such a challenge, we precisely controlled the nanostructure of single crystal Si and studied its photoelectrochemical behaviors.
Si is one of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust. In addition, its compatibility with already developed processes and its precise controllability make Si a propitious element for the development of water splitting platforms.12 Both the reduction in reflection and the increment in the absorption of solar energy can be achieved through surface engineering. With doping control and band tuning, Si can be used both as a photocathode and a photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting.13,14 However, the formation of native oxide on an Si surface lowers its photoelectrochemical performance and Si is not stable at oxidative potentials in an aqueous electrolyte.15 Moreover, the small band bending between the valence band edge and the redox level of electrolyte limits its photovoltaic performance compared to the Si/non-aqueous solvent system.16 Therefore, under visible light irradiation, the application of an external potential is needed and the use of catalysts seems to be necessary for an efficient operation.
The deposition of catalysts on the electrode can enhance the photoelectrochemical performance. Examples include pure metals (Pt, Pd, Ni, etc.),16 metal composites/alloys (Ni–Mo, Ni–Co, Ni–Mo–Cd, etc.),17 compounds such as nonmetallic elements (RuO2, SrxNbO3, Mo3S4, etc.),8,18,19 and molecular catalysts.20 For example, Pt nanoparticles can enhance the onset potential by about 0.42 V for p-type Si nanowire/aqueous electrolyte solution.21 To overcome the economical issues, nonprecious metal catalysts and catalysts that are abundant in nature such as Mo3S4, Ni, Mo, and Ni–Mo have been interfaced with Si pillar structures which exhibit a high current density at a reversible potential vs. RHE.13,17 However, when deposited with catalysts, the saturation current density significantly decreases due to the light scattering by catalysts on the Si surface.
Controlling the structure of Si represents another important direction for improving the photoelectrochemical property. A porous structure can enhance the current density of the Si photoelectrode through the increase of effective reaction sites between the Si semiconductor and the liquid electrolyte junction.22 A nanowire or pillared structure can increase the efficiency due to the orthogonalization of the direction of incident light absorption and charge carrier collection.23 However, it has also been reported that the increase of the junction area between the Si semiconductor/liquid electrolyte decreases the onset potential which results in a lower efficiency of cell performance.24 Thus, it is not clear which nanostructure of the Si photocathode is most efficient for the hydrogen evolution.
Recent experimental results suggest that nanostructuring enhances the photoelectrochemical performance, but still there is a gap between theoretical understanding and actual observation.22,24 Additionally, an inconsistency exists among the presented data about how much and why overpotential and current change. The fundamental question is whether the nanostructuring of photoelectrodes truly generates positive effects or not. To address this ongoing challenge, we studied the photoelectrochemical responses from various nanostructured Si photocathodes that were controlled by metal-catalyzed electroless etching.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Si nanostructure fabrication
Boron-doped (p-type) single crystal Si wafers (4 inch diameter, 500 μm thickness, normal doped with 10–15 Ω cm resistivity, (100) oriented) were purchased from Namkang Co. Ltd. AgNO3 powder (99.5%) and HF (48–51 wt%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and concentrated nitric acid solution (70 wt%) was purchased from Daejung Chemical. After being cut into 8 × 8 mm2 pieces, each of the Si pieces was cleaned in acetone, 2-propanol and deionized water for 10 min respectively by sonication. Each of the Si nanostructures was fabricated by the metal-catalyzed electroless etching method25 in 20 mL aqueous solution of AgNO3 (0.679 g, 0.02 M) and HF (5 M) with etching times of 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, 140 min, 160 min, 180 min, 200 min, 300 min and 480 min. Excess Ag residues that could be contaminated during the electroless etching were completely washed with 70% nitric acid solution for two hours.
2.2 Scanning electron microscope analysis
The surface morphology and wire length of nanostructured Si were analyzed by Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using a SUPRA 55VP model from Carl Zeiss. For a cross-sectional view, samples were carefully cut into two pieces with a diamond cutter. In order to avoid surface charging, Pt was coated by the sputtering method for 200 s (about 10 nm thickness) using the BAL-TEC/SCD 005 model prior to the SEM analysis.
2.3 Reflectance and transmittance measurement
The optical reflectance and transmittance of the Si surface were analyzed with a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Cary 5000, Agilent Technology) using diffuse reflectance mode and specular reflectance mode. The full scan range was 380 to 2300 nm and the scan rate was 600 nm min−1. For comparison, the reflectance and transmittance of the planar Si and the Si nanowire sample were measured, respectively.
2.4 Electrode preparation
In order to establish an ohmic contact between copper wire and the unpolished side (back side) of Si, a gallium–indium eutectic alloy (Kojundo Chemical) was incorporated followed by a silver paste. The epoxy (Loctite Hysol 9460) was used to insulate and protect the back contact of Si except for the intended illumination area (0.25 cm2) of the Si front side. The exposed area, however, is not always 0.25 cm2. We took an optical image of each sample and measured the exact area carefully with a scanner (EPSON STYLUS TX203) and Photoshop (PS5 series) for a detailed calibration. Pt was deposited on the planar or nanostructured Si surface by dropping 1 mM H2PtCl6 (aq.) in 0.5 M HF for 2 min.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical cell measurement
Prior to the photocurrent measurement, native oxide on the Si surface was removed with 5 M HF. A 300 W Xe lamp (Oriel) with a water filter was used as a light source using an Air Mass 1.5 G glass filter (Newport Co., #81094 model). During the photocurrent measurement, the light intensity was carefully maintained at 100 mW cm−2. We carefully measured the light intensity using an optical power meter (Newport, Model 1916-R). For further reliability, we reported the photoelectrochemical performance of the planar Si structure as a function of light intensity from 100 mW cm−2 to 216 mW cm−2 as shown in Fig. S3.†
To minimize the sticking of hydrogen bubbles on the planar Si surface, violent stirring of the electrolyte was performed during the measurement, but no additional surfactant was introduced. Because the harsh stirring can remove the bubbles effectively, the amount of bubbles on the planar and the nanostructured Si is the same according to the optical imaging as shown in Fig. S7.† Therefore, we think that the current difference originates from the structuring effects. We also monitored the change of current density depending on time and concluded that the bubble evolution does not affect the current density. We also want to point out that the average values of limiting current densities were compared to minimize the artifact by choppiness in current.
The photocurrent measurement was conducted in a three electrode cell system which consists of a Si electrode as a working electrode, Pt foil as a counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl/3 M NaCl electrode as a reference electrode. Pt foil (2 × 2 cm2 of area, 0.1 mm of thickness, 99.997% purity) was purchased from Alfa Aesar, a Johnson Matthey Company. An Ag/AgCl/3 M NaCl reference electrode was purchased from BASi (Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.) and was carefully calibrated to a Pt/H2/H+ standard electrode. The potential of the Ag/AgCl/3 M NaCl reference electrode with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode is +0.209 V at 25 °C and is converted to RHE under pH 0 conditions because the electrolyte was an aqueous 1 M perchloric acid solution (pH 0) purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Since the potential difference between Ag/AgCl and RHE is dependent on electrolyte pH, temperature, and so on, the potential was carefully measured before each set of measurements. The potential was converted to RHE by using E (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.209 V at pH 0. We did not observe any change and shift of the cyclic voltammetry curve during 4 cycles. The potential of the Si electrode was controlled using a potentiostat (CHI600D, CH Instrument) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. We varied scan rates with 1 mV, 10 mV, 20 mV, 50 mV, and 100 mV (not shown here) and confirmed that there is no obvious difference when applying different scan rates.
3 Results and discussion
Various nanostructures of boron doped p-type (100) Si substrates were fabricated by the metal assisted chemical etching process.25 Briefly summarizing, normal doped Si substrates were immersed in aqueous solution of 0.02 M silver nitrate (AgNO3) and 5 M hydrofluoric acid (HF). Continuous Si oxidation by the galvanic reduction of Ag ions and following dissolution of Si oxide by HF resulted in directional etching of Si substrates. Depending on the etching time, different Si nanostructures were observed as characterized by SEM. The variation of etching time was set at 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, 140 min, 160 min, 180 min, 200 min, 300 min, and 480 min. Full images of all datasets are shown in ESI Fig. S1† and representative images are selected for Fig. 1. When the etching time was shorter than 120 min, a porous nanostructure was observed as shown in Fig. 1a. A transition from the porous to nanowire structure occurred when the etching time was 120 min. Both the porous structure and the nanowire structure co-existed at 120 min of etching as shown in Fig. 1b. After this stage, it was observed that the length of the nanowires increased as the etching time got longer, as shown in Fig. 1c and d.

(a–d) SEM images of cross-sectional views of p-type (100) Si wafers etched in 5 M HF and 0.02 M AgNO3 solution at different etching times and (e) the formation kinetics of the Si nanowire made by the metal-catalyzed electroless method. The etching times are (a) 30 min, (b) 120 min, (c) 300 min, and (d) 480 min. 
To control the Si nanostructure by metal-catalyzed electroless etching, the formation mechanism was investigated. The length of the nanowire was plotted in the variation of the etching time (Fig. 1e). The increasing rate of nanowire length is relatively low at the beginning stage of etching time and grows rapidly between 120 min and 300 min. After 300 min of etching, the growth rate saturated. To understand the observed s-shaped kinetics, we compared the result with the formation kinetics in Si nanowires explained by K. Q. Peng et al., who pioneered the metal-catalyzed electroless etching method.25 The overall shape looks similar to the conventional nucleation and growth model that can be fit by the Avrami equation.26 To understand the slow reaction at the beginning stage, we monitored how the etching of Ag particles started on Si substrate using SEM. From many samples, linear or crooked traces were observed as shown in Fig. S2a.† These phenomena seem to be the results of initial etching where Ag particles started to form. These etched tracks may suggest evidence of Ag particles' movements. Initially, the high driving force of the galvanic reaction caused the nucleation of many small Ag particles followed by the growth on Si and then the Ag particles diffused on the surface before the vertical penetration. The crooked traces are direct evidence of lateral movements of Ag particles (Fig. S2a†). It is likely that after a certain incubation time, the Si surface starts to make porous structures. As the etching time increases, a pit which is generated by Ag particles grows deeper and wider by the etching of the pore wall. The remaining parts except for the etched pores on the Si surface begin to transform porous structures into nanowire structures, as shown in Fig. 1b. At the middle stage, the nanowire length increases much faster than at the early stage of reaction. After 300 min of etching time, however, the increasing rate of nanowire length decreases due to the large quantity of Ag residue on the Si surface. Presumably, a large amount of Ag residue interrupts further galvanic displacement reaction because it is difficult for Ag+ ions to transport to the bottom of the pit. This is supported by the fact that 5 μm of Si nanowire usually forms about eightfold thicker than the Ag residues on the Si surface.25 Another possibility is that excess Ag residue film prevents a flow of HF solution into the Si surface. Thus, understanding the behaviors of the Ag nanoparticles is a key to interpreting the sigmoidal formation kinetics.
The photoelectrochemical performance of Si electrodes for hydrogen evolution is strongly dependent on their nanostructures. Visible light from a 300 W Xe lamp was illuminated onto the substrate with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 using an Air Mass 1.5 Global condition glass filter. To evaluate the photo-cathodic behavior, the current density (J) was measured as the potential (E) was swept from 0.4 V to −1.0 V with 4 cycles for statistical reliability and long-term stability as shown in Fig. 2. For comparison, the photoelectrochemical performance of the Si structure was also measured as a function of light intensity as shown in Fig. S3.† As the potential of the Si working electrode was negatively applied, the magnitude of the current density increased and saturated at the specific value of the applied potential, called a limiting current density or a saturation current density. Moreover, the planar Si surface shows a spiky plot at a highly negative potential because hydrogen bubbles stick to hydrophobic surfaces until sudden bursts occur. The photoelectrochemical behavior observed here with nanostructured Si also follows a typical pattern for a normal doped p-type Si electrode. Fig. 2b shows dark current densities of representative Si electrodes. The dark current density of the nanostructured electrodes increases compared to the planar Si. As shown in Fig. 2c, the average limiting current density of the planar Si is about −34.1 mA cm−2 and keeps increasing until the length of the nanowire reaches 1.5 μm as the surface becomes more nanostructured. The nanostructured Si has an increased surface area compared to the planar structure. The reflectance of the illumination can be reduced in the nanostructured Si surface. While the surface of planar Si reflects about a quarter of the incident light,22 photon absorption increases in the nanostructured surface due to low reflectance. It is reported that the nanostructure has the effect of light trapping.27,28 The trapped light can enhance the current level for hydrogen production when the length of the Si wire is optimized with a strong broadband optical absorption.29 The nanowire structure also has the advantage of orthogonalization of the light absorption and the charge-carrier collection. Thus, the minority carrier generated by the incident light can move to the lateral side of each nanowire and participate in hydrogen generation more quickly than the planar structure does.

The black squares indicate the limiting current density and the red circles indicate the current density at reversible potential (0 V) vs. RHE. 
More striking is the fact that the current density of nanoporous Si is 54.1 mA cm−2 and the current level of the nanoporous structure is 1.58 times higher than that of the planar structure. The fabrication methods of Si wire by other groups are slightly different from our group. Si wire made by the vapor–liquid–solid growth method was in the ratio of 1.4 and the nanoporous Si made by gold assisted electroless etching was in the ratio of 1.2.13,22 According to the ASTM International standard G173-03, however, 1 sun (Air Mass 1.5 Global condition) of solar irradiation provides 2.7 × 1017 photons per cm2.30 This means that a single crystal Si solar cell with ∼1.1 eV of band gap energy cannot exceed the theoretical maximum 43.6 mA cm−2 assuming that all absorbed photons are converted into electron–hole charge carries.31 In our experiment, the observed current density of 54.1 mA cm−2 is much larger than the theoretical upper limit of current density. In addition to the effect of increased effective area and the reduced reflectance of the incident light, the increased current density might be attributed to IR absorption by light trapping associated with the surface states on the nanowire or sub-band gap absorption by production of impurity states.29,32 In order to study this effect, we recorded the absorption spectrum of the planar surface and the nanostructured surface of Si using UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopy. We minimized the effect of scattering loss on the surface using both diffuse reflectance mode and specular reflectance mode. In the case of the diffuse reflectance mode, we could measure the reflectance of the nanostructured Si exactly by using the integrated sphere. In the case of the specular reflectance mode, the reflectance of the planar Si could be measured more exactly as shown in Fig. S4.†Fig. 3a shows the summation of specular reflectance and diffuse reflectance mode from Fig. S4.† As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the reflectance and transmittance of both Si increase sharply near 1010 nm. Nanostructured Si has about 4% higher reflectance and about 20% lower transmittance than those of planar Si in the IR region. Using the simple relation that absorbance equals 1 − reflectance − transmittance, absorbance is plotted as shown in Fig. 3c. In the nanostructured Si, about 20% of absorption in the range of about 1200 nm to 2300 nm is observed. The additional IR absorption of incident light might produce the increased current density compared to the current density of the planar bulk Si. In order to compare the band gap energy of both structures, we plotted the absorption spectrum as a function of band gap energy using the following model equation:33 (1)where α is the absorption coefficient, h is Planck's constant, v is the frequency, and Eg is the band gap energy. This simplified equation gives information that the band gap energy is the intercept of the straight lines with the x-axis of the plot of (αhv)1/2 as a function of energy (hv). To derive α from a measured absorbance, we compared four absorption spectrum models32,34,35 as shown in Fig. S5† and selected the most accurate model among absorption models. The model equation is as follows:35 (2)where R is the reflectance, T is the transmittance, and d is the optical path length. Using this model equation, we plotted (αhv)1/2 as a function of energy (hv) and confirmed that Si nanowire absorbs incident light more than that of planar Si below band gap absorption as shown in Fig. 3d (full spectral range is shown in Fig. S5d†). The increased absorption shows the sub-bandgap photon absorption mediated by defect states of nanostructured Si even though it is extremely difficult to separate and collect the photocarriers which are excited by sub-bandgap photons before they recombine.29 To clarify the sub-bandgap photon absorption, multiple analysis tools can be applied. For example, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to characterize charge trapping defect states.36 X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy can be used to measure the chemical state of each atom in silicon.37 The exact mechanism of the photocarrier excited by the sub-bandgap photon is still under study.

(d) Plot of (αhv)1/2vs. hv for planar Si and Si nanowires. Other model calculations are listed in the ESI.† The black line indicates the planar Si and the red line indicates the Si nanowire. 
As shown in Fig. 2c, however, the limiting current density decreases as the length of Si nanowire increases after hitting the highest current level at 1.5 μm in nanowire length. The limiting current densities of the 7.1–38.0 μm Si nanowire are lower than the untreated Si. A possible explanation for the decrease is that long nanowires have some Si surface traps or defect sites. Another possibility is the increase of charge carrier recombination as the nanowire becomes longer. As pointed out by J. M. Foley et al. recently, a longer nanowire possesses an enlarged depletion region that gives more chance of recombination.38 The long nanowire provides a high probability of carrier recombination due to the enlarged depletion region. However, the quantitative analysis of the recombination and defects is difficult to achieve in the current manuscript. It is still an ongoing challenge to understand the recombination mechanism and defect density in nanostructured silicon. A recent study by J. Oh et al. has shown that there are two competing charge recombination processes (surface recombination and Auger recombination) in nanostructured silicon solar cells.39 J. Oh et al. have quantitatively shown that Auger recombination limits the photogenerated charge collection and cell efficiency of nanostructured Si solar cells and suggested that Auger recombination can be suppressed by controlling light and shallow doping and tuning the surface area. We are still investigating how to decouple the contribution of each parameter based on J. Oh's work. To sum up, in Si nanowire photocathodes, positive effects such as increased surfaced area, light trapping, reduced light reflection, and orthogonalization of light and carrier collection seem to compete with the negative effects such as the increased surface defects, the enlarged depletion region, and charge recombination processes.
We have also investigated how the overpotential is modified by nanostructuring. A nanostructure makes a positive shift of the overall polarization curve as shown in Fig. 2a. Like the behavior of limiting current density depending on the nanowire length, there is an optimum condition where the degree of shift is at its maximum level. Interestingly, these conditions are different from the point where the maximum saturation current point was observed. When the length of the nanowire is 29.3 μm, the shift to the positive potential is the largest. Fig. 2a clearly shows that the applied voltage required for −10 mA cm−2 shifts from −0.40 V to 0.02 V in the case of the 29.3 μm nanowire. To measure the overpotential for the photoelectrochemical cell quantitatively, we introduced the onset potential (Vos) which is defined as a voltage where the photocurrent density exceeds the dark current density. It is also called a photovoltage. Considering the charge-carrier generation, recombination, and the transport throughout a semiconductor, a simplified model equation for the onset potential at a semiconductor/electrolyte junction is as follows:40 (3)where Nc is the density of states in the conduction band, Jph is the photocurrent density by illumination, LN is the minority carrier diffusion length, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the charge of an electron, DN is the diffusion coefficient of electron, qVp is the difference between the Fermi level energy and the valence band energy of Si, and J0 is the saturation current density. The onset potential for nanostructured electrodes is between 0.23 V and 0.38 V compared to the current density of 0.13 V for planar Si, which is shown in Table 1. Full datasets are shown in ESI Table S1† and representative data are selected for Table 1. Previously, the increase of the overpotential has been observed by others in search of ways to develop Si nanostructures.24 In contrast, the decrease of the overpotential has been reported recently.21,22 These contradicting performances of Si nanostructures may seem to be elusive. The previous reports have shown either an increase or a decrease of the overpotential. Therefore, our demonstration could provide helpful information to understand how the structures affect the shift of the overpotential. The theoretical studies by H. Atwater and N. Lewis can explain very well the decrease of the onset potential in Si nanostructure.11 By introducing the roughness factor, the onset potential equation can be modified as follows:24 (4)where γ is the roughness factor, i.e. the ratio of the actual junction area to the surface of the Si working electrode. The flux of charge carriers in the electrode is constant at the fixed light intensity (Jph), but the flux of minority carriers through the electrode/electrolyte junction (J0) depends on the junction area. The minority carrier flux through the junction decreases proportionally to the increase of the junction area. The large junction area in the nanostructured electrode results in decreases of the flux of minority carriers through the junction from J0 to J0/γ. Thus, the decrease of minority carrier flux lowers the quasi-Fermi level splitting which determines the onset potential. According to eqn (4), about a 10-fold increase of γ can reduce the onset potential by 60 mV. The onset potential, however, increases in both the nanoporous and nanowire structures in our experiment. Recently, J. Oh et al. proposed that the surface area and the increased reaction sites can lower the overpotential.22 I. Oh et al. also observed the shift of the J–E curve in the case of Si nanowires.21 From our many repeated experiments, we excluded the possible activity of unwashed silver residues from electroless etching. We think that our observation can be an example of nano-enhanced electrochemical reactions that have been observed in many systems, although recent experimental and theoretical studies showed that the chemical overpotential can be lowered by a longer residence time of the reactant and the confinement effect in nanostructures as well as the increased collision frequency between reactant molecules and the nanostructured surface.41,42 Although there may be other factors responsible for the enhancement such as the different surface state or the stress of nanowires,43 it seems clear that the geometry makes a significant contribution to the enhancement. The exact mechanism of the enhancement and the molecular simulation is still under study.

Consequently, the decreased overpotential and the increased current density have contributed to the enhanced thermodynamic efficiency of solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion in the photoelectrochemical cell. The relationship between the conversion efficiency in the half reaction and the other variables can be explained by the equation below:11 (5)where Jsc is the current density at the reversible potential vs. RHE, FF is the fill factor, Pin is the input power of light (Pin is 100 mW cm−2 in this study), Vmax is the voltage at the maximum of power, and Jmax is the current at the maximum of power. The Jsc is also plotted in Fig. 2c. Among them, the 29.3 μm Si nanowires reached a Jsc of −10.65 mA cm−2. Especially, the Jsc from our group is about 43 times higher than that of the untreated Si, which is the highest value among the ever reported values under the same conditions. Combined with the onset potential data, we calculated the STH conversion efficiency of the Si photoelectrodes with and without the deposition of the catalyst on their surface. For the clear structural function relationship, we deposited Pt nanoparticles on the planar Si substrate and the nanowires. Pt nanoparticles were made by the electroless deposition method. A drop of 1 mM H2PtCl6 (aq.) in 0.5 M HF was dropped on the Si surface for 2 min. The SEM images of the Si nanowire with the Pt particles are shown in Fig. 4a and b. From the photoelectrochemical measurements, the STH conversion efficiencies of five representative Si electrodes and related parameters are presented in Table 1 and Fig. S6.† Especially, STH conversion efficiency of Si electrodes with the Pt catalyst increased from 0.03% to 0.69% for the planar Si, 0.12% to 1.19% for the 1.5 μm nanowire, and 0.48% to 1.20% for the 29.3 μm nanowire as shown in Table 1. Although Si electrodes without the Pt catalyst show lower conversion efficiencies than that of electrodes decorated with the Pt catalyst, the efficiency of the 29.3 μm Si nanowire (0.48%) without depositing any catalyst has reached up to about 70% of the efficiency of planar Si decorated with Pt (0.69%) as shown in Fig. S6.† A current density of 8 mA cm−2 without bias at the cathode and the anode can reach approximately an efficiency of 10% in the STH energy conversion and this efficiency can be applied for the commercial photoelectrochemical cell.44 This enhanced STH conversion efficiency by only controlling the structure of the surface provides the possibility of highly efficient overall water splitting combined with catalyst decoration.

4 Conclusion
The nanostructure optimization enhanced the electrochemical performance of the Si photocathode for hydrogen evolution. The 1.58-fold increase of saturation current and the achieved 250 mV decrease of the overpotential improved the efficiency for the solar-to-hydrogen conversion by the visible light. Without any catalyst, the Si nanowire photocathode produced −10.65 mA cm−2 which corresponds to the approximately 0.05 μmol s−1 hydrogen production at reversible potential vs. RHE. Therefore, the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of the optimized Si nanowire by only controlling the surface without depositing any catalyst has reached up to about 70% of the efficiency of planar Si decorated with a Pt catalyst. We expect that our work provides a key guideline in designing the optimal Si nanostructure for improved hydrogen production.
