Our goal was to determine if various solvents affect the respective crystal/nano-structure of the Cl6BsubPcs as the effects may play a crucial role in the selection of solvent(s) used when depositing these materials into organic electronic devices with solution printing/casting as the method of device fabrication. In our study, looking at a variety of solvents for the diffusion crystal grown method led to only one case for Cl6BsubPcs whereby the solvents were incorporated and influenced the crystal/nano-structural arrangements. The axial substituents are also variants to consider that can yield different types of crystal/nano-structural arrangements due to intermolecular forces. We found that the incorporated halogens (X) drive the intermolecular interactions through halogen bonding, X⋯X interactions, and C–X⋯C as well as C–X⋯π interactions. We also utilized CrystalExplorer to further show and support the presence of these interactions, using dynamic visualizations that align with the results shown through Mercury. Through extensive data acquisition and analysis, the ultimate outcome leads to future molecular design of Cl6BsubPcs for further organic electronic applications based on solution casting methodologies and the lack of solvent incorporation into their crystal/nano-structure is a positive factor and will also be considered throughout the future.
Introduction
Solution processable and scalable organic materials are very interesting to examine for their application in organic electronics which include organic photovoltaics (OPVs) due to their ability to be roll-to-roll printing fabricated.1–4 As an example, many compounds have been examined in solution processed OPVs including fullerene derivatives that have been applied as electron accepting material(s). Fullerenes have some undesirable characteristics in OPVs such as their low light absorption coefficients in the visible and near infrared region, their general aggregation which causes them to crystallize resulting in poor device stability, and their lack of structural tunability.5 This has led to the investigation of many other small molecules6–8 and polymers9–12 with electronic properties to address the gaps from fullerenes, which include synthetic methodologies for the formation of non-fullerene small molecules as electron-acceptors that have activity in the visible light and near infrared region and studies have shown diverse synthetic versatility for fullerene alternatives.6–8 As examples of small molecules, boron subphthalocyanines (BsubPcs, Fig. 1a) have also been identified as non-fullerene electron-acceptors for organic electronic applications.13
 Fig. 1  a) Generic boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) structure with common peripheral hydrogen or halogen atoms highlighted by Y (α or β) (Y = H, F, Cl) and axial bonds between boron (B) and X (X = F, Cl, Br, or can also be oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, etc. bonds with phenols, naphthols, etc. with their own R groups). b) Generic boron subnaphthalocyanine (BsubNc) structure which has a p-extension to BsubPc shown in orange and can have the same Y (α or β) or X. 
BsubPcs were first synthesized by Meller and Ossko14 some time ago. BsubPcs have a bowl-shape geometry as well as many physical properties including their ability to absorb light in the human visible solar light spectrum.15 BsubPcs have been confirmed for their application in OPVs and had a general positive outcome due to their high stability when deposited in planar heterojunction (PHJ) OPVs and when stacked with BsubPc's π-extended counterpart, boron subnaphthalocyanine (BsubNc, Fig. 1b), with a power conversion efficiency of 8.4%.16,17 Their ultimate functional stability has been further exhibited by previous work in our group, where we compared three sets of device stacked architectures16,18 by following stability testing protocols (ISOS)19 and found that the degradation of the other conductive layers in the OPV was the primary degradation point and not the degradation of BsubPcs and BsubNcs.
We have also found that through the chlorination of the periphery of the BsubPc (Fig. 1a; Yβ = ClCl6BsubPc and if Yβ + Yα = ClCl12BsubPc), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are deepened therefore allowing them to be energy level aligned with pentacene for triplet harvesting in PHJ OPVs20 and conductive polymers for their use in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs21,22 – to be solution cast devices. From previous studies, the axial moieties of a BsubPc, phenoxy derivative PhO–Cl6BsubPc (Fig. 1a; Yβ = Cl; X = –OPh) being an example, greatly increase the solubility of BsubPcs therefore making them applicable in solution cast BHJ OPVs.15,23 We have also shown that via tuning the BsubPc energy levels, the BsubPcs are able to achieve similar molecular orbital energy levels to fullerenes.24 This led to the pairing of BsubPcs with ten different polymers, and further showed that BsubPcs can be viewed as appropriate non-fullerene electron-accepting organic electronic materials.24
In previous work, we also outlined the solid-state nano-crystal arrangements of BsubPcs and observed the presence of concave–concave, convex–convex, and concave–ligand π–π interactions.25,26 We have also shown that peripheral halogenation of BsubPcs, for example Cl6BsubPc focused herein, not only changes the HOMO/LUMO energy levels but also enables significant nano-crystal structural changes through halogen⋯halogen (X⋯X) interactions, as well as halogen⋯π (X⋯π) interactions.27–30 Halogen bonding is a highly directional interaction and well known criteria needed to label an interaction as a halogen bond were established.31–34
We have previously explored the incorporation of halogen atoms onto the phenoxy axial substituent of BsubPcs (Fig. 1a; Yβ = H; X = –OPh; R = Br, I) and observed a variety of solid-state nano-engineered arrangements by the halogens forming halogen bonds.35 The alignment of the crystal interactions was found to be dependent on the halogen(s) when looking at different types of C–X⋯π interactions and the halogen positions. The electrostatic interactions of the different phenoxylated BsubPc moieties with different halogens are not as vital to the solid-state molecular packing36 as the position of the halogen on the phenoxy axial substituent.35,37 For example, it was shown that bromine/bromide in the meta position of the axial phenoxy ligand of a BsubPc results in a halogen bond between C–Br⋯N, but if in the para position, the halogen interaction is rather between C–Br⋯πpyr, excluding halogen bonding. We also examined Cl, Br and I in the meta position and were able to see a reduction in distance compared to the sum of van der Waals in the order of I > Br > Cl.35 For I, the single crystals also showed variation in halogen bonding (Fig. 2a and b) for mIPhO-BsubPc. The change in the crystal structure, where solvated crystal growth was used, exhibited dimer alignment, whereas sublimed crystal growth exhibited a one-dimensional ribbon alignment. For these reasons, we decided in this study to investigate meta-iodophenol in the axial position of Cl6BsubPc, knowing its significant ability to form halogen bonds.

Protons were omitted for clarity. Carbon – grey; boron – orange; nitrogen – blue; oxygen – red; iodine – dark purple. 
We have also found that adding a π-base in the axial position of a BsubPc changes the crystal alignment by promoting π–π interactions, specifically when using α- and β-naphthol in the axial position (Fig. 2c).36 This resulted in a disordered crystal structure of the naphthols, however, there was no disorder amongst the BsubPcs and no change in the intermolecular interactions between the axial ligand naphthols and the neighboring BsubPc, which promotes the idea of strong π–π interactions between the naphthols and the BsubPcs.
Based on the outlined conclusions regarding BsubPcs, we found it interesting to study alternative BsubPc axial substituents of Cl6BsubPc other than a basic phenol moiety (Fig. 1a; Yβ = Cl; X = –OPh) to be able to examine the nano-crystal structures and the influence of the set of solvents used for solution casting OPV devices. The main focal point of these outlined past studies is the growth of crystal structures using train sublimation in order to mimic the vapor deposition method used for several organic electronic devices including PHJ OPV fabrication. But we feel that we should also have considered solvent vapor diffusion crystal growth, using aromatic and alkane solvents for example.
Within the OPV field, modest work has been done in examining the effects of different solvents on the crystal/nano-structure of OPV materials.38–43 A previous study did look into single crystal growth of a fullerene derivative called PCBM or PC60BM or PC61BM, where crystals were grown in dichlorobenzene and chlorobenzene, each solvent being relevant to solution cast OPV devices. The study exhibited differences in the solid-state arrangements between the two solvents.38 Given the crystal/nano-structure, they speculated that using chlorobenzene as a solvent for spin coating would result in three-dimensional electron transfer, where this effect would be reduced for dichlorobenzene and therefore the solvent choice is important when solution casting the active layers for electronic devices/OPVs especially if there is a crystal/nano-structural difference based on the solvent choice.
For our study, we then began by looking through the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) and found that several solvents were incorporated into determined BsubPc single crystals: DCM,36,44–49 CHCl3,50–58 H2O,49,50,52,55,59–62 acetone,63 THF,57,63 hexane,64,65 and heptane.66,67 Furthermore, aromatic solvents were also used for BsubPc crystal growth and found to be incorporated into their determined nano-structures, such as benzene,23,35,36,52,56,68–71 toluene,53,56,72–75 chlorobenzene,15 and dichlorobenzene.62,76 For a more in-depth example, a report outlines that the solvent is incorporated into the crystals when attempting to co-crystallize a BsubPc with a fullerene.69,72,73,76 In another example, Mori et al. synthesized a fully peripherally trifluoroethoxy substituted BsubPc, where they found that peripheral ligands would flexibly surround toluene or benzene, respectively, when using slow evaporation as the method of crystallization.75 Mori et al. also fabricated a m-oxo hetero-dimer where one of the BsubPcs was a fully trifluoroethoxy substituted BsubPc and the other was unsubstituted. The trifluoroethoxy substituted BsubPc encapsulated one molecule of the aromatic solvent, whereas the unsubstituted BsubPc formed a 2:1 sandwich complex trapping one molecule of toluene between two unsubstituted BsubPcs.
Given these studies and their data outcome, we noted that there has been no work done in systematically examining the solvent effects on the crystal/nano-structure of the BsubPcs using the solvents employed for the fabrication of solution cast OPV devices. Given these outcomes in the literature, there is a concern that for solution-cast OPV devices based on BsubPcs, the solvents may incorporate themselves into the devices which, as noted for PCBM, affects the performance or can lead to device failure. This led us to investigate the solvent effects on the crystal/nano-structures of Cl6BsubPcs, as Cl6BsubPcs have been well incorporated into solution cast OPVs given the confirmed application of Cl6BsubPc(s).
Cl–Cl6BsubPc crystals were previously reported to be obtained using train sublimation and slow vapor diffusion of acetonitrile into benzene,56 where no solvate was present in the crystal. To expand this observation, for this study, we examined if there are a variety of aromatic solvents as used for solution cast OPVs and determined if Cl–Cl6BsubPc has solvents incorporated into the crystal/nano-structures. We also want to consider other axially phenoxylated Cl6BsubPcs. To consider phenoxy-Cl6-BsubPcs, we have previously reported the use of phenoxy axial groups to significantly modify the nano-structures via concave–ligand interactions.25 In addition, peripheral chlorines are known to exhibit C–Cl⋯π interactions and halogen bonds.35,56 We report, for the first time, single crystals of previously synthesized77 PhO–Cl6BsubPc as well as newly synthesized mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc and NaphO–Cl6BsubPc (Scheme 1) to also consider the halogen bonding and π–π interactions, if they also have an influence on solvent incorporation into the crystal/nano-structure. Similar to Cl–Cl6BsubPc, for all crystals grown in this study through solvent vapor diffusion, the influence of toluene, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, or a mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene (95:5) was considered and we examined them using single crystal X-ray diffraction. We chose this set of aromatic solvents based on our previous findings, for example where solution cast PhO–Cl6BsubPc OPVs were fabricated by dissolving the BsubPc in dichlorobenzene and a solvent mixture of 95:5 dichlorobenzene and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene and 1,2-dimethoxybenzene showed influence.24 Comparatively, we wanted to see if the same trends would be observed for BsubPcs as shown for the PCBM/fullerene derivative when crystals were grown from 1,2-dichlorobenzene and chlorobenzene38 and therefore we selected each solvent. We also selected toluene to consider a non-halogenated solvent.

Experimental
All solvents, excluding 1,2-dichlorobenzene, were purchased from Caledon Laboratories (Caledon, Ontario, Canada), whereas 1,2-dichlorobenzene was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and used as received. Phenol was purchased from Caledon Laboratories, while 2-naphthol, 3-iodophenol, and boron tribromide were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 4,5-Dichlorophthalonitrile was purchased from TCI America (Portland, Oregon, USA). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using a Waters 2695 separation module using a Waters 2998 photodiode array containing a Waters 4.6 mm × 100 mm Sunfire C18 3.5 μm column. The mobile phase for the column used was an 80:20 acetonitrile:dimethylformamide solvent mixture which was purchased from Caledon Laboratories. The solvent eluted from the column at a rate of 0.6 mL min−1. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a 400 MHz Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer. The crystal structures were all obtained using either a Bruker Kappa APEX-DUO PHOTON II detector or a Bruker Kappa APEX-DUO CCD detector.
Synthesis

Br–Cl6BsubPc and Cl–Cl6BsubPc. 
Both were synthesized by a method reported by Morse et al.56


PhO–Cl6BsubPc. 
The process was adapted from the process established by Ebenhoch et al.77 To an oven dried flask purged using Argon gas, Br–Cl6BsubPc (0.80 g, 1.17 mmol) was dissolved into 20 mL of DCM. To the stirring solution, phenol (0.55 g, 5.87 mmol) was added and the temperature was increased to reflux. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 hours until reaching completion, as confirmed using HPLC. The mixture was then cooled and concentrated using rotary evaporation. The crude material was purified using flash column chromatography using a solvent system of DCM:hexane (1:1). The compound was further concentrated using rotary evaporation.


NaphO–Cl6BsubPc. 
The same synthetic method was used as that described for PhO–Cl6BsubPc. Br–Cl6BsubPc (0.80 g, 1.17 mmol), naphthol (0.85 g, 5.87 mmol), and DCM (20 mL) were used. Flash column chromatography using DCM:hexane (1:1) was done using a fraction of the crude material to achieve a yield of 0.455 g, 29%. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): 8.89 (s, 7H), 7.54 (d, 1H), 7.38 (d, 1H), 7.25 (s, 1H), 7.21–7.23 (m, 1H), 5.69 ppm (d, 1H), 5.61–5.64 (dd, 1H). EI+-MS: calculated: 743.93 found: 741.9376.



mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc. 
The process was adapted from the method used for PhO-Cl6BsubPc. To an oven dried flask purged using argon gas, Br-Cl6BsubPc (0.80 g, 1.17 mmol) was dissolved into 20 mL of DCM. To the stirring solution, 3-iodophenol (1.29 g, 5.87 mmol) was added and the temperature of the reaction was increased to reflux. The reaction mixture was cooled and concentrated using rotary evaporation after 4 hours. The material was then dissolved into 100 mL of toluene and washed using a solution of 3 M potassium hydroxide (3 × 200 mL). The solution was concentrated again using rotary evaporation. A fraction of the material was then purified using flash column chromatography using DCM:hexane (1:1) to yield 0.390 g, 25%. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): 8.92 (s, 6H), 6.99–7.02 (m, 1H), 6.48–6.52 (t, 1H), 5.80–5.81 (m, 1H), 5.24–5.26 (m, 1H). DART+-MS: calculated: 819.82. Found: 818.82665.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The justification for the selection of the different phenoxy ligands incorporated into Cl6BsubPc was according to previous findings from our group (as outlined above). Phenol was used as a continuation of our previous findings where we fabricated BHJ OPVs using PhO–Cl6BsubPc.24 2-Naphthol was selected as we have shown in the past that an axial naphthol has influence on the crystal structure of a BsubPc due to different π-conjugation interactions.36m-Iodophenol was selected because we have shown that the larger the halogen, the more likely it is to participate in halogen bonding with the nitrogen atoms of a BsubPc, making it an ideal candidate for examining the driving force of the solid-state arrangement of these materials.35
These various phenoxylated Cl6BsubPc derivatives were synthesized using a consistent methodology, with Br–Cl6BsubPc being a key precursor and synthesized by a method reported by Morse et al.56 The variety of phenoxylated Cl6BsubPc derivatives were derived from Br–Cl6BsubPc under the general conditions shown in Scheme 1. Some aspects to note: Br–Cl6BsubPc was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) at a concentration of 0.06 M and the phenoxy reactant (5.0 equiv.) was added. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux and stirred for 4 hours. The progress of the reaction was monitored by reverse phase HPLC (80% acetonitrile/20% DMF) to observe and note completion. The mixture was then cooled and concentrated. With respect to iodophenol's low melting point, mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc uniquely needed to undergo a further purification step. mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc was diluted into toluene and the excess phenol was extracted using an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide. The organic phase was once again concentrated. All compounds were purified through column chromatography using dichloromethane:hexane (1:1). The yield of PhO–Cl6BsubPc was previously reported and was matched for this study.77 The yield of NaphO–Cl6BsubPc and mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc was approximated to be 29% and 25%, respectively. For further studies, it is expected that the yield of the reaction could be increased with different and proper optimization of the phenoxylation and purification method.
Single crystal structure growth
The general process for crystallization of the phenoxylated Cl6BsubPc derivatives and to consider the impact of a variety of solvents was to take each of the phenoxy Cl6BsubPcs and dissolve them into the following solvents: toluene, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and a mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene:1,2-dimethoxybenzene (95:5). These solvents were chosen because they are the commonly used solvents in the fabrication of solution processed OPVs (and other organic electronic devices, as outlined above) so that we could compare how the solvent influences the crystal solid-state arrangement on the dissolution of the phenoxy Cl6BsubPc or on the diffusion of the relevant solvents. Using solvent vapor diffusion as the crystal growth methodology, heptane was chosen as an antisolvent in order to crystallize the materials; the exception was for the case of PhO–Cl6BsubPc.24 In the case of PhO–Cl6BsubPc being dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and the mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene:1,2-dimethoxybenzene, crystals were attempted to be grown using heptane as the diffusing anti-solvent but we were unable to grow and achieve crystals, which was potentially due to PhO–Cl6BsubPc's high solubility in these aromatic solvents and general lack of molecular interactions targeted with other Cl6BsubPcs in this study. For the case of PhO–Cl6BsubPc dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene:1,2-dimethoxybenzene, crystals were successfully grown using pentane as the vapor diffusion antisolvent. The solvents do have reasonably high boiling points, and have been used within our previous experience of placing PhO–Cl6BsubPc into OPVs. PhO–Cl6BsubPc was deposited after dissolving it in dichlorobenzene and a mixture of dichlorobenzene:dimethoxybenzene (95:5), respectively.24 Chlorobenzene and toluene were also chosen for this study as solvents due to their similarity to dichlorobenzene. In this study, the only case in which the solvent and solvate were present in the sample was exhibited by PhO–Cl6BsubPc where both chlorobenzene and heptane incorporated into the crystal structure in a 7:3 ratio.
For all samples in this study, single crystals were obtained and were analyzed by diffraction (Table 1). In order to visualize the molecular interactions that are present, as well as to find the interaction lengths, angles and centroids, Mercury software was used from the Cambridge Structure Database.78 The relevant interactions were then confirmed and further analyzed using CrystalExplorer. Shape index was used in order to examine the contacts between neighboring molecules. A particularly useful tool is dnorm, where contacts are highlighted, with red indicating interactions shorter than van der Waals (vdW), white indicating interactions of similar length to vdW, and blue showing interactions longer than vdW.79–84

The solid-state arrangement of Cl–Cl6BsubPc had been previously reported by using train sublimation and diffusion of acetonitrile into benzene.56 We moved forward with growing crystals using the solvents outlined above and described in Fig. 3. For Cl–Cl6BsubPc, we saw no change in the arrangement of the crystal solid-state structures grown via vapor diffusion versus the single crystals grown by train sublimation. Each of the crystals existed in the same space group P21/n, where the R-factor ranged between 2.6 and 3.7%. The parameters of the unit cell are shown in Fig. 3b, where there is no difference in the size and arrangement of the space group. This was also confirmed by analyzing the intermolecular interaction of Cl–Cl6BsubPc. As was reported for the crystals grown using train sublimation, the Cl–Cl6BsubPc crystals exhibited πPh–πPyr interactions with distances of 3.534 Å and 3.625 Å, respectively. As was described previously for Cl–Cl6BsubPc, there were evidently halogen bonding interactions. There is a B–Cl⋯πPh interaction with a distance of 3.059 Å, but also two X⋯X interactions that were not reported, and their significance to the solid-state arrangement is worth noting. There are two Cl⋯Cl interactions: one with a length of 3.429 Å and angle of 172° and the other with a length of 3.477 Å and angle of 130°.
 Fig. 3  (a) Unit cell of Cl–Cl6BsubPc dichlorobenzene:heptane stacking along the b-axis in an anti-parallel configuration indicating concave–convex π–π interactions (CCDC 2087096). (b) Unit cell parameters of: train sublimation (CCDC 963247);57 toluene:heptane (CCDC 2087092); chlorobenzene:heptane (CCDC 2087100); dichlorobenzene:heptane (CCDC 2087096); dichlorobenzene + dimethoxybenzene:heptane (CCDC 2087097). a, b, and c indicate the unit cell length of the axis (Å). α, β, and γ indicate unit cell angles (°). 
The next consideration was PhO–Cl6BsubPc (Fig. 4), a more soluble Cl6BsubPc, which only had a single example whereby it did incorporate a solvent into the crystal structure when grown by vapor diffusion using chlorobenzene as the solvent and heptane as the anti-solvent. Both chlorobenzene and heptane incorporated themselves into the unit cell however there was no change in the space group in which PhO–Cl6BsubPc exists (P21/c), yet there is a significant change in the configuration of the unit cell as well as the interactions that are exhibited in the crystal structure of PhO–Cl6BsubPc. There is a significant change along the b-axis, as shown in Fig. 4c where the length is increased from an average of 14.9089 Å between 1, 3, and 4 to 20.9451(10) Å for 2, and to accommodate for this change, the angle β also adjusted from ≈96° to 115.589(2)°. As a result, the volume of the unit cell increased by 21.6% and the R-factor ranges from 4.1–6.4%.
 Fig. 4  (a) Unit cell of PhO–Cl6BsubPc grown from vapor diffusion using chlorobenzene:heptane which occupies the unit cell (CCDC 2087094). (b) Unit cell of PhO–Cl6BsubPc grown from vapor diffusion of dichlorobenzene:pentane (CCDC 2087095). (c) Unit cell parameters of: toluene:heptane (CCDC 2087093); chlorobenzene:heptane (CCDC 2087094); dichlorobenzene:pentane (CCDC 2087095); dichlorobenzene + dimethoxybenzene:pentane (CCDC 2087098). a, b, and c indicate the unit cell length of the axis (Å). α, β, and γ indicate unit cell angles (°). 
For comparison, using the crystal structure obtained from vapor diffusion with the solvent system dichlorobenzene:pentane (Fig. 4b) as a representation of the single crystals with no solvent incorporation, there is evidence of concave–ligand π–πpyr and π–πPh interactions, separated by a distance of 3.592 Å and 4.099 Å, respectively. Furthermore, there is also a π–π interaction between C29 belonging to the axial ligand and C1 with a length of 3.369 Å.
However, when the solvent system chlorobenzene:heptane incorporates itself into the crystal structure unit cell, as shown in Fig. 4a, the incorporation of the solvent molecules changes the crystal structure. As a result, the angle between the axial ligand and the boron changes, where the angle of the unsolvated crystal from dichlorobenzene:pentane is C(25)–O(1)–B(1) 120.4(3)°, while in the case of chlorobenzene:heptane, the angle of C(25)–O(1)–B(1) is 116.1(3)°. This in turn causes there to be a concave–ligand interaction between the axial ligand and the π-cavity of the neighboring BsubPc molecule. There are three single π–π interactions that stabilize the phenoxy ligand interacting with the neighboring BsubPc molecule of lengths 3.313 Å, 3.361 Å and 3.392 Å. In addition, the chlorobenzene molecule in the unit cell undergoes a displaced π–π interaction with a neighboring chlorobenzene and they are separated by a distance of 3.148 Å.
As expected, the incorporation of the solvent into the crystal structure also affected the halogen bonds of PhO–Cl6BsubPc. Using the crystal from the dichlorobenzene:pentane solvent system, we examined the halogen effects on the crystal structure where we saw evidence of several interactions. We see a set of C–Cl⋯N interactions, each coming from a single PhO–Cl6BsubPc with a length on 3.231 Å; however, this is not characteristic of a halogen bond due to the angle of 147.8(1)°. However, this changes for the case of the crystal structure containing chlorobenzene:heptane. The same peripheral chlorine also interacts with a neighboring proton to form a van der Waals interaction. The C–H⋯Cl interaction is measured to be 2.922 Å with an angle of 89°. The C–Cl⋯N interaction becomes slightly shorter with a distance of 3.105 Å and the angle changes to 164°, which now falls within the range of being able to qualify as a proper halogen bond.
Next, we moved on to examine NaphO–Cl6BsubPc to see whether the larger π-conjugated axial substituent would incorporate any solvents into the solid-state arrangement of the BsubPc moieties, with the crystal structure shown in Fig. 5a. As highlighted in Fig. 5b, there are no changes in the unit cell parameters and there is no incorporation of the solvent into the crystal structure. As was seen for PhO–Cl6BsubPc without of solvent incorporation, the naphthoxy ligand takes part in a concave–ligand interaction with the neighboring BsubPc. Examining the crystal from dichlorobenzene:heptane as a reference, there are two π–π concave–ligand interactions, one π–πPyr interaction separated by a distance of 3.744 Å and one π–πPh interaction with a distance of 3.798 Å. Due to the π–π interaction, we observed an angle for the molecule of 120.3° which allows it to form a C–H⋯O hydrogen bond between the axial oxygen and a neighboring NaphO–Cl6BsubPc with a distance of 2.204 Å and angle of 160.2°.

The periphery chlorines participated in many C–Cl⋯C interactions with halogen bond characteristics that are similar to vdW radii, as described in Table 2. Similarly, there are also C–H⋯Cl van der Waals interactions. The strong presence of interactions as a result of including chlorines in the periphery, as well as the large axial ligand, allows for the stability of the molecule to be achieved which in turn makes the molecule challenging to be penetrated by the incorporation of the solvents, in comparison to PhO–Cl6BsubPc.

The final set of crystals that was examined was mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc (Fig. 6) which is yet another example whereby no solvent was incorporated into the single crystals. mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc has the space group Pca21, where the molecule cocrystallizes to form a dimeric single crystal structure, similar to what was observed for mIPhO-BsubPc.35 As a result of the dimeric crystallization, this significantly increases the size of the unit cell, fitting eight mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc molecules in the orthorhombic unit cell. It is evident that the incorporation of the halogen in the meta position on the axial ligand greatly affects the molecule's solid-state arrangement. The two respective iodo atoms undergo halogen bonding and X⋯X interactions, where we see a C–I⋯N interaction with a distance of 3.104 Å and an angle of 171.2(2)°, characteristic of a halogen bond. The adjacent mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc is involved in a C–I⋯Cl interaction with a distance of 3.578 Å and an angle of 162.6(1)°. As a result, this is the only phenoxylated BsubPc moiety that exhibits both convex–convex and concave–convex π–π interactions, as the angle of the axial ligand is adjusted where it is unable to participate in concave–ligand interactions. The convex–convex πPh–πPh interaction has a distance of 3.739 Å and the concave–convex πPh–πPh interactions are found to be 3.514 Å and 3.943 Å, respectively.

The corresponding halogen bonds and X⋯X interactions show a general trend resembling type II interactions (Table 3). It is worth noting that C(20B)–Cl(5B)⋯N(4A) interaction is not consistent with a halogen interaction and C(13B)–Cl(4B)⋯Cl(1B) interaction is not consistent with an X⋯X interaction due to the angles, but the presence of the interactions is crucial in the solid-state arrangement. Furthermore, we also see evidence of C–X⋯π interactions which are similar in characteristics to C–H⋯π interactions.85 They follow a trend where halogens interacting with carbon atoms are the strongest for sp bonds and weakest for sp3 bonds. We see evidence of a C–Cl⋯πpyr interaction between the peripheral Cl and the centroid of the pyrrole ring found at a distance of 3.162 Å and an angle of 102.1°. We also noted the lengths and angles of C–H⋯Cl interactions (Table 3).

Discussion
As of submission date, there was a total of 181 BsubPcs crystal structures that have been submitted to the CCDC, as highlighted in the introduction, where 57 of the structures had a solvate present in the crystal structure. This is potentially due to the bowl shape and structure of BsubPcs, where their shape allows for many places for solvents to insert themselves in the respective crystal structure. It is evident that in the cases of Cl6BsubPcs, the peripheral halogen plays a significant role in the solid-state arrangement of each of these crystals and upon growing the crystals using solvent diffusion, it is evident that the solvent does not play a significant role in the arrangement of the crystals nor does the solvent(s) incorporate into the crystal structure, which were examined and determined in this study except for the case of PhO–Cl6BsubPc. It is clear to us that through crystal engineering, incorporating halogens in the periphery and having phenoxy groups in the axial position with potential cross molecular driven interactions must have a strong impact on the interactions which allow for firm packing and avoid solvent incorporation. The smallest influence of the halogens in the periphery is exemplified in PhO–Cl6BsubPc which may be the reason why in that case, chlorobenzene:heptane was able to incorporate itself into the crystal structure. We believe that the reason why the solvent was able to incorporate itself into PhO–Cl6BsubPc but not NaphO–Cl6BsubPc or mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc is due to the crystal engineering of the molecules in which they have many forces acting upon the molecules that cause them to have much more rigid structures.
We then further examined each of the phenoxylated Cl6BsubPcs using CrystalExplorer and first considered the comparison between the concave–ligand interactions of PhO–Cl6BsubPc (Fig. 7) and NaphO–Cl6BsubPc (Fig. 8) using the shape index. For PhO–Cl6BsubPc, there is an orange spot in the center of the phenoxy axial ligand with a corresponding light blue spot in the cavity of the BsubPc bowl (Fig. 7b and d). A similar but fainter trend is seen for PhO–Cl6BsubPc with solvated chlorobenzene:heptane indicating a weak π–π interaction between neighboring molecules. Meanwhile, what would be expected from a significant π–π interaction is seen by the displaced π–π interaction of the two adjacent chlorobenzene molecules where there are two distinct orange and blue colored phases on opposite ends of the chlorobenzene molecule, indicative of a π–π interaction. In contrast, for NaphO–Cl6BsubPc, we see two red spots at the center of both rings in the naphthoxy ligand and two corresponding blue spots on the phenyl and pyrrole rings of the BsubPc (Fig. 8a and b). The vibrant spots indicate a better alignment of the concave–ligand interaction, even if the length of the interactions is slightly longer.

(b) Shape index used to indicate the location of the π–π interactions that are present in the molecules by black circles. 
Examining the dnorm of PhO–Cl6BsubPc (Fig. 7a and c), there are multiple rep spots which are indicative of interactions similar or slightly shorter than vdW radii. There are three spots that correlate to the peripheral chlorines interacting with neighboring PhO–Cl6BsubPc molecules, but most are related to C–H⋯Cl interactions that are not overtly strong interactions. With respect to NaphO–Cl6BsubPc (Fig. 8), similar interactions are seen but related to C–Cl⋯C interactions but of more interest, is the large red spot related to the C–H⋯O hydrogen bond between the axial oxygen and the corresponding peripheral proton. This strong interaction, mixed with the halogen interaction, allows for the molecule to form ordered structures, making it challenging for solvents to incorporate themselves into the crystal. This is supported by the case of previously reported β-NaphO-BsubPc,36 where the axial ligand was disordered, with two possible configurations.
Similarly, examining the dnorm of mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc (Fig. 9a) we see several red spots representing X⋯X interactions, as well as the C–Cl⋯π interaction. The C–Cl⋯π interaction is strongly highlighted using the shape index as there is a large red spot in relation to the pyrrole and a corresponding blue spot surrounding a peripheral Cl, highlighted by the red circles. These strong interactions induce the disorder of the system which results in tightly packed BsubPc molecules in the unit cell making the incorporation of the solvent into the solid-state arrangement challenging for the crystal lattice. In addition, mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc undergoes π–π concave–convex and convex–convex interactions, which are highlighted by the shape index (Fig. 9b). The black circled areas of the shape index are related to concave–convex interactions, whereas the purple circles indicate convex–convex interactions. These interactions potentially make them difficult to be penetrated by an aromatic solvent.

(b) Shape index used to indicate the location of the π–π interactions that are present in the molecules, whereas the black circles indicate concave–convex interactions, purple circles indicate convex–convex interactions and red circles correspond to C–Cl⋯πPyr interactions. 
The densities of the crystals that were examined in this study were also compared utilizing the different solvents that were examined in this study (Fig. 10), as well as the previously reported train sublimed crystal of Cl–Cl6BsubPc (CCDC 963247). Once again there is no significant difference in the crystal densities of the examined BsubPcs except for the case of PhO–Cl6BsubPc when the crystals were grown using the chlorobenzene:heptane solvent (CCDC 2087093). The average of the unsolvated crystal densities is 1.627 Mg m−3 where the solvated crystal density decreases to 1.538 Mg m−3. This reduction in the density of the crystal supports the observations that we examined above, that the incorporation of the solvent into the crystal structure can reduce the crystal packing of the system. This can, in effect, play a significant role in the performance of materials in organic electronic devices and further supports that when incorporating materials into solution deposited devices, the choice of solvent is significant in order to avoid its role in how materials perform in devices.

Conclusions
Two novel phenoxylated BsubPcs, NaphO–Cl6BsubPc and mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc, were synthesized and characterized. These, along with previously known Cl–Cl6BsubPc and PhO–Cl6BsubPc, were each dissolved in four different solvent systems in order to grow crystals to be examined through single crystal X-ray diffraction to see if there are any changes in their solid-state arrangement between the different solvents. It was found that the only one exhibiting a chance of incorporating solvent and changing its solid-state arrangement is PhO–Cl6BsubPc whose crystal growth proceeded using the solvent system chlorobenzene:heptane. The incorporation of the solvent into the solid-state crystal arrangement altered the dominating forces of their alignment. Although this was a single solvent incorporation result with modest affects, it may be possible with other BsubPc derivatives that the solvent that is used for solution casting deposition may alter the configuration of the solid-state for the application of interest, which can then play a crucial role in the performance of organic electronic devices and/or their physics. We plan to next attempt fabricating solution cast OPVs and examine the performance of these devices in comparison to each other after casting with the solvents that were highlighted in this paper and grow associated crystals to see further outcome relevant to this study.
We also examined the effects that the axial substituents have on the solid-state arrangement of the single crystals, as well as how this is also influenced by peripheral chlorination. For both PhO–Cl6BsubPc, excluding crystals grown from chlorobenzene:heptane, and NaphO–Cl6BsubPc, the solid-state/nano-structure alignment was dependent on the axial ligands. Both exhibit the presence of concave–ligand π–π interactions as the driving force for their arrangement. Each of the BsubPcs exhibits interactions from their peripheral chlorides interacting with neighboring aromatic groups to stabilize the alignment of the materials. With respect to NaphO–Cl6BsubPc, an important interaction in the solid-state alignment is the C–H⋯O interaction which was exhibited through the examination of the structure using both Mercury and CrystalExplorer.
We found, similar to what is reported in the literature, that the larger the halogen, the more likely it is to be the driving force towards halogen bonding. For mIPhO–Cl6BsubPc, the meta positioned iodide was found to be the dominating factor in the arrangement of the crystals. It was the reason for the co-crystallization as there were many competing interactions that needed to be stabilized, in which the iodide was capable of participating in halogen bonding with a neighboring BsubPc moiety, while the corresponding iodide participated in X⋯X interactions, with a peripheral chloride. We also found that peripheral chlorides simulated interactions that were similar to halogen bonds but cannot be classified as such, due to the angle of the interaction. This is consistent with the trend that as the size of the halogen is increased, the more likely it is to participate in halogen bonding.
In summary, we can conclude that there are many interactions that are important to the solid-state arrangement of the materials examined and can therefore avoid solvent incorporation into the nano-structure. We did show that there is a possibility, based on one single crystal of PhO–Cl6BsubPc, that the solvent can be incorporated into the nano-structure that can also be incorporated into solution cast organic electronic devices and then play a role in the performance and quality of the device of interest as outlined above, whereby a past study showed that the performance was influenced by a fullerene-based material.
We have examined the effects that the solvent can have on the alignment of the crystal morphology, as well as the effects of chlorines in the periphery on the solid-state arrangement, and finally, the role played by the incorporation of phenoxy, halogenated phenoxy, and naphthoxy groups in the solid-state arrangement of BsubPc moieties. We believe that these findings can play a role in consideration of the performance of solution cast organic electronic devices which can be varied by the solvent that is used in the deposition methodology.
