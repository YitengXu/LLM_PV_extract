    , Accepted 15th March 2023First published on 16th March 2023AbstractTo obtain highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs), defects must be removed at the grain boundaries of the perovskite films. Most surface-treatment methods involve dissolving the passivating material in a solvent and applying it to the surface. However, as the surface-treatment temperature increases, the solvent evaporates, resulting in the reaction occurring in the solid state. In this work, we report an effective interfacial-engineering method for PSCs involving the in situ thermal phase transition of alkylammonium formates (AAFos). AAFos, which consist of a large organic cation with a pseudo-halide anion, can participate in the passivation as the liquid phase at relatively low temperatures because of the weak coordination between the cations and anions. This property accounts for their several benefits in interfacial engineering: (1) by enhancing the liquid-like behavior of AAFo, it can effectively passivate into the grain boundaries of perovskites to reduce the trap densities. (2) The formate anion has a relatively higher affinity with iodide vacancies than other halides, resulting in effective passivation at iodide vacancies for improved thermal stability. (3) The long alkyl chain of decylammonium cations improves moisture stability by preventing moisture permeation into the perovskite layer. Thanks to these advantages, we achieved a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.0% with superior thermal stability (under N2 at 85 °C) and moisture stability (60 ± 10% of relative humidity), which retained over 92% and 81% of their initial efficiency for 1000 hours using dodecylammonium formate. Finally, we achieved a high efficiency of 20.82% and a remarkable fill factor (80.77%) in PSC modules with an active area of 23.75 cm2, proving the suitability of the strategy for manufacturing large-area devices. This work demonstrates that defect passivation via thermal-phase transition is an efficient strategy for improving the PCE and stability of PSCs.

Broader context
Defect engineering is considered an essential process for achieving highly efficient and stable PSCs. Generally, most defects are located at grain boundaries and on the surface of perovskite films. However, until now, few studies on the selective and efficient passivation of defects on the surface and grain boundaries have been reported. In this study, we propose a smart approach to selectively and efficiently passivate grain boundaries by the thermal-phase transition of AAFos. We confirm that AAFos undergo two thermal-induced phase transitions and verify that these phase transitions effectively induce agglomeration on the perovskite surface and at the grain boundaries. Notably, the formate-treated PSCs exhibited a PCE of 25.00%, which is a significant improvement compared with that of the bare PSC (20.76%). Furthermore, the formate-treated perovskite module with a 23.75 cm2 active area exhibited a PCE of 20.82% and the remarkable fill factor of 80.77%. Since studies on achieving efficient surface passivation through exploiting the liquid phase transition-induced passivation of additive is rare, this study provides new insights for achieving efficient defect passivation.

Introduction
Over the last decade, the overall efficiency of halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased considerably. PSCs with efficiencies comparable to those of silicon-based cells and showing high potential for commercialization have been reported. Since the introduction of FAPbI3-based perovskites, manufacturers could fabricate perovskite-based devices with bandgaps close to the theoretical ideal bandgap, increasing the device efficiency from 3.8% to 25.7%.1,2 The efficient free-charge generation, narrow bandgap, and long diffusion length of FAPbI3-based perovskites are considered suitable properties for fabricating highly efficient solar cells, making them the most suitable light absorber for commercial perovskites.1–7
Despite these advantages of FAPbI3-based perovskites, there are several challenges to be resolved for commercialization. For example, solution-processed perovskite crystals (poly crystal) exhibit various defects, including Pb0, vacancies and interstitial defects due to their low formation energies.8–10 These defects within the crystal act as deep-level traps during device operation and facilitate the degradation upon exposure to external stimuli, such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and light.11–17 To fabricate highly stable α-FAPbI3, various approaches have been reported to reduce defects in FAPbI3, such as compositional,18–20 solvent,21,22 annealing condition,23 interface,24–28 and additive engineering processes.29–33 In particular, studies have been conducted to improve the efficiency and stability of devices by passivating defects at grain boundaries (GBs) through surface treatment.34–39 Generally, most defects are located at the GBs of perovskite due to its ionic nature.40–42 As a result, GBs are considered to contribute the most to the decrease in the stability of perovskites.41,43–46 Therefore, research on defect passivation at GBs is essential for achieving efficient and stable PSCs.47
Thus far, passivation engineering has been mainly focused on the incorporation of additives, including those containing functional groups that can interact with defects.48 For example, Lewis acid or base additives can form coordinate bonds to passivate electron-rich or electron-deficient defects.43,49 Furthermore, additives including ions can donate complementary charges to perovskite defects through ionic bond.50
Notably, the passivation mechanism is crucial for effective passivation, and it significantly influences the perovskite–additive reactivity. Until now, most surface-passivation processes involve the dissolution of a solid passivator in a solvent. However, the solvent quickly evaporates during the spin-coating process, causing passivation in the solution state in short time and quick reversion of passivator to solid state. Consequently, selective surface passivation is difficult to achieve due to the fixability of solids.
Unlike solids, liquids have no definite shape because of the relatively weak intermolecular interactions.51 Thus, a solid–liquid environment promotes more ionic-diffusion than a solid–solid environment.52 Therefore, solid–liquid interactions have been employed for the morphology control of crystals and the synthesis of crystals and ceramics used in battery materials and water splitting.53–57 Moreover, as the intermolecular interactions between additive molecules weaken in the liquid state, their intermolecular interaction with perovskite-crystal defects improves.58 In this respect, if the additive can be transitioned to the liquid state during the passivation process, a secondary liquid phase transition-induced passivation can occur for selective and effective defect passivation.
In this work, we introduced alkylammonium formates (AAFos) and controlled their phase for the liquid phase transition-induced defect passivation. AAFos, which consist of pseudo-halide anions and large organic cations, can easily transform into the liquid phase because of their low ionic-interaction force. Moreover, formate ion has been studied that it can more effectively passivate iodide vacancy than halide anions because of their strong electron affinity and appropriate radius.5,59,60 Thus, the vacancy-induced thermal degradation of perovskite crystals is restrained, thereby significantly improving the thermal stability. In addition, by modulating the alkyl-chain length, we could regulate the melting temperatures of AAFos. With this knowledge, we also analyzed the thermal stability of the PSCs based on the melting properties of AAFos. As a result, DOFo-treated PSCs exhibited a higher power-conversion efficiency (PCE, 25.00%) than the conventional device (20.76%). Additionally, DOFo-treated PSC cells exhibited high thermal and moisture stability, maintaining over 92% and 81% of their initial efficiency, respectively, under N2 at 85 °C and 60 ± 10% of relative humidity for 1000 h. Finally, to establish the applicability of this strategy in the manufacture of large-area devices for commercialization, a module with a 25 cm2 aperture area was fabricated, which exhibited a high efficiency of 19.78% (20.82% based on the active area) and the highest fill factor (FF) among the planar n–i–p PSCs reported to date (FF: 80.77%).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the passivation mechanism of the liquid phase transition-induced passivation. Due to the low ionic interaction between the long alkyl chains of the cation and formate anion, AAFos can easily transform into the liquid state at relatively low temperatures. Thus, we can induce secondary passivation through the liquid phase transition. Therefore, we designed and synthesized an additive that exists as liquid during the passivation process and can effectively passivate the defects present in the perovskite cells.

In this work, we synthesized various AAFos with different alkyl-chain lengths (hexyl(C6) to dodecyl(C12)). Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the synthetic schemes for various AAFos. AAFos can be obtained by the slow reaction of formic acid and alkylamine in diethyl ether solvent, at a low temperature. The final hexylammonium formate (HAFo) product was obtained in the liquid state, while octylammonium, decylammonium, and dodecylammonium formates (OAFo, DAFo, DOFo) were obtained as pure white solids. Additionally, we characterized the products through nuclear magnetic resonance (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) measurements (Fig. S5, ESI†).
To validate the phase transition, we observed the state of AAFos at different temperatures (Fig. 1b). At room temperature, all the AAFos appeared as a white solid powder, except HAFo, which has the shortest carbon chain. Except for HAFo, all the AAFos exhibited two phase transitions as the temperature increased, which is similar to the behavior of liquid crystals.61,62 In addition, it was confirmed that the phase transition temperature increased with the carbon chain length, attributed to the relatively strong molecular interactions of long carbon chains. Finally, we confirmed only the DOFo exists stably in the solid state up to 80 °C and undergoes a phase change to the transition state at 100 °C. These properties of DOFo are ideal because for passivation, that it could exist stably in solid at 85 °C and in the liquid during the passivation process at 120 °C (Fig. 1c).
Next, we analyzed the defect passivation of AAFo with varying annealing temperatures through scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S6, ESI†). Without thermal annealing, DOFo was uniformly deposited on the perovskite films. This indicated that the selective passivation of AAFo is difficult to achieve only by the spin-coating process of the solution. However, when the perovskite film was thermally treated, the phase of DOFo began to change, and it agglomerated through fluidic movement The DOFo particle size began to increase from 100 °C, where the phase transition begins, and moves to the GBs where there are many defects. At 120 °C, where the transformation into a complete liquid occurs, DOFo is almost absent from the perovskite surface and particularly locates at the GBs. This trend was also observed for OAFo and DAFo. This indicates the high effectiveness and selectivity of the phase transition-induced defect passivation. To observe the liquid phase transition-induced passivation precisely, we performed SEM according to annealing time at 120 °C (Fig. S7, ESI†). Immediately after depositing DOFo, DOFo spreads on the entire surface with very small size distribution. Furthermore, no considerable difference is observed in the size of DOFo until 5 s of annealing time because sufficient heat for the liquefaction has not been transferred to DOFo yet. However, when annealing time reaches 10 s, DOFo starts to coalesce noticeably. This phenomenon is observed when the molten part forms a liquid bridge between the powder, which can be widely observed in various solid powders or nanoparticles.63–65 After 15 s, a larger coalescence of DOFo and movement of DOFo from the perovskite surface to GBs was observed than at 10 s. This indicates that all DOFo was sufficiently liquefied with fluidity in ∼15 s, and spontaneous passivation occurred due to strong electrostatic interaction with the grain boundaries where several ionic defects exist.66–68 Finally, after an annealing time of 30 s, most DOFo forms a large crystal and is located in the GBs.
To analyze the passivation performance of AAFos, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 2a and Fig. S8, S9, ESI†). When DOFo was treated on the perovskite surface, the characteristic peak of O 1s appeared at 532.5 eV, while no distinct peak was observed for the bare perovskite. Moreover, the pure DOFo exhibited an O 1s peak at 533.1 eV, which indicates the peak shift of O 1s when DOFo by the passivation. Next, the bare perovskite exhibited characteristic peaks of Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 at 143.2 eV and 138.3 eV. In addition, the characteristic peaks of Pb0 were observed at 141.4 eV and 136.6 eV. This metallic lead can act as a deep trap in the perovskite as well as the degradation origin.48,69 When DOFo was treated, the peaks of Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 shifted toward lower binding energies, and the metallic lead peaks reduced. This shifting tendency refers that the DOFo interacts with Pb for defect passivation. Moreover, the two peaks were shifted further to the lower binding energies when DOFo was liquefied at the same concentration, and the Pb0 peak completely disappeared. This indicates that DOFo can effectively interact with Pb2+ and Pb0, resulting in the suppression of non-radiative recombination. Additionally, AAFos’ passivation was also confirmed by FTIR measurements (Fig. S10, ESI†). The 1364 cm−1 peak exhibited a red shift, attributed to the monodentate production via the interaction between Pb and formate on the perovskite surface. In addition, the 1586 cm−1 peak of the bidentate production caused by the metal–formate interaction exhibited a blue shift, confirming that AAFo was bound to the perovskite.70

To validate the proposed liquid phase transition-induced defect passivation, the defect density before and after the liquefaction of AAFos was calculated through space charge limited current (SCLC, Fig. S11, ESI†). The trap density was calculated using a previously reported method.71 The VTFL before the AAFos’ liquefaction were ∼0.78–0.8 V, which are lower than the VTFL of bare perovskite, referring to the reduction of defect density. Surprisingly, after the AAFos’ liquefaction, VTFL significantly reduced to 0.6–0.61 V. These results indicate the following: (1) the alkyl chain length of AAFo has a negligible effect on passivation and (2) liquid phase transition induces more effective defect passivation than the simple surface passivation method.
To confirm the passivation effect and thermal stability of the additive-incorporated perovskite thin films, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) before and after thermal stress at 85 °C for 100 h (Fig. 2b and c). For better readability, each XRD graph is provided in ESI† (Fig. S12). The perovskite with and without DOFo exhibits peaks at 2θ = 13.9°, 28.1°, and 42.8°, corresponding to the (100), (200), and (300) perovskite lattice planes.72,73 Additionally, the peak at 2θ = 12.5° indicates the presences of PbI2. When the AAFos were deposited, the (100) peak/PbI2 intensity ratios unchanged, indicating the AAFos’ deposition does not induce the recrystallization of perovskite surface but only passivation. Furthermore, we evaluated the variation in the passivation performance of AAFo as a function of the annealing temperature for DOFo (Fig. S13, ESI†). Regardless of the annealing temperature, no other peaks appeared compared with bare perovskite film and the (100) peak/PbI2 peak ratio and (100) peak intensity have not changed. This indicates that the probability of recrystallization due to liquid phase transition is low. After heating the perovskite thin film at 85 °C for 100 h, the PbI2 peak intensity increased notably, while the (100) peak intensity decreased for the bare perovskite film. For AAFo-treated perovskite films, thermal stability was improved due to the passivation effect of AAFos. However, OAFo and DAFo could not maintain perovskite films via the solvation effect at 85 °C. For the DOFo-treated films, the ratio did not change even after thermal stress up to 85 °C because of the strong passivation effect and the suppression of the solvation effect by the high melting point. Based on the results, we verified that DOFo is an effective material for ensuring thermal stability while increasing the efficiency of PSCs. A similar tendency was observed in the SEM images (Fig. 2d–k). For the bare perovskite thin film, PbI2 crystals were observed on the surface after the thermal stress at 85 °C, confirming the instability of the perovskite thin film. For OAFo- and DAFo-treated perovskite films, the morphology changed after thermal stress because of the liquid phase transition of the additives at 85 °C. Exceptionally, for DOFo, the passivation state of the initial perovskite was maintained without undergoing phase transition even in the thermal stress at 85 °C.
To analyze the optoelectrical effects of AAFo passivation, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurement was conducted. (Fig. S14, ESI†) The AAFo-treated perovskite film exhibited an increased PL intensity and a slightly blue-shifted PL peak, attributed to the AAFo passivation.74 In addition, the optoelectrical properties were evaluated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis (Fig. 3a–d). For the evaluation of the TRPL decay, we employed a bi-exponential equation for the fitting, and the PL decay constants are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Generally, the fast decay component (τ1) is related to the surface recombination, while the slow decay component (τ2) is related to the bulk recombination.75 The lifetime of the perovskite thin film increased when the AAFo was treated (bare: 2.55 μs, OAFo: 3.13 μs, DAFo: 3.23 μs, DOFo: 3.27 μs). However, after 100 h of thermal stress at 85 °C, the lifetime of the bare perovskite decreased sharply to 1.70 μs. The OAFo- and DAFo-treated perovskites exhibited improved thermal stabilities compared to that of the bare perovskite, and the magnitude of the lifetime decrease was reduced from 3.13 μs to 2.41 μs and 3.23 μs to 2.73 μs, respectively, due to the passivation effect. Surprisingly, it was confirmed that the DOFo-treated perovskite exhibited almost the same lifetime after the thermal-stability test (3.27 μs to 3.26 μs). For further analysis, confocal PL microscopy was conducted to confirm the morphological distribution of the optical properties of the passivated perovskite thin films (Fig. 3e). The bare perovskite exhibited an uneven PL intensity throughout the thin film. In particular, after the thermal stress at 85 °C, the degradation of the perovskite was confirmed by the significantly lowered PL intensity at the GBs where defects mainly exist. The OAFo- and DAFo-treated perovskite thin films, once passivated in liquid phase, exhibited a considerably higher PL intensity throughout the perovskite surface compared to the case with the bare perovskite. In particular, the PL intensity significantly increased at the GBs. The notable increase in the PL intensity at the GBs is attributed to the liquid phase transition-induced passivation of OAFo and DAFo at the GBs where there are relatively many defects, and this trend is consistent with the SEM and TRPL data. However, after the thermal stress, the PL intensity significantly decreased, indicating the thermal instability induced by low melting points of the OAFo and DAFo. However, for DOFo, it maintained its good passivation performance even after the thermal stress, as evidenced by the high PL intensity maintained throughout the thin film (including the GBs).

Trap densities at perovskite were numerically calculated by through SCLC analysis (Fig. 3f–i). The hole-only device structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au was employed for measuring the SCLC and the VTFL and ntrap values of the PSCs are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The bare perovskite exhibits a very high trap density of 1.49 × 1016 cm−3, and an increased trap density of 2.78 × 1016 cm−3 was confirmed after the thermal-stability test at 85 °C for 100 h. The trap densities of the OAFo- and DAFo-treated perovskites were excellently low: 8.76 × 1015 cm−3 and 9.17 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. However, these values increased to 1.47 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.18 × 1016 cm−3 after the thermal stress, indicating the generation of traps. Conversely, the DOFo-treated perovskites exhibited very high thermal stability, showing almost no change in the trap density from 9.1 × 1015 cm−3 to 9.2 × 1015 cm−3 after thermal stress.
To determine the effect of liquid phase transition-induced passivation on the efficiency of PSCs, we fabricated devices based on the following architecture: FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. As shown in the cross-sectional SEM image, the thickness of the perovskite layer was approximately 580 nm (Fig. S15, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4a and Table 1, the best PCE of the bare PSC was 20.76%, with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 25.0 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.09 V, and FF of 76.6%. When the DOFo was introduced, the PCE increased dramatically: PCE of 25.0%, JSC of 25.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.20 V, and FF of 82.2%. In addition, the device performance histograms of 20 devices confirm great reliability and the significant increase in the PCE when DOFo was introduced (Fig. 4b and Fig. S16, ESI†). This significant improvement in the efficiency of the DOFo-treated PSCs emphasizes that DOFo can effectively passivate the defects at the GBs and inhibit non-radiative recombination. Moreover, the hysteresis index (HI) was reduced from 8.82% to 0.92%, which also supports the passivation performance of DOFo. To confirm the reliability of the JSC data from the J–V curve, we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and calculated the integrated JSC (Fig. S16, ESI†). The integrated JSC of the DOFo-treated PSCs obtained by the EQE data was 25.1 mA cm−2, which shows the reliability of the JSC measured from the J–V curve. Additionally, from the UV-vis spectroscopy results, there was negligible change in the absorbance even after the liquefied DOFo treatment with different annealing temperature, which refers that the surface passivation of AAFo does not affect the bandgap of perovskite, and it is consistent with the JSC tendency of the bare and DOFo-treated PSCs (Fig. S18, ESI†). Finally, we measured the stabilized current density and power output (SPO) at the maximum power points of the bare and DOFo-treated PSCs for reliability. The device performances of the bare and DOFo-treated PSCs for SPO measurement are included in Fig. S19 (ESI†). The bare PSCs exhibited a decreasing, stabilized current density of 23.11 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 20.81% (Fig. S20, ESI†). Contrarily, the DOFo-treated PSCs showed a stabilized current density of 23.64 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 24.82%, which is similar to the PCE calculated from the J–V curve (Fig. 4c).

To validate the liquid phase transition-induced passivation effect, we fabricated 20 devices and measured the PCEs of the bare and DOFo-treated PSCs at different annealing temperatures (Fig. S21 and S22, ESI†). The best-performing devices and device-performance parameters for every PSC are summarized in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†). Interestingly, the increasing tendency with the annealing temperature is prominent, particularly for VOC and FF. The DOFo-treated PSCs at 120 °C exhibited the highest VOC and FF values, which shows that the phase transition of DOFo induces more effective surface passivation. In addition, Fig. S23 and S24 (ESI†) show the best performing PSCs and the statistical distribution of device parameters for different DOFo concentrations (5, 10, 15, and 20 mM). The device parameters of best performing PSCs and each device are summarized in Tables S5 and S6 (ESI†). We found that the optimal concentration of DOFo is 10 mM, which achieves the best VOC and FF.
For further investigation of the DOFo-passivation mechanism on trap-assisted charge recombination in the PSCs, we measured the light-intensity-dependent VOC and JSC (Fig. S25, from 10 mW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2, ESI†). From the light-intensity-dependent VOC, we could observe the decrease in the slope (kTq−1) with the DOFo treatment and liquid phase transition, from 1.697 to 1.141. This implies that the liquid phase transition can effectively reduce the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination.74 Moreover, from the light-intensity-dependent JSC plots, the control and DOFo-treated PSCs exhibited the similar slope (α), which suggests that the predominant recombination process is trap-assisted recombination in the PSCs.76 An in-depth analysis of the passivation effect on the charge transport non-radiative recombination at the interface was conducted through electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement (Fig. S26, ESI†). We employed an equivalent 2-RC circuit model and measured EIS without bias voltage in a dark environment. The essential circuit parameters from the Nyquist plots are summarized in Table S7 (ESI†). When the DOFo was treated, Rtr reduced and Rrec increased from, indicating the hole-transport promotion and non-radiative recombination suppression at the perovskite/HTL interface.76,77 Interestingly, when DOFo experienced liquid phase transition, a more pronounced trend could be observed, and as a result, the lowest Rtr (38146 Ω) and the highest Rrec were obtained (3.59 × 106 Ω). These results indicate that the liquid phase transition-induced defect passivation is highly effective for defect suppression.
To check the consistency of liquid phase transition-induced defect passivation, we fabricated PSCs with dopant-free polymeric HTL, asy-PBTBDT.78 Fig. S27 and S28 (ESI†) show the best device performance of AAFo-treated PSCs and the histograms of bare and formate-treated PSCs. The AAFo-treated PSCs showed an improvement in VOC and FF regardless of the type of AAFos, indicating that device efficiency can be improved even in dopant-free polymeric HTL-based devices via liquid phase transition-induced defect passivation.
To investigate the thermal stability of the AAFo-treated PSCs, we conducted thermal stability tests under N2 atmosphere, at 85 °C, with two types of hole-transporting materials (spiro-OMeTAD and dopant-free asy-PBTBDT, Fig. 4d). The bare PSCs exhibited a significant decrease in the efficiency to 35.5% for the spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC and 51.9% for the asy-PBTBDT-based PSC, compared with initial PCE after 300 h and 1000 h (Fig. S29, ESI†). This implies that the bare perovskite film undergoes thermal degradation at high temperatures. For OAFo, the PSC exhibited only a slight increase in stability, even with defect passivation. This is due to the low melting temperature of OAFo, which resulted in a decrease in the efficiency to 35.6% of the initial efficiency after 500 h for the spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC and 50.4% of the initial efficiency after 1000 h for the asy-PBTBDT-based PSC. As the alkyl-chain length increased, the thermal stability significantly increased, due to the increase in the melting temperature and the suppression of the solvation of AAFo with perovskite crystals. As a result, the DOFo-treated PSCs exhibited outstanding thermal stabilities, maintaining over 67% for the spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC and 92% for the asy-PBTBDT-based PSC, relative to the initial PCE, under N2 atmosphere at 85 °C for 500 h and 1000 h.
Moisture stability is also important for the commercialization of PSCs, as moisture causes a direct reaction with perovskites, resulting in severe degradation of PSCs.79 To investigate the impact of AAFos on the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface, we measured the water-contact angle of the bare and AAFo-treated perovskite films (Fig. S30, ESI†). All the AAFo-treated perovskite films exhibited a significantly increased contact angle (bare: 49.9°, OAFo: 88.0°, DAFo: 88.0°, DOFo: 92.0°), which indicates that the long alkyl chains in AAFos improve the hydrophobicity at the perovskite surface. Furthermore, we found that the contact angle of the DOFo-treated perovskite film is independent of the annealing temperature (Fig. S31, ESI†). This implies that the liquid phase transition-induced defect passivation can improve the moisture stability of PSCs. Based on these results, we conducted moisture-stability tests on the spiro-OMeTAD- and asy-PBTBDT-based PSCs (Fig. 4e; 60 ± 10 relative humidity, at room temperature). Consistent with previous results, the AAFo-treated PSCs exhibited improved moisture stability with suppressed VOC and FF, due to the enhanced hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface (Fig. S32, ESI†). In particular, the DOFo-treated PSC exhibited the best moisture stability because it had the longest alkyl chain, maintaining over 81% of its initial efficiency under 60 ± 10% relative humidity condition for 1000 h with the asy-PBTBDT-based PSC.
To prove the commercialization potential of our strategy, we fabricated a PSC module and assessed its performance (aperture area: 25 cm2, geometrical FF, 95%; the module consists of 10 stripe cells). Schematic illustration and optical images of the module are provided in Fig. S33 (ESI†). Unlike unit-cell devices, it is very important to form a high-quality perovskite thin film over a large area when manufacturing a module. We measured EL and PL images of the perovskite module and confirmed the passivation effects of DOFo (Fig. 5a and b). The bare perovskite module exhibited a low and irregular PL intensity. In addition, it was confirmed that the laser-scribed region is particularly weak and the PL intensity is uneven. This appears to be the result of the rapid degradation of the perovskite region exposed by laser scribing in air, which is the main reason for reducing the FF of the device by blocking the flow of electric charge in the module device. Conversely, the DOFo-treated module exhibited a higher overall PL intensity and uniformity even in the part exposed to air after laser etching, which is attributed to the effective passivation. This means that the liquid phase transition-induced defect passivation is highly effective for the large-area fabrication. As a result, the DOFo-treated perovskite module exhibited a highly improved PCE of 20.82% (active area: 23.75 cm2) with JSC of 2.24 mA cm−2, VOC of 11.54 V, and FF of 80.77%, compared with those of the bare perovskite module (Fig. 5c and Table 2). In particular, the FF was significantly increased from 69.89% to 80.77%, which is almost consistent with the values obtained for small-area PSCs. Although the FF is slightly lower than the TiO2-based module reported so far,80 the FF over 80% for SnO2-based module is very meaningful that it is difficult to achieve high FF in the SnO2-based module due to many surface defects occurred at SnO2 during the low process temperature.81 Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this PCE and FF are one of the highest reported thus far for small-area and large-area (over 10 cm2) planar n–i–p PSCs with SnO2 and spiro-OMeTAD (Table S8, ESI†). These results highlight the large potential of our strategy for achieving the commercialization of PSCs, improving the PCE, and suppressing the FF decrease during the fabrication process.

Conclusions
In this work, we introduced AAFo for liquid phase transition-induced defect passivation. We confirmed that AAFo can undergo effective interactions with defects at the GBs. Furthermore, the phase transition facilitates selective surface passivation at the GBs, resulting in effective defect passivation and the appropriate charge transfer at the interface between the perovskite and HTL. Besides, by regulating the alkyl-chain length, we could easily change the melting temperature of AAFos. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of the melting properties of AAFos on various properties of the PSCs, including morphology, crystallinity, PL, and thermal stability. We achieved a PCE of 25.00%, with significant improvement in the VOC and FF for the liquid phase transition-induced passivation with DOFo. In addition, the DOFo-treated PSCs exhibited superior stability, maintaining over 92% of their initial efficiency under N2 atmosphere (85 °C) and 81% under a 60 ± 10% relative humidity condition for 1000 h, with asy-PBTBDT HTM. Finally, we proved that our strategy can improve the large-area processability by suppressing the FF decrease, achieving a PCE of 20.82% and FF of 80.77% (the highest among reported perovskite modules), with an active area of 23.75 cm2. We believe that the phase transition-induced reactivity engineering for efficient surface passivation will create a pathway for securing thermal and moisture stabilities while achieving high efficiency and large-area commercialization of PSCs.

Broader context
Defect engineering is considered an essential process for achieving highly efficient and stable PSCs. Generally, most defects are located at grain boundaries and on the surface of perovskite films. However, until now, few studies on the selective and efficient passivation of defects on the surface and grain boundaries have been reported. In this study, we propose a smart approach to selectively and efficiently passivate grain boundaries by the thermal-phase transition of AAFos. We confirm that AAFos undergo two thermal-induced phase transitions and verify that these phase transitions effectively induce agglomeration on the perovskite surface and at the grain boundaries. Notably, the formate-treated PSCs exhibited a PCE of 25.00%, which is a significant improvement compared with that of the bare PSC (20.76%). Furthermore, the formate-treated perovskite module with a 23.75 cm2 active area exhibited a PCE of 20.82% and the remarkable fill factor of 80.77%. Since studies on achieving efficient surface passivation through exploiting the liquid phase transition-induced passivation of additive is rare, this study provides new insights for achieving efficient defect passivation.
