    , Accepted 16th May 2016First published on 16th May 2016AbstractThere is increasing interest in converting CO2/H2O to syngas via solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) driven by renewable and nuclear energies. The electrolysis reaction is usually conducted through Ni–YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) cermets, state-of-the-art fuel electrodes for SOECs. However, one obvious problem for practical applications is the usage of CO/H2 safe gas, which must be supplied to maintain the electrode performance. This work reports a safe gas free ceramic electrode for efficient CO2/H2O electrolysis. The electrode has a heterogeneously porous structure with Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ (SFM) electrocatalyst nanoparticles deposited onto the inner surface of the YSZ scaffold fabricated by a modified phase-inversion tape-casting method. The nanostructured SFM–YSZ electrodes have demonstrated excellent performance for CO2–H2O electrolysis. For example, the electrode polarization resistance is 0.25 Ω cm2 under open circuit conditions while the current density is 1.1 A cm−2 at 1.5 V for dry CO2 electrolysis at 800 °C. The performance is comparable with those reported for the Ni–YSZ fuel electrodes, where safe gas must be supplied. In addition, the performance is up to one order of magnitude better than those reported for other ceramic electrodes such as La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−δ and La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+δ. Furthermore, the electrode exhibits good stability in the short-term test at 1.3 V for CO2-20 vol% H2O co-electrolysis, which produces a syngas with a H2/CO ratio close to 2. The reduced interfacial polarization resistance, high current density, and good stability show that the nanostructured SFM–YSZ fuel electrode is highly effective for CO2/H2O electrolysis without using the safe gas, which is critical for practical applications.
Introduction
The increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has led to many environmental problems, such as global warming, sea level rising, etc.1,2 In order to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, there has been worldwide interest in CO2 capture, storage and utilization in recent years. Consequently, various techniques including multiple chemical and electrochemical methods have been investigated for the conversion and utilization of CO2. Among these methods, it has been demonstrated that solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) can be a promising candidate for this challenge, combined with electrical energy and heat from nuclear energy or other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energies.3,4 Driven by the external voltage, SOECs can electrolyze CO2 and H2O to produce syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, which is the precursor of a myriad of high added value industrial products including methane, diesel, methanol, etc.5,6 Meanwhile, the released oxygen ions can transport through the ion conducting solid oxide electrolyte and form pure O2 at the oxygen electrode.7,8 Compared to the conventional syngas production method, SOECs do not consume any fossil fuels, showing maximum efficiency and minimum pollution. Therefore, SOECs may play an important role in stabilizing the carbon cycle and sustainable development.4,9,10
SOECs are usually operated with H2 and/or CO as the safe gas since the state-of-the-art fuel electrode consists of Ni metal and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), an oxygen-ion conducting electrolyte.11–14 Without the safe gas, Ni particles undergo surface oxidation and agglomeration in a high CO2-steam atmosphere, losing their electrical and catalytic activity, leading to poor redox stability, and eventually degrading the cell performance.15–17 However, using safe gas is not economical and practical in industrial production.18 Therefore, it is of great interest to develop CO2 electrolysis and CO2–H2O co-electrolysis techniques without the addition of CO/H2. Theoretically, this could be achieved by using precious metals and redox stable ceramics as the fuel electrodes, which must be chemically stable in the atmospheres from CO2/H2O to CO/H2 at high temperatures up to 900 °C. Under such harsh conditions, chemically stable ceramics with mixed oxide-ion electron conductivities are limited to only a few oxides, including La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−δ (LSCM), La0.8Sr0.2ScxMn1−xO3−δ, LaxSr1−xTiO3+δ (LST), Sr2MgMoO6−δ, La0.7Sr0.3VO3−δ (LSV), and Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ (SFM).19–25 Among these materials, LSCM and LST have been studied for CO2 and steam electrolysis without using the safe gas.11,26–29 M. Torrell et al. have prepared a symmetrical cell with LSCM electrodes and a 165 μm-thick YSZ electrolyte for CO2–H2O co-electrolysis. At 850 °C, the cell showed a current density of 0.3 A cm−2 at 1.5 V when the CO2–50% H2O gas mixture was applied to the fuel electrode.30 Xie et al. have fabricated a 700 μm-thick YSZ supported cell with (La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+δ)-GDC (Gd0.1Ce0.9O2−δ) as the fuel electrode and (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3−δ-GDC as the oxygen electrode. At 700 °C and 1.5 V, a current density of 0.04 A cm−2 was reported for the co-electrolysis of CO2-33.3% H2O.27 It is noted that these cells have shown performance far lower than that of a typical cell with the Ni–YSZ electrode. For example, at 850 °C and 1.3 V, a current density as high as 1.0 A cm−2 is achieved for the co-electrolysis of a gas mixture of 25% CO2-25% H2O-25% CO-25% Ar.12
In this study, a heterogeneously porous SFM–YSZ fuel electrode is developed for CO2 and steam electrolysis without using the safe gas. The simplified microstructure is schematically shown in Fig. 1, where CO2 and H2O are expected to be converted to CO and H2. The electrolyte is YSZ, while the electrocatalyst is double perovskite SFM, which has been studied as the symmetrical electrode material for solid oxide electrolysis cells due to its excellent catalytic activity in a temperature range of 750–850 °C.29 The YSZ scaffold is formed using a modified phase-inversion tap-casting method, while the SFM electrocatalyst obtained by the infiltration technique to avoid the possible solid state reactions between SFM and YSZ since SFM is proven to be chemically compatible with YSZ only below 1000 °C.31 The infiltration derived SFM nanoparticles are uniformly deposited on the internal surface of the YSZ scaffold consisting of a gas delivery layer with unique finger-like large pores and an electrochemical reaction layer with small pores and a high surface area. The novel nanostructured electrode demonstrates a remarkable performance without the safe gas, comparable to the state-of-the-art Ni–YSZ electrode, which must be operated with the safe gas.

Experimental
An YSZ (8% mol yttria-stabilized zirconia, TZ-8Y, Tosoh Corporation) porous substrate was fabricated by the phase-inversion tape-casting method, which was modified with a graphite layer to remove the sponge layer,32,33 as described in Fig. S1 and Table S1 of the ESI.† White tape was cut into disc samples of diameter 13 mm and dried in an oven for 30 min, followed by heating at 1200 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 for forming porous YSZ substrates. Typically, the 7 wt% YSZ (TZ-8Y, Tosoh co., Japan) with a mean particle size of 0.1 μm was dispersed in ethanol and ball milled for 24 h. The YSZ suspension was dripped on the center of the YSZ substrate, which was immediately spun at 2000 rpm for 30 s to form a thin, uniform YSZ layer. After drying at room temperature, another dripping cycle was done. The thickness of 10 μm was achieved by 5 cycles. Then it was sintered at 1400 °C for 5 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1, resulting in a bi-layer structure consisting of a porous YSZ substrate layer and a dense YSZ film layer. LSM ((La0.85Sr0.15)0.9Mn3−δ) powder was prepared by a glycine–nitrate combustion method with a glycine/metal ratio of 1.15.34 The precursor solution was heated until self-combustion occurred. The as-prepared powder was collected and calcined at 1100 °C for 2 h in air with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. LSM–YSZ (weight ratio of 6:4) powders were mixed with 50 wt% binders and solvent and ground in an agate mortar for 1 h. The paste was printed on the surface of the electrolyte by a screen printing method, followed by heating at 1200 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to form a tri-layer structure with a porous YSZ substrate, a dense YSZ film, and a porous LSM–YSZ layer. An aqueous solution containing Sr2+, Fe3+, and Mo6+ ions was prepared by dissolving their soluble salts (Sr(NO3)2, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) (99.9%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) in deionized water with a molar ratio of Sr2+:Fe3+:Mo6+ = 2:1.5:0.5. The total metal ion concentration was 1.2 M in the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6−δ precursor solution. Citric acid and glycine were added into the SFM solution as the complexing reagent and combustion agent with a molar ratio of citric acid:glycine:metal cations = 1.5:2:1. The SFM deposition was conducted by infiltrating the precursor solution into the porous YSZ substrate under vacuum circumstance, followed by heating at 600 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. The process was repeated to increase the SFM loadings to 20 wt% (relative to the quality of the YSZ scaffold). Finally, the cell was heated at 850 °C for 5 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to obtain crystallized Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O3−δ, resulting in a single cell consisting of a SFM–YSZ fuel electrode, an YSZ electrolyte, and a LSM–YSZ oxygen electrode, Fig. 1.
The single cell was sealed at the end of an alumina ceramic tube with conductive resins (Shanghai Institute of synthetic resin, DAD87) in a vertical furnace (Fig. S2†). Ag wires and Ag pastes were used as the current and voltage probes. The electrochemical performance was tested in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes using humidified hydrogen and carbon dioxide (99.8%, Nanjing special gas Factory Co., Ltd.), respectively. Steam was supplied via bubbling through water at controlled temperatures. The gas flow rate was kept at 20 mL min−1 using a mass flow controller (D08-2F, Qixing Huachuang Co., Ltd.). The current–voltage characteristics were measured from open circuit voltage to 1.5 V with a scanning rate of 20 mV s−1. The AC impedance measurements were carried out with an electrochemical interface (Solartron 1287) combined with a frequency response analyzer (Solartron 1260). The frequency ranged typically from 106 Hz to 10−2 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The microstructures were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an EDX (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700 F) and a transition electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JSM-2010). The mercury injection apparatus (Quantachrome PM60GT-17) was employed to measure pore size distributions. The durability was evaluated by monitoring the current density under constant output voltage or the cell voltage under constant current density. The flow rate of outlet gas was measured with a self-made soap film flow meter. The contents of CO2, CO, and H2 were determined by online gas chromatography (FULI, GC9790II). The SFM–YSZ electrode after CO2 electrolysis was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy (Raman, Lab RAM HR800, 1000–2000 cm−1). Although it was not clear whether CO was generated by the electrolysis reaction or reversible water–gas shift reaction, the total generated gas (CO and H2) should achieve the theoretical values. That is to say, we can introduce an important performance parameter, electricity to syngas efficiency (assuming 100% current efficiency).
Results and discussion

Fig. 2 presents the microstructures of a single cell with a SFM–YSZ fuel electrode, a 10 μm-thick YSZ electrolyte and a LSM–YSZ oxygen electrode. Fig. 2a shows that the YSZ substrate has a graded open pore structure along the thickness direction, where large finger-like pores far from the electrolyte facilitate gas delivery, while small finger-like pores, adjacent to the electrolyte, serve as the functional layer for electrochemical reactions, see also Fig. 1 and S3.† The graded structure has a tri-polar pore size distribution, 10–100 μm large pores, 0.2–1 μm small pores, and 15–30 nm fine pores, Fig. 3. The upper right inset of Fig. 2a shows very good bonding between the dense YSZ and porous layers. Fig. 2b shows that the YSZ scaffold is covered with SFM particles, which form a highly continuous network for electronic conduction. The particle size is 30–50 nm, as confirmed by the bright field TEM image in the upper left inset of Fig. 2b. The nanoparticles have a good contact with the YSZ scaffold forming some bigger aggregates. In addition to Zr and Y, Sr, Fe and Mo elements are present in the infiltrated electrode as revealed by the energy dispersive X-ray mapping, Fig. S4.† Sr, Fe and Mo elements are found at the electrode–electrolyte interface, demonstrating that the vacuum-assisted infiltration is effective to introduce SFM particles into the interface between the porous and dense YSZ layers throughout the 700 μm thick scaffold. Furthermore, the nanoparticles do not have an obvious effect on the pore size distribution, but slightly reduce the size of the large, small, and fine pores, Fig. 3, suggesting that SFM could be deposited to every available inner surface of the YSZ scaffold. The shrinkage in the pore size is accompanied by pore volume reduction, which is also shown with porosity reduction from 57% to 50% by the Archimedes drainage method. The tortuosity factor of the SFM–YSZ fuel electrode is determined to be 2.03 by the mercury intrusion method, much lower than the values of 6–10 for the traditional fuel electrodes.35,36 The nanoparticles are double perovskite structured SFM when the infiltrates are heated at 850 °C, Fig. S5.† The XRD analysis also suggests that SFM is chemically compatible with YSZ below 850 °C. Excellent electrochemical performance is expected for this unique structure where straight open pores facilitate gas delivery and SFM nanoparticles promote the electrode reaction.

The electrochemical performance of the nanostructured SFM–YSZ electrode is investigated in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes. The fuel cell mode is conducted with humidified hydrogen (∼3 vol% H2O) as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant, Fig. 4. The open circuit voltage (Voc) is 1.04 V at 800 °C, indicating that the YSZ electrolyte is dense enough. The peak power density is 1.03 W cm−2, while the total interfacial polarization resistance is only 0.18 Ω cm2 under open circuit conditions. The SFM–YSZ electrode polarization resistance is about 0.02 Ω cm2 considering that the LSM–YSZ electrode resistance is 0.16 Ω cm2 as determined with a LSM–YSZ∣YSZ∣LSM–YSZ symmetrical cell measured in air, Fig. S7.† The electrochemical performance is much higher than those reported for SFM based fuel electrodes. For example, the polarization resistance of a SFM fuel electrode supported on a LSGM electrolyte is 0.27 Ω cm2.23 Considering that LSGM has relatively higher ionic conductivity than YSZ, the polarization resistance of the nanostructured SFM should be even lower when it is applied on the LSGM electrolyte. The performance is even comparable with that obtained using the Ni–YSZ electrode, which is also prepared by the phase-inversion tape-casting method. The peak power density is 0.80 W cm−2 at 800 °C for a single cell consisting of a Ni–YSZ fuel electrode, a 10 μm thick YSZ electrolyte and a LSM–YSZ oxygen electrode.32 Such excellent performance should be attributed to the novel structure where the graded YSZ scaffold is infiltrated with SFM nanoparticles. Furthermore, the single cell is very stable in 60-hour testing at 800 °C with only 3.7% degradation in the current, Fig. 4c.

The electrochemical performance is further investigated in electrolysis mode by electrolyzing H2O and using H2 as the safe gas, Fig. 5. In the electrolysis mode, negative current density indicates that steam is split into hydrogen and oxygen. The Voc increases with the increase of H2 concentration, i.e., the decrease in H2O concentration, which can be described by the Nernst equation.16 At Voc, the total interfacial resistance is 0.230 Ω cm2, 0.245 Ω cm2 and 0.263 Ω cm2 while the SFM–YSZ electrode resistance is 0.07 Ω cm2, 0.085 Ω cm2 and 0.103 Ω cm2 obtained, respectively, with 10 vol H2O%, 20 vol H2O% and 30 vol H2O%. The applied voltage increases almost linearly with increasing current density up to 1.5 A cm−2, showing no concentration polarization, which could be ascribed to the unique microstructure of the SFM–YSZ electrode. At an applied voltage of 1.3 V, a current density of 1.12 A cm−2 is observed for 10 vol% H2O, while it increases to 1.27 A cm−2 for 20 vol% H2O and 1.35 A cm−2 for 30 vol% H2O. In general, the steam electrolysis performance is improved significantly compared with those in previous reports which are tested under similar conditions. For example, the total interfacial polarization resistance based on the YSZ electrolyte is 0.245 Ω cm2, compared to 0.65 Ω cm2 for a SFM electrode on an LSGM electrolyte tested at 800 °C for steam electrolysis of H2-20 vol% H2O.37 In addition, the performance is comparable to those of the Ni–YSZ supported cells, e.g., 0.22 Ω cm2 at Voc and 1.7 A cm−2 at 1.3 V for 50 vol% H2O for a Ni–YSZ/YSZ/LSM–YSZ cell.38,39 Furthermore, the electrolysis cell is stable during short-term durability testing for steam electrolysis at a constant current density of 1.0 A cm−2 and 1.5 A cm−2, Fig. 5c. As discussed above, the SFM infiltrated YSZ composite electrode can effectively improve the catalytic activity for steam electrolysis.

(a) Applied voltage as a function of current density; (b) electrochemical impedance spectra under open circuit conditions; (c) the variation of cell voltage versus time in the galvanostatic mode using H2-20 vol% H2O. 
Subsequently, the SFM–YSZ electrode is applied for dry CO2 electrolysis and CO2–H2O co-electrolysis without using the safe gas, either H2 or CO, Fig. 6. When no H2/CO is used, the Voc becomes much lower, consistent with previous reports.40,41 As the applied voltage reaches theoretical Voc, the electrolysis reaction can proceed. Then, the applied voltage increases sharply with the current density, having an obvious turning point for each curve. The high turning point is a reflection of the catalytic activity of SFM for CO2 and water splitting. Below the turning point, the applied voltage increases sharply with current density, which is possibly associated with the electrochemical reduction of SFM, i.e., the activation process of the SFM electrocatalyst.28,42 When the applied voltage exceeds the turning point, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and H2O starts to accelerate at an exponential rate in the current density, indicating that the increased voltage promotes the reaction kinetics significantly.

When dry CO2 is electrolyzed, the SFM–YSZ electrode demonstrates excellent performance compared to those reported for single cells based on YSZ electrolytes and safe-gas free electrodes, Table 1. At 1.5 V, the current density is 1.10 A cm−2, which is 57% higher than 0.7 A cm−2, the highest current density that has been reported for CO2 electrolysis without using the safe gas. Compared with the cells using the LST–SDC and LSCM–SDC composites, typical safe-gas free fuel electrodes, the current density is increased by a factor up to 20. The total interfacial polarization resistance at Voc is 0.41 Ω cm2, much smaller than 3.2 Ω cm2 and 12 Ω cm2 for the LSCM–SDC and LST–SDC based single cells, respectively. The SFM–YSZ electrode resistance is only 0.25 Ω cm2, one order of magnitude lower than that of the LSCM–SDC and LST–SDC electrodes when the same oxygen electrode resistance is assumed. Also, the performance is comparable to those reported for the Ni–YSZ based cells, which must be operated with the safe gas. For example, when 10% CO is used as the safe gas, the interfacial polarization resistance is 0.32 Ω cm2 at Voc and the current density is 0.45 A cm−2 at 1.5 V for a Ni–YSZ based cell that is operated at 900 °C.7 Therefore, SFM–YSZ has demonstrated the highest performance as the fuel electrode for dry CO2 electrolysis.

When steam is added, the cell exhibits better performance, Fig. 6a. The turning point is observed at a slightly lower applied voltage, which can be attributed to the relatively lower decomposition potential of steam than that of CO2.4 The current density increases with increasing steam concentration. For example, when the applied voltage is 1.5 V, the current density is increased from 1.10 A cm−2 for dry CO2, to 1.27 A cm−2 for CO2-20 vol% H2O, and further to 1.46 A cm−2 for CO2-40 vol% H2O. Meanwhile, the total polarization resistance under open circuit conditions is reduced from 0.41 Ω cm2 to 0.39 Ω cm2 and 0.36 Ω cm2, respectively. It is reported that steam electrolysis occurs easier than CO2 electrolysis due to the lower activation energy for adsorption and dissociation as well as the larger diffusion coefficient,39 so the corresponding polarization resistance is reduced, revealing that the CO2 reduction should probably be the limiting step in the CO2–H2O co-electrolysis process. The reaction steps of the co-electrolysis reaction in the fuel electrode are very complicated and can be briefly shown as follows:47 (1) (2) (3)
Apparently, the chemistry involved in the co-electrolysis of steam and CO2 is significantly more complicated than that involving the steam or CO2 electrolysis alone. It is beyond the scope of this work but will be addressed in future work.
The CO2–H2O co-electrolysis performance derived from the SFM–YSZ electrode is also compared with that reported in the literature under similar operating conditions, Table 2. The current density and total interfacial polarization resistance are comparable with those obtained using the Ni–YSZ electrodes, state-of-the-art fuel electrodes, where H2 and/or CO must be supplied as the safe gas to maintain the electrochemical performance. The performance is also comparable with that of the LSV (La0.7Sr0.3VO3−δ) based oxide electrode enhanced with Pd and CeO2 catalysts and operated using the safe gas. In addition, the performance is much higher than that of the available reported data on co-electrolysis without using the safe gas. The interfacial polarization resistance at Voc for the SFM–YSZ fuel electrode is 0.20 Ω cm2 for CO2-40 vol% H2O. It is even 5 times lower than that reported for the LSCM based electrode for CO2-50 vol% H2O at 850 °C when the same resistance is assumed for the fuel electrode (0.16 Ω cm2). The current density, 1.46 A cm−2 at 800 °C for the present work, is about 5 times that of 0.3 A cm−2 at 850 °C as reported by M. Torrell et al.

Fig. 7 shows the production rate derived from CO2-20 vol% H2O co-electrolysis at various applied voltages. The rate increases with the applied voltage, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 6a. The H2 production rate is 1.89 mL min−1 cm−2 at 1.2 V, increasing to 6.12 mL min−1 cm−2 at 1.5 V. The production rate increases by a factor more than 3 when the voltage is increased from 1.2 V to 1.5 V, suggesting that high voltage operation benefits the co-electrolysis process. The CO production rate is 0.72 and 2.80 mL min−1 cm−2 at 1.2 and 1.5 V, respectively. The CO/H2 ratio in the product is much lower than the CO2/H2O ratio of the feeding gas, suggesting that the co-electrolysis process is predominated by steam reduction. The CO/H2 ratio is also affected by the applied voltage, inferring that the kinetics dependence on the voltage is different for CO2 and steam. It is thus possible to control the CO/H2 ratio through the voltage, which is very feasible to realize. At 1.3 V, the CO/H2 ratio is close to 0.5, which is a high value-added product that is quite desired for the synthetic fuels in the industrial practices of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis.50
 Fig. 7  CO and H2 production from the co-electrolysis of CO2-20 vol% H2O at 800 °C under different applied voltages. 
The variation of current density via elapsed time is recorded for CO2-20 vol% H2O co-electrolysis at 800 °C at a constant applied voltage of 1.3 V, Fig. 8a. The initial current density is in good agreement with the value observed in Fig. 6a. In the initial stage of 5 h, there is a slight decline in the current density, about 0.0016 A cm−2 per hour. Subsequently, there is no observable degradation in the current density, indicating that a steady state operation has been achieved after 5 h operation.51 The production rate is also measured with an interval of 2–5 h, Fig. 8b. The total amount of generated CO/H2 gas in Fig. 8b, which is determined by gas chromatography from the outlet stream, is about 96.5% of the predicted value from the current density shown in Fig. 8a. The inconsistency phenomenon should be related to O2 impurities at the fuel electrode side as well as the gas leakage.52 It is worth noting that the H2/CO ratio is kept at about 2:1, which could readily serve as the feedstock for the synthesis of alcohols and other liquid fuels.

Conclusions
In this work, the SFM–YSZ electrode has demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance. In the fuel cell mode, an electrode interfacial polarization resistance of 0.02 Ω cm−2 and a peak power density of 1.03 W cm−2 are achieved at 800 °C when humidified H2 is used as the fuel. In the electrolysis mode, the interfacial polarization resistances of the fuel electrode are 0.25 Ω cm2 and 0.20 Ω cm2 under open circuit conditions while the current densities are 1.10 A cm−2 and 1.46 A cm−2 for the electrolysis of dry CO2 and the co-electrolysis of CO2-40 vol% H2O, respectively, when the cell is operated at 800 °C at an applied voltage of 1.5 V. The performance is comparable with that of Ni–YSZ cermet, the state-of-the-art fuel electrode, which must be operated with CO/H2 safe gas. In addition, the electrolysis performance is much higher than that reported for other ceramic electrodes operated without the safe gas. For example, when dry CO2 is electrolyzed at 800 °C, the current is enlarged by a factor up to 20, while the interfacial polarization resistance is reduced to one magnitude lower. During the 25 h stability test for CO2-20 vol H2O% co-electrolysis at 1.3 V, the cell has achieved a stable production rate and a H2/CO ratio of approximately 2, which is suitable for synthesizing hydrocarbon fuels. The excellent electrochemical performance should have resulted from the unique electrode structure where the large finger-like channel benefits the fuel delivery efficiency while the small finger-like layer adjacent to the electrolyte benefits the electrochemical reactions, which is further enhanced with SFM nanoparticles that are capable of catalyzing CO2–H2O electrolysis without the addition of any safe gases. Further, the SFM–YSZ electrode does not show any reactant starvation phenomena that could be observed for conventional composite fuel electrodes. In short, this study reveals that the use of nanostructured ceramic fuel electrodes is a promising strategy for CO2/H2O electrolysis without the safe gas.
