    , Accepted 23rd October 2017First published on 24th October 2017AbstractThis work has chemically addressed the enigmatic effects of water on solar cell devices based on an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite, i.e., water can exert either beneficial or detrimental effects on device fabrication and device stability. We have examined in detail a known conversion of lead(II) iodide crystals to a polymer strip of a hydrated plumbate dimer in water and analyzed the time course of the conversion of the fiber crystals of the hydrate to perovskite crystals using fiber X-ray diffraction analyses. We found that the first step, the conversion of lead(II) iodide to a plumbate intermediate, is a fast solid-to-solid conversion reaction, and that the second step, the conversion of this intermediate to the perovskite, is also very fast because of easy loss of water. Overall, we propose that the water present as a minute constituent in DMF or DMSO actively participates as a catalyst in the whole reaction scheme, acting in the first step as a hydrated methylammonium to assist the cleavage of Pb–I bridges, and in the second step through quicker loss from a plumbate intermediate because of a lower hydrogen-bond accepting ability than DMF or DMSO.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (PVK, CH3NH3+PbI3− or MA+PbI3−) solar cells (SCs)1–10 have attracted tremendous attention because of their remarkable power-conversion efficiency of >22%;11 however, there remains an enigma about the effects of adventitious water according to various reports describing either beneficial6,12–17 or detrimental effects18–22 on device fabrication and device stability. Apparently, water is not an innocent bystander, but rather an active player in this chemistry. We address here this enigma through a combination of bulk experiments and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. We recently reported a three-stage conversion of a sheet crystal of PbI2 (PI) to a cubic lattice of PVK mediated by DMF (Fig. 1a) in which two of the steps are very slow, requiring prolonged heating at 60 °C to 100 °C, i.e., the conversion of PI to a polymer strip of a solvated neutral dimer INT-F1 ((PbI2)2·(DMF)2), and that of an anionic plumbate dimer INT-F2 ((MA+)2·(PbI3−)2·(DMF)2) to PVK.23 Similar slow steps also exist in a DMSO-mediated path.23 The sluggishness of the first step stems from the lack of effective mechanisms to cleave the iodo bridges (wavy lines in Fig. 1a) in a basic solvent like DMF, so we recently designed a push–pull catalysis effected by a small amount of sulfamic acid (Fig. 1c),24,25 and we conjectured that water may exert similar effects acting as a hydrogen-bonded methylammonium–water cluster (MA+·(OH2)n; Fig. 1d). We report here that water greatly accelerates the conversion of solid PI and CH3NH3+I− (MAI) in water to a water variant of INT-F2 ((MA+)2·(PbI3−)2·(DMF)2) [fibrous solid INT-W ((MA+)2·(PbI3−)2·(H2O)2) forming at 25 °C within 1 min],26,27 and that crystalline PVK formation from single crystalline INT-W (occurring at 40 °C) also takes place much faster than the conversion from INT-F2 (at 100 °C). Water also effects fast degradation of crystalline PVK into INT-W either in water or under humid nitrogen by acting as a base to remove MA+ from the PVK lattice (at 25 °C; Fig. 1b), thus establishing a rapid equilibrium between INT-W and PVK at low temperature. Given the rapidity of the water-mediated processes and the hygroscopicity of MAI, DMF, and DMSO, we suggest that adventitious water can participate in the standard solution processes of PVK-SC fabrication as well as during degradation.

2. Results and discussion
We first describe the solid-to-solid conversion of PI to INT-W and PVK in aqueous MAI—a reaction that has been known for 30 years.26 However, this reaction has received scant attention, probably because water dissolves none of PI, PVK, and INT-W, and hence this solid-state reaction in water is useless in practice. We study here the details of the reaction and the reactivity of isolated fibrous hydrate INT-W by XRD analysis. We note here that the crystals of INT-W dissolve quickly in excess DMF or DMSO either with retention of its structural integrity discussed below or more likely through the replacement of water molecules by DMF or DMSO molecules present in excess.
Bulk and XRD experiments
Stirring a yellow powder of lumpy PI (0.4 mmol) in 1.0 mL water containing 2 mmol MAI for 1 min at 25 °C forms fibrous pale-yellow crystals of INT-W ((MA+)2·(PbI3−)2·(H2O)2), which were immediately filtered and washed with dichloromethane to remove excess MAI. The product was essentially pure INT-W, not containing PI according to XRD analysis. The facility of this degradation of PI to INT-W is remarkable (but not described in the literature)26,27 because an equivalent process in DMF or DMSO requires heating at 60 °C for several hours.23 When the excess MAI was not removed by washing of the fiber, INT-W was further converted to [PbI6]4− ((MA+)4·([PbI6]4−)·(H2O)2; TA)28 (Fig. 1b). For this rapid conversion of PI into INT-W, we consider a six-centered push–pull cleavage, a mechanism widely known for organic reactions, of Pb–I bridges by hydrated methylammonium (MA+·(H2O)n), such as MA+·OH2 (Fig. 1d), and similar to the one we recently proposed for sulfamic acid (NH3SO3)-accelerated PVK formation (Fig. 1c).24
Upon further heating of INT-W in water at 90 °C, we saw a conversion to PVK with spontaneous loss of its water of crystallization (note: water loss even in water), and the production of a black PVK powder isolated by quick filtration and characterized by XRD (Fig. S1†). Upon cooling below 40 °C in water, however, these PVK crystals regenerate the colorless INT-W over 2 h (see the ESI† for a video of this conversion), as described in the literature.26 Such facile reversibility of the INT-W-to-PVK conversion suggests that water molecules in INT-W are only weakly bound in the crystal lattice of INT-W (see below). Further heating of PVK crystals at >130 °C under nitrogen regenerates PI because of the loss of CH3NH2 and HI gases.23
We found, in accordance with the above solution experiments, that the dehydrative conversion of INT-W into PVK under nitrogen is a very rapid process as shown by the variable-temperature XRD analysis of an isolated INT-W fiber (Fig. 2 and S1†). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, INT-W (2θ = 8.5° and 10.5°) disappeared in 10 min at 40 °C with concomitant formation of PVK (2θ = 14.0°). Fig. 2c illustrates the progress of the reaction of INT-W (taken from Fig. 2b) compared with those of the structurally related DMSO and DMF intermediates taken from ref. 23. The reaction of INT-W is much faster than those of INT-F2 and INT-S which require 100 °C and 120 °C, respectively, for complete conversion (Fig. 2c).23

(b) Conversion of INT-W (blue) to PVK (purple) plotted for the diffraction peak of PVK (14.0°) against temperature and time. The gradual increase of the peak intensity of PVK after termination of the reaction at 40 °C can be ascribed to Ostwald ripening of PVK crystals.

We also studied by XRD the reversion of the fibrous PVK crystals back to INT-W crystals under water-saturated nitrogen (see the next section for details). This reaction completed after 2 h at 25 °C, more slowly than the degradation under nitrogen saturated with DMF or DMSO vapor (<0.5 h at 25 °C).23 Note that these are more basic than water (hydrogen-bond acceptor strength of water = 0.64, DMF = 2.10, and DMSO = 2.58),29 and can therefore remove MA+ from the PVK lattice more effectively (cf.Fig. 1a), thereby causing more rapid degradation back to INT-F2 ((MA+)2·(PbI3−)2·(DMF)2) and INT-S ((MA+)2·[(PbI3−)2PbI2]·(DMSO)2). The higher basicity of DMF and DMSO likewise accounts for the slower conversion of INT-F2 and INT-S to PVK as discussed in the previous paragraph.
Atom-to-atom mapping of the dehydration/hydration of INT-W
A two-dimensional (2-D) XRD study of a dehydration/hydration cycle for a single fiber of crystalline INT-W and PVK indicated that the INT-W-to-PVK conversion occurs in a stereoregulated manner (Fig. 3). Fig. 3a shows an XRD image of the INT-W fiber, where the diffraction peaks of (100) and (10) are aligned horizontally, indicating that the crystal lattice is parallel to the fiber axis. After dehydration to PVK at 100 °C (Fig. 3b), eight spots appeared along the (100) diffraction circle (arrows), indicating that PVK has two orientations; one is parallel to the fiber axis and the other orthogonal to it—a behavior similar to that of INT-F2 reported previously.23 Interestingly, when the PVK crystalline fiber was hydrated by moist nitrogen, the original crystal orientation along the fiber axis was largely regenerated in the INT-W fiber (Fig. 3c, showing (100) and (10) peaks aligned horizontally). As expected from the azimuthal signal widening in Fig. 3c, the second conversion of INT-W to PVK at 100 °C (Fig. 3d) resulted in the complete loss of crystal orientation. We consider that such changes of the crystal orientation during the hydration/dehydration process render crystal growth control a rather difficult task during the fabrication of an SC device.

(c) INT-W obtained by the hydration of PVK fiber with moist nitrogen. (d) PVK fiber obtained by a second heating at 100 °C. 
We next consider atom-to-atom mapping of the conversion of INT-W to PVK. This conversion is essentially the same as the one found previously for INT-F2.23Fig. 4b shows the known27 crystal structure of INT-W as viewed approximately along the (PbI2)n polymer chains (only two sets of Pb atoms are shown for clarity). This structure, along with similar intermediates previously reported, has a μ-iodo-bridged, square bipyramidal (PbI2)n polymer chain. The (PbI3−)2 structure in INT-W is stabilized by strongly hydrogen-bonded units of MA+·OH2.

Red arrows illustrate the conversion to INT-W. (h) Top view of (g). The (110) normal = the b-axis of INT-W (=the fiber axis). 
The very facile conversion of PVK back to INT-W (Fig. 1) suggests their topological similarity, which we can identify by superimposing the crystal structure of INT-W on the cubic lattice of PVK (Fig. 4c, d, and f–h) as we previously found for INT-F2.23 We see here that the motion of each dinuclear plumbate in a pair along the red arrow directions converts INT-W (Fig. 4f) to PVK or vice versa (Fig. 4g and h; see Fig. 4c and d for the experimental crystal structure of PVK on which Fig. 4g and h were drawn). In this way, the polymer strips of INT-W laid along the fiber axis are zipped together to form a cubic PVK crystal with minimum atomic motions. In the backward process, which occurs quickly at 25 °C, H2O extracts MAI from the cubic PbI3− lattice of PVK to form MA+·OH2 weakly hydrogen bonded to the dinuclear (PbI3−)2 of INT-W. There is a notable correlation of the geometric parameter of PVK (i.e., 4.46 Å = (6.31 × √2)/2) with that of the INT-W geometry (4.74 Å).
Because of the topological similarity of the positions of the (PbI3−)n polymer chain along the a- and c-axes of INT-W, another atom mapping can also be drawn when the structure of Fig. 4f is placed with a 90° rotation, as shown in Fig. S2.† These processes accompany the rotation of the crystal b-axis lattice of INT-W by ca. 45°, which was experimentally verified by 2-D XRD analysis, as described above.
Changes of crystal volume during dehydration/hydration
The desolvation/solvation process inevitably causes changes of the volume (and density) of the crystals, and this change was found to be very small for the dehydration of INT-W to PVK. Fig. 5 shows a comparison of volume/Pb atom among INT-W, INT-F2, INT-S, and PVK. The volume change during the conversion of INT-W to PVK is very small, 10% (273 Å3 to 247 Å3), which is the smallest value among the W, F2, and S systems. The volume change in the S system is the second smallest, 13%, and that in the F2 system is the largest (30%).23
 Fig. 5  Volume changes during the conversion between an intermediate containing water, DMF, and DMSO (INT-W, -F2, and -S) and PVK. The volumes are calculated from lattice constants measured at 20 °C. 
The small volume change in the W (and S) system accounts for the observed retention of the crystallographic orientations in the INT-W-to-PVK transformation (Fig. 3b) because the water loss during this conversion causes only minor dislocations of atoms in the crystals (Fig. 4f and g). This is also reflected in the difference of the crystal morphology of PVK fibers obtained by desolvation of INT-W, INT-F2, and INT-S (Fig. 6). The PVK fiber obtained by thermal dehydration of INT-W has a very smooth surface, as shown in the SEM image in Fig. 6a. This smoothness is similar to that of PVK fibers obtained from INT-S (Fig. 6c),23 but stands in contrast to the rough and cracked surface of PVK from INT-F2 (Fig. 6b).23

3. Conclusions
We have examined in detail the conversion of PI crystals to PVK crystals in aqueous MAI via a polymer strip of a plumbate dimer (INT-W) and analyzed the time course of the conversion of crystalline INT-W to crystalline PVK using fiber XRD analyses. First, PI was found to degrade quickly into INT-W within 1 min at 25 °C. We ascribe the origin of this quick conversion to a six-centered push–pull mechanism by hydrated methylammonium, such as MA+·OH2. Second, further conversion of INT-W to PVK occurs quickly at 40 °C, and much more quickly for INT-S (DMSO complex) and INT-F2 (DMF complex). Among a number of properties associated with these solvents,31 we ascribe the uniqueness of water to a lower hydrogen-bond acceptor strength compared to DMSO and DMF, and hence easy detachment from the crystal lattice, and its reverse reaction also occurs quickly (2 h, 25 °C). Although the overall PI-to-PVK conversion in water is very fast, water itself is not a practically useful solvent for device fabrication because it dissolves none of PI, INT-W, and PVK. Nonetheless, the water present as a minute constituent in DMF or DMSO is expected to take part as a catalyst, in the process of the formation and degradation of PVK-SC devices.
We found that the PI-to-INT-W and INT-W-to-PVK conversions that occur at 25 °C in the solid state in water are much faster than the same reactions in a homogeneous solution of DMF or DMSO (at 60–100 °C). Therefore, we suggest a possibility that water catalytically participates in the reactions in wet DMF or DMSO; that is, MA+·(H2O)n first converts PI to INT-W, which then undergoes solvent exchange to afford INT-F2 or INT-S (Fig. 7). This latter intermediate may produce PVK directly or viaINT-W. PVK rapidly degrades into INT-W when exposed to water vapor, just as it degrades into INT-F2 upon exposure to DMF. In these degradation processes, water and DMF act as a base to remove the acidic MA+ molecules from the PVK lattice. PVK also degrades into PI at temperatures > 130 °C because of the loss of CH3NH2 and HI gases. In summary, the mechanistic study presented here provides insight into the role of water present in the precursor solution or in the fabricated PVK film, which can exert either beneficial or detrimental effects.

4. Experimental
Preparation of fibrous INT-W ((MA+)2(PbI3−)2·(H2O)2)
PbI2 (184 mg, 0.4 mmol) and MAI (318 mg, 2.0 mmol) were mixed in water (1.0 mL, Milli-Q), and immediately white precipitates of INT-W were produced. The suspension was heated to 90 °C for 30 min to form a black suspension which was characterized by XRD to be PVK (see Fig. S1b† for XRD data). When cooled to room temperature it formed fibrous crystals of INT-W over 2 h (see the ESI movie†), which was characterized by XRD (Fig. S1c†).
Fiber X-ray diffraction analysis
The diffraction images for fiber X-ray analyses were collected on a Rigaku Rapid II diffractometer equipped with an imaging plate (IP) using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5419 Å) radiation. Diffraction images were taken under the following conditions: exposure time, 1 s per °; dω, 180°. The fiber was placed with its fiber axis perpendicular to the horizontal line. The fiber was kept under nitrogen atmosphere during measurement. The measurement temperature was controlled by a heater attached to the nitrogen generator. Image acquisition took 5 min: 3 min for exposure and 2 min for IP reading.
Conversion of INT-W to PVK

INT-W fibers were prepared directly from solution. A single INT-W fiber was picked out from the mother liquor with tweezers, immersed in a large amount of dichloromethane on a glass plate to rinse out water droplets and wash out the remaining MAI on the surface. We mounted on a loop, under dry nitrogen, a 15 μm single crystalline fiber of INT-W perpendicular to the X-ray beam, and examined its conversion to PVK at temperatures between 20 °C and 100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/5 min.
Vapor treatment experiment
The PVK fiber sample was kept in a moist nitrogen atmosphere at 25 °C for 2 h. The fiber XRD measurement was performed at 20 °C under nitrogen. Conversion to PVK was carried out at 100 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
SEM analysis
SEM measurement was conducted on an FEI Magellan 400L instrument at a landing voltage of 1 kV under a reduced pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa. Fiber samples were prepared following procedures described in the literature23 (for INT-F2 and INT-S), or above (for INT-W). Single fibers were picked out with tweezers, transferred onto an ITO/glass plate, and annealed at 100 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere before measurement.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  
PI-to-PVK conversion in DMF and in water. (a) DMF-mediated conversion. (b) Water-mediated conversion in aqueous MAI solution. (c) Sulfamic acid catalysis of Pb–I cleavage. (d) Reaction assisted by (MA+·OH2)n.	 

 	Fig. 2  Time course of conversion of INT-W to PVK by stepwise heating (10 °C/5 min). (a) XRD signal intensity from 2θ = 5° to 15° showing the disappearance of INT-W and appearance of PVK. (b) Conversion of INT-W (blue) to PVK (purple) plotted for the diffraction peak of PVK (14.0°) against temperature and time. The gradual increase of the peak intensity of PVK after termination of the reaction at 40 °C can be ascribed to Ostwald ripening of PVK crystals. (c) % peak intensity relative to the initial state (i.e., reaction progress) of INT-W (light blue), INT-F2 (green), and INT-S (purple); ((MA+)2·[(PbI3−)2PbI2]·(DMSO)2) to PVK against temperature.	 

 	Fig. 3  2-D XRD patterns observed during dehydration/hydration cycles for INT-W and PVK. (a) A single-crystal fiber of INT-W. (b) PVK fiber obtained by heating INT-W at 100 °C. (c) INT-W obtained by the hydration of PVK fiber with moist nitrogen. (d) PVK fiber obtained by a second heating at 100 °C.	 

 	Fig. 4  Crystal structures of INT-W and PVK, and atom-to-atom mapping of their interconversion. Atomic distances in Å in crystallographic structures. (Top panel) (a) PI (ref. 30). (b) INT-W (ref. 27) seen approximately along the b-axis (=fiber axis). Only two Pb sequences are shown for clarity. (c) PVK (top view). (d) PVK (side view). (Bottom panel) (e) Topological illustration from PI to INT-W. (f) INT-W in (b) projected onto the cubic lattice of PVK in (c). The polymer chains extend along the b-axis perpendicular to the plane of the paper. Dinuclear strips move along the red arrows to form PVK. (g) PVK crystal lattice correlated with INT-W in (c). Red arrows illustrate the conversion to INT-W. (h) Top view of (g). The (110) normal = the b-axis of INT-W (=the fiber axis).	 

 	Fig. 5  Volume changes during the conversion between an intermediate containing water, DMF, and DMSO (INT-W, -F2, and -S) and PVK. The volumes are calculated from lattice constants measured at 20 °C.	 

 	Fig. 6  SEM images of fibrous PVK prepared from different intermediates. (a) PVK from INT-W. (b) PVK from INT-F2. (c) PVK from INT-S.	 

 	Fig. 7  The pathways involved in the formation of PVK from INT-F2 or INT-S, or the decomposition of PVK to PI in the presence of a trace amount of water as illustrated by the reaction in moist DMF.
