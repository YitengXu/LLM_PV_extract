    , Accepted 12th August 2014First published on 12th August 2014AbstractIn the present work, we report the enhanced electrochemical performance of ball milled CoO nanoparticles for supercapacitor applications. The mechanical ball milling provides clean physical processes to prepare nanoparticles from CoO micropowders for excellent electrochemical performances. The performances of CoO samples at different milling times have been researched. With the increase of milling time the specific capacitance of CoO samples increases. The average size of CoO nanoparticles which have been milled for 96 h is estimated to be 5–20 nm by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis showing clear edges having superior boundary crystallinity. This clear edge superior boundary crystalline shape favours rapid electron and ion transport. The electrochemical behaviour is analyzed in a three electrode system using 1 M KOH solution as the electrolyte in terms of cyclic voltammetry, cyclic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectra. The CoO nanoparticle electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 600 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 constant discharge current density. The high specific capacitance and the stability of the CoO nanoparticle electrode are attributed to good crystallinity and large specific surface area. The specific capacity retention is 96.6% at a current density of 2 A g−1 and 95.3% at a current density of 4 A g−1 over 2000 charge–discharge cycles. The excellent cyclic stability indicates that nanocrystalline CoO is an excellent supercapacitor electrode material.
Introduction
The increasing demand for energy in the 21st century has triggered tremendous research efforts for energy storage and conversion from clean and renewable energy sources. Electrochemical capacitors (ECs)/supercapacitors have recently attracted great interest from researchers because of their high power densities, long lifespan and good pulse charge–discharge characteristics.1 Their ability to rapidly store and release electrical energy at high power densities and with high rate capabilities makes them promising candidates for energy storage. The electrochemical capacitors are divided mainly into two categories: electrical double layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors. Supercapacitors can store energy at the electrode–electrolyte interface, which involves the physical separation of opposite charges and are typically called electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). EDLCs mainly comprise carbon materials with high surface area such as activated carbon, carbon nanotube, graphene, etc. Another method for charge storage in supercapacitors involves the redox reactions occurring in the electrode material, such capacitors are known as pseudocapacitors.2 The faradaic current across the supercapacitor cell during the reversal processes of charging and discharging not only increases the specific capacitance but also extends the operating voltage of the supercapacitor.3 Thus, transition metal oxides and hydroxides of ruthenium, manganese, vanadium, tin, nickel and cobalt with pseudocapacitive behaviors are of great interest in applications as electrode materials for pseudocapacitors.4–14
Cobalt-based oxides and hydroxides are attractive pseudocapacitive electrode materials because of their high electroactivity and easy processing.15–27 Co3O4 and Co(OH)2 have very high theoretical specific capacitances larger than 3000 F g−1 (ref. 17 and 28) even considering only the faradic processes. But it is difficult to approach the theoretical value, fundamentally due to limited ion diffusion within the conventionally dense electrode film and high insulating behaviour to support fast electron transport between the electrolyte and electroactive species. Therefore, they are not fully engaged in the electrochemical reactions, hence, it is imperative to enhance the electrical conductivity of cobalt-based materials above specific values for practical applications. Good crystallinity and oxygen vacancies caused by the surface defects can also enhance the electrical conductivity in transition metal oxide. The first few nanometers at the surface are thus very important for charge-storage in pseudocapacitors because these nanostructured materials are capable of enhanced kinetics and activity due to their higher specific surface area and shorter pathways for electron and ion transport in comparison with their bulk counterparts.3 Therefore, the development of nanostructured cobalt-based materials with different morphologies undoubtedly provides a promising solution to ameliorate the electrochemical performance of cobalt-based electrode materials.
Cobalt monoxide (CoO), another kind of cobalt oxide, has high electrochemical activity in lithium ion battery application.29–31 CoO nanoparticles in the 5–10 nm range have lower band gap than the bulk and can carry out overall water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of around 5%.32 As mentioned above nanotechnology has been regarded as an important means to modify a material's electrochemical properties. Nevertheless, it is still considered to be a substantive challenge to synthesize cobalt monoxide electrode materials with desirable nanostructure, crystallinity and electrical conductivity. Therefore, to prepare nanostructured CoO having high specific capacitance is of vital importance for future energy storage devices.
There are some reports about the supercapacitor performance of CoO nanowires and their composites.28,33–35 However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few reports on the preparation of CoO nanoparticles with small size of less than 20 nm. In this paper, we have successfully synthesized CoO nanoparticles in the range of 5–20 nm. As mentioned above it is imperative to enhance the electrical conductivity of cobalt-based materials above specific values for practical application. Good crystallinity can enhance the electrical conductivity in transition metal oxide. So in this work good crystallinity CoO cubic micropowders were first treated by a chemical vapor deposition process, and then mechanical ball milling was performed to increase the specific surface area to get CoO nanoparticles. The first few nanometers at the surface are very important for charge-storage in pseudocapacitors so that CoO nanoparticles are capable of enhanced kinetics and activity due to their higher specific surface area and shorter pathways for electron and ion transport in comparison with their bulk counterparts. The performances of CoO samples at different milling times have been researched. We found that with the increase of milling time the specific capacitance of CoO samples increases. The specific capacitance of the CoO sample which has been milled for 96 h is the highest. The mechanical ball milling provides clean physical processes to prepare CoO nanoparticles from CoO micropowders for excellent electrochemical performance. The high specific capacitance of the supercapacitor fabricated from the CoO nanoparticle electrode is attributed to good crystallinity and large specific surface area.
Electrochemical analysis was carried out by a three electrode system in a 1 M KOH electrolyte in terms of cyclic voltammetry, cyclic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectra using these ball-milled CoO nanoparticles as the electrode. To avoid side reaction between the electrochemically active substrate (such as nickel foam/plate) and the electrolyte, graphite rod electrode was employed as the current collector.
Experimental
Synthesis of CoO nanoparticles
The CoO powders (Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99.99%, size < 10 μm) were placed in an alumina boat at the centre of a horizontal tube furnace at 1000 °C in a high purity N2 environment. The alumina tube was evacuated using a mechanical rotary pump to ∼50 mTorr after loading CoO powders. N2 gas flow was adjusted at 250 sccm to fill the tube to ambient pressure; the pressure inside the furnace tube was maintained at 1 atm throughout the experiment. The temperature was increased to 800 °C from room temperature (25 °C) in 1 h and from 800 °C to 1000 °C in 2 h. The furnace was then kept at 1000 °C for 10 h and then cooled at the following rates: 1000 °C to 900 °C in 1/2 h and 900 °C to room temperature in 10 h. After this process, the commercial amorphous CoO powders turned to cubic CoO micropowders. The CoO micropowders were subsequently homogenized by using a planetary ball mill (Vario-Planetary Mill Pulverisette 4, FRITSCH). 10 g of CoO micropowders was placed into a stainless steel vial, 100 g of stainless balls of 5 mm in diameter was added and closed by a lid equipped with two needle valves enabling argon purge and creation of the oversaturated Ar atmosphere in the vial. Argon was purged for 1 h initially. The milling cycle was set to 35 min at 800 rpm followed by a pause of 15 min. The CoO micropowders were ball milled for 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h to get different samples. After ball milling for 96 h the cubic CoO micropowders were turned to CoO nanoparticles.
Structural and morphological characterizations
The sample was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800), X-ray Diffraction (XRD Philips X'Pert Pro MPD), using a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 0.154 nm), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific, Escalab250Xi), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Tecnai F20, FEI, NED). N2 adsorption–desorption was determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements using a 3H-2000PS2 Automated Surface Area Analyzer (Beishide Instrument-S&T (Beijing), CHN).
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode system at an electrochemical station (Zahner Im6e Germany) for cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) tests. The cycling performance test was carried out with a CT2001D tester (Wuhan, China). The active material CoO (30 mg), activated carbon and Nafion solution (5 wt%) were mixed in the 80:15:5 ratio. The mixture was dispersed in 10 mL water–ethanol solution with a volume ratio of 3:1 by sonification for 2 h to form a homogeneous paste. Then 100 μL of the dispersion (containing 0.3 mg of the active CoO) was loaded onto a graphite rod (Alfa Aesar, 99.9995%) electrode having 6.15 mm diameter (1 mg the active material CoO cm−2 of the graphite rod). A series of electrochemical tests was performed with the working electrode, including the CV, EIS and galvanostatic charge–discharge in 1 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte, using Hg/HgCl (in saturated KCl solution) electrode as the reference electrode, platinum as the counter electrode, and a graphite rod as the working electrode.
The cyclic voltammetry measurements of the CoO nanoparticle electrode were performed at different scan rates in a potential window of −0.01 V to 0.49 V. The charge–discharge measurements were performed at different current densities in a potential window of −0.01 V to 0.49 V. Impedance measurements were carried out between 0.01 Hz and 100 kHz.
Specific capacitance was calculated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge curve according to the following equation: (1)where I (A) is the discharge current, m (g) is the active material mass, Δt (s) is the discharge time, ΔV (V) is the discharge potential, and C (F g−1) is the specific capacitance.
Results and discussion
Characterization of CoO nanoparticles

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of all the CoO samples prepared at different milling times. All the CoO samples revealed well-resolved diffraction peaks at 36.5°, 42.4°, 61.5°, 73.7°and 77.8°, which can be indexed as (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes corresponding to the cubic phase of CoO (JCPDS 75-0393). No additional peaks were observed, indicating the high degree of purity of the CoO prepared in this work. With the increase of milling time, the XRD peak of CoO samples is obviously broader than that of cubic CoO micropowders, indicating that the CoO nanoparticles are more smaller as compared to cubic CoO micropowders.

The average crystallite size (D) of all samples was calculated using the Debye–Scherer formula using the equation: D = Kλ/(βcosθ)(2)where D is the crystallite size, K = 0.9, λ is the wavelength of the Kα component of the employed copper radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm), β is the corrected full width at half maximum (FWHM) and θ is Bragg's angle. The average crystallite size of the CoO samples is shown in Table 1.

The composition and electronic states of the prepared CoO nanoparticles (milling for 96 h) were further examined by XPS. The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 2a) indicates the presence of Co and O as well as C from the reference. The Co 2p peak is further examined by high-resolution XPS (Fig. 2b). The peak at 780.3 eV is from Co 2p3/2, with a shakeup at 789.0 eV, while the peak at 796.0 eV is caused by Co 2p1/2, with a peak at 805.6 eV. The presence of those two highly intense peaks is consistent with the presence of Co2+ in the high-spin state.36 The absence of a signal at 778.1 eV indicates the nonexistence of Co metal impurities. These XPS results demonstrate that nanoparticles are pure phase CoO.

To provide further insights into the morphology and structure on the CoO particles, SEM and TEM investigations were carried out. Fig. 3a shows the SEM image of CoO micropowders indicating that the average size is about 1 μm. Fig. 3b indicates that after ball milling for 96 h the cubic CoO micropowders were turned to CoO nanoparticles.

Fig. 4a shows the typical bright-field TEM images of the CoO nanoparticles (milling for 96 h). From the low aggregation of CoO nanoparticles in Fig. 4b we can see that the average particle size is about 5–20 nm. The high crystalline quality of nanoparticles is confirmed by clear lattice fringes in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images shown in Fig. 4b demonstrating the single crystalline nature. The clear edges indicate their superior boundary crystallinity which favors rapid electron and ion transport. The obvious crystalline lattice with a distance of 0.24 nm (Fig. 4c) matches well with the lattice spacing of the cubic CoO (111) plane. The highly clear crystal lattice as well as the corresponding well-ordered dot pattern of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) image in the inset in Fig. 4c demonstrates the high-quality single-crystalline nature of CoO.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the CoO nanoparticles (milling for 96 h) and micropowders is presented in Fig. 5. The obtained BET specific surface area of the CoO nanoparticles is 40.52 m2 g−1, which is much larger than the CoO micropowders (1.88 m2 g−1). The BET test results indicate that the specific surface area of CoO samples can be increased by mechanical ball milling. This larger specific surface area can increase the electrode–electrolyte contact area and provide sufficient active sites for the Faraday reaction and efficient transport of electrons and ions.

Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties of CoO samples at different milling times were first delineated using galvanostatic charge–discharge curves. Fig. 6a shows the charge–discharge curves of CoO samples in 1 M aqueous KOH using a three electrode cell in a potential window of −0.01 V to 0.49 V at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Fig. 6b shows the specific capacitance changes of the CoO samples in different milling time electrodes at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The specific capacitances of CoO sample electrodes (which has been milled for 96 h, 72 h, 48 h, 24 h, 12 h and 0 h) are 600 F g−1, 410 F g−1, 258 F g−1, 183 F g−1, 103 F g−1 and 60 F g−1, respectively. We can see obviously that with the increase of milling time the specific capacitance of CoO samples increases. The specific capacitance of CoO samples which has been milled for 96 h is the highest.

(b) Specific capacitance changes of the CoO samples in different milling time electrodes at a current density of 0.5 A g−1.

(e) Last ten charge–discharge curves of the CoO nanoparticle (milling for 96 h) electrode within a potential window of −0.01 to 0.49 V and at a current density of 2 A g−1. (f) Specific capacitance changes of the CoO nanoparticle (milling for 96 h) electrode in the range of current density from 0.5 to 16 A g−1. 

Fig. 6c shows the charge–discharge curves of CoO nanoparticles (milling 96 h) in 1 M aqueous KOH using a three electrode cell in a potential window of −0.01 V to 0.49 V at current densities of 0.5 A g−1, 1 A g−1, 2 A g−1, 3 A g−1, 4 A g−1, 8 A g−1, 12 A g−1 and 16 A g−1. The specific capacitance of the CoO nanoparticle electrode are 600, 594, 584, 544, 520, 488, 456 and 416 F g−1 at current densities of 0.5 A g−1, 1 A g−1, 2 A g−1, 3 A g−1, 4 A g−1, 8 A g−1, 12 A g−1 and 16 A g−1, respectively. These values are higher than those of Co3O4 nanoparticles (519 F g−1, 0.5 A g−1 on graphite sheet)37 and Co(OH)2 (416 F g−1, 1 A g−1 on glassy carbon).38 Compared with CoO wire, these values are higher than the bare CoO samples in ref. 34 (518.9 F g−1, 2.77 A g−1) and ref. 35 (307 F g−1, 4.55 A g−1). Although a high specific capacitance of CoO on the nickel foam substrate was achieved in some reports, using the nickel foam side reaction between the active nickel foam and the active material can contribute to the specific capacitance. Thus results reported have no guarantee if contributions from nickel have been avoided as a result of side reaction.
The CoO nanoparticles due to the large specific surface area and good crystalline properties help better diffusion of ions compared to other morphologies and result in the higher specific capacitance. Besides, the good crystalline nature also improved the conductivity of CoO nanoparticles, resulting in increased specific capacitance.

Fig. 6d shows the long term cycling stability of the CoO nanoparticle (milling for 96 h) electrode upon charge–discharge for 2000 cycles at the current densities of 2 A g−1 and 4 A g−1. The discharge time for the 2000th cycle is very close to that for the 1st discharge at both current densities, which proves the excellent capacitance retention of the CoO nanoparticle electrode. Fig. 6e shows the last ten (10) charge–discharge curves of the CoO nanoparticle (milling for 96 h) electrode within a potential window of −0.01 V to 0.49 V and at the current density of 2 A g−1.
The specific capacitance is 584 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 for the 1st cycle and 564 F g−1 for the 2000th cycle, which shows the high cycling stability of the CoO nanoparticle electrode. Similarly, the CoO nanoparticle electrode maintains a high specific capacitance even at a higher current density of 4 A g−1, where it is 520 F g−1 for the 1st cycle and 496 F g−1 for the 2000th cycle. The efficiency of the CoO nanoparticle electrode decreases from 100% to 96.6% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1 and to 95.3% at a current density of 4 A g−1. These values are higher than those of Co(OH)2 (93% after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1).38 Compared with CoO wire, these values are higher than the bare CoO sample (95.1% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 4.55 A g−1).35 This demonstrates the high stability of the CoO nanoparticle electrode. The high stability of the CoO nanoparticle electrode is the result of two reasons: firstly, the high crystal quality of the nanoparticles. Secondly, in reversible electrochemical reactions, Co2+ transform to Co3+ during the oxidation and Co3+ transform to Co2+ during the reduction within a voltage window of −0.01 to 0.49 V. This kind of reaction causes high stability of the CoO nanoparticle electrode in charge–discharge cycles because of only electrons rather than molecules involved in the reaction.
The changes of the specific capacitance of the CoO nanoparticle (milling for 96 h) electrode in the range of current density from 0.5 to 16 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 6f. The specific capacitance of the CoO nanoparticle electrode reduces from 600 F g−1 to 416 F g−1 at progressively increasing current densities from 0.5 A g−1 to 16 A g−1. As the current density increases to 16 A g−1, the specific capacitance is as high as 416 F g−1, retaining ∼69.3%. That is because CoO nanoparticles with a large specific surface area and more active sites have better diffusion of ions for the electrochemical reaction in the surface redox process.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis has been performed in the potential range of −0.01 to 0.49 V, using 1 M KOH as the electrolyte. Fig. 7a shows the CV curves of the CoO nanoparticle (milling for 96 h) electrode at different scan rates ranging from 5–100 mV s−1. Apparently, all curves exhibit a similar shape, and the current density increases with the increasing scan rate. The inset shows the CV curve of the graphite rod at 5 mV s−1, if we compare the CV curve of the graphite rod with that of the CoO nanoparticle electrode, it is obvious that the contribution of the graphite rod to the capacitance value is very small, which can be ignored.
 Fig. 7  (a) Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CoO nanoparticle (milling for 96 h) electrode at different scan rates (inset shows the CV curve of the graphite rod at 5 mV s−1). (b) Nyquist plot of the CoO nanoparticle (milling for 96 h) electrode (inset shows the Nyquist plot at the high frequency region). 
One quasi-reversible electron transfer process takes place, which is displayed in every curve, showing that the measured capacitance is mainly based on the redox mechanism. Furthermore, the fast reversible successive surface redox reactions define the behaviour of the voltammogram, whose shape is close to that of the EDLCs and similar to the report of Co(OH)2 (on glassy carbon).37 The absence of palpable peaks in the voltammogram indicates that the pseudocapacitive mechanism is only in electronic transmission. In reversible electrochemical reactions, Co2+ transform to Co3+ during the oxidation and Co3+ transform to Co2+ during the reduction within a voltage window of −0.01 to 0.49 V. This kind of reaction causes high stability of the CoO nanoparticle electrode in charge–discharge cycles because of only electrons rather than molecules involved in the reaction. The oxidation and reduction circles in the voltammogram of the electrode material corresponding to anodic and cathodic scans are not symmetric. This arises due to kinetic irreversibility of the redox process. The phenomenon can also be due to ohmic resistance and polarization because of the diffusion of electrolyte ions in the electrode during the redox reactions. The charge storage arises from the following redox equation: 4CoO + 4OH− ↔ 2H2O + 2Co2O3 + 4e−(3)
High specific capacitance with low electronic resistance is the preferred quality of a pseudocapacitance electrode material. To further elucidate the origin of high electrochemical performance, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the CoO nanoparticle (milling for 96 h) electrode was analyzed at a potential of 0.4 V, applying 5 mV ac voltage in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7b, the impedance spectra are composed of one semicircle at high frequency and a linear part at low frequency, which illustrates typical capacitor behaviour.
The experimental data are fitted according to the equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 7b, where Rs includes (the intrinsic resistance of the electroactive material, the contact resistance at the interface between the electroactive material and the current collector and the resistance of electrolyte solution), Rct is the charge transfer resistance, CPE1 is the double layer capacitance, CPE2 is the pseudocapacitance, and “W” is the Warburg impedance. The simulated values of the sample are shown in Table 2.

At the high frequency region, the intercept on the real axis is the solution resistance (Rs) of the CoO nanoparticle electrode and is measured to be 3.99 Ω, while the charge-transfer resistance Rct is calculated to be 0.88 Ω. This clearly demonstrates the low charge transfer resistance of the CoO nanoparticle electrode during the redox reaction for energy storage. In addition, the charge-transfer resistance Rct, also called faradaic resistance, is a limiting factor for the specific power of the supercapacitor. It is the low faradaic resistance that results in the high specific power of the CoO nanoparticle electrode. The slope of the impedance plot almost tends to quasi vertical lines leaning to the imaginary axis at the low frequency region (the curve has a phase angle of 76.2° with the real axis which is larger than the typical Warburg angle of 45°), which corresponds to the sample that exhibits low Warburg impedance. This indicates the more facile ion or electrolyte diffusion to the surface of the electrode and more ideal electrochemical capacitor behaviour. Although the intrinsic conductivity of the CoO nanoparticles is good, the internal resistance (Rs) of the electrode is around 3.99 Ω. This phenomenon is because the electrode is composed of many small CoO nanoparticles, electron transport between small CoO nanoparticles during the electrochemical reactions causes the high contact resistance.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized the CoO nanoparticles. The prepared nanoparticles exhibit high specific surface area and good crystallinity. The specific capacitances of electrodes containing CoO nanoparticles which have been milled for 96 h are 600, 594, 584, 544, 520, 488, 456 and 416 F g−1 at current densities of 0.5 A g−1, 1 A g−1, 2 A g−1, 3 A g−1, 4 A g−1, 8 A g−1, 12 A g−1 and 16 A g−1, respectively. The CoO nanoparticles (milling for 96 h) due to their large specific surface area and good crystalline nature help better diffusion of ions and result in the higher capacitance than others. Good crystalline properties of CoO nanoparticles also cause high stability of the CoO nanoparticle electrode, with a specific capacitance retention of 96.6% over 2000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1 and 95.3% at a current density of 4 A g−1. The excellent cyclic stability of the CoO nanoparticles enables their excellent performance as a superior electrode material for the supercapacitor for energy storage applications.
