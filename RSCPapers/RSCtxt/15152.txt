    , Accepted 18th March 2019First published on 19th March 2019AbstractA ternary blend by introducing a third component into a binary blend for a polymer solar cell (PSC) is a promising strategy because the light absorption, morphology, and carrier transport of the active layer as well as energy level alignment of the donor and the acceptor may be optimized. In this work, a nonfullerene acceptor IDIC and its fluorinated acceptor ID4F were selected to combine with a PBDB-T-SF donor in the construction of ternary blends. The as-cast ternary PSCs can achieve a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.52% than the IDIC (9.39%) and ID4F (10.35%) based binary PSCs. The enhanced PCEs of the ternary PSCs are based on the higher electron mobility, more balanced charge transport, and optimized phase separation. Moreover, the ternary PSCs also show good thickness tolerance with a PCE > 10% from 85 to 250 nm and better shelf stability than the two binary PSCs. Our results indicate that mixing a nonfullerene acceptor and its fluorinated counterpart with the closest structural similarity to form a ternary blend is a valuable strategy to improve photovoltaic performances.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages of light weight, flexibility, low cost, and easy-processing.1–5 Recently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction BHJ PSCs have exceeded 14%.6–11 Typically, an active layer of a BHJ PSC is composed of one electron donor and one electron acceptor, and this type PSC is called as a binary PSC. Correspondingly, the addition of another component in the binary material system can afford a ternary active layer, giving a ternary PSC. Obviously, one donor in combination with two acceptors, a case of 1D/2A, and two donors in combination with one acceptor, a case of 2D/1A, are the possible selection options for a ternary active blend film.12 Using a ternary blend film as the active layer has some advantages such as better complementary light absorption, a more easily controlled morphology, and more suitable energy level alignment, which endows a ternary PSC with high potential to show a higher PCE than the corresponding binary PSCs.13–28
A 1D/2A ternary blend film has several selection options for the two acceptors, including two fullerenes, one fullerene and one nonfullerene, and two nonfullerene pairs. For example, a pair of two fullerenes based on ICBA and PC71BM has been investigated to construct 1D/2A ternary blend films.16 Recently, nonfullerene acceptors have received much attention because of their high light absorption ability, adjustable energy level, lower cost, and better morphological stability.29–33 The fast development of nonfullerene acceptors not only boosts the PCE to a much higher level than a fullerene acceptor, but also provides plentiful selection options to construct effective 1D/2A ternary blend films based on a one fullerene and one nonfullerene pair6,8,15,17–19 as well as a two nonfullerene pair. It should be noted that much more attention has been paid to 1D/2A ternary blends based on two nonfullerene acceptors in the past several years.10,11,21,23–25,34–40 Particularly, the selection of two nonfullerene acceptors with structural similarity, such as IT2Cl:IT4Cl,10 ITCPTC:MeIC,11 and ITIC:IT-M,36 has shown notable advantage in optimizing phase separation because of compatibility.
Fluorination on nonfullerene acceptors, with the aim of providing lower-lying energy levels and enhancing crystallinity, has been widely investigated, from which improved exciton dissociation and increased electron transport may be achieved in the improvement of PCEs. IT4F,32 IEICO-4F,41 INPIC-4F,42 IDTOT2F,43 IDT2Se-4F,44 FOIC,45 and so on46–56 are the important examples. Therefore, the combination of a nonfullerene acceptor with its fluorinated counterpart for a new 1D/2A ternary blend would be a convenient strategy because the widely accepted cascade energy level alignment for a ternary blend can be readily achieved. Moreover, the geometry difference between a nonfullerene acceptor and its fluorinated counterpart is the smallest because the atom radius of fluorine is very close to that of hydrogen. In this study, a novel donor PBDB-T-SF32 and a highly efficient acceptor IDIC29 was selected as the host system while ID4F,57 an acceptor with four fluorine atoms on the IDIC, was selected as the third component (Fig. 1a). The PBDB-T-SF:IDIC:ID4F ternary blends showed notable PCEs up to 11.52%, obviously higher than those of the PBDB-T-SF:IDIC (9.39%) and PBDB-T-SF:ID4F (10.35%) binary blends in PSCs. The improved efficiency by the ternary blend film was mainly contributed by an improved fill factor (FF) of 74.35%, resulting from the highest electron mobility, more balanced hole and electron transport, and better BHJ morphology. More importantly, the ternary PSCs also displayed good thickness tolerance with PCEs > 10% in an active layer thickness range from 85 to 250 nm. Although many 2D/1A ternary blends and some 1D/2A ternary blends with a fullerene:nonfullerene pair have shown notable improvements of thickness tolerances (Table S1 in the ESI†),19,58 our result is a rare example for ternary PSCs with two nonfullerene acceptors that can show PCEs > 10% at the 250 nm thickness. It is believed that a thickness-insensitive PCE is more suitable for large area and roll-to-roll production in terms of yield control.15,19,27,28,59,60 Our results indicate that mixing a nonfullerene acceptor and its fluorinated counterpart with the closest structural similarity to form a ternary blend is a valuable strategy to improve photovoltaic performances.

Results and discussion
The chemical structures of PBDB-T-SF, IDIC, and ID4F are shown in Fig. 1a, and their energy level alignment is shown in Fig. 1b. The similar structure of IDIC and ID4F is beneficial to optimize the phase morphology due to their good compatibility. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the PBDB-T-SF donor are −5.40 and −3.60 eV, respectively.32 The HOMO and LUMO levels of −5.66 and −3.93 eV for the IDIC acceptor as well as −5.72 and −4.05 eV for the ID4F acceptor, respectively, were obtained via cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements under the same conditions (Fig. S1†). Relative to IDIC, ID4F shows lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels because of the fluorination effect on IDIC. With the three components to construct the ternary blend, a cascade energy level alignment can be realized, which is beneficial for charge transport.24,34,40
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDB-T-SF, IDIC, and ID4F are shown in Fig. 1c. The main absorption of PBDB-T-SF is in the region of 300–700 nm, while the IDIC and ID4F show strong absorptions in a range from 500 to 800 nm. The measured absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2a. It can be found that the binary and ternary blend films display similar absorptions, with a peak around 630 nm and another peak around 710 nm corresponding to the main absorptions of PBDB-T-SF and IDIC:ID4F, respectively. Generally, the binary blend films of PBDB-T-SF:IDIC and PBDB-T-SF:ID4F as well as the ternary blend film of PBDB-T-SF:IDIC:ID4F all can exhibit complementary absorptions from 300 to 800 nm.

We fabricated the PSC devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Al, where an alcohol-soluble small molecule PDIN film (10 nm) was the electron selection layer for the Al cathode. A D:A ratio of 1:1 was set for all the active layers in the PSCs, where no solvent additive and no post treatment were applied. The measurements of the as-cast PSCs were carried out under illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. With different ID4F contents in the active layers, the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), FF, and PCEs of the devices are summarized in Table 1. For the active layer with 40 wt% ID4F, the ternary PSCs can reach the best PCE of 11.52%, with an average PCE of 11.18%. The 11.52% PCE of the ternary PSC is obviously higher than 9.39% and 10.35% for the binary PBDB-T-SF:IDIC and PBDB-T-SF:ID4F devices, corresponding to efficiency increases of 22% and 11%, respectively. The curves for current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the binary PSCs and the optimized ternary PSC are shown in Fig. 2b and c, respectively. Based on the EQE spectra, the calculated integrated Jsc values of the IDIC binary, ID4F binary, and IDIC:ID4F (60:40) ternary PSCs are 14.59, 16.54, and 15.94 mA cm−2, which are in good agreements with those obtained from the J–V measurement, showing small variations less than 6% between the two sets of data.

Among the binary and ternary PSCs, the IDIC binary active layer shows the highest Voc of 0.980 V but the lowest Jsc and FF of 15.29 mA cm−2 and 62.65%, respectively, while the ID4F binary active layer displays the lowest Voc of 0.820 V, and a high Jsc and FF of 17.42 mA cm−2 and 72.47%, respectively. For the IDIC:ID4F ternary PSCs (Fig. 2d), increasing the content of ID4F results in a monotonous decrease of Voc, an increase of Jsc to a maximum with 70% ID4F, and a maximum FF of 74.35% with 40% ID4F. As a result, the IDIC:ID4F (60:40) ternary PSCs exhibit the best PCE of 11.52%, based on a moderate Voc of 0.917 V, a fairly high Jsc of 16.89 mA cm−2, and a highest FF of 74.35%.
For an organic active layer, the Voc value of a PSC strongly depends on the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor. Relative to the LUMO level of −3.93 eV for the IDIC, the ID4F shows a lower LUMO of −4.05 eV, endowing the ID4F binary device with a lower Voc. For the IDIC:ID4F ternary PSCs, the observed decrease of Voc along with a higher ID4F content should be mainly due to the down-shift of the measured LUMO levels of the IDIC:ID4F acceptors because of a similar trend for the Voc and the LUMO levels (Fig. 3a). It should be noted that both of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the IDIC:ID4F acceptors could be obtained from the CV measurements (Fig. S1†), where the oxidation and reduction potential onsets of the IDIC:ID4F acceptors were thus obtained. The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of the acceptor blends are listed in Table S2.† By the way, with the increase of the ID4F content, the HOMO levels of the IDIC:ID4F acceptors decreased, suggesting a minimal change of the electrochemical band gap of the IDIC:ID4F acceptors (Fig. 3a). We speculate that the IDIC:ID4F blends may form acceptor alloys.

To further confirm the formation of the acceptor alloy, we carried out differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis (Fig. S2†).23,34 Under heating, IDIC, ID4F, and two IDIC:ID4F blends all can show endothermic transitions, which correspond to their melting processes. The IDIC and ID4F solids display melting transitions at 275 and 283 °C, respectively. The melting peaks for the IDIC:ID4F blend solids of 0.6:0.4 and 0.3:0.7 move to lower temperatures of ∼272 °C. The results suggest that the IDIC:ID4F blends can form acceptor alloys.23 It should be noted that several acceptor alloys have been reported before.37,39
We also calculated the surface energies of IDIC, ID4F, IDIC:ID4F (0.6:0.4), and PBDB-T-SF films, according to the Wu model.61 As shown in Fig. S3,† the water contact angles of IDIC, IDIC:ID4F (60:40), and ID4F are 86.8°, 87.7° and 88.4°, all lower than that of 96.3° for the donor polymer PBDB-T-SF. A similar trend can be found when using another organic liquid CH2I2. The contact angle information is summarized in Table S3.† The surface energies of IDIC and ID4F are comparable being 44.37 and 43.31 mJ m−2, respectively. The IDIC:ID4F blend film also displays an intermediate surface energy of 43.80 mJ m−2, suggesting good compatibility between the two acceptors.
To better understand the charge generation and extraction properties of the optimized ternary and binary PSCs, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the PSCs (Fig. 3b). Generally, Jph can be defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. The Veff follows the formula of Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which the Jph = 0 and Vbias is the applied bias voltage. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Jph is saturated when the Veff is about 3 V, and the maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax) can be calculated from the equation Jsat = q × L × Gmax, where Jsat is the saturated photocurrent density, q is the elementary charge, and L is the thickness of the active layer (Table S4†). Assuming the same thickness for all the active layers, Gmax is linearly dependent on the Jsat. Compared with a Gmax value of 1.01 × 1028 m−3 s−1 for the ternary PSCs, the IDIC based binary PSCs exhibit a lower Gmax value (0.91 × 1028 m−3 s−1) while the ID4F based binary PSCs display a higher Gmax value (1.04 × 1028 m−3 s−1). It can be found that the Gmax for the ternary PSCs is closer to that of the ID4F binary PSCs. In addition, the exciton dissociation probabilities P(E,T) can be calculated from the equation P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat. We calculated the P(E,T) of the binary PSCs and the optimized ternary PSCs under short-circuit conditions (Vbias = 0). The P(E,T) values of the IDIC, IDIC:ID4F (60:40), and ID4F based PSCs are 93.51%, 94.02%, and 95.85%, respectively. Therefore, the incorporation of ID4F can increase the exciton generation rates and exciton dissociation probabilities, which endows the ternary PSCs with a higher Jsc compared with the IDIC based binary devices.
The J–V curves under different light intensities were also measured to understand the charge recombination mechanism in the devices. The Jsc dependence on the light intensity is described in Fig. 3c. The relationship between the light intensity (Plight) and Jsc agrees with the formula of Jsc ∝ PlightS. The exponent S values for the IDIC based binary PSCs, the ternary PSCs, and the ID4F based binary PSCs are 0.975, 0.977 and 0.978, respectively. The obtained S values suggest that the bimolecular recombination of the devices is comparable.
The charge carrier mobilities (μ) of the binary devices and ternary devices were investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/Al/active layer/Ca/Al, respectively. The J1/2–V characteristics of the hole-only and electron-only devices are shown in Fig. 4, and the mobilities are summarized in Table 2. The μh and μe of the PBDB-T-SF:IDIC binary PSCs are 1.89 × 10−4 and 0.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The PBDB-T-SF:ID4F binary PSCs exhibit a higher μh of 3.70 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an almost similar μe of 1.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. After incorporation of ID4F in the PBDB-T-SF:IDIC binary PSCs, the ternary PSCs show an increased μh of 2.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the highest μe of 2.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, giving a μh/μe of 0.77. For the IDIC:ID4F (60:40) ternary device, its highest μe and more balanced charge transport are the important factors that can contribute to the highest FF of 74.35% among all the PSCs.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed to investigate the morphology of the binary and ternary blend films. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, the IDIC based binary blend film exhibits a very low root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.99 nm and a small phase separation, which is beneficial for charge dissociation but may also affect charge transport. Indeed, the IDIC based binary blend film shows the lowest μe and FF. It should be noted that the devices also show the largest Voc and the smallest Jsc, suggesting that the energy level offsets between PBDB-T-SF and IDIC may not be as optimal as expected to fully utilize the generated excitons. It should be pointed out that, because of the smallest Jsc of the IDIC based PSCs, not only exciton dissociation but also exciton generation are affected, given the larger optical bandgap of IDIC compared to ID4F (Fig. 1c). The ID4F based binary blend film belongs to another extreme case. Its lower-lying HOMO and LUMO levels relative to IDIC should have improved the exciton dissociation. The ID4F based binary blend film also possesses a rough surface with a large RMS value of 3.41 nm and a large phase separation that is beneficial for charge transport (Fig. 5c and f). However, the Voc of the ID4F based binary PSCs is the lowest among the three kinds of devices. It should be noted that the quite different morphologies of the two binary blend films are related to the intrinsic solid-state properties of IDIC and ID4F molecules. The RMS value (10.4 nm) of the ID4F neat film is much larger than that of 2.99 nm for the IDIC neat film (Fig. S4†), suggesting that ID4F possesses a stronger molecular aggregation ability. Generally, the IDIC:ID4F (60:40) ternary blend film (Fig. 5b and e) displays an intermediate morphology (RMS = 1.57 nm) between the two binary blend films, which may combine the advantages of the two binary blend films. Moreover, the change of the IDIC:ID4F ratio also provides a chance to optimize the energy levels, which finally gives an optimized balance between Voc and Jsc based on the IDIC:ID4F (60:40) blend film. The highest FF and μe achieved by the ternary blend film in the meantime suggest that the ternary blend film should possess an optimal phase separation and the ID4F may act as a morphology modifier to enhance the phase separation of the IDIC based binary blend film.

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) was utilized to characterize the molecular ordering and orientation of the pristine PBDB-T-SF, IDIC, and ID4F and the relevant binary and ternary blend films. The line-cut profiles for out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions are summarized in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. For the PBDB-T-SF pristine film, an obvious (100) peak at 0.31 Å−1 and a weak (010) peak at 1.79 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a (100) peak at 0.27 Å−1 in the IP direction can be observed, indicating that PBDB-T-SF chains mainly adopt a face-on orientation. For the IDIC pristine film, a (100) peak at 0.19 Å−1 and a (010) peak at 1.73 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a (100) peak at 0.23 Å−1 and a (200) peak at 0.39 Å−1 in the IP direction were observed, indicating that IDIC shows good crystallinity and prefers a face-on orientation. For the ID4F pristine film, a weak (100) peak at 0.38 Å−1, a strong (200) peak at 0.70 Å−1, and a (010) peak at 1.84 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a strong (100) peak appeared at 0.40 Å−1 in the IP direction can be observed, indicating the high crystallinity of ID4F. For the IDIC based binary blend film, the weakened (100) peaks in the OOP and IP directions for the IDIC acceptor indicate that the crystallinity of IDIC is partly damaged, so that the binary blend film exhibits a small phase separation, while for the ID4F based binary blend film, very strong peaks for the ID4F acceptor can be retained suggesting that the crystallinity of the acceptor is almost not damaged after the blending. The result supports the large phase separation as observed in the TEM measurement. For the ternary blend film, the OOP peak at 0.70 Å−1 for the edge-on orientation of the ID4F completely disappears, indicating that there would be no sole crystal of ID4F in the ternary blend. This would be new evidence for the formation of the IDIC:ID4F alloy. Importantly, the IDIC:ID4F alloy in the ternary blend film still keeps quite good face-on orientation that benefits charge transport, according to the OOP (010) peak at 1.84 Å−1 and the IP peak at 0.40 Å−1. It should be noted that the position of the OOP (010) peak for the ternary blend film is identical to that for the two binary blend films, suggesting that the π–π stacking distance of the IDIC:ID4F co-crystal is almost identical to that of the IDIC or ID4F in the binary blend film. The structural similarity of IDIC and ID4F molecules may be a beneficial factor to support the close packing between the IDIC and ID4F molecules.

Based on the above results, the PBDB-T-SF:IDIC:ID4F (40 wt%) ternary blend film, based on the acceptor alloy due to close structural similarity, can show higher electron mobility, from which more balanced charge transport and optimized phase separation can be achieved compared with the two binary blend films. It should be noted that a 1D/2A ternary blend of BTR:NITI:PC71BM in a recent report, based on very different acceptors to achieve a hierarchical morphology, also gives a similar effect to afford more balanced charge transport.58 Thus the two approaches show quite different concerns in the selection of two acceptors.
Because of the large area and roll-to-roll processing of PSCs, the thickness of the active layer is difficult to be precisely controlled. Therefore, the PCE should have good tolerance towards the thickness of the active layer. Here, the optimized ternary PSCs with active layer thickness ranging from 85 to 250 nm were investigated. The J–V curves of the ternary PSCs with different thicknesses are shown in Fig. 7a, and the thickness dependences of the Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE are shown in Fig. 7b. The photovoltaic parameters of the ternary PSCs with different thicknesses are listed in Table S5.† The Voc values are almost not changed between 0.900 and 0.917 V in the thickness range. From 85 to 150 nm, the PSCs display some Jsc increases from 16.27 to 17.48 mA cm−2, while thicker active layers of 200 to 250 nm can maintain Jsc values more than 17 mA cm−2. The result also suggests that, for the PBDB-T-SF:IDIC:ID4F ternary blends, sufficient light harvesting may exist at ∼150 nm thickness. From 85 to 250 nm, the FF generally exhibits a decreasing trend but the 250 nm thick active layer can still retain a high FF of 65.43%. As a result, the ternary PSCs can show high PCEs more than 10.05% in the thickness range from 85 to 250 nm, with the highest PCE of 11.52% at 100 nm. The good thickness tolerance for the ternary active layer makes it a good candidate for large area and roll-to-roll fabrication. It should be noted that, relative to 2D/1A ternary PSCs,27,28 so far there have been much fewer examples for 1D/2A ternary PSCs that can show PCEs > 10% at the 250 nm thickness; however, the reported 1D/2A ternary blends all contain a fullerene acceptor (Table S1†).19,58 Also, the as-cast fabrication of the PBDB-T-SF:IDIC:ID4F ternary blend without an additive or a post-treatment is another feature of this work.

We also compared the shelf stability of the ternary PSCs and binary PSCs under storage in a nitrogen filled glovebox (Fig. S5†), where the J–V measurements were conducted in air. All the devices show some decrease of PCEs in the initial days, and this effect is usually called as the “burn-in” process.62 Thereafter, some differences between the ternary PSCs and binary PSCs can be found. The PCEs of the ternary PSCs are almost unchanged while those of the two binary PSCs show a continuous decrease. After 40 days of storage, the ternary PSCs still keep 88% of their original efficiency leading to a PCE of 10.14%. For the IDIC and ID4F based binary PSCs, their PCEs are 8.57% and 7.80%, respectively, corresponding to 85% and 72% of their original efficiencies. Thus the ternary PSCs can show higher shelf stability compared with the binary devices. We also measured the photostability of the PSC devices under continuous illumination with an AM 1.5G (air mass 1.5 global) solar simulator in air (Fig. S6†). After 6 h illumination, the IDIC, ID4F, and IDIC:ID4F (60:40) based PSCs could keep 72%, 73%, and 74% of their original PCEs, respectively, suggesting comparable photostability of the devices. The decreased efficiency of the devices under the continuous illumination may be related to the existence of UV light of the AM 1.5G solar spectrum.63
Conclusions
In summary, 1D/2A ternary PSCs were investigated by using PBDB-T-SF as the donor in combination with nonfluorinated IDIC and its fluorinated counterpart ID4F as the acceptor pair. The IDIC and ID4F with close structural similarity have an ability to form the acceptor alloy. The as-cast ternary PSCs can achieve a high PCE of 11.52%, based on a Voc of 0.917 V, a Jsc of 16.89 mA cm−2 and a FF of 74.35%, which is higher than 9.39% and 10.35% for the IDIC and ID4F based binary PSCs, respectively. The ternary PSCs also show good thickness tolerance with a PCE > 10% from 85 to 250 nm and better stability than the two binary PSCs. The enhanced PCEs of the ternary PSCs result from the higher electron mobility, more balanced charge transport, and optimized phase separation. Moreover, the ternary PSCs also exhibit higher storage stability than the binary devices. The results demonstrate that designing a ternary blend film based on a nonfluorinated and fluorinated acceptor pair with the closest structural similarity is a promising way to improve photovoltaic performances.
