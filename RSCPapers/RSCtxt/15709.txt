, Accepted 21st December 2021First published on 10th January 2022AbstractSustainable renewable energy production is being intensely disputed worldwide because fossil fuel resources are declining gradually. One solution is biodiesel production via the transesterification process, which is environmentally feasible due to its low-emission diesel substitute. Significant issues arising with biodiesel production are the cost of the processes, which has stuck its sustainability and the applicability of different resources. In this article, the common biodiesel feedstock such as edible and non-edible vegetable oils, waste oil and animal fats and their advantages and disadvantages were reviewed according to the Web of Science (WOS) database over the timeframe of 1970–2020. The biodiesel feedstock has water or free fatty acid, but it will produce soap by reacting free fatty acids with an alkali catalyst when they present in high portion. This reaction is unfavourable and decreases the biodiesel product yield. This issue can be solved by designing multiple transesterification stages or by employing acidic catalysts to prevent saponification. The second solution is cheaper than the first one and even more applicable because of the abundant source of catalytic materials from a waste product such as rice husk ash, chicken eggshells, fly ash, red mud, steel slag, and coconut shell and lime mud. The overview of the advantages and disadvantages of different homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts is summarized, and the catalyst promoters and prospects of biodiesel production are also suggested. This research provides beneficial ideas for catalyst synthesis from waste for the transesterification process economically, environmentally and industrially.
1 Introduction
Worldwide energy demand is rising rapidly because of the fast industrialization and population growth, influencing fossil fuel use. The price of mineral-based fuels, such as diesel, natural gas, and petroleum, has increased since the 1970s because of the rapid consumption and reduction of these fossil fuels.1 Substitute fuel has attracted significant attention because of global greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of fossil fuels. There is an increasing interest in using new knowledge and employing diverse biofuels to convert bio-energy in many industrialized nations that are cost-effective compared to fossil fuels.2 In this respect, fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel fuel) originating from animal fat and vegetable oil transesterification reaction (edible and non-edible plant oils, fungi and animal fats) have received considerable attention in recent years as sustainable, biodegradable, sulfur- and aromatic-free and harmless fuels.3
Biodiesel is a renewable and clean energy source and a mixture of alkyl esters got through the transesterification of several renewable resources such as animal fats and edible vegetable oils such as palm oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil and algal oil. It has qualities that are almost identical to petro-derived diesel and may thus be used in diesel engines with minor modifications. It's also biodegradable, non-toxic, and emits fewer hazardous pollutants than traditional petro-diesel. Nevertheless, the high cost of resources accounts for about 88% of the total biodiesel generation cost.4 Hence, non-edible oil feedstock for biodiesel generation, such as waste cooking oil, natural fat, jatropha oil, waste grease and micro-algae, has gained a significant interest in recent years.5 These feedstocks are difficult to handle because they mainly have water and high free fatty acid (FFA) contents, which require pretreatment for commercially acceptable conversion efficiency6 in the presence of a suitable catalyst.7 Another vital phase in the transesterification process is the selection of the catalyst that defines the cost of production, leading to the economic obstacle. The catalyst is the kingpin in the transesterification reaction and as seen in Fig. 1, from 1970 to 2021, there were 2260 articles published in the WoS journals using biodiesel and catalyst in the title search. The number of publications and citations is growing rapidly from 2003, and the total link strength, which specifies the total strength of the co-authorship links of a given country with other countries, was also provided. It can be seen that the top ten most active countries with the highest total link strength in sequence are Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, China, Australia, Vietnam, Nigeria, Taiwan, and Thailand.

Alcoholysis or transesterification reactions with a base, acid, enzyme, and other catalysts were used for biodiesel production.8 Biocatalysts and chemical catalysts are being examined, and both have their benefits and drawbacks. These catalysts are reported to be environmentally friendly and budget-friendly materials in industrial uses.9 Chemical catalysts comprise homogeneous factors (acid or alkali), heterogeneous agents (solid alkali or acid catalyst), supercritical fluids (SCFs) and heterogeneous nanostructured catalysts.9 Homogeneous catalysts can cause complications in biodiesel production, such as saponification of the feedstock by which vast quantity of by-products such as undesirable soap was produced by the reaction of the catalyst with the FFA, which then prevents the splitting of the FAME and glycerol and reduces the catalyst.7 Although transesterification with homogeneous catalysts is easy and quick, it has drawbacks in catalyst separation, reusability, and renewable resources.10
The context knowledge shows the growing significance of biodiesel processing, and the literature review below reveals the scarcity of scientometric research in this exciting field (see Table 1). The current research aims to summarize the feasibility and the challenges of biodiesel production using various heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic processes from different waste feedstocks. The Web of Science (WOS) database was used to conduct the bibliometric study. Catalyst promoters' importance and contribution to biodiesel generation have not been adequately examined yet. There was no match for the four words of biodiesel, catalyst, promoter and review at the topic search of the WOS website. Built upon the favorable properties of catalysts and the importance of non-noble metal promoters in the transesterification process, this study also aims to gather information on synthesizing non-noble promoters supported on various organic and inorganic metal oxides to get a high biodiesel yield.

2 Biodiesel and its application
Biodiesel is a monoalkyl ester of long-chain fatty acid oil derivative made from sustainable lipid sources such as animal fats and vegetable oils18 by a chemical modification process called transesterification. The pure type of biodiesel can be utilized as a car engine fuel. It is typically employed as an additive to diesel to decrease hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulates from diesel fuel cars.19 The first attempts of biofuels engine operation (peanut oil engine run by Rudolf Diesel in 1900 and vegetable oil run engines in 1930s) as well the first industrial biofuels were based on food crops.20 Subsequently, a diversity of source materials was examined and developed universally. Currently, over 350 herbs have been recognized as biodiesel sources.21,22
The application of biodiesel has been noticeably increasing during the last decades. As seen in Fig. 2, biodiesel applications had risen from 7.3 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) in 1990 to 87.1 mtoe in 2020. The Renewable Fuel Standard, which was included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, was the first to mandate the use of specific biofuel amounts. The goal was to use 4 billion gallons of renewables in transportation fuels in 2006 to increase their percentage over time. The lessening of the country's reliance on oil has been the driving concept of biofuel programmes. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set a goal of reducing gasoline usage by 20% over the following ten years. The 2008 Biomass Program has two essential purposes. The first is, by 2030, to reduce gasoline use by 30% as compared to 2004 levels. Second, corn-derived ethanol is used to generate cellulosic ethanol.23 Algal biomass has been used as food and feed supplements for humans and animals, fertilisers in agriculture, nutritional supplements and medication in the pharmaceutical industry, and phycocolloids in the phycocolloid industry.24,25 Higher prices for animal feeds have resulted from the growing use of agricultural commodities for biofuels; nevertheless, the more significant substitution of co-products for conventional feedstuffs in feed rations mitigates the input cost increases experienced by livestock and poultry farmers. In the next ten years, growth in agricultural commodities for biofuels is likely to continue. However, at a slower pace in major producing nations, government-imposed grain usage restrictions for biofuels are achieved, and new non-agricultural feedstocks are commercialised.26 A previous work,27 which examines renewable portfolio standards in the electricity sector and can be extended to transportation fuels, provides a detailed explanation of how such factors affect energy price. As a result, domestic fuel consumption may fall, offsetting the rise in global fuel consumption. The presence of biofuel subsidies mitigates the impact of any increases in domestic fuel prices.28 The replacement of feedstocks should be explored to reduce biofuel synthesis or operating costs. Waste cooking oil and waste animal fat, for example, are viewed as preferable feedstocks for biodiesel production compared to edible vegetable oil since they are both inexpensive and plentiful. Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 3, biodiesel has been used in an inclusive variety of applications such as bus29,30 and rail31,32 transportations, commercial steamships,33–35 heavy trucks,36,37 power systems such as generators,38–40 agricultural machinery,41–43 heating oil in domestic44–46 and commercial47–49 boilers, and aircraft.50–52 Thus, biodiesel has been gaining more attention as a resource for the growing demand from several industrial sections because of its numerous advantages over fossil fuels.

3 Sources of biodiesel
One of the essential aspects of biodiesel generation, which is related to 75% of the entire cost, is choosing suitable feedstock for the process.53–55 Furthermore, biodiesel fuel quality also hinges on resource use, generation process, and origin country.56 As seen in Fig. 4, we could categorize renewable biodiesel resources into four major categories, namely edible and nonedible vegetable oils, waste oil and animal fats.18,55,57 These feedstocks comprise a combination of fatty acid alkyl esters, which will be changed into biodiesel after the transesterification and esterification processes.58,59
 Fig. 4  Biodiesel feedstocks. 
3.1 Edible vegetable oil
One of the eco-friendly workable biodiesel feedstocks which can be formed regionally is edible vegetable oil. Edible vegetable oils like groundnut,60,61 wheat,62,63 barley,64,65 sesame seed,66,67 safflower,68,69 canola,70,71 coconut,72,73 rapeseed,74,75 rice bran,76,77 sunflower,78,79 olive,80,81 soybean,82,83 palm,84,85 peanut86,87 and corn88,89 have been employed for the generation of biodiesel and are useful as a diesel alternate. Meanwhile, most biodiesel is manufactured from eatable oils; there are several statements that many obstacles might occur.90 The disadvantage of edible oils for the source of biodiesel is the decrease of food resources, which results in the food crisis.91 Besides, the harmful effect of biodiesel generation from edible oils on the earth is ecosystem destruction and deforestation.90 Most important is the high cost of the biodiesel generation from the edible oils which makes it not economically feasible and not suitable for long-term usage. These issues can be handled by employing alternative or greener, lower-cost and reliable oil resources such as animal fats, inedible and waste cooking oil for biodiesel generation.
3.2 Non-edible vegetable oil
A large diversity of plants that create non-edible oil can be regarded for biodiesel generation. Non-edible oils contain toxic compounds, which make them not suitable for human utilization.92 Numerous oils obtained from grains or seeds of inedible plants are possible resources for biodiesel generation. These sorts of feedstocks are inexpensively obtainable and mostly labeled as non-edible oil, dominating any food competition. Studies have used numerous non-edible oils for biodiesel production such as linseed,93,94 tobacco seed,95,96 cottonseed,97,98 rubber seed,99,100 neem,101,102 moringa,103,104 pongamia,105,106 algae,107,108 jatropha,109,110 Karanja,111,112 mahua,113,114 jojoba,115,116 cumaru117–119 and camellia.120,121 The considerable interest for transforming inedible oil to biodiesel is continuously related to the high contents of free fatty acids (FFAs),92 which inhibits the separation of glycerin and ester by produced soap after reaction with an alkaline catalyst. This issue can be solved by designing multiple transesterification stages. Over the use of multiple transesterification processes, the nonedible oils will prove to be a more efficient and environmentally friendly substitute in biodiesel production.
3.3 Animal fat
The fats were demonstrated to be a feasible resource when associated with waste cooking and vegetable oils in production and economy. Synthetically, biodiesel is a combination of fatty acid alkyl ester (FAAE) derived from triglyceride molecules. Waste animal fats are considered one of the sources of triglycerides. Because the value of the feedstock is enhanced after conversion, they are a viable resource for biodiesel production.122 Moreover, leftover natural fats obtained from leather, slaughterhouses and meat process factories are a considerably probable source for biodiesel generation because of their chemical lifelessness, no corrosion, enhanced calorie level and viable feedstocks. In addition to meat processing scum, leather industry fleshing wastes have shown to be a viable source of fat for biodiesel generation when mixed with regular diesel for combustion-based applications.123,124 However, since these wastes are useless, they are thrown into the environment.125 As a result, there has been a lot of interest in using animal fat waste as a cheap source of feedstock in biodiesel synthesis. Numerous papers and studies on techniques, reactor design, applications, mixes with diesel fuel, catalysts, and operating conditions have been carried out. However, both the acid catalyst and the heterogeneous catalyst may be used to convert waste animal fats.126–128
3.4 Waste oil
Waste cooking oil is used as a low-cost feedstock all around the globe, with industrialised nations producing a million gallons of waste cooking oil each day. There is a considerable quantity of waste cooking oil being made annually all around the globe.129 The enormous mass of waste is thrown into landfills and rivers forbiddenly, producing pollution in the environment. If waste cooking oil is the operational feedstock for producing biodiesel at a lower price, a large amount of waste oil available is adequate for sustainable biodiesel production. Waste yields, i.e., lignocellulosic feedstocks and inedible unwanted oils such as waste cooking oil or vegetable scums, are the unavoidable consequence of edible oil intake as a usual ration of the human diet. Therefore, biodiesel fuel production from edible waste oil is considered a significant stage for decreasing and recycling waste oil and levies no extra cost and environmental hazard. Waste oils, however, contain small amounts of FFAs and water in a supplement to oxidized compounds, such as aldehydes, epoxides, and polymers. The large-scale generation of biodiesel fuel from unwanted eatable oils is currently achieved by a substance reaction employing alkaline catalysts. According to the quantity of produced waste cooking oils in all countries, it can be showed that diesel fuel could not utterly be substituted by biodiesel production from this source. Nevertheless, a considerable diesel fuel volume can be produced from waste cooking oils, which would partially decline the reliance on fossil fuels. Using waste cooking oils for biodiesel generation in the transesterification reaction causes the escalation of the water, FFAs and other impurities that can undesirably affect the transesterification reaction while using alkali catalysts.130–132 Besides, waste cooking oils may require a pretreatment procedure to meet proper oil properties for the transesterification reaction because their features such as specific heat and viscosity might be changed during cooking.133 Nevertheless, other options such as employing acid catalysis transesterification,134–136 supercriticality137 and enzyme catalysis133 can be used to make the production of biodiesel a more practical process.
4 Catalysts for biodiesel production
For the manufacture of biodiesel, transesterification methods are widely employed. Transesterification, as shown in Fig. 5, is a reversible reaction and is obtained by reactant combination. Strong acid or base components can be introduced to the system as catalysts. On a large scale, potassium or sodium methanolates are typically utilized. Heterogeneous catalysts are beneficial in this procedure because they are simple to remove from the result and may be reused. Solid base catalysts are advantageous in biodiesel production because they can be readily separated and reused in the process. Conversely, since it needs multiple chemical reagents and a multi-step preparation process, the available catalyst is costly, preventing future uses of this kind of catalyst.138 Materials such as CH3OK, CH3ONa, NaOH, and KOH, considered a solid alkali catalyst, are examined for biodiesel generation.9 Nevertheless, alkali metal alkoxide is found to be more effective than hydroxide.139 There are many homogeneous, enzymatic and heterogeneous catalysts that have been examined for biodiesel generation from various feedstocks. Among all, calcium oxide-based catalysts are favorable for facilitating biodiesel development and purification and reducing the cost of the biodiesel generation process because of the comprehensive variety of practical raw resources. An additional way of lowering the biodiesel cost and reducing the waste disposal obstacles is utilizing naturally calcium-rich waste substances such as animal and bird bones, mollusk and hen eggshells.9,140

4.1 Homogeneous catalysts
Homogeneous catalysis is a reaction when the reacting components and catalysts are mixed in a single matter state. Instances of homogeneous catalysis are basic, acid, enzymatic, and organometallic catalysis. These catalysts are being used because of the straightforward application and shorter reaction time needed to convert feedstock to the product in biodiesel industries.12 652 published works were discovered using the Web of Science data's subject search engine, including title, abstract, author keywords and keywords, plus fields inside the record and keywords like homogenous, catalyst, transesterification, and biodiesel. The minimum number of occurrences of a keyword was set at 40 and 17 keywords, respectively, to simplify the bibliometric analysis, and the findings of network visualization in Fig. 6 reveal two diverse clusters. The density of items at each node determines the size of each node in the keyword density visualization plat. Keywords with a larger circle size appear more often; keywords with a smaller circle size appear less frequently. Furthermore, the closer the things are together, the stronger their bond. The term “transesterification” had the highest total link strength, while “soybean oil” had the second-highest full link strength. During the period 1970–2020, these terms become more significant in homogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production research. Table 2 demonstrates the initial 17 keywords based on total link strength.

Homogeneous chemical catalysts have some merits, such as easy activity optimization, high turnover frequency and selectivity, and a high reaction rate.141,142 The most usual homogeneous catalysts used for transesterification reactions are sodium methoxide (CH3ONa), sodium (NaOH) and potassium (KOH) hydroxides. Using CH3ONa as catalysts is expensive but more applicable than KOH and NaOH compounds. CH3ONa was reported to be the best active basic catalyst, which prompted noble phase separation.143 Further, CH3ONa will help to avoid the water and soap formation.144 Two mechanisms are convoluted in the transesterification process, dependent on whether acid catalysts or basic catalysts are applied, which are discussed below.
4.2 Acidic catalysts
The transesterification reaction is catalyzed by Brønsted acids, in preference of sulfonic145–147 and sulfuric acid.148–150 According to the WOS data employing the title search by keywords such as “transesterification”, “soybean”, “acid”, and “catalyst”, 12 articles were identified and are listed in Table 3.

Fig. 7 illustrates the mechanisms of transesterification reactions of oil with acid catalysts for monoglycerides, and it can be extended to di- and triglyceride.163 The carbonyl group protonation of the ester results in carbocation II, which, after nucleophilic alcohol strike, creates the tetrahedral intermediate III, which reduces glycerol for the new ester IV formation and catalyst H+ regeneration. Transesterification reaction via acid catalysts is more applicable for unrefined or waste oils, but the downside is that acidic catalytic samples are suggestively less active than alkali ones.164 Moreover, the ratio of methanol to oil in the transesterification process with acid catalysts is high with a low reaction rate; therefore, these catalysts are not gaining much attention as basic catalysts.165 Even though, because of the existence of FFAs in high quantity in such oils and fat, homogeneous alkaline catalysts are not recommended. To solve this issue, free fatty acids are firstly esterified to FAME (Fig. 8) using an acid catalyst127 and thereafter, the transesterification reaction is implemented, usually by employing alkaline catalysts. In the pre-esterification technique, it is required to separate the esterified oil and the homogeneous acid catalyst, which is the principal disadvantage of this technique. This issue can be handled with the application of a heterogeneous acid catalyst.166

4.3 Basic catalyst
The most often used catalysts in an industrial biodiesel production facility are base catalysts such as potassium (KOH) and sodium (NaOH) hydroxides. The following factors contribute to this: (1) cheap cost compared to heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysts, (2) market availability, and (3) ability to accelerate transesterification under moderate reaction conditions efficiently.169 Twenty-three journal articles were detected from the WOS data and are shown in Table 4 following title search using keywords such as “transesterification”, “soybean”, “base”, and “catalyst”. Basic catalysts are typically favoured to acid catalysts because of their more excellent activity and the lower process temperatures needed than acid-catalyzed transesterification. For example, reaction temperatures of 80 to 120 °C have been recorded for acid-catalyzed transesterification by H2SO4, while basic homogeneous catalysis may be successful at ambient temperatures.170 Basic catalysts have a high transesterification activity rate at low temperatures and pressures.171 Previous research has used CaO and MgO as catalysts to study the effect of catalyst basicity on the yield of products.172 They found that substantial residual oil quantity was produced because the basic centres prevented the secondary cracking. The reaction mechanism for forming fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) is described as follows in Fig. 9. Among the different catalytic systems employed in the transesterification of waste feedstock by employing the basic catalysts, it is confirmed that strong basic properties are essential to achieve this reaction. Cation-exchanged catalysts are unsuitable, whereas systems in the form of a simple oxide with a high surface area show some exciting performances. The kinetics of homogeneous basic transesterification are extremely rapid; however, there is a collateral saponification process that lowers biodiesel production efficiency.173 To avoid biodiesel production losses due to saponification processes, alcohol and oil must be dried, and the oil must have the fewest FFAs possible (less than 0.1 wt%). Furthermore, there are many disadvantages to homogeneous basic catalysis, such as its sensitivity to moisture and free fatty acid.174

 Fig. 9  Mechanism of base-catalyzed transesterification.197,198 
The strong base (NaOH or KOH) catalysed through a homogenous transesterification process has certain constraints, such as product separation, which leads to increased biodiesel production costs.11 The method involved numbers of washings and purification stages to sustain the specified condition. It was reasonably challenging to eliminate the K/Na residues lasting in the product, and the split of glycerin also caused practical experiments. The whole process cost might be increased using a higher amount of water in the washing step.199 These factors indicate that using basic or acid heterogeneous catalysts, or better yet, a heterogeneous catalyst with acid and basic characteristics, may result in a more environmentally friendly and less expensive biodiesel manufacturing process. The triglycerides are transesterified at the basic internal sites (–O−), whereas the free fatty acids are esterified at the acid exterior sites (–H+).200
4.4 Organometallic catalysis
Organometallic catalysts are broadly employed as homogeneous catalyst phase in the forms of catalysts to enhance the rates of industrial chemical reaction and stoichiometrically in the research field. Organometallic catalysis has had a significant effect on organic synthesis during the past 50 years, allowing for the discovery of hitherto unthinkable reactions.201 Rapid advances in the research of organometallic and coordination compounds have resulted in the invention and commercialization of several catalytic processes using these compounds as catalysts.202,203 The selectivity of organometallic catalysis is a major benefit that has led to its broad use by industry.204 Transition metal compounds induce catalysis reactions that may be rationalised as a succession of stoichiometric phases connected cyclically to create a catalytic cycle. The coordination or attachment of substrate(s) to a metal core is the first step in the creation of an organometallic complex. The activated substrate(s) are then subjected to a sequence of intramolecular transformations, which may also include external groups and substrate(s) and the breakdown of the organometallic compound to provide reaction products. Platinum metal group complexes have outperformed all other organometallic catalysts in a variety of synthetic techniques. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, it has won three Nobel awards in this field in a row.205 Tin(II) catalysts are also broadly applied on large scales to synthesise the polyesters and for polymerization of L-lactide.206 On the other hand, organotin alkoxy is widely described in transesterification reactions.207,208 Another widely generated organometallic complexes in the globe are organotin compounds.209 They are used as catalysts in a variety of industrial processes in which esters are produced via (trans)esterification, such as the synthesis of fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAEs),210 polyesters211,212 and lactones.213 The proposed transesterification mechanism of the tin based organometallic catalyst is shown in Fig. 10. This mechanism involves three necessary steps, (1) associative exchange of the alcohol onto the tin compound; (2) coordination and insertion of the carboxylic group into the Sn–O link of the tin alkoxide produced in (1); and (3) associative exchange of the intermediate. Unfortunately, we couldn't find any published article in the WOS database for a title search of two keywords of “organometallic” and “biodiesel”. However by using “organometallic” and “transesterification” words, only three papers were detected.214–216
 Fig. 10  Diagram of the organotin(IV)-based catalytic transesterification mechanism.209 
4.5 Enzymatic catalysis
The enzymatic reaction is more strategic than the other systems because of its higher product quality, no wastewater production, affluent product recovery, favourable reaction situations, and no saponification. The enzyme, also named lipase, is the primary constituent in enzymatic reaction that can act as a catalyst in the extensive diversity of applications, including FFAs.217 There are fewer process stages, less wastewater and energy required for biodiesel production when enzymes are introduced as a catalyst in the system. Enzymes are recyclable and compatible with differences in the raw material variances; thus, they are hypothetically more beneficial than acid or alkaline catalysts. Additionally, they cause the increase of the separation of the products and produce a superb glycerol quality.218–220 Lipases from different sources have been investigated for their transesterification activity on other oils such as jatropha,221,222 tallow,223,224 soybean oil,225,226 sunflower oil,227,228 and waste cooking oil.229,230 Nevertheless, owing to its high cost, sluggish reaction rates, enzyme inhibition, and loss of function, enzyme transesterification is not extensively utilized.231,232
The most common method of decreasing free fatty acid of feedstocks such as oil and fat is the pre-esterification of free fatty acid by homogeneous acid catalysts before utilizing base catalyst transesterification reaction.127,129 In this technique, it is necessary to discrete the homogeneous acid catalyst from oil which is the key disadvantage of this method.233 In general, all homogeneous catalysts are linked with some other drawbacks, which might escalate the production cost because of wastewater emission and separation steps.234 The product of glycerin after transesterification reaction is low when a homogeneous catalyst is used. Then multi-stage purifications with the lengthy process are needed,79,235 which negatively affects the total costs of the transesterification process. Furthermore, the transesterification reaction via homogeneous base catalysts is not suitable for several feedstocks. Homogeneous catalysts are environmentally harmful in comparison with heterogeneous ones because they are naturally hygroscopic.236 Homogeneous catalysts are often highly selective but not particularly active or stable. On the other hand, heterogeneous catalysts are highly active (you can run them at higher temperatures because they are more robust), but they are not particularly selective.
4.6 Heterogeneous catalysts
Heterogeneous catalysts, typically in solid form, operate in a different phase in the reaction mixture of liquid compared to homogeneous catalysts. Homogeneous catalysts are corrosive, and they produce vast quantities of wastewater during the wash. Also, they give energy-intensive separation steps to separate the reaction constituents, and the catalyst cannot be effectively reused. Many results were reported to explore the activities of a range of heterogeneous materials to solve the many difficulties connected with homogeneous base and liquid acid such as alcoholysis catalysts.237 There are many advantages for heterogeneous catalyst applications over homogeneous ones, such as high glycerol purities, easier recycling and removal of the used catalysts, massive wastewater amounts, and washing section eliminations.238 Heterogeneous catalysts may also exist in distinct phases from the reactants, such as solid in liquid or aqueous reactants. As a result, heterogeneous catalysts may be suitable for excellent characteristics, including non-corrosion and easy separation.239 The primary focus of recent advancement in heterogeneous catalysis research is developing recyclable solid catalysts for the most uncomplicated biodiesel production.4 We have deliberately focused on trash assessment rather than creating renewable resources for catalytic applications in terms of material class. This is due to millions of waste disposed of as waste in a landfill without any pretreatment, which has been declared a source of organic pollution. Table 5 shows the stated production rates for a number of industrial and biological wastes discussed. Moreover, the biodiesel production cost will remarkably decrease by employing highly active waste-derived catalysts, which could also be suitable for large-scale applications. Various studies have shown the use of different waste resources such as rice husk ash,240 chicken eggshells,241 fly ash,242 red mud,243 steel slag,244 coconut shell245 and lime246 for biodiesel production. The area of the application of wastes in catalysis has attracted increasing interest in recent years.

4.7 Rice husk ash
Rice lids 1% of the earth's surface and is a crucial food resource for many nations.254 The outer layer of paddy is called rice husk, and it makes about 20–25% of its weight. It is separated during rice milling and is mainly utilised as a source of heat in businesses and households in India. The rice husk could be an excellent solid fuel because the rice husk specific properties includes ash, volatile substance and heating value at 12.8%, 74.0% and 16.3 MJ kg−1, respectively.255 The majority of the RHA component contains silica (∼95%) and other elements such as zinc, magnesium, copper, potassium, calcium, manganese and iron.256,257 The RHA chemical composition and price point contribute to its good candidacy for industrial applications. The rice husk burning in the air always produces rice husk ash (RHA),258 which is considered an agricultural by-product in most world continents. Its low costs make it a viable and robust material as a catalyst support. RHA can also be utilized to purify the biodiesel using extracted silica from rice husk ash.259 RHA can be divided into amorphous, partial crystalline, and crystalline RHA.260 The major component of RHA (83–90%) is amorphous silica.261 Amorphous silica and carbon have potential commercial and scientific uses, and it is favoured over crystal silica because it is more reactive.262 From 1970 to 2020, only seven papers have been detected in the WOS database using “rice husk ash” and “biodiesel” keywords in the title search.256,258,263–267 These few published papers indicate a gap for catalyst development from RHA for biodiesel production studies. More particularly, there is a lot of interest in utilising silica from RHA to remove monoglyceride from crude biodiesel production since it is a by-product component of the biodiesel process that causes sedimentation in low-temperature environments.268
4.8 Eggshells
Eggshell weighs roughly 10% of the entire mass of chicken eggs; an eggshell is the substantial solid waste formed from manufacturing and food processing plants.269 The intact eggshell is around 700 nm thick and comprises two layers: an exterior microfilament-covered layer and an interior amorphous layer with a high electron density. Deteriorating eggshells, on the other hand, may reveal a middle layer with an intermediate electron density. The weight of the hen eggshell usually is 5–6 g with calcium carbonate composing 85–95% of the dry eggshell.270 Waste eggshells are produced due to the enormous consumption of eggs, posing a significant waste disposal issue, especially in overpopulated nations like China and India. The discarded eggshells may cause disposal issues as well as contamination in the environment. The use of discarded eggshells as a raw material for catalyst synthesis reduces waste while also producing a heterogeneous alkali catalyst with high cost-effectiveness. The bird eggshell is a porous bio-ceramic produced in a cell-free environment at body temperature.271 The eggshell is an entirely systematic structure with a polycrystalline organization through the solidified shell.272 There are varieties of eggshells for different birds published in the WOS, listed in Table 6 (topic search) published during 1970–2020. As seen, there are only 151 published works in total, and there is also a lack of studies on many other types of edible eggs from different birds.

4.9 Fly ash
Fly ash, a solid waste produced by power stations, creates many difficulties; therefore, fly ash disposal is a critical issue273 due to a large vacant area requirement to create the dump. Although fly ash is mainly utilised for construction materials and other civil engineering projects, a part of it is nevertheless dumped in ponds or landfills. Therefore, it has become critical to develop alternate ways for fly ash disposal or appropriate use, focusing on discovering new applications and recognising new types of recycling. As a result, an effort was undertaken to create a suitable fly ash-based heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification process to make it useful in the form of a higher value-added product. The thermal stability of fly ash is high because it includes a complex mixture with high contents of SiO2 with several metal oxides, such as CaO, MgO, Al2O3, and, particularly, Fe2O3. The mass compositions of fly ash components are shown in Fig. 11. Moreover, some minor elements such as As, Ge, Hg, Ga, and a tinge of active metals (Mn, Cu, Cr, Co, Pb, Zn, and Ni) and rare earth elements might also exist in fly ash.274 Fly ash is an appropriate substance for synthesising zeolites because of its textural, mineralogical, and chemical properties. The development of zeolites from the fly ash and their use as a catalyst for transesterification reaction eradicates the dumping obstacles. It changes waste and unwanted substances into a valuable and cheap alternative source. However, many investigations have stated the pozzolanic property of fly ash275 which has been employed in base-catalyzed reactions. Coal fly ash, for example, has been used as a precursor in the preparation of basic zeolite Na-X for biodiesel synthesis through the transesterification of sunflower oil with methanol.19 The role of fly ash as a catalyst in biodiesel generation was also explored.19,20,29 Following the WOS database and title search of “fly”, “ash”, and “biodiesel”, there are 16 published works detected and are summarized in Table 7. As seen in the table, the fly ash application for biodiesel has been started since 2012, and few publications were reported in this area. Therefore it could be beneficial to put the area of development of zeolites from fly ash waste for the transesterification process environmentally and industrially.

4.10 Red mud
Red mud is an undesirable byproduct of the Bayer alumina production process. Around 90 million tonnes of red mud are produced globally, implying that repurposing waste from one industry and enhancing another may result in a better and more efficient environment.293 Red mud's unprotected disposal at landfill sites significantly affects the surrounding soils and groundwater due to its alkaline nature and high metallic content.294 The utilization of red mud as a catalyst for biodiesel generation delivers economical and environmentally friendly ways of reusing these sorts of wastes, expressively dropping its environmental toxicity and decreasing the biodiesel cost to make biodiesel reasonable in comparison with petroleum diesel. Only in the presence of sulphur did the red mud catalyst show acceptable activity, and the reaction product distributions were similar to those observed in the hydroliquefaction of cellulose and lignin.295 The approximate main elements of red mud are SiO2, Fe2O3, CaO, TiO2, Al2O3, and Na2O and are shown in Fig. 12, so red mud can support the preparation of catalysts. The use of the red mud catalyst for the manufacture of bio-diesel was described by Liu et al.296 The results showed that red mud is a highly active catalyst due to its inherent catalytic characteristics. Senthil et al.297 revealed that using red mud as a catalyst improves fuel properties while reducing pollution effects. However, under the title search of the WOS record, only six papers were found and are listed in Table 8, which started in 2013. Therefore, by considering the alkaline nature of red mud, the catalyst development from this waste could be highly effective in the transesterification of oil with methanol.

4.11 Iron and steel slag
Research on the application and improvement of solid waste elements from bulk chemical, petrochemical, metallurgical, steel and nuclear industries is significant for both enterprises and academics. Many specialists are interested in the slag recycling issue resulting from the pyrometallurgical treatment of natural materials since it offers the possibility of turning slags into valuable products while reducing waste.302 Steelmaking operations produce iron and steel by-products in two ways: iron ore-based steelmaking and scrap-based steelmaking. In all, the first one is used to create 70% of the world's steel.303 Slag materials generally consist of silica, oxides of particular metals in a given ratio that hinges on the original constitution of the element and even free metal species.304 The central chemical forms of the steel slug are presented in Fig. 13; hence it is an attractive material to develop catalysts. Other elements such as Mg, Mn, Al, Ti, and V may contribute a considerable proportion to the slag composition depending on the provenance of the iron ore.305 Therefore, attention to the industrial slag utilization in the catalyst preparation has been newly enhanced. Also, since the CaO fraction in LD-slag is high, it might be probable that it has beneficial catalytic properties for the transesterification process. Kabir et al.306 developed a zeolite from steel slag for pyrolysis of oil palm mesocarp fibres. They showed that the composition of bio-oil grew lighter and more stable, and that a large volume of metal oxides plays an essential role in the catalytic activity of steel slag. Another investigation explores that catalysts from steelmaking slags have an excellent performance in coal tar conversion to gas products.307 Unluckily, few reports have previously described the application of slag waste as a catalyst. As seen in Table 9, only six articles were published using two words of “slag” and “biodiesel” in the title search of the WOS database. Hence, the improvement of iron and steel slag catalysts in biodiesel production is an exciting subject in opinions of the appropriate waste resource deployment and its application in energy chemical production.

4.12 Coconut
Coconut shell nanoparticles are selected for biodiesel additions because they are a commonly accessible agricultural waste, have a cheap cost, and have greater calorific values.314 Coconut shells are categorized as solid waste produced from agricultural activities involving a yearly generation of nearly 3.18 million tonnes.315 Coconut shells represent more than 60% of home waste quantity and present severe disposal problems for environments,316 and their chemical compositions are displayed in Fig. 14. Adding coconut shells into the brick will turn the coconut shells from waste material into potential materials that can be used to produce green building materials where large agricultural and industrial waste is discharged, and it will give twice the over benefits of decrease in the construction material cost other than disposal of wastes. It also outperforms other crushed granite aggregates in terms of impact, crushing, and abrasion resistance.317 Furthermore, the coconut shell's high carbon content, low ash level, and great strength and hardness make it ideal for catalyst development.318 Azizah et al.319 developed a catalyst via sulfonation of partially carbonized coconut shells by determined sulfuric acid and produced 88.15% biodiesel yield from palm oil. Yano et al.320 employed potassium supported on coconut-shell activated carbon to generate biodiesel from the transesterification of palm oil. They achieved 26.98% of the reaction conversion at 60 °C. Another study performed by Achanai et al.321 used potassium hydroxide supported on coconut shell activated carbon and obtained 86.3% biodiesel yield from waste cooking oil. Coconut shells, a non-degradable material and an environmental concern could be used as an effective heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel generation, a green energy source. More interestingly, we could find only four published papers319,321–323 in the WOS title search of “biodiesel”, “coconut”, and “shell” in the period of 1970–2020. Of significance, the synthesis of new catalysts with low costs and high activity from coconut shells could play crucial roles in the environmental and industrial aspects of green and sustainable catalysts for biodiesel production.

4.13 Lime mud
Lime mud produced in pulp mills as a waste mainly comprises CaCO3 with residues of MgCO3 and some different ores. Lime mud is being employed as an eco-friendly and economic heterogeneous basic catalyst for the transesterification reaction. The major lime mud component, calcium carbonate, could be improved into calcium oxide throughout calcination.325 Almost 100 tonnes of lime mud is generated as a by-product of 550 tonnes of pulp production.326 The paper industry continues to produce millions of tonnes of lime mud each year, increasing with the growing demand for papers, with no efficient use anticipated. Other components in lime mud, such as silicon, magnesium, aluminium, and ferric, contribute to its alkaline nature.327 The chemical constituents of lime mud are represented in Fig. 15. So far, lime mud is principally discarded outside, resulting in a severe environmental crisis and causing land occupation. According to the title search of the WOS database, using “lime”, “mud”, and “transesterification” words, there were only five papers detected from 1970 to 2020.325,327–330 Hui et al.327 conducted the transesterification of edible peanut oil via KF supported on lime mud catalyst. They obtained 99.09% oil conversion at 64 °C, with a methanol to oil ratio of 12:1 and 5 wt% of catalyst. Another research was performed by Agus et al.329 employing modified lime mud base catalysts by soda–lime calcination for the transesterification of canola oil. They produced biodiesel with a yield of 99.6% at 60 °C, 4 wt% catalyst amount and a methanol to oil ratio of 12:1. Consequently, there is a lack of study on recycling and utilizing the lime mud for catalysis reaction, especially in the transesterification process and biodiesel production.

4.14 Catalyst promoters
Promoters are not catalysts but mixed in small quantities with the catalysts to increase their efficiency in the reaction. At present, little interest has been shifted to applying structure promoters for CaO, providing a stable template with a high surface area, which could produce more excellent catalytic activity performance. Arsalanfar et al.332 studied the effect of Li, Cs, K, Rb and Ru promoters over the Fe–Co–Mn catalyst. They illustrated that the MgO/FeCoMn catalyst had revealed enhanced catalytic activity for converting synthesis gas into liquid fuels. Mohebbi et al.333 studied the effect of the Mo/B-ZSM-5 nano-catalyst in the free fatty acid esterification reaction. They found that the molybdenum promoter improved the crystallinity and the acid site concentration but reduced the acid site strength. Other researchers used the NiCoPt promoter over FAU zeolite for the oleic acid esterification reaction.334 They achieved 93% oleic acid conversion at 343 K. To study the catalytic activity in the partial hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived fatty acid methyl esters and enhance the oxidative stability of biodiesel, Thunyaratchatanon et al.335 employed sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and barium (Ba) promoters for the Pd/SiO2 catalyst. The most significant turnover frequency was due to the low basic site density of Pd–Ba/SiO2. Lingmei et al.336 employed La, Ce, Zr, and Mn promoters over the Fe(II)–Zn-based catalyst for biodiesel generation from rapeseed oil. All the catalysts have comparable crystal structures, but the catalyst with 1 wt% La promoters had superior catalytic activity in the transesterification reactions. The results confirmed the high potential of the development of catalysts with promoters for industrial applications.
4.15 Biodiesel waste products
Glycerol, biodiesel washing wastewaters, methanol, and solid residues are biodiesel's most significant residues and by-products. Glycerol is the by-product that has sparked the most interest, as it can generate the most revenue for the biodiesel industry. Glycerin can be used to make various biotechnology products with high added value, such as ethanol, citric acid, 1,3 propanediol, and biosurfactants. The large amount of glycerin produced by biodiesel production worldwide means that renewable raw materials will be plentiful and inexpensive in the coming years.337 For example, in 2007, the price of refined glycerol in the United States was painfully low, around $0.30 per pound (compared to $0.70 before the expansion of biodiesel production). As a result, the price of crude glycerol fell from around $0.25 to $0.05 per pound.338 Fermentative glycerol metabolism is of particular interest due to the highly reduced nature of carbon in glycerol and the cost advantage of anaerobic processes. Low glycerol prices have a particularly negative impact on the biodiesel industry. Many now regard crude glycerol as a “waste stream” with a disposal cost associated with it, although it was once considered a desirable co-product that could contribute to the economic viability of biodiesel production.339 As a result, developing long-term techniques for exploiting this organic source material is critical. Glycerol has been converted into valuable chemicals using various techniques and procedures, including acetylation to make acetins, esterification to convert glycerol into several kinds of ester, ammoxidation to produce acrylonitrile, and gasification and steam reforming to produce synthesis gas. Pyrolysis is another advantageous process that involves heat degradation in the absence of oxygen. The formation of organic liquids, gases, and char is aided by lower process temperatures and more extended vapor residence periods. Certain researchers developed multiple strategies for using glycerol as an energy source. Jo-Han et al.340 employed microwave-assisted and carbonaceous catalytic pyrolysis of crude glycerol from biodiesel waste to generate energy for a brief period. They discovered that the fraction of product phases is most influenced by the duration spent within the quartz reactor, followed by the reaction temperature. Bühler et al.341 examined glycerol's ionic processes and pyrolysis as competing reaction routes in near- and supercritical water. They observed that the primary products of the glycerol breakdown were hydrogen, carbon dioxide, allyl alcohol, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ethanol, methanol, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde. They suggested that the improvements and alternatives inside the ionic part of the mechanism and the additions concerning the interference of ionic and free radical reaction steps may lead to a better and more general global reaction model for the decomposition of glycerol in high-pressurized water. The conversion of waste into portable and energy profit positive products by pyrolysis makes crude glycerol a possible option for bioenergy production of bio-oil and syngas.
4.16 Prospects
The most significant factors for operative biodiesel production are the type of catalyst and feedstock. As a result, there is a clear need to find a modern and efficient method for mass production that reduces response time, manufacturing costs, and energy consumption. Feedstock selection is critical in biodiesel production, affecting various factors, including price, yield, composition, and purity. Along the way, research needs to be expedited to enhance the existing performance of biodiesel sources. Collecting waste oil, animal fat, edible and non-edible vegetable oils as a source of biodiesel and building even small factories in suburban areas to utilize these wastes to produce biodiesel is highly recommended. Additionally, attempts have been made to use waste necessity to get government's funding, such as tax relief, and enforce the collection, use, and passage of waste substances to such factories by residents and municipality. Selection and supply of suitable feedstock concentrate on maintaining non-renewable feedstocks, but it contains various parts and covers many related elements to offer assistance for current and prospective biodiesel production. Numerous applicable methods can be stated as it is logical to fulfil the associated aspects of conducting a low-cost transesterification process for biodiesel production. In the recent decade, a significant development to seize the limitations of homogeneous catalysts has been made by achieving insight into the heterogeneous catalyst synthesis from low cost and waste materials such rice husk ash, chicken eggshells, fly ash, red mud, steel slag, coconut shell and lime mud for biodiesel production. These wastes are highly desirable to consider development because of the presence of a high portion of silica, alumina, iron, calcium oxide, and many other valuable elements in their structures. However, it still lacks research on developing highly active catalysts from eggshells of birds other than chicken, such as duck, ostrich, goose, caviar, turkey, emu, hilsa, seagull turtle, pheasant, and rhea. Extension studies on the development of catalysts from red mud, iron and steel slag, coconut, lime mud, and zeolites from fly ash are desirable because of the low level of records in the WOS database. Another way of overcoming homogeneous catalyst limitations is by employing ionic liquids as a reusable and eco-friendly catalyst applicable to various feedstocks.342 Further investigations on the application of promoters such as Co, Ni, Pt, Ce, Mg, La, Zr, and Mn for heterogeneous catalyst development for transesterification reactions are recommended. The ionic liquid can be reused constantly, so it has possible application in biodiesel production. Application of biocatalysts for transesterification processes is also a novel approach and needs comprehensive investigation. It is also essential to focus on the economic analysis of the cost of biodiesel production using biological catalysts such as free lipase and traditionally immobilized lipase biocatalysts.
5. Conclusions
Worldwide demands for renewable, eco-friendly and sustainable fuels are rising rapidly because of the increasing environmental pollution from petroleum fuels and decreasing fossil fuel resources. In recent years, biodiesel, which has environmental advantages produced from renewable feedstocks, has become a more desirable fuel. Even though crude oil directly impacts the development of biodiesel technology, many biodiesel-related research initiatives are still prone to swings. Various biodiesel production approaches, including mass transfer limits, extended residence durations, scalability of the technology, and costly equipment, continue to offer hurdles. The current review studies aid in identifying beneficial developments, challenges, and opportunities in various aspects of biodiesel production. According to the literature, the main cost of biodiesel generation belongs to the feedstocks; thus, choosing a suitable source of biodiesel is significant in a cheap biodiesel production system. The search for valuable biodiesel sources must emphasise feedstock that does not affect food sources, does not lead to land-clearing, and offers greenhouse-gas declines. Biodiesel synthesis from algae and waste cooking oil is technically sound and cost-effective compared to typical vegetable oil and animal fat transesterification. From the review mentioned above, studies depict that catalysts play a crucial role in developing biodiesel. Few researchers have used homogeneous catalysts for pre-esterification and transesterification of various waste feedstocks. However, the leading disadvantage of the pre-esterification technique is the requirement of separation of the esterified oil and the homogeneous acid catalyst. This problem can be solved with the use of heterogeneous acid catalysts. However, biodiesel is presently not reasonable from an economic point of view, and more studies and technical development are required. As a suggestion, further heterogeneous catalytic development such as ionic liquids, promoters, multi-stage transesterification and associated strategies are significant to endorse biodiesel investigations and make their costs viable with other typical energy sources.
