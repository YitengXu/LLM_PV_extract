A particular focus was given to the determination of the eutectic composition and temperature. P3HT was fractionated in three different narrow molecular weight fractions (14.9 kg mol−1, 32.4 kg mol−1, 89.1 kg mol−1) in order to study its effect on the eutectic behaviour. Heating rates of 500 K min−1 were utilised to drastically decrease or suppress cold crystallization of the mixtures, especially around the eutectic composition. This led to a more accurate determination of the state diagram. An important decrease of crystallization kinetics was observed around the eutectic composition, making an accurate determination difficult. This was shown to be due to the melting (and crystallization) temperature depression around the eutectic composition coupled with the vitrification of PC61BM at 139 °C. These findings highlight the importance of the amorphous phase for the morphology development of the active layer in organic photovoltaics. By changing the preceding sample solution preparation and by using dedicated cooling and heating rates, the eutectic composition was found between 50–55 wt% PC61BM for 14.9 kg mol−1 P3HT, 55–60 wt% PC61BM for 32.4 kg mol−1 P3HT, and 55–65 wt% PC61BM for 89.1 kg mol−1 P3HT. The eutectic onset temperature of melting was found to be around 140 °C for the different P3HT molecular weight fractions, which is close to the glass transition of pure PC61BM.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have increasingly gained interest over the last two decades, with a revolutionary breakthrough in 2005, achieving power conversion efficiencies of 5%,1 and recent efficiencies approaching 10%, the limit generally considered to be required for successful applicability.2–4 These high efficiency devices combine an electron-donating conjugated polymer and an electron-accepting component in a so called bulk heterojunction morphology (BHJ), which consists of an optimal co-continuous network of nano-scale dimensions formed after casting or annealing.5–7 When irradiated by light, the donor absorbs a photon, creating a bound pair of opposite charges known as an exciton, which needs to diffuse to the donor/acceptor interface to dissociate into free charges.8,9 These charges are then collected by the electrodes, producing an electric current.8,9 Due to the limited diffusion length of the exciton (ca. 10 nm),8,10 the increased interface of a BHJ is considered as being beneficial for its dissociation into free charges, and thus for the device performance.8,11,12
Although the highest efficiency OPVs use advanced low band gap conjugated polymers,13,14 the most studied OPV mixture combines regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as electron donor with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as electron acceptor. Because of the rich literature concerning this system, it is considered as a reference system for research purposes. Due to the low synthetic complexibility of P3HT, compared to many of the more advanced conjugated polymers that offer a higher efficiency, this system might still be relevant for commercial applications, where low-cost production becomes important.15 Furthermore, P3HT:PC61BM could already be a realistic option for indoor applications considering its current power conversion efficiency and lifetime.16
The P3HT:PC61BM state diagram, well-documented in literature,17–21 is crucial for a complete understanding of the phase behaviour of these mixtures, not only to obtain the desired morphology, but also to gain insight into the operating window and the thermal stability of the devices. Investigating state diagrams of OPV systems will allow fine-tuning of the processing conditions in order to further improve the morphology of the active layer and increase device efficiency. In order to maximize the efficiency of the BHJ, numerous studies concerning the effect of thermal annealing have been performed.12,21–24 This process consists of heating an as-cast active layer, in order to reorganise its structure, leading to further crystallization or aggregation.21 This thermal treatment, when optimized, leads to improved properties such as light absorption25 and charge mobility.23,25
The most common techniques used to cast the active layer in a lab scale environment are spin coating, doctor blading or drop casting. These techniques deposit a viscous film on a substrate, starting from a solution. Different processing conditions such as solvent choice, drying time and temperature, concentration and viscosity of the solution, and mixing technique can have a substantial influence on the morphology of the active layer. As a result, the performance of the solar cell will be affected. Active layers made from chlorobenzene exhibited higher short circuit current and fill factor leading to better efficiencies. For P3HT:PC61BM, a homogeneous layer was obtained when chlorobenzene was used as a solvent. However, the use of toluene or 1,2-dichlorobenzene led to the presence of an initial structure in the as-cast layer, leading to different device characteristics.21,26
Previous thermal analysis studies, utilising differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), have indicated that the state diagram of the P3HT:PC61BM system shows a eutectic behaviour.17–19,27 The eutectic composition is the composition at which the lowest melting point of a binary system is reached. At that specific composition, both components are able to solidify or melt together. Therefore, at the eutectic composition, the melting trajectory of low molecular weight materials is expected to show the highest heat flow intensity and to be the narrowest, having the lowest onset in combination with the lowest endset of melting.
The ability of the two materials to solidify together from the liquid phase at the eutectic composition leads to a fine grain structure, increasing the interface area between donor and acceptor materials.17,18 Therefore, the eutectic composition is presumed to be beneficial to obtain the optimal BHJ morphology. However, the best device efficiencies after post annealing treatment were obtained at a slightly higher content of PC61BM.18 This was explained by the need of a percolating network of the PC61BM acceptor, necessary to convey the charges to their respective electrodes, providing an overall more efficient device.18,20,28
While the potential of P3HT:PC61BM mixtures for photovoltaic devices was already reported in 2003, it was not before 2008 that its phase (state) diagram was reported in literature, showing a eutectic point at 205 °C and 65 wt% of P3HT.17
In 2011, a eutectic composition of 40 wt% P3HT was reported, and melting at 200 °C.19 The eutectic composition was found to shift to lower P3HT contents when higher molecular weight P3HT was used.18 It should be noted that P3HT:PC61BM displays a strong tendency to vitrify during solution processing.29,30 This hampered the determination of the state diagram around the eutecticum due to the absence of clear melting behaviour. Therefore, the eutectic compositions were obtained by extrapolation in all previous DSC studies, making its determination less reliable.17,18 The amorphous phase is often neglected in OPV systems. The characterization of this disordered phase is however crucial as its glass transition temperature defines the upper temperature limit under which no further morphology development would take place. Additionally, many high-performance donor polymers under investigation lack the capacity to fold into crystals.30
The main issue with previous studies regarding the detection of eutectic behaviour, is their reliance on thermal analysis techniques that use relatively slow scanning rates (10–20 K min−1). The use of slow scanning rates does not prevent further crystallization, and thus coarsening of the morphology upon heating, indicated by the presence of cold crystallization. This effect is especially important around the eutectic composition with nano-sized morphology.17,18 Cold crystallization decreases the accuracy of eutectic composition and temperature detection, by (i) modifying the original crystals formed upon cooling, and (ii) masking the onset of melting by the accompanying exothermic effect.
For this reason, rapid heat–cool calorimetry (RHC) will be used, which enables fast scanning rates up to 2000 K min−1 by using low sample masses (0.1–1 mg) in combination with an IR furnace.31–33 RHC allows for quantitative analysis of thermal transitions and is designed for high scanning rates, which is beneficial for its sensitivity to thermal transitions.33 RHC is a ideally suited to study metastable states and to amplify the small heat capacity change at the glass transition temperature (Tg), observed when a low amount of sample is present.34–38 This amplification of the amorphous phase is possible by intensifying the signal due to the higher heating and cooling rates, and by increasing the ability to quench a material by increasing the cooling rate.
Unlike small molecules, polymers melt through a melting trajectory due to their polydispersity. This melting trajectory is responsible for a broadening of the obtained melting peak,39 which reduces the accuracy of the state diagram. Therefore, a narrow molecular weight distribution (low PDI) is of importance to construct accurate state diagrams. Three low PDI P3HT fractions will therefore be used in order to decrease the broad melting trajectory of the polymer. Furthermore, it will allow an investigation of the effect of the molecular weight of P3HT on the eutectic temperature, composition and melting behaviour. Different solution mixing conditions will be employed to help narrowing the window of the eutectic composition.
Materials and techniques
PC61BM with a purity of 99% was purchased from Solenne BV. The starting batch of P3HT was a commercial sample obtained from Rieke Metals, having a regioregularity of 91–94%. Starting from this single master batch, three molecular weight fractions were obtained using preparative gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The polymer was fractionated via a JAI LC-9110 Next (recycling) preparative HPLC equipped with JAIGEL-2H and 3H columns.40,41 The molar mass distributions of all fractions were determined by GPC at 40 °C in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and calibrated against polystyrene standards. All fractions showed a PDI around 1.4 with a molecular weight (Mn) ranging from 14.9 to 89.1 kg mol−1 (see Table 1). P3HT:PC61BM mixtures were prepared by dissolving 0.5 wt% of P3HT and PC61BM in chlorobenzene. To study the influence of the mixing procedure on the state diagram, solutions were prepared by (i) stirring for 24 h, (ii) sonication for 30 minutes (Ultrasonic cleaner Branson 1510DTH) or (iii) dissolution for 24 h without active mixing (all at 25 °C). Subsequently the obtained mixtures were dropcast on a glass substrate. After 24 hours of drying at room temperature, the layers were used for thermal analysis.

Thermal analysis was performed using a rapid heat–cool calorimeter (RHC), a prototype developed by TA Instruments.31 Calibration of temperature and enthalpy was performed at a scanning rate of 500 K min−1 using indium and adamantane standards. Experiments were performed using helium (10 mL min−1) as a purge gas. Dedicated aluminum RHC crucibles were filled with sample masses in the range of 200–250 μg. A first heating was performed in order to remove thermal history. Then, slow cooling (20 K min−1) was applied to allow structure formation, followed by a high heating rate (500 K min−1) to avoid cold crystallization and reduce crystal reorganization during heating, while increasing the sensitivity of the glass transition and melting peak. All thermograms shown in this work correspond to the second heating, and this data was also used for the state diagrams. In order to construct the state diagrams, the endset of the melting transition at each composition was used to define the liquidus line, while the onset of the melting peaks at or close to the eutectic composition was considered as the (nearly constant) onset of the solidus line for all compositions.39
Results and discussion
Amorphous phase and vitrification of PC61BM
In order to study the effect of the P3HT molecular weight on the eutectic composition and temperature, a novel methodology based on RHC (see Materials and techniques) was used. The state diagrams of stirred P3HT:PC61BM were constructed using three different P3HT fractions (P3HT-1, 2 and 3 of 14.9, 32.4 and 89.1 kg mol−1, respectively). The heating traces used to construct the state diagram, based on stirred mixtures of P3HT-1 and PC61BM, are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Thermograms of stirred P3HT-1:PC61BM mixtures. The vertical dashed line represents the onset of the melting peaks close to the eutectic. The wt% of PC61BM is indicated on the right side. The curves are shifted vertically for clarity. 
When active stirring is used on the mixtures, the results indicate the eutectic composition should be located between 50-80 wt% PC61BM for P3HT-1 and P3HT-2, and between 40–80 wt% PC61BM for P3HT-3 (the thermograms and corresponding state diagrams of P3HT-2 and P3HT-3 are given in the ESI, Fig. S1–S4†). The upper limit at 80 wt% PC61BM is based on the much higher endset of melting of a PC61BM phase, indicating an overall composition richer in PC61BM compared to the eutectic composition. Sonicated mixtures show similar results (see ESI, Fig, S5–S10†).
Based on the onset temperature of the melting peak, the eutectic temperature was determined to be close to 140 °C (Fig. 1, vertical dashed line), which is at least 60 °C lower than reported until now.17–19,27 This eutectic temperature measured by RHC remarkably coincides with the glass transition of PC61BM at 139 °C (measured at 500 K min−1 after cooling at 500 K min−1; see ESI, Fig. S11†), in agreement with the previously reported value of 131 °C, measured at 2.5 K min−1 by modulated temperature DSC,21 or of 200 °C, measured at 30000 K s−1 by fast scanning chip calorimetry in a thin PC61BM layer on gold substrate.42
For compositions corresponding to the range in which the eutectic composition is expected, a reduced or even complete absence of crystallinity is observed (e.g. 60 wt% PC61BM, see Fig. 1). This can be explained by a drastic melting point depression associated with a strong crystallization point depression (in cooling) around the eutectic.
This crystallization temperature depression in combination with the vitrification of PC61BM around 139 °C hinders further crystallization. Therefore the melting transition in the subsequent heating is suppressed, impeding the construction of the liquidus line in the state diagram.
This effect becomes clearer by comparing the 50 and 60 wt% PC61BM mixtures measured at 500 K min−1 heating after 20 and 500 K min−1 cooling (see Fig. 2). When a fast cooling rate is used (500 K min−1), the 50 wt% mixture is quenched as the cold crystallization enthalpy almost equals the subsequent melting enthalpy (see Table 2). At this cooling rate, the 50 wt% PC61BM mixture has insufficient time to order through crystallization. This leads to an amorphous or nanostructured phase that further crystallizes during the subsequent heating despite the high heating rate used. In these conditions, the Tg is observed at 38 °C. But when 20 K min−1 cooling is applied to the 50 wt% mixture, the Tg measured in the following heating increased up to 66 °C (see Table 2). The following melting peak can be attributed to crystals of P3HT, which indicates that a separate phase of crystalline P3HT is formed. The resulting enrichment of the amorphous phase by the high-Tg PC61BM explains the Tg increase observed for the mixed amorphous phase. Moreover, a lower change in heat capacity is observed at 66 °C compared to the quenched mixture, explained by the lower content of amorphous P3HT. The mixture of 50 wt% PC61BM is still below the eutectic composition since P3HT is able to crystallize in a separate phase during sufficiently slow cooling.

The curves are shifted vertically for clarity.

The 60 wt% PC61BM mixture (the lower two curves of Fig. 2) remains completely amorphous for both cooling rates (the endothermic peak observed at the glass transition temperature can be attributed to endothermic relaxation, caused by the difference between cooling and heating rate). The glass transition temperature is observed at 49 °C, with a similar change in heat capacity for a preceding cooling at 20 and at 500 K min−1 (see Table 2). The fact that, at 60 wt% PC61BM, no P3HT is able to crystallize is indicating different crystallization behaviour compared to the 50 wt% PC61BM. This is supporting the fact that the eutectic composition is expected between 50 and 60 wt% PC61BM.
In previous studies in literature, using lower heating rates (10–20 K min−1), a clear melting transition was always observed for compositions around the presumed eutectic.17–19,21 These melting transitions seem to be mainly the result of a preceding cold crystallisation.17,18 In this work using RHC, cold crystallization is almost entirely prevented around the eutectic composition (see Fig. 1, 2 and ESI†). The absence of a clear melting transition around the eutectic composition is an indication of a mixture which is mainly amorphous or an indication of the presence of nanocrystals that cannot be detected by RHC. The high and nearly constant change in heat capacity at the Tg for 50 and 60 wt% PC61BM mixtures that show no melting peak (see Fig. 2 and Table 2) supports the amorphous nature of mixtures around the eutectic. These results highlight the important role of the amorphous phase in organic photovoltaic devices which is often neglected in literature.
Slow cooling, fast heating
In order to confirm previous statements and more accurately determine the eutectic composition, crystallization during the cooling step should be enhanced in order to obtain a detectable onset and endset temperature of the melting peak, which can then be used to construct the state diagram. Two options are available to reach this goal; the first is to further decrease the cooling rate, the second to increase the crystallization rate of the amorphous mixtures.
The first approach was applied to P3HT-1:PC61BM mixtures composed of 50, 55, 60 and 70 wt% PC61BM by further decreasing the cooling rate from 20 K min−1 to 1 K min−1. The results are shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Thermograms of 70, 60, 55 and 50 wt% PC61BM (from top to bottom). The full and dashed curves were obtained at 500 K min−1 heating after cooling at 1 K min−1 and 20 K min−1, respectively. Vertical dashed lines represent the onset of melting for each mixture. 
The thermograms obtained following a 1 K min−1 cooling rate (full line) show clear melting transitions compared to the thermograms following 20 K min−1 cooling (dashed curves). It can also be seen that the increase in crystallinity is made at the expense of the amorphous phase, leading to smaller Tg step. The high-temperature melting transition around 290 °C for 55, 60 and 70 wt% PC61BM mixtures corresponds to the melting peak of a PC61BM phase. Therefore, these three mixtures contain more PC61BM than the eutectic composition. However, the 50 wt% PC61BM mixture does not show a high-temperature melting peak indicating that this mixture contains less PC61BM than the eutectic composition. These measurements allow a more accurate determination of the corresponding state diagram of P3HT-1:PC61BM without interference of cold crystallization (see Fig. 4). Using this approach, the eutectic is obtained between 50 and 55 wt% PC61BM.

Full and open symbols represent the endset (circles) and onset (diamonds) of the melting peak of RHC thermograms obtained from mixtures previously cooled at 20 K min−1 and 1 K min−1, respectively. The vertical dashed lines represent the composition range of the eutectic. 
Preceding solution processing
The second approach to increase the melting transition around the eutectic composition consists in increasing the crystallization rate of P3HT:PC61BM, e.g. by changing the solution processing conditions to obtain the mixtures.
The effect of solution processing was first investigated using solutions of pure PC61BM. 0.5 wt% PC61BM solutions in chlorobenzene were prepared by sonication for 30 minutes, stirring for 24 hours, or dissolution during 24 h without active mixing (see Materials and techniques). After dropcasting the solutions were dried on a glass substrate during 24 h. Fig. 5 shows that the mixing procedure has a strong influence on the crystallization rate of pure PC61BM. Table 3 summarizes the melting enthalpies and heat capacity change at Tg of PC61BM for the three different dissolution conditions. It seems that sonication almost prevents crystallization during cooling, which can be seen from the relatively high change in heat capacity at Tg and the cold crystallization enthalpy which almost equals the melting enthalpy. Stirring leads to a higher melting enthalpy than the sonicated PC61BM solution (after subtraction of cold crystallization in case of sonication) meaning that more crystals were created during the preceding cooling. This is supported by the lower change in heat capacity at Tg. When no active mixing is applied during dissolution of PC61BM, a low change of heat capacity at Tg is observed and the melting enthalpy is further increased. Since the same cooling rate (20 K min−1) was applied to the three samples, the rate of crystallization is obviously highest when no active mixing is applied. This can be explained by the presence of aggregates remaining in the ‘homogeneous’ solution. The presence of nanometer sized aggregates in P3HT:PC61BM dry films was previously confirmed when no active mixing was performed on chlorobenzene solutions.43

These aggregates were presumably broken down by active stirring or sonication. The presence of PC61BM aggregates as nucleating agents could explain the strong effect on the crystallization kinetics of pure PCB61M, as noticed in the RHC results of Fig. 5 and Table 3. A similar effect was reported in literature when C60 was added to a P3HT:PC61BM mixtures, leading to “a dramatic effect on the nucleation and growth of PC61BM crystallites”.44 It is important to note that the usual thermal analysis procedure, where the first heating is used to erase thermal history, does not seem to remove these aggregates. In other words, the preceding solution processing is still observable in the second heating of the RHC thermograms.
Based on the faster rate observed for pure PC61BM, a similar procedure without active mixing was used for the P3HT:PC61BM mixtures. The RHC curves of P3HT-1:PC61BM mixtures are shown in Fig. 6 and the related state diagram in Fig. 7. The mixtures obtained without active mixing containing more than 50 wt% PC61BM show more significant melting transitions compared to actively mixed P3HT-1:PC61BM mixtures (compare Fig. 1 and 6). A slightly higher endset of melting is observed without active mixing (80–100 wt% PC61BM, Fig. 7). This is probably due to the crystallization of these mixtures at a higher temperature during cooling due to the effect of PC61BM aggregates. It is important to notice that the thermal transitions were not particularly affected by the change of mixing procedure for all mixtures containing less than 55 wt% PC61BM (see Fig. 7). Due to the much faster crystallization rate of P3HT, compared to PC61BM,45 the P3HT crystallization is probably not influenced significantly by the presence of PC61BM aggregates as a result of the preceding dissolution without active mixing. Therefore the melting transitions of these compositions are comparable irrespective the mixing procedure.

 Fig. 7  State diagram of P3HT-1:PC61BM mixtures prepared with (full symbols) and without active mixing (open symbols). Onset and endset of melting are respectively represented by diamonds and circles. The vertical dashed lines represent the composition window of the eutectic. 
Based on this second approach to increase the crystallization rate, especially of PC61BM, a eutectic composition was determined between 50–55 wt% PC61BM for P3HT-1, and 50–70 wt% PC61BM for P3HT-2 and P3HT-3. This was based on the much higher endset temperature of melting observed at 55 wt% PC61BM for P3HT-1 (Fig. 7), and at 70 wt% PC61BM for P3HT-2 and P3HT-3 (see ESI, Fig. S12–S15†).
The onset of melting around the eutectic composition is observed at 140 °C (see Fig. 6 and 7 for P3HT-1 and ESI, Fig. S12 and S14† for P3HT-2 and P3HT-3). This onset temperature of melting is still consistent with the value observed in case of active mixing (see Fig. 1 and 4).
Combined effect
The range of the eutectic composition is significantly reduced without active mixing. This improvement in the determination of the eutectic composition is more pronounced for the lowest molecular weight fraction of P3HT, while the range is still wider for higher molecular weight P3HT (see ESI Fig. S13 and S15†). The crystallization rate is known to slow down when the molecular weight increases due to a higher melt viscosity.46 The decrease in crystallization rate of P3HT and PC61BM induces a decrease of the crystallinity of the overall mixture, which, combined with the vitrification of PC61BM leads to seemingly amorphous mixtures.
Therefore, the combination of the two approaches was applied to the high molecular weight systems. A slow cooling of 1 K min−1 was applied on the mixtures prepared without active solution mixing. The combination of the two approaches applied on two different compositions (55 and 65 wt% PC61BM) of P3HT-3:PC61BM is shown in Fig. 8. A high-temperature melting peak (which corresponds to a PC61BM phase) is observed for the 65 wt% PC61BM mixture. The 55 wt% PC61BM mixture did not exhibit such a high endet of melting, indicating that the eutectic composition is expected in between these two compositions. Note the pronounced endothermic enthalpy relaxation peak at the glass transition temperature, caused by a slow cooling rate (1 K min−1) in combination with a fast heating rate (500 K min−1) and particularly observed for the high molecular weight P3HT fractions.

The curves represent compositions of 65 wt% PC61BM (full line) and 55 wt% PC61BM (dashed line). The arrow indicates the position of the melting peak of PC61BM. The curves are shifted vertically for clarity. 
The combined approach led to a much more precise determination of the eutectic composition for the high molecular weight systems P3HT-2 and P3HT-3 as shown in Table 4. Eutectic composition ranges of 50–55 wt% PC61BM for P3HT-1, 55–60 wt% PC61BM for P3HT-2 (see ESI, Fig. S16†), and 55–65 wt% PC61BM for P3HT-3 were obtained. This is a major improvement compared to the composition windows for samples prepared by active stirring and cooled at 20 K min−1.

Conclusions
Three molecular weight fractions of P3HT were used in order to characterize the effect of the molecular weight on the eutectic composition and temperature, as well as to obtain sharper thermal transitions due to a lower PDI. Mixtures of P3HT:PC61BM were investigated using rapid heat–cool calorimetry. RHC allowed for increased heating rates (500 K min−1). In this way, cold crystallization could be drastically minimized or suppressed around the eutectic composition.
It was shown that vitrification of PC61BM during cooling prevented crystallization of P3HT:PC61BM mixtures close to the eutectic composition, which complicates the determination of the state diagram.
In order to improve the accuracy of the state diagram and the eutectic composition, it is important to optimize ordering during the cooling step of the P3HT:PC61BM mixtures. This was achieved by two different approaches. The first consisted in reducing the cooling rate down to 1 K min−1. The second method involved the modification of the solution mixing procedure to prepare the P3HT:PC61BM samples, allowing a higher rate of crystallization of the mixtures. These two approaches permitted a more accurate determination of the eutectic composition. Eutectic composition ranges of 50–55 wt% PC61BM (for 14.9 kg mol−1 P3HT), 55–60 wt% PC61BM (for 32.4 kg mol−1 P3HT), and 55–65 wt% PC61BM (for 89.1 kg mol−1 P3HT) were obtained.
The onset temperature of melting of the eutectic, used to determine the onset of the solidus line in the state diagram, was observed around 140 °C for all P3HT fractions, regardless the mixing procedure. This value is almost 60 °C lower than the one proposed in literature. This more accurate measure of the eutectic temperature was achieved due to the important reduction or complete absence of cold crystallization in the RHC thermograms by combining high heating rates with low PDI P3HT samples. This eutectic temperature was found close to the glass transition temperature of pure PC61BM (139 °C in RHC).
These findings are of importance for understanding the phase behaviour in P3HT:PC61BM mixtures, still an important OPV reference system. The paper highlights the importance of the amorphous phase and the crucial role of vitrification of PC61BM to develop the bulk heterojunction morphology of P3HT:PC61BM active layers. The developed methodology may also be used to study active layers based on more novel donor–acceptor systems, and accurately construct the corresponding state diagrams in combination with complementary techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or X-ray diffraction (XRD). These insights can contribute to design an optimized nanomorphology with optimal OPV performance.
