1. Introduction
Organic synthesis being a creative science attracts particular attention because of its immense importance to life and society since from drugs to polymers to synthetic fuels there are few areas of life today where one does not feel the impact of organic synthesis. The strategies regarding construction and cleavage of bonds represent the central theme in organic synthesis. A major challenge of modern synthesis is to design not only efficient and selective cascades, but also to be eco-compatible that provides maximum structural diversity and complexity with a minimum number of synthetic steps. Therefore, new protocols in terms of efficiency, minimal environmental hazards, operational simplicity, and high selectivity are still demanding and would be of great relevance to synthetic, material, and medicinal chemists.

β-Oxodithioesters were first envisaged in 1968 by Beer and co-workers1a and they opened up a new dynamic field in synthetic organic chemistry which may be assumed as a parallel to the chemistry of 1,3-dicarbonyl synthons. From the last few decades, β-oxodithioesters are widely used as synthons in the synthesis of several organosulfur moieties where the sulfur atom is present in the ring entity or as an external substituent. Due to their extensive presence in cysteine, methionine, and ferredoxins (the sulfur containing amino acids and proteins) as well as in pentathiepin molecules, which have antifungal, antitumor, and antimicrobial properties. Sulfur is considered as a very important element in bio-molecular systems. Further, their applications as functional materials in rubber industry, polymer chemistry, pharmaceutical industry, as anti-oxidant and anti-radiation agents, the industrial interest can hardly be overstated.1
Synthesis and application of β-ketoesters2 have been known for many decades and are discussed in reviews and in several books. β-Ketoesters act as initial synthon in the synthesis of several different heterocycles. Some examples are Claisen isoxazole synthesis, Hantzsh pyrrole synthesis, Pechmann coumarin synthesis, Biginelli pyrimidone synthesis, Beirut reaction towards synthesis of quinoxaline-1,4-dioxides from benzofurazan oxide, Feist-Benary furan synthesis, Combs, Conrad-Limpach, Friedlander quinoline synthesis, Fischer, Japp–Klingemann indole synthesis, Knorr pyrrazole synthesis and many more. Despite structural similarities, due to difference in electronic configuration of the sulfur atom in β-oxodithioesters i.e., the presence of vacant d-orbital, chemistry of β-oxodithioesters shows a distinctive feature from β-ketoesters in terms of their synthesis and applications in various organic transformations. β-Oxodithioesters exist in their enolic form and henceforth are very susceptible towards complex formation with several different metal salts which make β-oxodithioesters a hit in inorganic chemistry.3
Because of the significance of this scaffold both from theoretical and synthetic points of view, tremendous progress has been achieved in this field during the past two decades. The continual renewal of interest in the chemistry of this framework is mainly due to its two electrophilic and three nucleophilic centres (Fig. 1) coupled with its versatile reactivity, making it a very useful building block with a valuable impact in modern organic synthesis. Even though β-oxodithioesters have several promising prospects in synthetic organic chemistry, only a little has been done so far. The diverse chemical nature and broad synthetic utility of β-oxodithioesters have made chemists busily explore its chemistry over the last few decades. To explore this new field of research, documentation of information regarding its synthesis and scope of utility is very helpful. The goal of this review is to cover the efforts of the chemical community in the development of new methodologies and novel scaffolds utilizing β-oxodithioesters and their wide applications in various transformations since this field has not been reviewed so far. The objective of the present contribution is to cover comprehensively the abundant literature from the early beginning up to December 2012, giving a special emphasis on the development of new synthetic approaches for their preparation and their reactivity as versatile intermediates.
2. Reaction profiles of β-oxodithioesters
The chemical properties of the β-oxodithioester can be determined by the presence of three nucleophilic and two electrophilic centres as shown in Fig. 1. Two nucleophilic centres are localized on the oxygen and sulfur atom associated with the carbonyl and the thiocarbonyl groups. The third one is present on the carbon atom, bounded by the carbonyl and the thiocarbonyl group as shown below. The two electrophilic centres are present on two different carbon atoms bearing carbonyl and thiocarbonyl groups. Due to the presence of those active centres, the reactions of β-oxodithioesters with various dielectrophilic reagents may lead, depending on the structure and nature of the starting dielectrophile, and the reaction conditions, to the formation of various heterocyclic systems where the sulfur atom is present in the ring system or as an external substituent.

3. Synthesis of β-oxodithioesters
To begin this segment first we need to know about the methods for the synthesis of dithioester 2. Grignard reagents prepared from various alkyl and aryl halides underwent smooth addition to carbon disulfide and the subsequent alkylation with the alkyl halides leads to dithioester 2 (Scheme 1).4 Few other reported methods for the synthesis of dithioesters include the thioacylation of thioacyl halide and thioacyl anhydride and thioketenes.5 In addition to Grignard reagent other organometallic reagents like butyl lithium and organo copper reagents are employed for the transformation.6 Detailed processes for the synthesis of dithioesters have been described in a review by Ramdas and co-workers.7
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of dithioesters using Grignard reagents. 
Konen and co-workers have synthesized the dithioesters of long chain carboxylic acids. For example, nonanoic acid was first converted to the lithium enolate 3, which upon reaction with carbon disulfide followed by alkylation with methyl iodide and subsequent decarboxylation gave methyl dithiooctanoate 4 (Scheme 2).8
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of dithioesters of long chain carboxylic acids. 
Beslin and Houtteville utilized dithioester 2 in the synthesis of β-oxodithioesters 1 by regiocontrolled condensation of dithioester 2 and aldehyde followed by oxidation of the β-hydroxydithioester 2′ so formed (Scheme 3).9
 Scheme 3  Conversion of dithioester to β-oxodithioester. 
Thuillier et al. first used an active methylene compound 5 and carbon disulfide for the synthesis of β-oxodithioester 1.10 An enolizable ketone 5 is treated with a strong base like sodium tert-pentoxide to generate the enolate anion that further reacts with CS2 to provide the sodium salt of dithiocarboxylic acid 6, which is alkylated to the respective β-oxodithioester 1 (Scheme 4). Other active methylene compounds such as diethyl malonate, methyl cyanoacetate, malononitrile, acetyl acetone, benzoyl acetone and dibenzoyl methane also reacted similarly to give the corresponding functionalized dithioesters.
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of β-oxodithioesters using carbon disulfide. 
Depending on the structure of β-oxodithioester 1, many other advanced methods have been developed but a very convenient and general method was described by Junjappa and co-workers. In this method active methylene ketones 5 were stirred with (S,S)-dimethyl trithiocarbonate 7 in the presence of NaH in DMF–hexane (1:4) mixture at room temperature (Scheme 5).11 Alternatively, Junjappa et al.12 showed the utilization of 3-methylimidazolium-1-carbodithioic acid methyl ester 8 instead of dimethyltrithiocarbonate along with active methylene compounds 5 for the synthesis of β-oxodithioesters 1 (Scheme 6).

 Scheme 6  Synthesis of β-oxodithioesters. 
Smith et al. synthesized α-cyano-β-oxodithioester 11 (Scheme 7) and used it as a precursor towards the synthesis of thiophene substituted aminopyrimidine compounds as polo-like kinase 1 inhibitors and was utilized for the treatment of cancer.13
 Scheme 7  Synthesis of α-cyano-β-oxodithioesters 11 using S,S-diaryltrithiocarbonate 9. 

α-Oxoketene-S,S-dithioacetals 12 can be converted to the β-oxodithioester 1 after treatment with the sodium salt of dimethyl sulfoxide (Scheme 8).14
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of β-oxodithioesters from α-oxoketene-S,S-dithioacetals. 
Nair and Asokan reported a convenient approach to transform α-oxoketene-S,S-dithioacetals 12 to β-oxodithioesters 1 through sulfo-hydrolysis of the former by reacting with hydrogen sulfide catalyzed by BF3–Et2O in dioxane (Scheme 9).15

4. Functionalization of β-oxodithioesters
Numerous research groups have practiced functionalization of β-oxodithioesters for the use in different synthetic contexts for various purposes. In this segment only the functionalization part is summarized. β-oxodithioester can be easily converted to α-oxoketene-S,S-acetals 12, β-oxothioamides 13 or α-oxoketene-N,S-acetals 14, which themselves are very well-known and valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. Suma and Asokan16a treated β-oxodithioester 1 with Vielsmayer–Haack reagent to afford the chlorinated product 15. Vigante et al.16b transformed β-oxodithioester into alkyl β-aminodithiocrotonate 16. Labiad and Villemin16c reported the process of selective transformation of the thiocarbonyl group to carbonyl group using seleninic anhydride (Scheme 10). Some of these synthons have been used for the synthesis of sulfur containing heterocyclic systems.16d
 Scheme 10  Transformation of β-oxodithioesters to other synthons. 
Itoh et al.17a first described the stereoselective reduction of the keto group of β-oxodithioester 1 by using baker yeast as catalyst where threo-isomer 18 was obtained as the exclusive product (Scheme 11).17a,b Interestingly, treatment of the β-hydroxydithioesters 18 so formed with copper chloride/copper oxide leads to the formation of β-hydroxyester 19.17c The reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature in an ethanol–water solvent mixture with high optical purity.
 Scheme 11  Reduction of the carbonyl group of β-oxodithioesters. 

α-Allyl substituted 1,3-diketone compounds are known as useful intermediates in organic synthesis. Junjappa et al. synthesized and utilized structurally similar α-allyl-β-oxodithioester 21.18 They performed the transformation via S-alkylation of β-oxodithioester 1 with allyl bromide in the presence of K2CO3 in acetone followed by [3+3] thio-Claisen rearrangement (Scheme 12).
 Scheme 12  Synthesis of α-allylic dithioesters. 
Masson and Thuillier19 reported an interesting chemoselective addition of organometallic reagents to enethiolizable β-oxodithioester 1 towards the synthesis of β-hydroxydithioester 18 and described some potential synthetic uses of these synthons (Scheme 13).
 Scheme 13  Functionalization of β-oxodithioesters through organometallic addition. 
A wide applicability of β-oxodithioesters is found when a pyridine group substitutes the α-position of the ester. Pyridine substituted dithioester can easily be synthesized via a two step procedure as shown in Scheme 14.20 In the first step pyridine 24 and 2-haloketone 25 reacts to produce substituted pyridine 26. Which after treatment with carbon disulfide and alkyl iodide in the presence of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) afforded the α-substituted pyridinium salt of dithioester 27 (Scheme 14).
 Scheme 14  Synthesis of pyridine substituted dithioesters. 
A new type of potassium channel opener 33, and 34 have been synthesized by Brown and co-workers.21 Here, the pyridine substituted cyclohexanone 28 has been taken as the active methylene compound for the corresponding β-oxodithioester 29, which is transformed to α,β-unsaturated nitrile 30 by reaction with diethyl(cyanomethyl)phosphonate under Wadsworth–Emmons modification of the Wittig reaction. The Wittig product was further transformed to products 33, and 34 by the following methods (Scheme 15).

5. Synthetic applications of β-oxodithioesters
Synthetic organic chemistry (SOC) occupying a central role in every area of our increasingly technological society, retains its importance as it is an integral part of new drug discovery, and is the basis of the bulk of the chemical industry. Synthesis of heterocycles is a key to organic synthesis, since heterocycles are indispensable materials in the functioning of any developed society. Simple polyfunctional molecules are ideal starting materials in diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS), which aims at providing quick access to libraries of molecules. Synthons containing both electrophilic and nucleophilic sites have great potential in developing new reaction pathways. One such synthon is β-oxodithioester, a thio-analogue of the normal β-ketoester with general formula 1 (Fig. 1).
5.1. Synthesis of monocyclic heteroaromatics
The interest in synthesizing monocyclic heteroaromatics has always been enormous. Among heterocycles, the six- and five-membered O-, N- and S-heterocycles are probably one of the most common structural motifs spread across natural products, from simple to structurally complex metabolites present in the structure of several biologically interesting compounds. Although particularly attractive, direct annulation reactions onto the heterocyclic framework from acyclic precursors still constitute an important synthetic challenge. However, some interesting approaches involving β-oxodithioesters have been recently proposed from various research groups and are presented here.

5.1.1. With one heteroatom. 
Thiophene derivatives have attracted considerable interest due to their presence in a broad spectrum of natural and synthetic organic molecules.23 Thiophene derivatives are identified as the core structure of various drugs like Plavix, Articaine and Patrine. Furthermore, thiophene derivatives also find applications as functional materials in electrically conducting organic materials, semi-conductors, organic light emitting diodes (OLED), and organic solar cells. Among numerous reported synthetic routes to thiophene, the Gewald method that involves the condensation of sulfur, a α-methylene carbonyl compound and a α-cyanoester, is most utilised and popular.
Forgber and co-workers have synthesized a highly functionalized thiophene ring from α-cyanosubstituted-β-oxodithioester 35.22 The chloromethylation of β-oxodithioester with bromochloroethane in the presence of sodium methoxide in methanol and TEBAC afforded the α-oxoketene dithioacetal 36 which undergoes substitution followed by condensation after treatment with phenyl sulfinic acid in refluxing acetone and furnished the thiophene ring 37 (Scheme 16).
 Scheme 16  Synthesis of substituted thiophenes. 
Smith et al. synthesized the cyano substituted thiophene ring 39 by the reaction of α-cyano-β-oxodithioester 11 (mentioned in Scheme 7) and 2-chloroacetone 38 in presence of potassium carbonate in DMF at 50 °C which was further transformed to thiophene substituted aminopyrimidine 40 and used for the treatment of cancer through inhibiting polo-like kinase 1 (Scheme 17).13
 Scheme 17  Synthesis of substituted thiophenes and aminopyrimidines. 
Asokan and co-workers synthesized thiophenes 43 through the alkylation of β-oxodithioester 1 with α-haloketones 41 using potassium carbonate in acetone that yielded α-oxoketene-S,S-dithioacetal 42 as an intermediate which after treatment with acetic acid at 120 °C produced the desired thiophene molecules 43 (Scheme 18).23a
 Scheme 18  Synthesis of thiophenes. 
Interestingly, when the same reaction was performed in the presence of sodium hydroxide in ethanol, substituted thiophene 44 was found to form which is structurally quite different from 43 in terms of the position of the substituent (Scheme 19). The method was extended successfully with α-substituted-β-oxodithioester as well as cyclic β-oxodithioester.23a Condensed thiophene derivatives of type 44 were synthesized by Moeller et al. from β-oxodithioester of dimedone and were used by Novo Nordisk As as cyclic nonpeptide GLP-1 agonists.23b
 Scheme 19  Synthesis of thiophenes. 
Hanedanian and co-workers have introduced the reaction of β-oxodithioester 1 and substituted ethylpropiolate 45 in presence of triphenylphosphine, acetic acid/sodium acetate in toluene at 80 °C for the synthesis of dihydrothiophene 47 (Scheme 20).23c The reaction was expected to proceed via the α-carbon addition driven by PPh3. The resulting adduct 46 then underwent cyclisation generating dihydrothiophene 47 in reasonable yield.
 Scheme 20  Synthesis of dihydrothiophenes. 
An efficient and experimentally rapid protocol for the synthesis of 2,3-dicarboalkoxy-4-aroyl/heteroaroyl/alkanoyl thiophenes 49 has been developed by M. S. Singh et al. via 1-2 (C–S) and 3-4 (C–C) bond connections catalyzed by 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in DCM (Scheme 21).23d
 Scheme 21  Synthesis of trisubstituted thiophenes. 
The plausible reaction scenario for this one-pot two-component heteroannulation has been proposed and is outlined in Scheme 22. The first step in the mechanism is believed to be the abstraction of the acidic proton of β-ketodithioester 1 by DMAP followed by nucleophilic attack on the sp hybridized carbon of the dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate 48 to generate an open-chain adduct α-oxoketene dithioacetal A that undergoes intramolecular cyclocondensation via C–C bond formation with the extrusion of MeSH to give the thiophene derivative 49. The intermediacy of α-oxoketene dithioacetal A has been confirmed by its isolation and characterization when TEA was utilized as base.
 Scheme 22  Thiophene formation via α-oxoketenedithioacetals. 
The pyrrole nucleus is present in numerous bio-active natural products like Lukianol A, lamellarins, ningalins, policitones, halitulin etc. These compounds have considerable cytotoxic activity and can be used as multi drug resistant (MDR) removal agents. Moreover, they act as a highly versatile class of intermediates in the organic synthesis of natural products as well as in heterocyclic chemistry.24,25 A very common method for the synthesis of pyrrole is via Paal–Knorr synthesis which involves the reaction of 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds and an amine.
A straightforward and simple method for the synthesis of highly substituted and fused pyrrole has been developed by Asokan and co-workers via the reaction of β-oxodithioester 1 and glycine esters in the presence of triethylamine in refluxing alcohol.24 In the process β-oxodithioester 1 was initially treated with free glycine in alcohol that produced the corresponding thioamide 50 almost in a quantitative amount which then undergoes facile alkylation in the presence of potassium carbonate with alkyl iodide in acetone to produce α-oxoketene-N,S-acetal 51 which further undergoes iminoalkylation followed by intramolecular cyclization in presence of Vilsmeier–Haack reagent to afford highly substituted pyrroles 52 (Scheme 23). Similar treatment of α-substituted β-oxodithioester resulted in the structurally different thiophene ring 56 as shown in Scheme 24. Synthesis of two pyrrole containing natural products lukianol A 59 and lamellarin O dimethyl ether 60 was reported in the same literature (Scheme 25).24
 Scheme 23  Synthesis of substituted pyrroles. 
 Scheme 24  Synthesis of pyrrole rings. 
 Scheme 25  Synthesis of lukianol A and a derivative of lamellarin O. 
Asokan and co-workers have developed another route for the synthesis of pyrrole derivative 62 from the intermediate N,S-acetal 61 derived from β-oxodithioester 1 (Scheme 26).25 Treatment of N,S-acetal with the non nucleophilic base DBU in refluxing toluene afforded the trisubstituted pyrrole ring 62. A variety of substituents were utilized successfully and the yield of 62 could be increased by adding DBU in three portions at equal intervals.
 Scheme 26  Synthesis of pyrroles. 
A highly convergent and regioselective heteroannulation protocol for the synthesis of highly substituted 2-amino-4-(aryl/alkyl)-5-(aroyl/heteroaroyl)-3-(cyano/carboalkoxy)-6-methylthio-4H-thiopyran derivatives 65 has been developed by M. S. Singh et al. via one-pot three-component domino coupling of β-oxodithioesters 1, aldehydes 63, and malononitrile/ethyl or methyl cyanoacetate 64, promoted by 4-dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP) in dichloromethane (DCM) as well as under solvent-free conditions in excellent yields (Scheme 27).26
 Scheme 27  Synthesis of substituted 4H-thiopyrans. 


5. 1. 2. With more than one heteroatom. 
Thiazole rings have been identified as a central feature of a number of biologically active natural products which exhibit significant biological activities such as cytotoxic, immunosuppressive, antifungal, and enzyme inhibitory activity. In view of their wide biological activity, their synthesis still holds the interest of chemists. One of the most oldest and popular method is the Hantzsch's thiazole synthesis which involves the reaction of α-halo ketones and thioureas or thioamides. Many other methods also have been developed such as Tchernic, Cook–Heilborn and Gabriel thiazole synthesis.27a
Ila and co-workers have introduced a new procedure where the β-oxodithioester was chosen as the precursor for thiazole formation as shown in Scheme 28. The reaction of β-oxodithioester 1 with primary amine in refluxing ethanol leads to the formation of thioamide 66 which after purification was treated with methyl iodide in the presence of potassium carbonate that afforded the α-oxoketene-N,S-acetal 67. This highly polarised oxoketene-N,S-acetal 67 was subjected to a reaction with thionyl chloride in presence of pyridine base to provide highly substituted thiazole 73 in good to excellent yield.27b
 Scheme 28  Synthesis of trisubstituted thiazoles. 
In 1989 Eiichi Ohsugi and co-workers developed an entirely new route for the synthesis of thiazole rings with an exocyclic double bond from the precursor β-oxodithioester 74.27c The method follows a two-step procedure where in the first step the β-oxodithioester reacts with the propargyl amine, providing the corresponding thioamide 75 which after treatment with the triethylamine underwent an intramolecular cyclization leading to the thiazole ring 76 with an exocyclic double bond. These thiazoline moieties in presence of p-TsOH undergo isomerization furnishing 77 which exhibits good natriuretic activity (Scheme 29).
 Scheme 29  Synthesis of disubstituted thiazoles. 
Another protocol for the synthesis of thiazoline ring 79 with exocyclic double bond has been described by Chandrasekharam et al.27d The reaction proceeds via the nucleophilic substitution of the –SMe group by propargylamine followed by the intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the thiocarbonyl sulfur on the triple bond of the β-oxo-N-propargylthioamide 78 intermediate (Scheme 30). The method has been successfully extended to cyclic β-oxodithioester 80 (Scheme 31).
 Scheme 30  Synthesis of thiazolidines. 
 Scheme 31  Synthesis of thiazolidines. 
Yagihara and Suzuki have synthesized the thiazole containing molecules 83 which have been identified as very useful intermediates for agrochemicals, medicines etc., especially as an intermediate for an acrylonitrile derivative which is an active ingredient for insecticides or acaricides. α-Cyano substituted dithioester 81 was treated with 2′,6′-difluoro-2-bromoacetophenone 82 in the presence of sodium bicarbonate base in acetonitrile followed by ammonia in ethanol (Scheme 32).27d
 Scheme 32  Synthesis of functionalized thiazoles. 
Reaction of β-oxodithioesters 1 with α-haloketones 41 such as phenacylbromide or bromoacetone afforded substituted 2-ylidene-1,3-oxathiols 85 in good yield (Scheme 33).28 In the initial step of this reaction, β-oxodithioesters 1 reacted with α-haloketone 41 to give the intermediate ketene dithioacetal 84 which further underwent an intramolecular base induced hetero nucleophilic addition of the enolate anion to the ketene dithioacetal moiety to furnish substituted 1,3-oxathiols 85.
 Scheme 33  Substituted 1,3-oxathiols formation via α-oxoketenedithioacetals. 
In Schemes 17, 18 and 19 we discussed regioselective reaction of α-substituted-β-oxodithioesters 1 with α-haloketones towards the synthesis of three different kinds of substituted thiophene rings whereas in Schemes 32 and 33 the same reaction partners are yielding thiazoles and 1,3-oxathiols respectively. Dependency of catalyst and reaction conditions towards reaction mode and regioselective formation of several different kinds of heterocycles is illustrated in the following scheme (Scheme 34).
 Scheme 34  Synthesis of various five-membered heterocycles. 
Junjappa et al. have synthesized 3-thiomethyl substituted pyrazole 86 regioselectively by treating β-oxodithioester 1 with phenyl hydrazine in refluxing ethanol (Scheme 35).29a The reaction was faster with improved yield when a catalytic amount of AcOH was used.
 Scheme 35  Regioselective synthesis of pyrazoles. 
M. S. Singh et al. have developed an efficient and highly regioselective protocol for the synthesis of 5-amino substituted pyrazoles via a one-pot three-component cyclocondensation of β-oxodithioester, amine, and hydrazine in refluxing EtOH in the presence of a catalytic amount of AcOH (Scheme 36).29b The reported densely functionalized pyrazoles 88 have been constructed through the cyclization of in situ generated thioamide intermediate 87 from β-oxodithioester 1. Several β-oxodithioesters (80) obtained from cyclic ketones such as cyclohexanone, α-tetralone also provided amino substituted fused pyrazoles 89 in good yield with a variety of cyclic amines and substituted hydrazines (Scheme 37). Use of primary amine in the reaction also afforded good yield and the results are shown in Scheme 38.

 Scheme 37  Synthesis of fused pyrazoles. 
 Scheme 38  Synthesis of 5-alkylaminopyrazoles. 
Treatment of 3-(benzofuran-2-yl)-3-oxopropanenitrile 93 with carbon disulfide in presence of potassium hydroxide in DMF and successive addition of methyl iodide provided the corresponding dithioester 94 in good yield. Hydrazonyl halide was added to the dithioester to provide the 2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivative 95 (Scheme 39).30
 Scheme 39  Synthesis of 2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives. 
In 2009 Singh and Devi utilized β-oxodithioester in a multicomponent reaction for the first time.31a They employed this molecule as an alternative to the 1,3-dicarbonyl compound and applied it in the Biginelli reaction. A series of dihydropyrimidinones 96 were synthesized through the Biginelli reaction of β-oxodithioester 1, aromatic aldehydes and the ureas at 100 °C in the presence of catalyst SnCl2·2H2O under solvent-free conditions (Scheme 40). It takes almost 3–4 h to complete and provided the corresponding Biginelli products in 70–82% yield. Our group reported the same reaction with an improvement in the reaction process. We employed silica–sulfuric acid as recyclable heterogeneous catalysts. The use of urea in this reaction increases the yield of the product; in the absence of urea a decrement of yield was observed (Scheme 40).31b
 Scheme 40  Synthesis of dihydropyrimidones. 
The plausible mechanism of this Biginelli reaction has been drawn in Scheme 41. The first step is believed to be the condensation between the aldehyde and urea, with some similarities to the Mannich condensation to generate A. The iminium intermediate B acts as an electrophile for the nucleophilic addition of the dithioester 1. The ketone carbonyl of the resulting open-chain ureide adduct C undergoes cyclocondensation with the urea NH2 followed by dehydration (facilitated by SiO2–H2SO4) to give the cyclized product 97.

Singh and Devi utilized β-oxodithioester 1 and o-hydroxysubstituted aldehydes 98 in the synthesis of substituted 2H-chromene-2-thione 99 (Scheme 42).31a During the course of the reaction it was observed that the utilization of urea increases the yield of the product but in absence of urea it provided moderate yields. Urea was expected to be acting as a promoter in the reaction. They extended their protocol by reacting 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde with several aliphatic, aromatic and heteroaromatic β-oxodithioesters in the presence of a catalytic amount of CuCl2 under solvent free conditions (Scheme 42).31c Piperidine mediated synthesis of 3-alkanoyl/aroyl/heteroaroyl-2H-chromene-2-thiones and evaluation of their antioxidant nature was reported by the same group.31d M. S. Singh et al. have employed silica–sulfuric acid as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst in this reaction and elaborated an improved methodology.31b
 Scheme 42  Synthesis of chromene-2-thiones. 
A plausible mechanism for the synthesis of chromene-2-thione 99 is presented below. Condensation of salicylaldehyde 98 and β-ketodithioester 1 and successive elimination of MeSH provides the condensation product A that undergoes enolization to B which then participates in the subsequent intramolecular aldol condensation to provide 2H-chromene-2-thiones 99 (Scheme 43).

M. S. Singh et al. further reported InCl3 mediated solvent free synthesis of aroyl or alkanoyl substituted chromene-2-thione as well as coumarin derivatives31e and evaluated anti-leishmanial activity of the chromene-2-thione analogues.31f One of the most interesting features of the above synthesis is the selectivity dependency of the product formation with the promoter urea i.e., in presence of urea chromene-2-thione 99 derivatives are the exclusive products but in the absence of urea, coumarin derivatives 100 are the major component (Scheme 44).

Thiochromone derivatives are known to exhibit versatile pharmacological activity. In a recent article M. S. Singh et al. have developed a mild, efficient annulation protocol for highly functionalized thiochromene derivatives 102via a one-pot reaction of β-oxodithioester 1, aldehyde and cyclic-1,3-diketone 101 under solvent-free conditions at 100 °C within 1.5–2.5 h catalyzed by P2O5 (Scheme 45).32 This is the first report for thiochromone synthesis via multicomponent ring annulation of β-oxodithioesters utilizing phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), which acts both as catalyst as well as dehydrating agent.
 Scheme 45  Synthesis of thiochromones. 
M. S. Singh and co-workers have developed a protocol for the synthesis of 4H-benzo[f]chromenes 104via a four component reaction of β-oxodithioester 1, aromatic aldehyde, β-naphthol 103 and primary alcohols in the presence of catalyst InCl3 (Scheme 46).33 This transformation presumably proceeds via a domino Knoevenagel condensation/Michael addition/intramolecular cyclodehydration/transesterification sequence creating four new bonds and one stereocenter in a single operation. Interestingly, alcohol plays a dual role as a reactant as well as the reaction medium.
 Scheme 46  Synthesis of benzochromenes. 
An efficient highly convergent route towards the synthesis of 2,3-substituted and annulated benzo[a]quinolizine-4-thiones 106/107 was developed by Junjappa et al. The methodology involves ring annulation of 3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxy-1-methylisoquinoline 105 with a variety of readily accessible acyclic and cyclic β-oxodithioesters in the presence of triethylamine in refluxing benzene (Scheme 47).34
 Scheme 47  Synthesis of quinolizine-4-thiones. 
Quinolizine-4-thiones 106/107 can be readily transformed into the quinolizine-4-ones 109 after alkylation with the methyl iodide followed by hydrolysis with the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature (Scheme 48).34
 Scheme 48  Synthesis of quinolizine-4-ones. 
When pyridinium salt of dithioesters 27 were treated with substituted benzylbromides the corresponding α-oxoketene-S,S-acetals 110 were formed in good yield which then underwent intramolecular cyclization followed by oxidation in the presence of DBU and DDQ that provided indolizine 111 in moderate yield (Scheme 49).35
 Scheme 49  Synthesis of substituted indolizines. 
The mechanism proposed for the formation of indolizines is described in Scheme 50. At first DBU abstracts the proton from the carbon atom attached to the sulfur atom of A followed by nucleophilic attack on the carbon atom attached with the nitrogen of the pyridine ring and the reaction provided dihydropyridothiazine B which underwent oxidation in the presence of DDQ and provided pyridothiazine C. The disrotatary cyclisation of the pyridothiazine C followed by desulfurization leads to the indazoline ring 111.
 Scheme 50  Mechanism for the synthesis of indolizine. 
When the pyridinium salt of dithioester 112 was treated with methyl/ethyl iodide, it provided the corresponding dithioacetal 113. Use of DBU/CHCl3 and addition of chloranil provided a new molecule indolizinone 114 (Scheme 51).36
 Scheme 51  Synthesis of indolizinones. 
Formation of side-products 115 and 116 (Scheme 52) suggested the participation of water molecules in the reaction. Influence of solvents, bases and additives were further investigated. It was revealed that the best yields were obtained when trifluoroacetic acid was used as an additive.36 A probable mechanism was proposed for these transformations, Scheme 53.

Kakehi and co-workers have synthesized bis(indolizin-1-yl) disulfide 119 from 1-(benzoylthio) indolizines 118 which were formed from a pyridinium salt of β-oxodithioester 27. Treatment of 118 with piperidine in refluxing ethanol provided (indolizin-1-yl) disulfide 119 (Scheme 54).37
 Scheme 54  Synthesis of (indolizin-1-yl) disulfides. 


5. 2. 2. With more than one heteroatom. 
Beer and co-workers have synthesized bi-cyclic fused 2-methylthio-6a-thiathiophthens 122 which were formed via the condensation of β-oxodithioester 1 and 3-methylthio-1,2-dithiolium salts 121 in the presence of acetic acid containing trace amount of pyridine as shown in Scheme 55. 3-Methylthio-1,2-dithiolium salts 121 can be synthesized by the treatment of β-oxodithiocarboxylic acid 120 with phosphorous pentasulfide followed by the reaction with methyl iodide. In this reaction the dithiolium salt actually degraded in situ to provide the dithioester that further reacts with the dithiolium salt to afford the thiathiophthens 122 (Scheme 55).1a
 Scheme 55  Synthesis of 2-methylthio-6a-thiathiophthens. 
In 1975, Tominaga et al. synthesized a new fused tricyclic indole system 124 from β-oxodithioester 123 obtained from N-acetyl indoline-3-one. When β-oxodithioester 123 was treated with phosphorous pentasulfide in refluxing xylene it furnished the fused tricyclic [1,2]dithiolo[4,3-b]indole-3-(4H)-thione 124 (Scheme 56).38
 Scheme 56  Synthesis of [1,2]dithiolo[4,3-b]indole-3-(4H)-thione. 
Tominaga and co-workers in another report utilized β-oxodithioester obtained from heterocyclic active methylene compound benzothiophene-3-one 125 in the synthesis of various kind of sulfur containing fused and spiro heterocyclic systems (Scheme 57).39 The compound 126 after treatment with acetic anhydride leads to the formation of a desaurin type of compound 2,4-bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydrobenzothiophen-2-ylidene)-1,3-dithiaacetane 127. The β-oxodithioester can further be treated with phosphorous pentasulfide (P2S5) for the formation of 1,2-dithiolo[4,3-b]benzothiophen-3-thione 128 in good yield. These trithione derivatives are well known for their reactivity towards the dipolarophilic reagent to the synthesis of 1,3-dipole adducts. So, when dithiolo[4,3-b]benzothiophen-3-thione 128 was treated with the same equiv. of dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), the corresponding 1,3-dipole adduct 129 was obtained. But with excess amounts of DMAD, compound 130 was obtained as the major product.
 Scheme 57  Synthesis of various sulfur heterocycles. 
After successful application of β-oxodithioesters in the Biginelli reaction (Scheme 41), M. S. Singh and co-workers further expanded the scope of this methodology through the synthesis of highly functionalized dihydropyridopyrimidinones 132 using a Hantzsch-type reaction (Scheme 58) and was discussed in the same literature mentioned earlier. The one-pot reaction of β-oxodithioester 1, aldehyde and 6-amino-1,3-dimethyluracil 131 in refluxing ethanol in the presence of silica supported sulfuric acid resulted in dihydropyridopyrimidinones 132 in 55–66% yields.31b
 Scheme 58  Synthesis of pyridopyrimidones. 
A green and highly efficient method for the regioselective synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives 134 has been developed by annulation of heterocyclic ketene aminals (HKAs) and β-oxodithioesters (ODEs) as building blocks with aldehydes under solvent-free conditions using Et3N as the catalyst (Scheme 59).40 The present green synthesis shows fascinating properties such as high regioselectivity, concise one-pot methodology, short reaction times, easy purification and avoids the use of transition metals. This methodology provides an alternative approach for easy access to highly substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines in good yields.

Substituted pyrazoles are important synthetic targets for both the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry due to their rich chemistry and applications. Substituted pyrazoles constitute the core structure of several drugs such as Celebrax, Viagra and fipronil, as well as numerous developmental compounds that exhibit anti-hyperglycemic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, sedative, and hypnotic properties. Though a very common method for the synthesis of pyrazole is the condensation between β-ketoester and substituted hydrazine, it is difficult to get a thio-substitution in the ring via this technique.41a–c A tricyclic thienothiopyran containing fused pyrazole ring has been synthesized by De et al. (Scheme 60).41d Bicyclic active methylene compound thienothiopyranone 135/136 react with dimethyl trithiocarbonate in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide to afford the corresponding β-oxodithioesters 137/138. These dithioesters were further subjected to react with hydrazine hydrate in refluxing ethanol to afford the fused tricyclic rings 139/140 that contains thiophene, thiopyran and pyrazole. Spectroscopic data showed that these compounds existed as enethiol tautomers.
 Scheme 60  Synthesis of fused pyrazoles. 
Akikazu Kakehi and co-workers have employed first time the α-substituted pyridinium salt of β-oxodithioester 27 in the synthesis of fused dihydropyridothiazines 141/142 (Scheme 61).42 Initially, the S-alkylation of 27 with various bromo-substituted compounds in the presence of DBU/CHCl3 provided the dithioacetal intermediate 113 which underwent intramolecular cyclization to afford the cis and trans isomer of dihydropyridothiazines 141/142. The selectivity of cis- and trans-isomer depends upon the substituents presents on the molecule.
 Scheme 61  Synthesis of dihydropyridothiazines. 
In another approach Kakehi and co-workers have synthesized thiophenes that bear pyridine as one of the substituents (Scheme 62).43 The precursor 112 after treatment with DBU in refluxing ethanol underwent intramolecular cyclization to provide the thiophene ring 143, further S-alkylation with bromoacetonitrile/methyl or ethyl bromoacetate/phenacyl bromide/benzoyl or substituted benzoyl bromide afforded 144. Treatment of 144 with DBU in CHCl3 at 0 °C provided the trans-dihydrothieno[3,2-e][1,4]thiazines 146 in considerable yield.
 Scheme 62  Synthesis of dihydrothieno[3,2-e][1,4]thiazines. 
Interestingly when the dihydrothieno[3,2-e][1,4]thiazines 147 were further treated with DDQ at 0 °C, there is contraction of the ring and formation of the thieno[2,3-b]indolizine 148 as dark red crystals (Scheme 63).
 Scheme 63  Synthesis of thieno[2,3-b]indolizines. 
In Scheme 49 we have already discussed the use of the pyridinium salt of dithioester 27 towards the synthesis of substituted indolizine 111. The same group reported the formation of a series of fused tricyclic thienoindolizines 151 in low yield along with expected product 150 when R = phenyl or methyl (Scheme 64).35a
 Scheme 64  Synthesis of tricyclic thienoindolizines. 
If R1 = CN, and R is an active methylene group then the substituted indolizine compound 150 when treated with DBU in refluxing ethanol further undergoes intramolecular cyclization that leads to the indazolizine derivatives fused with a thiophene ring 152/153 (Scheme 65).35b
 Scheme 65  Synthesis of thienoindolizine. 
When indolizine 150 with –R as an active methylene group was treated with DBU no product was obtained. But when the reaction was subjected to Dieckmann conditions i.e., treated with potassium t-butoxide in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature followed by quenching the reaction mixture with the dilute HCl provided diethyl 3-hydroxythieno[2,3-b]indolizine in very good yield (Scheme 66).35b It was observed that depending on the substitutions present on the pyridine ring the diversely substituted thieno[2,3-b]indolizine rings 154/155/156 or 157 were formed.
 Scheme 66  Synthesis of thieno[2,3-b]indolizines. 
Treatment of the pyridinium salt of substituted β-oxodithioester 112 with alkyl bromoacetate leads to the dithioacetal 158 which undergoes intramolecular cyclization in presence of DBU in chloroform followed by addition of chloranil and provided a cis- and trans-mixture of thiazinoindolizine 159/160 (Scheme 67).36
 Scheme 67  Synthesis of thiazinoindolizines. 
Condensation of the α-substituted pyridinium salt of dithioesters 27 with o-phenylenediamines 161 provided N-(benzimidazolylmethyl) azinium salts in good yield (Scheme 68).44

Reactions of pyridinium 2-alkylthio-1-benzoyl-2-thioxoethylides with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxyate in THF at reflux afforded the unexpected products, dimethyl-2-alkylthio-4a-phenyl-4aH,5aH-thieno[3′,4′:4,5]oxazolo[1,3-b][1,3]oxazepine-3,4-dicarboxylates 163, together with dimethyl-10aH-4-alkylthio-5-benzoylpyrido[1,2-d][1,4]thiazepine-1,2-dicarboxylates 164 (Scheme 69).45

6. Summary and outlook
In this review, we presented the power and diversity of domino/cascade reactions based on the use of β-oxodithioesters as key substrates, which have quickly become powerful, fascinating, and highly efficient intermediates in organic synthesis. The concept of domino sequences has allowed easily reaching high molecular complexity with very often excellent levels of selectivity with simple operational procedures, as well as advantages of savings in solvent, time, energy, and costs. These domino reactions proceed under relatively mild reaction conditions and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups, thus avoiding protection group chemistry. The resulting functionalized heterocycles can undergo a variety of very useful subsequent transformations to give highly substituted heterocycles. The cases cited in this review have been selected to highlight the most promising applications of β-oxodithioesters in organic synthesis. It can be seen that many well-established different methodologies were successfully applied to β-oxodithioesters by worldwide laboratories to more environmentally benign approaches. In fact, many efforts and developments have transformed heterocyclic chemistry into a very broad and exciting field with many opportunities for research and development of applications. Definitely, much more remains to be done in this field, and in the next few years, we will see many new, exciting findings in β-oxodithioester chemistry. Thus, we hope with this review to have provided appropriate background for such developments and the encouragement to synthetic organic chemists to employ this valuable intermediate in important new heterocyclic and medicinal chemistry. On the other hand, some new synthetic approaches were developed for the specific aim of achieving a more sustainable transformation. Currently, it is expected that more developments will emerge not only in line with the previous ones reported but also in the following more fascinating specific areas: (i) asymmetric and non-asymmetric bio- and organocatalysis, (ii) efficient organometallic catalysis with minimal contamination of toxic metals, (iii) more efficient or new one-pot multicomponent couplings, and (iv) application of other efficient technologies such as microreactors and membrane separation processes.
