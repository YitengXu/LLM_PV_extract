    , Accepted 8th February 2016First published on 12th February 2016AbstractA single phase CuSbSe2 polycrystalline chalcostibite compound has been facilely synthesized through mechanical alloying for the first time, and the phase evolution has been revealed in detail. The large Seebeck coefficient and poor electrical conductivity of this compound are ascribed to the existing Cu–Se ionic bonding and heavy band at the VBM. The active lone-pair s2 electrons in Sb3+ ions are likely to be responsible for the experimentally observed low thermal conductivity in the CuSbSe2 compound. By introducing narrow band-gap Cu3SbSe4 into the CuSbSe2 matrix, the carrier concentration and mobility can be tuned effectively; thus the power factor has been improved remarkably. As a consequence, the figure of merit (ZT) is increased by a factor of 1.6 at 623 K, from 0.25 (matrix) to 0.41.
1 Introduction
Increasing global energy demands and declining fossil fuel reserves promote the rapid and urgent research for alternative energy technologies.1,2 Thermoelectric (TE) materials, which can directly convert waste heat into electrical energy, have attracted more and more attention in recent years. The efficiency of a thermoelectric device is determined by the figure of merit ZT = S2σT/κ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and κ is the total thermal conductivity which comprises the lattice contribution κl and the electronic contribution κel. Due to the interrelation among the S, σ, and κel, reducing the lattice thermal conductivity κl, which is closely related to the crystal structure and microstructure of the material, has been proved to be an effective route to improve the ZT value.3 Therefore, some compounds with intrinsically low thermal conductivity, such as In4Se3,4 BiCuSeO5 and SnSe,6 have been extensively studied and have achieved encouraging progress in recent years.
The chalcostibite CuSbSe2 compound, which belongs to the orthorhombic system with Pnma space groups, has a 2-D double-layered structure with six-membered heterorings of Sb2CuSe3 and SbCu2Se3, where the Cu atom has a distorted tetrahedral coordination with four Se atoms and the Sb atom is coordinated to three Se atoms to form a SbSe3 trigonal pyramidal geometry,7 as shown in Fig. 1. It has a bandgap of 1.05 eV and shows potential applications in infrared detectors, photovoltaic devices and solar cells.8,9 Moreover, it also has an intrinsically very low thermal conductivity, and seems to be a potential thermoelectric material for middle temperature applications. However, no attention has been paid to its medium temperature thermoelectric performance yet.10,11 In fact, compared with several popular thermoelectric materials in a medium temperature range, such as PbTe,12 filled skutterudites13 and In4Se3,14 CuSbSe2 has no expensive constituent elements, and it will be more competitive if its TE performance is comparable to those of conventional materials. Currently, due to its poor electrical properties, the TE performance of CuSbSe2 is still very poor; in addition, it is mainly fabricated by vacuum melting, which requires high temperature and prolonged annealing (usually one week).10,11 The time and energy-consuming process is also a concern to be solved.

In this work, mechanical alloying (MA), which has been used to prepare many intermetallics including several thermoelectric compounds, such as Bi2Te3,15 CoSb3 (ref. 16) and In4Se3,17 has been employed to synthesize this compound, and a single phase CuSbSe2 compound has been successfully prepared by MA in a short duration for the first time. Considering its wide bandgap and poor electrical properties, Cu3SbSe4 with a narrow band-gap of 0.29 eV was introduced into the CuSbSe2 matrix to improve its electrical properties.18 As a result, a significant enhancement in the thermoelectric power factor (S2σ) has been achieved, and a maximum ZT of 0.41 at 623 K has been obtained, which increases by a factor of 1.6 compared to that of pure CuSbSe2 at the same temperature.
2 Experimental
With the molar ratio of CuSbSe2/Cu3SbSe4 as 20:1, 9:1 and 8:2, elemental powders of Cu (99.9%), Sb (99.99%) and Se (99.99%) were weighed and mixed, and then subjected to MA in a planetary ball mill. The mechanical alloying process was performed at a speed of 400 rpm in a purified argon atmosphere by using stainless vials and balls, and the ball to powder weight ratio was about 20:1. To study the phase evolution during the MA process, some powders were extracted for characterization from the vial at a certain interval. The mechanically alloyed powders were consolidated by hot-pressing at 673 K for 1 h under a pressure of 120 MPa in a purified argon atmosphere.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed with a PANalytical X'pert PRO X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed on a Perkin Elmer Diamond DSC. The microstructure and composition of the samples were characterized by using a Nova NanoSEM 450 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with an Oxford detector for energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was carried out on a JEM-2100 microscope operating with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity were measured on the commercial equipment (Namicro-III, Wuhan Schwab Instruments, China) from room temperature to 623 K. The thermal conductivity (κ) was derived from the product of the material density ρ determined by the Archimedes' method, the thermal diffusivity (D) measured by a laser flash method (LFA 427, Netzsch Instruments, Germany) and the specific heat Cp determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Room Hall measurements were carried out on a HMS 5500 Hall effect measurement system (Ecopia, South Korea) with a constant magnetic field of 0.5 T.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA)19 and projector augmented wave (PAW)20 pseudopotentials were implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).21,22 In calculations, a plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 eV and a K point mesh of 8 × 12 × 4 as well as an energy conversion threshold of 1.0 × 10−6 eV per atom were used.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of the powder mixture with nominal composition CuSbSe2 after MA for different time periods. After milling for 2 h, CuSe2 (PDF#00-018-0453), CuSe (PDF#00-049-1456), and elemental Sb (PDF#01-071-1173) have been detected. With the milling time increased to 4 h, the ternary compound Cu3SbSe4 (ICSD#98-062-9000) is formed. With further prolonging the milling time to 6 h, the aimed ternary compound CuSbSe2 (ICSD#98-041-8754) appears along with the gradual disappearance of the “transition phase” Cu3SbSe4. When the milling time is further prolonged to 8 h, no obvious change in the XRD pattern can be found. Based on these XRD patterns, we can roughly conclude that the formation of the ternary chalcostibite compound CuSbSe2 is as follows: in the incipient stage of MA, the reaction between Cu and Se results in the formation of binary compounds (CuSe and Cu2Se); with increasing the milling time, the refined Sb powders are gradually involved in the reaction with Cu and Se to form the ternary chalcostibite compound Cu3SbSe4 (Cu1.5Sb0.5Se2) and ultimately CuSbSe2 after a complete consumption of the Sb component. During the MA process, Cu3SbSe4 forms in the middle process and then evolves into the targeted CuSbSe2 compound as a “transition phase”. A similar process was also reported in some other ternary semiconductors.23 DSC curves, corresponding to the powders milled for 6 h and 8 h, were also measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. It reveals that there is only one endothermic peak at 749 K corresponding to the melting of CuSbSe2 in the DSC curve of the sample mechanically alloyed for 8 h,24,25 confirming the single phase constitution of the product, which is also in good agreement with the corresponding XRD pattern in Fig. 2a. For the 6 h sample, besides the melting peak of CuSbSe2, there is another small endothermic peak at 718 K (blue circle), which accords well with the melting peak of Cu3SbSe4,25,26 indicating the presence of a tiny amount of Cu3SbSe4 in the 6 h sample, although no obvious peak of Cu3SbSe4 can be detected in the XRD pattern. This demonstrates that the single phase CuSbSe2 compound can be directly synthesized simply by mechanical alloying without further prolonged annealing, which is usually necessary for the vacuum melting method (1 week at 1083 K).11 Moreover, compared with the CuSbSe2 compound, Cu3SbSe4 has a narrower bandgap and lower electrical resistivity; therefore the composite of CuSbSe2 and Cu3SbSe4 with an appropriate ratio may have better thermoelectric performance than the single CuSbSe2 compound, taking into account the possible enhancement of electrical properties and the extra phonon scattering by Cu3SbSe4.
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns of the powders with the nominal composition of CuSbSe2 milled for different time periods; (b) DSC curves of the nominal CuSbSe2 powders milled for 6 h and 8 h, respectively. 
Based on this consideration, three more compositions, with the nominal molar ratio of CuSbSe2/Cu3SbSe4 as 20:1, 9:1 and 8:2, denoted as 20-1, 9-1 and 8-2, respectively, were also mechanically alloyed for 8 h to get products with different ratios of CuSbSe2 to Cu3SbSe4, and then consolidated by hot pressing to study and compare their thermoelectric performance.
X-ray diffraction patterns of the hot pressed bulk samples with different nominal compositions are plotted in Fig. 3a. To check the actual ratio of CuSbSe2 to Cu3SbSe4, Rietveld refinement was carried out and the result of the nominal CuSbSe2 MA 8 h sample (CSS2) is shown in Fig. 3b, and that of the others can be found in the ESI (Fig. S1†). For the CSS2 sample, all peaks can be indexed to CuSbSe2 with the ICSD#98-041-8754 file, and the good fit between the observed (red dot) and calculated data (black line) in Fig. 3b further confirms the single phase nature of the sample according to the typical R values (Rp = 14.40%, Rwp = 11.30%, Rexp = 9.37%) and goodness-of-fit (χ2 = 1.46). As for the other three samples, narrow band-gap semiconductor Cu3SbSe4 has appeared and its peak intensity increases obviously with increasing the nominal content of Cu3SbSe4. The actual molar percentage of Cu3SbSe4 and CuSbSe2 of the samples is summarized in Table 1 according to the Rietveld refinement results.

Fig. 4 shows the FESEM fractographs of different samples. It can be seen that the single-phase CuSbSe2 sample (Fig. 4a) has a grain size of about 300 nm, and the stoichiometric proportion from the EDS result is also in good accordance with chalcostibite CuSbSe2 for the CSS2 sample. It is noteworthy that there are dispersive nanoparticles about tens of nanometer in size, distributed in the matrix in Fig. 3b–d. Besides the nanoparticles, there are also some nanopores distributed in the matrix, which may result from the peeling off of the nanoparticles. Conceivably, these nanoparticles and nanopores will introduce extra phonon scattering thus reducing the lattice thermal conductivity of the system consequently.

TEM observation was performed to study the microstructure of the Cu3SbSe4 containing samples, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. As confirmed by the HRTEM lattice image in Fig. 5b, the angular grain in spot 1 (Fig. 5a) corresponds to Cu3SbSe4, which is in contact with the CuSbSe2 grains, and it is about 200 nm in size, while Fig. 5c and d reveal the other way of existence for Cu3SbSe4, it disperses in the CuSbSe2 grains as nanoinclusions, and its size is about 30 nm. The size and distribution of Cu3SbSe4 are related to the mechanical alloying process. As mentioned above, Cu3SbSe4 forms during the mechanical alloying process and it will react with Sb and form CuSbSe2 gradually. In the excess designed Cu3SbSe4 systems (samples of 20-1, 9-1 and 8-2), the intermediate Cu3SbSe4 changes into CuSbSe2 partially, and if it is wrapped in CuSbSe2 particles during the reaction, it will expend itself and the CuSbSe2 particle grows up accordingly until there is not enough Sb to diffuse into, thus the remaining Cu3SbSe4 remains as nanoinclusion in the CuSbSe2 crystal. On the other hand, because of the excessive Cu3SbSe4 composition design, there are also some Cu3SbSe4 powders undergoing no further reaction, and these powders then develop into the relatively large Cu3SbSe4 grains after hot pressing.

The electrical resistivity (ρ), Seebeck coefficient (S), power factor (PF) and thermal conductivity (κ) of the sintered samples have been measured and are shown in Fig. 6a–d, respectively. With comparison to the pure CuSbSe2, the electrical resistivity of the sample with Cu3SbSe4 (Fig. 6a) is greatly reduced, changing from 2050.8 μΩ m (matrix) to 512.1 μΩ m (sample 8-2) at 623 K; meanwhile, the Seebeck coefficient (Fig. 6b) also decreases rapidly from 535 μV K−1 to 371 μV K−1 at the corresponding temperature, thus resulting in the remarkable improvement of the power factor (Fig. 6c) within the temperature range of the measurement (373–623 K). The improved electrical properties should be mainly attributed to the introduction of Cu3SbSe4. It has a smaller bandgap and higher carrier mobility than the CuSbSe2 matrix,18 can contribute more carrier concentration to the matrix and also increase the carrier mobility of the composite (see Table 1), and thus enhances the electrical conductivity, correspondingly. Similar phenomena have also been reported in other composites, such as modulation doped SiGe27 and Mn15Si26/MnSi.28 As shown in Fig. 6d, pure CuSbSe2 has a very low thermal conductivity, which is even lower than that of some high-performance thermoelectric polycrystalline materials at high temperature, such as SnSe,29 BiCuSeO,30 Cu2Se,31etc. Among the samples with a second phase, the κ of the 20-1 sample has a slight decrease compared with the matrix due to the effective phonon scattering of Cu3SbSe4 nanoparticles. On the other hand, due to the higher thermal conductivity of Cu3SbSe4 than that of CuSbSe2,18 with increasing the content of Cu3SbSe4, the fraction of Cu3SbSe4 with a large grain size also increases and the contribution of Cu3SbSe4 to the total thermal conductivity also increases; therefore, the κ of samples 9-1 and 8-2 also increases accordingly. The calculated κl (see the inset in Fig. 6d) of these samples follows the relationship as κl ∝ T−1, which suggests that the dominant scattering in phonon transport is the phonon–phonon Umklapp scattering, and it approaches the minimum lattice thermal conductivity κmin estimated by Cahill's formula at high temperature.26,32

To further investigate the unusual electrical and thermal properties of CuSbSe2, ab initio calculations have been carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The calculation indicates an indirect band-gap of 0.6 eV for CuSbSe2 which is smaller than the experimental value7 as the GGA tends to underestimate the energy gap of semiconductors. Furthermore, the compound has a very flat valence band indicating a large hole effective mass, which is also consistent with the obtained low carrier mobility of 2.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in Table 1. The density of states (DOS) shows that the Cu d states and Se p states are the dominant contributors to the valence-band maximum (VBM), whereas the conduction band edge is mainly constituted by the p states of Sb and Se (Fig. 7b). In the meantime, the effective mass (m*) is also estimated according to the following equations33–35 using the observed carrier concentration (nh) and Seebeck coefficient (S) values: (1) (2) (3)where η is the reduced Fermi energy, Fn(η) is the nth order Fermi integral, kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the electron charge, h is the Planck constant and r is the scattering factor. The scattering factor (r) is −1/2 as the acoustic phonon scattering is independent of the grain size and is generally assumed to be the main scattering mechanism at room temperature. The calculation gives an effective mass (m*) of 0.9m0, which is even higher than that of SnSe (0.75m0)29 and BiCuSeO (0.6m0)30 at room temperature; therefore the high Seebeck coefficient (see Fig. 6b) is reasonable.

The bonding nature in CuSbSe2 is also analyzed through the calculated electron localization function (ELF). The isosurface of charge shown in Fig. 7c clearly describes the lobe-like extensions around the Sb atoms, which are the classic signatures of lone-pair s2 electrons.36 As can be seen in the charge projection figure (Fig. 7d), the Sb and Se atoms are connected via covalent bonds, which is associated with p-electron hybridization in the region (0.6, 3.4) eV in the DOS. At the same time, the Cu atoms connect with neighboring Se atoms in a mainly ionic manner: the Cu atom donates an s-electron to the Se atom, reflecting s–p hybridization in the DOS in the range of (−5.8, −5.0) eV; the other adjacent Se atoms also accept three d-electrons from the Cu atom as shown in the (−4.0, 0) eV DOS region.37 The ionic bonding between Cu and Se atoms enables the Cu atoms to provide a dramatic DOS variation near the VBM as shown in Fig. 7b, which is beneficial for the large Seebeck coefficient.38 We speculate that the very low thermal conductivity in the CuSbSe2 system arises mainly due to the occurrence of the lone pair electrons of Sb and hence the distorted coordination (Fig. 1c), which make the Coulomb repulsion effects between the lone-pair and neighboring negatively charged Se ions highly pronounced, leading to the distorted coordination and high degree of anharmonicity (large average Grüneisen parameter γave = 1.21)25 and thus a very low thermal conductivity.4,12
Based on the measured electrical and thermal transport properties, the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) was calculated and is presented in Fig. 8. The ZT reflects an increasing trend with temperature, and a maximum ZT value of 0.41 was achieved at 623 K for the sample of 9-1, which is about 62% higher than that of pure CuSbSe2 (0.25) and is also higher than that of SnSe (∼0.31 at 750 K)29 and BiCuSeO (∼0.39 at 873 K),30 due to the very low thermal conductivity and large Seebeck coefficient. As depicted above, the κl of the CuSbSe2 tends to κmin with increasing the temperature; the next step to improve the ZT value should be further focused on the enhancement of electrical conductivity, such as carrier engineering by doping, and the related work is under way.

4 Conclusions
For the first time, a single phase CuSbSe2 polycrystalline chalcostibite compound has been successfully prepared by mechanical alloying in a relatively short duration, and the phase evolution has been revealed. The high Seebeck coefficient and poor electric conductivity of this compound are attributed to the Cu–Se ionic bonding and heavy band at the VBM. The active lone-pair s2 electrons in Sb3+ ions, which will produce notable repulsive interactions and then contribute as anharmonic scattering, are likely to be responsible for the experimentally observed low thermal conductivity in the CuSbSe2 compound. What's more, the carrier concentration can be roughly tuned by altering the Cu3SbSe4 content in the composite. Hence, introducing Cu3SbSe4 into the matrix during the MA process enhances the power factor substantially. A maximum ZT value of 0.41 has been obtained for the sample of 9-1, which increases by a factor of 1.6 compared to that of pure CuSbSe2 in this potential mid-temperature thermoelectric material.
