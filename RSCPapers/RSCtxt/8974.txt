    , Accepted 14th November 2022First published on 26th November 2022AbstractPhotocatalysis is an essential branch in chemical catalysis research, in which the coupling of semiconductors to promote hydrogen production is one of the hot spots of photocatalysis. In recent decades, people's research on semiconductor materials has become perfect. Many studies have shown that coupling semiconductor-like materials such as MOFs with traditional semiconductor materials can often significantly improve photocatalysis. ZIF-67 and ZIF-67-L (Leaf) were embedded in Ni5Al4O11·18H2O using an in situ growth method. Nanoflower-hexagonal sheet and nanoflower-leaf hydrogen production systems were constructed, respectively. The results show that both systems have good hydrogen production capacity. ZIF-67 has a better specific surface area and microporous structure, so the hydrogen production performance of the hexagonal sheet structure under nanoflowers is the best, reaching 1629.3 μmol g−1 h−1.
1. Introduction
The over-exploitation of conventional energy has dramatically damaged the earth's ecological environment, and the non-renewable nature of conventional energy has caused the global energy reserve to decline.1–4 In particular, in the new century, fossil fuels and natural gas resources are vulnerable to force majeure factors, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand.5 The development of clean energy has a crucial strategic position in human development.6,7 Hydrogen energy ranks at the forefront of energy research and development with its advantages of zero carbon emission and high energy density.8,9 How to produce hydrogen more efficiently and conveniently has become a research focus in catalysis.
Semiconductor coupling to construct a heterointerface to control the carrier transport path is one of the ways to achieve photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.10–13 The synthesis of some novel semiconductor materials by morphology control is necessary to construct photocatalytic systems.14,15 Ni5Al4O11·18H2O is an inorganic layered material rich in hydroxyl groups. Its unique flower-like structure provides a favorable supporting environment for the efficient immobilization of guest catalysts. The interlayer distance between each petal is large enough to contact Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and the guest closer.16–20 Based on the high stability and good electrical conductivity of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O, such materials are widely used in catalysis, separation, and energy storage. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are metal–organic framework (MOF) subclasses.21–25 The zeolite-like topology has a large specific surface area, diverse structures and morphologies, and mild preparation conditions and can be used in separation, storage, chemical sensors, and other directions.26–28 ZIF-67 is a nanocrystalline material composed of Co2+ and imidazole-based ligands through a four-coordination method. By changing the molar ratio of Co2+:2-methylimidazole and the reaction time, the synthesis of ZIF-67 with different morphologies and sizes can be controlled. ZIF-67 has semiconductor-like advantages in photocatalytic applications so that the composition of semiconductor materials extends from inorganic materials to inorganic–organic materials.29–34
The intercalation of ZIF-67 and ZIF-67-L was performed between the petals of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O to optimize the interface between the coupled semiconductors. The fluffy Ni5Al4O11·18H2O can control the dispersion of ZIFs and improve the adsorption, which is an excellent way to control the morphology. The structure of the material affects the material properties. The organic ligands of ZIFs can capture electrons in the environment and transfer them to metal nodes under conjugation. The metal nodes can act as active catalytic centers to participate in the photocatalytic reduction of hydrogen ions. Ni5Al4O11·18H2O, which provides support, is an active semiconductor and simultaneously functions as an electron donor and an electron acceptor. On the one hand, it is used to consume the holes of the ZIF, and on the other hand, it provides electrons to the metal nodes. Coupled with the photosensitizer's light energy induction and electron transfer, the whole system forms a global directional electron flow.
Morphology observation, spectral testing, and other characterizations have comprehensively analyzed the system's structure. The excellent chemical reaction properties exhibited by the composite catalysts were investigated in electrochemical experiments.35–38 The highly efficient hydrogen production results powerfully demonstrate the applicability of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O/ZIF-67 composites. In this paper, the photocatalytic materials are extended to organic–inorganic composite systems, and the reduction ability and transfer rate of electrons are improved.

Take 0.96 mmol of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (NiCl2·6H2O) and 0.32 mmol of Al(NO3)3·9H2O in a beaker, add 30 mL of deionized water and stir well to make it evenly dispersed. The solution in the beaker is called “Solution A”; Take 2.56 mmol of NH4F and 6.4 mmol of urea in another beaker, add 30 mL of deionized water and stir well to make it evenly dispersed. This solution is designated as “Solution B”. After ultrasonic treatment for 10 min, “Solution B” was added dropwise to “Solution A” and then stirred for 30 min to make it evenly dispersed. The uniformly mixed reaction solution was put into a 100 mL reaction kettle, and the reaction parameters were set to 120 °C for 24 h. Ni5Al4O11·18H2O powder can be obtained from the cooled reaction solution through the processes of washing, suction filtration, drying, and grinding.

2.4 Characterization technique
XRD analysis was performed using a Rigaku SmartlabSE system. The test target is a copper target, scanned at a rate of 10° min−1 under a working environment of 30 mA and 40 mV. The material morphology was observed with a ZEISS Sigma 500 instrument and SmartSEM software. The material was processed by transmission scanning using JEOL JEM-2100. XPS elemental analysis was performed with the ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250Xi. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller was evaluated using a Micromeritics ASAP 2460. UV-Vis DRS was tested using PerkinElmer Lambda 750S.

The FTIR-650 of GANGDONG was used to analyze the infrared transmittance and functional group types of the material. Zeta potential testing was done on a zetapotential analyzer.
2.5 Electrochemical testing
Electrochemical tests were performed using a CHI 660E three-electrode electrochemical workstation. The saturated silver chloride electrode was used as the reference electrode, a platinum sheet electrode was used as the counter electrode, and a conductive glass covered by the catalyst was used as the working electrode. The electrolyte environment in which the three electrodes are located is prepared as a 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution. The preparation process of the working electrode is as follows: the catalyst was mixed with 10% Nifon solution for sample preparation and then evenly spread on the ITO conductive glass. The effective area of the glass coating is controlled to be 1 × 1 cm2. For the evaluation of the photocurrent response, a 300 W xenon lamp with a wavelength greater than 420 nm was used as the light source.39
2.6 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments
The performance evaluation of photocatalytic hydrogen production was realized on a multi-channel photoreaction system (Beijing Perfectlight, PCX 50B Discover) and gas chromatograph (Ruili SP-2000, 13X chromatographic column). The hydrogen detection environment is N2 atmosphere, and the detection mode is TCD. A sealed 65 mL flat bottom quartz bottle was illuminated with a 5 W LED light source. The reaction system in the quartz bottle was 10 mg of catalyst, 20 mg of EY, and 30 mL of 10% TEOA solution by volume. The generated gas was sampled every hour and continuously measured five times. The standard external method converted the resulting peak areas to hydrogen production rates.40,41

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology

3.1.1. XRD. 
The polycrystalline X-ray diffraction pattern and crystallographic database card can determine the crystal structure and phase content of the substance. In this paper, the unit cell parameters of each substance were analyzed by Crystallographic Information File (CIF) and GSAS-II. Fig. 2(a) is the Bragg diffraction angle and unit cell structure model of ZIF-67, which shows that ZIF-67 matches the cage-like structure with CIF number 671073. Fig. 2(b) compares the diffraction peak data of ZIF-67 and Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and their composite catalysts. NAZ not only retains (001), (002), and other peak types of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O but also grows (011), (112), and (222) planes of ZIF-67 on the surface. Fig. 2(c) is a comparison of the XRD diffraction peaks of NAZ-X (samples with different relative loadings). Fig. 2(d) shows the Bragg diffraction angle and unit cell structure model of ZIF-67-L, which indicates that ZIF-67-L matches the layered structure of CIF number c5ce01531f2. Fig. 2(e) is a comparison of the diffraction peak data of ZIF-67-L and Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and their composite catalysts. NAZL not only retains (001), (002), and other peak types of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O but also grows (112), (420), and (443) Planes of ZIF-67-L on the surface. Fig. 2(f) is a comparison of the XRD diffraction peaks of NAZL-X (samples with different relative loadings). Comprehensive XRD data analysis shows that both NAZ and NAZL prepared by in situ growth of ZIF-67 and ZIF-67-L on Ni5Al4O11·18H2O retain their good crystallinity, which marks the successful coupling of the composites.

3.1.2. SEM. 
Using SEM images, the morphology of each substance can be analyzed intuitively. Fig. 3(a) and (d) are Ni5Al4O11·18H2O hydrothermally synthesized using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and NiCl2·6H2O as Ni sources, both of which are spherical nanoflower structures of the same size. Fig. 3(b) shows the hexagonal nanosheet-like morphology of ZIF-67 with diameters ranging from 500 nm to 1 μm. Fig. 3(e) shows the leaf thin-layer structure of ZIF-67-L, with a leaf length of about 5 μm and a leaf width of 2 μm. Fig. 3(c) and (f) are the morphologies of the composite catalysts formed by ZIF-67 and ZIF-67-L grown on Ni5Al4O11·18H2O. The smaller volume of ZIF-67 is very uniformly supported on Ni5Al4O11·18H2O, maintaining the spherical structure. The leaf-shaped ZIF-67-L is relatively bulky and has a strong shielding effect on Ni5Al4O11·18H2O.

3.1.3. TEM. 
In Fig. 4(a), it can be observed that the thin-layer platelets of ZIF-67 are uniformly intercalated into the Ni5Al4O11·18H2O nanoflowers in the transmission image of NAZ-125. The element map also reflects the formation of the perfect composite structure of the two materials from another angle. Fig. 4(c) is a high-power transmission image of the material. The (100) plane of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O is observed in region (d), and the lattice fringe width is 0.26 nm. The (261) crystal plane of ZIF-67 is observed in area (e), with a lattice fringe width of 0.14 nm. The three elements Ni, Al, and O, constitute the nanoflower structure in the selective element mapping. In contrast, C and N elements are mainly distributed in the interlayer flake structure of the nanoflower. Based on Fig. 4, Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and ZIF-67 achieved the effect of close contact and constant intercalation.

3.2. Elemental analysis
Surface XPS analysis was carried out on the catalyst to obtain the material's element species and transfer situation. Fig. 5(a) is the XPS element total spectrum of ZIF-67, ZIF-67-L, Ni5Al4O11·18H2O, NAZ, NAZL, which can correspond to the peak positions and integrated intensities of different elements of different materials. The source of the Ni 2p orbitals of NAZ and NAZL in Fig. 5(b) is Ni5Al4O11·18H2O, and two orbital splitting peaks and two satellite peaks appear. The source of the Al 2p orbitals of NAZ and NAZL in Fig. 5(c) is also Ni5Al4O11·18H2O. This element has three orbital splitting peaks, 2p3/2, 2p1/2, and 2p. Fig. 5(d) is the elemental spectrum analysis of O 1s, and the position of the peak changes little. The source of N 1s orbitals for NAZ and NAZL in Fig. 5(e) is the ZIF material. Besides the general N 1s peak type, π–π* conjugated peaks of surface oxynitrides and N–N bonds also appeared. The peak of Co 2p in Fig. 5(f) contains two split peaks of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 and the corresponding satellite peaks. By comparing the element-binding energy shift of the composite material and the monomer material, the data show that the binding energy of Ni and Al of the composite catalyst is positively shifted, and the π–π* conjugation of N is enhanced. Therefore, there is electron transfer between Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and NAZ, Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and NAZL, and the direction of electron transfer is Ni5Al4O11·18H2O to ZIF material.

3.3. Surface area analysis
Under the condition that the adsorbate is nitrogen and the test temperature is 77.5 K, we carry out the specific surface area test and pore size analysis of the samples. After comparing the adsorption–desorption curves of several samples, the adsorption types and pore size distributions of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and two ZIFs can be obtained. In Fig. 6(a), ZIF-67 is a type I adsorption isotherm with a large specific surface area and high porosity. This corresponds to the cage-like structure characteristic of MOF materials. In Fig. 6(d), ZIF-67-L is a type IV isotherm with no hysteresis loop. Compared with nano-sized ZIF-67, the specific surface area of leaf-shaped ZIF-67-L is not ideal. This is because the microstructure of the leaf-like ZIF-67-L is lamellar and does not fully grow into a microporous MOF material. Ni5Al4O11·18H2O is a type IV isotherm and a type H3 hysteresis ring, indicating that the material is a slit-type macroporous structure. The narrow pore type macropore structure is manifested in the stacking of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O nanosheets into micron flowers. Table 1 shows more clearly the specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size of the material. Because the pore structure of NAZ-125 is more conducive to introducing photosensitizer molecules than NAZL-100, it is more favorable for the photosensitizer molecules to contact the active site directly. Therefore, NAZ-125 can shorten the electron transport distance and improve the carrier migration efficiency.44–46

3.4. Steady-state and transient fluorescence
The radiative recombination process of electron–hole pairs was characterized by fluorescence test analysis. In Fig. 7(a), the PL peak intensity of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O is relatively high, indicating that the excited electrons of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O easily recombine with holes under visible light irradiation. When ZIF-67 is applied to the composite, the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs decreases slightly. Fig. 7(b) shows the time-resolved fluorescence spectrum. There is little difference between the fluorescence lifetime of monomer material and composite material. These results indicate that the recombination of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and ZIF-67 does not reduce the lifetime of photo-generated carriers. Fig. 7(c) shows the comparison of the peak intensities of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and ZIF-67-L in photo-generated power generation. The effect of ZIF-67-L is consistent with that of ZIF-67. Fig. 7(d) shows the time-resolved fluorescence spectra of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and ZIF-67-L. The lifetime of NAZL is also not reduced.

3.5. Infrared analysis

Fig. 8(a) is a schematic diagram of the atomic structure of ZIF-67. The N and Co atoms in each 2-methylimidazole ring are connected to construct cage-like Co-MOF molecules. Fig. 8(b) is the infrared transmission spectrum of NAZ and its monomer materials. The broad peaks from 3600 cm−1 to 3200 cm−1 are the hydrogen bonding effect of crystal water and the peak of KBr adsorbing water in the air. The stretching vibration of CO2 at 2390 cm−1. 1577 cm−1 is the CC stretching vibration in the carbon–nitrogen ring. 1456 cm−1 and 1421 cm−1 are the asymmetric and symmetric bending vibrations of CH3. 1305 cm−1 is the C–H in-plane bending vibration. 1142 cm−1 is the C–N stretching vibration. 993 cm−1 is the CH3 rocking vibration. 755 cm−1 is the out-of-plane bending vibration of C–H. 685 cm−1 is the stretching vibration of Co–N. The remaining peaks are mainly the stretching vibrations between metal and oxygen atoms in Ni5Al4O11·18H2O. Fig. 8(d) is a schematic diagram of the atomic structure of ZIF-67-L. The pattern of the peaks in the infrared transmission spectra of NAZL and its monomer material in Fig. 8(e) is similar to that in Fig. 8(b) in the same position and type. Fig. 8(c) and (f) are the infrared absorption spectra of NAZ and NAZL, and the data analysis results are consistent with the transmission spectra.

3.6. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance analysis
UV-Vis diffuse reflectance analysis can characterize the absorption intensity of materials for different wavelengths of light. In Fig. 9(a) and (d), the absorption intensity of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O is generally not high in the wavelength range of 250–800 nm, and the peak height is lower in the visible light spectrum. However, ZIF-67 and ZIF-67-L exhibited strong absorption ability under ultraviolet light and were very sensitive to visible light, which was beneficial to the excitation of photogenerated electrons. When ZIF-67 and ZIF-67-L were grown on NAZ and NAZL, the composites not only retained the strong light absorption ability of ZIF materials, but also made the electron–hole pairs easier to separate. Fig. 9(b) and (e) are the band gaps of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O prepared with Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and NiCl2·6H2O as Ni sources, respectively, about 2.35 eV. Fig. 9(c) is the Kubelka–Munk transform spectra of ZIF-67, and the calculated bandgap is 3.50 eV. Fig. 9(f) is the Kubelka–Munk transform spectra of ZIF-67-L, and the calculated bandgap value is also 3.50 eV.

3.7. Electrochemical analysis
To evaluate the degree of physical self-assembly adhesion and the sensitivity of chemical photoelectric reaction between ZIF-67, ZIF-67-L, and Ni5Al4O11·18H2O, we carried out zeta potential measurements and the Tafel curve test (Fig. 10). In the pH environment with deionized water as the solvent, the Ni5Al4O11·18H2O solution has a positive zeta potential, while the zeta potentials of ZIF-67 and ZIF-67-L are overall neutral. This result indicates that when ZIF-67 and ZIF-67-L grow on the surface of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O, they do not suffer from sizeable electrostatic repulsion force composites are tightly combined. In the Tafel plot, both NAZ and NAZL have smaller exchange current densities (η = a + blgI) than the single material. This result indicates that the redox ability of the system can be excited when a tiny amount of energy is imparted to the composite. The coupling of the composite material lowers the barrier to photoelectric conversion.

In the Nyquist diagram and circuit simulation diagram of Fig. 11(a), ZIF-67 and ZIF-67-L have the smallest radius of curvature. The smaller radius of curvature indicates that the internal structure of the material is favorable for the transfer of electrons, and NAZ-125 retains the excellent electrical conductivity of the ZIF material. NAZ-125 exhibits a highly high photocurrent response in the I–T curve of Fig. 11(b), which is favorable for the generation and migration of photogenerated electrons. It can be seen from the linear sweep voltammetry curve in Fig. 11(c) that although ZIF materials have excellent light transfer and responsiveness, their hydrogen evolution activity is low. Therefore, NAZ-125, after introducing the Ni5Al4O11·18H2O material, will significantly improve the hydrogen evolution activity of the catalyst. That is to say, NAZ and NAZL materials retain the low resistance and high photoelectric response of ZIF and, at the same time, have the high hydrogen evolution activity of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O. Fig. 11(d)–(f) shows the flat-band potentials of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and two ZIFs in a sequence. After conversion using a standard hydrogen electrode, it can be known that the conduction band value of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O is 0.1 V, that of ZIF-67 is −0.7 V, and that of ZIF-67-L is −1 V.

Cyclic voltammetry curves were tested on several materials at different scan rates.47–49 As shown in Fig. 12, by comparing the integral area and symmetry of the rings, NAZ-125 has good charge–discharge reversibility. The organic ligands and metal cluster nodes are complex, which dramatically improves the material's electricity storage and discharge capacity. The large specific capacitance benefits from the zeolite-like topology of the metal–organic framework compounds, which favors electron transport.

3.8. Hydrogen production performance
According to much data in Fig. 13, we can evaluate the hydrogen production performance of this system. Both NAZ-125 and NAZL-100 showed excellent hydrogen production effects at pH = 10 and EY 24 mg. For pH, too high will cause insufficient thermodynamic driving force for hydrogen release, and too low will reduce the EY adsorption capacity. For EY, too much will reduce catalyst adsorption efficiency, cause light scattering and hinder light transmission and absorption. Too little is not enough to induce electron transfer behavior between composite catalysts. In addition, NAZ-125 exhibited more favorable hydrogen production activity than NAZL-100 under the same reaction conditions. On the one hand, this result is that the bandgap structure of ZIF-67 is more suitable for coupling electron transfer between semiconductors than ZIF-67-L. On the other hand, the morphology of ZIF-67 is smaller, and the specific surface area is more significant than that of ZIF-67-L. This allows ZIF-67 to intercalate into Ni5Al4O11·18H2O nanoflowers in a better composite manner. In addition to the influence of energy band structure and specific surface area on the hydrogen evolution performance of the two photocatalysts, pore size distribution, microstructure and photo-electrochemical performance are also the reasons for the difference in hydrogen evolution performance. In several characterization experiments, ZIF-67 showed better physicochemical properties than ZIF-67-L, which was the reason for the higher hydrogen evolution rate of the Ni5Al4O11·18H2O/ZIF-67 composite catalyst.

NAZ-125 and NAZL-100 have high responsiveness in the visible light range, so both have the best apparent quantum efficiency measured at 520 nm. As shown in Fig. 14(b) and (e), TEOA as a sacrificial agent is more suitable for NAZ and NAZL to produce hydrogen. Although the hydrogen production activity of NAZL-100 is not as good as that of NAZ-125, the cycling stability of NAZL-100 is significantly better than that of NAZ-125. In Fig. 14(f), we also find the disadvantage of the ZIF material. As a branch of MOFs, ZIF is not as stable as conventional semiconductors, so the composite NAZ will mainly retain the diffraction peak characteristics of Ni5Al4O11·18H2O after hydrogen production.

3.9. Photocatalytic mechanism
The photocatalytic mechanism is shown in Fig. 15. Ni5Al4O11·18H2O is a flower-like structure, which can improve the dispersion of ZIF-67. A heterostructure inside NAZ might be formed between Ni5Al4O11·18H2O and ZIF-67. Under light irradiation, EY was excited from the ground state to the excited state. The excited EY capture one electron from TEOA and then transfer the electron to NAZ. The obtained electrons in NAZ from EY would reduce H+ to H2.

4. Conclusions
We constructed two composite systems by intercalating ZIF-67 and ZIF-67-L into Ni5Al4O11·18H2O nanoflowers, respectively, by in situ growth. Between them, Ni5Al4O11·18H2O, as a conventional active semiconductor, can provide energy level-mediated electron transfer between substances and act as an electron donor and an electron acceptor simultaneously. The ZIF material has semiconductor-like properties, and the coupling of the two materials improves the dispersion and adsorption capacity of the composite photocatalyst. In the intercalated structure of ZIF-67 to Ni5Al4O11·18H2O, the large specific surface area and close contact endow the system with efficient hydrogen production activity. Under suitable conditions, the maximum hydrogen production rate of the material increased to 1629.3 μmol·g−1 h−1. The spectral analysis results of fluorescence, ultraviolet-visible light, and infrared show that the composite material has an excellent matching degree for photocatalytic applications. Such semiconductor coupling structures will provide some ideas for the progress of photocatalysis research.
