, Accepted 14th November 2013First published on 14th November 2013AbstractEnhanced green and red upconversion emissions are observed in Er/Yb:LiNbO3 codoped with 3 mol% In3+ ions under both 1550 nm and 980 nm excitation, which provides more probabilities to increase efficiently the solar spectrum response and further increase the photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells. The energy transfer (ET: 2F7/2 Yb + 4I11/2 Er → 2F5/2 Yb + 4I15/2 Er) and the energy back transfer (EBT: 2F5/2 Yb + 4I13/2 Er → 2F7/2 Yb + 4F9/2 Er) processes are also responsible for the population of the red emitting 4F9/2 state (Er) under 1550 nm excitation. The increased red emission is attributed to the dissociation of Er3+ cluster sites in the In/Er/Yb:LiNbO3 crystal.
1. Introduction
Rare-earth ion doped materials (REDMs), used as upconverters for enhancing the photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells, are currently attracting extensive interest.1 Solar cells, directly using renewable solar energy to generate heat or electricity, are promising devices to make a significant contribution to the improvement of global energy consumption and to meet the long-term worldwide energy demand.2–4 In order to suppress the transmission of sub-band-gap light which is one of the major loss mechanisms in solar cells, REDMs have been used as upconverters applied to the back of solar cells since they can easily upconvert the absorbed near-infrared (NIR) light into visible upconversion (UC) emissions.5–9
Among many trivalent rare earth ions, an Er3+ ion doped material may be the most promising candidate to be used to efficiently increase the solar spectrum response since its transitions of 4I15/2 → 4I11/2/4I13/2 can convert NIR sunlight at wavelengths of 980 nm and 1550 nm into visible emissions. Absorbing the 980/1550 nm sunlight could improve the amount of sunlight absorbed by solar cells, for example amorphous silicon solar cells (ASSCs) can only absorb sunlight with wavelengths shorter than 850 nm, and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) can lose the NIR solar radiation due to their wide bandgap (1.7–1.8 eV).10 A. Shalav et al. first reported that Er3+:NaYF4 phosphors attached to the rear of a bifacial silicon solar cell enhance its responsivity in the NIR range.11 It has been reported by J. de Wild et al. that an enhancement of 10 μA cm−2 was measured under 980 nm excitation in a single junction ASSC with an upconverter of Yb3+/Er3+:β-NaYF4.12 G. B. Shan et al. reported that about 10% enhancement of photocurrent and an overall improvement of DSC efficiency were found in DSCs after the addition of an external Er3+/Yb3+:β-NaYF4 hexagonal nanoplatelet.13 Recently, many works on the optical characteristics of Er3+ ions and Er3+–Yb3+ ion pairs under 1550 nm excitation have sought to improve the efficiency of solar cells. G. Y. Chen et al. reported intense visible and near-infrared upconversion emissions in colloidal Er3+:LiYF4 nanocrystals under 1490 nm excitation. It is proposed that there is a cross relaxation (CR: 2H11/2/4S3/2 + 4I11/2 → 24F9/2) process between two adjacent Er3+ ions under 1490 nm excitation.14 R. M. Rodríguez et al. has converted successfully infrared (IR) emission into NIR upconversion emission, which is a promising option to enhance the efficiency of solar cells.15
Although the host materials are confined mainly to nanosystems, glass-systems, polymer-systems and others, it is worthwhile to study the optical characteristics in rare-earth ion doped LiNbO3 crystals. This is because the well-known versatile LiNbO3 crystal, exhibiting electro-optic, piezo-electric and nonlinear optical physical properties, can successfully combine with the amplifying and lasing characteristics of Er3+ ions.16 Previous work on Er:LiNbO3 applied in integrated optics may offer many more options for the miniaturization of the solar cell.17,18 And LiNbO3 crystals exhibit high mechanical capabilities and excellent chemical stability. Indium (In3+) ions, which have a low threshold concentration of 3 mol%, are used as optical damage resistant ions to suppress the birefringence change and the deformation of the laser beams in Er:LiNbO3 and Er/Yb:LiNbO3 crystals.19
In this paper, we primarily found that the green and red UC emissions could be increased in Er/Yb:LiNbO3 crystals through codoping with In3+ ions under 1550 nm/980 nm excitation. The UC mechanisms of the Er3+ ion and Er3+–Yb3+ ion pairs in LiNbO3 host materials are studied.
2. Experimental section
Congruent LiNbO3 crystals codoped with (a) 0.5 mol% Er3+ ions, (b) 0.5 mol% Er3+, 0.5 mol% Yb3+ and 0, 1, 2 and 3 mol% In3+ ions were grown using the Czochralski technique. The growth and polarization procedures are described in detail in our previous paper.20 These grown crystals are named Er-0.5, In-0, In-1, In-2 and In-3, respectively.
The XRD spectra were measured using a powder diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (D-MAX 2200 VPC, RIGAKU Inc, Japan). The UC emission spectra were measured using a 1550 nm distributed feed back (DFB) laser (ADFB-PU-1550-33-R-FA, Amonics Inc., Hong Kong), and the signal was produced by a Function signal generator (Agilent, America). A combined fluorescence lifetime and steady state spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Inc., England) was used to record the fluorescence spectra. The UC emission spectra, which were excited by a power-controllable 980 nm diode laser, were recorded using a spectrometer (Bruker optics 500IS/SM) equipped with a semiconductor cooled charge coupled device detector (DV440, Andor).
3. Results and discussion
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the In-3 crystal is shown in Fig. 1, which shows that all of the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the known phase of LiNbO3 based on the standard XRD pattern (JCPDS). No new peaks appear in the In-3 crystal XRD pattern, indicating the phase purity of the LiNbO3 product. As illustrated in Fig. 1, compared with the pure hexagonal phase (space group: R3c) of the LiNbO3 structure, the doping In3+, Er3+ and Yb3+ ions have no influence on the structure of the In-3 crystal, suggesting that this crystal still has a trigonal system. Therefore, the In3+, Er3+ and Yb3+ ions may occupy the normal Li-site or Nb-site rather than interstitial sites within the lattice.

Fig. 2 shows the visible UC emission spectra of the Er-0.5 and In/Er/Yb:LiNbO3 crystals under 1550 nm and 980 nm excitation. Fig. 2(a) presents two weak green bands centered at 530 nm and 558 nm and a strong red band at 672 nm. The green bands correspond to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of the Er3+ ion, respectively, and the red UC emission is attributed to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition.21 As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), the green and red UC emissions increase for In-1 and In-3, whereas they decrease for In-2. The intensity of the red UC emission of In-3 is over four times higher than that of In-0. Compared with Er-0.5, the introduction of Yb3+ ions leads to an increased red UC emission. It can be seen from Fig. 2(b) that the increased green and red UC emissions are observed for the In-3 crystal under 980 nm excitation, indicating that the In3+ doping favors not only the conversion of 1550 nm NIR sunlight into visible green and red UC emissions, but also the absorbtion of 980 nm wavelength sunlight. Therefore, using In/Er/Yb:LiNbO3 as an upconverter will make a significant contribution to increasing the solar spectrum response and further improvement of the high photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells.

In order to understand the effect of the In3+ ions on the optical characteristics of the Er3+ ion and Er3+–Yb3+ ion pair under 1550 nm excitation, the UC emission intensities (I) were measured as a function of the pump power (P). The number of photons (n) required to populate the upper emitting state can be obtained from the equation I ∝ Pn.22 Log–log plots of pump power dependence in In/Er/Yb:LiNbO3, shown in Fig. 3, illustrate that the slope values of n are about 3.0 for the green UC emissions, confirming that the green emitting 2H11/2/4S3/2 states are populated via a three-photon process. The red UC emissions yield n = 2.8, 2.8, 2.8 and 2.6 for In-0, In-1, In-2 and In-3, respectively. Considering the energy conservation law, at least three 1550 nm laser photons are needed to populate the red emitting 4F9/2 state. Therefore, the fact that the n values of 2.8 and 2.6 slightly deviate from the expected n = 3 implies that a two-photon process is also involved in populating the 4F9/2 state as well as the three-photon process.

Fig. 4 shows the energy level diagrams of Er3+ and Yb3+ ions, as well as the UC mechanisms under 1550 nm excitation. Here, laser excitation of the Er3+ ion is only considered since the Yb3+ ion has no corresponding energy level which matches the 1550 nm pump laser. As illustrated in Fig. 4, three 1550 nm photons excite the Er3+ ions from the ground 4I15/2 state to the green emitting 2H11/2 state via ground state absorption (GSA: 4I15/2 + a 1550 nm photon → 4I13/2), excited state absorption (ESA1: 4I13/2 + a 1550 nm photon → 4I9/2) and ESA3 (4I9/2 + a 1550 nm photon → 2H11/2) processes. The Er3+ ions at the 4I9/2 state nonradiatively relax to the 4I11/2 state, and the red emitting 4F9/2 state is populated via the ESA2 process (4I11/2 + a 1550 nm photon → 4F9/2). The two-photon process for populating the red emitting 4F9/2 state may be attributed to the energy transfer (ET) process, which is depicted as follows: after the two-photon process of GSA and ESA1, ET (2F7/2 Yb + 4I11/2 Er → 2F5/2 Yb + 4I15/2 Er) and the energy back transfer (EBT: 2F5/2 Yb + 4I13/2 Er → 2F7/2 Yb + 4F9/2 Er) processes are responsible for the population of the 4F9/2 state (Er). The similar EBT process (4S3/2 Er + 2F7/2 Yb → 4I13/2 Er + 2F5/2 Yb) also occurs in Er/Yb-codoped ZrO2 nanocrystals under 980 nm excitation.23 It is proposed that the increase of the red UC emission observed in In-0 related to Er-0.5 arises from ET and EBT processes under 1550 nm excitation.

The absorption cross section (σabs), namely, the optical transition strength, is used to understand the relationship between the optical characteristics and the distribution of Er3+ ions. According to the equation given by W. Q. Shi et al.,24 the values of σabs of In-3 based on ultraviolet-vis-near infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) absorption spectra25 (Fig. S1, please see the ESI†) are calculated and displayed in Table 1. The σabs of In-1 and In-2 can be obtained from our previous work28 since UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectra of In-1 and In-2 are measured under the same conditions as In-3. As displayed in Table 1, the values of σabs for In-3 are larger than those of In-1 and In-2, suggesting that there are fewer Er3+ cluster sites in In-3. This is because the σabs of the Er3+ cluster site is smaller than that of the Er3+ isolated site.26

In general, there are two types of Er3+ ion distributions in LiNbO3 crystals. One is the Er3+ isolated site (ErLi2+ or ErNb2−), which means the Er3+ ion occupies the Li or Nb site. The other is the Er3+ cluster site (ErLi2+–ErNb2−), which consists of one ErLi2+ site and one ErNb2− site.27 As for the UC mechanisms in Er:LiNbO3, an inherent ESA process occurs in the Er3+ isolated sites, and the ET process happens among the Er3+ cluster sites. Obviously, there is a competition between the ESA and ET for an excited state Er3+ ion. Therefore, the decreased Er3+ cluster sites suppress the ET process and lead to an efficient ESA process in In-3, which is responsible for the enhanced green and red UC emissions in In-3 (shown in Fig. 2(a)). Contrarily, the larger content of Er3+ cluster sites in In-2, arising from the minimum values of σabs, is deleterious to the ESA process. The inefficient ESA processes mean the decreased populations of the 2H11/2/4F9/2 states of Er3+ ions. Consequently, the reduced green and red UC emissions are observed in In-2, in agreement with the experimental results shown in Fig. 2(a).
4. Conclusions
In summary, enhanced visible green and red UC emissions induced by 980 nm and 1550 nm excitation are gained in Er/Yb:LiNbO3 through tridoping with 3 mol% In3+ ions, which will provide more possibilities to increase the photovoltaic efficiency of solar cells. The stronger red UC emission is attributed to the dissociation of Er3+ cluster sites in the In-3 crystal, and the EBT process of 2F5/2 Yb + 4I13/2 Er → 2F7/2 Yb + 4F9/2 Er increases the red UC emission in the Er3+–Yb3+ codoped system under 1550 nm excitation. Additionally, conversion of NIR wavelength of 980 nm/1550 nm into visible UC emission re-absorbed by the solar cells may directly apply to other materials doped with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions, such as oxide and fluoride crystals, fibers, films and nanoparticles.
