Investigated samples were synthesized by a ceramic method at 1400 °C in air and characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), dilatometry, chemical titration and electrochemical ac impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Rietveld analysis of PXRD and SAED support the formation of ordered double perovskite-type structure with space group Fmm and chemical stability in 5000 ppm H2S/H2 at 600 °C. Iodometric titration shows the valences of Mn and Co were 2+ and 3+, while Fe shows 3+ and 4+ states. SEM reveals that the porosity of the samples is highly affected by dopants. The thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of the as-prepared samples are very comparable to the oxide conducting Y-doped ZrO2. Ba2Ca0.79Co0.5Nb0.71O6−δ exhibits the total conductivity of 3.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 816 °C in air. The trend in the conductivity of Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ could be correlated to the reduction of the dopants and the subsequent loss of oxide ions at elevated temperatures.1. IntroductionThe solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an energy conversion device that coverts chemical fuels (e.g., H2, CxHy) into electricity and heat with high efficiency up to 90%.1 The by-product CO2 can be safely sequestrated or subsequently chemically transformed back into fuels (e.g., CO) by electrolysis using renewable energy sources such as solar power and wind. Such a “hydrocarbon economy” has unique advantages over the “H2 economy” in term of existing infrastructure for economical delivery and storage of natural gas.2 The state-of-the-art Ni-YSZ anode is de-activated in the presence of ppm levels of H2S and forms coke in hydrocarbons. Currently, mixed ion and electron conductors (MIECs) are considered as alternatives for Ni-YSZ in SOFCs. Cermets such as Ru/CeO2, Cu/CeO2, and Ni/CeO2,3–5 Ni/BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ (Ni/BZCYYb), and single-phase MIECs, including Ni/BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ, Sr2MgMoO6, and La0.8Sr0.2Cr0.5Mn0.5O3−δ,6–9 showed high chemical stability in ppm level H2S contaminated hydrocarbon fuels. In addition, the electrochemically active area is found to be well extended to more than 100 μm away from the triple-phase-boundary in MIECs.2Among the known cermet anodes, proton conducting BZCYYb is of great interest,6 due to its improved chemical stability and the electrochemical activity compared to the Ni-YSZ anodes. Power density of about 1.15 W cm−2 at 750 °C in the H2S/H2 and wet C3H8 fuel was obtained using BZCYYb.6 It has been suggested that the proton conductor could facilitate the carbon and sulfur oxidation to protect the Ni de-activation. BZCYYb requires a very high sintering temperature of 1600 °C,7–9 and recent studies have focused to reduce temperature using sintering aids, such as Ni and In.10–13 The current work involves study on the effect of transition metal ions doping in CO2 stable proton conducting double perovskite-type Ba3CaNb2O9 (BCN).14–19 BCN is being considered as electrolytes for an intermediate temperature (IT) proton conducting SOFCs.20–23 Here, we report the crystal structure, chemical stability and electrical properties of Mn, Fe and Co-doped BCN.2. Experimental2.1 SynthesisDouble perovskite-type oxides of the nominal chemical formula Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ (M = Mn, Fe and Co) were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction in air at elevated temperature. Stoichiometric amounts of ACS graded BaNO3 (99+%, Alfa Aesar), CaCO3 (99+%, Alfa Aesar), Nb2O5 (99+%, Alfa Aesar), MnCO3 (99+%, Alfa Aesar), Fe2O3 (99+%, Alfa Aesar) and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (99+%, Fisher Scientific Company) were ball-milled (Pulverisette, Fritsch, Germany) in 2-propanol using ZrO2 ball for 6 h at 200 rpm with reversed rotation every hour to ensure proper mixing. The precursors were dried and subsequently calcinated at 1000 °C (5 °C min−1) in air for 12 h. The resulting powders were hand-grinded and pressed into pellets using isostatic pressure of 200 MPa and the pellets were sintered at 1400 °C (5 °C min−1) in air for 12 h.2.2 Phase characterizationsEx situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurement was carried out using a Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα, 40 kV, 40 mA). Typically, measurements were performed from 2θ = 10° to 80° at a count rate of 15 s per step of 0.02° at ambient condition. In situ PXRD measurements using a high temperature reactor chamber (Anton Paar XRK 900) and data were acquired from 2θ = 10° to 80° at a count rate of 6 s per step of 0.05°. The in situ and ex situ PXRD datasets were refined by Rietveld method using the GSAS package with the EXPGUS interface.24 Background, scale factor, zero-point position, cell parameters, atomic positions and profile coefficients for pseudo-Voight/FCJ asymmetric peak shape function were refined until the convergence was achieved. Bond lengths were obtained using a DISAGL Version Win32 Crystal Structure Distance and Angle Program. Bond valences were calculated by Bond Valence Calculator Version 2.00.25 Instead of reporting the valence for the individual cations in 4a and 4b sites, we calculated the average valences in the sites as the bond lengths calculated from the Rietveld refinement are the average bond distances for the cations in the crystallographic sites.Investigated double perovskite samples were further analyzed using a Philips XL 30 conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Samples were gold-coated prior to prevent the surface charging effect. Images were recorded at 20 kV with a secondary electron detector. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was performed on a FEI Tecnai F20 FEG-TEM (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with a Gatan Imaging Filter and a Gatan 860 GIF 2001 CCD of 1024 × 1024 resolution. Thermal stability measurement was conducted in Metter Toledo thermal system TGA/DSC1 (HT 1600 °C) Thermogravimetric Analyzer with Stare system. The samples were measured up to 1000 °C at the ramping rate of 3 °C min−1 in 10% H2/N2.Chemical stability of Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ under 5000 ppm H2S/H2 were studied at 600 °C. The samples were heat-treated in 5000 ppm H2S/H2 at the targeted temperatures for 12 h and then cooled down to room temperature in the same atmosphere. The post-treated samples were examined by PXRD, SEM and EDX. Thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ were measured using in a LINSEIS dilatometer (L75 platinum series) in air under the ramp rate of 10 K min−1 at 288–1173 K. The as-prepared samples were hand-grounded and pressed into pellets by hydraulic press and sintered at 1400 °C for 4 h under the ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 prior to TEC studies.The oxidation states of the transition metal dopants were determined by chemical titration. About 0.1 g of the as-prepared samples was dissolved into ca. 15 ml of 4 M HCl on the hot plate at 150 °C for 15 min. The solution was reacted with 10 ml of 20 wt% of KI (ACS graded, Fisher Scientific company) under inert atmosphere. The resultant solution was then titrated with standard 0.1 M of Na2S2O3 (99+%, Alfa Aesar) using starch solution (ACS graded, Alfa Aesar) as an indicator under N2 atmosphere. Each sample was measured for 3 times to confirm the reproducibility.2.3 Electrical characterizationThe electrical properties were measured in various atmospheres by a Solartron electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; SI model no 1260, 100 mV, 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz. The pellets were Pt coated (Heraeus Inc., LP A88-11S, Germany) and stabilized at 900 °C for 1 h to remove organic binders. Pt wires were attached to the surface of the pellet using spring-loaded contact which served as current collectors. The cell was then heated to the temperature range 300–800 °C using a tubular furnace (Barnstead; model no 21100) and held at constant temperatures for 2 h prior to each measurement.3. Results and discussion3.1 Structural analysisParent phase, Ba3Ca1+xNb2−xO9−δ, exhibits three polymorphs, including 1:2 ordered trigonal structure (space group (s.g.): Pm1), 1:1 ordered cubic perovskite structure (s.g., Fmm) and disordered primitive cubic structure (s.g.: Pmm) for x = 1.18.14–22Fig. 1 shows the structure of three polymorphs of BCN structure. Ti, Zn, Fe, K, Ta and Ce-doped BCN known to form 1:1 ordered cubic perovskite structure.20–23,27,28 The PXRD patterns of the as-prepared transition metal ions-doped BCN could all be indexed as 1:1 B-site ordered double perovskite-type structure, except for Ba2Ca0.79Nb0.71M0.5O6−δ (M = Mn, Co). Small amount of simple-perovskite phase was detected in addition to the main double-perovskite phase. Fig. 1  Idealised crystal structure of (a) 1:2 ordered hexagonal Ba3CaNb2O9, (b) 1:1 ordered cubic Ba3Ca1.12Nb1.82O9−δ and (c) B-site disordered cubic Ba(Ca, Nb)O3. The X-ray and neutron diffraction (ND) studies shown14–19,29,30 that the Ca2+ (rCa2+ = 1.14 Å) ions preference 4a site, while Nb5+ (rNb5+ = 0.78 Å) ions occupy both 4a and 4b sites in the ordered perovskite-type structure (space group Fmm). Similarly, the structural analysis of various double-perovskite type oxides such as Ba2LnNbO6−δ (Ln = Y3+ (rY3+ = 0.92 Å), Gd3+ (rGd3+ = 0.97 Å), Sm3+ (rSm3+ = 1.0 Å), Nd3+ (rNd3+ = 1.0 Å), and La3+ (rLa3+ = 1.14 Å)) indicates that cationic size is crucial to the site ordering, where larger cations with smaller valences are stable in 4a site (octahedral) and smaller cations with larger valences are stable in 4b site (octahedral) in the double perovskite. Since the ionic sizes of the dopants are in octahedral co-ordination in the range of 0.69–0.79 Å (rFe3+ = 0.69 Å, rMn2+ = 0.81 Å, rMn3+ = 0.72 Å, rCo2+ = 0.79 Å, and rCo3+ = 0.75 Å) that are in the range to that of Nb5+ (rNb5+ = 0.64 Å).31,32 Thus, we considered that the dopants were likely occupy the Nb5+ ions (4a and 4b sites). The distribution of the dopant on a certain site was calculated based on the molar ratio of the dopant to the sum of the dopant and Nb5+ ions, as shown in Table 1. The oxygen contents in Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ were calculated according to the valences of the transition metals determined from iodometric titration (Table 2) and were used as inputs for the oxygen occupancies in the Rietveld refinement.

Table 1 lists the atomic position, occupancy, and cell constant obtained from the Rietveld analysis for all the investigated BCN. The R factor was found to be small which indicates the structure solutions are in good agreement with the proposed double perovskite-type structure. However, we did not observe a linear change of cell parameters for the compounds Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ as a function of the dopants (Fig. S1, see ESI†) which could be due to difference in valences of the dopants (Table 2). The bond valence sums (BVS) of all cations were calculated from the bond lengths of cation-oxygen bonds derived from Rietveld analysis, and listed in Table 3. However, the bond valence of Fe4+ ion could not be estimated correctly due to the lack of certain bond valence parameter.25 Nonetheless, the BVS of Fe4+ was estimated by the bond valence parameter of Fe3+ ion as the Fe4+ concentration was less than 25%. The average bond valence of cations in the 8c and 4a/4b sites were found to be +1.87 and +3.89, respectively, which were in good agreement with the nominal oxidation states of +2 and +4. The values were slightly smaller than the valences of cations in un-doped simple perovskites (e.g., BaCeO3), suggesting that a small amount of oxygen vacancies were present in the structures.33 Fig. 2  Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) Rietveld refinement of the as-prepared (A) Ba2Ca0.79Mn0.16Nb1.05O5.60 (i); (B) Ba2Ca0.79Fe0.16Nb1.05O5.68 (ii); (C) Ba2Ca0.79Co0.16Nb1.05O5.61 (iii); (D) Ba2Ca0.67Mn0.33NbO5.55 (iv); (E) Ba2Ca0.67Fe0.33NbO5.66 (v); (F) Ba2Ca0.67Co0.33NbO5.53 (vi); (G) Ba2Ca0.79Mn0.5Nb0.71O5.09 (vii); (H) Ba2Ca0.79Fe0.5Nb0.71O5.35 (viii); and (I) Ba2Ca0.79Co0.5Nb0.71O5.10 (ix).

Samples were found to be rather homogeneous in size and in the range of a few microns from the SEM images, as shown in Fig. 4. SEM reveals that the porosity of the samples is highly affected by dopants. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirms the elemental ratios of the samples as shown in Table S1 (see ESI†). The non-reducible cations in the 4a and 4b sites of BCNs phases such as Ca2+ can stabilize the structure from collapsing in the fuel reducing atmospheres, similar to the role of Mg2+ ions in Sr2MgMnO6 reported by Goodenough et al.34 Replacing the Ca2+ with a dopant could increase the oxygen vacancy concentration and the oxide ion conductivity. For samples with a high concentration of low valence dopants (M = Mn and Co ≥ 0.5 in Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ), unknown secondary phases were detected. Those dopants have relatively large sizes and therefore, could reduce the tendency of site ordering.

The ex situ Rietveld refinement on PXRD patterns confirmed that the double-perovskite structure was maintained in 600 °C for 12 h (Fig. S2, see ESI†). The cell parameters of the chemically treated samples were found to increase slightly, as dopants were reduced in the fuel reducing atmospheres (Table S2, see ESI†). No secondary phase was detected due to the formation of MnSx, FeSx, or CoSx. The SEM images also confirmed that the particle sizes and shapes did not change after treatment, as shown in Fig. S3.† However, the EDX results showed that a trace amount of S was found in the Fe-doped samples, indicating that H2S and/or Sx could be adsorbed on the surfaces of the samples (Table S3, see ESI†). The samples were also analyzed in situ under pure CO2 by PXRD and results are presented in Fig. 5. We did not observe any secondary phase up to 800 °C from formation of BaCO3. The results are quite promising as the samples did not undergo any phase change under the contaminated fuels, suggesting that they are physically and chemically stable in the SOFC working environments.

The low-frequency intercepts on the Z′ axis were interpreted as total resistance and is used to determine the total electrical conductivity. The presence of the low-frequency intercepts on Z′ suggests the non-blocking at the electrode and material interface.26,27,35–37 The Arrhenius plots for the total conductivities of Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ in air, H2, 3% H2O in air and 3% H2O in H2 are shown in Fig. 6. Interestingly, the conductivity was found to increase with both temperature and dopant concentration in all atmospheres. The total electrical conductivity of the Mn-doped samples in air are in the order of Ba2Ca0.79Mn0.5Nb0.71O5.09 > Ba2Ca0.67Mn0.33NbO5.55 > Ba2Ca0.79Mn0.16Nb1.05O5.60 in the temperature range of study (Table 2). The conductivities of the Co-doped samples in air were in the order of Ba2Ca0.79Co0.5Nb0.71O5.10 > Ba2Ca0.67Co0.33NbO5.53 > Ba2Ca0.79Co0.16Nb1.05O5.61, very similar trend as the Mn analogs (Table 2). Since the valences of Mn and Co are found to be similar from the iodometric analysis on Fig. S1 (see ESI†) their intrinsic oxide vacancies should be comparable in the same order. Fig. 6  The Arrhenius plots of (a) Ba2Ca0.79Mn0.16Nb1.05O5.60, (b) Ba2Ca0.79Fe0.16Nb1.05O5.68, (c) Ba2Ca0.79Co0.16Nb1.05O5.61, (d) Ba2Ca0.67Mn0.33NbO5.55, (e) Ba2Ca0.67Fe0.33NbO5.66, and (f) Ba2Ca0.67Co0.33NbO5.53, in air, H2, 3% H2O in air, and 3% H2O in H2. Their activation energies for electrical conduction are shown in (g). The oxide vacancies in the compounds are crucial to deliver fast oxide ion movement at elevated temperature; the vacancies can also react with water vapour to form hydroxyl groups in the structure to promote protonic conduction as shown in the empirical equation: (1)where ,  and  are oxide ion vacancy, oxygen lattice and hydroxyl group. Ba2Ca0.67Fe0.33NbO5.66 showed highest conductivities among the atmospheres of air, H2, 3% H2O in H2 and 3% H2O in air. The higher conductivities in 3% H2O in air compared to air were due to the formation of hydroxyl groups in the structure and high electrical conductivity in hydrogen atmosphere could also due to electronic conduction (n-type).Because of the p-type conductive behaviour of the doped BCNs in high oxygen partial pressure regime, all compounds exhibit higher conductivities in dry air than dry H2. Although the reduction potentials of Co and Mn ions are comparable, the conductivities of Co-doped are found to be higher than the Mn-doped samples for all temperature range of study. Fig. 7 shows TGA data for Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ in air. Some subtle differences are found in the SEM microstructures of the samples, particularly the present of some open pores in the Mn-doped BCN samples. Such open pores could potentially lower the conduction. The activation energy for electrical conduction in air and N2 was found to be in the range 0.5–0.75 eV and is within range for oxide ion conduction in perovskite-type compounds.14–23 In the humidified conditions, the activation energy was found to be 0.3–0.5 eV, except for Mn compound (0.73 eV) (Fig. 6g). Among the investigated samples in this study, the highest total conductivity of 3.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 was observed for Ba2Ca0.79Co0.5Nb0.71O6−δ at 816 °C in air (Fig. S5, see ESI†). Fig. 7  Thermo gravimetric analysis of (a) (i) Ba2Ca0.79Mn0.16Nb1.05O5.60; (ii) Ba2Ca0.79Fe0.16Nb1.05O5.68; (iii) Ba2Ca0.79Co0.16Nb1.05O5.61, (b) (iv) Ba2Ca0.67Mn0.33NbO5.55; (v) Ba2Ca0.67Fe0.33NbO5.66; (vi) Ba2Ca0.67Co0.33NbO5.53, and (c) (vii) Ba2Ca0.79Mn0.5Nb0.71O5.09; (viii) Ba2Ca0.79Fe0.5Nb0.71O5.35; (ix) Ba2Ca0.79Co0.5Nb0.71O5.10 in 10% H2/N2. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ was measured by dilatometer in air (Fig. 8). The expansion of samples as a function of temperature can be attributed to thermal expansion of atoms in the structure and the chemical expansion due to reduction, as shown in Fig. 7. The thermal expansion coefficients of the samples are found to be very close to the state-of-the-art 8 mol% YSZ electrolyte (ca. 11 × 10−6 K−1 from 288–1173 K).38 Such results are encouraging as it suggests YSZ is physically compatible with Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ at elevated temperatures.

ConclusionsA new family of metal oxide with formula Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ was developed as mixed conductors for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The as-prepared samples have double-perovskite type structural with s.g. of Fmm. All of the investigated samples were characterized by Rietveld refinement on PXRD, SAED, SEM, EDX, BVS, and EIS. Rietveld analysis reveals that Mn, Fe and Co can be located on the 4a and 4b site in Fmm. The conductivity increases in the order of Mn < Fe < Co for the same composition of Ba2Ca(1−x−y)M(x+z)Nb(1−z+y)O6−δ compounds. The highest total electrical conductivity is 3.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 for Ba2Ca0.79Co0.5Nb0.71O6−δ at 816 °C in air.AcknowledgementsThis research was supported through funding to the NSERC Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Canada Strategic Research Network from the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and other sponsors listed at http://www.sofccanada.com.
