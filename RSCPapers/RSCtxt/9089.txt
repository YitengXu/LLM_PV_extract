    , Accepted 19th January 2017First published on 20th January 2017AbstractThe fabrication of thin layers of organic photoactive materials (typically ca. 100–200 nm thick) over large area is needed for the commercial realization of organic solar cells. This is challenging because defects on these thin layers can cause high leakage currents which lead to poor device performance and, ultimately, to poor device yield. Here, we report that organic solar cells with a tandem structure can display an increased tolerance to defects and are found less susceptible to parasitic area scaling-up effects compared to single-junction solar cells. We demonstrate 10.5 cm2 flexible tandem solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 6.5% with a fabrication yield of over 90% in a laboratory environment. The high fabrication yield and good performance displayed by tandem organic solar cells suggest that despite their increased complexity, they could provide a viable path towards the commercial realization of efficient large-area organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSC) represent an attractive alternative for the development of sustainable photovoltaic technology.1–4 In the past two decades, photoactive materials and device configurations have improved continuously.5–8 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of laboratory-scale OSCs now exceeds 10% (ref. 9–15) and the demonstration of all-plastic and recyclable organic solar cells highlight the great potential for organic solar cells to become an environmentally friendly sustainable power-generation technology.16,17 Despite progress, area scale-up remains an important challenge to be addressed towards the realization of this goal. This is because current transparent conductors used as electrodes display sheet resistance values that limit the maximum area a device may have before carrier collection is limited by parasitic series resistance effects;18–22 because the fabrication of defect-free ultra-thin layers, typically in the range from 70 to 200 nm, from solution processed methods and over large areas is extremely challenging.23,24 In the literature, most studies on area scale-up of OSCs have focus on the mitigation of parasitic series resistance effects, but only a few papers discuss issues related to the fabrication yield of OSCs and its implications for the cost-model for OSC.25–27
The fabrication of large-area OSC will involve the deposition of organic layers using one or various solution-processed deposition techniques such as spin-coating, blade-coating, slot-die coating, etc. During fabrication, the integrity of these organic layers can be easily disrupted by defects inherent to the substrates themselves or introduced by particles or contaminants present in the environment. Since the probability of defect occurrence increases with the area of a device, area scale-up of OSCs typically leads to a low yield and poor reproducibility. This problem is particularly serious in serial-connected OSC modules where sub-cell performance variations will cause considerable loss of their performance.25 To mitigate the influence of defects, thick bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layers are preferred over thin, but device performance is commonly compromised due to the increased parasitic series resistance and the limited carrier diffusion length found in OSCs.28–31
Although demonstrations of large-area OSCs exist in the literature, discussions of the device yield remain scarce. The focus is generally on advances in electrode architecture or active layer processing.28,32–34 For instance, recently, Zuo et al. demonstrated 2 × 2 cm2 flexible large-area OSCs with a high PCE of 7.09% using a thickness-gradient ultra-thin Ag film as the transparent electrode (TE);32 Jin et al. achieved 5 × 5 cm2 OSCs with a PCE of 3.08% using MoO3/metal/MoO3 as the top TE.33 Both studies were dedicated to improving the balance between the light trapping and the resistance-induced energy loss. On the other hand, Wu et al. engineered the vertical phase separation of the photoactive layer and fabricated 10 × 1 cm2 OSCs with a PCE of 4.10% by using a spray-coating technique under ambient atmosphere.34 Armin et al. realized a 4.6% PCE on 5 × 5 cm2 OSCs without shorting defects using thick organic junctions of DPP-DTT:PC70BM cast from high-molecular weight, high-viscosity solutions.28
OSCs with a tandem architecture are commonly investigated as an approach to increase the power conversion efficiency of OSCs.35,36 The main research of tandem solar cells generally focus on three aspects: bandgap tunable and efficient active materials,37–40 efficient charge-recombination layer41–44 and novel device structure.45–48 To date, area scale-up of tandem OSCs remains largely overlooked in the literature.49 Here, we conduct an investigation on the area scale-up of tandem OSCs with a focus on the device yield. We demonstrate that large-area (up-to 10.5 cm2) tandem OSCs with a transparent top-electrode, shown in Fig. 1a, retain more than 80% of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) displayed by small area OSCs (0.05 cm2); reaching PCE values up to 6.5%. Our studies show that tandem OSCs can display a superior tolerance to defects compared to single junction cells, leading to higher device fabrication yields when the area is increased. We find that the performance (particularly fill factor) of tandem OSCs is less susceptible to the parasitic area upscaling effects when compared to OSCs with a single-junction structure.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Device structure and performance of flexible large-area tandem cells
As shown in Fig. 1a, OSCs with a tandem geometry were fabricated using the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as a transparent electrode. PEDOT:PSS displays a broadband optical transmission of over 80% from 400–1000 nm, a sheet resistance of about 100 Ω sq.−1, and can be prepared by the transfer-printing method.50,51 To reduce the series resistance, silver grid lines were evaporated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer yielding shadowing losses of 5%.19,52 As a bottom electrode, a silver film with a thickness of 60 nm was evaporated on flexible polyethersulfone (PES) and coated with an ultrathin layer of polyethylenimine (PEI) to enhance electron extraction.8 As a charge-recombination layer (CRL), we employed a PEI modified m-PEDOT:PSS layer with an optimized conductivity of 10−2 S cm−1 by modifying the formulation of PEDOT:PSS and selecting 2-propanol (IPA) as the PEI processing solvent as reported previously.16 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layer is comprised of either a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and indene–C60 bis-adduct (ICBA) or a blend of poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene) derivative (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM). The molecular structure of the materials is shown in Fig. S1.† The whole device structure of the flexible tandem OSC was PES/Ag/PEI/BHJ1/m-PEDOT:PSS/PEI/BHJ2/hc-PEDOT:PSS/Ag grids (Fig. 1a).
When both BHJ active layers are P3HT:ICBA, the flexible tandem cell with an area of 10.90 (3.5 × 3.1) cm2 yields VOC = 1.64 V, JSC = 4.44 mA cm−2, FF = 0.61 and PCE = 4.43%; when two different active layers are employed, that is P3HT:ICBA for BHJ1 and PTB7-Th:PC61BM for BHJ2, the cell with an area of 10.50 (3.3 × 3.2) cm2 yields maximum values of VOC = 1.55 V, JSC = 6.64 mA cm−2, FF = 0.63 and PCE = 6.50% (Fig. 2 and Table 1). For comparison, small-area (5 mm2) reference devices with the same device structure (without silver grids) were also fabricated. The large-area cells (about 10 cm2) maintains about 85% PCE of the reference cells. Particularly, high fill factor values of over 0.60 were achieved for the large-area cells (Table 1). A PCE of 6.50% is, to our best knowledge, the highest PCE achieved for flexible monolithic large-area (>10 cm2) OSCs. With the flexible, efficient, light-weight large-area tandem cells, we demonstrate that a toy electric car can be powered to run under sunlight as shown in the ESI Video.†

2.2 High device yield of flexible large-area tandem cells
In addition to the performance parameters displayed by large-area tandem solar cells, another important aspect we studied was the evolution of device yield compared to that found in single-junction solar cells when the total area of the cell is scaled-up. Fig. 3 shows the results of this study where we compared the performance of a series of large-area single-junction solar cells to that of large-area tandem solar cells. We found that out of 18 tandem devices fabricated from 5 different batches all yield VOC values around 1.5 V (Fig. 3a) and high fill factor (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the yield of large-area single-junction cells was found extremely low. This is attributed to significant reductions of the shunt-resistance value of devices due to the presence of an increasing number of defects (including pinholes) as the device area is increased.28 In addition, area scale-up also increases the probability of near short-circuits between the top and bottom electrodes. Here, by near short-circuit we refer to cases where the shunt resistance becomes sufficiently low that the measured current–voltage characteristic is mainly determined by the finite resistance of the PEDOT:PSS layer(s) used for the electrodes and CRL. The shape of the current–voltage characteristic in this case is no longer that of a diode. In the case where defects are introduced both in the active layer as well as in both the top and bottom PEDOT:PSS layers, the continuous bottom Ag electrode could be in contact with the patterned top Ag electrode, leading to a true short-circuit.

To test this analysis, we carried out experiments in which defects were controlled and intentionally introduced in the active layer of devices with an ITO bottom electrode and a PEDOT:PSS top electrode (Fig. 4a–c). To introduce a defect in a BHJ layer, the BHJ layer was prepared by using a transfer lamination technique.53 A small portion of the BHJ film was removed before being laminated to the glass/ITO/PEI surface to obtain the target defect area. To create a defect within the CRL shown in Fig. 4d, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) square with an area of approximately 1 mm2 was placed on the bottom BHJ layer prior to plasma treatment to create a hydrophobic spot where the subsequent deposition of m-PEDOT:PSS would be hindered in this area. The area of solar cells fabricated for this set of tests is about 0.7–1 cm2 and the defect area is controlled to be ca. 1 mm2 (ca. 1% of the total device area). As shown in Fig. 4d, the photovoltaic performance of single-junction devices significantly dropped in devices where 1 mm2 defects were introduced in the active layer. These devices, displayed a low VOC value of 0.37 V and a FF value of 0.25. In contrast, when the defect was created within the bottom BHJ of a tandem device (Fig. 4b), the VOC and FF values of defect-containing devices were 1.68 V and 0.60, respectively; only slightly lower than those of the device without the 1 mm2 defect (1.70 V and 0.62, Fig. 4e). When the defect was created within the CRL, the VOC and FF values were 1.65 V and 0.55, respectively (Fig. 4f).

Insets are optical microscopic images of the created defects. 
The current voltage characteristics of defect-containing devices (Fig. 4d–f) can be rationalized using an equivalent circuit model approach wherein a solar cell (single junction or tandem) is approximated as a single diode connected in parallel with a current source and a shunt resistor, and a resistor connected in series. In this context, a defect in a single-junction cell (Fig. 4a) leads to a reduction of the shunt resistance of the device causing a significant reduction in both current and voltage delivered to the external load, hence, leading to the rapid degradation of the device performance (Fig. 4d). For a tandem-structure and in the absence of vertical registration of defects, the main effect of defects introduced in either one of the active layers (Fig. 4b) or in the CRL (Fig. 4c) is to decrease the shunt resistance of the device (Fig. 4e and f). It should be noted that in the defect area of a tandem structure, since this area is coated with at least one layer of the BHJ, the value of shunt resistance associated with this area is only slightly reduced. However, and in contrast with a single junction cell, this same area in a tandem structure can still generate some power. This increased defect tolerance leads to a high device yield displayed by large-area flexible tandem cells.
2.3 Parasitic resistance effects on the performance of large-area tandem cells
It is well known that tandem solar cells offer the possibility of achieving a higher level of performance than single-junction solar cells due to increased absorption. However, in addition to the increased fabrication yield already discussed in the previous section, it is less known that they are less sensitive to parasitic resistance effects during area scale-up. As shown in Fig. 5a, tandem solar cells with an area increasing from 5 to 98 mm2 and single-junction cells from 4 to 105 mm2 were fabricated. The width and length of the active area was approximately equal. The single-junction structure is glass/ITO/PEI/P3HT:ICBA/hc-PEDOT:PSS and the tandem structure is glass/ITO/PEI/P3HT:ICBA/m-PEDOT:PSSS/PEI/P3HT:ICBA/hc-PEDOT:PSS. For the tandem cells, FF values slightly decrease from 0.67 to 0.62 and PCE values from 4.86 to 3.78% when the area increases from 5 to 98 mm2 (Table 2). In contrast, FF and PCE of the single-junction cells decreased by 30% and 60%, respectively, (FF from 0.67 to 0.48, PCE from 4.70 to 2.75%) when the area increases from 4 to 105 mm2. This shows that the performance of tandem cells is less sensitive to area scale-up.

Next, we investigate the effects of series resistance (RS, (Ω cm2)) in single and tandem cells as a function of device area. The series resistance includes contributions from electrodes, BHJ and interfacial layers, and can be expressed as follows:54 (1)
Where A (cm2) is the active area of device, L (cm) and W (cm) are the length and width of the active area. For this study L = W. Rsheet-ITO and Rsheet-PEDOT (Ω sq.−1) are the sheet resistance of electrodes, i.e. ITO and PEDOT:PSS. ρ (Ω cm) and t (cm) refer to resistivity and thickness of the organic composite, respectively. N corresponds to the number of layers between the electrodes. The extracted series resistance from the cells is plotted as a function of device area in Fig. 5b. The value of RS of both the single-junction cells and the tandem cells linearly increases as a function of A. The fitted lines of the two types of the cells are nearly parallel which is consistent with eqn (1) and previous results by Xiao et al.49 That is because the slope of the two lines is proportional to the sheet resistance of the electrodes (Rsheet-ITO + Rsheet-PEDOT) as shown in eqn (1). Since both structures (single-junction and tandem) employ the same bottom and top electrodes, a similarity in slope values is expected.
The influence of parasitic series and shunt resistance on the fill factor (FF) of a solar cell can be expressed as follows:55 (2)
Where FF(0) is the fill-factor of an ideal solar cell, RCH is the characteristic resistance (RCH = VOC/JSC). The value of RCH is about 100 Ω cm2 for the single-junction cell and 400 Ω cm2 for the tandem solar cell as summarized in Table 2 (the tandem cells have double VOC but half of JSC of the counterparts of single-junction cells). RCH/RP < 0.005 that is negligible (Table 2). When the device area is larger than 1 cm2, the values of RS of both single-junction and tandem cells are dominated by the sheet resistance of the ITO and PEDOT:PSS electrode (eqn (1) and Fig. 5b). Therefore, the FF of the tandem cells is less influenced by the RS due to higher values of RCH. In fact, without using a high conductive metal electrode (only ITO bottom electrode and PEDOT:PSS top electrode without Ag grids), we are able to fabricate a tandem device with an active area exceeding 2 cm2 (about 1.5 × 1.5 cm2) and still obtain a high FF of 60%. This is not achievable when using a single-junction structure (Fig. S2†).
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have achieved a high PCE (6.5%) in 10.5 cm2 large-area flexible monolithic organic tandem solar cells. Solar cells with this architecture, using bottom metal electrode and top transparent electrode design, exhibit higher PCE and improved fabrication yield than solar cells with a single-junction architecture; thus demonstrating superior properties for area scale-up. Large-area (10.5 cm2) flexible tandem solar cells retain 82% of the PCE of small-area reference cells. We have also shown that undesirable shunt resistance effects are more likely to be mitigated using a tandem architecture approach. The increased number of sequential depositions of various organic layers in a tandem architecture (active layers and CRL), provided that inherent defects in each layer are not registered in the vertical direction, increases the overall shunt resistance of the solar cell, hence yield and performance. This benefit becomes more important as the area of the cell is increased. In the current work, the 10.5 cm2-layers of the cells are prepared by spin coating. The spin coating technique will possibly not be suitable for fabrication when the device area further increases. The advantage of the tandem structure of higher defect tolerance and being less susceptible to parasitic area scaling-up will make it more attractive when large-area cells are fabricated via slot-die coating or other coating techniques.
