    , Accepted 8th September 2022First published on 9th September 2022AbstractMimicking plant photosynthesis for converting CO2 into high-energy chemical fuels on photocatalysts powered by sunlight is expected to simultaneously alleviate the current energy shortage and global warming. Among the various photocatalysts developed for solar energy conversion, covalent organic polymers (COPs) have attracted increasing attention because of their predictable synthetic routes, variable electronic structures, and precisely regulated active sites. Here, a series of amido-coupled metal porphyrin (MPor)–Ru(II) pincer complexes (RuN3) COPs (MPor–RuN3, M = Co, Ni, Cu or Zn) were synthesized and adopted as photocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). It was found that the metal center regulation of the porphyrin unit in COPs can effectively boost the photocatalytic CO2RR activity with CO yield following an order of CuPor–RuN3 > NiPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 > CoPor–RuN3 with the aid of 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) as a sacrificial electron donor. Especially, CuPor–RuN3 COP delivered the highest CO yield under both visible light (74.3 μmol h−1 g−1) and full spectrum (143.7 μmol h−1 g−1) illumination of Xe-lamp, 4.7 and 4.4 times that of the metal-free control (H2Por–RuN3), respectively. The control experiments and theoretic calculations revealed that the metal center of the porphyrin unit not only affects the photoexcited charge separation but also influences the BIH oxidation dynamics on the porphyrin units, which has rarely been discussed before. Both of them then jointly contributed to the significantly improved CO2RR activity of the CuPor–RuN3 COP. This work shows an effective method to boost the CO2RR performance of porphyrin-based COPs by regulating the structure and composition, and provides valuable insights into the photocatalytic mechanism at the molecular level.
1. Introduction
Mimicking photosynthesis for converting CO2 into high-energy chemical fuels (CO, CH4, CH3OH, etc.) on photocatalysts powered by sunlight is expected to alleviate the current energy shortage and global warming simultaneously,1–3 but the low quantum efficiency limits this technique for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) outside the laboratory. Therefore, it is inevitable to explore the internal structure–performance relationship of photocatalysts for building a more efficient CO2RR system.4 In this context, investigating the effect of porphyrin functional groups,5 forming efficient single-atom catalytic sites,6,7 and using other specific structures have been regarded as effective approaches for revealing the structure–performance relationship of CO2RR photocatalysts. As a new type of photocatalyst with special structure, organic polymers such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),8–10 covalent organic frameworks (COFs),11,12 conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs),13,14 and covalent organic polymers (COPs),15–17 have drawn more and more attention in the field of CO2RR owing to their predictable synthetic routes, variable chemical and electronic structures, precise regulation and distinguished active sites, which can give deep insight into the structure–activity relationship for CO2RR at the molecular level.18–20
It is well-known that the crystallization of MOFs/COFs usually requires an assembly via a highly reversible-condensation reaction,11,12 which inevitably weakens the chemical stability and structural tunability of polymers, thus possibly limiting their practical applications. By contrast, COPs give up the pursuit of crystallization to obtain better stability and higher tolerance for monomers.17 In this regard, COPs are more likely to be applied in industrial photocatalysis.21 Recently, we found that certain RuII-N′NN′ pincer complexes (N′NN′ = 2,6-bis(benzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine) have good CO2RR catalytic activity in homogeneous or heterogeneous systems,22,23 which makes them promising as reduction units in polymer photocatalysts.17 On the other hand, porphyrin molecules, as the photosynthetic center of green plants, possess advantages such as efficient B-/Q-band absorption and high fluorescence.24–26 Besides, their photophysical and photochemical features can be expediently modified with various functional groups and metal centers, which make them popular as photosensitive units for building polymer photocatalysts.8,11,24
More recently, a novel COP consisting of coupled meso-tetrakis(4-chlorobenzoyl)porphyrin cobalt(II) (CoPorCl) and 2,6-bis(5-amino-benzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine ruthenium(II) pincer complex (RuN3) was synthesized and used as the photocatalyst for CO2RR in our group.17 It was found that periodic Z-scheme molecular junctions are formed by the linkage of the amide group to facilitate the photoexcited electrons transferring from the CoPor units to RuN3 ones in the COP, whereby Ru and Co centers serve as the reduction and oxidative single-atom active sites, respectively. Moreover, a photocatalytic CO2RR mechanism involving a pincer-typed N′NN′-Ru–CO intermediate as the real reduction site was proposed. This work provides a new thread for exploring more efficient COP-based photocatalysts with uniformly dispersed single-atom active sites for CO2RR.
In principle, changing the metal centers in the porphyrin units in the porphyrin-based COPs can tune the photophysical and electronic properties, and then the photocatalytic CO2RR activity. To further explore the structure–activity relationship, a series of isostructural porphyrin-based COPs (MPor–RuN3, M = Co, Ni, Cu or Zn, Scheme 1) were synthesized via polyamidation of the metal(II) meso-tetrakis(4-carbo-xyphenyl) porphyrin (MPor) and RuN3 pincer complex.17 With 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) as the sacrificial electron donor (SED),17 those amido-coupled MPor–RuN3 COPs showed much better CO2RR performance than the metal-free control (H2Por–RuN3 COP) under visible light irradiation, and the CO yield follows the order CuPor–RuN3 > NiPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 > CoPor–RuN3 > H2Por–RuN3. The control experiments and theoretic calculations demonstrate that the metal center regulation of the porphyrin units in the amido-coupled COPs can not only effectively tune the photochemical property and photoexcited charge separation efficiency, but also influences the BIH oxidation dynamics on porphyrin units that have been rarely discussed before. Both of them then jointly contributed to the obviously improved CO2RR activity of the CuPor–RuN3 COP.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Material synthesis
Polyphosphoric acid, 1,2-phenylene diamine, 2,6-pyridine-dicarboxylic acid, and 98% H2SO4 were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. and used as received. Solvents such as acetonitrile (CH3CN), dimethylformamide (DMF), and ether were dried by redistilling with CaH2 or Na under N2 atmosphere. 2,6-Bis(5-amino-benzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine Ru(II) pincer complex (RuN3) was synthesized and characterized according to our previous method.17Meso-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (MPor, M = H2, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn) monomers were synthesized through a two-step process (Scheme S1†). Among these, the metal-free porphyrin (H2Por) and CoPor monomers were synthesized and characterized according to our previous method.17 CuPor (or NiPor, ZnPor) was synthesized by refluxing H2Por (0.10 g, 0.13 mmol) and Cu(AcO)2·4H2O (or Ni(AcO)2·4H2O, Zn(AcO)2·2H2O) (0.78 mmol) in 20 mL of DMF for 4 h under N2 atmosphere. The solid formed was filtered and sequentially washed with water and ethanol, and then dried under vacuum to give CuPor (or NiPor, ZnPor). Their UV-vis and FTIR spectra are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1 and S2). CuPor: yield: 100 mg, 93%. UV-vis: λmax(DMF)/nm: 417, 540. IR(KBr)/cm−1: 1698 (CO), 1000 (Cu–N). NiPor: yield: 99 mg, 93%. UV-vis: λmax(DMF)/nm: 416, 527. IR(KBr)/cm−1: 1691 (CO), 1005 (Ni–N). ZnPor: yield: 95 mg, 89%. UV-vis: λmax(DMF)/nm: 427, 695, 749. IR(KBr)/cm−1: 1681 (CO), 996 (Zn–N). 1HNMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): 8.80 (s, 8H); 8.36 (d, 8H); 8.31 (d, 8H) (Fig. S3†).
MPor–RuN3 COPs were prepared according to our previous method with slight modifications (Scheme 1).17 After cooling, 15 mL of diethyl ether was added to precipitate the solid, which was filtered and washed three times with DMF. The resultant products were purified by Soxhlet extraction using ethanol/ethyl acetate mixture (1:1, v/v) for 48 h and then dried at 80 °C under vacuum to give the final products.
2.2 Material characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ascend 400 spectro-photometer using deuterated solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as a reference. Solid-state 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectra were acquired on a Biorad FTS-165 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses were performed on a Mettler-Toledo Diamond thermal analyzer in the air. Crystal phases were analysed on a Bruker D8-Avance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using CuKα1 radiation operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with a scanning rate of 4° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscope with a standard and monochromatic source (AlKα) operated at 300 W and calibrated with C 1 s. UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) were recorded on a Shimadzu MPC-3100 using BaSO4 as a reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F-6800 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
Electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI750E electrochemistry workstation with a standard three-electrode cell, where Pt wire and saturated Ag/AgCl electrode (or Ag/AgNO3 electrode) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The internal electrolyte of the Ag/AgNO3 electrode was the AgNO3 anhydrous acetonitrile solution (10 mM). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), Mott–Schottky plots, and photocurrent response curves were measured using Na2SO4 solution (0.1 M) as the electrolyte, the reference electrode was a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode and the working electrode was fabricated by dropping Nafion solution containing the sample on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a [NBu4]ClO4 MeCN solution (0.1 M) using glassy carbon modified with the sample as the working electrode and Ag/AgNO3 electrode as the reference electrode corrected by ferrocene. All potentials were adjusted to a standard hydrogen electrode (NHE) using the formula of E(NHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + Eθ(Ag/AgCl).
2.3 Photocatalytic CO2RR performance
Photoreaction experiments were carried out in a homemade Pyrex glass reactor (90 mL) with a light window on the top. 3.0 mg of the photocatalyst and 5.0 mg of BIH were added to 10 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile, and then the mixture was transferred to the reactor after ultrasonic dispersion. After washing with pure CO2 (99.999%) five times by vacuuming and refilling, the sealed reactor was irradiated with a Xe-lamp (300 W) as the light source. The reaction temperature was maintained at ca. 30 °C by circulating cooling water. When cycle tests for CO2RR were carried out, the atmosphere of the reactor was replaced by fresh CO2 and the recovered sample was re-dispersed in fresh anhydrous acetonitrile containing 5.0 mg of BIH.
The reduced products (CO/CH4) were quantified using a Rainbow SP-7820 gas chromatograph equipped with an FID detector, the other possible reduced ones (H2 and methanol) were measured using a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph with a BID detector. Formic acid and formaldehyde were detected from 1H NMR spectra using deuterated solvent and TMS as a reference.
2.4 Computational methods
All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the DMol3 module of BIOVIA Materials Studio 2017 (17.2). The initial crystal structures were built with the Materials Visualizer interface of BIOVIA Materials Studio 2017 (17.2) on the basis of the previously optimized crystal of the CuPor–RuN3 polymer.24 These structures were then optimized keeping the cell unit fixed using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Grimme's default DFT-D parameters. The double-numeric with polarization functions basis set (DNP) was chosen while the core electrons were treated using effective core potentials (ECP). The optimized crystals were with P1 space groups with a = b = 34.9336 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, and c axis was set to 20 Å to avoid interactions between layers. The convergence criteria for structure optimization were set to (a) SCF tolerance of 1 × 10−5 hartree, (b) energy tolerance of 2 × 10−5 hartree, (c) maximum force tolerance of 2 × 10−3 Hartree/Å; and (d) maximum displacement tolerance of 5 × 10−3 Å, (e) thermal smearing of 0.010 Ha, (f) Monkhorst–Pack grid k-points of 1 × 1 × 1.27–30
Based on the optimized crystal structures, adsorption energies and electron properties were performed with a similar setting as that used in the optimization. The adsorption energy  was calculated from the equation  = ECP+ad − ECP − Ead, where ECP+ad, ECP, and Ead are the total energy of the coordination polymer (CP) and the adsorbate, the energy of the CP, and the energy of the adsorbate, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Polymer structural characterization
The isostructural MPor–RuN3 COPs (M = Co, Ni, Cu or Zn) were synthesized using 2,6-bis(5-amino-benzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine Ru(II) pincer complex (RuN3) and metal(II) meso-tetrakis(4-carboxy-phenyl)porphyrin (MPor) as monomers via an amidating condensation reaction (Scheme 1). Their chemical compositions and structures were characterized by FT-IR spectra, XRD patterns and solid-state 13C NMR spectra, TG analyses, and elemental analyses (Fig. S4, S5, and Table S1†).17 Choosing CuPor–RuN3 COP as an example to compare with its monomers, its FT-IR spectrum (Fig. S4a†) showed three obviously weakened IR bands for the H-bonded N–H group at ∼3206 cm−1, the C–N bond of phenylamino at ∼1291 cm−1, and the out-of-bending of –NH2 at ∼870 cm−1 compared to the RuN3 monomer.31–37 It suggests that the –NH2 groups in the RuN3 monomer were involved in the resultant polymer. Compared with CuPor monomer, in CuPor–RuN3 COP, the IR bands for –COOH at 2498–3000 cm−1 (O–H) and ∼1312 cm−1 (C–O) were reduced significantly, and the IR band of CO in COOH at ∼1682 cm−1 shifted to ∼1659 cm−1, which can be assigned to the CO of amide (HN–CO).35,37 Moreover, CuPor–RuN3 COP delivered two new IR bands at ∼1540 and ∼1345 cm−1, which can be assigned to the stretching vibrations of N–H and C–N bonds in amide (HN–CO),37–39 respectively.
The above results imply the formation of an amide group through the condensation of carboxyl groups of CuPor and amino groups of RuN3. In addition, the IR band of CN in acetonitrile for CuPor–RuN3 COP appears at ∼1960 cm−1, downshifting ∼300 cm−1 compared to the RuN3 monomer (at 2269 cm−1), which is probably due to the large π-back donating from the conjugated aryl system upon polymerization to the CN bond of the acetonitrile ligand.17,31–34 Similar IR band shifts for the CO bond of the MPor monomer and CN bond in the RuN3 monomer were found in the FT-IR spectra of those metalloporphyrin-based COPs (Fig. 1a), indicating all MPor–RuN3 COPs were synthesized successfully, and the acetonitrile ligands were still coordinated with Ru centers.
 Fig. 1  (a) FT-IR spectra of MPor–RuN3 and H2Por–RuN3 COPs. (b) Solid-state 13C NMR spectra of the H2Por monomer and H2Por–RuN3 COP. 
Solid-state 13C NMR spectra (Fig. 1b) were obtained to further confirm the polyamidation between MPor and RuN3 monomers. The H2Por monomer showed two 13C NMR signals at 173.0 and 170.2 ppm ascribable to the C-atoms of –COOH, implying that the four –COOH groups are not magnetically equivalent, probably ascribable to the protons migrating toward the N-atoms of the porphyrin ring. H2Por–RuN3 COP showed a 13C NMR signal at 27.2 ppm attributable to the methyl C-atoms of the coordinated acetonitrile, indicating that there existed strong π-back donating between the RuN3 unit and acetonitrile ligand.40,41 Besides, H2Por–RuN3 COP delivered a new broad and weak signal centered at 168.9 ppm ascribable to the carbonyl C-atoms of the amide group, further confirming the formation of the amide linkage.42 Meanwhile, H2Por–RuN3 COP also displayed wider bands in the range of 108–152 ppm than in the H2Por monomer, which could be due to the low crystallinity of those polymers, as validated from the XRD patterns (Fig. S4b†).
The measured values of C, N, H, and M elements in the MPor–RuN3 COPs are close to their respective theoretical values (Table S1†). For example, the determined values of 3.11% and 9.72% for Cu and Ru in CuPor–RuN3 COP were similar to the theoretical values of 3.20% and 10.20%, respectively. TG curves obtained in the air (Fig. S5†) indicate that the metal-free porphyrin-based COP (H2Por–RuN3) starts to lose weight, obviously, when the temperature is higher than 150 °C, while those metalloporphyrin-based COPs are thermally stable at least up to 200 °C, indicating that the coordinated metal ions in porphyrins can improve the thermal stability. The 1.3–4.2% weight loss before 150/200 °C for those COPs can be attributed to the loss of physically adsorbed water, and the mass loss after 150/200 °C can be due to the framework decomposition to produce corresponding metallic oxides, the weights of which are very close to their respective theoretical values (Fig. S5†). For example, the final residue in CuPor–RuN3 COP can be ascribed to RuO2 and CuO with a remaining weight percentage of 16.9%, very similar to the theoretical value (17.6%) calculated according to the formula shown in Table S1.† These results suggest the successful formation of MPor–RuN3 COPs with high purity.
The survey X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, Fig. S6†) also confirmed the existence of Co/Ni/Cu/Zn, Ru, C, N, O, and Cl in those MPor–RuN3 COPs. The high-resolution M 2p/3p XPS spectra (Fig. 2) for the MPor–RuN3 COPs and their monomers (MPor and RuN3) indicate that these metal centers in porphyrin units are mainly M2+ species except that a small fraction of Cu ions are Cu+ in the CuPor monomer and CuPor–RuN3 COP.43,44 The presence of Cu+ indicates that it is easier for Cu2+ ions to obtain electrons than the other M2+ ions. As shown in Fig. 2a, the CuPor monomer exhibits two groups of Cu 2p binding energy (BE) peaks at 934.77/954.56 eV and 932.67/952.40 eV, which can be assigned to Cu2+ and Cu+ species,43–45 respectively. After the polymerization with the RuN3 monomer, the BE values of Cu2+ 2p3/2 and Cu+ 2p3/2 decreased by ∼0.18 and ∼0.07 eV, respectively. Moreover, the Cu+ species in the Cu ions for the CuPor–RuN3 COP increased from ∼17% (in CuPor) to ∼20%. These results indicate that some Cu2+ ions can be reduced to Cu+ species, which strongly confirms that the Cu ions in the porphyrin unit can gain electrons. Nevertheless, the other M2+ ions showed no obvious change in valence. As depicted in Fig. 2b, CoPor monomer and CoPor–RuN3 COP show two Co 2p BE peaks at 780.84/795.99 eV and 780.51/795.48 eV, which can be attributed to Co2+ 2p3/2/Co2+ 2p1/2 in the monomer and polymer, respectively. The shakeup satellites at ∼786/∼802 eV are the typical features of the material with d9 configuration in the ground state.45 The BE peak of Co2+ 2p3/2 for CoPor monomer is 0.33 eV higher than that of CoPor–RuN3 COP, indicating that the electron cloud density on Co2+ ions in the CoPor unit increases after the polymerization with the RuN3 monomer. Similarly, the polymerization with the RuN3 monomer makes the BE values of both Ni2+ 2p3/2 of NiPor and Zn2+ 2p3/2 of ZnPor decrease by 0.11 eV (Fig. 2c and d). These results demonstrate that those central metal ions in the porphyrin units can obtain electrons after the polymerization with RuN3 monomer, which is in line with the previous report.
 Fig. 2  High-resolution XPS spectra of the MPor–RuN3 COPs and their respective monomers. (a) Cu 2p, (b) Co 2p, (c) Ni 2p, (d) Zn 2p, and (e and f) Ru 3p. 
The high-resolution Ru 3p XPS spectra (Fig. 2e and f) show that the RuN3 monomer has two BE peaks at 462.17 and 484.31 eV, belonging to the Ru2+ 3p3/2 and Ru2+ 3p3/2,46,47 respectively. After the polymerization, the BE value of Ru2+ 3p3/2 was increased by ca. 0.87 eV to 463.04 eV. When the metal-free H2Por was replaced by CoPor, NiPor, CuPor or ZnPor to react with RuN3, the BE values of Ru2+ 3p3/2 became 0.67, 0.83, 0.73, or 0.47 eV, respectively. It suggests that the electron-capturing ability has an order of NiPor > CuPor > CoPor ≫ ZnPor, which coincides with the order of electronegativity of these transition metals: Ni (1.91) > Cu (1.90) > Co (1.88) ≫ Zn (1.65).48 These results indicate that the Ru2+ ions in the RuN3 units lose the electrons after the reaction with porphyrin, and the decrease of electron cloud density on Ru2+ ions is positively correlated with the electronegativity of the metal center in the porphyrin units. That is, some electrons can be transferred from the Ru2+ sites of the RuN3 unit to the metal center of the porphyrin unit in those COPs, whereby the energy level of porphyrin bends downward and that of RuN3 bends upward, which facilitates the molecular heterojunction formation between the porphyrin units and the RuN3 units and the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers.17
3.2 Optical and electronic band structure analyses
MPor monomers in DMF solution show strong B-band absorption in the range of 360–450 nm due to the electronic transition of the porphyrin ring from the ground state (S0) to the higher-lying excited state (S2),49,50 and their maximum B-band absorption wavelengths follow an order of NiPor (415 nm) < CuPor = CoPor (417 nm) < H2Por (420 nm) < ZnPor (427 nm) (Fig. S1, Table S2†), which is also the order of the electron cloud density in their porphyrin rings. Besides, H2Por shows four weak Q-band absorption peaks at 515, 549, 591, and 646 nm due to the electron transition from S0 to the lower-lying excited state (S1). The corresponding MPor displays a reduced number of Q-band absorption peaks, which can be due to the increased molecular symmetry and molecular orbitals' degeneracy.51 Especially, NiPor showed the shortest Q-band absorption wavelength at 527 nm, while ZnPor has the longest one at 559 nm. These characteristic absorption peaks indicate that ZnPor is easier to promote the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), while CoPor, NiPor, and CuPor tend to appear as the outcome of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) due to the existence of the single electron in Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+.49 The above variable absorption spectra and charge transfer processes dependent on the metal centers are favorable and significant for adjusting the spectral responsive region of the resultant MPor–RuN3 COPs.
UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS, Fig. 3a) indicate that the MPor–RuN3 COPs have broad absorption in the visible-near-infrared (NIR) region with inconspicuous B-band and red-shifted Q-band absorption peaks compared with the corresponding MPor monomers (Table S2†), suggesting that the electron density on porphyrin units is increased after the polymerization with RuN3,49 which is consistent with the above XPS analytic results. In contrast to the MPor monomers, the Q-band absorptions of those COPs are obviously enhanced, implying that the S0 → S1 transition is more likely to occur than the S0 → S2 transition for the MPor unit owing to its greater electron delocalization in the COPs.17,50 After the polymerization, the intensity difference among the different Q-band peaks of COPs shrinks, and ZnPor–RuN3 COP showed four obvious Q-band peaks, suggesting that the decreased symmetry and molecular orbital degeneracy of MPor units, which may be due to the presence of more axial coordination at the metal center of the porphyrin units in the polymer.51
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (DRS) of the MPor–RuN3 COPs. (b) The related (αhν)2/(αhν)1/2vs. hν plots derived from the corresponding DRS spectrum of the CuPor–RuN3 COP. (c) Mott–Schottky plots of the CuPor–RuN3 COP. (d) Energy band structures of the MPor–RuN3 COPs. 
The energy band structures of MPor–RuN3 COPs were measured using Tauc and Mott–Schottky plots, from which it was found that it is more reasonable to calculate the band gaps (Eg) with the (αhν)2vs. hν plots (Fig. S7†), and those COPs have an n-type semiconducting feature (Fig. S8†). Choosing CuPor–RuN3 COP as an example, the Tauc plots (Fig. 3b), derived from the corresponding DRS spectrum according to the Q-band absorption, show that the CuPor–RuN3 COP has an Eg of 1.69 eV, and the Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 3c) show that CuPor–RuN3 COP has a flat potential (Efb) of −0.32 V (vs. NHE, the same below). Since the conduction band bottom (ECB) of an n-type semiconductor is more negative 0.1 eV than its Efb,52,53 while the valance band top (EVB) can be calculated through the equation of Eg = EVB − ECB, the EVB and ECB of CuPor–RuN3 COP can be calculated as 1.27 and −0.42 V, respectively. Similarly, CoPor–RuN3, NiPor–RuN3, ZnPor–RuN3, or H2Por–RuN3 COP have Eg values of 1.58, 1.64, 1.60, or 1.28 eV (Fig. S7†), respectively. From those Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S8†), it can be calculated that CoPor–RuN3, NiPor–RuN3, ZnPor–RuN3, or H2Por–RuN3 COP have Efb values of −0.29, −0.31, −0.28, or −0.41 V, respectively. Correspondingly, the energy band structures of those COPs can be drawn as shown in Fig. 3d.
Through cyclic voltammetry (CV), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of MPor–RuN3 COPs are also calculated according to EHOMO = EOX (vs. Ag/Ag+) − E1/2(Fc+/Fc vs. Ag/Ag+) + E1/2(Fc+/Fc vs. NHE) (Fig. S9†).53 Those EHOMO levels are very close to the above-calculated EVB values, and the EVB of H2Por–RuN3 COP is obviously more negative than that of the metalloporphyrin-based COPs (Table S3†). This suggests that the oxidation capacity of photoinduced holes in the former is obviously weaker than that in the latter. That is, the porphyrin metal center can help to strengthen the oxidation capacity of holes in the COPs. Their EVB levels follow the order of CuPor–RuN3 > NiPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 > CoPor–RuN3 ≫ H2Por–RuN3, indicating that the oxidation capability of holes in those COPs might follow the same order. The holes with strong oxidation capacity can promote the occurrence of oxidation half-reaction, and then facilitate the total photocatalytic CO2RR process. Although those metalloporphyrin-based COPs have more positive ECB than H2Por–RuN3 COP, all of them possess a more negative ECB than the CO2/CO redox potential, and thus those COPs can realize the reduction of CO2 to CO thermodynamically.52
3.3 Photocatalytic CO2RR performance
The photocatalytic CO2RR performance of MPor–RuN3 COPs was initially determined under visible light (λ ≥ 400 nm) irradiation. After the optimization of the photoreaction conditions with CuPor–RuN3 COP as the photocatalyst, it was found that acetonitrile (MeCN) and BIH are the most suitable solvent and sacrificial electron donor (SED) for the CO2RR photoreaction system (Fig. S10†), respectively. No H2, CH4, HCOO− or CH3OH was detected from the photoreaction system, and all COPs exhibit no obvious CO when CO2 was replaced by N2, suggesting that the CO produced during the photocatalytic process originated from CO2 rather than the organic impurity. The control experiments confirmed that the light illumination, CO2, BIH, and MPor–RuN3 COPs are indispensable for effective CO generation (Fig. 4a), proving that CO really came from the photocatalytic CO2RR. Under visible light illumination, those COPs showed different CO yields following the order of CuPor–RuN3 (74.3 μmol g−1 h−1) > NiPor–RuN3 (60.4 μmol g−1 h−1) > ZnPor–RuN3 (36.6 μmol g−1 h−1) > CoPor–RuN3 (31.1 μmol g−1 h−1) > H2Por–RuN3 (15.7 μmol g−1 h−1).

(d) Time courses of CO evolution amount of the CuPor–RuN3 COP under visible light irradiation for 20 h. 
The CO2RR activities of those COPs under Xe-lamp full spectrum illumination show the same order as that under visible light illumination with CO being the only product (Fig. 4b). Especially, the activity of H2Por–RuN3 COP was obviously worse than that of metalloporphyrin-based COPs under both visible and full light illuminations (Fig. 4a and b), indicating that the metal centers of porphyrin units play an important role during the CO2RR process, which is in line with a previous report,17 whereby, the Co center in the porphyrin unit was proved to be the oxidation site to react with BIH, while the Ru center in the RuN3 unit is the reduction site to reduce CO2. Especially, CuPor–RuN3 COP delivered a CO yield of up to 74.3 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation, which was 4.7 times higher than that of the metal-free control (H2Por–RuN3, 15.7 μmol g−1 h−1). Similarly, CuPor–RuN3 COP attained the highest CO yield of 143.7 μmol g−1 h−1 under Xe-lamp full spectrum illumination, 4.4 times that of H2Por–RuN3 COP (32.7 μmol g−1 h−1).
The above different activities show that the metal centers in porphyrin units can regulate the CO2RR activity of the porphyrin-based COPs, and MPor–RuN3 COPs exhibit excellent selectivity for CO, in line with the previous report on photocatalytic CO2RR with BIH as SED.54 Besides, the activity, and selectivity for CO of CuPor–RuN3 COP exceed that of most of the previously-reported polymer-, MOF-, or COF-based photocatalysts without external photosensitizers (Table S4†). This indicates that the present metalloporphyrin-based COPs have great potential in the field of photocatalytic CO2RR.
The activity of CuPor–RuN3 COP gradually decreases along with the shrinking of the wavelength range (Fig. 4c), also indicating that the CO is produced from the photocatalytic CO2RR process. Although the DRS spectrum shows that CuPor–RuN3 COP can absorb the photons at 300–1400 nm (Fig. 3a), its CO yield under λ ≥ 660 nm light illumination is only 3.5 μmol g−1 h−1, suggesting that the photons that can be converted into chemical energy are mainly concentrated in the UV-vis region. It should be noted that when the wavelength range is changed from λ ≥ 600 nm to λ ≥ 660 nm, the CO yield decreases by 71% (from 12.1 to 3.5 μmol g−1 h−1). This suggests that the photons with wavelengths longer than the Q-band absorption of CuPor–RuN3 COP (594 nm, Table S2†) cannot be used to reduce CO2 because the CuPor unit cannot be excited.
The stability of CuPor–RuN3 COP was further investigated by four consecutive cycles of photocatalytic CO2RR testing with each cycle of 5 h. As shown in Fig. 4d, it can be found that only 8.6% deactivation was observed after 20 h irradiation, indicating that the COP has excellent stability. The FI-IR spectrum of CuPor–RuN3 COP after the cycling test showed no obvious difference from the original one, indicating that the structure of the polymer did not change after the 20 h photoreaction (Fig. S11†). Besides, the high-resolution XPS spectra of the recovered CuPor–RuN3 COP were also very similar to those of the fresh one (Fig. S12†), further demonstrating the potential of COPs in the long-term photocatalytic application. What is more, there was little difference between C 1s/N 1s XPS spectra of the fresh and recovered CuPor–RuN3 COP (Fig. S12a and b†), but their high-resolution Cu 2p/Ru 3p XPS spectra showed some differences (Fig. S12c and d†). The BE value of Cu2+ 2p3/2 decreased by 0.09 eV, while the proportion of Cu+ increased from 20% to 34% after the long-term photoreaction. The BE values of Ru2+ 3d5/2 and Ru2+ 3p3/2 for CuPor–RuN3 COP decreased by 0.17 and 0.07 eV after the long-term photoreaction (Fig. S12a and d†), respectively. This can be because the Cu ions in the porphyrin units were obtaining the electrons from BIH and then transferring them to Ru2+ sites for CO2RR.17
3.4 Photocatalytic CO2RR mechanism
Generally, the difference in CO2RR performance among the MPor–RuN3 COPs can be ascribed to the variable electron transfer ability of the metal centers in the porphyrin units, and thus their photocurrent–time curves were measured under visible light (λ ≥ 400 nm) illumination. As seen in Fig. 5a, the photocurrents follow the order of NiPor–RuN3 > CuPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 ≫ CoPor–RuN3 > H2Por–RuN3, implying that NiPor–RuN3 COP may provide the most excited electrons for the CO2RR, while H2Por–RuN3 COP delivers the smallest current. From the Nyquist plots (Fig. 5b) of the EIS spectra, it can be found that the charge transfer resistances (Rct) of those COPs follow an order opposite to the photocurrents, implying that the metal centers in the porphyrin units can promote the electron delocalization and the photoinduced charge transfer,52 and different metal ions in the porphyrin units can enhance the charge transfer efficiency to different degrees, which follows the order of NiPor–RuN3 > CuPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 ≫ CoPor–RuN3 > H2Por–RuN3. Besides, the PL spectra (Fig. 5c) show the fluorescence intensity following the same order, further confirming the order of charge separation efficiency in those COPs.

The photoactivity of those COPs follows a similar order of CuPor–RuN3 > NiPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 > CoPor–RuN3 > H2Por–RuN3 (Fig. 4a and b), suggesting that the introduction of different metal ions into the porphyrin units can influence the activity of the COPs in different degrees by altering the charge separation efficiency. Nevertheless, the order of charge transfer is slightly different from the order of the CO2RR activity as shown in Fig. 4a (that is, CuPor–RuN3 COP has better activity than NiPor–RuN3 COP), implying that there are other factors affecting the CO2RR activity besides the charge transfer/separation efficiency. In a previous report on CoPor–RuN3 COP,17 it was proved that the CoPor units served as oxidation sites to gain electrons from BIH, while the RuN3 units are the active sites to reduce CO2 when CoPor–RuN3 COP was used as the photocatalyst and BIH as the SED. Therefore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of MPor monomers were further estimated through spectroscopic and CV methods (Fig. S13, S14 and Table S5†). The energy levels of the molecular junctions formed at the adjacent units in MPor–RuN3 COPs are shown in Fig. 5d, and the internal Z-scheme electron transfer in the molecular junctions can be obtained because the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction half-reaction of CO2RR occur in MPor units and RuN3 units. Under light irradiation, the electrons of both MPor and RuN3 units are excited from the HOMO to LUMO, and the energy band bending can improve the recombination of photoinduced electrons of MPor units and holes of the RuN3 units, which allows the MPor units to retain stronger oxidizing holes in the HOMO to oxidize BIH and the RuN3 units to retain stronger reducing electrons in the LUMO to reduce CO2.
The above conjecture can also be confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results. The HOMOs of CoPor–RuN3, NiPor–RuN3, CuPor–RuN3, and ZnPor–RuN3 COPs are mainly contributed by the MPor units, while the LUMO electrons are largely delocalized over the RuN3 units (Fig. 6). This indicates that the charge transfer from MPor units to the RuN3 units would occur during the photoexcitation process, which would help the electrons to gather on the Ru sites of RuN3 units to reduce CO2, and the holes on the M sites of MPor units to react with BIH. The adsorption energy change (ΔE*) between the reactants/products and the different units of those COPs were further calculated and summarised in Table 1. As seen, ΔE* values between BIH and MPor units are −0.87–−0.89 eV, while those between BIH and RuN3 units are 0.19 eV for those COPs, indicating that BIH is more likely to react with the MPor units rather than with the RuN3 units during the photocatalytic CO2RR process, and different MPor units have slightly different adsorption capacities for BIH. Similarly, the ΔE* values between CO2 and RuN3 units in COPs are −0.30 eV, more negative than that between CO2 and MPor units, indicating that the Ru sites are the active sites for CO2 reduction, and the RuN3 units in those COPs have the same adsorption capacities for CO2.

In addition, both, the ΔE* values between the CO molecule and Ru2+ sites of COPs are −2.49 eV, indicating that the MPor's metal center has little effect on the desorption process of the reduced product (CO) from the Ru2+ sites. However, the ΔE* values between BI˙ (the product of BIH losing hydrogen)54 and MPor units of COPs are different, demonstrating that the difference in metal centers in MPor units can influence the desorption process of BI˙, which can further influence the oxidation half-reaction rate. Therefore, it can be concluded that the metal centers in MPor units and the Ru2+ ions in the RuN3 units are the oxidation and reduction active sites during the CO2RR process, respectively. Although the change of MPor's metal centers in COPs will not affect the adsorption/desorption process of the reduction half-reaction that occurred on RuN3 units, it will affect the adsorption/desorption process of the oxidation half-reaction occurring on MPor units, and thus affecting the total activity of CO2RR.
To further verify the above conjecture, the reaction rates of different MPor–RuN3 COPs with BIH were explored. Because the oxidation of BIH with a characteristic absorption peak at 313 nm to BI+ in air can be catalyzed by MPor–RuN3 COPs,17,55 the decrease in the rate of absorbance at 313 nm of the BIH solution can represent the the reaction rate between COPs and BIH. Therefore, the COPs were added to a BIH MeCN solution (0.05 g L−1) and after illumination by visible light for 20 min at 25 °C, and UV-vis absorption spectra of the supernatant were recorded every 5 min (Fig. 7a and S15†) and the change in absorbance at 313 nm over time is shown in Fig. 7b. It can be found that both of absorbances at 313 nm decreased linearly with the extension of illumination time, and the slope of fitting lines with different COPs, as photocatalysts follow the order, CuPor–RuN3 > NiPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 > CoPor–RuN3 > H2Por–RuN3, indicating that the ability of COPs to catalyze BIH oxidation follows this order, which is also consistent with the above order for the CO2RR activity (Fig. 3a and b). This demonstrates that the metal centers in the porphyrin units can effectively regulate the ability of MPor–RuN3 COPs to oxidize BIH, which further affects the total CO2RR activity of those COPs. Therefore, although the charge separation efficiency of NiPor–RuN3 COP is better than CuPor–RuN3 COP, the latter shows better CO2RR activity than the former owing to its stronger oxidation capacity for BIH. This result demonstrates that the rarely discussed oxidation half-reaction actually has a significant effect on photocatalytic CO2RR activity.56
 Fig. 7  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra of the supernatant of the CuPor–RuN3 COP-containing BIH MeCN solution (0.05 g L−1) after various visible light illumination periods at 25 °C, and (b) the change trending of absorbance at 313 nm of the supernatant along with the illumination time of various MPor–RuN3 COPs. 
The high-resolution XPS spectra of M/Ru centers in those COPs under 15 min light illumination were detected to further explore the difference in the oxidation half-reaction of various MPor–RuN3 COPs. It was found that the light illumination leads to the BE values of M 2p3/2 for the M centers of MPor units (M = Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) in the COPs changed compared with that of the COPs in dark (Fig. 8). This demonstrates that the electron cloud density of M ions in those COPs was rearranged after the photoexcitation. For instance, the illumination can cause the BE values of Co2+ 2p3/2 and Zn2+ 2p3/2 to increase by 0.05 eV and 0.06 eV (Fig. 8a and b), respectively. This indicates that the Co2+ and Zn2+ ions could lose electrons. While the BE values of Ni2+ 2p3/2 decreased by 0.08 eV (Fig. 8c), and the proportion of Cu+ increased from 20% to 30% with a slight decrease (0.02 eV) of the BE value of Cu2+ 2p3/2 (Fig. 8d), indicating that Cu2+ and Ni2+ can gain electrons during the photoexcitation. From the change degree of BE values of metal ions after the illumination, it can be inferred that the order of binding ability of MPor's metal center to outer electrons is Cu2+ > Ni2+ > Zn2+ ≈ Co2+, in line with the order of MPor–RuN3 COPs' ability to oxidize BIH, as mentioned above. In addition, the stronger the electron-gathering ability of the MPor metal center in COP, the stronger is the ability of COP to oxidize BIH, proving that the MPor metal centers in the COPs are the oxidation sites of BIH.

Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that the photoinduced electrons of MPor–RuN3 COP are enriched in the RuN3 unit to reduce CO2 molecules adsorbed on the Ru sites. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes are concentrated on MPor units for oxidizing BIH. The MPor–RuN3 COPs show the charge separation efficiency following an order of NiPor–RuN3 > CuPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 > CoPor–RuN3 > H2Por–RuN3, and the great charge separation efficiency can promote the CO2RR process. Besides, the oxidation capacity of the COPs for BIH follows an order of CuPor–RuN3 > NiPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 > CoPor–RuN3 > H2Por–RuN3, and the strong oxidation capacity can improve the total CO2RR rate by promoting its oxidation half-reaction. Under the combined action of the two factors, those COPs show the final activity sequence of CuPor–RuN3 > NiPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 > CoPor–RuN3 > H2Por–RuN3, indicating that the influence of the oxidation capacity of the COPs for SED on the CO2RR activity even exceeds the influence of charge separation efficiency.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a series of MPor–RuN3 COPs were synthesized by the polymerization of the metalloporphyrin monomer and Ru pincer complex and used as photocatalysts for CO2RR with BIH as the SED to explore the structure–activity relationship of porphyrin-based polymer photocatalysts from a molecular level. The experimental results showed that the photophysical and electronic properties of the COPs can be adjusted by using porphyrin monomers with different transition metal centers. The photocatalytic CO2RR activity of the COPs follows the order CuPor–RuN3 > NiPor–RuN3 > ZnPor–RuN3 > CoPor–RuN3 > H2Por–RuN3. Especially, CuPor–RuN3 COP showed the best CO production activity under both visible light (74.3 μmol h−1 g−1) and full spectrum light (143.7 μmol h−1 g−1) illuminations, 4.7 and 4.4 times that of H2Por–RuN3 COP under the same conditions, respectively. The experimental results and theoretic calculations demonstrate that the Z-scheme carrier migration exists in the molecular junctions of metalloporphyrin-based COPs during the photocatalytic process, and varying the metal centers in porphyrin units can affect the charge separation efficiency and the BIH oxidation dynamics in the MPor–RuN3 COPs. Both of them then jointly contributed to the significantly-improved CO2RR activity of the CuPor–RuN3 COP. In particular, the easily neglected oxidation half-reaction shows a great influence on the CO2RR activity. This work provides a simple and promising strategy for the finer design of efficient porphyrin-based polymer photocatalysts at the molecular level in the future, and the in-depth mechanism study provides valuable insights for the fabrication of highly efficient CO2RR systems.
