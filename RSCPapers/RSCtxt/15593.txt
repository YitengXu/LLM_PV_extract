    , Accepted 1st April 2020First published on 3rd April 2020AbstractThe electron-donating strengths of donor (D) moieties in thirteen donor–π–acceptor systems (D1–π–A to D13–π–A wherein –π– and A represent butadiene and cyanoacrylic acid units, respectively) have been studied using B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The selected D moieties are encountered as a part of an organic sensitizer molecule in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. When the D moiety is joined with π–A, a certain amount of electron donation from D to A occurs leading to an increase in electron density at the A site of D–π–A compared to the A site of π–A. This electron reorganization is quantified in terms of a change in molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) minimum (ΔVmA) at the acceptor site, the CN group of the cyanoacrylic acid. The ΔVmA is always negative, in the range of −11.0 to −2.6 kcal mol−1 which provides a quick assessment of the rank order of the electron-donating nature of the D moieties in the ground state of D–π–A. The optical and photovoltaic properties of D and D–π–A systems are also determined at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level. An absorption red shift (Δλmax) in the range of 81–242 nm is observed when D moieties change to D–π–A systems. The ground state property ΔVmA showed a strong linear correlation with the excited state property Δλmax. Furthermore, ΔVmA is found to be proportional to the open-circuit voltage (VOC). The resemblance of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of the D–π–A system with the respective energies of donor and π–A systems shows that the donor tunes the HOMO, while π–A tunes the LUMO. Among the thirteen D–π–A systems, N,N-dialkylaniline, and julolidine are rated as the best donors for the photovoltaic applications. This study shows that the MESP based assessment of the donating strength of donor systems offers a powerful rational design strategy for the development of efficient dyes for DSSC applications.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been regarded as a highly potential alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells due to their high molar extinction coefficient, low production cost, simple synthetic strategy and easy structural modifications.1–5 DSSCs also perform relatively better than other traditional solar cells under diffuse light conditions and at higher temperatures.4–6 In DSSC applications, the sensitizers synthesized can be divided into two broad areas, viz. metal-based systems such as Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes, and Zn(II) porphyrins7 and the metal-free donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) type organic dyes.8 The Ru-based polypyridyl sensitizers attained the highest power conversion efficiency over 11% more than most of the metal-free sensitizers.9–14 This is due to the ability of metal sensitizers to absorb solar irradiation up to the near-infrared region, while other metal-free dye sensitizers are absorbed in the shorter wavelength region.8,13,15 So, a highly efficient sensitizer should have an absorption maximum near to the Vis-NIR region associated with a long-lived charge excited state.16,17 Due to the highly expensive and toxic synthetic procedures involved in metal sensitizers, the organic dyes exhibit remarkable importance in DSSC applications.8 Recent studies proposed important structural modifications in organic dyes18,19 to achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and over 12% has been achieved with a metal-free alkoxysilyl carbazole dye as a sensitizer.20 Yao et al. reported an improved PCE of 12.5% with a metal-free indenoperylene based D–π–A dye,21 the best-known metal-free organic dye. In 2017, a simple designing strategy over the phenothiazine moiety with ethynyl-pyrene enabled a PCE of 12%.22 The other recent milestones in DSSCs include co-sensitization, which enables higher photovoltaic performance over 14% with a collaborative sensitization by silyl and carboxy anchoring groups.23 Many studies proposed the structural modification of the donor group of the D–π–A dye to achieve higher efficiency as increasing the electron donating strength generally broadens and intensifies the region of absorption.24–26 In general, a dye sensitizer with a D–π–A framework can be modified at donor,27,28 spacer,29–32 and anchoring groups33–35 to improve the PCE. Typically, the acceptor portion (A) of the dye anchored onto the TiO2 semiconductor favours the charge transfer of the excited electrons to the conduction band of the semiconductor.36 The oxidized dye is then regenerated by the electron transfer from the electrolyte (I−/I3− couple), while the electrolyte couple regains the electron from the platinum counter electrode.4,37 Therefore, for an efficient dye sensitizer, an effective electron injection can occur from the dye to the TiO2 semiconductor if its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is observed at a level slightly below the redox couple of the I−/I3− electrolyte (−4.8 eV) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is observed above the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.0 eV).8,38,39
Apart from the simple D–π–A framework, several other configurations like D–D–π–A,40–42 D–A–π–A,43–46 D–π–A–A,47 (D–π–A)2,48 and double D–π–A bridges49 were also introduced and revealed that the introduction of additional donors, acceptors, and the extension of π conjugation reduces the HOMO–LUMO energy gap and redshifts the absorption maximum. In other words, for the improved PCE, the donor should be stable, and electron-rich for the effective electron injection to the TiO2 conduction band,28,50,51 thereby broadening their absorption to the Vis-NIR region.50,51 Therefore, for effective dye designing, it is very important to understand the electronic and photophysical properties of the dye systems.44 Density functional theory (DFT) and Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) can afford a more efficient approach to understand and predict these structural and electronic features without any time delay compared to the traditional trial and error methods.52–63 Previous studies have shown that the donor strength has a significant role in absorption maximum, the kinetics of electron injection and light-harvesting efficiency.64,65 Recently, the relevance of the theoretical estimation of donor strength in organic electronics has been explained by Köse.66
Thirteen typically used donor building blocks (Fig. 1) in the DSSC applications are selected for this DFT/TDDFT study (D1–D13).24,31,67–72 Among them, D1–D4 are aromatic hydrocarbon systems whereas the remaining donor moieties contain at least one lone pair bearing a nitrogen centre (D5–D13). The estimation of the donating strength is assessed by molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) topographical features of these donor molecules and their corresponding D–π–A systems. The MESP distribution is useful to understand the charge distribution within a molecule,73–76 and the regions with negative MESP values indicate electron-dense regions while positive-valued areas represent electron-deficient regions. The MESP based interpretation has been used for the study of substituent effects, intermolecular interactions, non-covalent interactions, hydrogen bonding, cation–π interactions, aromaticity and a variety of chemical phenomena.77–80 MESP analysis has been used in the field of organometallic chemistry for the quantification of the electron-donating strength of phosphine and N-heterocyclic ligands.73 The global minimum (Vmin) of MESP near the two electron donor atom (P or N) indicates the net donating ability of the ligand for making a coordination bond with a metal centre. Furthermore, Suresh and co-workers proved that MESP minimum (Vmin) analysis is very effective for the quantification of the inductive, resonance, steric and proximity effects of substituents.75,81–84 Recently the substituent effect transmitting power (γ) through various spacer units is also calculated via MESP analysis and showed that Vmin values are beneficial for the quantification of the transmission power of spacers.85 The study recommends the usage of short alkenyl systems as spacers for effective electronic transmission. Moreover, the above reliable studies confirmed that MESP is a powerful descriptor, capable of predicting the electronic properties of the molecular systems effectively. The present study focuses on the MESP analysis of D–π–A systems towards photovoltaic applications. The butadiene moiety (–HCCH–CHCH–) and the cyanoacrylic acid unit (–H2CC(CN)–COOH) are used as the π-spacer and anchoring (A) group, respectively.

Computational method
The ground state geometry optimization has been carried out using the B3LYP density functional theory (DFT) method86 with the cc-pVDZ basis set.87 This DFT method has been extensively used in the theoretical studies of organic dyes for dye-sensitized solar cell applications.45,60 Frequency calculations were also done at the same level of theory and confirmed that there were no imaginary frequencies. Vertical excitation energy calculations have been done for the first 7 states by using a long-range and solvation effect-corrected CAM-B3LYP/cc-pVDZ DFT method56 in dichloromethane. The reliability of this method has been checked by doing the computation on experimentally known systems (Fig. S1, ESI†) using three more methods, viz. B3LYP,86 PBE1PBE,88 and ωB97XD.89 For all these methods, the solvation effects are incorporated through the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) calculation implemented in the SMD (solvation model based on electron density) model.90 The TD-DFT calculations showed that the result given by CAM-B3LYP is the most reliable to reproduce the experimental absorption maximum (Table S1, ESI†). DFT and TD-DFT calculations are done using the Gaussian 16 program package.91 For quantifying the electron donating strength of donors in the D–π–A system, molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) analysis has been performed at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level. MESP, V(r) at point r in the vicinity of a molecular system in the atomic unit can be calculated from the electron density ρ(r′), using eqn (1) (1)where N is the total number of nuclei present in the molecular system, ZA is the charge on the nucleus A at a distance RA and r′ is a dummy integration variable.92,93
Results and discussion
MESP analysis of donor molecules
The MESP minima Vm are useful for locating the most electron-rich regions in the molecules. The Vm appears on the aromatic rings, hetero atoms and CC double bonds of donor molecules (D1–D13) which are shown in Fig. 2. Since all the systems contain at least one aromatic ring, the ring showing the most negative Vm (VmD) is taken for comparing the donor strength of each system. The VmD values of all the systems are depicted in Fig. 2 along with other Vm values. In polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) systems (D1–D3), VmD values lie in a small range of −14.4 to −14.9 kcal mol−1 which can be attributed to the similar π-conjugation features which are not affected by a hetero atom or a substituent. In the D4 system, two phenyl rings show a nearly coplanar arrangement with the CC double bond and their VmD (−16.1 and −16.8 kcal mol−1) values are more negative than a PAH while the third phenyl ring has a highly twisted arrangement with respect to the CC double bond and shows VmD −13.7 kcal mol−1. It appears that the presence of a conjugated CC bond in D4 enhances its electron density over the corresponding aromatic rings. In D5, three phenyl rings share the lone pair electron density from the nitrogen centre leading to a more negative character for VmD −15.6 kcal mol−1 than a PAH. In D6, D7 and D8, an amino nitrogen centre is connected with an arene ring. In the piperidine-phenyl system D6, the nitrogen centre is more pyramidalized than the other two and shows the least negative VmD (−21.6 kcal mol−1) among the three. In D7 and D8, fusing the N-alkyl unit/s with the aromatic ring improves the planarization of the N-centre, leading to more electron donation via +R effect to the arene ring. As a result, julolidine D8 shows the most electron-rich arene ring in terms of VmD −26.4 kcal mol−1 followed by D7 (−23.5 kcal mol−1). Compared to a PAH, carbazole arene rings show significantly more negative VmD (−19.5 kcal mol−1); here the sharing of the N-centre lone pair is with two aromatic rings which leads to less negative VmD than D6–D8. Similarly, in D10, the sharing of the N-lone pair with two arene rings can be seen in addition to the effect of the hetero S atom. In this case, VmD is less negative than carbazole. In D11, the combined effect of three N-centres can be attributed to the electron-rich nature of the arene ring (VmD −21.3 kcal mol−1) and among the N-centres, the N,N-dimethyl units are not fully effective for the influence of the +R contribution due to slight pyramidalization caused by steric congestions from the alkyl moiety of the adjacent five-membered ring. In D12, along with the +R contribution of N,N-dimethyl substituents, the conjugation effect of CC double bonds leads to relatively more electron-rich arene rings. The least negative VmD −11.0 kcal mol−1 is observed in D13, the coumarin system. Here, the presence of a highly electron-withdrawing carbonyl group at the heterocyclic ring reduces the electron density on the aromatic ring.

MESP analysis of D–π–A systems
The donating strength of donor fragments in the D–π–A system has been studied by MESP analysis. The MESP isosurface plot of a representative D–π–A system (D12) is shown in Fig. 3a along with MESP minimum (Vm) values at various positions. The positions selected for Vm analysis are (i) the donor site (VmD′), (ii) the spacer site nearer to the donor (VmS′) and (iii) the anchor site (VmA′). The π–A portion is built by linking a butadiene moiety (π-spacer) with the cyanoacrylic acid moiety (A). Since the π-spacer and anchor units are the same for all donors, they have been considered as a reference system and the corresponding MESP minimum at their spacer (VmS) and anchoring sites (VmA) are evaluated for comparison with those of the D–π–A system (Fig. 3b). The various MESP minimum values, viz. VmD′, VmS′, and VmA′ (Fig. S3, ESI†), are shown in Table 1 along with the most negative Vm of the donor molecule (VmD). In Table 1, the quantities ΔVmD, ΔVmS, and ΔVmA represent the change that occurrs in the minimum potential of the donor, spacer and anchoring sites with the introduction of the π–A system. Furthermore, in order to calculate ΔVmD, the most negative minima at the phenyl ring of each donor (VmD) have been subtracted from the corresponding minima (VmD′) of the D–π–A system. Similarly, ΔVmS and ΔVmA have been calculated by subtracting the Vm values at spacer and anchoring moieties of the reference system (VmS and VmA) from the corresponding minima (VmS′ and VmA′) of the D–π–A system.

From Table 1, it is clear that when a donor part is being attached with a π–A system, the minimum potential of the donor site (VmD′) becomes less negative indicating the electron transferring ability from the donor site to the π–A site. The term ΔVmD in Table 1 represents the change that occurred on the minimum potential at the donor site during the π–A linkage which varies from 5.1 to 16.4 kcal mol−1 and indicates the intramolecular charge transfer involved in the D–π–A system. Furthermore, at the spacer site of the D–π–A system, electron density gain is observed represented by negative ΔVmS which lies in the range of −0.9 to −10.5 kcal mol−1. On the basis of ΔVmS, the highest donating strength can be attributed to the D12, while the least donating strength can be assigned for PAHs.
The VmA′ values indicate that the minimum potential at the anchor moiety, for example at the cyano group, shows significant variations with respect to different donor units. The most electron-donating donor is expected to show the most negative VmA′. For the application of DSSCs, the cyanoacrylic portion has to be linked to the TiO2 semiconductor for efficient electron transfer. By making the anchoring group electron-rich, efficient electron transfer from the dye to TiO2 can occur. In other words, the efficiency of the DSSC system can be directly related to the electron-donating strength of the donor moieties. Due to this reason, the change in MESP minimum that appeared on the anchoring part (ΔVmA) has been considered as the donating strength of the donor moiety. The PAHs (D1–D3) showed the least negative value of ΔVmA (−2.7 to −3.8 kcal mol−1), indicating their poor electron-donating strength. Furthermore, in the D4 system, a similar donating strength of −3.8 kcal mol−1 is observed. In D5, the introduction of the N-centre imparts more negative ΔVmA values (−5.7 kcal mol−1) than PAHs which explains its better electron-donating strength compared to polyacenes. In D6 and D7, the more planarized nitrogen centres in the donor part impart a more negative ΔVmA value of −7.2 kcal mol−1 and suggests its higher electron-donating strength than D5. In the D8 system, the fused N-centre with the aromatic ring further improves its planarization and leads to more negative ΔVmA −9.2 kcal mol−1 than D5, D6, and D7. In carbazole (D9), the N-lone pair is shared between two aromatic rings through resonance, and as a result, the electron-donating strength in terms of ΔVmA (−4.5 kcal mol−1) appears weaker than those (D6–D8) having only one aromatic ring for sharing an N-lone pair. In D10, the presence of sulfur slightly enhances the negative value of ΔVmA to −5.0 kcal mol−1. Even though there are three nitrogen centres in ullazine, it shows a donating strength of −5.1 kcal mol−1 which can be attributed to the influence of pyramidalized N,N-dimethyl groups in ullazine. In D12, a more negative ΔVmA value of −11.0 kcal mol−1 can be recognized with the +R effect of mostly planarized N,N-dimethyl substituents. Finally, in D13 a more negative ΔVmA value (−6.2 kcal mol−1) than that of PAHs has been observed due to the interplay of the electron-rich nitrogen centre and the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. These results strongly suggest that the incorporation of an electron-rich heteroatom in the donor region can have a positive influence on the electronic transmission to the acceptor moiety. On the basis of ΔVmA, the order of the donating strength of donor groups can be written as D2 < D1 < D3 = D4 < D9 < D10 < D11 < D5 < D13 < D6 = D7 < D8 < D12. The julolidine based donor system D8 and the N,N-dialkyl aniline incorporated D12 are the most efficient among the studied systems.
Absorption spectra of donor and D–π–A systems
The absorption maxima of all the systems (donor and D–π–A) along with oscillator strength (f) are summarized in Table 2. For the assessment of the absorptional shift, Δλmax, the absorption maximum of the D–π–A system was subtracted from the donor system. For calculating Δλmax, HOMO → LUMO orbital transition has been considered, except for D1. In D1, λmax is observed for the HOMO−1 → LUMO transition, while its HOMO → LUMO transition is nearly forbidden due to very small f values. The data in Table 2 clearly suggest that the absorption maximum (λmax) of D–π–A shifts significantly to a higher wavelength region compared to donor D. Since in all systems we used the same spacer and anchoring moiety (the π–A unit), their influence on the absorptional shift (Δλmax) can be considered to be the same. This implies that the large variation in Δλmax exhibited by the D–π–A system is due to the variation in the donating strength of donor moieties. For instance, among all donor moieties, D1 with Δλmax 81 nm is the least donating while D12 with Δλmax 242 nm is the most donating (Table 2). Furthermore, ΔVmA with Δλmax with a correlation coefficient shows a linear correlation of 0.966 (Fig. 4) which shows the significance of the donating strength of ΔVmA on Δλmax. In the linear correlation plot, D1 and D11 based D–π–A systems exhibit a slight deviation, which can be attributed as their less intense (f → 0.02–0.03) and nearly forbidden HOMO → LUMO charge transfer character of the orbital excitation. From these results the shift in absorption maxima (Δλmax) follows the order D12 > D8 > D7 > D6 > D10 > D5 > D13 > D9 > D4 > D3 > D2 > D11 > D1, preferably due to the nature of donor groups. Therefore, to improve the wavelength of absorption to a preferred region (Vis to NIR), its donating ability has to be tuned with the introduction of better electron-donating donor groups (preferably more nitrogen centres).

 Fig. 4  Correlation between the donating strength (ΔVmA) of the D–π–A system and the change in absorption maxima (Δλmax). 
The frontier molecular orbital energy levels given in Fig. 5 show the HOMO–LUMO band gap features of D, D–π–A and π–A systems (butadiene moieties linked with cyano acrylic acid). The HOMO value (εh) of the D systems is in the range of −4.66 to −5.70 eV, whereas that of the D–π–A system is in the range of −4.96 to −5.89 eV. These data indicate the close resemblance of the HOMO level of the D and D–π–A systems. On the other hand, the LUMO energy level (εl) of D shows a large deviation from the εl of the D–π–A system indicating clear dissimilarity. In fact, εl of D–π–A in the range of −2.52 to −3.10 eV is very close to εl −2.97 eV observed for π–A. Thus, the data shown in Fig. 5 indicate that the HOMO of D–π–A is more like the HOMO of the donor and its LUMO is more like that of π–A. This feature is clearly evident in the frontier molecular orbital diagram given in the D–π–A system for representative cases (Fig. 6). HOMOs are more localized towards the donor region with decreasing orbital contributions from the π–A system, while the LUMO is mostly localized in the π–A region. D1–π–A is an exception wherein HOMO−1 to the LUMO is the allowed transition and its HOMO has a different π character, localized exclusively on the pyrene ring. The data shown in Fig. 5 clearly suggest that linking the donor system to the π–A unit is very effective for reducing the band gap. For all cases, the HOMO level is tuned towards the value of the I−/I3− electrolyte couple while the LUMO level appears closer to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. The HOMO and LUMO distribution and their energy levels suggest a significant charge separation in the excited state leading to the strong electron coupling of the dye with the TiO2 semiconductor which promotes the electron transfer to the conduction band.94

In general, compared to D systems, the absorption maxima of D–π–A systems show a significant red shift (Table 2) in the range of 81–242 nm. In D1–π–A and D2–π–A, λmax is observed at 401 and 409 nm, respectively. The major electronic excitation of pyrene incorporated D1–π–A is assigned to the transition of HOMO−1 to the LUMO. The forbidden HOMO to LUMO transition of D1–π–A can be changed to allow one by appropriate substitution such as a substitution by the methyl group at the first or second position (Table S2 and Fig. S2, ESI†). The D3–π–A system showed a broad absorption coverage in the visible region with λmax 518 nm corresponding to the HOMO–LUMO transition. Among all, D3–π–A has the lowest HOMO–LUMO band gap of 2.26 eV (Fig. 5). The D4 in D4–π–A is more electron-donating than a PAH moiety and it shows a smaller band gap of 2.71 eV compared to D1 to D2 incorporated systems. Furthermore, in nitrogen-containing D–π–A systems (D5–D13), the band gap energy decreases to a greater extent by 2.31–2.75 eV for all except D9–π–A (2.87 eV) than hydrocarbon systems. Among the nitrogen-containing systems, D12–π–A showed the highest λmax 520 nm with a band gap of 2.39 eV while D11–π–A showed the lowest band gap of 2.31 eV. The λmax value of D11–π–A observed at 411 nm is due to the transition of HOMO−1 to LUMO. Among them all, the HOMO energy level of D12–π–A appeared nearest to the energy level of the redox electrolyte while its LUMO level is 1.44 eV higher than the CB of TiO2. The LUMO energy levels of all systems offer a favourable electron injection from the excited state to the conduction band of TiO2 while HOMO energies lower than the oxidation potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte (−4.8 eV) indicate effective dye regeneration. These results support their effective utilization in the DSSC application. The D3–π–A, D11–π–A and D12–π–A systems are among the lowest band gap systems, desirable for harvesting more light in the UV-visible region.
Analysis of photovoltaic parameters
According to Koopman's theorem,95 the ground state oxidation potential (Edyeox) of a dye can be approximated as the negative HOMO energy (−εh). Furthermore, the excited state dye regeneration driving force (ΔGreg) can be approximated as (Edyeox − 4.8) eV or (−(εh) − 4.8) eV where −4.8 eV stands for the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte couple.22,96 The free energy change for electron injection (ΔGinject) from the excited state of the dye to the semiconductor53,97,98 is generally defined as, ΔGinject = Edyeox* − 4.0(2)where Edyeox* is the excited state oxidation potential and −4.0 eV stands for the conduction band (CB) edge of the TiO2 semiconductor.22,99 Assuming that the electron injection occurs from the unrelaxed excited state, Edyeox* can be explained as the difference between the ground state oxidation potential of the dye and the vertical transition energy λmax,96,97,100 Edyeox* = (−εh) − λmax(3)
Furthermore, the difference between the energy of the LUMO (εl) of the dye and the energy of the conduction band edge of TiO2 is regarded as the open circuit voltage (eqn (4)).100 eVOC = εl − (−4.0)(4)
In Table 3, the ΔGinject values fall in the range of −1.04 to −1.94 eV, and the D11–π–A system with the most negative value has the highest electron injection efficiency while D2 to D4 based D–π–A systems show the lowest efficiency. The smallest ΔGreg value of 0.16 eV is observed for D12–π–A and suggests its fastest dye regeneration efficiency. A good linear correlation between ΔVmA and eVOC is observed for all the cases (Fig. 7) suggesting that the electron accepting tendency of the acceptor part is well reflected at the LUMO levels. Among all the systems, julolidine based D8–π–A possesses the highest εl value resulting in the highest eVOC value of 1.48 eV. The second highest eVOC value of 1.44 eV is observed for D12–π–A. The ΔVmA values suggest that the electron donating ability of PAH moieties is the lowest among all the donors and the corresponding D1 to D3 based D–π–A systems show the lowest range of eVOC 0.90–1.01 eV.

Conclusions
Using MESP topographical analysis, the donating strength of thirteen known (D1–D13) typically used donor systems in the DSSC applications has been quantified. The red shift in the absorption maximum (Δλmax) observed for the D–π–A systems is rationalized in terms of the amount of electron donation from the donor D moieties to the π–A system using the MESP parameter ΔVmA. The highest electron donating strength ΔVmA observed in D12–π–A shows the highest Δλmax and maximum absorption wavelength λmax with a small band gap energy of 2.39 eV. In poor electron donating D1 and D2 based D–π–A systems, the smallest Δλmax and λmax values are observed. A linear correlation obtained between ΔVmA and Δλmax confirms that Δλmax increases with an increase in ΔVmA. The frontier molecular energy levels showed that the HOMO of the D–π–A system has a greater resemblance to the HOMO of the donor, whereas the LUMO has a greater resemblance to the LUMO of π–A. Thus, the donor tunes the HOMO, while π–A tunes the LUMO energy of the D–π–A system for efficient dye regeneration and electron injection. Among all the systems, D12–π–A showed the highest electron injection efficiency. Since eVOC is directly proportional to the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell, D8–π–A and D12–π–A having the highest eVOC can be regarded as the most efficient sensitizers for DSSCs while the lowest eVOC values displayed by the PAH based (D1–D3) D–π–A systems offer poor efficiency. The linear correlation between ΔVmA and eVOC shows that eVOC increases with an increase in the negative character of ΔVmA and also proves that better sensitizers can be developed by connecting a powerful electron donor to a π–A system. One way to do this is by incorporating multiple lone pair bearing nitrogen centres in donors. Thus, the MESP approach offers an easy analysis tool for the quantification of the donating strength of D–π–A systems in DSSC applications.
