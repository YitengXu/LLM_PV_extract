    , Accepted 20th April 2017First published on 21st April 2017AbstractSix new dyes based on phenothiazine conjugated to an ethynyl-pyrene moiety are synthesized and characterized. Dye-sensitized solar cells are fabricated using these dyes with and without a co-adsorbent, chenodeoxychloicacid. Simple molecular engineering around the phenothiazine moiety enabled a maximum of 12% photoconversion efficiency with one of the dyes.
Introduction
The field of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is an emerging area in harnessing light energy (photovoltaic technology). In DSSC, the light energy absorbed by the dye (functioning as a sensitizer) is converted into electrical energy. DSSCs with 10% efficiency, if installed over 0.1% of the earth's surface, would be sufficient to satisfy the present electrical energy requirements of the globe. The first work1 reported in DSSC involved the use of Ru(II) based dyes adsorbed on TiO2 (semiconductor) in conjunction with an iodide–triiodide electrolyte, with a photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.9% under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The most commonly reported metal based dyes used in DSSC are ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes2–6 and zinc(II)-porphyrins coupled with Co(II)/Co(III) redox shuttles.7 In spite of their higher efficiency, their usage is limited because of inadequate resources, low molar extinction coefficient and environmental concerns, thus paving the way for relatively inexpensive metal free organic dyes as potential alternatives in DSSCs.8
Several organic push–pull molecules, generally referred to as donor–pi–acceptor and represented as D–π–A, have also been reported as dyes in DSSCs. A number of donor (D) moieties such as N,N′-dimethylaniline, coumarins, tetrahydroquinolines, pyrollidine, carbazole, diphenylamine, phenothiazine and triphenylamine have been investigated. Two pioneering reviews summarize the continuing efforts in this area.1,8 The typical acceptor (A) groups reported are cyanoacrylic acid, carboxylic acid and rodhanine-3-acetic acid. Purely organic dyes (metal free) and especially push–pull molecules have been shown to deliver an efficiency of over 9%.9 The most attractive features of these organic dyes are their ease of synthesis and purification, abundant scope for tailoring the light absorption capacity, besides their being relatively inexpensive in comparison to inorganic/organometallic dyes. However, their lower photon to current conversion efficiency (PCE) as well as their long term stability are important issues that remain to be addressed.8,10,11
Panchromatic sensitizers with or without co-adsorbents are reported to result in a comparatively higher PCE. The achievement of panchromatic (sensitive to the entire visible region) light response in DSSCs relies on co-sensitization, energy-relay strategies or tandem device configurations.7 The design and molecular engineering of a panchromatic single molecular dye sensitizer offering a higher PCE under standard device fabrication protocols turned out to be the next challenge to conquer. A zinc(II) based porphyrin single molecule panchromatic sensitizer was reported with 13% PCE.12 The best known PCE for pure organic dyes is ∼12.5%.13
A few of the other recent milestones in DSSCs include the use of a co-sensitizer (a higher efficiency of 14% (ref. 14) was achieved) and co-adsorbent, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). CDCA acts as a hydrophobic spacer, reducing the aggregation of dyes by the formation of a tightly packed mixed monolayer and comparatively gives a better surface coverage, effectively retarding the back-electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to the iodide/triiodide electrolyte. As a result, the open circuit voltage is enhanced.15
Among organic donor moieties, phenothiazine (PTz) has a long and rich history. The presence of electron rich nitrogen and sulphur atoms renders PTz a stronger electron donor character than other amines; in fact, better than triphenylamine, tetrahydroquinoline, carbazole or other N-heterocycles. Moreover, in the ground state, the S0 of PTz is non-planar (a butterfly configuration). Thus it hinders the ground state aggregation and reduces internal conversion [it is known that in general aggregation favours internal conversion (IC), which reduces the photovoltaic performance].16 PTz is also a semiconductor with a high lying HOMO. It can be considered as a p-type (electron donating) building block. PTz has been widely used in thin film field effective transistors (FET), organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, DSSCs and light emitting diodes (LEDs) due to its impedance of molecular aggregation and high hole-transport characteristics.15,17–21 Phenothiazines with a variety of π-spacers have been thoroughly investigated as dyes in DSSCs.18,22,23 The position of the anchoring group in the dye plays a major role in the performance of PTz based dyes24 and fine tuning of their spacer groups inhibits charge recombination in DSSCs.23 A dye with two PTz units linked with an alkyl chain has been shown to enhance the photon to current conversion efficiency.25,26
Phenothiazines with a cyanoacrylic acid acceptor in the 3-position and lateral, bilateral and trilateral extension of conjugation with an electron donating substituent were utilized as dyes in DSSCs.27–30 Despite a number of efforts to fine tune the structure of the organic dyes and especially those based on PTz for better efficiency of DSSCs, the desired progress is still elusive. One of the reasons for the lower efficiency of the organic dyes is attributed to fast recombination, which in turn is due to the strong interaction between the dye and the iodine of the redox shuttle. In addition, dye adsorption to the semiconductor surface can result in aggregation (due to dipole–dipole interaction), especially if the backbone structure of the dye contains delocalized π-bonds. This, in principle, can lower the lifetime and rate of injection of electrons from the excited state of the dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor. The efficient injection of electrons from the excited dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor requires a reduction in recombination and effective regeneration of the dye.2,31,32 This has been realized by a reduction in the π–π stacking on the semiconductor surface that shortens the lifetime of the excited state.33,34
The PTz molecule can be engineered through suitable design consideration for better photon absorption as well as with a lower tendency to aggregate. In light of the known properties of pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with an extensive electron delocalization and electron accepting nature, it could be exploited as a sensitizing unit by coupling with electron rich moieties. It has been hypothesized that upon oxidation, the hydrophobic pyrene units are expected to retard the recombination of the injected electrons with the electrolyte and enhance the photocurrent.35
Based on findings in the literature, it is clear that the design, synthesis and application of a single molecule photosensitizer with a broad and high extent of light absorption, without aggregation on the semiconductor surface, would enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) in DSSCs. This is also a formidable problem of contemporary interest. Based on the properties of phenothiazine and pyrene groups, it could be concluded that the introduction of pyrene and ethynyl groups at the 7-position of PTz might enhance the absorption of light, owing to the increase in conjugation. In addition, the synthetic design considerations include the introduction of alkyl groups, which might effectively suppress the electron recombination and reduce the interaction between the dye molecules.36 This study establishes an increase in efficiency with an increase in alkyl chain length and attributes the same to the reduced aggregation on TiO2, blocking the recapture of photoinjected electrons by triiodide ions and thereby resulting in higher efficiency.
Increased adsorption of dyes due to increased alkyl chain length may come from the hydrophobic effect associated with the chains, which tend to gather away from the polar solvent, as reported earlier.37
With these design considerations, we synthesized six novel organic dyes and investigated the performance of four PTz based dyes in DSSC applications. Two additional PTz based dyes were used in control experiments. The structural and electronic properties of these dyes are also investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Characterizations

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 400/500 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The 1H chemical shift values are expressed in parts per million downfield relative to the internal standard, TMS (δ = 0 ppm) or DMSO-d6 (δ = 2.5 ppm) or CDCl3 (δ = 7.26 ppm). Splitting patterns are indicated as s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet. 13C, DEPT, HMBC and HSQC NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance 500 (125 MHz 13C NMR). The 13C chemical shift values are expressed in parts per million downfield relative to the internal standard TMS (δ = 0 ppm) or DMSO-d6 (δ = 39.5 ppm) or CDCl3 (δ = 77.0 ppm). The solution state absorption spectra of these dyes were measured in acetonitrile with a JASCO V-650 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were measured using a JASCO FP-6300 spectrofluorimeter. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was recorded using a BRUKER D8 ADVANCE diffractometer equipped with a Cu anode and Cu Kα of wavelength 1.5406 Å. Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded on a JASCO FTIR-4100 spectrometer. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on a Q-Tof Micro mass spectrometer. Electrochemical measurements were performed using a Metrohm Autolab 302N potentiostat/galvanostat with a FRA32M module controlled by NOVA 1.11 software. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the dye solution (0.2 mM) were obtained using a conventional three-electrode cell consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum counter electrode and Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M) in an acetonitrile reference electrode (Ag/Ag+) using 0.5 M of TBAP in CH3CN as the electrolyte. All the CVs were recorded at 25 °C with a 50 mV s−1 scan rate. Simulated solar illumination was provided using a LOT Technologies solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter, which provided a light power of 100 mW cm−2 on the surface of the test cell. Current vs. voltage (J–V) curves were obtained under 1 sun condition.
Computational details
To gain clear insights into the molecular structure and electronic distribution of the sensitizers, DFT38 calculations were performed using a B3LYP functional with 6-31G* basis set.39–42 The vibrational frequency analysis confirmed that the optimized geometry corresponded to the minima on the potential energy surface by exhibiting all real frequencies. Based on the optimized ground state geometries, the vertical excitation energies and associated oscillator strengths (f) were obtained by performing time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations using the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G*method.43 The CAM-B3LYP functional43 was used to simulate the excited state geometries, which takes care of the long range correction factor due to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) was used in all calculations to account for solvent effects. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.44
Fabrication of solar cell
The TiO2 thin film was prepared by coating TiO2 paste onto an FTO glass plate using the doctor blade method and dried at 50 °C and finally sintered at 450 °C for one hour. The average thickness of the TiO2 coating is about 6 μm. The PXRD pattern (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) of the TiO2 indicated the presence of an anatase phase. The estimated particle size of TiO2, using Debye–Scherrer's equation, is about 25 nm. The TiO2 electrode was left immersed in the dye solution (0.2 mM) in CH3CN solvent for 24 h to ensure complete dye uptake, and was then rinsed with ethanol to remove excess dye. The dye-coated TiO2 film was air dried and used as the photo-anode in the DSSC. The platinum counter electrodes were prepared by screen printing a platinum layer onto the cleaned FTO glass plates, which were annealed at 400 °C for 1 h. The dye-coated TiO2 films were combined with the platinum coated FTO glass plate counter electrode in a sandwich configuration. To provide space for filling the electrolyte and to realize a leak-proof DSSC, a 60 μm thick hot-melt sheet (MS004610-10) was used as a sealing frame. The photoanode and the counter electrode were placed on either side of the hot-melt sheet frame and sealed together at 80 °C. The active geometrical area of the DSSCs was 0.20 cm2. The space between the electrodes was filled with an electrolyte solution consisting of 0.05 M iodine, 0.5 M lithium iodide in propylene carbonate solvent. After filling with electrolyte, the opening was sealed with Araldite glue.

Results and discussion
Six new dye molecules were synthesized starting from two donor molecules (see Scheme 1). The structures of the dyes are shown in Scheme 2. The chemical structures of the dyes were ascertained from spectroscopic data, the details of which are presented in the experimental section. The spectra and the assignments are given in the ESI (Fig. S2–S51†).
UV-visible absorption properties
The absorption spectra of all the dyes, recorded in acetonitrile solvent, are displayed in Fig. 1. The spectroscopic data is summarized in Table 1. The metal free organic dyes exhibit two distinct absorption bands in the range 320 to 600 nm. The bands in the shorter wavelength (320–400 nm) are ascribed to π–π* transitions of the pyrene-phenothiazine moiety, while the bands at longer wavelength (420 to 600 nm) correspond to ICT from donor to acceptor. The molar extinction coefficient of these metal free organic dyes is significantly larger than that of the ruthenium-based dyes.45

The absorption spectra of dyes 1–6 on TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 2. The spectra of dyes 1–4 show broadening and red shift, which may be attributed to J-aggregation.46 It should be noted that such broadening of an absorption band is favourable for enhancing the photovoltaic efficiency due to higher light harvesting ability. Dyes 5 and 6 show absorption over a narrow wavelength region compared to that of dyes 1–4. This clearly suggests that the replacement of carboxylic acid (a strong anchoring group) with a cyano group (a weak anchoring group) results in reduced dye adsorption and relatively poor surface coverage. The blue-shift observed in the case of dyes 5 and 6 could be due to the formation of an H-aggregate.45,46

TD-DFT calculations were performed to gain insight into the electronic transitions between occupied and virtual orbitals using the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G* method. The simulated absorption spectra in acetonitrile are presented in the ESI (Fig. S52†). The calculated maximum wavelength, oscillator strength (f) and the percentages of the major transitions are provided in Table S1.† The experimentally measured maximum wavelength (λmax) matches well with the calculated absorption wavelength. The oscillator strength is higher for dyes 1 and 2 compared to that of 3–6.
Electrochemical properties
An essential criterion for the fabrication of a DSSC is favourable energy-offset of the sensitizer with respect to TiO2 and redox electrolyte. To this purpose, the dyes were analysed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 3). By combining the formal potential obtained from the CV measurement and wavelength (λ0–0) corresponding to the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra (Fig. S53†) of the corresponding dye, the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) and band gap (Eg) values were calculated using eqn (1)–(3) and are listed in Table 1 (the theoretical values are given in parentheses). (1) EHOMO (eV) = −(E′0 + 4.5) vs. vacuum(2) ELUMO (eV) = (EHOMO + E0–0) vs. vacuum(3)where  is the formal potential obtained from the CV measurement.47
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of the dyes in acetonitrile with 0.5 M TBAP as supporting electrolyte; (a) dyes 1 and 2, (b) dyes 3 and 4 and (c) dyes 5 and 6. 
It can be observed from Table 1 that the energy levels of the HOMOs of all the dyes are lying below the redox energy level of the electrolyte (−4.8 eV vs. vacuum), suggesting that there is sufficient driving force for the regeneration of the oxidized dye by the electrolyte. The energy level diagram of all the dyes with CB of TiO2 and redox electrolyte is shown in Fig. 4. The LUMO energy levels of the dyes are situated above the conduction band (CB) edge of the semiconductor (−4.0 eV vs. vacuum), which favours effective electron injection from the LUMO of the dye to the CB of TiO2 and hence the short-circuit current density is increased. Further, if the difference between the redox potential of the electrolyte and the HOMO level of the dye is large, there is effective blockage of back electron transfer and regeneration of the dye and hence a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC).

Theoretical calculations
The optimized ground state geometries of all the dyes are presented in Table 2. Phenothiazine exhibits a butterfly-like structure in the ground state (which could be better appreciated from the dihedral angles (φ) shown in Table S2†). A pictorial representation of the HOMOs and LUMOs of all the dyes is also shown in Table 2. It can be understood from this figure that the charge distributions on the HOMO are localized on pyrene and phenothiazine, while the LUMO is mainly localized on the acceptor units (i.e. 2-cyanoacetic acid in the case of dyes 1 and 2, rhodanine-3-acetic acid in the case of dyes 3 and 4 and cyano groups in the case of dyes 5 and 6) and partly on phenothiazine. The orbital overlap between the donor and acceptor suggests facilitation of fast charge transition, thus favoring electron injection to the conduction band of TiO2. The optimized ground state geometries, and pictorial representations of the HOMOs and LUMOs of the dyes without pyrene are compiled in Table S3† and their respective energy values are given in Table S4.† It could be seen from Table S3† that the charge distributions of the HOMO are localized on phenothiazine whereas the LUMO is located on the acceptor units. The energy gaps of these dyes are found to be higher than those of dyes 1–6, which validates the design strategy of incorporating a pyrene moiety.

Projected density of state (PDOS) analysis
A PDOS analysis was performed for all the dyes using the B3LYP/6-31G* method and the data are presented in Table 3 along with the frontier orbitals. During excitation of a photosensitizer, it is preferable that the HOMO is localized on the donor moiety and the LUMO on the acceptor moiety to generate an efficient charge-separated state. For all the dyes, it can be seen that the electron density is localized on the donor part for the HOMO (>97%) and in the acceptor part for the LUMO (>60%). It is clearly visible from the frontier orbital diagram (Table 2) that a significant charge-separated state is generated by the transition from the HOMO to the LUMO.

Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis
Furthermore, NBO analysis was performed to understand the charge distribution and electron transfer mechanism based on the optimized structure in the ground state of the dyes. The natural charges of donating and accepting groups in the dye molecules are presented in Table 4. In all the dyes, as expected, the donor part has a positive value, while the acceptor part has a negative value. The positive value indicates that the ethynyl-pyrene attached to the phenothiazine moiety is an effective electron donor unit and the negative value suggests that the cyanoacrylic acid, rhodanine-3-acetic acid and cyano groups are good electron acceptor units.

Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the dyes, DSSCs were fabricated on TiO2 films sensitized with each one of the six dyes described above. They were tested under an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5. The results from these studies, viz., the short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), overall efficiency (η) and dye loading of the DSSCs obtained for dyes 1–6, are compiled in Table 5. The observed results suggest that the increase in the chain length of the R-group attached to the nitrogen in the phenothiazine moiety increases the VOC. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was best in the case of dye 2, followed by dye 1 > 4 > 3 > 6 > 5 (Fig. 6). The poor efficiency observed in dyes 1, 3 and 4 as compared to that of dye 2 could be due to aggregation; in the case of dyes 5 and 6 both aggregation and poor adsorption on the TiO2 surface can be attributed to their reduced PCE values. In order to mitigate the aggregation, CDCA (10 mM) was used as co-adsorbent. This resulted in an increase in JSC, thereby improving the performance in DSSCs. In the presence of CDCA there was a 1.3–2.0 fold increase in the PCE of dyes 1–6. Dyes 3 and 4 show decreased efficiency, because of poor electron injection, which is attributed to the presence of the conjugation breaker –CH2 in the anchoring group. Dyes 5 and 6 having cyano as an anchoring group (control experiments) show poor performance; this is attributed to its infirm anchoring ability to TiO2, as seen from the dye loading capacity (Table 5). Dyes 1–4 display broad absorption in the region of 400–700 nm (Fig. 2) with IPCE values of 70% (dye 1), 75% (dye 2), 30% (dye 3), 40% (dye 4), whereas dyes 5 and 6, with narrow absorption, exhibited < 20%. Therefore, it is clear that broader absorption accompanied by higher IPCE values (relative to the case where no co-adsorbent was used) for dyes 1 and 2 result in better JSC values and hence better power conversion efficiency. The presence of a pyrene group at the 7-position of PTz enhances the absorption range due to an increase in conjugation and provides a hydrophobic environment at the periphery that minimizes the direct contact between electrolyte and anode. Thus DSSCs with varying anchoring groups and alkyl chain length were exploited to study their impact on cell performance. The increase in efficiency can be attributed to the increased electron lifetime, better light harvesting capacity and resistance to recombination.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis
EIS analysis is used to investigate the interfacial charge recombination at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. EIS measurement was carried out at VOC under 1 sun condition with a frequency range of 100 KHz to 0.1 Hz. The typical Nyquist and Bode plots obtained using DSSCs made with the six dyes are shown in Fig. 7a–f. The equivalent circuit (Fig. 7g) consists of one solution cum contact resistance component (RS) and two parallel RC circuit elements. The semicircle in the high frequency range is attributed to the charge transfer at the counter electrode (FTO/Pt) side while the second semicircle observed on the intermediate frequency side is due to the charge transfer in the TiO2-dye/electrolyte interface. The charge transfer resistance (RCT1) pertaining to the counter electrode is also very similar for all the DSSCs reported in this study, as they possess the same counter electrode (Pt). The charge transfer resistances are almost similar for the pertinent electrodes for dyes 1 and 2, while for the other dyes RCT2 is higher and is reflected in their DSSC's lower current density and hence lower power conversion efficiency. The values pertaining to various electrical elements assumed in the proposed circuit used to fit the experimental data are summarized in Table 6. The lifetime (RCT2 × C2) and transport time (RS × C2) of the photoexcited electron have been calculated by fitting the experimental impedance spectra and the value of chi squared (χ2) was allowed to vary to a maximum of 0.001. The lifetime (τn) and transport time (τr) vary because of a change in the charge transfer resistance and associated capacitance of the photoanode. The solution cum contact resistance for all six dyes is observed to be a constant (to a reasonable degree). The transport time value is lower for dye 2 than for dye 1 and hence the DSSC based on dye 2 showed a higher current density. The increase in alkyl chain length has decreased the τn of dye 2 in comparison to that of dye 1, which is probably due to increased back electron transfer between the I3− and TiO2 through the intermolecular space created by the longer alkyl chain. The difference in τr of dyes 3 and 4 is smaller in comparison to that in τn. Due to the aforementioned observation and the presence of a conjugation breaker in the acceptor moiety, dye 3 showed comparable performance to dye 4. The lower photovoltaic performance of dyes 5 and 6 can be attributed to the very low electron lifetime values and poor dye loading as compared to those of the other four dyes.

Conclusions
Six novel phenothiazine based organic dyes with an ethynyl-pyrene linker (conjugation) have been synthesized and the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs fabricated with these dyes as sensitizers was investigated. The presence of pyrene at the 7-position of the phenothiazine ring and alkynyl linkage not only ensures a hydrophobic periphery, hindering water induced desorption, but also results in extended conjugation, enhancing the absorption ability and thereby resulting in good photovoltaic performance. The absorption spectra of dyes 1–4 on the TiO2 surface showed a broadening and red shift compared to the corresponding solution spectra, favouring an enhancement in the photovoltaic efficiency due to higher light harvesting ability. Replacement of the carboxylic acid with a cyano moiety (dyes 5 and 6) results in reduced dye loading on the TiO2 surface, thereby leading to narrow absorption. TD-DFT calculation revealed that the transitions from the HOMO to the LUMO were responsible for the ICT and showed the highest percentage probability. PDOS and NBO analyses also confirmed the ICT from the donor moiety (ethynyl-pyrene-phenothiazine) to the acceptor moiety. The addition of co-adsorbent, CDCA, retards dye aggregation on the semiconductor surface, thereby improving the performance of the device. A maximum of 12% efficiency was observed for dye 2 using CDCA as co-adsorbent. Thus, the fabrication of DSSCs with simple molecular engineering around the phenothiazine moiety can result in a high performance DSSC device.
