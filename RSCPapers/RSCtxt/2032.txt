    , Accepted 12th March 2019First published on 13th March 2019AbstractUsing carbon paste as the back electrode for perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) has attracted significant attention due to their low cost and excellent stability. In general, the device structure of the fabricated C-PSCs is hole transport layer (HTL) free, and the carbon paste electrodes (CPEs) could directly collect the photo-generated holes. Therefore, interfacial engineering between the perovskite and CPE plays a crucial role in charge collection and affects the performance of C-PSCs. Many studies have been carried out in interfacial engineering so far; however, no review has summarized the work done in this field. Herein, we summarize the continuing progress in interfacial engineering of C-PSCs. Two kinds of contacts have been defined due to the different interfacial contacts in C-PSCs: bi-interfacial and tri-interfacial structures. Techniques for the fabrication of perovskite layers, CPEs, and insulating layers have been discussed for each structure, including the main issues and solutions. Finally, conclusions and perspectives are provided for the future designs and development of C-PSCs.Fanning MengFanning Meng is a Ph.D. candidate in Tingli Ma's Lab, Dalian University of Technology.

1. Introduction
In less than a decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 23.7%.1–5 This is because of the excellent optoelectronic properties of perovskite crystals, such as high absorption coefficients, ambipolar charge transport properties, long carrier diffusion lengths and an extremely low exciton binding energy.6–12 To achieve a high PCE, most devices use organic HTLs and noble metals as the back electrodes.
2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) have frequently been used as HTLs in PSCs.13 The noble metals Au and Ag are the most typically used back electrode materials. However, these materials are expensive and therefore not ideal for commercial applications. To deal with this problem, researchers have developed low-cost HTLs, such as CuI, CuSCN, and NiO, and non-noble metal electrodes, such as carbon, Ni, Al and other alternatives.14 In particular, carbon materials can replace HTLs and back electrodes in HTL-free devices at the same time. In addition, its strong hydrophobicity can remarkably improve the stability of PSCs. Therefore, the development of CPEs can significantly reduce the manufacturing cost and resolve stability issues encountered in the commercial application of PSCs. Although the PCE is lower than that of noble-metal based PSCs, the PCE of HTL-free C-PSCs has reached up to 15.7% recently.15 The material origins of CPEs generally include graphite, carbon black,16–21 spongy carbon,22 candle soot,23 aloe vera carbon,24 and coal powder.25 However, due to poor contact at the perovskite/carbon electrode interface and fabrication technique limitations, a significant amount of undesired charge recombination occurs in these HTL-free C-PSCs. Contact issues at the perovskite/CPE interface are usually considered to be the main cause of the current low performance.26 Therefore, interfacial engineering between the perovskite and CPE is indispensable for HTL-free C-PSCs to suppress charge recombination and to improve the device performance.
Many reviews have been reported by researchers on C-PSCs.27–33 Although interfacial engineering plays a crucial role in charge collection and affects the photovoltaic performance, no summary is available on the C-PSCs from the perspective of interfacial engineering. In this review, the interfacial engineering of C-PSCs has been summarized in detail. We hope that this report will provide researchers with distinct insights to facilitate the technique development and contribute to improve the efficiency of C-PSCs.
2. Interfacial structures in C-PSCs
Two main structures can be defined for C-PSCs according to the interfacial conditions: a bi-interfacial structure (Fig. 1a) and a tri-interfacial structure (Fig. 1b). In general, the bi-interfacial structure of C-PSCs is HTL-free. Devices are fabricated by a layer-by-layer deposition process with a dense carbon layer on the top and the perovskite film is intercalated between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the carbon layer. When it comes to the tri-interfacial structure, the perovskite precursor is infiltrated into the mesoscopic scaffold by drop-casting in the end. The scaffold could be a non-electron accepting, insulating dielectric oxide, such as Al2O3 or ZrO2. Finally, the tri-interfacial contact is formed between the insulating dielectric oxide layer, the perovskite, and the carbon layer.
 Fig. 1  Device structure of C-PSCs: (a) bi-interfacial structure and (b) tri-interfacial structure. 
To obtain a high performance for HTL-free C-PSCs, the contact at the perovskite/CPE interface is very important because the recombination of most carriers occurs at the interfaces. Interfacial engineering of the two representative structures of the C-PSCs is listed in parallel for comparison, as shown in Fig. 2. For the bi-interfacial structure, the contact condition between the perovskite and the CPE interface is layer-by-layer. Therefore, in order to form an intimate contact, techniques for engineering the perovskites have been developed by researchers such as solvent engineering, colloidal engineering, inorganic interlayer incorporation, crystallization engineering and grain-orientation engineering. The reported CPE modification techniques include the effects of the solvent in the carbon paste, press transfer, increasing contact sites, hot-pressing, solidification of the binder, modified solvent dripping, and design of a composite carbon layer. For the tri-interfacial structure, the contact condition is infiltration at the insulating layer/perovskite/CPE interfaces. Therefore, techniques for engineering the perovskites, CPEs, and the insulating layer are used. For the perovskite, the reported modification techniques include template engineering, solvent engineering, additive engineering, post-treatment engineering, addition of excess PbX2, inorganic interlayer incorporation and solvent vapor assisted treatment. For CPEs, the effective modification techniques include adjusting the pore structure and thickness of the carbon layer, designing a stratified carbon layer structure, surface property management of the carbon layer, and application of new materials. For the insulating layer, lots of attention has been paid to a suitable perovskite formula, thickness of the insulating layer, and the NiO interlayer. In the following text, we will discuss interfacial engineering according to the different interfacial configurations.

3. Bi-interfacial structure
In most cases, the bi-interfacial structure of C-PSCs is HTL-free. In order to obtain a better interfacial contact, two main procedures are carefully controlled: (1) an ultra-even and dense perovskite film should be fabricated, where the solvent used must avoid damages to the perovskite film. (2) CPE modification techniques must be exactly designed to enhance the interfacial contact to the perovskite layer, where more contact sites are beneficial for hole transfer and good adhesive force. Therefore, the bi-interfacial structure for HTL-free C-PSCs are summarized in this review.
3.1 High-quality perovskite techniques
Interfacial contact issues between the perovskite layer and the CPEs are mainly attributed to the post-deposition process. Actually, manipulating the growth and morphology of the perovskite crystals plays an equally important role for interfacial contact. Chen et al. prepared a perovskite layer with good quality enabling intimate contact at the perovskite/CPE interface by solvent engineering.34 They utilized a mixed solvent of isopropanol (IPA) and cyclohexane (CYHEX) for MAI solution to replace pure IPA. The usage of the IPA/CYHEX solvent not only accelerated the conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 (methylammonium lead iodide, MAPbI3), but also suppressed the Ostwald ripening process. Therefore, a tight contact at the perovskite/CPE interface formed (Fig. 3), resulting in a remarkable PCE of 14.38%. Similarly, the mixed solvent for IPA and CYHEX was also used to control the conversion of PbBr2 to MAPbBr3, resulting in a preferential crystal orientation in the [001] direction and a smooth surface morphology.35

Although the preparation of an ultra-even perovskite layer on the mesoporous TiO2 film is usually difficult, colloidal engineering provides a useful method to prevent the surface of perovskites from roughening. Chang et al. added a small quantity of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into the PbI2 dimethylformamide (DMF) solution and formed an ultra-even PbI2 surface on the mesoporous TiO2 film.36 This ultra-even surface was well-maintained after the chemical conversion to MAPbI3. The interfacial contact between MAPbI3 and CPE was significantly enhanced by colloidal engineering. In addition, Zhang et al. reported a chlorobenzene-solvent assisted process, which induced ultra-flat and dense perovskite capping layers on top of the mesoporous TiO2 films. Thus, the performance of the HTL-free C-PSCs was remarkably improved.37 Beyond the strategies mentioned above, inorganic interlayer (such as CuPc) modification also provides opportunities for improving the interfacial contact in the bi-interfacial structure of C-PSCs.38,39
For inorganic perovskites (e.g. CsPbI3, CsPbBr3), Chang et al. proposed that the formation of an even surface for the CsPbBr3 film depended on a proper reaction time and temperature, which made a difference in the contact at the CsPbBr3/CPE interface.40 Zhu et al. designed an intermolecular exchange route for the desired CsPbIBr2 films. The desired features, such as high-crystallinity, [100]-orientation, micrometer-sized crystalline grains, greatly reduced grain boundaries and compositional defects, provided the foundation for an intimate interfacial contact between the perovskite and the carbon layer.41 A summary of techniques for the formation of high-quality perovskites in a bi-interfacial structure for C-PSCs is listed in Table 1.

3.2 CPE modification techniques
To enhance the interfacial contact, many techniques for the modification of CPEs have been reported in the bi-interfacial structure of C-PSCs. To form a good interfacial contact, Tao et al. mixed acetonitrile (ACN) with the carbon paste. When doctor-blading the carbon paste on the perovskite film, the surface dissolution and recrystallization behavior of the perovskite resulted in tight interfacial contact between the MAPbI3 and CPE.42 However, as an opposite approach, Chu et al. believed that maintaining a perovskite film with a dense and uniform morphology was necessary. They chose a perovskite-friendly solvent to prepare the carbon paste. The corresponding device demonstrated a PCE of up to 13.5% (VOC = 1.07 V).43
For other CPE modification techniques, Wei et al. designed a candle soot electrode and focused on optimization of the perovskite/CPE interface (Fig. 4). During the evolution of such clamping solar cells, they gradually solved two problems: (1) the low conductivity of the candle soot electrodes and (2) undesired contact at the perovskite/candle soot electrode interface. Eventually, the optimized technology greatly boosted the PCE from 2.6% to 11.02%.44

Yang et al. fabricated HTL-free C-PSCs with an all-carbon CPE. Small graphite flakes and carbon black particles were applied to provide much more contact sites between the perovskite and the CPE, which was favorable to improve the interfacial contact and the charge transport behavior (Fig. 5).17 Wei et al. developed a free-standing carbon film with excellent flexibility and conductivity for a HTL-free C-PSCs. Due to the thermoplasticity of the binder in the carbon film, it could be directly hot-pressed on the perovskite layer. The back contact at the perovskite/CPE interface was significantly improved, resulting in a PCE of 13.53%.18 Thereafter, Wei et al. reported that the epoxy binder improved the interfacial contact between the perovskite and the CPE by cementation to a certain extent.45 In addition, Liu et al. proved that the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer could condense the gaps in the mesoscopic carbon film during solidification, resulting in an improved MAPbI3/CPE interface contact.20

Dripping additives dispersed in an anti-solvent to improve the performance of PSCs has been reported previously.46,47 Similarly, Ryu et al. attempted to improve the performance of the C-PSCs using a modified method, where carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were involved in the dripping anti-solvent. CNTs that penetrated into both the perovskite film and the CPE provided a pathway for faster hole transfer to the CPE (Fig. 6).48

Other approaches have also been developed to improve the perovskite/CPE interface. For example, Yu et al. designed a bi-layer back contact consisting of a carbon/MAI composite layer and a compact hydrophobic carbon layer.49 In particular, the new application area for the carbon material could provide broader perspectives in material selection. Meng et al. investigated the utilization of coal-based carbon electrodes in HTL-free C-PSCs for the first time because of their lower cost by three to four orders of magnitude than the cheapest carbon black electrodes. The prepared carbon layer is tightly connected with the perovskite layer without any interfacial cracks and shows good stability at ambient atmosphere.25 A summary of CPE modification techniques in the bi-interfacial structure of C-PSCs is listed in Table 2.

4. Tri-interfacial structure
For the tri-interfacial structure of C-PSCs, pores among particles in the CPEs are filled with perovskite crystals. In order to achieve intimate interfacial contact, researchers have carried out relevant work for three main aspects: (1) perovskite layers were modified by both the precursor solution and crystal growth. Techniques for the perovskite precursor solution aimed at increasing the pore filling ability, permeability and wettability. And techniques for controlling the crystallization aimed at getting beneficial crystal growth orientation, reducing grain boundaries, and decreasing the defect density. (2) CPE modification techniques were used to provide the perovskite precursor with an easily infiltrating and crystallizing surface. (3) In addition, due to the tri-interfacial contact, the insulation layer has also been paid sufficient attention.
4.1 Perovskite layer modification
The growth of perovskite crystals has its inherent rules. Thus, the study on the most favourable crystallization conditions, such as nucleation sites, is essential for the formation of a good contact at the perovskite/CPE interface. Mei et al. introduced 5-aminovaleric acid (5-AVA) cations into the MAPbI3 precursor solution, where hydrogen bonds formed between the COOH and NH3+ groups. During nucleation, COOH groups coordinated to the exposed Ti(IV) or Zr(IV) ions, and the amino acid molecules covered the surface of the mesoporous TiO2 and ZrO2 film. The COOH groups of 5-AVA induced the crystal growth of (5-AVA)x(MA)1−xPbI3, which resulted in better interfacial contact and a lower defect density than pristine MAPbI3 (Fig. 7). Finally, the device achieved a certified PCE of 12.8% and was stable for more than 1000 hours in ambient air under full sunlight.50

Due to the difference in the molecular structure, organic solvents present different polarities and viscosities, which influence the infiltration and wettability of the perovskite precursor solution in the tri-interfacial structure. Chen et al. revealed that the optimal solvent was DMF/DMSO (0.93:0.07, v/v), which was favourable for the precursor solution to diffuse in a strongly hydrophobic carbon film as well as infiltrate completely into the hydrophilic TiO2 and ZrO2 films.51
During the formation of the perovskite crystals by solution processing, defects directly affect not only the properties of the perovskite but also the interface between the perovskite and the adjacent layers. Additive engineering seems to be a moderate method to resolve this deficiency. Hou et al. introduced the multifunctional additive guanidinium chloride (GuCl) into the perovskite precursor, and then observed that the MAPbI3·xGuCl formed interconnected crystals on account of the synergy of Gu and chlorine. The compact morphology and complete pore-filling improved the interfacial contact and facilitated charge transfer at the interfaces of the TiO2/perovskite and the perovskite/CPE (Fig. 8). Therefore, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) was significantly enhanced from 0.88 V to 1.02 V.52 Rong et al. used ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) as an additive and synergized with moisture, inducing high-quality perovskite crystals with beneficial growth orientation.53

(b) and (c) Top-view SEM images of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3·xGuCl films on FTO substrates. (d) and (e) Top view SEM images of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3·xGuCl (x = 0.25) infiltrated mesoporous TiO2 films. (f) and (g) Cross-sectional SEM images of the mesoporous scaffold (TiO2/ZrO2) infiltrated with MAPbI3 and MAPbI3·xGuCl (x = 0.25).52 
Compared with additive engineering in the perovskite precursor, dip-coating trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) ligands on pre-fabricated C-PSCs emphasizes the effect of post-healing in the perovskite grain boundaries. Huang et al. demonstrated that defects could be post-healed via O atoms in the PO bonds by coordination to the halide-deficient sites, leading to a rise in the PCE from 11.0% to 12.8%.54 In addition, the effect of excess PbX2 (X = I or Br) in the perovskite precursor induced a similar influence on the formation of perovskite grain boundaries.55 The incorporation of an interlayer is another useful strategy for modifying the interfacial contact between the perovskite and CPE. The addition of the inorganic interlayer NiO could result in the passivation of interfacial defects, enhancement of charge carrier dynamics, and improved stability of the perovskite.56,57 Moreover, solvent vapor assisted treatment is another efficient method to modify the MAPbI3/CPE interface. Because the carbon electrodes absorb over almost the whole visible spectrum, it is difficult to characterize the structural information and the charge transfer process at the perovskite/carbon electrode interfaces by conventional methods, such as UV-vis absorption and microscopic examination.58,59 Therefore, Li et al. investigated the reaction kinetics, crystallization process and structural formation at the MAPbI3/CPE interface by in situ photoluminescence (PL) monitoring.60 A spatial confinement induced MAPbI3/CPE interfacial contact was observed from the time evolution of the PL signal. By using the solvent vapor assisted treatment, an efficient MAPbI3/CPE interfacial contact was finally achieved and a PCE of 12.30% was obtained. The summary of the techniques for the perovskite layer modification in the tri-interfacial structure of C-PSCs is listed in Table 3.

4.2 CPE modification techniques
To modify CPEs in the tri-interfacial structure, Ku et al. first assembled C-PSCs based on carbon black and graphite electrodes, which presented a PCE of 6.64%.61 Thereafter, Xu et al. applied highly ordered mesoporous carbon with well-connected frameworks to prepare CPEs.62 At the start of the study, although the mesoporous carbon layer was the only pathway for infiltration of the perovskite precursor, researchers did not fully realize the key role of the thickness of the CPEs. In fact, this key factor could significantly affect the crystallization of the perovskite and the interfacial contact between the perovskite and CPE. Zhang et al. first proposed the necessity of optimizing the thickness of the carbon layer. The appropriate thickness of the carbon layer could not only facilitate the diffusion of the precursor solution to form a good interfacial contact within the bulk of the CPE, but also provide reliable conductivity for the extraction of holes. Thus, the champion device presented a PCE of 11.63%.63
Considering the complete pore filling and high conductivity of CPE, Jiang et al. designed a stratified structure for the carbon layer. The highly conductive and low temperature carbon (LTC) was printed upon the prepared high temperature carbon (HTC), resulting in a device structure of TiO2/ZrO2/HTC (perovskite)/LTC. Finally, the optimized device showed a high PCE of 14.04%.19
Usually, the surface of the carbon material is rich in oxygen-containing functional groups. Tian et al. took full advantage of this surface property of carbon black to shift the work function of the CPE. Due to the chemical interaction between the oxygen-rich carbon black (ORC) and the perovskite (Fig. 9), intimate contact significantly facilitated the hole extraction efficiency at the perovskite/CPE interface, resulting in a remarkable PCE of 15.7%.15

Bio-inspired cross-linked carbon has been widely used in the field of electrochemical research due to its high conductivity and chemical stability. Mali et al. extracted an aloe-vera carbon (AV-C) to prepare CPEs. The network of AV-C nanoparticles provided abundant pathways for high pore filling, resulting in highly even, compact, and pinhole-free MAPbI3 crystals. Meanwhile the contact at the TiO2/ZrO2/carbon interfaces was smooth and uniform (Fig. 10). Thus, the AV-C based device resulted in a high PCE of up to 12.50%.24 A summary of CPE modification techniques in the tri-interface structure of C-PSCs is listed in Table 4.

4.3 Insulating layer
For the tri-interfacial structure, ZrO2 or Al2O3 usually acts as an insulating layer to prevent ETLs from being in contact with the CPEs directly.61 On the one hand, the perovskite precursor solution must penetrate through the carbon and ZrO2 films to reach the ETLs. On the other hand, photo-generated carriers have to transport and separate through the perovskite filled in the ZrO2 films. Therefore, the presence of an insulating layer and good contact at the perovskite/ZrO2 (or Al2O3) interface is indispensable for high performance devices. Mei et al. adjusted the formula of the perovskite precursor ((5-AVA)x (MA)1−xPbI3) to enable complete pore filling at the hydrophobic carbon layer and the hydrophilic ZrO2 layer. Meanwhile, they observed that the photovoltaic performance was bad in the absence of ZrO2, thus confirming that ZrO2 was blocking photo-generated electrons from recombining with holes in the CPEs.50 Liu et al. optimized the thickness of the ZrO2 film, which facilitated the pore filling and the morphology of MAPbI3 on the TiO2/ZrO2/carbon scaffold. Thus, the hole transport resistance was reduced, which increased the PCE to 13.7%.64 Thereafter, Jiang et al. revealed that a suitable thickness of the ZrO2 layer could result in an enhancement in the VOC, which was very important for evaluating the photovoltaic performance of C-PSCs.65 NiO together with Al2O3 could serve as an insulating layer to prevent the short circuit of the C-PSCs.56 A summary of techniques for the insulating layer in the tri-interface structure of C-PSCs is listed in Table 5.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
Although HTL-free C-PSCs achieved a high PCE of 15.7%, this value can very possibly be surpassed again. In this review, we summarized various techniques for the interfacial engineering of C-PSCs. Firstly, for HTL-free C-PSCs, whether in the bi-interfacial structure or tri-interfacial structure, screening of carbon materials is very important. The following factors should be considered: conductivity, carrier mobility, amorphous or ordered structure, particle size, and specific surface area. The desired properties are as follows: (1) excellent electrical conductivity. (2) High hole mobility. (3) Ordered structure and strong interaction based on π–π stacking, which are beneficial for hole extraction and transport. (4) Small particle size. (5) High specific surface area. (6) Some other unique properties, such as a seamless bond with the perovskite.
Secondly, techniques for the interfacial engineering of HTL-free C-PSCs are indispensable. For a bi-interfacial structure of C-PSCs, two main procedures should be carefully controlled: (1) an ultra-even and dense perovskite film should be fabricated, where the solvent used must avoid damages to the perovskite film. (2) CPE modification techniques must be exactly designed to enhance the interfacial contact with the perovskite layer, where more contact sites are beneficial for the hole transfer and a good adhesive force. The feasible perovskite modification techniques include solvent engineering, colloidal engineering, inorganic interlayer incorporation, crystallization engineering and grain-orientation engineering. The feasible CPE modification techniques include the effects of the solvent in the carbon paste, press transfer, increasing contact sites, hot-pressing, solidification of the binder, modified solvent dripping, self-adhesive carbon layer, design of a composite carbon layer, and adjusting the thickness of the carbon layer.
For the tri-interfacial structure of the C-PSCs, interfacial engineering should be carried out for three main aspects: (1) perovskite layers were modified by both the precursor solution and crystal growth. Techniques for the perovskite precursor solution aimed at increasing the pore filling ability, permeability and wettability. And techniques for controlling the crystallization aimed at getting beneficial crystal growth orientation, reducing grain boundaries, and decreasing the defect density. (2) CPE modification techniques were used to provide a perovskite precursor with an easily infiltrating and crystallizing surface. (3) In addition, due to the tri-interfacial contact, the insulation layer has also been paid sufficient attention. Feasible perovskite modification techniques include template engineering, solvent engineering, additive engineering, post-treatment engineering, addition of excess PbX2, inorganic interlayer incorporation, and solvent vapor assisted treatment. The feasible CPE modification techniques include adjusting the pore structure and the thickness of the carbon layer, designing a stratified structure for the carbon layer, surface property management of the carbon layer, and application of new materials. Moreover, techniques for the insulating layer include a suitable perovskite composition, adjusting the thickness of the insulating layer, and inserting a NiO interlayer.
The certified PCE of traditional PSCs is 23.7% at present. However, the PCE of carbon electrode-based PSCs is much lower than that of traditional PSCs due to poor contact at the perovskite/carbon electrode interface, serious charge recombination, high resistance of the carbon electrodes, and limitations of the fabrication technique. For further improvements in efficiency, the interfacial contact issues remain as the principal challenge of C-PSCs at present and in the future. On the one hand, this issue has arisen from the intrinsic physical properties of the carbon material such as conductivity, particle size, and amorphous or ordered structure. On the other hand, interfacial engineering of the C-PSCs is indispensable. Developing new techniques in interfacial engineering for the modification of perovskite layers, carbon electrodes, and insulating layers could be hot topics for future research work. In addition, due to the absorption properties of carbon materials over the whole visible spectrum, research on new characterization methods for C-PSCs and the charge transfer processes at the perovskite/carbon electrode interface is also an important direction. Overall, interfacial engineering needs to be carried out to take a positive step toward commercialization. Beyond C-PSCs, these efforts could help us to further popularize the application of carbon materials in other fields.
