    , Accepted 13th May 2011First published on 7th July 2011AbstractScalar relativistic density functional theory (DFT) has been used to explore the spectroscopic and redox properties of Ruthenium-type photovoltaic sensitizers, trans-[Ru(RL)(NCS)2] (RL = 4,4′′′-di-R-4′,4′′-bis(carboxylic acid)-2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine, R = H (1), Me (2), tBu (3) and COOH (4); RL = 4,4′′′-di-R-4′,4′′-bis(carboxylic acid)-cycloquaterpyridine, R = COOH (5)). The geometries of the molecular ground, univalent cationic and triplet excited states of 1–5 were optimized. In complexes 1–4, the quaterpyridine ligand retains its planarity in the molecular, cationic and excited states, although the CN-Ru angle representing the SCN → Ru coordination approaches 180° in the univalent cationic and triplet excited states. The theoretically designed complex 5 displays a curved cycloquaterpyridine ligand with significantly distorted SCN → Ru coordination. The electron spin density distributions reveal that one electron is removed from the Ru/NCS moieties upon oxidation and the triplet excited state is due to the Ru/NCS → polypyridine charge transfer (MLCT/L'LCT). The experimental absorption spectra were well reproduced by the time-dependent DFT calculations. In the visible region, two MLCT/L'LCT absorption bands were calculated to be at 652 and 506 nm for 3, agreeing with experimental values of 637 and 515 nm, respectively. The replacement of the R- group with -COOH stabilizes the lower-energy unoccupied orbitals of π* character in the quaterpyridine ligand in 4. This results in a large red shift for these two MLCT/L'LCT bands. In contrast, the lower-energy MLCT/L'LCT peak of 5 nearly disappears due to the introduction of cycloquaterpyridine ligand. The higher energy bands in 5 however become broader and more intense. As far as absorption in the visible region is concerned, the theoretically designed 5 may be a very promising sensitizer for DSSC. In addition, the redox potentials of 1–5 were calculated and discussed, in conjunction with photosensitizers such as cis-[Ru(L1)2(X)2] (L1 = 4,4′-bis(carboxylic acid)-2,2′-bipyridine; X = NCS− (6), Cl− (7) and CN− (8)), cis-[Ru(L1′)2(NCS)2] (L1′ = 4,7-bis(carboxylic acid)-1,10-phenanthroline, 9), [NH4][Ru(L2)(NCS)3] (L2 = 4,4′,4′′-tris(carboxylic acid)-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine, 10) and [Ru(L2)(NCS)3]− (11).
1. Introduction
To satisfy the rapidly growing global energy demand as well as mitigate the growing or potential scarcity of fossil fuels while decreasing environmental pollution, a great amount of research has currently been focused on the solar energy.1–4 Starting with the Grätzel group's pioneering work,5dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been intensely investigated as possible low-cost alternatives to conventional solid-state photovoltaic devices. At the present moment, the solar to electric power conversion efficiency of DSSC is around 11%.6–8
At the heart of the DSSC, the photosensitizer is illuminated and excited by sunlight to an excited state from which electron injection into the conductor band of semiconductor electrode is feasible.9–33 So far, the polypyridyl Ru(II)-type dye is one of the most successful charge-transfer sensitizers applied in DSSCs.24–37 For example, the most well-known N3 dye, cis-[Ru(L1)2(NCS)2] (L1 = 4,4′-bis(carboxylic acid)-2,2′-bipyridine), has been identified as a fairly efficient photosensitizer owing to its broad range of visible light absorption centered at 534 nm, relatively long-lived excited states, and high thermal stability.24 Moreover, the presence of terminal acidic carboxyl groups is known to allow stable anchoring of the dye to the semiconductor surface. As a result of the rather low utilization of the red and near-Infrared (NIR) parts of sunlight spectrum by the N3 chromophore, there is a quest for sensitizers that achieve a more effective harnessing of low-energy sunlight.25–27 In comparison to polypyridyl ruthenium complexes featuring metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in the visible region,1–3 one can red-shift the absorption by either lowering the energy of the ligand-based acceptor states or destabilizing the metal-based levels. The former strategy has been widely applied to obtain chromophores that have both a red-shifted absorption and an increased extinction coefficient.25–27 Up to now, complexes such as [NHEt3][Ru(L2)(NCS)3] (L2 = 4,4′,4′′-tris(carboxylic acid)-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) (N749)26 and trans-[Ru(RL)(NCS)2] (RL = 4,4′′′-di-tert-butyl-4′,4′′-bis(carboxylic acid)-2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine) (N886)27 have been engineered and experimentally characterized as possessing lower-energy acceptor ligands than that of N3. Consequently, a large red shift was found for their featured absorption relative to that of N3 dye.26,27
The single dye molecule takes on the responsibility of light harvesting and charge injection in the DSSC.1–4 To gain insights into these processes, it is essential to understand the photophysical, electrochemical and excited-state properties of dyes at the molecular level.29,38–39 In conjunction with experimental exploration, theoretical studies are helpful in designing dyes that have both high extinction coefficient and better overlap with the solar spectrum, ensuring improvements in the overall conversion efficiency of the DSSC. Investigations on several gold and platinum complexes40–42 as well as Ru(II) dyes38–39,43–47 indicated that density functional theory associated with reasonable solvation models is quite reliable for investigating their electronic spectra and energetics.
In this work, we theoretically explored an experimentally reported polypyridyl Ru(II) complex, N886,27 having two tert-butyl (tBu) groups on the quaterpyridine ligand. Further calculations were focused on several designed complexes obtained by replacing the tBu of N886 with H, Me and COOH groups and also on a designed cycloquaterpyridine complex. The attached ligands were altered to examine their influences on the charge transfer processes involved in the photosensitization role of the N886 complex. The geometrical and electronic structures of the complexes in the molecular, univalent cationic and triplet excited states were also studied. The spectroscopic properties and redox potentials of these complexes are discussed in detail below.
2. Computational details
Three codes (Priroda 6.0,48–52ADF 2008.0153–55 and Gaussian 03)56 were used in the calculations. In the calculations carried out with the Priroda program, relativistic effects were included using an all-electron scalar relativistic four-component approach (AE).57 All-electron Gaussian-type basis sets of double and triple-ζ polarized quality (DZP and TZP) were used.49 The calculations were carried out using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) PBE exchange–correlation functional.58,59 Population-based (Mayer)60 bond orders and atomic charges as developed by Hirshfeld61 were also calculated at this level.
An integration parameter of 6.0 was applied in the ADF calculations. The zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA) method of van Lenthe was used to include scalar relativistic effects.62–64 Triple-ζ polarized (TZP) Slater type orbitals (STOs) and the PBE functional were employed.
Structural optimizations on the chosen complexes were also performed using both the PBE58,59 and hybrid B3LYP65–67 functionals within Gaussian 03 package. Here relativistic effects were described using small core relativistic effective pseudopotentials (SC-ECPs).68–70 Two kinds of basis sets were employed namely; BSI: LanL2DZ for the Ru and S atoms, 6-31G* basis set for all other atoms, and additional functions for Ru (αf = 1.235)71 and S (αd = 0.4210)72–74 atoms; and BSII: SDD for the Ru (αf = 1.235) and S (αd = 0.4210) atoms, and 6-31G* for all other atoms.

Solvent effects were simulated with the polarizable continuum model (PCM)75–78 in Gaussian 03 and the conductor-like screening solvation model (COSMO)79 in ADF. The Klamt radii were used for the main group atoms (H = 1.30 Å, C = 2.00 Å, N = 1.83 Å, O = 1.72 Å and S = 2.20 Å) and for the transition metal (Ru = 1.80 Å) in the ADF calculations.80
The electronic spectra of the complexes were calculated in methanol solution using the Gaussian 03 code. Forty low-lying spin-allowed excited states were calculated using the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)81–83 in conjunction with PCM solvation model.
In this work, five photosensitizers, trans-[Ru(RL)(NCS)2] (RL = 4,4′′′-di-R-4′,4′′-bis(carboxylic acid)-2,2′:6′,2′′:6′′,2′′′-quaterpyridine, R = H (1), Me (2), tBu (3) and COOH (4); RL = 4,4′′′-di-R-4′,4′′-bis(carboxylic acid)-cycloquaterpyridine, R = COOH (5)) were investigated theoretically. The experimental geometrical features of 4 were used to evaluate the performance of the different relativistic approaches (AE, ZORA and SC-ECP), media (gas phase and methanol, ethanol and water solvents), density functionals (PBE and B3LYP) and basis sets (DZP, TZP, BSI and BSII), Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, the trend of the Ru-N3 < Ru-N1 < Ru–N2 distances in 4 was reproduced in all the calculations. This is in good agreement with the available experimental data on tetradentate pyridyl-type ruthenium(II)84 and nickel(II)85 complexes. With the exception of the calculated Ru-N1 distances and the Ru-NC angles, there is rather very little difference in the calculated structural parameters obtained with the different approaches employed in this work. The Ru–N1 distance is sensitive to the choice of theoretical approach, varying between 1.90 and 2.04 Å, in comparison to the experimental value of 2.09 Å.84,85 The comparison in Table 1 demonstrates that the use of the PBE functional with all-electron DZP basis sets and the four-component scalar relativistic approach as implemented in Priroda is sufficiently reliable for the geometry optimization of the complexes. This approach or model was therefore used in the subsequent calculations.
In brief, the molecular, univalent cationic and triplet excited-state structures of complexes 1–5 were optimized using the Priroda code in the gas phase; subsequent analytical frequency calculations were used to confirm the local minima nature of the stationary points on the potential energy surface and also to obtain thermodynamic data; The calculated vibrational frequencies are listed in Table S1 of Supplementary Information. The bond orders, atomic charges and electron-spin density were also obtained in the Priroda calculations. On the basis of the optimized structures, the solvation free energies were calculated using the PCM and COSMO solvation models. The electronic spectra of the complexes were subsequently calculated at the TD-DFT level with the hybrid B3LYP functional and the PCM solvation model.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Molecular, cationic and excited-state structures
The structures of complexes 1–5 in their molecular, cationic and triplet-excited states were optimized using the PBE functional and all-electron DZP basis sets. The four-component scalar relativistic Hamiltonian has been implemented in the Priroda program. The calculated structural parameters are listed in Table 2, and diagrammatic representations of the complexes are presented in Fig. 1. At the molecular ground states of complexes 1–4, the calculated Ru–N bond lengths decrease in going from Ru–N2, Ru–N1 to Ru–N3 (labeled number for N atom as seen in Fig. 1). The variation of the Ru–N bonds lengths is somewhat minimal when the R- group bonded to the quaterpyridine ligand is changed from H to Me, tBu and COOH across the 1–4 series. In 1–3, the increasing electron donating ability from H to Me to tBu results in negligible (0.004 Å) shortening of the Ru-N2 distances. In comparison to 1, the combined conjugated and electron-withdrawing effects present in the para-HOOC-quaterpyridine in 4 also have little influence on the N1–Ru and N2–Ru distances as well as the N3 → Ru interaction. Complexes 1–4 possess the open quaterpyridine ligand ring which is essentially planar in the molecular state. In contrast, complex 5 has a curved cycloquaterpyridine structure exhibiting a highly distorted SCN → Ru coordination. Examination of 5 reveals that the similar equatorial chemical environment of the Ru metal results in rather similar Ru–N2 and Ru–N3 bond lengths while the axial Ru–N1 distances were calculated to be 2.179 Å inside and 1.944 Å outside the curved surface of cycloquaterpyridine.

 Fig. 1  Diagrammatic representations of complexes 1–5, where the N atoms are also labeled in 1. 
Our calculated results in the ground state (Table S2) suggest that the bond orders of the Ru–N1 and Ru–N3 bonds in 1–4 complexes range from 0.70 to 0.72 indicating that these bonds are essentially almost single bonds. In contrast the Ru–N2 interaction is relatively weaker with the bond orders around 0.45–0.46. The weaker Ru–N2 interactions could be described as being due to the open-ring polypyridyl structure in which there is an attempt to decrease repulsion between the terminating H atoms. In contrast, all the Ru–N bonds of complex 5 which possesses a cyclic-polypyridyl ligand exhibit bond orders between 0.61 and 0.74.
As shown in Table S2, the calculated bond orders of complexes 1–5 reveal that the NC bonds are of partial triple bond character with a mean bond order of about 2.26 while the C–S bonds are possess significant double bond character with a mean bond order of 1.74. This is due to the sharing of more π-electrons as a result of electronic conjugation across the NCS− ligand. This conjugation effect also makes the thiocyanate moiety nearly linear (Table 2).
The optimized structural parameters of complexes 1–5 reveal some similarities and differences between the structures of the mono-cationic, triplet excited and the molecular ground states. Complex 1 has similar NC–S angles between 179° and 180° in all three electronic states. The N–Ru–N and Ru–NC angles tend to become increasingly linear on going from molecular ground state to the oxidized mono- cationic and triplet excited states. The bonding interactions between the Ru metal center and the quaterpyridine ligand are weakened (the Ru–N2 and Ru–N3 distances increase) in the oxidation process involved in moving from the molecular ground state of 1 to its mono-cationic state, Table 2. In contrast, the Ru–NCS− interaction and the inner NC–S− bonding are somewhat strengthened upon oxidation. As an example, the Ru–N1 and C–S bonds in 1 are shortened by 0.032 and 0.009 Å, respectively, upon oxidation. It should be noted that the overall NCS− ligand is shortened in spite of the 0.002 Å increase in the NC bond-length. In comparison with the electronic molecular ground state of 1, the Ru–N1 and Ru–N2 bonds in the triplet excited state are shrunk by 0.015 and 0.026 Å respectively while the Ru–N3 distance increases by 0.040 Å. As above discussed for 1, similar structural changes were observed in the cationic and triplet excited states of complexes 2–5, Table 2.
3.2 Charges and electron-spin density
The charge transfer processes involved in the redox events and electronic photoexcitation of the photosensitizer play a significant role in the performance of the DSSC. The theoretical understanding of these charge transfer processes is therefore essential to improving the light harvesting, charge injection and charge separation capabilities of the sensitizer complex. The different electron spin density distributions in the cationic and excited states of the dyes, 1–5 are here examined to provide insights into the nature of these charge-transfer processes.
The calculated atomic charges and electronic spin densities of complexes 1–5 in the molecular, cationic and triplet-excited states are presented in Table 3. In the molecular (ground) state, the Ru atom was calculated as being positively charged with atomic charges of about 1.17–1.19 in 1–4 and 1.33 in 5. The thiocyanato ligand has a total charge of around −0.93 to 1.03 in all the complexes while the total charges on Rgroup are positive when alkyl group, R- is any of H, Me or tBu (complexes 1–3) , and negative for R = COOH (complexes 4–5). In most instances, the polypyridine ligand is negatively charged except (+0.06) in complex 4.

Comparison of the atomic charges and spin densities in the molecular ground state with those in either the mono-cationic or excited states reveals that the oxidation of the chromophore removes one electron with the excess spin localized on the thiocyanato ligand and the Ru atom. Photoexcitation results in Ru/NCS− → polypyridyl charge transfer with the excited electron localized on the polypyridyl ligand. This would appear to be in accordance with the calculated electronic structures of 1–5 which indicates the Ru/NCS−- character of highest-energy occupied orbitals and polypyridyl- character lowest-energy unoccupied orbitals. It can then be conjectured that the electron spin density distributions can be used to sufficiently predict and characterize the charge transfer processes that occur upon oxidation or photoexcitation of the dyes, Table 3.
As mentioned above, the electron-spin density however adequately describes the charge transfer processes occurring after oxidation or photoexcitation of the sensitizer dyes. In the cationic states of complexes 1–4, the Ru metal centre and the thiocyanato ligand exhibit spin densities of about 0.35 and 0.65 respectively while the cumulative spin densities on all other groups approach zero. A small exception was found for the cycloquaterpyridine ligand in the mono-cationic state of 5 on which a 0.15 spin electron density is localized. It can then be concluded that the oxidation of 1–5 removes an electron from the Ru and NCS− moieties. Similarly, the calculated electron spin distributions in the triplet excited states of 1–5 indicate that spin density on the Ru/NCS− moieties is approximately one as well as a spin density of about one localized on the quaterpyridine ligand. The triplet excited states can therefore be related to a charge transfer process between Ru/NCS− moiety and the polypyridine ligands.
3.3 Spectroscopic properties
Exploration of the electronic absorption spectra of photosensitizer complexes is of utmost importance in attempts to improve their sunlight conversion efficiencies. The electronic absorptions of 1–5 and cationic 1 (1+) in methanol were calculated using the TD-DFT method. The solvation effects were included using the PCM model and the hybrid B3LYP functional was used in all the TD-DFT calculations. The calculated transition energies (eV/nm) and oscillator strengths (f) of selected absorptions are presented together with available experimental absorption spectral features27 in Table 4 (see Table S3–S8 for detailed information regarding the calculated absorption spectra). The absorption spectra of the sensitizers are presented in Fig. 2 and 3 after simulated with Gaussian functions. The calculated electronic spectrum for each complex is presented separately in Fig. S1–S6.

 Fig. 2  Simulated absorption spectra in methanol for complexes 1–5 obtained using the TD-DFT/B3LYP approach with the PCM solvation model. 
 Fig. 3  Simulated absorption spectra in methanol for complex 1 and its univalent cationic state (1+) obtained using the TD-DFT/B3LYP approach with the PCM solvation model. 
The analogous complexes, 1–3, were calculated as having four prominent absorption bands in the region between 250 and 900 nm, Fig. 2. The lowest-energy peak at about 820 nm is dominated by the HOMO → LUMO excitation (Tables S3–S5) in the visible region. Two intense peaks were calculated to be at 658 nm and 506 nm in agreement with experimental values of 637 and 515 nm for trans-[Ru(t−BuL)(NCS)2],27 respectively. Analysis of the electronic structures of the complexes indicates the three absorption bands originate from [d(Ru) + π(NCS)] → π*(quaterpyridine) charge transfer processes, labelled as MLCT and L'LCT processes (ligand'-to-ligand charge transfer, here L′ stands for thiocyanate and L for quaterpyridine). A stronger band was calculated to be at 337 nm comparable to an experimental peak at 327 nm.27 This peak corresponds to the π → π* transition mainly localized on the quaterpyridine ligand (Intra-ligand charge transfer, ILCT).
The spectral calculations on the model complex trans-[Ru(MeL)(NCS)2] (labeled as 2 in our work), representing experimentally synthesized complex trans-[Ru(t−BuL)(NCS)2] (labeled as 3), were carried out by Barolo and co-workers.27 The absorptions calculated at 731 and 539 nm are comparable to experimental values of 637 and 515 nm, respectively, which were assigned to MLCT/L'LCT transitions. Apparently, our calculated results agree with these calculated results but yield better agreement with experimental spectral values.
In comparison to 1, the introduction of the carboxyl groups into 4 results in a large red shift of the lower-energy bands, as seen in Fig. 2, Table 4 and Table S6. Two visible-region peaks were calculated at 550 and 710 nm in 4. Chromophores 4 and 5 differ in that they possess open- and closed-ring polypyridyl ligands respectively. This makes their calculated absorption spectra quite different as seen in Fig. 2. Sensitizer 5 exhibits a very broad and intense absorption in the visible region of 480–620 nm, accompanied with modest ultraviolet and weak NIR bands. As far as the relative intensity and width of the visible absorption bands are concerned, complex 5 is apparently the best sensitizer candidate among the 1–5 series of complexes suggested for light harvesting in the DSSCs.
The energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals of 1–5 in methanol are presented in Fig. S7. The values of the HOMO–LUMO gaps in these complexes are also shown. The anatase molecular cluster, (TiO2)38, representing the semiconductor electrode was calculated at the same theory level to have its HOMO at −8.01 eV and LUMO at −3.62 eV corresponding to a gap of 4.39 eV. The energy levels of the frontier orbitals of this anatase cluster (TiO2)38 reveals the HOMO at −6.55 eV and the LUMO at −2.77 eV at the B3LYP/3-21G* level in aqueous solution.7,27,86 Our systematic calculations on a series of TiO2 anatase clusters (Table S9) show that many factors, such as geometries of clusters, basis sets, as well as the solvent-effect models and solvents used affect the energy levels of the molecular anatase cluster. Among them, the starting geometry is predominant in determining the energy levels of the cluster. In DSSC, the sensitizer absorbs light and the excited electron is pumped into the unoccupied orbitals. And then photogenerated electron flows into conduction band of the semiconductor electrode through electronic coupling induced charge transfer processes. The lowest-energy absorption and the lower-energy intense visible absorption are depicted in Fig. S7. From a frontier orbital energy levels- perspective, it is therefore possible to inject electrons from the excited states of these ruthenium dyes into the conduction band of the anatase semiconductor. It should however be noted that the lowest-energy absorption transition in photosensitizer 5 at 712 nm (Table 4 and S7) has no contribution to the electron injection. These thiocyanato ruthenium complexes can therefore serve as photosensitized candidates for DSSC.
In addition, the electronic spectra of 1 and 1+ are compared in Fig. 3. The loss of an electron in the oxidation process results in significant decreases in the intensities of three high-energy bands. In contrast, the intensity of the lowest-energy absorption band at around 828 nm in the NIR region is increased spectacularly, Table 4 and S8. The pronounced band at 828 nm in the absorption spectrum of 1+ is comparable to the experimental peak at 775 nm in the absorption spectra of the cis-[Ru(L1′′)2(NCS)2] (L1′′ = 4,4′-bis(carboxyvinyl)-2,2′-bipyridine, K8) cationic species.30 The calculated results indicate that 1+ has rather weak visible absorption bands suggesting it would have limited use in the photosensitization role in the visible region.
3.4 
          Redox properties
For the reaction, Dye + Fc+ (ferrocenium) = Dye+ + Fc (ferrocene), the following equations are used87–90: E0(gas) = −ΔG(gas)/F(1) E0(sol) = −ΔΔG(sol)/F(2) ΔΔG(sol) = ΔG(gas) + ΔG(sol)(3)
In the above equations, the thermodynamic data, ΔG(gas), were obtained from the vibrational frequency calculations carried out in the gas phase. The solvation free energies, ΔG(sol), were calculated with PCM solvation model in the Gaussian 03 suite. E0 is the oxidation potential of above reaction, corresponding to the free energies of ΔG(gas) and ΔΔG(sol) in the gas phase and methanol solution, respectively. And F is Faraday constant, 96485 C·mol−1.
The calculated E0(sol) redox potentials of complexes 1–5 are presented in Table 5. When the L1 basis sets (Table S10) were employed, the oxidation potentials of 1–5 in the gas phase were calculated in the range from −0.577 to −1.145 V. The inclusion of solvent effects in the theoretical model greatly increases these values to between 0.106 and 0.336 V, Table 5. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experimental work has shown that complex 3 exhibits a quasi-reversible metal-centered oxidation at 0.38 V vs. the Fc/Fc+ reference couple.27 This is in good agreement with our calculated value of 0.336 V in the solvent phase but much higher than the −1.145 V in the gas phase. Apparently, inclusion of solvent effects is extremely important in correctly estimating the redox potential of these complexes. The oxidation potentials of the complexes were calculated using the SC-ECP/PCM and ZORA/COSMO models implemented in the Gaussian 03 and ADF codes, respectively. The calculated oxidation potentials are labelled as E0(SC/PCM) and E0(ZORA/COSMO) respectively, in Table S11. The discrepancy between the calculated E0(SC/PCM) and E0(ZORA/COSMO) results, Table S11, demonstrates that the combination of solvent-effect, relativistic effects models and quality of basis sets have rather significant effects on the calculated redox potentials.

The effects of basis sets on the calculated redox potentials were evaluated for 1–5. In comparison to the double-ζ L1 basis sets, the L11 basis is formed by the addition of a set of diffuse functions while the L2 basis is a triple-ζ basis. With respect to E0(sol) in Table 5, increasing the quality of the orbital basis sets from L1 to L2 results in more positive oxidation potentials for 1–5 while the addition of diffuse functions to L1 in creating the L11 basis sets increases the E0(sol) of 2, 3 and 4, but decreases that of 1 and keeps the calculated oxidation potential constant of 5. It is worth noting that the E0(sol) of 3 estimated at 0.387 V with the L2 basis sets is in good agreement with experimental 0.38 V, suggesting the values obtained with this triple-ζ basis are somewhat much more reliable.27
On the basis of the reaction Dye* + Fc+ = Dye+ + Fc, the oxidation potential of excited state of dye was calculated as seen in Table 5. For 1–5, the calculated results of E0(sol) range from −0.093 to −0.938 V, in which oxidation potentials of 3*/3+ were estimated to be at −0.938 V, similar to previously reported experimental values of [Ru(L0)2(NCS)2] (−0.95 V vs.Fc/Fc+), [Ru(L1)2(NCS)2] (−1.35 V), [Ru(L1′)2(NCS)2] (−1.35 V), [Ru(L2)2(NCS)2] (−1.30 V), cis-[Ru(L1′′)2(NCS)2] (−1.24 V) and [Ru(L1)(L1′′′)(NCS)2] (−1.30 V), where L0 = 4,4′-bis(carboxylic acid)-2,2′-biquinoline, L1 = 4,4′-bis(carboxylic acid)-2,2′-bipyridine, L1′ = 4,7-bis(carboxylic acid)-1,10-phenanthroline, L1′′ = 4,4′-bis(carboxyvinyl)-2,2′-bipyridine, L1′′′ = 4,4′-bis(p-hexyloxystyryl)-2,2′-bipyridine, and L2 = 4,4′,4′′-tris(carboxylic acid)-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine.30–32
For comparison and method standardization, other ruthenium dyes were also taken into account in the calculations, including cis-[Ru(L1)2(X−)2] (X = NCS (6), Cl (7) and CN (8)), cis-[Ru(L1′)2(NCS)2] (9), [NH4][Ru(L2)(NCS)3] (10) and [Ru(L2)(NCS)3]− (11). Examination of Table 5, indicates that inclusion of counter ion is important for accurate estimation on oxidation potential as seen in the calculated oxidation potentials of 10 and 11. The calculated E0(sol) for complexes 3 and 6–10 are compared to available experimental values in Fig. S8. It can be seen that there appears to be a general trend of improvement in the calculated values from the L1 → L11 → L2 basis sets. The calculated potentials of 3, 7 and 8 are in quite sufficient agreement with the experimental values, while those of 9 and 10 show a tendency to approach experimental values as the quality of the basis sets is improved.
4. Conclusions
The geometrical features, electronic structures, spectroscopic properties and redox potentials of five photosensitizers, complexes 1–5, have been explored with scalar relativistic density functional theory. The following conclusions can be drawn from this work.
The geometries of the complexes were optimized and characterized as local minima on their potential energy surfaces using the frequency analysis. Although the quaterpyridine ligand of 1–4 remains planar in all the states, the CN–Ru angle, (representing the SCN → Ru coordination), approaches 180° on going from the molecular ground state to the mono-cationic and excited states. In contrast, complex 5 has a curved surface as a result of its cycloquaterpyridine ligand. The charge transfer processes occurring upon oxidation or photoexcitation of 1–5 were characterized using the electron spin density distributions in the cationic and excited states. It is demonstrated that the one-electron oxidation process takes place in the Ru/NCS moieties while the triplet excited state is due to MLCT/L'LCT charge transfer.
Analysis of the electronic structures and calculated electronic absorption spectra revealed that the thiocyanato ruthenium complexes, 1–5, can serve as photosensitizer candidates for DSSC from an electronic coupling-charge transfer perspective. Two MLCT/L'LCT bands of 3 were calculated to at 652 and 506 nm using the TD-DFT method in agreement with experimental values of 637 and 515, respectively.27 The addition of two carboxylic groups into 4 causes a bathochromic shift of these two MLCT/L'LCT absorptions relative to those of 1, 2 and 3. Complex 5 with cycloquaterpyridine ligand was calculated to show a broader and more intense MLCT/L'LCT peak between 480 and 620 nm. As far as absorption in the visible region is concerned, the theoretically designed complex 5 is a promising sensitizer for DSSC. A pronounced band at 828 nm was calculated for the lowest energy excitation of 1+, supporting the previous assignment in cis-[Ru(L1′′)2(NCS)2] (L1′′ = 4,4′-bis(carboxyvinyl)-2,2′-bipyridine, K8) cation species in transient absorption experiment.30
In addition, the redox potentials of 1–5 were calculated, together with several famous photosensitizers 6–11. It was shown that the inclusion of solvation effects is essential in accurately estimating the redox potentials. For charged systems, the inclusion of the counter ions is suggested when attempting to calculate the redox potentials. The choice of solvent models and the quality of basis sets also affect the calculated oxidation potentials.
