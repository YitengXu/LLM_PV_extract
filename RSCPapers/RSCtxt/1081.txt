A toxic and hazardous potassium cyanide (KCN) solution is commonly used as a selective etchant to remove Cu2−x(S,Se) from CZTSSe and CIGS thin films. Herein, we report the selective removal of Cu2−x(S,Se) compounds from kesterite CZTSSe thin films using a mixture of ethylenediamine and 2-mercaptoethanol, a safer chemical mixture than KCN. We found that Cu2−xS and kesterite CZTS nanocrystals dissolve in this mixture in seconds and 6 hours, respectively, while wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals do not dissolve even after 6 hours. Etching CZTSSe thin films containing small amounts of Cu2−x(S,Se) phases for 20 minutes removes the Cu2−x(S,Se) phases completely.
Introduction
Kesterite, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), and the related alloys Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) are prospective candidates as environmentally sustainable light absorbing materials for low cost thin-film solar cells because they are composed of earth-abundant elements with low toxicity.1–3 CZTS and CZTSSe have optical properties well-suited for use in solar cells, including a direct and easily tunable band gap energy, from 1 eV to 1.5 eV, by adjusting the S-to-Se ratio, and a high absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1) in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.4–6 The theoretical maximum efficiency for single junction solar cells based on CZTS is near 30% and is comparable to the theoretical maximum efficiencies for silicon and other commercialized thin film solar cells based on copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and CdTe.4–8 CZTSSe-based thin-film solar cells have been developing rapidly during the last decade and have already achieved a record efficiency of 12.7%.9 This rapid progress in the laboratory now motivates the development of scalable techniques compatible with industrial mass production.
Despite promising properties and rapid development, the highest power conversion efficiency of CZTSSe based solar cells is still far below that of commercial thin-film solar cells based on CIGS (21.7% record efficiency)10 or CdTe (19.6% record efficiency).3 Among the factors responsible for this underperformance is the formation of impurity phases during the synthesis of CZTSSe thin films.11–13 Impurity phases can be present on the surface, near the back contact (e.g., Mo), or within the absorber layer and usually form during annealing in S and Se vapour that is common for the synthesis of CZTSSe films. The impurity phases located near the back contact have been traced to the reaction of the CZTSSe film with Mo.12,13 To avoid this parasitic decomposition reaction and to improve back contact stability, diffusion barrier layers such as i-ZnO, TiN, and TiB2 have been introduced between the Mo and the CZTSSe film.12,14–17 The impurity phases located on the surface of the CZTSSe film can be removed by chemical etching. While several etchants have been developed to selectively remove impurity phases such as Zn(S,Se), Cu2Sn(S,Se)3, and Sn(S,Se)x,11,18–21 most have focused on removing the conductive Cu2−x(S,Se) phase, a common cause of electrical shunts across the solar cell electrodes.22 Specifically, potassium cyanide (KCN) has emerged as a widely used etchant to remove Cu2−x(S,Se) phases from CIGS thin films.22 The efficiencies of solar cells made from CIGS thin films etched in KCN increased dramatically as compared to those made from films that were not etched in KCN.22 Similar improvements have been reported for CZTSe thin film solar cells.11,23 However, KCN is toxic and, in some circumstances, reactions of KCN can produce the highly toxic gas HCN.24,25 Its use, particularly in mass production, is both a safety and cost concern. A less toxic chemical that etches Cu2−x(S,Se) selectively over CZTSSe is desirable. Recently, Webber et al. reported the remarkable ability of 1,2-ethylendithiol and 1,2-ethylenediamine mixtures for dissolving V2VI3 chalcogenides (V: As, Sb, and Bi; VI: S, Se, and Te) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.26,27 Inspired by this report, we hypothesized that this mixture might selectively remove the Cu2−x(S,Se) phases in CZTSSe thin films at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
Herein, we report the development of a selective chemical etchant for Cu2−x(S,Se) over CZTS or CZTSSe that is much less toxic than KCN. The etchant is based on a mixture of mercapto-alcohol and ethylenediamine. To demonstrate the efficacy of this selective etchant, we compare the dissolution rates of kesterite, wurtzite CZTS, and Cu2−xS in a mixture of 2-mercaptoethanol and ethylenediamine, hereafter referred as the etchant solution. Surprisingly, the Cu2−xS nanocrystals dissolve within a few seconds in the solution, while wurtzite CZTS persists for several hours. Exploiting this significant difference in etching rates, we show that this etchant mixture also selectively removes Cu2−x(S,Se) from thin films comprising CZTS (or CZTSSe) and Cu2−x(S,Se).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the optical absorption spectra from (a) Cu2−xS, (b) kesterite CZTS, and (c) wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals dispersed in the etchant solution after 1 minute, 2 hours, and 6 hours. The photographs in each inset show the visual appearance of the respective dispersion after 1 minute, 2 hours, and 6 hours. Before the nanocrystals are dispersed, the etchant solution appears clear and light yellow (similar to the photograph labelled 6 hours in Fig. 1(a)). Remarkably, the etchant solution does not change its colour when Cu2−xS nanocrystals are added. Nearly all of the Cu2−xS nanocrystals dissolve within seconds, with only a few specks of agglomerates remaining after 1 minute (see the bottom of the vial in Fig. 1(a) after 1 minute). The initial dispersions of wurtzite or kesterite are opaque and black. After six hours, the kesterite CZTS nanoparticles completely dissolve, resulting in a light yellow solution, whereas, the wurtzite CZTS dispersion remains black and opaque, even after six hours. The optical absorption from kesterite CZTS nanocrystals in the etchant solution after 1 minute and 2 hours is higher and noisier than the absorption from the etchant without the nanocrystals. This is because nearly all the light is absorbed. Once all the kesterite CZTS nanocrystals have dissolved, the absorption deceases and the spectrum of the etchant solution is recovered. Wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals remain dispersed in the solution and absorb nearly all the light in this spectral range even after 6 hours. We conclude that the etching (dissolution) rate of Cu2−xS is the highest followed by kesterite CZTS, and the etching rate of wurtzite CZTS is the slowest.
 Fig. 1  Optical absorption spectra of (a) Cu2−xS, (b) kesterite CZTS, and (c) wurtzite CZTS nanocrystal in the etchant solution after 1 minute, 2 hours, and 6 hours. Inset photographs show the visual appearance of the respective solutions after 1 minute, 2 hours, and 6 hours. The sharp features around 490 nm and 690 nm are due to source switching in the spectrophotometer. 
Encouraged by the dramatic differences in these dissolution rates, we designed an experiment to determine whether Cu2−xS phases could be removed selectively from films containing a mixture of Cu2−xS and kesterite CZTS. We made the films by annealing, in sulphur, coatings cast from nanocrystal dispersions as described in the Experimental section. To form films that contained both CZTS and Cu2−xS, coatings were drop cast from nanocrystal dispersions containing both wurtzite CZTS and Cu2−xS nanocrystals.

Fig. 2 shows plan-view FE-SEM images of these annealed films before (Fig. 2(a)) and after (Fig. 2(b)) etching in the etchant solution for 20 minutes. Hexagonal crystals with sizes ranging from 500 nm to 2.5 μm are clearly visible on the surface of the film before it was etched. This hexagonal crystal habit is typical of CuS and the hexagonal form (so called high-chalcocite phase) of Cu2S (Fig. 2(a)).28 The areal density of hexagonal crystals on the annealed thin film is approximately 10−2 hexagonal crystals per μm2. The annealed thin film is composed of 0.2–1 μm wide grains with some cracks and voids. The hexagon-shaped crystals are removed after the film is immersed in the etchant solution for 20 minutes (Fig. 2(b)). With the exception of the absence of hexagonal crystals, the morphology and microstructure after etching is similar to that observed before etching. Selective removal of copper sulphide crystals from the film over kesterite CZTS is consistent with the nanocrystal dissolution experiments shown in Fig. 1. The etchant solution etches copper sulphides faster than kesterite CZTS.

Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns from the annealed films before and after etching in the etchant solution for 20 minutes. The XRD pattern recorded before etching shows strong diffraction peaks located at 28.5°, 47.3°, and 56.1°, which correspond to the kesterite CZTS structure (ICDD-ref.: 00-034-1246), as well as weak diffraction peaks at 29.2°, 31.8°, 47.8°, and 52.8°, which correspond to the hexagonal copper sulphide structure (ICDD-ref.: 98-000-0176). Other diffraction peaks can all be assigned to kesterite CZTS, Mo, or MoS2.29 The copper sulphide diffraction peaks are weak because of the small amounts in the CZTS film. Nevertheless, consistent with the SEM images, the peaks from copper sulphide disappear from the diffraction pattern collected after etching the film in the etchant solution for 20 minutes.
 Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction patterns from annealed films before and after etching in the etchant solution for 20 minutes. CZTS and copper sulphide diffraction patterns are shown for comparison. 
Finally, we examined the films using confocal Raman microscopy both before and after etching. Specifically, we mapped the spatial distribution of Raman scattering from copper sulphide and kesterite CZTS phases in the annealed thin films before and after etching in the etchant solution for 20 minutes. Raman scattering maps were constructed by filtering all scattering except in a narrow band (±10 cm−1) around the most intense characteristic Raman scattering peaks of Cu2−xS and kesterite CZTS at 475 cm−1 and 338 cm−1, respectively. Raman spectra from CuS and Cu2−xS are indistinguishable. While we refer only to Cu2−xS in the following, both CuS and Cu2−xS contribute to the scattering intensity at 475 cm−1.30

Fig. 4 shows Raman scattering maps for films annealed in S before ((a) Cu2−xS and (b) CZTS)) and after ((c) Cu2−xS and (d) CZTS)) etching. The Raman scattering image for Cu2−xS (475 cm−1) in Fig. 4(a) shows many randomly distributed regions where scattering at 475 cm−1 is very strong. The distribution of these regions on the surface is similar to the distribution of the hexagonal copper sulphide crystals observed with SEM (e.g., Fig. 2(a)) and strongly suggests that these regions have one or more copper sulphide crystals. The Raman scattering map for CZTS (338 cm−1) shows a uniform distribution of CZTS (Fig. 4(b)) and this map does not change significantly after etching (Fig. 4(d)).

Raman scattering images from (a & c) Cu2−xS and (b & d) CZTS were produced by selectively filtering scattering at 475 cm−1 and 338 cm−1, respectively. Representative Raman spectra of CZTSe films (e) before and (f) after etching. In (e) and (f), spectra from two different regions are shown. The Raman spectra labelled Regions (i) and (ii) in (e) are representative of spectra collected from dark (CZTS) and bright orange (Cu2−xS) regions in (a), respectively. The Raman spectra labelled regions (i) and (ii) in (f) are representative of spectra collected from any location on the surface after etching. 
On the other hand, the Raman scattering from copper sulphide at 475 cm−1 (Fig. 4(c)) disappears after etching, suggesting removal of the copper sulphide phases by the etchant solution (see also ESI and Fig. S1†). Fig. 4(e) and (f) show representative spectra from two different regions on the film, before and after etching, respectively. The Raman spectra labelled Region (i) in Fig. 4(e) is representative of spectra collected from regions where there are no copper sulphide grains (i.e., dark regions in Fig. 4(a)), and the spectrum shows a strong peak at 338 cm−1 and weak peak at 278 cm−1, both from CZTS. The Raman spectra labelled Region (ii) in Fig. 4(e) is representative of spectra collected from regions where there are copper sulphide grains (i.e., bright orange regions in Fig. 4(a)). Thus, the spectrum shows a very strong peak at 475 cm−1 (copper sulphides) as well as weak peaks at 264 cm−1 (copper sulphides) and 419 cm−1 (MoS2).1,22 Regardless of the location on the surface, we do not find any peaks at 475 cm−1 after etching (Fig. 4(f)), which is consistent with complete removal of copper sulphides within the detection limits of Raman scattering.
We conducted the same study described above on selenized thin films. Fig. 5 shows the XRD pattern from a coating, initially comprised of CZTS and Cu2−xS nanocrystals, after selenization (labelled as ‘before etching’). The diffraction peaks are shifted to smaller angles with respect to those expected from CZTS and is observed nearly at the diffraction angles expected for CZTSe.31 Specifically, the XRD pattern shows the three strong diffraction peaks corresponding to the (112), (204), and (312) planes in kesterite CZTSe (ICDD-ref.:00-052-0868). This indicates that Se has replaced nearly all the S in the nanocrystals during selenization.31–33 In addition, the XRD pattern shows weak diffractions from copper selenide (ICDD-ref.: 03-065-3562) as well as from Mo and MoSe2. Fig. 5 also shows XRD patterns from CZTSe films before and after etching in the etchant solution for 20 minutes. The two XRD patterns are identical except for diffraction peaks from copper selenide, which are absent in the diffraction pattern collected after etching. Thus, the XRD indicates that copper selenides are removed selectively over CZTSe from the films by the etchant solution.

Raman spectroscopy supports the conclusion that copper scattering maps were constructed by filtering all scattering except in a narrow band (±10 cm−1) around the most intense Raman scattering peaks characteristics of Cu–Se vibrations in CuSe and Cu2−xSe (260 cm−1) and of kesterite CZTSe (196 cm−1). Fig. 6 compares Raman scattering maps for selenized thin films before and after etching. Fig. 6(a) and (c) show the Raman scattering maps for copper selenide before and after etching, respectively, while Fig. 6(b) and (d) show the same for CZTSe. Fig. 6(a) shows that the selenized film contains copper selenide grains scattered randomly on the surface of the film. Comparison of Fig. 6(a) with Fig. 6(c) shows that Raman scattering from copper selenides at 260 cm−1 disappears after etching, while Raman scattering from CZTSe at 196 cm−1 (Fig. 6(b) and (d)) does not change significantly. Fig. 6(e) and (f) show representative Raman spectra before and after etching in the etchant solution, respectively. Again, spectra from two different regions are shown. The Raman spectra labelled Region (i) in Fig. 6(e) is representative of spectra collected from regions where there are no copper selenide grains (i.e., dark regions in Fig. 6(a)). Thus, the spectrum only shows a strong peak at 196 cm−1 and weaker peaks at 173 cm−1 and 230 cm−1, which all correspond to the expected peaks from the kesterite CZTSe. The Raman spectra labelled Region (ii) in Fig. 6(e), on the other hand, is representative of spectra collected from the bright orange regions in Fig. 6(a) and show the copper selenide peak at 260 cm−1.32,33 The CZTSe Raman peaks are observed both before and after etching regardless of where the spectra is collected on the surface indicating that copper selenide phases are removed selectively from the CZTSe film by etching in the etchant solution.

The Raman spectra labelled Regions (i) and (ii) in (f) are representative of spectra collected from any location on the surface after etching. 

Fig. 7 shows the plane view FE-SEM images of the CZTSe thin films containing copper selenide impurity phases before (a) and after (b) etching in the etchant solution. There are many hexagonal copper selenide crystals with sizes ranging from 1 μm to 5 μm protruding from the film.34
 Fig. 7  Plane view FE-SEM images of films (a) before and (b) after etching in etchant solution for 20 minutes. Higher magnification FE-SEM images are shown in the insets. Hexagonal crystals protruding from the surface are copper selenide grains while the remaining large crystals are CZTSSe grains. These copper selenide grains are removed selectively when the film is immersed the etchant solution for 20 minutes. 
We counted approximately 73 hexagonal crystals in a 100 μm × 100 μm, corresponding to an areal density equal to 0.7 × 10−2 hexagonal crystals per μm2, which is similar to the density of copper sulphide hexagonal crystals on the annealed films shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, the hexagonal crystals are removed from the film after etching (Fig. 7(b)).
Conclusions
In summary, we report a new safer etchant, a mixture of ethylenediamine and 2-mercaptoethanol, for facile and selective removal of copper sulphide and copper selenide phases from kesterite CZTS(Se) thin films at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Copper sulphides and copper selenides are completely and selectively removed by immersing the films in the etchant for 20 minutes. This etchant may prove an effective substitute for the widely used toxic and hazardous KCN to remove copper sulphide and copper selenide impurity phases commonly encountered while forming thin films of CIGS, CZTS, and CZTSe for solar cells. We showed, using various analytical methods, that the new etchant, like its toxic alternative, KCN, removes the Cu2−x(S,Se) phases from CZTS films. It is well known that removal of these impurity phases with KCN improves solar cell efficiencies and is sometimes the difference between working and non-functional devices.22 The new approach is greener, simpler, safer and at least as effective in removing Cu2−x(S,Se) phases as the current KCN based etching approach.
Finally, these results suggest that this etchant could be effective in removing Cu2−xSe from CIGS. It may also be effective in etching metal–tellurium compounds. While we do not yet understand the origin of this selectivity at the atomistic level, one possibility is that Cu complexation with etchant molecules is much faster and facile than complexation with the other cations (i.e., Zn and Sn). In CZTS and CZTSe, the surface of the nanocrystals (or grains) may get depleted of Cu quickly, but once the surface becomes rich in Zn and Sn, etching essentially stops. Testing this mechanistic hypothesis will be the subject of a future study.

Synthesis of Cu2−xS, wurtzite CZTS, and kesterite CZTS nanocrystals
To synthesize wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals, 1.7 × 10−3 mol (0.3394 g) of (Cu(CO2CH3)2·H2O), 1.0 × 10−3 mol (0.2195 g) of Zn(CO2CH3)2·2H2O, and 1.0 × 10−3 mol (0.1935 g) of SnCl2, 4.0 × 10−3 mol (0.3045 g) of thiourea, and 3.4 × 10−3 mol (0.4088 g) of sodium thiglycolate were added to 30 mL of ethylene glycol under stirring. This solution was sonicated for 30 minutes before loading it in a Teflon vial and then placed inside a SiC sleeve of a commercial Anton Parr Multiwave Pro microwave reactor. The microwave was programmed to heat the samples from room temperature to 160 °C in 15 minutes. The microwave power during this temperature ramp was 300 mW. Following the ramp procedure, the temperature was maintained at 160 °C in 5 minutes, and after that, the power was turned off. The products in the vial were allowed to cool naturally to 55 °C before being removing the vial from the microwave reactor. The microwave is equipped with a turn table, which spins at 2 revolutions per minute (RPM) during the entire procedure. The temperature was measured using an infrared sensor, and the reaction media enclosed in the Teflon vials were not stirred.
To synthesize kesterite CZTS nanocrystals, the same amounts of (Cu(CO2CH3)2·H2O), Zn(CO2CH3)2·2H2O, and SnCl2, as in the synthesis of wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals, were used. However, the total thiourea added to the reactant solution was 2.46 × 10−2 mol (1.8726 g), and sodium thioglycolate was omitted from the synthesis. All other procedures were the same as in wurtzite CZTS nanocrystal synthesis.
To synthesize Cu2−xS nanocrystals, 2.0 × 10−3 mol (0.2084 g) of CuCl, 1.0 × 10−3 mol (0.0761 g) of CH4N2S, and 1.0 × 10−3 mol (0.1114 g) of C2H3O2SNa were added to 30 mL C2H6O2 under stirring. This mixture was then sonicated and loaded into the microwave reactor as described above for CZTS nanocrystal synthesis. All other procedures were the same as in the wurtzite and kesterite CZTS nanocrystals synthesis.
X-ray diffraction patterns collected from the nanocrystalline products from each respective synthesis (ESI Fig. S2†) matched the expected powder diffraction from wurtzite CZTS, kesterite CZTS and Cu2−xS (including CuS and Cu2S). Impurity phases such as ZnS, SnS2, and Cu2SnS3 were not detected within the detection limitations of XRD. The average sizes estimated from the Scherrer equation applied to the full width at half maximum of the most intense peak in each pattern were 9 nm, 3 nm, and 15 nm, for wurtzite CZTS, kesterite CZTS, and Cu2−xS nanocrystals, respectively.
Precursor coating
Wurtzite CZTS and Cu2−xS nanocrystal dispersions were prepared by mixing 800 μL of 44 ± 10 mg ml−1 wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals dispersed in ethylene glycol, with 200 μL of 36 ± 10 mg ml−1 Cu2−xS nanocrystals, also dispersed in ethylene glycol. The mixed dispersion was centrifuged at 8500 RPM for 15 minutes. Following, the supernatant was discarded and 5 mL of deionized water was added to form stable aqueous nanocrystals dispersion. The Mo-coated substrates (700 nm thick Mo layer) were coated with nanocrystals by drop casting 400 μL of the dispersion onto a 6.25 cm2 area defined by a metal frame followed by drying at room temperature for 2 days.35 Specifically, we mixed Cu2−xS and wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals and casted coatings on Mo-coated soda lime glass substrates. The wurtzite CZTS was chosen due to its slowest etching rate in comparison to kesterite CZTS, as it was shown on results and discussion session. The coatings were heated for 10 minutes at 200 °C in air to remove any remaining solvent. The drop cast coating was very porous and its surface was rough. This porous and rough coating was compacted using a hydraulic press at 6000 kPa for 15 seconds (Caver AutoPellet 3887) as described by Williams et al.35 A thin sheet of Kapton film was placed on the coatings to prevent the coating from adhering to the press.
Cu2−x(S,Se) and kesterite CZTSSe thin films
The compact coating was placed in pre-cleaned quartz ampoule (1 cm inner diameter and 9 cm length) with solid sulphur (10 mg) or selenium (11 mg). Following, the ampoule was evacuated to 10−6 Torr and flamed-sealed. The sealed quartz ampoule at room temperature was loaded into a furnace pre-heated to 600 °C. After keeping the ampoules and its contents at 600 °C for 1 hour, the furnace was turned off and the ampoule was allowed to cool naturally to 150 °C before removing it from the furnace.31,36 It took approximately 4 hours for the furnace to cool to 150 °C.
Etching
The etching solution was prepared by adding 1 mL of 2-mercaptoethanol to 4 mL of ethylenediamine in a 20 mL vial at room temperature, without stirring. About 20 mg of dried Cu2−xS, kesterite CZTS, or wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals were weighed, placed in this solution and observed visually and using optical absorption to determine if the nanocrystals had dissolved. Thin films cast from nanocrystal dispersions and then annealed in S or Se were also placed in this solution for a period of 20 minutes. At the end of these 20 minutes, the film was taken out the solution and dried on a heating plate at 100 °C for 10 minutes. Rinsing was very effective in removing any residual etchant as confirmed by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy (ESI Fig. S3 and S4†). All etching experiments were conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. After the heat treatment at 600 °C, wurtzite CZTS was converted to kesterite CZTS.
Characterization
The optical absorbance of the etchant solutions including the nanocrystals was measured using Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy (Agilent 8453) at room temperature. The nanocrystals and the thin films were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), before and after etching. XRD was recorded with a Bruker D8 Discover system that employed a Cu Kα X-ray source, 0.8 mm beam collimator, and Hi-Star 2D area detector. The spot size of the X-ray beam on the sample was 800 μm. Surface morphology of the thin film was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM JEOL 6500, at 10 keV) before and after etching. The Raman scattering from the films was imaged, before and after etching, using confocal Raman microscopy. Specifically, a Witec alpha300R confocal Raman microscope equipped with a UHTS300 spectrometer and a DV401 CCD detector operating at −60 °C was used. The excitation source was an argon ion laser at 532 nm (average power 0.38 mW) and the excitation spot is approximately 300 nm. Raman scattering was collected in the backscattering geometry. The scattered light was collected, filtered to remove the contributions at the excitation wavelength and dispersed using a 600 lines per mm grating. Raman scattering images were acquired from selected 100 μm × 100 μm regions.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Optical absorption spectra of (a) Cu2−xS, (b) kesterite CZTS, and (c) wurtzite CZTS nanocrystal in the etchant solution after 1 minute, 2 hours, and 6 hours. Inset photographs show the visual appearance of the respective solutions after 1 minute, 2 hours, and 6 hours. The sharp features around 490 nm and 690 nm are due to source switching in the spectrophotometer.	 

 	Fig. 2  Plan view FE-SEM images of films (a) before and (b) after etching in the etchant solution for 20 minutes. Higher magnification FE-SEM images are shown in the insets.	 

 	Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction patterns from annealed films before and after etching in the etchant solution for 20 minutes. CZTS and copper sulphide diffraction patterns are shown for comparison.	 

 	Fig. 4  Raman scattering maps from annealed CZTS films (a & b) before (c & d) after etching in e solution. Raman scattering images from (a & c) Cu2−xS and (b & d) CZTS were produced by selectively filtering scattering at 475 cm−1 and 338 cm−1, respectively. Representative Raman spectra of CZTSe films (e) before and (f) after etching. In (e) and (f), spectra from two different regions are shown. The Raman spectra labelled Regions (i) and (ii) in (e) are representative of spectra collected from dark (CZTS) and bright orange (Cu2−xS) regions in (a), respectively. The Raman spectra labelled regions (i) and (ii) in (f) are representative of spectra collected from any location on the surface after etching.	 

 	Fig. 5  XRD patterns for CZTSe thin film containing a small fraction of Cu2−xSe before and after etching in the etchant solution for 20 minutes. CuSe, Cu2Se and CZTSe diffraction patterns are also shown for comparison.	 

 	Fig. 6  Raman scattering maps from annealed CZTSe films (a & b) before (c & d) after etching in etchant solution. Raman scattering images from (a & c) Cu2−xSe and (b & d) CZTSe were produced by selectively filtering scattering at 260 cm−1 and 196 cm−1, respectively. Representative Raman spectra of CZTSe films (e) before and (f) after etching. In (e) and (f), spectra from two different regions are shown. The Raman spectra labelled Regions (i) and (ii) in (e) are representative of spectra collected from dark (CZTSe) and bright orange (Cu2−xSe) regions in (a), respectively. The Raman spectra labelled Regions (i) and (ii) in (f) are representative of spectra collected from any location on the surface after etching.	 

 	Fig. 7  Plane view FE-SEM images of films (a) before and (b) after etching in etchant solution for 20 minutes. Higher magnification FE-SEM images are shown in the insets. Hexagonal crystals protruding from the surface are copper selenide grains while the remaining large crystals are CZTSSe grains. These copper selenide grains are removed selectively when the film is immersed the etchant solution for 20 minutes.
