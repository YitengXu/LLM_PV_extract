    , Accepted 25th November 2017First published on 27th November 2017AbstractThree novel anthracene-based organic dyes, denoted as AN-11, AN-12 and AN-14, were synthesized for outdoor and indoor dye-sensitized solar cell studies. Laboratory-fabricated small cells, as well as rigid and flexible modules, were prepared and analyzed for their photovoltaic performance under simulated outdoor and indoor conditions. Owing to the panchromatic absorption of visible light, the AN-11 module gives rise to a very black color and superior photovoltaic performance. Significantly, the AN-11 rigid module with a large active area of 26.80 cm2 outperforms its Z907 counterpart under indoor conditions, reaching an overall efficiency of 11.94% under 1000 lux of T5 fluorescent light. In addition, the AN-11 module exhibits good stability during weather stress tests. Finally, the AN-11 dye is cost-effective and our studies show that the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells is not affected upon lowering the synthetic cost and increasing the synthetic scale.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been widely studied in recent decades owing to the low production costs, simple manufacturing processes and vivid colours of the dyes.1–4 Numerous dyes have been reported to achieve high photovoltaic performance in DSSCs under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight (or one-sun), including ruthenium complexes,5–9 zinc porphyrins10–16 and metal-free organic dyes.17–19 Among these dyes, organic dyes have been widely studied owing to the advantages of possibly higher extinction coefficients (than those of the ruthenium complexes), versatile molecular design and low synthetic costs. For the purposes of efficient charge transfer and electron injection, chemical structures of the organic dyes are often designed in a donor–π–acceptor (or D–π–A) fashion. In addition to the obvious roles of the donors and acceptors, the π-spacers also play an important part of light harvesting.20,21 Many π-spacers have been reported to be useful, including EDOT (C217),22 thiophene (JK-46),23 fluorene (S3),24 perylene (GJ-BP)25 and arene derivatives (LD4),26 among others. Additionally, anthracene has also been used as a good π-spacer in porphyrin and organic dyes.12,27–31
In addition to converting solar energy under one-sun irradiation for outdoor applications, DSSCs have the potential to perform very efficiently under low light conditions for indoor applications. To explore this possibility, several studies have been conducted in the past few years.32–39 Among them, we reported a cost-effective and fairly efficient anthracene-based dye (AN-3) for DSSCs under indoor conditions.34 In the said work, a large and flexible module (active area = 36.00 cm2) sensitized with the AN-3 dye attained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.45% under 1000 lux of T5 fluorescent light, slightly inferior to the 5.67% PCE of the Z907 module.
In this work, we modified both the dyes and the solar modules to achieve a higher PCE. For the dyes, modification of the AN-3 dye yielded three new photo-sensitizers, denoted as AN-11, AN-12, and AN-14. The chemical structures of the new AN dyes are shown in Scheme 1. For AN-11, we modified the AN-3 dye34 with an additional benzothiadiazole (BTDA) group which serves as a stronger electron-withdrawing motif. BTDA has been well reported as a good acceptor in the literature.18,40–42 The benefits of using BTDA include boosting the charge transfer processes, extending the π-conjugation, and enhancing the light-harvesting ability of the dyes. With BTDA, one could expect a stronger push–pull tendency of the new AN dyes and, hopefully, a higher PCE of the devices. For AN-12 and AN-14, an N,N-diarylamino-anthryl group is used as the common donor, and a cyano-acrylic acid or a carboxylic acid is employed as the anchoring group, respectively. N,N-Diarylamino-anthryl groups are effective electron-donating groups and they have been successfully used as the donor for several efficient organic and porphyrin dyes.39,43,44 Cyano-acrylic acid and carboxylic acid are widely used anchoring groups with electron-withdrawing properties.20,45–47 Based on this design, all AN dyes should have a good push–pull tendency, and a comparison should provide insight into the molecular design of photo-sensitizers for indoor applications.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of the AN dyes. 
For the devices, three types of solar cells/modules were prepared, including lab-made small cells with an active area of 0.25 cm2, R26 rigid modules with an active area of 26.80 cm2, and F17 flexible modules with an active area of 19.80 cm2. The small cells were prepared in our laboratory and the modules were manufactured by Taiwan DSC PV Ltd. (or TDP). For the small cells, photovoltaic measurements were carried out under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM1.5G sunlight to imitate outdoor conditions, as well as under 200, 600, and 1000 lux of T5 or LED light to represent indoor conditions of a dim room, a common office, and a convenience store, respectively. All AN dyes were examined in the small cells and the most superior dye was chosen to sensitize the modules for further tests. For the modules, only indoor conditions were tested.
As such, our study showed that an R26 module sensitized with the AN-11 dye achieved a PCE of 11.94% under 1000 lux of T5 fluorescent light, outperforming its Z907 counterpart. Fig. 1 displays the pictures of AN-11 in a THF solution and as powder, and the solar devices sensitized with AN-11.

As shown in the figure, the UV-visible spectrum of AN-11 is consistent with that of the AN-3 parent with deviations. For instance, AN-3 and AN-11 both give rise to one overlapped absorption band at around 500 nm with similar molar absorptivities. However, the absorption maximum of AN-11 (λmax = 528 nm) is red-shifted from that of AN-3 (λmax = 499 nm). This deviation may be attributed to more conjugated double bonds in the chemical structure. For AN-12 and AN-14, the spectral features are quite different from those of AN-3 and AN-11. For example, AN-12 (433 and 515 nm) and AN-14 (438 and 517 nm) exhibit two well-resolved and weaker absorption bands. This difference may be related to the different electron-donating groups and/or the electron-acceptors/anchors in the chemical structures. Among the AN dyes, absorption maxima of the lowest-energy absorption bands show a trend of AN-11 > AN-14 > AN-12 > AN-3. These absorption wavelengths are appropriate for indoor solar-cell applications.
For fluorescence, the emissions are mirror images of the corresponding lowest-energy absorptions. As expected, the emission bands are red-shifted from the corresponding absorption bands, centred at 722 nm for AN-11, 644 nm for AN-12, and 652 nm for AN-14. The trend of these wavelengths is consistent with that of the lowest-energy absorption bands, i.e. AN-11 > AN-14 > AN-12 > AN-3. Interestingly, the fluorescence emission of AN-11 seems very weak compared with those of AN-12 and AN-14 at the same concentration. This phenomenon may be related to molecular aggregation of the AN-11 dye. More discussion is given in the photovoltaic section to address this possibility.
Electrochemistry, molecular orbitals and energy levels

Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the AN dyes in THF. The redox potentials are listed in Table 1. Due to the less reversible nature of the oxidation reactions, differential pulse voltammograms (DPV) were also obtained to help determine the oxidation potentials.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms (bold lines) of the AN dyes in THF/TBAP. For the oxidation, differential pulse voltammograms were also measured (thin lines) to help determine the potentials. Experimental conditions: [AN-x] = 0.5 mM in 0.1 M TBAP/THF, N2, Pt working and counter electrodes, and a SCE. 
As shown in the figure and table, the first oxidations of AN-11, AN-12 and AN-14 are found at +0.85, +1.07 and +1.08 V vs. the SCE, respectively. These reactions are consistent with the formation of cation radicals.34 The first oxidation potential of AN-11 is very similar to that of AN-3 (+0.86 V vs. the SCE).34 This is consistent with the fact that the two dyes share a common electron donor in their chemical structures. For AN-12 and AN-14, the first oxidation potentials are noticeably more positive than those of AN-3 and AN-11. This may be due to the different donor groups, i.e. the N,N-di-octylaminophenyl-ethynyl group vs. the N,N-di-arylamino group.44 Between AN-12 and AN-14, we observed similar oxidation potentials, consistent with their identical electron-donating group.
For reductions, there are poorly shaped waves near −0.80 V vs. the SCE. These reactions have been established to be reduction reactions of the anchoring groups.48 Additionally, quasi-reversible reactions are found at −1.15, −1.17 and −1.09 V vs. the SCE for AN-11, AN-12 and AN-14, respectively. These reactions are consistent with the formation of anion radicals.34 These reduction potentials are all positively shifted from that of AN-3 (−1.43 V vs. the SCE), likely due to the electron-withdrawing BTDA motif in the chemical structures. As shown in Table 1, AN-11 (−1.15 V) and AN-12 (−1.17) show similar reduction potentials possibly due to the identical electron-acceptor/anchor group. With a different acceptor/anchor, the reduction potential of AN-14 (−1.09 V) is further positively shifted from those of AN-11 and AN-12. This further positive shift may be attributed to the BTDA motif and the additional electron-withdrawing cyano group in the chemical structure. These assignments are consistent with the calculated MO patterns.
To help qualitatively understand the frontier molecular orbitals (MO) of the AN dyes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory.49 As shown in Fig. 4, electron densities of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) mainly reside at the donors and the anthryl parts for all AN dyes. In contrast, electron probabilities of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) largely concentrate at the acceptor/anchoring and anthryl units. First of all, these MO patterns agree well with the electrochemical results, i.e. the oxidation reactions are related to the electron-donating part of the molecules whereas the reductions are related to the electron-withdrawing section of the chemical structures. Secondly, uneven distribution of the electron densities/probabilities at the HOMO/LUMO levels translates to a push–pull tendency of the dyes. This tendency would result in pushing electron density from the donors toward the anchors upon photo-excitation of the dyes. This is a welcome merit for n-type DSSC applications. Thirdly, the electron densities/probabilities seem to be more localized for the HOMO and LUMO of AN-11 than those of AN-3, suggesting a stronger push–pull tendency of the AN-11 dye upon excitation. This suggestion is consistent with the DFT-calculated dipole moments (AN-3: 7.96 debyes; AN-11: 8.65 debyes). The increased dipole moment of AN-11 may be attributed to the presence of the BTDA motif in the structure.

Fig. 5 compares the energy levels of the HOMO/LUMO of each dye, the conduction bands (CB) of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte (I−/I3−).2 The HOMO/LUMO levels are based on the corresponding redox potentials of each dye. As clearly shown in the figure, the LUMO levels of the AN dyes are considerably higher than the conduction bands (CB) of TiO2 and the HOMO levels are noticeably lower than the energy level of the electrolyte. Therefore, the AN dyes should all be capable of injecting electrons into the CB of TiO2 upon excitation, and the resulting cations should be efficiently regenerated by the electrolyte. A similar diagram comparing the ground/excited states of each dye is also provided in the ESI (Fig. S1†). In short, the aforementioned conclusion also applies to Fig. S1.†

Photovoltaic properties of the small cells
The small cells were prepared in our laboratory with an active area of 0.25 cm2. A black mask with an aperture area of 0.16 cm2 was applied to the small cells during the photovoltaic measurements. For the measurements, 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G sunlight (or one-sun) was applied to represent the outdoor environment. Fig. 6 shows the (a) current density–voltage (J–V) curves and (b) incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the AN small cells under one-sun irradiation. The related parameters are tabulated in Table 2. For comparison, data of the Z907 small cells are also included in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2, the overall efficiencies of the small cells exhibit a trend of AN-11 > AN-12 > AN-14 under one-sun irradiation. The AN-11 cell outperforms the AN-12 and AN-14 cells with Jsc = 13.09 mA cm−2, Voc = 680 mV, FF = 71%, and a PCE of 6.36%. Upon closer inspection, we observed similar dye-loadings of the AN cells. In addition, the Voc value of the AN-11 cell is similar to that of the AN-12 cell but moderately greater than that of the AN-14 cell. Therefore, these results would suggest that a greater Jsc value may be a more important factor contributing to the greater PCE of the AN-11 small cell. A greater Jsc value of the AN-11 cell is consistent with the more broadened and intensified IPCE spectrum (Fig. 6b). This suggestion is supported by the integrated values of the IPCE responses (JIPCEsc). As indicated by the comparison in Table 2, the JIPCEsc values show the same trend as that in the J–V study, i.e. AN-11 > AN-12 > AN-14. As for the fill factors (FF), the FF value of the AN-11 cell (71%) is noticeably lower than those of the AN-12 (76%) and AN-14 (78%) cells. Given the same cell fabrication procedure and the small deviations of the averaged values, the lower FF value of the AN-11 cell may not be caused by defects of the device. As such, the lower FF value of the AN-11 cell could be related to the nature of the dye.50 As shown in Fig. 1, the chemical structures of AN-12 and AN-14 are similar to each other, but different from that of AN-11. As shown in Table 1, the oxidation potentials and the absorption wavelengths of AN-12 and AN-14 are similar to each other, but different from those of AN-11. These differences may have an impact on the photovoltaic parameters, such as the FF values.
The very broad IPCE spectrum of the AN-11 cell is consistent with the colour of the device (Fig. 1b–d). With a relatively simple chemical structure, an absorption band of AN-11 is expected at 528 nm (Fig. 2a). As a result, the AN-11 solution appears red (Fig. 1a). Much to our surprise, the AN-11 solar devices show a very black colour. To better understand the differences in colour, normalized UV-visible and IPCE spectra were obtained and are shown in Fig. 7. Between the solution and film spectra, the absorption bands of the film spectra (red dotted curves) are slightly shifted and broadened from those of the AN solutions (black curves). These spectral changes may be related to intermolecular interactions of the dye molecules on the surfaces of TiO2 nanocrystalline films. It has been well documented that the face-to-face, H-type aggregation of π-molecules generates a blue shift of the absorption band(s), whereas the tilted (or head-to-tail), J-type aggregation results in a red shift.51 Therefore, the blue-shifted film spectrum of AN-11 suggests H-type aggregation, and the red-shifted film spectra of AN-12 and AN-14 suggest J-type aggregation of the dye molecules on TiO2. In addition, the broadening phenomenon seems to be more apparent for the AN-11 film. This implies that AN-11 may be more susceptible to aggregation than are the AN-12 and AN-14 dyes. This suggestion is consistent with the much weaker fluorescence emission of the AN-11 solution shown in Fig. 2b. Note that the aforementioned solutions are dilute and the films only adsorb a limited amount of the dye molecules to avoid saturation of the absorption bands. As the amounts of the dyes increase, one should observe further broadening of the film spectra. To examine this possibility, Fig. 7 also includes the normalized IPCE spectra of the AN small cells (blue bold curves). Note that, in this case, many more dye molecules were allowed to adsorb onto the photo-anodes (Table 2). Due to the amounts of the dyes, severe saturation was observed in the UV-visible spectra of the photo-anodes, rendering the spectra unusable. Therefore, we hope to determine the region of the absorptions of the photo-anodes by comparing the IPCE spectra. As clearly shown in Fig. 7, the IPCE spectrum of the AN-11 small cell is significantly more broadened than those of its AN-12 and AN-14 counterparts, resulting in a panchromatic IPCE spectrum covering the entire visible region from 350 to 750 nm. Consequently, the AN-11 cell exhibits a very black colour. To demonstrate the blackness of the AN-11 devices, large R26 modules sensitized with the AN-11, Z907, and AN-3 dyes are compared in Fig. 8. As shown in the figure, the AN-11 module gives rise to a very black colour whereas the Z907 and AN-3 modules show a brown and an orange colour, respectively.

 Fig. 8  R26 modules sensitized with (a) AN-11, (b) Z907, and (c) AN-3. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also carried out in order to reveal important interfacial charge-transfer processes. Fig. 9 compares the Nyquist plots of the AN small cells in the dark. Three semicircles are expected from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz for each cell, including one small semicircle in the lower frequency range (from 0.1 Hz to 2 Hz), one larger semicircle in the middle frequency range (from 2 Hz to 1 kHz), and another smaller semicircle in the highest frequency range (>1 kHz). These semicircles are related to ion diffusion in the electrolyte, charge-transfer processes at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and charge-transfer processes at the Pt/electrolyte interface, respectively. As expected, the semicircles in the highest frequency range (or left side of the figure) are similar for all AN cells. For the semicircles in the lower frequency range (right side), the signals are obscured by the large semicircles at the middle frequencies. Importantly, the middle semicircle of the AN-11 cell is significantly larger/broader than those of the AN-12 and AN-14 cells. This suggests a lower charge recombination rate and thus a weaker dark current for the AN-11 cells (Fig. 6a), contributing to the superior photovoltaic performance. This is consistent with the J–V and IPCE measurements.

As for the indoor performance of the AN small cells, photovoltaic data of the small cells under 1000 lux of T5 or LED light are tabulated in the ESI (Table S1†). In short, the same trend is observed, i.e. AN-11 > AN-12 > AN-14. Therefore, AN-11 is chosen to sensitize the modules for the following investigation.
Photovoltaic and stability tests of the modules
For practical applications, photovoltaic measurements of large modules were also evaluated. As mentioned above, AN-11 was used to sensitize the modules because it outperformed the other AN dyes in the small-cell tests. Two types of modules were manufactured by Taiwan DSC PV Ltd. for the following tests. The R26 module is rigid with an active area of 26.80 cm2 and the F17 module is flexible with an active area of 19.80 cm2 (Fig. 1). No masks were applied during the measurements and only indoor conditions were tested due to the architectural limitations of the modules. For the light sources, 200–1000 lux T5 or LED lights were used to represent various indoor illumination conditions, ranging from a dim room and a common office to a convenience store.

Table 3 summarizes the photovoltaic data of the R26 modules sensitized with AN-11 and Z907 under 200, 600, and 1000 lux of T5 and LED lights. For the Z907/R26 modules, the PCE values under 200 lux T5 and LED lights are comparable with that of the Z907 small cell under one sun irradiation. With the illuminance increased from 200 to 1000 lux, the PCE of the Z907/R26 module also increased from 8.69% to 11.50% for T5 light and from 9.30% to 10.91% for LED light. For the AN-11/R26 module, the PCE values under indoor conditions are superior to that under one sun irradiation. This is consistent with literature reports.10,34,35 Significantly, the AN-11/R26 module outperforms the Z907/R26 module with a PCE of 11.94% under 1000 lux of T5 light. One may consider this PCE value as highly efficient considering the large size of the R26 module. For LED light, PCE values of the AN-11/R26 modules are also greater than those of the Z907/R26 module. As for the F17 modules, the photovoltaic data are presented in Table 4. As shown in the table, a relatively similar trend as for the rigid modules is also observed for the flexible modules. However, the F17 modules seem slightly less efficient than their R26 counterparts. Note that active areas of the modules were used to calculate the PCE values in Tables 3 and 4. In addition to the active area, the aperture area and total area are also important factors when evaluating the PCE of the modules.52 Therefore, we compare the PCE variation of the modules based on different area dimensions in Tables S2 and S3, ESI.†

Differences in the photovoltaic properties of the modules may be related to differences in the emission spectra of the artificial light sources. Fig. 10 compares the UV-vis absorption spectra of AN-11 and Z907 with the emission spectra of the T5 and LED lights. As shown in the figure, the absorption ranges of the two dyes are suitable for indoor photovoltaic applications. Between the two dyes, AN-11 exhibits a much greater extinction coefficient and a wider light-absorption range, possibly contributing to the superior performance of the AN-11 modules under indoor irradiation.
 Fig. 10  Absorption spectra of AN-11 and Z907 vs. the T5 and LED emission spectra. 
To evaluate the stability of the modules in indoor environments, weather stress tests were performed. The tests were carried out by TDP according to the SEMI (the global industry association serving the manufacturing supply chain for the micro- and nano-electronics industries) standards. For the rigid R26 modules, a thermal cycle test was performed. In this test, the surrounding temperature of the AN-11/R26 modules was cycled between 60 °C and −10 °C at 1 °C min−1 rate. Photovoltaic measurements of the modules under 200 lux of T5 light showed that 90.1% of the maximal output power of the R26 modules was retained after 50 cycles of the thermal cycle test (Fig. 11a). For the flexible F17 modules, a damp-heat test was performed. In this test, the flexible modules were subjected to 65 °C and 65% humidity. The results showed that 87.3% of the maximal output power of the AN-11/F17 modules was retained after 600 hours (Fig. 11b).

Finally, we conducted studies on scaling up, reducing cost and their relationship with the photovoltaic performance. So far, our study showed that the synthesis of AN-11 can be scaled up to three grams for each reaction and the cost can be cut down to about US$60 per g. J–V measurements of the reduced cost AN-11 small cells show no decrease in the photovoltaic performance.
Conclusion
In this work, we report the synthesis, and fundamental and photovoltaic properties of three new anthracene-based organic dyes, denoted as AN-11, AN-12 and AN-14. Among the AN dyes, AN-11 shows superior photovoltaic performance compared to the other AN dyes. Significantly, the AN-11/R26 module outperforms its Z907 counterpart with a PCE of 11.94% under 1000 lux of T5 fluorescent light. Furthermore, our study shows that the photovoltaic performance of AN-11 is not affected upon scaling up the synthesis and cutting down the cost. These are the merits for industrializing AN-11 for practical applications.
Experimental
Instruments
NMR (Bruker Avance II 300 MHz), UV-visible (Agilent 8453), fluorescence (Varian Cary Eclipse), and mass (Microfilex MALDI-TOF MS, Bruker Daltonics) spectra were obtained on the indicated instruments. Elemental analyses were carried out by the MOST Instrumentation Center at National Taiwan University (Elementar Vario EL III). Electrochemical measurements were carried out using a standard three-electrode cell (a Pt working electrode, a Pt auxiliary electrode, and an SCE reference electrode) on a CH Instruments Electrochemical Workstation 611A. A glovebox (MBraun Uni-Lab), a vacuum line and standard Schlenk glassware were employed to process all materials sensitive to air. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSC devices covered with a black mask (aperture area 0.4 × 0.4 cm2) were determined with a solar simulator (AM 1.5G, SS50 AAAEM, PET) and a source meter (Keithley 2400). The measurement of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was performed on a 7-SCSpec system (Sofn Instruments Co., Ltd.) with a source meter (Keithley 2000). The dim-light conversion efficiency measurement system was purchased from Yu-Yi Enterprise Co., Ltd., Taiwan, with a spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics USB2000 + UV-vis) and a source meter (Keithley 2401). The T5 and LED lights were manufactured by China Electric MFG. Co.
Materials
Solvents for the synthesis (ACS grade) were CH2Cl2 and CHCl3 (Mallinckrodt Baker), hexanes (Haltermann, Hamburg, Germany), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). These solvents were used as received unless otherwise stated. Other chemicals were obtained commercially (Acros Organics). THF for cross-coupling reactions was purified and dried with a solvent-purification system (Asiawong SD-500, Taipei, Taiwan); about 50 ppm of H2O was found in the resulting fluid. The Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst (Strem, MA, USA) was used as received. For electrochemical measurements, THF was distilled over sodium under N2. For chromatographic purification, we used silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh, Merck).
Device fabrication
R26 and F17 modules were fabricated by Taiwan DSC PV Ltd. (http://www.tdp-dsc.com). For the small cells, a screen-printed, bi-layer TiO2 film on a pre-cleaned and TiCl4-treated fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (TEC 7, Hartford, U.S.A.) was prepared as the working electrode. Screen-printed Pt on an FTO glass was used as the counter electrode. The TiO2 bi-layer film of the working electrode consists of a 9 μm translucent layer of small particles (15–20 nm, Ti-2105A, Eternal Materials Co., Ltd.) and a 6 μm light-scattering layer of large TiO2 particles (∼300 nm, Ti-2325, Eternal Materials Co., Ltd.). The active size of the TiO2 film was 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. The post-sintering procedures of the working and counter electrodes are the same as those in our previous work.34 The dye-soaking procedure of the working electrode involves immersing the photo-anodes in a toluene/ethanol (v/v = 1/1) solution containing 0.20 mM dye for 5 hours. The working and counter electrodes were hot-pressed into one sandwich cell with a 25 μm Surlyn film. The electrolyte injected into the sandwich cell contained I2 (0.05 M), LiI (0.125 M), 3-propyl imidazolium iodide (PMII) (1.0 M), and 4-t-butylpyridine (0.75 M) in an acetonitrile/valeronitrile solvent (v/v = 85/15). Finally, the injection holes were sealed with another layer of Surlyn film (100 μm) and a microslide glass. A mask with an aperture area of 0.16 cm2 was applied to the small cell during the photovoltaic measurements. The dye loadings of the working electrodes were estimated by treating the working electrode with a THF solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) to desorb the dye molecules from the TiO2 surfaces. The Z907 small cells were fabricated according to the same procedure except for the dye-soaking conditions and the composition of the eletrolyte.9
Dye synthesis
Syntheses of the AN dyes are based on the Sonogashira cross-coupling method,53,54 and are similar to those in our previous reports.34,44 Detailed procedures and characterization data are provided in the ESI.†
