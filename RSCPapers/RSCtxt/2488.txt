To achieve maximum enhancement, the morphology of PCSNPs needs to be optimized. Here we precisely control the morphology of Au@TiO2 PCSNPs and systematically study its influence on the plasmonic enhancement effect. The enhancement mechanism was found to vary with the thickness of the TiO2 shell. PCSNPs with a thinner shell mainly enhance the current, whereas particles with a thicker shell improve the voltage. While pronounced plasmonic enhancement was found in the near infrared regime, wavelength-independent enhancement in the visible range was observed and attributed to the plasmonic heating effect. Emission lifetime measurement confirms that N719 molecules neighboring nanoparticles with TiO2 shells exhibit a longer lifetime than those in contact with metal cores. Overall, PCSNPs with a 5 nm shell give the highest efficiency enhancement of 23%. Our work provides a new synthesis route for well-controlled Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles and gains insight into the plasmonic enhancement in DSSCs.IntroductionIn dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the photon-to-current conversion starts from the absorption of light by sensitizing dye molecules. The excited sensitizers then oxidize through ultrafast electron injection into the conduction band of the adjacent semiconductor. Oxidized dyes are quickly reduced to their neutral form by the reducing agent in the electrolyte, e.g. iodide ions in the I−/I3−(aq) electrolytic system. The electrons travel through interfaces and external circuits and eventually recombine with the oxidant of the electrolyte at the counter electrode. Overall, the incident light creates a voltage determined by the potential difference between the conduction band of the semiconductor and the reduction potential of the oxidant in the electrolyte. In a short circuit, such potential can flow current and generate electrical power.1,2 Since multiple steps are involved, the performance of DSSCs can be enhanced by diversely different optimization approaches,3 including enlarging the dye absorption spectrum and suppressing the recombination rate by molecular design,4–6 decreasing the internal impedance of the cell by resistance engineering,7–9 optimizing the electrolytic redox system,10,11 and enhancing the light harvesting efficiency by increasing scattering12,13 or by using the plasmonic enhancement effect.14–21At resonance, plasmonic nanoparticles exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and function as optical nanoantennas that concentrate light to a sub-wavelength area.22 Such a highly confined and enhanced field greatly improves the mismatch between photons and molecules, and thereby enhances the nanoscale light–matter interactions.22–24 Since the intensity of the enhanced optical near field decays rapidly from the metal–dielectric boundaries,25 a shorter distance from the metal surface is generally preferred in order to gain stronger enhancement. However, if the distance is too short, the metallic surface may quench the excited molecules by introducing additional non-radiative decay channels, such as electron or energy transfer to the metal surface.26–28 Surface plasmon resonance can also efficiently convert electromagnetic energy into heat, capable of increasing the local temperature and inducing nanoscale phase transition.29–32 Recently, such a plasmonic thermal effect has been used in thermal therapy, photon-induced drug release and solar vapor generation.31,32To enhance the light harvesting efficiency in DSSCs, plasmonic core–shell nanoparticles (PCSNPs) have recently been incorporated into the active layer of DSSCs.16–22 While the metallic core concentrates light, the shell is ought to provide optimal spacing, chemical stability, good electrical conductivity as well as good photovoltaic properties. Therefore, the morphology of the core as well as the material and the thickness of the shell need to be carefully designed and controlled in order to obtain optimal enhancement. Typically, the enhancement effect of metal@dielectric core–shell nanoparticles is attributed to the enhanced excitation rate of dye sensitizers due to LSPR. When using a semiconducting shell, such as TiO2, two additional mechanisms may be involved in the efficiency enhancement. First, the hot electrons generated inside the resonant plasmonic cores can contribute directly to the photocurrent.33,34 Second, the metal cores can undergo charge equilibrium with the surrounding semiconductor and modify the Fermi level of TiO2, resulting in an improved cell potential.20 In addition, using TiO2 as the shell material may also benefit from the compatible affinity to dye sensitizers35 and the reduced internal impedance of the cell.19,36,37 At the nanometer scale, varying the thickness of the very thin TiO2 shell can, however, significantly change its semiconducting and optical properties, thereby altering the plasmonic enhancement effect in DSSCs. To obtain maximum enhancement, knowledge of the influence of particle morphology on the enhancement effect as well as a reliable method for deterministic synthesis of designed PCSNPs are required.In this work, we developed a new synthesis route for Au@TiO2 PCSNPs to achieve deterministic and precise control of core morphology and shell thickness. With these well-defined PCSNPs, we systematically studied the influence of the thickness of a TiO2 shell on the plasmonic enhancement effect in DSSCs. We found that the enhancement mechanism varies with the TiO2 shell thickness. PCSNPs with a thinner TiO2 shell enhance short-circuit current due to the plasmonic effect, whereas particles with a thicker shell were found to enhance the open-circuit voltage due to the semiconducting character of the shell. We show experimental evidence and discuss possible reasons for the observed difference. Our study gains insight into the plasmonic enhancement effect in DSSCs. The new synthesis method for well-controlled Au@TiO2 PCSNPs may also find applications in solar-to-chemical energy conversion38–40 and controlled nanoscale light–matter interaction.41ExperimentalSynthesis of gold octahedral coresHAuCl4·3H2O (0.01 mol L−1, 5 mL, Alfa Aesar), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 1.1 g, 98%, Alfa Aesar) and trisodium citrate (0.1 mol L−1, 1.5 mL, 99.9%, Aldrich) were mixed with deionized water (Ultrapure Milli-Q water, R > 18 MΩ, 193.5 mL). The mixture solution was sealed and was heated to about but below the boiling point for 12 hours.42 The residual CTAB was removed by cleaning the sample several times with deionized water and centrifugation (6000 rpm, 30 minutes). The resulting citrate-capped gold nanoparticles were stored in deionized water for further TiO2 shell synthesis. The number density of the as-prepared octahedral cores is around 1.37 × 1014 particles per liter calculated from the average particle size and the gold concentration obtained with ICP/MS (7500CE, Agilent).43 It is worth noting that we have intentionally chosen and precisely controlled the morphology of the gold cores to be octahedral instead of normally used spherical shape for two reasons. First, compared to spherical nanoparticles, octahedral cores exhibit higher near-field enhancement around the corners43 (Fig. S1, ESI†). Second, commonly used gold nanospheres usually have an irregular shape and corrugated surface that creates random hot spots upon illumination. Since the plasmonic enhancement effect is due to the enhancement of the optical near field at each individual particle, such random hot spots make it difficult to study the near-field enhancement by performing simulations using perfect spherical particles. Different from nanospheres, our single-crystalline gold nanooctahedrons have uniform size distribution, well-defined shape and atomically flat crystal facets, allowing for direct and fair comparison between the experimental observations and the numerical simulations.Numerical simulationsResonant wavelengths of the synthesized PCSNPs were simulated by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD, Lumerical Solutions, Canada) methods using average dimensions obtained from TEM images. To simulate the extinction spectra of PCSNPs dispersed in water, the refractive index of the surrounding medium was set to be a constant of 1.33 within the frequency window of interest. The dielectric functions of gold and the bulk TiO2 material are obtained from experimental data.44,45 All boundaries of the simulation box were set to be 1000 nm away from the outer surface of the shell in order to avoid spurious absorption of the near fields. A uniform mesh volume with discretization of 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 nm3 covering the whole core–shell nanoparticles was used to describe the curved surface and to obtain converging simulation results within available computational ability. Corners of the octahedral gold core are rounded using cylinders with 6 nm diameter. 2.7 fs pulsed plane waves centered at 600 nm were set as the source for both far-field extinction spectrum and near-field intensity simulations. The polarization of the source was aligned to the diagonal of the octahedron as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(c). In order to find the effective index of the TiO2 shell, the index of the shell in FDTD simulations was varied between 1.6 and 1.7 until the simulated resonance positions matched the corresponding experimental data (Fig. S3a, ESI†). One dimensional near-field intensity enhancement at the fundamental resonance (766 nm) of nanoparticles in a TiO2 environment is shown in Fig. S3b in the ESI.†Assembly of DSSC devicesDSSCs were assembled using a previously reported procedure.46 The only difference is that the scattering layer was skipped and various plasmonic nanoparticles were doped into commercially available TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP, Solaronix). Briefly, the TiO2 paste was first mixed with various PCSNPs and then blade-coated onto FTO glass substrates to form the active layer with an area of 4 × 4 mm2. The photoanodes were then dried and baked in an oven with the following temperature program: (1) stage 1: raising the temperature at a speed of 5 °C min−1 until 80 °C; (2) stage 2: drying the sample at 80 °C for 2 hours; (3) stage 3: raising the temperature at a speed of 5 °C min−1 until 500 °C; (4) stage 4: baking the sample at 500 °C for 1 hour; (5) stage 5: cooling down the sample in the oven until room temperature. The thickness of the as-prepared active layer is about 10 μm, as measured by a profilometer (Alpha-Step IQ, KLA-Tencor). The photoanodes were then dipped into anhydrous ethanol solution of N719 dyes (5 × 10−4 M) for 18 hours to allow for maximum absorption of dyes. The photoanodes were then rinsed with anhydrous ethanol to remove residual dye solution. Platinized FTO counter electrodes were prepared by drop casting 150 μL H2PtCl6 ethanol solution onto FTO glasses. After drying at room temperature for 30 minutes, the H2PtCl6 on counter electrodes was thermopyrolyzed using the following temperature program: (1) stage 1: raising the temperature at a speed of 5 °C min−1 until 80 °C; (2) stage 2: drying the sample at 80 °C for 30 minutes; (3) stage 3: raising the temperature at a speed of 5 °C min−1 until 400 °C; (4) stage 4: baking the sample at 400 °C for 15 minutes; (5) stage 5: cooling down the sample in the oven until room temperature. Polyimide tape (60 μm thick, Taimide Tech. Inc.) as a spacer layer was then used to define a 4 × 4 mm2 aperture on the counter electrode in order to match the size of the working area of the photoanode. Electrolyte solution containing 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in anhydrous acetonitrile was then injected into the aperture of the counter electrodes. The photoanodes and counter electrodes were then adhered and clamped with clips to form home-made DSSC devices used in this work.Emission lifetime measurementEmission lifetime measurement was performed on N719 dyes in ethanol solution (5 × 10−4 M), dried on cover glasses and absorbed in the active layer of a solar cell photoanode. 10 picosecond pulses centered at 532 nm generated from a Nd:YVO4 laser (High Q Laser, picoTRAIN) with a repetition rate of 26.6 MHz and averaged power of 1 mW were focused onto the samples. Laser scattering was rejected by a dichroic mirror (DCM13, Newport) and a long pass filter (FCL550, Thorlabs). The emission from N719 dyes is aligned into an avalanche photodiode detector (PDM, Micro Photon Devices) with a time resolution of 50 ps and quantum efficiency of about 15% at 780 nm, i.e. the emission wavelength of N719 dyes. The photon arrival time with respect to the excitation time was recorded and analyzed with a time-correlated single photon counting module (HydraHarp 400, PicoQuant). Lifetime fitting was performed using a complex multi-exponential fitting function (SymPhoTime, PicoQuant), which takes into account the instrumental response function (IRF) and scattering from the substrate.Results and discussionDeterministic synthesis of well-defined Au@TiO2 PCSNPsTo synthesize Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles with well-controlled shell thickness, we first prepared octahedral gold nanoparticles following our previously reported method42 (see the Experimental section). L-Arginine aqueous solution (0.02 mol L−1, 10 mL, Aldrich) was then added into the octahedral gold core solution (number density = 1.37 × 1014 particles per L, 20 mL). 12 mL of cyclohexane was then added into the mixture to form a biphasic system. At this stage, the citrate-capped gold nanoparticles were turned into arginine-capped ones, which were further converted into thio-capped cores by adding 12 μL of (3-mercaptopropyl)triethoxysilane (MPTS, 95%, Aldrich) into the cyclohexane layer and stirring for 6 hours.47 In order to remove residual MPTS, the cyclohexane layer was removed after 6 hours of stirring and the particles were cleaned with dehydrated alcohol (absolute ethanol, 99.8%, Aldrich) and centrifugation several times. At this stage, the gold cores were well dispersed in dehydrated alcohol and covered with a thin layer of MPTS which serves as an adhesion layer for further TiO2 shell growth. It is worth noting that replacing the water solvent by dehydrated alcohol is necessary since the precursor of the TiO2 shell, i.e. titanium isopropoxide (TTIP), interacts instantly with water and forms TiO2 nanoparticles instead of the TiO2 shell on gold cores in aqueous solution. To grow the TiO2 shell, the alcohol solution of gold cores was added 1 μL of TTIP (97%, Aldrich) and allowed for growing under mild stirring for a controlled period of time ranging from 1.5 hours to 24 hours. The reaction was then terminated by rinsing the particles with dehydrated alcohol and centrifugation in order to remove residual TTIP. Scheme 1 summarizes the synthesis of the Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles. Since the growth of a TiO2 shell is very sensitive to water, it is important to maintain the humidity such that the TiO2 shell grows in a steady and reasonably slow rate. This was done by controlling the temperature and humidity at 25 °C and 50%, respectively. Scheme 1  Schematic diagram for the synthesis of Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles with well-controlled core morphology and shell thickness. Characterization of Au@TiO2 PCSNPsFig. 1(a) shows the average shell thickness of Au@TiO2 nanoparticles as a function of reaction time. The TiO2 shell thickness first increases linearly with the reaction time at a slope of about 2.5 nm per hour and reaches a constant value of 37 nm due to depletion of TTIP. Based on such a linear relationship, we were able to precisely tune the shell thickness by controlling the reaction time within the dynamic range (t < 10 hours). The shell thickness of the as-synthesized PCSNPs has a relatively narrow distribution (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. 1(b) shows the extinction spectra of nanoparticles measured with a commercial spectrometer (V-570, Jasco). The extinction spectrum of gold cores clearly shows a plasmonic resonance peak around 545 nm. Upon addition of the TiO2 shell, the resonance shifts accordingly to longer wavelengths (560–570 nm, indicated with an arrow) due to the higher index of the shell. Since the shell is thin and the field extends into the surrounding water, the observed shift is minute. To verify the experimentally observed resonance spectra, we performed simulations using finite-difference time-domain methods (see the Experimental section). In the simulations, the average size of the particles obtained from field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-7000F, JEOL) and field-emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL) images is used in order to mimic the real nanostructures. For bare gold octahedral cores, the simulated resonance position is in good agreement with the experimental data. However, for all the Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles, if the index of the bulk TiO2 material is assumed for the shell, the calculated resonance position exhibits greater red shifts compared to the experimental data (Fig. S3, ESI†). Such a discrepancy suggests that the material of the shell is significantly different from the bulk TiO2. Two reasons might be responsible for the observed difference. First, when the shell is very thin, the contribution from the surface of the TiO2, which is in the form of Ti-OH with lower index,45,48 is significant. Second, Si-based MPTS was involved in our synthesis procedure as a thin adhesion layer for TTIP. For a very thin shell such a low-index adhesion layer becomes the major constituent of the shell. Based on the index mixing rule which states that the effective index of a composite material is proportional to the portion ratio of the constituent in the mixture,49,50 the index of very thin shells can, therefore, deviate significantly from that of their bulk counterparts. Consequentially, assuming a refractive index of the bulk TiO2 material for the shell in the numerical simulations leads to deviation from the experimental data. In fact, such a discrepancy can also be seen in previously reported data.39 Increasing the thickness of the shell, the contribution from the surface Ti-OH becomes less and less significant and the effective index of the shell gradually increases. Such a dependence of the shell constituent on its thickness has a major influence on the plasmonic enhancement effect in DSSCs, as will be discussed later. Using numerical simulations, we found that the effective index of the shell varies from 1.61 for the 5 nm shell to 1.69 for the 37 nm shell, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b). In fact, the increasing absorption with respect to the shell thickness seen in the short wavelength regime (<500 nm) in Fig. 1(b) also provides evidence of the increasing portion of TiO2 in the thicker shell. As the thickness of the shell increases to a value larger than 40 nm, the resonance position slowly approaches 767 nm, which is the resonance of bare gold cores surrounded by the bulk TiO2 material, as in the active layer of a DSSC. As we will see later, it is such a greatly red-shifted plasmonic resonance in the near infrared (IR) regime that shows a pronounced enhancement effect in DSSCs. Fig. 1  (a) Shell thickness as a function of reaction time. At zero reaction time, the data point represents the distribution of the side length of octahedral cores with an average value of 23.2 nm. The solid line is a guide for the eye. The inset illustrates how the shell thickness, t, and the side length of the cores, a, are measured. Error bars are the standard deviations obtained from measuring 40 cores and 20 Au@TiO2 nanoparticles using SEM and TEM images (see Fig. S2 in the ESI† for size distribution). (b) Extinction spectra of octahedral gold cores (red) and Au@TiO2 nanoparticles with shell thicknesses of 5, 8, 12, 16, and 37 nm (blue, cyan, magenta, orange and dark yellow, respectively). Black arrows mark the shift of resonance and the increasing absorption due to TiO2 in the blue spectral regime as the shell thickness increases. The inset shows the simulated effective index of the shell as a function of the thickness. (c) SEM images of the octahedral cores (i) and TEM images of the Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles with increasing reaction time and shell thickness (ii–vi). Middle panels show the zoomed-in images of the areas marked with dotted squares in the corresponding top panels. Bottom panels show the images of the corresponding nanoparticles after being sintered at 500 °C for 1 hour. Scale bars for top, middle and bottom panels are 50, 25 and 20 nm, respectively. Representative SEM images of the cores and TEM images of various Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 1(c). It can be clearly seen that the cores have well-defined octahedral shape and relatively narrow distribution of the side length (23.2 ± 1.1 nm). For the Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles, TEM images show that the gold cores are well covered by the shell with a time-dependent thickness. Since the Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles will eventually be doped into the TiO2 paste for the active layer of DSSCs, we examined the morphology of the nanoparticles after being sintered at 500 °C for one hour, as required in the fabrication of photoanodes. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1(c), bare gold cores melt to form larger grains with irregular shape after sintering. In contrast, the Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles maintain their morphology and the gold cores are still in octahedral shape (bottom panel of Fig. 1(c)). Even though no crystalline structure was observed in the shell by high resolution TEM, the X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD-6000, Shimadzu) confirms that the main constituent of the shell is the TiO2 based material (Fig. S4, ESI†).Performance of plasmonic DSSCsBeing able to precisely control the thickness of the TiO2 shell, we then incorporated our PCSNPs into the active layer of DSSCs and systematically studied their plasmonic enhancement effect on the cell performance. The DSSC devices used in this work were assembled following the procedure reported by Chen et al.46 except that the scattering layer was skipped and the active layer of the photoanode was modified by doping a small amount of Au@TiO2 PCSNPs into the commercially available TiO2 paste (see the Experimental section). The amount of doped Au@TiO2 particles was carefully optimized to achieve maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE). It is worth noting that the stability of core–shell nanoparticles in an electrolyte is in general better than that of bare cores because the TiO2 shell helps prevent the metallic core from corrosion.16 Since the chemical stability is different for various particles, in order to exclude the influence of the chemical stability and fairly compare the enhancement effect of various particles, the performance of all cells was measured “right after” the assembly of cell devices, i.e. within 5 minutes. In such a short time, the corrosion of the nanoparticles is marginal. It should be kept in mind that the performance shown here does not reveal the degradation of the cell due to particle corrosion. The PCE is calculated using η = JscVocFF/Is, where Jsc is the measured short-circuit current, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor and Is = 100 mW cm−2 is the irradiance of the light source in the measurement, equivalent to one sun at air mass (AM 1.5) at the surface of the cells (Xenon lamp, Oriel 69907, Newport). To obtain the current–voltage characteristics of the cell, external bias voltage was applied to the DSSCs and the photocurrent was recorded with a digital source meter (Keithley model 2400, Keithley, U.S.A.). For each kind of PCSNP, we fabricated ten replicates of DSSC devices in order to obtain the cell performance with statistical significance. Fig. 2(a) shows the PCE of the DSSCs as a function of the doping level of nanoparticles. It can be clearly seen that for all kinds of dopants, the PCE first increases with the doping level and gradually decreases after reaching a maximum value. Carefully examining the curves of PCE with that of Jsc (Fig. 2(b)) and Voc (Fig. 2(c)), two trends can be observed. First, for PCSNPs with a shell thickness of 5, 8 and 12 nm, the trend of PCE follows that of Jsc, whereas the Voc is rather constant or irrelevant. In contrast, for PCSNPs with a 16 nm shell (orange traces in Fig. 2), the improved PCE at a lower doping level is apparently due to the increased Voc, while Jsc starts playing a role at the middle doping level. Such an observation reveals that the mechanism responsible for the efficiency enhancement of doping Au@TiO2 PCSNPs depends on the thickness of the semiconducting shell. When the shell thickness of PCSNPs increases, the sensitizer molecules are kept farther from the cores and thus experience a less plasmonic field enhancement effect and the Jsc values decrease (Fig. 2(b)). Although the thicker shell suppresses the current enhancement, the portion of crystalline TiO2 in the thicker shell is large enough to undergo charge equilibrium between metal cores and the surrounding TiO2 material. Consequently, an increased Voc and a slightly improved fill factor (Fig. S5, ESI†) were obtained due to a modified Fermi level of the semiconductor.20 The difference in the enhancement mechanism with respect to the shell thickness can be more clearly seen in the current-to-voltage (J–V) characteristics of the cell, as shown in Fig. 2(d). We compared the J–V characteristics of plasmonic DSSCs at optimal doping levels that give the best efficiency in Fig. 2(a), i.e. the best cell out of ten replicates at the optimal doping level. It is obvious that the Jsc decreases and the Voc increases with increasing shell thickness, as indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 2(d). This trend is in good accordance with the comparison made between Au@TiO2 and Au@SiO2 PCSNPs.20 Considering the shell thickness-dependent constituent of the shell material, it is then clear that the thinner shell prepared with our method shows no semiconducting character and serves merely as a dielectric layer as SiO2. Table 1 summarizes the average size and the resonance wavelength of the nanoparticles, as well as the best doping level and the resulting average performance of plasmonic DSSCs. Doping PCSNPs with a 5 nm shell at a level of 600 ppm (gold-to-titania ratio determined by ICP/MS, 7500CE, Agilent) was found to give the best enhancement of PCE from 6.00% (normal DSSCs) to 7.38% (plasmonic DSSCs), corresponding to an efficiency improvement of 23%. It is worth noting that although bare gold cores show a very good enhancement effect compared to thin shell PCSNPs, the corrosion of bare cores due to the I−/I3− electrolyte remains a main challenge in real application. Nevertheless, if a non-corrosive electrolyte system is used, bare metallic cores might be a better choice over complex core–shell nanoparticles since bare cores can be more easily prepared and controlled. Fig. 2  The influence of the doping level of octahedral gold nanoparticles (red squares) and PCSNPs with 5 nm (blue dots), 8 nm (cyan up triangles), 12 nm (magenta down triangles) and 16 nm (orange left triangles) shells on (a) overall power conversion efficiency, (b) short-circuit current (Jsc), (c) open-circuit voltage (Voc) and (d) current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs.

In (d), only the J–V curves of plasmonic DSSCs with optimal doping levels that give the best efficiency in (a) are plotted. Black arrows mark the decrease of Jsc and the increase of Voc as the shell thickness increases.

Fig. 3(a) shows the IPCE of the DSSCs with various PCSNP dopants. The devices that give the best cell efficiency were used for IPCE analysis. It can be seen that the enhancement of the IPCE is universal over the whole excitation spectrum of the N719 sensitizer. The enhancement decreases, however, with increasing shell thickness. Since the near field responsible for the plasmon-enhanced excitation of dyes is strongest at resonance, enhancement in the cell current is expected to show spectral features that follow the surface plasmon resonance. To verify this point and gain insight into the enhancement effect, we plot the relative enhancement (ΔIPCE/IPCE) as a function of illumination wavelength, where ΔIPCE is the difference between the plasmonic DSSCs and normal DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 3(b), pronounced relative enhancement sets in at the spectral regime above 700 nm. Compared to the surface plasmon resonance of nanoparticles in aqueous solution (Fig. 1(b)), the enhancement of nanoparticles blended in the TiO2 paste apparently red shifts to the near IR regime. This is due to the fact that localized surface plasmon resonance greatly depends on the dielectric function of the environment.22,25 When plasmonic nanoparticles are blended into the commercial TiO2 paste and baked into the photoanode, the surrounding environment becomes very different from that in aqueous solution. The surrounding becomes extremely TiO2-rich and most of the gold nanoparticles are surrounded by the anatase TiO2 material. Since the anatase TiO2 has a much higher refractive index (n = 2.49) compared to water (n = 1.33), the localized surface resonance greatly red shifts. From the experimental point of view, it is technically hard to measure the extinction spectrum of nanoparticles blended into the TiO2 paste because the scattering of the TiO2 paste is too strong and the dose concentration of plasmonic nanoparticle is too low. Therefore, we performed rigorous numerical simulations using the FDTD method to simulate the LSPR spectrum of nanoparticles embedded in the TiO2 environment, mimicking the surrounding environment in the photoanode of DSSCs. Fig. 3  (a) IPCE and (b) relative enhancement in IPCE (ΔIPCE/IPCE) of DSSCs without doping (black), with doping bare gold cores (red), PCSNPs with shell thicknesses of 5 nm (blue), 8 nm (cyan), 12 nm (magenta) and 16 nm (orange). The inset shows the zoomed-in of the spectra within the range of 400 to 600 nm. For doped DSSCs, optimal doping levels shown in Fig. 2(a) are used. (c) Simulated near-field spectra recorded at positions that are 2 nm (red), 5 nm (blue), 8 nm (cyan), 12 nm (magenta) and 16 nm (orange) from the surface of the gold core. The inset shows the coordination and the polarization of the incident excitation as well as the near-field enhancement distribution recorded at 766 nm. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the simulated plasmon resonance of nanoparticles in the TiO2 environment well matches the observed enhancement in IPCE (Fig. 3(b)). It is also clearly seen that increasing the shell thickness decreases the enhancement in current. This is due to the fact that plasmonic near-field enhancement decays rapidly form the gold surface (Fig. S3b, ESI†). Since the thicker shell keeps N719 molecules farther from the surface of the gold core, the plasmonic enhancement effect is weaker. One of the main challenges in the development of DSSCs is the light harvesting in the red to near infrared regime. In this work, the absolute IPCE is relatively low between 700 and 750 nm because N719 sensitizers do not efficiently absorb light in this spectral regime. Although it is beneficial to the observed plasmonic enhancement effect at a low absorption spectral regime,24 the absolute enhancement is still minute. To resolve this problem, one should choose sensitizers with higher absorption in the IR regime, such as black dyes.In addition to the enhancement around the plasmonic resonance in the near IR spectral range, wavelength-independent enhancement in the visible (VIS) to ultraviolet (UV) spectral regime was also observed (inset of Fig. 3(b)). In the UV/VIS regime, the enhancement shows no significant wavelength-dependent features but decreases as the shell thickness increases. Although the dependence on the shell thickness indicates that the effect indeed stems from the doping of PCSNPs, the lack of wavelength dependence suggests, however, that the enhancement effect is not directly related to the enhanced harvesting of light. In fact, such a wavelength-independent enhancement is commonly observed.17,19,21 Here, we tentatively attribute such a wavelength-independent enhancement to the plasmonic heating effect.29,31,32 It has been reported that upon resonance, plasmonic nanoparticles can efficiently convert the electromagnetic energy to heat and raise the local temperature. This effect has been used to release drug and kill cancer cells locally.31 Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that plasmonic heating can effectively increase the local mobility of electrolytes.51 Such a localized plasmonic heating effect may also occur in plasmonic DSSC devices and can possibly enhance the cell performance by promoting the electrochemical reaction in the cell or increasing the mobility of the electrolyte,52 leading to an enhancement in Jsc without pronounced spectral dependence. In fact, this wavelength independent enhancement is weaker as the shell thickness increases, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b). This is due to the fact that the heat produced in the metal cores is more isolated by the thicker shell. Other reasons for the universal enhancement, such as increased dye loading or enhanced conductivity, should be relatively minor since the surface affinity of the Au@TiO2 is similar to the TiO2 particles in the paste and the doping levels in our plasmonic DSSCs are low. Deeper study is needed to understand the mechanism responsible for such a universal enhancement.Emission lifetime of sensitizersIntuitively, the shell prevents the dye molecules from being in contact with the metal cores and helps avoid possible quenching of dyes. Therefore, compared to bare cores, PCSNPs with a thin shell should exhibit the highest current enhancement. However, our results show that doping bare gold cores exhibits a comparably large enhancement effect as PCSNPs with a 5 nm shell, as can be seen in Fig. 2 and 3. The fact that dye molecules are in direct contact with the metal surface seems not to play an important role and the quenching of dye molecules by the metal surface is insignificant in DSSCs. A possible reason for this can be the very efficient electron injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor, which is significantly faster than the quenching channel introduced by the metal surface. In order to verify this point and understand the effect of the shell on the dye quenching, we performed emission lifetime measurement on the N719 dye sensitizer in ethanol solution and in an isolated active layer on a cover glass (see the Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 4, the fitted lifetime for free N719 molecules in ethanol solution is 9.2 ns. For drop-cast N719 dyes on the surface of a bare cover glass, the lifetime reduces to about 5.0 ns. For dye molecules absorbed in the active layer of normal DSSCs prepared with commercially available anatase TiO2 paste, the lifetime is further reduced to 602 ps. As the bare gold cores were doped into the paste, we observed a dramatic reduction of the N719 lifetime to less than 40 ps. For nanoparticles with TiO2 shells, the lifetime apparently recovered to about 60 ps. This observation reveals that the metal surface of the cores does quench the excited dye molecules and leads to a shorter emission lifetime. However, in a shorted DSSC, such quenching channels introduced by the metal surface are not fast enough to compete with the very efficient electron injection from the ligand of dye into the conduction band of TiO2.53 Therefore, from the performance of plasmonic DSSCs, no pronounced dependence on the shell thickness was observed. Limited to the response time of the photon detector (∼50 ps), we were not able to accurately obtain the lifetime of the dye molecules in the vicinity of the cores or PCSNPs. Nevertheless, the longer lifetime for PCSNPs in comparison to that for bare cores is evident. More accurate lifetime measurements using a transient absorption scheme are to be carried out. Fig. 4  Emission lifetime of the N719 sensitizer dye in aqueous solution (navy), dried on cover glass (green), dried on cover glass coated with sintered TiO2 paste (black) and dried on cover glass coated with sintered TiO2 paste mixed with octahedral gold cores (red), PCSNPs with shells of 5 nm (blue), 8 nm (cyan), 12 nm (magenta) and 16 nm (orange) thicknesses. For doped DSSCs, optimal doping levels shown in Fig. 2(a) are used. ConclusionsWe have systematically studied the influence of the shell thickness on the enhancement effect in plasmonic DSSCs using Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles. We have developed a new route for the synthesis of well-controlled Au@TiO2 particles. We found that the enhancing mechanism varies with the shell thickness. Doping PCSNPs with a thinner TiO2 shell enhances the excitation rate of dye sensitizers and increases the cell temperature, leading to enhancement in the short-circuit current. On the other hand, doping PCSNPs with a thicker shell allows for charge equilibrium between the semiconductor and the metal cores, resulting in an increased open-circuit voltage. The maximum plasmonic enhancement effect was observed in the IR regime. Wavelength-independent enhancement was observed in the visible to ultraviolet spectral regime, which we attribute it to the plasmonic heating effect. Emission lifetime measurement for N719 dyes confirms that the TiO2 shell plays a role in preventing the dye molecules from being quenched by the metal surface. The effect of quenching by the metal core is, however, insignificant in DSSCs since the electron injection to the semiconductor is much more efficient. In order to obtain the best enhancement, the absorption band of dyes and the resonance of plasmonic nanoparticles should be tuned to overlap and preferably in the red to IR spectral regime such that this portion of the solar spectrum can be efficiently absorbed. Our work gains insight into the plasmonic enhancement effect in DSSCs and provides a new method for the synthesis of Au@TiO2 PCSNPs with well-controlled morphology which may find applications in solar-to-chemical energy conversion and controlled nanoscale light–matter interaction.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Prof. I.-C.

 	Scheme 1  Schematic diagram for the synthesis of Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles with well-controlled core morphology and shell thickness.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) Shell thickness as a function of reaction time. At zero reaction time, the data point represents the distribution of the side length of octahedral cores with an average value of 23.2 nm. The solid line is a guide for the eye. The inset illustrates how the shell thickness, t, and the side length of the cores, a, are measured. Error bars are the standard deviations obtained from measuring 40 cores and 20 Au@TiO2 nanoparticles using SEM and TEM images (see Fig. S2 in the ESI† for size distribution). (b) Extinction spectra of octahedral gold cores (red) and Au@TiO2 nanoparticles with shell thicknesses of 5, 8, 12, 16, and 37 nm (blue, cyan, magenta, orange and dark yellow, respectively). Black arrows mark the shift of resonance and the increasing absorption due to TiO2 in the blue spectral regime as the shell thickness increases. The inset shows the simulated effective index of the shell as a function of the thickness. (c) SEM images of the octahedral cores (i) and TEM images of the Au@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles with increasing reaction time and shell thickness (ii–vi). Middle panels show the zoomed-in images of the areas marked with dotted squares in the corresponding top panels. Bottom panels show the images of the corresponding nanoparticles after being sintered at 500 °C for 1 hour. Scale bars for top, middle and bottom panels are 50, 25 and 20 nm, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  The influence of the doping level of octahedral gold nanoparticles (red squares) and PCSNPs with 5 nm (blue dots), 8 nm (cyan up triangles), 12 nm (magenta down triangles) and 16 nm (orange left triangles) shells on (a) overall power conversion efficiency, (b) short-circuit current (Jsc), (c) open-circuit voltage (Voc) and (d) current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs. In (a–c), the data points at the zero doping level are the performances of normal DSSCs without doping plasmonic nanoparticles. Error bars are the standard deviation of 10 replicates for each device. In (d), only the J–V curves of plasmonic DSSCs with optimal doping levels that give the best efficiency in (a) are plotted. Black arrows mark the decrease of Jsc and the increase of Voc as the shell thickness increases.
