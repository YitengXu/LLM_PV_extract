    , Accepted 19th May 2021First published on 25th May 2021AbstractVertical van der Waals heterojunctions (HJs) composed of a photocatalytic star material BiOCl monolayer and group-IV Xene monolayer (silicene, germanene etc.) were studied by using first-principles calculations. Formation energy analysis and molecular dynamics simulation show that the BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs can exist stably up to room temperature. Owing to evident charge redistribution and accumulation occurring between the bilayers, electron–hole puddles form and charge carrier transfer and separation occur in the HJs, which are beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic performance. The HJ energy bands maintain the Dirac cones with almost linear dispersion curves, suggesting low effective mass and high mobility of carriers, and can be effectively tuned by strain. Our results show that the BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs with high separation efficiency and high mobility of carriers and strain-adjustable bandgaps provide varieties in the functionalities of 2D van der Waals HJs and show great potentials in photocatalytic applications.
1. Introduction
Since Fujishima and Honda discovered photocatalytic splitting of water on TiO2 electrodes in 1972,1 direct conversion of solar energy to chemical energy through photocatalytic technology has attracted extensive interest. At present, the major problems limiting photocatalytic performance are the low separation efficiency and/or low mobility of carriers in photocatalysts.2 Recent studies have demonstrated that one of the solutions may exist in heterogeneous photocatalysts2–7 composed of one photocatalytic material such as TiO2 and BiOCl8–10 and the other material with good electron conductivity and a large specific surface area such as graphene,2 which can improve the capacity of charge separation and transfer in the systems. For instance, Zhang et al. reported that TiO2/graphene composites exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of methylene blue in aqueous solutions.10 Xu et al. demonstrated that ZnO/graphene heterojunctions exhibited about 4 times photocatalytic efficiency as that of pristine ZnO.4 BiOCl/graphene nanocomposites showed twice higher photocatalytic efficiency than that of pure BiOCl catalysts.5 BiOCl/g-C3N4 composites also exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance.6 BiOCl/MoS2 composites showed 1.5 times photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B as that of pure BiOCl crystals.7 However, most of these studies focused on the composites composed of bulk and two-dimensional (2D) materials or even purely bulk materials, and heterogeneous photocatalysts composed of two kinds of monolayers are rarely explored. Since the photocatalytic activities are closely related to the surface properties, the miniature of the photocatalysts can increase the efficiency of the catalysts per unit weight. More importantly, carrier separation can be enhanced in 2D heterojunctions and carrier mobility in 2D monolayers can be very high.11,12 Therefore, 2D heterogeneous photocatalysts may generate even higher photocatalytic efficiency.
Different groups have shown that group-IV Xene, such as silicene and germanene, can be synthesized with good electron conductivity and a large specific surface area,13 very much alike their 2D cousin of graphene, and also exhibit photocatalytic potentials.13,14 Our previous work has also demonstrated that the photocatalytic star material BiOCl can exist stably down to monolayers.15 Based on these facts, in this work, we have designed and studied four types of vertical HJs composed of a BiOCl monolayer (BML) and group-IV Xene by using first-principles calculations. Our data show that all four types of HJs can exist stably. Notably, evident charge carrier redistribution occurs between the bilayers, resulting in the formation of well-defined electron–hole puddles, and an enhanced absorption band is found in the visible region, which can significantly promote the electron conductivity and enhance the photocatalytic activities of the HJs.16 Our results may facilitate the application of BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs in high-performance electronic and photocatalytic devices.
2. Computational details
Our first-principles calculations were performed by the density functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).17 The projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials were used to describe the core electrons. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzernhof (PBE)18 functional was adopted to describe the exchange and correlation potentials. In all simulations, the cutoff energy for the expansion of the wave function into plane waves is set to be 520 eV. Through the test, we use a set of (5 × 19 × 1) k-point sampling to carry out Brillouin zone (BZ) integral in K space in the calculations of the self-consistent field potential and total energy. Here, the k-point mesh is generated by a Γ-centered scheme. In order to avoid the interlayer interactions between adjacent supercells, a 15 Å vacuum layer is selected. In order to fully relax the atomic position and the shape of the unit cell, the tolerance of electron convergence was set as 10−5 eV, and the force was converged within −0.02 eV Å−1. The vdW density functional (vdW-DF)19 methods have good reproducibility for the geometry and interaction of layered materials.20 Therefore, we have considered the dispersion interaction by using a damped van der Waals (vdW) correction (DFT-D2)21 in our present calculations.
3. Results and discussion
The results of PBE + VDW calculations show that the BiOCl bulk has a tetragonal (PbFCl-type) structure (P4/nmm space group) with six atoms in a primitive cell with the lattice parameters being a = b = 3.91 Å, C = 7.50 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°, consistent with the experimental data.22 Benefited from the layered geometric structure of BiOCl bulk, as characterized by the [Cl–Bi–O–Cl] slabs being stacked together by the van der Waals (vdW) interactions via the [Cl⋯Cl] atoms, BML should be able to be separated by micro-mechanical peeling. BML calculated by PBE has a tetragonal structure with a lattice parameter being a = b = 3.90 Å, consistent with the previous study (3.89 Å).23 The optimized lattice sizes of silicene and germanene are 3.87 Å and 4.06 Å, respectively, which is in agreement with the literature (3.87 Å and 4.06 Å).24Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the top view and side view of the BiOCl/silicene bilayer HJs. In the y-direction, the lattice mismatch between the bilayers is less than 5%. In the x-direction, we expand Xene and BML into 4 × 1 and 7 × 1 supercells, respectively, so that the mismatch between them is controlled within 5%. Four kinds of HJs were studied at a layer spacing of 3.36 Å: BiOCl/silicene (B/S), BiOCl/germanene (B/G), BiOCl/up-sigerene (B/USG) and BiOCl/down-sigerene (B/DSG), respectively, where up-sigerene and down-sigerene indicate that the Si atoms are in the upper and lower cases of Si0.5Ge0.5 monolayers, respectively.11 For each HJ, we considered four different stacking patterns: the center of the six-membered ring on the far left exactly on the top of the Bi atom; the bridge position between the Bi and O atoms; the top of the O atom; and the bridge position between the O and Bi atoms, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(c).

The blue, violet, red and green balls represent the Si, Bi, O and Cl atoms, respectively. 
3.1 The stability of the BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs
To explore the stability of these 2D HJs, we first calculated the forming energy (Ef) between the bilayers, which is defined as Ef = E(BiOCl/Xene) − E(BML) − E(Xene), where E(BiOCl/Xene), E(BML) and E(Xene) are the energies of BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs, isolated BML and Xene, respectively. The calculated relaxed energies (E0), forming energies (Ef), lattice parameters (a,b), buckling parameter (Δ) and interlayer spacing (d) of the HJs are listed in Table 1. The forming energies of the four HJs are all negative, indicating that all these structures can exist stably. It is noted that the energy differences of the four stacking structures of the four HJs are very small, suggesting that the bilayer HJs are not highly dependent on the stacking method, which is different from the stacking-dependent silicene bilayers.25 The stabilities of these bilayer HJs were further investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics simulation at room temperature (T = 300 K). The simulation was performed on a 2 × 3 × 1 supercell with 348 atoms with a time step of 1 fs. As shown in Fig. 2, after running 2000 steps, the geometries of the bilayer HJs were just a little rippled and the stable structures were preserved, which shows that the bilayer HJs can exist stably at room temperature.

Then, the structure of the lowest energy configuration was investigated. In the bilayer HJs, BML seems to be weakly affected by Xene and continues to maintain good flatness, which provides a certain guarantee for the stability of the entire HJs. However, a buckling height of 0.75–1.31 Å in the Xene of the bilayer junctions is significantly higher than those in the pure silicene and germanene (0.44 Å and 0.64 Å),26 suggesting an obvious structural distortion in Xene.27,28 The minimum interatomic distances of B/S, B/G, B/USG and B/DSG are 3.44 Å, 3.27 Å, 3.37 Å and 3.32 Å, respectively, which are larger than the lengths of the covalent bonds (Si–Cl: 2.05 Å, Ge–Cl: 2.11 Å)29 and in the range of vdW force, indicating that BML is bound to Xene via weak physisorption.
3.2 The electronic and photocatalytic properties of the BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs
Then, we investigated the plane-averaged charge density difference Δρ(z) of bilayer HJs, which is defined as Δρ(z) = ρtotal − ρBML − ρXene, where ρtotal, ρBML and ρXene are the total charge densities of BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs, BML and Xene, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3(e)–(h), evident charge redistribution and charge accumulation occur in the interspace between the bilayers, resulting in the formation of electron- and hole-rich regions (electron–hole puddles). It is well known that the semi-local functional GGA will overestimate the charge transfer.30 So the actual charge transfer may be slightly lower than the calculated one, but electron–hole puddles can be formed. Previous studies reported that the spatial separation of photoexcited charge carriers in the bilayer HJs can be confirmed from the type-II band alignment.31–35 However, the charge separation mechanism of BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs is different, in which a local electrostatic potential difference is formed between the adjacent surfaces, just like the p–n junction in a solar cell, which has a certain rectifying effect on the excitation of electrons and holes, and could significantly increase the separation of charge carriers. This leads to an intrinsic interface dipole pointing from BML towards Xene and hence the sublattice inversion symmetry of Xene is broken. Since B/G and B/S have the smallest (2.70 Å) and largest interlayer spacings (3.15 Å), respectively, they have the strongest and weakest charge accumulations, respectively. As we know, a large amount of charge transfer is very beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic performance.16

The thick black line indicates the number of electrons in the free atoms. The blue, gray, violet, red and green balls represent the Si, Ge, Bi, O and Cl atoms, respectively. The yellow and light-green areas represent electron accumulation and depletion, respectively, and the isosurface value is ±0.00022 electrons per Å3. 
We further performed Bader charge calculations36 to visualize charge transfer between the bilayers. As shown in Fig. 3(a)–(d), in the four types of bilayer HJs, Bi atoms lose electrons and act as electron donors, Cl and O atoms acquire electrons and act as electron acceptors, while Si (Ge) atoms may acquire or lose electrons. In B/S and B/G, some Si (Ge) atoms gain electrons, while others lose electrons, and the number of gained or lost electrons is not large. In B/USG and B/DSG, Si atoms lose electrons, and Ge atoms gain electrons. The induced charge transfer is estimated, which suggests a charge transfer of ∼0.131 e, ∼0.247 e, ∼0.183 e and ∼0.175 e from silicene, germanene, up-sigerene and down-sigerene to BML, respectively. Since germanene transfers most charges to BiOCl and has the highest electron mobility,11,37 the B/G bilayer may have the highest catalytic performance among the four HJs.
The distributions of electronic states near the Fermi level (EF) are shown by the projected band structures of the bilayer HJs in Fig. 4(a)–(d). It is noted that the states near EF are dominated by the p and p* bands of Bi, Si and Ge atoms, indicating that the electron transport behaviors are mainly determined by p states. The dispersed Bi 6p states can facilitate the photo-excited electrons of BiOCl to travel a longer distance.22 Therefore, the bilayer HJs can promote the charge-transfer transition more and increase the charge-trapping life of holes. As shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI,† the partial charge densities of bilayer HJs between ±0.3 eV at EF are well delocalized over the π-conjugated skeletons, which are helpful for the charge-transfer transition under light irradiation.

As can be seen from Fig. 4(a)–(d), the bilayer HJs maintain the Dirac cones in the Y–Γ direction, which may provide an interesting platform for studying the interactions between multiple types of Dirac fermions and usual Schrödinger fermions. Such a Dirac point on the high-symmetry line was previously predicted in a few nanostructured materials.38,39 Remarkably, the dispersion curve around the Dirac point of the four HJs is almost linear, suggesting that the effective mass of carrier is small and the carrier mobility is high, which may suppress charge recombination effectively, inhibit backward reactions and offer potential advantages for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance.
We know that one can confirm whether HJs have photocatalytic properties by comparing the position of the band edge with respect to the water redox potential.33,40–43 However, the situation in our work is different. The Xene exhibits a very small gap, and behaves more like a metal other than a semiconductor at room temperature. Therefore, we refer to the scheme proposed by Subramanian et al.,44 in which Xene is treated as a metal, and analyze how the photocatalytic performance of BiOCl/Xene HJs could be improved from the perspective of energy levels. The schematic energy level disposition for the pristine BML and Xene is shown in Fig. 4(e). Because the work function (W = Evac − EF) value of Xene (4.52–4.65 eV) is more negative than that of BML (7.44 eV), the electron transfer occurs from Xene to BML and the EF of the HJ systems equilibrate when they are in contact. The accumulation of electrons inevitably causes shifting of the apparent Fermi level (EF*).44 The EF of a semiconductor is directly related to the number of accumulated electrons which is defined as EF = ECB + kTlnnc/Nc, where ECB is the conduction band energy level versus NHE, nc is the density of accumulated electrons, and Nc is the charge carrier density of the semiconductor. More electron accumulation leads to a more negative shift. However, the EF of Xene is not negative enough to shift the EF* to the flat band potential of BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs and the bandgap of BML in BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs is nearly the same as that of BML. When the BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs are excited by ultraviolet light, the photo-generated electrons are distributed between BML and Xene. The transfer of electrons from the excited BML to Xene continues until the two systems reach equilibration. Since the electron accumulation increases the EF of Xene to more negative potentials and might cause a cathodic shift of the EF*, the resultant EF of the HJs shifts closer to the conduction band of the BML. The negative shift in the EF is an indication of better charge separation and improves the energetics of the HJs systems, indicating a higher conduction band position and more reductive power than that of the pristine BML system. Fig. 4(f) illustrates the shift in the Fermi level of the HJs as a result of charge equilibration between BML and Xene.
The optical absorption of the bilayer HJs was also studied. Since the imaginary part (ε2(ω)) (the true transition between the occupied and the unoccupied electronic states) is related to the energy dissipation in the medium, it can be used to describe the optical absorption characteristics of the bilayer HJs. The formula of ε2(ω) is defined as,45  
where Ω represents the unit cell volume, ω represents the photon frequency, the indices c and v represent the conduction band state and the valence band state, respectively, uck is the cell period part of the orbital at the k-point k, and the vectors eα are the unit vectors for the three Cartesian directions, respectively. Although BML only absorbs ultraviolet (UV) light (3.29 eV), as shown in Fig. 4(f), the Xene absorbs visible light and then the photo-generated electrons can be transferred between the BML and Xene layers according to the previous plane-averaged charge density difference and Bader analysis, which is good for utilizing visible light for photocatalytic activities. It is noted that the prominent optical properties of Xene (silicene and germanene) are related to their gaps at the Γ point, and the optical responses vary from ultraviolet to infrared in the parallel polarization direction.46 Therefore, when BML and Xene form bilayer HJs, the light absorption in the visible light region will be enhanced. As shown in Fig. 4(a)–(d), since the gap at the Γ point decreases from B/S to B/G, B/G will have the strongest light absorption. In order to qualitatively compare the quantum yields (QY) of the BiOCl/Xene and BiOCl/graphene bilayer HJs, which is an important parameter for the measurement of materials’ electrical sensitivity to light,47 an effective figure of merit (the gray line with shaded areas and the right axis with arbitrary units) has been calculated as shown in Fig. 4(g)–(k). The formula is defined as QY ∝ ωS(ω)ε‖(ω), where ω is the photon frequency, S(ω) is the solar spectrum, and ε‖(ω) is the parallel component of the imaginary dielectric function. While other effects such as surface and interface scattering are neglected, the contribution of the transverse component of the imaginary dielectric function is clearly overestimated.47 As can be seen from the figures, if we ignore the influence of structural and calculated parameter differences, the light absorption characteristics of the BiOCl/graphene bilayer HJs are weaker than those of the BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs. Among them, B/G has the largest QY value (7.57), suggesting the greatest photocatalytic potential.
Since it was reported that strain can enhance the photocatalytic activities of BiOCl,43,48 we further investigated the strain effect on the bilayer BiOCl/Xene HJs. The strain energy was calculated as ΔE = Ea − Ea0, where Ea and Ea0 denote the total energy of the deformed and freestanding BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), ΔE increases monotonously whether there is an increase or decrease in in-plane strain, suggesting that the applied strain is in the range of elastic deformation. All of the bilayer HJs maintain the Dirac cones in the Y–Γ direction under biaxial and uniaxial tensile strains. Interestingly, as the biaxial compressive strain increases, except B/G continuing to maintain its metallicity, the other three HJs open the bandgaps. Fig. 5(c)–(f) show the band structure diagram of the bilayer HJs under biaxial compressive strain. It can be seen that in most cases, the Dirac cones are still maintained. The bandgap values are shown in Table 2. As shown by the PDOS diagram in Fig. S-2 and S-3 (ESI†), the biaxial tensile strain has little effect on the p orbits of the Bi atoms and the BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs continue to maintain their metallicity. When the compressive strain increases, the metal-to-semiconductor transition of the bilayer HJs is realized by effectively adjusting the p-orbitals of the Bi, Si and Ge atoms near the EF. Under certain uniaxial compressive strain, the BiOCl/Xene bilayer HJs open the bandgaps (from Fig. S-4 to S-7, ESI†). The uniaxial strain also modulates the bandgap mainly by adjusting the p states of the Si, Ge and Bi atoms (from Fig. S-8 to S-11, ESI†). Considering that the PBE functional usually underestimates bandgaps by more than 50%,49 the compressive strain may actually open bandgaps more. Therefore, strain can also adjust the electronic and, hence, photocatalytic properties of the bilayer HJs.

4. Conclusions

The stable bilayer HJs with high separation efficiency and high mobility of photo-generated carriers and strain-adjustable bandgaps may provide varieties in the functionalities of 2D van der Waals HJs and show potential applications in electronic and photocatalytic materials and devices.
