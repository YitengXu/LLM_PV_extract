Introduction
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received enormous attention due to its high specificity in eliminating malignant tumor cells without interposing normal cells, as compared with chemotherapy.1,2 The key element of this treatment approach is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by photosensitizers (PSs) with an appropriate excitation light to cause cell death and tissue destruction.3 However, the clinical application of PDT sensitizers is still hindered due to the short lifetime (<0.04 μs), small radius of diffusion (<0.02 μm) of 1O2 and low levels of ROS production in aqueous media.4,5 Therefore, it is important to synthesize new PDT agents devoid of these shortcomings while meeting the vital criteria for PDT cancer treatment.
The therapeutic effect of PDT is greatly influenced by the location of PSs inside the cells; hence, it is important to deliver the PSs toward subcellular organelles to improve therapeutic efficiency.6 Mitochondria are regarded as powerhouses to maintain tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. The ROS can cause the damage of mitochondria at the early stage of PDT treatment and maximize the PDT effect.7 Therefore, powerful tools can be developed that deliver subcellular organelle-specific ROS probes to cancer cells for treatment and imaging simultaneously. The precise image-guided PDT also facilitates studies on delivery kinetics, subcellular response, and therapeutic efficacy.8,9 Porphyrin and phenylthiazinium derivatives are the most widely employed PSs in PDT. However, the porphyrin derivatives are apt to aggregate in media due to their hydrophobicity. The disgusting aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) phenomenon not only leads to quenched fluorescence, but also reduces ROS generation of fluorescent (FL) PSs which largely compromised the efficiency of PDT.10,11
FL PSs with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics have recently captivated much interest. The AIE luminogens (AIEgens) which show high emission and efficient ROS production in the aggregated state provide a straightforward solution to the problem of ACQ.12–16 Tang et al. have designed and synthesized an AIE-active TPE derivative utilized as a mitochondrial imaging FL agent.12 Liu et al. reported a strategy to encapsulate AIEgens by lipid-PEG to yield bright red FL and enhanced ROS generation.11 The PSs with AIE characteristics are excellent candidates for PDT to yield bright emission and ROS for cancer cell ablation. A fluorophore that emits in the far red/near-infrared (FR/NIR, λ = 650–900 nm) region is beneficial to high penetration depth and low biological autofluorescence interference in bioimaging and PDT applications.17 However, an ideal PS that emits FR/NIR fluorescence and generates more ROS to kill cancer cells is urgently needed for biomedical applications. To date, although several AIE PSs were reported for PDT (Table S1, see ESI†), this ROS generation usually requires a light source with relatively high power density (≥100 mW cm−2)11,14–16 or a xenon lamp (500 W).13 Additionally, most AIEgens were encapsulated into nanoparticles (NPs) through physical interactions, which could probably reduce the stability of the corresponding NPs and induce the premature disassembling of AIEgens in complicated physiological environments. AIEgen-based linear polymer NPs were also not stable in dilute solution when the concentration was lower than the critical micelle concentration. In this case, the use of cross-linked polymer NPs is an effective strategy to increase the stability (Scheme 1).18,19

Very recently, we reported an AIEgen with high FR/NIR emission in the aggregated state and the solid state.20 Moreover, these AIEgens are able to generate high ROS under light irradiation. Here we fabricate a new AIE cross-linked copolymer (PAIE-TPP) NPs with FR/NIR bioimaging ability and high ROS generation for mitochondria-targeted and image-guided PDT. The PAIE-TPP NPs are negligibly cytotoxic for cells without light irradiation. However, they can generate ROS under general LED white light irradiation (4 mW cm−2) with an excellent ROS quantum yield of 77.9%. The MTT assay indicated that only 4% cancer cells survived after incubation with PAIE-TPP NPs (100 μg mL−1) and light irradiation (10 mW cm−2). Compared to high-power-density light irradiation, the low-power-density and commonly available white light is conducive to fabricate a low-cost and miniaturized light source. Additionally, the introduction of a triphenylphosphonium (TPP) unit to NPs is not only beneficial to target mitochondria for subcellular bioimaging but also beneficial to improve the PDT effect.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characteristics of the PAIE-TPP NPs
The AIE fluorophore cross-linked copolymers (PAIE-TPP and PAIE), possessing the segments of the AIE monomer (AIEM), N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate (AEMA), were synthesized following the synthetic route (Schemes S2 and S3 see the ESI†). The polymer PAIE-TPP was decorated with TPP as the mitochondria-target group and polymer PAIE without the TPP unit was synthesized using a similar procedure to that of PAIE-TPP. The molar ratio of HPMA, TPP, AIEM and AEMA was 100:23:22:5 for polymer PAIE-TPP and the molar ratio of HPMA, AIEM and AEMA was 100:14:3 for polymer PAIE, both of which were calculated by the ratios of the peak areas of the 1H NMR spectrum. The function of HPMA is supposed to reduce the cytotoxicity of the polymer due to the good biocompatibility of PHPMA. The use of AEMA is to enhance the cellular uptake of the polymers taking advantage of cationic amine groups.21 The morphology of PAIE-TPP NPs and PAIE NPs in DMSO/H2O (v/v = 2/98) mixtures is spherical in shape, as observed by SEM (Fig. S1, see the ESI†). The average diameters of PAIE-TPP and PAIE are 260 nm and 160 nm, respectively. The PAIE NPs and PAIE-TPP NPs could be well-dispersed in both culture medium and water, and their sizes remained constant for 7 days at 37 °C, indicating the good physical stability of these NPs at various concentrations (Fig. S2, see ESI†). The fluorescence quantum yield of PAIE-TPP NPs dispersed in aqueous solution is 3.6%.
The FL spectrum of AIEM ranges from 550 to 750 nm with a maximum emission at 647 nm (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, the AIEM shows no emission in pure THF. The aggregations of the AIEM is highly emissive in THF/water when the water fraction is above 50%, demonstrating remarkable AIE properties.

ROS generation
The efficient and continuous ROS generation is a critical step for PDT. Consequently, the ROS generation ability of the PAIE-TPP NPs under irradiation was measured. The ROS-sensitive probe dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) was used as the indicator. DCF-DA initially shows no fluorescence but can be rapidly oxidized to dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by ROS which emits green fluorescence. As depicted in Fig. 1D, the FL intensity of the ROS-sensitive probe in the presence of PAIE-TPP exhibits a quick time-dependent enhancement, with the FL intensity being increased 44 times, under low-power white light irradiation (4 mW cm−2), within 270 s, indicating that PAIE-TPP generates ROS very fast and efficiently. When the ROS scavenger Vitamin C was added, the fluorescence signal of DCF is inhibited (Fig. S5, see the ESI†).
PSs with a high ROS quantum yield is desirable to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic outcome. To access ROS quantum yield, 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis(methylene)dimalonic acid (ABDA) was used as the indicator. In this experiment, ABDA could undergo oxidation by ROS resulting in quick decomposition with a decrease in its absorbance. As shown in Fig. 1E, the absorbance of ABDA in the presence of PAIE-TPP NPs was recorded. The absorption peaks of ABDA at 358, 378, and 400 nm decrease gradually under light irradiation, further confirming the ROS generation. The Rose Bengal (RB) was used as the standard reference with the ROS quantum yield of 75% in water. The ROS quantum yield of PAIE-TPP NPs was calculated to 77.9%, which is higher than those of the clinically used PS Photofrin (28%) and Laserphyrin (48%). Such a highly efficient ROS generating ability is desirable to increase the efficiency of PDT.22,23 The stability of PAIE-TPP NPs after irradiation for different times was evaluated by monitoring its absorbance at 500 nm. Nearly no attenuation in absorbance is found, indicating the good photostability of PAIE-TPP NPs (Fig. S7, see the ESI†). Additionally, a small energy gap (ΔEst) between the lowest singlet-excited state (S1) and the lowest triplet-excited state (T1) is favorable for intersystem crossing (ISC) to process efficient ROS generation. The ΔEst value of the AIEM is around 0.277 eV (Fig. 1C), and such a small ΔEst value is expected to promote the ISC process efficiently, benefiting ROS generation.24,25
Cancer cell imaging
To achieve the specificity to mitochondria, we decorated the PAIE-TPP with TPP groups. Mitochondria can continuously oxidize substrates and maintain a proton gradient across the lipid bilayer with a very large membrane potential of around −180 mV. The large membrane potential can be used to deliver molecules to mitochondria by electrophoretic force.26,27 The surface zeta potentials of the PAIE-TPP NPs and PAIE NPs are 39 mV and 11.3 mV, respectively. The increased surface zeta potential of PAIE-TPP NPs implies the conjugation of TPP at the NP surface, which met the criteria for mitochondrial targeting. The commercially available Mito-Tracker Green (50 nM) was used as a mitochondrial stain. The images were monitored using a confocal laser microscope system (CLMS). As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S8 (ESI†), the FR/NIR fluorescence (collected at range of 662–737 nm) from PAIE-TPP NPs shows a clear characteristic mitochondrial network inside A549 cells, which is co-localized with green FL emitted from Mito-Tracker Green. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between PAIE-TPP emission and Mito-Tracker Green emission is calculated as 0.93, indicating its use as a FL probe for mitochondrial morphology imaging. In a control experiment, PAIE shows weak FL in A549 cells and some amount of PAIE NPs in the cytoplasm was observed, indicating that TPP is a mitochondrial targeting ligand. The difference in cellular uptake between PAIE NPs and PAIE-TPP NPs was confirmed using flow cytometry (Fig. S9, see ESI†). The result suggests that the conjunction of TPP in PAIE NPs can improve the cellular uptake. Similar results were observed in HeLa cells after incubation with PAIE-TPP NPs (Fig. S10, see the ESI†).

Intracellular ROS generation
The PAIE-TPP NPs can accumulate in mitochondria and produce ROS upon light irradiation in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3, no FL signal is detected without light irradiation, but an increased DCF fluorescence can be observed followed by white light irradiation. The FL intensity increases continuously under light irradiation. After 8 minutes, the FL signal becomes very strong. In addition, a very weak FL signal in cells is observed when Vitamin C is presented after light irradiation, confirming that the green FL is caused by ROS generation (Fig. S11, see the ESI†). These results further suggest that the PAIE-TPP NPs can generate ROS with the complexity of biological systems. The generated intracellular ROS of PAIE NPs as a control under the same test conditions was measured. The FL intensity of DCF of the PAIE NPs increases slowly in comparison to that of the PAIE-TPP NPs (Fig. S12, see ESI†), indicating lower ROS generation of PAIE NPs in cells. As a result of flow cytometry, the cellular uptake of PAIE NPs is lower than that of PAIE-TPP NPs, so it is reasonable that there is lower cellular uptake and lower ROS generation in cells.

Cytotoxicity studies
Low cytotoxicity in the dark but high toxicity upon light exposure are essential for PDT. The cytotoxicity of PAIE-TPP NPs with living cells was examined using the MTT assay (Fig. 4). In the absence of light, PAIE-TPP NPs are negligibly cytotoxic for cells incubated with different NP concentrations. In order to maximize the therapeutic effect of PDT, we increased the power density and prolonged the irradiation time in the MTT assay. The cell viability is only 4% for both cancer cells after incubation with PAIE-TPP NPs (100 μg mL−1) and light irradiation. A very high cytotoxicity of PAIE-TPP NPs is observed under general LED white light irradiation (10 mW cm−2). Additionally, the cytotoxicity of PAIE-TPP NPs is much higher than that of PAIE NPs without the TPP unit under the same light irradiation (Fig. S13, see ESI†), and the result further suggests that TPP as a mitochondrial targeting ligand is not only beneficial to target mitochondria for subcellular bioimaging but also beneficial to improve the PDT effect. No significant cytotoxicity is observed in cells with light irradiation only (Fig. S14, see ESI†), indicating that such low power-density irradiation has little photothermal effect. Therefore, PAIE-TPP NPs exhibit outstanding PDT activity to trigger malignant cell death.

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated mitochondria-targeted NPs using a new AIE cross-linked copolymer with FR/NIR subcellular bioimaging ability and a high ROS quantum yield of 77.9%. Cell viability studies revealed that the PAIE-TPP NPs possess great cytocompatibility in the dark but exert severe cytotoxicity to cancer cells upon cost-effective ultralow power white light irradiation (10 mW cm−2). The AIE cross-linked copolymer provides a new platform for efficient image-guided and site-dependent PDT. With the development of implantable devices and a fibre-optic fluorescence microendoscope, in the future, these NPs, with an implantable low-power LED excitation source, are promising therapeutic candidates for cancer treatment.
