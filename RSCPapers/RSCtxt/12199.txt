    , Accepted 4th March 2011First published on 31st March 2011AbstractTwo new D–π–A type organic sensitizers, MP124 and MP-I-50, were synthesized and their electrochemical and spectroscopic properties studied. Efficiencies of DSSC devices utilizing these dyes were also investigated, where sensitization solvent, sensitization time and additive concentration were all varied. Under standard AM 1.5G simulated solar radiation, optimized MP124 devices show an efficiency of 7.45% (Voc = 0.73 V; Jsc = 14.44 mA cm−2; FF = 70%) while optimized MP-I-50 devices show an efficiency of 5.66% (Voc = 0.68 V; Jsc = 12.06 mA cm−2; FF = 69%). Transient absorption spectroscopy studies show that regeneration of dye cations by the red-ox electrolyte was more efficient in MP124cells which is attributed to its higher HOMO energy leading to greater driving force for the regeneration reaction. Transient photovoltage studies showed that electron lifetimes were longer lived in MP124 explaining the higher Voc for these cells compared to MP-I-50cells. DFT and MP2 calculations indicate that this is due to the greater tendency of MP-I-50 to form charge-transfer complexes with the I2 species in the electrolyte, due to the presence of an additional EDOT in its structure compared to MP124. This work highlights the effect that small changes to the sensitizer structure can have on the interfacial charge transfer reactions and ultimately on the device efficiency.

Broader context
Our work focuses on the study of the dye molecular structure vs. device efficiency relationship in dye sensitized solar cells. We illustrated, as an example, how small variations on the sensitizer structure affect not only the electron recombination dynamics between the photo-injected electrons and the oxidized electrolyte but also the regeneration reaction between the electrolyte and the oxidized dyes. Indeed, we have demonstrated that much careful control on the organic sensitizer molecular structure is needed if we aim to achieve light-to-energy conversion efficiencies similar to those values reported for their Ruthenium polypyridyl counterparts. Organic sensitizers must be synthesised not only to slow the recombination dynamics with the electrolyte but also to achieve efficient regeneration of their ground state.

1. Introduction

Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) based on nanocrystalline TiO2 have received a great deal of attention in the last two decades.1–3 With cell efficiencies already over 11% they are now justifiably considered as viable for large-scale commercial exploitation.4 Since the demonstration by Grätzel and O'Regan of the first efficient devices,3 the best DSSC performances have continued to be observed using Ru(II)polypyridyl dyes. However, there are a number of limitations concerning these sensitizers beyond the most obvious that they contain a costly precious metal component. They have relatively low molar absorption coefficients meaning TiO2 mesoporous films of over 10 µm need to be utilized in order to absorb all of the incident radiation. Devices made from films of such thicknesses can result in lower cell voltage due to increased recombination losses.5 Furthermore, barring some exceptions such as N749 (black dye)6 and latterly heteroleptic sensitizers such as C1014 that incorporate thiophene units into the ancillary bipyridyl ligand, Ru(II) polypyridyls show relatively poor absorption at wavelengths longer than 700 nm.
Utilization of organic dyes in DSSC can address many of these limitations.7 Coumarines,8,9 indolines,10,11perylenes,12–14 cyanines,15,16 hemicyanines,17porphyrins,18,19 squarines20,21 and phthalocyanines22 have all been utilized successfully in DSSC. They do not contain any metal centre and their red-ox and absorption properties can be readily tuned by facile structural modification. They have very high molar absorption coefficients meaning that thinner device architectures can be employed potentially making them more optimal for use in solid state DSSC. Nevertheless there are also a number of issues associated with organic dyes including poor stability and a tendency towards aggregation.23–25
More recently, organic sensitizers have achieved efficiencies which closely rival those of Ru(II) polypyridyls in DSSC, with a recent study reporting an efficiency of over 10%.26 Many of these sensitizers have the same structural motif in common, namely the donor–acceptor π conjugated (D–π–A) motif.27–32 The most common donors used are arylamines while the acceptor is usually the cyanoacrylate group. The π-bridge often consists of one or more thiophene units. Molecular orbital calculations for these sensitizers have shown that the HOMO is located on the arylamine donor unit whereas the LUMO is centered on the cyanoacrylate anchoring group resulting in efficient electron injection into the TiO2.33 Stability tests have also found these sensitizers to be extremely promising for use in DSSC.28,30,31
The operating principles of DSSCs are shown schematically in Fig. 1. Briefly, light is absorbed by the dye sensitizer and to create excited state (1). The excited molecule is a strong reductant that can inject an electron into the TiO2 conduction band (2) and the electron, which under the potential in the cell can be transported to the working electrode, generating electrical current. The oxidized dye formed after the electron injection is regenerated by the red-ox electrolyte (3). However, electrons in the nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2 can also recombine with either the oxidized dye (4) or oxidized electrolyte (5). The latter recombination process is particularly important in limiting efficiency in this type of solar cell device.

In this paper we present two new organic sensitizers from the D–π–A family, namely MP124 and MP-I-50 (Fig. 2). Their structures differ very slightly by the presence of two ethylenedioxythiophenes in the π bridge of MP-I-50 as opposed to a single ethylenedioxythiophene and a thiophene in the case of MP124. However, this subtle structural change has a large effect upon efficiency for cell devices based on these sensitizers. Herein we explain the difference in DSSC performance utilizing these sensitizers principally by monitoring the electron transfer processes in complete devices, with the aid of first-principles computer simulations, and we discuss the results with reference to design rules for optimized dye sensitizers for DSSC.7

2. Experimental section
2.1. Optical, electrochemical, and spectroscopic measurements
The UV-Visible and fluorescence spectra of solutions in 1 cm path length quartz cells were recorded using a Shimadzu™ UV-1700 spectrophotometer and an Aminco-Bowman™ Series 2 luminescence spectrometer with a temperature controller, respectively. The electrochemical data were obtained employing a conventional three-electrode cell connected to a CH Instruments™ 660c potentiostat–galvanostat. For square wave voltammetry, a platinum working electrode, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum wire as the auxiliary electrode were used. The laser transient absorption spectroscopy (L-TAS) measurements were carried out by the same procedure as Durrant et al.34,35 employing a PTI nitrogen dye laser and a 150 W tungsten lamp as the light probe. The charge extraction and transient photovoltage (TPV) decay measurements were carried out with a set-up similar to that employed by O'Regan et al.36,37
2.2. Device preparation
In the present work two different types of devices are utilized depending on the measurements being conducted. Highly transparent thin film devices were utilized for TAS experiments. These devices were made using 9 µm thick films and sensitized with the organic dyes until the absorbance reach 0.5 au at the maximum absorption wavelength. On the other hand, for optimized cell efficiencies, devices were made using 13 µm thick films consisting of a layer of 9 µm of 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (Dyesol© paste) and a layer of 4 µm of 400 nm TiO2 particles (scatter layer). Prior to the deposition of the TiO2 paste the conducting glass substrates were immersed in a solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) for 30 minutes and then dried. The TiO2 nanoparticle paste was deposited onto a conducting glass substrate (Hartford Glass inc. with 15 Ω sq−1 resistance) using the screen printing technique. The TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an airflow at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min and 500 °C for 15 min. The heated TiO2 electrodes were immersed again in a solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with ethanol. The electrodes were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled before dye adsorption. For the thin film devices the area was 1 cm2 while for the optimized thick film DSSC the active area was 0.16 cm2. The counter electrode was made by spreading a 10 mM solution of H2PtCl6 in ethanol onto a conducting glass substrate with a small hole to allow the introduction of the liquid electrolyte using vacuum, followed by heating at 390 °C for 15 minutes. A batch of solutions of both dyes at concentrations of 300 µM in various solvents was prepared and the film immersed at room temperature for a variety of time periods. The sensitized electrodes were washed with ethanol and dried under air. Finally, the working and counter electrodes were sandwiched together using a thin thermoplastic (Surlyn) frame that melts at 100 °C. Two different electrolytes were used depending on the characterization technique used. For efficient solar cells the electrolyte EL1 consisted of 1 M buthyl-methyl imidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.05 M lithium iodide, 0.03 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15). For thin film cells, the electrolyte EL2 was used which is the same as EL1 minus tert-butylpyridine.
2.3. Device characterization
The photovoltaic measurements were carried out with a 150 W solar simulator from ABET© Technologies with the appropriated set of filters for the correct simulation of the 1.5 AM G solar spectrum. The incident light power was measured to be 1000 W m−2 with a calibrated silicon photodiode. The applied potential and cell current were measured with a Keithley™ 2400 digital source meter. Current versus voltage (I–V) curves were measured automatically with home-built Labview© software. Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out with a home made setup, consisting of a 150 W Oriel Xenon lamp, a motorized monochromator and a Keithley™ 2400 digital source meter. An integrating sphere was employed in order to provide homogeneous monochromatic light distribution over the active area of the devices. In addition, the photocurrent and irradiated light intensity were measured simultaneously.
2.4. Theoretical approach
Calculations on the structure and simulated spectra were performed through density functional theory, DFT, and its extension to the time-dependent formulation, TDDFT, as implemented in Gaussian program suite.38 The ground state geometries for both protonated and deprotonated versions of the MP124 and MP-I-50dyes were optimized in gas-phase within the B3LYP functional39 with the 6-31G* basis set.40 At the optimized ground state geometries we performed TDDFT (MPW1K/6-31G*)41 excited state calculations in gas phase as well as in acetonitrile, adopting the non-equilibrium conductor-like polarization model, CPCM.42
Following the strategy previously proposed by some of us43 we investigated the aggregation patterns and the optical response of MP124 and MP-I-50 adsorbed on a (101) (TiO2)82 anatase slab of approximately 4 nm2 area. We selected among all the possible dimeric configurations the closest interacting ones with no explicit superposition of atomic structures. The nomenclature we used to label the dimers is illustrated in Fig. 6, along with a top view of the anatase TiO2 (101) surface. Keeping fixed the position of the molecule placed in (0,0), each dimer is labeled by the (x,y) coordinates of the second molecule. Therefore, the dimers of MP124 and MP-I-50 considered here are labeled as (−1,1), (1,1) and (−4,0). For each configuration, the geometries of the dyes adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface have been optimized by using the tight-binding approach implemented in the DFTB program.44
The relative stability of the optimized configurations has been evaluated by single point MP2 calculations on the deprotonated dimers in solution, taking the optimized geometries of the dyes adsorbed onto TiO2. Both MP2 and TDDFT calculations were carried out with the same 6-31G* basis set.
To evaluate dye/iodine interactions, additional DFT calculations were performed by the B3LYP functional using a 6-311G** basis set. Single point calculations and MP2 geometry optimizations have been performed by the RI-MP245 implementation available in the TURBOMOLE program,46 using an SV(P) basis set.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Spectral and electrochemical properties
The UV-Visible spectra of D–π–A organic dyes containing basic triphenylamine acting as the donor group and an acidic cyanoacetic acid acting as the acceptor group are highly dependent upon the degree of protonation.32 Therefore the workup described in the Experimental section and the solvent used for measuring the spectra can lead to a mixture of different protonated, deprotonated, neutral and zwitterionic species (see ESI S1–S3†). In order to achieve comparable conditions not only in solution, but also on the TiO2 film, a basic medium was induced by adding small aliquots of triethylamine, leading to only fully deprotonated dye species.
The absorption maxima of MP124 and MP-I-50 in ACN/tBuOH solution are 460 nm and 480 nm respectively (fig. 3). The 20 nm red-shift for MP-I-50 compared to MP124 can be ascribed to the greater electron-donating ability of the two ethylenedioxythiophenes in the π-bridge of this dye. Upon anchoring the sensitizers to the TiO2 electrode these absorption maxima remain the same indicating that the dyes on the film were mainly in the deprotonated form.
 Fig. 3  Normalized UV-Visible spectra of MP124 (solid line) and MP-I-50 (dashed line) in ACN/tBuOH with 2% TEA (left) and on nanocrystalline TiO2 film (right). 
The oxidation potentials for both dyes were acquired by square wave voltammetry (Fig. 4) in CH2Cl2. The HOMO level was estimated from the equation EHOMO (vs. vacuum) = −4.88 − E1/2 (vs. Fc/Fc+)47 yielding values of −5.08 eV and −5.02 eV vs. vacuum for MP124 and MP-I-50, respectively. These values ensure efficient regeneration of both of these dyes by the iodide/tri-iodide red-ox electrolyte (Eredox = −4.75 eV) in functioning cells. These data agree with the HOMO energy difference of 0.07 eV observed in the molecular calculations; see Fig. 5 and discussion below. The LUMO levels were described as ELUMO = EHOMO + E0–0, where E0–0 is the energy optical gap, estimated from the intersection of the excitation and the emission spectra. The experimental values of the fluorescence and the excitation intersection (see ESI S4†) gave an energy optical gap of 2.39 eV and 2.34 eV, leading a LUMO of −2.69 eV and −2.68 eV vs. vacuum for MP124 and MP-I-50, respectively. The calculated levels are positioned at about −2.30 eV in ACN, in reasonable agreement with the above data. Thus, the high LUMO energy level position with respect to the conduction band of TiO2 (ETiO2 = −4.0 eV) shows that electron injection is energetically possible from the excited state of each dye.

The calculated lowest excitation energies reported in Table 1 for both protonated (1H) and deprotonated (0H) dyes in acetonitrile are in fairly good agreement with the corresponding experimental values, also suggesting that the dyes in solution are present essentially in their deprotonated form. Although slightly overestimating the absorption energy maximum for MP-I-50, the calculated data qualitatively reproduce the spectral red-shift observed by inserting a second EDOT moiety into MP-I-50 with respect to MP124.

A schematic representation of the frontier molecular orbitals for MP124 and MP-I-50 is reported in Fig. 5, along with isodensity plots of the HOMOs and LUMOs for the two dyes. In agreement with the squarewave voltammetry data discussed above, for both the protonated and deprotonated dyes the HOMO of MP-I-50 is slightly destabilized compared to that of MP124, reflecting the increased electron donation exerted by the second EDOT moiety in the MP-I-50dye. In both dyes, HOMO and LUMO are localized on the donor and acceptor groups of the molecules, respectively. The LUMOs extend in both cases throughout the cyanoacrylic moieties, ensuring a strong coupling of the dye excited state with the semiconductor surface.
3.2. 
          Dye/TiO2 interaction
To investigate the dye packing on the TiO2 surface, we selected among all of the possible dimeric configurations originating by docking the MP124 and MP-I-50dyes onto the anatase TiO2 (101) surface, the closest interacting dimeric arrangements with no explicit atomic superposition. The nomenclature we used to label the dimers is illustrated in Fig. 6. Keeping fixed the position of the molecule placed in (0,0), each dimer is labeled by the (x,y) coordinates of the second molecule. Therefore, the dimers of MP124 and MP-I-50 considered here are labeled as (−1,1) and (1,1) and (−4,0).
 Fig. 6  Graphical representation of the (101) TiO2 anatase surface. The scheme illustrates the convention adopted to indicate the relative positions of two molecules: each couple is labeled with the (x,y) coordinates of the second molecule, being the first one conventionally fixed in (0,0). 
The optimized molecular structures of the investigated dimeric arrangements are shown in Fig. 7 along with their relative stability evaluated at the MP2 level for both MP124 and MP-I-50, the most stable dimeric configuration is that termed (−1,1), see Fig. 6 and 7, which guarantees a weaker interaction among the O–R chains with respect to the (1,1) arrangement, being about 4.0 kcal mol−1 higher in energy; this result, however, is not surprising considering that the dyes have rather similar molecular structures, that arguably yield similar packing on the TiO2 surface. For MP124, the highest energy structure (+5.84 kcal mol−1) is the (−4,0) configuration, where the molecules are placed side-by-side and hence there is no stabilization arising from π–π stacking interactions. We therefore disregarded this configuration for MP-I-50.
 Fig. 7  Optimized molecular structures of the investigated dimeric arrangements (−1,1) MP124, (1,1) MP124, (−4,0) MP124 (top) and (−1,1) MP-I-50 and (1,1) MP-I-50 (bottom). Binding energies (kcal mol−1) relative to the more stable dimeric arrangements are also reported. 
The stability of the aggregates with respect to the non-interacting monomers can be estimated as the difference between the energy of the dimer and twice the energy of the isolated molecule at the same level of calculation. From MP2 calculations on the most stable (−1,1) dimeric configurations of MP124 and MP-I-50 we obtained comparable stabilization energies for the two dyes, differing by less than 2.0 kcal mol−1, showing that the two dyes have similar tendency, to our level of resolution, to form close packing aggregates on the TiO2 surface.
We report in Table 2 the excitation energies and the oscillator strengths of the two lowest excited states for the most stable (−1,1) dimeric configurations. As can be noticed, for both MP124 and MP-I-50, there is a negligible impact of the dye aggregation on the absorption spectra, in line with the rather similar spectra measured in solution and upon adsorption onto TiO2. The computed absorption maxima of the monomers are 2.78 (MP124) and 2.71 (MP-I-50) eV with oscillator strengths of 1.614 and 1.663 respectively (Table 1) whereas for the (−1,1) dimers we calculate slightly red-shifted peaks at 2.63 (MP124) and 2.61 eV (MP-I-50) with oscillator strengths being almost twice those of the monomers. The dimeric arrangements all show a low-energy transition that is absent in the monomer, which is a typical signature of intermolecular interactions. Nevertheless these transitions have quite small oscillator strengths, suggesting that their impact on the absorption spectra of the dyes adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface is rather small. The small coupling originating the almost zero oscillator strengths of the low-energy transitions can be related to the fact that in the (−1,1) dimeric arrangement the thiophenes of one molecule are overlapping with the 3,4-ethylenedioxy-moiety of the other molecule (see Fig. 7). Since the 3,4-ethylenedioxy-moiety group does not possess a π-framework, limited π-stacking interaction occurs, with a consequently small perturbation of the excited states.

3.3. Photovoltaic performance
The effect of dye sensitization solvent, co-adsorbents and sensitization time on DSSC performance was tested for both dyes, with the most efficient results summarized in Table 3. As an aside, it was found that if the sensitization time exceeds the optimal, the current can drop by up to 50% (results not shown), which suggests that D–π–A type dyes can aggregate easily on the TiO2 surface quenching dye excited states leading to poor photocurrent generation.

From the values listed in the table above the solvent clearly plays a key role in determining DSSC performance. The best solar cell performances for MP124 were obtained with ACN/tBuOH, while in chlorobenzene and THF the efficiency drops by 10% and 30% respectively. Likewise the cell performances for MP-I-50 also varied with solvent. Investigations into this behavior are on going and shall be discussed in future publications.
3.4. Interfacial charge transfer kinetics
To explain the substantial difference in device efficiency observed in Fig. 8, we studied the interfacial charge transfer processes in MP124 and MP-I-50 devices. The yield of electron injection from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band on the TiO2 can be estimated using steady state fluorescence by comparing emission spectra of dye sensitized TiO2 and Al2O3 films acquired under identical conditions (see ESI S5†). The conduction band of Al2O3 is higher than the LUMO of most dyes absorbing in the UV-Visible so it acts as an insulating material blocking electron injection. Thus, we compared the emission of Al2O3 sensitized films, where injection is unlikely; with TiO2 dye sensitized films, where electron injection is efficient. This provides an estimation of the yield of electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band and thus, electron injection yields of higher than 72% were estimated for both MP124 and MP-I-50. This identical yield is not surprising as the estimated LUMO energy levels for both dyes are the same and therefore electron injection is expected to have the same driving force for MP124 and MP-I-50 sensitized TiO2.

Laser transient absorbance spectroscopy (L-TAS) can be used to monitor the charge recombination of electrons in the TiO2 with the oxidized dye.48,49 The inset of Fig. 9 shows the dye cation spectrum at 1 µs following laser excitation at 470 nm where the maximum dye cation absorption is centered at 780 nm. The recombination kinetics were measured for both dyes at this wavelength and the corresponding decay was fitted to a stretched exponential function48 as shown in eqn (1): (1)where A1 (a.u.) is a constant, τ (s) is the electron recombination lifetime and β (a.u.) is the deviation from fully mono-exponential decay dynamics as a consequence of the electron trapping/detrapping processes occurring in the nanocrystalline TiO2 film. As can be seen in Fig. 9, charge recombination is almost identical for both samples with similar lifetimes of 227 µs and 850 µs recorded for MP124 and MP-I-50 respectively. Furthermore, β was found to be the same for both decays (0.18) indicating that recombination is dominated by electron transport in the TiO2 film. Thus, the interfacial dynamics between the electrons at the TiO2 and the oxidized dyes cannot explain the difference in efficiency obtained for the DSSC devices. It should be pointed out that measurements using dyes where the degree of protonation is not controlled lead to vastly different results as shown in ESI S6†.

The films were excited with a 470 nm laser pulse and the decay kinetics were monitored at 780 nm. The inset shows the cation spectrum acquired at 1 µs following 470 nm laser excitation. 
The recombination of injected electrons with the oxidized red-ox electrolyte was also investigated and to do this charge extraction and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were employed.50–52 Differences in recombination kinetics between different dyes in DSSCs can be due to (a) the shift in the conduction band of TiO2 when these dyes are immobilized onto the TiO2 surface (b) the different degree of surface blocking layer due to the dye packing despite the fact that adsorption kinetics are identical (0.91 min−1) and (c) inherent structural properties of the individual dye which can form charge-transfer complexes with the I3− and/or I2 in the electrolyte. The charge density as a function of cell voltage is shown in Fig. 10 (left) indicating that the shift in conduction band for devices containing these dyes is not significant so the hypothesis (a) can be discarded. The hypothesis (b) can also be discarded due to the similar structure and size of both dyes, suggesting similar dye packing on the TiO2 surface,53 as confirmed by the theoretical calculations discussed previously. Therefore, we can assume that the differences in the e−TiO2/electrolyte+ recombination rate in MP124 and MP-I-50cells as evidenced by the TPV measurements for these devices are due to inherent structural properties of the individual dyes, i.e. hypothesis (c). TPV transients were acquired at different charge densities and electron recombination lifetimes for each TPV are plotted together in Fig. 10 (right). Slower recombination dynamics (i.e. longer electron lifetimes) were observed for MP124, which explains both the higher voltage for these devices compared with MP-I-50 based devices. This difference in charge separation lifetime may be explained due to possible electrolyte/dye interactions. Several authors have reported that atoms such as oxygen and sulfur can bind I3− and/or I2 species forming charge-transfer complexes.54,55 This can lead to a higher concentration of these species at the TiO2 surface, catalyzing e−TiO2/electrolyte+ recombination. Therefore, MP-I-50, which contains two additional oxygen atoms in the π bridge compared to MP124, would be expected to better bind I3− and/or I2 species leading to faster recombination pathways.

The higher photocurrent obtained for MP124 cannot be explained by either differences in electron injection or the recombination of injected electrons in the TiO2 with either dye+ or electrolyte+. Therefore, the regeneration of oxidized dye by electrolyte process was investigated as a possible reason. This was achieved by measuring thin film solar cells under 1 sun light irradiation in a similar fashion to O'Regan and co-workers.56 The resultant kinetics show a typical biphasic decay with the fast component due to loss of the dye cation signal due to regeneration of the oxidized dye and the slower long lived component due to electrons in TiO2 film.57 As is shown in Fig. 11, the regeneration is four times faster for MP124 which can be explained because the HOMO energy level is lower for MP124, leading to higher driving force for the regeneration reaction. Thus, higher photocurrent for MP124 can also be explained by more efficient regeneration kinetics.
 Fig. 11  Transient absorption kinetics of thin film solar cells of MP124 (black) and MP-I-50 (grey) recorded at 1 sun. After applying a pulse at 470 nm, the oxidized cation was monitored at 780 nm (inset, Fig. 9). 

TAS measurements were also conducted monitoring at 980 nm (Fig. 12). At this wavelength, the transient absorption intensity of the dye cation of both MP124 and MP-I-50 is lower and the contribution of the signal of the electrons in the TiO2 conduction band is much larger, as demonstrated previously.56 The longer lived component of these transient absorption decays was compared with TPV decays at operational conditions of 1 sun. They can be seen to match quite well, indicating that the slower decay component of the transient absorption kinetics is due to the electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 recombining with the red-ox electrolyte.

In light of the results of TPV and TAS investigations discussed above, calculations investigating the binding of I2 to the MP-I-50dye were performed. Since the only difference between the two dyes is the presence of a second EDOT group in the structure of MP-I-50, we preliminarily investigated the interaction of I2 with the oxygen and sulfur atoms of the EDOT and thiophene moieties (Fig. 13). Considering the expectedly weak interaction between I2 and EDOT/thiophene groups, we employed MP2 single point energy evaluations on the DFT-optimized geometries, to provide a more realistic estimate of the binding energies. By doing so, we calculate interaction energies of −6.9 and −5.1 kcal mol−1 between the I2 molecule and the oxygen and sulfur atoms of the EDOT moiety, respectively. Notably, replacing the EDOT by a thiophene leads to a reduced interaction energy with the sulfur atom of −4.5 kcal mol−1. To check the consistency of DFT and MP2 data, we repeated the geometry optimizations at the MP2 level, finding differences in the interaction energies within 0.4 kcal mol−1. Motivated by these results, we employed the combined DFT/MP2 approach to investigate I2 binding to both oxygen- and sulfur groups of MP-I-50, denoted EDOT-O-I2, 1-EDOT-S-O-I2 and 2-EDOT-S-O-I2 in Fig. 13, respectively. We calculate MP2 binding energies of 8.1, 8.0 and 7.3 kcal mol−1 for EDOT-O-I2, 1-EDOT-S-O-I2 and 2-EDOT-S-O-I2, respectively. The lower interaction energy calculated for the 2-EDOT-S-O-I2 adduct is reflected by the long bonding distances between I2 and the sulfur and oxygen atoms, 3.99 and 3.35 Å, respectively, while the oxygen–I2 distance is computed 2.93 Å. As a final check of the mixed DFT/MP2 computational approach, we further optimized the geometry of MP-I-50-EDOT-O-I2 at the MP2 level, finding a binding energy of −9.6 kcal mol−1 in correspondence of an oxygen–iodine distance of 2.86 Å. Finally, considering the reduced binding energy calculated for the I2-free thiophene adduct, an even lower I2–dye interaction is foreseen for the MP124, in which only the EDOT-S-I2 type of adduct can be attained.
 Fig. 13  Optimized molecular structures of the EDOT-O-I2 (a) and 1-EDOT-S-O-I2 (b) and (c) adducts of MP-I-50. Iodine atoms are in purple, carbon in green, sulfur in yellow, nitrogen in blue, oxygen in red, hydrogen in white. 
Thus, it seems that I2 binding to the “upper” EDOT group of MP-I-50 is energetically feasible, accounting, at least from a speculative point of view, for the TPV data showing increased recombination between injected electrons and oxidized species in the electrolyte. As a possible confirmation of this hypothesis, we notice that fast charge recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface was observed for the C217dye, also bearing an EDOT group, under certain experimental conditions.27 Similar behavior has also been observed in a recent photovoltaic investigation on the EDOT-containing PAB-3dye.58 Molecular structures of C217 and PAB-3dyes can be found in the ESI†.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized two push pull organic dyes featuring triphenylamine as donor and cyanoacrylic acid as acceptor. The π-conjugated system was a binary spacer consisting of either two 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene units, MP-I-50, or one 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and one thiophene unit, MP124. The DSSC performance gave both higher photocurrent and voltage for MP124 devices, which were attributed to faster regeneration dynamics and slower e−TiO2/electrolyte+ recombination kinetics, respectively. The faster regeneration dynamics can be correlated with the molecular structure due to the lower HOMO energy of MP124, which increased the regeneration driving force. Quantum mechanical calculations confirm the HOMO offset of the two dyes and show similar packing motifs when adsorbed on the TiO2 surface. The recombination of the electrons in the conduction band with oxidized species in the electrolyte could be correlated to the dye/electrolyte interactions, as confirmed by quantum chemical calculations showing a sizable interaction between the oxygen atoms of the EDOT group and I2. MP-I-50, which contains two EDOT groups, can thus interact with oxidized species in the electrolyte and possibly increase their concentration close to the TiO2 surface, thus enhancing the recombination rate and penalizing the overall photovoltaic efficiency.

Broader context
Our work focuses on the study of the dye molecular structure vs. device efficiency relationship in dye sensitized solar cells. We illustrated, as an example, how small variations on the sensitizer structure affect not only the electron recombination dynamics between the photo-injected electrons and the oxidized electrolyte but also the regeneration reaction between the electrolyte and the oxidized dyes. Indeed, we have demonstrated that much careful control on the organic sensitizer molecular structure is needed if we aim to achieve light-to-energy conversion efficiencies similar to those values reported for their Ruthenium polypyridyl counterparts. Organic sensitizers must be synthesised not only to slow the recombination dynamics with the electrolyte but also to achieve efficient regeneration of their ground state.

 	Fig. 9  Charge recombination dynamics for a 4 µm thick dye sensitized TiO2 film (λex = 0.5 a.u.) of MP124 (black) and MP-I-50 (grey). The films were excited with a 470 nm laser pulse and the decay kinetics were monitored at 780 nm. The inset shows the cation spectrum acquired at 1 µs following 470 nm laser excitation.	 

 	Fig. 10  Charge extraction measurements showing electron density as a function of cell voltage (left) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements expressing electron recombination lifetime e−TiO2/electrolyte+ as a function of cell electron density (right) for efficient MP124 (black) and MP-I-50 (grey) solar cells.	 

 	Fig. 11  Transient absorption kinetics of thin film solar cells of MP124 (black) and MP-I-50 (grey) recorded at 1 sun. After applying a pulse at 470 nm, the oxidized cation was monitored at 780 nm (inset, Fig. 9).	 

 	Fig. 12  Comparison of transient absorption and transient photovoltage transients of thin film cells of MP124 (left) and MP-I-50 (right) at 1 sun. After applying a laser pulse at 470 nm, TPV transients (black line) were recorded, followed by TAS transients (grey line) at 980 nm.	 

 	Fig. 13  Optimized molecular structures of the EDOT-O-I2 (a) and 1-EDOT-S-O-I2 (b) and (c) adducts of MP-I-50. Iodine atoms are in purple, carbon in green, sulfur in yellow, nitrogen in blue, oxygen in red, hydrogen in white.
