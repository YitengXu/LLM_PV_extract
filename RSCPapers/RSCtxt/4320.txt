    , Accepted 3rd November 2020First published on 3rd November 2020AbstractHalide perovskites have received significant attention as materials for various electronic applications such as photovoltaic cells, photodetectors, light emitting diodes, and sensors, owing to their outstanding and unique properties such as high power conversion efficiency, tunable bandgap, solution based processability, and high absorption coefficient. Recently, in addition, halide perovskites have shown excellent piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties comparable to those of conventional inorganic piezoelectric materials. However, despite the development of various halide perovskite materials with excellent piezoelectric properties, understanding of piezoelectricity in halide perovskites is still further required to realize practical piezoelectric applications. In this review, we present an overview of the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of halide perovskites and summarize the recent progress in halide perovskite based piezoelectric energy harvesters. The aim herein is to describe the fundamental understanding of piezoelectricity of various halide perovskite materials and the factors to be considered for the development of high-performance piezoelectric energy harvesters. First, we discuss in detail the crystal structure, and the dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of the halide perovskite materials depending on the temperature, poling process, illumination, and material compositions to develop high-performance piezoelectric materials. Thereafter, various types of halide perovskites such as thin film and nanocomposite based piezoelectric energy harvesters are introduced. We believe this review article will serve as a useful guide to the design of piezoelectric materials and applications based on halide perovskites.
1. Introduction
With the development of wireless-sensor-based Internet of things (IoT) network technology, energy harvesting technologies have attracted intensive attention for solving the sustainable power issues of wireless sensors. Wireless sensors are important elements of IoT technology; they collect and transmit information such as movement, sound, temperature, electric current, light, or other properties. In general, batteries are used to drive various sensors, but maintenance and disposal problems in driving hundreds of thousands of future IoT sensors exist. Energy harvesting technology that can convert environmental energy into electrical energy has been extensively studied as an alternative energy source to overcome the limitations of batteries.1–7 This technology harvests electrical energy from external factors, such as surrounding vibration, light, and heat, using various energy conversion mechanisms. Piezoelectric and triboelectric effects can convert mechanical energy, such as vibration and pressure, into electrical energy.8–14 Thermoelectric and pyroelectric effects can convert thermal energy into electrical energy.15–19 The photovoltaic effect can convert solar energy into electrical energy.20–25 Solar cells and solar energy harvesters are substantial energy sources and provide a high energy conversion efficiency, but they are limited by weather, time, and space. In contrast, mechanical energy harvesters have fewer environmental constraints, such as weather, time, and space, than thermal or solar energy harvesters because mechanical energy sources always exist in the form of vibrations and acoustic, hydraulic, and fluid energies. Therefore, piezoelectric energy harvesters are widely used in various applications such as wireless sensors, actuators, and biomedical applications.26–32 The piezoelectric effect generates electrical energy resulting from a change in dipole moment inside the material when mechanical stress is applied and vice versa, can be mechanically deformed by an applied voltage. Therefore, piezoelectricity is utilized in various useful applications, such as inkjet printing, printer nozzles, injectors, actuators, ultrasonic wave detectors, speakers, ignitors, strain sensors and energy harvesters. Piezoelectric effects are mainly found in materials with non-centrosymmetric crystal structures. In the past decades, various piezoelectric materials, such as barium titanate (BTO), lead zirconate titanate (PZT), zinc oxide (ZnO), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), peptides, amino acids, and proteins, have been developed.33–41 PZT is the most widely used piezoelectric material owing to its superior piezoelectric coefficient. Although PZT is a promising material for energy harvesters, it is brittle, requires a high temperature–pressure process, and contains harmful lead components. Therefore, various piezoelectric materials with strong piezoelectric coefficients, lead-free components, simple fabrication processes, and mechanical softness have been studied.42–49 In particular, halide perovskite materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their outstanding piezoelectric properties comparable to those of conventional piezoelectric ceramic materials, low temperature processability, and biocompatibility.50–55Fig. 1 shows the three-dimensional crystal structure of an ABX3-type halide perovskite. Here, A is an organic cation, such as a methylammonium ion (CH3NH3+) or trimethylchloromethyl ammonium ion (Me3NCH2Cl+), or an inorganic cation, such as Cs+, Pb2+, or Rb+. B is a divalent metal cation, such as Pb2+ or Sn2+, and X is a monovalent halogen anion, such as I−, Cl−, or Br−. Halide perovskites can be synthesized by a low-temperature solution process; they exhibit various structural, optical, and electrical properties, which can be designed by adjusting the composition and synthesis conditions. Therefore, halide perovskites have been widely studied in various applications such as solar cells, light emitting diodes (LEDs), and photodetectors.56–64 Recently, halide perovskites with strong piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, which can be used as piezoelectric energy harvesters, have been reported.53,65–70 In 2019, Liao et al. reported an organic–inorganic halide perovskite, (TMFM)x(TMCM)1–xCdCl3 (TMFM, trimethylfluoromethyl ammonium; TMCM, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium), with a superior piezoelectric coefficient and d33 of 1540 pC N−1, which is comparable to that of lead containing piezoelectric ceramics.50Table 1 lists the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of various halide perovskites. Owing to the discovery of halide perovskites with excellent piezoelectric properties, studies related to the application of halide perovskite materials in piezoelectric devices have recently accelerated. However, studies on the fundamental understanding of piezoelectricity in halide perovskite materials and their piezoelectric device applications are still insufficient. In this review, we summarize recent studies on the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of halide perovskite materials. In addition, we review studies on piezoelectric devices based on halide perovskite materials.

2. Effects of temperature on piezoelectric properties
To ensure stable operation of piezoelectric devices at a wide range of temperatures, piezoelectric materials should have excellent piezoelectric properties and high phase transition temperatures. Most piezoelectric halide perovskite materials have ferroelectric properties that exhibit spontaneous electrical polarizations that are switchable by an external electric field.87–89 When the temperature increases beyond the Curie temperature, the spontaneous polarization disappears and the piezoelectric properties are lost because of phase transition.90–93 Therefore, the operation temperature of the piezoelectric devices is limited to lower than the Curie temperature (Tc). Thus, the phase transition temperature is an important characteristic to be considered for practical piezoelectric device application of a halide perovskite.
You et al. (2018) reported an organic–inorganic halide perovskite, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese (TMCM-MnCl3), with excellent piezoelectric properties (d33 of 185 pC N−1).55 TMCM-MnCl3 undergoes a phase transition at 406 K owing to the order–disorder transition of cations. The crystal structure according to temperature is shown in Fig. 2a and b. TMCM-MnCl3 crystals above the Tc (high-temperature phase (HTP)) have a centrosymmetric structure because of the dynamic disorder of organic cations and belong to the non-polar space group, P63/mmc, which is a non-piezoelectric space group. However, TMCM-MnCl3 loses centrosymmetry below Tc (low-temperature phase (LTP)) owing to the freezing of cations and belongs to the polar space group CC, which is a piezoelectric space group. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed to investigate the phase transition behavior of TMCM-MnCl3, and the ferroelectric–paraelectric phase transition was confirmed at 406 K (Fig. 2c). Step-like large dielectric anomalies were exhibited at 406 K, which implies a phase transition of TMCM-MnCl3 (Fig. 2d). Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is an effective method for evaluating whether a crystal structure is polar non-centrosymmetric or non-polar centrosymmetric. The temperature dependent SHG response shows a strong signal below 406 K which rapidly decreases near the phase transition temperature (Fig. 2e). The SHG results indicate that the phase transition occurs from the non-centrosymmetric structure to the centrosymmetric structure at 406 K. Several temperature-dependent measurement results imply that TMCM-MnCl3 undergoes a ferroelectric–paraelectric phase transition at 406 K. Fig. 2f shows the temperature-dependent piezoelectric response of the TMCM-MnCl3 single crystal. In the [102] direction of the LTP crystal, the piezoelectric constant d33 of 185 pC N−1 was observed, and the d33 value rapidly decreased near the phase transition temperature because of the change of the crystal structure from non-centrosymmetric to centrosymmetric. Recently, halide perovskite materials with excellent temperature stabilities have been reported. In 2017, Zhang et al. reported an organic–inorganic halide perovskite, [MeHdabco]RbI3 (MeHdabco = N-methyl-1,4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), with a Curie temperature of 430 K.86 [MeHdabco]RbI3 undergoes a P3212–R3 phase transition at 430 K. In 2020, Chen et al. reported an organic–inorganic halide perovskite, (4-aminotetrahydropyran)2PbBr4 [(ATHP)2PbBr4], with an mm2–P21/n phase transition at a Curie temperature of 503 K.51

In contrast, some non-ferroelectric halide perovskites maintain piezoelectric properties even above the phase transition temperature. It has been reported that a number of non-ferroelectric piezoelectric inorganic materials maintain piezoelectric properties above the phase transition temperature due to large polarization switching barriers, and discrepancy of bond lengths and angles.94–96 Like inorganic materials, similar behavior is shown in piezoelectric halide perovskites. Recently, some researchers have reported organic–inorganic halide perovskites that retain the piezoelectric properties even above the phase transition temperature.97,98 Zhang et al. reported that the piezoelectric properties of [(CH3)3S]3[Bi2Br9] are retained even over the phase transition temperature.97 This is because [(CH3)3S]3[Bi2Br9] is a non-ferroelectric material, and both LTP and HTP have a chiral space group, P213, which is a piezoelectric non-centrosymmetric space group (Fig. 3a). The polarization–electric field (P–E) response did not exhibit ferroelectric properties (Fig. 3b). In addition, it was verified through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) that the phase transition of [(CH3)3S]3[Bi2Br9] occurs at 284.5 K. The abrupt change in the dielectric constant occurring near 280 K also proves the existence of a phase transition. The temperature dependence of the SHG intensity shows that it is maintained in the chiral space group P213 even after the phase transition (Fig. 3c). The piezoelectric coefficient d33 of [(CH3)3S]3[Bi2Br9] was collected along the c-axis at 293 K at different frequencies (Fig. 3d). The value of d33 remained steady, which is close to 18 pC N−1.

3. Effects of the poling process on piezoelectric properties
The output performance of the piezoelectric devices increases with significant polarization change at a given stress.79,99–101 In general, polycrystalline ferroelectric materials have several random domains; therefore, macroscopic polarization does not occur.102–105 However, when an appropriate electric field is applied, the domains begin to align in the direction of the electric field, thereby increasing the degree of polarization of the ferroelectric material. When the domains are aligned in a single direction, significantly larger polarization changes occur at a given stress; therefore, it is essential to pole the domains in a single direction to improve the piezoelectric performance.106–108 During the poling process, the poling time, applied electric field, and temperature are critical factors that affect the domain alignment.109–111 Therefore, it is necessary to determine the optimum poling conditions to maximize the piezoelectric characteristics. In this chapter, we discuss the effect of the poling process on the piezoelectric properties of halide perovskites. Röhm et al. investigated the relationship between domain alignment and poling to demonstrate the ferroelectricity of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3).112 The movement, enlargement, reduction, and generation of domain walls under an electric field have been observed. To support this claim, the effect of direct current (DC) poling on domain patterns was studied using piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM). Fig. 4a shows the domain of MAPbI3 before poling. When an electric field of E = +2 V μm−1 was applied, a change in the domain pattern was observed in some areas (Fig. 4b). In position 1, the three domain regions were narrowed, and the movement of the domain wall was observed. In position 2, a large domain region was formed. In position 3, it was observed that the domain walls were oriented 45° to the original domain wall. When an electric field of E = −2 V μm−1 was applied, changes in domain patterns were also observed in some areas (Fig. 4c). The large domain at position 2 increases in size, while the domain at position 3 shrinks. In contrast, the domains in the area outside of the polling channel that was not exposed to the poling field (top parts of Fig. 4a–c) remain unchanged. Interestingly, no domain shifts or pattern changes were observed in some areas where the electric field was applied. These pinning effects are typical for ferroelectric thin-film samples, which are strongly influenced by mechanical stress and defect sites. Electric poling and the concurrent reorganization of domains change the mechanical stress and distribution of screening charges. Some of these domains remain in their new state after removing the external poling field, while others resume their original, energetically more stable, and less strained state before poling.

Piezoelectric properties can also be improved by lattice deformation as well as domain alignment by the poling process. Recently, Kim et al. reported an inorganic halide perovskite, cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3), with a high piezoelectricity of 40.3 pm V−1 through an optimal poling process.99 The improved piezoelectricity in the poling process is related to the structural distortion of the Br6 octahedron. Fig. 5a shows the change in the Pb–Br–Pb coupling angle and the Pb–Br–Pb and Br–Pb–Pb coupling angles on the b axis in the ac plane according to the poling voltage. Fig. 5b shows a schematic diagram of the unit cell distortion that reflects the change in bonding angle on the ac plane (left) and on the b axis (right). The external electric field causes a lattice change along the ac plane and the b axis, which generates a large dipole moment. The external electric field causes a Pb2+ ion displacement at the center of the Br6 octahedron; this increases the magnitude of the induced dipole moment, which increases the lattice constant along the long axis. In addition, the octahedron occupying the space between Cs ions is distorted along the poling direction, which increases the net polarization by the aligned dipoles. The correlation between piezoelectricity and the lattice constant was further confirmed by PFM measurements. Fig. 5c and d show the PFM amplitude images of CsPbBr3, which show a strong piezoelectric response after the poling process. As the poling electric field increased, CsPbBr3 exhibited a higher piezoelectric response owing to an increased domain alignment. Non-poled CsPbBr3 film had a d33 value of only 7.7 pm V−1, while the piezoelectricity of CsPbBr3 film was gradually increased up to 40.3 pm V−1 by the poling process (Fig. 5e). In addition to optimization of poling parameters, leakage current must also be considered to maximize the piezoelectric characteristics for halide perovskite materials with ferroelectricity. Leakage current is a pervasive issue in ferroelectric poling and is a factor that significantly degrades the ferroelectric polarization switching.113–115 In traditional inorganic materials, leakage current is known to be caused by cationic/anionic vacancies, grain boundaries and structural distortions.116,117 Like in inorganic ferroelectric materials, leakage current of ferroelectric halide perovskites is also caused by similar reasons.118–120 In 2019, Li et al. reported that bromine (Br) incorporation can effectively passivate grain boundaries and lower the dark current density (J0) by two–three orders of magnitude, and the reduced J0 indicates the decrease of leakage current and better defect passivation. Fig. 6a shows dark J–V curves of Sn–Pb halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with Br concentrations of 0, 0.06, and 0.16. When Br content increased from 0 to 0.16, J0 decreased from 10−5 to 10−10 mA cm−2, because Br incorporation not only passivates grain boundaries (GBs) that cause high leakage current, but also helps grain growth and improves crystallinity. In addition, when Br and chloride (Cl) are mixed in the iodide-based perovskite, Br and Cl are separated and the band gap in the GB region increases, resulting in a decrease in J0. In 2018, Shao et al. reported that a highly crystalline tin-based halide perovskite, FASnI3, obtained by mixing a very small amount (0.08 M) of layered (2D) Sn perovskite with 0.92 M of 3D tin perovskite exhibits reduced leakage current. Fig. 6b shows the electrical characteristic of FASnI3 films depending on the amount of 2D tin perovskite layer. As the Sn content increased, the leakage current gradually decreased. This is believed to be due to the increased crystallinity of the 2D/3D perovskite film and the small number of grain boundaries, which lowers the possibility of forming tin vacancies and Sn4+.

4. Photo-induced piezoelectric properties of halide perovskites
The permanent dipole associated with the molecular cations in halide perovskites may lead to spontaneous polarization and thus piezoelectricity. The switchable polarization of halide perovskites under illumination has also been reported. Research on photo-induced polarization is one of the research fields that attracts the attention of not only piezoelectric related researchers but also photovoltaic cell researchers. Since the photovoltaic effect in ferroelectrics was discovered in the 1950s, it received great attention due to its high open-circuit voltage far beyond the bandgap.94,121–123 In addition, a piezoelectric (ferroelectric) semiconductor material can be used to improve the efficiency of a photovoltaic cell through the piezophototronics effect, that is the coupling characteristics of piezoelectric, semiconductor, and photonic properties, using the piezoelectric polarization induced by external stress on a semiconductor with piezoelectricity.124–127 Therefore, halide perovskite materials exhibiting photo-induced polarization characteristics can be applied not only as a piezoelectric devices under illumination conditions, but also to improve photovoltaic cells using induced polarization.
Coll et al. reported that the d33 value of the MAPbI3 film under white light increased by a factor of five compared to the value measured in the dark (5–6 pm V−1) (Fig. 7a).128 This may be related to the increase in the dielectric constant due to the dipole moment generated by light. The strong dependence of the piezoelectric properties on light was investigated by calculating the change in dipole moment using modulation electroabsorption (EA) spectroscopy. Wu et al. calculated the change in the electron dipole moment Δμ of MAPbI3, which was significantly higher than that of photosensitive materials such as CdSe.129 The results indicate that the rapid increase in the d33 value under illumination may be due to the dipole moment formed owing to the internal charge transfer occurring during light excitation.

Liu et al. argued that the piezoelectricity of a material depends on the order of molecular orientation, and the high piezoelectric response of MAPbI3 observed under white light can be attributed to the molecular rearrangement from non-polar to polar orientation.130 The strong dependence of the piezoelectric response on the molecular orientation was investigated by quantifying the polarization–stress and polarization–strain relationships in two model structures with polarity and non-polarity (Fig. 7b). Fig. 7c and d show the polarization–stress curves for MAPbI3 in polar M1 and non-polar M2 structures. The piezoelectric coefficient of the polar M1 structure was calculated as d33 = 31.4 pm V−1 and e33 = 0.83 C m−2, which is much higher than that of the non-polar M2 structure. The results demonstrate that the piezoelectric properties have a strong dependence on the order of molecular orientation, which indicates that the improved piezoelectric properties in the presence of light may be attributed to molecular reorientation. Illumination weakens the hydrogen bond between the MA+ cation and the PbI3 sublattice, which facilitates the rotation of the MA+ cation. As a result, MAPbI3 forms a polar structure due to molecular rearrangement under an external electric field. In addition, excessive energy is released as heat when the hot carrier is relaxed by the auger recombination of carriers at the band edge because the band gap of MAPbI3 is within the visible light range. Recent experiments also found that molecules play an important role in carrier relaxation, with MA translation, CH/NH twisting, and CH/NH stretching modes assisting the process.131 A simple analytical model was developed to examine the magnitude of light-induced thermalization in a MAPbI3 thin film.132 Assuming that all energy released by the hot carrier relaxation is converted to the kinetic energy (κ) of the molecule, the average thermal energy received by each molecule at depth D per second can be estimated as  where I0(E) is the sunlight intensity spectrum, Δd is the thickness of a single molecule layer, A is the area per molecule, and Eg is the band gap energy. The energy obtained by a single molecule per second has a strong dependence on depth as the intensity of light decreases exponentially with increasing depth. In particular, molecules near the surface of the sample can obtain a sufficiently large energy to allow dipole reorientation, which leads to the formation of a polar structure with strong piezoelectric properties.
5. Piezoelectric properties at the morphotropic phase boundary region
The morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) is generally found in composite perovskite-type materials.133–135 The composite perovskite material contains two different cations at site B in the ABX3 perovskite structure. For example, lead zirconate titanium (PZT) is typically combined in the form of PbZr(1−x)Ti(x)O3, where x is the concentration of Ti. PZT shows a different crystal structure depending on the composition of Zr and Ti. At low concentrations of Ti, PZT shows a rhombohedral structure; at high concentrations of Ti, it shows a tetragonal structure. In addition, when x ≈ 0.48, rhombohedral and tetragonal phases coexist. The MPB in this case is the phase boundary between the rhombohedral and tetragonal phases.136–138 Materials with MPB are known to have stronger piezoelectric properties compared to single-phase systems.139–141 The characteristics of MPB were also recently identified in organic–metal halide perovskites. In (TMFM)x(TMCM)1–xCdCl3, TMFM is [Me3NCH2F]+ (trimethylfluoromethyl ammonium), and TMCM is trimethylchloromethyl ammonium. (TMFM)x(TMCM)1–xCdCl3 coexists with a monoclinic phase (point group m) and hexagonal phase (point group 6mm) in the range of 0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.3 (Fig. 8a). In this area, the d33 value reached 1540 pC N−1, which is higher than that of the BTO or PZT traditional piezoelectric materials. In addition, the local piezoresponses were measured through PFM to confirm the strong piezoelectricity in the MPB area at x = 0.26 (Fig. 8b). Subsequently, the piezoelectric response was greatly reduced as the point group changed from the section where the composition of x was greater than 0.5. Fig. 8c shows the permittivity of (TMFM)x(TMCM)1–xCdCl3 depending on x as a function of temperature at a frequency of 1 MHz. In particular, the MPB area at x = 0.26 shows the maximum permittivity value. Fig. 8d shows the hysteresis loop of (TMFM)x(TMCM)1–xCdCl3 with electric fields of E = ±25–±28 kV cm−1. When x ≤ 0.4, a satisfactory hysteresis loop is obtained for every composition. The saturated polarization (Ps) and remnant polarization (Pr) increased slightly with the increase in x and exhibited the highest values near the MPB zone at x = 0.26. The values decreased when x = 0.4, and ferroelectric properties were not observed at x = 1.50 Piezoelectric materials are exploited in a number of useful applications such as inkjet printers, ultrasonic nozzles, motors, pressure/strain sensors, and nanogenerators (NGs). In particular, piezoelectric NGs (PENGs) are suitable for small-sized and portable low-power electronic devices that require battery-free operation.142–146 PENGs have a wide range of applications as they can produce electricity using various mechanical pressures and vibrations that occur in everyday life.147–150 Cubic-structured organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials exhibit strong piezoelectricity, which can enable their use as PENGs. In this chapter, various PENGs based on halide perovskites are discussed.79,99,151,152

6. Halide perovskite based piezoelectric nanogenerators
In 2016, Kim et al. reported the fabrication of MAPbI3 thin-film-based PENGs for the first time with a conventional PENG structure.79 The PENGs were fabricated by spin-coating MAPbI3 (500 nm) on a Au/Ti/PET substrate, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 1 h. PET/ITO and MAPbI3/Ai/Ti/PET were combined using PDMS (25 μm) as an adhesive layer to sandwich an active piezoelectric layer between the two electrodes. Fig. 9a and b show the piezoelectric power generation mechanisms of non-poled and poled MAPbI3 thin-film-based PENGs. The non-poled device produces a low piezoelectric potential when pressure is applied because the initial polarization direction is randomly distributed (Fig. 9a). However, the poled device after application of a high electric field to align the polarizing directions produces a high piezoelectric potential (Fig. 9b). Fig. 9c and d represent the output voltage and current of the non-poled and poled MAPbI3 thin film PENGs, respectively. The output voltage and current values were measured by applying 0.5 MPa of periodic pressure per 1 cm2 area. The generated output voltage and current of the non-poled PENG were 1.0 V and 50 nA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 9c). In contrast, the measured output voltage and current of the poled device (poling E: 80 kV cm−1) were 2.7 V and 240 nA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 9d). The significantly different output voltages and currents of the two devices show that the domain polarization alignment of the MAPbI3 thin film plays a very critical role.

In 2020, Tusiime et al. reported a thin-film-based PENG in which MAPbI3 was infiltrated into a net-like composite scaffold (PPS-Co) composed of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polylactic acid (PLA), and tin dioxide (SnO2) electrospun nanofibers (NFs).151 MAPbI3 perovskite was deposited and infiltrated into mesoporous electrospun fibers to enlarge the contact area between MAPbI3 and the PSS-Co layers. Subsequently, ultrasonic vibration treatment was applied to the wet-spun films to achieve the following: form a polymeric composite with a predominant piezoelectric β phase, uniformly combine the composite elements, and efficiently infiltrate the perovskite film into the mesoporous polymeric composite. The solution mixing of the PVDF and MAPbI3 perovskite enhances the formation of the piezoelectric β phase of PVDF. However, it could potentially enhance oxidation and distort the continuous MAPbI3 film structure. Therefore, in this work, a PPS-Co layer was developed to enhance the β-phase content, and a pure hybrid MAPbI3 film was deposited to achieve an improved and stable piezoelectric response. Fig. 9e shows the schematics of the PPS-Co/MAPbI3 and SnO2 NF/MAPbI3 devices. Fig. 9f shows the output voltage and output current of PPS-Co/MAPbI3 and SnO2 NF/MAPbI3 devices by repetitive bending and release motions at a frequency of 2 Hz. The output voltages and currents of PPS-Co/MAPbI3 and SnO2 NF/MAPbI3 devices reached 4.82 V and 1.04 V, and 30 nA and 15 nA, respectively.
In 2020, Kim et al. reported inorganic halide perovskite CsPbBr3 thin-film-based PENGs.99 The CsPbBr3 thin film was manufactured by spin-coating a CsPbBr3 solution on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated soda limit silicate (SLS) glass substrate and then annealed at 70 °C for 5 min. After the poling process on the fabricated film, the piezoelectric properties were considerably enhanced. Fig. 10a shows the butterfly loops of the CsPbBr3 thin film after the poling process with various applied poling electric fields. The butterfly loops of the curves are seen with larger values for the higher poling electric field. In addition, PENGs of the 0.4 M CsPbBr3 thin films passivated with PDMS layers were fabricated. Fig. 10b and c show the output voltage and current for the PENG made using unpoled and 24.9 kV cm−1-poled thin films by cyclic bending at 1 Hz. The measured output voltage and current when using an unpoled thin film were 11.7 V and 147 nA maximum, respectively. Conversely, the measured output voltage and current using a poled thin film were improved to 16.4 V and 604 nA, corresponding to an improvement of 40% and 310%, respectively. High-performance PENGs were further investigated to detect electrical signals from body motions. The CsPbBr3 film-based PENGs were attached to various positions in the human body, and electrical signals were measured depending on the individual motion. Fig. 10d shows the generated output current of the CsPbBr3 film PENG attached to the throat with coughing and yawning motions. Different magnitudes of output current were obtained for the motions of coughing (∼4.8 nA) and yawning (∼1.9 nA) by the CsPbBr3-based PENGs.

7. Halide perovskite–polymer composite-based piezoelectric nanogenerators
The achieved piezoelectric output performance of thin film perovskite-based PENGs is still low, so it is unrealistic to apply it in practical applications. Recently, hybrid composite PENGs based on various piezoelectric nanoparticles and polymer matrices significantly increased the performance and mechanical properties of the PENG.100,153–156 In 2016, Ding et al. reported formamidinium lead halide perovskite (FAPbBr3) nanoparticle-based nanocomposite PENGs.153 The nanocomposite PENG was fabricated by spin-coating the FAPbBr3–PDMS solution on the ITO/PET substrate and integrated with aluminum foil, as shown in Fig. 11a. The output voltage and current of the FAPbBr3–PDMS nanocomposite PENGs were measured under external vertical compression and release from a mechanical force stimulator at a frequency of 6 Hz. The measured maximum output voltage and current were about 8.5 V and 3.8 μA cm−2, respectively, under the periodically applied stress of 0.5 MPa as shown in Fig. 11b and c. To determine the effect of the FAPbBr3 nanoparticle concentration on the PENG performance, the PENGs were fabricated with different ratios of FAPbBr3 nanoparticles and PDMS. When the concentrations of FAPbBr3 nanoparticles were 5, 20, 35, and 50 wt%, the measured output voltages were 1, 2, 7, and 2 V, respectively, as shown in Fig. 11d. The maximum output voltage was shown with 35 wt% FAPbBr3 nanoparticles and then decreased with a further increase in the concentration. However, there is a difference in the piezoelectric potential between the experimental results and the COMSOL simulation results. The piezoelectric potentials calculated from the COMSOL simulation increased linearly with increasing FAPbBr3 concentration. The decrease in the output voltage from the experimental results with an increase in the concentration of the FAPbBr3 nanoparticles over 35 wt% can be mainly attributed to the high dielectric constant of the PENGs because the output voltage is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant.157–160

Recently, there have been serious environment and public health concerns regarding the presence of lead in organic–inorganic halide perovskite PENGs.161–163 In 2019, Ippili et al. reported a flexible piezoelectric device with lead-free methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI3) perovskite particles.100 In addition, the output power of the PENGs was improved by fabricating dense composites using the MASnI3 and porous PVDF polymer films. Fig. 11e shows the PENG device structure without (up) and with PVDF (down). A mechanical pressure of 0.5 MPa was applied to this device, and the output voltage and current density were measured after the poling process (Fig. 11f and g). The output voltage and current density of the MASnI3 based PENGs were ∼3.8 V and 0.35 μA cm−2, respectively; the output voltage and current density of the MASnI3-porous PVDF composite film-based PENGs were ∼12 V and ∼4.0 μA cm−2, respectively, which are 3 times higher than the output voltage and 10 times higher than the output current density due to the piezoelectric potential in the PVDF layer. The piezoelectric potentials are generated in PVDF by deformation, and they produce the formation of macro dipoles in the filled MASnI3, which results in the accumulation of charges with opposite polarity on their edges compared to the polarity of the PVDF layer. The deformation of the macro-dipole moments further induces a strong electrical response between the two electrodes. In addition, the external load resistor-dependent output performance was measured. By increasing the external load resistance, the output voltage gradually increased, while the output current density decreased, and a maximum power density of 21.6 μW cm−2 at a load resistance of 4 MΩ was obtained.
8. Conclusions
In this review, we discuss recent advances in halide perovskite piezoelectric materials in a systematic investigation of the crystal structure, and dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties depending on the temperature, illumination, poling, and material composition. We believe that this review will provide useful insights into the design of piezoelectric materials and applications of halide perovskite piezoelectric materials. Although previous inorganic piezoelectric perovskite materials such as PZT, ZnO, and BTO are widely used for piezoelectric applications because of their strong piezoelectric response, their fabrication often requires environmentally harmful components and/or energy-intensive conditions such as high temperature, high electric fields, and extreme pressure. In addition, these materials have challenges for use in flexible/stretchable electronics owing to their low degree of softness. Halide perovskites are promising candidates for the replacement of inorganic piezoelectric materials with advantages such as low temperature processability, nontoxic components, and flexibility as well as strong piezoelectric response. However, to develop a high-performance PENG based on halide perovskite piezoelectric materials, it is still necessary to understand the following essential material characteristics to design the devices:
1. Temperature-dependent crystal structure and piezoelectric/ferroelectric properties.
2. Effect of the electrical poling process and ferroelectric leakage current.
3. Photoinduced phase transition, polarization and a piezoelectric response.
4. Relationship between the morphotropic phase boundary and the piezoelectric response.
In particular, the polarization phenomenon induced by light can be applied not only to develop piezoelectric devices, but also to improve the efficiency of the ferroelectric photovoltaic cell and piezophototronic effect-based photovoltaic cell. Furthermore, multifunctional halide perovskites with piezoelectric and photovoltaic effects can be used to develop piezoelectric/photovoltaic hybrid energy harvesters. In addition, further studies on the piezoelectric properties of halide perovskite depending on humidity are required. Typically, an organic–inorganic halide perovskite combines with water to form a hydrate. In the perovskite hydrate, water molecules form strong hydrogen bonds with organic cations, weakening the perovskite crystal structure.164 Many studies have reported that the efficiency of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells decreases when exposed to moisture for a long time.165 Although the piezoelectric properties of an organic–inorganic halide perovskite according to humidity have not been studied in earnest, the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of halide perovskites are also expected to be affected by moisture. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the structure and piezoelectricity of halide perovskites depending on humidity to implement a high-performance and reliable piezoelectric device. Furthermore, we also need to design and develop PENG device structures, such as thin films, microstructures, nanostructures, and nanocomposites, to effectively convert mechanical energy into electricity. In the last decade, as many researchers have become interested in halide perovskite materials owing to their unique properties, research on optical applications such as photovoltaic cells and photodetectors has been actively conducted, and substantial advancements have been achieved. Recently, various studies on halide perovskite-based piezoelectric/ferroelectric properties and their energy generation applications have been performed, and significant advancements are expected in the near future. We believe that this review will be helpful to develop halide perovskite-based piezo/photoelectric energy harvesters.
