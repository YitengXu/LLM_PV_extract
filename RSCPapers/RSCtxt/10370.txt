    , Accepted 4th December 2020First published on 8th December 2020AbstractThe modern ammonia synthesis industry founded by Haber–Bosch in 1913 has successfully altered the history of food production, fed explosive population growth, and laid the foundation of heterogeneous catalysis and chemical engineering as well. However, its reliance on fossil fuels for reactant H2 production consumes 1–3% of the world's electric energy and 2–5% of the world's natural gas, accompanied by more than 400 million tons of CO2 emission annually. Making use of water as the proton source and electric energy to drive the ammonia synthesis reaction will reduce the fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emission and is thus regarded as a green and sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber–Bosch process. To date, some excellent reviews on electrochemical ammonia synthesis have been published, but most of them were organized according to the type of catalyst. A systematic summary of the performance-improving strategies of the electrocatalyst for ammonia synthesis is rarely reported and therefore highly desirable. In this review, the nitrogen reduction reaction mechanisms and recent theoretical advances are briefly outlined first. Then, strategies for both reactivity and selectivity enhancement of catalysts and catalytic systems are methodically discussed. Last, criteria for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction, ammonia quantification methods, and an outlook for further research are also concluded. This review aims to provide systematic and concise guidance for the design of highly efficient and selective electrochemical ammonia synthesis systems.
1. Introduction
The ammonia (NH3) synthesis industry is crucial for the development of human society and the global economy since NH3 is the second largest chemical produced in the world, about 80% of which is used for fertilizer synthesis and feeds the explosive growth of the global population.1,2 In fact, nearly half of the nitrogen in our bodies may come from a synthetic ammonia plant.3 Besides, due to the high hydrogen mass fraction (17.6 wt%), zero carbon content, and much higher liquefaction temperature (−33 °C) than that (−253 °C) of hydrogen (H2), NH3 has also been regarded as one of the most promising green energy carriers and liquid transportation fuels in the future.4,5
Currently, NH3 production at the world scale is about 170 million tons per year and highly relies on the conventional Haber–Bosch (H–B) process from nitrogen (N2) and H2 (N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3, ΔH298K = −92.2 kJ mol−1).6 Though the standard equilibrium constant of the above reaction at 25 °C is as high as 6.8 × 105, the reaction rate is almost imperceptible. In order to increase the reaction rate and keep the catalyst at the best activity temperature, industrial ammonia synthesis is usually carried out at 400–600 °C. Due to the thermodynamic limitations, the standard equilibrium constant falls down to 10−5 at the same time, and high pressure (20–40 MPa) is then employed to move the reaction balance to the right and increase the conversion rate. Even so, the single-pass conversion rate of synthetic NH3 can only reach 10–15%.7 What is more, the feedstock H2 of the H–B process comes from the reforming or gasification of natural gas, coal, or fuel oil using pressurized, super-heated steam. It consumes about 75% of the energy input and produces half of the amount of CO2 of the overall process (Fig. 1a).8 To be specific, the share of natural gas, coal, and fuel oil feedstock is 72%, 22%, and 4%, respectively, for annual NH3 synthesis, which is also responsible for 1–3% of the global electric energy and 2–5% of the global natural gas consumption with 3% of the global total CO2 emission annually.2,9

Therefore, making use of water (H2O) (or even humidified air) instead of H2 as the proton source to synthesize NH3 under room temperature and atmospheric pressure is a challenging but theoretically possible approach to reduce fossil energy consumption and CO2 emission. The activation of N2 molecules and the change of the reaction pathway by introducing other forms of energy such as electric or solar energy, etc., into the nitrogen fixation process are the most critical challenges.8,10–12 Electrochemical technology is capable of facilitating the thermodynamically non-spontaneous N2 reduction reaction (NRR) (2N2 + 6H2O → 4NH3 + 3O2) with little or no limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium on the conversion rate, activating absorbed N2 molecules by supplying them with electrons and providing the electrons needed for the subsequent reduction reaction. Besides, the electrochemical NRR is probably more efficient than the photochemical counterpart since the photons used for the photocatalytic reaction are limited as a result of fast electron–hole pair recombination.13 Based on the above, electrocatalytic NH3 production from N2 and H2O under mild conditions would be a green and sustainable alternative to the centuried H–B process (Fig. 1b).
Theoretically, electrocatalytic N2 reduction to NH3 is realizable under ambient conditions as long as a suitable electric potential is applied.14 Practically, however, the activity and selectivity of the electrochemical NRR are still far from enough for actual industrial NH3 production. The challenges lie in the following two aspects. Firstly, as an inert molecule (see Section 2.1), N2 is hard to be either reduced directly or activated, thus leading to low activity of the electrochemical NRR. Secondly, the NRR process involves 6H+/6e− transfer (N2 + 2H2O + 6H+ + 6e− ⇌ 2NH3·H2O, E° = 0.092 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)), while the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a 2H+/2e− process (2H+ + 2e− ⇌ H2, E° = 0.00 V vs. NHE), and, as a result, most protons and electrons in the system prefer to go toward the HER even though the redox potentials of NRR and HER are similar.15 Therefore, electrochemical N2 reduction to NH3 is faced with severe selectivity issue. Highly active and selective electrocatalysts as well as electrocatalytic systems remain to be developed urgently.16,17
In this review, we firstly summarize the fundamental principles in terms of NRR mechanisms and recent theoretical studies. Then, a variety of strategies to improve the activity and selectivity for electrocatalysts and electrocatalytic systems are highlighted. Finally, we discuss the criteria for the NRR and the methods for accurate NH3 quantification. This review aims to illustrate the recent advances, summarize effective strategies and provide directions for future efforts in the field of electrochemical NRR.
2. Mechanisms and recent theoretical advances of the NRR
2.1 Thermodynamic properties of N2
As an inert molecule, N2 is hard to be activated due to the following aspects: (1) N2 exhibits a quite high NN triple bond energy of 941 kJ mol−1. More crucially, its first bond cleavage energy is up to 410 kJ mol−1, which should be responsible for the inertness of N2 considering the fact that acetylene (C2H2) has a similar triple bond energy of 962 kJ mol−1 but a lower first bond cleavage energy of 222 kJ mol−1 and much higher reactivity.13 (2) According to the frontier orbital theory, the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO of N2 molecule is calculated to be 10.82 eV (Table 1),18 which means that electron injection into N2 anti-bonding orbitals would be severely inhibited. (3) The proton affinity of N2 is only 493.8 kJ mol−1, the lowest among those of the molecules listed in Table 1. So the hydrogenation of N2 is very difficult even if a strong acid is employed. (4) The non-polar nature of N2 and its high ionization potential of 15.84 eV also answer for its inertness.19

2.2 Mechanisms of the NRR
Currently, the widely accepted mechanistic models for the NRR include the dissociative, associative, enzymatic, and Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) pathways (Fig. 2).20 For the dissociative pathway, the NN bond is firstly split into two N-adatoms and subsequently protonated to generate NH3, which is well documented by the industrial H–B process. As for most electrochemical NRR systems, the cleavage of the NN triple bond and the hydrogenation process take turns to occur, known as the associative pathway. Specifically, this pathway can be further subdivided into the distal and alternating pathways. For the former pathway, the remote nitrogen atom is fully hydrogenated firstly to generate an NH3 molecule, while, for the latter pathway, the hydrogenation of the two nitrogen atoms proceeds alternately. At the same time, the enzymatic pathway is quite similar to the alternating one except for a different “side-on” adsorption mode of N2 on the catalyst surface rather than the “end-on” mode. Lastly, the MvK mechanism proposed by Skúlason et al. is highly preferred by transition metal nitrides, in which the outmost nitrogen atom is reduced to NH3 and the structure is subsequently recovered by reacting with gaseous N2.21

2.3 Recent theoretical advances of the NRR
With the fast development of theoretical and computational methods, revealing the NRR mechanisms to illustrate experimental observations and propose novel catalysts has been achieved from first-principles calculations. Materials including pure transition metals, metal alloys, metal oxides/nitrides/carbides and single atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely explored as catalysts for the electrochemical NRR. In 2012, a landmark study reported by Nørskov et al. screened a series of transition metals for the NRR and showed that molybdenum, iron, rhodium, and ruthenium were at the top of the volcano diagram (Fig. 3).22 However, these metals exhibited higher reactivity toward the HER as well. Besides, scandium, yttrium, titanium, and zirconium were demonstrated to have stronger adsorption ability with nitrogen atoms than that with hydrogen atoms, but they were prone to form corresponding oxides of which the NRR performances still remained unknown. Later, Skúlason et al. investigated the possibility of metal oxides23 and metal nitrides24,25 for the NRR. They found that NbO2, ReO2, and TaO2 were the candidates with the most potential and the rocksalt (100) facet of VN possessed higher selectivity for the NRR and better stability. In addition, they also revealed that the rocksalt (111) facet of NbN and the zinc blende (110) facet of WN, CrN, and RuN could be regenerated and endured the NRR cycle. In 2016, Sun et al. carried out calculations and suggested that two-dimensional transition metal carbides are active for the NRR.26 The bond of chemisorbed N2 on the surface of materials could be elongated and weakened, which potentially promoted the conversion of N2 to NH3. Recently, SACs have also been proposed as a kind of promising candidate for the NRR. In 2017, Zhao et al. reported that a molybdenum SAC supported on a defective BN monolayer was an effective catalyst for the NRR and adopted an enzymatic mechanism.27 Then, in 2019, Sun et al. systematically studied a number of boron based SACs and demonstrated that the charge transfer between the catalysts and substrates obviously affected the NRR performance.28 Among all the studied catalysts, the best performing two were boron SACs anchored into graphene and MoS2, respectively.

3. Strategies for active and selective electrochemical NRR systems
Although a large number of nanomaterials have been successfully developed for electrochemical NH3 synthesis systems, the efficiency of the NRR is still not enough for actual industrial application. Up to now, various strategies to tackle the activity and selectivity issues have been proposed, which can be roughly classified into the following two categories: (1) elaborate design of electrocatalysts to improve their inherent catalytic behavior for the NRR and (2) comprehensive development of electrocatalytic systems to boost the overall NRR performance.
3.1 NRR catalyst design

3.1.1 Structural optimization. 
The catalytic performance of nanomaterials is highly dependent on their structural properties including the size, morphology, crystal phase/facet, and the degree of amorphization. Strategies of structural control have been demonstrated to be effective to improve the reactivity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts toward the electrochemical NRR.
3.1.1.1 Single atom construction. 
Benefiting from the highly disperse active sites, SACs possess maximum atom utilization efficiency and high reactivity for kinds of electrochemical reactions. Compared with their bulk counterparts, SACs exhibit distinguished performance toward the NRR. For example, in 2018 Wu et al. reported an atomically dispersed Au1/C3N4 catalyst, which catalyzed NH3 generation at a yield rate of 72.5 μmol h−1 mgcat−1, up to 22.5 times that of the corresponding gold nanomaterials (Fig. 4a).29 The improved NRR activity of Au1/C3N4 was attributed to the full atomic utilization. To date, ruthenium,30–32 silver,33 copper,34 molybdenum,35 iron,36–39 and cobalt40 based SACs have also been designed and employed for the electrochemical NRR supported by materials such as C3N4, (porous) N-doped carbon, MoS2, graphdiyne,41 MXenes,32 SnO239etc. Compared with their bulk counterparts, all of these catalysts displayed superior faradaic efficiency and NH3 yield rates on account of the superior electronic properties of SACs as well as the highly disperse single atom sites, good conductivity and fast mass transfer from the support materials.

3.1.1.2 Morphological control. 
The morphology of a heterogeneous catalyst has a great influence on its catalytic performance. By rational morphological regulation, highly active and selective electrocatalysts toward the NRR will be thus constructed. For instance, Zhang et al. observed that the NH3 yield rate of nanoporous gold is as high as 5.8 times that of gold octahedra.42 The nanoporous structure of gold gave it a higher proportion of low-coordinated surface atoms which determined the NRR activity. Similarly, porous Fe2O3 nanorods on carbon cloth,43 porous Pd3Pb nanowires,44 and nitrogen-doped porous carbon45 were also illustrated to be effective catalysts toward N2 to NH3 conversion owing to their enlarged surface area and increased active sites. In addition, constructing hollow,46–48 dendritic,49 or fibrous50 structures to enlarge the catalytic surface area has been confirmed as another feasible strategy to enhance the activity of an NRR catalyst. Considering the fact that more atoms were exposed at corners and the sharp edges, a mosaic bismuth nanosheet reported by Qiao et al.51 and a triangular silver nanoplate reported by Yin et al.52 (Fig. 4b–d) both showed better behaviors for the electrochemical NRR, benefitting from the reasonable shape regulation. In 2018, Rondinone et al. synthesized an N-doped carbon nanospike and employed it as an NRR electrocatalyst.53 Since electrons tended to concentrate at the tip of the sharp spike, an electric field was thus constructed and facilitated the electroreduction of N2 to NH3. Last but not least, exfoliating bulk materials into the ultra-thin counterparts and constructing ultra-small quantum dots (QDs) were also effective strategies to improve the catalyst performance. Sun et al. exemplified the strategy by preparing a two-dimensional boron nanosheet, of which the NH3 yield rate and faradaic efficiency were twice those of the bulk boron.54 Recently, Xu et al. illustrated that the electrocatalytic performance of MXene QD-type NRR catalysts could be adjusted through size optimization.55
3.1.1.3 Crystal engineering. 
Crystal phase and facet engineering is a common tactic to modulate the properties of heterogeneous materials in electrocatalysis. For example, Huang et al. prepared body-centered and face-centered cubic PdCu catalysts, respectively (Fig. 5a and b).56 Electrochemical NH3 synthesis studies revealed that the body-centered one exhibited better catalytic activity than the face-centered one (Fig. 5c). Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the enhanced activity of body-centered cubic PdCu for the NRR came from the strong orbital interaction of palladium and surrounding copper atoms. Moreover, high-index facets and stepped facets are usually regarded as high-energy surfaces with relatively low energy barriers for catalytic reactions. In 2019, Wei et al. successfully fabricated gold nanoparticles with high-index facets.57 The nanoparticles afforded a remarkable faradaic efficiency of 73.32% since the high-index facets preferred to adsorb the *N2H intermediates for the NRR rather than the *H intermediates for the HER, which was clarified by computational simulations. In addition to the above, tetrahexahedral gold nanorods with stepped {730} facets reported by Yan et al.,58 a Pt93Ir7 nanoalloy with high-index {710} facets reported by Sun et al.,59 and surface-rough Rh2Sb nanorods with high-index facets reported by Huang et al.60 all demonstrated that the high-index facets of nanomaterials were able to adsorb and activate N2 efficiently, thus being potential catalytic centers for the NRR.

3.1.1.4 Amorphization. 
Amorphous materials have a non-periodic structure of the internal arrangement of atoms or molecules. Their abundant defects in both the surface and bulk as well as the unique electronic properties make them promising candidates for the electrochemical NRR.61 In 2017, Yan et al. found that CeOx-induced amorphous gold nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphite oxide were high-performance electrocatalysts toward the NRR (Fig. 5d).62 Owing to the dangling bonds existing in the metastable amorphous catalysts, the faradaic efficiency and NH3 yield rate of amorphous gold were much higher than those of the crystalline counterpart. Another amorphous Bi4V2O11/CeO2 hybrid reported by Yu et al. revealed that the defects induced by amorphization played a role as active sites in electrochemical NRR systems.63 Similarly, Chu et al. observed that partially-amorphous CeO2 nanosheets contained abundant oxygen vacancies, which resulted in more exposed active sites and faster electron transfer.64 Other than the above, the strong affinity toward N265 and remarkable localized electronic structure66 of amorphous materials were also illustrated in detail for NRR promotion.


3.1.2 Heteroatom doping. 
The introduction of heteroatoms can effectively reduce the reaction energy barrier and increase the number of active sites. Therefore, as a useful strategy, heteroatom doping has been widely employed to optimize electrocatalysts for the NRR. According to the species of dopants, it can be generally divided into metal doping and nonmetal doping.
3.1.2.1 Metal doping. 
Metal atom doping can reduce the energy barrier of the reaction67,68 and induce the formation of oxygen vacancies,69–73 thereby improving the behavior of NRR catalysts. One example demonstrated by Lou et al. was that the faradaic efficiency of an NH3 synthesis system catalyzed by MoS2 increased from 1.7% to over 10% after doping with cobalt atoms.67 Systematic DFT calculations showed that the free energy barriers for MoS2 and Co-doped MoS2 were 1.62 eV and 0.59 eV, respectively, and revealed that cobalt dopants accounted for the enhanced faradaic efficiency (Fig. 6a and b). In 2019, Zheng et al. reported an electrochemical NRR catalyst of TiO2 doping with same-valence but larger-size Zr4+ ions.69 The number of catalytic sites was increased by the strain effect, which led to the generation of oxygen vacancies and a higher faradaic efficiency of 17.3% since oxygen vacancies were considered as effective N2 adsorption and activation sites as well as electron-donating sites. Other metal dopants such as chromium,71 iron,70,72 gold,73 and molybdenum74 were also explored to boost the NRR performance through creating oxygen vacancies or sulfur vacancies like above.

3.1.2.2 Nonmetal doping. 
The doping strategy has been investigated more based on nonmetal atoms such as boron, nitrogen group elements, carbon, chalcogen elements, halogen elements, hydrogen, etc. Among them, boron is the most commonly used dopant due to its Lewis acidity.75–77 In 2018, Zheng et al. observed that the electron density of graphene could be redistributed after doping with boron, and thus N2 adsorption was facilitated and the synthetic NH3 performance was improved (Fig. 6c).75 Another study by Xia et al. showed that boron dopants could promote the charge transfer process as well.77
In addition, due to the higher electronegativity than carbon and the electron-donating property, nitrogen group elements such as nitrogen78–81 and phosphorus82–87 were also adopted as important non-metal dopants. For example, N-doped porous carbon reported by Xie et al. was shown to be a cost-effective material for the electrochemical NRR. The nitrogen atoms in pyrrole and pyridine structures were the active sites for N2 adsorption and the catalytic reaction, which was confirmed by DFT calculations.78 Besides, nitrogen dopants would also significantly promote the conductivity of materials, resulting in better stability of the *N2H intermediate and a lower energy barrier for the NRR.80 Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus was another commonly used dopant. For instance, P-doped graphene was recently synthesized by Sun et al.87 and exhibited superior NRR performance. Theoretical studies uncovered that the NN triple bond was effectively weakened as a result of electron injection from the doped phosphorus atoms.
As for carbon doping, an example reported by Oschatz et al. in 2019 showed that C-doped TiO2 displayed improved activity toward the NRR, which could be attributed to the fact that the Ti–C bond was energetically favourable for N2 activation.88 A recent study reported by Liu et al. demonstrated that the carbon dopants in boron nitride nanosheets would facilitate the formation of a defective structure and faster electron transfer, which were responsible for the high efficiency and selectivity of the NRR.89 Chalcogen elements such as oxygen90–93 and sulfur94 doped heterogeneous catalysts have also been developed for the electrochemical NRR. For carbon materials doped with oxygen or sulfur, C–O, CO, and C–S bonds were formed and the carbon atoms near the dopants were the underlying active sites for electrocatalytic NH3 production. As more electronegative elements than chalcogen ones, fluorine and chlorine are able to tune the electron distribution of nanomaterials as well.95–98 In 2019, Zheng et al. fabricated a selective catalyst of fluorine-doped carbon for the electrochemical NRR.95 Because the carbon atoms in this material were partially positively charged, N2 molecules rather than H+ ions were preferably adsorbed in acidic solution by the electrocatalyst. Another fluorine-doped material F-MoS2 reported by Cai et al. exhibited higher selectivity towards the NRR because of the smaller size and larger electronegativity of fluorine as compared to sulfur.98 Unusual dopants such as hydrogen have also been explored recently. For example, Cheng et al. reported a novel hydrogen-doped palladium hydride which effectively promoted N2 activation and conversion to the adsorbed *N2H species.99 The hydrogen in the generated NH3 was further confirmed to come from lattice hydrogen of the palladium hydride by isotopic studies.
Except the above-mentioned situations with single element doping, co-doping with two elements has also been explored to take full advantage of the synergistic effect.100–102 For instance, a B,N-doped porous carbon nanofiber was constructed and employed for NH3 generation by Hou et al. in 2019.100 Further mechanistic studies illustrated that the superior NRR performance was ascribed to the improved electron conductivity induced by nitrogen atoms together with the enhanced N2 adsorption induced by boron atoms.


3.1.3 Vacancy engineering. 
Constructing vacancies will significantly improve the catalytic performance of heterogeneous materials since vacant sites are able to regulate the electronic structure of catalysts and optimize the reaction pathway. According to the different electrical properties of vacancies, here we divide them into the following two categories, namely anion and cation vacancies.
3.1.3.1 Anion vacancies. 
Anion vacancies mainly include oxygen vacancies,73,103–108 sulfur vacancies,67 nitrogen vacancies,109 phosphorus vacancies,93 and tellurium vacancies.110 Based on previous research results, the reason for facilitating the NRR by introducing anion vacancies has been well demonstrated. In view of the fact that oxygen vacancies are beneficial for the adsorption and activation of N2, the strategy of building oxygen vacancies has been widely adopted in the design of NRR catalysts, especially for metal oxides. For instance, Zeng et al. reported an electrocatalytic N2 reduction system based on LaCoO3.105 They found that the NH3 yield rate for LaCoO3 with rich oxygen vacancies was as high as 10.72 μmol h−1 mgcat−1, which was 2.8 times that of pristine LaCoO3. Further DFT calculations showed that the introduction of oxygen vacancies was conducive to the formation of electron-rich catalytic sites, thereby weakening the NN triple bond and activating N2 molecules. As an element of the same family as oxygen, sulfur vacancies exhibited a similar promotion effect towards the NRR by facilitating N2 adsorption and NN bond breaking.67
Besides, nitrogen vacancies and phosphorus vacancies also exhibited prominent effects of promoting the NRR. In 2019, Qiao et al. prepared a two-dimensional layered W2N3 nanosheet of which the catalytic center was demonstrated to be the nitrogen vacancies.109 Different from oxygen vacancies, the authors pointed out that the nitrogen vacancies would induce an electron-deficient environment which favoured the facile adsorption of N2 and lowered the potential of the NRR (Fig. 7a and b). As for phosphorus vacancies, oxygen-doped Cu3P nanosheets with abundant phosphorus vacancies developed by Zhang et al. catalyzed the NRR electrochemically with an NH3 yield of 28.12 μg h−1 cm−2 and a high faradaic efficiency of 17.5%, about 3.4 times higher than that for the corresponding Cu3P materials without phosphorus vacancies.93 Other anion vacancies like tellurium vacancies were also found to be capable of modulating the electronic structures of catalysts and supplying electrons for the NH3 synthesis reaction.110

3.1.3.2 Cation vacancies. 
Compared with anion vacancies, cation vacancies have attracted relatively less attention for electrochemical NRR systems. In 2019, Wen et al. reported that N-doped C/Fe2O3 nanoparticles were effective for electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis.111 The iron cation vacancies in the catalysts were shown to play an important role in promoting N2 adsorption. Another function of cation vacancies was to shift the energy barrier of the NRR. For example, Yan et al. demonstrated that bismuth vacancies were capable of decreasing the NRR activation energy by 0.47 eV and facilitating the conversion of N2 into the *N2H intermediate (Fig. 7c and d).112 Molybdenum vacancies displayed similar positive effects and mechanisms to those described above.113


3.1.4 Surface/interface engineering. 
Surface/interface engineering by introducing a heterogeneous support or coating has been illustrated as a powerful strategy for catalytic material modification. Owing to the stabilized nanomaterials,114–118 enhanced charge transfer,119–123 tuned electronic structure,124,125 fully exposed active sites,126–130 and the constructed hydrophobic interface,131–134 the activity and selectivity of electrochemical NRR systems are thus improved.
In 2019, Ding et al. observed that after anchoring C/CoS onto a TiO2 nanofibrous membrane, a high NH3 yield rate of 2.9 μmol h−1 cm−2 and a faradaic efficiency of 28.6% were achieved for the NRR.115 The function of TiO2 was subsequently revealed to suppress the agglomeration of CoS nanosheets and enable fast charge transfer. In the same year, Chen et al. promoted the NRR catalyzed by copper nanoparticles through contact with a polyimide support.124 Mechanistic studies illustrated that the Mott–Schottky interface formed between the metal catalysts and the semiconductor support would tune the electron density of copper, which hindered the HER competition effectively in a basic solution. Furthermore, decorating with amorphous layers to induce full exposure of active sites was also developed for gold nanowires as reported by Wang et al.129 Last, taking advantage of a hydrophobic coating to suppress the HER is regarded as a direct method to improve the faradaic efficiency. For example, Du et al. fabricated one Au/ZIF composite and showed that it was an active and stable catalyst for the electrochemical NRR.131 The hydrophobic ZIF shell was confirmed to be able to control the access of H2O to the surface of the catalyst, thus realizing a high faradaic efficiency of 44% and an NH3 yield rate of 1.7 μmol h−1 cm−2, which were superior to the traditional gold nanoparticles or nanoporous gold (Fig. 8a).

3.1.5 Synergistic effects. 
Coupling different components135–141 or functional fragments86,142–149 into one advanced structure and using the synergistic effect to construct better performing catalysts have been developed for the electrochemical NRR as well. In 2019, Li et al. prepared NiAu coupled nanoparticles and illustrated their high activity and selectivity toward electrocatalytic NH3 generation.139 Both experimental and theoretical characterization revealed that the electron transfer process from nickel to gold was conducive to N2 adsorption activation on the gold surface, thereby leading to a faradaic efficiency as high as 67.8%. Similar synergistic effects were also observed for a CoAu alloy,138 bimetallic MoCo/N-doped porous carbon,140 and nanoalloy AuCu/ZIF-8141 reported by Zhang et al., Leung et al., and Liu et al., separately. More specifically, the bimetallic MoCo catalyst exhibited enhanced activity and selectivity towards the NRR compared to the single-metallic Co counterpart, which was ascribed to the synergistic effect of strong and weak adsorption of N2 by Mo and Co, respectively.140
The combination of different functional fragments into one system to promote its behavior was also studied for the electrochemical NRR. In 2019, MacFarlane et al. constructed a Ru/MoS2 composite in which the ruthenium clusters acted as the N2 adsorbing sites while the adjacent sulfur vacancies of MoS2 were responsible for the hydrogenation process (Fig. 8b).142 The synergy between these two parts contributed to the high-performance NRR system. At the same time, Huang et al. demonstrated that the superior NRR behavior of Au–Fe3O4 nanoparticles was attributed to the synergistic effect between Fe3O4 and gold, which displayed strong N2 adsorption and electron transfer capacity, respectively.145 Therefore, by combining the N2 adsorption and activation capacity, HER suppression capacity, and high electrical conductivity of different materials, the construction of a highly efficient and selective NRR system is expected to be realized.

3.2 NRR catalytic system development

3.2.1 Electrolyte development. 
The composition and proportion of the electrolyte will significantly affect the performance of an electrocatalytic system. As for the NRR, studies by Yan et al.150 and Tang et al.151 both revealed that K+ ions in the electrolyte would effectively prevent H+ from arriving at the surface of heterogeneous catalysts, thus improving the faradaic efficiency of the electrochemical NH3 synthesis system. Besides, the NH3 yield rate could be further enhanced in phosphate medium since N2 has a relatively higher solubility in phosphate solution than in aqueous solution.151 Other non-aqueous electrolytes such as ionic liquids were also developed for the electrocatalytic NRR.152,153 In 2018, MacFarlane et al. reported that, when employing a mixture of an aprotic fluorinated solvent and a hydrophobic ionic liquid as the electrolyte, the faradaic efficiency of an α-Fe/carbon nanofiber catalyzed NRR system was enhanced without sacrificing the NH3 yield rate severely (Fig. 9a and b).153

3.2.2 Other strategies. 
Strategies such as replacing the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with other oxidation reactions154–156 and applying a certain pressure for the electrocatalytic system157 were also explored to promote the NRR. For instance, Wei et al. fabricated an electrochemical NH3 synthesis system with a Cu-MOF as the catalyst and sodium gluconate oxidation as the anodic reaction.156 Further electrocatalytic studies demonstrated that the NH3 yield rate of the system was increased by 10 times after the original OER was replaced by the oxidation reaction of sodium gluconate to glucaric acid. Another example reported by Wang et al. suggested that a certain pressure of 0.7 MPa applied for the NRR system helped to enhance the current efficiency and reduce the cell voltage without a decline of the NH3 yield rate (Fig. 9c and d).157

4. Criteria for the electrochemical NRR and NH3 quantification
4.1 Criteria for the electrochemical NRR
For an electrochemical NRR system, the NH3 yield rate (rNH3) and faradaic efficiency (FE) are the most commonly used criteria to evaluate the electrocatalysts according to the following equations: rNH3 = nNH3/(t × mcat)(1) FE (%) = (3 × nNH3 × F)/Q(2)where nNH3 is the amount of NH3 produced during electrolysis, t is the electrolysis time, mcat is the mass of the catalyst, F is the Faraday constant, which equals 96485.3 C mol−1, and Q is the charge consumed during electrolysis.
The rNH3 values for industrial H–B catalysts are generally on the order of 10–60 μmol h−1 mgcat−1.158 Kulkarani et al. assumed that the electrocatalytic NRR would be reasonable for commercial systems if the NH3 yield rate and faradaic efficiency could achieve around ∼10−4 mol h−1 cm−2 and ∼50%, respectively.159 At the same time, the targets set by the U.S. Department of Energy are more challenging, that is, an NH3 yield rate of 3.6 × 10−3 mol h−1 cm−2 and a faradaic efficiency of 90%.160 To date, however, most published NH3 yield rates and faradaic efficiencies are less than 10−6 mol h−1 cm−2 and 10%, respectively.10 Considering the huge gap between the target and recent data, fundamental innovations and breakthroughs are therefore urgently needed.
Another important but less mentioned criterion is the energy efficiency, which refers to the ratio of the energy we can harvest from one mole of NH3 to the total energy input to produce one mole of NH3. The energy consumption of the industrial H–B process is about 485 kJ mol−1.161 According to the NH3 oxidation reaction 4NH3 + 3O2 ⇌ 6H2O + 2N2 (ΔG = −339.2 kJ mol−1), we can calculate a fairly high energy efficiency of ∼70% for the H–B process under ideal conditions. As for the electrochemical NRR, all of the reported NH3 production energy efficiencies were below 13% due to the severe HER competition, while the total energy efficiency would be acceptable when counting both NH3 and H2.158 It should be noted that the above discussion of energy efficiency in the literature is based on ideal conditions, i.e. other side reactions besides the NRR and HER as well as the overpotential of the OER are not taken into account. In fact, as an energy material, the synthesis of NH3 is inherently energy-intensive (the most-efficient biological MoFe nitrogenase still consumes 244 kJ mol−1 for NH3 synthesis). Combined with the high potential needed for the anodic OER, a considerable amount of energy input is also required even for an electrochemical NH3 synthesis system. However, the electricity can be converted from renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear, and the electrochemical reactions can be operated with fluctuating power as well. Hence, from the perspective of maximizing the energy efficiency to reach a similar or higher (by about 10%) level than that for the H–B process (∼70%), a highly reactive NRR catalyst with poor selectivity may also be a good candidate for concurrent NH3/H2 production and the strategy of optimizing or replacing the anodic OER with other value-added oxidation reactions should also be well developed.
4.2 NH3 quantification
The accurate quantification of NH3 and confirmation of the source of nitrogen are the basis for correct evaluation of the NRR system performance. Currently, the most common methods used for NH3 determination in aqueous solutions are the indophenol blue and Nessler's reagent methods as well as ion chromatography, 1H NMR, etc.162 These detection methods possess different applicable conditions and limitations, e.g., the pH value of the reaction medium and the presence of certain metal ions and organic compounds may all interfere with the quantification of NH3, especially when spectrophotometry is employed. Thus, care should be taken and more than one detection method should be used to better ensure the accuracy of the results.163,164
Another crucial issue is to identify the source of nitrogen.
Despite the rapid development of electrochemical NH3 synthesis research over the past few years, the current NH3 production is still too small to be confident that the product NH3 detected is from the electrochemical nitrogen reduction process rather than nitrogen contamination in the form of ammonia, amines, nitrates, nitrites, nitrogen oxides and so on, which are ubiquitous in catalysts (nitrogen-containing catalysts or residuals from the preparation process),165,166 electrolytes,167 experimental devices and materials (including cells, electrodes, flow lines, ion-exchange membranes, gloves, pipette tips, etc.),168 the surroundings (ambient air and human breath) and even the high-purity feed gas (14N2 and 15N2).169 Therefore, a gas-tight reaction chamber is first required to exclude the interference from the laboratory atmosphere and human breath, which should be cleaned with dilute H2SO4 and then thoroughly rinsed with ultrapure water before use. In addition, a gas purification device prior to the gas inlet is necessary and a set of control experiments using N2, Ar, and 15N2 as a feed gas under different conditions should be fully conducted to confirm that a catalyst does have NRR activity.170,171

Table 2 lists the specific control experiments to be performed and the purpose of them. With the first type, i.e. blank or background controls, NH3 contamination from the gas feedstock, electrode substrates, and electrocatalysts can be checked and determined. The second Ar-based control experiments are able to exclude most of the false positives. In general, if the NH3 detected for the Ar-based controls is in quantities an order of magnitude lower than that of the N2 electrolysis group, then we can assume that the catalysts being tested have at least some NRR activity (Table 3).

In addition to the above two types of control tests, a 15N-isotopic labeling experiment is considered as an ultimate solution to the nitrogen source issue. Chorkendorff et al. recently proposed a rigorous protocol for research on electrochemical NH3 synthesis using 15N2, where the quantification of 15NH3 should be consistent with that of 14NH3 produced in the corresponding 14N2 reduction reaction by 1H NMR.172 It is worth noting that the 15N2 gas feedstock usually contains impurities such as 15NH3 and 15NOx, which, however, can be effectively removed by passing through a reduced copper catalyst. Though the electrochemical NRR has no standard testing procedures so far, valuable experimental protocols proposed by Qiao et al., Chorkendorff et al., and MacFarlane et al. can be used for reference and adoption.10,172,173
5. Conclusions and perspectives
In this review, recent progress in the electrochemical NRR and strategies to improve the activity and selectivity have been summarized and discussed. In years of development, the performance of catalytic NH3 synthesis systems has been highly promoted as expected. However, from industrial and commercial perspectives, research in this area still has a long way to go. In order to realize the NRR at a practical level, a flowchart for electrochemical NH3 synthesis research is proposed (Fig. 10) and specific suggestions are summarized as follows:
 Fig. 10  Flowchart for electrochemical NH3 synthesis research. 
(1) The first thing that needs to be done is to properly design the NRR experiment to minimize nitrogen contamination and ensure the reliability of the data, as this is the basis for all subsequent discussions and analyses.
(2) For the design of NRR catalysts, the most important consideration is their ability to adsorb and activate N2. In our opinion, transition metal based materials are the most promising candidates since their half-full d orbitals are able to receive and give electrons, which are exactly required for the adsorption and activation of N2. The catalyst modification strategies summarized in this review are essentially based on the optimization of the electronic structure of NRR catalysts to enhance the adsorption of N2 and reduce the interaction with hydrogen as well as the modulation of the morphological structure to expose more catalytic sites. Combining the strategies described above with predictable calculations, the design and synthesis of efficient and highly selective NRR catalysts can become more rational and reasonable.
(3) As for the design of NRR catalytic systems, the use of non-aqueous solvents with high N2 solubility as the electrolyte will undoubtedly shift the reaction equilibrium toward the product, but since the amount of NH3 produced is still extremely low at this stage, the reduction of these solvents themselves and the interference of their presence with the accurate quantification of the product NH3 require extra care. In addition, the anodic coupling strategy has attracted increasing attention. By replacing the kinetically sluggish OER with other reactions such as the oxidation of sodium gluconate, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, urea, methanol/ethanol, etc., the catalytic cycle between the cathode and anode will be facilitated and value-added chemicals are available simultaneously. Last, after considering both the input and output, slightly increasing the pressure and temperature of the reaction system to reduce the cell voltage may be adopted as a method to improve the overall energy efficiency.
(4) Mechanistic studies of the NRR are still limited and plain, most of which have only simulated the possible reaction pathways and the energy barriers by means of theoretical calculations. The capture and identification of the reaction intermediates as well as the microscopic changes of NRR catalysts using in situ experimental techniques are highly desirable, since these studies together with knowledge of the reaction mechanisms in biological and homogeneous systems will offer instructions for better performing NRR catalyst development.
(5) Last but not least, due to the quite low NH3 yield and the ubiquitous nitrogen contaminants, care should be taken when reporting a positive result. The control experiments discussed in Section 4.2 should be fully conducted to ultimately guarantee the accuracy of the results to be reported.
As one of the most crucial chemicals for human society and a potential energy material in the future, the quest for green synthesis of NH3 will not stop. The thermodynamic feasibility at room temperature and rapid development of the electrochemical NRR in the past few years have confirmed the possibility of NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions. But the conventional H–B process and H–B technology employing hydrogen from water electrolysis are expected to continue to dominate at least for the next decade. For electrochemical NH3 synthesis to be competitive with the current H–B process, it would need to achieve at least a similar level of energy efficiency and NH3 yield rate to the H–B process, i.e. ∼70% and ∼30 μmol h−1 mgcat−1, respectively. Although there is a huge gap between the above targets and the current levels, it will be narrowed by the discovery and optimization of sufficiently reactive and selective catalysts. Carrying out research in the field of electrochemical NH3 synthesis might hopefully mitigate the future energy issues in a green and sustainable fashion.
