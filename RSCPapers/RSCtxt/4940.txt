    , Accepted 18th April 2023First published on 19th April 2023AbstractThe synthesis, structure, optical and redox properties as well as photovoltaic studies of iridium(III) complexes with cyclometalated 2-arylbenzimidazoles decorated with various polyaromatic fragments and an ancillary aromatic β-diketone are reported. Despite the strong preference of the iridium(III) ion to form bis- or tris-cyclometalated complexes in which the metal participates in five-membered metallacycles, the cyclometalation of the benzimidazole ligands containing rigid π-extended systems yields dimeric complexes containing strained five- or six-membered metallacycles and allows for generating an extremely rare monocyclometalated complex. X-ray crystallography shows that the steric strain observed in the dimers is retained in heteroleptic diketonate complexes which is also corroborated by gas-phase DFT calculations. While emission maxima and redox potentials of the heteroleptic complexes exhibit just a moderate variation upon the change of the cyclometalated ligands, the extension of the π-system of the benzimidazole ligands give the complexes remarkable light absorption in the visible spectral range, which meets the requirements for application in dye-sensitized solar cells. At the titania photoanodes, these iridium dyes retain their optical properties and exhibit power conversion efficiencies under standard AM 1.5 G conditions comparable to those of other iridium-based sensitizers. These results demonstrate that the size and position of the π-extended fragment in cyclometalated ligands can modulate not only the electronic structure of the corresponding iridium(III) complexes, but also affect their composition, structure and reactivity that may find implications in future design of emerging iridium dyes, emitters and catalysts.
Introduction
Unique photophysical properties of octahedral d6 cyclometalated iridium complexes in combination with their high stability determine current and potential application of these complexes1–5 in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),6–8 photodynamic therapy and bioimaging,9–13 as homogeneous photocatalysts,14,15 biosensors,16–18 building blocks for supramolecular architectures19–21 and photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC).22–27 The latter technology is experiencing a renaissance,28 being highly attractive for several niche applications (mostly indoors) for which diffuse light performance, transparency and flexibility are more important factors than the high efficiency. As the DSSC panels should in general withstand high temperatures, thermally and photostable cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes are considered as potential alternatives to the ruthenium(II) and organic dyes in the long term.29–32 While photo- and electrophosphorescent iridium(III) complexes with intense emission covering almost all the visible spectral range have been reported the development of light-harvesting iridium(III) dyes for solar cells is still a challenging task.
Octahedral iridium(III) complexes often feature a great variability of optical and electrochemical properties accomplished by the change of substituents in cyclometalated ligands. In line with this, introduction of electron-donating groups to the ligands is considered suitable to reach the required absorptivity (ε ∼ 104 M−1 cm−1 at λ > 450 nm) of the complexes. However, while weak electron-donors cause just a little effect on absorption of the complexes,33 strong π-donors in the ligands induce a red-shift of the absorption maxima tailing to 600 nm but do not lead to a significant enhancement of extinction coefficients for these bands.34–37 In fact, such modifications of the ligands result in a dramatic drop of the metal d-orbitals contribution to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the complexes decreasing the intensity of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands.24
Still, the narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO gap with simultaneous maintaining the significant contribution of the metal d-orbitals to the HOMO is not sufficient for creation of an ideal metal photosensitizer for DSSC. The localization of the frontier molecular orbitals enabling the charge transfer directionality from the cyclometalated fragment to the “anchoring” ligand (necessary for binding a dye to the semiconductor surface) is also very important. So, the introduction of the dicyanovinyl38 or bulky coumarin chromophore fragments39 into the cyclometalated ligands, although producing strongly visible light-absorbing complexes, gave rise to the unfavorable localization of the orbitals which, in turn, resulted in low efficiencies of DSSCs. The use of chromophore-appended ancillary ligands, for example, bis(arylimino)acenaphthenes afforded panchromic iridium(III) complexes,40 but functionalization of these ligands by “anchoring” carboxy-groups was accompanied by a dramatic drop of the absorption efficiency in the visible spectral range41 or by irreversible oxidation of the complexes.42 Similarly, a several-fold increase in molar absorptivity of iridium(III) complexes at 500–550 nm was achieved by incorporation of the azo-group into imidazole but the resulting iridium dyes undergone undesired irreversible ligand-centered oxidation.43 The use of bulky strongly π-donating arylamino- entities in cyclometalated or bipyridine-based ancillary ligands also provides strongly absorbing but irreversibly oxidizing complexes.44,45
In turn, octahedral d6 metal complexes with ligands having the extended conjugated π-system tend to possess enhanced visible light absorption preserving the favorable charge transfer direction.46–50 Among other N-heterocyclic systems suitable for cyclometalation, 2-arylbenzimidazoles have been recognized as a versatile platform for creating various cyclometalated iridium(III) entities because all aromatic units in these ligands (2-aryl, N-aryl, benzimidazolyl) can be easily and independently decorated with various π-extended systems by conventional chemical reactions. Thus, several series of iridium(III) complexes with cyclometalated π-extended benzimidazoles and a diverse set of ancillary ligands were reported (Fig. 1). It was shown that iridium(III) complexes with isomeric naphthalene-based benzimidazoles possessed substantially different absorption spectra.51 Similar compounds containing slightly different isoquinoline-benzimidazole ancillary ligands demonstrated strong light absorption up to 500 nm and intense orange-red emission.52 The incorporation of the bulky phenanthrene unit into the cyclometalated ligand led to strongly absorbing but weakly luminescent Ir(III) complexes with six-membered metallacycles.53 The use of naphtimidazole ligands gave access to dual emissive Ir(III) complexes.54
 Fig. 1  Previously prepared series of iridium(III) complexes with benzimidazoles containing various polyaromatic fragments and the series studied in this work. 
Comparing the results of these studies, the pure effects of the nature and position of the polyaromatic fragment(s) remain partially obscure as they can only be distinguished by analyzing the series with the same ancillary ligand. However, this gets further complicated by the fact that the enlargement of the π-system can also be accompanied by increase of steric hindrance exerted by the ligands negatively affecting the stability of the iridium octahedron.55 For example, the combination of bulky phenanthroimidazole-based ligands (containing two additional fused rings as compared to the parent benzimidazole system) and an ancillary aromatic β-diketone or pyridyl-phenanthroimidazole around the iridium(III) ion did not lead to the improvement of absorption in the visible region,56–58 but surprisingly enhanced the reactivity of the complexes, which dissociated on the surface of the standard titania photoanodes.59
Based on these studies, we have concluded that phenanthroimidazole is the edge case (at least for imidazole-based cyclometalating ligands) and further extension of the conjugated π-system in this part of the ligands can only lead to a further decrease in the stability of the octahedral complexes. It is also evident that all the above approaches to the development of perfect iridium dyes offer limitations because separation of strong light-harvesting characteristics from the side effects has not been mastered.
A relief of the steric pressure can be induced by the change in the coordination mode of the π-extended cyclometalated ligands. The reaction of a benzimidazole ligand bearing the phenanthrene moiety with iridium trichloride hydrate results in a complex possessing only six-membered metallacycles,53 while the use of similar but less sterically demanding ligand based on naphthalene yields a mixture of two isomeric cyclometalated products containing five- and six-membered metallacycles.60 This change in conformation of the ligands around the iridium(III) ion (from five- to six-membered cycles) affects their curvature that may impact optical properties of the complexes. Bidentate ligands forming six-membered metallacycles usually contain methylene spacers which leads to a significant drop of the luminescence quantum yields of iridium(III) complexes,61,62 while cyclometalation of similar polydentate ligands results in more rigid systems with better optical characteristics.63,64 Several iridium(III) complexes containing six-membered metallacycles formed by π-conjugated ligands have been used as photooxidation sensitizers65 or emitters in OLEDs.66
Herein we present a series of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes with cyclometalated ligands possessing gradually increasing π-system conjugation from benzo[b]thiophene and naphtimidazole to phenanthrene moieties supported by the aromatic β-diketone decorated with the “anchoring” carboxy-group. We systematically examined the effect of the ligands structure on photophysical and redox behavior of the complexes and carefully investigated their electronic structures. The most light-absorbing complexes were successfully tested in solar cells in which they demonstrated optical and photovoltaic characteristics comparable to those of common ruthenium(II) photosensitizer N719 and, hence, these novel iridium(III) complexes can be considered as promising agents for solar energy harvesting.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
Benzimidazole ligands having extended π-systems were synthesized in high yields via condensation of diamines with aromatic aldehydes in the presence of sodium metabisulfite. Reaction of 2-(2-benzo[b]thienyl)-1-phenyl-benzimidazole (btbi), 1-benzyl-2-phenyl-naphtimidazole (bni) and 2-(2-naphthyl)-1-phenyl-benzimidazole (nbi-2) with iridium trichloride hydrate under standard conditions67 (Scheme 1) gave corresponding cyclometalated chlorides in relatively high yields (73, 74, and 63%, respectively).
 Scheme 1  Preparation of μ-chloro-bridged cyclometalated Ir(III) dimers containing 5- or 6-membered metallacycles depending on the benzimidazole ligand used. 
The cyclometalation of 2-(1-naphthyl)-1-phenyl-benzimidazole (nbi-1) under the same conditions furnished a mixture of two main products with a combined isolated yield of 41% (Fig. 2, blue line). Although the cycloiridation of this ligand under the same conditions was described in the literature,51,52 the crude product was used without further purification or analysis and no evidence for the formation of different regioisomers was proposed. In this work, separating the mixture into individual compounds by solubility or by column chromatography was unsuccessful suggesting that the components were isomeric μ-chloro-bridged dimers differing from one another in just the mode of cyclometallation and, hence, demonstrating similar chromatographic behavior and solubility. Based on published data,53 we further supposed that the proportion of the dimer incorporating five-membered metallacycles could increase with the reaction temperature. Raising the latter by replacing 2-ethoxyethanol–water (3:1) mixture by pure 2-ethoxyethanol allowed isolating (in 33% yield) one of the isomers in pure form that was confirmed by its 1H NMR spectrum perfectly matching the part of the spectrum of the initially synthesized mixture (Fig. 2, red line). The broadening of two distinct signals at 7.85 and 7.68 ppm in the spectrum of this isomer seemed to result from the hindered rotation of the N-phenyl fragment which could occur only in the cyclometalated chloride possessing five-membered metallacycles.
 Fig. 2  Aromatic regions of 1H NMR spectra of different cyclometalated Ir(III) chlorides with 2-(1-naphthyl)-1-phenyl-benzimidazole (nbi-1): [Ir(nbi-1)2Cl]2 with 6-membered iridacycles (green), [Ir(nbi-1)2Cl]2 with 5-membered iridacycles (red) and the mixture of isomers (blue). 
The reaction of more bulky 1-phenyl-2-(9-phenanthrenyl)-benzimidazole (phbi) with IrCl3·3H2O under the standard conditions resulted in a mixture having a more complex and less informative 1H NMR spectrum (see below X-ray structural data for crystals separated from this mixture). In turn, the use of pure 2-ethoxyethanol furnished only one dominant product in 88% yield, with its 1H NMR spectrum consisting of only sharp signals indicating that the isolated complex did probably not contain five-membered metallacycles (Fig. S14†).
The prepared cyclometalated iridium(III) chlorides were treated with methyl 3-(3-oxo-3-thiophen-2-ylpropanoyl)benzoate (L) in the presence of potassium carbonate to afford the desired heteroleptic complexes (Scheme 2). This reaction proceeded smoothly for [Ir(btbi)2Cl]2, [Ir(nbi-1)2Cl]2, [Ir(nbi-2)2Cl]2, and [Ir(bni)2Cl]2, while precursor [Ir(phbi)2Cl]2, presumably containing six-membered metallacycles, surprisingly, reacted with the diketonate very slowly. The chloride abstraction from this complex with silver trifluoromethanesulfonate in acetonitrile before subsequent reaction of the solvento iridium(III) complex with the diketone was found to be an excellent high yield (71%) route to the desired heteroleptic complex.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of complexes 1–5. 
Apparently, the reactivity of the dimers in chloride ligand substitution drastically decreased as the size of metallacycles increased from 5 to 6. We further supposed that two regioisomers obtained in cycloiridation of nbi-1 could be separated taking advantage of their reactivity differences. The mixture of isomers (Fig. 2, blue line) was treated with an excess of the diketone L and K2CO3 in refluxing acetonitrile for 8 h and the resulting solution and undissolved solid were analyzed by 1H NMR. The spectrum of the solution was uninterpretable (most likely due to the presence of several heteroleptic iridium(III) species) while the aromatic signals in the spectrum of the precipitate perfectly matched the rest of the spectrum of the two isomers mixture (Fig. 2, green line). So, the diketonate “leached out” the much more reactive isomer with five-membered metallacycles from the mixture while the remaining solid contained the pure isomer with six-membered metallacycles. Thus, the results indicated that the reactivity of the dimers was governed solely by the size of metallacycles, supporting our initial assumption.
Chemical structures of complexes 1–5 were identified by 1H, 13C{1H}, COSY (1H,1H) NMR, and high-resolution mass spectra (Fig. S16–S39†). For all the complexes except 4, regardless of the ionization method (APPI or ESI), the molecular ion peak is superimposed to the [M + H] ion peak. Besides the single molecular ion peak, mass spectra of all the complexes display intensive peaks which can be assigned to the Ir(C^N)2+ species forming after loss of the diketonate fragment. It indicates that the Ir–O bonds are less strong than Ir–C and Ir–N bonds.
X-ray crystallography
Molecular structures of the cyclometalated iridium(III) chlorides and complexes 1–5 determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis are depicted at Fig. 3–5 and S40.† In the solid state, all the chlorides adopt common dimeric structures with two μ-chloro ligands bridging the iridium centers surrounded by cyclometalated benzimidazoles in a distorted octahedral geometry.

Dimers [Ir(btbi)2Cl]2, [Ir(nbi-2)2Cl]2, and [Ir(bni)2Cl]2 contain five-membered metallacycles while in [Ir(phbi)2Cl]2 and in the less reactive isomer of [Ir(nbi-1)2Cl]2, as expected,53 iridium(III) ions form six-membered metallacycles. For all the prepared dimers, the Ir–C, Ir–N, and Ir–Cl distances lie within the typical ranges according to the Cambridge Structural Database (ver. 5.43 Nov. 2022).
All the structures are stabilized by intramolecular π–π interactions between the aromatic rings of the benzimidazole/naphthimidazole core of the ligands coordinated to the adjacent iridium(III) ions. While the coordinated bni is practically flat (maximal dihedral angle between the outermost benzene rings does not exceed 9°), nbi-2 and btbi are slightly twisted with the average interplanar angle of 13° and maximal reaching 22.25(8)°. The phenanthrene fragment of phbi is inclined to the benzimidazole unit by ca. 42.5°, reflecting the remarkable steric strain in the ligand caused by formation of the six-membered metallacycle. All the dimeric compounds form relatively loose crystal packings stabilized by weak π–π and C–H⋯π interactions, with solvent dichloromethane, chloroform, and/or acetonitrile molecules lying in cavities and/or channels.
Recrystallization of [Ir(phbi)2Cl]2 from hot acetonitrile or toluene/acetonitrile mixtures gave solids having molecular structures identical to that of the grown from CH2Cl2. This is rather surprising in view of the well-documented formation of mononuclear solvent adducts upon heating acetonitrile solutions of phenyl-pyridine68 and even aryl-benzimidazole24 cyclometallates. However, such behavior correlates well with the inertness to chloride ligand exchange observed for this dimeric chloride.
An analysis of the molecular structure of [Ir(phbi)2Cl]2 shows that formation of six-membered metallacycles is accompanied by the tilting of the benzimidazole fragment probably making the Ir2Cl2 core less accessible to an incoming ligand (Fig. S41†). The steric hindrance around the reaction centers was evaluated for the studied dimers and for the reference complex [Ir(ppy)2Cl]2 (ppy – 2-phenylpyridine) (Fig. S42, see further details in the ESI†).
Several small yellow crystals isolated from a NMR tube containing the mixture obtained in the cycloiridation of phbi under standard conditions appeared to be suitable for X-ray analysis. The structural study revealed that the crystals are composed of unprecedented non-symmetric dimers [Ir(C,N-phbi)(N,C-phbi)(μ-Cl)3Ir(C,N-phbi)Cl] with monocyclometalated iridium(III) centers (Fig. 4). Each iridium ion adopts a distorted octahedral geometry formed by one cyclometalated ligand and three bridging chlorides occupying the common face of the octahedrons.
The remaining site around the first metal ion is occupied by phbi coordinated in a monodentate mode by the nitrogen atom while the coordination environment of the second iridium ion is completed by a chloride ligand. Due to the face-sharing arrangement of the octahedra the Ir–Ir distance in this structure is considerably shorter (3.2593(3) Å) than that in [Ir(phbi)2Cl]2 (3.7980(3) Å). The Ir–Cl distances vary in the range from 2.3467(9) to 2.6399(10) Å, with the longest bonds lying opposite to the metalated carbon atoms because of trans-effect. In the crystal, these dimeric molecules are assembled by numerous C–H⋯π contacts forming cavities filled by solvent chloroform molecules.
The central ion in complexes 1–5 is located in a distorted octahedral C2N2O2 coordination environment with the trans-arrangement of two nitrogen atoms (Fig. 5). The Ir–C bond length vary within the range 1.972(9)–2.015(5) Å, while the Ir–N and Ir–O bond lengths lie within ranges 2.015(4)–2.046(3) Å and 2.114(3)–2.156(5) Å, respectively (Table S4†).
The conformations of the cyclometalated ligands depend on the size of their conjugated π-system. In the complexes 1, 3 and 5 with sterically compact btbi, nbi-2 and bni, the ligands remain nearly flat with deviations from planarity not exceeding 15°. In the complex 2, the cyclometalated nbi-1 ligand forming the 5-membered metallacycle is not planar and its naphthalene unit is inclined to the benzimidazole moiety by 26.5(3)° (Fig. S43†) because of steric repulsion between the naphthalene unit and N-phenyl ring. Similar tilting, but of greater magnitude (32.8(3)°), is observed in the complex 4 reflecting the increase in steric demand of the cyclometalated phbi (Fig. S43†). In analogous complexes with aliphatic diketonates, nbi-1 and phbi ligands are also noticeably twisted,53 indicating the key role of the C^N ligands π-system in formation of the iridium(III) coordination sphere. Still, the transformation of the dimeric chlorides to the complexes 1–5 is accompanied by a decrease in the curvature of the cyclometalated ligands, and the interplanar angle between the imidazole ring and metalated fragment becomes smaller by ∼5°. In structures 1–4, the pendant N-phenyl rings and the corresponding benzimidazole least-square planes are oriented at dihedral angles lying within 55.1(2)–75.8(4)°. The aromatic rings in the diketonate are highly disordered in all the structures except 5 and twisted with respect to the metallacycle and to one another. The extent of twisting is governed most probably by crystal packing peculiarities.
It is interesting to compare molecular structures of the complex 4 and Ir(III) complex containing cyclometalated 1,2-diphenylphenanthroimidazole59 which is a structural isomer of 1-phenyl-2-(9-phenanthrenyl)-benzimidazole. In the phenanthroimidazole complex, the phenanthrene fragment, not binding directly to the metal ion, exerts noticeable steric influence on the iridium octahedron making the latter significantly distorted. In the complex 4, the octahedral geometry around the iridium(III) ion, neglecting the longer Ir–O bonds due to trans-effect, is much more perfect, as evidenced by the similar Ir–C and Ir–N distances and by the values of the X–Ir–Y valence angles (X, Y–C, N, or O donor atoms) which are close to 90°. Thus, the replacement of 1,2-diphenylphenanthroimidazole by phbi leads to decrease of intra-octahedral distortions, whilst increasing the degree of ligand distortions as reflected in larger interplanar angles between the metalated and imidazole aromatic systems.
Comparing the structural data on complexes 1–5 and their chloride precursors to the previously obtained information concerning phenanthroimidazole iridium(III) complexes we can conclude that the geometry of the complexes is governed by a delicate balance between the strong preference of the iridium(III) ion to the octahedral environment, stability of the cyclometalated core, and the steric hindrance exerted by the ligands. With the gradual increase of the conjugated π-system size, the common five-membered metallacycles are replaced firstly by six-membered metallacycles with retention of the bis-cyclometalated coordination, but, when the steric effects become strong enough to outweigh the other factors, extremely rare monocyclometalated or non-octahedral iridium(III) complexes can be obtained.
Optical and redox properties
The prepared benzimidazole ligands are colorless and possess very strong absorption in the UV region with molar extinction coefficients exceeding 105 M−1 cm−1 due to π → π* electronic transitions localized on the extended aromatic systems of the ligands. Cyclometalation results in appearance of new low-energy bands (ε ≈ 10000–15000 M−1 cm−1) covering the range of 400–500 nm in the spectra of the corresponding dimeric cyclometalated iridium(III) chlorides (Table 1). These bands can be assigned to mixed MLCT/LLCT transitions.53 The introduction of the diketonate enables additional low-energy, but less intensive (ε ≈ 1000–2000 M−1 cm−1) bands tailing up to 600 nm, which can be attributed to metal-to-ligand(diketonate) and interligand (cyclometalated → diketonate) CT transitions (Fig. 6). The main contribution to the growth of molar absorptivity of the complexes 1–5 compared to their chloride precursors, which is more pronounced for 1 and 4 (Fig. S53†), is probably caused by partial decrease of the distortions of the cyclometalated ligands in 1–5 which favors the intraligand CT transitions.

A comparison of absorption spectra of the complexes 1–5 with those of the 1-phenyl-2-(2-thienyl)-benzimidazole-based Ir(III) complex (“parent” for complex 1) and 1,2-diphenylbenzimidazole-based Ir(III) complex (“parent” for the other complexes) containing the same diketone clearly shows that the enlargement of the π-system of the cyclometalated ligands results in enhancement of the molar absorptivity of the complexes in the visible range. The fusion of a benzene ring to the 4,5-positions of the metalated 2-thienyl ring (giving complex 1) causes a red shift of absorption maxima by 20–30 nm and an increase of absorbance at 320–500 nm by a factor of 1.2–1.8 (Fig. S54†).
The fusion of a benzene ring to the 2,3-positions of the metalated phenyl ring (giving complex 2) causes increase of absorbance at 450–550 nm by a factor of 2–4 while the same benzene ring fused with the 3,4-positions (complex 3) has a similar but noticeably smaller effect (still greater than in its benzoxazole analogues69), and the molar absorptivity of 3 at 450–550 nm is some 1.2–2 times that of the “parent” complex. The more pronounced enhancement of absorbance observed for the complex 2 correlates well with optical data for naphtalene-benzimidazole and naphthalene-thiazole complexes studied in the literature.51,70
Complex 4 demonstrates the most intense light absorption at 450–550 nm in the series with ε values ranging from 5000 to 16000 M−1 cm−1 which are an order of magnitude greater than those of the “parent” 1,2-diphenylbenzimidazole-based Ir(III) complex and comparable to those of commercial Ru(II) dyes71 (Fig. S55†) up to 510 nm. The UV-vis absorbance pattern of 4 looks similar to those of the complexes described in ref. 53, indicating that the aromatic diketonate slightly affects the absorption of the complex. Dye 4 contains cyclometalated 1-phenyl-2-(9-phenanthrenyl)-benzimidazole having one more fused benzene ring than the ligands in complexes 2 and 3 and, moreover, chelating the Ir(III) ion through a six-membered ring coordination mode. It seems difficult to separate effects due to extension of the π-conjugated system from changing the chelating mode, especially given that data for iridium(III) complexes with six-membered metallacycles are sparse. Nevertheless, there is a strong evidence indicating that, all else being equal, the difference in coordination mode of naphthalene-containing benzimidazole ligands (forming five- or six-membered iridacycles) has little effect on absorbance of the corresponding iridium(III) complexes in the visible spectral range.60 Hence, the tentative conclusion must be that the size of the π-conjugated system of the metalated fragment is the predominant influence.
In turn, the expansion of the benzimidazole scaffold with a benzene ring fused to the 5,6-positions also increases the visible-light absorption (at 400–500 nm) of the naphthimidazole-based complex 5 by a factor of 2–3 compared to the “parent” 1,2-diphenylbenzimidazole complex. Note that complex 5 displays, counter to intuition, substantially better light-harvesting characteristics (ε = 9500 M−1 cm−1 at 465 nm) than the abovementioned 1,2-diphenylphenanthroimidazole-based Ir(III) complex although the cyclometalated ligand in the latter contains one more fused benzene ring. This is likely because cyclometalated 1,2-diphenylphenanthroimidazoles, being substantially non-planar due to steric reasons, form a sterically crowed sphere around the iridium(III) ion that reduces probability of the charge transfer transitions, whereas the essentially planar conformation of the naphthimidazole ligands in 5 seems to favor the intra-, interligand and probably MLCT transitions. Notably, complex 5 absorbs light in a wider range of the visible spectrum than its literature analogues with ancillary diimine ligands,54 suggesting substantial diketonate involvement in some of the long-wavelength electronic transitions.
A comparison of UV-vis spectra of 4 and the phenanthroimidazole-based complex explicitly shows (Fig. S56†) that position of the phenanthrene fragment and, hence, its role in the metal ion coordination has great impact on light-harvesting properties of the complexes. While extinction coefficients of both complexes at 350–430 nm are almost the same (within the experimental error), complex 4 exhibits 5–15 times larger molar absorptivity at 450–530 nm.
The emission spectra of 1–5 in the solid state consist of weakly structured asymmetric bands at 600–800 nm‡ (Fig. 7). A relatively blue-shifted emission is observed for the complex 5 (λem = 639 nm) compared to 1–3 which demonstrate almost identical luminescence spectra centered at ∼670 nm, whereas complex 4 with the most extended conjugated π-system emits light with a maximum wavelength of 692 nm (Table 1).
 Fig. 7  Normalized emission spectra of complexes 1–5 measured at 25 °C in the solid state (nitrogen-filled capillary tube). 
The external quantum yields for 1–5 are less than 1% which are similar to those of the previously studied benzimidazole/benzoxazole and phenanthroimidazole bis-cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes containing aromatic 1,3-diketones.24,69 The emission decay curves of 1–5 fit to a multi-exponential decay law (Fig. S58†). The average excited-state lifetime (τ) of the complexes reaches maximal value of 54 ns for the complex 4 while for the other compounds, τ varies from 21 to 31 ns. This indicates that the lowest T1 emissive state of the complexes is dominated by the 3MLCT state, that is in line with results for similar benzimidazole-diketonate iridium(III) complexes.24,50
Complexes 1–5 demonstrate one reversible anodic wave related to the Ir(C^N)22+ ⇌ Ir(C^N)2+ process as evidenced by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile at 25 °C (Fig. S59†). For all the complexes except 4, the corresponding E1/2 values lie in the narrow range from 0.98 to 1.07 V vs. NHE (Table 1), which also includes redox potentials of the “parent” complexes. This indicates that enlargement of the π-system of the cyclometalated ligands has little effect on the energy of the ground state of the complexes irrespective of the fragment hosting additional benzene ring(s). In turn, the change of the coordination mode in 4 is accompanied by a significant drop of redox potential, reflecting destabilization of the HOMO level of 4 in comparison with the other complexes. This fact is in accordance with redox potentials of its diketonate analogues53 and with the most pronounced long-wavelength light absorption of this complex. The E0–0 values (energy difference between the ground and excited states, both taken at their zero vibrational levels) for 1–5 estimated from the luminescence data vary in a relatively narrow range with the maximal value of 2.18 eV for the most high-energy emitting complex 5 and the minimal value of 1.99 eV for the red-to-NIR emitting complex 4. Excited state oxidation potentials of 1–5 lie within the range from −1.07 to −1.15 V vs. NHE (Table 1).
DFT calculations
Gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) optimization of the ground state geometries of 1–5 expectedly give metal–ligand bond distances elongated by 0.02–0.06 Å (Tables S4 and S6†) in comparison with the single-crystal X-ray values.73 Nevertheless, the calculations reveal strong structural distortions of the cyclometalated ligands which are consistent with the X-ray diffraction data and indicate that crystal packing has little effect on the geometry of the complexes, and the ligands become bent mainly due to intramolecular interactions (Fig. S60†). In the “anchoring” ligand, the thiophene ring is almost coplanar with the rigid iridium-diketonate metallacycle for all the complexes whereas the phenyl-carboxymethyl ring is rotated relative to the same metallacycle to a greater extent giving the dihedral angles lying within 14.5 (complex 4)–25.9° (complex 1).
There is little variation in metal–ligand bond lengths for all the complexes except 3 and 5 in their optimized triplet geometries compared to those in the ground state (Table S6†). For complexes 3 and 5, the Ir–C distances become longer by some 0.015 Å with simultaneous significant foreshortening of the Ir–O distances by 0.06–0.10 Å while the Ir–N bonds do not show systematic changes. For 5, the transition to the T1 state is also accompanied by flattening the diketonate while for 3, the flattened ligand is additionally tilted out of the O–Ir–O plane by 28° (Fig. S60†). It seems reasonable, that these structural transformations of the complexes 3 and 5 might give them photoluminescent properties differing from the other complexes in the series. However, it is unlikely to register this effect in the solid-state emission spectra because the crystal packing hinders structural changes predicted by the gas-phase calculations.
The energy and composition of the frontier molecular orbitals of 1–5 are presented in Fig. 8 and Table S7.† The HOMO and HOMO−1 are mainly delocalized over the cyclometalated fragment with dominant contribution of π-orbitals of the benzimidazoles (48–91%) and small admixture of π-orbitals of the diketone (2–15%). The contribution of metal d-orbitals to the HOMO is moderately dependent on the nature of the cyclometalated ligand and lies in the range from 28% (complex 1) to 43% (complex 5) that appears enough for the complexes to show reversible redox behavior. The HOMO energy level is slightly increased for 1, 3 and 4 that agrees with their lower redox potentials compared to the other complexes (Table 1), but the experimentally observed trend is not captured in these calculations probably because of neglecting the solvation effect.74 Differences between the HOMO and HOMO−1 energy levels generally correlate with compositions of the orbitals, so for the complex 4, almost identical compositions of the HOMO and HOMO−1 imparts the near equality to their energies (difference is less than 0.03 eV).
 Fig. 8  Frontier molecular orbitals of complexes 1–5 and HOMO–LUMO gaps calculated by DFT (HOMO – highest occupied molecular orbital, LUMO – lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, DFT – Density Functional Theory). 
In the whole series, the LUMO and LUMO+1 are of exclusively ligand character, and the diketonate contributes mostly to the LUMO (>95%), while the LUMO+1 is solely localized on the cyclometalated ligands (>97%). This spatial separation of the unoccupied orbitals is consistently reflected in noticeable differences (0.15–0.50 eV) between the LUMO and LUMO+1 energy levels for all the complexes except 4 for which the difference is as small as 0.03 eV. The latter seems to be just a coincidence although it may significantly impact low-energy electronic transitions in the UV-Vis spectrum of 4 due to effective mixing of the charge transfer states with similar energies.
To gain more insights into the nature of electronic transitions responsible for absorptivity of the complexes in the visible spectral range, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations have been performed. TDDFT spectra of 1–5 are in good agreement with their experimental UV-Vis spectra (Fig. S61†). The lowest-energy absorption bands are originated from the HOMO → LUMO transitions corresponding to the charge transfer from iridium d-orbitals and π-orbitals of the “antenna” cyclometalated ligands to π*-orbitals of the “anchoring” diketonate. However, oscillator strengths of these transitions are low. The most intensive band in the visible range can be attributed to the charge transfer from the metal to the cyclometalated ligands with substantial contribution of intraligand (C^N) transitions, as guided by the data presented in Table S8.† Nevertheless, most of the other absorption bands of the complexes predicted by the TDDFT calculations mainly correspond to the mixed d(Ir) → π*(O^O) and π(C^N) → π*(O^O) electronic transitions and, thus, match the favorable charge transfer directionality necessary for using these iridium(III) complexes as photosensitisers in DSSC.
Photovoltaic study
Complexes 1–5 satisfy the main demands of DSSC exhibiting photophysical and redox characteristics which are similar to the N719 dye75 and having at least better molar absorptivity in the visible spectral range as compared to most of iridium(III) dyes (Fig. 9).

Complexes 1, 2 and 4 were selected for preparation of photoanodes due to their quite remarkable light-harvesting properties among the prepared dyes. A mild hydrolysis of the ester group of the diketonate by treatment with tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide proceeded in 5–30 min at r.t. and afforded salts 1H, 2H and 4H which possessed absorption spectra identical to those of the original complexes 1, 2 and 4 (Fig. S65†). The salts successfully sensitized titania photoanodes and did not show any signs of decomposition on the TiO2 surface in contrast to the phenanthroimidazole Ir(III) complexes containing the same diketone.59 Moreover, neither 1H NMR spectra of 1H, 2H and 4H measured in CDCl3 nor UV-Vis spectra of the salts recorded with various aging times (Fig. S66†) were indicative of at least partial decomposition of the dyes, a conclusion reinforced by their stability on the titania surface during photovoltaic measurements.
The current density–voltage curves for the prepared photoanodes under AM 1.5 G simulated solar light and in the dark are presented in Fig. 10.

All photoanodes coated by the iridium(III) dyes exhibit stable photoresponses (Fig. S67 and S68†), with the short-circuit current densities ranging from 1.25 to 2.60 mA cm−2, which are significantly lower than that of the Ru-based photoanode (JSC = 5 mA cm−2), whereas the open-circuit voltage values are relatively close for all tested dyes (Table 2).

A drop of the photocurrent density (and, hence, the overall efficiency η) with replacement of N719 by 1H, 2H or 4H is not unexpected. In our opinion, this is not only a result of the narrower absorption spectra of these iridium(III) dyes in comparison with N719 but also, and probably to a greater extent, a consequence of that the conditions (semiconductor, redox mediator, electrolyte, etc.) which are optimal for testing ruthenium(II) dyes may be far from optimal in the case of iridium(III) complexes. If so, low efficiencies of 1H, 2H and 4H could potentially be improved provided that optimum conditions would be experimentally attained; however, this is a separate and very difficult challenge behind the present study.
More details on the charge transfer occurring in the prepared photoanodes were obtained by using intensity-modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopies (IMPS and IMVS) (Fig. S69 and S70†). The lifetime of electrons ranges from 40.8 to 53 ms that is from 2 to 3 times longer than the injection time (14.6–20.4 ms) indicating that the electron transport to the conduction band of the semiconductor is kinetically more probable. However, comparing to the benzimidazole-based Ru(II) dyes68 the values of the charge collection efficiency (hcc = 1 − τtr/τrec) are relatively low suggesting significant contribution of parasitic processes negatively affecting the overall efficiency.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the sensitizers are in good agreement with their solution absorption spectra (Fig. 11) indicating that most electronic transitions in the visible range result in charge transfer to the excited states from which electron injection occurs. Considering similar fill factors, overall performance of the photoanodes correlates with the IPCE values and charge collection efficiencies. The lowest efficiency measured for 2H relates to the lowest hcc and gradually decreasing IPCE curve, whereas slightly higher photon-to-current efficiencies in the region 400–450 and above 550 nm determines the best performance of the 1H sensitizer. In turn, overall efficiency of the reference N719 dye is also moderate suggesting imperfect photoanodes fabrication, so the synthesized iridium dyes could probably produce more power.

Conclusions
We have succeeded in synthesizing stable iridium(III) complexes whose strong light-harvesting properties arise from the tailored combination of cyclometalated benzimidazole ligands decorated with various polyaromatic moieties and an aromatic β-diketone functionalized by the carboxymethyl “anchoring” group. These iridium dyes retain their remarkable optical properties being a part of titania photoanodes as reflected in their excellent electron transport kinetics and moderate power conversion efficiencies under standard AM 1.5 G conditions compared to other iridium-based sensitizers.
Extension of the π-system of the benzimidazole ligands, apart from purely electronic influence improving photophysical characteristics of the complexes, translates into a marked increase of steric pressure on the iridium octahedron. Accumulation of steric strain results in replacement of the common five-membered metallacycles by six-membered metallacycles with retention of the bis-cyclometalated coordination while massively enhancing the inertness with respect to chloride exchange in dimeric cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes. However, when the steric effects become strong enough to outweigh the other factors, an extremely rare monocyclometalated iridium(III) complex can be obtained. These results show that commonly overlooked characterization of cyclometalated iridium(III) chlorides can provide a deeper understanding of the ligands effect on the composition, structure and even reactivity of the complexes especially in view of the fact that the number and arrangement of the cyclometalated ligands in any heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes are inherited from the cyclometalated chlorides. Overall, this work demonstrates that in the case of rigid aromatic ligands, the size and position of the π-conjugated system are the key factors determining properties of cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes, offering inspiration for future design and synthesis of stable light-harvesting iridium(III) dyes.
Experimental
Materials and methods
All commercially available reagents were at least reagent grade and used without further purification. Solvents were distilled and dried according to standard procedures. 1-Phenyl-2-(1-naphthyl)-benzimidazole (nbi-1), 1-phenyl-2-(2-naphthyl)-benzimidazole (nbi-2), 1-phenyl-2-(9-phenanthrenyl)-benzimidazole (phbi), 1-phenyl-2-(2-benzo[b]thienyl)-benzimidazole (btbi) were synthesized similarly to those previously described.76 1-Benzyl-2-phenyl-[2,3]-naphtimidazole (bni) was synthesized according to published procedure.771H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra of cyclometalated ligands are presented in Fig. S1–S10.† Methyl 3-(3-oxo-3-thiophen-2-ylpropanoyl)benzoate (L) was synthesized according to published procedure.24 Preparation of iridium(III) complexes was carried out under dry argon. Purification and other manipulations with complexes were performed in air.

1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance 400 instrument and chemical shifts were reported in ppm referenced to residual solvent signals. High resolution and accurate mass measurements were carried out using a BrukermicroTOF-Q™ ESI-TOF (Electrospray Ionisation/Time of Flight) or APPI-TOF (Atmospheric Pressure PhotoIonization/Time of Flight) spectrometer. Electronic absorption spectra were measured on an OKB Spectr SF-2000 spectrophotometer. Luminescence measurements were performed on a Horiba Fluorolog QM spectrometer equipped with a 75 W xenon arc lamp as the excitation source for steady state experiments, 150 W xenon flash lamp and pulse DeltaLED sources for kinetic measurements. An R-13456 photomultiplier was used as a detector. The quantum yield measurements were carried out on solid samples with a Spectralone-covered G8 integration sphere (GMP SA, Switzerland) according to the absolute method of Wrighton.78–80 Each sample was measured several times under slightly different experimental conditions. The estimated error for quantum yields was ±10%. Powdered samples were placed in quartz tubes (4 mm o.d.), flushed with dry nitrogen and sealed. These tubes were used for both luminescent and quantum yield measurements. An Econix-Expert Ltd Ecotest-VA polarograph was used for electrochemical measurements with a glassy carbon working electrode, platinum counter electrode, and Ag/AgNO3 quasi-reference electrode. Polarographic curves were recorded in Ar-saturated acetonitrile with 0.1 M (n-Bu4N)ClO4 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Ferrocene was used as an external standard prior to measurements.

X-ray crystallography
Single crystals of [Ir(btbi)2(Cl)]2 were grown upon slow evaporation of a concentrated solution in CH2Cl2. Single crystals of [Ir(nbi-2)2(Cl)]2 were grown from a solution in a CH2Cl2/hexane mixture (1/1 vol). Single crystals of [Ir(phbi)2(Cl)]2 were grown upon slow evaporation of a concentrated solution in CH3CN or in a mixture of toluene and CH3CN or in a mixture of toluene and CH2Cl2. Single crystals of [Ir(bni)2(Cl)]2 were grown upon slow evaporation of a concentrated solution in CHCl3. Single crystals of 1 were grown upon evaporation of a solution of the complex in CH2Cl2/CH3CN (1/1 vol), single crystals of 2 and 3 were grown upon evaporation of solutions of the complexes in CH2Cl2/CH3OH (1/1 vol). Crystallographic data were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX II and D8 Venture diffractometers using graphite monochromatized Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) using a ω-scan mode. Absorption correction based on measurements of equivalent reflections was applied.81 The structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full matrix least-squares on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. In all the structures, hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and refined using a riding model. In structures of [Ir(phbi)2(Cl)]2 (from pure CH3CN), [Ir(nbi-2)2(Cl)]2 and 5 disordered solvent molecules were not located and their contribution was suppressed by the SQUEEZE procedure.82 Diketone L in structures of 2, 3 and 4 is disordered over two positions with approximately equal occupancies; in structure of 1 this ligand is disordered over four positions. Crystallographic information is presented in Tables S2–S5.† CCDC 2143132–2143145 and 2232112 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for all the structures presented in this work.†
Photovoltaic measurements
Sensitization of titania photoanodes (Solaronix) was performed by soaking them in ∼5 × 10−4 M acetonitrile solutions of dyes for 24 hours. A three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell PECC-2 (Zahner) was used for the photoanode potential measurements. The photoanode served as the working electrode and a platinum wire with the surface area of 5 cm2 was used as the auxiliary electrode, a silver wire was used as the reference electrode. The voltammetric measurements were performed with an IPC Pro MF potentiostat under AM 1.5 global one sun of illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (Newport 96000) in acetonitrile solution in the presence of 0.5 M LiI + 0.05 M I2. The illumination power at different distances was determined with a Nova apparatus (OPHIR-SPIRICON Inc.). Current–voltage characteristic of DSSCs and photocurrent density at the short-circuit voltage were performed by the two-electrode scheme. Transients of photoanode potential and photocurrent density at the short-circuit voltage were measured under irradiation and in dark condition. The photoanode area was 1.0 cm2. The illuminated photoanode area was restricted by a mask 0.196 cm2. The illumination was performed from the side of TiO2 photoanode with the adsorbed dye. Measurements of IMPS and IMVS as well as IPCE spectra were performed with a ZAHNER's CIMPS-QE/IPCE workstation. The photoanode was illuminated with a tunable light source, TLS03. IMVS were taken without superposition of external polarization, i.e., under open circuit conditions. IMPS were recorded under short-circuit conditions.
DFT calculations
All the gas-phase calculations reported in this paper have been performed within density functional theory (DFT),83 using the hybrid functional B3LYP.84,85 The standard def2-SVP basis set for light elements and Stuttgart-Dresden effective core potential (ECP) for Ir atom,86 as implemented in the ORCA 4.2 suite of programs,87 was applied. Frequency analysis was carried out to check if optimized structures were local minima. No imaginary frequencies were found for local minima. Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were carried out at the ground state geometries to obtain vertical excitation energies and theoretical absorption spectra. The lowest 35 singlet–singlet excitations were computed. Triplet geometries were calculated using the unrestricted B3LYP method (UB3LYP). The predicted phosphorescence wavelengths were obtained by energy difference between the triplet state at its optimized geometry and singlet state at the triplet geometry.
