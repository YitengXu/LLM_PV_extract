    , Accepted 17th April 2020First published on 18th April 2020AbstractResearch into catalytic materials that convert light energy into chemical energy by decomposing water still faces great difficulties. CuNi2S4 has attracted public attention due to its unique morphology; however, its high electron–hole recombination rate and weak charge separation efficiency limit its use in the field of catalysis. Herein, CoWO4 material is synthesized in situ on a CuNi2S4 surface by a hydrothermal method; the Z-type heterointerface constructed by the surface contact of the two materials under fusion shows a huge promotion effect on the catalytic ability. The performance (3754.3 μmol g−1 h−1) of the composite material (CW/CNS-12%) reached 42 and 6 times those of the two monomer materials, respectively, and the excellent catalytic ability of the composite is also reflected in its long-term stability. The experimental data proves that the modification of CuNi2S4 by building a heterostructure can improve the specific surface area of the material and the amount of carriers it generates. The charge transfer caused by the existence of the heterojunction hinders the recombination of carriers and holes; fluorescence and electrochemical characterization further confirms the charge transfer process in the Z-type heterojunction. This research provides new insights to promote catalytic performance by building heterostructures between monomer materials.
1. Introduction
In order to pursue a high standard of living and drive the continuous growth of the global economy, the exploitation of fossil energy has exceeded the tolerance of the Earth, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, debris flow and tsunami frequently occur. This exploitation also causes harmful emissions of human gases that exceed standards, and severe weather conditions (smog, acid rain) are frequent.1 Therefore, wind energy, solar energy and other green energy sources have gradually attracted the attention of researchers. Among these, chemical catalytic reactions driven by light energy are the most ideal method to achieve green development of energy sources.2,3 Also, because hydrogen is clean, efficient, and contains huge amounts of energy, it stands out among green energy sources. In all hydrogen evolution technologies, sunlight as the driving force, natural water resources as raw materials, and normal temperature and pressure provide the reaction environment for photocatalytic cracking of water to produce hydrogen (HER, H2) that is recognized as the most facile and reliable capacity technology.4,5 Also, the entire catalytic reduction process is very fast (excitation of the catalytic material by light occurs in 10−15 s, the generation, separation and transfer of electron–hole pairs occurs in 10−12 s, and the redox reaction on the material surface occurs in 10−6 s). Thus, the catalytic process is highly efficient.1 Therefore, a photocatalytic material with a simple preparation method, low cost, and excellent performance is a goal that is unremittingly pursued by all catalytic material explorers.
The performance of a catalyst can be affected in quite a few ways. For a single catalyst, the excited photoelectrons cannot be used immediately, and the chemical driving force for reduction of water to H2 is insufficient. Factors such as mismatched valence band position will affect the catalytic ability of the catalyst itself. In order to address the shortcomings of single catalysts,6,7 scientific researchers continue to explore new methods to modify monomer catalysts. Among these, the ion doping method, the addition of co-catalysts, and the construction of semiconductor catalyst heterostructures have significant effects.8 Different catalyst preparation methods are being explored to adjust the catalyst morphology, along with other measures.9 These preparation methods include photodeposition, ion exchange, and aging.10,11 In this area, some excellent catalysts have been gradually explored by researchers, such as CoSx/ZnO,12 MoS2/LaNiO3,13 Ag2S/K-C3N4,14 C-KNb3O8,15 and CuWO4/Co3S4.16 It can be seen that the catalytic properties of transition metals are excellent compared to those of some catalysts modified by precious metals,17–19 and semiconductor catalytic materials such as phosphides and sulfides fabricated with transition metals as co-catalysts show better performance than precious metal substances; additionally, the cost of the composite materials is low, and the Earth's reserves of transition metal are abundant. Bimetallic sulfides composed of transition elements (Mn, Co, Ni, etc.) have good structural morphologies and sizes. The petaloid-shaped round flower bud structure creates many active sites on the surface;20,21 this has a close relationship with the morphology and size of the catalyst, and researchers have also made amazing progress in applying three-dimensional structures to photocatalysis. Research has shown that bimetallic sulfides have stronger catalytic capabilities than their two monomer metal sulfides together.22,23 The low electronegativity of the S atom in TMS (a metal sulfide) has been widely exploted in capacitors, photovoltaic, magnetic electrodes and other fields,24 and transition metal elements such as Cu and Ni have excellent ion reduction properties. A semiconductor material composed of a combination of Cu, Ni, and S elements has an excellent effect on the increase and exposure of the active sites of the catalyst, and there is an increase in the ratio between the active edge position (electron density) and the inert substrate site.25 This is beneficial to optimization of the catalytic performance. Based on this, CuNi2S4 nano-flower-like photocatalytic materials were synthesized in this research.
Due to the many limitations of monomer catalysts, it is an important research direction to find composite catalysts with matching structures and good performance. Nano-oxides have excellent optical properties and singular structures, and metal tungstates (TMs) have good phase compositions due to their unique layered structures. Diversity and simplicity of the synthesis methods of these compounds has been widely explored and continuously pursued by researchers. Also, they can be flexibly applied in fields such as light-emitting materials, sensors, and photovoltaic cells.26 The general formula is represented as MWO4. M can be different metal elements. According to the differences in the metal substances, these compounds can be divided into square structures (tungstate) and monoclinic structures (wurtzite).27 On this basis, CoWO4 is outstanding because of its small particle size distribution, high stability, and eco-friendliness, and it is a highly adaptable metal material. However, due to the inappropriate position of its valence band, its value in catalytic hydrogen production is limited.28 The heterostructures formed by combining CoWO4 with other semiconductor substances can effectively avoid its defects,29–31 especially Z-type heterostructures. The Z-type structure is based on the appropriate valence bands (CB and VB) of the two monomer catalysts.32,33 There is a short transmission path between the lower CB of one catalyst and the higher VB of another catalyst, so that the carriers on the lower CB and the holes on the higher VB are combined; this migration of physical effects is a more feasible principle than other heterointerfaces.34,35 In addition, the two types of single catalysts contained in the Z-type heterojunction can effectively suppress the recombination of carriers and holes under the condition of simultaneous excitation and can also prolong the ability to sense light, thereby exhibiting better reducing ability. Therefore, it is very important to design a composite catalyst with a composite Z-type structure.
In this research, a CuNi2S4 transition bimetal sulfide was synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method; CoWO4 and CuNi2S4 were combined in a secondary hydrothermal process, and a catalytic material in which CoWO4/CuNi2S4 conforms to the Z-type heterojunction structure was obtained for the first time. The synergistic effect greatly improved the catalytic ability of the composites; this was further confirmed by characterizations such as fluorescence spectroscopy (PL) and BET. The excellent catalytic ability of this material is inseparable from the heterostructure formed between the two monomer catalysts. Based on experimental data and characterization, the relationship between the Z-type heterojunction and the catalytic effect was further proposed, indicating the potential of the development of this heterostructure in the field of catalysis.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation process

2.1.1. CuNi2S4 is prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. 
NiCl2·6H2O (nickel chloride hexahydrate, AR), CuCl2·2H2O (copper chloride dihydrate, AR) and CH4N2S (thiourea, AR) were added to a liquid mixture of water and ethylene glycol (EG) (v/v = 1:1); the molar ratio of the three raw materials was controlled at 1:2:12. After stirring until the solution became uniform, it was poured into a high-temperature and high-pressure reaction kettle, and the reaction environment was maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixed liquid in the reaction kettle was subjected to suction filtration and multiple washings, dried in a constant temperature drying box, and then ground uniformly with a mortar.


2.1.2. CoWO4/CuNi2S4 composite photocatalytic material was obtained by a hydrothermal method. 
An appropriate amount of the CuNi2S4 monomer catalyst prepared above was dissolved in an aqueous solution with ultrasonic dispersion; then, appropriate amounts of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, AR) and Na2WO4·2H2O (sodium tungstate dihydrate, AR) were added thereto, maintaining the molar ratio at 1:1. The theoretically calculated percentages of the mass of the synthesized CoWO4 to the total mass of the added CuNi2S4 were 6%, 9%, 12%, 15%, and 18%, respectively. After homogeneous stirring, the mixture was maintained in a reaction kettle at 180 °C for 24 h. The preparation of pure CoWO4 was carried out without the addition of CuNi2S4. The other operation conditions were identical to those of the composite catalyst. After cooling to room temperature, suction filtration, washing and drying operations were performed.
The synthesis of the catalyst is shown below (Scheme 1):

2.2. Characterization
The three-dimensional appearance of each catalyst was measured under a scanning electron microscope (SEM, ZEISS Sigma 500) with tungsten filament as the emission source; the X-ray ion valence energy spectrum (XPS) of each element in the monomers and composite catalysts was measured by an ESCALAB 250Xi vacuum electron spectrometer; a fluorescence photometer (FLUOROMAX-4) was used to measure the photoluminescence spectrum (PL) of each catalytic material at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm; the light-sensitive visible spectrum (UV-vis) of each catalyst from the ultraviolet to near infrared region was obtained using a spectrometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu) with barium sulfate as a reference electrode; the crystal state (XRD) of each catalytic material was measured using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Smartlab) under the conditions of 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu Kα radiation; the BET analysis (specific surface area and pore size distribution) of each catalytic substance was performed at 77 K with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller equation, the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method and an ASAP 2020 M physical adsorption and desorption instrument supported by liquid nitrogen and argon; a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope was used to detect the high and low magnification transmission (TEM and HRTEM) images of the composite material. The electrochemical data were measured with the support of an electrochemical workstation (VersaStat4-400). The operation process was as follows:
5 mg of each catalytic material was used as the solute, and 3 ml of ethanol was used as the solvent. The solution was ultrasonicated for 3 h. With the aid of a liquid gun, 30 μL of the prepared solution was uniformly spread on ITO (conductive glass, 1.1 × 2.5 cm2, ultrasonically treated with ethanol and deionized water in advance), and the smear range was about 1 cm2. Then, the glass was placed in an oven at 40 °C for 3 h so that the catalyst and the ITO achieved full fixing and contact. Before the test, the ITO was immersed in 0.2 M Na2SO4 (support solution) for 30 minutes; then, using the three-hole electrode of the reference electrode (saturated calomel electrode), the counter electrode (platinum electrode) and the detection electrode in the dark state, the voltammetric characteristic curve (LSV) of the each catalytic material was tested under a 300 W Xe lamp (with a fixed lamp source light-on cycle) equipped with a 420 nm cutoff filter as the light source, and the I–T (photocurrent response intensity) of the each catalytic material was investigated. The fixed bias values were all open circuit voltages.
2.3. Catalytic activity detection process
The performance of the various catalyst materials was tested in a nine-channel PCX50B Discover instrument with a 5 W LED lamp. A traditional hydrogen evolution solution in a hydrogen production container (65 ml) containing 12 mg of catalytic material, 20 mg of sensitizing dye eosin (EY) and 30 ml of TEOA (electronic sacrificial agent, v/v = 10%) was ultrasonically stirred into a homogeneous system, and the gas contained in the hydrogen production bottle was completely replaced with high-purity N2 until a state was reached where no other gas was present. The concentration of hydrogen produced was detected by gas chromatography (SP-2100) using N2 as a carrier.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and appearance analysis
In order to accurately analyze the phase transitions and crystal structures of the various catalytic materials, XRD patterns were used to describe them. Fig. 1a shows the radiation patterns of the different types of catalysts; the CuNi2S4 pattern is present in four distinct peaks (31.4°, 38.2°, 50.1°, 55.1°). According to JCPDS card no. 24-0334, these peaks correspond to the (311), (400), (511), and (440) crystal planes in the card; overall, the high peaks in the spectrum all belong to CuNi2S4, which indicates that the substance had good crystallinity and that the purity was also very high. The intensity of the peaks is related to the crystal strength of the material. The blue spectrum belongs to the CoWO4 material, and its diffraction peaks at 15.58°, 18.98°, 30.63°, 36.30°, 41.28°, 53.96°, 61.80°, and 65.08° correspond to the (010), (001), (−111), (200), (−201), (−202), (−311), and (−231) planes of JCPDS card no. 15-0867, respectively. Other small, insignificant peaks also belong to JCPDS card no. 15-0867, which proves the excellent crystal strength of the monomer catalyst. From the spectrum of the binary catalytic material, it can be seen that in the heterostructure composed of CoWO4/CuNi2S4, the characteristic peaks of the CoWO4 material with low content were also well reflected, and the positions of the characteristic peaks belonging to the two monomer substances did not change. This indicates that CoWO4 fixed in situ on CuNi2S4 did not affect the structure of CuNi2S4. The weakened diffraction peak of CoWO4 in the composite compared with the monomer is related to the dispersal of the agglomeration phenomenon by heterojunction. Fig. 1b shows the changes in the peak intensity of the composites with different CoWO4 contents. With increasing CoWO4 content, the peak intensity also increased, and the diffraction peaks belonging to the CuNi2S4 material also showed an increased trend under the conditions of increased CoWO4 occupancy. This shows that in the course of the secondary hydrothermal loading of CoWO4 on CuNi2S4, the crystallinity of CuNi2S4 was further enhanced (SEM picture of the composite), and it had a positive correlation with the content of CoWO4. The obvious enhancement of the CuNi2S4 diffraction peak at 53° is due to the interaction between the positions of the diffraction peaks of CuNi2S4 and CoWO4. The changes in the spectrum of the composite catalysts with different proportions also indicate the successful synthesis of the composites.

The SEM images can better demonstrate the microscopic morphology of each catalytic material. As can be seen from Fig. 2a, the monomer catalyst CuNi2S4 consists of spheres composed of nano-flakes with a diameter of about 5 μm; pure CoWO4 shows serious agglomeration of small particles (Fig. 2b) that are aggregated into irregular shapes. The agglomeration greatly affected the specific surface area of the material and the number of active sites. This in turn restricted the catalytic capacity of the CoWO4 substance. After in situ deposition of CoWO4 on the surface of CuNi2S4 (Fig. 2c), it can be seen that the surface of CuNi2S4 was covered by CoWO4, and the CoWO4 material became small particles ranging in size from 100 to 300 nm. The dispersed agglomeration phenomenon has advantages in terms of increasing the surface area, etc. After the secondary hydrothermal attachment of CoWO4 to CuNi2S4, the shape of the CuNi2S4 nanosheets was thinner and more pronounced, and the crystallinity was also improved; this further shortened the transport path of photo-generated carriers and played a positive role in reducing the recombination rate of photoelectrons and holes.36

The microcrystalline structure of the composite catalyst was further explored through TEM images, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3a, it can be clearly seen that the dark-colored regular circle is CuNi2S4 catalyst, whose size and shape are consistent with the scanning results; the light-colored substance that appears on the edge surface of CuNi2S4 with a size of about 200 nm was attributed to CoWO4 catalyst. It can be clearly seen that the in situ combination of the two monomer catalysts disrupts the severe agglomeration phenomenon that occurred in CoWO4; this improved the specific surface area of the material and had a positive effect on the catalytic performance, which also confirmed the successful synthesis of the composite catalyst. The lattice fringes are shown in Fig. 3b (high-power projection); they were attributed to the (511) and (400) crystal planes of the CuNi2S4 material (0.185 and 0.239 nm) and the (200) and (−111) crystal planes of the CoWO4 catalyst (0.247 and 0.292 nm) in the XRD pattern, respectively. Importantly, the clear lattice fringes in HRTEM indicate that the two monomers form a compact interface, which is conducive to the transfer and utilization of carriers between substances. Fig. 3c–i show selected regions of the composite catalyst element map and the distribution of each contained element. It can be clearly seen that the distribution of each element was uniform, and the contact between the monomer catalysts was very close. Combined with Fig. 3j, this offers more powerful proof of the successful synthesis of the composite catalyst.

In order to further confirm the composition and chemical state of each element in the monomers and composite catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, Fig. 4) were obtained. Fig. 4a shows a full-scan spectrum of the catalyst. The elements contained in the monomers and composite catalyst are present in the spectrum, which indicates the successful synthesis of the catalytic material. Fig. 4b shows the XPS diffraction peaks of Cu. The characteristic peaks at 931.65, 933.13, 951.87, and 952.92 eV belong to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. It has been shown that Cu element presents +1 valence (931.65 and 951.87 eV) and +2 valence (933.13 and 952.92 eV) in CuNi2S4;37 the peaks of Ni element (Fig. 4c) at 854.7 and 861.2 eV are Ni 2p3/2 characteristic peaks and satellite peaks, while the peaks at 872.1 and 879.1 eV are characteristic peaks and satellite peaks of Ni 2p1/2.38 The diffraction pattern of the S element in CuNi2S4 showed four distinct peaks (Fig. 4d), which belong to S 2p3/2, S 2p1/2, bridge S22− and top S2−, respectively, proving the existence of negative divalent S.39Fig. 4e shows a high-resolution scan image of Co 2p. The four diffraction peaks at 781.3, 797.1, 786.3, and 802.8 eV belong to Co 2p1/2, Co 2p3/2 and the two corresponding satellite peaks;40 the two characteristic peaks of element W in CoWO4 were located at binding energies of 35.6 eV (4f7/2) and 37.8 eV (4f5/2), respectively;30 and a large hump presented by O 1s contains O–W (530.23 eV), O–Co (531.26 eV) and O–H (532.12 eV) bonds in the CoWO4 material,29 which proves the existence of CoWO4 in the composite catalyst. In order to prove the electron transfer of the two monomer materials after forming a heterogeneous interface with each other, an XPS scan spectrum of the monomer CuNi2S4 was acquired. As can be seen from Fig. 4a–c, the binding energies of Cu, Ni and S elements contained in the composite materials tended to decrease; this indicates that CuNi2S4 underwent a charge transfer change in the composite catalyst, and the electron density increased.41,42 In related literature, the binding energies of the Co and W elements in pure CoWO4 are 781.040 eV and 35.145 eV at 2p1/2 and 4f7/2, respectively.43 Compared with the CoWO4/CuNi2S4 composite catalyst, there was a weakening trend; this proves that in the composite catalyst, the electrons in the CoWO4 material were transferred to CuNi2S4, and the charge density decreased.44 The combination of the two monomer materials inhibited the recombination of electrons and holes, promoted the transfer of electrons, and improved the catalytic performance.

3.2. Optical performance and exposed area
As is known, the number of photo-generated carriers is key to improve the amount of hydrogen evolution, and the generation of carriers is related to the light-collecting performance of the catalytic material. Here, the detection results of the light-induced intensity of each catalyst are shown in Fig. 5a, which indicates the intensity of the diffuse reflection spectra of the various materials. The pure CoWO4 material had a strong light response in the ultraviolet region, and the absorption edge appeared at about 420 nm. The light response in the visible light range was not strong, which is consistent with the catalytic ability of this material. The orientation of the CoO6 octahedra contained in CoWO4 determines its optical ability. The absorption edge at 500–650 nm depends on the transition of photoelectrons from the O-2p orbital and Cu-3d orbital to the W-5d orbital during the catalytic process. The slight response band at 700–800 nm is related to the d–d orbital splitting caused by the CoO6 octahedron.45 The CuNi2S4 monomer material had a slight absorption edge at 380 nm; however, it showed strong photosensitivity in the entire spectrum, so its band gap was narrow. When CoWO4 and CuNi2S4 were combined, the light response intensity trend of the composite catalyst was similar to that of the CuNi2S4 monomer material; this indicates that the surface contact between CoWO4 and CuNi2S4 is good. With increasing amount of CoWO4, the absorption edge at 380 nm was significantly reduced, and the absorption intensity in the visible area was also significantly enhanced, indicating that the use of light was further improved; when the load was 12%, the catalyst had the best ability to sense light. When the load was too large, the agglomeration of CoWO4 reoccurred, which is not conducive to light sensing. Using the functional differential equation (Kubelka–Munk) αhv = (hv − Eg)n, the band gaps (Eg) of the two monomer catalytic materials were estimated (v is the frequency of absorbed light, n = 1/2 or n = 2, α is the absorbance, A is a constant value, and h is the Planck constant).46 From Fig. 5b, the Eg values of CoWO4 and CuNi2S4 were 2.68 eV and 2.46 eV, respectively, which is consistent with a previous report.47 It can be seen from the graph in Fig. 5b that the addition of CoWO4 caused the graph to expand in the direction of smaller values. This shows a reducing effect on the band gap. A small band gap width and high light sensing ability exert very positive effects on the generation and transfer of photo-generated carriers. This has a great relationship with the heterostructures formed on the surface between the two monomer catalysts.

In order to further detect the photosensitivity of each catalytic material, the surface area and pore distribution of the material were detected by nitrogen adsorption desorption (BET). The results are shown in Fig. 6. From the BET spectrum in the left figure, it can be found that there were consistent isothermal temperature lines (type III, Brunauer–Deming–Deming–Teller classification) and hysteresis loops (H3, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry classification) for the various catalysts; type III isotherms indicate weak interactions between substances, and the H3 hysteresis loop was due to the existence of slit holes formed by particles in the catalyst, so the various materials have a certain adsorption capacity in a high pressure (P/P0 > 0.6) environment. The structural surfaces of the two monomer catalytic materials were very small. With increasing CoWO4 occupancy, the specific surface area increased first and then decreased. When the amount of CoWO4 was 12%, the BET data was as high as 22.92 m2 g−1. The pure CoWO4 material showed serious aggregation; when the two monomer materials were compounded by the secondary hydrothermal method, the original agglomeration phenomenon of CoWO4 was disrupted, small, irregular particles were uniformly loaded on the surface of CuNi2S4, and the nanosheets of CuNi2S4 were more obvious after the secondary hydrothermal process (SEM characterization). This is an important reason for the significant increase of the specific surface area of the composite catalyst. This increase is conducive to improvement of the photosensitivity of the catalyst and the adsorption capacity of the sensitizing dye in the catalytic system and promotes the catalytic process. The related data and distributions (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method) of the pore volume and pore size of each catalytic material are shown in Fig. 6b and in Table 1. The results show that the performance of the composite materials (22.69 nm, 0.08 cm3 g−1) was better than those of the monocatalytic materials (12.25 nm, 0.02 cm3 g−1 and 14.60 nm, 0.013 cm3 g−1). This strongly proves the catalytic advantages brought about by the combination of the two monomer materials. The heterostructure between the monomer catalysts plays a key role in improving the hydrogen evolution capacity of the composite.

3.3. Catalytic hydrogen evolution detection

3.3.1. Optimization of conditions for the catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. 
During the process of synthesizing the composite catalytic material, the weight ratio between the two monomers and the pH of the added sacrificial agent determined the hydrogen production activity of the system. Therefore, these two major influencing factors were optimized. The data are shown in Fig. 7a and b; with increasing loading of CoWO4 in CuNi2S4, the change trend of the performance of the composite catalytic materials was consistent with the change trend of the BET data and the light-induced intensity, where both increased first and then decreased as the CoWO4 load increased. This shows that a large specific surface area can adsorb more sensitizing dyes and expose more active sites, and the strong light-sensing ability promoted the generation of photoelectrons, which are all key factors that promote the improvement of catalyst performance. Also, for the combination of CoWO4 and CuNi2S4, due to the clever surface adhesion between the two, the resulting heterojunction interface had a positive effect on the generation and transport of photoelectrons and inhibited the recombination of electrons and holes, which further promoted the generation of hydrogen. When the load of CoWO4 was too large, it severely masked the active sites of the CuNi2S4 main catalyst and further reduced the activity of the composite. It can be seen that when the loading was 12%, the hydrogen evolution amount was as high as 3754.3 μmol g−1 h−1; this was the optimal ratio. The acidity and alkalinity of the sacrificial agent affect the existence of TEOA. As the acidity increases, TEOA is gradually protonated, which seriously affects the role of the sacrificial agent as an electron donor in the catalytic process. In an environment of increased alkalinity, the H+ was greatly consumed, and the thermodynamic evolution of H2 was affected. When TEOA acted as an electronic sacrificial agent, the optimization process of the solution pH was necessary. From Fig. 7b, it can be concluded that this system had the best catalytic activity at pH 10. The low activity exhibited by the catalytic materials in an overly basic or overly acidic environment can be attributed to the above reasons. In order to highlight the promotion effect of the addition of CoWO4 to CuNi2S4, the respective hydrogen evolution amounts of the various catalytic materials are shown in Fig. 7c. The activity of CoWO4 is almost zero, which is consistent with the position of the valence band of the substance. The position of the conduction band (greater than 0 eV NHE) is higher than that of normal hydrogen evolution (0 eV NHE); therefore, the material cannot be excited under light. The catalytic activity of the pure CuNi2S4 material under light excitation for 5 hours was 603.5 μmol g−1 h−1. The low hydrogen production capacity was consistent with the number of photo-generated electrons (electrochemistry) and the high recombination rate of photo-carriers and holes (fluorescence). The hydrogen evolution of the composite material showed excellent activity of 3754.3 μmol g−1 h−1 under the same conditions, which is more than 6 times that of the CuNi2S4 monomer. The load of CoWO4 on the surface of CuNi2S4 can produce an effective heterogeneous interface between the two species. This interface structure plays a positive role in the transport of photoelectrons and the suppression of electrons and holes; this optimizes the hydrogen evolution.

The activity of the system was also affected by the amounts of dye and catalytic material added, as shown in Fig. 7d and e. Increasing the amount of Eosin Y led to a directly proportional increase in the activity of the system, which indicates that Eosin Y can promote the progress of the catalytic process; addition of a small amount was insufficient to enhance the active sites of the catalytic material, and as the dosage continued to increase, the catalytic ability showed a tendency to decrease. This phenomenon indicated that the active site of the catalyst was covered by a large number of dye molecules, which weakened its catalytic ability. The optimal dosage was 20 mg; therefore, the amount of Eosin Y was related to the number of active sites of the catalyst and affected the transfer rate of the electron channels formed between EY and the catalyst. The effect of the amount of catalyst was also explored. This effect on the system was the opposite of the abovementioned effect of Eosin Y. The deficiency of the amount of catalyst was in excess relative to Eosin Y. Occupation of the active sites by the EY caused much deprivation of light, and the inhibited catalytic activity with increasing amount of catalyst was consistent with the effect of the insufficient amount of Eosin Y. The idle active sites did not effectively transport the dye electrons.


3.3.2. Persistence of catalyst performance. 
Cycling tests on catalytic systems are the most direct method to verify the stability of the catalyst. After the first 5 hours of the hydrogen evolution process, the gas in the system was fully replaced with pure N2, and a second 5-hour hydrogen production experiment was directly performed without adding any substances. From Fig. 8a, it can be concluded that the catalytic activity dropped sharply from 3754.3 μmol g−1 h−1 to 2825.6 μmol g−1 h−1. When the appropriate amount of Eosin Y was added to the system before the third cycle test started, the amount of hydrogen produced increased slightly; however, compared to the first cycle, it was still lower. This may be caused by the excessive amount of added dye; in the fourth experimental process without additional dye, the value decreased again. Based on the data in the above experiments (1. during 5 hours of hydrogen evolution of the materials, the amount of increase per hour gradually decreased; 2. without the addition of dye after each cycle of experiments, the amount of hydrogen generated declined sharply; 3. after adding an appropriate amount of dye to the system, the catalytic ability rose), it was concluded that the key factor affecting the amount of hydrogen generated was the dye; the dye had the disadvantage of being easily degraded under long-term light irradiation, and the presence of dye would absorb light to a certain extent and further affect the light receiving rate of the catalyst and the performance of the system. The crystal structure of the catalytic material after the catalytic process was studied again. The position of the peaks and the structure of the material did not change after the catalysis. The decrease in peak strength was related to the small amount of dye adsorbed on the catalyst surface, which proves the high stability of the catalyst.

3.4. Electrical performance and fluorescence test
The intensity of the photocurrent generated under excitation conditions can directly reflect the number of photoelectrons generated by various catalytic materials; it is also an indirect manifestation of the catalytic ability of a substance, which further indicates the efficiency of separation and transport of carriers and holes. Fig. 9 shows the detection of the catalytic performance of various catalytic substances. Fig. 9a (transient photocurrent response, I–T) reflects the different current densities of various catalysts under the conditions of the same light source excitation and several switching cycles. It was concluded that the conductive glass (ITO) is only a tool to assist in detecting the current response strength of the catalytic material. It did not have the ability to generate current. After each catalytic material was added to ITO, the current strength was detected immediately; the current responses of the two monomer catalytic substances were the poorest. After the composite catalytic substances were formed by the addition of different amounts of CoWO4, the respective current density significantly improved. The current density of the best-performing compound (CW/CNS-12%) increased by more than five times that of the catalytic monomer CuNi2S4, which corresponds to their respective hydrogen evolution capabilities. This phenomenon indicates that after the interaction between CoWO4 and CuNi2S4, there was a clear promotion effect on the separation efficiency of electrons and holes. The heterogeneous interface formed by the combination of two monomer materials also had a significant inhibitory effect on the recombination of electrons and holes. The existence of a heterojunction increased the current density and also accelerated the generation of photo-generated carriers.48 After several cycles, the current intensities of the various catalytic materials did not decrease, which also proves that the catalysts had better stability. Fig. 9b shows another method to verify the current intensity of each catalyst (volt–ampere characteristic curve, LSV). Under the same voltage intensity, the composite catalytic material exhibited the highest density cathode current (the power to reduce H2O to H2) and the lowest overpotential; the cathode current intensities of the two monomers were extremely small, which reflects their weak hydrogen evolution. The composite catalyst showed strong current density due to the good coordination between the two monomer catalysts of CoWO4 and CuNi2S4. The heterogeneous interface formed in the composite catalyst shields the recombination of the electrons and holes of the monomer material; therefore, the overpotential was effectively reduced, the carrier generation and transfer rate improved, and the low overcharge promoted the hydrogen evolution process of the catalytic system.49

Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) is a direct technique for detecting the intensity changes of generated carriers by the catalyst between transfer and quenching; the fluorescence peak is generated due to the composite properties of the charge and hole of the catalyst. Therefore, a low photoluminescence intensity represents excellent charge separation and transfer rate of the catalyst and its catalytic ability to inhibit electron–hole recombination. As a result, the fluorescence peak intensity of each catalyst was measured, and it was proven that the heterostructure existing between CoWO4/CuNi2S4 promoted the interface charge transfer. This can be seen in Fig. 10. When the excitation wavelength was 480 nm, all the catalytic materials showed the strongest emission peak height at about 538 nm, and the pure EY, CoWO4 and CuNi2S4 substances had strong peak heights; this was consistent with the high electron–hole recombination rate. When the CoWO4 catalyst was introduced on the surface of the CuNi2S4 material, the fluorescence peaks of the various composite materials significantly weakened. This showed that the composite catalytic material can effectively promote the generation of photoelectrons and also plays a positive role in inhibiting the recombination of electrons and holes and accelerating the transfer and transport of photoelectrons. The heterogeneous interface formed by the combination of two monomers played a key role in further promoting the hydrogen evolution capacity of the catalyst.50 As the load of CoWO4 continued to increase, the intensity of the fluorescence peak increased again, which indicated that the presence of excess CoWO4 would form new electron–hole recombination centers. CW/CNS-12% had the lowest peak intensity. Therefore, more electrons and holes effectively participated in the oxidation and reduction process, which corresponded to its high catalytic activity and was consistent with electrochemical data. In order to better confirm the effects of the heterostructure formed by CoWO4 and CuNi2S4 on the charge transfer dynamics, the transient fluorescence emission spectra (TRPL) of various catalytic substances were also tested. Because PL is the most important method to explain the separation of electrons and holes, transient fluorescence is effective to demonstrate the dynamic transfer of charges. The lifetime distributions of the various catalytic materials are shown in Table 2. As a function of time, the lifetime decay curves of the various catalytic materials were fitted by the following formula:51  where I is the normalized fluorescence emission intensity, Bi is the amplitude (pre-exponential factor), t is the time after the pulsed laser excitation, and τi is the PL decay time of the individual components.

The average fluorescence lifetime is obtained as the key parameter by the following formula:52  where 〈τ〉 is the average fluorescence lifetime of each tested sample, Bi is the amplitude (pre-exponential factor, proportion of corresponding components), and τi is the PL decay time of the individual components.

Table 2 shows the long and short lifetimes of the various types of catalytic materials and the percentages of the contents of their various components; it can also be found from this table that the addition of CoWO4 decreased the long and short lifetimes of CuNi2S4 from 4.123 and 0.315 ns to 1.692 and 0.233 ns, respectively. The reduced values indicate that a certain transfer of charge energy occurred between the materials;53 the transfer of electrons from CoWO4 to CuNi2S4 and the addition of CoWO4 accelerated the charge transfer and utilization rate, and the average lifetime of the composite was 0.241 ns, which is shorter than those of the CoWO4 and CuNi2S4 monomers (0.355 and 0.284 ns, respectively). The shortened lifetime is due to the fact that CoWO4 provided non-radiative energy transfer for charge transfer to CuNi2S4, which resulted in quenching of the fluorescence; this further proves that the electrons transferred from CoWO4 to CuNi2S4 and the holes of CuNi2S4 were recombined, and the heterostructure formed by the composite material had a significant inhibitory effect on the recombination of the electrons and holes of the monomer substances.
3.5. Mechanism of the hydrogen evolution system
Based on the various characteristics of the excellent catalytic performance of the composite material, the enhancing effect of the heterostructure formed by the combination of the two monomer catalysts in the catalytic system was speculated, and the hydrogen evolution process is shown in Fig. 11. First, based on the calculation of the theoretical formula (Mulligan's electronegativity formula), the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions of the two monomer catalysts were estimated:54ECB = χ − Ee − 0.5EgEVB = ECB + Egχ is the absolute electronegativity of the various materials (the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the atoms contained in the material); Ee is the energy value contained by the hydrogen ion radical; and Eg is the forbidden bandwidth. The Eg values of CoWO4 and CuNi2S4 are 2.68 and 2.46 eV (vs. NHE) from the UV-vis bandgap tangent diagram.
 Fig. 11  Schematic of the direct Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. 
Based on the ESI,† the conduction and valence bands of CoWO4 were 0.44 and 3.12 eV and those of CuNi2S4 were −0.35 and 2.11 eV (vs. NHE), respectively. Under the excitation of a light source, EY dye, CoWO4 and CuNi2S4 all can generate photoelectrons; the two catalysts were excited by light to generate electrons that were transferred to the conduction bands and holes in the valence bands. After EY was stimulated by light, it formed an unstable EY1* state, which became EY3* through ISC (system transition) and formed the EY˙− state under the action of the electronic sacrificial solution (TEOA). Due to the extremely high HOMO potential of the EY dye (−5.60 eV) and the large specific surface area and multiple active sites of the composite catalytic material,53 EY effectively adsorbed on the catalyst surface, transferred its own electrons to the catalyst, and finally returned to the original state (EY). The electrons are in the conduction bands of CoWO4 and CuNi2S4 because the conduction band of CoWO4 (0.44 eV) is greater than the reduction potential of standard hydrogen (0 eV vs. NHE); however, the composite catalyst had the best hydrogen evolution performance. It was shown that the photoelectron did not transfer from the conduction band of CuNi2S4 to the conduction band of CoWO4; therefore, the charge transferred in a Z-scheme heterojunction mode.30 The Coulomb forces existing between the two monomer substances accelerated the recombination of electrons (CB of CoWO4) and holes (VB of CuNi2S4) and then effectively inhibited the recombination of the electron–hole pairs of the monomer substances (Fig. 4 shows the flow of electrons); thus, efficient retention of useful holes (VB of CoWO4) and electrons (CB of CuNi2S4) occurred. The electrons in the CuNi2S4 conduction band were efficiently used in the process of reducing H+ to generate H2O in the system. The holes of CoWO4 were effectively reduced by TEOA, which became TEOA+ themselves.55 This unique electron transfer method enhanced the redox capacity of the composite. In addition to improving the effective charge separation, it also provided a strong driving force for the hydrogen evolution reaction.
4. Conclusions
It can be concluded that two monomer catalytic materials, CoWO4 and CuNi2S4, were compounded through a simple hydrothermal process. A composite material with a Z-type heterostructure was successfully constructed as a catalytic hydrogen evolution system. Under the same catalytic reaction conditions, the CW/CNS-12% composite material showed excellent catalytic ability. The amount of hydrogen evolution reached 40 (CoWO4) and 6 (CuNi2S4) times those of the two monomer substances, respectively. This excellent hydrogen-generating ability is related to the Z-type heterostructure that exists in the composite materials. In addition to the excellent promotion effect on the photoresponse ability of the catalyst and the amount of carriers generated, the heterostructure showed efficient transmission and utilization of charges, which is key to effectively inhibit the recombination of photoelectrons and holes. In addition, a series of characterizations, such as time-resolved fluorescence decay and transient photocurrent density, proved the existence of Z-type heterointerfaces and provided clearer evidence for the hydrogen production mechanism of the catalytic system. The structures of the materials after the experiment also illustrated the high stability of the catalysts and highlighted the key role of the construction of heterogeneous interfaces to improve catalytic performance.
