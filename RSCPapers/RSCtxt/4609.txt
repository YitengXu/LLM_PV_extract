    , Accepted 1st December 2020First published on 7th December 2020AbstractWe describe a two-step, all solution process for converting lead selenide thin films into methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite material. PbSe was deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), and treated with polyiodide solution to form lead iodide. The solvent used was mixtures of isopropanol and water at different ratios. Conversion parameters, namely solvent ratio, potassium iodide (KI) concentration, iodine (I2) concentration and conversion temperature were optimized. A second conversion step, from PbI2 to MAPbI3, was carried out by treating the films with a solution of methylammonium iodide (MAI) dissolved in isopropanol. Different morphologies of MAPbI3 were achieved by converting PbI2 films with different morphologies, and also by converting PbI2 films using solutions of variable MAI concentration. Effect of grain size on UV-Vis light absorption and photoluminescence (PL) is discussed: while absorption was found to be lower for the films with smaller grain size, PL was higher, suggesting less non-radiative recombination traps in films containing smaller grain perovskites.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskite solar cells have been the centre of attention of many research studies in the past two decades due to their excellent optical properties, notably long charge carrier diffusion length (>1 μm), high open circuit voltage (VOC ≈ 1.3 V)1 and the extraordinary absorption coefficient of 1.5 × 104 cm−1 for methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3),2 which is the most studied perovskite. These properties contribute to perovskite high power conversion efficiency (PCE), up to 25.5%.3 Currently, the production of MAPbI3 typically consists of two stages:4–7 (i) deposition of PbI2 particles on a substrate usually comprising a glass slide coated with a conductive transparent oxide electrode (FTO or ITO) thin film, onto which a layer of titanium oxide is deposited which acts as a hole blocking layer and a scaffold for PbI2 film. (ii) The PbI2 film is converted to MAPbI3 using methylammonium iodide in solution or in vapor form.6–8 Burschka et al. previously reported on the effect of the production process on the morphology and photovoltaic properties of the resultant perovskite.9 Despite their promising performance, utilization of perovskite based solar cells is hampered due to severe degradation of the perovskite materials.10–12 Studies on the effect of synthesis and annealing temperature on a methylammonium–formamidinium (MA+:FA+) mix lead iodide perovskite showed that annealing causes the sublimation of organic cations, resulting in the formation of PbI2, and the difference in thermal activity of MA+ and FA+ can lead to strain inside the crystalline structure.13 Low temperature annealing did not induce crystallization and high temperature annealing resulted in an undesired transition in the crystal structure.14 Furthermore, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are meant to work under illumination by the sun, and thus elevated temperatures are expected in the device, causing phase transition of perovskite materials and decomposition back to its inorganic precursor PbI2, affecting the performance of the solar cells.15,16 In addition to the temperature susceptibility, PSCs are reported to be light sensitive. Light-induced degradation of MAPbI3 typically results in the formation of PbI2 and organic species, which is further accelerated at increased temperatures. Melvin et al. showed that remnant PbI2 in the perovskite film can filter some of the harmful ultraviolet radiation, slowing the degradation.17 PbI2 is also considered to act as a hole-blocking layer18 (yet excess PbI2 may block both holes and electrons, effectively decreasing the efficiency of PSC19) and to have a passivating affect2,4,5,20 on the perovskite layer, leading to the assumption that some quantity of remnant PbI2 might be beneficial for PSCs. An alternate path proposed for the synthesis of perovskites is by conversion of lead chalcogenides. Chaudhuri and Acharya reported on the production of PbI2 by vapor iodination of PbS thin films.21 Their process consists of two-steps: chemical deposition of a PbS film, and an iodine vapor conversion to lead iodide. A similar process of vapor conversion was conducted by Pradhan et al. where vapor conversion of PbS nanoparticles into lead iodide was followed by spin-coating of methylammonium bromide (MABr), converting the particles to MAPbI3−xBrx.22 This process was applied for the conversion of nanoparticles using a combination of vapor phase and solution phase treatments, yet to the best of our knowledge an all-solution process for conversion of thin films into perovskites has not been reported in the literature. In this work, lead selenide (PbSe) films were deposited via chemical bath deposition (CBD). CBD is a cost-affective, well known method used to deposit thin films and nanoparticles of semiconductors23 and metals.24 Previous studies carried out in our group showed control over the morphology and optical properties of metal chalcogenide thin films deposited on single crystal substrates (gallium arsenide, silicon),25–29 and recently we were able to deposit PbSe on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) with fine control over its thickness and orientation.30 Here, we describe an all-solution conversion process, converting PbSe deposited on FTO into MAPbI3 films. We make use of polyiodide solutions to convert chemically deposited lead selenide films into PbI2 films with controlled morphologies. Calabrese and Kahn have shown that by dissolving I2 and KI in an aqueous solution, free polyiodide ions (I3−, I5−) and polyiodide complexes are formed.31 Hodes et al. proposed that there is a specific interaction between I3− ions and surfaces of various semiconductors which is beneficial for photovoltaic activity. They have shown that after chemically etching n-WSe2/Au diodes with polyiodide solution, open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Isc) increases, in a similar manner to the effect of a photoetching procedure. This interaction has been suggested to proceed in the form of intercalation of iodine, blocking of recombination sites by elemental iodine, or a donor–acceptor interaction.32 A new method of MAPbI3 production that utilizes the method of exposure to polyiodide solution used by Hodes was established earlier in our group,33 where chemically deposited PbS thin films were converted into high quality MAPbI3 films in a two-step conversion process. By controlling the conversion parameters (such as the solvent, temperature, reactant concentrations and conversion duration), control over the resultant perovskite film morphology was achieved. This gives solution conversion an advantage over conventional perovskite production techniques, such as spin coating, where control over the resultant film morphology is limited. Here, we optimize the method established on PbS film conversion to a PbSe conversion into MAPbI3, and we demonstrate control over the grain size of the perovskite film and the amount of remnant PbI2 material by controlling the conversion parameters.
Experimental
Sodium sulfite (Aldrich, analytical 99.95%), selenium powder (Aldrich, 100 mesh, analytical 95+%), lead acetate trihydrate (Aldrich, analytical 99+%), trisodium citrate (Aldrich, >99%), potassium hydroxide (Aldrich, analytical), potassium iodide (Aldrich, 99%), iodine (Aldrich, ≥99.8%) and methylammonium iodide (Lumtec, >99.5%, recrystallized 4 times) were used without further purification. FTO substrates were purchased from XOP GLASS (TEC 15, sheet resistance 12–14 Ω cm−2). Prior to deposition, FTO substrates were placed in a cleaning solution containing 1.92 M KOH dissolved in isopropanol at 70 °C for 1 hour. PbSe thin films were deposited from solutions with a final composition of 16.7 mM Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O, 33.3 mM KOH (pH 12.52), 90.6 mM C6H5Na3O7·2H2O and 50 mM Na2SeSO3. Before the addition of sodium selenosulfate, the solution was purged with pure N2 gas for 60 minutes to reduce the levels of dissolved O2 and CO2. After cleaning, the substrates were rinsed with water and transferred into the deposition solution, sodium selenosulfate was added, and the deposition was initiated. Depositions were carried out for 20 minutes at 55 °C. Conversion from PbSe to PbI2 was carried out in polyiodide solutions containing various concentrations of I2 and KI at various temperatures for 1 hour, where the solvent in the conversion solutions was a mixture of isopropanol and distilled water (DIW, obtained using a Millipore Direct Q3) in different ratios. Lastly, PbI2 films were submerged in solutions of MAI dissolved in isopropanol at 60 °C. MAI concentration and conversion duration varied as specified in the results section.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
The crystallographic phase and the orientation of the films were studied using a Panalytical Empyrean X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with a PIXcel linear detector and a monochromator on the diffracted beam. Data were collected in the 2θ/θ geometry using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) at 40 kV and 30 mA. Diffraction patterns were taken during 8 min in a 2θ range of 10–60° with a step size of ∼0.033°. Total integrated area under PbI2 and MAPbI3 characteristic peaks was calculated to assess the extent of conversion.
High resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM)
The morphology of the films was observed using a JEOL JSM-7400F field emission gun (FEG)-SEM, and by an FEI VERIOS XHR-460L FEG-SEM. Samples were imaged uncoated. The acceleration voltage was fixed at 3.5 kV. Film thickness was measured from cross-sections and surface topography was observed in plan-view.
Optical measurements
UV-vis light absorption spectra were recorded using a Cary5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) in the range 400–800 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out with a HORIBA Fluorolog®-3 in the range 680–850 nm using a 632 nm laser excitation source.
Results and discussion
First conversion step – from PbSe to PbI2
The morphology of the resulting PbI2 films was controlled by varying three parameters: DIW-to-isopropanol solvent ratio, polyiodide concentration and temperature.
DIW-to-isopropanol ratio
PbSe films were treated with polyiodide solutions of 175 mM KI and 76.3 mM I2 at 10 °C. First, conversion in a solution of 100% isopropanol was compared to that of 100% DIW solution. Already after 1 min of exposure it was visible that pure isopropanol conversion is far too aggressive, resulting in peeling of the film, as seen in Fig. 1a. On the other hand, conversion in pure DIW was much milder, and hardly converted the PbSe film (Fig. 1b). We correlate this with the fact that the polarity of water is twice that of isopropanol,34 which inhibits the polyiodide molecules from reacting with the film. In the presence of highly polar solvents, electron-rich atoms are reacting with the dipole of the solvent, destabilizing the excited state of the electrons.35 Stieger and Kelm36 have shown that increasing the polarity of the solvent increases the second-order rate of the reaction between [IrCl(CO)(P(C6H5)2)] and methyl iodide for the same reason. It is therefore assumed that upon increasing the polarity in this system, the iodide ions tend to react with each other, forming complexes which are less reactive towards the PbSe film. Subsequently, various mixtures of DIW and isopropanol were examined. We see that for 40% volume ratio of DIW the conversion is still too aggressive, resulting in cracks and peeling already after 1 minute of exposure (Fig. 1c). By comparing the ratio between the dominant XRD peaks, PbI2 (00.1) and PbSe (111), Fig. 1d shows that the conversion extent is highest in the case of 40% DIW solution, followed by 60%, and since 40% solution conversion is too aggressive all following conversions described below were carried out in a 60% DIW solution.

Polyiodide concentration
Weight ratio between KI and I2 was kept constant at 3:2 and KI concentration was gradually increased from 150 to 690 mM (65 to 301 mM I2, respectively). The resultant films were separated into four visibly distinct groups, as shown in Fig. 2. At very low concentrations, conversion resulted in large PbI2 grains, which did not form a homogeneous film. Increasing to an intermediate concentration allowed for uniform films, along with decreasing grain size. We attribute this to a higher density of conversion sites, which restricts the growth of large PbI2 grains. Upon further increasing the concentration, further decrease in grain size was expected; nevertheless, it was observed that, the grains developed a large, flat morphology, resulting in denser, compact PbI2 films. Above a certain threshold of 690 mM KI and 301 mM I2, increasing the polyiodide concentration resulted in complete conversion to PbI2 with almost no remnant PbSe, and the fully converted film grains began to detach from the substrate. We therefore propose that two processes take place when exposing our films to polyiodide solutions: the chemical conversion reaction discussed above, and transport of the solution into the film since at increased concentrations, penetration into the film is enhanced. At lower concentrations, the controlled formation of the PbI2 film is effectively sealing the surface, preventing further penetration into the film. Because the research goal was to reproducibly prepare perovskite films in a controlled manner, we proceeded to work under conditions that produced uniform films. PbI2 films resulting from intermediate concentrations exhibited a “non-compact” morphology while films converted using high concentration solutions were denoted “compact PbI2 films”. Compact PbI2 films are (00.1) textured and show intense diffraction peaks that completely conceal the peaks from FTO and PbSe (Fig. 2i). This correlates with previous studies,33 where PbI2 films converted from PbS films showed the same texture along the c-axis. The non-compact PbI2 film diffractogram reveals that the PbI2 grains are not oriented in any specific direction and are not fully covering the underlying PbSe film, resulting in many PbI2, PbSe and FTO peaks.

Temperature
In this part, compact PbI2 conversion was tested at 30, 20, 10, 5 and 0 °C (Fig. 3). Increased temperatures resulted in a thinner PbI2 film, leaving a notably thicker underlayer of PbSe. Hence, the reaction is faster, sealing the entire surface and preventing penetration into the PbSe film. For temperatures lower than 10 °C we observe peeling of parts of the film, leaving residual PbI2 alongside flat PbI2 grains. This strengthens the notion of a slower reaction between PbSe and the solution, enabling penetration of the solution into the film. Therefore, 10 °C was chosen as the treatment temperature for further research, due to higher conversion extent compared to higher temperatures, better reproducibility and improved adhesion to the substrate.

Second conversion step – from PbI2 to MAPbI3
The effect of three parameters on perovskite film morphology was examined: intermediate PbI2 film morphology, MAI concentration and initial PbSe deposition time. The temperature was set to 60 °C and the conversion duration was 1 hr for all subsequent conversions.
Intermediate PbI2 film morphology
Non-compact and compact PbI2 were converted to perovskite in a solution of 60 mM MAI in isopropanol. The resultant perovskite films were different both in terms of perovskite grain size and in terms of residual PbI2 (Fig. 4). In the case of non-compact PbI2, a large portion of the surface area is exposed, and therefore the conversion is more extensive, and the perovskite grains have more room to grow, while in the case of compact PbI2 conversion only the top surface was exposed to the MAI solution, resulting in more residual PbI2 and smaller perovskite grains. We note that in both cases the perovskite films were uniform and continuous.

MAI concentration
Compact PbI2 was converted using 20, 40, 50, 60 and 80 mM MAI solutions. The dependence of the conversion on MAI concentration was similar to the dependence of the first conversion on polyiodide concentration. When converting with low concentrations, PbI2 grains dissolved and redeposited as perovskite, resulting in large (∼3.2 μm), sporadic grains. Increasing the concentration seals-off the PbI2 surface, which resulted in smaller perovskite grains, about 1.2 μm in diameter. Fig. 5 shows that in fact all perovskite films contained two grain populations – small, uniformly spread grains that appear to follow the footprints of the compact PbI2 grains, and larger grains formed from partially dissolved PbI2 which is redeposited onto the film. 80 mM MAI conversion was not distinct from 60 mM in terms of grain size, probably because conversion using solutions >60 mM completely seals the PbI2 surface. Average grain size for each film was measured and presented in Fig. 5i.

Initial PbSe deposition time
In the procedure described here, PbSe acts as the lead source for the perovskite. It also acts as a scaffold onto which the perovskite is attached, and as a buffer between the FTO and the incipient layers. However, with a band gap of ∼0.3 eV, excess PbSe will absorb the radiation intended to be absorbed by the perovskite. With that in mind, we deposited PbSe for different durations to have different initial PbSe thicknesses for the conversion process. These films were then put through the same conversion procedure (compact PbI2, 60 mM MAI). All films converted from PbSe films deposited for under 20 minutes peeled off to some extent, due to penetration of the films by the polyiodide solution. PbSe films deposited for durations from 20 to 23 min did not peel after the conversion process, and cross-sections of perovskite films converted from these PbSe films are presented in Fig. 6. As expected, it is seen that the remnant PbSe film is thicker for the initially thicker films. No visible change is registered in the plan-view images (perovskite film converted from PbSe film deposited for 20 minutes is presented as an example in the inset of Fig. 6e). Therefore, the optimal PbSe deposition time for our needs (uniform perovskite layer with minimal thickness of residual PbSe) was 20 minutes. XRD results (Fig. 6e) confirmed that conversion from PbI2 to MAPbI3 was not complete, yet a distinct interface between PbI2 and MAPbI3 was not seen in SEM, so we can assume that the layer above the PbSe in the cross-section images is composed of a mixture of PbI2 and MAPbI3.

Light absorption and photoluminescence
In order to assess the effect of the perovskite film grain size on its optical properties, compact PbI2 films were converted to perovskite using various concentrations of MAI solutions (40–80 mM) which resulted in films of different perovskite grain size, and absorption, photoluminescence intensity and lifetime measurements were carried out. The results, as shown in Fig. 7a, show an absorption peak at ∼770 nm, which is attributed to the perovskite (in agreement with a band gap of 1.61 eV) and another peak at ∼590 nm, which is attributed to PbI2. As can be seen in the Fig. 5 cross-sectional images, the films vary in thickness – the film with the largest grains is also the thickest. When the grain size decreases so does the volume of the grains (less volume of absorbing material), therefore the results of the absorption analysis are as expected: for smaller grains, less absorption is observed. On the other hand, photoluminescence measurements show the opposite trend: decrease in grain size exhibits an increase in photoluminescence peak (Fig. 7b). This may indicate that the large grain perovskite film is self-quenching the excitons forming in the bulk of the grains,37 and that in fact the PL quantum efficiency of small grain films is higher, as is the case with other organic films.38 Transient PL measurements (Fig. 7c) exhibited faster decay for large-grain films compared to small-grain films. Such enhanced decay is usually indicative of higher densities of non-radiative recombination traps, yet further experimental clarification is required before solid conclusions can be drawn.39,40

Conclusions
We have presented a method to produce MAPbI3 perovskite films and control their morphology. The method comprised two solution conversion steps: from PbSe into PbI2, and subsequently from PbI2 into MAPbI3. We showed that by controlling the parameters of the first conversion step (i.e. solvent ratio, reactant concentration and conversion temperature) we can control the morphology of the intermediate PbI2 film, namely grain size and depth of penetration to the PbSe film. Subsequently, by converting different PbI2 films using various concentrations of MAI we can gain control over the grain size of the perovskite layer, and the thickness of the remnant PbI2 and PbSe layers. Optical measurements showed that by decreasing the grain size of the perovskite film one can increase the photoluminescence intensity and lifetime, which can benefit photovoltaic efficiency in future applications.
