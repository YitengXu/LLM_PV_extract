    , Accepted 26th June 2022First published on 27th June 2022AbstractTwo types of iron sulfide, namely highly crystalline pyrite (FeS2) and greigite (Fe3S4), were synthesized via a hot-injection method by changing the precursor ratios of iron to sulfur (Fe:S) from 1:6 to 1:12, and were employed in photo-Fenton catalytic reactions to degrade the organic dye Rhodamine B (RhB). The degradation efficiency of 10 mg L−1 RhB by Fe3S4 reached 99.0% in 22 minutes under sunlight irradiation, while a similar removal efficiency was realized by FeS2 in 35 minutes in photo-Fenton catalysis. By studying the stability and structural differences, we found that the surface states of iron sulfides were the main factors affecting the catalytic efficiency in the photo-Fenton reaction, and sunlight illumination was an auxiliary factor; both of them worked together to determine the degradation efficiency. This research on the factors affecting iron sulfide photocatalytic degradation provides new insights for finding better photo-Fenton catalysts.
Introduction
Due to the fast-growing economy, huge amounts of wastewater are produced by the chemical industry.1 Organic dye molecules are one type of wastewater pollutant, and their traditional and biological water treatments experience poor removal efficiencies due to their stable chemical structures, poor biodegradability, and high dispersibility in water.2 Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proposed to make use of the large numbers of reactive hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) that are produced in physical and chemical processes, such as light,3 ultrasound,4 and electrochemical processes,5 followed by the direct mineralization or decomposition of organic dyes with relatively large molecular masses ranging from hundreds to thousands of daltons.6 Among the various AOP methods, Fenton oxidation-generated hydroxyl radicals formed by chain reactions between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ferrous ion (Fe2+) in aqueous solution are able to oxidize various organic compounds.7 Examples of such reactions are listed in eqn (1)–(3) as follows: Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH− + ˙OH, k = 40–80 (L mol−1 s−1)(1) Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + ˙O2H + H+, k = 9.1 × 10−7 (L mol−1 s−1)(2) Fe3+ + ˙O2H → Fe2+ + O2 + H+, k = 0.33 − 2.1 × 106 (L mol−1 s−1)(3)
Fenton oxidation has many advantages such as feasible reaction conditions, cost-effectiveness, complete degradation, and relatively good selectivity.8 Unfortunately, the rate-limiting step of eqn (2) seriously affects the chain reactions, which leads to the obstacles of low oxidation activity and long-term degradation.9 Adding large amounts of Fe2+ to overcome these shortcomings will produce Fe(OH)3 sludge, resulting in severe secondary pollution, which makes the chemical oxygen demand (COD) exceed the standard.10 The solar-assisted photo-Fenton oxidation method not only has the advantages of the Fenton oxidation method but also involves easy reaction acceleration due to light irradiation. Illumination and Fe2+/Fe3+ have a synergistic effect on the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 (eqn (4)), and greatly enhance the oxidation activity.11 Oliveira et al.12 compared the performance of the Fenton and photo-Fenton processes in the treatment of industrial wastewater, and found that the solar-assisted photo-Fenton process was more efficient at removing high concentrations of COD and TOC, proving that the photo-Fenton process has better performance. However, the catalyst used in Oliveira's reactions was homogeneous, which possibly resulted in secondary pollutants, and the difficulty in separation was inevitable. Fe(OH)2+ + hv → Fe2+ + ˙OH(4)Heterogeneous iron catalysts could reduce the formation of the Fe(OH)3 slurry and have greater potential in practical industry.13 As heterogeneous catalysts, iron oxides including Fe2O3,14 FeOOH,15 Fe@Fe2O3,16 Fe3O4,17 iron oxychloride (FeOCl)18 and iron-bearing clay19 have received widespread attention in the removal of organic pollutants. However, the results showed that these catalytic activities were far from satisfactory, therefore iron sulfides gradually attracted attention due to their excellent performance.20 There are many methods of synthesizing iron sulfides, i.e., hydrothermal,21 vulcanization,22 solvothermal,23 hot injection,24etc. Among them, the hot injection method readily produces a high degree of supersaturation by quickly injecting excess precursors into a hot surfactant solution, thereby, rupturing nucleation by eliminating the excess free energy. This protocol could readily achieve monodisperse, highly crystalline nanocrystals, while the shielding effects provided by the combination of products surface and organic ligands were able to prevent products from being oxidized and aggregated.25 This method has shown that in the electro-Fenton system, Fe3S4/Fe7S8 was more conducive to the generation of hydroxyl radicals than Fe3O4 and Fe2O3, which had higher degradation efficiency.26 Among these iron sulfides, pyrite (FeS2) and greigite (Fe3S4) have attracted great attention in recent years as functional application materials with their similar excellent photocatalytic activity, such as narrow band gaps of 0.95 eV and 0.90 eV, a high absorption coefficient of 5 × 105 cm−1 (hν > 1.3 eV) and suitable minority carrier diffusion length.27 In these compounds, atoms of sulfur (S) were assumed to contain variable proportions of long and short-chain polysulfides that were linked with multiple valences of Fe-species. The S atoms carried part of the negative charges and thus could attract protons, which was the reason that FexSy manifested better catalytic performance than other transition metals. According to previous publications,28 organic dyes could be removed by the simultaneous adsorption and catalytic degradation of FeS2 crystals. In addition, it was also found that nanoparticles of FeS2 could obtain more hydroxyl radicals and degrade alachlor (C14H20ClNO2) through the Fe(II)/Fe(III) cycle mediated by superoxide.29 Experiments showed that under visible light irradiation, greigite (Fe3S4) could excite photogenerated charge carriers and transfer them to the surface, reducing surface Fe(III) to active Fe(II).30 Greigite and pyrite have similar chemical compositions and smaller band gaps, which make them respond to the wider solar spectrum from the ultraviolet to infrared region, and were expected to have good photocatalytic performance. However, it is difficult to synthesize pure-phase crystals of FeS2 and Fe3S4 in the same system due to the unique transformation mechanism in the synthesis of iron sulfide, which is to generate FeS first and then convert to different iron sulfides such as Fe7S8, Fe3S4, FeS2, etc. Due to the rare methods developed for the synthesis of iron sulfides in high-temperature solutions, understanding the catalytic performance of FeS2 and Fe3S4 has puzzled researchers for quite a long time. Hence, it is necessary to synthesize pure phases of FeS2 and Fe3S4, respectively, with fixed conditions and provide evidence for finding better photo-Fenton catalysts by studying their performances.
In this research, we developed a facile hot-injection strategy to synthesize highly crystalline nanoparticles, FeS2 and Fe3S4. In the experiments, sulfur−oleylamine was injected into the iron−oleylamine solution, with only the control of the ratio of iron to sulfur, i.e., the stoichiometry of Fe:S, pure phases of FeS2 and Fe3S4 were synthesized, respectively. By employing these nanoparticles as heterogeneous catalysts in the photo-Fenton reaction to degrade organic dye molecules of RhB under sunlight or in darkness, the catalytic efficiency and stability were demonstrated and the superior catalytic performance of Fe3S4 was validated. Mechanisms concerning the structures of FeS2 and Fe3S4 were characterized by various means, and the possible corresponding hypothesis was proposed.
Experimental
Materials
All reagents including iron(III) acetylacetonate (98%, Fe(acac)3), sulfur powder (99.5%, S), oleylamine (70%, OLA), toluene (99.8%), methanol (98%), hydrogen peroxide (30% w/w), rhodamine B (99%, RhB), hydrochloric acid (37% w/w) and sulfuric acid (98%) were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments.
Synthesis
In a typical synthesis, 1.0 mmol iron acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3) and 10.0 mL oleylamine (OLA) were added to a 25.0 mL three-necked flask. The mixture was heated to 100 °C under vacuum, and then the temperature was increased to 130 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was kept for 1.0 h under vigorous stirring to achieve a brown iron−OLA solution. Another portion of the solution consisting of 6.0 mmol sulfur and 6.0 mL OLA was prepared in a 50.0 mL flask and was ultrasonicated for 10.0 minutes, then transferred to an oil bath at 100 °C and stirred for 1.0 h to form a sulfur−OLA solution. The sulfur−OLA was then injected into the iron−OLA solution using a syringe. The stoichiometry of Fe:S was set at different ratios (Fe:S = 1:6–1:12) to obtain different compounds of iron sulfide. The temperature was increased quickly to 240 °C (within 10 min) and kept for 4.0 h. The reaction mixture was observed to turn dark and thick and yielded a colloidal dispersion of particles. After cooling to room temperature, the iron sulfide particles were centrifuged and purified with toluene and methanol three times before being dried at 60 °C under a vacuum drying oven. The iron sulfide particles were preserved in toluene for further characterization.
Characterizations
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on a Rigaku Dmax 2500 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation operating at 35 kV and 40 mA. Data were recorded within the 2θ range of 20–80° at a speed of 0.02°/2θ per step. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Jeol JEM-2100F) was employed to reveal the morphology of the synthesized samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on an ESCALAB MK II using Mg Kα as the excitation source. The binding energy of C 1s (284.8 eV) was used as a reference. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye solutions were recorded on a spectrophotometer (HITACHI, U-3900H), and the absorbance at λ ∼ 554 nm was used to measure the concentrations of dye molecules.
Photo-catalytic experiments
The catalytic activity tests were carried out in a 50.0 mL glass flask under sunlight. The initial solution of the 20.0 mg L−1 RhB solution was prepared and stored in the dark.20 Batches of tests were performed in a 50.0 mL glass flask containing RhB solution (40.0 mL, 10.0 mg L−1), iron sulfide catalyst (5.0 mg, 0.125 g L−1) and H2O2 (2.5 mmol L−1). The initial pH value of the solution was adjusted to 3.0 by using the 0.1 mol L−1 HCl. In order to conduct comparative experiments under dark conditions, the surface of the glass flask was covered with aluminum foil, and the RhB was degraded in a dark room. The solution was sampled at different durations, and the absorbance at 554 nm was measured with an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer and was converted to the RhB concentration Ct, which represents the concentration at an arbitrary time during the degradation. Plots of Ct/C0 (C0 was the initial concentration of RhB) as the ordinate and time (t) as the abscissa were constructed to obtain a time-resolved curve for RhB degradation, which was used to analyze the degradation kinetics. The dissolved ferrous ions and total iron ions were quantified by the 1,10-phenanthrolin method and analyzed at a maximum wavelength of 510 nm. The total iron ions were measured with the addition of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. The H2O2 concentration was quantified by a previous method with a UV-vis spectrophotometer at 454 nm. The reusability tests of catalysts were carried out as follows. First, sets of parallel experiments were carried out. After one cycle of catalysis, the obtained catalyst was recovered by mixing and centrifugation, then washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. The collected catalyst was dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 60 °C for subsequent use. Other cyclic experiments were performed in a similar way. In each cycle, the ratio of experimental reagents was kept consistent. All of the degradation data values were repeated independently at least three times to get trustable data.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The prepared iron sulfide samples were deposited on the surface of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and carbon paper, respectively, for electrochemical measurements. For the deposition on FTO, the amount of 12.0 mg iron sulfide samples along with 12.0 μL of Nafion (1.0 wt%) were ultrasonically dispersed in 1.2 mL of toluene to prepare catalyst ink. Subsequently, 40.0 μL colloidal suspensions were evenly drop-casted on the surface of the FTO electrode (1.0 × 1.0 cm) in triplicate. The samples were subjected to photocurrent-time dependence tests after vacuum-drying at 60 °C for 3.0 h. Nafion played a role in helping the cementation between iron sulfides and FTO. For the deposition on carbon paper, the only difference was that the colloidal suspension was prepared without Nafion. Every electrochemical measurement was evaluated via an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Chenhua) at room temperature. The saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode, and the counter electrode was a platinum wire. Nitrogen gas was introduced into the electrolyte for 3.0 h to eliminate the influence of oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were carried out in 0.5 M Na2SO4 at 0.0 V bias voltages across the working electrode using a 50 W LED light source with a 20.0 cm work distance from the light to the FTO working electrode. The irradiation period was 60 s for light and 60 s for dark in a one-cycle test. In order to characterize the hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 from 0.0 V to −1.0 V across the carbon paper working electrode under LED illumination. The stable curve was measured and graphed. Finally, the formula was unified as follows, and the potential was converted to versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential.E (V vs. RHE) = E (V vs. Hg/Hg2Cl2) + 0.2415 + 0.0591 pH
Results and discussion
Characterization
The synthetic product was used for the subsequent testing to characterize its composition and structure. Fig. 1 presents the XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples by varying the iron–sulfur molar ratios (1:6–1:12). When the stoichiometry of Fe:S was lower than 0.1 (Fe:S < 1:10), the obtained particles were confirmed as standard pyrite (FeS2, JCPDS Card No. 42-1340). All diffraction peaks of the synthesized nanoparticles at 2θ = 28.5°, 33.1°, 37.1°, 40.8°, 47.4° and 56.3° were ascribed to the (111), (200), (210), (211), (220) and (311) crystallographic planes without any other peaks (see Fig. 1, curve d), proving that the synthesized sample shared the high purity of the FeS2 phase. It is worth noting that the sharp diffraction peaks were obtained due to the high temperature of the synthesis, which suggested that the synthesized products were of high crystallinity. When Fe:S was set at 1:8, all the XRD diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 25.5°, 30.0°, 36.4°, 47.8° and 52.4° were assigned to the (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) crystallographic planes of standard greigite (Fe3S4, JCPDS Card No. 89-1998). The sharp XRD diffraction peaks implied the high crystallinity of Fe3S4. When the stoichiometry was set at Fe:S = 1:9, a mixture of the FeS2 and Fe3S4 were found in this synthesis batch. The XRD profile of this sample is shown in Fig. 1 curve c. The major diffraction peaks were attributed to FeS2, while some minor reflections were assigned to Fe3S4. With the use of less sulfur in the precursors while the stoichiometric ratio was Fe:S = 1:6, other diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ = 34.0°, 44.0° and 53.3° without regard to Fe3S4, which corresponded to the (203), (206), (220) planes of pyrrhotite (Fe7S8, JCPDS Card No. 24-0220). We also found that the reaction time was vital to the purity of the final products. With prolonged reaction time, sulfur was observed to be continuously evaporated into sulfur vapor, resulting in the decrement of the iron–sulfur molar ratio and the disappearance of the sulfur-rich environment, which would lead to the formation of sulfur-deficient products Fe1−xS. Hence, with the iron–sulfur molar ratio decreased from 1:6 to 1:8, the XRD patterns showed the weakened diffraction peaks of pyrrhotite (Fe7S8), while the diffraction peaks of greigite (Fe3S4) were enhanced.

In this hot-injection protocol Fe(acac)3 was used as the iron precursor, and OLA functioned as the solvent, reducing agent and surfactants to protect the final nanoparticles. More sulfur powder was required to prepare pyrite (FeS2) from Fe(acac)3 as compared to those precursors from a divalent iron source such as FeCl2, etc.31 In this synthesis, more use of sulfur would provide a wider range to synthesize iron sulfides (Fe7S8 → Fe3S4 → FeS2) and the sulfur-rich environment was found to be favorable for colloidal synthesis. On the condition that the stoichiometry was controlled at certain ratios, the product particles showed extremely high purity.27 Greigite (Fe3S4) and pyrite (FeS2) were obtained by simply changing the iron–sulfur molar dosages.
The prepared iron sulfides were subjected to TEM analysis for further characterization. Fig. 2a displays the TEM image of pyrite FeS2 showing cube-like particles with a relatively uniform size distribution of about 78.8 ± 13.0 nm by statistical evaluation. Fig. 2b exhibits the crystallite of FeS2, which showed a face-centered cubic NaCl-like structure viewed along {100}. Each iron atom was bound with six sulfur atoms to form an iron–sulfur octahedron. Fig. 2e shows the high-resolution TEM of the prepared FeS2 particles. It was found that the FeS2 particles possessed a highly exposed crystal plane without a hitch. The lattice fringes with a distance of ∼0.271 nm correspond to the (200) crystal plane of pyrite. The lattice spacing could also be confirmed by the highest intensity peak in the XRD pattern. Another lattice spacing of ∼0.241 nm corresponds to the (210) crystal plane of pyrite. For the Fe3S4 synthesized with the stoichiometry of F:S = 1:8, the TEM image is given in Fig. 2c, and the shape of Fe3S4 was completely different from FeS2. Crystallites of Fe3S4 were of the Fdm space group with a third rotation axis, therefore, the product crystallites were mostly hexagonal, and minorities had a thin plate shape.26 The structure caused Fe3S4 to have a higher specific surface area and thus more surface-active sites as compared to FeS2. The size distribution of Fe3S4 particles was about 92.8 ± 27.6 nm as confirmed by TEM images. Fig. 2d shows the crystal structure of Fe3S4 with a spinel-like structure. Two iron atoms in each unit cell were bound with six sulfur atoms, respectively, forming an iron–sulfur octahedron, and the remaining one iron atom was combined with four sulfur atoms to form an iron–sulfur tetrahedron. Different from the structurally stable FeS2 samples, Fe3S4 with the spinel structure has smaller iron–sulfur tetrahedral units, and ions are more easily transferred from the interior to the surface. Fig. 2f shows the high-resolution TEM of Fe3S4; the main crystal plane spacing was about 0.247 nm and 0.298 nm, corresponding to (400) and (311) crystal planes, consistent with the greigite XRD pattern (Fig. 1, curve b).

The surface chemical compositions and electronic states of iron sulfide samples were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that in the Fe 2p XPS spectrum of FeS2 and Fe3S4 shown in Fig. 3(a) and (c), the Fe 2p3/2 photoelectrons were located at a binding energy of about 707.0, 708.8, 710.0 and 712.0 eV, which were attributed to bulk Fe2+, surface Fe3+, surface Fe2+ and Fe(III)–S, respectively. Due to the oxidation when samples were exposed to air, two minor peaks at 710.9 and 714.1 eV were assigned to the Fe(III)–O and Fe(III)–SO42− species. Using peak deconvolution, the relative contents of the corresponding species were evaluated in Table 1, which showed percentages of each component according to their integrated areas. The relative contents of surface Fe were similar in both as-synthesized samples of FeS2 and Fe3S4; however, they were varied after 5 cycles of catalysis. The percentage of surface Fe2+ decreased (21.8% → 9.3%) in sample FeS2, while its relative content of surface Fe3+ was almost unchanged (16.2% → 16.1%). This meant that crystallites of FeS2 were over-oxidized and the recycled surface iron species were not improved by light. Since the content of Fe(III)–SO42− did not change distinctly (3.4% → 3.9%) while the content of Fe(III)–O increased (5.4% → 9.8%) from the fresh to the 5th use of the sample, the oxidized products of iron(II) were suggested to exist in the form of FeOOH or other iron oxides, and these coating layers would cover the surface of the catalyst and prevent further progress in the photo-Fenton catalysis.30 As seen from Table 1 the content of surface Fe3+ decreased (26.4% → 5.3%), while the surface Fe2+ increased (12.8% → 22.1%) in the Fe3S4 sample after 5 catalyzing cycles. At the same time, the bulk Fe2+ content decreased in the reaction (11.0% → 5.8%), demonstrating that some Fe2+ ions diffused to the surface area or the new formed Fe2+ ions were produced when the Fe3S4 nanoparticles were used as Fenton catalysts. However, the surface of the Fe3S4 nanoparticles was not damaged because the content of Fe(III)–O in Fe3S4 remained unchanged (20.9% → 21.0%). The contents of Fe(III)–S and Fe(III)–SO42− increased (23.8% → 29.0% and 5.1% → 16.8%), indicating that no iron oxide layers were generated in the photo-Fenton reaction. This result showed that the catalyst Fe3S4 had better recycling catalytic performance than FeS2 due to the greater presence of surface Fe2+ species, which were protected with Fe(III)–S and Fe(III)–SO42− after recycling. The high-resolution of the S 2p XPS spectra of FeS2 and Fe3S4 was demonstrated by five bands at 161.0, 162.5, 163.6, 164.5, and 168.5 eV, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (d), which correspond to surface S2−, bulk S2−, poly Sn2−, S0, and SO42−, respectively. After cycles of catalysis, the contents of surface S2− of FeS2 and Fe3S4 both decreased (11.6% → 5.2% and 31.4% → 22.4%), while the S0 and SO42− increased. Simultaneously, the content of poly Sn2− did not change significantly, which showed that the surface S2− of samples was excessively oxidized to generate S0 and SO42− with the progress of catalysis. However, after recycling, the relative content of bulk S2− in FeS2 remained unchanged (45.3% → 45.2%), while it was reduced in Fe3S4 (36.4% → 28.0%), indicating that in the photo-Fenton reaction the bulk S and Fe of Fe3S4 could move to the surface to participate in the outside reactions, which was due to the particular structure of Fe3S4. The spinel structure has a smaller iron–sulfur tetrahedral structure, which improved the diffusion of bulk Fe and S ions. Regarding which type of sample was more suitable for the catalysis, the surface S2− relative content of Fe3S4 was higher than that of FeS2. This could cause Fe3S4 to have more surface-active sites, and eventually lead to the improvement of catalytic activity. Therefore, nanoparticles of Fe3S4 had more surface Fe2+, Fe3+ and S2− than FeS2, and showed better catalytic performance and cycling stability.

Photo-Fenton catalytic performance

Fig. 4a shows the photo-Fenton degradation performance catalyzed by different samples of iron sulfides, and the catalysis was carried out in the dark and under sunlight, respectively. Within 35.0 minutes, the FeS2 sample displayed complete RhB photo-Fenton degradation (>99%) under sunlight irradiation, while the degradation efficiency was 62% in the dark. The samples that contained mixture of FeS2 + Fe3S4 could completely degrade RhB within 30.0 minutes under sunlight irradiation (only 75% RhB was degraded without irradiation). Meanwhile, RhB was completely degraded by using Fe3S4 as the catalyst within 22.0 minutes when the reaction system was exposed to sunlight irradiation, but the degradation efficiency was only 60% in the dark within the same period. Since the effect of pH values on Fenton catalysis was well studied due to the negative zeta potential,32 we fixed the pH at the marginal pH values of Fenton-catalysis solutions. It was indicated that the presence of sunlight irradiation could promote the degradation efficiency of RhB catalyzed by the iron sulfide photo-Fenton system, and experiments of three samples under the premise of the same catalyst concentration also proved that the degradation efficiency of Fe3S4 was greater than that of FeS2. To eliminate the interference caused by other factors, Fig. 4b showed the RhB degradation efficiency under various reaction conditions. The experimental results confirmed that RhB could not be efficiently degraded by a single component of H2O2, Fe3S4 or FeS2, neither in darkness nor under sunlight irradiation. The percentage removal of 60% under dark conditions was mainly attributed to the presence of H2O2 assisted by iron sulfide particles. The enhanced catalytic performance means that the Fenton catalysis was only realized by the synergistic effects in the presence of H2O2, iron sulfides and sunlight irradiation.

(b) The removal efficiency of RhB using a single component of H2O2 and the catalysts (FeS2, Fe3S4 and their mixtures) conducted in darkness or under irradiation. (c and d) The degradation kinetics fitting curves of the catalysts (FeS2 and Fe3S4). (e) Time profiles of H2O2 concentration in the FeS2 and Fe3S4 Fenton systems. Conditions of catalysis: solution pH = 3, RhB = 10 ppm, iron sulfide catalyst = 0.125 g L−1 and H2O2 = 2.5 mmol L−1 at room temperature. 
After the kinetic fitting of degradation curves (Fig. 4c and d), it was found that both FeS2 and Fe3S4 had a slower induction period and followed a faster degradation stage; both exhibited apparent first-order kinetics. The degradation stage kinetic rate of FeS2 was 0.30 min−1, which was similar to the kinetic rate of Fe3S4 (0.32 min−1). Hence, the difference in degradation efficiency between the two was mainly due to the slower rate and longer time of the FeS2 induction period, which was also proved by the H2O2 decomposition percentage in solution (Fig. 4e). A report has suggested that dissolved iron-oxalate species in the induction period would be essential for improving the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and also accelerating the degradation of organics.33 Therefore, the faster degradation rate of Fe3S4 may be related to the easier dissolution of iron-sulfide from its spinel structure as compared with the face-centered cubic structure of FeS2 (Fig. 2). The shortening of the induction period may be ascribed to more active sites existing on the surface of iron sulfide samples and the increase in the H2O2 concentration. The shorter induction period of Fe3S4 proved that it had more surface iron ions, which was also consistent with the analysis results of XPS (Fig. 3).
The reusability of iron sulfide catalysts was also checked in the degradation of RhB by cycling experiments. As shown in Fig. 5a, the degradation percentage of RhB decreased to 13% in the fifth cycle of use for the FeS2 photo-Fenton system, which was far below that of the first recycle (82% vs. 100%); the degradation percentage of RhB reached about 84% in the first recycle for the Fe3S4 + FeS2 photo-Fenton systems. With the increase in the cycling time, the degradation efficiency was only about 44% in the fifth cycle. Meanwhile, the Fe3S4 degradation efficiency of RhB retained over 98% even in the fifth cycle (98% vs. 100%). This proved that Fe3S4 showed excellent stability and reusability in the photo-Fenton system. As demonstrated by the XPS analysis (Fig. 3), the large amount of Fe2+ tended to react with H2O2 to form a FeOOH film on the surface of FeS2, thereby hindering the subsequent Fenton reaction in the case of FeS2.30 In a different case, the Fe(III)–SO42− species were formed on the surface of the Fe3S4 particles, which had a less negative influence on the Fenton catalysis. Therefore particles of Fe3S4 catalysts could be reduced from Fe3+ to Fe2+ through the sunlight, which promoted the continued progress of the photo-Fenton reaction as indicated.

The recycled solutions in the two iron sulfide Fenton systems were collected to monitor the concentration variation of dissolved iron ions (Fig. 5b and c). It was found that the total iron concentration in the circulating solution increased gradually with the progress of cycles. The surface S22− and S2− of samples were gradually oxidized to S0 and SO42− as the reaction proceeded and then leached with washing and drying, resulting in the destruction of the iron sulfide surface structure, thus benefiting the release of more iron species in the Fenton system. It was reported that the conversion efficiency from H2O2 to ˙OH in the heterogeneous Fenton systems was dominated by the iron redox cycle.30 The content of Fe2+ was very similar to the total iron in the second to fifth cycles of FeS2, indicating that Fe3+ was almost not contained in solution. The dispersion with Fe3S4 was found to contain both Fe2+ and Fe3+. The significant difference in leached iron ions was probably due to FeOOH being generated on the surface of FeS2 without dissolving in solution, which not only had a lower Fenton reaction rate than iron sulfides but also hindered the surface Fe2+/Fe3+ circulation, resulting in a decreased performance in the circulation of FeS2. In a different way, the Fe3S4 particles generated Fe2(SO4)3 in the reaction and released it in solution without affecting the cycle performance, which can also be proven by the fact that the total iron content in the circulating solution of Fe3S4 was higher than that of FeS2.
Electrochemical properties of catalysis
To further explore the influence of light and surface state on the degradation of RhB during the photo-Fenton reaction, the three samples (FeS2, a mixture of FeS2 + Fe3S4 and Fe3S4) were made into thin films on FTO electrodes for photocurrent response measurements. The photocurrent density vs. time under periodic irradiation is shown in Fig. 6a. It was observed that resistance decreased abruptly under 50 W LED irradiation. All three samples displayed the periodic growth and decay of the current density, suggesting that their light response decreased with repetitions. Under stable conditions, FeS2 film had the highest optical response, showing ∼29.2 μA cm−2 of photocurrent density, and the Fe3S4 film had the weakest response (19.0 μA cm−2). The mixture of FeS2 + Fe3S4 film was 21.5 μA cm−2, which was in the middle level, demonstrated that the FeS2 had a better optical response than Fe3S4. On the one hand, we found that light indeed played a role in increasing the reaction efficiency in the iron sulfide photo-Fenton reaction. This can be interpreted from the photogenerated charge carriers generated from iron sulfide under light irradiation, and the photogenerated electrons moved to the surface to promote the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ on the surface, thereby accelerating the Fenton recycling reaction.11 It has been proved by the XPS spectrum (Fig. 3) that the surface Fe3+ of iron sulfide did not increase after catalysis, even though the surface Fe3+ content of Fe3S4 decreased. However, with the highest photoresponse, the surface Fe3+ content of FeS2 was almost unchanged, and this indicated that the FeOOH film on the surface of FeS2 hindered the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ on the surface, and the light played a minor role in the heterogeneous iron sulfide-catalyzed photo-Fenton reaction. Another possible factor was the surface area of iron sulfide. Therefore, we conducted specific surface area and pore volume tests on FeS2 and Fe3S4. The results are shown in Table 2. Whether in pore volume or surface area, Fe3S4 is larger than FeS2. The surface area of Fe3S4 was 1.6 times that of FeS2. The higher surface area would provide a greater chance of H2O2 being adsorbed on the surface of particles. Hence, a higher catalytic performance was expected. In agreement with the XPS analysis (Fig. 3), the nanoparticles of Fe3S4 had more surface iron and sulfur than FeS2, which could indicate that Fe3S4 had the better degradation efficiency, regardless of light exposure. It could be considered that light and the surface state of the samples worked together to accelerate the rate of the photo-Fenton reaction. The size of the surface area and the number of the surface-active sites were ascribed to the fast rate of the iron sulfide Fenton reaction.

To illustrate the proposed mechanism, a standard three-electrode configuration was employed to investigate the photoelectric catalytic performances of different samples for iron sulfides deposited on the carbon paper electrodes, conducted in an H2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Fig. 6b presents the polarization curves obtained via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 10.0 mV s−1 at room temperature. It was found that particles of FeS2 displayed better HER performance in the dark, showing a decent over-potential (η10) of ∼208 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. When the sample was irradiated by 50 W LED (λ = 420–840 nm), particles of FeS2 exhibited distinguished photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance and the over-potential could be decreased by 54 mV, i.e., the over-potential decreased from 208 mV to 154 mV vs. RHE upon light irradiation. Decrements of over-potential for other iron sulfide samples were also found, namely, 52 mV for a mixture of FeS2 + Fe3S4, and 38 mV for particles of Fe3S4. The comprehensive screening of the over-potential showed that particles of FeS2 optimized the catalysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) both in the dark and with light illumination. The decreased over-potential of FeS2 was about 42% higher than that of Fe3S4. This result was consistent with the photocurrent response test results, which showed that sunlight only played an auxiliary role in the photo-Fenton reaction, and the surface state of the catalyst played a major role.
Conclusion
In conclusion, highly crystalline pyrite (FeS2) and greigite (Fe3S4) were synthesized via a hot-injection method, i.e., pure phases of greigite and pyrite were obtained by only changing the precursor ratios of iron to sulfur (Fe:S) from 1:6 to 1:12. Samples were employed to activate H2O2 for RhB degradation. Results showed that Fe3S4 exhibited higher activity than FeS2. Under the conditions of 0.125 g L−1 iron sulfide catalysts, 2.5 mM H2O2 and pH = 3, the degradation efficiency of 10 mg L−1 RhB by Fe3S4 reached 99.0% within 22.0 minutes under irradiation with sunlight, while the FeS2 showed less activity (∼35.0 min). The unique spinel structure enabled Fe3S4 to have a better cycling stability than FeS2. Under optimal conditions, the catalyst Fe3S4 exhibited better reusability and higher activity for the photo-Fenton reaction, while FeS2 had better electrochemical activity. The hot-injection synthesis and comparison study on FeS2 and Fe3S4 nanoparticles expanded their applications in photocatalysis and electrochemistry.
