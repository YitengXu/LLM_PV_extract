    , Accepted 25th February 2017First published on 27th February 2017AbstractA new 3D-structured acceptor TP3, in which three perylene diimide (PDI) units are connected together by a triptycene (TPC) core, is synthesized and characterized. Organic solar cells (OSCs) fabricated with a PTB7-Th:TP3 blend film as the active layer have been investigated and the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.16% is achieved by adding 0.5% DIO. Our studies suggest that the introduction of the TPC core could suppress the strong self-aggregation tendency of the PDI chromophores.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) as a promising alternative to inorganic semiconductor solar cells have been investigated a lot due to their distinguished advantages, such as low cost, flexibility and easy processability.1–3 In order to obtain OSCs with high performance, the employment of better active layer materials is as essential as the optimization of the OSC devices. As we all know, the active layer composed of donor and acceptor materials plays a key role in sunlight absorption and photoexciton generation. Actually, many efforts have been devoted to the development of high performance donor materials4 and the progress made in the case of the acceptor materials is relatively slow. Fullerene and its derivatives (PC61BM and PC71BM) have high electron affinities and near-ball-shape structures which lead to charge-transport isotropy and high electron mobility.2,5–8 They are still the most commonly used OSC acceptors, although they have some disadvantages that cannot be ignored. For instance, the high cost of production, the narrow absorption spectrum in the visible region of the solar spectrum and the difficulty in tuning their energy levels to match with donor materials.6,9–11 For the above reasons, non-fullerene acceptor materials have been actively explored in the OSC field.
Many potential small molecular acceptor materials have been extensively studied, such as rylene diimides,12–17 benzothiadiazole,18–21 and other electron-deficient aromatic fused rings.22–26 Recently, OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors have received considerable improvements.27–33 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of non-fullerene OSCs has reached around 12%,29 which indicates that OSCs with non-fullerene acceptors are promising. Among the non-fullerene acceptors, perylene diimide (PDI) with its good chemical, thermal and light stabilities, suitable absorption, and high electron mobility is proven to be one of the good candidates to replace fullerene acceptors in OSCs.34,35 However, PDI and its derivatives have a planar structure, which leads to large crystalline domains (far larger than 20 nm) through stacking.36,37 The huge crystalline domains in the active layer will lead to donor–acceptor phase separation and result in reduced exciton diffusion efficiencies. Finally, the short circuit current density (Jsc) of the devices is lowered, which is closely related to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs. Therefore, one of the most important strategies for designing small molecular PDI-based acceptors is to overcome the self-aggregation tendency among the planar PDI molecules.
Initially, alkyl chains or aromatic groups were introduced into the PDI molecules at their bay or imide-N positions, but no remarkable improvement in the performance of the OSCs was observed.13,38,39 Acceptors formed by two PDI moieties which were connected by a linker such as thiophene, bithiophene and spirobifluorene, or directly coupled together, were synthesized, and improved performances of OSCs were obtained.14–17,40 Zhan et al. reported a star-shaped quasi-three-dimensional (3D) nonplanar acceptor composed of three PDI units and a triphenylamine (TPA) core, and a PCE of 3.32% was obtained when the low-bandgap polymer PBDDTTT-C-T was used as the donor.41,42 Jenekhe et al. further emphasized the importance of the 3D architecture of the acceptors.43 Cho's and Ma's groups designed two new 3D structures composed of four PDI units connected to a spirobifluorene core, and PCEs of 5.98% and 5.34% were obtained respectively.44,45 Good photovoltaic performances were also obtained for 3D-structured PDI acceptors with tetraphenylmethane, spirobifluorene, or tetraphenylethylene, etc. as the cores for PDI units to connect with.30–32,46–48
Triptycene (TPC) has a 3D rigid structure with 120° dihedral angles between nearby phenyl rings. Due to their unique structure, TPC and its derivatives have attracted considerable attention in the past 20 years and have been widely applied in the fields of molecular machines,49,50 material chemistry51–55 and supramolecular chemistry.56,57
Herein, we report a novel nonplanar 3D PDI acceptor (TP3, Scheme 1) with a TPC core. The 3D structure was built by connecting the TPC core with three PDI units at their bay positions. Its photovoltaic performance was studied. PTB7-Th, which was frequently used as the donor material blending with the PDI acceptors,30,45,58 was chosen as the donor material. The OSCs show the best PCE of 3.16% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.86 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 9.54 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.39. Embedding a 3D core into the PDI units may decrease the crystallinity of the PDI acceptor and prevent the formation of excessively large domains in the active layer of OSCs. Moreover, 3D-structured acceptors may form interpenetrated charge transport networks, and hence improved electron mobility may be obtained. These results suggest that the nonplanar 3D molecular design is a promising way to more efficient organic photovoltaic materials.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis route to TP3 is shown in Scheme 1. The final product is easily obtained by a Suzuki coupling reaction between triptycene triboric ester (3Bpin-TPC) and three monobrominated PDI units (Br-PDI) with more than 46% yield after purification. 1H NMR, 13C NMR, high resolution MALDI-TOF-MS and elemental analysis are applied to identify its structure. Fortunately, this acceptor material shows wonderful solubility and stability in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (>60 mg mL−1), toluene and chlorobenzene.
Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to investigate the thermal properties of TP3. From the TGA graph (Fig. 1a), the decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) under a nitrogen atmosphere is found to be 380 °C, indicating that TP3 has good thermal stability. The DSC spectrum (Fig. 1b) shows that TP3 has an infinitesimal melting peak at 248 °C and a crystallization peak at 253 °C, and the crystallization heat is much lower than that of PDI monomers,30 proving that the PDI chromophores in TP3 have no stronger crystallization tendency.

Simulation by a computational method
The molecular structural characteristics and frontier molecular orbital energy levels of TP3 were investigated at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level using Gaussian 09.59 The long branched alkyl chains were replaced by isopropyl groups to simplify the calculation. From the front view of TP3 in Fig. 2, the three PDI units are validly separated and each PDI unit is not coplanar with the corresponding phenyl groups in the triptycene unit, which leads to a nonplanar 3D structure. The torsion angles are about 60°, 60°, and 61°, respectively. Meanwhile, each PDI unit in the TP3 molecule also loses its planar structure with a torsion angle of ca. 18°. No symmetry is observed for the TP3 molecule and three PDI units extend outside TPC to build a new 3D structure. The TP3 molecule has quasi-triply-degenerate HOMOs and LUMOs (Fig. S1, ESI†), respectively, which are almost populated only on the PDI units. These results suggest that the photoelectric properties of TP3 are strongly dependent on the three PDI units. These cases are similar to those of the SBF-PDI4 molecule in C. Q. Ma's report.45 Thus, a rational assumption is that TP3 may also be a promising acceptor in OSCs.

Further, the potential interface models of PTB7-Th:PTB7-Th (D–D); PTB7-Th:TP3 (D–A) and TP3:TP3 (A–A) are constructed and optimized using the same level to investigate the intermolecular binding, as shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  The D–D, D–A, A–A interfaces and binding energies calculated with the M06-2X/6-31G(d) method. 
Their frontier orbitals are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The binding energies (ΔE) of D–A, A–A and D–D are predicted through the calculations of ΔE (ΔE = Edimer − (ED/A + EA/D)). Edimer is the zero-point corrected energy of the stacking dimers, and (ED/A + EA/D) stands for the sum of isolated monomer's energies. As shown in Fig. 3, the binding energy is −33.23, −33.51, and −29.31 kcal mol−1 for D–A, A–A and D–D, respectively. ΔEA–A is close to ΔED–A, indicating that the self-aggregation tendency of the acceptor should not be ignored. These results show that the short-circuit current and fill factor (FF) of devices could be possibly unfavorable.
Optical and electronic properties

Fig. 4 shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of TP3 in chloroform solution and solid film, and of the PTB7-Th:TP3 blend film. In solution, the investigated TP3 acceptor with a concentration of 1.25 × 10−5 mol L−1 shows that the obvious absorption peaks are at 511 and 540 nm, with the maximum absorption peak wavelength at 540 nm. And the molar absorption coefficient (ε) is 9.5 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1.

Compared to the absorption spectra in solution, the thin film of TP3 shows a broader absorption, and the absorption strengths of the 511 and 540 nm peaks increase and decrease, respectively, which is probably caused by the molecular aggregation in the solid state.31 In the absorption of the PTB7-Th:TP3 blend film, a complementary absorption is observed and covered almost the whole visible range (from 300 nm to 780 nm). This absorption feature suggests that the active layer has the perfect behavior for light harvesting, which contributes to the short circuit-current density (Jsc) of the photovoltaic device.
The electrochemical properties of TP3 were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 5a, it can be seen that the onset of the reduction potential and oxidation potential of TP3 are approximately −0.81 V and 1.28 V, respectively. Thus, the LUMO and HOMO energy levels were estimated to be −3.97 eV and −6.06 eV by the empirical formula. The band gap Eg (Eg = ELUMO − EHOMO) of TP3 is 2.09 eV. The HOMO energy level of TP3 is close to the calculated result (−5.83 eV) with the M06-2X/6-31G(d) method. The energy level diagram of donor and acceptor materials is shown in Fig. 5b. Generally speaking, the accepted minimal value of the exciton separation and electron transportation processes is about 0.3 eV.60 The present difference between the LUMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor is calculated to be 0.34 eV. Therefore, it is appropriate to drive the above processes within the active layer of the photovoltaic device.

Photovoltaic properties
To study the role of TP3 as the non-fullerene acceptor in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, the commercially available PTB7-Th (structure shown in Scheme 1) was chosen as the donor, which has a complementary absorption spectrum and matched energy levels (Fig. 4 and 5b) with TP3.
A conventional photovoltaic device with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:TP3/Ca/Al was fabricated. J–V curves of the OSCs were evaluated under AM 1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 6a. And the related parameters, such as Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, are summarized in Table 1. The donor/acceptor weight ratios varied from 1:1 to 1:1.5 and we found that 1:1 is the best ratio. Without any treatment, the device obtained a PCE of 2.34% with a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 8.04 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.34. In order to improve the power conversion efficiency, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added from 0% to 1%. We found that after the addition of 0.5% DIO, the device showed the best PCE of 3.16% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 9.54 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.39. The increase in both FF and Jsc is the major factor for the improvement in efficiency, so we speculate that DIO may decrease the aggregation of TP3 and optimize the blend film morphology to some extent, which improve the exciton diffusion in OSCs. Addition of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as the additive in the active layer was attempted to enhance the device performance, but no obvious improvements were observed.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PTB7-Th:TP3 blend films are shown in Fig. 6b. The EQE is consistent with Jsc variation in J–V curves. A wide-range photoresponse from 300 to 800 nm was observed, and it is in accord with the UV-vis absorption of the blend film. The response area of TP3 ranges from 300 to 600 nm, and the response area of PTB7-Th is from around 600 to 800 nm. The EQE values of PTB7-Th:TP3 (w/w, 1:1) are much higher than those of the PTB7-Th:TP3 (w/w, 1:1.5) device, which is in good agreement with the above PCE values. Addition of 0.25% CN contributes to the increase of the EQE of PTB7-Th from 39% to 41%. With the addition of 0.5% DIO, the EQE values of TP3 in the response area are much higher than those with 0.25% CN addition or without any addition. Moreover, the EQE values of the TP3 area with 0.5% DIO addition are even equal to those in the PTB7-Th photoresponse area. Hence, with 0.5% DIO, the present data indicate that TP3 makes a considerable contribution to the overall photocurrent comparable to the contribution from the donor PTB7-Th.
Carrier transport properties
Charge transport properties of the PTB7-Th:TP3 (w/w, 1:1) blend film were investigated by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole-only and electron-only device structures are ITO/MoOx/PTB7-Th:TP3/MoOx/Al and ITO/Al/PTB7-Th:TP3/Al, respectively. The SCLC curves are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The calculated value of the hole mobility is 6.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and that of the electron mobility is 7.08 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with 0.5% DIO as the additive. These results show that the electron–hole mobility ratio (μe/μh = 1.124) is nearly balanced. The relatively low charge carrier mobility may be responsible for the low PCEs.
Morphology properties
In order to evaluate the impact of the DIO additive on the topography and surface roughness of the blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement in the tapping mode was carried out. The height and phase images of the PTB7-Th:TP3 (w/w, 1:1) blend film without and with 0.5% DIO are shown in Fig. 7. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the as-cast film is about 2.89 nm. An over-aggregation and a larger size phase separation are observed for this as-cast film.

The aggregation and phase separation may lead to a decrease in the Jsc and FF values of the devices. After addition of 0.5% DIO, the film shows a smoother and uniform surface morphology with a RMS value of 1.84 nm. Although the addition of 0.5% DIO may inhibit the aggregation of TP3, the roughness of the surface does not improve sufficiently. Hence, the series resistance in the devices cannot be ignored, which leads to a rather low FF value of 0.39.
Experimental
Synthesis of TP3
3Bpin-TPC (100 mg, 0.16 mmol), Br-PDI (570 mg, 0.55 mmol) and K2CO3 (280 mg, 2 mmol) were dissolved in THF (20 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh3)4 (60 mg) was quickly added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at refluxing temperature for 72 h. After cooling to room temperature, the organic phase was extracted with chloroform. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography using petroleum ether and methylene chloride as eluents. The crude product was further purified by thin layer chromatography on silica gel to give a dark red solid (230 mg, 46%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.79–8.54 (m, 12H, perylene aryl H), 8.14–6.92 (m, 19H, perylene aryl H and triptycene aryl H), 5.83–5.51 (m, 2H, triptycene bridge H), 4.40–3.76 (m, 12H), 1.93 (d, 6H), 1.52–0.95 (m, 192H), 0.83 (t, 36H).

Computational method
All the geometries were optimized using the M06-2X functional together with the 6-31G(d) basis set. Frequencies were calculated at the same theoretical level to ensure that the optimized structure was really the local minimum in the potential energetic surface. All calculations were carried out with the aid of the Gaussian 09 program.59
Fabrication and characterization for photovoltaic devices
Conventional photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:TP3/Ca/Al. The pre-patterned ITO glass substrate was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath sequentially with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 20 min, respectively, and then dried overnight. The substrates were treated in an ultraviolet–ozone chamber for 20 min before use. A 40 nm thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios P VA A 4083) was spin-cast onto the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 40 s, and subsequently baked at 150 °C for 20 min. The PTB7-Th:TP3 blend solutions were prepared in o-DCB with different mass ratios and DIO/CN concentrations (PTB7-Th concentration was fixed at 7 mg mL−1) and then spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 1000 rpm for 40 s followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min to form the photosensitive layer with an optimal thickness of ∼100 nm (measured on a Bruker Dektak XT profilometer) in a N2 glove box. Finally, thin layers of Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited on top of the active layer in a vacuum of 5 × 10−6 Pa. The active area of the device was 4.50 mm2 and an aperture of 3.14 mm2 was used during the measurement. J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit in the glove box. The photocurrent was measured under an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Class AAA solar simulator, Model 94063A, Oriel) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated using a standard Si solar cell. The EQE spectra were obtained from a QEX10 Solar Cell EQE measurement system (PV measurement, Inc.). All the fabrication processes were performed inside the controlled atmosphere of a N2-filled glove box.
Conclusions
In summary, a novel 3D acceptor TP3 with three PDI units connected together by a TPC core was explored. TP3 has a complementary absorption and an appropriate energy level to match with the donor material PTB7-Th. OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:TP3 (w/w, 1:1) blend film and 0.5% DIO additive show a PCE of 3.16%, with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 9.54 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.39. The results demonstrate that the present 3D molecular design is an effective strategy to inhibit the aggregation tendency of the PDI acceptors. However, the low charge carrier mobility of the active layer and the low FF value of the solar cells based on the nonplanar 3D acceptor TP3 suggest that further adjustment of the molecular structure is needed.
