    , Accepted 30th November 2018First published on 1st December 2018AbstractFluorine and alkylsilyl substitutions are two important strategies to reduce the energy levels and increase the absorption coefficient and hole mobility of photovoltaic materials simultaneously. Similar to fluorination, chlorination can also induce the intermolecular non-covalent interactions of Cl–H/S/Cl. Moreover, because chlorine (Cl) atoms contain empty 3d orbitals that can hold π-electrons from the conjugated skeleton, chlorination can decrease the molecular HOMO level more effectively than fluorination. Herein, we developed two wide bandgap polymer donors PBZ-Cl and PBZ-ClSi based on the Cl atom, and combined the Cl atom and alkylsilyl substituted thienyl benzodithiophene (BDTT-Cl and BDTT-ClSi) as donor units, respectively. From the control polymer PBZ to PBZ-Cl and then to PBZ-ClSi, the polymers show a gradually reduced HOMO level, increased absorption coefficient and improved charge mobility. As a result, the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F-based PSCs fabricated by the nonhalogen solvents achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.8% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.2 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 71.5% and a low energy loss of 0.57 eV, while the PSCs based on PBZ and PBZ-Cl only obtained lower PCEs of 6.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The PCE of 12.8% is one of the highest values recorded for nonhalogen solvent-processed PSCs to date. The results indicate that the combination of Cl atoms and alkylsilyl substituents is a simple and effective method for designing high efficiency polymer photovoltaic materials.
1. Introduction
In the past four years, n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) acceptors have outperformed traditional fullerene acceptors for photovoltaic applications in PSCs due to their unique merits, such as adjustable molecular absorption, energy levels and crystallinity, high morphological stability and small energy loss (Eloss) in polymer solar cells (PSCs).1–5 Among the n-OS acceptors, small molecule acceptors, especially ITIC and related derivatives,6–10 have become dominant in high-performance PSCs. Due to intensive research efforts on the chemical structure tailoring of n-OS acceptors, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached 12–14% in single-junction PSCs.11–20 For example, recently, Hou et al. reported a tetrafluorinated acceptor, IT-4F, with a narrow bandgap (NBG).19 Blending with a wide bandgap (WBG) polymer, the IT-4F-based PSCs achieve a PCE of 13.1%. Very recently, the PCEs of IT-4F-based PSCs were further increased to 13.5% in our work,20a 14.4% in Hou's work by changing the matched polymer donors,20b and 14.57% in Zhou's work by tuning the hole-transporting layer of the devices.20c
Since well-matched polymer donor and n-OS acceptor materials play a key role in efficient PSCs, tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing high-performance polymer donors.21–28 Among a variety of polymer donor materials, WBG (1.9–2.0 eV) polymers with a D–A molecular skeleton of thienyl benzodithiophene-alt-4,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzotriazole (BDTT-alt-DTBTz)21,29 have become one of the widely used and successful material systems, due to their strong optical absorption in the wavelength range of 400–650 nm with a high absorption coefficient of ∼105 cm−1 in film, ordered molecular packing, high hole mobility of ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and favorable morphological insensitivity. For example, in our previous work, the PSCs based on the polymer donor PBZ29 and ITIC showed a high short circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.2 mA cm−2, despite the fact that the PCE is only ca. 8.0%, limited by a relatively low open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V. As is well known, Voc is proportional to the offset between the EHOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital level) of the polymer donor and the ELUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level) of the n-OS acceptor.19–21,30 Therefore, decreasing the HOMO level of the polymer donors by molecular structure modification, especially by fluorination31 of polymers, is one of the most effective strategies for obtaining high Voc in PSCs. For example, our recent work shows that introducing two fluorine (F) atoms into the BDTT unit (BDTT-2F) can also effectively decrease the HOMO level (reduced by ca. 0.18 eV) of polymer PBZ. As a result, a higher Voc of 0.89 V was achieved in PSCs based on fluorinated PFBZ.29 Furthermore, Xue et al. attached four F atoms to a BDTT unit (BDTT-4F), and the obtained polymer J91 (ref. 21b) shows a significantly reduced HOMO level by ca. 0.33 eV, resulting in a substantially increased Voc of up to 0.984 V. Although the fluorination of the polymer promotes device efficiency, the difficult reaction routes and expensive fluorination reagents have seriously hampered the large-scale application of fluorination in photovoltaic materials.19,29–31
Similar to fluorination, chlorination can also induce the intermolecular non-covalent interactions of Cl–H/S/Cl and heavy-atom effect, resulting in more ordered molecular stacking and higher charge mobility for the photovoltaic materials compared to their halogen-free counterparts.16 Notably, because Cl atoms contain empty 3d-orbitals that can hold π-electrons from the conjugated skeleton, chlorination can decrease the molecular HOMO energy level more effectively than fluorination.32 Moreover, compared to F substitution, Cl substitution has simpler reaction steps and lower reaction cost.20b,33 Recently, we designed and synthesized an efficient polymer, PM7, based on a chlorinated BDTT unit (BDTT-2Cl), and found that PM7 exhibited a significantly decreased HOMO level, enhanced absorption coefficient and improved crystallinity.34 As a result, the PM7:IT-4F-based PSCs achieved a PCE of 13.1%, which is the highest value for nonhalogen solvent-processed PSCs. Very recently, Bin et al. reported another simple and efficient strategy to down-shift the molecular HOMO level by introducing σ* (Si)–π* (C) bond interaction. For example, Bin et al. attached alkylsilyl into the BDTT unit (BDTT-2Si) of polymer PBZ and synthesized polymer J71.21a The polymer displays a lower HOMO level (reduced by ca. 0.23 eV) resulting in an increased Voc of 0.94 V in the J71:ITIC-based PSCs.
Herein, we designed and synthesized a new donor unit of BDTT-2Cl2Si by combining Cl atoms and alkylsilyl substituents. Compared to the BDTT unit, the BDTT-2Cl2Si unit has a similar synthetic method and higher alkylsilyl substituent yield because the chlorination activates the α-H of thiophene. Moreover, two new polymers, PBZ-Cl based on BDTT-2Cl and PBZ-ClSi based on BDTT-2Cl2Si, were developed for PSC applications, respectively. As we expected, from the control polymer PBZ to PBZ-Cl and then to PBZ-ClSi, the polymers show a gradually reduced HOMO level, increased absorption coefficient, and improved charge mobility. As a result, the nonhalogen solvent-processed PSCs based on PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F achieve a high PCE of 12.8% with a high Voc of 0.93 V, Jsc of 19.2 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 71.5% and a low energy loss (Eloss, is defined as Eoptg − eVoc) of 0.57 eV, while the PBZ:IT-4F and PBZ-Cl:IT-4F-based PSCs only obtain lower PCEs of 6.4% (Voc of 0.60 V, Jsc of 17.0 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.2%) and 9.7% (Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 17.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 68.3%), respectively. The PCE of 12.8% is one of the highest values recorded for the nonhalogen solvent-processed PSCs. The results indicate that the combination of Cl atoms and alkylsilyl substituents is an effective method for designing high performance polymer photovoltaic materials.
2. Results and discussion
The polymers PBZ, PBZ-Cl and PBZ-ClSi are synthesized through simple and high yield (80–90%) four step reactions, as shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis processes are described in detail in the ESI.† The weight average molecular weights (Mw) and number average molecular weights (Mn) are 39.0/19.9, 34.0/16.2 and 43.0/23.8 kDa with the polydispersity indexes of 1.86, 2.10 and 1.81 for the polymers PBZ, PBZ-Cl and PBZ-ClSi respectively, measured by gel permeation chromatography using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at a high temperature of 160 °C. All three polymers show good solubility in common organic solvents such as toluene, chloroform and chlorobenzene, which means that any of them can be used as processing solvents to prepare active layers for photovoltaic applications. The thermo-gravimetric analysis tests (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) show that the three polymers exhibited good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures of higher than 300 °C at 5% weight loss.

The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in toluene solutions and neat films are summarized in Fig. 1b. In solution, the polymers show similar absorption spectra and have obvious shoulder absorption peaks at ca. 580 nm, which means that these polymers have strong self-aggregation in toluene, especially for PBZ-ClSi. In neat films, the polymers also display similar absorption spectra, while PBZ-ClSi shows that the absorption spectrum is blue-shifted by ca. 10 nm compared to polymers PBZ and PBZ-Cl. Notably, from PBZ to PBZ-Cl and then to PBZ-ClSi, the polymers show sequentially enhanced shoulder absorptions, suggesting that the intermolecular interaction gradually increases.21a,29 For comparison, the absorption spectra of the polymers and IT-4F in films are described in Fig. 1c. For the maximum absorption peaks, the absorption coefficient of the PBZ-ClSi film (1.08 × 105 cm−1 at 536 nm) is improved by ca. 16% and 48% compared to those of the PBZ-Cl (0.93 × 105 cm−1 at 541 nm) and PBZ (0.73 × 105 cm−1 at 548 nm) films, implying the existence of stronger π–π stacking interaction and more ordered intermolecular aggregation in the PBZ-ClSi film due to the synergistic effect of chlorine and alkylsilyl substituents.21a,34 The absorption edge at ca. 640 nm and the optical bandgap (Eoptg) at ca. 1.94 eV for the polymers is absorption complementary to IT-4F (Eoptg ≈ 1.50 eV), which helps to improve light-capture and then to increase the Jsc of PSCs. As shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI,† the pure PBZ-ClSi film shows a higher hole mobility (μh) of 1.02 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in comparison with the pure PBZ-Cl (8.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PBZ (6.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) films estimated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method.

The energy levels of PBZ-Cl and PBZ-ClSi were evaluated by the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry method and compared with those of PBZ (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The onset oxidation/reduction potentials (Eox/Ered) are 0.47/−1.49, 0.68/−1.30 and 0.85/−1.21 V versus Ag/Ag+ for the polymers PBZ, PBZ-Cl and PBZ-ClSi, and the related HOMO/LUMO levels are evaluated to be −5.18/−3.22, −5.39/−3.41 and −5.56/−3.50 eV according to the equation30EHOMO/ELUMO = −e(Eox/Ered + 4.71) eV, respectively. From PBZ to PBZ-Cl and then to PBZ-ClSi, the polymers show sequentially down-shifted HOMO levels due to the strong electronegativity of the Cl substituent and the σ* (Si)–π* (C) bond interaction of the alkylsilyl substituent, which helps to achieve higher Voc in PSCs. Notably, compared to their J71 counterparts,21a the alkylsilyl substituted PBZ-ClSi also shows a down-shifted HOMO level of ca. 0.16 eV. Our results show that the combination of Cl and alkylsilyl substituents on the 2D-conjugated polymer is a simple and efficient way to reduce the HOMO level of polymers.
A device with the structure of glass/ITO/ZnO/PFN/active layer/MoO3/Al was fabricated to probe the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, and the preparation process is summarized in Fig. S4 and Table S1 of the ESI.† Considering the adverse impact of halogenated solvents and additives on human health and the environment, development of a green process for device fabrication should be one of the major goals for large-scale manufacturing of PSCs.22,35 Hence, in this work, we selected nonhalogenated solvents, i.e. toluene as the host solvent and 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN) as the solvent additive, to process the blend film of the active layer. For the weight ratios of PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F (D/A) in toluene from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5, the devices possess a Jsc of more than 17.0 mA cm−2 and the same high Voc of 0.93 V simultaneously, while an optimal PCE of 11.2% was achieved at a D/A ratio of 1:1. Subsequently, to improve the device efficiency, the morphology of PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F (1:1) was optimized by adding a small amount of 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN) that belongs to the halogen-free solvent. As the active layers were optimized with 1% (v/v) PN, the devices achieved an almost invariable high Voc of 0.93 V, an obviously increased Jsc from 17.9 to 19.2 mA cm−2 and FF from 66.7% to 71.5% simultaneously. Finally, a high PCE of 12.8% was achieved for the champion PSCs, which is one of the highest values recorded for nonhalogen solvent-processed PSCs to date. Moreover, control PSCs based on PBZ:IT-4F were also fabricated and only displayed a low PCE of 6.4% due to a low Voc of 0.60 V and FF of 63.2%, while the PSCs based on PBZ-Cl:IT-4F achieved a medium PCE of 9.7% with a moderate Voc of 0.80 V and FF of 68.3%, as shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1. Notably, from PBZ to PBZ-Cl and then to PBZ-ClSi as donors, the IT-4F-based PSCs show sequentially decreased Eloss from 0.9 eV to 0.7 eV and then to 0.57 eV due to the gradually increased Voc of PSCs, respectively. The Eloss of 0.57 eV in PSCs is less than the empirical threshold of 0.6 eV.

The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices were measured to probe the photon harvesting and charge collection processes and confirm the Jsc in PSCs (see Fig. 2b). All the devices showed a broad EQE response range from ∼300 to 820 nm and have EQE values of more than 50% in a wide range of ca. 380–760 nm. In the absorption region belonging to polymers (ca. 450–630 nm), the gradually increased EQE values are found in the PSCs with different polymer donors from PBZ to PBZ-Cl and then to PBZ-ClSi, which is consistent with the changing trend of the absorption coefficient of the related polymers (see Fig. 1c). As a result, the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F-based PSC possesses a higher maximum EQE value of ca. 81% at 560 nm in comparison with the PSCs based on PBZ-Cl:IT-4F (ca. 77% at 550 nm) and PBZ:IT-4F (ca. 74% at 545 nm). Notably, in the absorption region belonging to IT-4F (ca. 630–760 nm), the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F-based PSC also shows higher EQE values compared to the PSCs based on PBZ:IT-4F and PBZ-Cl:IT-4F. It is suggested that the holes of the excitons produced from the photons absorbed by IT-4F can be efficiently transferred to the polymer donor in the PBZ-ClSi-based PSCs despite the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F pair having a smaller ΔEHOMO of 0.13 eV in comparison with the PBZ:IT-4F (0.51 eV) and PBZ-Cl:IT-4F (0.40 eV) pairs, which may be attributed to the fact that the better miscibility between PBZ-ClSi and IT-4F in blends can promote photon harvesting and charge collection within the cell. The integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves are 16.3, 16.9 and 19.2 mA cm−2 for the PSCs based on PBZ:IT-4F, PBZ-Cl:IT-4F and PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F respectively, which is well consistent with the Jsc values from the J–V tests. The PSCs based on PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F show higher Jsc and FF, which should be relevant to higher charge carrier mobilities. The electron/hole mobilities (μe/μh) were estimated to be 1.20/0.12 × 10−4, 1.91/1.16 × 10−4 and 2.57/2.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PBZ:IT-4F, PBZ-Cl:IT-4F and PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F films (Fig. S2 in the ESI†), respectively. The higher and more balanced μe/μh for the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F film helps to suppress space charge accumulation and thus improves charge extraction.
In addition to high efficiency, for the practical fabrication of roll-to-roll PSCs in future, high tolerance of the PCEs to the active layer thickness is also a necessary prerequisite. As shown in Fig. 2c, S5 and Table S2 in the ESI,† in the active layer thickness range of ca. 80–210 nm, all the PSCs based on PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F show high PCE values of more than 11%, an almost unchanged Voc of 0.93 V, and a small fluctuating Jsc of 18.6 ± 0.6 mA cm−2. Moreover, the PSC with a thick active layer of up to 210 nm still achieves a high PCE of 11.0%, which helps to realize large-scale production of high-performance PSCs.
The exciton dissociation and charge extraction behavior of the IT-4F-based devices with different polymer donors were probed by calculating the exciton dissociation probabilities P(E,T) from the curves of photocurrent (Jph) vs. effective voltage (Veff),29,36 as shown in Fig. 2d. The calculation methods and parameter definitions are described in the ESI.† Under short-circuit conditions, the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F-based PSCs show a higher P(E,T) of 93.7% in comparison with the PSCs based on PBZ-Cl:IT-4F (92.9%) and PBZ:IT-4F (81.1%), implying that the PSCs with PBZ-ClSi as the donor have more efficient exciton dissociation and charge extraction behaviors. Moreover, the slopes of Vocvs. lnP (P is light intensity) are shown in Fig. 2e to investigate the charge recombination mechanism of PSCs.20a,36 The slope at 2kBT/q (where q, kB and T are the elementary charge, Boltzmann constant and Kelvin temperature, respectively) suggests that the trap-assisted recombination dominates in PSCs, and the slope is kBT/q, meaning that the PSCs only display bimolecular recombination. The PSCs based on PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F displayed a smaller slope of 1.11kBT/q in comparison with the PSCs based on PBZ-Cl:IT-4F (1.15kBT/q) and PBZ:IT-4F (1.30kBT/q), which implies that both Cl and alkylsilyl substituents of polymers can suppress trap-assisted recombination of devices and thus improve Jsc. And then, the relationship of Jph with P was defined as Jph ∝ PS and studied to further probe the bimolecular recombination behavior of the devices.25,36 If the device has weak bimolecular recombination, the S value is close to 1. As shown in Fig. 2f, the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F-based PSCs displayed an S value of 0.935 that is close to 1, suggesting negligible bimolecular recombination in devices. In contrast, the S values of the PSCs based on PBZ-Cl:IT-4F and PBZ:IT-4F are 0.932 and 0.897 respectively, implying the existence of more bimolecular recombination. Less bimolecular recombination in the PSCs based on PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F is consistent with a higher FF (71.5%) in comparison with the PSCs based on PBZ:IT-4F (63.2%) and PBZ-Cl:IT-4F (68.3%).
The photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiencies of the blend films compared to their pure films were measured (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†). Compared to the PL spectra of pure polymer and IT-4F films, gradually increased PL quenching efficiencies were found for the PBZ:IT-4F, PBZ-Cl:IT-4F and PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F blend films, which indicates that both the Cl and alkylsilyl substituents on polymers can promote the photo-induced charge transfer behavior between the polymer and IT-4F in devices, which agrees with the EQE spectra of the related PSCs.
The molecular packing and orientation texture of the neat and blend films were revealed by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements.37 As shown in Fig. 3a and b, all the polymer pure films show strong (010) π–π stacking peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, which means that these polymers have a predominant “face-on” orientation. In the in-plane (IP) direction, all three polymers have strong (100) diffraction peaks at almost the same position of ∼0.29 Å−1; the corresponding lamellar distance is ∼21.5 Å. Notably, compared to polymers PBZ and PBZ-Cl, polymer PBZ-ClSi in the IP direction shows additional (200) and (300) diffraction peaks at ∼0.65 and ∼0.93 Å−1 with small lamellar distances of ∼9.63 and ∼6.77 Å, and high coherence lengths (CLs) of ∼9.11 and ∼3.85 nm respectively, which implies that the PBZ-ClSi film has a higher crystallinity and more orderly molecular packing. Moreover, compared to the polymer pure films, the polymer:IT-4F blends still retain a predominant “face-on” orientation. In contrast to the blend films of PBZ:IT-4F (from ∼10.3 to ∼9.16 nm) and PBZ-Cl:IT-4F (from ∼9.15 to ∼8.75 nm) having the decreased CL values, the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F blend film shows an increased CL value from ∼7.81 to ∼8.44 nm. Moreover, compared to the PBZ-ClSi film, the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F blend film still displays the additional (200) and (300) diffraction peaks. The above results showed that the blending of IT-4F into the blend film does not weaken the crystallinity and molecular packing of PBZ-ClSi. The face-on orientation, strong crystallinity, and orderly molecular packing of blend films are beneficial to achieving high charge mobilities and reducing the trap-assisted recombination for the corresponding devices, and thus obtaining high Jsc and FF.

We also carried out resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) tests to study the phase separation of the blend films.38 As shown in Fig. 3c, the PBZ-Cl:IT-4F blend film has only one scale of phase separation with a moderate domain size of 27.0 nm, while the PBZ:IT-4F (35.5 and 7.84 nm) and PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F (35.1 and 17.6 nm) blend films show two scales of phase separation. Notably, for the PBZ:IT-4F blend film, the ratio of the two scales of phase separation is 21:79, which indicates that a small size phase separation of 7.84 nm dominates. It is well known that an excessively small domain size will impede exciton dissociation and charge transport. For the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F blend film, the ratio of the two scales of phase separation is 16:84, which indicates that the appropriate size phase separation of 17.6 nm dominates. The appropriate and multi-scale domain sizes facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport in devices.39 As a result, the PSCs based on PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F display higher FF and Jsc, and finally higher PCE.
The bulk morphologies of the blend films were also studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. As shown in Fig. 4, the PBZ:IT-4F film displays a strong intermolecular aggregation of PBZ or IT-4F, while the PBZ-Cl:IT-4F film exhibits a non-uniform phase separation. By contrast, the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F film shows suitable phase separation and uniform fiber structures, which suggests that the PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F pair has better miscibility, which is closely related to its superior photovoltaic performance in PSCs.

3. Conclusions
In summary, two new 2D-conjugated polymer donors PBZ-Cl and PBZ-ClSi containing chlorinated BDTT-2Cl, and Cl and alkylsilyl substituted BDTT-ClSi donor units were synthesized, respectively. From the control polymer PBZ to PBZ-Cl and then to PBZ-ClSi, the polymers show gradually reduced HOMO levels, increased absorption coefficient and improved charge mobility. As a result, the nonhalogen solvent-processed PSCs based on PBZ-ClSi:IT-4F achieved a high PCE of 12.8% with a high Voc of 0.93 V, Jsc of 19.2 mA cm−2, FF of 71.5% and an Eloss as low as 0.57 eV, while the PSCs based on PBZ:IT-4F and PBZ-Cl:IT-4F obtained lower PCEs of 6.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The PCE of 12.8% is one of the highest values recorded for nonhalogen solvent-processed PSCs to date. The results indicate that the combination of Cl and alkylsilyl substituents is a simple and effective method for designing high-performance polymer photovoltaic materials.
4. Experimental section
Materials
The n-OS acceptor IT-4F was synthesized according to a procedure reported in the literature.19 Compound M1 was purchased from Suna Tech; M2 (ref. 34) and M4 (ref. 29) were synthesized according to our previous reports. Polymer donors PBZ, PBZ-Cl and PBZ-ClSi were synthesized according to the following processes.
Synthesis of compound 2
Compound 1 (11.9 g, 0.1 mol) and 100 mL dry THF were mixed at −78 °C under argon protection; 50 mL of LDA (0.1 mol, 2 M) was slowly added. The reaction mixture was then stirred at −78 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, chlorotripropylsilane (21.2 g, 0.11 mol) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Then, the mixture was poured into water and extracted three times with ether. The combined organic phase was washed with water three times. The resulting crude compound was purified with silica gel to give a colorless liquid (2, 24.1 g, 88%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), δ (ppm): 7.48 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 1H), 7.02 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 1H), 1.37 (tt, J = 14.5, 7.1 Hz, 6H). 1.01–0.86 (m, 15H).
Synthesis of compound 4
Compound (3-chlorothiophen-2-yl)tripropylsilane (2, 8.2 g, 0.03 mol) and 60 mL dry THF were added into a flask under argon protection. The solution was cooled to −78 °C and 15 mL of LDA (0.03 mol, 2 M) was slowly added. The reaction mixture was then stirred at −78 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, compound benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (3, 2.2 g, 0.01 mol) was added to the reaction mixture, and then stirred for 2 h at 50 °C. After cooling to ambient temperature, a mixture of SnCl2·2H2O (18.0 g, 0.08 mol) in 10% HCl (80 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for an additional 2 h at 50 °C. After that, the reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted three times with ether. The organic layer was washed with water three times and then dried over MgSO4. After the removal of solvent, the crude product was purified by column chromatography on a silica gel column using petroleum ether as the eluent to afford compound 4 (5.6 g, yield 79%) as a light yellow solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), δ (ppm): 7.61 (d, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H), 7.50 (d, J = 5.7 Hz, 2H), 7.40 (m, 2H), 1.47 (tt, J = 14.7, 7.3 Hz, 12H), 1.07–0.93 (m, 30H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, TMS), δ (ppm): 140.77, 138.28, 138.06, 135.74, 129.62, 128.32, 126.54, 129.98, 121.46, 18.39, 17.42, 15.53, −8.33.
