    , Accepted 16th August 2019First published on 16th August 2019AbstractEven though Si is the most cost efficient and extensively used semiconductor in modern optoelectronics, it is not considered to be an effective THz emitter due to its low carrier drift velocity and small saturated built-in electric field from the inversion layer. Herein, we present an effective way to enhance THz generation using a graphene/Si Schottky junction (GSSJ) excited with a femtosecond laser under electrical gating without rapid saturation and with high carrier drift velocity. This mixed-dimensional van der Waals interface demonstrates large saturation pump fluence with an invalid inversion layer by removing the native oxide on the Si surface. The THz emission amplitude from GSSJ effectively increases with the gate voltage. The THz emission from GSSJ under the same excitation conditions is stronger than that from the surface of InAs (100) and GaAs (100). The results not only show an efficient THz emission from GSSJ but also demonstrate the ability of THz generation for probing the mixed-dimensional van der Waals interface.
Introduction
The dramatic growth in the number of investigations on mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures suggests new areas for the design of high-performance optoelectronic devices.1 Among them, the integration of two-dimensional (2D) semimetal graphene with three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor Si demonstrates the remarkable advantages in combining the high carrier mobility of graphene with the large carrier density of Si.2 These van der Waals interfacial devices utilize the tunable Fermi level and charge transport at the interface, at which the built-in electric field (Ed) and carrier dynamics can be tuned efficiently. The resulting unique properties such as ultra-long carrier diffusion length, large optical absorption, and dense carrier trapping have been demonstrated to be the fundamental physics processes required for high response photodetectors,3,4 solar cells,5,6 environmental sensors,7,8 and position-sensitive detectors9,10 based on the graphene/Si Schottky junction (GSSJ). Moreover, the GSSJ is cost efficient and the fabrication process is compatible with existing electronic and optoelectronic technologies, which make GSSJ attractive in the revolution of widespread traditional devices.
The use of THz as a cutting edge technology, presents many applications for material characterization, nondestructive detection, and high speed communication.11 Further development of THz technology depends on the use of efficient THz sources such as quantum cascade lasers,12 free electron lasers,13 table-top pulse THz emitters,14 and so on.15 Use of table-top pulse THz emitters has been highlighted as a low cost, easy process, and a compact integration THz source. Among them, THz generation from semiconductor surfaces and interfaces by ultrafast lasers is one of the most promising efficient THz table-top emitters for the future. Since the 1990s, group III–V semiconductors such as indium arsenide (InAs) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) have been studied extensively for use as THz emitters based on their surface emission,16–19 and can be further improved by carrier doping,20 surface modification,21 magnetic fields,22 and electric fields.23 Built-in electric field induced transient drift current was demonstrated in GaAs surface.20 A photo-Dember field induced transient photocurrent in InAs is one of the most efficient methods for THz generation at a low pump fluence.17 However, group IV semiconductor Si, which suffers from a low photocarrier density and low drift velocity in the surface depletion layer,24,25 has not yet been demonstrated as an efficient THz emitter. Because of the low cost, easy production, extensive use and the opportunity for it to be integrated with the most widespread Si-based optoelectronic and photonic systems, development of a Si-based THz source is of great importance. Methods to improve THz emission from Si depend on the heterojunction interfaces, at which Ed can be enhanced by electrical gating resulting in a long depletion layer. The Si p-i-n interface19 and the ITO/Si Schottky junction26 have been demonstrated to give obvious enhancement of THz radiation. Nevertheless, the THz emission is restricted by the electric screening by the interface inversion layer and avalanche breakdown effect,24,26 which limits the THz generation with Si.
In this work, we present an efficient THz interfacial emitter based on GSSJ under the gate voltage (Vg). Graphene as an atomically thin layer with a lower THz absorption and optical reflection than metal thin film, is covered on a Si surface as a transparent electrode. The native oxide layer at the interface was removed, and thus, the inversion layer induced screening effect is prevented and the increasing reverse Vg can continuously enhance the THz emission for several tens of volts. Strikingly, by applying −5 V Vg, the GSSJ presents stronger THz generation than that from GaAs (100), and even surpasses that from InAs (100) under −40 V Vg due to the significantly enlarged drift velocity. The results demonstrate an efficient THz generation from GSSJ, and pave the way for THz generation to probe the mixed-dimensional van der Waals interface.
Materials and methods
Graphene was grown by a chemical vapor deposition method on a copper foil substrate (6Carbon Technology). To form a mixed-dimensional van der Waals (2D–3D) heterostructure, polished n-Si (100) substrate of 1 mm thickness and doping density of 8 × 1011 cm−3 (ρ > 5000 Ω cm−1) was dipped into diluted 5% HF solution for 15 s to remove the native oxide layer. Using a wet transfer method based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) which is mentioned in section S1 (ESI†) and in a previous study,27 graphene was quickly transferred onto the Si substrate. After that, two metal ring electrodes were patterned at the front and back sides of the sample closely to the graphene and Si, respectively, to apply the gate voltage to the interface layer as shown in Fig. 1a. An insulating ring was fabricated to prevent the charge transport between the metal electrodes and the front Si surface. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the details of the structure of the device and the fabrication processes. The graphene film was characterized by visible-near infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The amplitude of the 2D mode at 2700 cm−1 is twice as large as that of the G mode at 1583 cm−1, and the D mode at 1351 cm−1 is nearly absent in the Raman spectrum (Fig. S2a, ESI†), indicating single layer high quality graphene with a low defect density. The visible-near infrared absorption is approximately 2.3% (Fig. S2b, ESI†), which also suggests that the graphene sample is monolayer graphene. The high quality monolayer graphene consists of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in a honeycomb like structure with a dangling-bond-free surface and a few functional groups will interact with Si to form a van der Waals heterostructure.1,28

Fig. 1b shows a schematic of the experimental set-up. The THz generation experiment was carried out with an incident angle of 45° in a reflection configuration. We fixed the excitation beam at p-polarization by a half-wave plate (HWP). The excitation beam diameter was 4 mm with the residual blocked by a Teflon–silicon wafer. The probe beam was also fixed in p-polarization. To identify the mechanism of THz emission, a system of wire-grid polarizers (WGP) were employed to measure both the p and s components of the emitted THz wave. More details of the experimental set-up can be found in references.29,30
Results and discussion
A comparison of the orthogonal components of the induced THz field (p- and s-polarized THz emission) from GSSJ at different pump fluences is shown in Fig. 2a. The s-polarized THz emission amplitude from GSSJ is negligible compared to the p-polarized THz radiation amplitude under oblique incidence. Additionally, the THz emission cannot be detected in the transmission configuration at normal incidence (Fig. S3, ESI†). No evident THz emission can be detected from the photon drag effect in graphene because of the low pump fluence and detection limit.31,32 These results suggest that the THz electric field component is perpendicular to the sample surface (z direction in Fig. 1a), and to the built-in electric field. The photo-Dember field33 and built-in electric field24 have been demonstrated to generate a THz signal with the z direction electric field component. For the photo-Dember field, several orders of magnitude difference in electron and hole mobility is needed.33 However, electron mobility in Si is only three times larger than the hole mobility, which is not sufficient to form a large photo-Dember field after illumination. Therefore, the built-in electric field induced transient drift photocurrent and the electric field induced optical rectification (EFIOR) and this is the mechanism of THz generation from the GSSJ, which can be expressed by:34 (1)where P refers to the nonlinear polarization from the EFIOR effect; J corresponds to the transient photocurrent; z is along the direction perpendicular to the sample surface. To distinguish the contribution from EFIOR and the transient photocurrent effect, the pump polarization dependent THz peak-to-valley amplitude was fitted as shown in Fig. 2b by ETHz = CEFIORsin2θ + Ccurrent, where Ccurrent corresponds to the transient photocurrent effect, which was independent of the pump polarization angle θ; CEFIOR refers to the magnitude of the optical rectification which depended on the value of θ. The fitting results show that there is a 21 times larger contribution to THz emission from the transient photocurrent than from the EFIOR effect, which suggests that the transient photocurrent dominates the THz emission from GSSJ. In the following experiment, as shown in Fig. 2b, the EFIOR effect was minimized by fixing the pump polarization angle at the EFIOR minimum point.

Because GaAs (100) used as THz emitters based on surface built-in electric field have been studied extensively,20,35 the THz generation from GSSJ (0 V) and GaAs (n-type without doping) were compared. As shown in Fig. S4a and S4b (ESI†), the emitted THz amplitude from GaAs is larger than that from GSSJ (0 V). The pump polarization angles of both GSSJ and GaAs were fixed to minimize the nonlinear effect. In this case, the THz emission intensity from both Si and GaAs surfaces and interfaces is directly related to the drift photocurrent in the depletion layer under built-in electric field. Weis et al.36 reported an enhanced THz modulation from the graphene/Si interface because of the accumulation of remnant photoexcited carriers with an optical gating. However, in the THz generation experiment, the THz wave is generated from graphene/Si by the temporal acceleration of photocarriers under the built-in electric field. The temporal response under illumination is discussed in section S4 (ESI†), and includes the photocarrier generation and drift-diffusion dynamics. This temporal response highlights the photocarrier generation process and drift velocity (vdrift), which dominate the transient photocurrent as:37 J = nevdrift.(2)
The drift velocity is defined as vdrift = μE(z), where μ is the carrier mobility. Hence, the lower THz generation efficiency from the Si surface compared to that of the GaAs surface is mainly due to the lower drift velocity which comes from the several times smaller carrier mobility in Si [1450 cm2 (V s)−1] than that in GaAs [8000 cm2 (V s)−1], and the lower photocarrier density contributes to the transient photocurrent as illustrated in Fig. S4c and S4d (ESI†).
In order to overcome the insufficient drift photocarriers and drift velocity, we introduced an external Vg on the GSSJ. The application of the positive Vg results in a decrease in the interface built-in electric field, and thus reduces the THz emission amplitude24,38 as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Whereas application of the reverse Vg broadens the depletion layer and so more photocarriers could contribute to the transient drift photocurrent. Under a large reverse Vg, the depletion layer width is wider than the absorption length. All the photocarriers generated in the depletion layer contribute to the transient drift current. In addition, the application of Vg increases the depletion built-in electric field (Ed), which results in a larger drift velocity. Therefore, GSSJ is expected to present more efficient THz generation with an increase in Vg. As shown in Fig. 3a, the application of the reverse Vg significantly enhances the THz generation from GSSJ at 7 μJ cm−2 excitation. As shown in Fig. 3b, the corresponding frequency-domain signals suggest broadband enhanced THz generation. In the previous study, the THz generation enhancement from graphene/SiO2/Si under reverse electrical gating would reach saturation at few volts due to the screening effect from the strong inversion layer.38 However, THz generation from GSSJ presents a nonsaturable enhancement with reverse Vg, as shown in Fig. 3c. The THz emission amplitude shows seven-fold enhancement under −5 V reverse Vg compared with that obtained without applying Vg at 7 μJ cm−2 excitation. In the time dependent measurement of THz generation at different Vg, as shown in Fig. 3d, the emitted THz peak value in the time domain signal was recorded by a lock-in amplifier as a function of time with a time constant of 300 ms. When switching on/off the reverse Vg from −1 V to −5 V, the THz signal from GSSJ exhibits a rapid response, which is different from the slow decay in the graphene/SiO2/Si system on a scale of tens of seconds.38 The rapid response of THz generation from GSSJ suggests that charge diffusion at the interface is different from that in the body of the material and also different from that at the interface with the oxide interlayer38 which indicates the advantage of van der Waals interactions between graphene and Si.

To further understand this unsaturated enhancement, the energy band structure at graphene/Si interface was considered next as shown in Fig. 4. The reverse Vg forces the positive charges (minority carriers in n-doped Si) to accumulate at the interface layer, which increases the φd. If a native oxide interlayer exists in the Schottky junction when an insulating layer exists at the interface, the large reverse Vg would result in a strong inversion in the heterostructure. In such a case, the positive charge concentration in the Si surface depletion layer is equivalent to the negative charge concentration in the bulk. The greater positive charges at the Si surface accumulate in an inversion layer adjacent to the insulating layer. The insulating layer acts as a capacitor to screen the reverse Vg, which leads to a maximum value of built-in potential and φdm as shown in Fig. 4a. In Fig. 4c, the built-in electric field is defined by E(z) = qNd(z − zD)/εrε0, where Nd is the doping concentration, and εr is the semiconductor dielectric constant. The depletion layer width zd can be defined as , where φd is the built-in electric potential of the depletion layer. While in the inversion layer, the dense accumulating charges results in a steep drop of the electric field distribution. The inversion layer is approximately 1–10 nm width,39 which is much narrower than the penetration length for the optical pump beam (∼10 μm).40 Therefore, few photocarriers generated in the inversion layer presented a negligible contribution to the transient drift current at the interface, although the electric field in the inversion layer is much larger than that in the depletion layer. The THz generation from the graphene and Si interface with an insulating layer reached saturation at −3 V Vg in a strong inversion case.38

On the contrary, screening of the external Vg by an inversion layer in the GSSJ is absent. Although formation of a ∼ 0.2 nm thick native oxide layer on the Si surface (doping density 8 × 1011 cm−3) during the graphene wet transfer process is inevitable,41 the HF treatment effectively modified the Si surface properties as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The charge tunnelling effect at the ultrathin oxide layer results in an invalid inversion layer. In this case, the increasing reverse Vg across the interface layer continuously bends the surface energy band even when the Fermi level is lower than the energy level of the conduction band at the Si surface as shown in Fig. 4b. The φd would not reach saturation,39 resulting in a continuously enlarged electric field in the depletion layer as shown in Fig. 4d, and thus, the incessant enhancement of drift velocity and THz generation amplitude. Hence, GSSJ with a mixed-dimensional van der Waals interface shows great potential as an efficient THz emitter.
To realize the performance of the GSSJ THz emitter, the Vg was further increased up to −40 V, as shown in Fig. 5a. At 7 μJ cm−2 excitation, the THz emission amplitude from GSSJ, contributed to by both the transient photocurrent and the EFIOR effect, was enhanced by 26-fold under Vg (−40 V) compared with that obtained without applying Vg (Fig. S7, ESI†). The Vg dependent THz emission amplitude can be fitted by: (3)where Agate is related to the THz emission intensity, and Vg,sat is the saturation gate voltage. The increasing THz emission amplitude reached saturation at a large reverse Vg. According to the fitted results, the saturation Vg was −29 V at different pump fluences. Under a large gate voltage, the charge tunnelling effect through the Schottky barrier junction increased the photocurrent, which attenuated the gating voltage and reduced the interfacial THz emission intensity. Further increasing the gate voltage resulted in a decrease in the THz emission amplitude, which suggests an avalanche breakdown. Pump fluence dependent THz generation amplitude from GSSJ under 0 V and −40 V Vg are shown in Fig. 5b. The results can be well fitted by a transient photocurrent-based saturation model:42 (4)where Apump is related to the THz emission intensity; F refers to the pump fluence; and Fsat corresponds to the saturation pump fluence. The saturation pump fluence Fsat is 7.5 μJ cm−2 under 0 V Vg and 20.2 μJ cm−2 under −40 V Vg. This is very important for intensive THz generation as Vg can increase the threshold of the pump fluence and the THz conversion efficiency.43

To further evaluate the GSSJ THz emitter under a large reverse Vg, it was compared with another efficient THz emitter InAs (100) based on surface emission. THz generation from InAs is caused by the photo-Dember effect,35 which is based on the transient diffusion photocurrent on the surface. Transient diffusion photocurrent on a InAs surface has been demonstrated as one of the best THz emitters among the semiconductor surfaces and interfaces.44,45 As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI),† without electrical gating, the THz generation from InAs (p-type with a doping density of 1 × 1017 cm−3) is much larger than that from GSSJ under the same pump fluence. The electron mobility in InAs is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the hole.39 In contrast, the electric field induced transient drift current in Si is much smaller due to the lower electron mobility in Si [1450 cm2 (V s)−1] compared to that in InAs [30000 cm2 (V s)−1].39 However, transient drift current in GSSJ with a sufficient external Vg is also comparable to the transient diffusion current in InAs. The THz generation amplitude from GSSJ is larger than that from InAs under the same excitation fluence of 15.6 μJ cm−2 by applying Vg (−40 V), as shown in Fig. 6a. In the frequency domain (Fig. 6b), the related THz amplitude from GSSJ is still larger than that from InAs within 0.1–0.9 THz. As an electro-optical sampling method with ZnTe (110) was employed in the detection system, the detected THz bandwidth was limited to 3 THz.43 It is worth noting that the bandwidth of GSSJ under −40 V Vg is different from that under −5 V Vg, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI).† The mechanism of THz emission from GSSJ is similar to that from the photoconductive antenna, which is caused by the free carrier acceleration within the depletion layer under the external electric field. Therefore, the depletion region is significantly broadened under −40 V Vg, resulting in a narrower THz bandwidth.46

(d) Enhanced factor of THz emission from GSSJ before (black) and after (red) exposure to air for 10 days. 
By fitting the pump dependent THz generation from GSSJ and InAs, as shown in Fig. 6c, it was found that the saturation pump fluence Fsat for InAs is 13.5 μJ cm−2, which is smaller than that for GSSJ under −40 V Vg (20.2 μJ cm−2). At 15.6 μJ cm−2 excitation, the THz emission E-field was found30 to be 119 V cm−1 for InAs and 149 V cm−1 for GSSJ. These results suggest the GSSJ with large transient drift current has great potential for strong THz source. To verify the stability of the GSSJ THz emitter, the GSSJ was exposed to air for 10 days and it worked well when it was used again, as shown in Fig. 6d, which demonstrates the good environmental stability of the GSSJ THz emitter. Moreover, the GSSJ was exposed to 42 μJ cm−2 femtosecond laser illumination at Vg = −40 V for 30 min and emitted an unchanged THz signal, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), which suggests its good working stability. Further increasing the performance of the 2D/3D THz emitter may need to reduce the necessary application of the gate voltage. As indicated in eqn (2), the THz emission amplitude from GSSJ is related to the photocarrier density and drift velocity in the depletion layer. Therefore, enhancing the pump power, high absorption light excitation (such as high photon energy light), or employing semiconductors with a larger intrinsic drift velocity as 3D substrates may be possible routes to enhance the performance of the 2D/3D THz emitter.
Conclusion
In summary, an effective interfacial THz generation based on GSSJ with a mixed-dimensional van der Waals interface has been presented. Elimination of the native oxide layer on Si nullifies the inversion capacitance at the interface. Without an available inversion layer to screen the Vg, the GSSJ interface allows significantly increased THz generation with Vg. Hence, THz generation from GSSJ can surpass traditional THz surface emitters GaAs (100) and InAs (100). These investigations not only reveal an efficient method for strongly enhanced THz generation from GSSJ, but also demonstrate the use of THz generation spectroscopy in detecting the van der Waals interface.
