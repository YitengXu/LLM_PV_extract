    , Accepted 28th May 2019First published on 30th May 2019AbstractInexhaustible solar energy has been considered as one of the most promising alternatives to traditional fossil energy. The solar energy can be captured by the solar cell, converted into electrical power and then stored in supercapacitors or batteries. Toward higher energy utilization efficiency, how to realize conversion and storage of solar energy in a combined device is becoming increasingly important. Herein, we have designed and fabricated a photo-assisted rechargeable supercapacitor by integrating photo-electrode and working electrode, thereby forming a nanoporous Cu@Cu2O (NPC@Cu2O) hybrid array electrode, which obviously increases the charge capacity. The novel nanoporous/array hybrid structure guarantees light illumination, which improves solar energy utilization efficiency. Moreover, it delivers a specific capacitance of 782 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 under illumination, which increases 37.9% of capacitance than that under dark. Moreover, the capacity increasing mechanism and kinetic analysis revealed that photo-generated holes on the Cu2O surface stimulate more active sites and promote the proton insertion into Cu2O facets. This finding provides a new path to the direct storage of the abundant solar energy.
1. Introduction
The design of energy storage devices with high energy and power densities, long-life and low-cost are highly desirable to meet the challenges of the energy crisis and environmental pollution.1–4 An electrochemical supercapacitor is very promising due to its merits of power density and ultra-long cycle life.5,6 However, the lower energy density prohibited it from playing a greater role in rapidly developing power stations.7,8 This has stimulated great interests to investigate new electrode materials or structures toward high energy density devices.9–11 Among these intensive studies, the study on introducing more active sites and improving the intrinsic energy storage capability of the present electrode materials makes for a much greener and more efficient strategy.
Photocharging or photo-assisted charging energy storage devices provide an attractive approach of realizing the utilization of unlimited solar energy.12–19 The recent progress in integrated energy generation and storage into a single device has greatly simplified the system. The working principle can be described by stating that the photo-generated holes/electrons on the photoelectrode or photo-sensitive semiconductor electrode surface participate in the battery reactions, which can decrease the charging potentials and enhance the energy efficiency. The photo-charging Li–S battery proposed by Zhou's group with a Pt/CdS photocatalyst in an aqueous polysulfide cathode demonstrates a direct solar energy storage performance.13 The photo-assist charging of Li–O2 battery, Li-ion battery, aqueous Li/Na–I2 batteries as well as supercapacitors were also successively developed to decrease the charge potential and increase energy efficiency.14–20 These breakthroughs present a bright picture for high energy efficiency batteries. However, the high-efficiency photo transportation and adsorption in an integrated electrode are still big challenges for further improving the energy density and efficiency of the devices.
The semi-conducting materials, having both photo-sensitive and pseudo-capacitive properties, become the preferred composite electrodes for photo-assisted charging devices. In order to meet these requirements, the materials should possess following properties: (1) suitable band gap (1.8–3.0 eV) to absorb more visible light, (2) low-cost and excellent transparency, (3) high separation efficiency of photo-generated holes–electrons, and (4) long life of the excited holes.21 In order to satisfy the above requirements as far as possible, many researchers have devoted their efforts to design and fabricate the composite electrode with heterogeneous core–shell nanostructures.22 The distinct nano-porous and novel double or multi-layer structure, that is, the continuous ligaments and open pores can provide continuous channels for electron and ion transportation, respectively.23–26 Moreover, the nanometer-sized and interfacial effects between the different materials in the composite electrode have been conducive to enhance the light absorption and promote the separation of holes–electrons.
Inspired by these aforementioned results, we demonstrated a photo-assist charging supercapacitor with a photo-working integrated nanoporous NPC@Cu2O hybrid arrays electrode. The integrated electrode reduced device volume and improved the electrolyte stability. Moreover, the bandgap of Cu2O is 2.1 eV, which can absorb more visible light. Interestingly, this supercapacitor displays an improved capacitance of 37.9% at 1 A g−1 under illumination. The results of the enhanced capacitance and energy efficiency revealed that the NPC@Cu2O hybrid array structure promotes the light permeation and enhances energy storage. The electrochemical performance and the kinetic analysis results demonstrate that the photo-generated holes on the Cu2O surface stimulate more active sites and promote the protons insertion into Cu2O facets. This design provides a fundamental and technological process to enhance the energy density of high-power supercapacitors by using inexhaustible solar energy.
2. Experimental details
Materials synthesis
Nanoporous Cu (NPC) materials were synthesized via a chemical dealloying method. Cu17Al83 alloy ingots were prepared by arc-melting Cu and Al with purities of 99.9 wt% in argon atmosphere. The Cu17Al83 alloy ingots were then remelted in a quartz tube by high-frequency induction heating, and then melt-spun onto a rotating copper roller to obtain Cu17Al83 alloy ribbons. The Cu17Al83 alloy ribbons were cut into 2.0 cm length and dipped into the 2.0 wt% NaOH aqueous solution. The reaction temperature was set at 303 K. The chemical dealloying procedure stopped till no longer obvious bubbles emerged. Then, the products were washed with distilled water and alcohol and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 333 K.
NPC@Cu2O hybrid arrays were prepared by electrochemical corrosion method.27,28 Specifically, 0.05 g as-synthesized NPC materials and 0.2 g cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were dispersed in 30 mL distilled water and stirred for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution. The above solution was stirred for another 2.0 hours to react completely at room temperature. Moreover, the colour of the above solution changed from transparent to brown and finally yellow. Subsequently, the acquired precipitates were harvested via centrifuging and washing several times with distilled water. The centrifuged deposits were dried overnight in 353 K vacuum, and then stored in an Ar-filled glove box.
Cu@Cu2O composites were successfully prepared via the method described above, except replacing NPC with Cu mesh (Anping County HuiRui Wiremesh Factory).
Materials characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-2500) was performed to analyze the crystal texture and phase constituents. The surface microstructures were analyzed using an ultrahigh-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Verios 460L) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS) and transmission electron microscope with a probe corrector (TEM, FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300). The chemical valences and compositions were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The compositions were evaluated using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, ICP-9000).
Fabrication of the photo-assisted chargeable supercapacitor electrode and device
To prepare the working electrode, 80% active materials (NPC@Cu2O hybrid arrays), 10% acetylene black and 10% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were dispersed in 1:1 (v/v) ethanol/N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) mixed solvent and ultrasonicated for 20 min to obtain a homogeneous ink. The special L-shaped glassy carbon (LGC) electrodes with a surface area of 1.0 cm2 were thoroughly re-cleaned with distilled water and ethanol. Then, 50 μL slurry was discreetly dripped onto the desiccative LGC electrode. Moreover, the quantity of mass loading was about 1.5 mg of the NPC@Cu2O hybrid. This mass of the NPC@Cu2O hybrid was used for calculating the specific capacitance.
The photo-assisted chargeable supercapacitor device was a 100 mL optical electrochemical cells, which was composed of working, counter (Pt electrode), and reference electrodes (saturated calomel electrode, SCE) and 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
The light source applied for the illumination was a PLS-SXE300 Xe-lamp (Perfect Light). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements of the photo-assisted chargeable supercapacitor were tested using a CHI electrochemical workstation and LAND battery test instrument (CT2001A).
3. Results and discussion
In the past decades, many semiconductors (shown in Fig. S1†) have been explored as photo-anodes for the water oxidation reaction.29–31 These semiconductors with suitable energy band gap can make full use of the visible light. Moreover, the relationship between the theoretical photo-generated current density and the energy band gap has been put forward and presented in Fig. S2.† As we can see, the theoretical photo-generated current density increases with the decrease in the energy band gap. For Cu2O, an energy band gap of 2.0–2.2 eV, possesses higher theoretical photo-generated current density than that of TiO2. Importantly, Cu2O present pseudo-capacitive behavior in aqueous alkaline electrolyte with high theoretical specific capacitance.32 Therefore, we adopted NPC@Cu2O as integrated electrode materials. The constitution of the photo-assisted chargeable supercapacitor is shown in Scheme 1. The NPC@Cu2O hybrid arrays with both photo-sensitive and pseudo-capacitive behaviors serve as the working electrode with an aqueous alkaline electrolyte. The aqueous electrolyte not only improves security but also reduces thermal effects during the period of the long-range light illumination. The mechanism of the NPC@Cu2O hybrid during charging process under light illumination involves two steps (Scheme 1). The semiconductor Cu2O creates pairs of electrons and holes under light (eqn (1)33–35) and then, the holes generated above oxidizes the Cu2O in the NPC@Cu2O hybrid to CuO (eqn (2)).36–38 Simultaneously, the corresponding photo-generated electrons, separated from the hole–electron pairs, pass through the external circuit to the counter Pt electrode, and subsequently reacts with H2O in aqueous electrolytes to generate H2 (eqn (3)). The discharging is the inverse procedure. Besides, the reaction mechanism of the NPC@Cu2O hybrid without light is shown in eqn (4). Specifically, the active material Cu2O in the NPC@Cu2O hybrid reacts with OH− ions in aqueous electrolytes to generate CuO during charging, and the discharging is the inverse process. Above all, after light illumination, the photo-generated holes upon oxidization react with Cu2O in the NPC@Cu2O hybrid, which promotes the utilization of the electrode materials and further enhances the specific capacitance.

The morphology and element distributions were carefully examined. After dealloying of Cu17Al83 ribbons in NaOH (2 wt%), quasi-two-dimensional (2D) nanoporous copper (NPC) arrays at the macro level, which possess three-dimensional (3D) network structure in the microcosm, are obtained (Fig. 1). The thickness of the 2D nanosheet and the ligament size were about 40 nm and 30 nm, respectively. Fig. 1c displays the TEM image of a single nanosheet, which further suggests the bi-continuous nanoporous structure. Furthermore, the interplanar distance from the adjacent lattice fringes labeled in the HR-TEM images was about 0.210 nm, ascribed to the (111) planes of fcc Cu. As shown in Table S1,† there remain 0.67 wt% Al, indicating that almost all Al in Cu17Al83 alloy have been etching out. Moreover, the surface of NPC is somewhat oxidized in air, resulting in O element, existing as shown in the EDS. We further processed the NPC by surface modification with CTAB. Based on the electrochemical corrosion mechanism, the Br− ions in the CTAB penetrate into NPC ligaments, take Cu atoms out and form CuBr2− ions and electrons. The electrons combine with the dissolved oxygen to generate OH−. Lastly, CuBr2− ions react with the OH− to form the Cu2O layer.39,40 After the steady Cu2O layers come into being, the diameters of the whole ligaments increase to approximately 45 nm from 38 nm of the NPC ligament (Fig. S4†). Moreover, holes and voids are generated under the Cu2O layers due to the Cu atom rearrangement, which could be distinguished from the NPC (Fig. 1b and S3†). XRD patterns of the chemical dealloyed materials before and after electrochemical corrosion are shown in Fig. 2a. Except for three characteristic peaks of NPC materials, six additional sharp peaks appear, which could be ascribed to the face-centered cubic (FCC) Cu2O. This further confirms the Cu2O components in the final electrode materials. The NPC@Cu2O hybrid arrays inherit the quasi 2D arrays of the macro and 3D porous structure of the NPC materials (Fig. 2b and c), which are in favor of enhancing the electrochemical properties. Specifically, the quasi 2D arrays contribute to the penetration of the light and reduce the available irradiation range.

The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) displayed in the inset of Fig. 2d implies that the polycrystalline NPC and Cu2O phases coexisted. Two different types of lattice fringes are identified via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), which could be assigned to Cu and Cu2O (Fig. 2e). The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of the NPC@Cu2O hybrid arrays is shown in Fig. 2f. The Cu2O layer uniformly coated on the NPC ligaments, while the composite maintained the unique micro-structure adequately. Fig. 2f displays the EDS mappings of Cu and O elements derived from the NPC@Cu2O hybrid arrays. As displayed, element O can be found on the surface of the ligaments, while element Cu is distributed evenly and maintains a 3D network structure throughout the materials, which is brought into correspondence with the XRD results. The composition of NPC@Cu2O was evaluated by ICP-OES. The Cu amount in the NPC@Cu2O hybrid, confirmed by the ICP-OES, was about 87.72 wt%. So, the mass percent of NPC in the NPC@Cu2O hybrid was theoretically calculated to be about 9.09 wt%. In order to further confirm the composition ratio, the EDS measurement was conducted, and the EDS results are displayed in Table S2.† The mass percent of Cu was about 89.91 wt%, which was close to the ICP-OES results. Thus, the mass percentages of NPC and Cu2O in the NPC@Cu2O hybrid were 9.09 wt% and 89.91 wt%, respectively.
A special three-electrode electrochemical cell was adopted to evaluate the electrochemical performances of the NPC@Cu2O electrodes with and without light illumination (100 mW cm−2, xenon lamp). The CV curves of the NPC@Cu2O electrodes at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 are depicted in Fig. 3a. Obviously, they both have a pair of redox peaks with similar shape regardless of the light status. The peak current increases, while the voltage gaps (ΔV) decrease under illumination, which suggests that the NPC@Cu2O electrode possesses enhanced specific capacitance and energy storage capability. Upon increasing the scan rate to 50 mV s−1, a similar phenomenon was observed (Fig. S4†), which manifests that the light illumination has a crucial influence on the pseudo-capacitance behavior. The detailed CV curves at various scan rates with and without illumination are displayed in Fig. 3b and S5,† respectively. No matter whether the light is on or off, the peak current and the voltage separation increases, while the specific capacitances decrease as the number of scan rates increases (Table S3†). Fig. S7a† shows the CV curves of the NPC@Cu2O electrodes under various light intensities. We again note that the shapes of the CV curves are almost the same, but the capacitance increments show a little change (Fig. S6b and Table S4†), which further confirm the positive impacts of the solar light on the energy storage process. Similarly, the CV curves of NPC@Cu2O hybrid arrays under the light with various wavelengths are depicted in Fig. S6c.† The enclosed areas of CV curves and the peak current densities increase gradually with the decrease in wavelengths from 700 to 300 nm (Fig. S6d†), suggesting the significant effect of the wavelengths on the specific capacitance of the NPC@Cu2O hybrid.

(d) Galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles at different current densities under light illumination. (e) The cycling stability of the NPC@Cu2O electrode by charge/discharge measurement at 10 A g−1 in dark condition. 
The capacitance increment was also confirmed by the GCD profiles, as presented in Fig. 3c. Like the CV curves, the charge voltage under light-on condition was lower than that of light-off and opposite when discharging, which demonstrate the decreased over-potentials both for discharging and charging. After light illumination, the specific capacitances have enhanced from 567 to 782 F g−1 in response to the extended charge/discharge times at the same current density of 1 A g−1 (Table S5†). Exceptionally, the energy utilization efficiency has been improved to a certain extent. Rate performances were studied as shown in Fig. 3d and S7.† Notably, there is a trend that the specific capacitance and discharge time decreases with increasing current density under light illumination. The above trend has been brought into correspondence with the traditional supercapacitors, namely that without light. The capacitance increment decreases from 37.9% to 26.6% when the current density increases from 1 to 10 A g−1, on account of lower utilization percentage of the NPC@Cu2O electrode at higher charge/discharge current density.41–43 The trend is also appropriate for the Cu@Cu2O composite (Fig. S8 and Tables S6 and S7†) although the capacitance increment was less than that of NPC@Cu2O hybrid.
The cycling stability of supercapacitor is also an important parameter for its practical applications. The cycling performance of the NPC@Cu2O electrode without light is displayed in Fig. 3e. The capacitance retention can reach up to 99.5% after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1, suggesting its excellent cyclic stability. Under illumination, the photo-assisted supercapacitor can exhibit 254.8 F g−1 throughout, retaining 81.1% capacitance with respect to the initial capacitance (Fig. S9†). Considering the working hours of the Xe lamp, the cycle number of the photo-assisted supercapacitor is only 400, which will be prolonged with the development of the technology. As it is well-known, the temperature of the electrolyte would rise on exposure to light, while the temperature has a crucial effect on the specific capacitance. To eliminate the above concern, the measurement involves alternating rounds of light-off and on. The specific capacitance presents an obvious increment as the light is turned on (Fig. S10†), implying the influences of the light illumination on the charging–discharging process.
To understand clear what the vital mechanism for the capacitance increment is, the contrast experiment has been conducted (Fig. 4). By contrast, the light illumination solely affects the charging process. We can thus draw the conclusion that the solar light assists the charging procedure. The energy storage mechanism of the novel NPC@Cu2O electrode comprises surface redox reactions and double electrical layers theory.5,8,44–46 According to the literature,19,47 the Qsurface values of the NPC@Cu2O electrode, under light illumination and no illumination, are 0.28C and 0.413C, respectively. Similarly, the Qpseudo values under the light-on and off are 37.39C and 55.86C, respectively (Fig. S11†). Meanwhile, the Qpseudo values are much larger than that of Qsurface values, suggesting that the surface redox reaction plays a leading role in the energy storage procedure. Hence, the capacitance increment is caused by pseudo-capacitive behavior under light illumination.

XPS measurement was performed to distinguish the accurate charging products of the NPC@Cu2O electrodes under light illumination or no illumination (Fig. 5). The Cu 2p spectra of the fresh electrode show two main peaks with a little low-intensity satellite, which is completely consistent with the Cu+ species in Cu2O material (Fig. 5a). The main peaks located at 932.5 eV and 952.5 eV can be assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peak, respectively, in Cu2O.39,40 However, some changes in the Cu 2p spectra have taken place after charging. First, the peaks of the Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 move to 933.7 eV and 953.5 eV, respectively, belonging to the Cu2+ species in CuO.48,50,51 Second, the stronger intensities of satellite peaks is another feature of the Cu2+ in the form of CuO material. Third, the shapes and positions of the peaks are almost identical, while the peak intensities and areas are totally disparate. The area under curve has increased by 21.5% with light, implying that the CuO production improves. The O 1s spectra of the different electrodes are shown in Fig. 5b. The peak position of the O 1s moves from 530.3 eV (Cu2O) to 530.4 eV (CuO) after charging.48–50 Interestingly, the changing trends of the peak intensity and area from dark to light were consistent with the Cu 2p spectra. The above results can be ascribed to the high utilization ratio of active material in the NPC@Cu2O electrode. In other words, more protons induced by light are used to oxidize the active materials Cu2O to CuO, contributing to enhanced capacitance. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping of the charged product under light illumination displays that Cu0, Cu+, and Cu2+ species distribute almost in the form of core–shell structure (Fig. 5c–e). In addition, Cu2+ species located in the outermost shell are formed during charging, which further verifies the reaction mechanism, thereby confirming the occurrence of pseudo-capacitance on the electrode surface.

Other than the reported photo-rechargeable supercapacitor, which makes a combination of solar cell and supercapacitor, the present novel photo-assisted supercapacitor can directly store solar energy in one device without any solar module. The core part of the device is the semi-conducting NPC@Cu2O electrode, which has both photo-sensitive and pseudo-capacitive properties. The capacitance of the NPC@Cu2O electrode has improved greatly after light illumination. Moreover, the low-cost Cu materials and facile synthetic procedure facilitate its practical applications.
Conclusions
In brief, the novel energy storage device (the photo-assisted supercapacitor), was realized by integrating the photo-sensitive electrode and pseudo-capacitive electrode into NPC@Cu2O hybrid arrays. The solar power could be quickly captured and directly stored in supercapacitors, which differed from the previous system in terms of employed solar cells. The photo-assisted supercapacitor delivers 782 F g−1 and 314 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively, thereby achieving 37.9% and 26.6% capacitance increment in comparison to the dark condition. The capacitance increment mechanism was verified by the XPS and EELS results. Meanwhile, the device exhibited excellent cycling stability under light illumination. Thus, the concept of direct storing solar energy will open up a new way of solar energy utilization, improving the total performance of the supercapacitors.
