    , Accepted 27th March 2019First published on 27th March 2019AbstractDespite the low-cost and moderate-temperature fabrication process of inverted planar perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), the relatively low efficiency (<20%), inferior reproducibility and poor stability significantly hinder their great potential for future commercialization. To address these issues, here we introduce a novel, economic and efficient hydrophilic group (C–O & CO) grafted buffer layer (HGGBL) on a non-wetting hole transporting material (HTM) for perovskite formation. This approach of introducing the buffer layer with grafted hydrophilic groups leads to a decrease in the surface potential and surface tension force of the non-wetting HTM, facilitating the nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals. Also importantly, the carbonyl groups tightly bond with the perovskite via Lewis base sites, leading to a dense, smooth, pinhole-free perovskite film with bulk defects being passivated. Benefiting from these merits, the photovoltaic performance is dramatically boosted from 17.42% to 20.75%, which is among the highest efficiencies of inverted planar PVSCs. In addition, the PVSCs with the HGGBL exhibit excellent reproducibility with negligible hysteresis and superior humidity stability. This work validates that the HGGBL is a promising approach for growing perovskite films on non-wetting layers for both high-performance solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.

Broader context
The inverted planar perovskite device architecture is promising for flexible photovoltaic devices and tandem solar cells, due to its low temperature fabrication and short process time. The state-of-the-art effective hole transport material (HTM) used in such devices is mainly the extremely hydrophobic PTAA, and it is a big challenge to achieve satisfactory deposition of the perovskite film on it. In order to solve this problem, this work introduces and investigates an efficient ozone plasma treated hydrophilic group grafted buffer layer (HGGBL) on the non-wetting PTAA. This HGGBL decreases the surface potential and surface tension, and a high quality and uniform perovskite film with fewer bulk defects is deposited. Moreover, the hydrophilic carbonyl groups of the HGGBL can tightly bond with the perovskite film to passivate interfacial defects. Consequently, the solar cell efficiency is boosted from 17.4% to 20.7%, close to the highest efficiency of inverted planar perovskite solar cells. Besides, the photovoltaic devices with the HGGBL also show superior reproducibility, negligible hysteresis, and improved humidity stability. This introduction of an ozone plasma treated HGGBL can be a promising method for the realization of uniform and pinhole-free perovskite film growth on non-wetting layers and achieving highly efficient photovoltaic devices.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted great interest as promising candidates for third generation solar cells due to their tuneable composition with appealing properties, such as a large absorption coefficient, small exciton binding energy, long carrier diffusion length, etc.1–3 Due to the efforts devoted to architecture design, composition engineering and transporting material exploration, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSC) has been boosted over 23%, surpassing the record of conventional silicon based solar cells.4–6 PVSCs with the record PCEs are fabricated based on a normal mesoporous architecture, namely, front electrode (FTO)/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/hole-transporting material (HTM: spiro-OMeTAD)/rear electrode (Au).7,8 However, the fabrication of mesoporous structure PVSCs requires repeated sintering of TiO2 at high temperature (500 °C) and overnight oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD, which is not favourable for light and flexible solar cells in addition to its high energy consumption and prolonged process duration.9
In contrast with the mesoporous architecture, PVSCs with an inverted planar structure (with the HTM at the bottom) have great potential for commercialization due to its advantages of moderate temperature fabrication (100 °C), shorter process time and inconspicuous hysteresis.9,10 However, the development of inverted planar PVSCs is significantly limited by the lower efficiency, inferior reproducibility and notorious stability, which are determined by the HTM and the quality of the perovskite film on top. Recently, poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) with proper energy level alignment, efficient carrier transport and mitigation of bulk defect activities has been used as a HTM to replace the widely used PEDOT:PSS for relatively better device performance.11 Compared with PEDOT:PSS, the main contribution of PTAA for PVSCs is the greatly boosted Voc.12,13 However, the fill factor (FF) of PTAA based PVSCs is generally inferior due to the recombination loss induced by the unsatisfactory perovskite growth,14,15 which originates from the high hydrophobicity (∼100° contact angle for PTAA, as compared with ∼10° for highly reproducible PEDOT:PSS).16 The non-wetting (non-polar) PTAA has less affinity for the polar perovskite precursor solution and it is tricky to achieve identical perovskite films on top even with the same recipe.17–19 Therefore, the perovskite grown on non-wetting layers also leads to inferior device reproducibility.18,20
To alleviate this non-wetting issue, three methods have been exploited for perovskite growth on non-wetting PTAA: an annealing-assisted inter-diffusion method,16,21 surfactant addition engineering22 and a pre-wetting method.12,23 The annealing-assisted inter-diffusion method is generally designed for a single phase of MAPbI3 or FAPbI3. Employing this method for mixed perovskite phase films, such as triple cation and double halide perovskite materials, which generally exhibit outstanding device performance,24,25 is not successful. Surfactant addition engineering requires an ultra-small amount of doping, which needs to be controlled carefully.22 As for the pre-wetting method, the DMF solvent is generally used to wet the PTAA layer prior to the deposition of the perovskite precursor. However, the DMF would evaporate quickly and the deposited perovskite solution would diffuse into the residual layer. This would induce non-uniform nuclei for perovskite growth, ultimately leading to irreproducible PVSCs.26
Herein, we introduce a novel non-destructive hydrophilic group (C–O and CO) grafting buffer layer (HGGBL) to bridge the perovskite and PTAA. Dual functions were discovered of the HGGBL for perovskite growth: (1) the surface potential of PTAA has been decreased to have more affinity for the deposition of the perovskite polar precursor solution; and (2) the CO bonding plays the role of Lewis base sites to firmly integrate the PTAA with perovskite crystals. As a result, a smooth, dense and pinhole-free perovskite film with improved crystallinity has been achieved, which exhibited fewer non radiative recombination centres, as supported by various optical and electronic characterization. The photovoltaic performance is greatly enhanced from 17.42% with a Jsc of 21.75 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.08 V and a FF of 74.08% to 20.75% with a Jsc of 23.05 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.12 V and a FF of 80.32%, which is approaching the highest performance of inverted planar PVSCs of 20.91% using SSG-G above the perovskite layer.12 It is also found that the photovoltaic hysteresis is almost eliminated and the device performance becomes more reproducible. In addition, the moisture stability is also prolonged: ∼70% of the initial PCE for the target devices versus ∼40% of the initial PCE for the control devices in air with 50% relative humidity for 7 days. It is believed that this facile, economic, and efficient HGGBL strategy can open a new route for perovskite deposition on non-wetting layers to achieve more satisfactory photovoltaic performance in PVSCs and other optoelectronic devices.
Results and discussion
Device architecture and photovoltaic performance
The inverted planar PVSC architecture investigated in this study is described in Fig. S1a (ESI†). The functional materials were deposited layer by layer as depicted in the experimental methods. The corresponding energy level of each layer is shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†) to confirm efficient extraction and transfer of carriers, according to our UPS characterization and previous reports.27,28
In order to ameliorate the hydrophobicity of the PTAA surface, we firstly graft the hydrophilic groups directly on PTAA through an ultraviolet ozone (UVO) treatment, following several reports on non-wetting surface modification of poly-TPD, NiOx, MoOx and WOx.17,29,30 Based on the analysis of the photovoltaic performance in Fig. S2 and Table S1 in the ESI,† it is found that the UVO treatment improves the photovoltaic performance very limitedly because of the serious structural degradation of PTAA due to the high energy of the UV light (see Fig. S3, ESI†). In other words, the energy of UV light (648 kJ mol−1 for 184.9 nm)31 to bombard oxygen molecules for the generation of ozone plasma is high enough to break the bonds of C–C (347 kJ mol−1), C–N (305 kJ mol−1) and CC (611 kJ mol−1) of PTAA.32 Therefore, we design a homemade chamber to shield the UV light but keep the ozone plasma and atomic oxygen generated circulating inside to modify the surface properties of PTAA.
Through the ozone plasma treatment, we successfully graft the hydrophilic groups on the surface of PTAA. Fig. S5 and Table S2 (ESI†) present the detailed statistics of devices parameters with varying ozone plasma treatment duration. With the ozone plasma treatment duration increased to 20 s for hydrophilic group grafting (HGG), the champion PCE for the HGG device (named Target #1) is recorded as 19.67% with a Jsc of 22.91 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.08 V and a FF of 0.79 (see Fig. 1b), exhibiting a 12.94% improvement relative to the control device with a PCE of 17.42% (named Control #1, shown in Fig. 1a). In Fig. 1c, steady-state current densities of 19.19 mA cm−2 and 22.05 mA cm−2 are obtained at the maximum power point (MPP) shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), corresponding to PCEs of 17.08% and 19.62% for Control #1 and Target #1, respectively. The stabilized power outputs for both Control #1 and Target #1 agree with the efficiencies derived from the J–V curves and exhibit superior measurement stability for 300 s, indicating the accuracy of the obtained PCE. Despite the obvious efficiency improvement, it should be noted that the hysteresis phenomenon becomes severe after HGG treatment. In comparison with the J–V curves in Fig. 1a, the J–V curves in Fig. 1b display larger mismatch when measuring in the forward and backward scan directions. The hysteresis degrees, evaluated using the hysteresis index (HI) as shown in eqn (1) below,33,34 are calculated as 0.0273 and 0.1119 for Control #1 and Target #1, respectively. In addition, Target #1 presents a slower photocurrent rise to the maximum value relative to Control #1 (see Fig. 1c), in accordance with the hysteresis phenomenon. We posit that the severe hysteresis stems from the interfacial traps and capacitance35,36 induced by surface change of the functional layer PTAA during HGG (discussed in the following part). Besides, it should be noted that a long HGG process will not only cause hysteresis but also seriously degrade the performance to 12.12% (see Table S2, ESI†) due to the irretrievable structural degradation of PTAA shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). (1)

To eliminate the hysteresis, we coated an ultra-thin buffer layer of PMMA on PTAA since PMMA is an insulating material with carbonyl groups that can facilitate passivation of interfacial traps and reduce hysteresis.37 Likewise, we ozone-treated the PMMA coated PTAA for 20 s for HGG on the buffer layer (named HGGBL) and found that the PCE could further be boosted to 20.75% (named Target #2) with a Jsc of 23.06 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.12 V and a FF of 0.80 as shown in Fig. 1e. The efficiency of the Target #2 device is among the highest efficiencies in the field of inverted planar PVSCs.12,20 To verify the main contribution of HGG for the improved device performance rather than the PMMA buffer layer, we also fabricated a photovoltaic device based on PMMA coated PTAA without HGG (named Control #2) for comparison. Fig. 1d shows the champion Control #2 device, which has a PCE of 18.46% with a Jsc of 22.77 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.10 V and a FF of 0.74, lower than the recorded PCE for the Target #2 device. More importantly, the Target #2 device exhibits negligible hysteresis with a HI of 0.0034, much smaller than the counterpart of 0.0127 for Control #2, 0.1119 for Target #1 and 0.0273 for Control #1. Both the Target #2 and Control #2 devices measured at the voltage of the MPP (determined in Fig. S7, ESI†) exhibit a fast response and measurement stability for over 300 s (see Fig. 1f), corresponding to the efficiency derived from J–V curves and observed hysteresis.
To examine the reproducibility of the device performance, 35 devices for both Control #1 and Target #1 were fabricated and statistically plotted in Fig. 2a. The histogram distribution of Control #1 is consistent with the Gaussian kernel with a mean PCE of 15.47% and a standard deviation of 1.05. With HGG, more reproducible devices concentrate in the higher PCE range with an average PCE of 18.83% and a smaller standard deviation of 0.66 is obtained. Because the enhanced PCE is mainly rooted in the ascendant FF, we also plot the distribution of the FF for both Control #1 and Target #1 in Fig. 2c. The more concentrated distributions of PCE and FF for Target #1 confirm the effectiveness of HGG for the performance enhancement. Like the HGG devices, the HGGBL device also displays a more concentrated distribution in the high PCE and large FF range recorded using 30 devices (see Fig. 2b and d). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding devices are depicted in Fig. 2e and the tendency of the integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves is consistent with the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves, further confirming the accuracy of our device efficiency characterization and the validity of HGG and the HGGBL.

(e) IPCE spectra of the devices. (f) Frequency (f)-dependent capacitance (C) of devices measured in the dark in a frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 Hz with an external applied voltage of 10 mV. 
In order to explore the mechanism for the hysteresis elimination, frequency dependent capacitance (C–F) characterization in a large range38 from 1 MHz to 1 Hz was conducted. As shown in Fig. 2f, a stark reduced capacitance to 3.743 × 10−7 F for Target #2 in the small frequency range is observed, compared with a capacitance of 2.621 × 10−6 F, 4.771 × 10−6 F, and 2.117 × 10−5 F for Control #2, Control #1 and Target #1, respectively. Normally, the capacitance generated by electrode (carrier transporting materials) polarization at low frequency (∼1 Hz) is around 10−6 F (corresponding to the Control devices in this work), which is correlated with the chemically reactive sites at interfaces.39 The Target #1 device shows a 1 order of magnitude higher capacitance than the Control devices, indicating more reactive sites induced by HGG. The reactive sites are assumed to be correlated with the F4-TCNQ doped sites within PTAA. Although the F4-TCNQ dopant can improve the conductivity of PTAA,21 it also affects the film quality due to the conjugated polymer conformation and packing phenomenon.40,41 With the bombardment of ozone molecules during HGG, the F4-TCNQ doped sites within PTAA may be affected and form reactive sites for charge accumulation, similar to the solvent soaking effect on F4-TCNQ doped PTAA.18 In order to verify this, we fabricated devices without F4-TCNQ doping in PTAA (to differentiate the device using F4-TCNQ doped PTAA, the devices using pure PTAA are named Control * and Target *). As expected, the Target *1 device exhibits the same order of magnitude hysteresis as Control *1, Control *2 and Target *2 (see Fig. S9, ESI†). Integrated with the analysis of the device performance of Control #1, 2 and Target #1, 2, it is concluded that the buffer layer of PMMA can protect the F4-TCNQ doped sites on the PTAA surface from bombardment to suppress the formation of reactive sites and reduce the interfacial traps, and thus reduce the capacitance for hysteresis reduction. In addition, the HGGBL can tightly bond with the perovskite and facilitate the perovskite growth (we will discuss clearly in a later section), consequently further reducing the capacitance and alleviating the charge accumulation35,39,42 at the interface between the perovskite and HTMs. The interfacial buffer layer together with the perfected perovskite growth synergistically contributes to the hysteresis elimination.
Apart from the hysteresis elimination, another merit of this work is the obvious FF improvement for the evident PCE enhancement (regardless of the use of F4-TCNQ as a dopant or not). In order to understand the underlying mechanism of this improvement, various characterizations were conducted in terms of the surface modification of the HTM layer, the interface between the perovskite and the HTM, the perovskite growth and the device physics. For concise comprehension, we split all the samples and devices into two sets: Target #1 versus Control #1 and Target #2 versus Control #2 for comparison to show the effect of HGG. Furthermore, the optimal device Target #2 will also be analysed in contrast with Group #1 to further understand the merit and rationale behind the HGGBL for the p-i-n device.
Surface modification through HGG on HTMs
In order to demonstrate the effect of surface modification through HGG on HTMs (PTAA coated with and without the buffer layer), the surface potentials were firstly tested by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and are presented in Fig. 3a–d. It should be noted that the surface potential value is not the absolute value but the potential of the surface relative to the probe tip, that is, the contact potential difference (VCPD). A change in VCPD values is commonly used to estimate the variation of the surface dipole, work function and surface wetting properties.43 Compared with the control HTMs (Control #1: 23.44 mV and Control #2: −23.21 mV), the corresponding target HTMs exhibit lower VCPD values (Target #1: −130.89 mV and Target #2: −187.97 mV). As a result of the lower surface potential value, the surface tension force should be reduced,44,45 which is also consistent with the contact angle (CA) measurement shown in Fig. S10a–d (ESI†). The decreased CA indicates the higher affinity of the perovskite precursor solution to the HTM surface, thus resulting in a better morphology of the perovskite layer, which will be discussed in the following section.

XPS spectra of (e) element C and (f) element O of Control #1 and Target #1 PTAA film and (g) element C and (h) element O of Control #2 and Target #2 PMMA-coated PTAA film. The chemical structures of PTAA and PMMA are shown as the insets in e and g, respectively. 
To understand the origin of the reduced surface potential value and decreased CA, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyse the surface chemical composition and structure modification. The full XPS spectra are illustrated in Fig. S11 (ESI†), revealing that the oxygen amount of the HTMs has increased during the process of HGG. The C 1s signal of the pristine PTAA film is shown in the left part of Fig. 3e, which can be deconvoluted into four peaks, corresponding to C–H (named C(1)), C–C/CC (named C(2)), C–N (named C(3)) and a shake-up peak (named C(4)) at 284.46 eV, 284. 56 eV, 285.36 eV and 291.36 eV, respectively.46 After HGG, all the four peaks are shifted to higher binding energies (284.51 eV for C(1), 284.78 eV for C(2), 285.68 eV for C(3) and 291.48 for C(4)), suggesting that carbon atoms in PTAA have been activated to more oxidized states. In addition, a peak located at 286.01 eV is also observed, corresponding to oxidized carbon states (C–O/CO bonding). This oxidation phenomenon becomes more evident when increasing the HGG duration to 120 s, as presented in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The oxidation phenomenon is also confirmed by a clear absorbed oxygen peak at 532.98 eV for PTAA with HGG, as presented in Fig. 3f, in stark comparison with the minor peak of the pristine PTAA film. The oxidation of carbon for the HGG forms CO polar dipoles on the surface of the non-wetting PTAA, which are correlated with the reduction of the surface potential value and surface tension force. Less surface tension force can generate more nuclei for perovskite deposition, growth and coverage.30 Except for the benefit for perovskite deposition, we also explore the effect of the chemical structure change of PTAA caused by HGG on the hole extraction and transport; J–V plots of hole-only devices were fabricated following previous reported methods.47,48 As shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the PTAA film with 20 s HGG exhibits identical hole transport J–V curves to the pristine PTAA, while the PTAA film with prolonged HGG treatment (120 s) shows decreased hole transporting capability. The recorded J–V curves correspond to their chemical structure change and imply the unaffected hole transport of PTAA treated with the optimized HGG.
For the HGGBL on PTAA films, a similar oxidization phenomenon is observed. Specifically, Fig. 3g illustrates that all C peaks are shifted to a higher binding energy region and an additional COO− peak49 appears with HGG on the buffer layer PMMA. Fig. 3h clarifies that more oxidized oxygen accounts for the higher oxygen ratio, illustrating the origin of the decreased surface potential and surface tension force,17,49 similar to the PTAA with HGG. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was carried out to investigate the change of work function induced by HGG. As revealed in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the HTMs (Target #2 and Target #1) after HGG exhibit deeper work functions relative to the vacuum level and larger ionization energies (IE). As discussed above, after HGG, the oxygen molecules are absorbed (as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S11, ESI†). The absorbed oxygen molecules possess strong ability to withdraw electrons from the PTAA due to the larger electron affinity of oxygen.50 In addition, the absorbed oxygen molecules form CO dipoles, which can lift the HOMO level towards high-binding energy.51 As a result of the oxygen absorption and dipole formation, the work function is increased, similarly to the work function change of NiOx30 and PEDOT:PSS51 treated with UVO. The enhanced work function is consistent with the observed VCDP change revealed by KPFM, which re-confirms the correctness of the surface potential change caused by HGG. The deeper work function and valence band of the HTMs are beneficial for the energy alignment with the perovskite layer (see the purple curve in Fig. S10, ESI†), thus contributing to a higher Voc of the devices.34,52 At the end, UV-vis characterization was also performed to explore the influence of the HGG process on the optical properties of the HTMs. The UV-vis spectra presented in Fig. S14 (ESI†) indicate that the HTMs can still keep high transmission regardless of the methods and duration of the treatment, which can guarantee no extra light loss for a high PCE.
Perovskite growth on HTMs with HGG
Several previous studies have illustrated the function of an insulating polymer such as PMMA and PS in perovskite formation and defect passivation.53 It has been clearly verified that the carbonyl group (CO) in PMMA can tightly interact with PbI2 and MA+ of perovskites.53,54
The main contribution of the carbonyl group has been revealed as due to the tendency of the Lewis base sites of the oxygen atom to associate with perovskite compounds.55 In our study, the HGG on the HTMs increases the CO ratios as discussed above, which also ought to increase the bonding with the perovskite. Therefore, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed and is shown in Fig. 4. The CO bond does not appear in the PTAA–perovskite adduct but emerges in the PTAA–perovskite system with HGG, in accordance with the XPS result. The ν(CO) in the buffer layer of PMMA appeared at 1729.81 cm−1 and shifted to 1719.69 cm−1 with the addition of the perovskite, suggesting bonding with the perovskite, similar to previous reports.39,49 When the perovskite is integrated with the HGGBL, the CO bond is further shifted to 1712.46 cm, which indicates a tighter bond between the perovskite and HGGBL. This tight bonding can also passivate the interfacial defects within the perovskite and facilitate the nucleation of the perovskite.53

Another effect of the HGG on the HTMs is the reduction of surface tension force, as discussed above, which may influence the perovskite nucleation and growth on the bottom HTMs. Fig. 5 presents SEM and AFM morphologies of the perovskite films coated on the HTMs. The pinhole morphology for the Control #1 perovskite is captured and shown in Fig. 6a, while pinhole-free morphologies are recorded for all Target #1, Control #2 and Target #2 perovskite films. The pinhole morphology may arise from the highly hydrophobic PTAA surface (90.3° CA in Fig. S9a, ESI†). Both Control #1 and Control #2 exhibit similar crooked and undulating grain morphologies (Fig. 5a and c), similar to previous reports that the PMMA coating will not obviously affect the morphology and bulk defects of perovskites.55 Compared with the Control perovskite films, the Target perovskite films exhibit more uniform and dense morphologies (Fig. 5b and d). The surface morphology and roughness are further studied using AFM characterization. As illustrated in the insets of Fig. 5a–d, the roughness (RMS value) is decreased from 14.579 nm (Control #1) to 10.062 nm (Target #2) and smoothened from 12.603 nm (Control #2) to 10.075 nm (Target #2), in line with the SEM observation. Denser and smoother perovskite morphologies would contribute to fewer defects and result in an improvement in the PCE, which will be thoroughly analysed in a later section based on more abundant characterization.

In order to further understand the perovskite growth on HTMs with HGG, we depicted the schematic representations shown in Fig. 5e and f based on previous reports16,56 and our experimental observations. To deposit the perovskite film on the hydrophobic PTAA surface, the universally exploited method is the pre-wetting method using DMF solvent (Control perovskite formation).12,28 However, the DMF solvent evaporates quickly during the pre-wetting process (5k rotation for 30 s) and left a very thin but discontinuous DMF layer on PTAA, as depicted in Fig. 5e. Moreover, DMF solvent is a commonly used solvent to prepare perovskite solutions, and the dropped perovskite precursor solution diffuses into the left discrete DMF layer. After spin-coating and dropping the anti-solvent, a randomly dispersed perovskite nuclei layer is formed.26,57 Once annealed, a rough and undulating perovskite film with pinholes will be frequently formed. In contrast with the conventional method, the PTAA with HGG displays a decreased surface contact angle and slightly increased carbonyl group ratios as discussed above. The perovskite solution can spread on the whole PTAA film, as shown in Fig. 5f. Meanwhile, the carbonyl group also provides a tight bond with the perovskite solute as discussed above. In addition, the HTL films exhibit slightly increased roughness (Fig. S15, ESI†), which can improve the contact surface area for the perovskite on the HTL.34 Benefiting from these three aspects, a more homogeneous and uniform perovskite nuclei layer is obtained for an ultimately high quality perovskite film. Fig. S16 (ESI†) also clearly shows the apparent film quality improvement of our Target perovskite film, as compared with the Control perovskite film and the perovskite directly grown on PTAA.
Several previous reports illustrate that a less-wetting surface of PTAA or poly-TPD can facilitate large-grain perovskite growth due to less heterogeneous perovskite nuclei when compared with the hydrophilic surface of PEDOT:PSS.16,17 Larger-grain size perovskite possesses fewer grain boundaries, thus contributing to a higher photovoltaic performance.16,58 The magnified SEM images in Fig. S17 (ESI†) illustrate that the grain sizes of the perovskite of the Target samples are comparable to the Control samples, which will not generate excessive grain boundaries. The similar grain size is because the surface contact angles of the ozone treated HTMs are still over 75° (see Fig. S9b and d, ESI†), much larger than the contact angle of 10° of PEDOT:PSS for smaller grain size perovskite growth.16 Besides, the SEM displayed morphology is usually correlated with the crystallinity of the perovskite. Hence, XRD characterization was performed and is shown in Fig. S18a (ESI†). All perovskite films demonstrate an identical CsFAMA perovskite phase59 with an additional peak at 11.6° originating from the overdose of PbI2 in the perovskite precursor solution to decorate the grain boundaries, following previous studies.60,61 As summarized in Fig. S18b (ESI†) derived from the XRD patterns, the characteristic peaks of the CsFAMA perovskite on the HTMs with HGG show higher intensities and smaller FWHMs than the reference samples, indicating higher crystallinity for the Target perovskite samples. The improved crystallinity, together with the denser SEM morphologies, is beneficial for defects reduction within the perovskite films and more excellent optoelectronic properties, thus resulting in remarkably improved photovoltaic performance.58
Optical properties, electrical properties and defect passivation
It has been revealed that the quality of a perovskite film generally determines its optical properties.56,58 The UV-vis absorption spectra, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) curves and time resolved PL for the two sets of perovskite films were obtained. The UV-vis spectra in Fig. 6a illustrate enhanced light absorption of the Target perovskite samples, as compared with the corresponding Control perovskite samples. The improved absorption is attributed to the better crystallinity and full coverage of the perovskite film, which ultimately contributes to a larger Jsc of devices.56,58 The PL peaks in Fig. 6b of all perovskite samples appear close to the band edge of the CsFAMA perovskite. A significant PL intensity improvement with a narrower peak width and a slight blue shift to short wavelength are observed in the Target perovskite films, which indicates fewer defects and non-radiative recombination.36,58 PL mapping was further conducted to investigate the spatial distribution of the PL counts of the excited perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S19 and S20 (ESI†), the PL counts are homogeneously boosted for the whole surface of the Target perovskites, in contrast to the Control perovskites. This uniform spatial PL intensity improvement confirms the homogeneous recombination centre reduction within the full perovskite film.

Fig. 6c and d present the transient photoluminescence (TrPL) to further estimate the information associated with the recombination centres with the perovskite crystalline films. After fitting with an exponential function, the carrier lifetimes (τ) are calculated as 31.95 ns, 53.40 ns, 119.73 ns and 146.48 ns for the Control #1, Target #1, Control #2 and Target #2 perovskite samples, respectively. It should be noted that the ultrathin insulating PMMA not only passivates the interfacial defects of the perovskite films, but also impedes the charge transfer and extraction from the perovskite to the transport layer.62,63 Impacted by these dual functions of PMMA, the Control #2 perovskite exhibits much higher PL intensity and a longer charge lifetime than the Control #1 perovskite. Reflected in the device performance, an enhanced Voc but a reduced FF is usually recorded for the introduced PMMA devices,55,63 consistent with the photovoltaic performance of the Control #1 and Control #2 devices in this work. Comparing both Target perovskites with their corresponding Control perovskites, we can find that the charge lifetimes are both greatly increased, indicating lower trap densities and fewer recombination centres in the target perovskite due to the obvious quality improvement. Benefiting from the reduced defects and increased charge lifetimes within the Target perovskites, both the Voc and FF are greatly improved in their device performance.64
To further elucidate the observed defect passivation effect, characterization regarding the electronic information was conducted. Fig. 7a and b show the Nyquist plots of the two groups of devices. As shown in the presented figures, a semicircle is distinctly recorded for all devices, which can be well-represented using the equivalent circuit depicted as the inset, including a series resistance (Rs), a recombination resistance (Rrec) and a correlated capacitance (C).43,65 The fitted parameters are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). Higher charge recombination resistances are recorded for the target devices versus their corresponding control devices, indicating the reduced carrier recombination43 by using HGG and the HGGBL. However, the device with HGG (Target #1) exhibits the highest capacitance of 5.29 nF, while the device with the HGGBL (Target #2) shows the lowest capacitance of 1.48 nF. This confirms the buffer layer of HGGBL could passivate the chemical reactive sites and reduce the interfacial charge accumulation, in accordance with the C–F curve shown in Fig. 2f. The variation tendency of EIS characterization is consistent with the steady state and transient PL observation, confirming the passivation effect stemmed from the interfacial carbonyl group passivation and fewer defects in the high quality Target perovskite films. The defects densities are directly revealed using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method34,59 for hole-only devices, shown in the inset of Fig. 7c. As shown in Fig. 7c, the linear region at low bias represents the ohmic response, following by a trap filling process identified by the marked increase of the current injection. The trap densities Ntrap in the perovskite devices can be determined using the equation VTFL = eNtrapL2/(2εε0), where VTFL, L, ε, and ε0 are the trap-filled limit voltage, the thickness of the perovskite, the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite and the vacuum permittivity, respectively. The hole trap densities in the CsFAMA perovskite are calculated to be 9.335 × 1015 cm−3 (Target #1) and 8.596 × 1015 cm−3 (Target #2), which are much lower than their corresponding Control devices (2.311 × 1016 cm−3 (Control #1) and 1.255 × 1016 cm−3 (Control #2)).

Fig. 7d displays the dark currents of the Control and Target devices to show their diode characteristics. As calculated, the Target perovskite devices reflect more ideal diode characteristics versus the Control perovskite device. The ideality factor n is derived from the slope in Fig. 7d using eqn (2), where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, the absolute temperature and the elementary charge, respectively. The ideality factors are calculated to be 2.184 (Target #1) and 2.1084 (Target #2), which are much smaller than 4.0246 for Control #1 and 4.7593 (Control #2). PVSCs are generally described using a double PN junction equivalent circuit model due to the two active junction formation at the ETL and HTL sides.66 However, the inhomogeneous built-in field of PVSCs leads to difficulty in obtaining the specific potential values (V1 and V2 for diode 1 and diode 2) and the corresponding specific ideality factor for each diode (n1 and n2).66,67 Thus, the overall ideality factor n, the sum of n1 and n2, is currently used to evaluate the diode characteristics for PVSCs. The smaller overall ideality factor of the target devices explicitly illustrates the improved diode quality.68 In addition to the superior diode characteristics, the dark current leakage of the Target perovskite devices is almost one order of magnitude lower than their corresponding Control perovskite devices. The lower current leakage and charge recombination, together with the superior diode characteristics, give insight into the obvious improvement of the FF (over 80%), ultimately leading to an excellent PCE (approaching 21%).69,70 (2)
Stability improvement
The stability issue is another concern for device measurement and future commercialization. Surprisingly, we observed that the perovskite devices based on the HTMs with HGG not only impart dramatic performance improvement, but also ameliorate the device stability. Fig. 8 shows the stability record of the Control and Target devices in high relative humidity of 50 ± 5% RH. It can be found that the degradation of the Target devices is greatly retarded in terms of the device performance and the device appearance shown in the inset. In particular, Target #2 devices still exhibit 90% of the initial efficiency after exposure to air for more than 3 days and still keep over 60% of the initial performance after 7 days. In stark comparison, the basic Control #1 devices degrade to merely 70% and 40% of their original PCE after statically placing in the same condition for 3 days and 7 days, respectively.
 Fig. 8  Stability measurement of the Control #1, Target #1, Control #2 and Target #2 devices exposed to air with a high relative humidity of 50 ± 5%. Three cells are measured and summarized for each condition. 
In order to work out the rationale behind the stability improvement, XRD was firstly performed for the 7 day aged perovskite films and is depicted in Fig. S21 (ESI†). Compared with their fresh films (Fig. 8), all perovskite films degrade to a certain extent. Nevertheless, the Target perovskite films still have better crystallinity when compared with their corresponding Control perovskite films. Specifically, the Target perovskite films have much higher intensity characteristic XRD peaks with narrower width, and the intensity change of the decomposed PbI2 phase is almost negligible, in contrast with the Control perovskite films. To further understand the better maintained crystallinity of the Target perovskite films, KPFM characterization was performed to estimate the surface potential of the perovskite films. It can be clearly observed that the surface potential values (see Fig. S22, ESI†) are increased from −461.662 mV (Control #1) to −423.504 mV (Target #1), and from −427.696 mV (Control #2) to −401.988 mV (Target #2). The increased surface potential values suggest the lower affinity of the perovskite surface to polar molecules, such as the water vapour in the air. This can also be verified by using the water contact angle measurement shown in Fig. S23 (ESI†). The water contact angle is increased from 57.2° (Control #1) to 70.3° (Target #1) and 64.5° (Control #2) to 79.9° (Target #2) when dripping a droplet of water on the perovskite surface. The increased water contact angle indicates the increased surface tension force of the perovskite to water molecules, thus hindering the permeation of vapour in the air into the perovskite films. In addition, the denser and smoother perovskite pinhole-free films with dramatically reduced defects and fewer irregular grain boundaries can also reduce the moisture infiltration into grain boundaries or voids.34,71 In a word, the increased surface potential values, increased crystallinity, denser morphologies and reduced defect level contribute to the distinct stability improvement.
Conclusions
In this work, a facile, efficient and non-destructive HGGBL is demonstrated to be a viable approach for the fabrication of inverted planar PVSCs on non-wetting HTMs. With the HGGBL, the champion PVSC achieves a high PCE of 20.75% with a Jsc of 23.06 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.12 V and a FF of 0.80 with negligible hysteresis. As characterized, it is found that the surface potential of PTAA after the HGG treatment is dramatically decreased, leading to a decreased surface tension force for perovskite homogeneous spreading, nucleation and growth on the non-wetting PTAA. Consequently, a uniform, dense, pinhole-free perovskite film with superior crystallinity has been obtained. In addition, the ratio of carbonyl groups (CO) on the surface of the HTMs is also detected to be strengthened and they tightly bond with the perovskite. Benefiting from the high quality of the perovskite film and the ameliorated interface with the HTMs, the interfacial capacitance and defect densities are steeply reduced, and the optical and electronic properties of the perovskites are obviously ameliorated. Meanwhile, the target device also exhibits excellent stability in a high humidity atmosphere without encapsulation. It is believed that this HGGBL will be also suitable for LEDs and other optoelectronic devices, in addition to solar cells, with similar architecture based on other non-wetting materials, such as poly-TPD, MEH-PPV, NiOx, etc.

Broader context
The inverted planar perovskite device architecture is promising for flexible photovoltaic devices and tandem solar cells, due to its low temperature fabrication and short process time. The state-of-the-art effective hole transport material (HTM) used in such devices is mainly the extremely hydrophobic PTAA, and it is a big challenge to achieve satisfactory deposition of the perovskite film on it. In order to solve this problem, this work introduces and investigates an efficient ozone plasma treated hydrophilic group grafted buffer layer (HGGBL) on the non-wetting PTAA. This HGGBL decreases the surface potential and surface tension, and a high quality and uniform perovskite film with fewer bulk defects is deposited. Moreover, the hydrophilic carbonyl groups of the HGGBL can tightly bond with the perovskite film to passivate interfacial defects. Consequently, the solar cell efficiency is boosted from 17.4% to 20.7%, close to the highest efficiency of inverted planar perovskite solar cells. Besides, the photovoltaic devices with the HGGBL also show superior reproducibility, negligible hysteresis, and improved humidity stability. This introduction of an ozone plasma treated HGGBL can be a promising method for the realization of uniform and pinhole-free perovskite film growth on non-wetting layers and achieving highly efficient photovoltaic devices.
