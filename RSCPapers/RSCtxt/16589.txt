    , Accepted 2nd August 2022First published on 11th August 2022AbstractCharge transporting layers (CTLs) are essential components of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that significantly impact their performance and stability. Metal oxide CTLs are extensively used for PSCs owing to their high transparency, stability, and low-cost synthetic routes. However, metal oxide CTLs still have limitations such as excess surface defects and mismatched energy band alignment with the perovskite layer. To resolve these issues, various metal oxide materials and processes have been developed. Herein, we systematically review the recent developments in metal oxide CTLs for PSCs. We discuss the importance of nanostructure tuning, doping, and surface and interface functionalization approaches for metal oxide CTLs to enhance PSC performance and stability. Finally, the future perspectives for the further development of the metal oxide CTLs for PSCs are highlighted.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskites have been well recognized in the photovoltaic research community owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, such as high absorption coefficients (∼105 cm−1), direct optical bandgaps, long ambipolar carrier diffusion lengths (>1 μm), and tunable bandgaps (∼1.2–3 eV).1,2 Since the pioneering works on the application of halide perovskites in liquid- and solid-state junction photovoltaic devices,3–6 the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has dramatically increased to 25.7%, which is close to the record PCE of commercial monocrystalline silicon solar cells.7
The exceptional ambipolar charge transporting ability of halide perovskites promotes the evolution of solar cell device structures from dye-sensitized solar cell originated mesoscopic structures to simplified planar heterojunction structures where planar charge transporting layers (CTLs), which are a few tenths to hundreds of nanometers thick, extract photogenerated charges from the contacting perovskite layers.8 Regardless of the simplified architecture, however, CTLs still serve as essential functional layers that significantly impact the performance and stability of PSCs.7,9–11
Organic CTLs like P3HT, PCBM, PEDOT:PSS, spiro-OMeTAD, fullerene, graphene etc. and their derivatives can be deposited using low temperature solution processes, and they have generally superior mechanical flexibility compared to inorganic counterparts. However, the organic CTLs suffer from poor charge carrier mobility, chemical instability and costly synthetic processes.12 By contrast, metal oxides have relatively better chemical stability, charge carrier mobility with presence of numerous nanostructured morphology and easy tunability of electrical and optical characteristics using cost-effective synthetic approaches.7,9–11 Although they are considered promising CTLs to constitute market-available PSCs, there are several issues yet to be resolved. For example, the defects in metal oxide CTLs and consequent traps present at the interface with perovskite layer affect the PSC performance and stability.13 The mismatched energy band alignment with the perovskite layer, and poor morphology, chemical orthogonality are still ongoing issues toward practical use of metal oxides CTLs for market-available PSCs.
In this review article, we summarize recent developments in the application of metal oxide CTLs in PSCs. Further, we investigate the effects of different approaches to enhance the functionality of metal oxide CTLs, such as morphology control, doping control, surface modification, and interface modification, ultimately enhancing the performance and stability of PSCs. Finally, the future perspectives for the commercialization of PSCs are highlighted.
Metal oxide electron transporting layers in perovskite solar cells
In general, a PSC possesses a heterojunction structure in which a thin perovskite film is sandwiched between an electron transporting layer (ETL) and a hole transporting layer (HTL). The sandwich structure is built on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer, and for good electrical connection metal electrodes are used at the top of the device. There are two types of sandwich architectures: n-i-p (normal) and p-i-n (inverted) (Fig. 1). Light typically enters through the TCO side and it is absorbed by the perovskite film where the generated electron–hole pairs are dissociated. The photogenerated holes reach the cathode via the HTL and the electrons move toward the anode via the ETL, as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic of PSCs with (a) n-i-p (planar) and (b) p-i-n (inverted) structures. 
The ETL in a PSC not only helps to achieve high performance but also influences its stability. To achieve better PSC performance, the ETL should possess a few intrinsic characteristics, as stated below.
(1) The ETL should have a well-matched conduction band minimum (CBM) with a perovskite layer to facilitate the extraction and transportation of photogenerated electrons from the perovskite toward the cathode. However, too much energy offset can sacrifice the Voc, and thus proper band alignment should be achieved. Meanwhile, to reduce the recombination probability of photogenerated carriers, the valence band maximum (VBM) of the ETL should be lower than that of the perovskite layer to block the path of the holes.
(2) The ETL in PSCs should be transparent in nature to help light to reach the main absorbing perovskite layer.
(3) Moreover, for better charge transportation to the electrode and to reduce the recombination probability of photogenerated carriers, electron mobility in the ETLs used in PSCs should be high.
(4) The interface between the ETL and the perovskite layer is critical for defining the performance of the PSC. The morphology and microstructure of the ETL are crucial for achieving efficient electron injection from the perovskite layer to the ETL.
(5) It is well known that perovskites are unstable to moisture; therefore, the overlaid ETL layer should be non-hygroscopic to enhance the moisture stability of the device.
(6) The ultraviolet (UV) tolerance of the ETL is also considered an important characteristic to ensure the stability of the perovskite layer when the solar cell is exposed to sunlight.
The energy band diagrams of different metal oxide ETLs used in PSCs along with TCOs, and metal electrodes are shown in Fig. 2. ETLs typically form an advantageous space charge region at the perovskite/ETL junction to help in collection of photogenerated electrons from the light harvester perovskite layer to the electrode before recombination.14 Therefore, a suitable ETL needs to be inserted in between perovskite and electrode layers for reducing the chance of charge recombination and promote photo-generated charge collection. A detailed investigation is required to reveal how various metal oxide ETLs in different morphologies, composites, and at various interfaces can influence the charge carrier dynamics, stability, and performance of PSCs. The performance of the PSCs based on metal oxide ETLs is summarised in Table 1.

Titanium oxide

Morphology control. 
TiO2 has three popular phases: rutile, anatase, and brookite, which are utilized in semiconductor applications. At the initial stage of development, mesoscopic anatase TiO2 was the most widely used ETL for fabricating PSCs with record-breaking PCEs.17 Adopted from dye-sensitized solar cells, the interconnected mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle network with high surface area assists in the collection of photogenerated charge carriers in the perovskite layer.18,19 Incorporation of the mesoporous TiO2 facilitates efficient charge collection and reduces current voltage hysteresis.20 At the intial stage of development, almost all the PSCs with record-breaking PCEs were fabricated based on the mesoscopic anatase TiO2 ETL.21
Alternatively, other TiO2 crystalline phases have also been adopted. The crystalline phase-dependent charge collection was investigated using rutile and anatase TiO2 ETLs to fabricate PSCs.22,23 The rutile TiO2 ETL enhances the extraction and transportation of electrons to fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and reduces recombination owing to its better conductivity and improved interface.23 Moreover, this ETL exhibits a better match with perovskite grains, resulting in a lower trap density.22 Therefore, compared with anatase counterpart rutile TiO2 as an ETL significantly enhances the performance, yielding a VOC and PCE of 1.17 V and 20.9%, respectively.22
TiO2 has been utilized as the ETL in PSCs in different morphologies such as nanorods, nanoparticles, nanowires, nanoflowers, nanocolumns, nanocrystalline granules, mesoporous thin films, nanotubes, nanopyramids, nanodendrites, and nanocones.23–32 When hydrothermally grown TiO2 nanopyramid arrays are introduced as ETLs in PSCs, for example, high PCE (22.5%) are obtained.30 This excellent performance is attributed to sufficient contact area for electron extraction. Further, the nanopyramid array/perovskite system increases light transmission and exhibits an oriented electric field that promotes charge separation before recombination. Conventional PSCs comprise high-temperature processed (>500 °C) compact and/or mesoporous TiO2 layers that hinder their applications in flexible devices. To overcome this limitation, combinations of ultrathin amorphous TiOX complex layers and brookite TiO2 scaffolds have been introduced as electron collectors in planar PSCs. With process temperature lower than 150 °C, the PCE of 21.6% was achieved thanks to better band alignment between the layers.33 The TiO2 has been also utilized in perovskite based tandem devices. The ALD grown TiO2 layer on p+-Si layer was used to form a recombination junction between the PSC and Si sub cell. Tandem devices based on both homojunction and passivating contact heterojunction Si cells have been reported with PCEs of 22.9 and 24.1% respectively.34 The radio frequency sputtered hole blocking TiO2 was also used in perovskite/Si based 4 terminal tandem solar cells with PCE of 23.1%.35


Doping. 
Pristine TiO2 exhibits relatively low electron mobility (0.1–1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1) and conductivity.36 The doping can be an effective approach for modulating its electrical and surface properties without significantly disturbing its optical transmittance. With proper selection of dopants, the doping can shift the Fermi energy level and increase the carrier transport ability while inhibiting carrier recombination. Therefore, various metals have been involved in the doping of nanostructured TiO2 ETLs.37–46 In particular, Nb-doped TiO2 nanocrystal ETLs exhibit improved transparency and electrical conductivity with better charge extraction in PSCs.37,47 Since a low temperature synthesis procedure has been involved in corresponding PSC fabrication, PSC has been fabricated on both rigid and flexible substrates with enhanced PCE of 19.57% and 16.01%, respectively, with less hysteresis.
In addition to these metals, various organic and inorganic compounds such as NaCl and MXene have been used as dopants in TiO2 nanostructured ETLs.48,49 Remarkably, excellent PCE of up to 25.28% with JSC, VOC, and FF values of 26.17 mA cm−2, 1.171 V, and 82.47%, respectively, have been achieved using Li2CO3 salt as a dopant in mesoporous nanostructured TiO2 ETL.50 In this work, different Li-based salts were used as dopants in TiO2; owing to the suitable band alignment and reduced trap density, Li2CO3 facilitated efficient electron extraction and exhibited improved performance (device structure and band alignments are shown in Fig. 3a and b).

Surface passivation. 
One of the major challenges in using TiO2 as an ETL in PSCs is its non-stoichiometric defects related to oxygen vacancies, which impact its performance and stability.52 When TiO2 compact layers are annealed under various ambient conditions, the change in oxygen vacancy density results in modification of the optical transmission of the layer as well as carrier recombination behavior in the corresponding planar PSCs.43 For example, the introduction of hydrogenated TiO2 films enabled the enhanced JSC and FF of PSCs, owing to accelerated electron extraction and reduced charge transfer resistance.53 The upward shift of Fermi level and improved crystallinity of the perovskite layer helps to reduce the VOC loss after hydrogenation of the TiO2 layer. Consequently, efficient PSCs with a PCE of 19.3% and negligible hysteresis were demonstrated.
Other approaches, such as UV-ozone exposure,54 laser annealing,55 and oxygen-plasma treatment,56 have been also utilized as alternative low-temperature surface passivation procedures for the photocatalytic removal of organic ligands and reduction in surface-related oxygen vacancy-like defects to increase the conductance of the film. In addition, the TiO2 surface has been modified using several inorganic and organic compounds to suppress oxygen vacancies, to promote efficient charge transport and suppress recombination chances.57–60 Among them, the use of an atomic layer deposited (ALD) ultrathin Nb2O5 layer to modify the surface of the mesoporous TiO2 ETL (ALD schematic shown in Fig. 3c) in PSC resulted in improved VOC and PCE values of 1.147 V and 21.04%, respectively, with negligible hysteresis (Fig. 3e).51 After adding this ultrathin Nb2O5 layer (shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Fig. 3d), the morphology of the deposited perovskite layer on the modified mesoporous TiO2 ETL promoted charge transfer in the PSC with better performance (Fig. 3f).


Interface engineering. 
The TiO2 compact layer has several challenging issues, such as surface hydroxyl groups, high defect density, and unmatched energy levels, resulting in poor stability and energy loss.61 To overcome this issue, the TiO2 based bilayer approach is often used. The PSCs with bilayered TiO2/WO3 ETL exhibit type-II band alignment, facilitating electron extraction for high-performance PSCs.62 The pinholes in the bare WO3 film increase the recombination probability by providing a direct path between FTO and perovskite. However, for bilayered TiO2/WO3 ETLs, the presence of a hydrophilic TiO2 underlayer helped to form a uniform and compact WO3 layer (shown in the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image in Fig. 4a). Moreover, the suitable band alignment promotes the extraction of electrons from the perovskite to the ETL with enhanced hole-blocking ability to achieve an improved PCE of up to 20.14%. The bilayer uniformly covers the FTO substrate, removes the possibility of hole transfer from the perovskite to the FTO, and reduces the recombination probability. The entire charge-transfer mechanism of the bilayered TiO2/WO3 ETL-based PSC is shown in Fig. 4b and c.

To increase the charge collection efficiency and reduce interfacial resistance, TiO2 composites with various organic and inorganic compounds such as graphene, dopamine, caproic acid, carbon nanotubes, Sb2S3, and ZnS have been introduced.63–71 Intrinsic oxygen vacancies in TiO2-based nanostructures result in interfacial charge recombination and poor long-term photostability of the corresponding PSCs. To solve these issues, an amorphous SnO2 thin layer between the TiO2 compact layer and perovskite interface was introduced to modify the interface for improved charge collection and reduced carrier recombination; the FESEM image of the device structure is shown in Fig. 4d. Resultingly, the PSC exhibits a high VOC and PCE of 1.223 V and 21.4%, respectively, with negligible hysteresis and good photostability (i.e., it retains 91% of the initial PCE after 500 h of continuous illumination).72Fig. 4e and f depict a comparison of the performances of PSCs containing bare SnO2, bare TiO2, and SnO2/TiO2 composites as ETLs.

Tin oxide
TiO2 ETL exhibits several disadvantages in terms of hysteresis and low photonic stability under UV illumination owing to its low electron mobility and insufficient interfacial charge separation. Tin oxide (SnO2) is an effective replacement for TiO2 as an ETL because of its high optical transmittance in the visible range, high stability, better electron mobility (∼240 cm2 V−1 s−1), and suitable band alignment with the perovskite layer.11,73

Morphology control. 
SnO2 ETL has been utilized in PSCs with different morphologies, such as nanoparticles, nanorods, nanosheets, nanobelts, nanofibers, and nanocolloids.11,74–78 For commercialization purposes, low-temperature synthesized electron-beam-evaporated SnO2 films have been introduced as ETLs for the large-scale production of PSCs and achieved a PCE of 18.2% with excellent stability by retaining 97% of its initial PCE after 34 d of storage.79 Ke et al.80 have investigated the effect of annealing temperature of solution-processed SnO2 ETL on performance of corresponding PSCs. They found that the low temperature annealed SnO2 outperforms the high-temperature annealed one as an ETL. The higher performance of the low temperature processed SnO2 was attributed to better film coverage, lower electron concentration, and wider band gap compared to the high temperature processed counterpart. In another work, low temperature (150–190 °C) solution processed amorphous–crystalline heterophase SnO2 has been utilized as an ETL in PSCs instead of single phase SnO2. The heterophase SnO2 demonstrated improve the surface morphology, reduced oxygen defects, and improved band alignment.81 Resultingly, ohmic contact has been improved with a reduction in bimolecular recombination, resulting in a PCE of 20.39% with negligible hysteresis (HI∼ 0.009). Recently, the colloidal SnO2 is widely used for fabricating the PSCs with record high performance.7,9,11 The colloidal SnO2 layer facilitates efficient electron extraction from the perovskite layer due to well matched CBM, and thus hysteresis free PSCs with high-performance have been demonstrated. Owing to its low temperature processability and excellent compatibility with perovskites, the SnO2 is also frequently adopted in perovskite based monolithic tandem devices. For example, PCE exceeding 29% was demonstrated using ALD grown SnO2 as a ETL of perovskite top cell in perovskite/Si tandem devices.82 In monolithic all-perovskite tandem PSCs, ALD-grown SnO2 layer with an ultra-thin Au layer has been used for better electrical conductivity and efficient charge recombination in the tunnel recombination junction.83 This PSC has shown excellent VOC and PCE of 1.965 V and 24.8%, respectively, with good stability (retained 90% of its initial PCE after 463 hours of operation under 1 sun illumination). Recently, 21.7% efficient all-perovskite tandem solar modules were demonstrated based on a similar recombination junction.84


Doping. 
Various metals have been used as dopants for SnO2 nanostructured ETLs.85–91 Following the incorporation of Eu3+ in SnO2, the electron mobility improves with reduced trap densities at the grain boundaries and results in a PCE of 20.14% and enhanced stability by retaining 87% of its initial performance after 84 d of storage in atmosphere.91 When carboxylic-acid- and hydroxyl-rich red-carbon quantum dots (RCQs) are used to dope SnO2 with low-temperature annealing, the electron mobility is improved. Highly conjugated SH- and OH-rich RCQs at the ETL/perovskite interface (Fig. 5a) facilitate the perovskite nucleation process and function as nucleation centers for perovskite growth, resulting in an almost hysteresis-free PCE of 22.77%.92 These RCQs can effectively create a bond with incompletely coordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite layers and facilitate high-quality film formation. This PSC exhibits long-term stability against humidity by retaining 95% of its initial PCE after preserving 40–60% of its relative humidity for 1000 h (Fig. 5b).

Surface passivation. 
The defects present on the SnO2 ETL surface, such as Sn dangling bonds, cause charge traps and recombination, resulting in hysteresis, low efficiency, and device instability in the PSCs. Many approaches using fullerene derivatives,94,95 small organic molecules,96–100 polymers,101–103 and inorganic compounds104,105 have been implemented to passivate the surface defects of SnO2 ETL. The dual passivation method is another approach to passivate the SnO2 ETL surface more efficiently.106 The surface alkali-gas erosion (SAE) method is one of the dual passivation methods, which uses alkaline gas to passivate.107 First, the crystal fusion of the SnO2 surface occurs to improve electron mobility, then the introduction of the –NH2 group on the SnO2 surface promotes the growth of the perovskite film to enhance the interfacial charge transport. Consequently, the champion PSC exhibits JSC and PCE values of 24.19 mA cm−2 and 21.10%, respectively, with improved stability by retaining 86% of its initial PCE after 60 d of storage at room temperature in 40–50% humidity.


Interface engineering. 
Different organic and inorganic materials such as KCl, TiO2, ZnO, MXene, and carbon nanotubes have been introduced for interface passivation.104,108–119 Most of these interlayers passivate either the CTL or perovskite layer. Therefore, to better improve the device performance, a dual-functional method for passivating the defects present in both the perovskite and ETL films might be an effective approach. After rubidium fluoride (RbF) is added to the SnO2 colloidal dispersion, the electron mobility in the ETL increases owing to the strong interaction between Sn and F.93 On the other hand, the Rb+ cation present at the interface of SnO2/perovskite influences the interstitial sites of the perovskite lattice to inhibit ion migration with reduced nonradiative recombination. Moreover, double passivation was achieved using a 2D perovskite layer on a 3D layer, resulting in an excellent VOC and PCE of 1.213 V and 23.38%, respectively, with suppressed hysteresis (Fig. 5c).
Passivation of the perovskite surface that shares an interface with the ETL is difficult because the surface treatment agents may dissolve while coating the perovskite layer. To introduce a coherent interface, an interlayer between the SnO2 ETL and the halide perovskite (FAPbI3) light-absorbing layer was introduced by coupling Cl-bonded SnO2 with a Cl-containing perovskite (FASnClX) (simulated view in Fig. 5d).9 After the introduction of this interlayer, charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer to the ETL were enhanced, resulting in an excellent PCE of 25.8% (certified 25.5%) under standard illumination with high stability by maintaining ∼90% of its initial PCE, even after continuous light exposure for 500 h, and negligible hysteresis (Fig. 5e).

Zinc oxide
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an n-type, non-toxic, inorganic semiconductor and a potential candidate to replace conventional TiO2 as an ETL because of its wide bandgap (∼3.2–3.4 eV), high electron mobility (∼200–300 cm2 V−1 s−1), and easy fabrication methods.120,121 ZnO ETL has been used in PSCs with different approaches described below.

Morphology control. 
ZnO has been established as an efficient alternative nanostructured ETL, particularly in flexible PSCs, owing to its low-temperature synthesis processability.122 ZnO ETL has been utilized in PSCs in different morphologies.122–127 The photovoltaic performance of PSCs is crucially dependent on the thickness, diameter, length, pore size, and morphology of these nanostructures.128 The charge transfer resistance between the ZnO ETL and perovskite depends strongly on the roughness of the ETL layer, which influences the recombination rate.129 For instance, Zhang et al.130 utilized solvothermally synthesized ZnO nanoparticles without agglomeration and high crystallinity in a PSC and reported a high PCE of 15.92% owing to faster charge injection and lower charge recombination. The ZnO nanoparticle ETL has also been used for encapsulation in inverted PSCs with a PCE of up to 16.1% and retained almost 90% of its initial performance, even after 60 days of storage in air at room temperature.10


Doping. 
Different metals have been doped in ZnO nanostructured ETLs to modulate their electrical and optical properties.131–135 For example, Al-doped ZnO has been widely used as a TCO layer owing to its outstanding conductivity and transmittance.136 On the other hand, the K-doped ZnO ETL exhibited passivated surface defects and better band alignment than the perovskite layer owing to the improved electron mobility. As a result, the PCE improved to 19.9% with negligible hysteresis and long-term stability (retaining 91% of the initial PCE after 800 h of storage).133 In addition to metals, iodine and nitrogen have been used to dope ZnO for use in PSCs.137,138 When cerium oxide (CeOX) was doped in ZnO nanostructured ETL, the chemical compatibility and energy level alignment between the perovskite and ETL improve, resulting in better stability in the corresponding PSC under UV light, moisture, and thermal environment with improved PCE up to 19.5%.139


Surface passivation. 
Despite the good physical properties and facile processability of ZnO, the thermal instability of the perovskite on the ZnO surface limits its application. The surface-bounded hydroxyl groups and other residual ligands on the ZnO surface accelerate the decomposition.140 Therefore, UV-ozone treatment, a simple aging method at room temperature, annealing processes, sulfurization, and chlorination methods have been used to eliminate these hydroxyl groups by reducing the number of oxygen vacancies and/or creating a type-II heterojunction at the interface for better charge carrier transportation.141,142 Dong et al.143 investigated formation of perovskite layers on atomic layer deposited ZnO (ALD ZnO) film sintered at different temperatures. When the ZnO film sintered at high temperatures (450 °C), the perovskite film could not be formed on the film at room temperature whereas the perovskite film was spontaneously formed on low temperature processed ZnO film at room temperature. At higher sintering temperatures the crystallinity of ZnO films is improved with less oxygen vacancies on its surface, which prevents reaction between perovskite and ZnO surface. They claimed that the reaction between the low temperature processed ALD ZnO film and perovskite precursors helps in growth of perovskite crystals at lower temperature.
Moreover, to tune the performance of PSCs, surface-related defects in ZnO ETL have been modified by different organic and inorganic components.144–146 Cao et al.147 passivated the surface of ZnO ETL by introducing a thin layer of MgO and ethanolamine. Each layer plays a different role in obtaining efficient PSCs. The MgO thin layer inhibits interfacial charge recombination to achieve better performance and good device stability. Protonated ethanolamine molecules act as neutral ligands to promote effective electron injection and extraction to achieve hysteresis-free J–V characteristics (schematic illustrations are shown in Fig. 6a and b). A TiO2 scaffold layer was then added to further improve the performance; Fig. 6c depicts a cross-sectional FESEM image of the device architecture. Consequently, hysteresis-free, stable, and efficient PSCs (PCE: 21.1%) were obtained; Fig. 6d shows the hysteresis free J–V curve.

Interface Engineering. 
Recombination of charges at the interface of ZnO and perovskite originates from the low electron injection efficiency and thermal instability of perovskite at the interface.149 To address this issue, the interface between ZnO and the perovskite has been modified using different inorganic and organic materials.150–157 During sulfidation of the ZnO surface using ZnS, ZnS functions as both a cascade ETL and a passivating layer.152 Sulfur available on the ZnO–ZnS surface helps to bind the Pb2+ ion of the perovskite with the surface and aids in electron transport with reduced recombination chances to improve the PCE up to 20.7% with almost suppressed hysteresis. The organic components decrease the electron transport barrier between the ETL and perovskite layer and prevent direct contact between ZnO and the perovskite layer to achieve better stability and performance.158 Polydopamine (PDA) interlayer-based aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) ETL-based PSCs reveal a higher PCE of 21.36% with negligible hysteresis by overcoming the deprotonation reaction and interfacial mismatch.148 After adding PDA to the AZO solution, the spin-coated film becomes dense and defect-free, which facilitates the vertically ordered growth of the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 6e. Inspired by the excellent photovoltaic performance and advantages of bendability, the device was also fabricated on a flexible PEN substrate and achieved a PCE of 18.51% (Fig. 6f).

Other metal oxides

Morphology control. 
Tungsten oxide (WO3) is an n-type semiconducting material with a moderate electron mobility of ∼10–20 cm2 V−1 s−1 and its optical bandgap varies with its nanostructure, typically between 2 and 3 eV.159 Highly oxygen-deficient electron-beam-deposited WO3−X has been used as an ETL in PSCs. These oxygen vacancies helped to improve the VOC value owing to improved conductivity and also resulted in a PCE of 10.3% with a low HI of 2.1%.160
Rare earth CeOX is a potential candidate for various electronic applications owing to its wide bandgap, high ionic conductivity, and good thermal and chemical stability.161,162 CeOX ETL has been used in PSCs, resulting in better performance than the organic counterpart phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), with improved FF and PCE values of 79.7% and 17.1%, respectively, owing to its suitable energy alignment with the perovskite layer.162 Moreover, the dense CeOX layer not only protects the perovskite from humidity but also acts as a diffusion barrier to prevent corrosion of the metal electrode. Additionally, it exhibits good stability, even after 200 h of storage in air.
Niobium oxide (Nb2O5) is another popular ETL used in PSCs owing to its good chemical and air stabilities and water insolubility. Amorphous Nb2O5 ETL exhibits improved photovoltaic performance owing to its improved optical transmittance and low charge recombination. Room-temperature sputtered amorphous Nb2O5 ETL based PSC showed a high PCE of 17.1%, comparable to that of PSC (17.2%) based on high temperature (500 °C) annealed crystalline Nb2O5.163 Both high mobility and conductivity of the amorphous Nb2O5 film allow for efficient electron extraction at interface with the perovskite layer. Furthermore, this amorphous Nb2O5 ETL was utilised in flexible PSCs with PCE of 12.1%. Surface modification of TCO using atomic-layer thin amorphous niobium oxyhydroxide (a-NbOH) yielded an excellent PCE of 21.1% with negligible hysteresis behavior.164 Here, the a-NbOH interlayer not only reduces charge recombination by acting as an insulating layer, but also helps in electron transport and blocking holes. These hydroxyl group-rich a-NbOH layers promote high-quality crystal growth with a large grain size and low trap densities to improve the performance of PSCs.


Doping. 
Doping has been applied to different metal oxide ETLs to tune electrical properties and band alignment with the perovskite layer.165 Zn-doped Nb2O5 exhibited a PCE of 17.7%, whereas the Sn-doped In2O3/In2O3 bilayer ETL-based PSC revealed JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE values of 23.22 mA cm−2, 1.1 V, 80.85%, and 20.65%, respectively, with good stability.166,167 Meanwhile, Eu-doped WOX nanorods have been introduced as interface modifiers in a PSC and reported an excellent hysteresis-free PCE of 22.08% because of their excellent conductivity and mobility.168 This champion device also exhibited stability and retained 90% of its initial PCE, even after 2000 h.


Surface passivation. 
Bulk In2O3 exhibits high carrier mobility (140–170 cm2 V−1 s−1), low resistivity, and excellent chemical and thermal stabilities.169 In2O3 has been used as a good alternative electron selective layer in PSCs, achieving a PCE of 13.01%.170 The In2O3 film surface was passivated by PCBM to produce pinhole and crack-free films, achieving an enhanced PCE of 14.83% with reduced hysteresis. In another study, highly uniform ligand-capped CeOX nanocrystal films were used as ETLs in flexible PSCs. Following UV–O3 treatment of CeOX nanocrystal films, the corresponding PSC showed a PCE of 14.63% under 1 sun illumination owing to the improved transparency, good electrical conductivity, and favorable energy matching at the ETL/perovskite interface.171 WOx-based sputtered buffer layer has been used in n-i-p structured semitransparent PSCs after slightly treating its surface with niobium oxide (NbOy) for minimizing the surface defects and increasing the film conductivity.172 As a consequence, significantly enhancement in FF value from 70.4% to 80.3% results in a PCE over 18%. By combining with a 22.9% efficient silicon cell, they have further demonstrated a four-terminal tandem configuration with a PCE of 26.0%.


Interface engineering. 
Room-temperature-processed metal oxide films exhibit surface defects and low electron mobility, which influence the charge-transfer rate. The low-temperature (∼150 °C) sol–gel synthesized CeO1.87 has been introduced as an ETL in PSCs, yielding a PCE of 14.32%.161 After PCBM was introduced as an interfacial layer between the CeO1.87 and perovskite layers, the PCE was enhanced to 17.04%. The smooth surface and low work function of the bilayer facilitate charge transportation and the fabrication of high-quality perovskite films. Fang et al.173 reported a bilayer CeOX/PCBM as an ETL in inverted PSCs for better shielding and good charge transportation. They also reported a high PCE of 18.7% and maintained almost no degradation, even after 30 d under 30% humidity in dark conditions.
α-Fe2O3 exhibited improved stability compared to conventional ETLs in moisture and under UV illumination. However, the efficiency of the corresponding PSC is limited because of its poor interface at the junction of α-Fe2O3 and the perovskite layer. Chen et al.174 assembled N and S co-doped graphene oxide with α-Fe2O3 as the ETL for interfacial defect passivation, suppression of charge recombination, enhanced perovskite crystalline growth, and improved charge extraction. Consequently, the PCE of the corresponding PSC reached 19.2% with negligible hysteresis behavior and achieved high stability with only 4% degradation in performance, even after 1200 h of storage under humid conditions.
The superior hole-blocking property of Ga2O3 helps to reduce interfacial charge recombination and introduces a high built-in potential at the interface between perovskite and SnO2, which promotes the charge extraction ability.175 This bilayer Ga2O3/SnO2 ETL-based PSC exhibited excellent JSC, VOC, FF, and PCE values of 23.68 mA cm−2, 1.12 V, 81.23%, and 21.56%, respectively. Moreover, this device exhibited excellent stability, retaining 92.29% of its initial PCE after 1000 h of storage in the atmosphere.

Metal oxide hole transporting layers in perovskite solar cells
Metal oxide HTLs may suffer from trap levels, mismatched energy levels, and insufficient charge mobility. Therefore, to obtain stable and high-performance PSCs, optimization of the HTL is required to satisfy the several indispensable requirements mentioned below.
(1) The VBM of the HTL should be higher than that of the perovskite layer to facilitate hole transport from the perovskite to the electrode via the HTL. However, too much energy offset can sacrifice the Voc, and thus proper band alignment should be achieved.
(2) Most conventional HTLs are costly; therefore, low-cost and easily available HTLs are required for solar cell applications.
(3) Charge recombination should be reduced to achieve good performance. Therefore, compact and homogeneous HTLs are required to reduce the recombination probability at the HTL/perovskite interface.
(4) As an HTL, a p-type semiconductor material with high hole mobility is required for efficient hole transport and reduced recombination.
(5) Similar to the ETL, the HTL should also be transparent in nature to facilitate better photon absorption by the perovskite layer.
The energy band diagrams of different metal oxide HTLs used in PSCs, along with TCOs and metal electrodes, are shown in Fig. 7. Notably, a variety of metal oxide ETLs are available for PSC applications, whereas the options for metal oxide HTLs are limited. Very few options for HTLs with thermal or chemical compatibility, high stability, and low-temperature processing are available. The performance of the PSCs based on metal oxide HTLs is summarised in Table 2.

Nickel oxide

Morphology control. 
Nickel oxide (NiO and NiOX) is a promising metal oxide HTL for PSCs owing to its good chemical stability, improved transmittance, reduced fabrication cost, acceptable hole mobility (10−5–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), and suitable work function (5.4 eV).181 Nickel oxide nanostructured film HTLs have been deposited in the form of nanocrystals, nanofibers, nanosheets, and nanoforests.182–188 The concept of self-functionalization has been introduced with the production of interconnected crystalline NiOX and its amorphous counterpart along with small traces of untreated nickel hydroxide and nickel nitrate ion-based colloidal dispersions of NiOX.189 This amorphous phase plays a crucial role in stabilizing the colloidal dispersion and ensuring better connectivity when used as a compact HTL, resulting in a high PCE of 16.6% with null hysteresis. Low-temperature-processed highly crystalline NiOX nanocrystals have been utilized as HTLs in PSCs and exhibited JSC and PCE values of 31 mA cm−2 and 17.6%, respectively.183 This particular device retained 95% of its initial performance, even after 102 d. The NiO is often used as a HTL of perovskite sub cell in perovskite-based tandem devices.190 The low temperature (190 °C) solution processed NiOx layer was used to demonstrate a 23.6% perovskite/Si monolithic tandem device.190 By incorporating a textured silicon sub cell, the PCE of 25.7% was demonstrated.191


Doping. 
The relatively low intrinsic conductivity is a significant drawback for NiO HTL because it can result in hole accumulation near the interface of the HTL and the perovskite layer. Therefore, to improve the charge collection and decrease the recombination probability, doping in nickel oxide nanostructures can be a good approach.192 Different metals, including rare earth metals, have been introduced as dopants in NiO to enhance its conductivity.193–202 For Cu-doped NiO, both Cu+ and Cu2+ states have been observed with significant improvement in the electrical properties owing to enhanced carrier concentration and mobility, resulting in FF and PCE values of 80.9% and 20.15%, respectively.192 In addition, the device revealed better stability when stored under high humidity (60–65%) conditions for 1000 h with negligible hysteresis characteristics. Fig. 8a depicts a cross-sectional FESEM image of the device structure. Owing to the possibility of room-temperature synthesis, the device was fabricated on flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)–ITO substrates, resulting in a PCE of 17.41% and negligible hysteresis (Fig. 8b). The Rb-doped NiOX HTL-based PSC exhibited better performance owing to the enhanced hole transportation and passivation of trap states.197 The doping percentage of Rb+ was varied, and for 0.1% Rb+ doping, the highest PCE and FF values of 21.8% and 0.824, respectively, were achieved along with improved stability and negligible hysteresis. In another work, a new phase based on trivalent Ni2O3 was synthesized by low-temperature solution processing, where Ni–Ni self-doping was utilized instead of doping with another metal. Fig. 8c depicts a schematic of the inverted PSC device. The top view FESEM image of the Ni2O3 film is shown in the inset of Fig. 8d. Compared to other HTLs (PEDOT:PSS and NiOX), a better PCE of 17.89% was obtained (Fig. 8d) because of the film crystallinity, efficient charge transfer, and expanded light absorption.203

Surface passivation. 
Even with same fabrication recipe, the PCEs of the NiOX-based PSCs shows wide distribution, which was attributed to the surface dipole of the NiOX film.204 The strong dipole of the solution-processed NiOX film induces the growth of perovskite films with defects. Cheng et al.204 used the dipolar molecule n-butylamine to modify the surface of a NiOX film to reduce the corresponding surface dipole. The defect density in the perovskite layer grown on the modified NiOX film was also reduced, resulting in a high PCE of 18.9%.
Surface traps at the interface of NiOX/perovskite have been passivated in different approaches using organic and inorganic components.205–209 The electrical conductivity and transmittance of nickel oxide films are crucially controlled by partial oxygen pressure.210 The valence band level of NiOX is typically adjusted by the nickel vacancy (VNi) defect states for faster and efficient hole extraction.211 With variation in partial oxygen pressure during pulsed laser deposition of NiOX layer, its VNi defect densities are modulated, which resulted in high JSC, VOC and PCE of 20.49 mA cm−2, 1.14 V, 16.85% respectively (11 Pa partial oxygen pressure). In another work, post treatment on the NiOX layer before perovskite deposition aids in the removal of reactive Ni≥3+ sites and prevents further reaction between NiOX and perovskite layers to help to achieve VOC and PCE values of 1.15 V and 20.1%, respectively.212


Interface engineering. 
The graphene and other organic components as well as inorganic materials (e.g., Al2O3 and NaCl) have been used at the NiO or NiOX/perovskite interface by different groups to enhance the performance and stability of the corresponding solar cells.214–219 Furthermore, a few of them have been used as buffer layers or interface modifiers in NiOX HTLs for ordered perovskite growth, with larger grain sizes and fewer defects, to achieve better stability and efficiency of solar cells.220,221 In another report, the application of molecules with high electron affinity in the metal oxide HTL helped in the efficient extraction of holes, which may result in improved performance of solar cells. For this purpose, a novel F2HCNQ with high electron affinity was introduced into the NiOX HTL, resulting in an improved PCE of 22.13%.213 This champion device also showed improved stability, retaining 80% of its initial PCE, even after 1000 h of constant illumination (stored at 25 °C, 40% RH under AM 1.5G illumination), as shown in Fig. 8e. Owing to the low-temperature processability, the entire device architecture was reproduced on a flexible substrate, resulting in a hysteresis-free PCE of 20.01% (Fig. 8f).

Other metal oxides

Morphology control. 
Copper oxide (CuO, Cu2O, and CuOX) is a promising metal oxide HTL because of its non-toxicity and facile solution-based synthesis method without a vacuum system.222,223 CuOX is a mixture of Cu2O and CuO phases that exhibits hole mobilities of 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.129 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the respective phases.224 Therefore, by tuning the contents in the film, its transmittance, conductivity and mobility can be altered. CuOX quantum dots have been utilized as hole interfacial layers in PSCs to achieve a PCE of 19.91%. This high performance is attributed to better electrical charge transportation and low recombination probability, owing to the reduced number of trap states in the perovskite layers deposited on the CuOX layer. The MoO3 has been introduced as an anode buffer layer in PSCs to enhance hole transportation and effectively block electrons to reduce the recombination probability. The PCE of 10.8% was demonstrated.225 A high work function and chemical reaction of the MoO3 with the perovskite layer may degrade the performance of the PSCs.226 Carbon electrode-based PSCs are used to fabricate low-cost and thermally stable PSCs without HTLs and high-cost electrodes.227 However, they experience severe charge recombination at the carbon/perovskite interface. To solve this issue, Zhou et al.228 introduced Co3O4 spinel as an HTL to promote charge separation and reduce the recombination probability at the interface owing to Fermi level tuning. After inserting Co3O4 into the device, the Fermi level of the HTL was determined by the interaction between the perovskite and HTL, and photovoltaic performance was improved with a PCE of 10.5% and negligible hysteresis. The complete charge transfer mechanism is shown in Fig. 9a. Owing to the suitable energy level matching between n-type amorphous VOX and CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layers, Sun et al.229 developed a planar heterojunction with a low-temperature processed p-type contact VOX as the HTL and achieved a PCE of 14.13%. Furthermore, low-cost alternative magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles have been used as HTLs in PSCs owing to their high hole mobility (0.289 cm2 V−1 s−1) and durability; a PCE of 15.42% with long-term durability up to 30 d was reported.230

Doping. 
Spinel cobaltite (Co3O4) was doped with Li (ref. 231) for use as an HTL in organometallic halide PSCs. Owing to the improved hole extraction, PCE values of 14% and 7% were observed for MAPbI3 and (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 perovskite-based PSCs containing Li-doped Co3O4 HTLs, respectively. Li doping not only improved the transparency of the Co3O4 thin film but also enhanced its conductivity. MoO2 nanostructures were obtained through the reduction of MoO3 at high temperatures; consequently, MoO2 exhibits limited phase stability toward oxygen and moisture. When Ti-doped MoO2 nanoparticles are used as the HTL in MAPbI3-based PSCs, they exhibit improved photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 15.8% under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2 irradiance).232 Ti doping helps to achieve stronger Mo–O bonds and consequently exhibits improved stability of the corresponding device against humidity. Meanwhile, Cs-doped VOX has been utilized as an efficient HTL in PSCs because the conductivity of the VOX film is enhanced owing to Cs doping.233 A heterojunction of Cs-doped VOX and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) was developed for interfacial doping and exhibited a better PCE of ∼19.64%.221


Surface passivation. 
Surface treatments can influence the electrical properties of different metal oxides by tuning the density and distribution of surface defects. Following UV-ozone treatment of the CuOX film, both Cu2+ and oxygen contents increased, resulting in enhanced p-type conductivity.234 This surface-modified CuOX film replaced PEDOT:PSS as the HTL and exhibited better JSC and PCE values of 23.2 mA cm−2 and 17.1%, respectively, for the corresponding solar cell device. In another work, Cu2O quantum dots were modified with a silane coupling agent, and the corresponding PSC exhibited better performance with a PCE of 18.9% owing to faster and efficient hole transport and better film quality.235 Moreover, this PSC exhibits a hydrophobic nature with a water contact angle of 88.2°, and the PCE of the corresponding device retained 90% of its initial value, even after 30 d (Fig. 9b and c). Molybdenum oxide has been employed as a hole extraction or injection layer in solar cell applications because of its deep work function, low-lying conduction band, and moisture-protecting characteristics. Chen et al.236 modified a solution-processed MoOX HTL with a strong electron acceptor 2,3,5,6-tetrauoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) and demonstrated a stable and efficient (PCE: 16.26%) MAPbI3-based PSC with negligible hysteresis. This improved performance is attributed to passivated defects, improved surface morphology, enhanced conductivity, and improved energy band alignment of the HTL with the perovskite layer. In another study, the surfaces of CoO nanoplates were modified with hydrophobic oleylamine ligands. Surface-passivated CoO nanoplates have been used as the HTL in PSCs to achieve a PCE of 20.72% with a steady-state PCE of 20.2%.237 After spin coating the capped CoO nanoplate film on the perovskite layer, the grain boundaries of the perovskite were filled to suppress the dark current and enhance the moisture resistivity.


Interface engineering. 
Copper oxide exhibits energetic misalignment with the MAPbI3 perovskite layer and causes interfacial recombination at the interface. Scientists are currently investigating the interfacial degradation of perovskites to achieve long-term stability. Organic HTLs react easily with perovskites and degrade them; hence, they are replaced with CuSCN, an inorganic counterpart. The nanocomposite of Cu2O–CuSCN as an HTL in PSCs exhibits a better PCE of 19.2% and retained 90% of its initial PCE even after 720 h owing to the improved charge transfer and reduced interfacial degradation.238 Bilayer HTL acts as a stabilizer in PSCs and achieves better stability in the device.239 Compared with spiro-OMeTAD, the bilayer HTL based on spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3 composite achieved improved FF and PCE values of 81.5% and 14.05%, respectively, for inorganic mixed halide perovskite-based solar cells owing to its lower work function. The inclusion of the MoO3 layer helps to block the excitons and delay reverse charge flow to achieve enhanced photovoltaic performance with suppressed recombination. The charge accumulation at the interface reflects a lower JSC value for devices containing a bilayer HTL. MoOX has also been used as a suitable interfacial modifier for PSCs. MoOX was utilized as a hole extraction layer by inserting it between the HTL spiro-OMeTAD and the metal electrode.225 MoOX functioned as an encapsulation layer, and the devices containing a thinner MoOX layer exhibited better stability, proving that the interfacial effect in the MoOX/metal contact controls the stability of the device (Fig. 9d). This improved performance is attributed to the good energy band alignment with the perovskite layer and better electron blocking.
Li et al.246 employed VOX for post-treatment of the interface of the carbon electrode and perovskite to passivate the interface to facilitate charge transfer. VOC and PCE values of 951 mV and 15.77%, respectively, were achieved for the corresponding solar cell, and the HI was reduced from 0.025 to −0.001. Various vanadium oxide-based bilayer inorganic–organic HTLs have been utilized in PSCs.248–253 Charge transport interlayers with low gas permeability function as barriers for the migration of volatile decomposition products, which increases the operational lifetime of PSCs. Therefore, chemically inert VOX has been used in the PTAA/VOX bilayer HTL on top of a perovskite in a PSC architecture, which resulted in a value of up to 20% with negligible degradation, even after 4500 h of light soaking. The inorganic interlayer helps to suppress charge recombination and promotes efficient hole extraction at the carbon–perovskite interface.
Ge et al.240 introduced a self-organized percolative architecture composed of Co3O4–SrCO3 as the HTL in PSCs. The charge carriers are likely to be confined within the Co3O4 network by the wide-bandgap SrCO3 matrix and guided along a shortened percolative path. This continuum of conductive Co3O4 phase is essential for effective charge transport (Fig. 9e). The percolation of the two phases offers optimized interfacial band alignment along with improved charge collection in the HTLs. In this architecture, holes are energetically transferred and confined in nanosized Co3O4 networks, whereas the wide bandgap SrCO3 helps to reduce recombination chances by blocking electrons (Fig. 9f). Consequently, the JSC value reached 23.23 mA cm−2 and the PCE increased to a high value of 21.84% (Fig. 9g) compared to PCE values of 8.08 and 15.47% for SrCO3 and Co3O4 HTL-based PSCs, respectively.

Conclusion and future perspectives
In this review, we attempted to summarize the recent progress in the use of metal oxides as ETLs and HTLs for the development of high-performance stable PSCs. Various metal oxides are discussed for ETLs (e.g., TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, WO3, Nb2O5, etc.) and HTLs (e.g., NiO, CuO, Cu2O, MoO3etc.). Systematic summarization of optimizing metal oxides as CTLs in designing high-performance stable PSCs has been performed by discussing efforts such as morphological tuning, elemental doping, and surface passivation of metal oxides with interface engineering at the interface of the metal oxide and perovskite layer. Moreover, the means by which these approaches enhance charge transportation, reduce charge recombination with improved light absorption, and significantly impact the performance and stability of PSCs are also discussed. Using these approaches, metal oxide nanostructured CTLs have achieved high efficiency (PCE up to a certified value of 25.5%), suppressed hysteresis, and excellent stability (retaining 95% after 102 d of storage in atmosphere). However, some challenges need to be explored in future studies.
The properties and facile synthesis procedures of metal oxides have made them potential candidates for CTLs in PSCs. Although metal oxide CTL-based PSCs have achieved great success, there are still a few areas in which improvements are required, which are elaborated below.
1. New synthetic strategies should be implemented for low-temperature metal oxide CTLs with better conductivity and electron mobility. This will extend the application of the metal oxide CTLs to devices with various structures (i.e. n-i-p or p-i-n, flexible or stretchable, tandem) without processing issues.
2. Most metal oxide CTLs used in PSCs are binary metal oxides. However, a few ternary metal oxides such as BaSnO3 and SrTiO3 exhibit good optical and electrical properties for use in PSCs. Therefore, further exploration of the materials with more complex composition is needed.
3. Reducing interfacial energy loss is essential to achieve PSCs with higher performance and stability. Atomic scale structure, energy band alignment and defects at the interface between the perovskite and metal oxide CTLs were still barely studied. Therefore, further research efforts are needed to achieve an optimized interface between the metal oxide CTLs and perovskite layer.
We believe that addressing these issues in optimizing and developing metal oxide CTLs will help to understand the fundamental material science and engineering to fabricate efficient, high-performance, low-cost PSCs for future commercialization.
