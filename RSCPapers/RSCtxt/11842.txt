, Accepted 4th July 2023First published on 8th July 2023AbstractA D–D′–A–D′–D′′–D′–A–D′–D type photoactive oligomer (O-BT) based nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared for biomedical application. The O-BT NPs possessed a high extinction coefficient, excellent hyperthermia generation ability, satisfactory NIR-II fluorescence emission, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility, and could be used as high-efficiency phototheranostics for photothermal therapy and NIR-II fluorescence imaging.
Malignant tumors have become a major health threat to humans.1 Traditional anti-tumor oncotherapies, including surgery and chemotherapy, are often have numerous shortcomings, such as easy recurrence of the tumor after surgical treatment and ineluctable side effects to normal tissues during chemotherapy.2 In recent years, photothermal therapy (PTT), which uses therapeutic agents to generate hyperthermia upon irradiation for tumor ablation, has attracted tremendous concerns.3 There is dual-selectivity in PTT: photothermal agents can selectively enrich into the tumor site and then light can selectively irradiate the tumor site, substantially decreasing the systemic toxicity to normal tissues.4 In addition, drug resistance is hardly found with PTT.5 All these invaluable advantages show that PTT can be used as a hopeful alternative oncotherapy approach for various tumors (e.g. glioma, breast cancer and pancreatic cancer).
Imaging has been demonstrated as a pivotal point for tumor phototherapy, and has the ability to offer useful information about the tumor, as well as to optimize the therapeutic efficiency.6 In various imaging methods, fluorescence imaging (FLI) is an inexpensive, highly sensitive and non-invasive technique, which has been used to diagnose and monitor tumors in real-time. Nevertheless, tissue penetration depth, spatial and temporal resolution and signal-to-background ratio (SBR) are still limited for the traditional near-infrared (NIR-I, 650–900 nm) FLI.7 Compared with the NIR-I region, photon absorbance, scattering, and autofluorescence in the second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000–1700 nm) window are very low. Thus, NIR-II FLI can offer unparalleled penetration depth, resolution and SBR.8 Up to now, a series of NIR-II phototheranostic agents (such as inorganic and organic photoactive materials) with NIR-II FLI and PTT functions were constructed to solve the problem of the unmet medical needs.9 Nevertheless, the practical application of inorganic NPs was restricted due to their potential biotoxicity.10 Interestingly, organic dyes, including conjugated polymers and small molecules, have superior biosafety, regulatable chemical structure and optical performance, and they exhibit good application prospects for NIR-II FLI guided PTT.11 The ideal organic NIR-II phototheranostic agents should have outstanding absorption/excitation ability at 808 nm (optimal biological tissue transparency window in the NIR-I region), excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), satisfactory NIR-II fluorescence quantum yields (FQY) and good reproducibility. Conjugated polymers have been shown to have an outstanding photothermal performance under the irradiation of an 808-nm laser due to their large π-conjugate structure (usually an alternating D–A copolymerization structure (D = donor, A = acceptor)).12 However, their reproducibility was unsatisfactory because of the difficult preparation and purification procedures, that may cause different optical properties and molecular weights in various batches.13 Meanwhile, the FQY of conjugated polymers is usually too low to meet the requirements of high-efficiency NIR-II FLI. In comparison, small molecules possess outstanding FQY and reproducibility. However, they also have some shortcomings, such as low light absorption capacity, poor photothermal performance or a short excitation/emission wavelength, which may be due to their too limited π-conjugated skeleton (usually D–A–D structure).8a Therefore, the development of high-efficiency organic NIR-II phototheranostic agents with a balance of the previous indices is vitally important but is a major challenge.
Oligomers, another type of organic dye, have been successfully applied in the fields of organic photovoltaics and organic solar cells. The π-conjugation length of oligomers is between that of conjugated polymers and small molecules. Moreover, oligomers possess an explicit molecular structure without batch-to-batch variations, and are easy to purify.14 Hence, oligomers combine the merits of polymers and small molecules, and are more suitable for use as photoactive materials for NIR-II phototheranostics. In the research reported herein, the proof-of-concept application of oligomers for NIR-II phototheranostics was studied. Firstly, a D–D′—A–D′–D′′–D′–A–D′–D structured oligomer of O-BT was designed and synthesized. Using Pluronic F127, O-BT NPs were easily obtained, and they possessed good biosafety, high stability, and strong absorption in the range of 600–1100 nm (Maximum: 845 nm). Upon a single 808-nm laser illumination, the O-BT NPs can simultaneously give a bright NIR-II fluorescence signal and a splendid photothermal effect for NIR-II FLI guided PTT, showing a promising potential for tumor treatment (Scheme 1).

A new type of oligomer, O-BT, with a D–D′–A–D′–D′′–D′–A–D′–D scaffold was designed, in which 9,9-dioctylfluorene, thiophene and 4,8-di(2-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene as donor units, 6,7-bis(4-(decyloxy)phenyl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline as acceptor unit (Scheme S1, ESI†). The structure was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The maximum absorption and emission peaks of O-BT in THF were 786 nm and 987 nm, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). To achieve the in vivo application, O-BT was encapsulated into Pluronic F127 for the simple construction of O-BT NPs. The results from dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that the average size of the O-BT NPs was about 115 nm (Fig. 1a). The zeta potential of O-BT NPs was measured as 0.35 mV. Furthermore, after leaving O-BT NPs for 5 weeks, no obvious size change was found, suggesting that the NPs possess good long-term stability (Fig. 1b). The optical properties of O-BT NPs were subsequently studied. From the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum (Fig. 1c), the O-BT NPs exhibited a wide absorption in the range of 600–1100 nm with a maximum peak at 845 nm, and a shoulder peak at 779 nm, because of the existing strong intramolecular charge transfer effect within the O-BT. The extinction coefficient (ε) at 808 nm of O-BT NPs was 3.65 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1, indicating that the O-BT NPs possess an excellent light absorption ability (Fig. S4, ESI†). Moreover, the photostability of the O-BT NPs was further investigated by comparing it with indocyanine green (ICG), an FDA-approved dye. As shown in Fig. 1d, the absorption intensity of the O-BT NPs was almost constant with the increase of laser irradiation, whereas the absorption intensity of ICG decreased rapidly, demonstrating that the O-BT NPs have an outstanding photostability. In addition, obvious NIR-II fluorescence emission with a maximum peak at 1056 nm of O-BT NPs was found from the emission spectrum of O-BT NPs (Fig. 1c). The FQY of the O-BT NPs in water was 0.35% (using IR-1061 dye as a reference Fig. S5, ESI†). All these data confirmed that the O-BT NPs were suitable candidates for use in NIR-II phototheranostics.

Next, the photothermal conversion properties of O-BT NPs upon the illumination by an 808-nm laser were systematically studied. A sharp temperature rise of the O-BT NPs aqueous solution was found upon illumination with an 808-nm laser, and the maximum temperature of the solution was proportional to the concentration of the NPs. As shown in Fig. 2a, by changing the concentration of the NPs from 20 to 100 μg mL−1, the maximum temperature of the solution was enhanced rapidly to a higher level (from 37.7 an °C to 53.2 °C), whereas insignificant enhancement was observed for pure water, confirming that the O-BT NPs have an excellent photothermal response. The effect of the laser power density on the photothermal performance of the NPs was then studied. It was clearly observed from Fig. 2b that the photothermal performance of the NPs was dependent on the power density of the laser. Moreover, by monitoring the temperature fluctuation of NPs during the four on/off cycles of laser illumination (Fig. 2c), the O-BT NPs showed a gratifying photothermal stability. From one on/off cycle of the laser, the PCE of the O-BT NPs was calculated to be 41.2%, which is significantly better than that of the ICG (about 12-fold, Fig. 2d).

In vitro cellular uptake of the O-BT NPs by HeLa cancer cells was then investigated using flow cytometry. In the process of preparing NPs, FITC was added into O-BT NPs to obtain FITC NPs, which were convenient to realize uptake monitoring. Fig. S6 (ESI†) showed that the cellular internalization of the NPs increased with prolonged incubation time. Next, we estimated the biosafety of the O-BT NPs using the MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 3a, the O-BT NPs show insignificant cytotoxicity towards NIH-3T3 normal cells even at 120 μg mL−1, evidencing the excellent biosafety of the O-BT NPs. The in vitro photoinduced cytotoxicity of the O-BT NPs against HeLa cells was assessed. As shown in Fig. 3b, without laser illumination, the survival rate of the cells incubated with high concentrations of NPs (120 μg mL−1) was still greater than 80%, suggesting that the O-BT NPs possess imperceptible dark toxicity. Whereas after being exposed to the 808-nm laser, the average cell viability rapidly decreased as the NP concentration increased, indicating that the O-BT NPs can be regarded as efficient PTT agents for tumor therapy. A live/dead cell staining assay was used to verify the photocytotoxicity of the O-BT NPs. Fig. 3c shows that the HeLa cells were almost completely eliminated by the O-BT NPs + laser group, while no obvious death of the cells was found in the O-BT NP group. In addition, the therapeutic efficiency of the O-BT NPs upon 808-nm laser illumination was further appraised using flow cytometry (Fig. S7, ESI†). The results from the groups of PBS, PBS + laser, and O-BT NPs were consistent, suggesting that neither the O-BT NPs nor the 808-nm laser had apparent toxicity. The apoptotic percentage of HeLa cells in the O-BT NPs + laser group reached more than 80%, further authenticating the excellent treatment outcome of the O-BT NPs. All the results proved that the O-BT NPs are effective photothermal reagents for tumor treatment.

Because of the excellent NIR-II fluorescence emission of the O-BT NPs, the in vivo NIR-II FLI ability of the O-BT NPs was investigated. We first tested the NIR-II signal with various concentrations of the O-BT NPs aqueous solution. The O-BT NPs still possessed an excellent NIR-II signal even at low concentrations, and the signal intensity increased with increasing concentrations (Fig. S8, ESI†). After coating the O-BT NP solution on 14 mm of chicken tissue, the NIR-II signal can be still found, confirming that the NPs can be used for deep tissue imaging (Fig. S9, ESI†). Subsequently, the use of the O-BT NPs for in vivo NIR-II FLI was assessed. There was barely an NIR-II signal before systemic administration of the O-BT NPs. After intravenous injection of O-BT NPs into tails of tumor-bearing mice, the whole-body vessel structures could be immediately discerned with high quality (Fig. 4a, 10 min post-injection, and Fig. S10a, ESI†). The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) and SBR of vessels 1 and 2 were further determined (FWHM: 0.75 mm for vessel 1, 0.90 mm for vessel 2; SBR: 1.87 for vessel 1, 1.49 for vessel 2, Fig. 4b, and Fig. S10b, ESI†). Three hours after injection of NPs, an excellent NIR-II signal was found in the tumor region. The signal intensity gradually increased with time and finally achieved a peak at 30 h post-injection, and then slowly reduced afterwards (Fig. 4a and c). Interestingly, the signal of the tumor region could still be observed even at 54 h post-injection, suggesting that O-BT NPs possess a long-time imaging capability. The biodistribution of the O-BT NPs in vivo was estimated ex vivo using NIR-II FLI of tumors and major organs. Fig. 4d and Fig. S11 (ESI†) show that the liver and tumor had a significant NIR-II signal intensity, and other organs showed a low signal intensity, which indicated the tumor targeting feature of the O-BT NPs. Moreover, the biocompatibility of the O-BT NPs in vivo was confirmed by recording the body weight changes of the mice after intravenous injection of NPs into the tail (200 μL, 1 mg mL−1, Fig. S12, ESI†). All these discoveries verified that the O-BT NPs can serve as high-efficiency NIR-II phototheranostic agents.

In summary, to conquer the disadvantages of using conjugated polymers and small molecules, an ingenious molecular oligomerization tactic was adopted to construct a high-efficiency NIR-II phototheranostic agent with good batch-to-batch reproducibility, a strong light absorption ability, excellent photothermal performance and satisfactory FQY. A D–D′–A–D′–D′′–D′–A–D′–D type photoactive oligomer, named O-BT, with multiple D–A units and a precise molecular structure was designed and synthesized. The O-BT NPs with excellent biocompatibility were easily prepared to be used as multifunction theranostic platforms. The O-BT NPs possessed strong absorption in the range of 600–1100 nm with a high extinction coefficient (ε: 3.65 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1 at 808 nm). After 808-nm laser irradiation of O-BT NPs, high hyperthermia (PCE: 41.2%) and satisfactory NIR-II fluorescence emission (FQY: 0.35% in water) could be effectively acquired. The effect of hyperthermia for PTT in vitro was authenticated by measuring the cell death rate. Furthermore, the in vivo NIR-II FLI of O-BT NPs could be used for angiography and tumor detection. Overall, this work establishes an innovative strategy for the design and construction of high-efficiency NIR-II phototheranostic agents.§
