    , Accepted 19th February 2019First published on 20th February 2019AbstractSubstitution of Pb2+ sites with smaller isovalent ions has been regarded as an effective strategy to optimize the crystal lattice of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites such as releasing lattice strain, increasing the formation energy of vacancies and tuning the bandgap energy distribution. We report here the compositional engineering of the inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite by doping divalent hard Lewis acids (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+) and their application in all-inorganic perovskite solar cells free of hole transporting layers and precious metal electrodes. By optimizing the doping dosage, a maximal power conversion efficiency as high as 9.63% is achieved for a CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 based photovoltaic device, mainly attributed to the enlarged grain sizes and suppressed formation of point defect (vacancies) within perovskite films, therefore reducing the photocurrent loss within modules. Furthermore, the unencapsulated Sr-containing solar cell shows ultrastability comparable to that of state-of-the-art CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells under persistent attack in 80% relative humidity over 800 h. The increased efficiency and improved stability demonstrate all-inorganic perovskite solar cells with divalent hard Lewis acid doped CsPbBr3 perovskites to be a new frontier for thin-film photovoltaics.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved an unprecedented development in power conversion efficiency (PCE) owing to the persistent innovations in material optimization, structure design and fabrication technology.1–3 To date, the highest PCE for state-of-the-art hybrid PSCs has been increased to 23.7%, which is comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon solar cells.4 Despite the rapid PCE enhancement, the intrinsic instability of hybrid perovskites upon attack by moisture and heat is still an ongoing issue for practical applications owing to the component volatility and migration behaviors.5,6 Among various strategies to improve environmental tolerances of perovskite lattices, such as cation-exchange or encapsulation, the substitution of organic species (MA+ or FA+) with inorganic cesium ions (Cs+) to form all-inorganic cesium lead halide [CsPbX3 (X = Br, I)] perovskites is promising to significantly enhance the long-term stability.7–9 In particular, fully brominated CsPbBr3 presents excellent moisture- and thermal-tolerances in comparison to CsPbIBr2, CsPbI2Br and CsPbI3 halides.10–12 However, the PCE outputs of classic CsPbBr3 solar cells are generally inferior to those of hybrid PSCs owing to the large bandgap (2.3 eV) of the CsPbBr3 perovskite.13–15 It is a fact that the development of large bandgap perovskites is crucial for construction of multi-junction (tandem) solar cells to improve the efficiency of PSCs over the single-junction Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit with minimized current matching loss and maximized potential output.16–18 Till now, enormous efforts have been devoted to increasing the overall power conversion ability of large-bandgap based devices via overcoming the photovoltage plateau, realizing the potential application of large-bandgap perovskite materials in multi-junction photovoltaics.19 In this fashion, it is an undoubtedly persistent objective for CsPbBr3-based PSCs to enhance their efficiencies without sacrificing the long-term stability.
Substantial charge-carrier recombination within perovskite films has been found to be a key factor to limit the solar cell efficiency.20 According to previous reports, shallow states and vacancies can be effectively eliminated via incorporation of small ions into the perovskite lattice to reduce the ground boundaries and to maximize the formation energy of vacancy defects.21,22 Till now, the partial substitution of A-site or Pb-site cations in APbX3 perovskites has always focused on hybrid or CsPb(I + Br)3 perovskites, and the doping effect on the CsPbBr3 perovskite is still deficient. Thus, we have systematically explored the doping effect of lanthanide ions on the CsPbBr3 perovskite film and the corresponding photovoltaic performance in our previous work, demonstrating the significantly enhanced solar-to-electric conversion ability.15 However, it is found that the lanthanide ions are primarily located at the grain boundaries of the perovskite film rather than doping into the perovskite lattice during the formation of the CsPbBr3 perovskite owing to the higher metal ionic values, limiting the better understanding of substitution of Pb2+ sites with extrinsic ions on the crystal lattice as well as film quality. To address this issue, we experimentally realize the incorporation of divalent hard Lewis acid cations into CsPbBr3 to form CsPb1−xMxBr3 (x = 0–1; M = Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+) perovskite films. Arising from the enlarged grain sizes and reduced recombination, the optimal device with a FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3/carbon architecture achieves a champion efficiency as high as 9.63%, which is much higher than that of the pristine device with 7.25%-efficiency.
Experimental section
Materials
Unless stated otherwise, all materials and reagents were purchased from Aladdin and used without further purification.
Preparation of the TiO2 paste
TiO2 colloid was prepared by a sol-hydrothermal method. In detail, 10 mL of titanium tetrabutanolate was dropwise added to 100 mL of deionized water under vigorous agitation at room temperature for 30 min to obtain dehydrated filter powders. Subsequently, 10 mL of acetic acid and 0.8 mL of nitric acid were added dropwise to these filter powders. After vigorous agitation at 80 °C for 15 min, 160 mL of deionized water was added. When the reaction solution became semi-transparent, it was subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 12 h. Then, 0.4 g of commercial P25 was added and sonicated for 30 min, and then heated at 200 °C for another 12 h. The resultant colloid was finally mixed with 0.8 g of poly(ethylene glycol) (Mw = 20000) and 1 mL of the OP emulsifier, and then concentrated to 40 mL at 80 °C.
Solar cell fabrication
All the processes were conducted in an air atmosphere without humidity control. Prior to fabrication of solar cells, FTO coated glass was etched with zinc powder and HCl (2 M) to obtain the desired patterns and then thoroughly rinsed with detergent, acetone, isopropanol, ethanol and deionized water. A compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer was deposited onto FTO glass by spin-coating an ethanol solution of titanium isopropoxide (0.5 M) and diethanol amine (0.5 M) at 7000 rpm for 30 s and annealed in air at 500 °C for 2 h. The mesoscopic TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer was subsequently spin-coated onto the c-TiO2 surface using the as-prepared TiO2 paste at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed in air at 450 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrate was immersed in an aqueous solution of 0.04 M TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min, and then annealed in air for another 30 min at 450 °C.
The perovskite film was fabricated by a multi-step solution-processed technology developed by our group.10 1 M PbBr2 solution in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) containing various divalent hard Lewis acid cations at a stoichiometric range of 1–5% was spin-coated onto the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s at 90 °C. After being dried at 90 °C for 1 h, 0.07 M CsBr methanol solution was spin-coated onto the PbBr2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s and subsequently heated at 250 °C for 5 min. This process was repeated four times to obtain the ideal perovskite films. The obtained perovskite films were rinsed with isopropanol and dried at 250 °C again for 5 min. Finally, a carbon electrode with an average area of 0.09 cm2 was deposited on the perovskite film by coating carbon paste (purchased from Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd) through a doctor-blade method.
Characterization
The morphology of the perovskite films and mapping images of various elements were obtained using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, S4800, Hitachi). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared films were recorded using a X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 ADVANCE) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The lattice constants of the as-prepared films were calculated using Jade software. X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were recorded on a RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin Elmer) with Mg Kα radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of various perovskite films were obtained on a Meipuda UV-3200 spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 350–800 nm. UPS measurements were carried out using a Kratos AXIS ULTRA system with a helium discharge lamp, and with a concentric hemispherical analyzer for photoexcited electron detection. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay characterization of perovskite films was conducted with a Horiba spectrometer excited using a 510 nm laser. The PL spectra of perovskite films were recorded on a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer under 385 nm wavelength excitation. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of various devices were recorded using an IPCE kit developed by Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd. The J–V curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2, calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell). A black mask was applied on the surface of solar cells to avoid stray light. The trap state density was measured with a space-charge limited current (SCLC) model using the Mott–Gurney law, by constructing an electron-only device, from 0 to 1 V.
Results and discussion
Prior to the study of the photovoltaic performances of all-inorganic PSCs, we focused on understanding the doping mechanism of divalent hard Lewis acid ions in the host CsPbBr3 lattice. From the XRD patterns of all-inorganic perovskites in Fig. 1a and S1,† both CsPbBr3 and CsPb1−xMxBr3 films present typical orthorhombic perovskite lattices, referring to three characteristic peaks centered at 2θ = 15.2° (100), 21.7° (110) and 26.5° (111). No peaks for the impurity phase suggest that the perovskite films have high purity using the method reported here.23 In comparison to pristine CsPbBr3, the characteristic diffraction peaks shift to higher angles for CsPb0.97Mg0.03Br3, CsPb0.97Ca0.03Br3 and CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 perovskites (the doping dosages are systematically optimized, which will be discussed in the following section), whereas they shift to lower angles for the CsPb0.96Ba0.04Br3 film. The reasonable mechanism behind this phenomenon can be explained by the deviation of ionic radius between Pb2+ (1.190 Å) and divalent hard Lewis acids [Mg2+ (0.720 Å), Ca2+ (1.000 Å), Sr2+ (1.118 Å), and Ba2+ (1.350 Å)], leading to the contraction or expansion of the perovskite lattice.24,25 Assisting with the calculated d-spacing values in Fig. 1b and Table S1,† we can preliminarily deduce that the divalent hard Lewis acid cations have been successfully incorporated into the host CsPbBr3 lattice. To further validate the above-mentioned conclusion, XPS spectra are also investigated (see Fig. 1c and S2†). As expected, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Cs 3d, Pb 4f and Br 3d shift to higher binding energies by doping smaller radii ions (such as Mg2+, Ca2+ and Sr2+), and lower binding energies by doping larger Ba2+ ions. The lattice modulation of the volume ratio of [BX6]4− octahedra and the Cs+ cation, and re-distributed electron density owing to the different binding interaction between M2+ and Br− are responsible for the changed chemical states of various elements.26,27 Therefore, a schematic illustration in Fig. 1d demonstrates the substitution of the Pb-site cation in inorganic perovskites by M2+ ions.

(d) Schematic representation showing partial substitution (doping) of Pb2+ by various divalent hard Lewis acid cations. 
Top-view SEM characterization is performed to better understand the effect of divalent hard Lewis acid ions on the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 2, the average grain size of the CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 film is significantly increased to 870 nm from 390 nm for the pristine CsPbBr3 film, which can also be cross-checked by the enhanced diffraction peak intensity (see Fig. 1a). To the best of our knowledge, the optimized crystal construction is related to the formation energy of the corresponding perovskite.28 Together with the lattice contraction and thereby enhanced formation energy, it is understandable that the enlarged grain size is mainly attributed to the suppressed crystal nucleus formation. Furthermore, lower surface roughness of hard Lewis acid cation doped perovskite films is observed compared with the control sample. For the Ba2+-containing perovskite film, the slightly enhanced grain size may have arisen from the changed surface energy. According to previous reports, the reduced grain boundaries can significantly reduce the defect state and therefore optimize the solar-to-electric conversion ability of the corresponding devices.29 The homogeneous distribution of doped elements in perovskite films is another determining factor for high-performance solar cells. In this regard, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping images of various elements are recorded in Fig. S3 and S4,† confirming the successful fabrication of high-quality inorganic perovskite films. As a result, it can be concluded that incorporating divalent hard Lewis acids into the inorganic perovskite lattice favours the grain size enhancement, which will in turn improve the overall performance of the corresponding solar cells owing to the reduced recombination.

The all-inorganic PSCs with the architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CsPb1−xMxBr3/carbon free hole transporting material (HTM) and precious metal electrode are made in an atmosphere of air without humidity or oxygen control, and the details can be found in the Experimental section. Fig. 3a presents the cross-sectional SEM image of a typical device, having a multilayered structure with thicknesses of 100 nm, 400 nm and 15 μm for c-TiO2/m-TiO2, perovskite and carbon, respectively. Notably, the monolayer-vertical structured perovskite grains benefit the charge transportation and reduce the shunt current loss.30Fig. 3b shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of various PSC devices with and without divalent hard Lewis acid cations and the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1. Through systematically optimizing the doping dosages (x values), as shown in Fig. S5† and Table 1, it can be found that excess divalent hard Lewis acid cations will destroy the crystal lattice and thereby lead to inferior PCEs. Upon partially substituting Pb2+ with smaller cations, the CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 solar cell achieves a champion PCE as high as 9.63% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 7.71 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.54 V and a fill factor (FF) of 81.1%, which is much higher than the 7.25%-efficiency for the control device (Jsc = 6.89 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.37 V, FF = 76.8%). Fig. S6† shows the statistical photovoltaic data, demonstrating that the incorporation of divalent hard Lewis acid cations into CsPbBr3 perovskite films markedly enhances the solar cell performances, and the inorganic PSCs have high reproducibility using the method reported here. Based on XRD and SEM characterization, the PCE enhancement can be mainly attributed to the enlarged grain size and suppressed recombination reactions within the device.31 The IPCE spectra and stabilized power output characterization are also provided in this work to cross-check the promoting effects of divalent hard Lewis acid ions to PCE. As show in Fig. 3c and d, the integrated Jsc and stabilized efficiency are in accordance with the results obtained from J–V curves. IPCE spectra suggest that there is little expansion for light-response range up to 550 nm for the CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 device; therefore, the doped perovskites have reduced the optical bandgap owing to the re-distribution of electron density, which can be verified by the ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectra (see Fig. S7†) and the related photoluminescence spectra (see Fig. S8†).

We point out that the efficiency enhancement mainly originated from the reduced charge loss during the operation of the solar cell, and in this fashion, the charger transfer dynamics is important for high-performance platforms. Considering the modulation of bandgaps of inorganic perovskites upon introducing divalent hard Lewis acid cations, we have characterized the energy values of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) together with absorbance spectra (Fig. S7†) and UPS spectra (Fig. S9†). As shown in Fig. 4a, the smaller energy barrier for electron transfer from the CB of the perovskite to the CB of TiO2 (−4.0 eV) is favorable for accelerating the charge transfer and collection and therefore eliminating the bimolecular radiative recombination, which can also be cross-checked by the increased α value becoming closer to 1 (Fig. 4b, a factor related to recombination according to the formula of Jsc ∝ Iα, in which I represents light intensity).32 On the other hand, the greatly enhanced Voc is attributed to the improved perovskite film quality such as enlarged grain size and reduced grain boundaries, in which fewer defect states trap charges according to a recent report.33 To clarify this point, the defect assisted charge recombination dynamics of the as-fabricated devices are further investigated by plotting Voc as a function of light intensity, as shown in Fig. 4c. The minimized slope is 1.67kBT/q (where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and q is the elementary charge) by fitting the plot of Vocversus log-scaled light intensity linearly for the CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 PSC. In theory, this slope value is close to kBT/q under the condition of no trap-assisted recombination,34 therefore the lower slope values indicate low defect density of perovskite films by doping divalent hard Lewis acid cations. Meanwhile, hole-only devices with the architecture of FTO/NiO/perovskite/carbon are also fabricated to reveal the charge trap state density in the perovskite active layer under dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 4d, the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) in the doped device also presents a decreased tendency, an indicator of reduced trap state density.35 This phenomenon has also been observed in hybrid perovskite systems owing to the increased formation energy of vacancies.22 From this, it can be seen that defects in perovskites can be significantly eliminated owing to the lattice modulation and passivation effect from divalent hard Lewis acid cations, which are regarded as primary origin of segregation of halides and hysteresis.36 Thus, this compositional engineering is effective in prolonging carrier lifetimes (Fig. 4e) and alleviating efficiency difference under reverse and forward scan directions (Fig. S10†).

High PCE and improved stability under real conditions are equally important to meet the application-specific requirements. The CsPbBr3 based all-inorganic PSCs are always characterized by their superior humidity- and thermal-tolerances compared to the organic–inorganic hybrid or CsPb(I + Br)3 solar cells.37,38 In order to assess the stability of inorganic PSCs, the unencapsulated CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 based PSC is persistently attacked by 80% humidity at 25 °C over 800 h, and the photovoltaic data are plotted as a function of time. As shown in Fig. 5, all the photovoltaic parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE remain at over 95% of the initial values after 800 hours of storage, arising from the protection of the hydrophobic carbon electrode and inherently stable CsPbBr3 structure. Through the systematic study on CsPb1–xMxBr3 perovskites and corresponding inorganic PSCs, we demonstrate that doping divalent hard Lewis acid cations into the CsPbBr3 light-harvester to modulate the crystal lattice and to optimize charge transfer dynamics is a promising path to high-performance inorganic PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully doped divalent hard Lewis acid additives (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+) into CsPbBr3 halide and systematically investigated the doping effects on the photovoltaic performances of inorganic PSCs free of the HTM layer and noble metal electrode. After detailed structural characterization, the primary results reveal that an appropriate doping amount of divalent hard Lewis acid cations can enlarge the grain size and significantly suppress the carrier recombination reactions, which may be mainly attributed to the enhanced formation energy of vacancy defects. An unprecedented PCE up to 9.63% has been achieved for this HTM-free inorganic CsPb0.97Sr0.03Br3 solar cell. Upon persistent attack by 80% humidity in air, the efficiency of the solar cell remains nearly unchanged over 800 h. The high efficiency and improved stability demonstrate that the doping of divalent hard Lewis acid cations into the CsPbBr3 perovskite may provide new opportunities to develop high-performance inorganic PSC platforms.
