1. Introduction
Photodetectors, as a significant unit in intelligent optoelectronic systems, can convert an optical signal into an electrical signal, which have wide applications in many fields.1–11 Perovskite materials, which have unique optical and electronic characteristics (such as high optical absorption), long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, tunable optical bandgap, low-cost and simple fabrication processes, have triggered significant attention for the exploration of high performance perovskite-based optoelectronic devices (e.g., light-emitting diodes (LEDs),12–17 lasers,18–21 image sensors,22,23 and displays24), especially in emerging perovskite photodetectors (PPDs). These research areas offer a vast platform for perovskite materials, not just limiting their application to perovskite solar cells (PSCs).25–32 According to the bandwidth of their spectral response window, photodetectors can be categorized into two categories: broadband (i.e., panchromatic) photodetectors and narrowband (i.e., wavelength selective) photodetectors. Broadband photodetectors are predominantly applied in multicolor light detection and imaging, which require flat and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra across the desirable wavelength range. While, narrowband photodetectors with the ability of spectral discrimination are predominantly applied in specific wavelength light detection, such as biological detection, intelligent monitoring and security systems, which requires small full width at half-maximum (FWHM) and high EQE values in the wavelength range of their response window. As one of key parameters for evaluating the performance of photodetectors, an EQE of larger than 100% is desirable for highly sensitive photodetectors. The photomultiplication (PM, EQE ≫ 100%) phenomenon has been demonstrated in organic photodetectors (OPDs) based on the working mechanism of interfacial trap-assisted charge tunneling injection,33–38 which has been further successfully employed for the realization of PM-type PPDs.39,40 Various strategies have also been developed to improve the performance of PPDs, meeting the demands in a variety of industrial and scientific applications.41–46 In addition, extending the spectral response range of PPDs is an urgent issue for their practical application in broadband detection systems.47–52 However, to date, a comprehensive review about extending the spectral response range and improving the performance of PPDs has not been published.
Wavelength-selective photo-detection is necessary for narrowband photodetectors to achieve color discrimination, which is crucial for many applications, including color photography, machine vision, gaming and intelligent surveillance. In previously reported works, the strategies for realizing narrowband photodetectors mainly include: (i) the combination of broadband photodetectors and band-pass optical filters,53–55 (ii) the selection of photoactive layer semiconductor materials with intrinsic narrow absorption in the desired response windows;56–60 and (iii) the optical structure design.61–64 However, all of these strategies have drawbacks. In 2015, Paul's group demonstrated filter-free narrowband OPDs based on the new concept of charge collection narrowing (CCN),65 which was successfully introduced into filter-free narrowband PPDs.66–68 Benefitting from perovskite materials with tunable optical bandgaps,69–73 narrowband PPDs with a tunable spectral response were demonstrated, covering the whole visible (Vis) wavelength region.66,67,74 This type of narrowband PPD based on the CCN concept exhibit relatively low EQE values and lose its narrowband detection capability under a larger applied bias. The combination of the working mechanism of photomultiplication and the concept of charge injection narrowing (CIN) has been proven as an effective strategy for realizing filter-free PM-type narrowband OPDs,75,76 and consequently, the realization of filter-free PM-type narrowband PPDs with EQE larger than 100% can be foreseen. Accordingly, it is important to assess the progress and shortcomings of narrowband PPDs, while emphasizing their advantages and the most optimal strategies for designing devices and systems for highly sensitive narrowband photo-detection.
Perovskite–organic hybrid photodetectors have the advantages of both perovskite semiconductor materials (high charge carrier mobility and tunable optical bandgap)77–79 and organic semiconductor materials (facile solution-processing),80–83 and thus are expected to achieve special wavelength detection, exhibit superior performances, and further extend the spectral detection region. In addition, the promising multifunctional PPDs can overcome the limitation of the single functional model and meet the need of versatility in practical applications.33,84–86 Flexible PPDs have extensive applications in the field of wearable and portable devices owing to their reduced cost and weight.87–89 Combined with their transparent features, the flexible PPDs can be widely employed in various fields, including touch screens and interactive electronics.90–92 The novel self-powered PPDs, which can work without an external power source, open a significant route for next-generation optoelectronic devices that operate wirelessly and independently.93–95 Also, photodetector systems and arrays can be used to construct integrated optoelectronic products and achieve a variety of functions.96–98 All these promising research directions have attracted increasing attention and have potential practical application in intelligent optoelectronic systems.99,100 Furthermore, the introduction of the PM effect in future research trends will provide further transformative improvements, stemming from the exceptional performance of PM-type PPDs with ultrahigh EQE of ≫100%. PM-type photodetectors are particularly competitive for practical application because they avoid the use of pre-amplifier circuits and further simplify photo-detection system and cut costs.
In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent advances on PPDs from the perspective of device physics and materials science. The strategies for extending the spectral response range of PPDs and improving the performance of devices are discussed in detail. The method of realizing narrowband photodetectors and the recent advances on filter-free (or self-filter) narrowband PPDs are also discussed. Finally, we propose the promising future directions in this research field, including multifunctional PPDs, perovskite–organic hybrid photodetectors, flexible and transparent PPDs, self-powered PPDs, and photodetector systems and arrays. The hope is that this review will provide valuable insights into the current status of highly sensitive PPDs and spur new structure and device designs to further enhance the photo-detection performances of PPDs and meet the need of versatility in practical application.
2. Fundamentals of photodetectors
Photodetectors with different architectures are constructed to meet the demand of a variety of applications. In general, there are two types of device architectures, i.e., lateral structure and vertical structure. A schematic diagram of the device configurations of the lateral structure and vertical structure is exhibited in Fig. 1. Photodetectors based on the lateral structure include photoconductors and phototransistors; whereas, photodetectors based on the vertical structure include photodiodes (also called photodiode-type photodetectors) and PM (or called gain)-type photodetectors. All photoconductors, photodiodes and PM-type photodetectors are two-terminal devices with an anode and cathode. In contrast, phototransistors are three-terminal devices with source, drain, and gate electrodes.1 In photoconductors, there is no bottom-gate/dielectric layer. According to the spatial layout of the active layers and electrodes, photodiodes and PM-type photodetectors have a small electrode spacing with a short carrier transit length, which together generally provide a fast response speed and low driving bias. In contrast, photoconductors and phototransistors exhibit a slow response and high driving bias due to their large electrode spacing, where the response speed is sacrificed to maintain a high photocurrent.101
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the device configurations of (a) vertical structure and (b) lateral structure photodetectors. For photodetectors with a vertical (sandwich-like) topology, the incident light window is located at the bottom; whereas, for photodetectors with the lateral topology, the incident light window is located at the top.

The active layer of photodetectors is formed by constructing a homo-junction, planar heterojunction (PHJ) or bulk heterojunction (BHJ). Solution-processed perovskite active layer materials exhibit great potential in preparing efficient optoelectronic devices, such as: (i) large area fabrication by spin coating, roll-to-roll printing, spray coating and doctor blading; (ii) low temperature and ambient fabrication conditions; and (iii) compatibility with multiple ancillary materials and flexible substrates.103 Their processing versatility is particularly advantageous for top surface photo-detection schemes. This approach allows the direct incorporation of an ultrathin photoactive layer on top of the read-out integrated circuitry with high or even unity fill factors, which has great potential in compact, sensitive, high-resolution imaging systems. However, it is important to overcome the bottleneck of further miniaturizing sensor arrays while keeping high resolution and sensitivity. In addition to solution-processed semiconductors, optoelectronic properties can be tailored by selecting versatile materials with different band gaps and charge mobilities. In the following section, the types of photodetectors will be discussed in detail.
(i) Photoconductors. Photoconductors exhibit intrinsic photocurrent amplification (gain), and this display high sensitivity even for weak light. In photoconductors, one type of charge carrier can be recirculated through symmetrical contacts before recombining with the opposite charge. An external voltage is applied to read out the photon-induced change in conductivity, and gain can be achieved through multiple carrier recirculation. An efficiency higher than 100% may be obtained when more than one electron flows as a result of an absorbed single photon, where an incident photon triggers an electrical current flow provided by numerous electrons.104–112
(ii) Phototransistors. Phototransistors basically have the same three-terminal configuration as field-effect transistors (FETs). These devices consist of a conductive channel with a unipolar source and drain electrodes on either side, and the conductivity of the channel is controlled by a gate terminal. In the operational mode of a normal FET, the amount of current flowing in the accumulated channel is controlled by the magnitude of the gate voltage at a given source to drain bias. For phototransistors, the control of channel conductance can be additionally enabled by light illumination. Opto-electronically modulated gate-programmable semiconducting channels can aid or hinder charge transport and simultaneously provide gain, working as optoelectronic amplifying switches.113–121 Both photoconductors and phototransistors can have high EQE exceeding 100%, resulting in high photocurrent and responsivity.122–125
(iii) Photodiode. Photodiodes possess a vertical structure with their active layer sandwiched by electrodes. The photodiode configuration can be categorized as conventional and inverted, in which the presence of interface layers is considered to effectively reduce the dark current for obtaining high detectivity, accompanied by small noise equivalent power (NEP) and large linear dynamic range (LDR). For photodiodes with the photovoltaic effect, an absorbed photon can generate at best one electron–hole pair with an EQE of less than 100%, which is codetermined by photon-harvesting, exciton dissociation, charge-carrier transport and collection efficiency.126–135 The collection of photogenerated carriers is controlled by the built-in potential due to the different work functions of two electrodes. An additional reverse bias is often applied to increase the charge collection efficiency. In contrast, solar cells as a power source, are designed to work in a circuit with an external load. In experiment, the effect of external load on solar cells can be simulated by applying forward bias onto solar cells. The optimization orientations are different for photodiodes and solar cells, although they have similar device structures. In particular, self-powered photodetectors can be achieved when photodiodes work at zero bias, which is similar to solar cells working under short circuit conditions. In addition, the response speed of photodiodes is determined by the transit time of carriers, rather than lifetime. Normally, the response speed of photodiodes is faster than that of photoconductors.
(iv) PM-type photodetector. Photomultiplication in inorganic semiconductors has been known and used for decades, where its underlying mechanism is multiplication by impact ionization triggered by hot carriers. Since neither carrier heating by an electric field nor avalanche multiplication is possible in disordered organic semiconductors with a large exciton binding energy, charge multiplication seems to be unlikely in organic materials. To date, the reported PM-type OPDs are mainly based on the working mechanism of interfacial trap-assisted charge tunneling injection.33–38,136–141 The photogenerated charge carriers trapped in interfacial traps generate a Coulomb field, which induces interfacial band bending to assist tunneling injection of opposite charge carriers from an external circuit. The tunneling injection of charge carriers under light illumination leads to the PM phenomenon with EQE of higher than 100%. Interestingly, this working mechanism has been successfully introduced in the fabrication of PM-type PPDs.39,40 In addition to the working mechanism of PM-type PPDs based on interfacial trap-assisted charge tunneling injection,39,40 there are two possible mechanisms to realize photocurrent multiplication in PPDs with a vertical structure: (i) interface-barrier-modification mechanism via field-driven ion migration142,143 and (ii) ferroelectric polarization mechanism.144 Here, the key parameters used for characterizing the performance of photodetectors are summarized and presented in Table 1.1

3.1 PPDs with extended spectral response
The general formula for perovskite materials is ABX3, where, the larger cation A is usually the organic methylammonium (CH3NH3 or MA) or formamidinium (HC(NH2)2 or FA) ion, the smaller cation B is typically the Pb ion and the anion X is a halogen ion (Cl, Br and I). The response spectra of PPDs can be adjusted due to their perovskite materials with tunable optical bandgaps, which can be realized by utilizing different halides in perovskite materials. As shown in Table 2, the spectral response range of PPDs based on MAPbX3 perovskite covers the ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR) region (300–800 nm). The spectral response range of PPDs can be extended via the following strategy: (i) the utilization of mixed-halide or mixed Sn–Pb perovskite materials with smaller optical bandgaps, (ii) the combination of inorganic or organic materials and perovskite materials and (iii) the combination of up-conversion materials and perovskite materials.

3.1.1 The utilization of hybrid perovskite materials. 
The spectral response range of typical MAPbI3-based PPDs is generally limited owing to their relatively wide optical bandgap. Accordingly, perovskite materials with smaller optical bandgaps can be realized by combining halogen ions,145–148 Sn and Pb,47,149 or Cs-doped FAPbI3.150
Nakamura et al. reported lateral PPDs with MAPbI3−xClx thin films protected by a spin-coated water-resistant fluorous polymer (CYTOP).145 The PPDs exhibited a broadband spectral response from 254 to 800 nm, with a high R of 7.85 A W−1 and 14.5 A W−1 for solar-blind UV light (254 nm) and white light, respectively. The PPDs simultaneously demonstrated high environmental stability, which was endowed by the waterproof properties of the spin-coated CYTOP layer. Peng et al. also reported MAPbI3−xClx-based PPDs with a broadband spectral response from 405 to 808 nm.146 The effect of different electrodes on the performance of the PPDs was investigated. The performance of the PPDs with Cu or Al electrode was inferior to that with Au and Ag electrodes, which is ascribed to the instability of their chemical properties.
Recently, Yan et al. demonstrated broadband phototransistors with MAPbI3−xClx/poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) heterojunctions, exhibiting ultrahigh R of ≈109 A W−1 and D* of ≈1014 Jones in a broad spectral response range from 350 to 1100 nm at a low operating bias of 0.5 V.148 The high sensitivity was attributed to the photo-gating effect at the vertical heterojunction, which is mainly due to the long carrier lifetimes and strong light absorption in the perovskite layers. The normalized R spectrum of the phototransistors at a given light intensity exhibited a sharp rising edge near the wavelength of 800 nm, corresponding to the band edge absorption of the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite (≈1.55 eV), as shown in Fig. 2a. The perovskite film could absorb light at wavelengths of up to 1.9 μm owing to the existence of traps in the film. Therefore, the photo-response of the phototransistors at wavelengths longer than 800 nm can be attributed to the excitation of carriers from the valence band to the trap states within the perovskite bandgap, as shown in Fig. 2b. In such a phototransistor, the photo-generated electrons are not necessarily mobile in the perovskite film. Thus, an ultrahigh R in the NIR region was achieved, which is different from the case of the vertical-structured PPDs, with R sharply decreasing to 0 for wavelengths longer than 800 nm.

Highly sensitive broadband PPDs can be realized with low optical bandgap perovskite materials as active layers, which are fabricated by blending FASnI3 and MAPbI3 perovskite precursors. Zhang and co-workers demonstrated highly sensitive PPDs with a low bandgap (≈1.25 eV) (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 perovskite, which exhibited a broadband spectral response from 300 to 1000 nm.47 The performance of the broadband PPDs could be optimized by adjusting the thickness of the perovskite and C60 layers (Fig. 3). The EQE values in the NIR region were larger than 65% when the thickness of the (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 layer was increased to 1000 nm, while the EQE values in the UV-Vis region remained unchanged. The increase in EQE values in the NIR region was attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting by the thick perovskite layers and correspondingly enlarged grains. The performance of the broadband PPDs was further optimized by adjusting the thickness of the C60 layer, which simultaneously served as an electron transport layer and optical spacer layer. The optimized PPDs with a 1000 nm perovskite layer and 70 nm C60 layer exhibited an almost flat EQE spectrum from 350 to 900 nm, suppressed dark current of 3.9 nA, high R of over 0.4 A W−1 and high D* of over 1012 Jones in the NIR region at −0.2 V. Alex et al. also demonstrated high performance broadband (350–1000 nm) PPDs with the stable low-bandgap Sn-containing perovskite MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3, which was processed with an antioxidant additive, ascorbic acid (AA).149 The addition of the AA additive with excellent antioxidant property not only retarded the formation of Sn vacancies caused by Sn oxidation but also facilitated film formation by modulating the perovskite crystallization kinetics, thus enhancing the stability of the Sn-containing perovskite against oxygen. As a result, the broadband PPDs exhibited an inhibited leakage current and enhanced SNR, achieving a high R of over 0.1 A W−1 with a D* of over 1012 Jones in the range of 800–970 nm. Such low-cost, solution-processed broadband PPDs with high performance demonstrate the promising potential of using small bandgap perovskites for future optoelectronic applications.

Luo et al. developed broadband (240–750 nm) lateral PPDs based on Cs-doped FAPbI3 (FA1−xCsxPbI3) perovskite thin films, which possessed a bandgap of 1.51 eV.150 Continuous FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 perovskite thin films with high quality were obtained, which was confirmed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The lateral PPDs with FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 thin films exhibited high R and D* and ultrafast response speed (τr/τf: 45 ns/91 ns) at 0 V, showing good self-powered properties. The excellent performance of the PPDs is probably related to the high quality and unique optoelectronic property of their FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 thin films and the Schottky junction at the Au/perovskite interface under light illumination. In addition, the PPDs demonstrated weak degradation under white light illumination after storage at ambient condition for 45 days.


3.1.2 Combination of inorganic materials and perovskite materials. 
The introduction of inorganic materials with strong NIR or UV absorption is an effective strategy for extending the spectral response range of PPDs.48–50,90,151–158 Gong et al. reported uncooled ultrasensitive solution-processed broadband PPDs with a vertical device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/PbS quantum dots (QDs)/MAPbI3/(6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/Al, where the PbS QDs acted as broadband light-sensitizers in both the Vis and NIR regions, and MAPbI3 acted as both trap state passivator and Vis light-sensitizer.49 The PPDs exhibited a broad spectral response from 375 to 1100 nm, with high R over 300 mA W−1 and 130 mA W−1, corresponding to high D* exceeding 1013 Jones and 5 × 1012 Jones in the Vis and NIR regions, respectively. All these device performance parameters are comparable to that of their inorganic counterparts, which indicates that this strategy offers a facile and promising route for advancing the performance of room-temperature-operated broadband PPDs.
Sargent et al. demonstrated efficient solution-processed field-emission broadband PPDs with a spectral response across the Vis and short-wavelength infrared region (SWIR) (300–1400 nm) by implementing a quantum-dot-in-perovskite (QDiP) in the photodiode architecture and programming its operation in the field-emission regime (Fig. 4).48 QDiP materials combine the advantages of colloidal quantum dot (CQD) sensitization (therefore, bandgap tunability), superior passivation of the CQDs surface states considering their epitaxially matched interface, and excellent carrier transport properties with the low-trap density and high mobility of perovskites. The design strategy accomplishes the harvesting and extraction of charges photogenerated in the CQDs via field emission into the perovskite phase. Meanwhile, this approach optimizes carrier ejection into the perovskite and transport through this host medium, and minimizes recapture to the CQDs. The field-emission QDiP photodetectors showcased D* on par with Si and perovskite photodiodes in the Vis regime, which surpassed that of the best CQD photodiodes in the SWIR region with the measured D* of ≈4 × 1012 Jones. Their excellent performance originated from the synergy between CQD sensitization and a dedicated charge transport channel. The field-emission QDiP photodetectors also exhibited a bandwidth of 60 kHz, an above-unity gain, noise current densities of 0.1 pA Hz−1/2 and an LDR exceeding 60 dB. Thus, these results pave the way towards novel functional photonic devices with applications in photovoltaic and light emission.

The metal oxides with stronger UV absorption such as ZnO,50,151–154 and TiO290,155–157 have been employed to extend the spectral response at the short-wavelength region. Wang and Zhou et al. reported self-powered, UV-Vis tunable, broadband PPDs based on ZnO nanorod array/MAPbI3 perovskite film heterojunctions, with a spectral response range from 250 to 800 nm.153 The ZnO nanorod arrays were fabricated via the hydrothermal method and annealed in different atmospheres. The PPDs with ZnO nanorod arrays annealed under vacuum showed the highest R in the Vis region; whereas, the PPDs with ZnO nanorod arrays annealed in air exhibited the highest R in the UV region. Furthermore, when the annealing atmosphere of the ZnO nanorods was changed from vacuum to air, the dominant detection region of the PPDs was altered from the Vis to UV region. The UV-Vis tunable photo-response characteristics resulted from the reduced carrier concentration associated with oxygen vacancies after annealing treatment in different atmospheres, which were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Roqan et al. demonstrated high-performance vertical broadband PPDs with Gd-doped ZnO nanorods/MAPbI3 perovskite heterojunction, which were fabricated on cost-effective metal substrates.50 The PPDs were sensitive to a wide spectral range, spanning the UV to infrared (IR) region (250–1357 nm), with high R of 28 and 0.22 A W−1 and high D* values of 1.1 × 1012 and 9.3 × 109 Jones for white light and IR illumination, respectively. Their detection capability for IR (>1000 nm) light resulted from the intra-band transition in the perovskite material, as confirmed by optical characterizations. The metal substrate boosted carrier injection, leading to a higher R than that for the conventional devices fabricated on glass substrate, while the presence of Gd increased the ZnO nanorod performance. Yan and co-workers reported high-performance and self-powered broadband PPDs with the vertical structure of TiO2/graphene/MAPbI3 perovskite, possessing a wide detection range from 260 to 900 nm.155 TiO2 can form a Schottky junction with graphene to efficiently separate and then transport photogenerated excitons at the graphene/perovskite interface.
The combination of organic materials and perovskite materials for realizing broadband PPDs will be introduced in Section 5.2 Perovskite–organic hybrid photodetectors.


3.1.3 Combination of up-conversion materials and perovskite materials. 
For perovskite materials with wide optical bandgaps, the introduction of up-conversion materials results in unique advantages for realizing NIR light detection. Liu et al. demonstrated flexible lateral PPDs composed of MAPbI3 microarrays and NaYF4:Yb,Er up-conversion nanoparticle (NP) monolayer, exhibiting a broadband spectral response range from 420 to 980 nm (Fig. 5a and b).159 The efficient up-conversion of NIR photons from the up-conversion NPs resulted in excellent NIR photo-detection capability with R and D* reaching as high as 0.27 A W−1 and 0.76 × 1012 Jones, respectively. Meanwhile, the incorporation of the up-conversion NP capping monolayer was found to decrease the reflectivity and enhance the photoluminescence (PL) decay of the MAPbI3 crystals, which yielded a 3 times higher D* in the Vis spectrum with high value of 5.9 × 1012 Jones. Moreover, bending duration, long-term environmental stability and water resistance tests were conducted. The hydrophobic up-conversion NPs capping monolayer serving as a moisture inhibitor endowed significantly enhanced long-term environmental stability, e.g., 70% vs. 27% performance retained after 1000 h exposure in 30–40% relative humidity air without encapsulation for the PPDs with MAPbI3/up-conversion NP bilayer and the neat MAPbI3, respectively. Furthermore, broadband PPDs with spectral response from the UV to Vis to NIR region (260–1100 nm) were fabricated based on air-stable cubic (α) CsPbI3 QDs surface-modified with an up-conversion material (NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs) using a facial low temperature spin-coating process.51 The photo-detection capability around the NIR region was attributed to the up-conversion photoluminescence of the NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs. More specifically, the NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs up-converted the NIR photons to Vis light, which could be effectively absorbed by the α-CsPbI3 QDs. The PPDs with α-CsPbI3 QDs/NaYF4:Yb,Er QDs exhibited not only prominent optoelectronic properties, but also superior structural and compositional stability under heat in ambient air.

Pan et al. demonstrated lateral hybrid PPDs based on erbium ytterbium silicate (EYS) nanosheets and MAPbI3 perovskite, which exhibited a remarkable spectral response in the NIR region (1530–1565 nm).52 The single-crystalline EYS nanosheets provided high-efficient up-conversion Vis light emission under the illumination of NIR light and also acted as a high quality microscale waveguide cavity to confine and propagate the emitted up-conversion light, which efficiently coupled into and simultaneously excited the adjacent perovskite to realize photo-detection (Fig. 5c). The novel hybrid waveguide photodetectors with EYS nanosheet/MAPbI3 exhibited a significantly improved photo-response compared to that with the pristine perovskite, and the achieved R was as high as that of the widely reported microscale silicon-based sub-bandgap photodetectors at the full telecommunication wavelength, even at low driving bias. More importantly, the achieved hybrid waveguide photodetectors showed the light response speed of ≈900 μs, which is much faster than that previously reported for hot electron silicon-based photodetectors and non-avalanche semiconductor photodetectors at the same telecommunication wavelengths, simultaneously keeping comparable R and EQE values. With the advantages of low cost, facile fabrication, and superior performance, the developed microscale EYS/perovskite hybrid waveguide telecommunication photodetectors are promising candidates for advanced on-chip integrated photonic and optoelectronic applications at the telecommunication band.
Broadband photodetectors with hybrid perovskite materials have been realized by the introduction or displacement of the cation and anion (halogen ion). Encouragingly, all-inorganic perovskite materials can be obtained by replacing MA or FA with the Cs ion or other cations, which have attracted tremendous attention. Meanwhile, lead-free perovskite materials have been developed to eliminate the disadvantage of toxic Pb for the environment and humans. In addition to high performance organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite-based photodetectors with various active layer morphologies, all-inorganic PPDs with various active layer morphologies exhibit high performance and potential applications. A summary of the performance parameters of PPDs with emerging all-inorganic perovskite160–168 and lead-free perovskite169,170 is shown in Table 2.

3.2 PPDs with enhanced performance
The performance of PPDs can be improved via the following routes: (i) engineering of the device structure and interface layer, e.g., metal–semiconductor–metal (MSM) structure and mixed interface layer, (ii) synthesis of various perovskite active layer morphologies (also called morphology engineering), e.g., single crystals, nanowires (NWs), nanorods, 2D-structure, island-structure, and (iii) construction of a heterojunction between perovskite materials and inorganic materials.

3.2.1 Engineering of device structure and interface layer. 
To date, there has been some pioneering work on utilizing MAPbX3 as the active component in phototransistor-type devices. However, the performance of these devices, particularly channel mobility and gate tuning, needs to be improved. Wu and Li et al. presented perovskite phototransistors based on solution-processed MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films.43 They investigated the effects of gate voltage and light illumination on the transport of the perovskite channels. These phototransistors exhibited clear ambipolar carrier transport characteristics, that is, they functioned in both accumulation (p-type) and inversion (n-type) modes. Highly balanced photoinduced carrier mobilities of 0.18 (holes) and 0.17 (electrons) cm2 V−1 s−1 were observed for MAPbI3, which increased to 1.24 (holes) and 1.01 (electrons) cm2 V−1 s−1 for the doped variant MAPbI3−xClx. The perovskite phototransistors exhibited reliable high performance and tunability, with excellent R of 320 A W−1 and ultrafast response speed of less than 10 μs.
Pan and co-workers also demonstrated high performance PPDs with the lateral MSM structure of ITO/MAPbI3/ITO.171 By using a high-quality perovskite thin film prepared via the solvent-induced crystallization method and adopting a novel device configuration based on the photon recycling effect, the PPDs exhibited high EQE of 4.1 × 104% and R of 219 A W−1 at a low bias of 1 V. The device working mechanism was further disclosed based on an energy band bending model, indicating a gain of ≈100 in the PPDs with the perovskite thin film. Xu et al. reported high-gain and fast-response PPDs with the vertical structure of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/MAPbI3/Au, exhibiting excellent optoelectronic performance with high photoconductive gain in the order of 102, high R above 150 A W−1, large LDR of 120 dB, and short response time of 0.67 μs.172 These results indicate that PPDs with the simple MSM structure exhibit great potential for low-cost and high-performance optoelectronic device applications.
Interface engineering is also an effective strategy for improving the performance of optoelectronic devices, especially photodetectors.173 Sargent et al. reported PPDs via material-tailoring of TiO2/perovskite/(2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene) (Spiro-OMeTAD) junction towards applications in photo-detection, a field in need of fast, sensitive, low-cost, spectrally tunable materials that offer facile integration across a broad range of substrates.174 By the insertion of a composite Al2O3/PC61BM front contact interface layer between TiO2 and MAPbI3, the PPDs exhibited a 1 μs temporal response and stable operation in the detection of over 7 billion transient light pulses through a continuous pulsed-illumination period in air. The PPDs also showed a reduced dark current, and enhanced the R of up to 0.4 A W−1 under a wavelength of 600 nm in the low-bias regime, which is superior to the red light detection in the crystalline silicon photodiodes used in commercial image sensors. Gong et al. demonstrated high performance PPDs based on the conventional vertical structure, with a high R in the wavelength range of 375 to 800 nm.175 By additionally modifying the sol–gel-processed TiO2 compact layer with solution-processed PC61BM, the performance of the PPDs was further improved through the simultaneously enhanced photocurrent via the charge carrier transport at the MAPbI3/PC61BM interfaces and suppressed dark current densities (JD) by passivating the inhomogeneous TiO2 film. As a result, the PPDs exhibited high EQE of over 80% and D* larger than 4 × 1012 Jones.
Choy et al. demonstrated the excellent performance of PPDs with the vertical structure of ITO/NiOx:PbI2/MAPbI3/C60/2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/Ag.176 On the one hand, the room-temperature solution-processed NiOx:PbI2 nanocomposite structures facilitated the growth of compact and ordered MAPbI3 crystalline films, and passivated the surface of the MAPbI3 perovskite. On the other hand, the NiOx:PbI2 nanocomposite structures functioned as effective hole extraction layers, which suppressed the dark current through the large electron injection barrier at the interface of ITO/NiOx:PbI2 and achieved efficient hole extraction due to the suitable energy-level alignment with the perovskite. After the thickness of the NiOx:PbI2 nanostructure was optimized, the carrier recombination lifetime of MAPbI3 increased and the capacitance of the PPDs was reduced. Consequently, the PPDs achieved an ultralow dark current density of 2 × 10−10 A cm−2 at −200 mV and large LDR of 112 dB. Besides, the PPDs exhibited a high R (corresponding to an EQE between 70% and 90%), covering the full near-UV to Vis spectral region, large measured D* of up to 1013 Jones, and fast fall time of 168 ns limited by the RC time constant.


3.2.2 Morphology engineering. 
Perovskite single-crystal materials exhibit high carrier diffusion lengths, low trap-state densities, and high absorption coefficients and dielectric constants,177–180 which are beneficial for the realization of high performance PPDs.181
Yan and Sun et al. reported lateral structure PPDs fabricated on the (100) facet of MAPbI3 single crystals, which performed much better than the PPDs fabricated on MAPbI3 polycrystalline films.182 Centimeter-sized MAPbI3 bulk single-crystals were fabricated via the bottom seeded solution growth (BSSG) method, as shown in Fig. 6a. The absorption range of the MAPbI3 single crystal was broader than that of the MAPbI3 polycrystalline film, exhibiting excellent absorption in the Vis region with an absorption cut-off edge of 840 nm. The PPDs with the MAPbI3 single crystal demonstrated a broader spectral response from 275 to 790 nm. Furthermore, the R and EQE of the PPDs with the MAPbI3 single crystal were about 100 times higher than that of the PPDs with the MAPbI3 polycrystalline film. This is attributed to the higher carrier mobility and longer carrier diffusion length due to the low trap density of the MAPbI3 single crystal. Compared with the similar lateral PPDs with MAPbI3 polycrystalline film, the PPDs with the MAPbI3 single crystal also exhibited better stability and durability. Lin et al. reported photodiodes and photoresistors based on mm-sized MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 single crystals fabricated via inverse temperature crystallization.183 The photodiodes based on the MAPbI3 single crystal exhibited a measurable photo-response under 1064 nm laser illumination, which is considerably below its bandgap. This strong sub-bandgap photo-response is consistent with the absorption of sub-bandgap trap states (as shown in Fig. 6d), which is mainly located at the surface of single crystals with a low bulk trap state density. To verify the origin of the sub-bandgap photo-response and further enhance the sub-bandgap photo-response, lateral photoresistors were fabricated on the surface of the single crystals to more efficiently utilize the trap state absorption. The R of the photoresistor based on MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 single crystals are exhibited in Fig. 6e and f, respectively. The improved NIR responsivity was attributed to the lateral geometry of the device, which resulted in more surface sub-bandgap trap state absorption. The spectral response range of the PPDs based on the MAPbBr3 and PMPbI3 single crystals was 400–890 nm and 600–950 nm, respectively, which exhibited NIR detection ability with appropriate performance metrics.

Macroscopic large-sized perovskite single crystals cannot be grown on planar substrates, which hinders their potential for optoelectronic integration. Sargent and Bakr et al. reported lateral PPDs based on integrated MAPbBr3 single crystals, as shown in Fig. 7a.184 Large-area, planar, integrated MAPbBr3 single-crystal films were fabricated using the anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization technique, which exhibited mobility and diffusion lengths comparable to that of large-sized single crystals. The integrated MAPbBr3 single-crystal film was deposited on the top of ITO contacts, forming a lateral MSM photodetector. The energy diagram of the PPDs is shown in Fig. 7b, with two Schottky barriers contacting the active layer. The R and gain of the lateral MSM PPDs with integrated MAPbBr3 single crystals are shown in Fig. 7c, exhibiting high R exceeding 4000 A W−1 and high gain above 104 in the range of 375–540 nm. Furthermore, lateral PPDs with integrated MAPbCl3 single crystals were fabricated, which exhibited a Vis-blind UV spectral response (Fig. 7d).185 Thus, the performance of PPDs can be significantly improved by using substrate-integrated single crystals, which overcomes the severe limitation of poor electronic properties induced by MAPbCl3 thin films. Accordingly, MAPbCl3 perovskite with a wide bandgap is a promising candidate for light detection and transparent electronics. Liu and co-workers demonstrated PPDs based on an FAPbI3 single crystalline wafer, which was fabricated via the inverse-temperature reactive crystallization process and then associated wafer-slicing process.186 The FAPbI3 single crystal exhibited broader absorption compared to its microcrystalline thin film. The availability of a large FAPbI3 single crystalline wafer made it possible to fabricate integrated circuits. Consequently, an array of 153 photodetectors on a piece of thin wafer was designed and fabricated (Fig. 7e), demonstrating the feasibility of the mass production of integrated circuits on the perovskite wafer. The PPDs with the FAPbI3 single crystalline wafer exhibited superior performances to that with the FAPbI3 microcrystalline thin film (Fig. 7f), which was attributed to the low trap state density and high carrier mobility in the FAPbI3 single crystalline wafer.

Huang et al. demonstrated perovskite thin single crystal photodetectors with a vertical p–i–n structure of ITO/poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA)/MAPbBr3 (or MAPbI3)/C60/BCP/Cu.187 The trap densities of the thin single crystal were 10–100 folds lower than that of the polycrystalline thin film owing to the absence of grain boundaries. The PPDs with MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 thin single crystals exhibited low noise of 1–2 fA Hz−1/2, yielding a high D* of 1.5 × 1013 Jones. The absence of grain boundaries also reduced carrier recombination and induced a linear response under strong light, which is superior to that of the PPDs based on polycrystalline thin films. In particular, the PPDs with the MAPbBr3 thin single crystal exhibited a linear response to green light from 0.35 pW cm−2 to 2.1 W cm−2, corresponding to a record LDR of 256 dB. Recently, Ma et al. reported perovskite single-crystalline thin-film photodetectors with the vertical structure of ITO/MAPbBr3/Au/Pt, in which a Schottky barrier was formed at the MAPbBr3/Au interface.188 When the MAPbBr3 single crystalline thin film thickness was decreased from ≈10 μm to hundreds of nanometers, the gain and lowest detectable power of the PPDs improved by four and two orders of magnitude, respectively, illustrating the crucial role of the single crystalline thin film thickness. The PPDs with thickness-optimized MAPbBr3 single crystalline thin films exhibited high photoconductive gain of 50 million and gain-bandwidth product of 70 GHz. Additionally, the detection limit of the PPDs was down to the 100-photon level at 180 Hz modulation bandwidth. The superior performance of the PPDs was attributed to the thickness-optimized MAPbBr3 single crystalline thin film with much higher mobility and longer recombination time.
A series of PPDs with high responsivity was also realized based on perovskite materials with various morphologies, including nanowires,189–191 nanograting,192 nanonets,193 nanoflakes,194 2D structures195–197 and island structures.198 Semiconductor nanowires demonstrate unique features compared to their thin film counterparts, such as enhanced light absorption, mechanical integrity and reduced thermal conductivity. Song et al. fabricated MAPbI3 nanowires via a one-step self-assembly solution method.190 The self-assembly growth of the nanowires was mainly attributed to the low symmetry of MAPbI3 and strong intermolecular interactions. The uniform distribution of the nanowires, patterning deposition and nanowire alignment were carried out on common substrates (glass, SiO2/Si, and FTO). The controllable distribution of nanowires is crucial for the application of PPDs based on low dimensional materials. The lateral PPDs with MAPbI3 monolayer nanowires exhibited a broadband spectral response from 390 to 850 nm, with D* of 2.5 × 1012 Jones and R of 1.3 A W−1. Zhang et al. exhibited porous MAPbBr3 nanowires via self-template-directed synthesis.189 The initial formation of MAPbBr3 perovskite layers on the surface of the precursor nanowires and subsequent dissolution of the organic component of the Pb-containing precursor nanowires led to the production of porous wire-like perovskite nanostructures with the preservation of their 1D morphology. The high sensitivity and stability of the PPDs with porous MAPbBr3 nanowires were attributed to their unique porous 1D geometry, abundant active sites, and excellent ability to absorb light. Horváth et al. also reported the controlled growth of MAPbI3 nanowires in arrays of open nanofluidic channels191 The R of the lateral PPDs with MAPbI3 nanowires reached 6 × 106 A W−1. The PPDs with significantly enhanced R were used as low-light imaging sensors and single-photon detectors.
Hu et al. reported lateral MSM PPDs implemented by nanoimprint lithography (NIL).192 A schematic of the NIL process with three different Si molds is shown in Fig. 8a. The optical properties of both the nonimprinted and nanoimprinted films were studied by characterizing the transmission, reflectance (Fig. 8c), PL, and PL lifetime of the MAPbI3 films on glass substrates, which indicated that higher optical absorption can be realized by proper mold nanostructure design for favorable photon trapping in perovskites. Furthermore, the influence of the NIL pattern geometries on the optoelectronic characteristics of the PPDs was investigated (Fig. 8d). Compared with the PPDs with no imprint, the performance of all the PPDs with the nanoimprint obviously improved, and the PPDs with the nanoimprinted MAPbI3 nanograting exhibited the best performance. The on/off ratio and R of the PPDs with the nanoimprinted MAPbI3 nanograting were approximate 7 times and 35 times higher than that of the PPDs with no imprint, respectively. The excellent performance of the PPDs with the nanoimprinted nanograting likely resulted from the high crystallinity and favorable nanostructure morphology, which contributed to higher mobility, longer diffusion length, and better photon absorption.

Qi et al. demonstrated lateral PPDs with MAPbI3 nanonets, which were prepared via a facile nanosphere lithography method.193 The fabrication process for the novel MAPbI3 nanonets and nanobowl arrays was same by utilizing monolayer colloidal crystal (MCC) templates on different substrates. The only difference is that highly ordered MAPbI3 nanonets with high crystallinity were produced on a variety of flat substrates; whereas, regular MAPbI3 nanobowl arrays were fabricated on a coarse substrate. The light absorption ability of the nanonets and nanobowl arrays was much better than that of the compact film, which may be attributed to the reduced light reflection and multiple light scattering inside the nanoholes of the nanonet and nanobowl structure. Meanwhile, the light absorption of the nanonets in the range of 400–800 nm was higher than that of the nanobowl array, probably owing to the slightly higher walls of the nanonets. The fabrication process and device structure of the PPDs with MAPbI3 nanonets are shown in Fig. 8e. The photocurrent of the PPDs with MAPbI3 nanonets was higher than that of the PPDs with MAPbI3 compact films (Fig. 8f). The PPDs with the nanonets exhibited a high R, fast response speed and good stability in air. The significantly improved performance of the PPDs may be rationalized by considering that the unique perovskite nanonet arrays possessed enhanced light harvesting ability, multiple light scattering centers, direct carrier transport pathways, and larger grain sizes with enhanced crystallinity. Furthermore, flexible PPDs with nanonets were prepared on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, which exhibited excellent bending durability.
Huang et al. reported flexible lateral PPDs with MAPbI3 nanoflakes, which were fabricated via a low-temperature two-step synthesis method.194 The typical optical image of a hexagonal MAPbI3 nanoflake on SiO2/Si substrate (Fig. 8h) exhibited a smooth surface and regular symmetric hexagonal shape, indicating potential high-crystallinity. The flexible PPDs with MAPbI3 nanoflakes were fabricated on a flexible PET substrate (Fig. 8i). As shown in Fig. 8j, the flexible PPDs exhibited a high R of 12 A W−1 and corresponding EQE of 5889%. For flexible optoelectronic devices, an important figure of merit is the repeatable bending stability. After 400 bending cycles, the photocurrent, switching on/off ratio, and dark current of the flexible PPDs showed little fluctuation, indicating their excellent flex resistance and bending stability. Increasing attention has been focused on flexible photodetectors, which will be introduced in Section 5.3 Flexible and transparent photodetectors.


3.2.3 Construction of heterojunctions. 
PPDs with the combination of inorganic materials and perovskite materials exhibit not only broadband spectral response but also improved performances.48–50,90,152,155,158 The enhanced performance of these PPDs can be attributed to formation of heterojunctions, which facilitate exciton dissociation and charge-carrier transport. In addition to the heterojunction formed between perovskite materials and metal oxides (QDs), there are many high performance PPDs with heterojunctions between perovskite materials and transition-metal dichalcogenides46,199–203 or graphene.204–207
Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with a 2D semiconductor structure, such as tungsten disulfide (WS2), tungsten diselenide (WSe2), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), are considered to be some of the most promising nanomaterials for future electronic and optoelectronic applications. TMDs possess exceptional physical, electrical, and optical properties of tunable bandgaps, high mobility, and low driving currents, which may help suppress the dark current and promote charge separation in photodetectors. However, despite their superior optical properties, it is physically difficult for TMDs to absorb sufficient light due to their atomically thin thickness. Li and Wu et al. demonstrated lateral PPDs with heterojunctions of monolayer WS2 and MAPbI3 films.199 The PPDs with the WS2/MAPbI3 heterojunction exhibited a significantly suppressed dark current, and enhanced photocurrent and response speed owing to the high mobility of the WS2 monolayer, efficient interfacial charge separation and transfer and suppressed charge recombination. Furthermore, the MAPbI3 perovskite layers grown on an atomically flat WS2 monolayer substrate exhibited improved crystallinity, which facilitated the high performance and fabrication of other perovskite-based devices. Neto and Sow et al. also reported high performance lateral PPDs with a hybrid bilayer of WSe2–MAPbI3.200 The WSe2 monolayer was modified with laser healing to significantly reduce unwanted carrier traps by passivating them via oxygen substitution. The optimized PPDs with laser healing exhibited a wide spectral range of 300–700 nm and ultrahigh R of 110 A W−1 and EQE of 2.5 × 104%, which are three orders of magnitude higher than that of PPDs with a pristine monolayer. Huang and Duan et al. fabricated vertical PPDs based on van der Waals heterojunctions, with the structure of graphene/2D WSe2/MAPbI3/graphene by taking advantage of the layered characteristics of lead iodide (PbI2) and vapor-phase intercalation.201 The PPDs with the vertical device structure of graphene/MAPbI3/graphene (GPG) exhibited high gain of 2200 and R of 950 A W−1. To further increase the built-in potential of the PPDs with the GPG structure and explore more tunability with gate voltage, an extra WSe2 layer was inserted between the bottom-graphene electrode and MAPbI3 layer to fabricate PPDs with the structure of graphene/2D WSe2/perovskite/graphene (GWPG). The PPDs with the GWPG structure exhibited a high on/off ratio of 106, transistor behavior with distinct gate-tunable diode characteristics and open-circuit voltages.
Shin and Park et al. demonstrated lateral PPDs with an MoS2/MAPbI3 hybrid structure.46 The transfer of most of the photogenerated carriers from MAPbI3 to MoS2 was confirmed via PL and UV-Vis analysis of the MoS2/MAPbI3 samples. The R and D* of the PPDs with MoS2/MAPbI3 were 4.9 × 103 A W−1 and 8.76 × 109 Jones, respectively, under 520 nm laser illumination. Furthermore, PPDs with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES)/MoS2/MAPbI3 were created via APTES n-doping on the MoS2 region, which exhibited an enhanced R of 2.11 × 104 A W−1 and D* of 1.38 × 1010 Jones. The improved performance can be mainly attributed to the reduced recombination rate of photogenerated charges. The number of photogenerated carriers collected by the PPDs with APTES doping was larger than that for the PPDs without APTES doping. Additionally, the photocurrent of the PPDs with APTES/MoS2/MAPbI3 increased with a decrease in incident light power, resulting from the reduced scattering between the photoexcited electrons. The performance degradation of the PPDs with APTES/MoS2/MAPbI3 caused by moisture was minimized by adopting a new encapsulation bilayer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). Zhou and Chhowalla et al. reported lateral PPDs with a 2D MoS2 nanosheet/MAPbI3 heterojunction.202 There are two types of 2D MoS2 crystal structures: semiconducting trigonal prismatic (2H phase) and metallic octahedral (1T phase) crystal structures. The 1T phase of MoS2 is metastable and can be relaxed to the thermodynamically stable 2H phase of MoS2 by annealing in argon at 300 °C for 30 min. Accordingly, the effect of the metallic and semiconducting phases of 2D MoS2 on the performance of the PPDs was investigated. The PPDs with the 1T phase MoS2/MAPbI3 exhibited exceptionally high R and EQE values. However, the metallic nature of the 1T phase MoS2 resulted in a high dark current, which in turn led to impractical on/off ratios. In contrast, the PPDs with the 2H phase MoS2/MAPbI3 exhibited relatively low on/off ratios while preserving R and detectivity. Jiang and Wang et al. also reported the fabrication of lateral PPDs with an MoS2/perovskite hybrid structure via the two-step vacuum deposition of an MAPbI3 film onto MoS2 flakes.203 The PPDs with MoS2/MAPbI3 exhibited a high R of 104 A W−1. The improved performance of the PPDs was attributed to the balance between light absorption in the perovskite layer and effective transfer of photogenerated carriers from perovskite into the MoS2 channel, which was confirmed by the absorption spectroscopy and PL analysis. All these results indicate that combinatory TMDs-perovskite hybrids are promising building blocks in optoelectronics.
Graphene is a promising optoelectronic material for light detection due to its wavelength-independent light absorption and high operating bandwidth. Another type of PPD with enhanced performance was fabricated based on a graphene/perovskite heterojunction. Cho et al. demonstrated lateral PPDs consisting of monolayer graphene and an MAPbI3 film, which exhibited a broadband spectral response from 400 to 800 nm.204 The PPDs with graphene/MAPbI3 provided a large R of 180 A W−1 and an ultrahigh effective quantum efficiency of 5 × 104%, which were attributed to the efficient charge transfer from graphene to perovskite. For the PPDs without graphene, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the MAPbI3 layer would be recombined within the lifetime of photogenerated electrons. Also, the empty states in the MAPbI3 valence band produced by photon absorption would be filled with electrons transferred from the graphene layer, which limited the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the MAPbI3 layer of the PPDs with graphene/perovskite. As a result, the photogenerated electrons in the MAPbI3 layer were trapped in the conduction band without decaying, which was confirmed by the significant PL quenching phenomenon in the graphene/MAPbI3 system. The effective photo-gating effect induced by trapped carrier changed the conductivity of the graphene channels via capacitive coupling, leading to high performances for the PPDs with graphene/MAPbI3. Bao et al. also demonstrated high performance lateral PPDs consisting of monolayer graphene and dispersed MAPbBr2I islands, which exhibited a broad spectral range from 250 to 700 nm.205 The MAPbBr2I islands with well-controlled size and distribution were fabricated via a one-step, solvent-induced, fast crystallization deposition method. The bulk recombination rate of photogenerated carriers in the perovskite islands was lower than that in the perovskite bulk thin film. The PPDs with the graphene/MAPbBr2I heterojunction exhibited a high R of 6 × 105 A W−1 and gain of 109 electrons per photon, which were attributed to the effective charge transfer and photo-gating effect. The efficient charge transfer between graphene and MAPbBr2I was confirmed by the PL quenching and shortened photocarrier lifetime. Real-space evidence for the charge transfer and photo-gating effect was obtained from scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and photocurrent mapping experiments.
The surface plasmonic effect of metal nanostructures is a promising tool to boost the performance of optoelectronic devices, e.g., photodetectors.208 Accordingly, Sun and co-workers demonstrated plasmonic-enhanced graphene-perovskite hybrid photodetectors.209 Au NPs with surface plasmon resonance localized at about 530 nm were synthesized and integrated into graphene/MAPbI3 hybrid photodetectors. Compared with the photodetectors with pristine graphene/MAPbI3, the photodetectors with embedded Au NPs exhibited two-times higher photo-responsivity and faster photo-response speed. The performance enhancement of the photodetectors with Au-NP/graphene/MAPbI3 islands was attributed to following two factors: (i) due to the low thickness of graphene, the surface plasmonic effect of Au NPs can effectively enhance the near-field of perovskite and thus facilitate light-harvesting and (ii) the enhanced light-harvesting in perovskite mainly occurs in regions close to the perovskite–graphene interface, where photo-induced carriers have relatively short paths to diffuse toward graphene, favoring a fast photo-response speed.
All-inorganic perovskites have localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) well overlapping with that of noble metal nanocrystals. Zeng and co-workers demonstrated all-inorganic PPDs based on Au nanocrystals/CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with the synergistic effect of preferred-orientation film and plasmonic effect with the advantages of both high performance and solution processing, as evidenced by the 238% plasmonic enhancement factor and 106 on/off ratio.210 The CsPbBr3 and Au nanocrystals inks were assembled into high-quality films via centrifugal-casting and spin-coating, respectively. The photocurrent increased from 0.67 to 2.77 μA with centrifugal-casting. Moreover, the photocurrent increased from 245.6 to 831.1 μA with Au nanocrystal plasma enhancement, leading to an enhancement factor of 238%. The photocurrent enhancement was ascribed to the remarkable near-field enhancement effect induced by the coupling between Au LSPR and CsPbBr3 photogenerated carriers, which was revealed by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. The results demonstrated that the use of preferred-orientation films with the synergistic enhancement of Au nanocrystals in PPDs is one of the most effective strategies to improve device performance, which can be widely applied in the fields of optical communication, safety monitoring, and biological sensing.

4. Highly sensitive narrowband perovskite photodetectors
4.1 Methods for obtaining narrowband photodetectors
Wavelength-selective photo-detection is necessary to achieve colour discrimination, which is crucial for many applications, such as colour photography, machine vision, gaming and intelligent surveillance. In previous reports, the strategies for realizing narrowband photodetectors mainly include: (i) the combination of broadband photodetectors and band-pass optical filters,53–55 (ii) the selection of photoactive layer semiconductor materials with intrinsic narrow absorption in the desired response windows56–60 and (iii) the optical structure design, such as Fabry–Perot resonant cavity-based photodetectors,61 plasmonic grating-Schottky photodetectors,62 silicon nanowire-based vertical photodetectors,63 and organic donor:acceptor blend-based vertical photodetectors with a resonant optical cavity device architecture.64 However, all these strategies have drawback. For the first strategy, the introduction of filters makes the design of detector systems complicated and integration difficult. Meanwhile, there are inherent limitations of filters, for example, high cost, sensitive to surface scratches and contamination. Also, the full wavelength region is not covered. The second strategy is infeasible for narrowband spectral response in the long-wavelength range, that is, it remains impracticable to realize narrowband Vis or IR detection. In the case of the optical structure design (the third strategy), it has a few challenges such as complex configuration and high cost. Also, the plasmonic enhanced absorption is limited to a specific spectral range and not widely tunable.
In 2015, Paul's group introduced the new concept of CCN in thick BHJ-based OPDs, realizing spectrally selective light detection.65 This concept provides a novel promising strategy for achieving filter-free narrowband OPDs.213 Subsequently, this concept was successfully developed in ternary organic/inorganic blend-, perovskite single crystal-, and perovskite-thick film-based photodetectors,66–68,214–216 which exhibited a tunable narrowband spectral response range dependent on the thickness of the active layer. CCN, as an alternative filter-free strategy, relies on recombination loss, by which only a small fraction of incident photos with energies close to the bandgap of the material is absorbed in the bulk and collected efficiently, leading to very narrowband photo-detection with compromised R. Furthermore, narrowband photodetectors based on the CCN strategy exhibit relatively low EQE values and lose their narrowband detection capability under a larger applied bias.
4.2 Narrowband perovskite photodetectors
Highly sensitive narrowband PPDs without optical filters have been developed, which have wide applications requiring spectral selectivity and background light suppression, such as in optical communications, biological sensing and surveillance.
Fang and Huang et al. presented highly narrowband PPDs with perovskite single crystals, with an FWHM of <20 nm.66 Their narrowband response spectra were continuously tuned from blue to red by changing the halide composition and thus the bandgap of the single crystals synthesized by solution processes (Fig. 9b). Based on the comparison of charge collection efficiency modelling and experimentally measured EQE spectra, it was demonstrated that surface-charge recombination is responsible for the narrowband photo-detection. The narrowband photo-detection model set-up and working mechanism of the narrowband PPDs are shown in Fig. 9c. The narrowband photo-detection can be explained by the strong surface-charge recombination of the excess carriers close to the crystal surfaces generated by short-wavelength light. The excess carriers generated by below-bandgap excitation move away from the surfaces and can be much more efficiently collected by the electrodes, assisted by the applied electric field. The PPD with a 0.3 mm-thick MAPbBr3 single crystal lost its narrowband detection capability at a reverse bias of >4 V (Fig. 9d), which can be explained by the fact that a larger applied electric field quickly pushes the photogenerated charges away from the surface and thus even charges photogenerated by short-wavelength light can contribute to the photocurrent. Furthermore, the performance of the narrowband PPDs can be further improved by introducing a gain mechanism to increase the device responsivity, and by suppressing the noise by buffer layer engineering. In addition, the resolution of the PPDs or the FWHM of the response spectrum can be further narrowed by optimizing the quality of the single crystals to reduce the Urbach tail width. A higher off-resonance rejection ratio will be achieved if more trap states (such as Pb2+ clusters) can be introduced on the surface of the perovskite single-crystal to increase the surface recombination rate to further quench the short-wavelength response. The new design paradigm presented in this work provides an alternative approach for the realization of optical-filter-free UV, Vis or IR narrowband PPDs, which will have broad applications where background noise emission needs to be suppressed.

Burn and Lin et al. reported filter-free narrowband red, green and blue PPDs, all with FWHM of <100 nm.67 This type of narrowband PPD was achieved by utilizing the CCN concept (Fig. 10a) in organohalide perovskites and mixed lead halide semiconductors, where the two absorption onsets were controlled by varying the blend ratio of the halides in the perovskite semiconductors (Fig. 10b) and/or by the addition of an organic (macro) molecule in the film to form a composite junction (Fig. 10c). The working principles of the CCN photodetectors is shown in Fig. 10a. In the high-absorption (α) region, the Beer–Lambert law dominates light absorption, and carriers are mainly generated near the transparent electrode (‘surface generation’). This increases recombination and reduces the charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) due to the strongly imbalanced electron/hole transport. In the low-α region, cavity effects influence the light absorption significantly for optically thick junctions, and carriers are generated in the volume of the active layer (‘volume generation’). The EQE can be shaped by manipulating ηcoll, that is, the IQE. The FWHM can be controlled by tuning the two onsets of α (reported as FWHM ≈ λonset1 – λonset2). The added organic components in the composite films increase free carrier recombination, allowing only volume-generated carriers to be collected, and thus achieving the electrical requirements for CCN. Relying on this strategy, the optical and electrical transport properties of the PPDs were simultaneously controlled, which produced a unique set of fully tunable narrowband responses across the entire Vis spectrum (Fig. 10f). Critically, all the narrowband PPDs were highly selective for their design windows, with sharp photo-response increases and decreases. This is very promising for purer illuminant-independent color recognition and contrast.

Kuang et al. demonstrated filter-free narrowband PPDs based on a large-area MAPbBr3 perovskite crystal film.68 The ingenious space-limited inverse temperature crystallization (SLITC) method was first reported for the in situ synthesis of a 120 cm2 large-area MAPbBr3 crystal film on FTO glass (Fig. 11a). The key point was structuring a narrow space to limit the lateral growth of the perovskite crystal, which realized both size and thickness controllable growth. A 120 cm2 MAPbBr3 perovskite crystal planar film with a thickness in range of 0.1–0.8 mm was in situ grown and further applied in narrowband PPDs (Fig. 11b). The high narrow-response PPDs exhibited significant performances with broad linear response within the incident light power density range of 10−4 to 102 mW cm−2, wavelength selectivity of 61.3 dB and 3 dB and cutoff frequency (f−3dB) of ≈110 kHz at low bias of −1 V. Large-area perovskite plane crystals with thin thickness in the micrometer size are rarely achieved. Thus, the SLITC method reported successfully paves the way for the in situ growth of large-area thin perovskite crystal films on various conductive substrates, which will significantly stimulate the wide potential applications of perovskite single crystals in practical optoelectronic devices.

Zhang and co-workers demonstrated self-filtered narrowband PPDs with ultrafast and tuned spectral response.74 The self-filtered method is reported to realize narrowband PPDs by applying hybrid perovskites layers with the same or a slightly larger bandgap as filters integrated into photodetectors. The working principle of narrowband PPDs with a thick active layer and the newly design self-filtered narrowband PPDs are exhibited in Fig. 12a and b, respectively. The narrowband PPDs with the self-filtered design have good color selectivity with an FWHM of 28 nm owing to the sharp absorption edges of perovskite materials and the light rejection ratio of >1000. Superior to the narrowband PPDs with a thick single crystal, narrowband PPDs with the self-filtered design maintain the major advantages of perovskite thin film photodetectors, such as quick response speed, which are only limited by the resistance capacitance constant as a result of the reduced thickness of the perovskite active layer. By tuning the bandgaps of perovskite filters and the associated perovskite active layers, the response bands of the PPDs are continuously tuned in the whole Vis light region, producing red-green-blue (RGB) PPDs (Fig. 12d), whose spectral response matches well with that of human eyes. The combination of printing technology will enable the fabrication of image sensors at high throughput and low cost in the future. In addition, the self-filter strategy may be employed to reduce the operating bias of PM-type OPDs with a thick poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) active layer and simultaneously maintain their excellent narrowband detection capability.75,76

Excellent performance narrowband photodetectors should have the following characteristics: (i) small FWHM of the desired response window, (ii) high EQE in the desired response window and be blind to light outside the desired response window, that is, a high rejection ratio and (iii) low dark current in combination with large LDR. Filter-free narrowband PPDs based on the CCN concept exhibit the disadvantages of relatively low EQE and loss of narrowband detection ability under a larger applied bias. However, the limitation of losing narrowband detection ability under a larger bias can be eliminated by adopting the self-filter strategy.74 Benefitting from the realization of photocurrent multiplication in PPDs,39,40,142–144 filter-free PM-type narrowband PPDs can be achieved by combining the working mechanism of interfacial trap-assisted charge tunneling injection with the concept of CIN. This strategy has been employed to fabricate filter-free PM-type narrowband OPDs, which can maintain excellent narrowband detection capability under a larger applied bias.34,75 PM-type narrowband PPDs have unique advantages as a result of their high EQE of ≫100%. Thus, the combination of the PM effect and CIN concept provides a new powerful promising route for the construction of filter-free PM-type narrowband PPDs with simple device structure, easy integration and tunable responsive spectrum.
5. Research trends on perovskite photodetectors
5.1 Multifunctional perovskite photodetectors
Although both broadband and narrowband photodetectors have already achieved high performances, these photodetectors exclusively operate under single spectral response models and consequently exhibit single response spectra, which limit their broader applications. Thus, realizing highly sensitive multifunctional photodetectors with tunable spectral response ability will meet the need of versatility in practical applications.33,34,75,86,217,218
Wu and Bakr et al. demonstrated lateral PPDs with perovskite microcrystalline films, which exhibited broadband and narrowband detection ability dependent on bi-directional light illumination.84 MAPbI3 microcrystalline films grown on a patterned ITO substrate were fabrication by utilizing the advantages of the rapidity of inverse temperature crystallization and the device integrability of the solution perturbation technique. The absorption edge of the MAPbI3 microcrystalline film was located at ≈830 nm, which was red-shifted by 50 nm compared with that in the polycrystalline film. The dark current and photocurrent of the PPDs upon bottom (from ITO side) and top (from air/perovskite side) illumination are shown in Fig. 13a, which exhibited rectifying characteristics resulting from the Schottky contact between the MAPbI3 microcrystalline film and ITO electrodes. The mechanism of narrowband detection in the PPDs based on a 200 μm thick MAPbI3 microcrystalline film is depicted in Fig. 13b, which is also named CCN. The PPDs exhibited broadband (upon bottom illumination) and narrowband (upon top illumination) spectral detection ability (Fig. 13c and d), and their EQE values were above 105% and 104% upon bottom and top illumination, respectively. The FWHM of their narrowband spectral response was about 33 nm. The PPDs also exhibited a fast response speed, high R and D*. Their superior performance was attributed to the lower interfacial Schottky barrier induced by the photogenerated carrier trapped at the MAPbI3/ITO interface under light illumination, resulting in more efficient charge extraction and photo-response. Moreover, the response spectrum of the PPDs could be tuned by adjusting the halide composition in the perovskite framework.

Zeng and Xu et al. reported PPDs with ultra-large all-inorganic perovskite bulk single crystals, which exhibited Vis (one-photon) and IR (two-photon) dual-modal light harvesting and sensing.85 The ultra-large 25 cm3-volume CsPbBr3 single crystal ingot with a trapping state density as low as 1 × 109 cm−3 was prepared via a modified Bridgman method using a four-zone furnace, which was readily sliced into single crystal wafers with a diameter of 25 mm for various optoelectronic devices. The key optical and electrical properties of the CsPbBr3 single crystal wafers were characterized, which exhibited a high Vis absorbance coefficient of about 105 cm−1, high nonlinear IR two-photon absorption (TPA) coefficient of 3.7 cm per Goeppert-Mayer (GM), and excellent carrier transport properties with large diffusion lengths >10 μm and high carrier mobility of ≈2000 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 14a). These excellent merits match well with the requirements of high-performance Vis-IR dual-modal light-harvesting and detection optoelectronic devices, which were demonstrated by the CsPbBr3 single-crystal PPDs operated under the irradiation of both Vis and IR light sources with light on/off ratios higher than 103 (Fig. 14d). These results demonstrate that CsPbBr3 single crystals with high Vis-IR dual-modal light harvesting capability and excellent electrical transporting properties have huge potential application in various optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells, photodetectors and lasers.

Wu et al. demonstrated polarization-sensitive PPDs based on 1D perovskite single crystal arrays with strict alignment, precise position, homogeneous size and high crystallographic order, through a facile and high-efficiency solution-processing method.219 The nucleation site and growth direction of the perovskite crystals were manipulated using a micropillar-structured template with asymmetric wettability, i.e., lyophobic tops and lyophilic sidewalls. “Capillary trailing” was generated at the lyophobic–lyophilic boundary, with a regulated shape, position, fluid flow and dewetting dynamics, thus leading to a highly controllable crystallization process and yielding 1D-structure growth along the [100] orientation. All-inorganic 1D CsPbBr3 arrays with high crystallinity and ordered crystallographic alignment were fabricated using the asymmetric-wettability system. The 1D CsPbBr3 crystal arrays exhibited a low charge trap density and long carrier lifetimes, which were attributed to their low defect density and high crystallographic order. Thus, the PPDs with 1D CsPbBr3 crystal arrays had a high R exceeding 1000 A W−1 and fast response speed. In particular, the photocurrents generated in the 1D CsPbBr3 arrays were demonstrated to have polarization dependence, where the maximum photocurrent emerged in the direction parallel to the axial direction of the 1D arrays. In contrast, the minimum photocurrent emerged after 90° rotation of the polarization angle, generating a polarization anisotropic ratio of ≈2.6 (Fig. 15). The emergent application of polarization-sensitive photo-detection was ascribed to the anisotropic light absorption derived from the strict alignment of 1D structures. Overall, the novel asymmetric-wettability system developed in their work not only provides a facile and effective approach for fabricating high-quality and crystallographically ordered perovskite crystals, but also can be extended to other material systems for microstructure integration.

5.2 Perovskite–organic hybrid photodetectors
Organic–inorganic hybrid photodetectors have attracted considerable attention because they combine the advantages of both organic and inorganic materials.77–79,220–223 The emerging photodetectors combining organic and perovskite materials can achieve the special wavelength detection, exhibit superior performances, and extend the spectral response range. A summary of the performance parameters for perovskite–organic hybrid photodetectors is exhibited in Table 3.

5.2.1 Special wavelength detection. 
The high atomic numbers of Pb, I and Br in hybrid perovskite materials make them ideal for X-ray224–227 and gamma-ray228 detection. Direct X-ray detectors were realized via the combination of perovskite materials and organic materials. Heiss et al. demonstrated sensitive X-ray detection via direct photon-to-current conversion.224 The MAPbI3 perovskite provides the fascinating combination of fast photo-response and high absorption cross-section for X-ray photons (Fig. 16a) due to the heavy Pb and I atoms. Both thin-film photovoltaic cells (p–i–n photodiodes) and externally biased thick-film photoconductors were fabricated via a solution process (Fig. 16b and d, respectively), which exhibited high X-ray sensitivity of up to 25 μC mGyair−1 cm−3 and R of 1.9 × 104 carriers per photon. The photocurrent densities in the thick-film (60 μm) photoconductors were about 100-fold higher than that in the p–i–n photodiodes under X-ray illumination, which was achieved by matching the layer thickness and partly caused by the moderate photoconducting gain. The performance of the X-ray detectors based on the low-temperature solution-processed MAPbI3 material from molecular precursors is commensurate with that based on conventional solid-state semiconductor materials, suggesting great promise for facile integration into inexpensive industrial readout electronics for imaging, which are applicable for scientific purposes and medical diagnostics. Huang and co-workers reported the fabrication of a sensitive X-ray detector using MAPbBr3 single crystals (Fig. 16l).225 The perovskite single crystals with a record-high mobility-lifetime (μτ) product of 1.2 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 and extremely small surface charge recombination velocity of 64 cm s−1 were realized by reducing the bulk defects and passivating surface traps. The detectors with a 2–3 mm thick MAPbBr3 single crystal exhibited a detection efficiency of 16.4% under irradiation with continuum X-ray energy up to 50 keV at near zero bias. The X-ray detectors also exhibited the lowest detectable X-ray dose rate of 0.5 μGyair s−1 together with sensitivity of 80 μC Gyair−1 cm−2, which is four times higher than that achieved with α-Se X-ray detectors, allowing a reduction in the radiation dose applied to the human body for many medical and security check applications. Furthermore, Huang et al. reported a simple technique to monolithically integrate MAPbBr3 single crystals onto Si substrates so that the electric signal could be directly read out from Si.226 An NH3Br-terminated molecule layer was used to mechanically and electrically connect the MAPbBr3 single crystals with the Si substrates without any requirement of lattice matching with the Si substrates. The Si-integrated MAPbBr3 single crystal detectors exhibited a sensitivity of 2.1 × 104 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 under 8 keV X-ray radiation, which is over 1000 times higher than that of α-Se X-ray detectors. Thus, the X-ray dose to patients using the developed X-ray imaging system with both perovskite pixel detectors and linear array detectors can be dramatically reduced by 15–120-fold compared with that of state-of-the-art X-ray imaging systems. Therefore, the monolithic integration of new optoelectronic materials with well-established inexpensive silicon circuitry is leading to new applications, functionality and simple readouts.

Recently, Tang and co-workers reported lateral-structured X-ray detectors with solution-processed lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystal using one Ag+ and one Bi3+ to substitute two toxic Pb2+ in CsPbBr3.227 The high average atomic number, adequate μτ product, low ionization energy and high resistivity of Cs2AgBiBr6 render it a suitable semiconductor to directly convert X-rays into electrical signals. Thermal annealing and surface treatment have been demonstrated to be effective in improving carrier transport and decreasing the surface trap density. In addition, the suppressed field-driven ionic migration in Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystals permits a relatively large external bias, guaranteeing efficient charge collection and consequently an improved signal current without a simultaneous super-linear increase in dark current. The optimized X-ray detectors exhibited a high sensitivity of 105 μC Gyair−1 cm−2 and low detection limit of 59.7 nGyair s−1 under an external bias of 5 V, and displayed long term operational stability.


5.2.2 Improved photodetector performance. 
The performance of PPDs with the vertical structure can be improved by utilizing a perovskite/organic heterojunction229 and organic interfacial layer.44,45,230,231 In 2014, Yang and co-workers firstly demonstrated hybrid photodetectors with the vertical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3–xCIx/PC61BM/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN)/Al (Fig. 17a).230 The water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymer PFN interfacial layer acts as a dipole layer, offering an additional electric field to prevent hole injection, while enhancing electron injection. The hybrid photodetectors exhibited a peak EQE of 80%, high D* approaching 1014 Jones, LDR of over 100 dB and a fast photo-response with a −3 dB bandwidth up to 3 MHz, which are comparable to or even better than that of photodetectors with traditional inorganic semiconductor. The high performance was attributed to the excellent intrinsic optical and electronic properties of the perovskite materials and the judicious interface design. Burn and Lin et al. demonstrated hybrid photodetectors with a double fullerene PC61BM/C60 layer (Fig. 17d), exhibiting performance metrics equivalent to commercial inorganic photodetectors.45 The relatively thick fullerene (n-type semiconductor) electron transporting interlayers were used to manipulate the spectral response, improve the temporal response and suppresses the dark current by limiting the back injection of holes. These features were achieved without compromising the LDR since the electron mobility of fullerene is sufficient to prevent the formation of space charge in the junction up to light intensities of 0.4 W cm−2, exhibiting the large measurement-limited LDR of ≈170 dB at −0.5 V. Furthermore, Huang et al. reported hybrid photodetectors with crosslinked N4,N4′-bis(4-(6-((3-ethyloxetan-3-yl)methoxy)hexyl)phenyl)-N4,N4′-diphenylbiphenyl-4,4′-diamine (OTPD) as the hole transporting layer (HTL) and PC61BM/C60 as the electron transporting layer (ETL) (Fig. 17g), with low noise of 16 fA Hz−1/2 at −0.1 V, which is close to the shot and thermal noise limits.44 The hybrid photodetectors exhibited a high average EQE approaching 90%, short response time of 120 ns and large LDR of 94 dB. The interfacial ETL and HTL engineering of the photodetectors, especially the trap passivation effect of the fullerene layer, enabled the direct measurement of light irradiance down to sub 1 pW cm−2, which matches well with the calculated NEP. The excellent weak light sensing capability of the hybrid photodetectors makes them potential candidates to replace commercial Si photodiodes in practical applications. In addition, a mixed interlayer obtained by blending PMMA in PC61BM was used as an effective hole-blocking layer by Chen et al. for high performance hybrid photodetectors.231 Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy imaging revealed that the work function of the PC61BM:PMMA interlayer was reduced by the introduction of PMMA, which resulted in an increase in the hole injection barrier and better hole-blocking property. The optimized hybrid photodetectors with the PC61BM:PMMA mixture interlayer exhibited significant and simultaneous improvements in D*, LDR and transient response time, which reached 1.1 × 1013 Jones, 112 dB, and 2.2 μs, respectively.

Recently, Yan et al. demonstrated low-voltage high-gain phototransistors based on perovskite/organic–semiconductor vertical heterojunctions (Fig. 18a), which were fabricated via a solution process.148 The phototransistors with double layers of MAPbI3−xClx and PEDOT:PSS formed staggered heterojunctions, exhibiting an ultrahigh R of ≈2 × 109 A W−1, gain of 4.0 × 109 and D* of ≈1.7 × 1014 Jones under Vis light at a low operating bias of only 0.5 V. Although the MAPbI3−xClx material shows weak light absorption above the absorption edge of ≈800 nm, the phototransistors still exhibited high responsivities of close to 109 A W−1 under NIR light at wavelengths of up to 1100 nm due to their extremely high gain. The high sensitivity was attributed to the pronounced photo-gating effect induced by the high density of photo-generated electrons accumulated at the vertical heterojunction, which resulted from the perovskite materials with a strong light absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime and high dielectric constant. The photo-gating effect on the channel obeys the following processes. Strong light absorption in the perovskite leads to the creation of excitons or electron–hole pairs. Holes tend to diffuse into the PEDOT:PSS layer because it is energetically favorable for them to do so, leaving electrons trapped in the perovskite layer. The holes will transfer and recirculate many times in the PEDOT:PSS channel throughout their long lifetimes, giving rise to an ultrahigh gain. Moreover, high-performance photodetectors that exhibit excellent flexibility and bending durability can be assembled on flexible plastic substrates.

Photodetectors with the structure of graphene field effect transistors (GFET) sensitized by a layer of semiconductor (GFET/sensitizer) have been investigated extensively for ultrasensitive photo-detection. Chan and Wu et al. demonstrated GFET/sensitizer photodetectors with an enhanced R by utilizing perovskite/organic-BHJ as the sensitized layer (Fig. 18c).232 Optical spectroscopy and ultrafast time-resolved measurements exhibited that the photodetector with graphene/MAPbI3:PC61BM BHJ had improved electron–hole separation efficiency and carrier lifetime compared to the reference photodetector with the MAPbI3 sensitizer only. The key to these enhancement was the presence of PC61BM, which acted as charge separation and electron trapping sites, resulting in a 30-fold increase in photo-responsivity. However, a setback for the high photo-responsivity is the slow response time due to the increase in the carrier trapping time. Thus, the use of a small amount of electron or hole acceptors in the sensitizer layer will be an effective strategy for improving and tuning the photo-responsivity of GFET/sensitizer photodetectors for extreme low-light detection.
Inhibiting the migration of charged defect ions in perovskite films is the key factor for acquiring and retaining high device performance.212 The zero drift induced by ion (vacancy) migration can severely deteriorate the stability of the on/off ratio, detectivity, and R of PPDs. Jia and co-workers demonstrated the inhibition of zero drift in PPDs via PC61BM doping.233 Two types of photodetectors were fabricated, including Au/MAPbIxCl3−x/Au and Au/MAPbIxCl3−x:PC61BM/Au. Under 10 mW cm−2 illumination, there was no zero drift for both photodetectors. However, the PC61BM-doped photodetectors with reduced conductivity resulted in weaker properties. In dark conditions, the I–V curve of the photodetector with pure perovskite exhibited zero drift of ∼0.2 V, while that with MAPbIxCl3−x:PC61BM could suppress the zero drift. The dopant PC61BM can hinder the ion (vacancy) migration of perovskite materials to suppress the phenomenon of zero drift in PPDs. Also, stable characteristics can be achieved by the hindering effect of PC61BM.
Photodetectors with excellent stability are beneficial for practical applications in various fields. The stability of PPDs can be improved by capping with a protection layer of organic materials.43,46,145,201 Yang et al. demonstrated lateral PPDs with a perovskite/organic heterojunction between the MAPbI3 perovskite and high-mobility, stable organic semiconductor dioctylbenzothieno[2,3-b]benzothiophene (C8BTBT), which exhibited a broad spectral response from the UV to NIR region.234 The PPDs with MAPbI3/C8BTBT heterojunction exhibited an excellent on/off ratio as high as 2.4 × 104 and high R up to 24.8 A W−1. More importantly, the PPDs with MAPbI3/C8BTBT heterojunction could maintain about 90% performance after exposure to ambient conditions for 20 days due to the waterproof property of C8BTBT layer. Their high performance mainly resulted from the introduction of a C8BTBT layer, where the C8BTBT layer acts as an efficient hole-extraction layer to allow holes to quickly transport to the electrodes due to its perfect filling of the gaps between perovskite grains and its intrinsic high mobility and the energy-level match with MAPbI3. Also, the stable C8BTBT layer acted as a waterproof layer to prevent the degradation of MAPbI3. It is believed that high performance and stable photodetectors can be realized by using the perovskite/organic heterojunction strategy.


5.2.3 Extending spectral response range. 
The integration of perovskite materials with organic materials not only improves the performance of photodetectors, but also extends the spectral response range of devices.
Shi and co-workers reported flexible UV-Vis-NIR hybrid photodetectors with a bilayer composite film of MAPbI3 perovskite and a commercially available narrow-bandgap-conjugated polymer (poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole-terthiophene), PDPP3T) as a photosensitizer, which demonstrated a broad spectral response range from 300 to 937 nm.235 Operating at a low bias, the hybrid photodetectors with the MAPbI3/PDPP3T bilayer composite exhibited not only a sensitive photo-response in the NIR region, but also significantly improved R and D* in the UV-Vis region compared with that of the photodetector with pure MAPbI3 (Fig. 19a–c). The hybrid photodetectors also exhibited decent photo-response-irradiance power dependence, high capability of detecting weak light, repeatable and rapid photo-switching characteristics, and improved environmental stability. Their work inspired the development of different perovskite–organic composite systems for cheap and high-performance flexible broadband photodetectors. Furthermore, Ma et al. demonstrated broadband perovskite–organic hybrid photodetectors with a vertical structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3/PDPP3T:PC71BM/Al, integrating the advantages of the high EQE of perovskites and wide spectrum response of polymers.236 The hybrid photodetectors with MAPbI3/PDPP3T:PC71BM exhibited a broad spectral response range from 400 to 950 nm, with an EQE of ≈70% over the 500–700 nm region. Furthermore, the dark current density of the hybrid photodetectors was more efficiently suppressed compared to the photodetectors with polymer, which enhanced the D* and LDR of the hybrid photodetectors, reaching the values of 1013 Jones and 110 dB, respectively.

Shen and co-workers also integrated perovskite photoactive layers with low-bandgap organic BHJ layers to produce hybrid photodetectors, which combined the advantages of the two types of PPDs and OPDs.237 Poly(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-3,6-di(5-thiophen-2-yl)yl-alt-N-(2-ethylhexyl)-dithieno-[3,2-b:2,3-d]pyrrole-2,6-diyl) (PDPPTDTPT) was fabricated, which has a low optical bandgap of 1.23 eV. The hybrid photodetectors with the integration of MAPbI3 and organic PDPPTDTPT:PC61BM BHJ layer extended the response spectrum up to the wavelength of 1000 nm (Fig. 19f) without deteriorating the R and D* of either type of photodetector. For NIR light detection, the MAPbI3 layer with high charge carrier mobility acted as the HTL, which enlarged the spacing of the two electrodes, decreased the device capacitance and reduced the device response time. A fast response time of 5 ns was measured for incident IR light from the device with an active area of 0.1 mm2, which represents the state-of-the-art performance for organic-based photodetectors. Recently, Gong and co-workers demonstrated room-temperature-operated ultrasensitive solution-processed broadband photodetectors via the incorporation of perovskite with conjugated polymer and single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) (Fig. 19g).238 The novel n-type low bandgap conjugated polymer, poly[(N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-2,6-diyl) (2,5-dioctyl-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-5,5′-diyl)] (NDI-DPP), with strong light absorption in the NIR region was developed and then employed to extend the spectral response range of the hybrid photodetectors. Through the formation of type-II band alignment between NDI-DPP with SWCNTs, the NIR absorption of NDI-DPP was exploited, which contributed to the NIR photo-response for the hybrid photodetectors with MAPbI3:SWCNTs/NDI-DPP:PC61BM. In addition, the active layer of SWCNTs incorporated with MAPbI3 offered percolation pathways for high charge-carrier mobility, which tremendously boosted the charge transfer in the photoactive layer and consequently improved the photocurrent in the Vis region. As a result, the hybrid photodetectors with MAPbI3:SWCNTs/NDI-DPP:PC61BM exhibited the peak EQE of 80% and 20% and the D* of over 6 × 1012 Jones and 2 × 1012 Jones in the Vis and NIR regions, respectively.
Additionally, Xie et al. reported flexible lateral hybrid photodetectors with the BHJ of perovskite MAPbI3 and the organic dye rhodamine B (RhB), which were fabricated via a solution casting process.239 The organic dye RhB with its ionic nature exhibited excellent mixing compatibility with the hybrid perovskites and modified the absorption spectra of the perovskite active layer. Since it is a dye sensitive to special wavelength illumination, RhB played an important role in donating and transferring electrons, which also effectively reduced the recombination of electrons and holes. The hybrid photodetectors with MAPbI3:RhB BHJ exhibited excellent photoelectrical properties and satisfactory stability and flexibility, which offer the possibility of dye-sensitized perovskite bulk hetero-structures in photodetector applications. Furthermore, Lin et al. demonstrated broadband hybrid photodetectors with organic dye-perovskite composite films.240 The organic dye 2-[2-[2-chloro-3-[2-(1,3-dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-1-ethyl-2H-benz[e]indol-2-ylidene)-ethyli-dene]-1-cylohexen-1-yl]-ethenyl]-3,3-dimethyl-1-ethyl-1H-benz[e]indolium hexafluoro-phosphate (CyPF6) and dye 1-butyl-2-(2-[3-[2-(1-butyl-1H-benzo[cd]indol-2-ylidene)-ethyli-dene]-2-diphenylaminocyclopent-1-enyl]-vinyl)-benzo[cd]indolium tetrafluoroborate (Cy1BF4) were respectively mixed with hybrid perovskite materials as complementary photoabsorbers and exhibited good compatibility with the hybrid perovskite FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 during thin film formation. Tuning the ionic dye loading allowed for optimization of the spectral response characteristics and excellent charge carrier mobilities around 11 cm2 V−1 s−1, suggesting that these composites combine the light-absorbing properties of IR dyes with the outstanding charge-extraction characteristics of perovskite. The optimal deep NIR hybrid photodetectors with FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3:CyPF6 composites and optimal SWIR hybrid photodetectors with FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3:Cy1BF4 composites exhibited a broad spectral response range of 450–1100 nm and 450–1800 nm, respectively. Also, both the hybrid photodetectors exhibited a low dark current and fast response speed at room temperature.
In conclusion, the integration of perovskite materials and organic materials, combining the best of both components, is an effective strategy for realizing high-performance broadband photodetectors, especially for NIR and X-ray detection.

5.3 Flexible and transparent photodetectors
Compared with the traditional devices based on rigid silicon substrates, flexible photodetectors have wider applications in the field of wearable and portable devices owing to their reduced cost and weight. Combined with their transparent features, flexible devices have been widely applied in various fields, including touch screens and interactive electronics.90–92,242–245 The common flexible substrates used for the fabrication of flexible photodetectors include polyethylene terephthalate (PET),159,193,194,235,246,247 polyethylene naphthalate (PEN),239,248 polyimide (PI),249 carbon cloth250 and mica.90,152 A summary of the performance parameters for flexible photodetectors with various morphology perovskite materials grown on different flexible substrates is exhibited in Table 4.

Xie and co-workers demonstrated the first flexible PPDs with MAPbI3 films deposited on the flexible PET/ITO substrate via a solution-processed and self-assembly strategy.246 The PPDs were sensitive to broadband spectrum from the UV to the entire Vis light region, showing a high EQE value of 1.19 × 103% and R of 3.49 A W−1 under 365 nm light illumination at a bias of 3 V. Additionally, the PPDs exhibited excellent flexibility and robustness with no obvious variation in photocurrent after bending for 120 cycles. Pan et al. demonstrated flexible PPDs with uniform and pinhole-free MAPbI3 thin films deposited on interdigitated ITO electrodes with flexible PET substrates via the vapor-solution method (Fig. 20a).247 The flexible PPDs with PET/ITO substrate exhibited a high R of 81 A W−1 at a low bias of 1 V. Furthermore, the high performance of the flexible PPDs was maintained under the radii of curvature varying from 10 to 3 mm and after repetitive bending of 200 cycles, exhibiting excellent flexural stability and durability under various bending situations.

Shi and co-workers reported flexible UV-Vis-NIR hybrid photodetectors with an MAPbI3/PDPP3T bilayer composite film grown on interdigitated Au electrodes with flexible PET substrates (Fig. 20b).235 The flexibility of the hybrid photodetectors with the MAPbI3/PDPP3T composite was investigated by bending to different curvature radii and repeated bending/straitening tests, and the results are shown in Fig. 20c–f. The R of the hybrid photodetectors exhibited a small decrease under illumination with Vis light at 650 nm or NIR light at 835 nm when the hybrid photodetectors were bent to radii of 12, 9, 7, or 4 mm. Even at the smallest curvature radius of 4 mm, the R of the hybrid photodetectors at 650 or 835 nm exhibited a high retention of 86% or 83%, respectively. The decreased R could be ascribed to the reduction of the light-receiving area at the bending state. The retention of R at 650 and 835 nm was tested to be 90% and 85% after 1000 cycles of bending/straitening to a curvature radius of 7 mm. These results indicate that the hybrid photodetectors with the MAPbI3/PDPP3T composite have excellent mechanical flexibility and durability. Similarly, Xie et al. exhibited flexible broadband hybrid photodetectors with BHJ of MAPbI3:RhB deposited on interdigitated Au electrodes with flexible PEN substrates.239 The flexibility of the hybrid photodetectors with MAPbI3:RhB was investigated by bending to a radius of 9 mm and repeated bending tests. To reduce the abrasion of the MAPbI3 thin films during the bending process, the flexible hybrid photodetectors were protected by a PMMA layer. Although the hybrid photodetectors with MAPbI3:RhB were bent to a radius of 9 mm initially, their responsivity exhibited a slight decrease upon Vis light illumination. Simultaneously, the PMMA protective layer eliminated the contact of the hybrid photodetectors with the surrounding moisture and oxygen, which improved their stability in humid air.
Bao and co-workers demonstrated self-powered flexible vertical PPDs with patterned Au nanowire (AuNW) networks as transparent electrodes (TEs) deposited on a PEN substrate (Fig. 21a).248 The patterned AuNW network TEs were fabricated via an in situ etching method (Fig. 21b), exhibiting high conductivity and desirable flexibility (Fig. 21c). Additionally, the AuNW networks on flexible PEN substrate exhibited a low surface roughness with the Rq of ≈20.3 nm, which was further reduced to be ≈7.8 nm after the deposition of PEDOT:PSS. Moreover, the high chemical stability of AuNW to MAPbI3 perovskite materials was also demonstrated. The flexible MAPbI3-based PPDs with AuNW network TEs showed a peak EQE and R of 60% and 321 mA W−1, respectively, which are comparable to that of MAPbI3-based PPDs with ITO TEs (Fig. 21d). Besides, the flexible PPDs with the PEN/AuNW substrate exhibited superior flexibility compared with the flexible PPDs with PET/ITO substrate. As shown in Fig. 21e, around 90% and 60% of the initial photocurrent were retained for the flexible PPDs with PEN/AuNW substrate when bent to radii of 2.5 and 1.5 mm, respectively. These results indicate that TEs with high conductivity, stability and flexibility are necessary to realize the high-performance and excellent flexibility in flexible PPDs.

A perovskite with varying morphology was developed and employed in flexible PPDs with PET substrate, exhibiting excellent flexibility and stability.193,194 The direct path to convert thin film to nanowires can build a bridge between them, and therefore facilitate the large-scale applications of nanowires. Zhu et al. demonstrated that MAPbI3 nanowires could be synthesized directly from perovskite films through a simple and scalable conversion process (Fig. 22a).251 MAPbI3 nanowires with different morphologies and diameter distributions were obtained by fine kinetic control, showing excellent optical trapping and mechanical properties. The flexible PPDs with the MAPbI3 nanowires exhibited excellent flexibility and good sensitivity. Zhang and Jie et al. reported ultra-stable aligned single-crystalline MAPbI3 microwire (MW) arrays fabricated via a one-step blade-coating method (Fig. 22b), which is simple and compatible with large-area processing and scalable for high-throughput industrial-scale fabrication.252 During the blade coating process, the strong intermolecular interaction between the MAPbI3 molecules induced the formation of 1D MAPbI3 MWs, while the directional motion of the blade governed the alignment orientation of the MW arrays. The PPDs based on the MAPbI3 MW arrays simultaneously exhibited a high R of 13.5 A W−1 under Vis light a small detectable light intensity of 1 μW cm−2 and long-term stability of >50 days in air. Their high-performance and long-term stability were attributed to the high-quality crystal structures with fewer grain boundaries and lower defect/trap density in the MWs. More impressively, the solution coating method was applicable to processing MAPbI3 MW arrays on flexible substrates, enabling the fabrication of flexible PPDs with excellent flexibility and bending durability. The flexible photosensor circuitry composed of the PPDs with MAPbI3 MW arrays integrated on a PET substrate exhibited high performance for high-resolution and flexible image sensors, exhibiting excellent image-sensing functionality (Fig. 22c and d). The present simple fabrication method for stable aligned perovskite MW arrays opens up an exciting opportunity for low-cost, large-scale and high-efficiency flexible optoelectronic device applications.

Zeng et al. demonstrated the fabrication of atomically thin 2D CsPbBr3 nanosheets and their application in solution-processed flexible PPDs with high performance.253 These high-quality and easily dispersed perovskite nanosheets with a thickness of ≈3.3 nm and an edge length of ≈1 μm were synthesized via a simple solution-phase method. The as-prepared perovskite nanosheets could be well dispersed in various solvents for fabricating solution-processed optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, their unique 2D features make these CsPbBr3 nanosheets suitable to be assembled into large-area, crack-free, high-quality films for flexible and ultrathin optoelectronic devices through simple solution-processes, such as ink-printing and roll-to-roll processing. The flexible Vis-light PPDs with 2D CsPbBr3 exhibited excellent electronic-transport properties, high sensitivity with light on/off ratio of >103, high stability with a fluctuation of less than 2.6% after irradiation under 10 mW cm−2 442 nm laser light for 12 h, and outstanding flexibility (>10000 cycles) (Fig. 23b and c). These high-performance and flexible PPDs demonstrate that all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite nanosheets, as a new class of 2D solution-processed semiconductor candidates, have huge potential for ultrathin and flexible solution-based optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, the responsivity of the flexible PPDs with CsPbBr3 nanosheets greatly improved by constructing fast carrier tracks within the CsPbBr3 nanosheet films using carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as shown in Fig. 23d.254 The CsPbBr3 nanosheets:CNTs composite films exhibited both high light harvesting and high conductivity, and these advantages were demonstrated by the high performances of the lateral hybrid photodetectors, which exhibited high EQE and R of up to 7488% and 31.1 A W−1 (Fig. 23g and h), respectively. Besides, the efficient charge extraction and transport also remarkably contributed to the fast response speed, where a rise time of 16 μs was achieved. The composite films exhibited impressive flexibility owing to the ultrathin 2D and 1D structural characteristics of the CsPbBr3 nanosheet and CNT, respectively, leading to excellent flexibility and photostability in the hybrid photodetectors with CsPbBr3 nanosheets:CNTs composite films (Fig. 23i). Furthermore, by deploying the hybrid photodetectors as a point-like detector, clear images were acquired. These results indicate the promising potential of perovskite:CNT composites for solution- and ambient condition-processed flexible devices, and this strategy is universal for realizing high-performance communication devices, imaging devices, photodetectors and LEDs with perovskites. In addition, the strategy of constructing inorganic/perovskite heterojunctions can also be employed to improve the performance of flexible PPDs. You and Zhang et al. demonstrated high-performance flexible all-inorganic PPDs with the ZnO/CsPbBr3 hetero-structure.255 Owing to the interfacial charge transfer from CsPbBr3 to ZnO, the recombination of photo-excited electron–hole pairs in CsPbBr3 was limited and the photocurrent of the PPDs was enhanced by more than one order of magnitude after the introduction of a ZnO layer. The PPDs with the ZnO/CsPbBr3 hetero-structure exhibited high sensitivity with an on/off ratio of >104 under 450 nm light illumination and a high R of 4.25 A W−1. Furthermore, the low-temperature processing approach offered a wider selection of potential substrates, where the flexible PPDs with ZnO/CsPbBr3 fabricated on flexible PET substrate exhibit excellent stability and outstanding flexibility, with a change in photocurrent of less than 1.5% after 10000 bending cycles.

In addition to flexible PET and PEN substrates, some other flexible substrates have been used to construct flexible photodetectors with high-performance and excellent flexibility, such as PI, carbon cloth, and mica. Wang and Zhong et al. reported flexible PPDs with a TiO2 nanocrystal/MAPbI3 bilayer deposited on a flexible PI substrate.249 In the structure of the TiO2 nanocrystal (NC)/MAPbI3 bilayer, MAPbI3 is responsible for light absorption and the TiO2 NC film is responsible for receiving (from MAPbI3) and transporting photoelectrons. The PPDs with a TiO2 NC/MAPbI3 bilayer exhibited a satisfactory overall performance with an on/off ratio of 4000, D* of 1.85 × 1012 Jones and tr/tf of 0.49/0.56 s. The flexible PPDs fabricated on a flexible PI substrate showed a comparable performance to that of the PPDs fabricated on a glass substrate, signaling their great potential applications in future flexible optoelectronics. Li and Xiong et al. exhibited flexible PPDs with the vertical structure of carbon cloth/TiO2/MAPbI3:Spiro-OMeTAD/Au,250 in which the blended film of MAPbI3 and Spiro-OMeTAD acted as the active layer for light detection and carbon cloth served as both a flexible substrate and a conductive electrode. The fabrication process for the flexible PPDs constructed on cost-efficient carbon cloth is shown in Fig. 24. The PPDs with MAPbI3:Spiro-OMeTAD exhibited a broad spectral response from the UV (300 nm) to NIR (820 nm) region, high R, fast response speed and long-term stability. The flexible PPDs showed negligible degradation after several tens of bending cycles and at the extreme bending angle of 180°. Moreover, the flexible PPDs could work at a very low bias of 0.6 V and even functioned well at zero bias. Their work presents a promising new technique for the construction of flexible, high-performance broadband PPDs with cost efficiency and self-powering capability.

Zhai et al. demonstrated flexible and transparent photodetectors with a TiO2 nanotube (NTs)/MAPbI3 QD hetero-structure fabricated on mica substrate, which exhibited a broadband spectral response range of 300–850 nm and improved optoelectronic characteristics compared with TiO2 NTs photodetectors.90 The TiO2 NT/MAPbI3 QD hetero-structures were fabricated by spin-coating MAPbI3 QDs on the surface of co-electrospun TiO2 NTs array (Fig. 25). The photoelectric performance of the hybrid photodetectors with TiO2 NT/MAPbI3 QD hetero-structures was well maintained when exposed to moist air for 72 h or heated from room temperature to 100 °C. In addition, the hybrid photodetectors with TiO2 NTs/MAPbI3 QDs exhibited high transparency (≈85%) in the range of 400–800 nm and excellent flexible photo-detecting property, and their photo-detecting performance was well retained after 200 continuous cycles of bending at various angles. Due to the advantages of electrospinning, the TiO2 NTs were facilely fabricated at a low cost and combined with the merits of MAPbI3 QDs, these hetero-structure photodetectors may open a new avenue for prospective wide range response and flexible device construction. Zhai and co-workers also demonstrated excellent flexible and broadband hybrid photodetectors with inorganic-perovskite hybrid structures constructed on flexible mica substrate via a convenient solution-process.152 The hybrid photodetectors with ZnO NW/MAPbI3 hybrid structures exhibited distinguished photoelectric performance (R = 4 A W−1 and EQE = 1300% under 380 nm light illumination) and an available broadband region up to 760 nm. Moreover, these hybrid photodetectors exhibited good flexibility, demonstrating excellent mechanical stability even after 200 cycles of extreme bending treatment. Thus, it is anticipated that inorganic/perovskite hybrid semiconductor structures are promising light-harvesting materials for advanced flexible optical electronic transducers.

5.4 Self-powered perovskite photodetectors
Novel self-powered photodetectors that can work without an external power source have great application potential in next-generation optoelectronic devices that operate wirelessly and independently, and thus are being widely investigated.95 The self-powering feature can be achieved by utilizing the characteristics of certain materials, such as Schottky junction and p–n (or p–p) junction. To present a clear comparison, a summary of the performance parameters of various self-powered photodetectors is presented in Table 5.

Wang et al. demonstrated ultrafast self-powered UV photodetectors with a ZnO NW/perovskite hetero-structure (Fig. 26a).256 The pyroelectric effect, which is induced in wurtzite ZnO nanowires upon UV illumination, was utilized as an effective approach to modulate the optoelectronic processes, and thus enhance the performances of UV sensing. The response time of the self-powered photodetectors with the ZnO/perovskite hetero-structure improved from 5.4 s to 53 μs in the rising time, and 8.9 s to 63 μs in the falling time by five orders in magnitudes. The D* and the R of the self-powered photodetectors were both enhanced by 322%. These enhancements were attributed to the photovoltaic effect and light-induced pyroelectric effect, respectively (Fig. 26c and e). Thus, their work provides a novel design approach to achieve ultrafast response UV photodetectors operating under zero bias at room temperature enhanced by the light-induced pyroelectric effect. This newly designed ultrafast self-powered UV photodetector may become a prospective candidate for ultrafast and energy-efficient UV sensing, and meanwhile lead to further exploration in different research and commercial fields. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the pyro-phototronic effect on the photo-sensing performance of self-powered UV photodetectors with the ZnO/perovskite hetero-structure was investigated by Wang et al. under various UV light intensities with the system temperature ranging from 77 to 300 K.257 The current responses of these photodetectors upon UV illumination were enhanced by 174.1% at 77 K and 28.7% at 300 K owing to the improved pyro-phototronic effect at low temperatures. According to the exponential fittings of the current responses of the photodetectors upon UV illumination, the charges transferred through the external circuit driven by the pyroelectric polarizations at various temperatures were calculated and analyzed to provide insight into the working mechanism of the pyro-phototronic effect. In addition, the pyro-phototronic effect-related enhancements at both low temperature (77 K) and room temperature (300 K) could be effectively reduced by increasing the bias applied to the photodetectors. Their work presents in-depth understanding about the temperature dependence and fundamental operating mechanism of the pyro-phototronic effect in ZnO/perovskite hetero-structures and provides guidance for the design and development of corresponding optoelectronics for application in ultrafast optics, nonlinear optics, optothermal detection, computational memory and biocompatible optoelectronic probes.

Zhu and co-workers reported self-powered MAPbI3-based PPDs with a dual sensing mechanism, relying on the combined photoelectric effect and triboelectric effect properties of the perovskite material.258 The self-powered PPDs were composed of two separate parts (Fig. 27a), both of which were 2 cm × 2 cm in lateral dimensions. The bottom part was constructed on a transparent FTO substrate. A compact TiO2 HBL, ETL of mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, and light-absorption layer of MAPbI3 were fabricated sequentially on the FTO substrate. The upper part was a copper layer deposited on an elastic buffer layer, which could enhance the effective contact area between the copper layer and the MAPbI3 layer. The self-powered PPDs exhibited a broad detection range from the UV to Vis region, with an excellent R of 7.5 V W−1, response time of <80 ms and great repeatability. Based on the conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) and scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) measurements, the novel dual sensing physical mechanism was interpreted as the significant alteration of the photoconductivity and the surface triboelectric charge density of the MAPbI3-based composite thin film upon solar illumination (Fig. 27b and c), which results in a considerable reduction in the output voltage. Their work presents a new route to for the design of high-performance, self-powered photodetectors utilizing specific characteristics of certain materials.

Jin and Ge et al. demonstrated self-driven Vis-blind UV photodetectors based on single crystals of the perovskite oxide BaTiO3 (BTO) by utilizing the ferroelectric properties of BTO.259 The cutoff wavelength of the transmission spectra of the BTO single crystals is approximately 392 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of about 3.2 eV, which resulted in the UV photodetectors with BTO operating in the absence of filters to block Vis light. BTO, as an ideal photovoltaic material, exhibits a high Curie temperature, excellent chemical stability and thermal stability. The photoelectric performance of the self-powered photodetectors with unpolarized BTO, negative polarized BTO and positive polarized BTO was systematically investigated. With the modulation of polarization direction, stable photocurrents in different directions were found in the absence of external electric fields due to the ferroelectric polarization in BTO, which became larger as the intensity of the incident light increased. The sign of the photocurrent could be reversed by flipping the ferroelectric polarization, which makes this photodetector suitable for electrical manipulation. Particularly, the self-driven photodetectors based on BTO exhibited an ultrafast response time of ≈200 ps, indicating the feasibility and unique potential of ferroelectric perovskite oxides for UV detection applications.
The conventional design of photodetectors usually incorporates a semiconductor with two Ohmic metal contacts. An external bias is required to separate the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. If one of the two Ohmic contact ends is replaced by a Schottky barrier contact, nonsymmetrical Schottky contact photodetectors can be obtained. Unlike photodetectors with an Ohmic contact, Schottky junction photodetectors rely on the presence of a built-in potential in the junction to achieve separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, which render them capable of detecting light illumination without an external bias. Self-powered photodetectors based on the Schottky junction have been generally realized via the construction of a semiconductor–metal Schottky junction and semiconductor–graphene Schottky junction.
Kumar and Yadav et al. reported self-powered Schottky junction PPDs with the vertical structure of ITO/MAPbI3/Au, yielding rectification behavior with a low reverse saturation current under dark conditions and a zero bias photocurrent when illuminated.260 The self-powered PPDs exhibited high photosensitivity with fast response and recovery times. The high photocurrent was attributed to the efficient charge transport properties in the MAPbl3 active layer with the photogenerated electrons injected into the ITO contact and the photogenerated holes injected into the gold contact, as confirmed by the analysis of the log-linear plot of its I–V characteristics. The in-depth detailed working mechanism of MAPbl3-based PPDs as a function of bias and light were demonstrated by using net terminal current–voltage characteristics and photodynamic measurements and band bending and alignment. Luo et al. demonstrated self-powered PPDs with the lateral structure of Au/FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3/Au, in which the Schottky junction is formed between the Au metal and perovskite semiconductor.150 The PPDs with FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 exhibited high sensitivity under a broad spectral range from 240 to 750 nm. Importantly, the PPDs were capable of detecting a 3 MHz optical signal at zero bias, with a fast response speed (tr/tf of 45/91 ns). In addition, the R and D* of the self-powered PPDs were estimated to be 5.7 A W−1 and 2.7 × 1013 Jones, respectively. Finally, these self-powered PPDs still exhibited good photosensitivity to white light illumination after storage under ambient conditions for 45 days.
Yan and co-workers demonstrated self-powered photodetectors with a Schottky junction between TiO2 and graphene, in which graphene acts as an electrode and perovskite acts as the active material (Fig. 28a).155 The Schottky junction can efficiently separate and transport the photogenerated excitons at the graphene/perovskite interface. Unlike the conventional photovoltaic structure, in this photodetector, both photogenerated electrons and holes are transported along the same direction to graphene, and the electrons tunneled into TiO2 are collected by the cathode and holes transported by graphene are collected by the anode (Fig. 28b); therefore, the photodetector is self-powered. The self-powered photodetectors exhibited an excellent on/off ratio of 4 × 106, high R of ≈0.375 A W−1 and D* of ≈1011 Jones, which are superior to that of most of the reported self-powered photodetectors under the same operating conditions. The high performance was attributed to the combination of graphene and perovskite, that is, the high mobility and conductivity of graphene combined with the strong and broadband light absorption of perovskite. Their work provides a new promising method for the development of self-powered photodetectors with high performance and low power consumption on a large scale.

In addition, a series of self-powered PPDs was realized by constructing a p–n heterojunction. Shen and co-workers demonstrated self-powered PPDs with the vertical structure of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/C60/BCP/Cu, with an ultrafast response time of ≈1 ns operating under zero bias.41 The high mobility of the MAPbI3 active layer and ultralow trap density as a result of charge-trap passivation enabled efficient, fast charge-carrier extraction. PPDs with a fast response and power-free operation provide an opportunity to measure the charge-carrier radiative recombination lifetime by monitoring photoluminescence decay, which is one typical application of ultrafast photodetectors. A time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) system was demonstrated with the ultrafast PPDs, in addition to a pulse laser, and an oscilloscope (Fig. 29b). The TRPL system can successfully resolve the PL lifetime of several typical fluorescent and phosphorescent materials with a radiative recombination lifetime in the range of several nanoseconds to microseconds, meeting the requirements for application in very-high-performance scientific equipment. In addition, these ultrafast PPDs will find applications in consumer electronics due to their optimal absorption spectrum for Vis imaging, fast response speed for quick frame rate imagers, and array formation by established printing technologies.

The nitrogen nanosecond laser acts as an excitation source, which illuminates the sample from a small angle. The sample is located at the focus position of Lens 1 and the photoluminescence from the sample is collected and redirected to a PPD by Lens 2. A filter was added to filter the laser scattering emission. A 1 GHz oscilloscope with 50 Ω input resistance was used to connect the PPDs to record the transient photocurrent curves.

Unlike the reported one-component single crystal PPDs, Wei et al. demonstrated PPDs with a core–shell heterojunction based on MAPbBr3 single crystals fabricated via a facile two-step approach, which exhibited the self-powering feature as a result of the built-in electric field in the junction.261 The formation of the core–shell heterojunction based on MAPbBr3/MAPbIxBr3−x was confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FESEM-EDS) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement. The PPDs with the MAPbBr3/MAPbIxBr3−x heterojunction exhibited typical photovoltaic behavior as well as wavelength-dependent responsivity with a peak R of up to 11.5 mA W−1 under 450 nm irradiation at zero bias and a maximum EQE of 3.17%, which were higher than that of the PPDs with MAPbBr3 single crystals. Thus, their work provides the new strategy of the construction of a heterojunction for realizing high performance self-powered photodetectors.
Self-powered p–n heterojunction photodetectors based on inorganic–perovskite composites, such as ZnO nanorods/MAPbI3,154 TiO2 nanorods/MaPbI3,157 MAPbI3/GaN262 and CsPbBr3:ZnO NPs,263 have also been fabricated and the main performance parameters of these self-powered photodetectors are shown in Table 5. ZnO and TiO2 with wide optical bandgaps can be employed as UV absorption materials for broadband self-powered photodetectors. The effect of the HTL (MoO3)154 and ETL (C60)262 on the performance of the self-powered photodetectors has been investigated in detail. The photodetectors with CsPbBr3:ZnO NPs use ITO and Ag as the asymmetric electrodes, which have work functions of −4.7 eV and −4.2 eV, respectively. Due to the different work functions, an internal electric field (i.e., built-in field) can be formed spontaneously in the photodetector channel, which acts as the driving force for the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers.263 Fang et al. demonstrated self-powered inorganic–organic hybrid photodetectors with a novel p–p heterojunction between a single trigonal Se (t-Se) microtube and conducting polymers.264 Three novel p–p heterojunctions were successfully fabricated by depositing poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), polyaniline (PANI), and polypyrrole (PPy) films on the surface of single t-Se microtubes (MT) via a one-step, facile and low-cost in situ polymerization process in acid solution. The individual t-Se microtube/conducting polymer p–p heterojunctions were used to fabricate photodetectors with indium as the electrode, which exhibited excellent self-powering characteristics and high-performances under UV-Vis light illumination. In particular, the self-powered hybrid photodetectors with t-Se/PANI exhibited a high on/off ratio of 1.1 × 103, high R of 120 mA W−1, large D* of 3.78 × 1011 Jones and fast response speed (τr of 4.5 μs and τf of 2.84 ms) under very low Vis light intensity illumination (0.434 mW cm−2, 610 nm) at zero bias. The high performance of the photodetectors with the t-Se/conducting polymers was attributed to the built-in electric field arising from the p–p heterojunctions at the interface, which is beneficial for the separation of electron–hole pairs and restraining the recombination in t-Se-MT for improving the photocurrent. Thus, self-powered photodetectors based on novel inorganic/organic p–p heterojunctions provide a promising route to realize advanced self-powered photodetectors with high-performance and simple device architecture via a low cost fabrication process.
5.5 Photodetector systems and arrays
Integrated optoelectronic devices have become one of the most popular research trends for a variety of functions and practical applications.96–98
Dong et al. demonstrated an organic–inorganic hybrid optocoupler with tandem organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) as the input light source and PPDs as the output component (as shown in Fig. 30a).265 The PPDs with the vertical structure of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au exhibited the advantages of low-voltage operation, fast response and broad absorption spectrum of 400–750 nm. The optocoupler device was fabricated by utilizing tandem OLEDs as the light source, which exhibited a high R (1.0 A W−1 at 341.3 μW cm−2) and fast response speed (rise time of 17 μs and fall time of 20 μs). The current transfer ratio (CTR), as the primary parameter to evaluate the efficiency of an optocoupler, is defined as the ratio of output current density to input current density. The CTR of 28.2% for the optocoupler increased to 263.3% after applying an amplification circuit (Fig. 30d). Thus, optocouplers with a high CTR can be obtained by combining a tandem input light source with PM-type photodetectors, which can be attributed to high EQE induced by photocurrent multiplication for PM-type photodetectors. Optocouplers combined with a tandem input light source and PM-type photodetectors will have wide potential applications due to the absence of an amplification circuit.

Self-powered systems have been successfully assembled, with the photodetector driven by PSCs266 or DVD-based triboelectric nanogenerator.267 Li et al. reported PPDs with MAPbI3 grown on a flexible PET/ITO substrate,266 which exhibited a broad spectral response range from UV to Vis light, high R and large on/off ratio. The stability and durability of the PPDs in air were enhanced up to two times by depositing an ultrathin Al2O3 film on the MAPbI3 surface as a protection layer via the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. Furthermore, an integrated, self-powered, all-perovskite system was realized for simultaneous energy conversion and light detection (Fig. 31a). The PSC, as an energy conversion unit in the system, provided a voltage of 0.93 V under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2), which drives the light sensing unit to achieve the detection of various lights. The integrated system could work effectively at a low voltage of less than 1.0 V and did not require an external power source, exhibiting a good photo-response and high reproducibility (Fig. 31b and c). Yan et al. presented self-powered PPDs with MAPbI3 single crystals driven by a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG).267 The lateral PPDs fabricated on the (100) facet of bulk MAPbI3 single crystals exhibited an R of 7.92 A W−1 under white light. The drum-shaped TENG was fabricated via the cost-effective approach of using two used digital versatile discs (DVDs), which could generate a high output of up to 200 V and 55 μA through periodic finger tapping on the TENG (Fig. 31d and f). Furthermore, an integrated self-powered system was constructed by configuring the DVD-based TENG to MAPbI3 single crystal-based PPDs, exhibiting a high R of 196 V (mW cm−2)−1 and wide detection range from 10 μW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 31h and i). These stable integrated systems, as low energy-consuming integrated modules, have promising applications in which photodetectors can work in harsh environments without external power sources, providing a new avenue for the development of portable and wearable devices aimed at reducing size and weight.

The wafer-scale growth of PPD arrays is an effective route to realize functional and integrated electronic and optoelectronic systems. Duan et al. reported the first successful patterned growth of regular arrays of perovskite microplate crystals for integrated device arrays, solving the urgent challenge of the incompatibility of perovskite crystals with the typical lithographic process.268 As shown in the schematic illustration of the patterned growth procedure (Fig. 32a), large arrays of PbI2 microplates can be grown from an aqueous solution through the seeded growth process, which can be further intercalated with MAI to produce MAPbI3 microplate crystals. The MAPbI3 microplate crystals show excellent crystalline quality and optical properties, which can be confirmed by structural and optical characterizations. Moreover, MAPbI3 microplate crystals can be selectively grown on pre-patterned electrode arrays to create independently addressable photodetector arrays and functional FETs. Large-scale (10 × 10) PPD arrays were fabricated on a transparent glass substrate and a U-shaped mask was placed on the back of the glass substrate (Fig. 32b). The spatially resolved map of the photocurrent amplitude generated by the PPD arrays clearly exhibits a U-shaped photo-response area (Fig. 32d), indicating that such arrays of two-terminal devices can function as effective photoimaging arrays. The ability to grow high quality perovskite microplates with controlled physical dimensions and to precisely place them at specific locations offer a powerful new material platform for the fundamental investigation of the electronic and optical properties of perovskite materials and can open pathway towards integrated electronic and optoelectronic systems.

The diamond-wire sawing process to slice large crystals into thin wafers was developed by Liu et al. for the fabrication of a 20 mm-large FAPbI3 single crystalline wafer (Fig. 33a).186 An array of 153 photodetectors on a piece of thin wafer was designed and fabricated (Fig. 7e), demonstrating the feasibility of the mass production of integrated circuits on perovskite wafers. The availability of large perovskite single crystalline wafers also makes it possible to fabricate photodetector systems and arrays. Song and Xiao et al. reported the fabrication of well-controllable and uniform circular MAPbBr3 microdisk arrays via a simple solution-based one-step anti-solvent method, which exhibited well-controlled lasing actions (Fig. 33b).269 The properties of the self-assembled MAPbBr3 microdisks were strongly related to the concentration of the perovskite precursor, the pattern sizes and hydrophilicity of the substrate. Thus, the cavity sizes and corresponding mode numbers of the self-assembled microdisk cavities could be precisely controlled by modifying the size of the SiO2 microdisks on the substrate or changing the concentration of the perovskite precursor. With this robust and generic method, the size distributions of the produced MAPbBr3 microdisk arrays were extremely uniform on the same wafer. The laser spectra from the different microdisks on the same wafer were very close and the standard deviation in lasing wavelengths was smaller than 0.1 nm, which is comparable to the results from microdisks fabricated with electron-beam lithography. Moreover, PPD arrays that could efficiently utilize the entire detecting area were also fabricated by periodically patterning the substrate, exhibiting rise times of <8.3 ms and fall times of <8.3 ms. Considering the high controllability and high reproducibility of the patterned MAPbBr3 microdisk arrays, this cost-effective and mass-manufacturable approach significantly increases the production yield of lead halide perovskite microdevice arrays and boosts their ability to be used in practical applications.

The majority of reported PPDs have been focused on individual devices, which limit their spatial imaging applications. Song et al. demonstrated flexible and semitransparent photodetector arrays with a perovskite network, which exhibited the potential for image mapping.91 Uniform MAPbI3 networks were synthesized on a PET substrate by controlling perovskite crystallization, which exhibited the unique advantages of uniformity, transparency, and flexibility compared with thin film and nanowires. The balance between the PPD performance and transparency was systematically investigated and the optimal PPD arrays with MAPbI3 networks were obtained using a 30 wt% precursor concentration. The PPD arrays were further applied in imaging and successfully used to obtain clear mapping of the spatial light source intensity distribution, thus exhibiting preliminary imaging function (Fig. 34b). The PPD arrays with MAPbI3 networks fabricated on PET substrates also exhibited superior flexibility, which could stand under a wide angle (20°–80°) and large number of bending cycles (≈10000 times). Furthermore, the stability of the PPDs with the sandwich structure of PET/MAPbI3/PMMA was greatly enhanced by sheathing with a hydrophobic organic material due to the improved interface contacts, surface passivation and moisture isolation, and the PPD arrays could be stored in air for one month with hardly any degradation. Considering their transparency, flexibility, imaging and stability, these PPD arrays are expected to be widely applied in visualization portable optoelectronic systems.

Kim and Li et al. reported the fabrication of inkjet-printed PPD arrays with perovskite MWs.270 The MAPbI3 nanowires, MWs, a network and islands, were fabricated via inkjet printing in ambient environment via the choice of the appropriate solvent for the preparation of the inks and controlling the crystal growth rate (Fig. 34c). PPDs with the lateral structure of electrode–gap–electrode were fabricated with using the different crystals (Fig. 34d), in which the PPDs based on MAPbI3 MWs exhibited a balance between uniformity and low defects. Thus, the PPDs with MAPbI3 MWs achieved a high switching ratio of 16000%, R of 1.2 A W−1 and D* of 2.39 × 1012 Jones at a light power density of 0.1 mW cm−2, which were much better than that of the PPDs fabricated via spin-coating under the same conditions. Moreover, PPD arrays with MAPbI3 MWs were further fabricated and applied in an imaging sensor, with which the clear mapping of the light source signal was successfully obtained (Fig. 34f). Their work demonstrates a novel route for the realization of low-cost, solution-processed and high-performance PPD arrays for potential practical applications.
Although photodetectors can well measure light intensity, the precise measurement of the light wavelength is difficult due to the wide spectral response of photodetectors. Traditionally, wavelength measurement is realized by using a spectrometer equipped with a diffraction grating. However, generally such a detection system is bulky and requires complicated and expensive optical systems. Jie et al. reported an integrated device consisting of LEDs and PPDs with perovskite nanowire arrays, exhibiting sequentially tunable spectral detection.271 The facile fluid-guided anti-solvent vapor-assisted crystallization (FGAVC) method was used to fabricate large-scale, high quality single-crystalline MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) nanowire arrays with continuously tunable absorption edges from 680 to 780 nm (Fig. 35a). By varying the content of x = 0–0.4, and thus the optical bandgap of the perovskite nanowires, the broadband spectral response of the lateral PPDs with MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 nanowire arrays could be sequentially tuned (Fig. 35b). Based on this feature, the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 nanowire array-based PPDs with tunable spectral response ranges (marked with PD1, PD2, PD3, PD4, and PD5, corresponding to x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, respectively) were then integrated with five red LEDs (L1–L5) to realize monolithic integration (Fig. 35c and d). This monolithic integration of PPDs and LEDs resulted in a unique system for direct wavelength detection, similar to conventional complex light wavelength measurement systems.

Currently, flexible photodetectors are attracting substantial attention due to their promising applications in bendable displays and smart clothes, which cannot be fulfilled by their existing rigid counterparts. Yan et al. demonstrated origami PPDs with spatial recognition ability.272 This newly designed type of flexible PPD with a lateral structure was fabricated via a truly low-cost process. The MAPbI3 thin film was directly synthesized on the rough and porous surface of common printing paper as the light harvester. Thus, the lateral structure photodetector can eliminate need for expensive transparent electrodes, which constitute a major part of the cost in optoelectronic devices. Instead, a commercially available 6B-type graphite pencil was applied to draw a pair of graphite electrodes, which is the simplest way to fabricate graphitic circuitry with an arbitrary pattern on paper. With such a simple and convenient method, the PPDs with MAPbI3 thin films constructed on paper exhibited a satisfactory R of 4.4 mA W−1 and response speed of <10 ms. Meanwhile, the PPDs also exhibited excellent mechanical flexibility and durability, providing a promising candidate for the development of shape-conforming systems, such as wearable electronics and electronic skins. The first ingenious origami PPDs with a 3D configuration were realized based on inspiration from the natural foldability of cellulose paper (Fig. 36). The six pixels located on each face of the cubic photodetector result in a promising approach for 3D detection. Distinguished from the conventional 2D photodetectors, which only give scalar information on incident light, the 3D cubic PPD arrays can also determine the direction of the incident light, displaying excellent spatial recognition ability. Such a fusion of materials science and the art of origami will open a window for the design of low-cost flexible electronics with an emphasis on spatial recognition ability, especially for applications in 3D configurations.

All these photodetector systems and arrays open a new avenue for the realization of low-cost, high-performance, multifunctional and integrated optoelectronic devices, which have wide potential practical application in the field of wearable and portable configurations, imaging and sensor systems.
6. Conclusion and outlook
Perovskite photodetectors have stimulated tremendous attention and extensive research owing to the peculiar optical and electronic properties of perovskite semiconductor materials. The spectral response range of PPDs can be extended using the following strategies: (i) the utilization of mixed-halide or mixed Sn–Pb perovskite materials with smaller optical bandgap, (ii) the combination of inorganic (or organic) materials and perovskite materials and (iii) the combination of up-conversion materials and perovskite materials. Furthermore, the performance of PPDs can be improved via the following routes: (i) the engineering of device structure and interface layer, (ii) the synthesis of varying morphology perovskite active layers (e.g., single crystals, nanowires, and nanorods) and (iii) the construction of a heterojunction between perovskite materials and inorganic (or organic) materials. Filter-free narrowband PPDs have been realized based on the new concept of CCN. The limitation of losing narrowband detection ability under a larger applied bias can be eliminated by utilizing the strategy of self-filter. Filter-free PM-type narrowband PPDs can be achieved by combining the working mechanism of interfacial trap-assisted charge tunneling injection with the concept of CIN. However, despite the great progress achieved for PPDs, there is room for further enhancing the performance and extending the response spectrum of photodetectors. Broadband PPDs with a spectral response range from UV to SWIR (even from X-rays to mid-IR) can be realized via the combination of perovskite materials with other semiconductor materials (also called ternary or quaternary strategy). Also, narrowband PM-type PPDs with a peak response located in the UV (SWIR or mid-IR) wavelength region, accompanied by smaller FWHM and higher SCR, can be achieved by combining the CIN concept with the ternary or quaternary strategy.
Perovskite–organic hybrid photodetectors combining the advantages of both organic and inorganic materials, as a promising future research direction, will not only improve the performance of photodetectors and extend the spectral response range of devices, but also achieve special wavelength detection. Multifunctional PPDs can overcome the limitations of the single functional model and meet the need of versatility in practical application, extending their application field. Flexible PPDs possess extensive applications in the field of wearable and portable devices owing to their reduced cost and weight. Combined with transparent features, flexible devices can be widely employed in various fields, including touch screens and interactive electronics. Novel self-powered PPDs that can work without an external power source open a significant route for next-generation optoelectronic devices that operate wirelessly and independently. Photodetector systems and arrays can be used to construct integrated optoelectronic products, achieving a variety of functions. All these promising research directions will attract increasing attention and possess potential practical application in intelligent optoelectronic systems.
Considering practical applications, the stability and toxicity issues are the most challenging for the development of PPDs, which perovskite solar cells also face. These issues can be essentially solved via the development of chemically stable lead-free perovskite materials. Although broadband PPDs with a spectral response covering the UV to NIR region have been realized, the responsivity of PPDs is relative weak, especially in the NIR region. Thus, the introduction of the PM mechanism in PPDs will be an effective strategy for realizing highly sensitive photodetectors with EQE larger than 100%, exhibiting good weak light detection in the whole response spectrum. Combined with the features of the PM phenomenon, multifunctionality, flexibility, transparency, and self-powering, photodetector systems are competitive for practical application for improving future life.
