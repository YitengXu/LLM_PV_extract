    , Accepted 18th March 2022First published on 21st March 2022AbstractAs we know, defects caused in the synthetic process of metal halide perovskite are the most difficult to overcome, and greatly limit their photoelectric performances. Herein, a post-doped strategy was utilized to achieve an interesting morphology evolution from a standard octahedron to a snowflake-like sheet during the Mn2+-doped Cs2NaBiCl6 process, which realizes the obvious photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) enhancement of the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ phosphor. This surprising evolution is ascribed to the morphology collapse and reconstruction induced by Mn2+ exchange. The obtained phosphor exhibits enhanced 31.56% PLQY, which is two-fold higher than that synthesized by the traditional co-precipitation method, with broad emission spectrum and good PL color stability at 150 °C. Combined with the Cs2SnCl6:1mol%Bi3+ phosphor to fabricate the phosphor-converted light-emitting diode, bright white light emission with Ra = 88, CCT = 4320 K, CIE (0.36, 0.33) and a good application potential in high-resolution PL imaging agents was obtained. This work provides a possible effective strategy to improve the PL performance for impurity-doped lead-free metal halide perovskite.
Introduction
Owing to the remarkable optoelectronic characteristics, lead-free metal halide double perovskites have attracted a great deal of interest in a diverse range of fields, such as solar cells, photodetectors, and LEDs.1–3 Recently, the rapid progress in the power conversion efficiency of solar cells has been achieved via compositional and process engineering.4,5 However, as one kind of novel phosphors for LEDs, their PLQYs are still unsatisfactory for real applications due to a variety of factors, including defects. The doping impurity strategy offers a unique pathway to tune the composition of halide perovskites for optimizing their optical, electrical, and other properties. As an effective doping element, Mn2+ incorporation becomes a hot candidate since it is demonstrated as an effective luminescence center, resulting in interesting physical and chemical properties.6–11 In addition, Mn2+-doped lead-free metal halide perovskite (LFMHP) phosphors have shown low toxicity, an expected good stability, and excellent optical properties.12–15
As reported, the synthetic route of Mn2+-doped metal halide perovskite phosphors, such as CsPbBr3:Mn2+, CsPbCl3:Mn2+, Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+, and Cs4MnBi2Cl12, includes hot-injection method,16–19 hydrothermal method,20 and coprecipitation method,21 which are summarized as the “one-pot” synthetic methods. Although frequently-used hot-injection methods can prepare high quality perovskite materials, the process usually involves complex reaction conditions, uncontrollable swift injection, and tedious purification process, which may limit its application. For the hydrothermal method, it should be noted that to obtain large single crystals or high PLQY, the reaction temperature and the cooling rate must be strictly controlled, which inevitably prolongs the entire reaction process, and more caution should be undertaken to avoid splashing volatile solutions. Coprecipitation seems a simple way but due to all raw materials being added at almost the same time, it is sometimes difficult to control the defects and avoid unexpected impurities. Among all the factors affecting the PLQY, lattice defects formed during the synthetic process are the most difficult to overcome. Therefore, how to use a soft synthetic strategy to modulate defect formation for PL improvement needs to be addressed.
To address the above-mentioned issues, the post-doped cation exchange (CE) strategy22–24 has been utilized in this work. By this method, we successfully synthesized an Mn2+-doped Cs2NaBiCl6 snowflake-like flake phosphor and discovered its morphological evolution from a standard octahedron to a snowflake-like sheet driven by the dissolution-exchange-reprecipitation protocol. Most importantly, this evolution induced effective surface passivation, leading to a two-fold higher PL performance of Mn2+ emission than that synthesized by the traditional co-precipitation way. In addition, the cation exchange mechanism, morphology evolution mechanism, photoluminescence mechanism, and cation exchange kinetics are systematically studied. In comparison to the other works, the difference and significance for the current work are: (i) reporting a fast post-doped route to realize for the first time the surface modulation of Mn2+-doped Cs2NaBiCl6 phosphor and clearly elucidating its mechanism; (ii) through this post-doped surface re-modulation, greatly boosting the orange-red luminescence of Mn2+.
Experimental
Materials and sample synthesis
Cesium chloride (CsCl, 99.9%), sodium chloride (NaCl, 99.5%), indium chloride (InCl3, 99.99%), bismuth chloride (BiCl3, 99.99%), tin chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, 99.99%), manganese chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O, 99%), and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt%) were purchased from Macklin Chemical Reagent Company. All the chemicals were used without any further purification.
The whole synthetic process is displayed in Scheme 1; Cs2NaBiCl6 micro-sized precursors are synthesized by the coprecipitation method. In a typical synthesis, 0.630 g (2 mmol) of BiCl3 and 0.116 g (2 mmol) of NaCl are taken in a beaker with 8 mL HCl. The reaction can be kept at the room temperature with vigorous stirring until all the raw materials get dissolved. Then, 0.674 g (4 mmol) CsCl is slowly added to the reaction mixture. The reaction is continued for another 20 min to make sure that it is complete. The reaction temperature can be adjusted according to the size requirements. The higher the temperature, the larger the size. The obtained precipitates are filtered out, washed three times with ethanol, and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 2 h. The purity of the obtained precursor can be identified by powder XRD. If the precursor purity can be determined, the filtration and drying steps are permitted to be skipped, and the following Mn2+ doping process can be directly employed for the one-step reaction. Moreover, the large-scale synthetic of the precursor can be implemented to ensure the consistency of raw materials in post-doped Mn2+ exchange process, which avoids the inconsistent experimental results caused by repetitive operation and improves the repeatability. For Mn2+ doping, 0.197 g (1 mmol) MnCl2·4H2O is added in 5 mL HCl solution until complete dissolution. Then, 1 mmol precursor was added and reacted under 60 °C for 20 min. The phosphor was obtained after filtering out, washing, and drying. In this step, the reaction temperature, stirring time, and initial Mn2+ concentration can be adjusted to control the particle size and Mn2+ doping concentration to achieve optimal luminous performance. Through the aforementioned cation exchange process, the pictures of the reaction solution before and after the Mn2+ exchange are shown on the right side of Scheme 1. The color of the mixture solution changed from deep-green to light-green after 4 days aging under ambient circumstances, indicating a remarkable decrease in the Mn2+ concentration in the solution, which proved from one side that the Mn2+ ions in the solution have exchanged with the precursor. The dynamic reaction process is exhibited by a short video (ESI†), and the obvious increase in orange-red light within 10 min indicates fast Mn2+ exchange speed. The synthesis of Cs2SnCl6:Bi3+ was carried out as given in a previous report.25

Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded using a XRD-6000, SHIMADZU X-ray diffraction machine equipped with Cu Kα (1.54 Å) radiation in the range of 2θ = 10°–60° with a step-angle of 0.08°, a tube voltage of 30 kV, and a tube current of 20 mA. The morphology was observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, a Zeiss Ultra Plus instrument) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analyses (JEM-21000, JEOL, Japan). For the further elemental analysis of Mn2+, Cs+, Bi3+, and Na+, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was carried out using a quadrupole-ICP-MS spectrometer. Steady-state PL, PL Excitation (PLE), PLQY, and temperature-dependent luminescence property were measured using an Edinburgh FLS980 Instrument. The UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained by a U-3310 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan).
Computational details of the band structure, formation energy, and surface energy
For theoretical details, first-principles calculations based on DFT were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package code.26,27 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Emzerhof (PBE) function with the projector augmented wave (PAW) has been used to describe the exchange–correlation interactions. In order to ensure convergence of our calculation results, the cutoff energy has been set at 400 eV for the structures. All the structures were fully relaxed (atomic position) up to 10−5 eV Å−1 and max force of 0.01 eV Å−1. The Brillouin zone integral was summed over the full Brillouin zone using 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst–Pack special k points.
All the DFT calculations are performed using the program package DMol3 in Materials Studio of Accelrys. The exchange-functional is treated using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function. The global orbital cutoff of 5.1 Å are adopted to improve the computational performance. The Brillouin zone integration is performed using 1 × 1 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling for a primitive cell. The tolerances of the energy, gradient, and displacement convergence are 2 × 10−5 Hartree, 4 × 10−3 Hartree per Å, and 5 × 10−3 Å.
Theoretical calculations were performed based on the density functional theory (DFT), which is implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional28 of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type was applied to deal with the electron exchange correlation interactions with projector-augmented-wave (PAW) potentials.29 To ensure enough space between the neighboring slabs due to periodic condition, a vacuum layer of about 15 Å was adopted in the surface direction. The energy cutoff was set to 450 eV and the 9 × 9 × 1 MonkhorstPack k-mesh were used to sample the Brillouin zone (BZ). To calculate the surface energy, the bulk structure was split into two (111) surfaces.
PcLED fabrication and performance measurement
PcLED is fabricated by a mixture of transparent silicone resin and phosphor blend of the obtained Cs2(Na0.81Mn0.19)(Bi0.79Mn0.21)Cl6, Cs2SnCl6:1 mol%Bi3+ phosphors on a 365 nm chip. After vacuum treatment to remove the air bubbles, the mixture was coated on the lead frame and subsequently heated at 100 °C for 1 h and 150 °C for 3 h. The electroluminescence parameters were monitored under 3 V and 200 mA using a high-accuracy LED photo-color and electron test system (HSP6000, Hangzhou Hongpu Optoelectronics Technology Co. Ltd, China).
Results and discussion
Phase identification, exchange relationship, and morphologic evolution

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of Mn2+ exchange proceeding within 0 min, 1 min, 5 min, and 10 min, confirming that all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the PDF#77-1831 card and no traces of other impurity phases are observed. On Mn2+ doping, the diffraction peaks shift to a larger angle, indicating that Mn2+ successfully enters the Cs2NaBiCl6 structure. This change can be explained by Bragg's law: 2dsin(θ) = nλ(1)where d is the interplanar crystal spacing, λ is the diffraction wavelength of X-ray, and θ is the diffraction angle. The larger Na+ (CN = 6, R = 1.02 Å) and Bi3+ (CN = 6, R = 1.03 Å) are partially replaced by smaller Mn2+ (CN = 6, R = 0.83 Å). This leads to the shrinkage of the lattice cell, resulting in the diffraction angle shift.

Because there are two possible CE sites, namely, [NaCl6]5− and [BiCl6]3− octahedron, to estimate the possibility of the exchange relationship, according to defect chemistry, the acceptable percentage difference in the ionic radius should not exceed 25%.30 The exchange relation can be inferred from the following equation (2)where Dr is the radius percentage discrepancy and CN is the coordination number. Rm and Rd are the radii of the host cation and the doped cation, respectively. It is easy to know that the values of Dr between Mn2+ and Na+/Bi3+ are 18.63% and 19.42%, respectively, which are less than the limiting value. On account of the close Dr, theoretically, the exchange possibility of Mn2+ to Na+/Bi3+ should be equal. In order to verify this possibility in theory, the formation energy (Ef) of Cs2NaBiCl6, two hypothetic products under extreme situation, and Cs2(Na0.81Mn0.19)(Bi0.79Mn0.21)Cl6 are calculated by DFT simulation, is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The Ef of Cs2NaBiCl6 is acquired with −295.77 eV, Cs2NaMnCl6 with −341.34 eV, and Cs2MnBiCl6 with −353.33 eV, indicating that if Mn2+ is totally exchanged with Na+ or Bi3+, two more stable compounds will be formed. However, in the actual situation, due to the limitation of law of electric charge conservation, Mn2+ is impossible to be completely exchanged with Na+/Bi3+; thus, the more stable Cs2(Na1−xMnx)(Bi1−xMnx)Cl6 solid solution (Ef = −327.15 eV) will be formed. In addition, a large formation energy ladder between Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2(Na0.81Mn0.19)(Bi0.79Mn0.21)Cl6 may prompt spontaneous Mn2+ exchange with no need for heating and stirring. This hypothesis was verified through experiments: the precursor and MnCl2·4H2O were mixed in HCl solution for 4 days’ aging; obvious orange-red luminescence was obtained, confirming the existence of Mn2+ in the parent structure. It should be pointed out that the halogen ligand [X]− in the metal halide perovskite should be in accordance with that in MnX2. Otherwise, there will be substantial energy barrier and the reaction cannot occur.
The delicate morphology evolution is observed by FE-SEM, corresponding to 0 min, 1 min, 5 min, and 10 min of CE. Before the addition of Mn2+, the morphology of Cs2NaBiCl6 particles presents a standard quadrigonal-biconical-octahedron shape containing 8 highly symmetric facets {111}, 8 vertices, and 12 edges (Fig. 1b). With Mn2+ exchange at 60 °C for 1 min, the morphology shows an obvious variation, forming an irregular polygon sheet-like shape with a thickness of 1 μm, and a spot of tiny pinholes appear at the edges of the exposed surface, represented by white circles (Fig. 1c). Then, a beautiful eight petals flower-like shape is observed after 5 min Mn2+ exchanges, showing up to 10 μm width, and also has a few tiny pinholes (Fig. 1d), which are surface defects left behind in the morphological evolution process. After the 10 min reaction, the morphology tends to thinner and stable, and exhibits an exquisite octangle snowflake-like sheet with 60 nm thickness (Fig. 1e and f). In order to exclude the cause of the etching effect of HCl solvent, a blank experiment was carried out. The Cs2NaBiCl6 precursor was immersed in HCl for 10 min under stirring, which exhibited a complete octahedral morphology (Fig. S2, ESI†). Thus, this morphological evolution could be attributed to the CE of Mn2+ rather than acid etching. Also, the repeatability of this result had been confirmed by several experiments. The FE-SEM images of the Mn2+-doped products under four common reaction conditions were selected and are displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
The HRTEM images are presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a and b show the various domain structures with a wide and blurry grain boundary, which exhibit the trace of the dissolution and the exchange process. As shown in Fig. 2d, the lattice fringe measurement is identified, and its corresponding d spacing is 3.83 Å and 6.26 Å, which matches the lattice planes (220) and (111), respectively. The angle between these two facets is 61° which is very close to the standard value 60°. In addition, the elemental mapping images are presented to identify the coexistence and homogeneous element distribution of Cs, Na, Bi, Cl, and Mn (Fig. 2c).

Mechanistic analysis of cation exchange and morphology evolution
As shown in Scheme 2, Cs2NaBiCl6 partly dissolves into Cs+, [NaCl6]5−, and [BiCl6]3− groups in hydrochloric acid, which is called the dissolution procedure. Once Mn2+ occurs in the solution, it will rapidly exchange with Na+ and Bi3+ to form two [MnCl6]4− groups caused by the Ef driving force. The quick reduction of [NaCl6]5− and [BiCl6]3− around the reaction zone breaks the solubility equilibrium of the system and further accelerates the dissolution to the right, contributing more [NaCl6]5− and [BiCl6]3− for exchange. Na+ and Bi3+ are kicked out by exchanged Mn2+ interstitials and migrate through the interstitial sites. Parent structural distortions and point defects assist the Na+/Bi3+ jump out by locally expanded voids and reduced Coulombic repulsion between Mn2+ and Na+/Bi3+.31 As a consequence, Mn2+ enters the host lattice and reprecipitates new Cs2(Na1−xMnx)(Bi1−xMnx)Cl6 solid solution. The constant exchange keeps the reaction going to the right until the equilibrium is reestablished.
 Scheme 2  Cation exchange process of Mn2+-doped Cs2NaBiCl6. 
In order to clearly show the process of morphology evolution and explain its mechanism, the two-dimensional projection of the exposed facet (111) is used to draw a schematic diagram. As shown in Fig. 3a, when the Cs2NaBiCl6 precursor is added into hydrochloric acid solution of Mn2+, abundant Mn2+ start to exchange with Na+ and Bi3+ from all the directions via the diffusion-based process, which breaks the thermodynamic equilibrium that maintains the morphology. In this process, the tip positions and ridge places of the pyramid-like morphology are generally subject to stronger tensile stress from the interior and compressive stress from the solution. Once this balance is broken, great unbalanced stress will be generated at the apexes of the octahedral body, causing inward collapse from the apexes. Due to the different size and microenvironment of each particle, different stresses will be generated in different positions and directions, thus forming various irregular polygonal plates shape. As the non-equilibrium state goes on, in order to reduce the surface pressure, the irregular polygon turns into the thermodynamically preferred, spherical morphology and collapses further toward the center, forming a flower-like shape. As the CE continues, the petals begin to decompose, and only eight edges from the center are left at last, forming the eight-sided thinner snowflake morphology. The above morphology evolution process could be named as “doping remodulation”. Moreover, the HRTEM images of the precursor and the Mn2+ exchange sample are exhibited in Fig. 3b and c, demonstrating that CE is initiated at the surface of the particle from different directions and gradually pushed to the center, thereby causing it to collapse inward along the tips and edges and create a clear chiaroscuro boundary. In order to quantitatively analyze the thermodynamic driving force of “doping recombination”, we utilized the DFT to calculate the surface energy (γ) changes caused by CE. γ is a measure of the destruction of the chemical bonds between the molecules that create the substance surface, and changes in the atomic bonding on the surface of crystals are the cause of the surface energy. As a case study of Mn2+-doped Cs2NaBiCl6, it is decomposed into [NaCl6]5− and [BiCl6]3− groups in hydrochloric acid, while Mn2+ is bound to break the chemical bonds of Na–Cl and Bi–Cl to form the [MnCl6]4− groups. By calculation, the γ of Cs2NaBiCl6 can be 5.8 eV and after CE (Cs2(Na0.81Mn0.19)(Bi0.79Mn0.21)Cl6), it is decreased to 5.6 eV. The reduction of γ proves that the driving force of morphology evolution is the CE process because the exchange and recombination of atoms inevitably lead to a rise in the surface energy and obtain an unstable surface, which drives morphology change to the direction of reducing the surface energy and stabilizing the morphology. Moreover, according to solid-state physics, surface atoms have more energy than internal atoms. Therefore, on the basis of the principle of minimum energy, atoms tend spontaneously to the interior rather than the surface, inducing a collapse of the morphology toward the center to form a snowflake.

Discussion of the energy band structure and luminescence property
Although the luminescence properties of the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ micro-sized single crystal and nanocrystal have been reported,32,33 due to the unusual morphology evolution, it is necessary to reanalyze the luminescence mechanism and band structure of this phosphor in order to discover the possible difference. The UV-visible absorption spectra of Cs2NaBiCl6 and the Mn2+-doped samples are presented in Fig. 4a. For Cs2NaBiCl6, unlike that in the aforementioned report, all five absorption bands of 6S2 → 6S1P1 transitions from the [BiCl6]3− octahedra are observed, which include the spin-forbidden 1S0 → 3P0,1,2 transition and the spin-allowed 1S0 → 1P1 transition.34 The first small peak near 200 nm is assigned to the fully allowed 1S0 → 1P1 transition, and the second broad peak at 271 nm is assigned to the 1S0 → 3P2 transition, whereas the strong absorption and obvious splitting peaks at 317 and 343 nm are for the 1S0 → 3P1 transition due to the spin–orbit interaction between 3P1 and 1P1 (J = 1), which somewhat relaxes the selection rule and may partially allow the 1S0 → 3P1 transition.35 Moreover, this splitting is attributed to a dynamic Jahn–Teller effect induced by the coupling of lattice vibrations with empty T1u orbitals with antibonding Bi 6p–Cl 3p character.36 The shoulder peak near 380 nm is assigned to the 1S0 → 3P0 transition. The weak intensity of this peak is due to the nature of spin- and parity-forbidden transition. Since Mn2+ is doped in the Cs2NaBiCl6 structure, the weak characteristic absorption peaks of Mn2+: 6A1g → 4T2g (417 nm) and 6A1g → 4T1g (528 nm) occur, which are attributed to its spin-forbidden transition. The precursor has no absorption in the visible light region, while the Mn2+-doped samples show a weak absorption in this region, which is why Cs2NaBiCl6 shows white color but Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ exhibits a light pink color under visible light (insets in Fig. 4a). To obtain more details on the band structures, the optical band gaps are calculated based on the UV-vis absorption data. The corresponding equation is presented as follows37 (αhν)n = A(hν − Eg)(3)where A, α, h, and ν stand for the constant, absorption coefficient, Planck constant, and frequency, respectively. Eg is the energy of the band gap and n represents the direct or indirect transition, which equals 2 or 1/2. According to previous reports,38,39 1/2 is used. The corresponding Tauc plots for optical band-gap fitting are depicted at the right side of Fig. 4a; an indirect band gap of the Cs2NaBiCl6 host with a shallow absorption at an edge value of 2.85 eV followed by an increase in the absorption edge at 3.25 eV is deduced. With the doping of Mn2+, these two band gaps become smaller—the shallow edge shifts from 2.85 eV to 2.70 eV and the deep edge narrows down from 3.25 eV to 2.95 eV.

In order to investigate the changes in the electrical band structure of Cs2NaBiCl6 by introducing Mn2+, first-principles calculations for Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2Na0.75Mn0.25Bi0.75Mn0.25Cl6 were performed. Combining with the calculated band structure and the density of states (DOS) of Cs2NaBiCl6, this host shows an indirect band-gap with the valence band maximum (VBM) at the Γ point and the conduction band minimum (CBM) at the L point, contributing to the 3.73 eV band gap, which corresponds to our experimental measurement of 2.85 eV. A direct transition of 3.87 eV is also possible at the L point, corresponding to the experimental feature at 3.25 eV (Fig. S4, ESI† left side). The VBM consists mainly of the Cl 3p orbitals with a small contribution from Bi 6s orbitals, and the CBM is predominantly derived from the Bi 6p orbitals (Fig. S4, ESI† right side). While the contribution of the Na s, p orbitals is negligible, the s, p orbitals of Cs mainly constitute the deep valence bands (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†), which have no influence on the band gap. The calculated band gap (3.73 eV) is higher than the experimental result (2.85 eV), which is reasonable since the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect is not taken into account in our implemented DFT-PBE calculation. Comparing with the PBE + SOC calculation of Cs2NaBiCl6 elsewhere,40 the band gap by only PBE calculation is almost 0.9 eV higher. Although the band-gap from PBE calculation shows a deflection from the experimental value, such a distinction would not influence our qualitative analysis on the electronic and optical properties of Cs2NaBiCl6. To investigate the band edge states after Mn2+ exchange, the calculated band structure and DOS of Cs2Na0.75Mn0.25Bi0.75Mn0.25Cl6 are also shown in Fig. 4b. Visibly, the 3d orbitals of the introduced Mn2+ could hybridize with the Bi 6p orbitals and lower the conduct band distinctly but with a negligible effect on the valence band edge state. Meanwhile, the band gap for Mn2+-doped Cs2NaBiCl6 decreases from 3.73 eV to 1.81 eV, which is close to the experimental PL peak (2.08 eV).
The PLE and PL spectra are shown in Fig. 4c; no excitation and emission are detected from the Cs2NaBiCl6 host. However, the Mn2+-doped sample exhibits a broad excitation band centered at 295, 355, and 430 nm, and a shoulder peak at 314 nm. These peaks are not only ascribed to the 1S0 → 3P2 (295 nm) and 1S0 →3P1 (355 nm and 314 nm) transitions of the [BiCl6]3− octahedron but are also attributed to the characteristic excitation 6A2 → 4T2 (430 nm) from the [MnCl6]4− octahedron. Interestingly, when Mn2+ is introduced into the host, the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ sample exhibits intense orange-red emission upon UV light illumination, proving that Mn2+ plays a key role as an emissive center because of its d → d transition, and the maximum 31.56% PLQY is achieved from Cs2(Na0.81Mn0.19)(Bi0.79Mn0.21)Cl6 (Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†), which is about two-fold higher than the previously reported value (PLQY = 15%).36 In order to verify that this morphological evolution is conducive for Mn2+ emission in the Cs2NaBiCl6 crystal, we used the traditional coprecipitate method to prepare octahedral Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ as the blank sample. We chose polygon sheet-like, flower-like, and snowflake samples with similar Mn2+ content to compare their relative luminescence intensity (The corresponding reaction condition and Mn2+ content of different samples are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Note: the cation exchange method can bring more Mn2+ into the lattice in a short time, but fewer in the co-precipitation process. As long as we control the reaction temperature, the initial Mn2+ concentration, or the reaction time of these two synthetic processes, the selection of samples with similar Mn2+ content can be realized). As shown in Fig. 4d, under the premise of the same Mn2+ content, the relative PL intensity is gradually improved due to morphology rearrangement, and the intensity of the stable snowflake sample is 63.2% higher than that of the octahedral sample. This is because post-doped Mn2+ exchange behavior leads to different sizes and irregular particles formed by the precipitation process, which become more regular and are conducive for the improvement of PLQY. On the other hand, this synthetic strategy is equivalent to the surface passivation treatment for the particles, which is helpful to eliminate the defects for achieving high PLQY. Similar results can be found in many literatures that support our analysis.41–43 The HRTEM images of the samples before and after Mn2+ doping are used to verify this conclusion. From Fig. 4f, it can be found that the precursors prepared by the coprecipitation method have incomplete lattice fringes with many breakpoints and unclear lattice fringes in many regions, indicating poor crystallinity. On the contrary, the lattice stripes of the sample synthesized by the Mn2+ post-doped strategy are continuous, clear, and with fewer breakpoints (Fig. 4g), indicating that the post-doped strategy is beneficial for defects modulation and weakening their negative effects on the luminescence properties. Moreover, in order to support this “defect modulation theory”, we further annealed the octahedral sample and the snowflake sample, and compared their PL intensity changes before and after annealing. As shown in Fig. S8, (ESI†) the PL intensity of the snowflake samples shows little change before and after annealing, while the octahedral sample shows a slight increase, which demonstrates the existence of defects in octahedral particles, further confirming that the advancement of morphological evolution.
To investigate the underlying luminous mechanism of this phosphor, we employed different excitation wavelengths for PL measurement. At different excitation wavelengths (295, 314, 355, 430 nm), no shift is found in the PL emission spectra (Fig. 4c). These evidences confirm that the orange-red emission originates from the same excited state relaxation (4T1g → 6A1g transition of Mn2+). But the PL intensity is positively correlated with the excitation energy; if excited by the characteristic excitation wavelength of Mn2+, the PL intensity is very low. On the other hand, when it is converted to the Bi3+ excitation wavelength, the PL intensity will be significantly enhanced (Fig. S9, ESI†), which demonstrates that the [BiCl6]3− octahedron acts as an UV light photosensitizer to produce excitons. On the other hand, Mn2+ in the [MnCl6]4− octahedron functions well as the exciton acceptor and there is an intense energy transfer from [BiCl6]3− to [MnCl6]4−. Moreover, it is well known that the excitons in lead-free metal halide double perovskites will be self-trapped and then released by impurity doping.44–49 In the current case, no obvious emission of self-trapped excitons is not detected; thus, the energy transfer from the self-trapped state to the [MnCl6]4− groups should also be taken into account. These energy transfer processes are also confirmed by the emission lifetime of Mn2+. As discussed below, with the increase in the reaction time, the concentration of Mn2+ will first increase and then gradually become constant. In Fig. S10, (ESI†) the fluorescence lifetime of Mn2+ at different reaction times was monitored; we found that within 30 min, the fluorescence lifetime of Mn2+ did not decrease with the increase in the Mn2+ concentration, indicating that the energy transfer from Bi3+ to Mn2+ can offset the non-radiative transition of Mn2+. As the reaction time increases, the non-radiative transition of Mn2+ dominates, leading to a decrease in the lifetime. As the reaction time continues to increase, more Mn2+ enters the lattice, resulting in the release of the self-trapped excitons, which supplement the energy lost in the non-radiative transition and increase the lifetime. On prolonging the reaction time, due to the ion exchange reaching equilibrium and the excitons that are exhausted, the lifetime is shortened again. Based on the above discussion, the excitons transition and transfer mechanism of each structural unit in the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ system is clearly delineated in Fig. 4e.
Kinetic factor of Mn2+ exchange, temperature-dependent PL property, and application
We have already known that this dissolution-exchange-reprecipitation process can be performed at room temperature, but the kinetic factors that affect the efficiency of Mn2+ exchange are not clear. We consider three aspects: stirring time, temperature and initial Mn2+ concentration. ICP-MS is used to accurately detect the real Mn2+ doping content under different kinetic factors (Tables S3–S5, ESI†), and the exchange efficiency (ηEx) by the ratio of the actual Mn2+ concentration to that of the original is evaluated, as shown in the following formula (4)Where ηEx is the exchange efficiency, which roughly represents a course rating of CE (higher ηEx, easier CE), and CMn-actual and CMn-addition represent the actual Mn2+ concentration and that added, respectively.

Fig. 5a shows the influence of temperature on ηEx and the PL integral intensity. The ηEx is enhanced from 12.92% to 22.96% with the temperature from 30 °C to 90 °C, indicating a monotonically increasing trend, as well as the PL integral intensity. The stirring time exhibits a trend of first increasing and then stabilizing with the maximum ηEx equal with 26.68%. Under 30 °C, the value of ηEx will not increase after 240 min but the PL integral intensity shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, indicating that the Mn2+ concentration reaches the optimal doping point when ηEx reaches 25.16% (Fig. 5b). The initial Mn2+ concentration also has a positive effect on the improvement of ηEx and the PL integral intensity, as well as showing a monotonically increasing trend within 0.40 mol L−1 of the initial Mn2+ concentration (Fig. 5c). In summary, the CE process is synergistically promoted by temperature, stirring time, and initial Mn2+ concentration due to its contribution to the acceleration of ion diffusion, which demonstrates that the transport of ions between the precursor and the doping ions is the rate-limiting step. Surprisingly, as Fig. 5d shows, the PL spectra of this phosphor exhibits a good PL color stability under 425 K and the spectra is only broadened slightly when the temperature is up to 425 K, which is probably due to the more stable solid solution structure and higher structural rigidity caused by the introduction of smaller ions that prevent PL quenching.50–52

To demonstrate the application of the Cs2(Na0.81Mn0.19)(Bi0.79Mn0.21)Cl6 phosphor, we fabricated PcLED using Cs2(Na0.81Mn0.19)(Bi0.79Mn0.21)Cl6, Cs2SnCl6:Bi3+, and a 365 nm chip, showing bright white light emission with Ra = 88, CCT = 4320 K, and CIE (0.36, 0.33), which displays a application in solid state lighting (Fig. 5e and f). Moreover, by filling the Cs2(Na0.81Mn0.19)(Bi0.79Mn0.21)Cl6 powder into the designed patterned grooves, delicate images such as a star are clearly presented, suggesting its prospects as a high-resolution PL imaging agent (inset in Fig. 5f).
Conclusions
To summarize, we demonstrated the ability of the post-doped CE synthetic strategy to modulate the defects of the LFMHP material during the doping process, resulting in obvious PL enhancement. This result reveals a new outcome of cation exchange: morphology reestablishment. By this method, we synthesized the snowflake-like Cs2(Na0.81Mn0.19)(Bi0.79Mn0.21)Cl6 phosphor with a broad emission spectrum from 500 to 700 nm, enhanced PLQY of 31.56%, and good color stability at 150 °C, showing great application potential in Pc-LED. Therefore, this work provides a possible effective defect modulation strategy for impurity doping in LFMHP to obtain better luminescence. Moreover, we hope that this method will be employed in the synthesis of other transition metal- or rare earth ion-doped phosphors to independently study their doping behavior.
