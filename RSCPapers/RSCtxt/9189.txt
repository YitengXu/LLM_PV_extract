    , Accepted 11th January 2019First published on 15th January 2019AbstractA series of Zn–porphyrin dyes with different donor and π-linker groups based on the dye SM315 were systematically investigated to screen highly efficient candidates based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations. Compared with SM315, dye 1 not only has stronger and broader absorption spectra and larger intramolecular charge transition (ICT) parameters, but also has a larger maximum short circuit density (JmaxSC) and an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) due to the insertion of polyoxometalate (POM). In addition, dye 3 with an electron donor 3-ethynyl-7-(4-methoxyphenyl)-10-methyl-10,10a-dihydro-4aH-phenothiazine (D3) exhibits better photovoltaic performance among dyes 1–3 due to its broadest absorption spectra and largest JmaxSC, hence, D3 can act as a promising donor candidate for the construction of efficient dyes. Furthermore, the performance can be further improved by replacing the π-linker 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (dye 3) with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-2,6-dione (dye 4) and pyrrolo[2,3-f]indole-2,6(1H,5H)-dione (dye 5). Compared with dye 3, dyes 4 and 5 possess broader absorption spectra and light harvesting efficiency curves, larger ICT parameters, JmaxSC and conduction band energy shift. In particular, dye 4 might obtain a larger short-circuit photocurrent density, and dye 5 might obtain a larger VOC.
1. Introduction
In the global motif of sustainable development, a large number of research efforts have been devoted to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) due to their low-cost and environmentally friendly fabrication.1–4 DSSCs mainly consist of a dye-sensitized semiconductor photoanode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte solution containing a redox pair. Considering the important roles of dyes in DSSCs, massive efforts were made seeking potential dyes for use in DSSCs to further improve the efficiency of light-to-electric energy conversion. Recently, ruthenium polypyridines,5,6 metal free organic dyes7,8 and porphyrins9,10 have been fully investigated. Particularly, porphyrins are considered as the most promising candidates in light of their lower material costs, higher extinction coefficients and better tunable photophysical properties by the variation of molecular structures.11,12 Porphyrin chromophores show a strong light absorption band at 400–500 nm (Soret band) and a moderately weak absorption at 550–700 nm (Q band).13 Moreover, porphyrin-based dyes typically possess donor–π linker–acceptor (D–π–A) structures in which the push–pull effect could accelerate the electron injection and retard the recombination of an electron and a hole. At the same time, the D–π–A structures can facilitate molecular tailoring and enrich the diversity of dyes. Hence, the porphyrin-based D–π–A configurations provide a highly flexible platform for developing efficient dyes. In 2011, Yella and co-workers reported a high measured power conversion efficiency of 12.3% by co-sensitization of the D–π–A type Zn–porphyrin dye YD2-o-C8 and organic dye Y123.9 Subsequently, the conversion efficiency of 13% has been achieved through a Zn–porphyrin dye SM315 with the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple.10 However, two inherent drawbacks of porphyrins have limited the conversion efficiency for further improvement. Firstly, even though the porphyrin dyes have intrinsically intense absorption in the Soret and Q bands, there is absorption vacancy in the spectral region between these two bands. Secondly, the limited absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region of solar spectra decreases the light harvesting ability. Therefore, porphyrin dyes with a panchromatic light harvesting response to improve photovoltaic performance are highly desirable.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a unique family of metal–oxygen clusters, have been widely applied in many fields, such as catalysis, material science and magnetism owing to their remarkably diverse chemical structures and electronic versatilities.14–20 Recently, POMs were used in DSSCs as photosensitizers. Three Keggin-type POMs SiW9Co3, SiW10MnIII2 and SiW10MnIII/IV2 were used as pure inorganic photosensitizers in p-DSSCs and all the energy conversion efficiencies were higher than that of coumarin 343.21 Two Dawson-type POMs, P2W17Co and P2W17Mn were introduced into p-DSSCs to co-sensitize a NiO electrode, and a conversion efficiency of 0.0464% was achieved, which is the highest value reported for inorganic photosensitizers in p-DSSCs.22 In addition, POMs are well-know electron-withdrawing groups and can be used as inorganic building blocks for constructing inorganic–organic hybrids. The maximum absorption bands of hybrids might significantly red-shift in comparison with POMs and organic segments because of the synergistic effect between the POMs and organic segments.23 Accordingly, the inorganic–organic hybrids in which POMs act as electron acceptors and Zn–porphyrins act as electron donors can be used as dyes and have promising potential for application in DSSCs.24–26

SM315 exhibits a higher conversion efficiency of 13% than SM371 (12%) by introducing 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) as a π-linker, giving us a hint that the conversion efficiency of DSSCs could further improve through rational modification of the π-linkers in D–π–A dyes.10 Following this idea, different π-linkers were tried in D–π–A dyes to enhance the conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Which one is the best for this series of Zn–porphyrin dyes? And is it efficient to tune the donor groups of the dyes rather than the π-linkers for optimizing the performance of DSSCs? Puzzled by these questions, POM-based Zn–porphyrin dyes are analyzed aiming at exploring a new approach to rational design of dyes. Theoretical calculations as low-cost and reliable ways are becoming crucial tools to describe the properties of dyes and predict the performance of dyes in DSSCs.27–31 In the present work, a series of POM-based porphyrin dyes derived from synthesized dye SM315 were designed and analyzed systematically by using density function theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations aiming at seeking high performance dyes. The electronic properties, absorption spectra and charge transition (CT) characteristics, short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), and open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) as the key factors affecting the performance of DSSCs were investigated. It is expected that the present work could give theoretical guidelines to design high performance dyes.
2. Methods
2.1. Theoretical background
The key factors affecting power conversion efficiency (η) are shown in Fig. 1, and it can be expressed as:32 (1)where JSC is the short-circuit photocurrent density, VOC is the open-circuit photovoltage, IS is the intensity of the incident light and FF is the fill factor of the cell. Accordingly, improving JSC and VOC is an effective method to enhance η. The JSC can be defined as follows:33 (2)where LHE(λ), the light harvesting efficiency at a specific wavelength, is determined by LHE(λ) = 1 – 10−Γσ(λ). Γ is the surface loading of dyes grafted onto TiO2 and is set to 8.35 × 10−7 mol cm−2 according to the experimental value of SM315,10 and σ is the absorption cross-section (cm2 mol−1), which is obtained from the extinction coefficient (M−1 cm−1) by multiplying with 1000 cm3 L−1. Φinject is the electron injection efficiency, which is closely connected with ΔGinj, the driving force of electron injection from the excited state of dyes to the TiO2 surface, and ΔGinj can be determined by the following equation:34 ΔGinj = Edye* − ECB(3)where Edye* is the oxidation potential of the dye in the excited state, which is related to the oxidation potential of the dye in the ground state (Edye) and the vertical transition energy (EV), i.e., Edye* = Edye − EV.34ECB is the reduction potential of the TiO2 conduction band (CB) and the experimental value −4.00 eV (vs. vacuum) is used.35ηcollect is the charge collection efficiency, which is assumed to be a constant for the same DSSCs.
 Fig. 1  Key factors affecting η from the dye's point of view. 
In order to evaluate the CT abilities of dyes, the CT parameters including the amount of transferred charges (qCT), the corresponding effective distance (dCT) and the t index, which assess the degree of separation between ρ+ (r) and ρ− (r) based on the total densities for the ground and excited states were calculated.36–38 The difference in electronic densities related to the electronic transition is given by: Δρ (r) = ρES (r) − ρGS (r)(4)where ρES (r) and ρGS (r) are proposed to represent the electronic densities of the excited and ground states, respectively. ρ+ (r) and ρ− (r) are defined as the points in space where the density increment and depletion upon absorption are produced. And qCT can be proposed as: (5)
The barycenters (r+ and r−) of density distributions defined by ρ+ (r) and ρ− (r) are defined by the following equations: (6) (7)The difference between r+ and r− is defined as the charge transfer distance dCT.
The hole and electron can be decomposed to atom and fragment contributions. Contribution to the hole/electron by an atom can be derived as follows. Considering the normalization condition of the hole (de-excitation part is temporarily ignored for simplicity).39 (8) (9) (10) (11)where χ denotes the basis function, S and C are the overlap matrix and coefficient matrix, respectively. If we employ the Mulliken-like method to partition the  term as atomic contributions, then we can define the contribution of an atom A to a hole in the below form: (12)
We can similarly apply the above treatment on the de-excitation part of the hole as well as the electron. The actual equations used to evaluate atomic contributions to the hole and electron are as follows: (13) (14)where T is an intermediate matrix for facilitating the calculation and it is defined as Tijμ,ν = Cμ,iCν,jSμ,ν.
Fragment contributions to the hole and electron can be simply evaluated by summing up the atomic contributions as: (15) (16)
Contribution of the basis function μ to the hole and electron can be defined as: (17) (18)
Furthermore, the atom/fragment contributions can be directly plotted as a heat map (equal to a colored matrix map) for visual inspection of the hole–electron distribution.
As for VOC, it can be defined by:40 (19)where nc is the number of electrons in the CB, while q and KT are constants, representing the unit charge and thermal energy, respectively. NCB and Eredox are always assumed as constants, which represent the accessible density of CB states and the oxidation potential of the electrolyte. ECB is the conduction band edge of TiO2, and the dye absorbed on the TiO2 surface can lead to the energy shift of ECB (ΔECB). Apparently, a dye with large nc and ΔECB will induce a significant increase of VOC.
2.2. Computation details
All the calculations were performed with Gaussian 09 D01 package.41 The ground-state geometries of all dyes were fully optimized at the B3LYP42 level with LANL2DZ for Zn and Mo atoms and 6-31G(d) basis set for the other atoms. The frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels were obtained at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level based on the optimized structures, and Edye was calculated at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)/LANL2DZ level. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were performed to calculate the excitation energy and oscillator strength of dyes by computing the lowest 30 singlet–singlet excitation energies, which can be convoluted into absorption spectra by using Gaussian functions with half-width at half maximum of 0.2 eV. To enhance the computing efficiency, the long alkyl chains in SM315 were replaced with the methyl groups, which have negligible influence on photovoltaic properties of dyes.43,44 The absorption spectra of SM315 were simulated by CAM-B3LYP45 and M0646 functionals to evaluate the influence of functionals on the transition energies and the results are described in Fig. S1 and Table S1 (ESI†). Compared with the M06 functional, the absorption spectra simulated by CAM-B3LYP is in well agreement with the experimental value,10 confirming that the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level is appropriate in this work.
In order to gain insights into the ΔECB due to the adsorption of dyes, the structures of dyes absorbed on (TiO2)9 through the bidentate binding mode47 were analyzed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level. The reliability of (TiO2)9 clusters was proved by Sánchez-de-Armas and Sanz et al.48 The density of states (DOS) of pure TiO2 and partial DOS (PDOS) of TiO2 in the dye–TiO2 complexes used to evaluated the ΔECB were obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)/LANL2DZ level, and the D3 dispersion corrections were considered. In order to obtain the number of electrons (nCT) transferred from the dye to TiO2 during the formation of dye–TiO2 complexes, the charge decomposition analysis (CDA) was performed by means of Multiwfn software.49 In order to get the average dye electrostatic potential, the atomic charge distributions were calculated using the Merz–Kollman method50,51 and the corresponding computational details as well as CDA are described in the ESI.† In addition, the solvent effect of tetrahydrofuran (TMF) was taken into account based on the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM).52
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Molecular structures
Functionalization of the porphyrin core with the bulky bis(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amine donor, the ethyne, the BTD unit and benzoic acid yielded the dye SM315.10 Considering that long alkyl chains in SM315 have negligible influence on photovoltaic properties of dyes, the donor in the dye SM315 was replaced by bis(2′,4′-dimethoxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)amine (D1), which combined with the ethyne, the BTD unit (B1) and benzoic acid as simplified SM315. As the introduction of POMs into organic dyes can red-shift the absorption spectra,29 dye 1 is designed by adding Lindqvist-type POM ([Mo6O19]2−) as the electron-withdrawing group into simplified SM315. Based on dye 1, dyes 2 and 3 are constructed by introducing triphenylamine (D2) and 3-ethynyl-7-(4-methoxyphenyl)-10-methyl-10,10a-dihydro-4aH-phenothiazine (D3) as electron donors. In order to investigate the influence of π-linkers on the overall performance of DSSCs, dyes 4 and 5 are designed by replacing the BTD group in dye 3 with π-linkers benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-2,6-dione (B2) and pyrrolo[2,3-f]indole-2,6(1H,5H)-dione (B3), respectively. The molecular structures of simplified SM315 and dyes 1–5 are displayed in Fig. 2.

3.2. Electronic structures
As the intrinsic electronic structures determine the extrinsic properties of dyes, the FMO energy levels of SM315 and dyes 1–5 are analyzed to gain a deeper insight into electronic properties. In n-type DSSCs, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of dyes should be higher than the CB edge energy of TiO2 (−4.00 eV), ensuring an adequate electron injection driving force between excited dyes and TiO2, while the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of dyes should be lower than the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte redox potential (−5.06 eV),53 guaranteeing that the dyes can be efficiently regenerated. As shown in Fig. 3, the LUMO energy levels of all studied dyes are more positive compared with the CB edge energy of TiO2, while the HOMO energy levels are more negative than the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox potential, showing that the energy levels of studied dyes match the requirements of n-type DSSCs.

From the view of electron density distributions, the distinct charge separated states between the HOMO and LUMO are beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) upon photoexcitation. The FMO distributions of SM315 and dyes 1–5 are drawn in Fig. 4. The HOMOs for studied dyes mainly delocalize over the donor groups and the porphyrin ring, while the distributions of LUMOs are very different. The LUMO of SM315 distributes on the porphyrin ring, BTD and extends to the carboxyl groups. The LUMO localizes on POM for dye 2, and spreads over the POM and BTD group for dye 1, while the LUMO of dye 3 localizes on porphyrin ring besides POM and BTD groups. For dyes 4 and 5, the LUMOs mainly delocalize over the POMs, π-linkers and extend to carboxyl groups, facilitating an efficient electron injection into the CB of the semiconductor (TiO2). The HOMO energy levels of dyes 1–5 are similar, while the LUMO energy level decreases in the following order: dye 2 (−1.83 eV) > dye 1 (−1.88 eV) > dye 3 (−1.96 eV), and further decreases from dye 3 (−1.96 eV) to 4 (−2.64 eV) and 5 (−2.39 eV).
 Fig. 4  Frontier molecular orbital distributions of studied dyes. 
The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO (H–L) affects the optical properties of the dyes. Usually, the smaller H–L gap means that lower energy is needed for the dye excitation. The H–L gap of dye 1 is 3.66 eV, which is smaller than that of SM315 (3.83 eV), indicating that the introduction of POM is beneficial to red-shift the absorption spectra. Dye 3 has the highest HOMO and lowest LUMO energy levels among dyes 1–3, which result in the smallest H–L gap (3.52 eV). Furthermore, dyes 4 and 5 have smaller H–L gaps (2.88 eV and 3.10 eV) than dye 3 by replacing BTD in dye 3 with B2 and B3 as π-linkers, respectively.
3.3. Absorption spectra
Considering that the light absorption property of a dye is a crucial factor affecting the performance of DSSCs, it is significant to simulate the absorption spectra of dyes. There is no doubt that dyes with high conversion efficiencies must possess large photocurrent response, and the absorption spectra of dyes well overlap with the solar spectra. The excitation energies (EV), maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax), oscillator strengths (f) and major electronic compositions are listed in Table 1, and the simulated UV-vis absorption spectra of studied dyes are illustrated in Fig. 5. Comparing with SM315, the Soret band of dye 1 slightly blue-shifts and the Q band significantly red-shifts, and dye 1 shows stronger light absorption ability, confirming that the introduction of POM can contribute to harvesting sunlight.

 Fig. 5  Simulated absorption spectra of studied dyes. 
The absorption wavelengths (440 nm) in Soret bands for dyes 1–3 with different donor groups are the same, which is mainly attributed to the H–3 → L+1 transitions. There is a remarkable difference of absorption in Q bands, that is, λmax values in Q bands increase in the following order: dye 2 (666 nm) < dye 1 (681 nm) < dye 3 (709 nm), which mainly correspond to the H → L transition. In addition, the oscillator strengths in the Soret band or Q band increase in the following order: dye 1 < dye 2 < dye 3. Among dyes 1–3, the absorption ability of dye 3 is stronger, which is in well agreement with the “electronic structures” discussed above, and D3 is efficient as an electron donor for highly efficient dyes. Compared to dye 3, the λmax in Soret bands of dyes 4 and 5 with the primary H−1 → L+7 transition are blue-shifted, while the λmax in Q bands are red-shifted by 12 nm and 8 nm, which are dominantly associated with the H → L+1 transition. In order to further investigate the CT characteristics, the electron density difference maps (EDDMs) between the ground state and the first excited state of studied dyes are displayed in Fig. 6, in which the blue and purple regions represent the electron density depletion and increment, respectively. It can be seen that the Q absorption band of SM315 is attributed to ICT from a small part of D1 donor group and Zn–porphyrin to BTD, while the ICT of dyes 1–5 can be ascribed to a small part of donor groups and Zn–porphyrin to the POMs and small part of π-linkers.

3.4. Intramolecular charge transfer analysis
Effective charge transfer character of a dye is one of the most important factors to obtain high conversion efficiency, which is originated from the ICT process upon photo excitation. The heat maps of SM315 and dyes 1–5 are depicted in Fig. 7 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), respectively. For SM315, it can be seen that the holes mainly localize on D1 and Zn–porphyrin groups, while the electrons mainly distribute on Zn–porphyrin and BTD. The CT originates from D1 and Zn–porphyrin to BTD due to less contribution of Zn–porphyrin for the electrons than holes. For dyes 1–5, the CT originates from donor groups and Zn–porphyrin to POM clusters. In addition, the centroids of charge for SM315 and dyes 1–5 are shown in Fig. 6, in which the purple and yellow zones correspond to the electron density depletion and enhancement zones, respectively, and the analysis of intramolecular CT agrees well with the discussion above.
 Fig. 7  The heat map of SM315. 
The CT parameters of studied dyes including qCT and dCT are given in Fig. 8. The qCT and dCT of dye 1 are 0.56 e− and 2.32 Å, which are larger than those of SM315 (0.47 e− and 2.10 Å), confirming that the introduction of POM not only benfits light absorption, but also improves the CT process. For dyes 1–5, the qCT values are around 0.55 e−, while the dCT values are different. Compared to dye 1, dyes 2 and 3 possess slightly smaller dCT while dyes 4 and 5 have larger dCT. The apparent charge separation in dyes 4 and 5 are beneficial to the interfacial electron injection from dyes to TiO2 and the impediment of electrons and holes recombination. Hence, π-linkers in POM-based porphyrin dyes affect CT abilities. Among dyes 1–5, dye 4 could lead to the most effective ICT due to the largest qCT (0.57 e−) and dCT (2.66 Å).

3.5. Factors influencing JSC
It is known that large LHE and ΔGinj can guarantee a high JSC according to the discussion in “computation details” part. The LHE curves of dyes are plotted in Fig. 9. Compared to SM315, the curves of dyes 1–5 are significantly broadened, so the dyes 1–5 are expected to have higher light harvesting abilities. Among dyes 1–3, the curve of dye 3 is the broadest, showing that the donor group D3 is beneficial for light harvesting. Compared to dye 3, the LHE curves of dyes 4 and 5 are broader and dye 4 is suggested to obtain the high light harvesting ability and well match with the solar radiation spectrum. As shown in Table 2, all designed dyes have a larger driving force of electron injection compared to SM315. In addition, all studied dyes have negative ΔGinj, implying that they have enough driving force to inject the electrons from dyes into the surface of TiO2.

When Φinject and ηcollect are assumed to be 1,44 the maximum short circuit densities JmaxSC that reflect the light harvesting abilities of dyes were calculated and are listed in Table 2. The calculated JmaxSC of SM315 is higher than the experimental value (18.10 mA cm−2),10 which results from the overrated Φinject and ηcollect. The JmaxSC of dyes 1–5 are larger than that of SM315, implying that dyes 1–5 possess better light harvesting abilities. In addition, dye 3 has a larger JmaxSC than dyes 1 and 2, and dye 4 with the largest JmaxSC among the studied dyes could perform excellent light harvesting, which is in good agreement with the discussion above.
3.6. Factors influencing VOC
Apart from JSC, VOC is also an important factor for determining the performance of DSSCs. From formula (8), it can be seen that the larger nc and ΔECB are, the larger VOC is, which is conducive to improve the conversion efficiency of DSSCs. nc is affected by the electron recombination process including the recombination between injection electron in TiO2 and oxidized dyes (krec1), and the recombination between the injection electrons with the redox couple in the electrolyte (krec2), which provide a means of the excited state deactivation, resulting in the decreased nc, and thus the decreased VOC. As all studied dyes have similar structures and same experimental conditions in the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple, they have similar krec2, we mainly discuss the extent of krec1 as follow:

k
rec1 is determined by the distance (r) between the hole of a dye and the semiconductor surface, and the larger r is, the lower krec1 is.54 The r is obtained by the product of the contribution of each atom to the HOMO (cation hole as discussed by Durrant et al.) and the corresponding distance from the semiconductor surface (titanium atom of the semiconductor surface). As shown in Fig. 10, the r of dye 1 (22.43 Å) is larger than that of SM315 (15.20 Å) due to the introduction of POM. The r in dye 3 is largest among dyes 1–3, while r in dyes 3–5 are in the order of, dye 3 (23.04 Å) < dye 4 (23.59 Å) < dye 5 (23.70 Å). Therefore, dye 5 has the largest nc due to the largest r.

In order to determine the absorption effects of dyes on ΔECB, the structures of dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface were analyzed which are displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†). According to the strategy proposed by De Angelis and co-workers,55 the ΔECB was obtained by calculating the DOS profiles of pure TiO2 and PDOS profiles of TiO2 in the dye–TiO2 complexes as shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the corresponding values are listed in Table 2. It can be found that the absorptions of different dyes could induce different extent of shifts of the CB and ΔECB change in a small range of 0.138 eV to 0.155 eV for dyes 1–5, which are much larger than that of SM315 (0.052 eV). At the same time, dyes 1, 2, 4 and 5 have the superior ΔECB and dye 5 has the largest one. How does the molecular structure of the dye affect ΔECB? Two effects have been taken into account to shed light on the intrinsic relationship between the molecular structures of dyes and ΔECB.55 One is the charge transfer effect attributed to the dye–TiO2 bond formation, and the other is the electrostatic effect owing to the dye dipole moment. Both effects can change the position of the TiO2 CB and therefore affect ΔECB. The nCT obtained through CDA and VEL are shown in Fig. 12, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S2 (for details about nCT and VEL analysis see the ESI†). The results indicate that lower ΔECB for the molecular adsorption of SM315 relative to others is caused by the smaller nCT and VEL, and the similar nCT combined with the similar VEL of dyes 1–5 lead to the similar ΔECB. By analyzing the VEL, nCT and ΔECB of dyes 3–5, it seems that the charge transfer effect plays a more important role on ΔECB, thus leading to the increased ΔECB for dyes 4 and 5. In short, dyes 4 and 5 can obtain the superior VOC due to the larger nc combined with the larger ΔECB, and dye 5 might perform best on VOC with largest values for both.

4. Conclusions
A series of dyes derived from the champion dye SM315 were comprehensively investigated with DFT and TD-DFT methods to evaluate the effects of electron donors and π-linkers on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. After confirming that all studied dyes have suitable energy levels matched to the semiconductor by analyzing the electronic structures, the key factors affecting the conversion efficiencies of DSSCs are discussed including absorption spectra, ICT characters, JSC and VOC. Compared to SM315, dye 1 not only has stronger and broader absorption spectra and larger ICT parameters, but also has a larger JSC governed by the LHE curve and ΔGinj, and a larger VOC connected with nc and ΔECB, which can facilitate to improve the performance of DSSCs due to the introduction of POM. Dye 3 has the broadest absorption spectra and LHE curve, largest JmaxSCand r among dyes 1–3, showing that D3 in dye 3 is a promising donor group, and these values are further improved in dyes 4 and 5 by changing the BTD π-linker in dye 3. In addition, dye 4 might perform better on JSC owing to its broader absorption spectra and LHE curve, larger ICT ability and JmaxSC, and dye 5 might perform better on VOC because of the larger r and ΔECB. Hence, it is possible to obtain highly effective Zn–porphyrin dyes with improved VOC and JSC by modifying donor and π-linker groups.
