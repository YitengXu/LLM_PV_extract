    , Accepted 8th June 2020First published on 8th June 2020AbstractAlgae are becoming increasingly popular as feedstocks for various fine chemicals and fuel intermediates. Cultivation of algae can be environment-friendly as they can fix high amounts of carbon dioxide in the environment, and also remove hazardous pollutants from wastewater. Moreover, algae cultivation presents a high per-hectare oil yield and faster growth rates than terrestrial biomasses. Owing to these advantages, algae are attractive candidates for harnessing energy. Thermochemical conversion techniques are promising as they offer a single-step conversion of algae species into valuable chemicals. In this article, pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction technologies for the conversion of a variety of microalgae and macroalgae to bio-oil and biochemicals are discussed comprehensively. Different pyrolysis strategies such as fast pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, microwave-assisted pyrolysis, and hydropyrolysis for the production of bio-oil of varying properties are outlined. The effect of catalysts in upgrading the quality of the bio-oil is evaluated. On the hydrothermal liquefaction front, the effects of operating parameters such as temperature, time, pressure, and solvent on the yields of products and the quality of bio-crude are covered in detail. Due emphasis is given to the kinetics of pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction of algae, and different types of models, viz., apparent kinetics and lumped semi-detailed models, are discussed. The complex conversion pathways involved in these two processes are unraveled by presenting plausible reaction mechanisms and discussing the fate of nitrogen present in the algae. Furthermore, this review throws light on various aspects ranging from algae cultivation, the effect of culture conditions on the biochemical composition of algae species to techno-economic and lifecycle assessment of biofuels and chemicals derived from algae via thermochemical technologies. Finally, the challenges involved in the scale-up of thermochemical technologies and the development of detailed kinetic models are presented.
1. Introduction
The world's population is expected to register a 29% increase to reach 9.9 billion by 2050.1 The United States Energy Information Administration projected a 28% increase in the consumption of energy to meet the energy demands of this ever-growing population between 2015 and 2040.2 According to the Global Energy and CO2 Status Report (2017) by the International Energy Agency, more than 70% of the total global energy demand was satisfied by the utilization of oil, natural gas and coal.3 Due to the increase in fossil fuel usage, the global CO2 emissions increased by 1.4% in 2017.3 The current trends in carbon emissions indicate that the measures taken to control climate change via controlling carbon emissions are not sufficient. Considering this, there is a strong need to reduce our dependency on conventional energy sources.
Petroleum is the feedstock of choice for not only the production of transportation fuels, but also a wide variety of performance and functional polymers and chemicals. Therefore, it is imperative to explore possible routes to produce these polymers and chemicals via green and sustainable routes. The rise in the emission of greenhouse gases has led to global warming and disturbing climate changes. The declining fossil fuel reserves and fluctuating petroleum prices drive researchers worldwide to search for clean, renewable and sustainable alternatives to conventional fossil fuels.
According to the International Energy Outlook (2017), the consumption of non-fossil fuels such as renewables and nuclear is expected to grow rapidly compared to fossil fuels.2 Among all sources of energy, the consumption of renewable sources has continuously increased from 35 quadrillion (q) BTU (in 1990) to 70 q BTU (in 2015), and this is further expected to grow annually at 2.3% to 130 q BTU (in 2040).2 Utilization of biomass as a renewable energy source has certainly given a thrust to this projected consumption pattern. Biomass refers to biological matter, which includes crops, forestry products, and marine products. Biomasses grow via photosynthesis where sunlight and CO2 are utilized to store energy in the form of complex chemical compounds such as carbohydrates and fatty acids.
Wu and co-workers4 reported biomass as the fourth largest source of primary energy in the world. Owing to the carbon neutrality and abundance of biomass, it is considered as one of the most potential replacements for fossil fuels. Burning biomass is the most primitive way of obtaining energy, while it can also be converted to biofuels and biogas, which can be seamlessly blended with conventional petroleum fuels and compressed natural gas. Biomass can also serve as a feedstock to produce valuable chemicals and polymers.5 Presently, in India, 32% of the primary energy is provided by biomass.6 In 2017, 5% of the total primary energy utilization in the USA was met by biomass-derived fuels. Out of the total biofuel utilization, 47% was bioethanol, wood and derived biofuels comprised 44%, and the remaining was from municipal solid waste.2
Biofuels from biomass are classified as first- and second-generation biofuels. The first-generation biofuels, such as bioethanol and biodiesel, were produced from edible crops such as sugarcane, corn, and vegetable oils, which triggered the food versus fuel debate. Bioethanol produced from non-edible energy crops such as switchgrass, miscanthus, agri-residues, forestry wastes, and municipal solid wastes belongs to the second generation. Similarly, biodiesel generated from energy crops and non-edible oil seeds such as jatropha, pongamia, rapeseed and waste cooking oil via the transesterification process belongs to the second generation.
The escalation in the production of second-generation biofuels from energy crops has led to the proportional requirement of land for their growth. Malins7 reported the consequences of biofuel production and consumption on the food market. This comprehensive report concluded that the utilization of crops for biodiesel and biofuel production contribute to the inflation in food prices. Araújo et al.8 also assessed the difficulties in the development of sustainable biofuel technologies in the light of technical, policy, and investment aspects. The current trend is towards the production of third-generation biofuels, which are derived from marine biomass, such as microalgae and macroalgae. These biomasses can be grown in open or raceway ponds and oceans, and do not require land, which otherwise can be used for the cultivation of food crops.
This review provides an overview of the types of algae, their composition, cultivation methods, conventional processing techniques and applications. More importantly, a comprehensive understanding of the two major thermochemical technologies, viz., pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction, for the conversion of both microalgae and macroalgae to chemicals and fuel molecules is provided. The key differentiating topics covered in this review compared to other reviews in the subject include the following:
(a) Conversion pathways of various biochemical components present in algae during pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction processes to produce various organic compounds.
(b) Kinetics of slow and fast pyrolysis of algae focusing on different types of models including global kinetics, semi-detailed/lumped kinetics, and distributed activation energy models.
(c) Kinetics of hydrothermal liquefaction of algae, and the effect of process conditions on product yield and quality.
1.1. Lignocellulosic biomass vs. algae biomass
Lignocellulosic biomass consists mainly of three natural polymers, viz., cellulose (30–60 wt%), hemicellulose (15–40 wt%) and lignin (15–30 wt%).9 All these polymers organize themselves forming different structures and compositions which would result in a variety of biomasses. Cellulose is a semi-crystalline linear polymer made up of repeating units of glucose linked by β-1,4-glycosidic linkage. The monomeric unit of cellulose is cellobiose, a disaccharide. The structure involves extensive intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bond networks strongly binding the glucose units. The next abundant component in lignocellulosic biomass is hemicellulose. It is a branched polymer made up of pentose and hexose sugars with a random structure, and amorphous nature. The third component, lignin, is a complex, branched and crosslinked polymer containing p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols as repeating units which are linked by a variety of ether, ester and C–C bonds. Lignin–carbohydrate linkages bind the three components of lignocellulosic biomass. Besides, lignocellulosic biomass contains inorganic ash, and a minor amount of extractives like oils, fats, and pectins that are usually soluble in organic solvents. Isikgor and Becer10 reviewed the potential of lignocellulosic biomass to produce sustainable bio-based chemicals and polymers. Lignocellulosic biomass to fuel and chemical technologies involve the integration of various pre-treatment techniques with conversion processes.10
Addressing the food versus fuel debate, marine biomass, commonly known as algae, is an attractive renewable energy source. Algae are plant-like species, which grow via photosynthesis in water, without the requirement of any arable land. Their growth rate is faster than lignocellulosic biomass as they do not have to distribute energy to grow structures like leaves, stems, and roots. Marine biomasses present advantages over lignocellulosic biomass in terms of both the growth rate and high oil yield per unit area.11 This makes them a promising source of sustainable green energy. For the cultivation of certain microalgae species, around 2 kg of CO2 per kg of microalgae is sequestered from the atmosphere.12 Moreover, extreme ecological conditions along with water quality do not constrain their growth.13 Algae species are responsible for more than half of the photosynthetic activities on earth and are underutilized for value recovery. With all these advantages, marine biomasses are considered as potential candidates to produce biofuels and chemicals. Algae species are composed of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates along with pigments such as chlorophyll present in their matrix.
Generally, algae species are classified on the basis of (a) pigments used for photosynthesis, (b) construction of their cell walls, and (c) types of carbohydrates and lipids they use to store their energy. Accordingly, algae are classified into:14Cyanophyceae (cyanobacteria), Chlorophyceae (green algae), Bacillariophyceae (diatoms), Xanthophyceae (yellow-green algae), Chrysophyceae (golden algae), Rhodophyceae (red algae), Phaeophyceae (brown algae), Dinophyceae (dinoflagellates), Prasinophyceae and Eustigmatophyceae (pico-plankton). Algae species consist of eukaryotic cells with nuclei and organelles along with plastids and chlorophyll for photosynthesis. The common classification prevalent in the literature, viz., micro- and macroalgae, is discussed in the following section.
1.2. Macroalgae and microalgae
Macroalgae, as the name suggests, are large (few meters long) aquatic plants, also known as seaweeds. At the cell level, these are multi-cellular species, and are broadly classified into red, green, and brown types.15 Generally, the cell size of macroalgae is of the order of 102 μm. CO2 and sunlight are utilized for photosynthesis to store energy in the form of various carbohydrates. Fig. 1 shows the types of macroalgae, and the basic differences among them. The structure of macroalgae species consists of Thallus, Blades, Floats, Stipe, Holdfast, and Frond.16 Sudhakar et al.16 presented macroalgae biomass as a potentially renewable resource. As shown in Fig. 1, the macroalgae species are rich in carbohydrates and have low lipid and protein content.
 Fig. 1  Types of macroalgae species. 
Microalgae are microscopic strains that float in water, owing to their high lipid content. At the cellular level, microalgae are unicellular with cell diameters lesser than 20 μm. Similar to macroalgae, they also grow via photosynthesis but their growth cycle is different. This can be understood by the fact that microalgae accumulate lipids to store energy. Owing to their composition and availability, Oncel17 explained the viability of microalgae as a fuel and chemical source on a macro level by considering the economics. It is reported that 92% of the fuel consumers showed interest in using algae-derived biodiesel in their vehicles instead of fossil-based fuels.17
The production costs associated with macroalgae are low as compared to those of microalgae. The protein content is also a distinctive characteristic. Microalgae have high protein content, while macroalgae have low protein content but a high amount of carbohydrates. The significant variation in the chemical and biochemical compositions of microalgae and macroalgae species can be understood from Tables 1 (ref. 18–38) and 2 (ref. 39–41). Generally, the ash content in microalgae is low as compared to that in macroalgae owing to high mineral accumulation in the latter. In terms of the biochemical components, microalgae contain high amount of proteins, which is reflected in the high elemental nitrogen content. Many macroalgae species contain high amount of carbohydrates, which is reflected in their higher oxygen content. The high sulfur content in certain macroalgae species such as Kappaphycus alvarezii is attributed to the presence of carrageenan, a sulphated polysaccharide extracted from red edible seaweeds.40 The components present in these species make marine biomass an attractive choice for their conversion to biochemicals and fuel molecules.

1.3. Algae cultivation
The first benefit of algae cultivation is CO2 sequestration from the environment. In recent years, algae cultivation has emerged as an option to treat polluted wastewaters. This approach yields three benefits, viz., CO2 mitigation from the environment, wastewater treatment by removal of pollutants, and simultaneous accumulation of biomass. The accumulated biomass is harvested and then converted to valuable products using various techniques. A few species, such as Calothrix, Sargassum cymosum, and Scenedesmus quadricauda, both micro- and macroalgae, are cultivated specifically for water treatment. Subhashchandrabose et al.42 and Lindemann et al.43 assessed the potential of algae culture in a bacteria-rich medium. Their studies revealed that algae growth is promoted when they are cultivated along with bacteria. This system of algae cultivation is also known as algae–bacteria consortium, which is primarily used for wastewater treatment. Algae, being carbon-rich, serves as a nutrient for bacteria to grow. The co-existence of both aids in the growth of each other. Basically, CO2 from the respiration of bacteria and oxygen from algae photosynthesis are exchanged. Gonçalves et al.44 reviewed the extensive usage of microalgae–bacteria consortia, and presented the advantages such as: (i) low-cost, (ii) enhanced proximity for CO2 and O2 exchange, (iii) increased levels of biomass and lipid accumulation, and (iv) easy harvesting. These consortia with Chlorella sp., Scenedesmus sp., Chlamydomonas sp., and Stichococcus sp. were used to treat synthetic wastewater,45 anaerobically digested swine manure46 and municipal wastewater.47 Various species of microalgae and macroalgae are cultivated to treat different wastewaters. Table 3 (ref. 48–55) presents algae species used to treat wastewaters from various sources. It is important to mention that macroalgae species and algae–bacteria consortia are used to remove heavy metals from water.

Continuous production of algae is important from the viewpoint of commercial production in an energy- and cost-efficient manner. The most preferred and cost-effective cultivation method is phototropic cultivation where sunlight is used directly. For phototropic algae cultivation, open ponds and closed photobioreactors are the preferred systems. The low operating costs and simple operations make open pond cultivation systems a preferred choice. However, there are limitations with the open culture, which include contamination, low productivity, and difficulties in scaling-up the process. Controlling the culture conditions is also a challenge in these reactors. Closed-photobioreactors address these limitations ensuring that the algae species grow under optimal conditions resulting in high biomass accumulation. As the reactors are closed and culture conditions are strictly controlled, contamination is minimized.
Closed photobioreactors are mainly employed for the cultivation of single type of microalgae species. Owing to the large size of macroalgae species, they cannot be cultivated in closed photobioreactors. Photobioreactors are of different configurations such as serpentine tube, flat-plate, bubble column, airlift column and stirred tank.56 Tubular photobioreactors can involve a combination of straight, coiled or looped transparent tubes. A pump is used to circulate algae through the tubes. In flat plate bioreactors, algae are cultivated in flat plates with irradiation falling on one end. They are essentially of two types, viz., horizontal and vertical flat plates. Mass production of microalgae is done using these photobioreactors in outdoor and indoor culture systems. The advantages offered by flat plate photobioreactors include high illumination surface area and low accumulation of dissolved oxygen as compared to horizontal tubular photobioreactors. Airlift and bubble column photobioreactors use pneumatically agitated bubble columns and airlift devices. The pneumatic agitation aids in achieving high mass transfer rates during cultivation for enhanced production of microalgae. Stirred tank reactors are used for the photoautotrophic growth of microalgae using artificial light sources or direct sunlight. A detailed discussion of reactor types is beyond the scope of this article. The interested reader can refer to the critical review article on reactor design for algae cultivation by Xu et al.56
From the perspective of energy consumption, life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on algae cultivation using closed photobioreactors and open reactors reveal that closed photobioreactors consume 350% more energy than the raceway pond.57,58 This is attributed to the use of high-power pumps that aid in mixing and attainment of the optimum gas–liquid transfer rate. Both open pond and closed ponds have their own advantages and disadvantages. Considering the advantages offered by both systems, an integrated approach involving a hybrid cultivation system was designed. In a hybrid system, both the closed photobioreactor and open pond are integrated so that the controlled cultivation conditions are obtained with concomitant enhancement of lipid productivity. Brennan and Owende59 recommended the use of a hybrid system for the cultivation of microalgae species for the purpose of biofuel production. In an LCA study by Sills et al.60 the use of hybrid cultivation system resulted in a net positive energy gain. The integration of air-lift tubular photobioreactor (first stage) with raceway pond (second stage) to produce algae biodiesel saved fossil energy requirement by 38%, and decreased the global warming potential by 42% as compared to fossil fuels.61
In general, microalgae are believed to be sensitive to culture conditions and require significant attention during their cultivation, whereas macroalgae are aquatic plants, and grow on their own. The effects of culture conditions on the chemical and biochemical compositions of microalgae are quite pronounced. The operating parameters such as temperature, light, pH, salinity of the culture, and nutrients can affect the growth and biochemical composition of microalgae. Juneja et al.62 reviewed the effect of various environmental factors and the availability of nutrients on the biochemical composition of microalgae for biofuel production. Temperature is considered as an important factor, which affects the strain growth rate, strain size, and biochemical composition. It is important to study the behavior of algae culture at different temperatures for biofuel production. As algae multiply their cells via photosynthesis, the light intensity is an important factor to be considered during cultivation. For example, high intensity above the saturation limit would result in photoinhibition owing to the breakage of the chloroplast lamellae and inactivation of the CO2 fixation enzymes. The pH of the culture is responsible for the solubility of CO2 and critical nutrients, and any variation in pH affects the metabolism of the algae. Table 4 (ref. 63–75) summarizes the effect of operating parameters on the biochemical composition of microalgae.

The increase in NaCl concentration from 0.4 to 4 M enhanced the amount of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in microalga, Dunaliella sp.76 Even a slight concentration change from 0.5 to 1 M increased the intracellular lipids and triglycerides in Dunaliella tertiolecta from 60 to 67%, and 40 to 56%, respectively.77 It can be inferred that salinity, up to a saturation level, would increase the fatty acid concentration of microalgae species. The nutrients play an important role in the accumulation of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. For the metabolism of algal cells, nitrogen and phosphorus are important nutrients. Nitrogen in microalgae exists in the form of proteins and nucleic acids, and phosphorus is present in the backbone of DNA and RNA, and in phospholipids.
Microalgae are organic, and hence, contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The supplied carbon is in the form of CO2, bicarbonates, and carbonates, which are utilized for growth during photosynthesis. It is important to mention that an inorganic carbon source is required for photosynthesis. For autotrophic growth, carbon in the form of CO2, bicarbonates, and carbonates is utilized, whereas, for heterotrophic growth, carbon is utilized in the form of acetate and glucose. In addition to the above nutrients, metals are present in trace amounts, and they are essential for the growth of algae during culture. Bruland et al.78 showed that iron, manganese, cobalt, zinc, copper, and nickel are important metals for the metabolism in algae cells. Metals such as Cd, Pb and Cr pose negative effects on the growth of microalgae cells.79
1.4. Uses of algae other than biofuels
Even before the term biofuel was coined, there is evidence of algae species being used as food and medicine 14000 years ago.80 Transparency Market Research predicted the algae market to expand at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.4% to USD 1.1 billion by 2024, with North America being the leader in production.81 The Annual Economic Report on the EU Blue Economy mentions that the algae biomass sector in the European Union is employing around 14000 people with a value of EUR 1.69 billion. This number covers research and development, manufacture of required equipment and supply chain management.82
Both macroalgae and microalgae are widely used in food supplements. Microalgae species such as Chlorella sp., Dunaliella sp., and Spirulina sp. are used as nutritional supplements as they have vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and other pigments along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates.83 Kay83 reviewed the use of microalgae as a food supplement owing to their potent probiotic properties. Macroalgae species serve as a food source not only for humans but also for animals and fish. These species are rich in essential amino acids, carotenoids and polyunsaturated fatty acids.84
Owing to the presence of minerals and its antioxidant properties, the ingestion of algae treats malnutrition and deficiencies. Sometimes, algae can be consumed directly, or compounds extracted from them have significant pharmaceutical applications. It is worthwhile to mention that algae species with antiproliferative properties are used in the formulation of medicines to treat cancer.85 A chemical, galactan sulphate, obtained from Agardhiella tenera is used in medicines to treat AIDS.86 Antidiabetic activities were observed in the chemical compounds obtained from Asparagopsis taxiformis and Avrainvillea nigricans.85,87 Anis et al.88 presented a variety of macroalgae species with medicinal effects such as anti-herpes, antibacterial, anticoagulant, anti-obesity, antiallergic, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory.
The presence of specific antioxidant compounds makes algae a promising choice for cosmetic applications. The cosmetics market is growing with the growing population. This has led to an increase in the requirement of natural and environmentally sustainable and friendly products. The extract of seaweed, Alaria esculenta, was found to possess anti-aging property.89 Fucoxanthin, obtained from Laminaria japonica, is reported to impart skin whitening effect.90 The presence of polysaccharides in macroalgae, and their ability to retain more moisture has resulted in their use as moisturizing agents. These polysaccharides are a cheap source of hydroxy acids, which are used in commercial moisturizing agents. Interestingly, polysaccharides obtained from Saccharina japonica exhibit better moisturizing effect than hydroxy acids, which makes them a natural choice for skin moisturizers.91 A detailed review by Wang et al.92 focuses on the applications of algae in skincare. To summarize, algae can be used in a variety of applications such as skin anti-aging, skin whitening, anti-microbial, moisturizing, and thickening.
1.5. Algae to biofuel conversion technologies

1.5.1. Conventional technologies. 

Fig. 2 shows the schematic of the conversion of algae to fuels. Initially, biodiesel production from extracted algae lipids was the most sought-after option. Here, algae are dehydrated, and lipids are extracted using mechanical operations. Owing to the thick cell wall of algae, simple extraction processes cannot be employed. During the extraction of the lipids from algal cells, due precision and care should be taken so that other components, viz., proteins, carbohydrates, carotenoids, pigments, and vitamins, are not released from the cells and do not contaminate the lipid fraction. Most common are the solvent-based extraction techniques for lipid extraction, because solvents offer high selectivity and solubility. The solvents include n-hexane, methanol, ethanol, and a mixture of polar and non-polar solvents such as methanol/chloroform and hexane/isopropanol.93 The solvent-extracted lipids can be converted into biodiesel through transesterification.
 Fig. 2  Schematic of conventional algae-to-fuel technology. 
In transesterification, lipids are reacted with short-chain alcohols such as methanol. Generally, alcohol is taken in excess of stoichiometric requirement in order to avoid the backward reaction to form the starting compound. For efficient transesterification, homogeneous as well as heterogeneous catalysts have been used. Homogeneous catalysts include NaOH, KOH, and sodium/potassium methoxide. In one study, lipids extracted from Chlorella vulgaris were transesterified with an alcohol:lipid molar ratio of 14 and 0.42 wt% NaOH as a catalyst for 90 min to produce 90 wt% biodiesel.94 An important variable in choosing the catalysis route is the free fatty acid content in the algae, which is usually high. Homogeneous catalysis is not preferable as free fatty acids react with base catalysts during the reaction to form soap via saponification resulting in low biodiesel yields.95 To address this problem, heterogeneous solid acid catalysts are being used. This offers several advantages such as low cost, a greener process, easy recovery of the catalyst and reusability.96,97 Algae oil extracted from Scenedesmus opoliensis with 29% free fatty acid content was used with the alkylsilylated SO42−/TiO2–ZrO2 catalyst to produce biodiesel.98 The acid-catalysed esterification reduced the acidity of algae oil from 29% to 1%, and subsequent transesterification with KOH resulted in 96 wt% biodiesel yield.98 Nanocatalyst Ca(OCH3)2 (3 wt%) was used with lipids from Nannochloropsis sp. to yield 99 wt% biodiesel within a reaction time of 3 h.99In situ transesterification enables the production of biodiesel in which extraction and transesterification occur in a single step. This was employed by Ehimen et al.95 to obtain 90 wt% biodiesel yield from dried Chlorella sp.
Guldhe et al.100 performed a systematic comparison of biodiesel production from lipids extracted from microalgae, S. obliquus, via heterogeneous catalysis using tungstated zirconia, homogeneous catalysis using sulfuric acid and enzyme catalysis using immobilized Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase. The highest lipid conversion was observed with sulphuric acid (96.9%) as compared to tungstated zirconia (94.6%) and the enzyme catalyst (91.7%). It is worthwhile to mention that the reaction time plays a key role in determining the biodiesel yield, and the aforesaid conversions correspond to 4 h using sulfuric acid, 3 h using tungstated zirconia, and 12 h using the enzyme catalyst. Moreover, the methanol-to-oil molar ratio was 3 with the enzyme catalyst, 12 with tungstated zirconia, and 30 with sulfuric acid. In terms of reusability of the catalyst, both tungstated zirconia and the immobilized enzyme were shown to be reusable for at least 3 cycles, while there is no reuse option when the homogeneous catalyst is used. This shows that a trade-off has to be achieved in a typical transesterification process for optimal utilization of solvent, catalyst and energy to obtain reasonable conversion of oil and yield of bio-diesel in a reasonable period of time. The high solvent concentration requirement and a non-recyclable catalyst can make the process uneconomical and environmentally-unfriendly.


1.5.2. Thermochemical technologies. 
Thermochemical conversion of algae emerged in order to treat the de-oiled sludge from the conventional algae processing units. The de-oiled sludge is basically a mixture of proteins and carbohydrates with a minimum amount of lipids. In the past decade, the thermal conversion of the whole algae, including lipids, is seen as an opportunity to obtain fuel molecules and chemicals. Fig. 3 shows various thermochemical techniques to convert algae. The most researched technologies for the conversion of algae species via thermochemical techniques include pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction. Primarily, the aim was to convert the de-oiled sludge (residue left after extraction of lipids) to maximize resource recovery from algae. These two processes result in the production of liquid bio-oil or bio-crude (rich in valuable chemicals), solid residues and non-condensable gases (rich in syngas).101–103 The focus of this research article is to present the recent advances in pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction of algae along with kinetics in a comprehensive manner.
 Fig. 3  Classification of thermochemical conversion processes for algae. 
Pyrolysis is a single-step process that is widely used for converting lignocellulosic biomass, plastics, algae, and municipal wastes into valuable chemicals and fuel molecules. The thermochemical decomposition of organic matter at moderate temperatures (350–800 °C) in an inert atmosphere is known as pyrolysis. The typical pyrolysis products include solids (char), liquids (pyrolysis oil or bio-oil), and non-condensable gases. As algae are grown in water, the physisorbed moisture content in them is very high (≥50 wt%) after the harvest phase. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a thermochemical deconstruction technique that converts a wet feedstock at relatively low temperatures as compared to pyrolysis (250–350 °C), but at high pressures (120–200 bar). HTL is conducted in sub-critical conditions, in which water behaves like an organic solvent and catalyzes the decomposition of organic matter via acid–base reactions. HTL of microalgae is gaining importance as an alternative to produce valuable chemicals and fuel molecules as it eliminates drying, which is a capital-intensive step.104–106 Exploiting the advantages of minimum feed pretreatment, HTL is being investigated for a wide variety of feedstocks such as lignocellulosic agro-residues, raw primary sewage sludge, sewage sludge from wastewater plants, waste plastics and swine manure.107–109
Zhang et al.110 compared the energy consumption in HTL and fast pyrolysis of 1000 kg of Chlorella with 80 wt% of moisture in it. The energy content of the microalgae was 4000 MJ, and the energy required for drying it before pyrolysis was 4107 MJ with 50% efficiency. To conduct fast pyrolysis, 504 MJ of energy was required at 50% efficiency, which was lower than the energy required to conduct HTL (2776 MJ with 50% efficiency). Overall, fast pyrolysis consumed 1.6 times more energy than the HTL process. The energy recovery in the products from fast pyrolysis and HTL was 78.7% and 89.8%, respectively. From the viewpoint of energy balance, HTL was shown to be better than pyrolysis for processing wet microalgae. However, this is not the sole criterion in choosing a conversion process, as other factors like the quality of the product, ease of operation and technology readiness level do determine process scalability. The energy efficiency of the pyrolysis process can be enhanced by developing the drying process using renewable solar energy.

2. Pyrolysis
The feedstock for pyrolysis is generally a dry solid form of biomass such as lignocellulosic biomass, algal biomass, or any organic feedstock. Fig. 4 depicts the typical yields of products from pyrolysis of wood at different conditions.111 Pyrolysis, besides being a promising thermochemical technique for converting algae into fuels and valuable chemicals, can also be used as an analytical technique to characterize them. Analytical Py-GC/MS (pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer) was used to estimate the biochemical composition of microalgae species by identifying indole, 3-methylcyclopentane-1,2-dione, and heptadecane as the marker compounds for proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, respectively.112 Characterization of algaenan, a biopolymer present in microalgae, was performed using stepwise pyrolysis.113 It was found that the core of algaenan was made of interlinked C32-1,17-alkyldiols.113
 Fig. 4  Product yields (dry basis) from various pyrolysis processes of wood [data is taken from IEA bioenergy: T34:2007:01 (ref. 111)]. 
To develop a fundamental understanding of pyrolysis to produce platform chemicals and fuel intermediates, various analytical techniques have been utilized in the literature. These include Py-GC/MS, LmPy-GC/MS (laser micropyrolysis-GC/MS), TGA (thermogravimetric analysis), and TG-FTIR (thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy).114–117 Moreover, pyrolysis of microalgae has been widely investigated for fuel, valuable chemical and power generation.118–120 Microalgae are complex in terms of their composition. Their pyrolysis results in a variety of compounds, such as hydrocarbons, oxygen- and nitrogen-containing organics and non-condensable gases such as CO2, CO, CH4, H2.121 Addressing these complexities poses a challenge in process equipment design for scaling up microalgae pyrolysis.
Pyrolysis, based on the heating rate and residence time, can be broadly classified as slow, intermediate, and fast pyrolysis. The use of catalyst further leads to the classification of catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis. Catalytic pyrolysis can be classified as in situ and ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis. In the former, the catalyst is mixed along with the feed, while in the latter, pyrolysis vapors are upgraded over the catalyst bed in a separate chamber. Moreover, based on the heating source, classification can be made as follows: conventional pyrolysis, in which heat transfer occurs via conduction, convection and radiation, microwave-assisted pyrolysis, and Curie point pyrolysis. The information of various products obtained during pyrolysis processes helps to decipher the reactions leading to the formation of various chemicals. Fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors are generally employed on a larger scale.
In order to assess the scalability potential of thermochemical conversion technologies, LCA and techno-economic analysis have to be carried out. LCA was carried out for microalgae-derived biofuels from pyrolysis as well as other pathways.122–125 In one of the studies, combustion of microalgae is proposed as the best environmental option due to low greenhouse gas emissions along with better energy performance. The same study also supported the economic feasibility of the scaled-up microalgae pyrolysis process to produce oil.126 The results of the analyses performed for a larger scale process (10000 tons microalgae per year) showed that the scaled-up process is economically viable. Gang et al.127 carried out LCA of Desmodesmus sp. pyrolysis. The energy conversion efficiency index, defined as the ratio of the higher heating value (HHV) of pyrolysis products to energy consumption in the life cycle assessment, was greater than unity, which proved that the pyrolysis process is beneficial. The advancements in the thermochemical conversion techniques leave a big role for LCA of sustainable options. Resource recovery from microalgae has gained importance in the past few years as a potential replacement of fossil-derived chemicals and fuels. The development in research methodologies to derive value from this abundant renewable energy source via thermochemical means can be understood by the exponential increase in publications over the past two decades (Fig. 5).

The liquid bio-oil produced from algae or any lignocellulosic biomass is viscous and acidic, which makes it difficult to be stored and transported. This is attributed to the presence of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing moieties, which also restrict their direct usage in engines. The complex composition of bio-oil opens up an opportunity for catalysis to selectively produce chemicals, and improve the quality in terms of lower acidity, lower oxygen content, optimum viscosity, and higher calorific value.59,128,129 Catalytic pyrolysis and fast pyrolysis of microalgae species are emerging areas with huge potential for producing valuable chemicals.
2.1. Slow pyrolysis
Pyrolysis occurring at low heating rates (5–50 °C min−1) with longer vapor residence time is known as slow pyrolysis. Slow pyrolysis can be performed in fixed bed reactors, and analytically in a TG analyzer.130 The oil yield is usually low from this process owing to the low rate of pyrolysis reactions, and the secondary transformation of the primary pyrolysis vapors, which lead to high production of char and gases.59 In the products, the gaseous fraction has a low heating value, whereas bio-oil has a higher heating value. The char yields, in general, decrease with an increase in temperature.
To assess the potential of microalgae for fuels, TG analysis of microalgae has been performed in various environments to understand the pyrolysis behavior. The TG studies provide a basic idea about the temperature ranges in which the feeds and their biochemical components decompose. The generated TG data can be utilized to determine the apparent kinetic parameters (activation energy and pre-exponential factor) by employing various mathematical models.131–133Fig. 6(a) depicts the mass loss and derivative mass loss profiles of protein, lipid and carbohydrate surrogates, viz., bovine serum albumin, sunflower oil, and potato starch, respectively. Fig. 6(b) depicts the mass loss and derivative mass loss of four different microalgae species which are significantly different in chemical as well as biochemical composition. From Fig. 6(a), it is clear that protein decomposes in a single step, whereas lipid and carbohydrate decompose via three- and two-step mechanism, respectively. The number of peaks in the derivative mass loss curve indicates the number of decomposition steps involved in pyrolysis. The carbohydrate exhibits an early onset (273 °C) of thermal degradation as compared to the lipid, which degrades over a wide temperature range starting from 312 to 503 °C. These observations are evident from the thermogravimetric results reported by Gautam et al.134 It can be seen from Fig. 6(b) that high-protein and low-lipid containing microalgae species such as Chlorella vulgaris and Arthrospira platensis exhibit single-stage decomposition unlike Nannochloropsis oculata and Schizochytrium limacinum, which decompose in multiple steps.135 Lipid-rich species generally exhibit delayed pyrolysis behavior. It can be inferred from this discussion, and various studies that microalgae pyrolysis follows a multi-step degradation mechanism.

Table 5 (ref. 21, 28, 30, 37 and 136) presents the salient results from studies on slow pyrolysis of microalgae. In the table, parameters like the initial sample mass, heating rate, and temperature are represented as m, β, and T, respectively. Yuan and co-workers137 studied the pyrolysis characteristics of lignocellulosic biomass and microalgae in a fixed bed reactor, and compared the pyrolysis behavior using a TGA. High bio-oil yields from microalgae as compared to lignocellulosic biomass were obtained owing to the high inherent oil content in the former. The apparent activation energy of decomposition of Chlorella vulgaris was lower (211.1 kJ mol−1) than that of lignocellulosic biomass (244.3–281.5 kJ mol−1). The peak corresponding to the maximum rate of degradation for microalgae (296 °C) was the lowest among all the biomasses analyzed owing to the catalyzing effect of ash, and the presence of proteins and carbohydrates, which begin to degrade even at low temperatures. The highest bio-oil yield in the fixed bed reactor was obtained for microalgae (32.7 wt%). In general, it can be inferred that microalgae exhibit low thermal decomposition temperature as compared to lignocellulosic biomass, which is well evidenced in the literature.137 Thermal degradation of Micractinium conductrix was studied in a TGA/MS to determine the thermal decomposition regimes and the effect of culture time on products.138 The maximum evolution of H2, C2H6, and CH4 for a low exponential phase was observed in the temperature range of 500–600 °C, whereas the maximum evolution of non-hydrocarbon fragments (H2O, CO2, NH3, and NO2) was observed in the temperature range of 350–400 °C.138Tetraselmis suecica was pyrolyzed in a TGA coupled with an IR (infrared) spectrometer.37 The evolution of nitrogen-containing compounds was registered in the temperature range of 250–350 °C, and lipid-containing functional groups in the range of 400–500 °C.

The kinetics of microalgae pyrolysis is well studied under slow pyrolysis conditions using TGA. TGA coupled to MS and FTIR reveals the products evolving in specific temperature regimes during the pyrolysis of microalgae. Thus, information on thermal degradation kinetics and product evolution can be obtained in tandem. The subsequent sections present the various aspects of pyrolysis including fast pyrolysis, catalytic fast pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, microwave-assisted pyrolysis, hydropyrolysis, and pyrolysis kinetics.
2.2. Fast pyrolysis
Fast pyrolysis occurs at moderate temperatures (400–700 °C) with high heating rates (>1000 °C s−1) and short residence times (5–10 s).139,140 In fast pyrolysis, the secondary reactions like condensation and repolymerization of the primary pyrolysates can be minimized by controlling the vapor residence time. Owing to the short residence time and high heating rate, the overall input energy requirement is low in the fast pyrolysis process, and the bio-oil yield is high.141 The temperature ramp rate affects the yields of fast pyrolysis products, which are solid bio-char, bio-oil, and non-condensable gases. An increase in temperature decreases the char yield but increases the non-condensable gases resulting from cracking of the condensable vapor fraction. Therefore, to perform pyrolysis with maximized liquid yields, there is a strong need to optimize the pyrolysis temperature. Cracking of proteins and lipids results in a variety of functional groups in the pyrolysates. These compounds undergo a variety of reactions such as deamination, amination, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, esterification, aromatization, and cyclization to form platform chemicals.
To understand the fast pyrolysis of microalgae, it is important to understand the fast pyrolysis behavior of the individual components. Wang et al.142 used microalgae model components to understand their pyrolysis behavior. The model compounds chosen were castor oil, soybean, and glucose for lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, respectively.142 The understanding of the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of model compounds was extended to the pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. to track the individual reactions. Maillard reaction products were formed from the interactions between amino groups of proteins and carbonyl groups of carbohydrates.142 The choice of the model compound is a critical aspect, as, in this study, soybean was considered as a protein surrogate despite the presence of lignocellulosic components in it. This study was followed by a study from the same group that isolated proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates from Nannochloropsis sp. to establish the pyrolysis pathways of individual components.143 The glycerin moieties and steroids present in the lipids degraded to form hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids. Deamination, dimerization, and fragmentation of peptide linkages produced nitriles, amines, amides, indoles, and pyrroles. Low molecular weight aldehydes and ketones were produced from the pyrolysis of carbohydrates.143 Gautam and Vinu134 used bovine serum albumin, sunflower oil, and potato starch as surrogates for proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, respectively, to understand the fast pyrolysis behavior of microalgae. Co-pyrolysis of proteins with lipids promoted esterification of carboxylic acids and alcohols, whereas co-pyrolysis of carbohydrates with lipids and proteins promoted the syn-elimination of esters to produce carboxylic acids, and the corresponding alkenes. These arguments were strengthened by Py-FTIR results, i.e., plots presenting the time evolution of pyrolysate functional groups at short residence times of the order of few seconds. The low production of CO2 justified the inhibition of the decarboxylation of carboxylic acids.
Microalgae fast pyrolysis is advantageous as it yields bio-oil with high calorific value, low oxygen content, and high carbon content as compared to lignocellulosic biomass. Table 6 presents a comparison of bio-oil properties from the fast pyrolysis of microalga, Chlorella protothecoides, and various biomasses.144–146 In a first of its kind study, fast pyrolysis kinetics, the time evolution of functional groups and products under fast pyrolysis conditions were presented for four different microalgae species, viz., Arthrospira platensis, Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochloropsis oculata and Schizochytrium limacinum by Gautam et al.135 Interestingly, the nitrogen content in all the four microalgae followed a linear trend with the amount of nitrogen-containing compounds in the pyrolysates. Microalgae accumulate various alkali and alkaline earth metals present in the culture medium. Some of the metals present in algae act as catalysts during pyrolysis. This catalytic effect facilitates the degradation of microalgae by lowering the initial decomposition temperature as compared to lignocellulosic biomass. Pan et al.121 observed similar catalytic effects due to alkali metals present in Nannochloropsis sp. The salient operating conditions and results from the fast pyrolysis of microalgae and their residues are tabulated in Table 7 (ref. 26, 27, 34 and 144). Dunaliella tertiolecta, a microalga commercially cultivated for the production of β-carotene, was pyrolyzed in a laboratory-scale wire mesh reactor.27 The pyrolysis of the defatted microalgae residue was also performed. The maximum liquid yields for microalgae (47%) and its residue (45%) were obtained at 600 °C. As expected, the nitrogen-containing compounds obtained from the pyrolysis of the defatted residue were much higher (39.4%) as compared to those of microalgae (7.2%). This can be attributed to increased nitrogen content in the defatted microalgae residue. Therefore, hydrodenitrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil need to be employed to improve its quality. Fig. 7 depicts various reactions and interconversions of components occurring during the fast pyrolysis of microalgae. Fast pyrolysis biorefineries can be integrated with solar/wind power plants for the economic production of electricity and chemicals in tandem. Perkins147 demonstrated the economic viability of the integration of fast pyrolysis of biomass with solar photovoltaics for the combined production of electricity. In this study, the bio-oil produced from fast pyrolysis of biomass was stored, and electricity was produced by its combustion to supplement the power from the solar photovoltaic unit.147 Similar integration can also be performed for microalgae pyrolysis biorefineries.

 Fig. 7  An overview of various reactions and interconversions during fast pyrolysis of (a) proteins, (b) lipids and (c) carbohydrates. 
The char obtained from the pyrolysis of the microalgae residue can be used for soil amendment. However, the char obtained from microalgae residues qualifies as a better fertilizer for remediation than the char obtained from microalgae pyrolysis owing to the high Ca, Na, K, P and Mg content in the former. The char obtained from fast pyrolysis of microalgae contains monocyclic and polycyclic hydrocarbons including nitrogen-containing heterocyclics. Gautam et al.134 reported the presence of methyl isolysergate (C17H18N2O2) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazine (C18H13N5O6) in the char from fast pyrolysis of mixtures of protein, lipid and carbohydrate surrogates. This shows that nitrogen present in the feedstock is indeed distributed among the product phases.
2.3. Co-pyrolysis of microalgae with other feedstocks
Co-pyrolysis of biomass with polymers and other feedstocks has gained considerable attention in the past decade. Co-pyrolysis of algal biomass with a variety of other feedstocks has been studied in the literature. Co-firing biomass (including microalgal biomass) with coal is one of the most efficient measures to reduce CO2, which eventually decreases the carbon footprint. This is shown to have zero or minimal impact on the overall efficiency during power generation.148 Co-pyrolysis of microalgae with polymers, tires, and biomass results in the production of liquid fuels and power generation. Microalgae addition lowers the initial decomposition temperatures of hard-to-decompose materials. Several studies have shown a positive return on investment for co-pyrolysis units, which yields a profitable business.149 Feeding microalgae as a co-feedstock aided the degradation of coal, textile dyeing sludge (TDS) and sewage sludge.150–152 Generally, bio-oil from algae is rich in oxygen and nitrogen. Therefore, co-processing with hydrogen-rich feedstocks such as polymers results in improving the quality of the bio-oil. Co-pyrolysis of microalgae with polymers, oil-shale, bamboo, and lignocellulosic biomass is projected as a promising way to produce low nitrogen and oxygen-containing bio-oil with high selectivity towards aromatic hydrocarbons and high amount of gases. This also reduces the need for intensive downstream processing of bio-oil.153–159 Significant synergistic effects in terms of degradation temperature range and product yields are observed during co-pyrolysis. Some recent studies on the co-pyrolysis of microalgae with other feedstocks are mentioned in Table 8 (ref. 19, 29, 150, 152–155 and 158).

Most of the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis studies utilize TGA to study the pyrolysis characteristics and apparent kinetic parameters. Apart from kinetics, the role of various interactions in the product distribution is yet to be unraveled and renders a huge scope. Importantly, the application of co-pyrolysis for environmental remediation is looked upon as an important prospect. In order to address the disposal of textile dye effluents, the co-pyrolysis of C. vulgaris with TDS was studied using TG-FTIR.151 The synergism due to the interaction between C. vulgaris and TDS was observed, which led to the inhibition of the formation of sticky bio-oil, and an increase in oil yield. The catalytic role of alkali metals in ash was also deemed to be important. The initial decomposition temperature decreased from 251 to 198 °C with an increase in the TDS content in the mixture from 10 to 90 wt%. The co-pyrolysis effectiveness index S (S = total desired products/total undesired products) was 0.57 for a C. vulgaris:TDS mass ratio of 0.8 with the lowest average activation energy of degradation (383.3 kJ mol−1). This study projected co-pyrolysis as a promising technology to facilitate the degradation of textile dye sludge by microalgae.
Zhao et al.22 proposed a three-dimensional diffusion mechanism for the co-pyrolysis of Isochrysis (I) and Chlorella (C). The effects of interactions were studied using TGA and a fixed bed reactor. Kinetic analysis was performed using the Lorentzian fitting and multi-heating rate method. The apparent activation energies of individual pyrolysis of algae and co-pyrolysis of the algae were in the range of 74.5–210.7 kJ mol−1. The decrease in the apparent activation energies during co-pyrolysis was in the range of 6.3–23.7 kJ mol−1 (for I:C = 2:1), 9.9–22.6 kJ mol−1 (for I:C = 1:1) and 7.13–20.23 kJ mol−1 (for I:C = 1:2). The bio-oil yield from co-pyrolysis was in the range of 42–44% at 475 °C. Co-pyrolysis increased the yield of amines, amides, phenols, and esters in the bio-oil with fewer carboxylic acids. The co-pyrolysis experiments assisted in choosing the right mix of the two species to obtain high selectivity to valuable compounds.
Fast co-pyrolysis is also a promising option to produce value-added chemicals. Fast co-pyrolysis of cellulose with polypropylene was studied to understand the feasibility of lignocellulosic biomass with polymers for energy densification via Py-GC/MS, Py-FTIR, and DFT calculations.160,161 These studies have certainly given a thrust to pyrolyze hydrogen-rich feedstocks with nitrogen-rich microalgae. Fast co-pyrolysis can produce an improved quality of vapors, which can be further catalytically processed to produce drop-in biofuels. Qi et al.154 investigated the effect of HZSM-5 on co-pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. and polypropylene, and observed a very high amount of monoaromatic hydrocarbons in the oil fraction (93%). The catalytic effect of oil shale on microalgae pyrolysis was investigated.159 It was observed that 3% of oil shale with microalgae decreased the formation of oxygenates and significantly increased the formation of monoaromatic hydrocarbons (35%), while simultaneously inhibiting the formation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Utilization of two feedstocks can reduce the reliance on a single feedstock in addition to being beneficial to improve the quality of the products.
However, the development of downstream technologies to transform pyrolytic oil as a potential alternative to conventional fossil-derived fuels is needed. A more important challenge to be addressed is the effective separation of the various bio-oil components if the selective production of biochemicals is the objective.
2.4. Catalytic pyrolysis of algae
In order to treat a wide variety of wastes, about four decades ago, the use of char in fast pyrolysis was found to impart a catalytic effect, and this was patented by Garrett and Mallan.162 Char is a superior material for heating as compared to hot gas, which is due to its high heat capacity. Catalytic pyrolysis of biomass has been prevalent to improve the quality of bio-oil in terms of the H/C ratio and other critical parameters. This was comprehensively reviewed by Bridgwater.163 The industrial viability of catalytic pyrolysis, and the use of various catalysts for biomass, polymers, and biopolymers such as algae have been reviewed by Zhang et al.164 Bio-oils obtained from pyrolysis of microalgae contain a variety of oxygen- and nitrogen-based organic compounds such as carboxylic acids, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, pyrroles, indoles, nitriles, and amides. The formation of these functional groups can be attributed to the complex and competitive reactions such as dehydration, decarboxylation, depolymerization, repolymerization, amination, rearrangement, and condensation during fast pyrolysis.129 The high acidity, high viscosity, and low stability of bio-oil restrict its direct use as a drop-in fuel. Catalytic pyrolysis is a potential technique to improve the quality of the bio-oil, and for the selective production of valuable chemicals.59,128,129 Catalysts were successfully used with lignocellulosic biomass to selectively produce specialty chemicals, and this was a basis for catalytic pyrolysis of microalgae. Zeolites are the widely studied catalysts for catalytic pyrolysis of microalgae.18,23,38,165 Owing to the minerals present in oil shale, its catalytic effect was also studied for fast pyrolysis of microalgae.57
The studies on fast and slow pyrolysis of algae in different reactors throw light on the effect of operating parameters on the yield and quality of the bio-oil. Aromatic hydrocarbons and heteroatomic aromatic compounds containing nitrogen and oxygen are the major products from catalytic pyrolysis of proteins, whereas catalytic conversion of lipids yields aliphatic hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids. The catalysts impart selectivity towards valuable compounds by promoting various reactions. Catalysis is the key to address the issues associated with pyrolysis oil with high oxygen and nitrogen content.
Hu et al.24 fast pyrolyzed C. vulgaris with activated carbon, ZnCl2, SiC, and MgO as catalysts in a quartz tube reactor to obtain syngas. Activated carbon at 10 wt% loading was found to be the most suitable catalyst for reducing the solid residues to 10.8%, thus resulting in a high yield of gas and liquid (89.2%). SiC and MgO promoted CO production. The use of activated carbon and ZnCl2 reduced CO emission, while promoting H2 formation. The results showed that 3 wt% activated carbon is the optimum catalyst loading to convert C. vulgaris to syngas. The highest calorific value (224.45 ppmv kJ) of gas was obtained with 5 wt% MgO. Catalysts used during fast pyrolysis of C. vulgaris resulted in an enhanced conversion, with a low solid residue yield. Activated carbon was found to be an economically viable catalyst to produce syngas from C. vulgaris.
Nickel–ceria-based catalysts perform well for gasification of lignocellulosic biomass.32,33 Therefore, such catalysts were tested for the pyrolysis of microalgae.32,33 Fast pyrolysis of Tetraselmis and Isochrysis was performed with and without catalysts in a fixed bed reactor at 500 °C.32 In catalytic fast pyrolysis, 30 wt% of catalyst was used. The use of ZrO2-based catalysts resulted in higher conversion with a lower yield of char. Ce/ZrO2 and Ni–Ce/ZrO2 were the most effective catalysts for the conversion of Tetraselmis (77–82%) and Isochrysis (66–75%). This was attributed to the low acidity of the Ni–Ce-based catalyst. Bio-oil yields increased with Ni–Ce-catalysts loaded on Al2O3 and ZrO2, because of the cracking effect offered by Ni. A high energy recovery of 66–77% is demonstrated with ceria-based catalysts and the HHV of the bio-oils is ∼34 MJ kg−1. Ce-Based catalysts exhibited pronounced denitrogenation (8.2 to 6.3%) and deoxygenation (14.1 to 9%). Similarly, pyrolysis of microalga, Pavlova sp., with Ni, Ce and Mg catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 was performed.33 The bio-oil produced using these ceria-based catalysts retained 61% of the initial energy of the microalgae as compared to 47% in the case of non-catalytic pyrolysis. Ni–Ce/γ-Al2O3 promoted the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons. This can be attributed to the inhibition of the formation of amides and nitriles via amination of carboxylic acids and dehydration of amides, respectively. Owing to the cracking effect of Ni, cracking of long-chain molecules (C20) was also enhanced. Carbohydrates were transformed into monoaromatics via subsequent dehydration and aromatization reactions, which can be linked to the presence of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites present in ceria-based catalysts. The bio-char obtained was rich in nitrogen with a N/C ratio ∼0.07 and low HHV (3–4 MJ kg−1), which makes it attractive for soil amendment. This discussion proves that the concentration and type of acid sites on the catalyst are vital for catalytic pyrolysis.
In another study, catalytic fast pyrolysis of Schizochytrium limacinum, a lipid-rich alga, was studied with various zeolites and metal oxides.35 Metal oxide catalysts such as MgO, TiO2, and ZrO2 exhibited different behavior in comparison to zeolites, which promoted the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and nitriles. These metal oxides were instrumental in selectively producing long chain ketones by promoting ketonization of two carboxylic acids. This inhibits the transformation of carboxylic acids into other low molecular weight compounds and hydrocarbons via decarboxylation. Hydrotreating catalysts, which are successfully used in refineries to reduce the sulfur content in transportation fuels, were tested for pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis oculata.166 The use of unsulfided Co–Mo/γ-Al2O3 with Nannochloropsis sp. promoted dehydration, isomerization, ketonization, and CH addition reactions. The bifunctional catalyst favored the production of low molecular weight compounds like 1-isocyanobutane and dimethylketene, which are valuable in the formulation of medicines for cancer treatment and polymer industries. Besides, fatty nitriles such as pentadecanitrile and hexadecanitrile were also produced.
Pyrolysis of microalga, Chlamydomonas debaryana, with activated carbon and β-zeolite produced aromatic compounds.167 The optimum pyrolysis temperature was observed to be 500 °C, and β-zeolite promoted the formation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (up to 18%), whereas activated carbon favored the production of monoaromatic hydrocarbons (40%). However, β-zeolite also promoted the formation of monoaromatic hydrocarbons up to ∼30%. It was concluded that hydrothermal carbonization of this alga followed by catalytic pyrolysis was effective in mitigating the overall nitrogen content in the bio-oil. Activated carbon was less likely to coke owing to the low formation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In situ catalysis of Isochrysis sp. was performed using a Li-LSX-zeolite in a fixed bed reactor made of stainless steel.168 The presence of acid sites on the catalyst promoted decarboxylation, decarbonylation, aromatization, and dehydration. The bio-oil yield decreased from 38 to 29 wt% with the use of catalyst, while the aromatics increased from 3 to 12% owing to the acidity of the catalyst.
Park and co-workers169 reviewed the recent advancements in catalytic pyrolysis of microalgae emphasizing the challenges in scale up.169 A hybrid composite of hexagonal mesoporous silicate (HMS) and ZSM-5 zeolite (HMS–ZSM-5) was used with Arthrospira platensis.170 Transition metals such as Fe, Ni, and Ce were supported on this composite and then tested. In Fe/HMS-ZSM-5, the Brønsted acid sites were significant along with more moderate acid sites and fewer strong acid sites. This resulted in high selectivity to aromatics (∼17%) and aliphatic hydrocarbons (∼33%). Recently, the use of basic layered double oxide (LDO) catalysts for algae pyrolysis was reported by Gao et al.171 LDO catalysts, which are obtained by calcining layered double hydroxides (LDH), possess high thermal stability, basicity, high surface area, and high dispersion.172 Catalytic pyrolysis of Cyanobacteria with MgAl-LDO/ZSM-5 was performed in a steel tube reactor at 550 °C. The catalyst was unique in terms of having both acidic sites and basic sites due to the presence of MgO and ZSM-5. The catalyst exhibited enhanced denitrogenation (45–51%). However, the formation of aromatic compounds was restricted, possibly due to the blocking of the active sites of ZSM-5 by LDO, and reduced shape-selectivity of the zeolite. Significant denitrogenation and deoxygenation occurred with MgAl-LDO/ZSM-5 catalyst. Maximum bio-oil yield (41 wt%) was obtained with catalyst-to-algae mass ratio of 0.75, and the HHV of the bio-oil was high (37.2 MJ kg−1). In another study, it was observed that Na2CO3 addition to C. vulgaris decreases the liquid yield and increases the gas yield.25 Although the bio-oil had low oxygen content, high aromatics, low acidity, and better HHV, the energy recovery (40%) was on a lower side. A summary of the studies reporting catalytic (fast) pyrolysis of microalgae with various catalysts is presented in Table 9 (ref. 18, 20, 23–25, 32, 33, 35, 38, 158 and 172). Fig. 8 depicts some of the salient reaction pathways with different catalysts for the conversion of microalgae species into fuel molecules and valuable compounds.

 Fig. 8  Pathways adopted by microalgae components during catalytic (fast) pyrolysis with various catalysts such as H-ZSM-5, MgO and Co–Mo/γ-Al2O3. 
This section has demonstrated the potential and viability of catalytic (fast) pyrolysis for the production of high-quality bio-oil and valuable chemicals. These insights can be utilized to fine-tune the catalyst type for particular microalgae species for resource recovery. However, the application of catalysts for producing chemicals via thermochemical techniques would warrant in-depth studies on deactivation, coke formation, and long-duration usability of the catalysts.
2.5. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis
In conventional pyrolysis occurring in conventional TG analyzers and fixed bed reactors, the major modes of heat transfer are conduction and convection. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) has gained significant importance as a promising thermochemical process to convert biomass in a single-step. Microwaves are non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation whose frequency lies in between the radio waves and the infrared (300 MHz to 300 GHz). Energy absorption by a substance in the microwave environment is called dielectric heating, where polar molecules vibrate. The dielectric loss tangent (tanδ) of a material plays a major role in the absorption of microwaves. It is defined as the ratio of dielectric loss (ε′′) to the dielectric constant of the material (ε′). The dielectric loss tangent is the ability of a material to dissipate the absorbed energy of the microwaves as heat. Biomasses have low tanδ values, and hence, there is a need to add microwave absorbing materials, also known as susceptors, to improve the heating rate. Materials like SiC, activated carbon, and pyrolysis bio-char act as potential susceptors. The amount of absorbed microwave radiation depends on the moisture present in the material. Water molecules are polar and more polar molecules would result in better absorption of microwave radiation. Microwave heating is beneficial, because uniform heating of biomass can be achieved, and larger size particles can be subjected to MAP, thus saving energy and cost required for size reduction of the feedstock. The studies on MAP of lignocellulosic biomass have revealed that there exists huge potential for scaling up the process at the commercial level.173–176
Du et al.177 performed MAP of C. vulgaris, and the bio-oil was analyzed using analytical techniques like GC/MS, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), FTIR, and TGA. Microwave power is directly related to the sample heating rate and the pyrolysis temperature at any time instant. The gas yield increased with an increase in microwave power from 25 wt% (at 500 W) to 35 wt% (at 1250 W). The bio-oil yield followed the trend 17 wt% (1250 W) < 25 wt% (500 W) < 29 wt% (750 W). At 500 W microwave power in pulsed mode, the low bio-oil yield can be attributed to incomplete pyrolysis, which is due to the low temperature attained after a specific time period. The low bio-oil yield at high microwave power can be related to the high extent of cracking along with secondary reactions including condensation and repolymerization, which increase gas and char yields. Owing to higher localized temperatures due to the formation of microplasma hotspots, MAP favors the production of gases even at low bulk temperature of the sample. MAP of microalgae can be employed to produce syngas with a high proportion of hydrogen.178–180 Bench or lab scale MAP reactors are simple to operate and do not offer many challenges for performing fundamental studies.
To overcome the issue of low bio-oil yield, fast pyrolysis conditions were mimicked in a microwave reactor by Borges et al.181 for the pyrolysis of Chlorella and Nannochloropsis strains. In the same study, catalytic fast MAP was also performed using a zeolite catalyst to enhance the bio-oil quality. A hybrid heating mechanism was developed to achieve fast pyrolysis conditions. Microwave heating was combined with the heat transferred from the already heated SiC, which was used as a microwave absorbent. The biomass feedstock was in direct contact with the heated SiC and was instantly heated to the desired reaction temperature. Chlorella, when pyrolyzed at 550 °C without a catalyst, yielded 57 wt% bio-oil. Catalytic MAP of Nannochloropsis at 500 °C with a HZSM-5:algae mass ratio of 0.5 resulted in 59 wt% bio-oil. Owing to significant dehydration reactions promoted by the catalysts, the bio-oil possessed low HHV as compared to that from non-catalytic pyrolysis. The results from this study show that the choice of catalyst for pyrolysis depends on the application, and the type of algae.
Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis is gaining importance, and several studies focus on improving the bio-oil yield and quality. The synergistic effects of Chlorella vulgaris with wood sawdust were investigated during MAP with activated carbon and SiC as susceptors.182 The use of activated carbon promoted the gas and liquid yields, which could be possibly due to more active dipolar friction intensity and interfacial polarization effects offered by activated carbon. As the amount of C. vulgaris increased in the presence of activated carbon as a susceptor, polyaromatic hydrocarbons decreased from 48% (at 0 wt% C. vulgaris) to 14% (at 100 wt% C. vulgaris). BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) production decreased as the amount of C. vulgaris decreased in the mixture from 20% (at 100% C. vulgaris) to 2% (at 0% C. vulgaris). It is interesting to note that SiC with only wood sawdust resulted in the formation of phenols to the tune of 43%. The formation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons with activated carbon under similar conditions can be attributed to the promotion of subsequent deoxygenation reactions and condensation of aromatic molecules. The HHVs of the bio-oil from co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris with wood sawdust using activated carbon and SiC were in the range of 15–25 MJ kg−1 and 18–26 MJ kg−1, respectively.
The low hydrogen content and high nitrogen and oxygen content in the bio-oil obtained from MAP can be overcome by processing microalgae with hydrogen-rich feedstocks. Ruan and co-workers183 investigated fast microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. with hydrogen-rich scum as a co-feedstock along with HZSM-5 catalyst. By using microalgae, environmental implications due to scum can be mitigated. Scum is primarily a complex mixture discharged from households. It is a cheap material, and it qualifies as a potential hydrogen-rich co-feedstock. This can be attributed to the presence of animal fat, vegetable oil, and domestic waste plastics in it. The addition of scum to algae enhanced the production of aromatic hydrocarbons to 75% (algae:scum ratio = 1:2). The feedstock containing an algae:scum ratio of 1:1 was treated with HZSM-5 (feed:catalyst ratio = 1:2), and this yielded 40% of aromatic hydrocarbons.
It should be noted that bio-oil from microalgae contains significant amount of nitrogen and oxygen, which makes its direct use difficult. The utilization of hydrogen-rich polymers as a co-feedstock with microalgae is a promising option to improve the bio-oil quality. Microwave-assisted fast co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris with polyvinylchloride (PVC) was performed by Dai et al.156 The heating rates achieved in this study were in the range of 257–402 °C min−1 in the microwave power range of 800–1000 W. The generation of HCl from PVC pyrolysis promoted the dehydration reactions owing to its Lewis acidity, and the presence of carbohydrates aided the release of HCl in the vapor phase. Algae:PVC mass ratios of 5:5 and 3:7 at microwave powers of 800 and 1000 W, respectively, produced high bio-oil yields due to synergistic effects. As the PVC amount increased, the nitrogen-content of the bio-oil decreased from 30% to 0.3%, and oxygen decreased from 20% to trace levels. In addition, the formation of aromatic compounds increased, while aliphatic hydrocarbons decreased. At a microwave power of 1000 W, the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 23% to 92%.
MAP is also a promising technique to degrade hard-to-degrade wastes such as waste tires. There is potential to produce valuable products from the co-pyrolysis of microalgae and waste tires. The effect of gas atmosphere (N2, CO2) on microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris and waste tires was also studied.184 The use of CO2 resulted in a low bio-oil yield as compared to that in N2 ambience, and no marked trend in char and gases yields was observed. The type of gas medium during pyrolysis had a significant effect on the quality of bio-oil obtained from co-pyrolysis experiments. MAP of Chlorella vulgaris in a N2 atmosphere resulted in more hydrocarbons and fewer benzene derivatives as compared to those in a CO2 atmosphere. The effect of the gas medium did not alter the composition of bio-oil obtained from the MAP of tires. However, co-pyrolysis experiments were affected by the gas medium. In a N2 environment, maximum hydrocarbon yield (58%) was obtained with 70 wt% Chlorella, whereas in CO2 environment, maximum hydrocarbon yield (50%) was obtained with 50 wt% Chlorella. The styrene–butadiene rubber backbone in the tires resulted in the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during the co-pyrolysis.
Some of the key studies based on MAP of microalgae are mentioned in Table 10 (ref. 177–181). The increasing interest in the development of microwave pyrolysis technology warrants the need to understand the reaction pathways and the fate of nitrogen during the pyrolysis of microalgae. Huang et al.185 studied MAP of protein-rich microalgae species, Spirulina and Chlorella, and the key pathways for the formation of N-containing compounds were proposed. The MAP of microalgae at the lab scale is advantageous owing to the low cost and simple reactor set-up. Some of the problems to be addressed include scaling up of the magnetron and temperature control in the reactor. Temperature control is a challenge owing to the generation of microplasma hotspots. Even the high heating rates obtained in the microwave reactors (as high as 500 °C min−1) result in relatively low bio-oil yields and high gas yields. Therefore, significant work on the optimization of microwave power and microwave absorbers is required. The efficiency of microwave heating and continuous operation are the key concerns for scaling up the technology. Presently, results from lab-scale studies are promising, and this technology needs to be researched to address the aforementioned problems.

2.6. Hydropyrolysis
In order to address the issue of high oxygen present in the bio-oil, the biomass/algae can be pyrolyzed in a reactive hydrogen atmosphere at higher pressures to reduce the oxygen content, and this process is termed as hydropyrolysis. The obtained products can be easily upgraded to hydrocarbons after mild hydrotreatment. The process offers an advantage of facilitating hydroprocessing in the same unit, and the limitations of the fast pyrolysis bio-oil are also overcome. Hydropyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass results in an oil with low oxygen content (9–12%), and high yields of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons.186 Scale-up of hydropyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass in pilot and demonstration scales has been achieved with the development of the integrated hydropyrolysis and hydroconversion process (IH2®). In this technology, hydrogen at high partial pressure (∼3.4 MPa) is used in the presence of a suitable hydroprocessing catalyst at 340–470 °C.187 Hydropyrolysis of microalgae is an area yet to be explored at a fundamental level.
Duan and coworkers were the first to report bio-oil production by hydropyrolysis of microalgae at higher pressures.188 Heterotrophically cultured Chlorella pyrenoidosa was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor in a hydrogen atmosphere at high pressures (∼0.1–8 MPa) in the temperature range of 150–450 °C in order to examine the effect of pressure, temperature and residence time on the properties of bio-oil. Optimization of temperature was performed by fixing the pressure at 3 MPa and reaction time at 60 min. As the temperature increased, the liquid yield increased up to 53.2 wt%, and then decreased. However, reverse trends were observed for solid yields. In general, high temperatures promote secondary reactions and repolymerization, which may increase the solid yield. The highest liquid yield (53.2 wt%) and the lowest solid yield (12.3 wt%) were observed at 310 °C. This temperature was chosen for subsequent experiments by varying the pressure and reaction time. It is worthwhile to note that the effects of reaction time and pressure were not pronounced on the bio-oil yield. Importantly, 85% of energy recovery from microalgae was achieved via hydropyrolysis. In a subsequent study, the bio-oil was upgraded by catalytic processing to reduce the oxygen and nitrogen.189
Chang et al.190 carried out catalytic hydropyrolysis of Chlorella pyrenoidosa using hydrotreating catalysts such as Pd/C, Pt/C, Ru/C, Rh/C, CoMo/γ-Al2O3, Mo2C and MoS2. The optimized temperature and pressure were 310 °C and 6 MPa, respectively. At a catalyst loading of 20 wt% and 10 min reaction time, high bio-oil yields were obtained with Mo2C (53 wt%) and MoS2 (51 wt%). It should be noted that among all noble metal catalysts used, Rh/C yielded the highest bio-oil yield (48.4 wt%). All the catalysts except Pd/C showed significant deoxygenation, and significant denitrogenation was achieved with Pd/C and Rh/C. Overall, the bio-oil obtained was enriched with hydrogen (as high as 10%) as compared to 7% in the case of non-catalytic hydropyrolysis. Mo2C exhibited pronounced hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodesulfurization with a high liquid yield (52.6 wt%). The HHVs of the pyrolysis oils obtained using various catalysts were high (35.3–39.3 MJ kg−1) as compared to non-catalytic hydropyrolysis (22 MJ kg−1). In another study, co-hydropyrolysis of waste engine oil with microalgae and macroalgae was performed to produce hydrocarbon-rich fuel.191 Pd/C was used to further reduce the oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur content in the oil from co-hydropyrolysis. This process, at 400 °C and a H2 pressure of 6 MPa, effectively reduced oxygen and sulfur to the tune of 76% and 86%, respectively, from the oil. Catalytic co-hydropyrolysis resulted in bio-oil with heating values in the range of 46–48 MJ kg−1, and energy recovery in the range of 80–92%. The products obtained from the hydropyrolysis of algae are significantly different from those from pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere. A detailed reaction mechanism of the hydropyrolysis process is yet to be unraveled, which points to the need to study the reaction pathways involved in the formation of various chemicals via (catalytic) hydropyrolysis of algae.
2.7. Reaction pathways in algae pyrolysis
Microalgae are complex species and various reactions occur during pyrolysis. Therefore, it is essential to understand the reactions that lead to the formation of chemicals and fuel-intermediates. The nitrogen content of some of the microalgae species is as high as 11% (Table 1), which is significantly higher than that of lignocellulosic biomass. Such a high nitrogen content results in the emission of ammonia, NOx, and HCN during pyrolysis, leading to nitrogen-related pollution. The production of nitrogen-containing compounds like indole, pyrrole, and pyridine derivatives makes pyrolysis an attractive technique to make platform chemicals for various chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Owing to these aspects, it is vital to understand the pathways taken by the nitrogen-containing species. This can aid in controlling the liberation of nitrogen in the gas phase. Fig. 7 depicts various interconversions occurring during the fast pyrolysis of the biochemical components of microalgae.
Chen et al.192 studied the transformation of N-containing compounds during fast pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp., Spirulina platensis, and Enteromorpha prolifera. In the temperature range of 400–600 °C, cyclization and dimerization reactions result in the formation of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N in the char along with the formation of polycyclic compounds containing nitrogen. Fig. 9 shows the plausible nitrogen transformation routes during algae pyrolysis. In the bio-oil, the formation of amides and nitriles can be attributed to the amination of carboxylic acids, and their subsequent dehydration, respectively.18,35 The presence of heterocyclic N-containing compounds can be attributed to the decomposition of pyridinic-, pyrrolic- and quaternary-N present in the proteins.192

Catalysts can be employed to convert nitrogen in algae to ammonia, long-chain nitriles, aromatic hydrocarbons, and other special chemicals.192,193Chlorella vulgaris was pyrolyzed with various H-ZSM-5 catalysts to produce valuable chemicals and ammonia.193,194 Wang and Brown193 showed that the solid residue contained 92% nitrogen with 5% nitrogen released as ammonia when Chlorella vulgaris was pyrolyzed at 400 °C. The amount of nitrogen increased to 53% in the gas phase ammonia when the temperature was increased to 800 °C. The amount of nitrogen distributed in HCN increased to 13% (800 °C) from 3% (400 °C). A mechanistic understanding of the distribution of nitrogen can furnish insights on controlling its amount in the gas phase by the use of catalysts.
The use of catalysts along with microalgae can lead to the formation of fine chemicals by altering the reaction mechanism under fast pyrolysis conditions. The use of metal oxides like MgO and ZrO2 for the fast pyrolysis of Schizochytrium limacinum favored the conversion of carboxylic acids via ketonization of two carboxylic acids to produce C17 and C23 ketones.35 The reactions between the individual components extracted and isolated from microalgae were unveiled to decipher the effect of composition on the product formation.143 It was found that steroids and lipopolysaccharides can be converted to hydrocarbons in the bio-oil.143
It is evident from the existing studies that the transformation of proteins is responsible for the formation of N-containing cyclic compounds, phenols, aromatic hydrocarbons, amides, amines, and nitriles. The formation of hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, and esters can be attributed to the pyrolysis of lipids via decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and cracking reactions. The low carbohydrate content in the microalgae is reflected in the form of anhydrosugars in the bio-oil, which are usually formed at low yields. In general, the complex structure of microalgae hinders the detailed understanding of reaction mechanisms. The biochemical composition of microalgae significantly affects the pyrolysis products, and this was recently discussed in the review by Yang et al.195 The same review also presents a detailed mechanism for the conversion of microalgae under pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis conditions.195 Therefore, detailed studies using surrogates will definitely provide insights into the transformations during fast pyrolysis. Studies by Gautam and Vinu134 and Wang et al.142,143 have elucidated the mechanism of fast pyrolysis of microalgae surrogates to understand the reactions, and the effect of catalysts on the conversion of individual components. However, there is very limited literature focusing on this aspect. The results from studies using advanced modeling tools like density functional theory (DFT) should be combined with experiments to establish reaction mechanisms and kinetics of elementary reactions.
2.8. Kinetics of microalgae pyrolysis
Knowledge of kinetics is vital to better understand the pyrolysis behavior and design pyrolysis reactors. Both mechanistic kinetics and apparent kinetics are decisive for the use of microalgae species as a potential source of biofuels. A majority of the kinetic studies reported in the literature have utilized TG data, where the mass loss of the sample as a function of temperature or time is used to determine the kinetic parameters. The kinetic parameters, viz., apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor, are determined by generating the TG data at single or multiple heating rates. For a majority of the kinetic analysis, the rate of conversion (α) of the sample is defined as a function of temperature (T), given by:196 (1)where f(α) is the functional form of conversion defined by a reaction model, and k(T) is the temperature dependence of the rate constant. The normalized conversion (α) is given by the expression, (2)where m0 is the initial mass, mt is the mass at any time t during the reaction, and m∞ is the steady-state mass obtained at the end of the experiment. As the reaction proceeds, α increases from 0 to 1. Importantly, this kinetic analysis is global and cannot be linked to specific elementary free radical or concerted reactions occurring during the fast pyrolysis of the microalgae. Using various integral, differential, and nth-order model fitting techniques, the rate constants at different temperatures can be determined. Eqn (1) can be rewritten as: (3)
The integral, g(α), depends on the reaction model, f(α). For isothermal mass loss data, the rate constants at different temperatures are determined by plotting g(α) vs. t, and determining the slope of the straight line through the origin. The rate constant, according to the Arrhenius equation, is given by , where A is the pre-exponential factor in s−1, Ea is the apparent activation energy in J mol−1, and R is the universal gas constant, 8.314 J mol−1 K−1. The apparent rate parameters are calculated by fitting a straight line to the equation, . The reaction models can be classified as accelerating, decelerating, and sigmoidal based on the shape of the conversion profile. For accelerating models, the rate increases continuously as the conversion increases and reaches a maximum as the reaction completes. For decelerating models, the reaction rate is high in the beginning, and then decreases as the conversion increases. For sigmoidal models, the initial and final stages represent accelerating and decelerating behavior, respectively. The choice of model is based on the nature of the conversion profile.196
Evaluation of apparent kinetic parameters at high heating rates becomes imperative for the better design of fast pyrolysis reactors. The thermogravimetric data are not only useful to determine the apparent kinetics but also to understand the multi-step mechanisms involved.197 The inherent composition of the microalgae leads to lower decomposition temperatures than lignocellulosic biomass during thermochemical conversion. Global kinetic schemes are used to explain the devolatilization, and to capture the overall yields of bio-oil, gas, and char from pyrolysis. Investigating the intrinsic (or mechanistic) kinetics of algae pyrolysis is complicated due to its complex bio-chemical composition.

2.8.1. Apparent kinetic models. 
TGA is extensively used to study the thermal behavior and the kinetics of decomposition. To gain more insights into the pyrolysis process, multiple reaction models have been used. By means of TGA, a lumped model involving three reactions, viz., algae → bio-oil → gases, algae → gases, was considered by Vo et al.198 The apparent activation energy of bio-oil formation was determined to be 71.2 kJ mol−1. One, two, three, four, and seven-reaction models were utilized by Bach and Chen.199 They found that the seven-reaction model described the pyrolysis mass loss profiles of Chlorella vulgaris well. A five component pseudo-component model was used to understand the apparent kinetics of pyrolysis of Chlamydomonas sp. and Chlorella sorokiniana.21 A multi-step model was developed to model the pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis gaditana, Scenedesmus almeriensis, and Chlorella vulgaris involving devolatilization and oxidation.131 The models employed in these studies are based on a simplified assumption that each microalgae component decomposes with single activation energy. Nevertheless, owing to the complex structure of the algae, a range of activation energies are required to describe the dissociation of various types of bonds present in proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. It is also important to capture the kinetics of pyrolysis using a fewer fitted rate parameters, and pseudo components that make real sense.
The activation energy and pre-exponential factor for a thermal decomposition process can also be determined by employing isoconversional methods as per the recommendation of the International Confederation for Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry (ICTAC).200 Vuppaladadiyam et al.201 used Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) and Friedman methods to determine the apparent activation energy of pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris, Spirulina, Chroococcus, and a mixed culture. Isoconversional models yield the variation of apparent activation energy of decomposition of the organic matter in a specific conversion range. Typically, invariant apparent activation energy signifies single step decomposition, while the variation of apparent activation energy with conversion qualitatively denotes a multi-step decomposition process. The compensation and master plot methods are used to ascertain the thermal degradation mechanism of different microalgae species.201 Pyrolysis kinetics of Chlorella sp. and Bracteacoccus sp. cultivated in a mixed culture in city wastewater was studied.202 The apparent activation energies of pyrolysis of both species were determined by isoconversional methods such as KAS, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), Starink, and Coats and Redfern. The apparent activation energy in the conversion range of 0.2–0.8 varied in the range of 182–256 kJ mol−1. This study showed that the combined algae culture in wastewater can be used to remove nitrates and phosphates.
In order to ascertain the accurate kinetics of pyrolysis of microalgae, the choice of the correct model is critical. The use of master plots can assist in deciding the model for the thermal decomposition of the algae. The general representation of g(α) is given by: (4)Brown203 approximated this temperature integral as follows: (5)where π(x) is the approximation of the temperature integral and x = Ea/RT. The combination of integral and differential forms of models gives z(α) master plots. Eqn (1) and (5) can be combined and rearranged to obtain the following expression: (6)Now, it is important to note that the value of α,  and Tα2 can be taken from the experimental data to determine z(α). The theoretical z(α) can be calculated from the product f(α)g(α). For different heating rates, theoretical and experimental z(α) can be plotted as a function of conversion. The models that yield a good match with experimental data are chosen to describe the kinetics of pyrolysis using regression analysis. This approach was used by Vasudev et al.204 to determine the apparent kinetic parameters of pyrolysis of three different microalgae species, viz., Chlorella vulgaris, Dunaliella salina and Haematococcus pluvialis. Friedman model was identified as the best method for the determination of apparent kinetic parameters. Moreover, the nucleation model fitted the experimental data obtained at low and high conversions, while the diffusion model was valid in the intermediate conversion regime. An exhaustive review by Bach and Chen205 reports the various kinetic models for determining the apparent kinetics of microalgae pyrolysis. Generally, the model-free isoconversional methods are simple to work with. However, they provide only limited kinetic information. The apparent activation energies from these models can probably be used as initial estimates for a more robust kinetic model that involves the decomposition of pseudo components. In this regard, Bach and Chen205 demonstrated the advantages of parallel reaction models over a single step reaction kinetic model to capture the shape of the differential mass loss profile that depicts the decomposition of biochemical constituents of the algae at different temperatures. It is important to note that increasing the number of biochemical constituents in the model only increases the number of parameters to be fitted to match the experimental data. One concern is the uniqueness of the fitted parameters, especially when there are more parameters to be fitted. Therefore, a judicious choice of the number of components or reactions is necessary, and it will be better if it is based on experimentally determined biochemical constituents.
Kinetic models of thermal decomposition of organic matter can also involve series reactions. In a series reaction model, the organic matter first converts to intermediates and volatiles followed by the conversion of intermediates into volatiles and char. It is important to note that the extent of conversion of organic matter to intermediates determines the secondary conversion of intermediates into volatile products and char in a series reaction. This model has been used to describe the torrefaction process.206–208 Prins et al.206 used a series model to accurately describe the torrefaction of biomass in the temperature range 230–300 °C, and predicted a two-step degradation process. The first step was identified as hemicellulose decomposition and the second step was identified as cellulose decomposition. The kinetic model also recommended parameters such as temperature and time for industrial torrefaction. This model was extended to predict the volatile and solid compositions in different volatile evolution stages.207,208 Nine different products in the volatiles were observed, which included water, acetic acid, carbon dioxide, methanol and lactic acid. The energy balance with respect to the chemical reactions was also developed using this model. In other study, Bach et al.208 predicted the yields and composition of solids and volatiles produced from the torrefaction of forest residues. The potential of such models to provide optimized results for torrefaction of biomass on an industrial scale seeds the idea of translating this to microalgae pyrolysis. Such models are based on a simplified assumption that each microalgae component decomposes with single activation energy.


2.8.2. Semi-detailed kinetic models. 
Owing to the complexity of microalgae pyrolysis, and the involvement of multiple parallel reactions, it is difficult to describe the entire process with a single-step reaction kinetic model. Recently, Ranzi and co-workers209 developed a multi-step semi-detailed kinetic mechanism of algae pyrolysis using different reference compounds and validated the model with the experimental data obtained under dynamic slow pyrolysis and isothermal fast pyrolysis conditions.198 The reference components for algae samples were determined using proximate and elemental analyses. A characterization procedure was formulated based on the scheme depicted in Fig. 10. The amounts of H2O, CO2, NO, and NH3 were determined after proximate and elemental analysis. This was followed by determining the elemental composition without inorganics (H/C/O/N)I. Further to this, the N-free elemental composition was determined (H/C/O)II based on the assumption that all the remaining nitrogen was due to proteins. (H/C/O)III was described in terms of sugars and lipids, and this was utilized to estimate the composition of the protein fraction (H/C/O)PROT. This characterization procedure predicted the biochemical composition of microalgae species reasonably well. To validate the characterization procedure, the experimental and predicted data were compared. The reference species were grouped as follows:
 Fig. 10  Characterization scheme of microalgae species. Redrawn with permission from Debiagi et al.209 Copyright (2017) Elsevier. 
• PROT-C, PROT-H, and PROT-O together represented the total protein content.
• The characterization procedure was used to determine the composition of sugars and lipids.
• The sum of CO2, NO, and NH3 represented total inorganics.
A comparison of experimental and predicted compositions of the biochemical constituents is tabulated in Table 11. With the development of this characterization model, Ranzi and co-workers209 inferred that the predicted biochemical composition is independent of the assumptions involved in the characterization methodology. It was demonstrated that the model was able to predict the protein composition with values higher than 60% and lower than 40%. For a detailed understanding of this procedure, the interested reader may refer to Debiagi et al.209Tables 12 and 13 present the kinetic mechanism of algae pyrolysis and description of species, respectively.

After the multi-step reaction scheme for the reference species was established, the mass loss profiles were predicted using linear combinations of the reaction sets of the biochemical constituents. The developed semi-detailed kinetic model was validated with the experimental data of dynamic slow pyrolysis and isothermal fast pyrolysis. Fig. 11 shows the match of the model with the experimental TG profiles of Arthrospira platensis. The predicted mass loss profile for slow pyrolysis of microalgae matched well with the experimental TG data, while a reasonable match was obtained for the isothermal mass loss data under fast pyrolysis conditions at 400 °C. Although a deviation in the predicted profile was observed at 700 °C with respect to the experimental data, the residual mass at the end of 50 s was predicted well by the model.

2.8.3. Distributed activated energy model. 
The distributed activation energy model (DAEM) assumes that the decomposition of complex polymers present in the biomass occurs via a large number of independent and irreversible reactions. Each reaction would have its own activation energy, and so an activation energy range is obtained for the decomposition of a specific component. This activation energy range, in general, is represented by an activation energy function following a Gaussian distribution owing to the success of this type of model.210 The general equation for DAEM is written as follows: (7)where α is the conversion normalized with respect to char, and f(E) is the function representing activation energy distribution. The expression for f(E) is given as: (8)The expression stated above is the Gaussian distribution centered at mean activation energy (E0) with standard deviation (σ).
DAEM utilizes the kinetic data collected from TGA, and so far, it has been applied to slow pyrolysis conditions. There is a limited number of studies reporting the application of DAEM to the pyrolysis of microalgae species. Ceylan and Kazan211 explained the pyrolysis behavior and kinetics of Nannochloropsis oculata and Tetraselmis sp. using the DAEM approach. Simao et al.212 investigated the pyrolysis behavior of Spirulina maxima using multiple models such as the Miura–Maki DAEM, independent parallel reaction model, and isoconversional kinetic models of Friedman and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa. A thorough comparison of the isoconversional methods with DAEM was reported by Soria-Verdugo et al.213 using six different microalgae species, viz., Chlorella vulgaris, Isochrysis galbana, Nannochloropsis gaditana, Nannochloropsis limnetica, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and Spirulina platensis. Microalgae residue pyrolysis is also a potential strategy to maximize resource recovery, and DAEM was employed to model the pyrolysis of residues of Chlorella sorokiniana and Chlamydomonas sp.214 In this study, five pseudo components were used to model the pyrolysis with lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose as the major components. It is worthwhile to mention that microalgae consist of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, and some studies have assumed components other than these to model pyrolysis to address the complex decomposition pattern of the pseudocomponents.
Viju et al.215 applied DAEM to describe the pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis oculata. Here, four parallel-reactions were considered. Pyrolysis of individual components using surrogates was performed to map the actual microalgae pyrolysis with that of the surrogates. The unique feature of this study was to correlate the pyrolysis products with the thermal decomposition of the individual components. Fig. 12 depicts the experimental and predicted thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric profiles using DAEM. The fourth decomposition step, in addition to the decomposition of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, was the secondary decomposition of char, which was observed at high temperatures (800–1000 °C). Table 14 (ref. 18, 21, 22, 28, 29, 131, 135, 137, 198, 199 and 211–213) captures the apparent kinetic parameters of pyrolysis of different microalgae reported in the literature. It is evident that the parameters vary in a wide range based on the model used.

2.8.4. Apparent kinetics of fast pyrolysis. 
The rate parameters obtained at slow heating rates (5–200 °C min−1) may not be applicable under fast pyrolysis conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to obtain TG mass loss data at fast heating rates to model fast pyrolysis, and evaluate the apparent rate parameters. Owing to the short time scales employed in fast pyrolysis, it becomes challenging to generate mass loss data. The studies reporting fast pyrolysis kinetics of biomass are scarce.216–219 The pyrolysis time scale of biomass under fast pyrolysis conditions at 500 °C was estimated to be 0.8 s with the use of a high-speed camera.216 Green et al.218 emphasized the limitation of the Arrhenius rate expression for the determination of kinetic parameters because the mass loss profiles do not depend on the model type. The same study also proposed the assumption of combining first- and second-order reactions to improve the accuracy in the estimation of apparent kinetic parameters. The information about primary and secondary reactions also assumes importance during fast pyrolysis kinetics. In an ultra-pyrolysis set-up used for pyrolysis of biomass, the primary reaction rates were reportedly high by several orders of magnitude as compared to those of secondary reactions.219
Till date, there is only one study that presents fast pyrolysis kinetics of microalgae species.135 Mass loss profiles of four microalgae species, viz., Arthrospira platensis, Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochloropsis oculata, and Schizochytrium limacinum, were generated under isothermal conditions at a high heating rate (∼150 °C s−1) using an analytical Pyroprobe® reactor. First-order and diffusion models were used to determine the rate constants at different temperatures, and the Arrhenius equation was used to determine the apparent kinetic parameters. The first-order model was observed to match the experimental data well, and the apparent activation energies were found to be in the range of 4–21 kJ mol−1. Table 14 presents the kinetic parameters obtained for different algae. The low values of apparent activation energies obtained at fast heating rates show that diffusion effects are pre-dominant under the experimental conditions, wherein the thermal shock experienced by the sample results in mass diffusion of vapors through the sample, which controls the overall mass loss rate. More importantly, a statistical kinetic compensation effect was established by utilizing a range of rate parameter values from the literature that were obtained at slow, moderate and fast heating rates. This equation was given by: ln(A) = 0.19Ea + 0.43. Low apparent activation energies are also reported for fast pyrolysis of alkali lignin (23 kJ mol−1) by Ojha et al.220 The development of semi-detailed lumped kinetic models considering the complex composition would furnish more insights into understanding the fast pyrolysis kinetics of microalgae species. This is an important aspect of scaling-up the process on a commercial scale.

2.9. Pyrolysis of macroalgae
In section 1.5 and Fig. 1, it is clearly demonstrated that macroalgae species have low protein content, and this is reflected in the low nitrogen present in them (Table 2). This is why the biofuels obtained from macroalgae are better as compared to those from microalgae, because their combustion would result in low NOx emissions. Macroalgae species, owing to the presence of pigments such as carotenoids, phycobiliproteins, and a variety of chlorophylls, are used for applications other than biofuel production, such as in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food as diet supplements. The carbohydrates in macroalgae are present in the form of complex polysaccharides such as carrageenan, fucoidan, cellulose, agar, laminarin, alginate, and ulvan. Sudhakar et al.221 reviewed the applications of macroalgae species as a sustainable option for the production of bioactive compounds.
The idea of macroalgae pyrolysis is less than two decades old, and it started with the assessment of the thermal behavior of macroalgae species in a conventional TG analyzer. Ross et al.118 investigated the potential of five macroalgae species, viz., Chorda filum, Laminaria digitata, Fucus serratus, Laminaria hyperborean, and Macrocystis pyrifera. Their thermal characteristics were also compared with conventional terrestrial biomasses. In the Van Krevelen diagram, these species lie in the same region as terrestrial biomasses. Fast pyrolysis of these macroalgae species at 500 °C resulted in a wide variety of compounds, and the production of high-value chemicals is foreseen as future development. The presence of halogens and metals in the pyrolysates is a bottleneck for the direct usage of these species for fuel application. In a subsequent study, pyrolysis of three macroalgae species, viz., Laminaria hyperborean, Fucus vesiculosus and Macrocystis pyrifera, was investigated before and after pre-treatment.114 The common pre-treatment methods include hot water and acid washing to remove the minerals. It was found that pre-treatment with water removed 30–40% of the alkali metals, whereas acid washing removed over 90% of the alkali metals. It was stated that the removal of these metals by pre-treatment resulted in different pyrolysis products, and the reaction pathways were altered, which calls for further detailed investigation.114
The pyrolysis kinetics of Enteromorpha prolifera was comprehensively studied using the Freeman–Carroll method.222 The apparent activation energy was determined by the FWO method, and it is 228.1 kJ mol−1. In addition, the pre-exponential factors and reaction orders ranged between 50–63.29 s−1 and 2.2–3.7, respectively. As macroalgae are valuable sources of various special utility products, the residue left after the extraction of these products can also be pyrolyzed. Gelidium sp. waste was collected after processing it for the production of agar-agar.223 The HHVs of bio-oil and bio-char obtained from the pyrolysis of this residue in a tubular reactor were 26.2 and 25.5 MJ kg−1, respectively. The obtained bio-oil was rich in phenols (30 area%). Interestingly, the gases evolved were rich in CO and H2 (combined yield of 41.2 vol.%), and the HHV was reported to be 13.9 MJ kg−1.
Ly et al.224 pyrolyzed the acid-washed Cladophora socialis in a microtubing reactor at 390 °C to investigate the product composition. Hexadecenoic acid (21 area%), tetradecanoic acid and furfural (both ∼7 area%) were the major products from the unwashed alga, whereas 6-methoxypyran-2,5-dione, a carbohydrate derivative, was the major product (29 area%) from the acid-washed alga. On the basis of rate constants, the lumped kinetic model suggested that the alga to liquid bio-oil pathway is favored over the algae to gas pathway. In another study by Kim et al.,225 non-isothermal pyrolysis of Porphyra tenera was performed and the decomposition of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates was mapped with the formation of various pyrolysis products. Below 300 °C, pyrolysis products were linked to carbohydrates. Phenols, benzene derivatives, amino acids and hexadecenoic acid evolved between 300 and 380 °C. Alkanes and aromatics were the major compounds at higher temperatures (>400 °C). This was attributed to the secondary cracking of pyrolysis products from lipids and proteins. The apparent activation energy of pyrolysis was in the range of 165–368.4 kJ mol−1.
It is important to understand the effect of alkali metals such as K, Ca, and Mg on the pyrolysis of macroalgae species and their constituents. Carbohydrates are present in the form of alginates in the macroalgae in significant quantities. Ross et al.226 studied the effect of cations during the pyrolysis of alginates. In this study, Na and Ca alginates were pyrolyzed, and the quality of bio-oil and bio-char was investigated. Na+ facilitated the decomposition, whereas Ca2+ did not affect the algae decomposition. Char from Na alginate was found to be mesoporous in nature. This study unraveled the potential of controlling the bio-char and bio-oil composition by changing the cation in the alginates. This can be implemented during the growth of macroalgae to obtain the products with desirable qualities. Like microalgae, macroalgae can be pyrolyzed along with polymers and waste plastics. There are very limited studies on co-pyrolysis of polymers with macroalgae. The ability of PVC to donate hydrogen to form HCl, which can subsequently act as an acid catalyst under pyrolysis conditions was discussed in an earlier section. Co-pyrolysis of Enteromorpha clathrata with PVC was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at 550 °C.227 This study investigated the effect of the PVC-to-macroalgae ratio on the composition of bio-oil and bio-char. The addition of PVC to macroalgae reduced the amount of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds in the bio-oil. Through potentiometric titrations, it was shown that Cl got transferred to char in significant amounts. The co-pyrolysis experiments reduced the bio-oil yield but increased the formation of bio-char. The formation of phenols, aromatic, and aliphatic compounds in the bio-oil was promoted due to the fact that HCl acted as an acid catalyst.
An understanding of the pyrolysis behavior of individual components of macroalgae species is necessary for the production of valuable chemicals and fuel molecules. Pyrolysis of surrogates of macroalgae components can furnish insights on the reaction mechanism. As polysaccharides are abundant in macroalgae, studying their pyrolysis is vital. A sulfated polysaccharide was chosen to understand the decomposition mechanism during pyrolysis.228 Py-GC/MS and DFT were used to ascertain the formation of various products. From DFT calculations, the main products were found to be CO, CO2, SO3, furfural, and 5-methyl furfural. This was validated by Py-GC/MS experiments which showed high selectivity to furfural (∼40%) and 5-methyl furfural (9.6%). In one study, polysaccharides from two different species, viz., Enteromorpha clathrata and Spergo fusiforme, were extracted.229 To obtain a high-quality bio-oil, the co-pyrolysis of extracted polysaccharides with cellulose was performed. To further produce specialty chemicals, catalytic pyrolysis with ZSM-5 was also performed. The bio-oil yield of polysaccharides from both macroalgae species increased significantly (from ∼30 to 40 wt%). The mixing of catalyst with the polysaccharides significantly reduced the nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds in the bio-oil, and the formation of furans and ketones was promoted. There are limited studies on the use of catalysts in macroalgae pyrolysis. Typically, ZSM-5, Y-zeolite, mordenite, metal supported zeolites, H-ZSM-5, HMS, and ZH catalysts have been used as catalysts.230,231Ulva prolifera pyrolysis in a fixed bed reactor at 400 °C resulted in bio-oil yield of 38.5–41.3 wt%.230 The phenols increased from 9 to 16 area% with the catalyst, and the gas yield also increased owing to cracking and decarboxylation reactions. Wang et al.231 used Mg and ceria supported on ZSM-5 for Enteromorpha clathrata pyrolysis, and reported the formation of 5-methylfurfural (∼15 area%). Non-catalytic pyrolysis of Gracilaria gracilis at 500 °C produced a bio-oil rich in acetic acid (7.14 wt%), furfural (5.25 wt%) and phenol (6.28 wt%).232 The catalysts, viz., HMS, HZSM-5, and ZH, resulted in high selectivity to hydrogen, with a concomitant reduction in oxygenates such as carboxylic acids, furfural, and phenols.
It can be inferred from this discussion that macroalgae are highly capable of yielding biofuels and high-value chemicals via pyrolysis. However detailed techno-economic analysis and lifecycle analysis studies will shed more light on the viability of pyrolysis as a conversion technology for macroalgae. Fast pyrolysis is seen as an attractive choice for the conversion of microalgae. Not many studies are present in the literature reporting the fast pyrolysis of macroalgae. Fast pyrolysis of three macroalgae species, viz., Kappaphycus alvarezii, Sargassum wightii and Turbinaria ornata was performed in an analytical Curie point pyrolyzer at 500 °C.233 The formation of furan derivatives was representative of the carbohydrates present in the three macroalgae species. Kappaphycus alvarezii, an alga rich in carbohydrates, resulted in the highest combined selectivity (50%) to furan derivatives and anhydrosugars, followed by Sargassum wightii (31%) and Turbinaria ornata (18%). In the same study, microwave-assisted pyrolysis of macroalgae species was performed. The reaction pathways for the conversion of biochemical components into various products for both pyrolysis processes were significantly different. C–C and C–H bond β-scission resulted in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil from microwave-assisted pyrolysis. The high localized temperatures, owing to the formation of microplasma hotspots, resulted in the cracking of anhydrosugars and furan derivatives, which were present in traces in the bio-oil. Fig. 13 depicts the reactions involved in microwave-assisted and analytical fast pyrolysis of macroalgae species. A recent study focused on the techno-economic analysis of fast pyrolysis of Saccharina japonica unraveled the associated low carbon economy.234 Experimental data utilized for simulations were obtained in a fluidized bed reactor with and without catalysts. 400000 tonnes per year (dry biomass) of Saccharina japonica yielded 270000 barrels of upgraded bio-oil per year. The techno-economic analysis and market studies predicted USD 170 million of investment. The minimum selling price of fuel was estimated to be in the range of USD 1.534–1.852 per L. The overall process is shown to emit 12.8 times lower CO2 as compared to the conventional extraction and refining processes. Various studies and the salient results from macroalgae pyrolysis are tabulated in Table 15 (ref. 179, 230, 232, 233 and 236–242).

The bio-char obtained from macroalgae is rich in minerals, and can be used in wastewater purification, soil amendment, and catalyst preparation. In a recent study, bio-char from pyrolysis of iron-loaded Cladophora glomerata was proposed as a potential material for lithium-ion batteries.235 The use of an iron catalyst increased the selectivity to furan derivatives from 2.25 to 14%, and hydrogen was also produced in significant quantity. The bio-char had a high surface area (264 m2 g−1). The bio-char was used as an anode in a Li-ion battery, and its efficiency increased. After 500 charges, the capacity retention was 91% for magnetic bio-char as compared to 62% for bio-char. Pyrolysis of macroalgae is also a potential option to produce syngas. Gautam et al.233 and Hong et al.179 reported significant production of syngas from the macroalgae pyrolysis process. A fundamental understanding of macroalgae pyrolysis can be developed by employing surrogate compounds, and studying their kinetics and transformations. Detailed studies on the use of tailored catalysts to obtain selective production of chemicals and syngas are also necessary.
3. Hydrothermal liquefaction
Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) is different from pyrolysis in terms of operating conditions and chemistry, and overcomes the limitation of dry feed for the reactor. As drying of the feedstock for pyrolysis is an energy-intensive step, which also affects the process economics, HTL serves as a promising technique for the conversion of wet algae in a single step. The conversion of organic matter present in algae takes place at moderate temperatures (250–350 °C) and at high pressures (12–20 MPa). The energy equal to the heat of vaporization is not required to be supplied, as drying of the feedstock is not required. At these temperatures and high pressures, near-supercritical conditions are approached, and the resistance due to interphase mass transfer is mitigated. The ionic product of water increases, while its dielectric constant decreases substantially at these elevated temperatures and pressures. The low dielectric constant facilitates the breaking of H–H bonds and favors the solubility of compounds with low polarity. The high ionic product of water is responsible for the acid- and base-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions to deconstruct the biomass constituents into smaller organic molecules. This deconstruction of biomass under critical conditions produces bio-crude, gas, and solid residue. In other words, HTL is also known as thermochemical liquefaction and hydrous pyrolysis.
In a typical batch HTL process, the required amounts of algae and solvent are added to an autoclave reactor that is designed to handle high pressures and temperatures. The reactor is initially pressurized using an inert gas, and heated up. The initial pressure depends on the final pressure and temperature to be attained. After holding the reactor for a specified amount of time, the reaction is stopped by quenching the reaction mixture. The organic product is a kerogen-like mixture of bio-crude and solid residue (also called as char), and the gases are usually collected during the de-pressurization step to analyze their composition. The kerogen-like mixture is subjected to physical and chemical separation processes such as gravity settling, filtration and solvent extraction to recover the bio-crude and the char as two separate products. The solvent that is added initially to the algae sample can be either water or a water–organic solvent mixture. Generally, the aqueous-rich solvent phase contains dissolved organics. This offers opportunity on a larger scale operation to (a) recover hydrogen from the aqueous phase via steam reforming, or (b) re-use the organic-rich aqueous phase as a solvent in subsequent HTL operations.
HTL of microalgae is seen as an attractive process economically as well as from the environmental viewpoint. This is because, under subcritical conditions, water serves as an green solvent medium for the reaction. HTL can convert the whole organic content in the algae to high energy density products.243 One of the advantages of HTL in the case of algae is that the nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, utilized by the algae for their growth, can be recycled back.244 Bio-crude yields from HTL of algae are higher, and the overall energy consumption is low owing to the elimination of the drying step. The quality of the bio-crude in terms of oxygen content is better from HTL of algae as compared to pyrolysis bio-oil. Jena and Das245 compared pyrolysis and HTL of Spirulina platensis, and found 41% enhancement in the liquid yield along with 82% reduction of solid residues in the case of HTL as compared to pyrolysis. Guo et al.246 extensively reviewed the HTL of algae for the production of bio-oil including the operating parameters that affect the process. The production of biofuels via hydrothermal technologies was reviewed by Peterson et al.247 The same article elucidates the chemistry of sub- and supercritical water conditions on the conversion of biomass. Owing to the chemistry of the process, it can be concluded that HTL results in a higher liquid yield with a lower amount of char as compared to pyrolysis. As algae are complex species composed of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and various pigments, a thorough understanding of the decomposition of the individual components is vital.
3.1. Hydrothermal conversion of various components of algae
The primary components present in algae are responsible for the composition of the products, viz., bio-crude, solid residue, and gases. In order to correlate the composition of the bio-crude with that of the biochemical constituents in the algae, studies focusing on the chemistry of model compounds under hydrothermal conditions is foreseen. In addition to experiments, the models that predict the composition and yield of bio-crude are to be developed. There are a few studies which address these issues.248–250 In one of the fundamental studies by Xie et al.,251 the phase behavior of microalga, Dunaliella tertiolecta, was understood by using model compounds, viz., soya protein, glycine, starch, glucose, xylose, stearic acid and palmitic acid, in HTL. A fraction of organics produced during HTL of algae is soluble in the aqueous phase. The extraction of organics from the aqueous phase would enhance the actual yield of bio-crude. Madsen et al.252 used principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression to predict the chemical composition of the aqueous phase obtained from HTL of algae. To develop a thorough understanding of HTL of complex species such as algae, the decomposition of each component in terms of their mass and energy distribution in the products is important. The following subsections discuss the behavior of algae components during HTL.

3.1.1. Proteins. 
Microalgae are rich in proteins as compared to lipids and carbohydrates (Table 1), while macroalgae are rich in carbohydrates (Table 2). Proteins are macromolecules with amino acids as the repeating units. It is important to understand the amino acid profile of micro- and macroalgae species. Phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, threonine, valine, serine, and threonine are the major amino acids present in microalgae species.253 In a review by Harnedy and FitzGerald254 amino acids from macroalgae species are also reported. Apart from the aforementioned amino acids, proline, tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine are present in macroalgae species. During HTL of algae, these amino acids get converted to several compounds including the nitrogen-containing compounds in the bio-crude as well as in the gas phase and char. In order to understand the fate of nitrogen during HTL, studying the behavior of proteins model compounds is necessary.
HTL of five different amino acids, viz., alanine, leucine, phenylalanine, serine, and aspartic acid, was performed in the temperature range of 200–340 °C and pressure of 20 MPa.255 Alanine produced ethylamine, carbonic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and acetic acid in addition to the evolution of ammonia. Serine decomposition resulted in glycine, glycolic acid, alanine, pyruvic acid, and lactic acid. Aspartic acid produced fumaric acid, pyruvic acid, ammonia, maleic acid, and malic acid. Protein decomposition during HTL takes place via reactions such as decarboxylation, deamination, transamination, hydrogen addition along with hydrolysis and dehydration. Serine underwent retro-aldol condensation to produce glycine and formaldehyde. It is well understood that complex amino acids present in the proteins can produce other simpler amino acids and low molecular weight compounds such as formaldehyde.
The two most important conversion pathways of amino acids are deamination and decarboxylation. Vallentyne256 studied the thermal decomposition of amino acids under subcritical water conditions. Aliphatic amino acids such as glycine and alanine underwent decarboxylation to form respective amines. Hydroxyl amino acids such as serine and threonine get converted to simple amino acids such as proline, glycine and alanine. Sulfur-containing amino acids like methionine, and basic amino acids like arginine also get converted into simple amino acids. A di-acidic amino acid, like aspartic acid, undergoes deamination to produce malic acid. Bovine serum albumin is often used as a surrogate to understand the thermochemical behavior of proteins.134,257 At 310 °C and 25 MPa, HTL of bovine serum albumin produced amino acids and CO2. In addition, low carbon chain compounds including alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols were produced. In the gas phase, apart from CO2, CO, methane, and hydrogen were also detected. During HTL, there is a high possibility that decarboxylation and deamination pathways compete with each other to form products. This is also reported in the literature.255,258,259


3.1.2. Lipids. 
Microalgae are rich in lipids as compared to macroalgae (Tables 1 and 2). The production of bio-crude via HTL is favored when the lipid content is high in the algae. It was concluded from the HTL of different algae species by Biller and Ross260 that the bio-crude yield followed the trend: lipid-rich algae > protein-rich algae > carbohydrate-rich algae. To understand the behavior of lipids during HTL, studies have been conducted using fatty acids and fatty acid esters under sub- and supercritical conditions. In a review by Changi et al.,248 the HTL of lipids and lipid model compounds is reported.
Soybean, linseed, and coconut oils, when treated under sub-critical conditions (T = 260–280 °C), result in the degradation of fatty acids via thermal decomposition, isomerization, and depolymerization.261 The occurrence of isomerization reaction was ascertained by the presence of cis and trans isomers in the products. Similar isomerized products under subcritical conditions from soybean oil were observed by King et al.262 The fatty acid produced from the hydrolysis of oil was observed to autocatalyze the hydrolysis under subcritical conditions.263 According to Biller and Ross,260 the acylglycerides degrade into their constituent fatty acids during HTL. Hydrolysis of sunflower oil (77 wt% triglycerides, 20 wt% diglycerides, and 2.5 wt% monoglycerides) under subcritical conditions was carried out.264 Triglycerides get converted to fatty acid and diglyceride, diglyceride converts to fatty acid and monoglyceride, and monoglyceride converts to fatty acid and glycerol. It is well understood that fatty acids are hydrolysis products of acylglycerides. The decomposition of fatty acids under subcritical conditions takes place at temperatures >300 °C.265 The saturated fatty acids like stearic acid and palmitic acid are shown to be very stable under HTL conditions, and they do not undergo decarboxylation.266,267 Long-chain fatty acids (>C16) are more stable than small chain fatty acids (<C12) under hydrothermal conditions.


3.1.3. Carbohydrates. 
There are several studies on the hydrolysis of polysaccharides such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch. The crystallinity of cellulose makes it insoluble in water under neutral pH conditions. Cellulose hydrolysis takes place under subcritical conditions, and leads to the formation of low-molecular-weight compounds. Depolymerization of cellulose was studied by Cantero et al.268 around critical conditions of water. It was found that the activation energies obtained were consistent with literature for the conversion of cellulose to glucose, and its subsequent conversion to fructose. The final product was 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF). It was also concluded in the same study that, due to the low density and ionic product of the reaction medium, the production of 5-HMF was retarded. It is worthwhile to mention that under supercritical conditions, mass transfer effects do not play a role, which results in high rate constants for hydrolysis.
The amorphous polysaccharide, hemicellulose, is composed of monomers such as D-xylose, L-arabinose, D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-mannose, and is easier to dissolve in water as compared to cellulose. There is evidence in the literature that hemicellulose can be completely fragmented and dissolved at 220 °C in water.269 Furfural and its derivatives are the major products from the decomposition of xylose present in hemicellulose. This is discussed in the review by Ruiz et al.270 Macroalgae are also considered to be a rich source of polysaccharides.271 The presence of polysaccharides with β-1,6-glycosidic linkages cannot be ruled out. This results in the formation of furfural and 5-HMF, and its further decomposition would yield low-molecular weight oxygenated compounds.
Dehydration is the predominant reaction for the fragmentation of carbohydrates. In addition, retro-aldol reaction, and Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda-van Ekenstein transformation are also found to be prevalent.272,273 The reactions of the individual components are responsible for the formation of a wide variety of products from HTL of micro- and macroalgae. Importantly, the presence of all three compounds simultaneously results in the formation of chemicals due to the interactions among the components. HTL of individual model compounds and their various combinations will certainly furnish valuable insights on the mechanism and chemistry of HTL.

3.2. Bio-crude composition from HTL of algae
There are a number of algae species that have been investigated for their potential to produce bio-crude via HTL. This section discusses the organic compounds present in the bio-crude obtained from HTL of algae along with the identified gases. HTL of Nannochloropsis sp. at 8 MPa and 300 °C for 30 min resulted in long-chain alkanes, fatty acids, N-containing heterocyclic compounds, and fatty amides.274 In another study, protein-rich species, Spirulina, was subjected to HTL at 290 °C and 22.5 MPa.275 The compounds were categorized into: hydrocarbons, nitriles, carboxylic acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones, amides, amines, and alcohols. The major compounds in the bio-crude included heptadecane (9.74%), heptadecanitrile (14.1%), hexadecanoic acid (3.74%) and acetamide (21.6%). It can be understood that there are interactions between products from proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. For instance, the formation of nitriles can take place in the following sequence: fatty acids (from lipids) react with ammonium ions (from proteins) to yield fatty amides, which further dehydrate to yield fatty nitriles at high pressures. The decarboxylation of fatty acids results in the formation of long-chain hydrocarbons.
Lipid- and protein-rich microalgae species, Galdieria sulphuraria and Nannochloropsis salina, respectively, were subjected to HTL in a batch reactor in the temperature range of 310–350 °C.276 The protein-rich alga resulted in a low bio-crude yield. The major fatty acids in the bio-crude from Nannochloropsis salina were palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic, elaidic, and stearic acids, whereas, from Galdieria sulphuraria, linolelaidic, linoleic, palmitic and stearic acids were identified. An understanding of the HTL of low-lipid algae was developed using crude polysaccharides and proteins (extracted from algae).277 The control experiments were performed with proteins and polysaccharides. At 300 °C, crude polysaccharides resulted in the production of phenols (12.8 area%) and cyclic ketones (∼49 area%). The formation of pyrazines (45.3 area%) was highest followed by pyrroles (15.8 area%) and amines (10 area%). The 40:60 mixture of polysaccharide:protein resulted in the reduction of phenols (12.8 area%) and cyclic ketones (17.7 area%). This can be attributed to the Maillard reaction between the carbonyl group present in carbohydrates with the amine group present in proteins. The Maillard reaction products include pyridines and pyrroles. Importantly, the contribution of proteins was higher than that of polysaccharides for the formation of bio-crude. It was also observed that Maillard reactions inhibited the production of bio-crude.
A brown macroalga, Sargassum tenerrimum, was subjected to HTL in the temperature range of 260–300 °C.39 The bio-crude from macroalgae contains different functional groups such as acids, alcohols, aldehydes, amines, esters, hydrocarbons, ketones, N-containing heterocyclic compounds, and phenols. At 280 °C, 3-pyridinol (16.21 area%), 1-6-dimethylnaphthalene (3.05 area%), p-hydroxybiphenyl (5.11 area%) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (15.05 area%) were the major compounds in the bio-crude. On similar lines of microalgae, reactions such as decarboxylation, dehydration, deamination, depolymerization and decomposition are important for the production of the aforementioned compounds from macroalgae. HTL of Gracilaria gracilis and Cladophora glomerata was performed at 350 °C.278 2-Furancarboxaldehyde (7.73 area%) was the only carbohydrate-derived product in the bio-crude from Cladophora glomerata, whereas cycloketones (19.62 area%) were produced from Gracilaria gracilis. For Gracilaria gracilis, the selectivity to products from lipids and carbohydrates was highest (19.5%). The selectivity to products from the combination of carbohydrates and proteins (20.75%) and lipids alone (20.5%) was highest for Cladophora glomerata as compared to Gracilaria gracilis. While the formation of products can be traced to the basic reactions discussed earlier, it can be inferred that the reaction pathways are different in different algae species. This is attributed to the dissimilarity in lipid and protein profiles of these species.
Polysaccharides undergo successive dehydration to produce low-molecular weight carbonyl compounds. C–C bond cleavage, cyclization, and dehydration reactions produce cyclic ketones and diketones. The production of phenols can be traced to the ring-opening and dehydration reactions. Hydrolysis of proteins results in their fragmentation into amino acids. These amino acids undergo decarboxylation to form amines. Cyclization and condensation reactions result in the formation of N-containing cyclic compounds. Deamination of amino acids releases ammonium ions in the system, and amination of carboxylic acids produces amides, which dehydrate to form nitriles. Aliphatic hydrocarbons are produced as a result of decarboxylation reactions of carboxylic acids produced from the lipids.
3.3. HTL of microalgae
This section discusses the HTL of various microalgae from the perspective of bio-crude yield. The application of various catalysts to improve the quality of the bio-crude is also discussed. The first study on HTL of algae was reported by Dote et al.279 in 1994, and the alga investigated was Botryococcus braunii. The development of thermochemical conversion technologies for algae has incited comparisons between pyrolysis and HTL. However, it is needless to say that the two conversion pathways are entirely different mechanistically, and cannot be compared without accounting for the utilization of end products. Pyrolysis offers operational convenience in terms of producing chemicals selectively, whereas HTL provides better deoxygenation. Nevertheless, both can be advantageous depending on the type of algae species to be treated. Hognon et al.280 compared pyrolysis with HTL of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and found that the HHV of the bio-crude/bio-oil increased with an increase in temperature during both HTL and pyrolysis. The energy recovery in HTL bio-crude was 66–90% in the temperature range of 220–310 °C, whereas the energy recovery from pyrolysis bio-oil was 73–83% (in 400–550 °C). Interestingly, the aqueous phase obtained from HTL can be used for the cultivation of the microalgae. This is because, the dissolved organics in the aqueous phase can serve as nutrients for microalgae growth. A comprehensive study on the HTL of 9 different strains from 4 different microalgae species, viz., Chlorella sp., Nannochloropsis sp., Pavlova sp., and Scenedesmus sp., was carried out at 280 and 320 °C.281 For all the HTL experiments, an increase in temperature from 280 to 320 °C increased the bio-crude yield. A highly accurate regression model for the prediction of the bio-crude yield, based on the protein, lipid, and carbohydrate content in the microalgae species, was developed. The highest bio-crude yield (66 wt%) was obtained from the Nannochloropsis sp. strain. In all the bio-crudes, the major organics were in the vacuum gas oil range. Cheng et al.276 performed HTL of Galdieria sulphuraria and Nannochloropsis salina, and the bio-crude yields correlated well with the lipid content of both microalgae species. In the temperature range of 310–350 °C, the bio-crude yields from low-lipid containing alga, Galdieria sulphuraria, were 23–30 wt%. The yields of bio-crude from Nannochloropsis salina were found to be in the range of 44–58 wt%.
A sequential two-step HTL (THTL) system was developed to investigate the production of bio-crude with improved properties from Coelastrum sp.282 The bio-crude yield was maximized by operating in two stages, viz., the first step (200 °C, 7 MPa, 2 h) and the second step (320 °C, 20 MPa, 2 h). The overall bio-crude yield was ∼32 wt%. Pre-treatment of the feed can also increase the yield of bio-crude. Zhang et al.283 assessed the effect of ultrasonic pre-treatment on HTL of Spirulina platensis. It was found that the ultrasound power did not influence the bio-crude yield at a constant temperature, whereas an increase in the pre-treatment time reduced the bio-crude yield. At 300 °C and 2 min pretreatment time, 50 wt% bio-crude was obtained. A low energy cell disruption pre-treatment approach using NaOH/urea solvent was developed by Hu et al.284 to enhance the bio-crude yield from HTL of Spirulina. The yield was enhanced to 26 wt% from 22 wt%, and the flow properties of the bio-crude were enhanced.284 A recent review by Mathimani and Mallick285 presents various studies on HTL of microalgae species with a focus on the effect of operating parameters on bio-crude yields.
The complex chemical composition of microalgae species, especially the presence of nitrogen and oxygen in significant quantities, restricts the direct use of bio-crude derived from it as a fuel. The removal of oxygen and nitrogen from bio-crude is essential for it to be used as a drop-in fuel substitute. Integrating a technology like vacuum distillation (VD) with a bio-crude production unit can be beneficial to improve the quality of bio-crude. Eboibi et al.286 used the VD process to improve the quality of the bio-crude obtained from HTL of Spirulina and Tetraselmis. The VD process for Spirulina reduced nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur by 45%, 84%, and 60%, respectively. For Tetraselmis, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur were reduced by 32%, 97%, and 33%, respectively. Catalysts are also useful to remove nitrogen and oxygen from the bio-crude. Duan and Savage287 screened six different catalysts, viz., Pd/C, Pt/C, Ru/C, Ni/SiO2–Al2O3, CoMo/γ-Al2O3 (sulfided) and zeolites, for catalytic HTL of Nannochloropsis. HTL was performed in an inert (He) and high pressure reducing H2 environment at 350 °C. The hydrogen atmosphere enhanced the bio-crude yield without catalysts from 35 wt% to 45 wt%. The elemental composition of bio-crude was not very much different when the catalysts were used. However, in the bio-crude obtained using Ni/SiO2–Al2O3, sulfur was below detectable limits. The use of Ru/C resulted in high production of CH4 in the gas fraction. To improve the quality of bio-crude, separate catalytic processing of bio-crude is usually performed.288,289 Bio-crude from HTL of Nannochloropsis was upgraded using the Pt/C catalyst with HCl and NaOH in an inert as well as H2 atmosphere.288 The best quality in terms of low total acid number (25 mg mg−1KOH) and high HHV (43 MJ kg−1) was obtained using Pt/C catalyst in H2 environment. In another study, Duan and Savage289 used Pt/C, Mo2C, and HZSM-5 as catalysts to upgrade the bio-crude. It was found that the O/C ratio and HHV are affected by the catalyst ratio, while N/C and H/C ratios are influenced by reaction time. At 430 °C, the bio-crudes obtained had HHVs around 42 MJ kg−1.
The H/C ratio of bio-crude from HTL of Nannochloropsis was enhanced by almost 7% when upgraded with Ru/C and Pt/C catalysts.290 A reduction of ∼97% in total acid number of the upgraded bio-crude was observed with these catalysts. Apart from zeolites, noble metals, and transition metal catalysts, other catalysts were also used with different microalgae species. In situ catalytic treatment of three different species, viz., Nannochloropsis, Pavlova, and Isochrysis, with an alkaline catalyst, Na2CO3, was reported.291 This alkaline catalyst favored the conversion of carbohydrates resulting in the high yield of bio-crude (∼47 wt%) from Pavlova. The bio-crude yields from these algae followed the same trend as the carbohydrate content in them: Pavlova (∼47 wt%) > Isochrysis (∼40 wt%) > Nannochloropsis (∼35 wt%). A nanocatalyst, Ni/SiO2, was used by Saber et al.292 to enhance the bio-crude yield from Nannochloropsis. A high bio-crude yield (30 wt%) was achieved at a low temperature of 250 °C. Importantly, the bio-crude yields were low when zeolites and Na2CO3 were used.
There are studies using homogeneous catalysts that are soluble in the solvent phase for enhancing the bio-crude yield from HTL of microalgae species. Acetic acid, formic acid and sulfuric acid have been tested for HTL of algae.244,293 The acid type and pH played an important role in the decomposition of microalgae species under HTL conditions. Yang et al.294 developed an understanding of algae decomposition using acids with model compounds and Chlorella vulgaris. Crude polysaccharides and proteins extracted from algae were chosen as the model compounds. The partial carbonization of the organics was attributed to low bio-crude yields. The chemical composition of the bio-crudes from proteins, polysaccharides and their mixtures were different. H/C ratios and HHVs were enhanced with the use of acid catalysts. Acid catalysts were observed to enhance the hydrolysis of cellulose, and increase its contribution in the bio-crude. Ce/HZSM-5 was tested for HTL of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. The bio-crude yield was enhanced from 33 wt% to 50 wt% with significant enhancement in the H/C ratio.295 From the above discussion, it can be inferred that most of the studies were on HTL of Nannochloropsis and Chlorella, which leaves a considerable scope to investigate the effect of catalysts on HTL of other microalgae species. For an extended reading on catalytic HTL, readers can refer to reviews by Xu et al.296 and Galadima and Muraza.297 The application of catalysts in HTL requires extensive research, especially with reference to catalyst life, catalyst recovery and regeneration, product selectivity, and economics.
3.4. HTL of macroalgae
Compared to microalgae, only few studies are available in the open literature on HTL of macroalgae. HTL of macroalgae, Chaetomorpha linum, was performed in an autoclave at temperatures of 250, 300, 350 and 395 °C. The maximum yield of bio-crude was obtained at 395 °C (80 mg g−1).298 Zhou et al.299 reported HTL of high ash (∼30 wt%) macroalga, Enteromorpha prolifera, in the temperature range of 220–320 °C. The highest bio-crude yield was reported at 300 °C (20.4 wt%). A comprehensive study on HTL of six different macroalgae species was carried out by Neuveux et al.300 Four marine water species were Derbesia tenuissima, Ulva ohnoi, Chaetomorpha linum and Cladophora coelothrix, and the two freshwater species were Cladophora vagabunda and Oedogonium sp. All six species were significantly different in their proximate, elemental, and biochemical compositions. The bio-crude yields were in the range of 9–26 wt%. Energy recovery in the bio-crude was 53% from Derbesia tenuissima, 54% from Ulva ohnoi, and 56% from Oedogonium sp. HTL of Enteromorpha prolifera was also performed by Yang et al.293 and Xu et al.,301 and the yields of bio-crude at 290 °C were 28.4 wt% and 32 wt%, respectively, from these two studies.294,302 The same macroalgae was also used for the production of polyols, using glycerol as a feedstock.
HTL of three different brown algae, viz., Fucus vesiculosus, Laminaria saccharina, and Alaria esculenta, was performed at 350 °C.303 The bio-crude yields followed the trend: Alaria esculenta (28 wt%) > Fucus vesiculosus (22 wt%) ∼ Laminaria saccharina (21 wt%). Raikova et al.39 reported HTL of 13 macroalgae species native to the United Kingdom, and obtained the highest bio-crude yield of 30 wt% from Ulva lactuca. HTL of Sargassum tenerrimum was also investigated for the production of bio-crude.41,304 The highest bio-crude yield was 16.3 wt% at 280 °C. In another study by Anastasakis and Ross,305 four brown macroalgae from UK coasts were selected, and their HTL was performed. The bio-crude yields obtained were in the range of 10–18 wt%, and HTL was found to give more output in terms of energy as compared to anaerobic digestion and fermentation of the same feedstocks. Compared to the HTL of microalgae, the bio-crude yields from macroalgae are relatively low. This is attributed to the low heating rates experienced by the feedstock during HTL and higher ash in macroalgae. The researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology have developed a fast hydrothermal liquefaction process.306,307 With a very high heating rate of 585 °C min−1, the maximum bio-crude yield from Laminaria saccharina at 350 °C was reported to be 79 wt% on dry ash free basis.306 The experimental and predicted yields matched well with the yields from the literature at different heating rates. The major compounds in the bio-crude were dodecyl acrylate (23.4 area%) and 2-2-methylenebis[6-(1,1-dimethyl)-4-methylphenol] (35.3 area%).304
Nitrogen and oxygen content in the bio-crude obtained from HTL of macroalgae are significant owing to their chemical and biochemical composition. The most primitive method employed to enhance the quality and quantity of bio-crude is the pretreatment of the feedstock. Neveux et al.308 pre-treated three different macroalgae species, viz., Derbesia, Ulva, and Oedogonium, to reduce nitrogen, sulfur, and ash. Nutrient starvation and washing were used as pretreatment methods. The nitrogen and sulfur content in the feedstock reduced by 51–59 wt% and 64–88 wt%, respectively. The use of catalysts is also shown to play a crucial role in reducing the oxygen and nitrogen-containing compounds in the bio-crude. As zeolites have been tested for pyrolysis as well as HTL of microalgae, they are the natural choice for HTL of macroalgae species. Ma et al.230 used ZSM-5, Y-zeolite and mordenite to investigate the catalytic HTL of Ulva prolifera. With ZSM-5 and Y-zeolite, the bio-crude yield was enhanced from 16.6 to ∼20 wt%. The selectivity to hydrocarbons increased by 2.5 times, while oxygen-containing compounds were reduced by half, which demonstrates significant deoxygenation with the use of catalyst.
The use of acids and bases as homogeneous catalysts is well demonstrated to improve the bio-crude yield from biomass and microalgae. The addition of 5 wt% of Na2CO3 to Enteromorpha prolifera marginally enhanced the bio-crude yield from ∼20 to 23 wt% at 300 °C.296 Interestingly, no change in bio-crude was observed when K2CO3 was used.301 When acidic catalysts like sulfuric acid and acetic acid were used,293 the oxygen and nitrogen content in the bio-crude were not significantly altered as compared to those obtained from non-catalytic HTL. In contrast to the carbonates of alkali metals, the use of NaOH and KOH showed promising results from the viewpoint of enhancement of quality and quantity of bio-crude.309 Catalytic HTL of Ulva prolifera resulted in a two-fold higher yield of bio-crude with NaOH and KOH catalysts. The highest reduction in oxygen content (∼50%), as compared to non-catalytic HTL, and high carbon content in the bio-crude (64.2%) were obtained using KOH.
Operating conditions such as temperature, time, and solvent significantly affect the bio-crude yield, its composition, and the yields of char and gases. It is important to understand the effects of these parameters in order to maximize resource and energy recovery from HTL of micro- and macroalgae. The subsequent sections will address the effects of various parameters on the HTL process.
3.5. Effect of operating parameters on HTL of algae

3.5.1. Temperature. 

Fig. 14 (ref. 274, 275, 283, 291, 293, 304 and 309–313) depicts the variation of bio-crude yield from HTL of various algae with temperature and processing time. In a typical HTL reactor, increasing the temperature leads to the autogenous development of pressure. It is understood that variation in temperature changes the properties of water during HTL, and it can be tailored for a better yield of bio-crude. It is clear from Fig. 14 that the bio-crude yields from macroalgae species are lower than that from microalgae species. For different species, the maximum bio-crude yield was observed at different temperatures. This effect can be attributed to the different composition of algae species. For most of the species reported in Fig. 14, the maximum bio-crude yield was observed to be in the temperature range of 280–350 °C. The complex composition results in the deconstruction of components in different temperature regimes. Therefore, it is important to understand the specific reactions dominating a particular temperature regime. According to Guo et al.,246 the optimum temperature range for HTL is between 250 and 370 °C.

Generally, as the temperature increases, the bio-crude yield increases to a maximum value, and then decreases. An increase in temperature provides the energy to break the biomolecules resulting in depolymerization. HTL reactions can be categorized into two stages, viz., depolymerization in the initial stage and repolymerization in the later stage, thereby promoting the formation of char. An interesting demarcation of process temperature ranges in HTL is presented in the literature.246 Hydrolysis of algae components occurs till 220 °C. Competition between hydrolysis and repolymerization reactions occurs in the temperature range of 220–375 °C, and gasification occurs beyond 375 °C. As the ionic product of water increases at 350 °C during HTL, it catalyzes the fragmentation of algae components to form bio-crude containing a wide variety of chemicals. In summary, depolymerization, condensation, and isomerization reactions occur around the critical point of water. Gasification occurs generally beyond the critical point of water, and reactions such as cracking, steam reforming, and enhanced decarboxylation of carboxyl groups present in amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids are favored. These reactions are well-substantiated in the literature, and the yield of the gas increases with increase in HTL temperature.230,291,304
It is also important to understand the variation in the composition of bio-crude at different HTL temperatures. Shakya et al.291 observed an increase in selectivity to phenolics from Nannochloropsis sp., Pavlova sp. and Isochrysis sp. as the temperature was increased from 250 to 350 °C. This can be attributed to the enhanced cyclization, deamination, and decarboxylation reactions of amino acids. The solid residue decreased with increase in temperature with a concomitant increase in the gas yield. In the bio-crude obtained from Spirulina platensis at 280, 320, and 350 °C, it was observed that the selectivity to overall hydrocarbons was invariant at 280 and 320 °C (both ∼38%), but it decreased to 30% at 350 °C.314 The cracking of bio-crude at high temperatures is responsible for the low selectivity to hydrocarbons. This is also justified by the significant reduction in selectivity to carboxylic acids owing to enhanced decarboxylation reactions at high temperatures. Generally, the selectivity to amides decreases as the temperature increases, and a concomitant increment in nitriles is observed. The formation of nitriles can be attributed to the dehydration of amides at high temperatures. The formation of phenolic compounds is also a salient characteristic at high temperatures. Biswas et al.304 observed a considerable change in the chemical shift in the range of 0.5–1.5 ppm in 1H NMR, and it followed the trend 65% protons (260 °C) > 59% protons (280 °C) > 55% protons (300 °C). The region corresponding to 0.5–1.5 ppm in the NMR represents alkane group protons in which aliphatic protons are attached to a carbon atom at a minimum distance of two bonds from a CC or a heteroatom (O or N). A detailed carbon number analysis of the products identified in the bio-crude would provide detailed insights on the onset as well as the dominance of condensation and cracking reactions. The effect of temperature on the product yields is also elucidated in the reviews by Guo et al.246 and Mathimani and Mallick.285


3.5.2. Time. 

Fig. 15 (ref. 309, 312 and, 314–318) depicts the effect of residence time on bio-crude yield from different algae species observed in the literature. The time for which the feed is subjected to HTL condition naturally affects the extent of conversion. The reaction time affects the economics of the process as it determines the total input heat energy supplied to the process. Residence time variation alters the quality and quantity of the products. Generally, a longer residence time can result in both repolymerization and cracking reactions, whereas a shorter residence time can maximize the bio-crude yield.
 Fig. 15  Effect of time on bio-crude yield from HTL of various algae species from the literature. 
HTL of Nannochloropsis sp. was performed at 350 °C in the residence time range of 15–60 min by Xu and Savage.315 Bio-crude yields were invariant (43–44 wt%), although the yield of water-insoluble bio-crude marginally increased from 38.2 wt% (10 min) to 40.5 wt% (60 min). At 300 °C and 9 MPa, the bio-crude yield was maximum at 30 min, and was low at 15 and 60 min.316 Dandamudi et al.317 attributed this to the condensation of the intermediates, which might eventually lead to the formation of char. Depending on the feedstock, it is generally observed that a longer residence time enhances the bio-crude yield only until a particular temperature. Typically, long residence time period reduces the bio-crude yield.318 For instance, the residence time was observed to have an effect on the bio-crude yield at temperatures lower than 220 °C.319 Different studies report different times to achieve maximum bio-crude yield. Considering Fig. 15, maximum bio-crude yields are obtained at around 30 min. Interestingly, in a study by Cheng et al.,276 variation of reaction time during the HTL of high- and low-lipid algae had no effect on the composition of the bio-crude.
In order to shorten the processing time, fast HTL was studied to achieve maximum bio-crude yields.306,320,321 Bach et al.306 achieved 350 °C in less than 40 s, and obtained a maximum bio-crude yield (∼79 wt%) at a residence time of 15 min. The heating rate also plays a significant role in determining the bio-crude yield. Savage and co-workers315 performed fast HTL of Nannochloropsis sp., and the total reaction time was less than a minute. The average heating rates during HTL were of the order of 230 °C min−1. The experiments were performed in the temperature range of 300–600 °C, and the reaction hold times were between 1 and 5 min. Within the first minute, a high yield of 66 wt% was achieved when the set temperature was 600 °C. In their reactor setup, the heating rate depended on the set temperature. When the set temperature was 300 °C, the temperature was achieved after 4 min, whereas when the set temperature was 600 °C, 300 °C was achieved at t ≈ 1.2 min. It is interesting to note that when the heating rates were moderate (∼70 °C min−1), the bio-crude yields increased with time, and followed the trend: 13 wt% (1 min) < 38 wt% (3 min) < 44 wt% (5 min). Fast HTL of Neochloris, Chlorella, and Botryococcus was also investigated by the same group.321 Bio-crude yields were observed to increase quickly between 15 and 45 s. Across the literature on HTL that focuses on the effect of time, the information on the types of organic compounds present in the bio-crude at different time periods is not available. Addressing this aspect in HTL would certainly result in fine-tuning the time and temperature for producing bio-crude of better quality. It is also worthwhile to mention that achieving fast heating rates are not possible in large scale set-ups that use large mass of algae sample due to heat and mass transfer limitations.


3.5.3. Solvent. 
From an environmental perspective, water as a solvent for HTL offers the advantage of being non-toxic and green. In addition, water is abundantly available and its use as a solvent is cost-effective. Owing to the high ionic product of water, it acts as an organic solvent under sub-critical conditions. Recyclability is also not a problem with water as a solvent. Under subcritical conditions, water is present in the liquid phase and offers a medium for better solubility of organic compounds released from algae. To enhance the quality of the bio-crude in a single cycle, the role of other organic solvents, either alone or as a co-solvent with water, was probed. The use of co-solvents such as glycerol, tetralin, and alcohols was proposed as they are potential hydrogen donating solvents. The generated hydrogen in the system would result in a reducing environment, and this results in better deoxygenation of bio-crude.
Valdez et al.322 investigated the effect of solvents of different polarities, viz., hexadecane, decane, hexane, cyclohexane, methoxycyclopentane, dichloromethane, and chloroform, on HTL of Nannochloropsis sp. at 350 °C. The highest bio-crude yield was obtained with decane and hexadecane, while the use of chloroform led to high yields of fatty acids. The solvents play a major role in the distribution of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen in the bio-crude and solid residues. In another study, Li et al.323 showed that the use of organic solvents reduced the viscosity of bio-crude obtained from biomass. Alcohols have certain advantages over water such as low critical temperature and pressure. Alcoholic solvents such as ethanol and methanol were used in HTL of Sargassum tenerrimum to enhance the quality of the bio-crude.304 HTL was performed in the temperature range of 260–300 °C. The bio-crude yields were high with methanol (22.8 wt%) and ethanol (23.8 wt%) as compared to that with only water (16.3 wt%). It is important to mention that the temperature and time have to be optimized with different types of solvents to maximize the bio-crude yield, and to produce valuable chemicals and fuel molecules. In HTL of macroalga, Ulva fasciata, the bio-crude yield in excess of 40 wt% was obtained with methanol and ethanol as solvents, as compared to water (11 wt%).324 It was observed that the use of alcohol as a solvent increased the aliphatic content in the bio-crude along with the formation of esters.
Zhang and Zhang325 systematically studied the effect of the ethanol–water co-solvent system on HTL of Chlorella pyrenoidosa. The bio-crude yields with pure water and pure ethanol were ∼45 wt% and ∼50 wt%, respectively, whereas, with the co-solvent system, the yield increased to ∼55 wt% with a substantial reduction in the solids (from ∼15 to 9.4 wt%). There was no noticeable variation in elemental composition of the bio-crude. This is a common observation throughout the literature dealing with co-solvent systems in HTL. The energy return on investment, defined as the ratio of energy recovered in the bio-oil to the energy required to heat the feedstock, increased from ∼5 to 8.5 when the co-solvent system was used. Esters increased (from ∼7 to 28 area%) in the bio-crude as the alcohol composition in the co-solvent system increased, whereas the ketone content was high (∼62 area%) in an equal proportion co-solvent system. It is important to mention that the critical point of the co-solvent system is generally high, and therefore, the conversions take place in the subcritical state. The reactions of the free radicals are limited, and the repolymerization reactions, which would increase the solid residue yields, are inhibited. Acetone and 1,4-dioxane were also used as solvents for HTL of macroalgae species.326,327Chlorella pyrenoidosa with acetone was used in the ratio of 2.5:4, and the maximum bio-crude yield of 60 wt% was obtained at 290 °C.326 Yuan et al.327 investigated the effect of polar protic (methanol and ethanol) and dipolar aprotic (1,4-dioxane) solvents in HTL of Spirulina. The behavior of 1,4-dioxane was significantly different as compared to that of alcohols. The bio-crude yields were low with 1,4-dioxane, and high selectivity to fatty (C16, C18) nitriles (∼27%) was observed. The alcohols promoted the formation of esters in the bio-crude.
In a continuous HTL set-up, n-heptane, toluene, and anisole were investigated as co-solvents for freshwater macroalga, Oedogonium.328 These solvents aided the fractionation of the bio-crude. Polar components were separated with the aqueous phase, whereas less polar components were isolated in the organic solvent phase. Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and ethylene glycol were used as solvents in HTL of high ash-containing Tetraselmis sp.311 The use of IPA enhanced the yield of bio-crude (from ∼ 30 to 35 wt%) at 350 °C. Ethylene glycol generally did not have any effect on the bio-crude yield. Based on the 1H-NMR analysis of the bio-crude, both ethylene glycol and IPA resulted in a similar composition with enrichment in aliphatics. The interpretation of the high aliphatic yield can be linked to the ease of these solvents to donate hydrogen, and this subsequently promotes hydrodeoxygenation. The use of IPA resulted in high gas yield with propene as the major gas, whereas CO2 was the major gas with ethylene glycol.
In a series of studies by Chen et al.,329,330 amines were used as solvents to produce acids from HTL of macroalga Undaria pinnatifida. At 200 °C, with trimethyl amine as the solvent, the mass yields of glyoxylic acid, glycolic acid, formic acid, lactic acid, and acetic acid were 8.57, 5.21, 6.65, 7.88 and 4.70%, respectively.329 Trimethyl amine is shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of the carbohydrate fraction in the macroalga under mild conditions. H-Bonding and ether linkages present in the carbohydrates are weakened in the presence of trimethyl amine owing to the coordination of the hydroxyl ion.329 A specific mechanism, called peeling mechanism, was proposed for the degradation of carbohydrates. Peeling reactions involve the interaction of trimethyl amine with cellulose on the surface or at the ends. In one of the studies by Chen et al.,330 the effects of different hydrophilic amines on the bio-crude yield and quality were studied for HTL of Undaria pinnatifida. It is interesting to note that even at a temperature of 160 °C, 24 wt% bio-crude was produced with triethyl amine. The steric hindrance offered by large amines was found to be inversely proportional to the amount of acids in the bio-crude. The yield of acids decreased with increase in length of the alkyl chain. The use of co-solvents reduces the temperature significantly, which translates to low energy requirements and low operational costs. Further downstream processing of bio-crude via fractionation is a viable option to enhance the quality.

3.6. Reaction mechanism and kinetics of HTL of algae
The salient reactions and interconversions of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates are presented in Fig. 16. Understanding the reactions in detail is vital to tune the quality of biocrude for different applications. It is evident that the nature of amino acids plays a decisive role in the production of protein-derived compounds in the bio-crude. Sato et al.255 described the behavior of amino acids and their conversion under subcritical conditions. Cyclic amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, under HTL conditions, result in indole, ethylphenol, and styrene, respectively. Other aliphatic amino acids like aspartic acid, alanine, serine, and glycine undergo reactions such as decarboxylation and deamination to produce fumaric acid, malic acid, pyruvic acid, formic acid, and formaldehyde.
 Fig. 16  Reactions and interconversions involved in HTL of (a) various amino acids, (b) triglycerides and (c) carbohydrates. 
Lipids exist in the form of triglycerides in algae species. These easily get hydrolyzed during HTL, and the lipid amount directly translates to the bio-crude yield. HTL of triglycerides yield glycerol and three different fatty acids. These fatty acids can undergo decarboxylation and produce aliphatic hydrocarbons. Carbohydrates are low in microalgae but are present in significant amounts in macroalgae. Therefore, an understanding of the decomposition of carbohydrates is vital. Low molecular weight oxygenates and furfurals are characteristic products of carbohydrate decomposition. The formation of products due to interactions between the biochemical components of algae cannot be ignored and should be understood in detail. Maillard reactions between the carboxyl group of carbohydrates and the amino group of proteins result in N-containing heteroatomic cyclic compounds.331 These reactions are elucidated in Fig. 16.
There are limited studies available on the kinetic analysis of HTL of algae. The knowledge of kinetics is important for the prediction of reactions and product yields under different operating conditions. Reaction kinetic analysis of amino acid decomposition in water at high-temperature and high-pressure was performed by Sato et al.255 The change in concentration of amino acids was measured as a function of time, and the reaction was assumed to be first order. The activation energies (in kJ mol−1) of decomposition of glycine, alanine, serine, and aspartic acid were determined to be 166, 154, 149, and 148, respectively. Based on the kinetic data, it was proposed that the main reactions include decarboxylation to form carbonic acid and amines, and deamination to produce ammonia and organic acids. A detailed kinetic model for HTL of microalgae was developed by Savage and co-workers.332 In this study, the experimental data from the HTL of Chlorella protothecoides, Scenedesmus sp., and Nannochloropsis sp. were considered. The model was modified from the one developed by Valdez and Savage to estimate the kinetic parameters for HTL of Nannochloropsis sp.333 The reaction scheme involved microalgae getting converted to aqueous phase products, light bio-crude, and heavy bio-crude. The detailed kinetic model by Savage and co-workers333 considers the biochemical constituents. This lumped model provides the time evolution of bio-crude, solids, and gases, for all three microalgae species. The detailed model was well simplified by combining the light and heavy bio-crude fractions into one lump. The kinetic model predicted that algae rich in lipids and proteins result in higher bio-crude yields than algae species that are carbohydrate-rich. The prediction was in line with the experimental observations reported by a number of HTL studies on algae.
The correctness of the above-discussed models332,333 was investigated by Sheehan and Savage.334 A lumped model representing the conversion of microalgae to various products was proposed involving the following reactions: (Proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) → Aqueous phase products → Gas(9) (Proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) → Bio-crude → Gas(10) Bio-crude ↔ Aqueous phase products(11)
The model was validated by predicting the bio-crude yields from different experimental studies. 70 bio-crude yields from 12 different studies were predicted with a variation of ±5 wt%. The reaction network was used to determine the kinetic parameters and estimate the product yields from HTL of Aurantiochytrium sp. KRS101.335 Activation energies to produce bio-crude from proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates were determined to be 38.9, 33, and 45.5 kJ mol−1. The values of activation energies show that the lipid fraction decomposes easily, thus contributing to significant bio-crude yields under HTL conditions. Further to this, the highest bio-crude yield predicted by the model was 56 wt% at 450 °C and 5 min against the experimental yield of 51 wt% at 400 °C and 10 min. Vo et al.336 used a combination of models used by Valdez et al.332 and Valdez and Savage333 for better prediction of product yields from Tetraselmis sp. The reaction network is depicted in Fig. 17. The conversion of the individual biochemical components, viz., proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, to aqueous-phase products, light bio-crude and heavy bio-crude was considered as separate reactions with individual rate constants. It can be inferred that there are 17 reaction pathways with 17 rate constants. All the reactions are assumed to be first-order in the model. The rate constants associated with protein, lipid, and carbohydrate conversion are represented as p, l, and c, respectively, in the subscript. The application of the kinetic rate equation to each reaction would result in the following coupled ordinary differential equations:

Lipids: (13)
Carbohydrates: (14)
Aqueous phase products: (15)
Light oil products: (16)
Heavy oil products: (17)
Gaseous products: (18)
In eqn (12)–(18), x1,p, x1,l, x1,c, x2, x3, x4, and x5 represent the mass fractions of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, aqueous phase products, light oil products, heavy oil products and gaseous products, respectively. The relationship between the total solid fraction and mass fractions of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrate is given as x1,p + x1,l + x1,c = x1. The ordinary differential equations given in (12)–(18) were solved, and the rate constants were determined using the least-squares objective function. This quantitative model unraveled that the dominant reaction pathways were the production of the aqueous phase and bio-crude from microalgae during the first few minutes, while at longer residence times the product conversion was dominant. Moreover, the conversion of the aqueous phase to gases was found to have an activation energy of ∼95 kJ mol−1, which suggests that this conversion pathway was difficult.
A kinetic model for fast HTL of the microalgae, Nannochloropsis sp. was developed by Savage and co-workers.337 The similar lumped approach was extended to model the fast HTL of microalgae species. The average heating rates were in the range of 110–350 °C min−1, and the reaction time was in the range of 10 s–60 min between 100 and 400 °C. The model was successfully developed to predict kinetics and product yields at short timescales of 10 s–10 min. 46 wt% bio-crude yield was predicted at 400 °C within a reaction time of 1 min. The experimental yields at the same temperature were 25 wt%, 38 wt%, 40 wt%, and 45 wt% at reaction times corresponding to 0.83, 1.5, 2.12, and 3.43 min, respectively. It is well understood that protein is a major component of microalgae species, and a better understanding of the kinetics of protein decomposition under isothermal fast HTL conditions is necessary. Luo et al.338 studied the product and kinetics of isothermal HTL of soy protein concentrate. It is worthwhile to mention that the rate constants obtained for the HTL of proteins from previous models (employed for microalgae biomass) were not applicable for pure proteins. The experimental data showed that the bio-crude yield increased with an increase in time and temperature. It was found that the bio-crude yields from proteins were overpredicted by the earlier models, and this model utilized a new reaction network to predict the bio-crude yield. The reaction network assumed the conversion of proteins to the aqueous phase, which reversibly produces bio-crude and gas. Sheehan and Savage339 developed a different reaction network for the prediction of the kinetics of fast HTL of soy protein (Fig. 18). This model was better as it included the conversion of proteins to bio-crude. The apparent kinetic parameters justified the solid protein conversion to aqueous phase products, gas and bio-crude with activation energies (in kJ mol−1) of 56, 72, and 68, respectively.

In a recent study, Obeid et al.340 postulated reaction pathways using algae model compounds. Different reaction networks were assumed for proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and lignin. At high temperatures, the model was able to predict the yields very closely. The dominant pathways for lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins were the aqueous phase to renewable crude, the aqueous phase to gas, and the aqueous phase to renewable crude, respectively. The optimum reaction parameters were different for different components and a lumped kinetic model was developed to predict the yields from HTL of algae model compounds. It can be summarized that the kinetic models developed for HTL of algae have used a similar lumped framework. More detailed model compound-based studies can pave the way to develop robust kinetic models.
3.7. Life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis
It is important to note that the exploitation of algae for energy alone may not be an economical option. Algae-based processes can become energy efficient and economically viable if the production of value-added intermediates for pharmaceuticals and cosmetics is also focused. Dutta et al.341 found that lipid extraction contributes to significant greenhouse gas emissions and fossil energy consumption, and better solvent recovery is the key to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases. Bennion et al.125 performed LCA of HTL and pyrolysis processes compared HTL with pyrolysis on the life cycle assessment front. A parameter, net energy ratio (NER), was devised as a marker for energy efficiency, which was the ratio of energy consumed to energy produced. NER < 1 means the process is favorable. HTL resulted in NER of 1.27 as against 2.27 for pyrolysis. The drying of algae was the major environmental implication in the case of pyrolysis, which is not required in HTL. Fortier et al.342 compared the impacts of the HTL process installed at a wastewater treatment plant and a refinery using LCA. The environmental impacts were low in the case of bio-crude produced at the wastewater treatment plant as compared to that at a refinery site owing to the associated logistics for transporting the dry algae. The greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 76% for HTL at the wastewater treatment plant as compared to the emissions from burning conventional jet fuel.
Techno-economic analysis of the production of liquid fuel from algae cultivated in wastewater integrated with a hydroprocessing unit was reported by Ranganathan and Savithri.343 A detailed sensitivity analysis suggested that the minimum selling price of the bio-crude depended on factors such as the bio-crude yield and nitrogen concentration in the wastewater. The minimum selling price was estimated to be USD 4.3 per gasoline gallon equivalent. Connelly et al.344 stated that the algae biofuels from HTL reduced the lifecycle greenhouse gas emission by 50% as compared to petroleum fuels under certain conditions. However, it is important to mention that the results are highly sensitive to CO2 supplied to grow the algae and its generation from the fuels produced from it. Mu et al.345 performed LCA of biofuel production from algae via three different techniques viz., HTL, hydrothermal hydrolysis pretreatment + HTL (HTP), and wet lipid extraction. The study was combined with a cost analysis to assess the economic aspects. By deploying HTP, NOx emissions were reduced by 10% as compared to HTL. Moreover, the per-gallon cost of fuel produced from HTP was lower than that from HTL. Overall, integrating hydrothermal hydrolysis pretreatment with HTL emerged as a possible economic method for NOx reduction. In addition, it is also evident that the nitrogen-containing compounds (from algae cultivation), which are deemed to be fertilizers, are discharged. A perspective on the commercialization of algae-to-fuel is available in the review by Bhujade et al.346 To put into perspective, algae certainly can be a renewable source of fuels and chemicals when multiple conversion steps are integrated while designing the overall conversion process.
4. Concluding remarks and scope for future work
This comprehensive review unequivocally shows that both microalgae and macroalgae are potential feedstocks for the production of valuable chemicals and fuel molecules via thermochemical technologies. Considering the wide variety of algae species of different elemental and biochemical compositions, it is straightforward to employ thermochemical technologies like pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction to produce valuable liquid oil-stocks in a single or few steps. Among the different forms of pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis is a promising technique to produce a significant yield of bio-oil. The existing studies show that algae bio-oil is certainly better in terms of physicochemical properties than bio-oil from lignocellulosic biomass. Importantly, algae pyrolysis yields a significant amount of aliphatic hydrocarbons owing to the decomposition of the lipid fraction in them. However, the organic nitrogen in algae bio-oil is significant, and this needs to be subjected to a catalytic hydrodenitrogenation process for its use as a fuel, both for stationary and non-stationary applications. Catalytic fast pyrolysis is now well established for deoxygenation of pyrolysis oil through a number of studies that deal with both lignocellulosic biomass and algae. The effect of acidic zeolites on the removal of nitrogen from the algae in the form of ammonia is yet to be fully understood, although there are few pieces of evidence in the literature to this effect.193
Catalytic hydropyrolysis is an emerging research topic for the production of fungible hydrocarbon fuels from biomass feedstocks in minimal steps. The choice of suitable catalyst that can effectively do both hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodenitrogenation of pyrolysates from algae is necessary to improve the H/C ratio of the liquid fuels with zero oxygen and nitrogen. Focused works in this direction are necessary to establish confidence in the utilization of algae for fuels via the pyrolysis pathway. Owing to the unique chemical composition of algae, it will be worthy to design catalysts for the selective production of value-added chemicals such as squalene, dimethyl ketene, nitrogenated species like pyridines and indoles, and long-chain ketones via ketonization reactions. Nonetheless, it is equally important to develop effective separation strategies to extract these chemicals from the complex bio-oil mixture. Studies on novel separation techniques like molecular distillation, solvent extraction, reactive adsorption using functional adsorbents, and membrane-based separation are vital to realizing the production of high-value chemicals from bio-oil.347,348
It is imperative to note that the prospects involved in the pyrolytic conversion of algae to chemicals and fuels usually co-exist with challenges. The key challenge lies in the comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of different transformations and the kinetics of the process. While the apparent kinetic models including the distributed activation energy models are useful to predict the overall mass conversion of the algae, they yield little information on the pyrolysate composition in terms of the yield and selectivity of individual organic components. This calls for the development of a mechanistic kinetic model that includes the elementary reactions along with their rate parameters to describe the pathways involved in the complex reaction scheme. This is difficult to achieve just using experimental data, and the involvement of density functional quantum chemical modeling activity is essential to unravel the rates of individual reactions. While this has been reasonably achieved for non-catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass components like cellulose,140,349 hemicellulose,350 and lignin,351 such a methodology is yet to be explored for algae conversions. This is also exacerbated by the complex structure and variability of the proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in algae. The only effort in this direction seems to be the development of a semi-empirical kinetic model from Ranzi's group,209 as described in section 2.8.2. The first step towards such a detailed understanding lies in conducting high-quality pyrolysis experiments of a variety of model components of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and their mixtures, and quantifying the extent of these interactions. This should be combined with modeling of plausible reaction chemistries using the quantum chemical approach.
Through different studies, HTL is demonstrated to be a promising technology for processing both defatted algae and whole algae. The optimal operating conditions vary only over a narrow range of temperatures, pressures, and residence times. The compatibility of HTL bio-crude from algae of different sources (freshwater and marine) with petroleum crude is shown to be good, which shows that it can serve as an excellent drop-in crude oil substitute in the refinery.352 One of the major bottlenecks in scaling up the HTL process in terms of fundamental understanding is the chemistry and kinetics of the process. Owing to high pressure and temperature, obtaining kinetic information from HTL experiments is a challenging task, and so is the product composition with time. This requires advancements in experimental techniques and development of micro-HTL units, especially for obtaining kinetic information and product speciation. The other engineering challenge is to operate the HTL process in continuous mode. While only a few studies are available in this direction, the results are indeed encouraging.353
The underlying concern for large scale implementation of algae processing technologies still seems to lie in the continuous and sustainable supply of algae biomass. Importantly, the economic assessment of processes indicates that obtaining biofuels alone from algae is not a viable option without integrating multiple processes. Cultivating microalgae species near high CO2 emission and waste-water effluent zones can partly address this issue. In the case of macroalgae, regulatory risks involved in obtaining permissions for cultivating them on a large scale are still a concern in many countries. Nevertheless, with the current technological advancements and better scientific understanding, the authors do feel that algae can contribute to a sustainable green economy.
