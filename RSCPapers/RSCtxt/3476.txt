    , Accepted 6th May 2022First published on 6th May 2022AbstractHigh-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are arousing great interest aiming at efficient electrochemical splitting of water. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate Co/Zn sulfide supported on Cu-foam (CoZn-S/Cu-F) as a free-standing electrode with high-performance for overall water splitting. In half-cell electrochemical systems, the overpotentials required to reach the current densities of ±10 mA cm−2 for the OER and HER are only 170 and 130 mV, respectively. After a long-term stability test running 20000 cyclic voltammograms, the respective potential losses for the OER and HER are only 82 and 41 mV at ±50 mA cm−2. The constructed overall water splitting system driven by simulated solar energy also exhibits prominent performance with gas bubbles continuously generated at both electrodes. A cell voltage of only 1.58 V is required to reach the current densities of ±10 mA cm−2, surpassing the commercialized noble metal and state-of-the-art non-noble metal electrodes. The excellent performance for the overall water splitting is ascribed to the CoS nanoparticles covered with ZnS nanoflocs on the highly conductive Cu-foam, which allows close interfacial contact with the electrolyte, promotes mass and charge transfer, and facilitates desorption of the generated gas from the catalyst surface.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen energy has been hailed as one of the ultimate energy sources for the 21st century because of its high efficiency and cleanliness.1,2 Solar- and electricity-assisted decomposition of water are realized as important paths to fulfill the green production of hydrogen. During the process of water splitting, two important reactions, i.e., the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) are involved.3,4 To lower the overpotential for both reactions with the goal of achieving high-efficiency of the overall water splitting system, the electrode material often plays a decisive role.5
The most reported electrode materials for water splitting are noble metals, such as RuO2 and IrO2 for the OER and Pt for the HER. Although these noble metals exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity, their high price and poor stability severely limit their large-scale application.6–8 Therefore, the development of source-abundant and low-cost non-noble metal electrode materials has become more and more important. Transition metal sulfides, phosphides, borides and even non-metallic materials, such as carbon have been reported to present excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the HER,3,9–13 while transition metal oxides and hydroxides often show pronounced performance towards the OER.14,15 However, the hybrid water splitting system coupled with the single-function OER or HER catalyst material often fails to take their respective advantages.5 It is thereby a great challenge to develop bifunctional electrode materials for concurrently electrocatalyzing both reactions.
Conventional fabrication processes of the electrodes often require additional binders to fix powdery electrocatalysts, which not only increase the contact resistance, but also buries important active sites.16 The complicated fabrication processes are another disadvantage due to their long operation times and high capital cost. In situ controlled growth of catalysts on a free-standing three-dimensional porous electrode will not only ensure good contact and uniform dispersion of the catalysts, but also allow the controllable tuning of the microstructure, resulting in an enhanced electrode performance.17,18
In this context, we have deliberately chosen Cu-foam (Cu-F) with high-conductivity, low-cost and easy-accessibility, simultaneously, as the substrate and current collector to fabricate a free-standing bifunctional electrode for both the OER and HER. Among the well-known transition metals, cobalt and its derivatives such as sulfide, oxide and hydroxide have received extensive attention as efficient water splitting catalysts,19–21 which were chosen as the target compound to incorporate on the Cu-F by means of a simple hydrothermal method. Elemental zinc, which has been reported to possess optimum oxygen affinity, was meanwhile introduced in order to favor the easy reactant adsorption and product desorption, clean the active centers and improve the efficiency and service life of the electrode.22 The fabricated electrode exhibited prominent bifunctionality towards both the OER and HER not only in a half-cell reaction, but also in an overall water splitting system in an alkaline electrolyte. The combined CoS nanoparticles and ZnS nanoflocs in situ grown on Cu-F favor the interfacial contact of the electrode with the electrolyte and facilitate the mass and charge transportation, resulting in the free detachment of gas bubbles instead of accumulation in film holes.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals and reagents
Cu-F was obtained from Kunshan Guangjia New Material Co. Ltd, China. Co(NO3)3·6H2O (98%), KOH and CH4N2S (99%) were bought from Shanghai Aladdin Reagent Co. Ltd, China. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (99%), C2H5OH (99.8%) and HNO3 (65%) were acquired from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China. All solutions were prepared using ultra-pure deionized water (Smart-S, Shanghai Hitech Instruments Co. Ltd, China).
2.2 Synthesis of S-Cu-F, Co-S/Cu-F, Zn-S/Cu-F and CoZn-S/Cu-F
Cu-F (2 × 1 × 0.2 cm3, porosity of 98%) was ultrasonically cleaned with nitric acid, ethanol and deionized water (each step for 15 min). 0.1 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O or Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and 0.4 mmol of CH4N2S were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water and transferred into a stainless steel reactor with a PTFE liner, along with the inclusion of pre-cleaned Cu-F. The reactor was then heated at 150 °C for 12 h. After cooling, the Cu-foam was removed and cleaned with deionized water before it was dried in an oven under a vacuum for 12 h. The prepared electrodes were denoted as Co-S/Cu-F and Zn-S/Cu-F, respectively. To prepare the CoZn-S/Cu-F electrode, 0.05 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.05 mmol of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were simultaneously added to deionized water, and the other steps were the same as mentioned above. We also sulfurized only Cu-F to add only CH4N2S and Cu-F in the autoclave. This sample was named S-Cu-F, which was used as the reference sample for comparison.
2.3 Characterization of the samples
The morphology and size distribution of the as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, HITACHI SU8010). The crystal structure was detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F). A Bruker spectrometer with a 522 nm laser source was used for recording Raman spectra. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded on a Bruker X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.5418 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were measured using an ESCALab 250Xi electron spectrometer equipped with a 300 W Al Kα source.
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical tests were carried out with a CHI-760E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, China). For the performance test in a three-electrode electrochemical system, the prepared free-standing electrode was the working electrode. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl, and the counter electrode was Pt-net (2 × 2 cm2). Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were recorded in the potential window of 0–1.2 V and −0.9 to −1.7 V with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 to evaluate the OER and HER performance, respectively. The electrolyte was 1 M KOH solution for the OER and Ar-saturated 1 M KOH solution for the HER. The LSVs presented in the results have been iR compensated. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out at a scan rate of 200 mV s−1 for 20000 cycles in the potential window of 0.4–0.8 V and −1.5 to −1.2 V, in which oxygen and hydrogen bubbles were continuously generated, to assess the long-term stability of the electrode for the OER and HER, respectively. The LSV curves before and after CV cycling were recorded for comparison. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was studied using the alternating current amplitude of 10 mV and the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. The solution resistances were 2.3 and 2.1 ohms, which were used for compensating iR losses for the OER and HER, respectively. The potentials reported in the experimental section were vs. Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl, while the ones reported in the results and discussion section were converted to potentials vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) following the formula: E = E0 + EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH – 0.85 × IRs, in which E0 is the potential measured vs. Ag/AgCl, EAg/AgCl is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl at pH = 0 (i.e., 0.207 V), I is the current measured at the electrode, and Rs is the electrolyte resistance.
2.5 Assembly of the solar-energy-driven water splitting system
For the overall water splitting test, a solar panel irradiated with an incandescent lamp for simulating the sunlight was used to power the system. The as-prepared free-standing electrodes were used as both the cathode and anode. The measurement was carried out in 1 M KOH applying a voltage of 1.2–2.0 V to the system at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
The facile one-pot hydrothermal method was applied to prepare free-standing CoZn-S/Cu-F, as well as the Co-S/Cu-F and Zn-S/Cu-F electrodes (Fig. 1a). The highly conductive Cu-F skeletons could favor the good dispersion of various active sites, thus increasing the interfacial contact area with the electrolyte, and promoting the mass and charge transfer. The morphology of the samples was characterized by SEM. Fig. 1b shows the SEM image of CoZn-S/Cu-F. Radial nanoflocs simultaneously existed along with the presence of angular nanoparticles and it seems that the nanoparticles were mostly covered by the nanoflocs. For the Co-S/Cu-F, the surface of Cu-F was densely adhered with a layer of angular nanoparticles (Fig. S1a and b, ESI†). For the Zn-S/Cu-F, the Cu-F was dominantly covered with radial nanoflocs (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†). Because of the important role of elemental Zn in improving the oxygen affinity22 and the well-distributed nanoparticles and nanoflocs, the gas produced at its surface was supposed to desorb from the surface rapidly and diffuse into the electrolyte instantly; as a result, the active sites could be rapidly exposed. Fig. 1c–e show the high-resolution TEM images of CuZn-S/Cu-F. The lattice spacings of 0.191 nm and 0.298 nm corresponded to the (102) and (100) crystal planes of CoS (ICDD: 03-065-0407), respectively. In addition, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), a folded floc with a thickness of only a few nanometers was observed.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of the synthesis procedure, and (b) SEM and (c–e) TEM images of CoZn-S/Cu-F. 
The crystal structures of the synthesized electrodes were characterized by XRD as shown in Fig. 2a. Three distinct peaks at 2θ ≈ 43.6°, 50.8° and 74.7° were assigned to the (111), (002) and (022) crystal planes of metallic Cu (COD: 4313207),23 which originated from the Cu-F skeleton. In Zn-S/Cu-F, weak peaks appearing at 2θ ≈ 36.63°, 42.56° and 61.76° corresponding to (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of CuO (ICSD: 01-078-0428) were also observed. This was possibly because a certain portion of Cu-F was accidentally uncovered by zinc components or due to the oxidation of the Cu-F surface in air before it was placed in the autoclave for hydrothermal treatment.23 It has been reported that CuO was capable of catalyzing the OER,24,25 while its reduced form, i.e., Cu2O, could promote both the OER and HER.24,25 Because XRD is a bulk technique, it would lead to the fact that Cu-F as the main skeleton of the electrode would present strong peaks in the XRD spectra. As a consequence, the characteristic peaks associated with Co and Zn compounds were not apparently observed. Moreover, ultrathin nanoflocs with large specific surface area were usually accompanied by abundant surface defects resulting in a non-crystallized structure, which was to some extent concurrently responsible for the unobserved characteristic peaks.26
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns, (b) XPS wide-survey spectra; (c) Co 2p spectra, (d) Zn 2p spectra, (e) S 2p spectra, and (f) O 1s spectra of Co-S/Cu-F, Zn-S/Cu-F and CoZn-S/Cu-F. 
XPS was applied to investigate the chemical composition and states of the as-prepared electrodes. Three key elements, i.e., Cu, S and O, were distinctly observed in the wide-survey XPS spectra of the three electrodes, while elemental Co and Zn were co-found in the XPS spectra of their respective electrodes (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c presents the high-resolution XPS Co 2p spectra of Co-S/Cu-F and CoZn-S/Cu-F. The peaks located at the binding energies of 781.1, 783.2 and 796.6 eV were the characteristic peaks of Co2+, while the peaks at 786.1 and 802.8 eV were the satellite peaks associated with Co2+.27,28 The peak located at 778.9 eV in the XPS spectrum of Co-S/Cu-F was attributed to the formation of Co–S bonds.29 However, Co–S was not detectable in the spectrum of CoZn-S/Cu-F. This is mostly because the formed cobalt sulfide particles tended to be covered by a thin layered nanofloc originating from the zinc compounds, as observed in SEM. The high-resolution XPS Zn 2p spectra of Zn-S/Cu-F and CoZn-S/Cu-F are shown in Fig. 2d. The representative peaks at 1022.0 and 1045.0 eV are distinctly assigned to Zn 2p2/3 and Zn 2p1/2, respectively, demonstrating that the oxidation state of Zn was 2+.27 The XPS S 2p spectra further confirmed the presence of metal sulfide in the three electrodes by showing the metal–S characteristic peak at the binding energy of 161.7 eV (Fig. 2e). The peak at 163.0 eV attributed to the S–C bond originated from thiourea in the raw material.3,30 Deconvolution of the O 1s spectra yielded five featured peaks (Fig. 2f). The peaks O1 (529.7 eV), O2 (530.0 eV), O3 (531.5 eV), O4 (532.0 eV), and O5 (533.2 eV), respectively, represent metal–oxygen, oxygen in –OH groups, surface adsorbed oxygen species, defects with low oxygen coordination, and physical and chemical adsorption of surface water.31 Metal oxides (O1) existed in all three electrodes, which was caused by the natural oxidation of the electrode surfaces in air. The presence of diagnostic peaks corresponding to oxygen in –OH groups (O2) signifies that along with the presence of metal sulfide, metal hydroxide was concomitantly formed, which was also realized as an active substance to promote the OER activity.32 The relative contribution of surface-adsorbed oxygen species (O3) was apparently the highest among the five deconvoluted O 1s peaks in CoZn-S/Cu-F. This was because the elemental Zn possesses optimum oxygen affinity, which could positively favor the water adsorption and oxygen desorption during the OER, thus promoting the instant exposure of active sites.22,33 Moreover, oxygen vacancies (O4) also played critical roles behaving as active sites for enhancing the electrochemical hydrolysis.34
To reveal the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrodes for both the OER and HER, LSV curves were recorded as shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. Sulfurized Cu-F was also studied as a reference sample for comparison. Among the four electrodes, CoZn-S/Cu-F exhibited the best OER and HER activity. The onset potential for the OER (Eonset,OER) and HER (Eonset,HER), defined at a current density of 1 and −1 mA cm−2 was only 1.29 and −0.04 V, respectively. Only 1.40 (E10,OER) and −0.13 V (E−10,HER) were required for the cases of the OER and HER, respectively, to research the current density of 10 and −10 mA cm−2, which is a proposed criterion for evaluating the catalyst efficiency.

LSV curves for the (a) OER and (b) HER, (c) Tafel plots derived from (a) for the OER, and (d) Tafel plots derived from (b) for the HER; (e) LSV curves showing the bifunctional OER and HER performance; (f) LSV curves of CoZn-S/Cu-F recorded before and after 20000 CVs for both the OER and HER in 1 M KOH demonstrating the long-term durability. 
The Tafel slope is defined as the growth rate of the current to the overpotential, and its value depends mainly on the transfer coefficient. The smaller the Tafel slope is, the faster the current density increases and the smaller the overpotential changes (i.e., the faster the reaction rate constant), which is a powerful indicator for justifying the electrocatalytic mechanism. The value of the Tafel slope often offers information about the rate-determining step. Taking the OER as an example, if the Tafel slope is about 118 mV dec−1, slow adsorption of reaction intermediates, such as –OHads is expected, signifying a limited OER performance. If the Tafel slope is close to 59 mV dec−1, the chemical step after the first electron transfer will be the rate-determining step. The value between the aforementioned numbers typically implies that both the first electron transfer step and the chemical step after the first electron transfer would concomitantly determine the reaction rate.35 CoZn-S/Cu-F presented a minimum Tafel slope of 75 mV dec−1, indicating the fastest OER kinetics among the three electrodes (Fig. 3c). Similarly, the Tafel slope of CoZn-S/Cu-F for the HER was also the smallest (112 mV dec−1) among the three electrodes signifying its superior HER kinetics (Fig. 3d). According to the equivalent circuit model extracted from the Nyquist diagram (Fig. S3, ESI†), CoZn-S/Cu-F has the lowest charge transfer resistance of 7.6 and 10.1 ohms for the OER and HER, respectively, indicating that it has faster electron transfer ability. Generally, the potential difference (ΔE) at ±10 mA cm−2 is used to judge the bifunctionality of a catalyst for overall water splitting. As shown in Fig. 3e, ΔE of CoZn-S/Cu-F was only 1.53 V, outperforming the commercialized noble metal-based catalysts (e.g., 1.56 V for Pt/C-RuO217), and other free-standing electrodes reported to date36–44 (Table 1). Long-term durability tests of CoZn-S/Cu-F towards both the OER and HER were performed by running 20000 CVs at a scan rate of 0.2 V s−1 in the potential range in which oxygen and hydrogen gas bubbles were continuously generated in 0.1 M KOH. LSV curves were recorded before and after CV cycling as presented in Fig. 3f. The potential attenuation of only 82 and 41 mV was, respectively, observed when the current density was as high as ±50 mA cm−2, indicating its excellent long-life performance in electrocatalyzing the OER and HER (Fig. 3f).

The sample after the long-term stability test was evaluated with XPS, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). After the OER stability test, Co2+ was oxidized to Co3+ (Fig. S4a, ESI†). At the same time, the Co–S bond of 779.0 eV disappeared.45 Because of the slightly decreased contribution of elemental S (Fig. S4c, ESI†) and the increased contribution of metal–oxygen (O1) (Fig. S4d, ESI†), it was concluded that some divalent cobalt ions (Co2+) at least at the surface of CoS were transformed to trivalent cobalt ions (Co3+), possibly in the form of hydroxyl cobalt oxide (CoOOH). The formation of highly active CoOOH is one of the reasons for the retained good OER stability.46 At the same time, the characteristic peak of elemental zinc was weakened indicating the dissolution of elemental zinc (Fig. S4b, ESI†). The increase of oxygen vacancy content and the surface defects caused by the dissolution of Zn element also contributed to the improvement of the OER performance.47 On the contrary, the intensity of the Co 2p peak was significantly weakened after the HER stability test (Fig. S4a, ESI†), accompanied by the increase of the relative concentration of elemental Zn and S (Fig. S4b and c, ESI†). Meanwhile, the metal–oxygen (O1) peak in XPS O 1s disappeared (Fig. S4d, ESI†). Due to the dissolution of cobalt, the binding energy of Zn 2p moves to 1021.98 and 1045.05 eV in the negative direction, showing a typical ZnS characteristic peak (Fig. S4b, ESI†).48 As a semiconductor metal sulfide, ZnS was reported as an electrochemical catalyst for the HER.49 XRD spectra of CoZn-S/Cu-F were also collected after the OER and HER stability tests (Fig. S5, ESI†). Metallic Cu was without doubt the dominant form of the sample. By elucidating the XRD spectra at high magnification, small characteristic peaks of CuO were observed after the OER stability test due to the oxidation of Cu under a strong oxidative environment (Fig. S6a, ESI†), while Cu(OH)2 with the characteristic peaks at 2θ ≈ 23.8°, 34.1°, 35.9° and 39.8° corresponding to (021), (002), (111) and (130) crystal planes (ICDD-01-072-0140), respectively, was found after the HER stability test (Fig. S5b, ESI†). It has been reported that Cu(OH)2 could behave as active sites to promote the HER.50 The newly formed active site, i.e., Cu(OH)2 offsets the disappearance of the original active sites, i.e., CoS on the sample surfaces; therefore, the electrode activity did not undergo a significant attenuation.
In view of the excellent OER and HER properties of CoZn-S/Cu-F in a half-cell water splitting system, a double-electrode set-up for examining the overall water splitting was subsequently constructed using two CoZn-S/Cu-F as both the anode and cathode (Fig. 4a). The electrolysis of water was driven by simulated sunlight using an incandescent lamp irradiating a solar panel. Gas bubbles were continuously produced at both the cathode and anode. Through the LSV test of the CoZn-S/Cu-F-based two-electrode water splitting system (Fig. 4b), the voltage was 1.58 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was smaller than the reported value of 1.61 V when using commercialized Pt/C–RuO2 as an electrode material for overall water splitting.51 Compared with other state-of-the-art free-standing bifunctional electrodes, it also presented outstanding performance (Table 2),37–39,41–44,52,53 signifying the possibility of its potential application in practice.

4. Conclusions
A high-performance free-standing electrode composed of CoS nanoparticles and ZnS nanoflocs supported on Cu-F was successfully fabricated for overall water splitting by a simple hydrothermal method. In a conventional half-cell electrochemical system, the CoZn-S/Cu-F exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance for both the OER and HER. Only 1.40 V and −0.13 V were needed to reach the current density of 10 and −10 mA cm−2 for the OER and HER, respectively. The fabricated free-standing electrode also showed excellent performance in an overall water splitting system, requiring a cell voltage of only 1.58 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The prominent performance of CoZn-S/Cu-F in both the half-cell and complete water splitting systems was ascribed to its unique three-dimensional structure with active CoS nanoparticles and ZnS nanoflocs. The highly conductive Cu-F skeletons could favor good dispersion of cobalt and zinc sulfides, thus increasing the interfacial contact area with the electrolyte, and promoting the mass and charge transfer. Because of the introduction of elemental Zn, and the thin ZnS nanoflocs on the Cu-F, the gas produced at its surface could easily desorb and diffuse into the electrolyte without the accumulation of the gas bubbles on the surfaces, thereby allowing rapid exposure of active sites. The reported strategy exhibited advanced prospects of the rational design of free-standing electrodes and their potential application in overall water splitting systems.
