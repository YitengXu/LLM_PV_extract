This article summarises the Closing Remarks from the Faraday Discussions on this topic, emphasising the recent progress made in the field as well as the key challenges that remain to be addressed. Specific examples in topical areas involving solar energy conversion, luminescent sensors, molecular logic and machines, and supramolecular photocatalysis are presented.
Introduction
Even with the gift of hindsight, it is often difficult in Science to associate the beginning of an emergent field with a particular event. In some respects, the organisation of the NATO workshop on Photoinduced Charge Separation and Energy Migration in Supramolecular Species in 19871 may be viewed as marking the beginning of supramolecular photochemistry as a new domain in photochemistry, a field where interactions between light and matter are controlled by intermolecular forces. It is fitting that several of the participants of this landmark event bring their contribution and perspective to this discussion some 30 years later.
Supramolecular photochemistry is a concept based on the observation that excited state processes are particularly sensitive to their environment. While this may seem obvious to us, the short lifetime and high electronic energy of singlet and triplet excited states were once seen as a limitation in the use of weak interactions as a means of governing excited states. Ignorant of such limitations, Nature has since the dawn of photosynthesis and vision employed supramolecular assemblies to direct and harness the flow of photons. If ever a single image can embody such an approach, this must be the structure of the light-harvesting complex and reaction centre RC-LH1 found in cyanobacteria (Fig. 1A).2 Although more primitive than the photosynthetic equivalent found in eukaryotic organisms, its high degree of symmetry possesses just the touch of asymmetry needed to convey a sense of purpose to each of the components. It is easy to see how, even in such a complex architecture, light can be used to specifically excite selected chromophores based on the energy and cross-section of their electronic transition dipole moments. It is this specificity of light–matter interactions that makes photochemistry particularly advantageous to supramolecular chemistry: as supramolecular species increase in complexity and function, photons are the traceless reagent that powers their purpose.

The key challenges facing supramolecular photochemistry, as identified in these discussions, include the use of supramolecular structures for luminescence and sensing applications, and for activating (powering) molecular machines and logic gates. Of course, light-to-fuels conversion remains a major ambition whose societal importance need not be further elaborated. The design of self-organizing photo-active ensembles was also identified as a challenge in view of the often complex multiple techniques required to achieve adequate purification and characterisation. Lastly, we find that the design of photocatalytic systems is an area where substantial progress has been made and in which numerous challenges remain. These are present both in photo-active materials for depollution of natural resources, as well as in molecular systems displaying photocatalytic transformations.
Solar energy conversion
The conversion of solar energy into more practical forms of energy remains a major challenge. Whereas the production of electricity in photovoltaic modules is now well established, even for third-generation devices, the production of chemical energy (fuels) from the sun is anything but accomplished. It requires the juxtaposition of several processes that necessarily include light absorption and chemical transformation. As in Nature, this can be achieved in a supramolecular assembly combining the required components into an “artificial leaf” (Fig. 1B),3 and it is indeed this paradigm that continues to drive the molecular approach.4 Lately, though, this is being challenged as more robust and efficient inorganic catalysts make their way forward.
Significant progress has been made in the development of electroactive catalysts for water oxidation and reduction. Indeed, a proof-of-principle system attaining 10% efficiency was reported by the Nocera group using NiBi and NiMoZn catalysts for water oxidation and reduction, respectively. Electromotive force was supplied by four single junction crystalline Si solar cells operating in series to provide the required voltage.5 Looking beyond the circuitous electrical supply used in this example, the utilization of catalysts composed of earth-abundant elements operating at near neutral pH is a substantial achievement. Indeed, the design of robust and efficient catalysts for water splitting is one of the main challenges in the field.
Despite its high cost, ruthenium remains one of the most investigated metal catalysts. During this meeting, Thummel and co-workers discussed water oxidation catalysts based on Ru(II) tetradentate polypyridyl ligands to investigate the effect of coordination geometry (DOI: 10.1039/c5fd00051c). They find that rotation of the distal pyridyl ligands is not required for catalytic activity and that the latter is relatively insensitive to small changes in geometry. Supramolecular hybrids incorporating polyoxometallate scaffolds and Ru(II)–Zn(II) complexes have demonstrated high levels of performance (DOI: 10.1039/c5fd00080g) , and the Co(III) cubanes reported by Natali and co-workers (DOI: 10.1039/c5fd00076a) bear remarkable resemblance to the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) in the natural photosynthetic system.6 However, the use of a sacrificial agent to complete the circuit in many of the studies on oxidative or reductive half-couples in water splitting raises important questions on how such systems may later be incorporated into a fully operational ensemble. In particular, sacrificial electron donors with irreversible redox behaviour may skew measurements by providing additional chemical driving force that would be unavailable during normal operation.
Further exploration of the natural OEC will certainly result in advances in our understanding of multi-electron oxidative electron transfer (DOI: 10.1039/c5fd00087d). Similarly, comprehension of the fast processes involved in energy migration is a key challenge in complex multi-chromophore assemblies (DOI: 10.1039/c5fd00084j). Already, we understand that controlling the pH is essential to optimize both oxidative and reductive water splitting, as is the balancing of the relative rates of production of holes and electrons to avoid the accumulation of reactive intermediates. In this respect, the use of a buried junction to protect a photocatalyst from exposure to a harmful environment7 and optimize operational conditions, or even promote self-repair,8 is promising.
Luminescence for sensing and imaging
Supramolecular sensing of molecules and ions is based on a binding event between an analyte and a receptor bearing an electro- or photo-active group whose response is altered by the presence of the analyte. Fluorogenic molecular receptors are widely used in biological applications, particularly in studying DNA9 and cellular development.10 Looking beyond molecular receptors, nanoparticles (DOI: 10.1039/c5fd00108k). and metal–organic frameworks have found increasing applications for sensing.11 Here, the framework provides a crystalline environment with an adjustable band-gap and electronic structure. Luminescent metal complexes such as transition metals11a or lanthanides,12 provide the signalling event.
Biological applications of luminescence-based sensing are many and widespread. They can be used to remotely sense the presence of a substrate or release of a degradation product signalling enzymatic activity, or more generally the concentration of oxygen or pH values in cellular compartments. In particular, imaging cell activity in tumours can allow for monitoring the bioavailability of a drug13 or for following, in real time, the effects of therapeutic treatment. An example of this was provided by Lemon and Nocera using micellar encapsulation of a chemosensor for oxygen (DOI: 10.1039/c5fd00093a). In this example, the large two-photon cross section of a quantum dot was used to excite via energy transfer a gold(III) corrole (Fig. 2A). The latter possesses a long-lived triplet excited state whose phosphorescence is sensitive to quenching by oxygen. Using such constructs, in vivo imaging of oxygen concentrations during therapeutic treatment was demonstrated. In another example, electrochemiluminescence generated from a biomarker selectively encapsulated by a phosphate cavitand is used for the early detection of prostate cancer (DOI: 10.1039/c5fd00096c).

Optical signal treatment can be combined with sensing to produce, in principle, more advanced systems capable of some preliminary form of analysis (lab-on-a-molecule).14 This will rest on further development of simple algebraic functions at the molecular level,15 which in itself represents a significant challenge for future development. Alongside this, the usual challenges associated with sensors (high selectivity and sensitivity, fast response, absence of matrix effects) are all pertinent. The incorporation of photosensitive receptors on surfaces (in view of constructing solid-state devices) poses yet more difficulties.16 Of equal importance is the issue of adoption of a new fluorophore or imaging chemosensor by the biomedical community, whose well-established protocols can be difficult to supplant.
In the area of materials, supramolecular effects can be used to control luminescence or to map out electronic interactions. A striking example is offered by the light-induced control of excimer polarisation (photopolism) in supramolecular fullerene ribbons (Fig. 2B).17,18 In this system, hydrogen bonds are used to align fullerenes into one-dimensional cables whose emission is delocalised over two or more chromophores.19 Upon irradiation, the supramolecular arrangement results in a switch in the excimer selection that forces the emission polarisation to rotate by 60°. Here, light is used both to map inter-fullerene interactions and to modify them remotely. A more widespread area of interest is the development of materials for OLED displays, where supramolecular coordination compounds are used as light-emitting centres.20 Moving beyond rare-earth metals is a significant hurdle in terms of meeting requirements of stability and luminescence intensity. Here, supramolecular interactions between chromophores can provide a bottom-up approach to controlling the size and shape of the luminophores.21
Molecular machines and logic
Light-driven chemical transformations are the basis for many complex devices that are able to carry out sophisticated tasks, where the role of light can be regarded as fuel for the operation of molecular machines,22 an input/output signal in logic gates,23 or a stimulus for the controlled response of supramolecular switches.24 Activation by light can offer significant advantages because it is easy to localise activation of a photochemical processes by selective illumination. Part of the excitement in the field is due to our projection that these ‘smart assemblies’ could one day give rise to functional materials with (nano)technological applications.† Some recent examples light-actuated macroscopic systems are shown in Fig. 3.

Although numerous impressive examples of molecular machines can be found in the literature, it remains nonetheless challenging to match a complex functionality, such as unidirectional motion, with a simple architectural design. As a remarkable example, switches, motors and logic gates based on the well-known diazobenzene light-induced E to Z isomerization have been extensively exploited, in what has been called ‘the eternal youth of azobenzene’.27 Their important advantages compared to other well-known switches such as spiropyranes are their relative ease of synthesis and handling. Therefore, there is still a lot of room for the design of molecular movement based on small, synthetically affordable molecules and other novel light-responsive molecules. For example, the combination of a relatively simply set of molecules comprising a photoacid and pH-sensitive fluorescent sensors was used for generating XOR logic gates. When an object is ‘photographed’ over the XOR matrix, local pH gradients on the object's physical limits gives rise to a more complex ‘edge-detection’ algorithm of up to 1 mm over different wavelengths of the spectrum (DOI: 10.1039/c5fd00056d). More examples of simple and elegant design of switches and motors have been recently reported, including the autonomous, unidirectional threading/dethreading motion of a macrocyclic crown ether through a switchable azobenzene thread operated by UV light as the sole fuel. The switching, which operates out of thermodynamic equilibrium, alters the energetic barrier of the threading step in a dynamic fashion, gating the direction of the motion.28
These examples point out that thermodynamic equilibrium can barely satisfy the requirements to carry out complex tasks such as those performed by molecular bio-machines found in Nature. This is a critical bottle-neck in the current self-assembly paradigm: in contrast with traditional synthetic molecular systems, biological processes are adaptable to a given situation, which is only possible because they are not confined to a thermodynamic equilibrium, but are instead in a dynamic self-assembled state.29 The ability to adapt to specific conditions is controlled by an energy input that drives the system to a different state. However, there are relatively few synthetic chemical systems that can operate out of equilibrium, and their development holds promise for supramolecular (photo)chemistry.
Looking forward, we can expect that the need to leverage molecular motion though greater directional control will increase in importance. Although there is significant knowledge of the mechanisms of operation of synthetic molecular motors and switches from solution studies, there is however more limited understanding on how collaborative action of multiple copies can be employed to produce useful work on the nano- micro- or macroscale through, for example, organization into 2D or 3D structures. Very likely, this will require that the photoactive assemblies would be embedded in – or on – a supporting material, possibly with a defined orientation, and that therefore anisotropic effects could play an important role. To develop immobilization strategies to achieve well-defined 2D or 3D structures is therefore essential to gain more insights into the multi-integration of molecular devices that are able to actuate on the macroscale, bridging photochemical sciences with material sciences.
Catalysis and organic synthesis
Natural photosynthetic systems are capable of harnessing multiple photon excitations and converting this into a single chemical transformation. While this remains a source of inspiration for the development of artificial photosynthetic systems, only recently has it been creatively extrapolated to organic synthesis.30 Here, the energy accumulated through sequential photoexcitation allows for greater reactivity in the catalysis of reactions that could not be easily achieved in a single photon process. This strategy was exploited by the König group in the reduction of aryl halides (Ar–Br, Ar–Cl) in good to excellent yields through the two-fold excitation of a perylene bisimide sensitizer. The first photon is used to generate the corresponding long-lived perylene bisimide radical anion, which is then photoexcited to form a highly reducing species capable of transferring an electron to an aryl halide. The latter undergoes fast loss of halide and the aryl radical thus formed can then be exploited to carry out C–C couplings in good yields by using N-heterocyclic pyrroles. This highlights that our ability to further exploit photochemistry also relies on the rational approach to multi-photon processes, and therefore gaining energetic driving force for further developments of photosynthetic procedures using longer wavelength (eventually solar) light.
The formation of supramolecular complexes using photoactive substrates provides an opportunity to control the reactivity by approaching and orienting the reactive centres of ground and excited states. This means that both enhanced reaction rates and product (enantio)selectivity can be obtained by judiciously pre-organizing the geometry of the reactive centres in the assembly. Photoreactions can be templated by single or multiple cooperative chemical inputs by host–guest recognition.31 Although the concept is appealing, several drawbacks are inherent to such supramolecular systems. These include the choice of solvents and concentration, as most of the thermodynamic binding constants of supramolecular complexes are highly dependent on such parameters. Furthermore, the observed turnover numbers are generally low, especially if the product has a higher affinity for the catalyst that the substrate, due for instance to multivalent interactions. In some examples, the molecular recognition elements are introduced covalently onto the reaction centres and then released, which increases the length of the synthetic route. Internal filter effects from the substrates or photoproducts are another important consideration as they lead to unwanted photochemical degradation. Future improvements rely on both the fine optimization of the templates, ideally providing very high selectivity towards substrates and a lower affinity towards the products. This can be achieved, for example, by modulating the solubility of the products and substrates and using a biphasic system in which the photocatalyst is present in only one compartment, which is selectively irradiated. Using this approach, turnover numbers exceeding 150 have been obtained for the photoreduction of Au(III) using an organic photocatalyst.32
Although examples of enantioselective photocatalysis date from the '60s, the discipline has not taken off until recently. The mechanisms of enantioselective photocatalysis are remarkably different from enantioselective catalysis since only the photo-activated state of the catalyst–substrate complex has sufficient energy to undergo subsequent transformation. Here, the catalyst is designed to form a complex before the activation step so it can provide a chiral environment by acting as a shield to force the reaction to occur stereoselectively.33 Like its ground-state counterparts, the main objectives of enantioselective photocatalysis remain achieving high turnover numbers with good enantioselectivity. The photoinduced electron transfer sensitizer (3) developed by Bach and co-workers constitutes a prototypical example in the field. It has been employed to afford the photoinduced cyclization of substrate 1 to give pyrrolizidines 2 and 2-ent in good yields and enantiomeric excesses (up to 64% and 70%, respectively, Scheme 1).34 The system requires a relatively high loading of catalyst, and a turnover number of 12 was obtained by employing 0.05 eq. of the catalyst. A key point is the rigid design of the catalyst which acts as a shield and improves the interaction with the substrate through π-stacking interactions. Later examples developed along similar lines showed that xanthone derivatives efficiently enantiocatalyze [2 + 2] photoadditions of quinolone to afford good yields and enantiomeric excesses (89% and 91% respectively).35 This shows that, although young, the discipline is growing quickly and holds a lot of potential for further developments.

Conclusions
There can be no doubt that supramolecular photochemistry has made great strides since its early days. We know understand much better how organisation of chromophores and photoactive centres can influence excited-state reactivity. This can in turn be used to steer photoinduced events towards chosen processes for applications in numerous areas such as solar energy conversion and biomedicine. Importantly, light continues to benefit from a strongly positive perception by society, and this will aid in gaining acceptance for use of light-driven processes in many areas. While many challenges lie ahead, these are for the most part scientific rather than ideological at the present time. That is not to say they are easier to solve, but rather underscore the fact that the fundamental concepts of photochemistry are well accepted by the community, who are now active at employing them towards more complex supramolecular architectures.
