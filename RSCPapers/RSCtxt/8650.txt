    , Accepted 15th November 2021First published on 15th November 2021AbstractThermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have attracted intensive interest in recent decades owing to their intrinsic merits of 100% exciton collection capability and relatively low-cost device fabrication. An abundance of TADF emitters with a donor–acceptor structure have been reported. Among them, the diazine-based TADF derivatives can not only form a wide range of emission spanning the entire region from deep blue to near-infrared through rational molecular design, but also realize multiple exciton utilization channels, such as aggregation-induced emission (AIE), room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and mechanochromic luminescence (MCL). Such diversiform variability in the same acceptor system is extremely infrequent and deserves in-depth understanding. Herein, a comprehensive review of diazine-based TADF materials is presented according to the relative position of two nitrogen atoms, including pyridazine, pyrimidine and pyrazine derivatives. Their molecular design, optoelectronic behavior, and related application in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been systematically summarized, especially focusing on the subtle structure–property relationship. This review provides a guideline and further direction for the development of high-efficient and multifunctional luminescent materials.

1. Introduction
Since the significant breakthrough by Tang and Van Slyke in 1987,1 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with fascinating features of high image quality, faster response times, thin panels, lightweight, large viewing angle, and flexible substrates, have drawn widespread attention for their promising applications in both flat panel display and solid-state lighting technologies. However, before the second generation of phosphorescent OLEDs, there still exist drawbacks for conventional OLEDs containing pure organic fluorescent materials as emitters, which reveals a low external quantum efficiency (EQE) and a short operation life. This is attributed to the fact that conventional fluorescent emitters can use only 25% of singlet excitons for radiative decay, and 75% of triplet excitons are quenched by thermal radiation (Scheme 1), according to the quantum mechanical spin statistics.2 Therefore, the theoretical upper limit of EQE based on conventional fluorescent OLEDs would be only 5%, if the light out-coupling efficiency was 20%. Harvesting the additional 75% of triplet excitons has become an important pathway for improved light emission.
 Scheme 1  Brief mechanism of conventional fluorescence, phosphorescence and TADF. ISC = intersystem crossing; Phos. = phosphorescence; NR = nonradiative. 
Several approaches thus have been proposed, particularly focusing on the capture of triplet excitons. Employing organometallic complexes as phosphorescent emitters is quite an effective way due to strong spin–orbit coupling interactions induced by the heavy metal (e.g., Ir and Pt) in the complexes,3,4 and thus the second generation phosphorescent OLEDs can overcome the efficiency bottleneck of conventional fluorescence OLEDs, in which both singlet and triplet excitons can be fully exploited to achieve 100% exciton utilization in theory. However, heavy metals are expensive and dependent on limited global resources, so the high cost of phosphorescent OLEDs is unfavorable for commercialization. In particular, compared with red and green phosphorescent materials, the development of stable and efficient blue phosphorescent materials remains a significant challenge.5 Recently, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has been considered to be the most promising alternative for the exciton harvesting mechanism used in OLEDs, which was first reported and developed by the Adachi group.6 Similar to phosphorescent emitters but without the involvement of heavy metal atoms, the TADF emitter also eventually approaches theoretical 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) by recruiting both singlet and triplet excitons, which is ascribed to the small energy gap (ΔEST) between the lowest energy excited singlet state (S1) and the lowest energy excited triplet state (T1) (Scheme 1). When possessing a small ΔEST, 75% triplet excitons can convert from T1 to S1 through a reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process via thermal activation.7,8 In addition, some special luminescent materials with multipath exciton harvesting were developed on the basis of the TADF mechanism, including aggregation-induced emission (AIE), room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and mechanochromic luminescence (MCL).
2. General design principles for TADF emitters
So far, red, green, and blue OLED based TADF emitters with EQEs of more than 30% have been realized,9–11 which can match the performances of phosphorescent OLEDs, making them the most promising third generation pragmatic application.12 These excellent TADF-OLED performances have triggered researchers' urgent demand for judicious and accurate molecular design of an emitting layer.
In order to strategically design TADF materials with strong potential towards high performance, it is fundamentally important to understand their dynamic behavior in the case of electroluminescence (EL). Typically, the effective exciton behavior for TADF emitters under electrical excitation includes (Scheme 1):13 (i) radiative transition of singlet excitons from S1 to ground state, which is defined as the well-known prompt fluorescence (PF); (ii) the RISC process of triplet excitons from T1 to S1; (iii) delayed radiative transition from S1 to ground state, or delayed fluorescence (DF), which is due to repopulation of the singlet state via RISC of triplet excitons. From the above-mentioned exciton radiative transition path, it can be judged that the holistic radiative efficiency strongly depends on the reverse intersystem crossing efficiency of triplet excitons, so a small ΔEST is needed for harvesting triplet excitons according to the following Boltzmann distribution relation:13 (1)where kB and T represent the Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively, and kRISC is the rate constants for RISC. According to eqn (1), the kRISC is directly related to ΔEST and T, and a high temperature is theoretically conducive to the RISC process, but it can also dramatically induce non-radiative (NR) inactivation. Therefore, a more efficient path is to minimize the ΔESTs of TADF emitters to achieve RISC at room temperature. Importantly, ΔEST is closely correlated with molecular configuration, which is proportional to the double exchange integral (J) between frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs):14 ΔEST = ES − ET = 2J(2)where ES and ET are the orbital energies of the S1 and T1 state, respectively. It can be deduced from eqn (1) and (2) that when the exchange integral (J) is as small as possible, a strong RISC process can be achieved. Meanwhile, the exchange integral strongly depends on the electron density overlap between frontier molecular orbitals, that is, the orbital overlap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which can be defined by the overlap integral of their spatial wave functions as eqn (3):15 (3)where ϕHOMO and ϕLUMO are the wavefunctions of the HOMO and LUMO, respectively, and r1 and r2 represent the position vectors.16 It indicates that a tiny small or even close to zero orbital overlap between the HOMO and the LUMO can minimize the exchange integral (J), so as to obtain a small ΔEST.
In this type of molecular design, TADF emitters commonly featuring D–A-types composed of electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) groups have been introduced to construct a large torsion angle between D and A units, which render separation or minimal overlap of FMOs.17 This separation or small overlap is beneficial to reduce ΔEST for efficient RISC. In general, donor units are concentrated in relatively rigid structures such as carbazole (Cz), phenoxazine (PXZ) and acridine, while the acceptor units are diverse. Since the Adachi group reported the D–A type TADF emitter with 1,3,5-triazine as the acceptor in 2011,18 a series of acceptor structures (Scheme 2), including diphenyl sulfone,19 cyano,20 pyrazine,21 diphenylketone,22 triphenylboron,23 triazole,24etc., have been used. However, we have to admit the detrimental trend for high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (PLQYs) in view of TADF molecular structure design, namely, an effective separation of FMOs can obtain a small ΔEST accompanied with a low fluorescence radiative rate (kSr). Meanwhile, excessively long DF lifetimes generally lead to the infamous triplet exciton-involved concentration quenching, and good thermal stability is the basic guarantee for stable device performance. Therefore, except for elaborate device structure optimization, TADF emitters with outstanding performance are by no means solely determined via small ΔESTs, and their PLQYs, DF lifetimes and thermal stability should be comprehensively considered when designing TADF structure. How to balance the relationship between them has always been a hot topic.
 Scheme 2  Summary of the common donor/acceptor units for the D–A type TADF molecules. 
In the past two decades, diazine has received extensive attention in the fields of OLEDs,25 organic photovoltaic solar cells (OPV),26 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)27 and chemical and biosensors28 due to their strong electron affinity, high luminous efficiency, good electrical and optical properties, and easy synthesis and chemical modification. Diazine refers to a six-membered heterocyclic compound containing two nitrogen atoms. According to the relative position of the two nitrogen atoms, it can be divided into three isomers as shown in Scheme 3, namely pyridazine (1,2-diazine), pyrimidine (1,3-diazine) and pyrazine (1,4-diazine). As a six-member aromatic ring, diazine possesses two sp2 “N”. Compared with other monocyclic aromatic ring analogs, such as benzene without an “N” atom and pyridine with one “N” atom, diazine is more electron accepting and its introduction into the conjugated framework of push–pull electronic structure facilitates intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Meanwhile, the orbital interaction between the π-conjugate system of diazine and other aromatic units not only stabilizes the molecular skeleton of the diazine ring, but also forms a variety of different electronic structures once different aromatic substituents are introduced, thereby obtaining new functional materials with special structures and properties. Pyridazine, pyrimidine and pyrazine heterocycles have been widely used as building blocks of functional conjugated materials.
 Scheme 3  Three isomers of diazine (pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine) and their electronic structures. 
In this review, we summarize the current advances of diazine-contained D–A-type TADF small molecules mainly according to the classification of diazine, namely pyridazine, pyrimidine and pyrazine. Their molecular structure design strategies, photophysical properties and the relationship between structure–device-performance will be deeply discussed. We expect this review is not only a comprehensive summary of diazine-based TADF materials, but also a theoretical guide for designing high-efficient TADF materials that are amenable to commercialization.
3. Pyridazine-based TADF materials
The rarest diazine compound is pyridazine and only a few pyridazine derivatives exist in nature. The current applications are mostly constructed in herbicides and drugs as biologically active structural units. As an aromatic six-membered heterocycle, pyridazine contains two adjacent sp2 “N” that induces a stronger electron-withdrawing capacity than pyridine. Thus, pyridazine is readily accessible as a building block as an electron acceptor in the D–A system. However, as far as we know for optoelectronic applications, pyridazine derivatives are more used in OFET over the past few years,27 which are infrequent as bipolar materials containing a D–A system in the literature, and not to mention D–A type pyridazine derivatives with TADF properties. The report of two yellow-emissive TADF molecules with similar pyridazine comes from our group,29 in which an additional nitrogen atom was introduced to further enhance pyridazine's electron-withdrawing ability, and phenoxazine as electron donors to construct two asymmetric D–A structures, reaching a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 13.0%. With the increase of building blocks, we believe that the feature of pyridazine will be more exploited for TADF materials.
4. Pyrimidine-based TADF materials
Pyrimidine is a familiar six-membered conjugated heterocyclic ring, and the greater electron-deficient property and flexible substitution effect in comparison to benzene and pyridine enable it as a good acceptor core to be diversified into the D–A structure of TADF molecules. In addition, as is well-known, the delayed fluorescence of TADF comes from the transition of the ICT excited state, which is usually forbidden, resulting in low PLQYs. In order to improve the low fluorescence radiative rate of CT state materials, the introduction of a π-bridge into the D–A configuration can not only make an appropriate local excited (LE) state component between donor and acceptor molecular orbitals and thus harvest high PLQYs, but can also arouse the donor unit, π-bridge and acceptor unit in the same system to have diverse and independent selectivity, which can easily adjust the degree of coupling between the donor and acceptor to regulate the properties of excited states. In this context, pyrimidine is also often connected to the donor unit with phenylene as the conjugate π-bridge, which has been extensively studied and exhibited significant TADF properties for OLEDs.
Generally, pyrimidine as the acceptor core is constructed mainly into two groups: symmetrical conformation and asymmetrical conformation, depending on how the donors and other acceptors are connected to the core (Scheme 4). Their photophysical, electrochemical properties and related device performances have been listed in Tables 1–4.

4.1 Symmetrical conformation based on a pyrimidine unit
In this type of pyrimidine-based symmetrical conformation, on one hand, most of them exist in a star-like symmetrical structure since the 2-, 4-, and 6-positions of the pyrimidine moiety are easily functionalized (Scheme 4a), in which pyrimidine serves as the acceptor core, and the same donor unit occupies the 4- and 6-positions of the pyrimidine, meanwhile the phenylene unit acts as a π-bridge connecting the donors and pyrimidine. The phenylene-bridge usually takes advantage of a twisted π-conjugated system between the donor and pyrimidine to form properly separated frontier molecular orbitals, harvesting features of small ΔESTs and high PLQYs. While, the 2-position of pyrimidine not only boosts synthesis and thermal stability, but also fine-tunes the electronic communication capacity and TADF property via connecting some small functional groups, such as methyl and phenyl. On the other hand, a linear symmetrical configuration comprising bipyrimidine as the acceptor core coupled with donor units through a phenylene linker also have been reported. In this section, we comprehensively discuss pyrimidine-based TADF small molecules with symmetrical conformation, and their structures are presented in Scheme 5.
 Scheme 5  Molecular structure of pyrimidine-based TADF small molecules with symmetrical conformation. 
Kido and Sasabe first reported a series of star-like pyrimidine-cored TADF emitters on the 4,6-position and 2-position symmetrically functionalized with a phenylacridine moiety.30 The theoretical calculations of Ac-RPM derivatives testify their HOMOs were located on the 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (DMAC) unit, whereas the LUMOs were concentrated on the 4,6-diphenylpyrimidine skeleton. In other words, their frontier molecular orbitals basically reached a complete separation, so that the three Ac-RPM derivatives showed a ΔEST of about 0.19 eV, as determined by photoluminescence (PL) spectra tests. Therefore, their TADF characters were confirmed by the transient PL decay curve. Among these, Ac-MPM-based TADF OLEDs obtained the best sky-blue device performance with a maximum EQE of 24.5%, a maximum power efficiency (PEmax) of 61.6 lm W−1 and a maximum current efficiency (CEmax) of 54.9 cd A−1.
However, the efficiency roll-off was relatively large at high brightness owing to the large ΔEST of approximately 0.2 eV and long DF lifetimes of more than 20 μs. Our team and Kido et al. ameliorated the above-mentioned pyrimidine-cored symmetrical structure almost at the same time. Our group utilized phenoxazine (PXZ) with a stronger electron-donating ability instead of DMAC as the donor unit, and three green TADF emitters were designed and synthesized,31 accompanying small ΔESTs of 0.03–0.10 eV, high PLQYs of 88–91%, short DF lifetimes of about 2 μs and good thermal stability. The EQEmax of the PXZPhPM-based green device was close to 25%. With the practical brightness at 1000 cd m−2, it still maintained as high as 18.2%, displaying a slow efficiency roll-off. These results provide a feasible strategy for fine-tuning the chemical structure to optimizing optoelectronic properties of TADF emitters.
Based on the first reported sky-blue emitter Ac-PPM, Kido et al. introduced a piperidine at the 2-position of pyrimidine to increase the LUMO energy level, thereby arousing a wider energy gap (Eg) for blue TADF emitter (Ac-NPM).32 Then, they also employed PXZ in place of DMAC to enhance the intramolecular charge transfer. PXZ-PPM achieved a smaller ΔEST of 0.08 eV as compared to the Ac-PPM emitter, which is accompanied by a shorter DF lifetime of only 10.4 μs. Through sophisticated device engineering, they successfully developed the potential of pyrimidine as an acceptor core, achieving an EQEmax of 25.1%, a PEmax of 111.0 lm W−1 and a CEmax of 84.9 cd A−1. It is worth mentioning that the device displayed remarkably low efficiency roll-off keeping an EQE of 22.3%, a PEmax of 78.3 lm W−1 and a CEmax of 75.5 cd A−1 at a high brightness of 1000 cd m−2, which is attributed to the small ΔEST and short DF lifetime. The performance surpassed the previously reported pyrimidine-based TADF devices while even being comparable to those of the state-of-the-art phosphorescent counterparts. The result has gained increasing interest of scientific researchers for the design of pyrimidine-cored TADF emitters.
Compared with high-performance pyrimidine-based green TADF OLEDs, high-efficiency blue TADF emitters are still very lacking, mainly because of their relatively low PLQYs induced by inappropriate molecular orientation and stacking behavior. In order to break through this bottleneck, Yasuda group and Zhang et al. further improved the above-mentioned star-shaped pyrimidine structure by introducing more stronger rigid donor moieties, namely 9,9-diphenyl-9,10-dihydroacridine (DPAC) and 10H-spiro[acridan-9,9′-fluorene] (2SPAc), to replace the original DMAC donor moiety (Fig. 1), respectively.33,34 The experimental results showed that they all almost harvested more than 90% PLQYs and blue emission. Even more to the point, a blue TADF OLED based on a 2SPAc-PPM emitter generated a super high EQE of 31.45%. It turns out that bulky, rigid and steric donor moieties may be more capable of providing higher PLQYs and blue-shifted emission.

The above research mainly involved the modification and improvement of the 4,6-positions of pyrimidine, and meanwhile, the 2-position of pyrimidine was also employed to endow the molecular diverse properties. The Serevičius group designed and synthesized four carbazole-pyrimidine cored compounds, in which the 2-position of the pyrimidine ring was decorated with methyl, 4-ethylphenyl, methylthio and 4-dimethylaminophenyl units, respectively.35 The sulphur-containing methylthio and 4-dimethylaminophenyl fragments were selected to strengthen the ISC process with the help of the internal heavy atom effect and enhance the ICT ability via the strong electron-donating unit, respectively. The four compounds exhibited a transition from room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) to TADF properties, only by modifying the 2-position of the pyrimidine acceptor. In our group, the introduction of a halogen at the 2-position of the pyrimidine ring is a feasible strategy for shortening DF lifetimes of TADF emitters without sacrificing their PLQYs.36 Their transient PL characters showed that the DF lifetimes of ClPPM and BrPPM were significantly reduced to 1.3 μs compared to the reported halogen-free emitter PXZPM due to the heavy atomic effect of the halogens, and surprisingly, their PLQYs were slightly enhanced over 90%. Thus, the 2-position of the pyrimidine ring can also be expected to achieve distinctive triplet excitons harvesting through flexible molecular design.
In addition to optimizing the 2,4,6-positions of pyrimidines in this section, the conjugated phenylene also can be further modified. Even if a large steric hindrance between the donor and acceptor units can achieve a small ΔEST, the strong torsion conformation of D–A fragments may weaken the vibronic coupling between local triplet excited state (3LE) and charge transfer triplet excited state (3CT), which is not conducive to high-performance TADF emitters. In recent years, Serevičius and partners have developed a series of fine-tuned pyrimidine-cored TADF emitters for changing their geometry and rigidity of the molecular structure by inserting methyl at the different positions of the phenylene fragment.37–39 The phenylene modified with methyl substituent could slightly alter the emission spectrum while obviously impacting on the kRISC, which was crucial to TADF properties.37 The increase of the four methyl groups brought a negative impact on PTZ-2mPYR for an efficient TADF property, on the contrary, the excessive steric hindrance of the phenothiazine unit resulted in a negligible kRISC. However, they also found that PTZ-mPYR with a less sterically constrained donor unit had a remarkably prolonged TADF lifetime because of a large ΔEST.38 From this perspective, both a more flexible and an overly rigid molecular structure are adverse to the construction of high-performance TADF materials, so it is very important to precisely control the balance between molecular structure and vibronic coupling actions. Recently, they continue to utilized methyl as a regulator of steric hindrance between donor and acceptor units, and phenoxazine as a donor to mildly manipulate the molecular structure.39 The phenoxazine was selected as the donor unit rather than phenothiazine because of its planarity, enduring more steric constraint.38 The results showed a pyrimidine derivative PXZ-mdPYR with an ortho-methyl fragment had a large ΔEST and a low kRISC, and nevertheless, the meta-methyl modified pyrimidine derivative PXZ-muPYR boosted the kRISC up to 6.5 × 106 s−1 and shortened the DF lifetime down to only 800 ns in toluene, capturing an exceptional EQE peak value of 29.1% for the PXZ-muPYR-based TADF device.
Considering that only a small amount of deep-blue TADF materials has been reported to date, Sasabe and Kido groups also designed pyrimidine-based TADF emitters, containing different numbers of methyl substituents at pyrimidine and phenylene moieties (Fig. 2).40 The resultant pyrimidine emitter Ac-3MHPM with a high triplet state energy (ET) of 2.95 eV, exhibited a high EQE of 18% and CIE of (0.16, 0.15). Note that from the above references, the utilization of a methyl fine-tuning TADF emitter structure can adjust their ΔESTs, kRISCs and the lifetimes of delayed fluorescence (DFs), which plays a crucial role in OLED performance at high luminance, and can also enlarge the energy bandgap (Eg) for designing blue TADF emitters at the same time.

Bulky donor units directly connected to the ortho- or meta-position of the phenylene-bridge instead of the common para-position linking can also obtain steric hindrance aside from the methyl modification. Zhang and co-workers selected spiro(acridine-9,9′-fluorene) (SPAc) with two orthogonal planes as the donor unit, which was favorable for suppressing the random conformational change.41 The highly twisted conformation made o-2SPAc-PPM and m-2SPAc-PPM possess tiny ΔESTs of 0.025 and 0.1 eV, respectively, which greatly accelerated the kRISC. It was proved that a high kRISC of 3.55 × 107 s−1 for o-2SPAc-PPM and 9.1 × 106 s−1 for m-2SPAc-PPM, much higher than 2.9 × 106 s−1 for p-2SPAc-PPM, was obtained. The o-2SPAc-PPM-based TADF OLED achieved remarkably high EQE of up to 24.8% with weakened efficiency roll-off. These results provide a novel molecular design strategy for high-performance TADF OLEDs.
Inspired by the potential of pyrimidine-cored compounds for highly efficient TADF materials, Lee et al. adopted 2,2′-bipyrimidine as the acceptor core with a more electron-deficient nature than a single pyrimidine unit, thereby gifting deeper LUMO energy levels and reducing the optical band gaps.42 Their donor units, namely DMAC and PXZ, were both nearly perpendicular to the phenylene, resulting in a separation of FMOs. Ac-bpm and Px-bpm exhibited green and yellow emission with an EQE of 17.1% and 14.4% in the TADF device, respectively. Furthermore, in order to inhibit non-radiative decay, two more rigid bipyrimidine TADF molecules formed intramolecular hydrogen bonds only by fine-tuning the direction of the two pyrimidines, instead of connecting bulky donor or acceptor units, which could lock rotatable rings into a planar structure.43 Relying on the orientation of the nitrogen atom on the pyridine ring, the intramolecular hydrogen-bonding and the rigidity of the entire molecular structure could be controlled. Two emitters, 25bpmAc and 55bpmAc, showed PLQYs close to 100%, much higher than the 75% of 22bpmAc. Predictably, the two blue TADF devices fabricated with 25bpmAc and 55bpmAc displayed EQEs of 20.5% and 24.9%, respectively, while the EQE of the 22bpmAc-based device was only 15.7%. The result shows that the introduction of intramolecular hydrogen bonding for increasing the rigidity of the molecular structure is an effective strategy to suppress nonradiative paths. The same design concept has also been applied to the glaring star acceptor moiety-diphenyl sulfone, where two phenylene-bridges were substituted by two pyrimidinyl-bridges to connect the donor and acceptor units. Two pyrimidinyl-bridges created more stabilized plane conformation between the bridge and the donor around the SO2 moiety due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding, while also strengthening the electron-deficient nature of the acceptor.44
4.2 Asymmetrical conformation based on a pyrimidine unit
As described above, pyrimidine-based compounds with symmetrical configuration are a class of promising TADF emitters, which have aroused great interest among researchers in structure–property relationships for effective molecular design strategies. Unlike the relatively simple symmetrical structure, in which two identical donor units are connected, the asymmetrical conformation of pyrimidine is usually linked to only one donor unit, resulting in more diverse types of substitution between donors, other acceptors and pyrimidine unit (Scheme 4b). Thus, their structure–property relationships are still appealing for further study, and their structures are presented in Schemes 6 and 7.
 Scheme 6  Molecular structure of pyrimidine-based TADF small molecules with an asymmetrical D–A conformation. 
 Scheme 7  Molecular structure of pyrimidine-based TADF small molecules with an asymmetrical D–A–A conformation. 
Following the first report on the symmetrical conformation of the pyrimidine ring, Kido and Sasabe once again constructed an asymmetrical D–A structure to investigate the influence of different substitution positions and π-extension of donor units on their photophysical properties and OLEDs performance, where 2,4,6-triphenylpyrimidine (TPPM) tightly connected the donor unit (DMAC) or DMAC modified by two peripheral carbazole groups.45 Due to the different substitution positions on the pyrimidine core, the electron cloud distribution of the LUMO orbital and the overlap of the FMOs displayed significant differences. For the 2-position substituted Ac-46DPPM and 4-position substituted Ac-26DPPM, even though their HOMOs were mainly distributed on the DMAC unit, the LUMO of Ac-46DPPM was mainly concentrated on the diphenylpyrimidine ring, and the latter even extended to the conjugated phenylene-bridge between DMAc and the pyrimidine ring, giving different ICT characteristics. In other words, Ac-46DPPM could be predicted to have a short emission wavelength because of weak ICT, while Ac-26DPPM could be considered to have a long emission wavelength as a result of strong ICT behavior. CzAc-26DPPM not only showed one similar to the overlap of FMO for Ac-26DPPM, but also expanded its HOMO to the two carbazole moieties. In fact, the optical property experiments have proved that their emission peaks of Ac-46DPPM, Ac-26DPPPM, and CzAc-26DPPM in toluene were gradually a bathochromic shift, located at 455, 476, and 496 nm, respectively, deriving from a stronger ICT interaction. All compounds displayed efficient TADF behavior and a blue TADF device with a high EQE close to 25% has been successfully acquired. The results suggest that the ICT character, the emission wavelength, and the TADF property could be controlled through sophisticated molecular engineering.
Chi and coworkers also reported a series of TADF small molecules based on the 2-position and 4-position modification of the pyrimidine core,46 namely, T1–T4, where they were endowed with DMAC to build a twisted conformation again, and the more distinctive design was that an ortho-methyl substituent was introduced into the peripheral phenyl group of the pyrimidine core to reduce π-conjugation. In this case, the 4-position substituted T2 and T4 possessed smaller ΔESTs and higher kRISCs, thus achieving shorter DF lifetimes, compared with the 2-position substituted T1 and T3. Regrettably, the electron-donating ability of the additional o-methyl was not enough to resist the reduction of π-conjugation, so a large ΔEST was formed, resulting in some negative effects, such as a long DF lifetime and a small kRISC. Overall, it can be speculated that T2 would have the optimal performance among T1–T4.
White OLEDs are an inevitable trend as indoor illuminating apparatus or even a type of artwork because of its flexibility, surface light source and adjustable spectrum. However, short-wavelength blue light radiation (380–450 nm) can cause an irreversible blue light hazard to our eyes. Comfortable and healthy white OLEDs can be designed by decreasing the amount of short-wavelength blue light (<450 nm) or selecting long-wavelength blue light (>450 nm). Hence, the development of a bluish-green TADF material is of practical significance. Different from the common para-substitution of the phenylene, Xie et al. utilized meta-substitution to connect two donor units and the pyrimidine ring.47 In order to achieve bluish-green emission rather than blue emission, they further replaced a phenyl on the pyrimidine ring with a biphenyl group to increase π-conjugation. Due to the expansion of conjugation, the LUMO of DMAC-BPP was widely dispersed on the phenylene-bridge, pyrimidine core and additional biphenyl group, whereas the HOMO was still mainly located on the two donor units of DMAC. The small overlap of FMOs brought a tiny ΔEST of 0.03 eV and DMAC-BPP exhibited an emission peak of 502 nm in toluene. The TADF OLED incorporating DMAC-BPP as the emitter delivered bluish-green emission with an EQE of 13.0% and moreover, the EQE of the blue-hazard-free hybrid white OLED employing DMAC-BPP as the host and emitter could reach 15.6% with low efficiency roll-off. This result indicates there is still a broad operating space in molecular design and potential application prospects for bluish-green TADF materials applied in blue-hazard-free white OLEDs.
After the rapid development of TADF materials, the EQEs of TADF-OLEDs for full-wave band colors have achieved a leap, even exceeding 30%. However, they basically benefited from the innovation of the acceptor unit except for the device process technology. The limited donor library has virtually become an obstacle to designing novel TADF emitters and regulating the emission wavelength. Inspired by the fusion strategy of indolocarbazole and diindenocarbazole, which merged two or three carbazole units into one donor molecule, more recently, Wang group designed and synthesized a series of novel acridine–carbazole hybrid donors by the combination of two classical donors of carbazole and DMAC.48,49 Such donor molecules have rarely been reported owing to the complex synthesis routes. They selected the 4-position substituted pyrimidine ring with smaller ΔESTs and higher kRISCs as the acceptor core according to a previous report. It is worth mentioning that the new luminogen, 34AcCz-PM, featured simultaneously both AIE and TADF properties, which could restrain the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) problem of TADF emitters to a certain extent. With the assistance of the AIE characteristic, 34AcCz-PM possessed a higher PLQY of 67% in neat film and more notably, its DF lifetimes were only 0.73/0.64 μs in doped/neat film, which undoubtedly greatly improved the kRISC up to 15.27 × 105/8.97 × 105 s−1, respectively. As anticipated, a high-efficient doped OLED of 34AcCz-PM was fabricated, providing an EQE of 22.6%, and still maintained an EQE of 20.1% even at a high luminance of 5000 cd m−2. The corresponding nondoped OLED also realized an excellent EQE of 14.1%. This work provides a design idea for donor materials and broadens the donor library.
Cz and DMAc were fused into a hybrid donor and the superiority of the Ac–Cz hybrid donor was witnessed by the excellent performance of the corresponding TADF emitters, which encouraged the Wang group to further investigate the effect of steric hindrance. They synthesized two Ac–Cz-fused donors with 1,2-position and 2,3-position connections, namely 12AcCz and 23AcCz.49 Consistent with the above-described 34AcCz-PM, they still used the 4-substituted pyrimidine as the acceptor core to obtain two new luminogens, 12AcCz-PM and 23AcCz-PM, whereas they presented completely different structure and properties. It is obvious that the rotation of the phenylene moiety was restricted due to the excessively congested connection in 12AcCz-PM, forcing 12AcCz to be crooked. Their dihedral angles between the Ac–Cz-fused donors and TPPM were evaluated at 158.4° for 12AcCz-PM and 89.3° for 23AcCz-PM, respectively. Therefore, 12AcCz-PM with a quasi-axial conformation was identified as no TADF behavior on account of a large overlapping of FMOs, while 23AcCz-PM with a small steric hindrance exhibited a quasi-equatorial conformation and possessed a notable TADF feature. 23AcCz-PM with an orthogonal structure was used for TADF-OLED, exhibiting an ultra-high EQE of 28.4% and low efficiency roll-off (EQE of 20.7% at 5000 cd m−2). The result indicated 12AcCz-PM with a large steric hindrance was more likely to form a nearly planar quasi-axial conformation among the three Ac–Cz hybrid donors, which was not conducive to a molecular TADF property. The consistent conclusion was verified by the use of 12BxAc and 34BxAc, namely acridine-benzofuran/benzothiophene hybrid donors, which was also combined with the 4-substituted pyrimidine ring.50 34BxAc-PM was superior to12BxAc-PM in terms of ΔEST, DF lifetime and PLQY. The 34BFAc-PM-based TADF device realized an EQE of 27.7% and gained a low efficiency roll-off as well. Compared with universal donor units such as carbazole, acridine, dibenzofuran and so on, the hybrid donors, which were realized by the fusion strategy of different donors, are more versatile and can enrich the barren donor library. Furthermore, they are suitable to effectively modulate the photoelectric properties for high-efficiency TADF emitters.
Up to now, the performances of red and green phosphorescence emitters have matched the requirements of market applications, whether efficiency, stability, or color purity. However, the integrated performances of blue OLEDs still lag behind their red and green counterparts, especially deep-blue OLEDs. Hence, further development of highly efficient blue or deep-blue materials is vital, and it is also quite a challenge to seek appropriate building blocks of donor and acceptor units for satisfying both high EQE and high color purity. The electron-withdrawing ability of pyrimidine is weaker than the widely-used triazine, endowing a wide energy bandgap, which is the premise of deep-blue emission. In addition, the pyrimidine unit has the advantage of being easily functionalized with various groups, thereby regulating its photophysical and electrochemical properties. Yasuda envisaged the 2-position substituted pyrimidine ring as a universal acceptor core, then they took a distinctive approach to make a pre-twisted D–A architecture for deep-blue TADF materials by selecting a spiroacridan-based donor unit with large steric repulsion, besides DMAC.51 All target molecules embodied highly twisted conformation with close to orthogonal between the bulky spiroacridan/acridan-based donor unit and the adjacent phenylene-bridge. The good separation of the FMOs made them have small ΔESTs in the range of 0.25–0.30 eV, giving a TADF nature. The intense deep-blue emission peaks of 1–5 in toluene ranging from 448 to 460 nm were detected by photophysical test. Multilayer OLEDs based on 1–5 emitters demonstrated bright blue emissions from 458 nm to 470 nm with an EQE of up to 20.4% and CIE of (0.16, 0.23). This design strategy of utilizing pyrimidine as a general platform combined with a bulky donor unit further broadens the donor library, and provides a great prospect for the development of high-performance deep-blue TADF materials.
In the past few years, a large number of D–A style materials comprised of diversiform electron-donating units bridged to different position-substituted pyrimidines via π-linkers have been reported to reflect the various degrees of success of pyrimidine-based TADF materials. However, among diverse acceptor units with high triplet state energies (ETs), TADF emitters adopting pyrimidine as acceptors performed relatively inferior performance compared to those including the star acceptor unit-triazine, arising from the inherent insufficient electron-withdrawing ability. In order to improve the subtle electronic interactions, a new type of D–A–A pyrimidine-based TADF material was developed by elaborate structural manipulation (Scheme 7).
Wu and Wong et al. utilized the orientation of the CN-substituted pyrimidine ring toward the donor unit – DMAC as a structural tuning factor to regulate the degree of ICT.52 Two asymmetrical molecules with different orientations were easily modulated, namely 5-substituted Pm2 and 2-substituted Pm5, giving different ortho–ortho steric hindrances between the phenylene and the terminal CN-substituted pyrimidine ring. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated they had a nearly vertical highly twisted configuration between the phenylene and DMAC, while twist angles between the phenylene and pyrimidine ring of 37.4° and 0° were observed for Pm2 and Pm5, respectively, mainly due to the two C–H bonds on the pyridine ring of Pm2 facing the phenylene-bridge and thus the ortho–ortho interaction was induced. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) revealed that the reduction potential of Pm5 was lower than that of Pm2, which was consistent with the relative electron-withdrawing ability, videlicet, Pm5 > Pm2. Their emissions of 524 nm for Pm2 and 543 nm for Pm5 were gradually bathochromically shifted in toluene with the increase of electron-withdrawing strength as supported by the discussion above. Yet importantly, the extremely small ΔESTs of 0.09–0.04 eV endowed the typical TADF nature of two CN-substituted pyrimidine compounds, accompanying highly promising 95–100% PLQYs in the doped film. Ultra-highly efficient TADF OLEDs equipping with EQEs of up to 31.3%/30.6%, CEs up to 104.5/103.7 cd A−1 and PEs up to 117.2/116.3 lm W−1 were achieved employing Pm2 and Pm5, respectively, which were among the best level ever reported.
The excellent building block of pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile for TADF materials was also noticed by Lee's group. Firstly, two types of TADF emitters with different donor units extended from either the 2- or 4-position of the pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile moiety were constructed to research the effect of the substituent position of the donor unit on the TADF property.53 9-Phenyl-9H,9′H-3,3′-bicarbazole (bicarbazole) and 5-phenyl-5,12-dihydroindolo[3,2-a]carbazole (indolocarbazole) were used as uncommon donor units. Roughly, their HOMOs on the donor unit and the LUMOs on the acceptor unit in four new molecules were clearly separated. However, the LUMO distribution still showed a slight difference in the 2- and 4-position substituted TADF molecules, in which the 2-position substituted emitters, 2PyCNICz and 2PyCNBCz, displayed fairly widespread distribution of LUMOs over the whole acceptor moiety and phenylene-bridge, while the 4-position substituted emitters, 4PyCNICz and 4PyCNBCz, showed localized distributions with little LUMO on the phenylene. In addition, the twist angles between the pyrimidine ring and phenylene for 4PyCNICz and 4PyCNBCz were significantly larger than that of the 2-position substituted emitters also due to steric hindrances and lack of hydrogen bonding. The variation in FMOs and molecular structures would inevitably induce diverse photoelectric properties. For example, the 4-position substituted emitters possessed smaller ΔESTs of 0.18 eV, which were mainly due to the high triplet energy level caused by the large twisted conformation from the phenylene-bridge to the pyrimidine ring, and correspondingly with higher kRISCs. As a result, a high EQE of 19.8% and long device lifetime surpassing that of the state-of-the-art green TADF emitter (4CzIPN) were acquired using the 4PyCNBCz emitter. Inspired by this strategy, they again used pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile to combine with a stronger donor unit of 5,10-diphenyl-10,15-dihydro-5H-diindolo[3,2-a:3′,2′-c]carbazole (TruX). The TADF material (PyCNTruX) based on the strong D–A–A structure brought about a high kRISC of 9.72 × 10−5 for efficient energy transfer in the meantime with a high EQE of 21.6%.54
Other secondary acceptor fragments, such as trifluoromethyl (–CF3), can also be employed as an effective electron acceptor in constructing D–A–A conformation for pyrimidine-based deep blue TADF materials.55 Chi and Wang et al. focused on pyrimidine–pyridine hybrid acceptors and rigid spiro-acridine donor materials, combining the synergistic effects of intra- or inter-molecular hydrogen bonds to adjust the photophysical properties of TADF materials.56,57 These functional 2,6-dipyridylpyrimidine TADF compounds displayed higher PLQYs and kRISCs than their analogues without pyridine assistance.57 The ingenious molecular structure design enabled the electroluminescence spanning from deep blue to blue with high EQEs of more than 20%.
5. Pyrazine-based TADF materials
Different from the variability with pyrimidine as the acceptor core, the structural change of pyrazine is relatively plain, in which it basically combines the aromatic π system to build different D–A structures. According to the type of aromatic π system, it can be roughly divided into the following four categories: benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene and acenaphthene (Scheme 8). As a result, it is not surprising that their fluorescence emissions are generally redshifted compared to pyrimidine derivatives. Similarly, their photophysical, electrochemical properties and related device performances have been listed in Tables 5 and 6.

The pyrazine linked to the neutral phenyl ring as the π-conjugated unit is called quinoxaline. Adachi reported the first TADF emitter (DACQ, a green TADF molecule) based on a quinoxaline acceptor,58 featuring a combination of carbazolyl and diphenylamino groups as electron donors (Scheme 9). Then, our group conducted a series of investigations on the photoelectric effect of the quinoxaline system (Schemes 9 and 10). Compared with the high-efficiency blue and green TADF-based OLEDs, efficient orange/red TADF-based OLEDs are still very limited, due to the contradiction between small ΔEST and high fluorescence radiative rate (kSr) for long-wavelength TADF emitters.

 Scheme 10  Overview of our group's works on the quinoxaline system. 
In 2016, we designed a new orange-red TADF emitter (FDQPXZ) by incorporating a fluorine-substituted qunioxaline as an electron-acceptor and a phenoxazine as an electron-donor. Through this rational molecular design, the balance between a small ΔEST and a high kSr was realized. The OLEDs using FDQPXZ as the emitter achieved a maximum EQE of 13.9% and 9.0% for the vacuum- and solution-processed OLEDs, respectively. FDQPXZ was the first reported high-efficiency orange-red TADF emitter capable of both evaporation and solution processes. The device efficiencies were among the highest values for orange/red TADF-based OLEDs reported at that time.59 Through adjusting the electron-donating abilities of the donor unit as well as the dihedral angle between the donor and acceptor, the value of ΔEST and the nature of T1 can be systematically tuned. Successfully, we have achieved the emission type from local excited-state (LE) to charge-transfer state (CT) transition to acquire an orange TADF molecule of BDQDMAC.60 In terms of D–A structure, the design principles of organic RTP molecules are analogous to those of TADF molecules. Therefore, a new organic molecule (DBQPXZ) with quinoxaline as the electron acceptor and phenoxazine as the electron donor was firstly demonstrated utilizing triplet excitons to possess TADF and RTP performance simultaneously. We revealed that the two triplet recycling channels are thermally controlled, and observed a clear threshold temperature of 170 K. The OLED by using DBQPXZ achieved an EQEmax of 16.8% and a maximum luminance of 38304 cd m−2, which was among the highest of the TADF-based yellow-emissive OLEDs.61 Currently, the TADF-based OLEDs usually show a notoriously rapid efficiency roll-off due to serious concentration quenching. To address this issue, we elaborately designed and synthesized a series of new emitters with both TADF and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties in a quinoxaline framework, simultaneously achieving high efficiency and low efficiency roll-off for OLEDs.62,63 High PLQY and simple molecular structure in a full-color emitting material system are two crucial issues for cost-effective multicolor display applications. Encouraged by the variable photoelectric properties of quinoxaline derivatives, a versatile fluorescent core of a pyrido[2,3-b]pyrazine unit was designed and synthesized. A series of asymmetric D–A type molecules based on pyrido[2,3-b]pyrazine in only two simple steps exhibited a wide range of emission spanning the entire visible region from blue (459 nm) to red (644 nm). Through systematically fine-tuning donor units, two TADF molecules, SBPQ-DPAC and SBPQ-DMAC, were obtained and the resulting OLEDs showed yellow and orange emission with high EQEs of up to 20.0% and 15.4%, respectively.64 In addition, the remarkable mechanoluminescence (MCL) with quinoxaline as the acceptor core was also achieved by introducing a carbazole and iminodibenzyl derivative (OIDBQx).65,66
Another structural modification for the quinoxaline module is to add acceptor units such as a fluorine atom and cyano group to achieve the purpose of regulating the luminescent performance. As shown in Scheme 11, our group designed and synthesized two new orange-red emitters, DMAC-CNQ and FDMAC-CNQ, by comprising DMAC as the donor and rigid quinoxaline together with a fluorine atom and cyano group as the acceptor. These two multifunctional emitters showed polymorph-dependent emission, and were equipped with TADF, AIE and multicolor MCL features at the same time. This work reveals the relationship between the aggregation states and TADF properties in depth.67 Lee reported two quinoxalinedicarbonitrile units, namely quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (6,7-DCQx) and quinoxaline-5,8-dicarbonitrile (5,8-DCQx), in which t-butylcarbazole and DMAC were used as donor units to construct TADF molecules. The strong electron-withdrawing ability of the quinoxalinedicarbonitrile acceptor made the emission from yellow to red. It is worth noting that even though the TADF emitters with 5,8-DCQx as the acceptor had a redshift of nearly 40 nm than 6,7-DCQx-based TADF emitters, the EQEs of the device exceeded 20% irrespective of the acceptor, proving the effectiveness of these two acceptor units as the building block. All four target molecules had small ΔESTs and high PLQYs.68 White OLEDs based on full TADF emitters are regarded as a promising manufacturing strategy on account of the high efficiency and low cost. Two new TADF emitters (TFM-QP and CN-QP) were developed by selecting trifluoromethyl and cyano groups as the additional electron acceptor unit of the quinoxaline module. Small ΔESTs of 0.03–0.04 eV and long lifetimes of 1.6–5.0 μs confirmed their TADF properties. Using CN-QP and the classic sky blue TADF emitter (DMAC-DPS), a single-emitting-layer doped full-TADF white OLED was fabricated, exhibiting excellent performance with a high EQE of 20.16%, a CE of 48.22 cd A−1, a PE of 50.47 lm W−1 and a low turn-on voltage of 2.8 V, which should be the highest recorded among similar devices previously reported.69 The design and synthesis of highly efficient deep red (DR) and near-infrared (NIR) TADF materials remains a huge challenge as the emission wavelength further redshifts leading to a sharp increase in nonradiative transition rate. Wang and co-workers used triphenylamine and quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (QCN) to construct an asymmetric D–A TADF molecule (TPA-QCN). The TPA-QCN with an orange-red emission of 585 nm in dilute toluene reflected a concentration-dependent luminescent characteristic. Upon the concentration varying from 15 to 100 wt%, the electroluminescence (EL) spectra maxima shifted from 644 to 728 nm.70
 Scheme 11  Molecular structure of quinoxaline-based TADF small molecules with D–A–A conformation, and single-pyrazine cored TADF structures. 
Unlike quinoxaline units that have been extensively studied, there are also a few reports on D–A style TADF materials with single pyrazine as the acceptor core (Scheme 11). For example, the Su group designed two pyrazine derivatives, PyCN-TC and PyCN-ACR, to discuss the rate constants of the exciton dynamic process, and proved that kRISC was the rate-limited factor for adjusting the long lifetime (τDF).71 In 2019, Kido et al. combined pyrazine and DMAC or PXZ through the 2,6-position of pyrazine to synthesize the compounds 2Ac-PRZ and 2PXZ-PRZ. The obvious separation of FMOs led to effective TADF emission from sky blue to green, in which 2PXZ-PRZ helps to achieve a high-performance OLED with an EQE of 21.4%.72
A new family of TADF emitters based on U-shaped architecture with a novel acceptor of dibenzo-[a,j]phenazine (DBPHZ) has been developed (Scheme 12). High thermal stabilities [Td (5 wt% loss) > 400 °C] and small ΔESTs ranging from 0.02 to 0.20 eV were obtained by all three TADF emitters (t-BuCZ-DBPHZ, MeODPDBPHZ and POZ-DBPHZ). It is worth mentioning that Przemyslaw Data et al. revealed that the lowest excited triplet state of the acceptor unit played a crucial role in the TADF mechanism, that is, when the acceptor unit had the lowest 3LE of the molecule, it could couple with the donor 1CT to provide spin orbit charge transfer (SOCT), thereby providing effective spin-up conversion to harvest triplet excitons. The POZ-DBPHZ-based OLED achieved an EQEmax of about 16%.73 Furthermore, Takeda and coworkers utilized phenothiazine instead of phenoxazine to modify DBPHZ, which not only realized rare tricolor-changeable mechanochromic luminescence properties but also gained a TADF nature. It has been verified by experiments and theoretical calculations that the “two-conformation-switchable” property of the phenothiazine unit played a very important role in the realization of multi-color-changing MCL. The TADF device with orange emission exhibited an EQE of up to 16.8%.74 Considerable efforts have been made to develop efficient blue, green and red-orange TADF materials, however, the exploration of effective long-wavelength TADF materials, especially near-infrared (NIR) materials, remains a huge challenge. Wang et al. introduced a phenanthrene group into the 2,3-dicyanopyrazine unit as a bridge connecting the strong electron-donating group triphenylamine, which increased the π-conjugation and further strengthened the intramolecular charge transfer. The synthesized TPA-DCPP exhibited strong NIR emission (708 nm) with a high PLQY of 14% and typical “AIE + TADF” feature in a neat film (Fig. 3a). The nondoped OLED with EL emission at 710 nm, CIE of (0.70, 0.29) and an EQEmax of 2.1% was obtained. Meanwhile, the doped OLED employing TPA-DCPP as the emitter achieved a high EQE of 9.8% with EL emission at 668 nm. This work provides a molecular design idea for effective deep red (DR) or NIR materials.75 Immediately following the above-mentioned report, the Wang group continued to utilize the 2,3-dicyanopyrazino phenanthrene (DCPP) system to design a series of new TADF materials. DCPP served as the acceptor unit, and carbazole, diphenylamine and DMAC were used as donor units to construct a large and rigid π-conjugated structure. The connection patterns between donor and acceptor units, in terms of the presence or absence of the π-bridge, have also been investigated for the research of the thermodynamic, electrochemical and photoelectrical properties. Yellow to deep-red TADF OLEDs with high EQEs of 14.8% (yellow), 16.9% (orange), 10.1% (red), and 15.1% (deep-red) were realized.76 In addition, the Yasuda group also carried out research on the molecular design and application of efficient long-wavelength TADF materials. By incorporating a phenylene-linked p-ditolylamine or DMAC moiety to the 11,12-dicyanodibenzo[a,c]phenazine[20] (CNBPz) unit, Da-CNBPz (1) and Ac-CNBPz (2) were designed and synthesized. As a comparison of acceptor units, analogous asymmetric configuration TADF materials Da-CNBQx (3) and AcCNBQx (4) containing a less strong acceptor unit [2,3-dicyanodibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline (CNBQx)] were also described. These CNBPz- and CNBQx-based emitters successfully achieved small ΔESTs of 0.03–0.18 eV and red-orange emissions of 561–688 nm with simultaneous high PLQYs of 67–85% in a doped film. CNBPz-based OLEDs indeed displayed intense red emission with 670 and 630 nm, and achieved EQEs of up to 15.0% and 16.2%.77 Therefore, it can be concluded that the strong electron-accepting properties and extended π-conjugation are particularly useful building blocks for the design of long-wavelength TADF materials because they can overcome the barriers of the intrinsic energy gap law.

Beyond the three types described above, there are still a few acenaphthylene-modified pyrazine TADF materials. It is believed that the new acenaphthylene-based acceptor-acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrazine-8,9-dicarbonitrile acceptor (APDC) possesses a stronger electron-withdrawing ability than the 2,3-dicyanopyrazino phenanthrene (DCPP) in Wang's work due to the tendency of forming an aromatic cyclopentadienide structure in the central fuloranthene core. As is illustrated in Scheme 13, Liao et al. reported a high-efficiency NIR TADF emitter, APDC-DTPA, by combining the strong acceptor APDC with two donor units of diphenylamine, showing a very small ΔEST of 0.14 eV. Unsurprisingly, the nondoped device realized NIR emission of 777 nm with a high EQE of 2.19%, and its doped device based on APDC-DTPA achieved a state-of-the-art EQE of 10.19% with emission at 693 nm.78 Different from the traditional multi-donor unit design strategy, Congrave and collaborators believed that it was only necessary to establish an exceptionally stable intramolecular charge transfer state for NIR TADF materials. This is because the multiple peripheral donors usually employed in TADF materials are not directly electron-coupling, although the increase in the number of donors can enhance the net donor strength, meanwhile, discrete electron-donating units are functionalized to inhibit the strength of the acceptor and compromise any red shift. Thus, they replaced a donor unit in APDC-DTPA with an additional CN group to make the most of the D–A structure, because the additional CN group helps to enhance the acceptor strength. The simple and reasonable addition of acceptor unit enhanced the ICT process and realized a TADF emitter (CAT-1) close to 1000 nm, which had an EL peak of 904 nm (Fig. 3b). This advisable strategy offers a new approach for the development of promising NIR TADF materials in the future.79 Long-wavelength TADF materials with similar D–A configuration have also been reported by Qiao and Gong.80,81 Two simple D–A type monomers, TPAAP and TPAAQ, were equipped with a strong and planar acceptor for the formation of J-aggregates, so they had powerful intramolecular charge transfer in the solid state, which could achieve wide-tuning emission from yellow to NIR. OLEDs with TPAAQ and TPAAP as the emitter exhibited highly-efficient EQEs of 15.8% and 14.1% for red and NIR emission, respectively.80 On the basis of the above, our research group replaced diphenylamine with acridine derivatives as the donor unit due to its stronger rigid structure, resulting in high PLQYs of up to 95% and preferentially horizontal ratios of emitting dipole orientation of ≈80%. ANQDC-DMAC and ANQDC-MeFAC-based red OLEDs successfully afforded ultrahigh EQEs of nearly 28% and a PE of above 50 lm W−1, on par with the best results for red TADF OLEDs.81
 Scheme 13  TADF molecules based on acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrazine-8,9-dicarbonitrile and other three-dimensional pyrazine structures. 
Normally, typical TADF molecular design requires direct connection of donor and acceptor units, whether it is direct σ- or π-conjugated D–A connection, so that it has a twisted geometry to minimize the HOMO–LUMO overlap. However, Swager et al. replaced the twisted D–A conformation by through-space interaction, in which electronic communications were carried out by homoconjugation but the FMOs were sufficiently separated to produce a small ΔEST. They placed the diphenylamine-based donor and the quinoxaline-based acceptor on different fins of a triptycene scaffold. Two TADF molecules [TPAQNX(CN)2 and TPA-PRZ(CN)2] were obtained, and showed good physical separation between the donor and the acceptor unit.82
6. Conclusion and outlook
With the increasing demand for high-quality lighting and flat-panel display applications, TADF-OLEDs as a promising solution have been widely studied, as reflected by the astonishing increase in publications over the past decade. Apparently, organic TADF materials can greatly boost OLED performance due to their 100% IQE and low cost, even comparable to the current state-of-the-art OLEDs based on organometallic complexes, enabling large-scale commercial applications in the future.
In the D–A small molecule system, diazine-based materials play an important role in realizing high-efficiency TADF materials. High-performance TADF materials, and even rare deep-blue and near-infrared materials, have been obtained based on pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine units by adjusting the connection position of different donor units and controlling the number of acceptor units. In this review, we have systematically summarized and commented on the achievements made by many researchers on diazine-derived luminescent materials in OLEDs, including the ingenious molecular design strategies, electrochemical and photophysical properties, as well as device performances. In particular, some pyrazine derivants with multipath exciton collection based on the TADF mechanism also have been developed, such as AIE, RTP and MCL, indicating promising multifunctional applications.
We believe that much remains to be explored, particularly regarding the following aspects.
(i) Mechanism of TADF
On one hand, it is generally recognized that ΔEST is a key factor to govern the efficiency of TADF, and the exciton-harvesting process is the result of RISC from T1 to S1, nevertheless, other approaches have been put forward in the literature. For example, the “hidden” 3nπ* transition state and non-adiabatic effects between excited states have clarified the reason for the efficient RISC process with large ΔEST (>0.3 eV).83,84 According to previous studies on the quinoxaline system, we have also proved that TADF not only involves the thermal activation process from T1 to S1, but also from Tn (n ≥ 1) to Sm (m ≥ 1) if the molecule contains quasi-degenerate orbitals. In addition, the presence of the threshold temperature provides a guarantee for the triplet exciton up-conversion process,61 so spin–orbit coupling (SOC) or hyperfine coupling (HFC) can induce the TADF process in some cases.
On the other hand, the research studies of TADF emitters or multifunctional materials are mainly focused on the molecular level, and there are few studies on the relationship between multifunctional property and aggregation morphology. Since different aggregation morphologies determine different properties and behaviors, studying the luminescence mechanism of the aggregation state is therefore important to better understand the relationship between solid-state packing and structure–property, and may even provide a new perspective for insight into multifunctional materials from the aggregation states.
(ii) Lifetime of TADF
Since the triplet excitons of the TADF molecule need to undergo a RISC process, the delayed lifetime is much longer than the prompt lifetime, usually on the order of microseconds (μs), and some even as high as milliseconds (ms). The excessively long exciton lifetime reflects a low kRISC of the TADF material, which is not conducive to the performance of TADF OLEDs. Especially at a high current density, triplet excitons with high concentration and long lifetime may be inactivated by triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA), singlet–triplet annihilation (STA) and triplet-polaron annihilation (TPA), which reduces the utilization of excitons and results in severely efficient roll-off of devices.
(iii) Near-infrared TADF material
There are now abundant examples of high-performance yellow, green, and blue materials, however, there remains a dearth of near-infrared TADF materials with high PLQYs that have potential applications in optical telecommunication, phototherapy devices and night-vision target identification.
(iv) The design strategy of TADF molecular structure
Up to now, TADF molecules usually take advantage of the D–A configuration to construct direct intramolecular charge transfer. However, intermolecular interactions, such as H-bond or π–π interaction, have been proverbially concerned in supramolecular materials, which may be another avenue to design distinctive TADF materials.
