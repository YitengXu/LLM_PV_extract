    , Accepted 18th May 2015First published on 19th May 2015AbstractA CoS2/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposite was synthesized and its sodium storage performances in ether-based electrolyte and commonly used carbonate-based electrolyte were investigated for the first time. A high capacity of 568 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles in ether-based electrolyte can be achieved.
Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have recently gained recognition as intriguing candidates for next-generation battery systems instead of lithium ion batteries (LIBs).1–3 As a class of remarkable sodium storage materials with high capacity for SIBs, considerable efforts have been devoted to investigating the electrochemical properties of various metal sulfides such as TiS2,4 SnS,5 Cu2S,6 Ni3S2,7 MoS2,8 WS29 and FeS2.10–12 The conversion-cum-alloy based anode material SnS was first reported by Dutta et al.5 Such a nanostructured electrode showed a reversible capacity of 325 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at 125 mA g−1. Kim et al. reported the sodium storage performance and electrochemical reaction mechanism of Cu2S.6 The results indicated that this Cu2S electrode exhibits an initial capacity of 294 mA h g−1 which is followed by the formation of NaxCu2S (x < 2), and a decrease to 261 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles. The comparisons of the electrochemical performances of Ni3S2 in different electrolytes were also reported by Kim et al.7 Among the electrolytes, TEGDME with NaCF3SO3 showed the lowest interfacial resistance and good capacity retention (250 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles). Furthermore, carbonaceous support materials were developed for improving the cyclic performance of electrodes. For example, Wang et al. reported on an exfoliated MoS2–C composite with outstanding electrochemical performance,8 in which the MoS2–C electrode could maintain an almost stable capacity of 390 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles. Likewise, Su et al. demonstrated that WS2–graphene nanocomposites exhibit a high reversible capacity of about 590 mA h g−1 and still retain 329 mA h g−1 capacity after 100 cycles.9 Recently, studies indicated that the cyclability of FeS2 can be improved by using an ether-based electrolyte (1.0 M NaCF3SO3 in diglyme) instead of the commonly used carbonate-based electrolyte. In the ether-based electrolyte, the FeS2 electrode could deliver a high sodiation capacity of 530 mA h g−1 and retain 450 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles,11 and 170 mA h g−1 could be achieved after 20000 cycles.12 These works provided rich information on the sodium electrochemistry of metal sulfides and the possibility of using them as storage energy materials for the application and development of rechargeable SIBs. Here, we attempt to extend the investigation to the electrochemical properties of other metal sulfides such as cobalt sulfides.
Cobalt sulfide is an interesting metal chalcogenide semiconductor material and has a number of applications in dye-sensitized solar cells,13 supercapacitors,14 and lithium ion batteries.15 Recently, superior Li-storage properties of cobalt sulfide were achieved by designing special structured materials and fabricating nanocomposites with carbon materials (such as carbon coated materials and graphene hybrid nanocomposites). However, to our knowledge, there is no available report on the sodium electrochemistry of cobalt sulfides.
Here, we report the sodium storage properties of CoS2 materials synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method and compare their electrochemical performances in ether-based electrolyte and commonly used carbonate-based electrolyte. Integration of metal sulfides with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is expected to be effective for enhancing the cyclability of a CoS2 electrode in SIBs as has been previously reported for graphene and other carbonaceous support materials. The morphology changes and the electrochemical performances of both CoS2 and CoS2/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes during discharge–charge processes were investigated.
The structures of samples were investigated by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 1(a) shows XRD patterns of the as-synthesized CoS2 and CoS2–MWCNT composites. The dominant diffraction peaks of both samples correspond to CoS2, which can be indexed to the standard cubic phase of CoS2 (JCPDS Card No. 41-1471). This result indicates that the bare CoS2 and CoS2–MWCNT composites are successfully synthesized without other polysulfides by a simple hydrothermal process. The structural features of the synthesized CoS2 and CoS2–MWCNT samples were examined using Raman spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 1(b). The spectrum of MWCNT is included for comparison. There are two Raman bands at 1600 cm−1 (G band) and 1339 cm−1 (D band) for the MWCNT. Two weak peaks at about 380 cm−1 and 426 cm−1 can be observed from the Raman spectrum of CoS2, which is in close agreement with the data of a CoS2 single crystal.16 As for the CoS2–MWCNT nanocomposites, it is clearly seen that four peaks at 380, 426, 1339 and 1600 cm−1 correspond to the characteristic peaks of CoS2 and the D and G bands of MWCNT, respectively. The thermo-gravimetric results of MWCNT and CoS2–MWCNT composite (Fig. S1, ESI†) indicate a 12% content of MWCNT in the composite. The morphologies and compositions of as-prepared materials were further investigated by TEM and SAED, as shown in Fig. 1(c–f). Obviously, CoS2 particles with an average size of 150–200 nm are anchoring uniformly on the MWCNT (Fig. 1(c)), while the CoS2 nanoparticles prepared without MWCNT (Fig. 1(e)) tend to agglomerate and grow into micron or sub-micron particles. The corresponding SAED patterns of the nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 1(d) and (f), respectively. The discrete diffraction spots can be unambiguously indexed to diffractions of the bare cubic CoS2 phase (JCPDS No. 41-1471). This is consistent with the XRD and Raman spectroscopy results.

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show the discharge–charge curves of CoS2 and CoS2–MWCNT electrodes, respectively, in 1.0 M NaCF3SO3-DGM electrolyte at a current density of 100 mA g−1. In the initial discharge process, the CoS2 electrode exhibits two obvious flat voltage plateaus at 1.4 and 1.1 V. The first discharge curve of the CoS2/Na battery is similar to that of the CoS2/Li battery in the voltage range from 1.0 V to 2.9 V; the CoS2/Li battery shows two discharge voltage plateaus at 1.6 and 1.2 V in the first discharge process,15 implying that the CoS2/Na battery may display a similar discharge reaction mechanism to the CoS2/Li battery. In the first cycle, the CoS2 electrode delivers a high discharge capacity of 810 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 697 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 86%. The discharge–charge voltage profiles of the CoS2–MWCNT electrode (Fig. 2(b)) are very similar to those of the CoS2 electrode and the first discharge–charge capacities of the CoS2–MWCNT electrode are 826 and 770 mA h g−1, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency of 93%. This result indicates that the incorporation of MWCNT does not change the electrochemical mechanism of the CoS2 electrode. For the subsequent cycles, the discharge–charge curves of CoS2 and CoS2–MWCNT electrodes almost overlap, indicating that a highly reversible process takes place during the subsequent cycles. For the 2nd and 10th cycle, CoS2 electrodes exhibit discharge capacities of 640 and 599 mA h g−1, while the CoS2–MWCNT electrodes still remain at higher capacities of 735 and 704 mA h g−1, respectively. These results demonstrate that CoS2–MWCNT electrodes present higher capacity and better stability than those of bare CoS2 electrodes. The same conclusion can also be made by using 1.0 M NaClO4-EC/PC as an electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of both CoS2 and CoS2–MWCNT electrodes in 1.0 M NaClO4-EC/PC electrolyte under the same current density were tested and are shown in Fig. S2(a and b) (ESI†). In the initial cycle, the CoS2 electrode displayed a discharge capacity of 809 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 631 mA h g−1 with a low coulombic efficiency of 78%, whereas the values for the CoS2–MWCNT electrode were 815 and 722 mA h g−1. In the subsequent cycles, the reversible discharge capacities of CoS2 were 724 and 585 mA h g−1 for the 2nd and 10th cycles and they were 735 and 701 mA h g−1 for the CoS2–MWCNT electrode. For comparison, the pure MWCNT electrodes in the same conditions were investigated. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the MWCNT electrodes display initial discharge capacities of 14 and 11 mA h g−1 in 1.0 M NaCF3SO3-DGM and 1.0 M NaClO4-EC/PC, respectively. These results indicate that the high discharge–charge capacity of CoS2–MWCNT electrodes in the voltage range 1.0–2.9 V originate almost completely from the electrochemical reactions of CoS2 with Na.

Fig. 2(c and d) displays the cycling performances of CoS2 and CoS2–MWCNT electrodes in ether and carbonate based electrolytes at a current density of 100 mA h g−1. For the CoS2 electrode in NaClO4-EC/PC shown in Fig. 2(c), the specific capacity rapidly drops to less than 170 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The capacity of this CoS2 electrode in NaCF3SO3-DGM decreases to 347 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, which is 2 times greater than that in NaClO4-EC/PC. However, after 100 cycles, the CoS2 electrode in NaCF3SO3-DGM shows a capacity of 190 mA h g−1, which is 23.5% of the first discharge capacity. In contrast, CoS2–MWCNT electrodes display surprisingly good cyclability with capacity retentions of 411 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles in NaClO4-EC/PC (Fig. 2(d)), which is above 50% of the first discharge capacity. For the CoS2–MWCNT electrode in NaCF3SO3-DGM, the capacity is maintained at 568 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (69% of first discharge capacity), which is significantly higher than that of the CoS2–MWCNT electrode in NaClO4-EC/PC and almost 3 times that of the CoS2 electrode in the same conditions. As listed in Table S1 (ESI†), the 100th discharge capacity of the CoS2–MWCNT electrode in NaCF3SO3-DGM is the highest of all metal-based electrodes reported. In addition, the CoS2–MWCNT electrode possesses the highest energy density of 1027 W h kg−1, indicating that CoS2–MWCNT can be considered as one of the most promising energy storage material for SIBs.
The outstanding cycling behavior of the CoS2–MWCNT electrode is also shown in the rate capability. In Fig. 2(e), it can be seen that the CoS2 electrode in NaCF3SO3-DGM displays discharge capacities of 636.4, 553.7, 470.5 and 393.6 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 A g−1, respectively. For comparison, discharge capacities of the CoS2 electrode in NaClO4-EC/PC are found to be 626.1, 349.4, 296.2, and 242.3 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 A g−1, respectively. It is clear that the rate performance of CoS2 in NaCF3SO3-DGM is better than that of the same electrode in NaClO4-EC/PC. In the same way, the CoS2–MWCNT electrode also shows better rate performance in NaCF3SO3-DGM than in NaClO4-EC/PC. As shown in Fig. 2(f), discharge capacities of the CoS2–MWCNT in NaCF3SO3-DGM are about 726.6, 687, 621 and 550.5 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 A g−1, respectively, while discharge capacities of 665.6, 572.7, 522.4 and 448.6 mA h g−1 at the same current densities are obtained in NaClO4-EC/PC. The good reversibility, rate capability and cyclic performance of these electrodes in NaCF3SO3-DGM is similar to results reported for the Na–FeS2 system in the literature,11,12 in which the ether-based electrolyte was believed to suppress the reactions between possible sodium polysulfides and electrolyte. After 50 cycles at different current densities, the CoS2–MWCNT electrodes retain reversible capacities of 679 and 548 mA h g−1 in NaCF3SO3-DGM and NaClO4-EC/PC electrolytes respectively, while the values for the CoS2 electrodes are only 414 and 200 mA h g−1 respectively.
In order to reveal the origin of the better electrochemical performance of the CoS2–MWCNT electrodes, ex situ TEM and SAED techniques were utilized to examine the compositions and structures of the discharged and charged products. Fig. 3(a–c) shows TEM images and corresponding SAED patterns of CoS2–MWCNT electrodes after the first discharge to 1.0 V. The data for CoS2 are included for comparison (Fig. 3(d–f)). The particles are observed for the sodiated products with an average size of 200 nm (Fig. 3(a)). The enlarged TEM image of a fully sodiated CoS2 particle (Fig. 3(b)) shows that nanograins with sizes of about 5 nm are uniformly distributed in the matrix phase. The corresponding SAED pattern of this area is shown in Fig. 3(c) and all diffraction rings can be perfectly indexed as a mixture of Na2S (JCPDS No. 23-0441) and Co (JCPDS No. 15-0806). As shown in Fig. S5(a) (ESI†), the typical nanograins with fringe spacings of 0.20 nm and 0.33 nm can be well indexed as the (111) planes of Co and the (111) planes of Na2S, respectively. As a result, nanograins in the enlarged TEM image can be assigned to Co grains (marked by red circles) and the matrix can be indexed to a Na2S phase (marked by a black arrow). It is interesting to find that the TEM images of bare CoS2 electrodes after discharge to 1.0 V (Fig. 3(d)) are utterly different from those of the CoS2–MWCNT electrodes; significant particle aggregation of the sodiated products can be observed after the bare CoS2 electrode is discharged. As shown in the enlarged TEM image (Fig. 3(e)), aggregation of sodiated products seems to result in the cracking of the particles, which may be responsible for the poor electrochemical performance of bare CoS2 electrodes. The main components of the discharge product are also confirmed to be Co and Na2S phases by SAED (Fig. 3(f)) and HRTEM results (Fig. S5(b), ESI†). According to the TEM results described above, the evolution processes of CoS2–MWCNT and bare CoS2 electrodes before and after the first discharge to 1.0 V are illustrated in Fig. 3(g). For CoS2–MWCNT electrodes, CoS2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the MWCNT as shown in Fig. 1(c). Apparently, the sizes of CoS2 nanoparticles in CoS2–MWCNT electrodes are smaller than those in the bare CoS2 electrodes (Fig. 1(e)), and MWCNT could efficiently prevent the CoS2 nanoparticles from aggregating. After the CoS2–MWCNT and bare CoS2 electrodes are discharged to 1.0 V, the composition of both electrodes changes from CoS2 into metal Co and Na2S. Because of both the strength and flexibility of MWCNT, active particle separation or aggregation can be obviated during the discharge process. CoS2–MWCNT could ensure that nanosized metal Co is uniformly distributed in the Na2S matrix after discharge to 1.0 V, quite unlike bare CoS2 electrodes.

When CoS2–MWCNT electrodes are charged to 2.9 V, the nanoparticles with the size of 200 nm are dispersed randomly on the MWCNT network and appear almost the same as they did initially, indicating the good reversibility of these electrodes (Fig. S6(a), ESI†). The SAED pattern in this region is shown in Fig. S6(b) (ESI†). All d-spacing derived from SAED spectra can be well indexed to cubic CoS2 (JCPDS No. 41-1471). The existence of CoS2 after charging to 2.9 V provides direct evidence of the conversion reaction of Co and Na2S into CoS2, which can be further supported by XAFS results shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The electrochemical reaction mechanisms of both CoS2–MWCNT and CoS2 electrodes with sodium are the same, and can be expressed as CoS2 + 4Na+ + 4e− ↔ Co + 2Na2S,(1)but their electrochemical performances are quite different. The CoS2–MWCNT electrode could deliver a discharge capacity of 568 mA h g−1 in NaCF3SO3-DGM after 100 cycles while the discharge capacity of only 190 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles is preserved for the CoS2 electrode in NaCF3SO3-DGM. The discharge reactions of both CoS2–MWCNT and CoS2 electrodes with sodium generate the same discharge products of Co and Na2S (eqn (1)). Interestingly, it can be found that the nanosized metal Co is highly dispersed in the Na2S matrix as shown in Fig. 3(a) in sodiated CoS2–MWCNT electrodes. However, metal Co is aggregated as shown in Fig. 3(e) in sodiated CoS2 electrodes. It is the uniform distribution in the Na2S matrix of the nanosized metal Co formed after the discharge process that is responsible for the better cycling performance of CoS2–MWCNT electrodes than of CoS2 electrodes. Similarly, recent reports have described the use of CNT additives in composite electrodes in improving the cycling behavior in lithium ion batteries in comparison to other carbon additives.17,18 MWCNTs offer three dimensional electron conductive networks with high surface area, which facilitate the fast penetration of sodium ions and diffusion of electrolytes. In addition, MWCNT may be used as an elastic buffer that prevents the breaking up of the electrode while keeping intact the structural integrity of active nanoparticles. These advantages for using MWCNTs as an additive within composite electrodes in sodium ion batteries should play an important role in increasing the reversible capacity, enhancing the rate capability, and improving cyclability.
CoS2–MWCNT nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal process and the MWCNT was found to play an important role in the excellent electrochemical performance of CoS2–MWCNT electrodes. In addition, the electrochemical performance of CoS2–MWCNT electrodes in NaCF3SO3-DGM was better than that in NaClO4-EC/PC electrolyte, indicating that the NaCF3SO3-DGM electrolyte is a good choice for the Na–CoS2 system. Furthermore, the huge energy density of 1027 W h kg−1 was obtained for the CoS2–MWCNT electrode, which is the highest value among all metal-based electrodes reported. Our results have demonstrated that integration of CoS2 with MWCNT and optimization of electrolyte are beneficial for the reversibility of the CoS2 electrode, thereby offering fundamental concepts to the rational design of metal sulfides with higher performance for SIBs.
