    , Accepted 23rd January 2018First published on 23rd January 2018AbstractSpectral up-conversion (UC) has been attracting growing interest for the effective harvesting of the near-infrared (NIR) part of sunlight for photocatalytic hydrogen production and environmental purification. We present evidence of NIR-to-UV-VIS photon conversion for degradation of organic dyes and hydrogen and oxygen evolution via water-splitting by TiO2 and Rh–Cr oxide-loaded SrTiO3:Al photocatalysts, respectively.
The efficient use of energy from the sun is probably the main pillar of the challenging paradigm shift of the existing energetic model for tackling climate change through artificial photosynthesis, the “hydrogen economy” and solar fuel generation.1–4 In this context, there is a growing interest in harvesting energy from the large near-infrared (NIR) range of solar radiation (approx. 60% in terms of the photon number or 40% of the energy from the sun's total incoming radiation) for various energy and environmental applications.5 The immediate goal is to bridge the gaps of photocatalysts by shifting NIR photons into UV-VIS ones through up-conversion (UC) photonic mechanisms.6
In this context, rare-earth elements (RE) have emerged as an important group of the most strategic raw materials in many industrial and technological areas,7 in particular, owing to their unique ability to absorb and re-emit photons with different energies. Thus, spectral conversion processes pave the way for enhancing the efficiency of solar energy harvesting schemes, in both photovoltaics and photocatalysis, where currently separate spectral ranges of solar radiation are not efficiently utilized. In the last few decades, this photonic approach has been applied for increasing the efficiency of conventional silicon solar cells for third generation photovoltaics, which has led to significant results.8–11 Up-conversion effects have also been studied for further applications in NIR-induced photoreactions using up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), as reviewed by Wu et al.,12 as well as in biomedical fields; namely, imaging, thermal sensing, and photodynamic therapy.13 There are also some other technical emerging applications such as NIR-induced photopolymerization of organic resins for 3D-printing technologies or odontology.14,15
As for up-conversion driven photocatalytic applications, Kim et al.16 have published results of experiments concerning methylene blue (MB) degradation using the aggregates of TiO2 and RE-doped phosphors as photocatalysts, and 100% decontamination was reached in 13 hours using only visible light. Also, MB degradation via Yb3+–Tm3+ doped NaYF4 UCNPs and g-C3N4 catalysts under excitation with a 1 W 980 nm fiber laser has been reported by Huang et al.17 UC-driven degradation of organic dyes has also been recently established by Zhang et al.,18,19 reporting 60% degradation of RhB molecules after 6 hours using NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ and TiO2 under 8 W 980 nm laser diode radiation,18 and a similar percentage for methylene orange degradation for 12 hours using a BiFeO3–UC NaGdF4:Er3+,Yb3+ mixture excited with visible and NIR radiation simultaneously.19 As for UC-driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions, a NaYF4:Tm3+,Yb3+–Y3Al5O12:Er3+/MoS2–NaTaO3 composite has been used for NIR and VIS to UV spectral conversion, providing additional useful photons for enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency.20 Therefore, this photonic approach may be applied in both wastewater decontamination and efficient activation of water-splitting photocatalysts, using low cost NIR laser arrays. In addition, solar concentrators can be used to optically redirect NIR radiation onto UC materials of this type for enhancing the photocatalytic response.
In this work, we have successfully achieved photocatalytic degradation of organic dye (MB) on the one hand, using commercial TiO2 photocatalyst, and on the other hand, hydrogen and oxygen evolution via water-splitting using Al-doped SrTiO3 (STO:Al) photocatalyst, loaded with rhodium–chromium oxide (RhCrOx) as a hydrogen evolution cocatalyst21 in order to enable the overall water-splitting reaction. Both experiments have been carried out under low-power commercial 980 nm laser irradiation, using the UV-blue UC emissions coming from the crystals of K2YbF5:Tm3+ fluoride acting as an efficient spectral converter. These results clearly show evidence that the UC emission by itself can activate photocatalytic processes, without other adsorption or possible side effects due to NIR laser radiation.
Orthorhombic K2YbF5 crystals containing Tm3+ ions were obtained under hydrothermal conditions.16 In detail, fluoride crystals were synthesized by a direct temperature gradient method as a result of the reaction of the aqueous solutions containing 35–40 mol% KF with appropriate oxide mixtures (1 − x)Yb2O3−xTm2O3 at a temperature of about 750 K, a temperature gradient along the reactor body of up to 1 K cm−1, and a pressure of about 100 MPa.22 More details about the structural characterization and synthesis of the up-converting K2YbF5:Tm3+ crystals are provided in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S3).
Optical absorption spectra of the K2YbF5:Tm3+ samples were recorded using an ultraviolet-visible-infrared (UV-VIS-IR) Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9 spectrophotometer with a resolution of 0.5 nm. Up-conversion measurements were carried out using a 980 nm continuous wave near-infrared laser diode with a power of up to 300 mW, focused using a 4× micro-objective with a focal length of 4.51 mm and a numerical aperture of 0.55. The detection of luminescence was realized with a SPEX 1681 0.22 m spectrometer, equipped with a R928 photomultiplier tube. All of the spectra were collected at room temperature and corrected for instrumental response.
For the organic dye degradation experiments, a MB aqueous solution (10 ppm) was prepared, and a corresponding absorption spectrum was recorded, showing an optical density (OD) maximum of about 2.0 at around 664 nm. The aqueous solution of MB and TiO2 (Degussa P25, 0.5 mg ml−1) was prepared by stirring for 30 minutes in the dark. Afterwards, the solution was centrifuged to separate the photocatalyst particles, in order to evaluate the adsorption effect of the TiO2 particles, which reduced the MB concentration by 5–10%. At this point, the initial MB solution was prepared in two identical quartz cuvettes. Then, a quartz tube with a piece of the UC K2YbF5:Tm3+ crystal (of about 1.0 mm3 in size) was inserted inside one of the two identical cuvettes filled with the MB–TiO2 aqueous solution. Then, two 980 nm laser diode beams, with an output power of up to 300 mW, were focused onto the UC K2YbF5:0.2 at% Tm3+ crystal, yielding intense UV-blue UC emissions that passed through the solution during the experiments. Meanwhile, the MB–TiO2 aqueous solution placed in another cuvette was stirred in the dark during the experiments. Finally, after corresponding centrifugation to remove the TiO2 particles, absorption spectra were recorded for these two solutions: the first one corresponding to the MB–TiO2 solution exposed to UV-blue emissions coming from the UC crystal under NIR laser irradiation (for 1 and 2 hours, also with an initial 30 minutes of stirring in the dark), and the second one corresponding to the MB–TiO2 solution maintained in the dark during the same total time for the experiment. The goal was to find a change in the intensity of the 664 nm spectral maximum due to purely UC-driven photocatalytic degradation. Control experiments were also carried out with the MB–TiO2 solution under radiation from the same 980 nm laser but without the UC crystal. A more detailed UC-driven photocatalytic setup description can be found in the ESI† (Fig. S4).
For hydrogen and oxygen evolution via photocatalytic water-splitting, we used a STO:Al photocatalyst prepared using a flux method.21 Using an impregnation method, RhCrOx (Rh 0.1 wt% and Cr 0.1 wt%) was loaded on the SrTiO3:Al photocatalyst in order to act as a hydrogen evolution cocatalyst. To this end, SrTiO3:Al was immersed into an aqueous solution containing appropriate amounts of Na3RhCl6 (Mitsuwa Chemistry) and Cr(NO3)3 (Kanto Chemical). After the water was dried off, the SrTiO3:Al powder impregnated with the Rh and Cr salts was calcined at 623 K for one hour. Finally, water-splitting reactions were carried out in a cylindrical reactor (outer and inner diameters of 20 and 15 mm, respectively) made of Pyrex glass and connected to a closed circulation system. A portion of the RhCrOx-loaded STO:Al composition (2.5 mg) was suspended in distilled water (2.5 ml). A quartz tube (outer and inner diameters of 6 and 4 mm, respectively), containing a few K2YbF5:Tm3+ grains with dimensions of approximately 1 mm3 each, was perpendicularly placed close to the inner wall of the Pyrex glass reactor. The reactor was closed to make air tight with a lid made of quartz and an O-ring and then evacuated until the dissolved air was degassed completely. After argon gas had been injected into the reaction system up to 10 kPa as a circulation gas, the photocatalyst suspension was illuminated with UV-visible light (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 500 nm) from a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a dichroic mirror for a few hours in order to activate the RhCrOx-loaded STO:Al photocatalyst. Thereafter, the reactor was evacuated until hydrogen and oxygen were fully eliminated from the system, and then argon gas was again injected into the reaction system up to 10 kPa. After that procedure, the reactor was illuminated with a diode laser (980 nm, 300 mW) on one side only. In this case, the laser beam was focused onto a grain of the UC K2YbF5:0.2 at% Tm3+ crystal put in the quartz tube.

Fig. 1 presents Tm3+ UC emissions from K2YbF5:Tm3+ under focused 980 nm laser irradiation. Intense blue emission at around 475 nm and two more emission bands in the UV spectral range from 290 to 360 nm are observed. According to well-known energy transfer UC mechanisms, 980 nm NIR photons are efficiently absorbed by Yb3+ ions and the absorbed energy is sequentially transferred to Tm3+ ions, which give rise to intense visible (mainly blue) and UV emissions. Therefore, NIR photons via the UC mechanisms (i.e. “up-converted” photons in the 290–360 nm range) can activate the TiO2 and SrTiO3 photocatalysts by generating electron–hole pairs to overcome the corresponding bandgaps.

In this context, we present evidence of UC-driven degradation of the organic dye (MB). The TiO2 UC-driven photocatalytic activity has been successfully proven with different degradation experiments using MB aqueous solutions. Firstly, the 10 ppm MB initial solution containing the TiO2 photocatalyst was stirred in the dark for 30 min, reaching a typical 15% reduction of the organic dye concentration due to the TiO2 adsorption effect, see curve (b) in Fig. 2. Secondly, after 1 hour of exposure to UV-blue radiation emitted by the UC crystal, excited under 980 nm laser irradiation and placed inside the cuvette containing the TiO2 (0.5 mg ml−1)–MB (10 ppm) aqueous solution, a MB degradation of approximately 32.2% was achieved. Increasing the exposure time under 980 nm laser radiation allows a contaminant degradation of about 53.7% in 2 hours to be reached. Next, we implemented an additional NIR laser beam exposure focused over the UC material in order to boost the luminescence intensity, which yields an MB degradation of up to 64.7% in 2 hours, see curve (c) in Fig. 2. It should be emphasized that similar experiments17–20 have been done using longer irradiation times, higher laser powers and/or light sources with a broader range of effective wavelengths (Xe or UV lamps). Moreover, in order to disregard any possible side effects of the laser irradiation (due to any unexpected activation of the TiO2 photocatalysts by NIR light, or due to other undesirable thermal effects caused by laser heating of the aqueous solution on the catalyst activation), control experiments have also been carried out. No photocatalytic MB degradation was observed when the same MB–TiO2 solution was exposed to 980 nm laser radiation but without the UC material being inside the quartz cuvette. These control experiments are crucial in order to discern, undoubtedly, the clear and sole role of the photonic up-conversion effect on the NIR-driven boosted photocatalytic reactions. For instance, the appearance of additional absorption bands in the VIS and NIR range, typically expected when RE ions are chemically incorporated into a photocatalysis composite, may also extend the spectral response of the catalysts, without the spectral conversion process. Therefore, here we have presented a purely photonic approach, converting the incident NIR radiation before it reaches an unmodified commercial photocatalyst.

(a) Starting solution; (b) after 2 h in the dark due to the adsorption effect of the TiO2 particles; (c) after 2 h under illumination with two 300 mW 980 nm laser diodes focused onto the up-conversion K2YbF5:Tm3+ crystals. The inset photo shows an UV-blue emitting UC crystal inside a quartz cuvette under NIR laser excitation. 
We have also studied UC-driven photocatalytic water-splitting for hydrogen generation in order to explore the potential of the UC process in solar energy harvesting. Fig. 3 shows the time course of gas evolution during UC-induced photocatalytic water-splitting on RhCrOx/STO:Al. As can be clearly seen, hydrogen and oxygen are evolved at the stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 under irradiation of one single 300 mW 980 nm laser over the 1 mm3 bulk UC crystal. The gas evolution occurred steadily for over 13 hours. The absorption edge wavelength of the STO:Al photocatalyst is approximately 390 nm (see Fig. 1). Upon absorption of light with wavelengths shorter than this, photoexcited electrons and holes are generated in STO:Al. These electrons and holes were used for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions from water, respectively. The UC material absorbing the 980 nm NIR laser light emits intense UV light and thereby enables the excitation of the STO:Al photocatalyst. Therefore, the STO:Al photocatalyst splits water into hydrogen and oxygen even under NIR irradiation. In a control experiment, where the UC materials were absent, no hydrogen/oxygen evolution was detected. Therefore, it is possible to rule out activation of the RhCrOx-loaded SrTiO3:Al photocatalysts by any other unexpected side effects of NIR laser irradiation.
 Fig. 3  Hydrogen and oxygen evolution via photocatalytic water-splitting, using SrTiO3:Al (1 mg ml−1) loaded with RhCrOx (Rh 0.1 wt%, Cr 0.1 wt%). The inset photograph shows a UV-blue emitting UC K2YbF5:Tm3+ crystal under focused NIR 980 nm laser diode irradiation implemented in the water-splitting experimental setup. 
At this point it is worth noting that the RhCrOx-loaded SrTiO3:Al photocatalyst is totally stable for several hours under the presented reaction conditions,21 as well as the up-conversion (UC) crystal, so the combination of both components is also stable. In fact, the up-conversion crystal placed inside a quartz tube does not enter into contact with either the pollutant solution or the catalyst suspension, and, therefore, can be totally recovered after each experiment without the observation of any depletion of the luminescence properties at all. This could lead to a remarkable reduction of the cost for potential photocatalytic applications.
In summary, highly intense UV-blue up-conversion emissions from K2YbF5:Tm3+ crystals have been implemented in photocatalysis experiments aimed at TiO2-driven organic pollutant degradation (Methylene Blue), and also at splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen with a RhCrOx/SrTiO3:Al composite catalyst, exclusively activated by UV light coming from the UC K2YbF5:Tm3+ material excited with NIR laser diodes, for the first time. Therefore, the NIR to UV-blue spectral conversion effect has been proven to bridge the gap and therefore to help solve the problem of energy mismatch between NIR excitation and the activation energy of commercial photocatalysts. Thus, the presented results provide a very significant contribution to the state-of-the-art for the growing trend of harvesting energy from the extensive NIR spectral range of the surface solar spectrum for promising applications in the renewable energy industry.23 In other words, the use of the additive effect of IR radiation in combination with highly efficient UC materials opens up new methods for photocatalytic wastewater treatment using cost-effective NIR laser diode arrays.
