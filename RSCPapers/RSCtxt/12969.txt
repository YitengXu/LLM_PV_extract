    , Accepted 2nd February 2015First published on 9th February 2015AbstractMesoporous TiO2 spheres (hereafter, MSs) were synthesized and incorporated into the photoanode of a quasi-solid state dye-sensitized solar cell (QSS-DSSC) containing an air stable ionic liquid electrolyte, namely 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) along with triethylmethylammonium methyl sulfate (TEMAMS) (65:35 = v/v), in order to improve its performance. The presence of large pores in the MS, as confirmed using a high resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM) and a mercury porosimeter, facilitates the penetration of QSS-electrolytes into the thin film, whereas their high surface area (108.1 m2 g−1) helps for high dye loading. Further, the large particle size increases the scattering ability of incident light leading to an excellent increment in the number of photons. The performance of DSSCs containing bi-ionic liquid (bi-IL) based electrolytes, namely, PMII/TEMAMS and PMII/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoborate (EMIBF4), with the addition of 0.2 M iodine, 0.4 M N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI), and 0.15 M guanidiniumthiocyanate (GuSCN), was compared, where the DSSC based on PMII/TEMAMS bi-ILs demonstrates superior efficiency (6.18%) than that of PMII/EMIBF4 based one (4.53%). The DSSC with PMII/TEMAMS shows extraordinary durability and unfailing stability for 1200 h even though it was stored in the dark at 50 °C. Further, the PMII/TEMAMS bi-IL electrolyte shows a gel-state at room temperature naturally without adding any gelators or polymers.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are fabricated using low cost materials and a simple fabrication process, and they exhibit reasonably high energy conversion efficiency. These advantages make them attractive candidates for research on next generation solar energy devices.1,2 Although the DSSC with the most commonly used organic solvents such as acetonitrile exhibits an outstanding efficiency of 13%,2 the problem of leakage during sealing and high volatility under long-term illumination poses a great challenge to its practical use.3,4 The focus of research on DSSCs has shifted recently from those based on liquid electrolytes to room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), owing to their chemical and thermal stability, negligible vapor pressure, non-flammability, high ionic conductivity and a wide electrochemical window.5,6 Owing to the superior electrochemical properties, imidazolium cation-based room temperature ILs have been proposed as the electrolytes for DSSCs. However, due to high viscosity, the imidazolium-based ILs obstruct the diffusion of the redox couple (I−/I3−) into the electrolyte, and thus restrict the performance of DSSCs. Fortunately, by adding a low-viscosity IL having an inert anion to the iodide-containing IL, the problem can be successfully alleviated. It has been reported that ILs with anions of tetracyanoborate (B(CN)4),7 dicyanamide (DCA),8 thiocyanate (SCN),9 and tricyanomethanide (C(CN)3)10 in combination with imidazolium-based cations seem to be promising for achieving the high performance of DSSCs. Until now, only a few reports have been available in the literature on the use of quaternary ammonium based ILs as the binary electrolytes for DSSCs.11–13 Nevertheless, overall efficiencies remain below 3.4%.
Further, compared with liquid electrolytes, RTILs still present lower energy conversion efficiency, because of their high viscosity characteristics, making them hardly permeate into the TiO2 film. In view of this, a TiO2 layer with a suitable pore size distribution becomes a key factor to determine the cell performance.14 Recently, sub-micrometer-sized TiO2 spheres with abundant mesopores have been employed in the DSSCs containing liquid electrolytes, where mesoporous TiO2 spheres (hereafter, MSs) are expected to enhance light scattering and the dye loading ability of the electrodes leading to an excellent enhancement in the photovoltaic characteristics of the DSSCs.15,16 Furthermore, the large pores present in the MS are expected to facilitate the penetration of the electrolyte. No studies are available in the literature utilizing this specific structure, synthesized without using a template, in the DSSCs containing RTILs as the electrolyte without adding any gelators or polymers.
Recently, Roh et al. proposed a copolymer-templated MS structure;17 however, the electrolyte used in this study was based on a quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte but not on a RTIL electrolyte. Further, calcination at 500 °C is needed to remove the remnant copolymer during the synthetic process of the mesoporous TiO2 structure. Xiang et al. demonstrated a series of mesoporous nitrogen-doped TiO2 spheres by tuning their nitrogen content;18 however, the increase of cell efficiency owed to the nitrogen doping effect but not the structure effect of mesopores for enhancing the mass transfer ability of the electrolyte in a TiO2 film. It should also be noticed that the electrolyte used in this study was not a RTIL. Very recently, Pan et al.,19 employed a targeted etching strategy to fabricate urchin-like mesoporous TiO2 hollow spheres with a large surface area of up to 128.6 m2 g−1, which show excellent light-harvesting properties and demonstrate superior performances in the photocatalytic removal of gaseous nitric oxide (NO) and photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion as photoanodes for DSSCs.
In this work, the TiO2 MS with high surface area (108.1 m2 g−1), good scattering ability, and large pores among MSs had been successfully synthesized and employed as the scattering layer, which is expected to facilitate the penetration of the RTILs through these large pores. Meanwhile, a new bi-ionic liquid (bi-IL) containing a mixture of 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) and triethylmethylammonium methyl sulfate (TEMAMS) (65:35 = v/v) is prepared, which possesses unique thermal plastic characteristics and shows the gel-state at room temperature. The chemical structure of TEMAMS is shown in Fig. 1. The photovoltaic characteristics of DSSCs containing the above bi-IL based electrolyte with different kinds of photoanodes are investigated. Moreover, a comparative evaluation on the photovoltaic characteristics of DSSCs with the above bi-IL based electrolyte with that of the common bi-IL based electrolyte containing PMII and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4) (65:35 = v/v) is also made.

Experimental
Preparation of hydrothermal mesoporous TiO2 spheres
Commercially available titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, 97%), propylamine (PA, 99%), sodium chloride (NaCl, 99%), and ethanol (EtOH, 99.5%) were used as received. Mesoporous spherical TiO2 structures with a diameter 500 ± 60 nm were synthesized by a one-step process of controlled hydrolysis and thermal reaction. Typically, precursor spheres were synthesized as follows: PA (6.7 mL) was dissolved in EtOH (450 mL), followed by the addition of 2 mL NaCl solution (0.075 M). To this solution, 7.5 mL TTIP was added under vigorous stirring at ambient temperature. The resulting white TiO2 suspension was kept static at the room temperature for 24 h, and the precursor samples were collected by centrifugation, followed by washing with ethanol several times. Finally, highly crystalline framework mesoporous TiO2 spheres were obtained by the hydrothermal treatment at 160 °C for 16 h.
Material characterization
High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained using a PhilipTecnai G2 LaB6 Gun TEM to determine the particle size and distribution of the nanosheets, having a Gatan Dual Vision CCD Camera, operating at 200 keV. The crystalline phase was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was estimated using a nitrogen sorption isotherm apparatus (Micromeritics, ASAP2010). The mercury porosimetry data were collected on a Micromeritics AutoPore IV 9520 apparatus. UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-4802, Unico, USA) was used to obtain absorption spectra of the dyes; for this, the dye was dissolved from the TiO2 film into 0.01 M NaOH and the solution was used for obtaining the spectra.
Preparation of the dye-adsorbed photoanode and DSSC assembly
Fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO, TEC-7, 7 Ω sq−1, NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA) conducting glasses were first cleaned with a neutral cleaner and then washed with deionic water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially. The conducting surface of the FTO was treated with a solution of TTIP in 2-methoxyethanol (1:3 = wt/wt) for obtaining a good mechanical contact between the conducting glass and the TiO2 film. Mesoscopic TiO2 films with a thickness of 15 μm were coated on the FTO glasses by the doctor blade technique, where the thickness of the resultant electrodes was controlled consistently.
Three kinds of composed films are presented: (1) 15 μm-thick TiO2 transparent layer (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP, Solaronix SA, Switzerland), (2) 10 μm-thick transparent TiO2 layer and 5 μm-thick commercial scattering layer (hereafter, CSL), in which the scattering layers are made up with 100 nm (PT-501A, Ya Chung industrial Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) and 13 nm diameter TiO2 nanoparticles (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP, Solaronix) with a weight ratio of 1:1, (3) 10 μm-thick transparent TiO2 layer and 5 μm-thick hydrothermal MS. 15 μm-thick mesoscopic TiO2 films were coated on the FTO glasses by a doctor blade technique. The thickness of TiO2 films was measured using a surface profilometer (Sloan Dektak 3030).
The TiO2 film was gradually heated to 500 °C (rate = 10 °C min−1) in an oxygen atmosphere, and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. After sintering at 500 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrode was immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye in acetonitrile (ACN) and tert-butyl alcohol (tBA) (1:1 = v/v), at room temperature for 24 h. The photoanode of a DSSC was thus obtained. The counter electrode (CE) was prepared by sputtering Pt on the FTO substrate. The thickness of the Pt film was found to be ca. 50 nm, as obtained from the corresponding plot of thickness vs. sputtering time. The above prepared TiO2 electrode was coupled with the CE; these two electrodes were separated by a 60 μm-thick Surlyn® (SX1170-60, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) and sealed by heating. The ionic liquid, triethylmethylammonium methyl sulphate (TEMAMS), had been synthesised, according to the literature.20 The bi-IL based electrolytes, composed of 0.2 M iodine, 0.4 M N-methylbenzimidazole (NMBI), 0.15 M guanidiniumthiocyanate (GuSCN) and the mixture of 1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (PMII)/synthesized TEMAMS or 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoborate (EMIBF4) (65:35 = v/v), are used as the electrolytes for the DSSCs. The electrolytes were injected into the gap between the electrodes by the capillary force.
Instrumentation and measurements
The surface of the DSSC was covered by a mask with a light-illuminated area of 0.16 cm2 and then illuminated using a class-A quality solar simulator (XES-301S, AM1.5 G, San-Ei Electric Co., Ltd.). The incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a reference solar cell and meter (Oriel Instrument, model 91105). Photocurrent density–voltage curves of the DSSCs were obtained with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, The Netherlands). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained using the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat, equipped with an FRA2 module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC, between the counter electrode and the FTO–TiO2-dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit condition; the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained at the short-circuit condition. The light source was a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5 G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.); light was focused through a monochromator (Oriel Instrument, model 74100) onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined below: IPCE(λ) = 1240(JSC/λφ)(1)where λ is the wavelength, JSC is the short-circuit photocurrent density (mA cm−2) recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat, and φ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2) measured with an optical detector (Oriel Instrument, model 71580) and a power meter (Oriel Instrument, model 70310).
Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows the surface morphologies of mesoporous TiO2 spheres (hereafter, MSs) prepared after the hydrothermal process. The sub-micrometer-sized MS with an average diameter of 500 ± 60 nm, as found by HR-SEM (Fig. 2a), increases the light scattering. Besides, the large pore among MSs promotes the penetration of the bi-ionic liquid (bi-IL) based electrolyte into the MS structure of a TiO2 film. Further, Fig. 2b clearly shows that the MS is composed of many tiny TiO2 nanoparticles (12 to 16 nm in diameter), which are porous in nature. Further confirmation is also obtained from the HR-TEM image (Fig. 2c), where the tiny nanoparticles are interconnected to each other favouring excellent electron transfer among the nanoparticles in the MS. Fig. 2d shows the single mesoporous structure, where the tunnels created by them help for the penetration of the electrolyte and dye molecule into the central parts of MSs, thereby enhancing the photoelectric conversion.

Fig. 3 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the MS and commercial scattering layer (hereafter, CSL), respectively. A loop with hysteresis can be observed for the MS under the relative pressure (P/P0) ranging from 0.6–0.9, indicating the presence of a well-defined mesoporous structure. On the other hand, the CSL does not have this property. Moreover, the pore size distribution (Fig. 3 inset) reveals the average pore size of about 15.1 nm. From the figure, it is noted that the surface area of the MS structure reaches a value of 108.1 m2 g−1, which is obviously higher than the value obtained for the CSL (14.9 m2 g−1). The above study shows that the small particle size in the hydrothermally-synthesized MS offers a high surface area for dye loading (Table 1). Besides this, the large pore size within the MS (257.5 ± 8.2 nm) is believed to be beneficial for the penetration of the electrolyte and dye molecule into the MS TiO2 film (Fig. 4). The diffraction peaks at 25.2° and 37.9°, corresponding to the planes (101) and (004), respectively can be clearly attributed to the anatase structures (JCPDS no. 21-1272), and are shown in Fig. 5. The crystallite size of the hydrothermal MS was estimated to be 14.1 nm based on the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) at 25.2° peak of the anatase phase according to the Scherrer equation and this value is comparable with the value determined by the SEM and TEM pictures.

It is well-known that the light-harvesting efficiency of dye molecules on a photoanode depends on the light-scattering ability of the semiconductor layer.21,22 The amount of diffusely scattered light, as a result of a beam of irradiation on the semiconductor film can be quantified by the reflectance spectra.
The reflectance spectra of the films corresponding to the commercial transparent layer (hereafter, CTL), CTL + CSL and CTL + MS, are shown in Fig. 6. When compared to the CTL of the TiO2 film, the films composed of both CTL + MS and CTL + CSL show stronger reflective capabilities in the visible and near-infrared regions (from 400 to 800 nm). These stronger reflective capabilities cause superior light utilization, compared with that of CTL film.23–26 Here we also measured the particle size distribution of the CSL paste. The result shows that the average particle size is located at 580 nm and this value is obviously larger than the value (∼100 nm) provided by the supplier for PT-501A powder, suggesting the aggregation of PT-501A particles after blended with 13 nm diameter of TiO2 nanoparticles (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP, Solaronix). From the SEM image (Fig. S1†), the CSL particles are found as aggregated and are consistent with the particle size distribution measurement. Hence, the particle sizes of the CSL are larger than those of MSs, resulting in strong light reflection for its film. The related data are shown in Fig. S2.† Besides, the film of the CTL shows an extremely low reflection (Fig. 6). Hence, the scattering layer dominates the reflectance of a TiO2 double layer, leading to the fact that the light reflection is stronger for CTL + CSL than CTL + MS in diffusion reflection spectra. In this study, an air stable bi-IL, namely 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII) along with triethylmethylammonium methyl sulfate (TEMAMS) (65:35 = v/v), was prepared and employed as an electrolyte for the DSSC. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs containing the PMII/TEMAMS based gel electrolyte with different film compositions are shown in Fig. 7 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, calculated by the average of 5 cells, are summarized in Table 2. It is worth mentioning here that the bi-IL shows a solid property at room temperature naturally without adding any gelators or polymers (see Fig. 7 inset) which prevents the electrolyte leakage from the cell. According to the dye loading measurement of different films, even though the dye absorbed amount on the CTL TiO2 film (1.46 × 10−7 mol cm−2) is higher than that of the CTL + CSL TiO2 film (0.97 × 10−7 mol cm−2), the JSC value of the CTL (11.97 mA cm−2) is only slightly higher than that of CTL + CSL (11.37 mA cm−2), owing to the weak reflective property of the CTL TiO2 film, where the utilization of photons will be low leading to decrease in the photoelectric conversion efficiency. On the other hand, addition of the scattering layer can successfully enhance the reflecting capacity of the TiO2 film, which increases the photoelectric conversion. In contrast, though the dye loading amount of the CTL (1.46 × 10−7 mol cm−2) is higher than that of CTL + MS (1.33 × 10−7 mol cm−2), the JSC value of the CTL is lower than that of the CTL + MS. This may be attributed to the higher surface area (108.1 m2 g−1) of the MS film than that of the CSL (14.9 m2 g−1), As a result of this, the scattering ability of the former is found to be better than the latter leading to a higher JSC and photo-to-current efficiency (η). It is noted that the larger surface area (108.1 m2 g−1) and the higher porosity (0.79) of the MS than those of the CTL (∼100 m2 g−1, 0.66) lead to the formation of large interstitial pores among TiO2 mesoporous spheres, and thus sacrifice the dye loading of the TiO2 film. Based on this, the dye loading of the CTL shows a relatively high value (1.46 × 10−7 mol cm−2) than that of the MS (1.26 × 10−7 mol cm−2) or CTL + MS (1.33 × 10−7 mol cm−2), which is consistent with the literature.27

The JIPCE value of the CTL (11.00 mA cm−2) is lower than that of the CTL + MS (12.55 mA cm−2). This is due to the weak reflective property of the CTL TiO2 film, in which the utilization of photons would be low leading to a decrease of IPCE. On the other hand, the addition of a scattering layer can successfully enhance the reflectance of the TiO2 film, which increases the IPCE value.
Even though the dye loading of the CTL + MS TiO2 film (1.33 × 10−7 mol cm−2) is lower than that of the CTL TiO2 film (1.46 × 10−7 mol cm−2), it still has a much higher dye loading as compared to the CTL + CSL TiO2 film (0.97 × 10−7 mol cm−2), and thus does not largely sacrifice its dye loading to enhance IPCE. This phenomenon is further confirmed by IPCE action spectra for different film compositions, where the IPCE value of CTL + MS is higher than that of CTL, over a wide range of wavelengths from 400 to 800 nm (Fig. 8), which is also in good agreement with the results of the diffuse reflectance spectra discussed above. Interestingly, the CTL + CSL also shows a higher IPCE value than that of the CTL in the longer wavelength region from 650 to 800 nm, where the N719 dye has low absorption for incident light. Hence, the high IPCE values of the CTL + CSL film could once again be attributed to its enhanced light scattering capacity.28–30 The JIPCE can be evaluated from the IPCE, where the corresponding values are listed in Table 1, using the following equation:31 JIPCE = ∫IPCE(λ)eϕAM1.5 G(λ)dλ(2)where parameter e is the elementary charge and ϕAM1.5 G is the photon flux at AM1.5 G (100 mW cm−2).

The photovoltaic characteristics of the DSSCs containing the bi-IL based electrolytes, PMII/TEMAMS and PMII/EMIBF4, were investigated by measuring the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the cells under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The results are shown in Fig. 9 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. From the figure and the table, it is clearly understandable that the JSC and the VOC values are larger for the cell with PMII/TEMAMS electrolytes (13.56 mA cm−2, 669 mV) when compared to those of PMII/EMIBF4 electrolytes (11.61 mA cm−2, 627 mV). Naturally, a higher cell efficiency is noted for PMII/TEMAMS (6.18%) than that of PMII/EMIBF4 (4.53%). It is important to mention that the optimized volume ratio of PMII to TEMAMS and PMII to EMIBF4 is the same (65:35 = v/v). The dark current of the TEMAMS based device is smaller than that of EMIBF4 based one and this suggests a low rate of recombination, resulting in an increase of VOC. We also measured the diffusivity, conductivity and I–V parameters for the individual ionic-liquid electrolytes and various compositions of the ionic-liquid electrolyte. The data were obtained based on the average of 5 cells, as shown in the ESI (ESI, pages S4–S9†).

Further, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the charge transfer kinetics of the DSSCs containing PMII/TEMAMS and PMII/EMIBF4 (cell gap: 60 μm). Fig. 10a shows the Nyquist plots of EIS of the DSSCs containing PMII/TEMAMS and PMII/EMIBF4 bi-ILs and the equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 10a. The Bode phase plots of EIS spectra, as shown in Fig. 10b, display the frequency peaks (f1max) of the charge transfer process in the TiO2 film. The characteristic frequency peaks of the DSSCs containing the bi-IL electrolytes PMII/TEMAMS and PMII/EMIBF4 were 51.1 Hz and 92.7 Hz, respectively. The electron lifetime for recombination (τn) can be expressed as:32,33 τn = (2πf1max)−1(3)

The values of τn for the DSSCs containing PMII/TEMAMS and PMII/EMIBF4 were estimated to be 3.11 ms and 1.72 ms, respectively (Table 3). The long electron lifetime indicates low electron recombination, leading to an increase in the electron transport through the TiO2 film and ends up with large VOC and high conversion efficiency (η). According to the fitting curves, parameters of the steady-state electron density on the TiO2 conduction band (ns) and diffusion coefficient of I3− in the electrolyte (D(I3−)) could be estimated from the following equations:34,35 ns = kBT/(q2ARkLke)(4) D(I3−) = (δ2f2max)/2.5(5)where parameter kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the charge of a proton, A is the working area of the photoanode, Rk is the charge-transfer resistance related to recombination of the electron, L is the film thickness, ke is the effective rate constant for recombination, δ is the thickness of the Surlyn® layer, and f2max is the peak frequency of the second arc in Nyquist plots.
The characteristic parameters of ns and D(I3−) are listed in Table 3. In general, the VOC of DSSCs is the difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of I−/I3−. A higher steady state electron density on the conduction band (ns) leads to a negative shift in the Fermi level of the TiO2 and thereby results in high VOC, and vice versa. In this work, the ns of the cell with PMII/TEMAMS (1.12 × 1018 cm−3) is found to be higher than that of the cell with PMII/EMIBF4 (0.68 × 1018 cm−3). The higher ns value of PMII/TEMAMS can be attributed to a good electron displacement of the electron Fermi level under illumination at the nanocrystalline TiO2/electrolyte interface, where it could inhibit the recombination, and thereby enhance the electron concentration in the TiO2 conduction band, leading to a higher VOC. Besides this, the diffusion coefficient of I3− in the electrolyte with PMII/TEMAMS shows a higher value of D(I3−) (1.73 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) when compared to that of the PMII/EMIBF4 based electrolyte (0.93 × 10−6 cm2 s−1), leading to higher conductivity and JSC for the former than the latter. The measured viscosity and conductivity of TEMAMS are 36.0 cp and 0.79 mS cm−1, respectively, whereas the viscosity and conductivity of EMIBF4 are 58.0 cp and 0.60 mS cm−1, respectively at 25 °C. It is important to note that viscosity and conductivity are dependent on the moisture content. If moisture increases, the viscosity decreases as well as the conductivity increases and vice versa. In general, the viscosity of TEMAMS is less than EMIBF4 leading to enhanced conductibility for the former than the latter, and this justifies the higher value of D(I3−) (1.73 × 10−6 cm2 s−1) for PMII/TEMAMS when compared to that of the PMII/EMIBF4 electrolyte (0.93 × 10−6 cm2 s−1). Besides, from the literature, it is understandable that this two-fold increase would still result in a high cell performance, and hence the experimental results are possibly not within the error of the impedance spectroscopic technique.36–40

Fig. 11 shows the at-rest durability data of the DSSCs containing PMII/TEMAMS. All the cells were sealed by the 60 μm-thick Surlyn® layer and UV glue, simultaneously. The cell efficiencies were measured once at different periods of time after being stored in the dark at 50 °C. As shown in Fig. 11, the DSSCs with PMII/TEMAMS show the extraordinary durability and unfailing stability for 1200 h.

Conclusions
In this study, we successfully synthesized the mesoporous TiO2 spheres (MSs) and employed them as the scattering layer for the photoanode in the DSSC containing the bi-ionic liquid (bi-IL) based electrolyte. By using a high resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM) and a mercury porosimeter, it is found that the sub-micrometer-sized MS with a diameter 500 ± 60 nm and the large pore between MSs (257.5 ± 8.2 nm) promote the penetration of the gel electrolyte into the MS structure of the TiO2 film. Further confirmation is also obtained from the HR-TEM image where the tiny nanoparticles are interconnected to each other favouring excellent electron transfer in the pores of the MS. Confirmed by N2 adsorption/desorption measurements, the MS structure has reached a high surface area, which helps for increasing the dye loading amount. Strong reflective capabilities of the films composed of the commercial transparent layer (CTL) + MS cause their superior light utilization, compared to that of the film based on the CTL. Based on these measurements, it has been demonstrated that DSSCs containing the photoanode made of a MS structure show a superior cell efficiency (6.18%) than that of the nanoparticle based (5.24%) and commercial scattering added TiO2 films (4.99%). The triethylmethylammonium methyl sulfate (TEMAMS) based gel electrolyte shows a solid property at room temperature which helps to prevent leakage. Further, DSSCs containing the TEMAMS based gel electrolyte demonstrate a superior cell efficiency (6.18%) than that of the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoborate (EMIBF4) based (4.53%), owing to their higher steady state electron density on the conduction band (ns) and larger diffusion coefficient of I3− (D(I3−)), as found out from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies. The DSSCs with 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII)/TEMAMS shows the extraordinary durability and unfailing stability of the cells for 1200 h.
