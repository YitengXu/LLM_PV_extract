    , Accepted 23rd July 2019First published on 24th July 2019AbstractThe structural information of a material in both the solid state and solution state is essential to the in-depth understanding of the properties of inorganic–organic hybrid materials. A one-dimensional (1D) lead bromide formulated as [H][NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3][H2O][PbBr5] (1) could be converted into a new two-dimensional (2D) complex, [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3][PbBr4] (2), by soaking the crystals in water. The isolated 2D compound showed single-layer lead-halide perovskite structures. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analyses of the reaction solution revealed that the [PbBr3]− fragments are initially formed from the rapid decomposition of the 1D [PbBr5]3− chains and subsequently reassemble into 2D [PbBr4]2− layers, which was verified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and microcalorimetry. Because of the decomposition and reassembly process, complex 1 could be used as a precursor to synthesize M2+-doped 2D lead bromide perovskites, namely, Mn@2, Ni@2 and Cd@2. In addition, preliminary tests indicated that complex 2 exhibited a lower optical band gap (3.25 eV) and higher electrical conductivity (3.2 × 10−11 S cm−1) than complex 1 (3.38 eV, 5.4 × 10−12 S cm−1).
Introduction
The family of hybrid halide perovskites covers a wide range of fascinating properties including both application-oriented and fundamental optoelectronic properties.1–10 However, due to stereochemical restrictions, the structures of three-dimensional (3D) perovskites are hampered by the limited options of organic cations.11 Besides the most extensively investigated 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites also show promising results for applications such as water-resistant light-harvesting and light-emitting diode (LEDs) materials.12–18 Different from the 3D analogues, the 2D perovskites feature a layered crystal structure, and the extra organic cation populating the interlayer space offers greater synthetic versatility and allows for more device types and phenomena to be explored.
The key to the design and synthesis of 2D perovskites is the choice of organic cations. In the past few years, many systematic studies have focused on the effect of organic cations on the crystal structure of iodometallates, resulting in the discovery of a wide variety of compounds adopting a wide array of structural configurations. Cations such as ammonium, amidinium, imidazolium and phosphonium have been employed in the synthesis of 2D perovskites. At the same time, the 2D perovskites also exhibit great photovoltaic and optical properties. For example, (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3I10 and (C6H5(CH2)2NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3I10 can be used as light absorbers in mesoscopic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 4.02% and 4.73%, respectively.13,19 Very recently, a series of 2D lead bromide or chloride perovskites such as (C6H13N3)PbBr4,20 (N-MEDA)PbBr4 (N-MEDA = N1-methylethane-1,2-diammonium),15 (EDBE)PbBr/Cl4 (EDBE = 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylammonium),14 (C6H11NH3)2PbBr4,18 α-(DMEN)PbBr4 (DMEN = 2-(dimethylamino)ethylammonium), (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbCl418 and (AEA)PbBr4 (AEA = 3-(2-ammonioethyl)anilinium) were used as tunable white-light-emitting materials.17 Along with the increasingly intensive research in applications and structures, the requirement of understanding the complex formation mechanisms and self-assembly processes has become urgent.
In the area of hybrid halide perovskite compounds, although solid-state investigations have been carried out, there has been very little research on the self-assembly processes, which govern the formation of these structures in solution. Recently, ESI-MS was used to study such formation processes in polyoxometalates (POMs),21,22 supramolecular cages,22–26 high-nuclear coordinative molecules, etc.27,28 Similar to POMs, the inorganic component of hybrid halide perovskites is constructed by transferable building blocks, and these compounds are soluble in polar solvents.29 However, the use of ESI-MS to aid the elucidation of the assembly processes involved is seldom investigated. Thus, there is a clear and urgent need to develop approaches to bridge the gap between solid-state and solution so that the key features of the self-assembly mechanisms and new control strategies of the hybrid halide perovskites can be revealed.
In this work, a 2D cystamine lead bromide complex, [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3][PbBr4] (2), was synthesized by soaking a 1D complex, [H][NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3][H2O][PbBr5] (1), in water (Fig. 1, Fig. S1–S4, Tables S1 and S2†). The ESI-MS results revealed that the [PbBr3]− fragments are initially formed from the rapid decomposition of the 1D [PbBr5]3− chains and self-assemble to a 2D [PbBr4]2− layer, which was verified by PXRD and microcalorimetry. More significantly, it is the first time that a 1D complex is treated as a precursor to synthesize M2+-doped 2D lead bromide perovskites, which provides a new idea for the synthesis of metal-doped halide perovskite materials.

Experimental
Reagents
Unless otherwise stated, all of the chemicals were purchased from Aladdin. The purity of the reagents is listed below:
Lead bromide (AR, 99%); cystamine dihydrobromide (>97%); hydrobromic acid, 48 wt% in H2O, 99.99% metal basis; acetonitrile, ≥99.9% (GC); MnBr2 (99%), NiBr2 (99%, anhydrous), CdBr2·4H2O (98%).
Synthetic procedures

Synthesis of [H][NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3][H2O][PbBr5] 1. 
PbBr2 (146.8 mg, 0.4 mmol), H2N(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH2·2HBr (125.6 mg, 0.4 mmol), concentrated HBr (1 mL) and acetonitrile (4 mL) were sealed in a 23 ml Teflon autoclave and then heated at 80 °C for 2 hours. The autoclave was then cooled at a rate of 10 °C h−1; the yellow crystals formed were collected, washed with MeCN, and dried in vacuum for 10 minutes to yield 1 (yield: ca. 76% based on Pb).


Synthesis of [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3][PbBr4] 2. 
The crystals of complex 1 (200 mg) were soaked in 50 mL water for 2 hours; then, white crystals of 2 were formed (yield: ca. 59% based on complex 1).


Synthesis of metal-doped samples Mn@2, Ni@2 and Cd@2. 
Three 200 mg powder samples of complex 1 were immersed in 50 mL 1 M MnBr2, NiBr2 and CdBr2 aqueous solutions for 2 hours; the metal-doped samples Mn@2, Ni@2 and Cd@2 were obtained (the yields of Mn@2, Ni@2 and Cd@2 are consistent with that of compound 2).

X-ray crystallography
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data collection for 1 and 2 was conducted on Rigaku Oxford Diffraction (Mo, λ = 0.71073 Å) using the θ–ω scan technique at 100(2) K. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined with a full-matrix least-squares technique within the Olex 2 program package.30 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were set in calculated positions and refined using the riding model. The crystallographic details are provided in Table S1.† Selected bond distances and bond angles are listed in Table S2.† Crystallographic data for the structural analyses have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center. CCDC reference numbers are 1811892 for 1 and 1811893 for 2.†
Conductivity measurements
The preparation process of the pellets of 1 and 2 is as follows: first, we weighed 100 mg 1 and 2 and ground the samples for 4 hours to make them as smashed as possible. Then, certain amounts of powder samples were pressed into pellets (0.8 cm in diameter, 1.13 mm in thickness for 1 and 1.19 mm for 2). The pellets were compacted again by isostatic pressing. Finally, a layer of gold film was deposited on both sides of the pellets for conductivity testing.
The pellets of 1 and 2 were connected to a Keithley 6485 source meter by silver-coated copper wires. Current–voltage (I–V) curves were scanned at various voltage ranges according to the resistance of the samples and the sensitivity of the instrument. The conductivity was calculated by the plots of current density versus electric field strength (J–E curves) based on the following Ohm's law:σ = J/E, J = I/S, E = V/L.
Here, σ is the conductivity, J is the current density, E is the electric field strength, I is the current, V is the voltage, S is the cross-sectional area of the single crystal, and L is the thickness of the pellets.
ESI-MS
The mass spectrometer used for the measurements was an AB Sciex (4600), and the data were collected in positive-ion modes. The spectrometer was calibrated with the standard tune mix to give a precision of ca. 2 ppm in the region of m/z 100–1000. The samples were prepared as follows: three copies of 1 mg complex 1 were immersed in 10 mL water for 40, 80 and 120 seconds and then, 20 μL of the reaction solution was taken from the three reaction liquids and diluted with 5 mL MeOH/H2O (volume ratio 1:1) for ESI-MS at 275 °C.
Measurement details
The reagents and solvents employed were commercially available and used as received without further purification. SEM and EDS were carried out with Hitachi SU8010. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) intensities were measured at 293 K on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu-Kα, λ = 1.54056 Å). The crystalline powder samples were prepared by crushing the single crystals and scanned from 3 to 40° at a rate of 5° min−1. Calculated patterns of 1 were generated by Diamond.
Results and discussion
Structure conversion triggered by solvent
[H][NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3][H2O][PbBr5] (1) was a heterogeneous isomorphous form of the reported complex [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3][H3O][PbI5], which could be applied as a reversible second harmonic generation (SHG) switchable material (Fig. 1a).31 When HI was replaced by HBr during synthesis, white crystals of 1 were prepared with about 76% yield (based on Pb). The asymmetric unit of 1 consisted of a 1D [PbBr5]3− anion with one crystallographically independent Pb atom and one [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3]2+ cation (Fig. S1 and S2†). Complex 1 crystallized in the monoclinic P21 chiral space group. The chirality of the complexes stemmed from the [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3]2+ cation, which had a screw-like structure with chiral P- or M-helical conformations. The [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3]2+ cations in 1 all adopted the same M conformation (Fig. 2a). This indicated that the change of halogen ions cannot induce the chirality change of organic ligands; thus, the strategy of replacing halogens has no effect on the structural transformation of the 1D [PbBr5]3− configuration.
 Fig. 2  The configuration of the cystamine cations in 1 (a) and 2 (b). 
Therefore, the key to reconstructing the structure into higher dimensions is to find ways to change the configuration of the cystamine cations. First, we extended the reaction time and/or increased the reaction temperatures (i.e., 100, 120 and 140 °C), but the products did not change. This is mainly because of the short H⋯Br distances [2.444(1)–2.779(1) Å] in 1, which indicate strong N–H⋯Br hydrogen bonds and high phase stability (Table 1). Therefore, it is important to find ways to destroy the original hydrogen bonds. For this purpose, we tried to soak the crystals in stronger polar solvents, such as methanol and water. As expected, when we put 1 into water, the crystals dissolved rapidly and then recrystallized immediately to form another reported colorless complex, [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3][PbBr4] (2).32,33 Single-crystal X-ray analysis indicated that 2 crystallized in the non-polar monoclinic space group C2/c. Its structure featured a 2D anionic [PbBr4]2− layer (Fig. S3 and S4†), which was charge balanced by the [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3]2+ cation (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 2b, the [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3]2+ cations have two configurations, namely, M and P, leading to the disappearance of chirality. The [NH3(CH2)2SS(CH2)2NH3]2+ cations interacted with the Br atoms of the [PbBr4]2− layer through a series of new N–H⋯Br hydrogen bonds (Table 1) and the closest distance between the [PbBr4]2− layers was 5.778(4) Å [Br(4)⋯Br(4a)] (Fig. 1b). Although the structure of complex 2 was very similar to those of some reported lead halide inorganic–organic hybrids with diammonium cations,34–37 using 1D precursors to synthesize 2D compounds is still very rare. In addition, the structures of cystamine lead-halides were closely related to the reaction conditions. In contrast, 2 was still the only product when the reaction conditions changed (the amount of solvent and reaction temperature). Therefore, we hoped to explore the transformation process from 1D to 2D and then find a method to improve the properties of the compounds.

Compounds 1 and 2 were stable in air. The optical spectra of the powder samples of 1 and 2 were measured in the diffuse reflection mode using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Fig. S5†).38 The as-recorded reflectance values were transformed with the Kubelka–Munk function to give spectral intensity proportional to the absorbance. The band gaps of 1 and 2 were determined as 3.38 eV and 3.25 eV, respectively, which were consistent with their colors (Fig. S6†).
The conversion process from 1 to 2
The conversion process from 1 to 2 was followed by powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. 3). The PXRD data showed that complex 1 completely transformed into 2 in less than 5 minutes. It is important to note that 2 was not destroyed even when it was immersed in water for 6 hours. Although 2 eventually decomposed after 12 hours of immersion, it was stable for more than 6 months in air. For the first time, we found that water could be used to destroy the hydrogen bonds in 1 and act as a reaction medium to change the configuration of organic cations and control the formation of new complexes.
 Fig. 3  PXRD pattern tracing of the conversion from 1 to 2 with the change in soaking time. 
Because of the fast reaction rate, we could not track the transition process from solid samples. Thus, we used ESI-MS to try to investigate the construction process in the reaction solution (Fig. 4 and Table S3†). After 40 seconds of reaction, three prominent peaks were observed at m/z 708.7 ([H2L(PbBr3)(H2O)6]+), 660.7 ([H2L(PbBr3)(MeOH)2]+) and 600.8 ([H2L(PbBr3)]+), suggesting that the 1D [PbBr5]3− chain breaks into small fragments and [PbBr3]− is the basic building unit for the construction of the 2D layer. The coordination environment of Pb in [PbBr3]− is not saturated, but the intermediates with this configuration can be further linked with other intermediates in three directions, which is beneficial to the formation of high-dimensional compounds (Fig. S7†). Due to the decomposition of one-dimensional chain compounds, a series of peaks related to organic amines appeared (Fig. S8†) such as [HL]+ (m/z 153.1), [(H2L)Br(H2O)5]+ (m/z 290.8), [(HL)(L)(H2O)5]+ (m/z 398.2), [(HL)(L)(MeOH)2(H2O)6]+ (m/z 479.0) and [(HL)(L)(CH3OH)2(H2O)7]+ (m/z 497.0). It is worth noting that the three fragments [H2L(PbBr3)(H2O)6]+], [H2L(PbBr3)(MeOH)2]+ and [H2L(PbBr3)]+ were constructed by the [PbBr3]− anion and protonated cystamine cation, which showed the strong interaction between them. This strong interaction prevented further hydrolysis of [PbBr3]−, due to which it reassembled into a new structure. Moreover, the appearance of [H2L(PbBr3)(H2O)6]+ and [H2L(PbBr3)(MeOH)6]+ showed that the [H2L(PbBr3)]+ anion has good binding ability with polar solvents (H2O and MeOH). When the reaction time reached 80 seconds, the intensity of the related peaks for [PbBr3]− decreased obviously, indicating that the formation of 2 consumed the [PbBr3]− building unit. After 120 seconds, the reaction reached equilibrium and the intensity of the related peaks for [PbBr3]− did not change.

Interestingly, when 1 was added to the aqueous solutions of 1 M MnBr2, NiBr2 and CdBr2, three new peaks were observed at m/z 449.8 ([H2L(MnBr3)]+), 450.8 ([H2L(NiBr3)]+) and 508.8 ([H2L(CdBr3)]+) (Fig. 5), respectively. The emergence of these peaks indicated that the Pb2+ ions in the [PbBr3]− series could be partially substituted by some transition metal ions. If these species can eventually participate in the reassembly of the 2D layer, this will be a new strategy for building M2+-doped lead bromide perovskite materials.

We further explored the change in heat in this reaction by microcalorimetry in a C80 micro calorimeter. As shown in Fig. 6, complex 1 reacts rapidly with water, giving off heat and reaching its peak at about 1.2 min at 25 °C. The heat change during the conversion process was −4.53 kJ mol−1, indicating a spontaneous exothermic reaction.39

Since 1 decomposed into small fragments and then reassembled into 2 during the hydrolysis procedure, it also afforded opportunities for constructing M2+-doped lead bromide perovskite materials via introducing metal cations into aqueous solutions. Fortunately, by soaking complex 1 into 1 M aqueous solutions of MnBr2, NiBr2 and CdBr2 for 1 hour, we obtained a series of M2+-doped samples, whose crystallinity was confirmed by PXRD analysis (Fig. 7). The PXRD patterns of Mn@2, Ni@2 and Cd@2 coincided with the calculated PXRD pattern of 2, indicating that the topology was retained. The color of Mn@2 and Cd@2 showed no obvious change compared with that of 2, while Ni@2 was a light green powder. The band gaps of Mn@2, Ni@2 and Cd@2 were 3.22, 3.19 and 3.25 eV, which were close to that of 2 (Fig. S6†). It is worth noting that the M2+-doped compound 2 could not be synthesized by using the method in ref. 32.
 Fig. 7  PXRD patterns of Mn@2, Ni@2, Cd@2 and the simulated data of 2. 
To investigate the distribution and the amounts of metals in the M2+-doped materials, SEM and EDS analyses were carried out on the Mn@2, Ni@2 and Cd@2 samples (Fig. 8). The EDS mapping of the Mn and Pb elements in a sample of Mn@2 showed that both Mn and Pb metals spread out within the area of the crystalline particles. The SEM image and EDS mapping of the crystals of Ni@2 and Cd@2 also showed the presence of Ni and Cd metal ions, indicating that the samples are not physical mixtures. The amounts of metals in the M2+-doped materials were analyzed by ICP-OES. The results showed that the contents of Mn, Ni and Cd were about 2.57%, 2.31% and 1.20%, respectively, of the total metal content. The low contents were mainly due to the rapid formation rate of 2.

Optical properties of 2 and Mn@2
The control of the optical properties of 2 by metal doping was indeed observed by obtaining photoluminescence (PL) measurements.40,41 The steady-state PL measurement of 2 showed a strong blue emission peak at 470 nm when excited at 365 nm (Fig. 9, purple line). The PL spectra of the Mn@2 sample also showed a strong emission band at 470 nm. Interestingly, a weak and broad emission peak, centered at ∼650 nm, was observed in the PL spectra (Fig. 9, red line). This peak was attributed to the Mn2+ d–d emission, corresponding to the forbidden 4T1 → 6A1 internal transition.34,35

The 2D layered lead bromide-based perovskites are excellent candidates as active materials for LED applications. Very recently, some researchers have reported providing an additional level of control on the optoelectronic properties of these perovskite materials by deliberately introducing impurity ions (especially transition metal ions) in the form of dopants.42–48 To date, only one lead bromide-based perovskite, (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4, has been successfully doped with Mn2+ into the structure.49 Herein, we reported new simple and scalable synthesis of M2+-doped 2D layered lead bromide perovskites through a 1D precursor for the first time, plausibly providing an insight into the synthesis of metal-doped halide perovskite materials.
Conductivity and photoelectricity of complexes 1 and 2
Electrical conductivities reflect the carrier concentration and mobility of semiconductors and have been observed to be dependent on the dimensionality of the inorganic components in organic–inorganic lead iodides.38 The charge transport was measured to determine how this charge trapping influenced the photoconductivity in the 2D compounds and to evaluate these materials as solar cell or detector materials. The electrical conductivities of 1 and 2 were measured using a two-probe direct current (DC) method with pressed pellets of the powdered samples at 297 K (Fig. 10a). The conductivities of the pellets of 1 and 2 were 5.4 × 10−12 and 3.2 × 10−11 S cm−1 at 297 K, respectively. While these conductivities are relatively high for solar cell materials, they fall in the desired range for hard radiation detector materials. The photoconductivity of 2 was measured using a single crystal sample (Fig. 10b). Under the photo-excitation of a 400 W mercury lamp (the wavelength is 365 nm), the enhanced currents proved the light-response of 2. At a voltage of 10 V, complex 2 responded with a photocurrent (0.27 nA) that was 2.9× higher than the dark current (0.09 nA).

Conclusions
In summary, by using a strong polar solvent to destroy the original hydrogen bond and change the configuration of the organic cation, we succeeded in converting a 1D [PbBr5]3− chain into a 2D [PbBr4]2− layer. This is the first example of the study of the dimensional transition process of hybrid lead bromides using time-dependent ESI-MS. Moreover, the 1D complex was the first precursor for introducing some transition metal ions, i.e., Mn2+, Ni2+ and Cd2+ into the 2D perovskite layer. Such an approach can broaden ways for achieving new hybrid halogenoplumbates with a tailored lattice architecture and bring the introduction of new properties for semiconducting materials.
