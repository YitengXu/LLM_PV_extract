    , Accepted 18th April 2016First published on 18th April 2016AbstractPt-based direct methanol fuel cells are attracting increasing interest as environmentally friendly alternative energy sources. However, the high price of Pt and the difficulty to prepare favourable morphologies for catalysis (e.g., mesoporous materials) are hampering their development into feasible products. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to efficiently grow mesoporous films of Pt-poor alloys (Co3Pt and CoPt3), based on electrodeposition in ionic liquid-in-water (IL/W) microemulsions. The high proportion of the electrolytic aqueous solution in the IL/W microemulsion favors a significant deposition rate, while the presence of IL drops induces the formation of highly mesoporous films. The mesoporous alloys, with pores in the 8–11 nm range, exhibit excellent durability in acidic and alkaline aggressive media, maintaining their peculiar morphology. The structures are very efficient for the catalysis of methanol electro-oxidation in alkaline media, with minimal poisoning of the catalysts. These results pave the way to develop simple, versatile environmentally friendly fuel cell catalysts to commercialize new viable ecological alternative energy sources.
Introduction
The threat of global warming is generating a growing social and scientific interest in alternative ecological energy sources to reduce the use of contaminating fossil fuels.1,2 In this context, fuel cells have recently received tremendous attention as a future energy technology, since they can convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy using environmentally friendly processes with high energy conversion efficiencies.3–6 In particular, Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) are especially appealing due to their outstanding advantages, such as high power density, environmental friendliness, simplicity, ease of recharging, and low operating temperatures.7–9 However, the high cost and the short lifespan of Pt, which has been recognized as the best catalyst toward methanol oxidation, present a major technical challenge, slowing down the progress of fuel cell commercialization.10–12 Therefore, it is essential to explore new efficient Pt-free or Pt-poor catalysts with enhanced activity, stability and durability (especially in basic media, since both methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions are faster in alkaline media than in the presence of acidic electrolytes).13–15 To reduce or replace Pt, a wide range of active and inexpensive non-precious catalysts, including transition metals,16,17 transition metal chalcogenides,18,19 metal oxides,20–22 nitrogen-coordinated complexes, and conductive polymers,23 among others, are being actively investigated. Another appealing strategy to effectively enhance the activity and to reduce the costs is the incorporation of other metals into platinum nanostructures (e.g., AuPt and PdPt).24,25 In particular, Co–Pt structures have been introduced as a possible future electrocatalyst due to their excellent performance and the low cost of Co compared to that of Pt, Au or Pd, although the composition of the alloy is critical in determining the durability of Co–Pt nanostructures when they are used as electrocatalysts for DMFCs in acidic media.9,26 However, one of the most promising schemes to boost the performance of electrocatalysts and to reduce the load of Pt in devices is combining the above approaches with the use of a porous morphology (especially mesoporous) with a high surface area.27,28
The development of mesoporous materials has attracted great interest in the past few years due to their unique properties which have led to multiple applications in very diverse fields (e.g., catalysis, sensors, solar cells, adsorbents or drug delivery).29–33 The traditional approaches for synthesizing mesoporous structures are based on surfactant/block copolymer soft-templating, hard-templating or colloidal crystal templating.34–37 Recently, soft-template systems have also been used as electrochemical media for preparing mesoporous structures by means of electrodeposition. Interestingly, different electrochemical media have been proposed for this purpose (although each of them presents some shortcomings): (i) ionic liquids, which are overly viscous for preparing nanomaterials,35,36,38 (ii) surfactant micelles, although this method only allows the preparation of a limited number of metals39–42 and (iii) water-in-ionic liquid (W/IL) microemulsions, which usually implies low efficiencies and extremely long deposition times.43,44 Therefore, given the drawbacks and limitations of the current approaches to synthesize mesoporous structures by electrodeposition, exploring new electrochemical media and conditions is crucial to develop versatile, simple and inexpensive fuel cells to develop viable, environmentally friendly, alternative energy sources.
Here, we present two new electrochemical media to synthesize mesoporous structures of different metals and alloys in an efficient, easy and fast manner by electrodeposition: surfactant micelles and ionic liquid-in-water (IL/W) microemulsions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by synthesizing highly mesoporous films of different Co–Pt alloys onto Si/Ti (15 nm)/Au (100 nm) substrates. Moreover, the analysis of their electrocatalytic activity for methanol electro-oxidation in alkaline media shows not only that these mesoporous Co–Pt alloys are very effective towards this reaction, but they also exhibit a very good stability, in both acidic and alkaline media, and durability. Finally, the magnetic character of the films allows them to be easily manipulated by magnetic fields once they are detached from the substrate.

Electrodeposition
The electrochemical fabrication of Pt-based structures (compact, nanopowdered and mesoporous films of Pt, Pt3Co and Co3Pt) was performed by using a microcomputer-controlled potentiostat/galvanostat Autolab (with PGSTAT30 equipment and GPES software) at 25 °C with a standard three-electrode cell system. Si/Ti (15 nm)/Au (100 nm) substrates, Pt spiral, and Ag/AgCl/1 M KCl were used as working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. To obtain the three different morphologies (compact, nanopowdered and mesoporous) diverse electrodeposition media were used: (i) aqueous (W) and (ii) micellar solutions (M) and (iii) ionic liquid-in-water (IL/W) microemulsions (Table 1).

The micellar solutions were prepared by stirring the corresponding aqueous solution for each composition with a non-ionic surfactant (Brij 58) in a 99/1% ratio (Table 1).39–42
The IL/W microemulsions were prepared by mixing the adequate aqueous solution with a non-ionic surfactant (Triton X-100) and an ionic liquid (IL, – bmimPF6) in an 83.8/15.1/1.1% ratio (Table 1).45–49
Notably, in comparison with the traditional hard-templating pathways, which are tedious due to multiple step synthesis and they require the use of hazardous chemicals to remove the template, or other chemical synthesis methods based on the use of aggressive chemical reducing agents, the proposed growth methods are free from harmful materials. Hence, they can be considered as greener than many previous approaches. Moreover, apart from its simplicity, the synthesis of mesoporous structures by electrochemical means based on micellar solutions (M) and ionic liquid-in-water (IL/W) microemulsions is easily scalable to produce large batches of advanced metallic nanostructures.
The electrodeposition media were deaerated before each experiment by argon bubbling. The deposition of Pt, CoPt3 and Co3Pt was carried out at fixed potentials of −0.2, −1.0 and −1.1 V, respectively. Note that the electrodeposition was performed without stirring to maintain the structure of each media during the process.
In order to remove any traces of ionic liquid, after the deposition, the samples were cleaned in methanol and 0.1 M of NaOH solution. Afterwards, they were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and finally dried carefully using nitrogen gas.
Materials characterization
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi H-4100FE, 20 kV) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to analyze the morphology and the elemental composition of the samples. The morphology of mesoporous films was also examined by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Jeol 2100). A 3D Optical surface metrology system (Leica DCM 3D) was used to determine the thickness. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a PANalytical X'Pert-PRO MRD diffractometer with parallel optical geometry in grazing incidence configuration (1°) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). A 2θ scan, between 10 and 100° was used, with a step size of 0.05 and a measuring time of 15 s per step. The XRD diffraction patterns were analyzed using FullProf.50 Room temperature hysteresis loops were measured using a superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS-XL). XPS spectra of mesoporous films before and after the cleaning procedure were registered using a Phoibos 150 analyser (SPECS GmbH) under ultra-high vacuum conditions (base pressure 3 × 10−3 mbar) with a monochromatic aluminium Kalpha X-ray source (1486.74 eV).
Electrocatalytic measurements
The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the Pt-based structures was estimated by integrating (taking into account the double layer correction) the charge corresponding to the hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles in 0.5 M of H2SO4 solutions, at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The ECSA is often reported in terms of its specific surface area (m2 g−1). However, for films, it is usually given in terms of its roughness factor (RF), which was calculated by dividing the obtained ECSA value by the electrode geometrical area.51 The short-term stability was evaluated by the accelerated durability test (ADT),52 which consists of recording at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in 1 M of NaOH solution (working media as a catalyst) for 10000 cycles, and then recording at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in 0.5 M of H2SO4 solution until CV profile stabilization. The electrocatalytic activity was investigated using a three-electrode electrochemical cell by CV measurements, which were performed at 50 mV s−1 in 1 M of NaOH + 1 M of CH3OH solutions. The chronoamperometric tests were conducted under the potential of −0.2 V.
Results and discussion
Electrochemical synthesis and characterization
Co-rich (Co3Pt) and Pt-rich (CoPt3) films have been electrodeposited onto Si/Ti (15 nm)/Au (100 nm) substrates using three different electrodeposition media: aqueous solutions (W), micellar solutions (M) or ionic liquid-in-water (IL/W) microemulsions (see Table 1). The chronoamperograms (Fig. 1S in the ESI†), under non-stirring conditions for both aqueous and micellar solutions displayed a rapid decay of the initial current, as a consequence of the depletion of the electroactive species near the electrode. However, the posterior gradual moderate increase in current may indicate a slow increase in the active area if, for example, an increase in roughness takes place. The chronoamperograms of IL/W microemulsions showed lower initial current than the previous cases, the posterior decay and a quasi-stationary final current, probably conditioned by the slow transport of electro-active species in the electrodeposition media. In fact, the chronoamperometric curves show that different times are necessary to attain the same deposition charge densities (1.6 C cm−2), i.e., the same amount of material: W – 275 s (Co3Pt)/279 s (CoPt3); M – 261 s (Co3Pt)/269 s (CoPt3) and IL/W – 870 s (Co3Pt)/977 s (CoPt3), respectively. This is expected since the microemulsions used present higher viscosity and lower conductivity than the aqueous or micellar solutions, leading to a lower deposition rate. However, although for the IL/W microemulsion medium it takes somewhat longer to reach the same charge density, the differences between the diverse media are not substantial, as supported by the similar electrodeposition efficiencies (Table 2), where the electrodeposition efficiencies are determined by the concentration of Co(II) and Pt(IV) in the aqueous component (at the same deposition potential). Note that reference compact and mesoporous Pt films (chronoamperometric curves in Fig. 2Sa†) exhibit larger efficiencies (Table 2) since in this case hydrogen evolution is significantly lower at −0.2 V.

From the X-ray diffraction analysis, it can be seen that the different samples grow in a disordered fcc structure (space group Fm3m), although with slightly different microstructural parameters (i.e., lattice parameter, crystallite size and texture – see ESI and Table 1S†). Moreover, the EDX inspection, using a FE-SEM, shows that the overall composition of the films remains constant independent of the electrodeposition media: CoPt3 – Co25±1Pt75±1 and Co3Pt – Co75±2Pt25±2 (Table 2). Remarkably, the FE-SEM images show that the electrodeposition media has a dramatic effect on the morphology of the deposited Co–Pt alloys:
(i) Compact films (Fig. 1a and b) were formed when aqueous solutions (W) were used as electrodeposition medium. However, the surface morphology of the Co–Pt deposits was different depending on the stoichiometry of the alloy. The Co3Pt one exhibited a distorted acicular morphology, whereas the CoPt3 one showed a nodular grained morphology.
 Fig. 1  FE-SEM micrographs of Co–Pt structures prepared on Si/Ti (15 nm)/Au (100 nm) substrates using aqueous solutions (a and b), micellar solutions (c and d) or IL/W microemulsions (e and f). Scale bar: 50 nm. 
(ii) Loosely interconnected nanopowdered deposits (Fig. 1c and d) were obtained in micellar solutions (M), with an average grain size of around 35 ± 12 nm, for the two Co–Pt stoichiometries.
(iii) Mesoporous films (Fig. 1e and f) were obtained when IL/W microemulsions were used. They are composed of connected structures (Fig. 3S and 4S†), forming sponge-like structures with high apparent surface areas.
TEM analysis of the mesoporous samples confirms the formation of interconnected pore networks with easy accessibility, with an average pore size of around 11 ± 3 nm and 8 ± 4 nm for Co3Pt and CoPt3, respectively (Fig. 2).
Notably, the absence of F, N and P peaks (specific to the ionic liquid – C8H15F6N2P) in the XPS spectrum (Fig. 5S†) confirms the absence of any ionic liquid traces (viscous component) in the electrodeposited mesoporous films, after the cleaning treatment. Moreover, the analysis of the mesoporous films by means of EDX did not detect any traces of ionic liquid (F, N and P). Note that the cleanness of the samples is critical to make the pores accessible and thus for the reproducibility of the results.

To confirm the porosity of the films prepared from IL/W microemulsions, the roughness factor (RF) of the different films was evaluated from the CV profiles (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Remarkably, the RF values of the mesoporous films show a more than 15-fold increase with respect to the one of the compact films. Moreover, the RF values of the mesoporous films were not only appreciably higher than those of the nanopowder, but more than 30% larger than the RF of the reference Pt mesoporous films. Thus, the high RF values corroborate the high porosity of the films prepared from IL/W microemulsions observed by SEM. Moreover, the RF values of the mesoporous films (with RF > 50) are higher than the previously reported values of other catalysts, such as 2–14 for Pt-transition metal alloys,26 45 for mesoporous PtCu films43 and 3.9 for Pd films.44
 Fig. 3  Test of the durability of the electrodeposited (compact (A), nanopowdered (B) and mesoporous (C)) Co3Pt and CoPt3 films: (a and b) cyclic voltammetry at 20 mV s−1 in H2SO4 0.5 M and 25 °C (the line corresponds to the 1st cycle, while the shaded area corresponds to the 10000th cycle); (c and d) relative change of the ECSA values with respect to the initial value and (e and f) Co at% of the films as a function of the number of voltammetric cycles (0, 300, 900, 2250, 4500, 6500 and 10000 cycles). The lines in (c)–(f) are guides to the eye. 
Additionally, the durability of the films in basic media is also outstanding. As can be seen in Fig. 3 and Table 2, the ECSA values of each deposit exhibited only a slight decrease after the circulating treatment in an alkaline bath, even in the nanopowder and mesoporous structures. Remarkably, in terms of durability, the ECSA values of the compact and mesoporous Co–Pt alloys were comparable with those of the reference Pt deposits (Fig. 2Sb and ESI†) with equivalent morphologies. Additionally, the durability of the mesoporous structures is further confirmed by FE-SEM after 300 (Fig. 7S†) and 10000 cycles (Fig. 8S†). Namely, there is no apparent modification of the morphology even after 10000 cycles. On the other hand, the nanopowdered and compact samples seem to exhibit certain clustering of the grains and surface reorganization after cycling. Also, the elemental composition remains virtually constant throughout the cycles of the durability testing (inset in Fig. 3e and f), which indicates the high degree of alloying of the cobalt with the platinum in Co–Pt structures.
Notably, previous studies have shown that water-in-ionic liquid (W/IL) microemulsions, under semi-stirring conditions, were useful systems for preparing mesoporous materials.44,46 However, the high viscosity and low conductivity of these systems require deposition times approximately 30 times longer than the necessary time to attain the same deposition charge in aqueous solution. This fact limits any practical use of the water-in-ionic liquid (W/IL) microemulsions as an efficient methodology for preparing mesoporous structures.45,46 In contrast, we demonstrate that ionic liquid-in-water (IL/W) microemulsions involve significantly lower deposition times and higher efficiencies in comparison with the W/IL systems. This significant improvement arises from the high proportion of the electrolytic aqueous solution in the IL/W microemulsion, which favors an effective deposition rate. On the other hand, the presence of IL drops in the solution induces the formation of the pores. The reduced deposition time, the high porosity and excellent durability make electrodeposition in IL/W microemulsions a new realistic, exceptionably efficient approach to prepare mesoporous films of any metallic material by an easy and environmentally friendly procedure (see Experimental). In fact, the nature of the synthesis method makes this approach easily applicable to many other metals and alloys.
Another appealing feature of the mesoporous alloys prepared by IL/W microemulsions is that they can be detached from the substrate relatively easily. For sufficiently thick films (thicker than 200 nm), fragments of the mesoporous deposited material readily loosen from the substrate during the growth. Alternatively, for thinner films, other methods (like thermal shock, see Fig. 9S†) can be used to free the mesoporous material. Interestingly, the possibility to conveniently separate the mesoporous structures from the substrate opens the door to a new route to prepare freestanding mesoporous structures. Moreover, in the particular case of CoPt3 and Co3Pt, all the studied films, in particular the mesoporous ones, are magnetic at room temperature (see ESI – Fig. 10S†).53,54 Interestingly, it has been shown that the use of magnetic nano-catalysts is rather attractive since it facilitates the remote manipulation using magnetic fields.55,56 Indeed, as shown in Fig. 9S,† their magnetic character allows the easy handling of the materials with a laboratory magnet once they are detached from the substrate.
Electrocatalytic performance of Co–Pt structures
The electrocatalytic performance of the Co–Pt structures as possible fuel cells was evaluated by the methanol oxidation reaction (see Fig. 4 – normalized by the RF values – and Fig. 11S† – normalized by the geometrical area of working electrodes). The CV profiles exhibit an irreversible oxidation peak in the forward scan, which is associated with the oxidation of freshly chemisorbed methanol, accompanied by the appearance of another anodic peak in the reverse scan attributed to the oxidation of the adsorbed intermediate species produced during the forward scan (Fig. 4a and b). Importantly, the fact that the oxidation peak appears at negative potentials (Ep – Table 3) for the Co–Pt mesoporous films indicates an excellent catalytic activity for methanol electro-oxidation. Moreover, the negative shift in the onset potential (Eonset – Table 3) compared with the reference Pt structures, under the same experimental conditions, shows an obvious improvement in the kinetics of the methanol electro-oxidation, due to the synergistic effect of both the mesoporous morphology and the cobalt content.44 Similarly, the peak current densities of methanol oxidation in the forward (jf) and reverse (jb) scans for the mesoporous films are much higher than those for the nanopowder and compact film catalysts. Actually, it is important to note that the activity of the Co–Pt mesoporous films is also higher than that reported for state-of-the-art platinum-based structures.57,58 The origin of the enhanced activity arises from the fact that mesoporous or nanopowder morphologies provide a concave metal surface, which offers abundant active sites for the electro-oxidation of methanol. Moreover, taking into account that the ratio between the forward oxidation current peak (jf) and the reverse one (jb) can be considered as an index to evaluate the tolerance of poisoning species (COads, CHOads, amongst others) of each catalyst, the jf/jb values in Table 3 suggest that mesoporous and nanopowdered films not only have much higher electrocatalytic activity toward methanol oxidation, but they also release relatively less poisoning species than the compact films.

Moreover, it is worth emphasizing that the chronoamperometric curves recorded at −0.5 V for 7200 s (Fig. 4c and d) indicate that the current density of mesoporous and nanopowder morphologies for both Co–Pt stoichiometries was higher than that of compact films in the entire time range, demonstrating good stability of the catalytic performance. Finally, the turnover number (TON), which is defined as the number of methanol molecules that react per catalyst surface site, was also calculated in order to compare the catalytic efficiency of each catalyst.59,60 As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the current density after 6500 s could be considered to be the steady-state current density, and then the TON was calculated according to eqn (1): (1)where jss is the steady-state current density after the 6500 s process, n is the number of electrons produced by the oxidation of 1 mol of methanol (n = 6), F is the Faraday constant, and the density of the topmost atoms of an ideal Pt(100) surface is about 1.3 × 1015 cm−2. The TON values (at −0.5 V), summarized in Table 3, demonstrate the viability of both Co–Pt mesoporous and nanopowder morphologies, as they can oxidize more methanol per second with the same number of sites than compact structures or Pt films. Moreover, the presence of Co drastically increases the catalytic efficiency of the films.
Conclusions
In summary, mesoporous Co–Pt films with different stoichiometries (Co3Pt and CoPt3) have been obtained by a highly efficient electrodeposition approach based on ionic liquid-in-water microemulsions. The mesoporous structures do not only present a high degree of porosity, but also excellent stability and durability in both acid and alkaline media. The diverse films are magnetic and can be detached from the substrate, allowing the easy manipulation by magnetic fields. Interestingly, the mesoporous films exhibit an enhanced catalytic activity towards methanol oxidation under alkaline conditions, with exceptional stability and low catalyst poisoning. Thus, their outstanding catalytic performance and the fast, simple, inexpensive and environmentally friendly synthesis procedure make these structures excellent candidates for the commercial exploitation of direct methanol fuel cells.
