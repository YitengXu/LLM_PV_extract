1. Introduction
1.1 The significance of plasmonic silver-compound photocatalysis
Energy and environmental sustainability is crucial to economic growth and industrial prosperity. Great scientific and engineering endeavors have been made to reduce issues caused by the consumption of traditional fossil fuels1–3 through the production of renewable energy sources. For example, biofuels converted from plant stocks and chemical fuels from artificial photosynthesis burn to release energy that is harvested and converted from solar illumination. Thus, developing an efficient way to collect and convert solar energy is a step towards sustainability with the advantages of safety, environmental benignity and availability of abundant resources. Photocatalysis is a promising strategy due to the ability to capture energy from the sun,4–10 catalyze reactions of water splitting, degrade contaminants, disinfect bacteria, and convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemical fuels. The most widely investigated photocatalytic materials are the anatase/rutile-phase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) because of their low cost and structural stability. Unfortunately, the large band gap of TiO2 (3.2 eV for anatase and 3.0 eV for rutile phases) restricts their wide application. Although TiO2 can be directly excited by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the UV window accounts for only about 4% of the solar spectrum.9
Efforts have been made to develop photocatalysts that can absorb visible light with wavelengths longer than 400 nm, which correspond to ∼45% of solar light and nearly 100% of indoor light. Syntheses of photocatalysts that can be excited by visible light in order to drive useful reactions have been achieved. Some of them include designing alternative photocatalysts composed of different semiconducting materials with desirable efficiency and stability. Among the various kinds of sun-light driven photocatalysts, silver (Ag)-compound photocatalytic materials with strong absorption efficiency in the visible region have attracted particular attention in the past several years. Since many important findings have been reported on Ag-compound photocatalysts over the past few years, we believe that a comprehensive review on this subject could timely promote further development in this exciting research area.
After a brief introduction of surface plasmon resonance, this review outlines the development of several kinds of silver–silver halide (Ag@AgX) composite nano-photocatalysts (silver halides: AgX, X = Cl, Br, I, hybridized with a photoactive semiconductor or photo-inactive substrate, respectively). For each specific AgX, the materials are presented based on the decorated sensitizers, such as plasmonic noble metal NPs, semiconductor NPs, photo-inactive substrates, etc. If the AgX contains more than one type of halogen ions, the corresponding photocatalyst is included in AgX with lighter X− ions. Because many reviews are available with respect to plasmonic photocatalysis, where the noble metal NPs are introduced in an external way, this review only focuses on plasmonic silver halide photocatalysts in which metallic silver (nanograins or clusters) is produced in mother crystals by means of in situ reduction. Future challenges and research directions are subsequently discussed at the end of this review.
1.2 The principles of plasmonic photocatalysis
Noble metal NPs exhibit a collective oscillation of conduction electrons in response to an oscillating electric field. The oscillation results in redistribution of the charge density and electric field, thereby creating the so-called localized surface plasmon (LSP) with a coulombic restoring force to resist the force of positive nuclei. The plasmon resonance frequency of noble metal nanostructures, mainly Ag and Au NPs, often overlaps with the solar spectrum, increasing the absorption of visible light. When the oscillation occurs at the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelengths (530–600 nm), the power dissipation is minimal and utilization of visible light reaches the maximum, and significantly boosted solar-to-chemical/electrical energy conversion would be achieved. Theoretically, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of noble metal NPs can occur under light illumination when the frequency of the exciting light matches the natural frequency of the oscillating surface electrons (e−) (Fig. 1A).2,11 Hence, a cooperative effect would result between the plasmonic noble metal NPs and pristine photoactive semiconductors or inactive functional substrates. Plasmon-induced photocatalysts, also known as plasmonic photocatalysts, usually exhibit higher photocatalytic activity and stability than single ones when noble metals are used to harvest visible-light and to generate electron/hole centers.12–14

Plasmon enhancement has been a promising strategy to design photocatalysts with remarkably elevated performance through precisely controlled synthesis. Surface properties of noble metal NPs can be engineered through facile galvanic replacement reactions with more active metal NPs from appropriate precursors thus enabling the properties of the hybridized photocatalysts to be tuned, such as the particle size and shape, surface area, and crystalline form. Meanwhile, the absorption of the NPs under UV and visible light can also be adjusted to a wider range of wavelengths. Though Ag particles also present the SPR effect, the size of the particles influences the transformation and application of the incident light significantly.15 Generally, a small size of particles favors hot electron production from plasmonic metals, whereas a large size favors light scattering. On the other hand, light irradiation on the silver compounds leads to in situ reduction of silver NPs/clusters. The produced Ag aggregates play the role of plasmons with improved light harvesting (Fig. 1B).16 Semiconductors have also been used as SPR supporters for photocatalysis. Absorption of either UV or visible light irradiation in a semiconductor component can generate excitons (electron–hole pairs). Such an electron–hole creation could be enhanced by SPR due to antenna effects (local concentration of electric and magnetic fields). Recently, some literature studies have reviewed the LSP of noble metal NPs and the effect on semiconductors and even insulators which support the utilization of visible and UV light,14,15,17 particularly energy transfer, scattering, and hot electron transfer. Furthermore, the excited-state behavior and electron-transfer dynamics of Ag8 clusters coordinated with dihydrolipoic acid have been elucidated.16 These clusters can participate in the photocatalytic reduction process just like other molecular photocatalysts do. A quantum/classical hybrid mechanistic approach has been applied to the investigation of the photo-induced electron transfer from a neutral Ag atom to an ionized tetrahedral Ag20+ cluster.18 With the aid of theoretical simulation and transient absorption spectroscopy, plasmon-induced electron transfer processes in the Ag@AgCl structures have been identified to be accomplished on an ultrafast timescale of less than 150 femtoseconds.19 For example, five remarkable merits for plasmonic water splitting materials have been proposed:15 (1) minimization of the recombination of electrons and holes, (2) reduction of the amount of expensive or rare semiconductors required for photoabsorption, (3) sensitization of the semiconductors, (4) decrease of the light reflections at the metal@semiconductor interface, and (5) decrease of the semiconductor@electrolyte interfacial area. As a result, the LSPR effect of noble metal NPs can be used to increase sunlight absorption, improving the performance of plasmonic Ag@semiconductor photocatalysts, particularly on certain photo-inactive supports with wide bandgaps.
2. Reaction mechanisms of plasmonic Ag@AgX nano-photocatalysts
Currently, most photocatalytic reactions driven by visible light are used for the photodegradation of organic dyes, inactivation of pathogenic organisms, photoreduction of heavy metals, and water splitting. Based on photo-redox catalysis, photocatalytic reaction mechanisms are similar to various types of photoreactions. Different from conventional semiconductor photocatalysts, the reaction mechanism of hybrid Ag@AgX involves the absorption of visible light caused by the SPR of Ag NPs (and/or nanoclusters). The photochemical mechanisms can be discussed using two typical examples, plasmonic metal@semiconductor structures and Z-scheme hybrids with a metal@semiconductor@semiconductor structure.
2.1 Mechanism in the plasmonic Ag-based metal@semiconductor structure
The photocatalytic reaction mechanism has been fundamentally investigated with a variety of experiments using electron spin resonance (ESR), cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses, trapping tests of active species, and photoelectronic tests.2,20 A tutorial review is available on semiconductor-mediated photo-degradation of pollutants under visible-light irradiation,5 focusing on the unique characteristics of the photocatalysts and related radical reactions. In the photo-activation process involving silver-based semiconductors, the combination of excitons from the semiconductors and plasmons from the generated metallic Ag(0) nanospecies under photo-irradiation can enhance the SPR effect21–24 and facilitate light absorption (Fig. 1C).21 The matching electronic structure of the photocatalysts and smaller effective masses of photogenerated e− and h+ favor the transfer process of charge carriers from the bulk photocatalysts to their surficial active sites.25 Ultimately, the energetic electrons are trapped by O2 dissolved in the solution to form highly reactive species, such as O2˙−21,26–28 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). On the other hand, the leftover positive charges (h+) in the Ag NPs react with X− ions at the Ag@AgX interfaces to form highly oxidative halogen X˙ radicals (X(0) atoms) that can directly oxidize organic pollutant molecules. Meanwhile, the X˙ radicals are reduced back to X− ions. As a result, the overall photocatalytic reactions can be considered as the oxidation of organic molecules with the assistance of dissolved O2 and SPR accelerated absorption of visible light.29–31
2.2 Photo-reactions in Z-scheme hybrids with an Ag-based metal@semiconductor@semiconductor structure
The band gap and the redox power of photocatalysts can be tuned through the construction of a binary or ternary system with suitable semiconductors to satisfy the thermodynamic energy criterion for the catalytic reaction.30,32 The plasmonic Z-scheme photocatalytic system made of Ag@AgX and a smaller band gap (SBG) semiconductor with matching band potentials facilitates the interfacial charge transfer of photo-excited carriers thus maximizing the photocatalytic efficiency.4,33–36 Generally, the CB bottom and VB top of the SBG semiconductor are both below those of AgX (Fig. 1D).34,35 Under irradiation of light, the activated e− at the CB of one semiconductor displays strong photo-reduction ability and the h+ on the VB of the other semiconductor shows strong oxidation power, as in the case of the AgBr@WO3·H2O composite.4,34 In such systems, two-step visible-light absorption occurs because of the SPR of Ag NPs and photo-excitation of the SBG semiconductor. This means that light-absorption can excite and generate excitons in both AgX and the SBG semiconductor. The synergistic effect between AgX and the matched semiconductor candidates is important.37,38 Upon light illumination, the surface of AgX is partially reduced to Ag NPs. The photo-converted plasmons from the photon-absorbed Ag NPs as SPR can transfer to the CB bottom of AgX and further migrate to the CB of the SBG semiconductor. Once the photo-excited plasmons are released, photo-activated Ag-NPs (Ag-NPs*) will transform to positively charged Ag-NPsn+, which is one of the primary active species with a more positive potential. Then, either oxidation of organic pollutants or accepting e− from the VB of AgX will occur and the Ag-NPsn+ will transform to primal Ag-NPs.35 Subsequently, the photo-generated e− will ultimately be trapped by O2 dissolved in the solution to form O2˙− and the other oxidative species (˙OH), thus preventing its combination with the interstitial Ag(I),24 and improving the activity and stability of the hybridized photocatalyst.35 Likewise, the photo-induced holes in the semiconductor can oxidize X− ions to form reactive X˙ radicals, directly oxidizing organic pollutants or other electron donors.2,35 In addition, the photo-generated e− can also reduce X˙ radicals into X− ions. It was reported that AgX could maintain the stability with the assistance of the supports, ensuring the transfer of the photoexcited carriers and avoiding the photocorrosion of silver halides.35 It is worth noting that for Ag@AgX@BiOX, metallic Ag played a different role with different X− anions, causing the SPR effect for Ag@AgCl@BiOCl, and a Z-scheme bridge for Ag@AgBr@BiOBr.2
Photoreduction of AgX usually takes place during the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in the formation of SPR Ag(0) and an increase of the crystal sizes of AgX.39–41 For example, the average size of AgBr in AgBr@nanoAlMCM-41 increased from 10 nm to 25 nm after methylene blue (MB) degradation under visible light radiation.41 Dissolution of Ag(I) ions related to charge transfer was observed with cyclic voltammetry.42 However, the activity and stability of AgX hybrids were significantly increased. The Ag(0) species showed the ability to scavenge hVB+ and then trap eCB− in the process of photocatalytic reaction, preventing the decomposition of AgBr.43 The photo-decomposition of AgX and the improvement of its stability by semiconductor hybridization can be understood by dissecting the structures of AgI and AgI@TiO2 composite (Fig. 1E).44 The defects of I− vacancy clusters (e.g. Ag+–I−v–Ag+–I−v–Ag+) on the AgI surface act as electron traps, responsible for the photodecomposition of AgI. For AgI@TiO2 nanocomposites, the vacancy clusters were primarily composed of Ag+–O2−–Ti2+ bonds at the interfaces between AgI and TiO2. Surface migration of the photogenerated Ag clusters was inhibited, and increased the stability of AgI. Therefore, both nanoscale (electron) and microscale (photon) interfaces are crucial for efficient charge transport, including junctions between photoelectron donors and acceptors, as well as grain boundaries within the photocatalyst.
3. Cases of Ag@AgX based plasmonic photocatalysis
3.1 General introduction
AgX is a well-known class of optically sensitive materials in photographic films, which is usually unstable during long-term light irradiation. Under photo-illumination, the AgX components create electron–hole pairs. The photogenerated e− combine with interstitial Ag(I) ions to form metallic Ag(0) atoms and ultimately Ag clusters or NPs. The generation of Ag NPs leads to an SPR effect, i.e., a collective oscillation of the conduction electrons confined to the surfaces of Ag NPs,2,11,22–24 resulting in strong optical absorption in Ag NPs. Besides the high quantum yield, the stability of the Ag@AgX based photocatalyst is a major concern for its practical application as an alternative UV-active photocatalyst.
The modification of the crystal structure and shape of AgX will bring additional stability. Particularly, introduction of cocatalysts has been proved valid for this purpose, including the loading of a wide range of noble metals, transition-metal oxides, and nonmetal-oxides. Complex AgX nanostructures decorated with Ag as well as other noble metals such as Ag, Au and Pt can be synthesized through galvanic replacement reactions of Ag NPs with appropriate metal precursors, enabling flexibility in tuning the compositions of the composite photocatalysts. Because of the strong SPR in the metallic Ag NPs, the Ag@AgX composite NPs can absorb visible light more efficiently than the pure AgX NPs. Meanwhile, the existence of metallic Ag can improve the photo-stability of AgX as a photocatalyst since the Ag nanoclusters act as electron reservoirs to trap photo-generated electrons in AgX, eliminating the direct reduction of Ag(I) ions. There is evidence that the polarization field around AgCl can cause migration of the excited surface electrons in the Ag nanograins, thus preventing the photoreduction of AgCl to Ag with facilitated charge separation efficiency. As mentioned, it was recently found that the synergistic interplays between plasmonic Ag NPs and AgX can significantly enhance the absorption coefficient of the composites in the visible region and optical stability.12–14,19,45–49 Meanwhile, combination with other semiconductors with special morphology or structures is also beneficial for the enhancement of the stability of Ag@AgX. Therefore, the stability of the photosensitive silver halides improves and photocorrosion is weakened once the Ag@semiconductor structure is formed. Correspondingly, efficient separation of photogenerated charges is improved at the interfaces between Ag and the semiconductor. For example, the photo-stability of AgX NPs can be enhanced by anchoring them on certain other supporting composites, such as graphene oxide (GO), bismuth oxyhalide (BiOX, X = Cl, Br, I) and titanate.2,21,50
The performance of such photocatalysts is usually evaluated by the photodegradation of model molecules and microorganisms, e.g., methyl orange (MO), Rhodamine B (RhB), acid orange (ARG), 4-chlorophenol (4-CP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which are common pollutants. The photocatalytic reactions follow pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics,51–53 although the degradation of MO by AgBr@Y–zeolite was found to follow zero-order kinetics.54 Most photocatalytic reactions are carried out in aqueous solutions. Gas-phase reactions are also catalyzed to decompose toxic gases under some circumstances. Moreover, integration of a photocatalyst into a simple photo-electrochemical system/device has been explored for the photochemical oxidation of H2O to generate O2.55,56
3.2 Photocatalysis on Ag nanoparticle-based AgCl

3.2.1 AgCl decorated with Ag nanoparticles. 

In situ partial reduction of AgCl is a facile approach to synthesize an efficient Ag@AgCl hybrid photocatalyst. This strategy was achieved through a precipitation reaction between Ag+ and Cl− ions followed by photo-reduction or chemical reduction in the presence of reducing agents, e.g. NaBH4, polyol (ethylene glycol (EG) or glycerol),29,30,57 poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA).58 Compared with pristine AgCl NPs, the Ag@AgCl NPs exhibited strengthened absorption in both UV and visible regions due to the SPR of nanoscale Ag components. As shown in Fig. 2A–C,30 shape-controlled Ag@AgX (X = Cl, Br) NPs with uniform sizes could be obtained29,30,57 when glycerol was used as the solvent. These photocatalysts can be applied in the conversion of CO2 into useful organic compounds and decomposition of organics under visible-light irradiation. Alternatively, visible-light-active Ag@AgCl microstructures can also be prepared via ion-exchange between Ag2MoO4 NPs and HCl followed by the photoreduction of Ag(I) ions on the AgCl surfaces,26,29via an EG-assisted photo-reduction of Ag NPs on the surface of AgCl,19via the direct reduction of AgCl with NaBH4,11,59 and via the oxidation of metallic Ag NPs in the presence of halogen sources.22,60–63 As an additional example, cubic AgCl NPs coated by Ag nanograins via a polyol-synthesis conducted by the authors are shown in Fig. 2D.57 The as-prepared nano-photocatalysts exhibited high efficiency as well as cyclic stability towards the degradation of MB under sunlight. In addition, Ag@AgCl NPs also exhibited superior activity toward the degradation of MO64 in comparison with N-doped TiO2.

Both experimental and theoretical simulations have shown that the morphology/shape with high-surface-energy crystalline facets remarkably exposed, and the type of anions can influence the photocatalytic activities of the synthesized AgCl nanostructures.25,65–70 Tuning their morphology and terminating surface crystallinity can be achieved by carefully controlling the reaction conditions such as the concentration of precursors.67 For example, AgCl concave nanocubes with high-index crystalline surfaces and 3D AgCl hierarchical superstructures66 were synthesized through a wet chemical oxidation of Ag plates in NaCl solution with NaClO2 at room temperature. Formation of the concave nanocubes was dominated by a crystal overgrowth process rather than an etching process. The AgCl concave nanocubes exhibited higher photocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution from water oxidation than the regular AgCl nanocubes, while the 3D AgCl hierarchical superstructures exhibited even higher catalytic activity under irradiation of visible light. The electronic structures of AgCl indicated that {111} facets with Ag exposure showed higher photocatalytic activities than samples with other exposed facets (Fig. 3A–C)67 because of the reduced band gap and a smaller effective mass of carriers, resulting from the dangling bonds of surface Ag atoms without altering the oxidation potential. Fig. 3D–G present SEM images of the hierarchical AgCl structures formed from the fast growth of cubic AgCl seeds along the [111] directions.68

By controlling the chemical reduction or electron-beam irradiation of AgX NWs, a new type of Ag@AgX photocatalyst can be produced by incorporating the AgX NW core with a Ag nano/microtube shell,71 exhibiting excellent photocatalytic activities such as allowing multiple reflections of visible light within the interior cavity, providing a well-defined and clean Ag@AgX interface, and preventing the direct adsorption of pollutants on AgX. It is interesting to note that AgBr obtained via ion-exchange with AgCl NWs exhibited much higher catalytic performance for MO decomposition than the directly precipitated AgBr.71
In addition to solution-phase syntheses,72,73 hydrothermal methods were used to prepare plasmonic hybrid Ag@AgCl photocatalysts with the assistance of external stimuli such as microwave irradiation, ultrasonic wave, and specific functional agents.74–79 Moreover, a solid-state ion-exchange and redox reaction, AgCl morphology-control synthesis with controlled release of Cl− ions,80 and substitution of Cl− ions in AgCl by Br− (or I−) ions80–83 were also exploited to obtain Ag@AgBr nanocomposites.


3.2.2 Hybridized nano-photocatalysts of AgCl with photoactive semiconductors. 
AgX and Ag@AgX, particularly AgCl and Ag@AgCl, were used to modify semiconductors with suitable energy-band structures. This is an important strategy to acquire efficient coupling photocatalysts because the as-obtained composites often show higher activity and stability than the single component alone. In these composite photocatalysts, AgCl and Ag@AgCl are excellent sensitizers to engineer wide band-gap semiconductors responsive to visible-light. The combination of AgCl with certain narrow-gap semiconductors can change the transfer pathway of photo-generated charge carriers and suppress the recombination probability, further enhancing their catalytic efficiency. The stability and activity of AgCl are significantly affected by the supports, ranging from photoactive TiO2 and ZnO to photoinactive SiO2 and graphene oxide (GO) and so on, which show different capabilities to facilitate separation and transportation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
The Z-scheme principle consisting of a redox pair of photocatalysts has been proved to be an effective rule to explore new efficient photocatalytic systems.2,84,85 Considering the versatility and flexibility of noble-metal NPs and semiconductors, the principle can be applied to design efficient composite photocatalysts where metallic Ag NPs are used as visible light-active components such as the hierarchical plasmonic photocatalysts Ag@AgCl@WO3-plate23 and H2WO4·H2O@Ag@AgCl.33 Additionally, composites of AgCl@tungstates such as AgCl@Ag8W4O16 core–shell nanorods59 were synthesized through the reaction of various precursors of tungstate with Cl− ions.23,33,34,59
Although transitional metal oxides possess the merits of being inexpensive, structural stability, and suitable band gap, UV-excitation is often needed to drive the required photoreactions. To fulfill the use of solar energy, composite photocatalysts of AgCl (or Ag@AgCl) with transitional metal oxides, such as TiO2,21,81,86–91 ZnO,92,93 and WO3 (ref. 23, 78 and 94) have been extensively investigated. These coupled photocatalysts have shown remarkable stability and visible light response. In addition, bismuth (Bi) coupling with AgX has also attracted intensive interest.2,85,95–97 Nanocomposites of Ag@AgX@BiOX (X = Cl, Br)2,95 displayed much higher visible-light photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB than Ag@AgX or BiOX. A visible-light responsive Ag@AgCl@BiVO4 photocatalyst was also synthesized via a photolysis and calcination method, and showed higher activity than the Ag@AgCl composite and monoclinic sheet-like BiVO4 with a band gap of 2.4 eV.96 Recently, a plasmonic Z-scheme type of visible-light photocatalyst was prepared by anchoring Ag@AgCl NPs on the surfaces of metastable mesoporous Bi20TiO32 nanosheets.85 The effective charge transfer from the plasmon-excited Ag nanocrystals to visible-light active Bi20TiO32 significantly improves the performance of the photocatalyst.


3.2.3 Hybridized nano-photocatalysts of AgCl with carbon-based substrates. 
Carbon-based semiconductor coupled photocatalysts have recently attracted extensive attention because of their unique electronic properties and high surface area.26,42,50,51,98,99 The hybridization of Ag@AgX with GO nanosheets or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibited strong absorbance in the visible region due to the SPR absorption of Ag NPs. Meanwhile, the hybrids exhibited increased absorptive capacity of organic molecules through π–π interactions, which is beneficial for the photodegradation process. Compared to bare Ag@AgX nanospecies, the migration of photogenerated electrons to GO sheets98 or CNTs99 facilitated the charge transfer to surficial active sites and suppressed the recombination process of electron–hole pairs, leading to improved photocatalytic activities.50 In addition, a graphene (GR) nanosheets grafted Ag@AgCl composite can be prepared by photoreducing AgCl@GO hybrids98 as shown in Fig. 4. The Ag@AgCl@GO nanocomposites exhibited a 4-fold improvement in the photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light compared to Ag@AgCl NPs. Loading AgCl onto other 2D/3D supports (such as SnO2-coated glass plates,55 silica channel wall100 and ZSM-5 (ref. 101)) and coating Ag@AgCl with organic components (such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber membranes59 and DNA46) provide similar advantages.

3.3.1 Self-sensitized AgBr nano-photocatalysts. 
Plasmonic Ag@AgBr can be synthesized using various robust methods including hydrothermal,102 ion-exchange,30,102,103 microwave heating,104 simultaneously adding NaBr and [Ag(NH3)2]+ solutions dropwise into water,105 and a reaction of common-ligand-supported precursors.106 With the ionic liquid [CxMim]Br (x = 4, 8, 12, 16) acting as a precursor and template,53,66,107 AgBr and Ag@AgBr microcrystals with different morphologies could also be obtained.
Compared to irregular Ag@AgBr NPs, 1D Ag@AgBr nanorods exhibited excellent photocatalytic activities under visible light illumination,108 possibly due to the more active sites as well as superior charge separation and transfer efficiency. In addition, both experimental and theoretical studies indicated that the shape and crystallinity on the surface of AgBr are intimately related to the photocatalytic behavior.67,70,103,109–113 Consequently, great progress has been made on the control of AgBr particle shape. For example, {111} facets of AgBr, composed of unsaturated Ag atoms, have a higher surface energy than {100} and {110} facets. As a result, the {111} facet-terminated AgBr NPs exhibited higher activity towards the degradation of MO molecules than other AgBr particles in other shapes.111 The {111}-dominated Ag@AgBr NPs could be obtained via a reaction between AgNO3 and NaBr in the presence of PVP as the capping agent using a modified ion-exchange approach.111,112 The metallic Ag is found in small amounts on the surface and its influence on the photocatalytic activities is non-negligible. A synergistic effect between Ag(0) and AgBr has been demonstrated to improve the SPR of Ag(0) and accelerate the generation of e−–h+ pairs in AgBr.
A Z-scheme type of AgI@Ag@AgBr nanocomposites was also developed through an ion-exchange reaction in aqueous solution accompanied by light reduction.36 Higher activity towards the degradation of MO under visible light illumination was observed in comparison with the single components Ag@AgBr and Ag@AgI.114


3.3.2 Hybridized nano-photocatalysts of AgBr with photoactive semiconductors. 
Significant efforts using Ag@AgBr NPs have been devoted to the sensitization increase of the typical TiO2 photocatalyst for visible light utilization.21,31,39,43,52,115–123 Ag@AgBr NPs loaded on porous thorny anatase TiO2 nanotubes,123 on porous nickel,116 apatite,117 and zeolite119 demonstrate superior photocatalytic activities. ZnO-based nanostructures have also been engineered to absorb visible light by decorating them with AgBr NPs82,124,125 using various methods.
Coupling AgBr with various tungstates was used to construct novel photocatalysts. Typical examples include AgBr@WO3 and AgBr@H2WO4.126,127 The former was synthesized by loading AgBr NPs on a WO3 substrate through deposition–precipitation, whereas the latter by loading H2WO4 NPs onto an AgBr substrate. Both contained trace amounts of Ag reduced by photo-illumination and were tested on the decomposition of MO and RhB dye under irradiation of visible light. Ag@AgBr@WO3·H2O catalysts were also synthesized by reacting Ag8W4O16 with HBr followed by a light-induced reduction.4 The composite catalysts could effectively destroy E. coli and oxidize MO under the illumination of visible light. Similar methods were also adopted to prepare an Ag@AgBr@Bi2WO6 photocatalyst with Bi2WO6 as the substrate.97,128 The prepared Ag@AgBr@Bi2WO6 presented a broad visible-light response spectrum. Recently, the highly stable plasmonic Ag@AgBr@Bi2O2CO3 composite photocatalyst was prepared.129 The combination of plasmonic Ag@AgBr with porous spherical Bi subcarbonate (Bi2O2CO3) exposing {001} facets initiated enhanced photocatalytic activity for the visible light photodegradation of RhB, MB, and a mixture of RhB and MB in aqueous solutions.
AgBr NPs were also used to decorate phosphates to formulate efficient photocatalysts with excellent performance in comparison with either AgBr or the corresponding phosphates.51,110,130,131 During a photocatalytic reaction, the AgBr@Ag3PO4 catalyst could be spontaneously converted to Ag@AgBr@Ag3PO4 due to the photo-reduction of AgBr with a consistent photocatalytic performance.


3.3.3 Hybridized nano-photocatalysts of AgBr with photoinactive substrates. 
Deposition of AgBr and Ag@AgBr NPs on materials or substrates that are not responsive to light might also improve their photocatalytic performance. Layered materials such as Co–Ni–NO3 layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and mesoporous materials such as Al-MCM-41 (ref. 40 and 41) are particularly effective due to their high surface area.39,54,132–136 In the case of layered substrates, hybridization of Ag@AgBr NPs with GO or sulfonated graphene (SGE) sheets134,135 can boost the corresponding catalytic activities due to the unique conduction, VB dispersion, and low Fermi level of GO and SGE. In the case of SGE, the stability is also enhanced due to the presence of sulfonic acid groups and conjugated sp2 carbon network of SGE. More recently, CNTs-doped Ag@AgBr catalysts were also developed via a hydrothermal route136 and showed enhanced catalytic activity for the degradation of MO under visible-light irradiation. In the case of mesoporous substrates, AgBr@Y–zeolite54 and AgBr@SiO2 (ref. 39) can be applied to the degradation of MO under halogen light or direct sunlight illumination and to the generation of H2 from the photolysis of methanol in distilled water, respectively. Ag@AgBr deposited on mesoporous alumina (MA) and titanium-doped MA (MA-Ti1)42 could also efficiently catalyze the degradation of persistent toxic organic pollutants, such as 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) and phenol in water under the illumination of visible light. In addition, integration of Ag@AgBr NPs with superparamagnetic Fe3O4 NPs can alternatively facilitate the separation of the catalysts after the reactions.133

3.4 Photocatalysts made of AgI nanoparticles

3.4.1 Self-sensitized AgI nano-photocatalysts. 
The band gap of AgX decreases from AgCl to AgI, indicating an increased photo-harvest in the visible region.25 Therefore, an enhanced performance of photocatalysis is expected from the Ag@AgI system. Among the many polytypes of AgI,137 wurtzite structured (2H) β-AgI with exposed {100} facets show higher photoactivities than the samples terminated with other facets.25,44 It is worth pointing out that it is possible to control the surface facet (morphology) of the resultant AgI-based nano-photocatalysts by finely tuning the seed structure and related growth kinetics using different surfactants/polymers during the synthesis. Fig. 5A–C show the nano-photocatalysts in different morphologies generated from different polyelectrolyte media.138

(D) TEM image of AgI@TiO2 nanoparticles; and (E) time course of the decrease in dye concentration with the irradiation of visible light (λ > 420 nm). Reproduced from ref. 147, Copyrights © 2008, ACS. 
In the aspect of morphology, it was reported that anisotropic β-AgI nanoplates showed enhanced performance towards dye degradation under visible light illumination.139,140 Hexagonal β-AgI nanoplates could be prepared via a solvothermal route131 using the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide ([Bmim]I) as the iodide source. Concave AgI sub-microcrystals that could be prepared via a control-etching of spherical AgI NPs in a solution containing excessive I− ions, ethylenediamine, absolute alcohol and PVP141 also demonstrated superior performance compared to their convex and spherical counterparts for RhB degradation and hollow-structured Ag@AgI.142 In short, the shape-controlled AgI system provided an efficient platform to achieve the corresponding photocatalysis with desired properties.131,138,139,143


3.4.2 Hybridized nano-photocatalysts of AgI with photoactive semiconductors. 
The combination of AgI NPs and photoactive oxide semiconductors (e.g. TiO2 or ZnO) with a high surface area or special morphology has been an effective strategy to obtain hybridized photocatalysts with high activity.37,38,44,81,144–148 The improved photo-activity under visible light irradiation38,145,146,149 on the AgI@TiO2 system is attributed to the narrow band gap of AgI and the effective separation of e−–h+ pairs at the interfaces of the two components,144 and the structure seems to be stable during the reaction in comparison with that of AgI@SiO2 and AgI@Al2O3 nanocomposites.145,146 A more complicated nanocomposite, onion structured AgI@Ag–I2@TiO2, was also prepared147 (Fig. 5D and E) through a feasible one-pot approach, presenting higher activity towards the degradation of crystal violet and 4-CP in the whole visible-region than any of titania-, AgI@SiO2-, Ag@TiO2- and P25-supported AgI NPs. Introducing other promoters, such as PdCl2 and silver iodate (AgIO3), could also boost the visible-light-response of AgI@TiO2 nanocomposites. The introduction of external species would create a new matching band potential to collect photo-generated e−, promoting the transfer capacity of electron–hole pairs, thus enhancing the efficiency.75 AgIO3-modified AgI@TiO2 nanocomposites were reported to display superior activity and stability in the degradation of p-chlorophenol (PCP) as well.20 Hybridization of AgI and ZnO showed similar photocatalytic improvement.150
It was meanwhile reported that heterojunctions of Ag@AgI at the surface of Bi-containing semiconductors, such as AgI NPs@Ag8W4O16 nanorods151 and AgI@BiOI composites,152 possess a promoting effect similar to that in TiO2 and ZnO. These effects include effective electron–hole separation, transfer of photoinduced carriers, and decrease in the recombination of the carriers. Both AgI@Ag8W4O16 and AgI@BiOI perform well in the degradation of MO and phenol under the illumination of visible light.


3.4.3 Hybridized nano-photocatalysts of AgI with photoinactive substrates. 
Porous alumina is a good substrate and it was found that Ag@AgI@Al2O3 was effective in killing enteric pathogenic micro-organisms.27,32 Different from AgI@TiO2,145 the accelerated electron transfer rate on the Al2O3 substrate is more crucial than the electrostatic force interaction between the bacteria and the catalyst. Likewise, plasmonic bimetallic Au–Ag@AgI@Al2O3 (ref. 153) photocatalysts were more photosensitive and stable in the degradation of pollutants due to the increased SPR effect through bimetallic coupling. As for the SiO2 substrate, AgI@SiO2 is more active towards the photodegradation of acetaldehyde (gas-phase) and RhB (liquid-phase) under UV and visible light compared to its counterparts, AgCl and AgBr on SiO2, due to its narrow band gap.154 Moreover, the superparamagnetic component Fe3O4 has been introduced into this system to generate a new type of plasmonic core@shell nanophotocatalyst, Ag@AgI@Fe3O4@SiO2, to enhance the recoverability.155 For convenience, typical examples of AgI based photocatalysts are summarized in Table 3.

4. Selected examples of new applications
Visible light harvesting or utilization over Ag-compound semiconductors besides traditional TiO2 provides new possibilities and flexibility for solar–chemical energy conversion. A wide variety of functional substrates, whether they are photoactive or inactive, organic or inorganic, could be integrated with Ag-compound-containing species to induce new absorbance bands in the visible region. The visible light activities of these Ag-compound-materials have been applied in both oxidative and reductive processes. Herein, we have selected some typical examples of photocatalytic applications.
Reduction of CO2, a greenhouse gas, is an important application in which Ag-compound-photocatalysts could be utilized. Among various proposals, photoreduction of CO2 using solar energy is a sustainable route.30,31,83,156,157 In addition to the decrease of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, production of transportable hydrocarbon fuels, such as HCOOH, HCHO, CH3OH, and CH4, from this photoreaction is more appreciable. However, CO2 reduction is an uphill reaction and this process is energy intensive and thermodynamically unfavorable. The reactions of CO2 reduction are significantly determined on the basis of the energy difference between the CB of the concerned photocatalyst and the reduction potentials of CO2 (e.g., −0.24 V for the reduction of CO2 to CH4, and −0.38 V for the reduction of CO2 to methanol vs. NHE in aqueous solution at pH 7).31 With the assistance of plasmonic Ag@AgX (X = Cl, Br) NPs in an anisotropic shape, the reduction of CO2 under visible light irradiation could achieve quantum yields of 0.893% for Ag@AgCl and 0.679% for Ag@AgBr, respectively.30
Water splitting using solar energy to produce hydrogen is another green way of sustainable energy harvest.15,56,158–160 It has been demonstrated that Ag-compound photocatalysts could be used in this application. For example, Ag3PO4 exhibits excellent photo-oxidative capabilities to induce O2 evolution from water under visible-light irradiation.161,162 As shown in Fig. 6, reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-supported Ag3PO4@Ag@AgBr photocatalyst exhibits doubled O2-production activity under visible light irradiation compared to the bare Ag3PO4, unsupported Ag3PO4@Ag@AgBr, RGO-supported Ag3PO4 powder, and Ag@AgBr powder.131 This solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion is an energy efficient and environmentally benign approach to provide clean and renewable energy. Hopefully, the photocatalyst can be assembled into photoelectrodes,15 and to construct efficient and less expensive solar-to-hydrogen devices.

Additionally, data for (4) Ag3PO4@RGO are shown. Reproduced from ref. 131, Copyrights © 2012, ACS. 
On the other hand, close attention has been paid to visible-light-sensitive photocatalysts in the field of organic transformations/synthesis,163 to produce necessary organic feedstock with an environmentally friendly and energy sustainable strategy.
Meanwhile, effective photocatalytic degradation of model inorganic toxic pollutants from electrolytes and other industrial processes has shown remarkable progress, including nitric oxide NOx in the atmosphere164–166 and Cr(VI) heavy ions in water.167,168 Ag-compound nanocomposites can be utilized in solar environmental remediation because they are cost-effective for air purification and disinfection of contaminated groundwater and wastewater.169,170 Investigations have been conducted for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of various Ag-compound materials by testing the photodegradation of typical organic contaminants, such as MB (typical example of heteropolyaromatic dyes),51,129,170–174 RhB (typical example of xanthene dyes),83,95,129,175–178 fuchsin acid179 (typical example of sulfonic dyes), MO,4,71,127,180 AB 1 (ref. 125, 181 and 182) and ARG69,91,133,179,183 (typical examples of azoic dyes), IPA,184 and benzene (typical examples of industrial solvents or in-door air pollutants).185 In addition to the degradation of organic/inorganic chemicals, elimination of environmental pollutants also includes photo-induced elimination of micro-organisms or bacterial disinfection. It is remarkable that Ag-compound nanophotocatalysts possess bifunctionalities for antimicrobial applications under both dark and light conditions.186 Due to their biorecognition ability, DNA-encapsulated Ag@AgCl nanostructures can also be utilized in the photocatalytic inactivation of cancer cells, opening up a new avenue to target inactive human cancers and daylight-based theranostics.46 Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the photocatalysis process can pave the way toward the development of optical devices, photocatalysts in air/water purification systems or energy conversion devices, self-cleaning and self-disinfecting surfaces, as well as sensors or probes in biochemical and biomedical fields.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
Systematic and extensive studies of photocatalysts offer promising opportunities for effective harvest and utilization of energy from the sun. Ag@AgX photocatalysts have been recognized as one of the most environmentally benign alternatives to traditional ones. Generally, the visible light-active component is restricted to low-band-gap semiconductors. Incorporating various materials with Ag or its compounds is an appealing strategy to design novel efficient visible light-driven photocatalysts when it comes to considering the versatility of plasmonic noble-metal NPs and the broad spectral response of photoactive/photoinactive supports. For hybridized photocatalysts, the interface between the Ag@AgX photocatalyst and the decorating substrates should be well defined, which is vital for the formation of charge-separating junctions through the collection and minimization or trapping of the charge carriers. However, precise characterization of interfacial images still remains a challenge for scientists since the decomposition of Ag compounds is often inevitable when exposed to high-energy electron beam. More precise and rational control over the performance of the photocatalyst should be attempted by engineering the size, shape, coverage rate, and dielectric environment of the system. A more convenient synthesis strategy is the ultimate goal for the large-scale synthesis of photocatalysts.
Most current studies on visible light photocatalysis are focused on the photodegradation of organic dyes, photoreduction of heavy metals, and antibacterial disinfection of microorganisms in comparison with water splitting and CO2 conversion. Although the basic charge transfer and recombination pathway have been well understood theoretically, more experimental evidence is required to support these suggested photochemical mechanisms and provide clues to design an effective and economic photocatalytic system, such as the direct observation of the trapping of charge carriers, test of dynamics of carrier recombination, and so on. Systematic evaluation of photocatalysts in a broader range should also be investigated, such as overall water splitting, organic synthesis and transformations, which are usually driven by UV excitation.
For practical applications of visible-light-sensitive photocatalysts in environmental remediation, clean energy creation, and light harvesting devices, there is still a long way to go. Future work in this direction may focus on tuning the energy band structure of certain semiconductors to grasp the full potential of solar energy in order to drive more useful chemical reactions. Meanwhile, there are studies in progress for alternative novel composite semiconductors with multi-visible-light-active components or suitable structures for surface loading or functionalization to ensure the activity and stability under sunlight illumination and repeated cyclic uses.
