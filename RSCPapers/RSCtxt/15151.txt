1. Introduction
Traditional, organic-based, polymers still adopt a prominent role in today's society whether as commodity materials or as functional components in opticoelectronic devices, such as polymeric light emitting diodes. As a result of continual advances in synthetic inorganic chemistry, researchers have been able to incorporate inorganic elements into increasingly sophisticated polymeric frameworks. These efforts have led to the development of materials with hitherto unknown, and often useful, properties ranging from improved thermal and oxidative stability to redox activity. The reports presented below have been selected from the 2010 literature and reflect the surge in activity within inorganic and organometallic polymer research; it is clear from the work described in this review article that this field has a long and promising future ahead.
This review article follows similar stylistic and organizational guidelines as the previous report in this series.1 Following this brief introduction, a summary of recent books and reviews in the field of inorganic and organometallic polymers will be presented. The subsequent three sections will be devoted to research involving the well-known inorganic polymer classes: polysiloxanes (silicones), polysilanes and polyphosphazenes. After which, there will be a section describing the preparation and applications of new polymers featuring Main Group (p-block) elements. Ferrocene and related organometallic polymers will then be discussed, to be followed by a final section describing macromolecules containing transition metals.
Throughout this report, primary focus will be given towards the synthesis and properties of new, covalently linked, linearmacromolecules wherein inorganic elements represent an important part of their core structure.
2. Books and reviews of inorganic polymer science
In 2010, two issues dedicated to metallopolymers appeared concurrently in the journals Macromolecular Chemistry Physics and Macromolecular Rapid Communications.2,3 Moreover, a special issue of Applied Organometallic Chemistry was devoted towards “Future trends in organic/inorganic nanocomposite hybrids”.4 Prof. Charles Pittman Jr. was honored with a dedication issue in the Journal of Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers and Materials.5 A book describing research progress in the field of macromolecules containing metals and metalloid elements was published recently.6
A comprehensive review covering key advances in the synthesis of organoborane polymers and their use in optical, electronic and sensory applications was published.7 A related article summarizing progress in the domain of boron-containing polymers appeared in 2010.8Polymers containing B–P and B–N linkages and their related oligomeric analogues were discussed in a recent publication in the journal Chemical Reviews.9 The preparation of various polydimethylsiloxane copolymersviaradical polymerization was summarized.10Hydrosilylation is a versatile route towards generating polycarbosilanes, and progress in this field was reviewed recently.11 Polyphosphazenes continue to represent an important class of inorganic polymer and, consequently, the use of polyphosphazenes as components of nanomaterial/polymer hybrids was summarized.12 The role of polyphosphazenes in various biomedical applications related to tissue engineering was surveyed.13 The chemistry of phosphaalkenes (R2C=PR′) including their polymerization to yield stable polyphosphaalkanes has been reviewed by Gates and coworkers.14 The characterization of inorganic polymers using solid state NMR spectroscopy was described recently.15

Conjugated polymer frameworks bearing inorganic elements continues to be an active domain of study. In a recent perspective article, Bielawski and coworkers outlined various types of structurally dynamic conducting polymers, including those based upon inorganic and organometallic residues.16 In addition, the growing role of conjugated polymers in the production of efficient solar cells and white light emitting diodes has been reviewed.17–20 The use of conducting inorganic and organometallic polymer nanowires as chemical resists and luminescence-based bio/chemical sensors has been covered.21 Organometallic photovoltaics, including polymeric materials, were surveyed in 2010.22 Polyselenophenes are adopting an increasingly important role in the context of polymer-based solar cells and notably, Patra and Bendikov outlined significant advances within this polymer class.23
In 2010, a paper describing progress in ferrocene-containing polymers appeared in the open literature.24 In addition, Vancso and coworkers reviewed prior work involving the synthesis of polyferrocenylsilane gels and hydrogels, and their redox controlled actuation.25 The preparation of organometallic polymers featuring conjugated platinum(II)–ethynylbenzene repeat units has recently been the subject of a review article.26 Lastly, the optoelectronic properties of phosphorescent polymer-supported Ir(III) complexes has been reviewed.27

        Polysiloxanes and related polymers
Various poly(methylhydrosiloxane)-poly(diorganosiloxane) copolymers have been prepared which contain pendant alkylcyanide and hydroxyl groups; these polymers were then used for the in situ generation and encapsulation of palladium nanoparticles of controllable size.28
The incorporation of siloxane spacer units within polyimides (1) led to significant improvements in the thermal stability (Tdec > 450 °C) of the hybrid polymer relative to traditional polyimides, and novel thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior involving polymer 1 was observed; as a result these materials have potential application as insulating components in the electronics industry.29 In related work, Zhou and coworkers reported the synthesis of liquid crystalline polysiloxanes containing mesogenic side groups.30  
The ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of the cyclodimethylsiloxanes [Me2SiO]3–6 (D3 to D6) using triflic acid and metal triflates has been reported.31 Intriguing examples of macrocyclic dimethylsiloxanes [Me2SiO]x have been synthesized via the Pt-catalyzed dehydrocoupling of bifunctional silanes and silanols in dilute solution; specifically, cyclic products with molecular weights approaching 3500 g mol−1 were detected using a combination of GPC analysis and MALDI-TOF spectrometry.32 The Cu-catalyzed “Click” reaction between azide-capped poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) oligomers and various organodialkynes has been reported. With rigorous control of stoichiometry, polymers such as 2 with molecular weights approaching 4.5 × 104 g mol−1 were obtained, and elastic behavior was noted.33 A novel example of a thiophene-siloxane copolymer (3) has been prepared and a strong electrochromic response in this material was detected via spectroelectrochemistry.34  
Fluorinated polysilsesquioxane hollow spheres were prepared via the controlled hydrolysis of (trifluoropropyl)trimethoxysilane, and the ability of these polymeric capsules to act as drug delivery agents was demonstrated.35 A series of novel cross-linked fluorinated siloxane elastomers have been prepared which showed elasticity and toughness sufficient for commercial applications.36 The incorporation of siloxane segments within polycaprolactones led to the emergence of polymer arrays with shape memory characteristics.37 The lipase-catalyzed synthesis of siloxane-containing polyesters and polyimides has been reported; notably, the lipase enzyme was immobilized on an acrylic resin and could be readily separated from the polymer products by filtration and re-used.38 Anti-microbial polysiloxanes bearing amine functional groups have been reported.39 An interesting polysiloxane gel containing immobilized bipyridine residues was used to bind CuCl. The resulting hybrid material was shown to be catalytically active in the atom-transfer radical cyclization of various halogenated acetamides with moderate turnover numbers (TON = 220) and minimal catalyst leaching.40
4. Polysilanes, polygermanes, polystannanes, polycarbosilanes and related polymers
Highly luminescent hyperbranched polymers featuring tetraarylsilole cores (4) have been synthesized.41 These polymers showed a dramatic decrease in fluorescence in the presence of explosive agents such as picric acid, and thus could be promising as colorimetric sensor materials.41 In a related study, hyperbranched poly(silylenevinylenes) were used to detected TNTvia luminescence quenching.42  
Incorporation of silicon within fused cyclopentaditheno rings (5; E = Si) led to polymers with lower-band gaps and improved device performance in photovoltaic solar cells when compared to the carbon-bridged analogue (E = C).43 In a parallel study, the polysilole 5 showed a very high degree of hole mobility when integrated within thin film transistor devices.44 Light-emitting devices which are strongly luminescent in the UV spectral region were constructed using poly(n-butylphenylsilane) as the emitting layer. These devices exhibited low turn-on voltages (4 V) and high degrees of light emission stability and purity.45  
Helical fluorinated poly(dialkysilane)s have been prepared via standard Wurtz coupling procedures, and were shown to undergo selected quenching of fluorescence in the presence of various monoanions.46 A versatile route to functionalized polysilanes has been reported by Reuss and Frey; in this report, an acetal-protected monomer that was tolerant to reductive polymerization procedures was used to synthesize polysilane 6. Subsequent deprotection of the acetal groups in 6 yielded a polymer (7) bearing synthetically modifiable hydroxy residues.47 A series of oligosilanes containing cyclic and bicyclic Si arrays have been reported along with a detailed study of their optical properties viaUV-vis spectroscopy.48  
Polysilylenevinylenes containing paraphenylenecarbazole linkers (8) were prepared from the Rh(I) catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkynes; these materials were found to be fluorescent with quantum yields approaching 40% and the nature of the fluorescence was further investigated using detailed computational studies.49  
Leclerc and coworkers have prepared the novel polygermafluorenes 9 and 10; these polymers have low electronic band gaps making them promising candidates for the construction of polymer-based field-effect transistors and bulk heterojunction solar cells.50  
High molecular weight perfluorinated polystannanes [Ar2Sn]n (Ar = p-CF3C6H4 and (3,5-CF3)2C6H3; Mw = 1.1–1.5 × 104 g mol−1) were prepared using traditional Wurtz coupling of the halogenated monomers, Ar2SnCl2; in addition, a strong blue shift in the UV-vis absorbance (due to a σ → σ* transition) was observed relative to electron rich polystannanes, however an instability of these materials to ambient light was noted.51 A simple route to poly(dibutylstannane), [nBu2Sn]n, 11 was discovered by Foucher et al. Heating samples of nBu2SnH2 to 160 °C yielded appreciable quantities of high molecular weight 11 (Mw = 1.8 × 104 g mol−1) along with the cyclic stannanes [nBu2Sn]5,6 and the linear dimer H(nBu)2SnSn(nBu)2H.52 A detailed study involving the light stability of various polystannanes in the bulk phase and in solution was reported; in this work, the light sensitivity of the polystannanes appeared to be largely independent of the steric nature of the side groups at tin, while the presence of added radical scavengers and organic dyes led to polystannane blends with improved photostability.53
5. Polyphosphazenes and related polymers
A comprehensive study concerning the room temperature polymerization of aryl and alkyl substituted N-silyl(halogeno)phosphoranimines, XPR2 = NSiMe3 (X = halogen; R = alkyl/aryl) appeared in the literature.54 The reported procedure involved the use of phosphite donors as polymerization initiators to yield high molecular weight polyphosphazenes (12) with PDI values in the range (1.23 to 5.20); this procedure is tolerant of alkyne and allene side groups and is potentially adventitious over the pre-existing bulk thermal polymerization route (180–200 °C).54  
Modification of poly(2,2′-dioxy-1,1-biphenylphosphazene) with halogen residues led to polymers 13 with significant improved flame retardant (self-flame extinguishing) properties.55
Polyphosphazenes continue to attract attention from the standpoint of biomedical applications. For example, improved hydrophilicity of amino-acid substituted polyphosphazenes can be achieved by electrospinning these polymers with gelatin; this work should facilitate the use of polyphosphazenes as scaffolds for tissue growth.56 A detailed study involving the biodegradation of pyrrolidino-substituted polyphosphazenes under weakly acidic conditions indicated that the degradation products had low levels of cytotoxicity, thus these materials should be viable candidates for drug delivery systems.57 The synthesis of cysteine- and methionine-functionalized polyphosphazenes has also been reported.58 Moreover, peptide-modified polyphosphazenes when blended with polyesters can undergo hydrolysis to yield porous microstructures which are robust and non-toxic matrices for the regeneration of tissues.59
Films consisting of alternating layers of poly[bis(methoxyethoxy)phosphazene] and polyacrylic acid (PAA) were synthesized and shown to display ionic conductivities that were an order of magnitude better than previous hydrogen-bonded polymer films.60 Incorporation of spirocyclic methacrylate groups onto cyclic phosphazenes enabled their radical polymerization to form polymethacrylates bearing cyclophosphazene side groups (14).61 The thermal ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene, [Cl2PN]3, was investigated in situ by solid state 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy.62 Specifically, 31P NMR resonances attributed to the formation of increasingly longer oligomers over time (at 250 °C) with nearly quantitative polymerization of [Cl2PN]3 detected after 17.5 h.62  
The polyphosphazene polyelectrolyte 15 has been shown to be quite effective at stabilizing aqueous solutions of proteins; this important result could lead to the development of vaccines (containing 15 as a stabilizer) with improved thermal stability and correspondingly improved shelf-lives.63  
6. Other main group element-containing polymers
A detailed study involving the catalytic dehydrocoupling polymerization of N-substituted amine-boranes, RNH2·BH3 (R = Me and H), to yield high molecular weight polyaminoboranes, (e.g.17), was reported.64 The use of the Ir(III) pincer catalyst 16 was key to obtaining linear polymers under mild conditions; by contrast, Rh(I) catalysts, such as [RhCl(COD)]2 (COD = η4-C8H12), yielded predominantly cyclic borazines, [RN-BH]3, under similar conditions.64 In related work, low-oxidation state metallocenes (e.g.Cp2Ti(PMe3)2) have been shown to be efficient catalysts for the dehydrogenative coupling of amine-boranes.65 Moreover the non-metal “frustrated” Lewis acid/base pair, tBuP3/B(C6F5)3 also induced the oligomerization of amine-boranes at room temperature;66 it is conceivable that suitable modification of the frustrated Lewis acid/base pair could lead to the synthesis of polyamineboranes in the absence of precious metals.  
A novel class of polyorganoborate homopolymers, 18, has been synthesized by Jäkle and coworkers.67 Tetraaryl borates [BAr4]− are well-known as weakly coordinating anions, and incorporation of these units within polystyrene-polyorganoborate block copolymers led to the formation of micelle structures wherein the anionic polyorganoborate cores (18) showed the ability to encapsulate/solubilize charged metal complexes in non-polar media; hence this strategy is promising within the context of metal catalysis in non-polar media.67 Modification of the protocol used to prepare 18 gave styreneboronic acid-styrene block copolymers 19 which assembled to form micelles when dissolved in aqueous 0.1 M NaOH solutions.68  
The formation of bulk boron nitride directly from polyborazylenes was achieved. Improved ceramic yields and boron nitride sample densities were obtained when the polymers were subjected to high pressure molding prior to thermal treatment.69
Polycarboranes, 20, containing aromatic ring-fused carborane units were synthesized in high yield and molecular weights (up to 2.27 × 104 g mol−1) via Sonogashira-Hagihara coupling; these polymers exhibited intense light absorption in the UV-vis region along with modest luminescence quantum yields in the range of 40–60%.70
Chujo and coworkers reported the synthesis of conjugated organoboron polymers featuring benzo[h]quinolate moieties within the polymer main chain. TD-DFT methods involving model complexes were used to gain insight into the nature of the observed fluorescence within these quinolate polymers.71 Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization has been demonstrated to be a versatile method to prepare luminescent boron quinolate polymers and block copolymers.72 Photoluminescent chiral boron-containing polymers bearing 8-aminoquinolate groups (21) have been synthesized, and a correspondingly strong response in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra was noted at low polymer concentrations (10−5 M).73  
Deep red to near-IR emission (>700 nm) was discovered in the aromatic-based BODIPY polymers (22). In addition, these polymers exhibited modest fluorescence efficiencies (33–49%) along with significant photostabilities.74 A novel polyaminoborane (23) with alternating π-donor/π-acceptor groups along the polymer backbone was synthesized. Not only did the material show evidence of luminescent behavior, colorimetric detection of both fluoride and cyanide ions was possible.75 Low molecular weight polyphenyleneboranes (Mw = ca. 2600 g/mol) containing three-coordinate boron environments were demonstrated to be suitable electron acceptor materials for use in polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells.76  
The metal catalyzed living polymerization of vinylphosphonate 24, was shown to give high molecular weight polyvinylphosphonates (25) (Mw = 105 to 106 g mol−1).77 The reported method is superior to traditional radical or anionic polymerization strategies which only gave low molecular weight polymers; interest in polyvinylphosphonates derive from their potential use as binders in bone and dental concrete, and as flame resistant commodity polymers.77 Chiral bisphosphine units have been incorporated within polymeric arrays (26) viaCu-catalyzed “Click” chemistry; the BH3-free polymers readily bind late transition metal centers such as Cu+ and Pt2+ and the application of this polymer system as supports for transition-metal catalysis is ongoing.78  
Polyvinylenearsines, such as polymer 27, can be used to stabilize silver nanoparticles as a result of the donating ability of the soft arsenic sites within these polymers.79 The polyphosphole-oxide 28 was prepared via a palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling procedure, and was shown to possess very low band gaps and concomitant light absorption up to 800 nm.80  
The field of polymer-based solar cells is rapidly growing and, consequently, the study of thiophene polymers and their heavier congeners, polyselenophene and polytellurophene, represents a major field of research. In 2010, the controlled synthesis of hybrid thiophene-selenophene copolymers (29) was achieved via Grignard Metathesis Polymerization (GRIM).81 These materials are being explored as light absorbing photovoltaic materials for solar cell applications as they possess very broad absorption profiles that are red-shifted from that of the industry work-horse, poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT.81 The electropolymerization of the cyclopentaselenophene (30) gave the novel polyselenophene (31) which was shown to have a narrow band gap (1.65 eV) and impressive stability in the oxidized state.82 Very high power conversion efficiencies (up to 7.4%) were observed within bulk heterojunction solar cells featuring the modified polythiophene (32) as the electron donor layer.83

Block copolymers consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and poly(arylisocyanide) segments (33) were synthesized via sequential insertion of arylisonitriles into a Ni(dppp)Br-capped terminus of a thiophene-rich polymer chain (dppp = bis(diphenylphosphino)propane).84 This route provided significant control over the molecular weight and morphology of the resulting block copolymers, and therefore this chemistry could be used to develop well-defined conducting polymer architectures for photovoltaic devices.84  
The polythienylvinylene 34 has been prepared by the ring-opening polymerization of a strained cyclic precursor. Polymer 34 was obtained in moderate molecular weight (Mw = 1.04 × 104 g mol−1; PDI = 1.8) and the construction of polymeric solar cell devices using this material was reported.85Polymers related to 34 were explored within the context of light emitting materials; specifically polymer 35 displayed high stability in both the n- and p-doped states, and photoluminescent quantum yields as high as 68% were obtained.86 In addition, monoalkylated polythienylvinylenes were shown to have narrower band gaps than P3HT, however only modest solar power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 0.8% were found when these polymers were incorporated within bulk heterojunction solar cell devices.87  
The incorporation of s-tetrazine units as part of the thiophene-containing polymer 36 resulted in high solar power conversion efficiencies (as high as 5.4%) within the corresponding polymeric solar cell devices.88 A promising class of thiophene-pyridine copolymers, 37, with extremely small optical band gaps of ca. 1.6–1.7 eV was recently synthesized.89  
Amphiphilic block copolymers involving conjugated poly(3-octylthiophene) and insulating polyethylene oxide (PEO) segments have been described. These materials display solvent-dependent luminescence that arise from the different aggregate structures that can be adopted upon solvation.90 A new method to prepare polythiophenes based upon dehydrohalogenation polymerization has been developed.91
Polyorganosulfones (39) were prepared from the radical addition copolymerization of SO2 with 2,4-hexadiene, 1,3-butadiene and isoprene. The initially formed poly(diene-alt-sulfurdioxide) polymers 38 readily depolymerized upon heating, however hydrogenation of the CC residues led to a saturated polymer (39) that displayed both improved solubility and thermal stability.92  
Seferos et al. recently reported the synthesis of soluble polymers with alternating bitellurophene and fluorine units 40. Interestingly, selective oxidation of 40 with elemental bromine afforded the polytellurophene-fluorene copolymer, 41, along with a significant red-shifting of the absorbance maxima from that of polymer 40. The ability to incorporate tellurophene units into a soluble polymer framework should prove to be an important advance in the blossoming field of polymeric photovoltaics.93  
7. 
        Ferrocene-containing and related metallocene polymers
Müller and coworkers reported the successful isolation of the donor-stabilized polyferrocenylgallane, 42. Despite the high levels of moisture sensitivity generally exhibited by molecular organogallanes, polymer 42 was sufficiently stable under ambient conditions to allow for molecular weight analysis by gel permeation chromatography (Mw = 4.8 × 104 g mol−1; PDI = 3.3). In addition stereochemical inequivalence within 42 was detected along the polymer backbone by 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy.94 The photo-assisted living anionic polymerization of strained phospha[1]ferrocenophanes was reported.95 The polymers obtained (43) were isolated (R = tBu, CH2tBu and CH2SiMe3) with molecular weights approaching 6.0 × 104 g mol−1 along with narrow molecular weight distributions (PDI 1.05–1.23).95 The thermal ring-opening of dicarba[2]ferrocenophanes was studied using a combined theoretical and experimental approach; this work indicated that homolytic C–C bond cleavage was the operative ring-opening pathway.96  

Block copolymers containing polyvinylferrocene (PVF) segments have been prepared (44) via a new anionic polymerization protocol. The key breakthrough was the reactivation of anion-terminated dormant PVF chains by mixtures of diphenylethylene and 1,1-dimethylsilacyclobutane, thus allowing additional anionic polymerization and block copolymer formation to transpire.97 Polyferrocenylsilanes bearing fluorinated silane side groups were synthesized (45) via photocontrolled anionic polymerization; the resulting polymers were shown to exhibit enhanced hydrophobicity relative to previously reported polyferrocenylsilanes (as determined by contact angle measurements).98  

        Redox-active hyperbranched polyphenylenes containing ferrocene side groups were prepared. Pyrolysis of these materials yielded iron-rich ceramics with very high magnetizabilities.99 Cross-linked networks derived from the controlled hydrolytic gelation of alkoxysilane-functionalized polyferrocenylsilane microfibers were shown to display electroactuation (macroscale polymer fiber coiling) upon the application of either current or chemical oxidation of the iron(II) centers.100 A general method to form cylindrical micelles containing redox active polyferrocenylsilane (PFS) cores was reported. By taking advantage of the highly crystalline nature of the PFS core, cylindrical micelles of controllable lengths and narrow size distributions were obtained.101 The same group reported the formation of pointed oval-shaped micelles via the co-assembly of PFS-poly(2-vinylpyridine) and PFS-polyphosphazene block copolymers in iPrOH/THF solutions.102
The cycloaddition of alkyne-substituted molybdocenes (46) with 1,4-bis(azidomethyl)benzene has been shown to yield high molecular weight polymers (47) in the presence of catalytic quantities of Cp*Ru(PPh3)2Cl (Cp* = η5-C5Me5).103  

Block copolymers containing hydrophilic cobaltocenium side groups have been shown to assemble into either vesicle or nanotube structures depending on the nature of the solvent system present.104 Polyacrylates bearing redox active cobaltocenium side chains (48) have been prepared via the radical polymerization of metalloceneacrylate monomers. The counteranions in 48 could be readily changed (e.g. from PF6− to BPh4−) to yield organometallic polymers that are soluble in a wide range of solvents of differing polarity.105  
8. Other metal-containing polymers
A series of bis(bithiophene) polymers containing N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as part of their core structure was recently synthesized by electropolymerization. The strong σ-donating ability of the NHC sites along the polymer backbone enabled the formation of macromolecular complexes of Ag, Au and Ir (49); the Ir analogues showed reversible electrochromic behavior that was attributable to the formation of highly coloured bipolaron states upon oxidation.106 The novel cage complexes (50) were electropolymerized to give metallopolymers with electron transport and redox activities that depended markedly on the nature of the chelated metal (M = Co, Fe and Ru).107  
The titanacyclopentadiene-containing polymer (51) was efficiently converted into the polyphenylene analogues (52) viaHCl or halogen-promoted cleavage of the Ti(OiPr)2 groups in 51.108 In related work, polymer 51 was used to generate the thioether-functionalized aryleneethynylene polymer 53.109  
Metalloporpyhrin macrocycles with up to 12 coordinated Zn2+ centers have been prepared. These complexes are models for the light harvesting units in photosynthetic bacteria, and studies directed towards uncovering the mechanism of the electron transport through these materials are ongoing.110 The self-assembly of the Zn-porphyrin polymer (54) was studied on a gold surface by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM).111Zinc porphyrin structures were copolymerized with conjugated fluorine segments to yield branched polymeric arrays with extremely bright red luminescence (intensity = 740 cd/m2).112 In a related study, polymers containing zinc porphyrin and various π-conjugated monomers (e.g.pyrazine, perylene diimide and thiophene) were synthesized and shown to possess extremely narrow electronic band gaps (as low as 1.15 eV).113  
Cyclometallated platinum-based polymers (e.g.55) were synthesized and demonstrated to be viable candidates for use in bulk heterojunction solar cells.114 An interesting class of conducting polythiophenes bearing NCN-Pt pincer groups (56) were synthesized via electropolymerization. Detailed investigation of monomeric models indicate that the degree of Ligand-to-Metal-Charge-Transfer (LMCT) can be tuned upon changing the oxidation state of the metallothiophene units, thereby allowing a considerable degree of control over the optical and conducting properties of these materials.115 Polythiophenes bearing porphyrin-coordinated Ni(II) centers have been prepared.116 A Ni-based polymetallosalophen polymer with π-conjugated fluorene residues (57) was recently synthesized with an average degree of polymerization (DP) of ca. 10 as determined by end-group analysis (1H NMR).117  
Mixed metal polymetallynes containing Zn and Pt centers (58) were prepared; the presence of two distinct, strong absorption bands in the visible region, coupled with a high propensity for photoinduced electron transfer, makes these materials promising within the context of photovoltaic applications.118 Sonagishira coupling was used to synthesize the low band gap metallopolyyne (59) which can absorb light up to 800 nm.119 Chujo and coworkers reported on the synthesis of polyarylynes containing chiral phosphines units; in the presence of PdCl2 a novel metallopolymer (60) was isolated.120  

        Vesicles were prepared via the self assembly of poly(styrene-block-2-vinylpyridine) copolymers; subsequent chemical reduction of soluble gold precursors in the presence of these vesicles led to a hybrid material wherein the Au nanoparticles generated by reduction were anchored to the polymer scaffold viapyridine–Au interactions.121 A series of luminescent polymers containing Ir(III) complexes as side groups were shown to be efficient sensors for trace quantities of mercury(II); specifically, strong optical changes in this material were observed with Hg2+ concentrations as low as 0.5 ppb.122 In related work, incorporation of carbazole units into the polymer framework of 61 gave an Ir(III)-bound polymeric light emitting diode capable of strong white light emission.123 White electroluminescence was also noted in polystyrene copolymers functionalized with two distinct Ir(III) chromophores.124 A polymer containing grafted Re(I) units was prepared and light absorption extending into the near IR region (ca. 900 nm) was observed.125
