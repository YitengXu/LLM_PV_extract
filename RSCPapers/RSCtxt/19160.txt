    , Accepted 28th September 2021First published on 28th September 2021AbstractThe three-dimensional (3D) organic–inorganic halide perovskite MAPbI3 has excellent light-harvesting properties but is unstable. However, the newly synthesized two-dimensional (2D) all-inorganic Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2 has superior stability but adverse photoelectric properties. Therefore, constructing a 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2/3D MAPbI3 heterostructure is expected to combine the superstability of the 2D material and the high efficiency of the 3D one. The photoelectric properties and charge transfer of 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2/3D MAPbI3 heterostructures are investigated using density functional theory, where MAPbI3 has two kinds of contacting interfaces, i.e., MAI and PbI interfaces. The band gaps of 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures are 1.52 eV and 1.40 eV, smaller than those of the free-standing materials (2D ∼ 2.50 eV, MAI ∼ 1.77 eV, and PbI ∼ 1.73 eV), which can broaden the light absorption spectrum. Moreover, the 2D/3D heterostructures are typical type-II heterostructures, which is beneficial to facilitate the separation of carriers for increasing the photoelectric conversion. Interestingly, due to the work function difference (2D ∼ 4.97 eV, MAI ∼ 3.57 eV, and PbI ∼ 5.49 eV), the charge transfer directions of the 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures are completely opposite, which shows that interface engineering to impose a consistent interface termination is needed to obtain good performance for solar cells. These results demonstrate that constructing 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 and 3D MAPbI3 heterostructures by interfacial engineering is a potential strategy to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as promising photovoltaic and photoelectric materials due to their high device efficiencies and low-temperature solution processability.1,2 In the past decade, the PSC field has witnessed a marked increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from ∼3 to 25.2%, which has surpassed those of the mainstream multi-crystalline silicon and conventional thin-film solar cells, for instance, cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) solar cells.3–6 The general formula of metal halide perovskites is ABX3 where A is MA (= CH3NH3) or FA (= CH3(NH2)3), B is Pb, Ge or Sn, and X is I, Cl or Br. Among them, MAPbI3 has been considered as a typical promising photovoltaic material,7,8 which has remarkable electrical and optical properties such as high absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime, high charge-carrier mobility, and long electron and hole diffusion length.8–11 Despite these advantages, the commercial application of three-dimensional (3D) photovoltaic solar cells is still challenging due to the poor long-term stability of organic–inorganic halide perovskites.12,13
However, researchers find that two-dimensional (2D) perovskites with the general formula An+1BnX3n+1 (n = 1, 2,…), known as Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites, which are composed of alternating 2D perovskite slabs and spacer cations, demonstrate higher environmental stability compared with their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts.14–17 The enhanced stability of 2D RP perovskites stems from their cation spacers and the preferential crystal growth of 2D perovskites parallel to the substrate, so vertical charge transport is severely impaired.18 Chang et al. fabricated 2D organic–inorganic RP perovskite (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnX3n+1 (X = Br or I) quantum dots (QDs) with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 48.6% and discovered that 2D perovskite QDs showed more optical stability than 3D perovskite QDs.19 Compared with organic–inorganic halide perovskites, all-inorganic halide perovskites have higher inherent stability, especially under thermal stress.20,21 Recently, Li et al. fabricated all-inorganic 2D RP halide perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2 and proved that the Cs2PbI2Cl2 exhibits obviously ambient and thermal stability due to no signs of degradation or new phases after four-month storage in ambient air.22 However, adverse photoelectric properties, including a wide bandgap and low carrier mobility, restrict the applications of these materials in optoelectronics.22,23
Therefore, we want to construct a 2D all-inorganic RP perovskite/3D organic–inorganic perovskite heterostructure. More recently, the construction of 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures has emerged as a viable approach to combine the high efficiency of the 3D perovskite and the superior stability of the 2D perovskite.24–27 Qin et al. fabricated a 2D (BA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10/3D MAPbBr3 heterostructure, which preserves many beneficial properties of the 3D perovskite and can significantly improve the efficiency of 2D perovskite solar cells.28 Grancini et al. fabricated a 2D/3D (HOOC(CH2)4NH3)2PbI4/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite junction with significantly enhanced device stability which yields up to 14.6% in a standard mesoporous solar cell and 12.9% efficiency in a carbon-based architecture.13 Liu et al. investigated the electrical properties and charge transfer characteristics of 2D BA2PbI4/3D MAPbI3 heterostructures, and reported that constructing 2D BA2PbI4 and 3D MAI interface heterostructures by interfacial engineering is a potential strategy to enhance the performance of 2D/3D heterostructured PSCs.29 There are many reports on 2D organic–inorganic perovskite/3D organic–inorganic perovskite heterostructures, but there are no reports on 2D all-inorganic RP perovskite/3D organic–inorganic perovskite heterostructures. Based on the previous discussion, a 2D organic–inorganic perovskite/3D organic–inorganic perovskite heterostructure is less stable than a 2D all-inorganic RP perovskite/3D organic–inorganic perovskite heterostructure. Therefore, constructing a 2D all-inorganic RP perovskite/3D organic–inorganic perovskite heterostructure could extremely improve the structural stability and ensure that the performance does not decrease.
In this paper, the interfacial electrical and optical properties of 2D all-inorganic RP perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2/3D organic–inorganic perovskite MAPbI3 heterostructures, including band gaps, density of states, band edge alignment, work function, and optical absorption, are systemically studied using first-principles calculations. The 3D MAPbI3 has two kinds of interface terminations, namely, the MAI-terminated interface and PbI-terminated interface, respectively. Thus, the 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures are constructed. Our results would contribute to the further performance improvement of 2D/3D perovskite solar cells.
2. Computational methods
The calculations are performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code, based on DFT.30,31 The projector-augmented wave method is used to describe the interaction between valence electrons and ion cores.30–45 Atomic structures are optimized using the exchange–correlation functional of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) combined with the DFT-D3 method of Grimme for describing the vdW interaction. The HeydScuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional46 with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is used to accurately calculate the bandgap values where the mixing parameter is 0.25 and the screening parameter is 0.2 Å−1. The PBE + SOC is used to calculate the density of sates in comparison with the PBE functional. The energy cut-off for the plane-wave basis is set to 400 eV. The convergence of the total energy with a cut-off energy of 400 to 600 eV is calculated, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We employ a Monkhorst–Pack K-mesh grid 4 × 4 × 1 for the structural optimization and self-consistency. The structure is fully relaxed and converged until the energy convergence threshold on each atom is less than 1 × 10−4 eV and the total force on each atom is less than 0.02 eV Å−1. The figures are drawn using VESTA and Origin.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structures
The calculated lattice parameters of the tetragonal 3D MAPbI3 slab are a = b = 8.80 Å and c = 13.04 Å and those of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer are a = b = 5.64 Å, respectively, which are directly determined using experimental results.22,47 Considering the tetragonal phase of MAPbI3, which is stable at room temperature,48 (001) and (110) are the only flat, neutral surfaces, which consist of alternate stacking of the neutral [MAI]0 and [PbI2]0 planes. These are thus expected to be the most stable perovskite surfaces, as supported by DFT calculations performed by Haruyama et al.49 and Yin et al.50 In fact, X-ray diffraction measurements reveal the (110) peak in planar heterojunction PSCs (MAPbI3−xClx)3 and (110) and (001) peaks on mesoporous-TiO2 films (MAPbI3).51 Quarti et al.52 and Haruyama et al.49 verified that the (001) and (110) surfaces show quite similar electronic properties. Therefore, we used MAPbI3 of the (001) surface. The unit cell of the heterostructure is composed of  Cs2PbI2Cl2 and 1 × 1 MAPbI3, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The lattice mismatches of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2/3D MAPbI3 heterostructure along x and y directions are calculated as 4.92%, and the mean absolute strain is 3.28%, which are in a reasonable range.53,54 The lattice parameter of the heterostructure is listed in Table S1 (ESI†). Three-layer thickness of 3D MAPbI3 is used, which shows similar performance to the bulk material.55 The 3D MAPbI3 has two kinds of interface terminations, namely, the MAI-terminated interface and PbI-terminated interface, respectively. The periodic structure of 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The corner-sharing octahedra [PbI2Cl4]4− forming a 2D network are blocked by Cs atoms only along the c axis and can extend infinitely along a and b axes, which belong to the 2D RP perovskite.22 The layers are connected by van der Waals forces. We tested the number of layers in 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 and found that it has little effect, and the test results are listed in Table S2 and Fig. S4 (ESI†). The monolayer 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 is used. Therefore, two types of heterostructures are constructed, i.e. 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures. Fig. 1 shows the two contacting interfaces of 2D/3D heterostructure diagrams. The distance of the vacuum space is set to 15 Å in the Z direction to avoid the interaction of adjacent slabs. The relaxed vertical interlayer distance of d1 for the 2D/MAI heterostructure equilibrium configuration is 2.34 Å, which is obviously longer than the interfacial C–H (∼1.1 Å) and N–H (∼1.0 Å) bond lengths. The d2 for the 2D/PbI heterostructure is 3.30 Å, which is also longer than the interfacial Pb–I (∼3.1 Å) bond length. The results reveal that the 2D and 3D perovskites are connected by weak van der Waals forces (vdW) in the heterostructure. The excellent properties of the 2D and 3D perovskites can be preserved in the vdW heterostructure.

To obtain a structure of relative stability, the binding energy (Eb) is calculated according to the following equation: Eb = E2D/3D − E2D − E3D(1)where E2D/3D is the total energy of the 2D/3D heterostructure, while E2D and E3D are the total energies of the 2D perovskite monolayer and the 3D perovskite slab, respectively. The Eb of the 2D/MAI heterostructure is −2.86 eV, where E2D/MAI is −442.41 eV, E2D is −43.66 eV, and EMAI is −395.89 eV. The Eb of the 2D/PbI heterostructure is −2.91 eV, where E2D/PbI is −373.93 eV, E2D is −43.66 eV, and EPbI is −327.36 eV. The negative results indicate that the interface formation between the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 and 3D MAPbI3 is exothermic, revealing that this contact can be easily formed in the experiment.42 To further verify the stability, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation was performed to calculate the energy fluctuation of the 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures at room temperature, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Here, the simulations lasted for 20 ps with a time step of 1 fs. The energy in the AIMD trajectory of the 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures fluctuates steadily around −428 eV and −361 eV with the change of simulation time, respectively, which indicates that the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2/3D MAPbI3 heterostructures are structurally stable.
3.2 Electronic properties and band alignment
The band gaps of the 2D, 3D perovskites, and the heterostructures are calculated using the PBE and HSE06 + SOC methods for comparison. The band gaps of the 2D and 3D perovskites are not much different between the two methods and consistent with the experimental and theoretical results.56–58 The results are shown in Table 1. The HSE06 functional overestimates the band gaps of the perovskites and the typical effect of SOC reduces the bandgap with respect to calculations without SOC. The band gaps using the PBE method can agree well with the experimental band gaps due to accidentally error–error cancellation. In general, in order to study the accurate electronic characteristics of Pb-based perovskites, the SOC effect cannot be neglected.59 Therefore, the HSE06 + SOC method, which is the more accurate functional, is mainly used to calculate the band gaps. From Table 1, the band gaps of the 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures are 1.52 eV and 1.40 eV, which are smaller than that of the isolated 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 and 3D MAPbI3.

The partial density of states (PDOS) is determined to explore the type of heterostructures. The PDOS of 2D/3D heterostructures is calculated via the PBE + SOC method, as shown in Fig. 2. As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), the conduction band minimum (CBM) consists primarily of Pb atoms in 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 (Pb-2D), whereas the valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly the contribution of I atoms of 3D MAI-terminated (I-3D), which demonstrates that the 2D/MAI heterostructure shows Type II characteristics with the CBM contributed from the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer and the VBM contributed from the 3D MAI-terminated layer. As seen in Fig. 2(b), the CBM is primarily occupied by the Pb atom of 3D PbI-terminated (Pb-3D), and the VBM consists mainly of I atom of 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 (I-2D), which means that the 2D/PbI heterostructure also shows Type II characteristics with the CBM contributed from 3D PbI-terminated and the VBM contributed from the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer. The PDOS of the 2D/3D heterostructure is also calculated using the PBE method, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The results are consistent with the PBE + SOC method. In order to facilitate the separation of the carrier for increasing the photoelectric conversion of perovskites, constructing highly efficient Type-II composites is a highly appropriate way. Thus, the two heterostructures we construct may improve the PCE of perovskite solar cells.

3.3 Band edge alignment and charge transfer
The band edge alignments count a great deal for the study of interfacial charge transfer in the perovskite heterostructure. The band edge alignments of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer perovskite and 3D MAPbI3 slab perovskite including PbI-terminated and MAI-terminated in the pre-contact and contact states are studied using the PBE method. It is worth noting that the PBE functional is adopted rather than the HSE06 + SOC functional to calculate the energy level arrangement as computational resources are limited. Liu et al. have proved that the energy level arrangement and work function calculated using the PBE method for Pb-based perovskites are consistent with the conclusions calculated using the HSE06 + SOC method.29 Quarti et al. calculated the energy level alignment of the MAPbI3 perovskite/C60 interface and they concluded that once calculation corrections are considered, the relative positions of the LUMO of C60 and the conduction band edge of MAPbI3 are unvaried.52 Thus, the relative positions of band alignments calculated by the PBE method are reliable.
The band alignments of heterostructures in the pre-contact and contact states are shown in Fig. 3. The vacuum level (EV) is set to zero in the pre-contact state, and the Fermi level (EF) is set to zero in the contact state. In the 2D/MAI heterostructure, it is clear that the CBM is dominated by the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2, while the VBM is contributed by the 3D MAI-terminated, as shown in Fig. 3(c). In the 2D/PbI heterostructure, the CBM is contributed by 3D PbI-terminated, while the VBM is dominated by the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2, as seen in Fig. 3(d). The 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures show the typical type-II band alignment, but the contributions of band edges are completely opposite, which are consistent with the conclusions of the PDOS calculations. From Fig. 3 we can see that the band edges of the 3D MAI-terminated are above in energy compared to those of the 3D PbI-terminated, which is the main reason for the opposite band edges contribution of the 2D/3D heterostructures when changing the 3D surface in contact with the 2D surface. At the same time, the charge transfer directions of the two heterostructures are opposite. In the 2D/MAI heterostructure, the CBM level and VBM level of 3D MAI-terminated are higher than that of 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer. Therefore, the electrons will spread from 3D MAI-terminated to the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer and the holes flow from the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer to 3D MAI-terminated, leading to the spatial separation of electrons and holes. Based on the above discussion, we can know that the holes would accumulate in the 3D MAI-terminated interface, which will result in the increase of the electric potential. Therefore, the band structure of the 3D MAI-terminated interface is bent up toward the interface. In contrast, the band bending of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 is downward. The band bending diagrams are plotted in Fig. S7(a) (ESI†). In the 2D/PbI heterostructure, the CBM and VBM levels of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer are higher than that of the 3D PbI-terminated. Thus, the electrons will spread from the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer to 3D PbI-terminated while the holes will move in opposite directions, the same as that occurring in the spatial separation of electrons and holes. According to the above discussion, the holes would accumulate at the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 interface, leading to the increase of electric potential. As a result, the band structure of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 interface is bent up toward the interface. The band structure bending of the 3D PbI-terminated interface is opposite to that of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 interface. The band bending diagrams are plotted in Fig. S7(b) (ESI†). The band bending induces a built-in field, which drives the photogenerated electrons and holes to move in opposite directions, leading to a spatial separation of the electrons and holes on different sides of the heterostructure.60,61

The top and bottom of the corresponding rectangles signify the CBM and VBM values, respectively. The blue dotted lines represent the Fermi levels. The vacuum level is set to zero in the pre-contact state. The Fermi level is set to zero in the contact state. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 
The efficient separation of carriers is inseparable from the work function difference of 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer relative to the 3D MAPbI3 slab. The work function indicates the ability to bind electrons and can be defined as the difference between the vacuum level and Fermi level. The greater the work function, the more difficult the electron transfer. Therefore, when two materials come into contact, electrons tend to transfer from the material with a small work function to the material with a large one. The calculated work functions of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer, 3D MAI-terminated, and 3D PbI-terminated are 4.97 eV, 3.57 eV, and 5.49 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4. The work function of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer is greater than that of the 3D MAI-terminated but smaller than that of the 3D PbI-terminated, which is why the charge transfer directions of the two heterostructures are opposite. The difference in the work function of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer and 3D MAI-terminated (1.40 eV) is larger than that of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer and 3D PbI-terminated (0.52 eV), which demonstrates that the amount of electrons transferred are larger in the 2D/MAI interface heterostructure. It is worth mentioning that the difference of electrostatic potential minima of 3D MAPbI3 is caused by the inconsistent MA molecule orientation.62 We calculated the work function before compression of 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2, 3D MAI-terminated and 3D PbI-terminated for comparison, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†). No matter before or after compression, the work function of 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 is always higher than that of the 3D MAI-terminated and lower than that of the 3D PbI-terminated, which further indicated that the lattice mismatch is reasonable. Thus, interface engineering to impose a consistent interface termination is needed to obtain good performance from these solar cells.

In the type-II heterostructures, the conduction band offset (CBO) is crucial for electron transport and the valence band offset (VBO) is crucial for hole blocking. Due to the existence of the CBO and VBO, there is a potential difference,63 which drives the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the low potential to the high potential, and the transfer of photogenerated holes from the high potential to the low potential. For the 2D/MAI heterostructure, the band edge of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer varies from −1.71 to 0.71 eV, while that of 3D MAI-terminated from −0.49 to 1.24 eV. The CBO between the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer and 3D MAI-terminated is 0.53 eV. The VBO between the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer and 3D MAI-terminated is 1.22 eV. As for 2D/PbI heterostructure, the CBO and VBO are at 1.51 eV and 0.8 eV, respectively. For the 2D/MAI heterostructure, the CBO promotes photogenerated electron transfer from the CB of 3D MAI-terminated to that of 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer, and the VBO induces the photogenerated holes of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer to transfer the VB of 3D MAI-terminated. In the case of the 2D/PbI heterostructure, the calculated CBO demonstrates that the photogenerated electrons move from the CB of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer to 3D PbI-terminated, and the VBO indicates that the transfer direction of the photogenerated holes is from 3D PbI-terminated to the VB of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer.
The 3D charge density difference (CDD) can intuitively show the detailed nature of the charge transfer at the interface of the 2D/3D heterostructure. This is calculated from the following formula: Δρ = ρ2D/3D − ρ2D − ρ3D(2)where ρ2D/3D, ρ2D and ρ3D correspond to the charge densities of the heterostructures, isolated 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer, and 3D MAPbI3 slab, respectively. The calculated 3D CDD of the 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures is shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. The red cloud represents electron accumulation and the yellow cloud represents electron depletion. It is shown that the charge accumulation and depletion of two heterostructures are mainly concentrated in the vicinity of the interfacial areas. As seen in Fig. 5, the amount of the charge transfer is very large in the 2D/MAI heterostructure while the amount of the charge transfer is relatively small in the 2D/PbI heterostructure, which is owing to the fact that the difference in the work function of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer and 3D MAI-terminated is larger than the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer and 3D PbI-terminated. The calculated results reveal that the 2D/MAI heterostructure is more conducive to charge transfer at the interface and decreases the recombination rates of electron–hole pairs.

3.4 Optical properties
The study of optical properties is of great significance to the performance of perovskite-based photoelectric devices. The absorption spectra of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer, 3D MAI-terminated, 3D PbI-terminated, 2D/MAI heterostructure, and 2D/PbI heterostructure are calculated, as shown in Fig. 6. The absorption spectrum can be calculated from the equation:64 (3)where α is the absorption coefficient, ω represents the optical frequency, and ε1 and ε2 are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. The 2D/3D heterostructures show more superior optical absorption than the isolated 2D and 3D perovskites, indicating that the 2D perovskite does not reduce the light absorption and 2D/3D heterostructures retain the excellent performance of 3D perovskites. Therefore, building 2D/3D heterostructures is an effective strategy to improve the performance of the PSCs. The increased light absorption can be attributed to the charge transfer and interlayer coupling between the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer and 3D MAPbI3 slab. The absorption coefficient of 3D MAPbI3 slab is obviously higher than that of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 monolayer. Thus, the 3D MAPbI3 slab plays a major role in the light absorption in the 2D/3D heterostructures. The excellent optical performance will make the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2/3D MAPbI3 heterostructure a promising candidate material for perovskite photovoltaic applications.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the interfacial electronic properties of 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI vdW heterostructures are investigated using DFT calculations. The band gaps of the 2D/3D heterostructures are smaller than those of the 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 and the 3D MAPbI3. Moreover, the 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures form a class of typical type-II heterostructures. Although both the 2D/MAI and 2D/PbI heterostructures have a type-II band arrangement, the charge transfer directions of the two heterostructures are opposite. Thus, interface engineering to impose a consistent interface termination is needed to obtain good performance from these solar cells. The amount of charge transfer in the 2D/MAI heterostructure is greater than that in the 2D/PbI heterostructure, which demonstrates that the 2D/MAI heterostructure is more conducive to charge separation than the 2D/PbI heterostructure. Therefore, the 2D/MAI heterostructure is more suitable for photovoltaic applications. Besides, the light absorption of the 2D/3D heterostructure is higher than that of isolated materials. As a result, constructing 2D Cs2PbI2Cl2 and 3D MAPbI3 heterostructures by interfacial engineering is a potential strategy to improve the stability and performance of PSCs.
