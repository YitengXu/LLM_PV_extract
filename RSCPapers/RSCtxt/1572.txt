    , Accepted 11th September 2017First published on 12th September 2017AbstractDouble branched donor acceptor compounds (D–π–A)2L, whose separate branches are linked by saturated chains or ring systems, are highly promising sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their photovoltaic performance η (power conversion efficiency PCE) is higher than the η value of the corresponding single branched sensitizers D–π–A. This advantage can be attributed to the lower aggregation tendency and to the higher loading density of the chromophores on the semi-conductor surface (TiO2). Moreover, the intramolecular transfer of the excitation energy can enhance the contact time of the adsorbed dye molecules in the excited state S1 and thus reduce the unwanted charge recombination (dark current).

1. Introduction
After the pioneering work of O’Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1 the research on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) began to receive significant attention, which is still increasing at the present time.2 The conversion of sunlight into electricity is an important demand and a major challenge. Owing to low manufacturing costs, environmental safety, light weight, and variable processing techniques, metal-free organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials are highly promising. In particular, roll-to-roll printing shall be mentioned here as a modern technique.3–5
Many conjugated chromophores, which combine electron donor D and electron acceptor A building blocks, have been designed as sensitizers for DSSCs.2 The push–pull character of these molecules effectuates an intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) upon irradiation – a process which can be regarded as the initial step for the generation of an electrical current. Consequently, a large number of such dye structures have been studied: D–π–A, D–π–A–π–D, A–π–D–π–A, D–π–A–π–D–π–A–π–D, A–π–D–π–A–π–D–π–A, etc.2
In 2011, we designed (D–π–A)2L systems which contain independent double D–π–A branches.6 The linker L connects the two push–pull moieties. Chains or ring scaffolds with two or more σ-bonds serve for this purpose. Completely conjugated linkers L would connect the donor or the acceptor moieties and lead to DA2 or D2A systems. Exceptions can be expected for cross-conjugated linkers and/or for linkers which have strongly twisted π centers.7
2. Operational mode of DSSCs based on (D–π–A)2L dyes
The sensitizer is adsorbed on a nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2 film, which functions as a wide band gap semiconductor (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of a DSSC based on a (D–π–A)2L dye sensitizer. 
Carboxyl groups as anchor groups establish the adsorption. It is favorable that the anchor group is a part of the acceptor building block, because the electron transition (injection) from the dye into the conduction band (CB) of the semi-conductor takes place there.–CHC(CN)–COOHCyanoacrylic acid is the most often applied acceptor and anchor group A.2 An advantage of the double branched dyes (D–π–A)2L, compared to simple D–π–A sensitizers, is that the two acceptor parts enable a higher loading density of the chromophore on the TiO2 surface. Moreover, two anchor groups are expected to be more robust toward leaching.6

Scheme 1 shows the working mode of a solar cell sensitized by a (D–π–A)2L dye. Sunlight ranges from the near UV (UV-A), to the infrared (IR). Therefore, it is important to use dyes which have a broad and intense absorption. Due to the wide separation the interaction of the two chromophores is low. Compared to dyes which have a single chromophore of the same type, a small hypsochromic shift can be observed in many cases. This effect resembles that of ‘intramolecular’ H aggregates. The captured photons generate an excited singlet state of the sensitizer, whose charge transfer initiates the charge separation. Competitive processes such as radiationless deactivation (internal conversion IC) and the loss of fluorescence light to the environment of the device reduce the quantum yield for the formation of dye cations.2 An exothermic energy transfer within the excited dye molecule on the other hand is a specialty of double branched sensitizers which enhances the charge separation because the contact time of the excited dye molecule with the TiO2 surface is extended. A further advantage of (D–π–A)2L dyes compared to D–π–A dyes is due to the lower aggregation tendency. The aggregation of dye molecules can lead to self-quenching of the excited singlet states. Irreversible photoreactions of the dye have to be excluded as far as possible. Very slow photochemical degradations of the dye by UV light cannot always be avoided.2q

After the electron transfer to the anode the electroneutral dye molecule has to be recovered by the redox couple I−/I3− present in the electrolyte, which infiltrates the mesoporous TiO2. The external circuit guarantees the continuous regeneration of the dye and the redox couple. Direct or I3−/I− – mediated charge recombinations (dark current) will reduce the open-circuit voltage of the cell.
As an explicit example the phenothiazine compound 1 as sensitizer shall be discussed here.8  

Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectrum of 1 in solution and adsorbed on a TiO2 film.8
 Fig. 2  (a) UV/Vis absorption spectrum of phenothiazine 1 dissolved in CH2Cl2/CH3OH (1:1). (b) UV/Vis spectrum of 1 adsorbed on TiO2 (film). 
The interaction of the two chromophoric branches in 1 is relatively small – as the comparison to the corresponding mono-branched compound reveals.8 This statement is particularly valid for the broad absorption that is obtained in the measurement of films of 1. Polar solvents have a considerable influence on the charge transfer (CT) bands.

Fig. 3 shows the frontier orbitals of 1 obtained by a DFT calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G level.8 The HOMO is localized at the phenothiazine ring system as donor group D and the LUMO preferentially at the cyanoacrylic acid moiety as acceptor group A. Hence, the HOMO → LUMO transition is characterized by an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). It can be assumed that the basic conformation of 1 adsorbed on TiO2 corresponds to the calculated C1 conformation of the molecule in the gas phase. The excited charge transfer state S1 is also reached by higher electronic transitions S0 → Sn and subsequent internal conversion Sn → S1.
 Fig. 3  Schematic energy diagram for a DSSC based on sensitizer 1. 
The depicted energy levels of HOMO and LUMO were obtained by cyclovoltammetry and absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy (E0–0). Fig. 3 demonstrates that the charge injection into the CB of the semiconductor TiO2 and the regeneration process (dye cation → dye) are exergonic processes – even though small activation barriers exist.8
DSSCs are conventionally investigated or at least related to simulator conditions of sunlight (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The quantum efficiency of a DSSC in % can be defined as the number of electrons generated per 100 absorbed photons. It is expressed by the incident photon-to-current efficiency IPCE, which depends on the wavelength and is therefore related to the UV/Vis spectrum of the film.
The overall efficiency of the DSSC triggered by 1 as sensitizer is depicted in Fig. 4, which shows the J–V curve.8 The short-circuit current JSC is obtained for V = 0 and the open circuit voltage VOC for JSC = 0. This leads together with the fill factor FF = 0.66 and the solar photon flux I0 to the photovoltaic performance.8 The solar-to-electric power conversion amounts toη = JSC·VOC·FF·I0−1 = 6.14%
 Fig. 4  
J–V curve of the DSSC based on sensitizer 1. (The working area of the DSSC amounted to a 0.16 cm2 TiO2 layer which contained a dye load density of 8.12 × 10−7 mol cm−2. The chromophore density is twice as high.) 
The results of intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) gave a lifetime of 200.3 ms.8 This long lifetime and the high recombination resistance of 166.9 Ω obtained from the Nyquist plot confirmed that the DSSC based on 1 has a low dark current.8
3. Modification of the sensitizer structures (D–A)2L
A large variety of double D–A branched dyes, which bear σ-bond connections L, has been studied. Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters of 10H-phenothiazin-3-yl-(2E)-2-cyanoacrylic acids 1–9 with different linkers L between 10-N and 10′-N. The compounds 2–6 contain alkylene linkers of different length.6,9 The overall performance of the devices with long linkers is better than that of the systems with short linkers. The long chains provide an efficient shielding effect to retard charge recombination.9 Moreover, the examples 2 and 3 reveal that slightly different devices can lead to very different η values for the same sensitizer.6,9

The sensitizers 8, 9 and 1 have ortho-, meta- or para-phenylene segments in the center of their linkers.8 As in the series 2–6 it can be assumed that the average distance from the donor to the acceptor/anchor groups of the adsorbed dyes increases with increasing linker length. Consequently the dye load amounts decrease from 2 to 6 and from 8 to 9 and further to 1. However, the decreasing dark currents in these series have the opposite effect and prevail, so that altogether the η values increase.  

Table 2 contains the dyes 10–13, which bear the same donor and acceptor groups as the compounds 1–9, but the conjugation length of the branches is much longer. The sensitizers 10 and 11 contain benzotriazole units in the conjugated branches. A hexamethylene chain connects the donor groups of 10 and the π segments of 11. In comparison with the PCE (4.32%) of the DSSC based on the single D–π–A branched analogue dye SB-B, the PCE (6.13%) of the DSSC with sensitizer 10 is enhanced by about 42%. Dye 11 has an even lower PCE than SB-B, which is due to its higher aggregation tendency.10 However, the η value of 11 can be dramatically increased by addition of chenodeoxycholic acid as co-adsorbent.10

The sensitizers 12 and 13 contain bipolar boradiazaindacene (BODIPY) building blocks in their conjugated segments. Dye 12 obtains a better DSSC performance than the corresponding single-branch dye UY2. The more extended conjugation realized in 13 gives superior η values.11
The dye loading amounts of dyes 10, SB-B, 12 and UY2 are 2.58 × 10−7, 3.83 × 10−7, 1.74 × 10−7 and 1.83 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. Although the adsorption amounts of 10 and 12 are slightly lower than their corresponding single-branch dyes, the number of light-harvesting units of the double D–π–A branched dyes is higher than that of the single D–π–A branched molecules (for example, 2 × 2.58 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for 10). Thus, compared with single branched dyes, a larger number of light-harvesting units is one significant advantage of the double branched dyes.  

Table 3 compiles the photovoltaic data of the compounds 14–18 which contain again cyanoacrylic acid as acceptor/anchor group, but donor units other than phenothiazine. The phenoxazine dye 14 is closely related to the phenothiazine 3. Compound 15, a dye with two different branches, gives a high PCE in contrast to the indole systems 16–18, which have very low short circuit currents JSC based on inferior donor properties.

Table 4 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters of the compounds 19–21, which contain tertiary amines as donor group and cyanoacrylic acid and/or rhodamine-3-acetic acid as acceptor and anchor group.14 Dye 20 with different acceptors achieves the highest PCE among the three dyes. This is another intramolecular co-sensitization strategy to enhance the optical response and photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.

Table 5 contains (D–π–A)2L dyes 22–26, which bear triphenylamine as donor D, cyanoacrylic acid as acceptor A and linkers L, which connect the π segments by saturated chain/ring building blocks. The PCE values of 22–25 are high and show a maximum of 8.10% for 23.16 It is interesting to note that the position of the long σ-chain CH2O–(CH2)8–OCH2 between the 1,4-dioxin rings of the linker in 23–25 has a strong influence on the PCE. The calix[4]arene system 26 has a relatively low η value, which cannot be improved by a co-adsorbent.17

The dyes 27–29 (Table 6) are a particular kind of double D–π–A branched organic sensitizers, where the linker is a single sp3-hybridized carbon atom which exhibits a spiro configuration. They represent spiro-compounds, which bear tertiary amines as donor D and cyanoacrylic acid as acceptor/anchor unit A. The three dyes obtain power conversion efficiencies from 3.75% to 6.02%. The bridging of two chromophores via an sp3-hybridized carbon atom into a spiro configuration allows the constituted π-systems to retain their individual electronic properties. In addition, their peculiar cross-shaped rigid structure with two perpendicularly oriented molecular halves improves their morphological stability in the solid state and reduces their tendency to form aggregates thanks to the inhibition of intermolecular interactions. Spiro compounds also have higher solubility with respect to the corresponding nonspiro-linked parent compounds.18–20

All of the discussed double-branched sensitizers 1–29 gave a better DSSC performance than the corresponding single-branch dyes. This important feature of (D–π–A)2L dyes shall be demonstrated here in detail by the comparison of the asymmetric compound 15 and its components 30 and 31.13Fig. 5 shows the IPCE spectra of 15, 30, 31 and an equimolar mixture of 30 and 31. The performance of the DSSCs based on these dyes increases significantly in the order η (30) < η (31) < η (30 + 31) < η (15). Since the VOC and the FF proved to be very similar for all four systems, the effect must result mainly from the increase of the short-circuit currents, which is demonstrated in Fig. 6: JSC (30) < JSC (31) < JSC (30 + 31) < JSC (15).

 Fig. 6  
J–V curves of DSSCs sensitized by 30, 31, 30 + 31 (1:1) and 15. 
Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 32) as a co-adsorbent can enhance the performance of a DSSC, because it can hamper the aggregation of the sensitizer on the TiO2 surface.21 However, when the aggregation tendency is low, the reduction of the dye loading can prevail and η is decreased. An improvement of the PCE was found for example for the sensitizers 10,101110 and 14.12 The moderate η value of 3.65% for 11 can be increased to 5.88% when 1 mM CDCA is added. When 10 mM CDCA is added, the η value decreases again to 5.79%. Obviously a compromise between the reduction of dye aggregation and the covering of the TiO2 surface by CDCA has to be found.  
4. Conclusion

Tables 1–6 contain the photovoltaic parameters of different types of sensitizers (D–π–A)2L, in which two conjugated donor–acceptor chromophores D–π–A are connected by a chain or a ring scaffold of σ-bonds. The solar-to-electric power conversion of the corresponding DSSCs varies between η = 1.1 and 8.1%. A comparison between different dyes measured in different devices can only roughly be drawn; however, in all discussed cases the double branched sensitizers (D–π–A)2L are superior to the corresponding single branched systems D–π–A. The quality of a specific sensitizer can be reliably established when its PCE is related to a commercial standard such as N719 (33), which is studied under the same conditions in the same device.6
The double branched dyes (D–π–A)2L have the following advantages compared to D–π–A dyes: The σ-scaffold of the double branched sensitizers 1–29 impedes the unfavorable dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface. The molar amount of the dye loading density d for (D–π–A)2L is normally somewhat smaller than the density d′ for the corresponding dye D–π–A, but the chromophore density 2d is higher than d′. The contact time of the double branched dyes in the electronically excited state on the surface of the semiconductor is extended by a possible exothermic intramolecular energy transfer. Two anchor groups connected to the two acceptor molecules guarantee a better fixing on the TiO2 surface.
Independent D–π–A functionalities are realized by a chain of σ bonds or by a perpendicular arrangement in spiro compounds.
The major advantages of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) compared to silicon-based solar cells consist in lower manufacturing costs, lower weight and variable processing techniques. These advantages can be further enhanced by the development of new electrode materials.22,23
The thermal and photochemical stability, in particular the long-term stability of most sensitizers of the type (D–π–A)2L in air, has still to be investigated.
