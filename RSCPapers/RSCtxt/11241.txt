    , Accepted 22nd August 2016First published on 22nd August 2016AbstractMonodisperse β-NaYF4:Ln3+ (Ln = Yb/Er, Yb/Tm) upconversion nanocrystals have been fast synthesized using layered yttrium hydroxide Y2(OH)5NO3·nH2O (LYH) via a topotactic transformation route bypassing the α-NaYF4 intermediate phase. It was found that the topotactic structural matching of [001]LYH//[0001]β-NaYF4 facilitated the direct formation of β-NaYF4, wherein the kinetic α-NaYF4 intermediate phase could be avoided at the initial reaction stage. Besides, the morphology could be effectively tuned by manipulating the NaF/Y(NO3)3 feeding ratio. In addition, the upconversion luminescence properties of the as-prepared β-NaYF4:15%Yb3+/2%Er3+ and β-NaYF4:15%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ were also systematically investigated.
Introduction
Upconversion (UC) has attracted increasing attention due to the unique process that converts long-wavelength excitation radiation into shorter wavelength output radiation since its recognition in the middle 1960s.1–4 It has potential applications in solid-state lasers, solar cells, sensors, and even in bioimaging and photodynamic therapy because of its higher photochemical stability, deeper penetration depth, low toxicity, and little background auto-fluorescence.5–9 For upconversion luminescence, an ideal host needs high tolerance for luminescent centers, low phonon energy to minimize nonradiative relaxation, high transparency for free NIR photons, and good chemical and thermal stability.10–12 Therefore, among various host candidates, β-NaYF4 has been proven to be one of the most efficient host matrixes for upconversion luminescence, and considerable progress has been made in its controllable synthesis, optical property optimization, and application with the rapid development of nanotechnology.13 Over the past decade, different kinds of wet synthetic routes have been developed; notable cases include hydro/solvothermal and co-thermolysis methods, and various high-quality β-NaYF4 upconversion nanocrystals with different sizes and shapes were achieved.14 Li and Yan's groups fabricated β-NaYF4 nanocrystals with fine size and shape control by solvothermal and co-thermolysis methods.15,16 Hu's group successfully synthesized multifunctional NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@polypyrrole core–shell nanoplates via thermal decomposition reaction followed by chemical oxidative polymerization reaction.17 It is well-established that NaYF4 has two phases: cubic (α) and hexagonal (β) phases;18 the cubic phase is high-temperature metastable, while the hexagonal phase is thermodynamically stable. It is reported that Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped β-NaYF4 NCs offered about an order-of-magnitude enhancement of UC efficiency compared with their α phase counterpart, thus β-NaYF4 had been attracting more attention.19 Meanwhile, α-NaYF4 was preferentially formed, driven by a kinetic effect at the initial reaction stage, and gradually transformed into the β-NaYF4 phase.20 However, the phase transformation process often needs a long aging time and a high reaction temperature,21 which lead to particle growth and aggregation. Hence, it remains a challenge to directly synthesize monodisperse β-NaYF4 NCs bypassing the α → β phase process by a green and facile synthetic method.
An ideal way to directly synthesize β-NaYF4 is by artificial avoidance of the α-NaYF4 phase at the initial growth stage. Su and Zhao's groups have successfully synthesized β-NaYF4 NCs by ion exchange methods using Y(OH)xF3−x and Y(OH)3 as precursors due to the structural similarity between the precursors and β-NaYF4.22,23 However, the stringent precondition of structural similarity restricts the practical extension of the ion-exchange route; thus seeking an ideal precursor with tolerant structural similarity to β-NaYF4 is advantageous. Furthermore, conventional wet routes including sol–gel,24 solid-state reaction,25 solvothermal,26 and co-thermolysis27 usually suffer from considerable time consumption, tedious experimental procedures, excessive expense, or high environmental load,28–30 which are unfavorable to the green chemistry concept. Therefore, it is of great academic and practical significance to directly synthesize β-NaYF4 by a green wet method.
In this work, we developed a novel strategy for the direct synthesis of monodisperse β-NaYF4 NCs via a topotactic transformation route on the basis of the topotactic structural matching of [001]LYH//[0001]β-NaYF4, wherein the kinetic α-NaYF4 intermediate phase could be avoided at the initial reaction stage. The as-prepared products were high-quality NCs with well-defined morphology which could be effectively tuned by manipulating the NaF/Y(NO3)3 feeding ratio. To the best of our knowledge, there are hardly any reports about the topotactic transformation synthetic methodology towards nanostructures on the basis of the topotactic structural matching. Besides, the upconversion luminescence properties of Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped β-NaYF4 NCs were also investigated.
Experimental section
Materials
Ln(NO3)3 (Ln: Y, Yb, Er and Tm) aqueous solution was obtained by dissolving Ln2O3 (Ln = Y, Yb, Er, and Tm (99.99%)) in dilute HNO3 under heating with agitation. NH3·H2O (25%) and NaF were purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent Co. All the other chemicals were of analytical grade and used without any purification.
Synthesis of Y2(OH)5NO3·1.4H2O precursors
In a typical procedure, Y(NO3)3 (1 mL, 1M) aqueous solution was added into 30 ml of deionized water, and NH3·H2O (25%) was added dropwise into the solution to adjust the pH value to 8. After stirring vigorously for 10 min, the mixture was transferred to a 50 ml autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. After that, a white precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water two times. The other Ln3+-doped precursors were synthesized following the same procedure, using Ln(NO3)3 (Ln = Yb, Er, and Tm) in variable amounts at the initial stage.
Synthesis of β-NaYF4 nanocrystals
The as-prepared white precipitate was dispersed into 10 ml of deionized water, and 25 mL of solution containing 20 mmol of NaF (0.857 g) was added into the above mixture under magnetic stirring. After magnetic stirring for 10 min, the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. As the autoclave cooled to ambient temperature, the products were collected and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol three times in sequence and finally dried at 60 °C in air for 12 h.
Characterization
The phase structure and purity of the as-prepared samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction with a D8 Focus diffractometer (Bruker). The size and morphology were investigated by using a field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDX) (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) micrographs were obtained by using a JEOL-2010 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was conducted on a thermal analysis instrument (SDT2960, DE, New Castle) in an air flow of 100 mL min−1 at 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 900 °C. The upconversion emission spectra were obtained using a 980 nm laser from an OPO (optical parametric oscillator, Continuum Sunlite, USA) as the excitation source and detected from 400 to 720 nm. All the measurements except thermogravimetric analysis were performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Phase and morphology

Fig. 1 displays the SEM image (Fig. 1a) and the XRD pattern (Fig. 1b) of the precursor. It is shown that it is composed of hexagonal sheets with an average size of 250 nm, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The corresponding XRD pattern can be assigned to the layered yttrium hydroxide Y2(OH)5NO3·nH2O (Fig. 1b) without any additional impurity. The EDX spectrum confirms the presence of Y, N, and O elements in the as-prepared precursor. Fig. 1d shows the TG curve of the precursor in the temperature range of 20–900 °C. The precursor contains a total weight loss of 36.4% in four steps, which is consistent with the layered yttrium hydroxide. The first weight loss before 50 °C originates from the removal of absorbed water on the surface. Between 50 and 180 °C, the weight loss of 7.5% comes from the coordinated water within the unit layer, which can be calculated from the loss of 1.4 moles of water molecules per chemical formula unit. In the temperature range of 180–300 °C, the subsequent sharp weight loss of 8.4% can be attributed to the release of water from the dehydroxylation of the hydroxide layers. The final step starting from 300 °C is assigned to the further decomposition of the compound, yielding Y2O3 as a residual product. Therefore, on the basis of elemental analysis, the chemical formula of the precursor sample can be estimated to be Y2(OH)5(NO3)·1.4H2O.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the final product; the diffraction peaks agree well with those of hexagonal NaYF4 (JCPDS no. 16-0334, P63/m space group with lattice constants a = b = 5.96 Å, and c = 3.53 Å) with high purity. The SEM image (Fig. 2b) reveals that the product is composed of monodisperse hexagonal prisms with well-defined shape and smooth crystal surface. The average length is about 200 nm and the diameter is 130 nm. A close-up observation shows that the two ends of the prism are enclosed by a hexagonal pyramid. Furthermore, the bundle imprint on some prisms suggests that the hexagonal prism may have evolved from a bundle structure assembled by nanorod building blocks. The TEM image further exhibits the geometric feature of the hexagonal prism (Fig. 2c). The HRTEM image of the marked area on an individual particle (Fig. 2d) shows well-resolved 2D lattice fringes, indicating the single-crystalline nature.

The mutual perpendicular planes with interplanar spacings of 0.30 nm and 0.348 nm correspond to the {110} and {001} lattice planes, which suggests that the hexagonal prism grows along the [001] direction. On the basis of the above HRTEM analysis and the symmetry of the hexagonal crystal structure, it can be concluded that the hexagonal prism is enclosed by six {100} lattice planes on the side face and two {001} lattice planes on the two ends.
Generally, the synthetic parameters have a profound impact on the morphology and size. In this work, the morphology and size of the product showed a distinct evolution trend when the NaF/Y(NO3)3 feeding ratio was varied. The aspect ratio of the product showed a gradual decrease as the NaF/Y(NO3)3 feeding ratio increased, as shown in Fig. 3. It could be observed that with low feeding ratios of NaF/Y(NO3)3, the products turned out to be gracile hexagonal prisms (a length of 280 nm). When the feeding ratio of NaF/Y(NO3)3 was increased to a high value, podgy hexagonal prisms were obtained, and the size decreased to 200 nm. However, the aspect ratio showed a negligible change at a relatively higher NaF concentration. A close-up observation suggested that the podgy hexagonal prism evolved from the hexagonal bundle structure assembled by fine nanorods via sharing side faces. Thus, it could be concluded that an increase in NaF/Y(NO3)3 feeding ratio led to a decrease in crystal size, and it also induced an assembly behavior for the prism unit blocks. It is well established that the critical radius (rc) of nuclei is dependent on the saturation ratio (S),31 which can be expressed as: Fig. 3  SEM images of the as-prepared β-NaYF4 samples with NaF/Y(NO3)3 feeding ratios of (a) 4/1, (b) 8/1, (c) 12/1, and (d) 25/1. rc = 2γVm/RTlnSwhere γ is the surface free energy per unit area (g > 0) and Vm is the molar volume of the bulk crystal. An increase of S leads to a decrease of rc, and a smaller rc would give rise to a smaller crystalline size of the final products after the same growth process. In the synthesis, a higher S value of F− led to a higher monomer concentration of β-NaYF4 after the chemical transformation process, which gave rise to a smaller crystal size for β-NaYF4.
Besides, it has been reported that some inorganic ions have a profound influence on the growth kinetics and thermodynamics in nanocrystal synthesis. In our wet synthesis free of any organic solvents or surfactants, the excessive F− and Na+ ions played an important role in size and morphology control. During the synthesis, the excessive F− ions would be absorbed onto the facets of the newly formed β-NaYF4 nanocrystals by the electrostatic force, which suppressed the further growth and simultaneously protected the particles from aggregation. Our synthesis may provide a case for facile control of the size and morphology of inorganic nanocrystals by using inorganic ions.
The topological transformation mechanism
To shed light on the chemical transformation from LYH to β-NaYF4, the phase and morphological evolution at different reaction intervals were monitored by XRD and SEM. It was found that the growth rate was so fast that β-NaYF4 was already formed within 5 min at 180 °C. The corresponding XRD profiles (Fig. 4d) showed the coexistence of β-NaYF4 and LYH, and no α-NaYF4 phase was detected, indicating a possibility of a new growth mechanism. The SEM image showed that the products were composed of large amounts of destroyed hexagonal sheet fragments and some nanoparticles (Fig. 4a). In order to further verify the chemical transformation process at five minutes, the elemental mapping images were utilized to analyze the elemental composition of the as-prepared destroyed hexagonal sheet fragments. As shown in Fig. 5, the mapping images showed the presence of Y, Na, O, F, and N elements, which strongly indicated the ion-exchange reaction. When the reaction time was continuously prolonged to 10 min, the hexagonal nanosheets were consumed, the particles got bigger, and the shape of the hexagonal prism became more distinct, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. It is worth noting that most quasi hexagonal prisms were hexagonal bundles assembled by smaller nanorods. After 20 min, nearly monodisperse hexagonal prisms with a length of 225 nm were obtained, and the nanosheets were completely consumed. The corresponding XRD pattern showed the single-phase β-NaYF4.

On the basis of the time-dependent phase evolution without the emergence of the α-NaYF4 intermediate phase, it is clear that the formation of β-NaYF4 nanocrystals takes a new growth mechanism. In our synthesis, LYH was used as a precursor, and it might play a role as a structural template for the direct formation of the β-NaYF4 phase. Layered rare-earth hydroxides with the formula Ln2(OH)5NO3·1.4H2O (LRHs) are newly emerged anion exchange host lattices with the capacity for intercalation and ion exchange. Structurally, they are built up of positively charged unit layers along the [001] direction and charge-balancing anions in the interlayer gallery. Such unique structural anisotropy endows LRHs with an interesting behavior of exfoliating into unit layers. It is reported that the unique layered structure can be viewed as a superlattice consisting of a fundamental hexagonal cell and a rectangular supercell. The fundamental hexagonal cell in pseudohexagonal symmetry indicates a hexagonal arrangement of rare earth atoms on the LRH unit layers. It is well-established that β-NaYF4 possesses an anisotropic crystal structure with hexagonal symmetry along the c-axis, which leads to a hexagonal arrangement of rare earth atoms on the {0001} lattice plane. Thus, the similar arrangement of rare earth atoms between the LYH unit layer and the β-NaYF4 {0001} lattice plane makes topotactic transformation from LRHs to β-NaYF4via [001]LYH//[0001]β-NaYF4 possible.
Besides the resemblance in atomic arrangement, the coordination environment of the rare earth ion sites between the two crystal structures is very similar (Fig. 6). In the LYH unit layer, there are three types of sites for the rare earth ions, one YO8 site and two YO9 sites. The first YO8 type is coordinated by seven OH− and one H2O, forming a distorted YO8 dodecahedron; while the other two YO9 types are coordinated by eight OH− and one H2O, forming a YO9 mono-capped square antiprism. For β-NaYF4, there are two types of sites for the rare earth ions, a one-fold site for Y3+ (1a), and another one-fold site for Na+ and Y3+ (1f). Both types are coordinated by nine F− ions, forming an YF9 trigonal prism with each vertical face bearing a pyramid. Intuitively, the YO9 polyhedron can be viewed as a slightly distorted YF9 polyhedron, while the YO8 polyhedron can also be geometrically regarded as a quasi-YF9 polyhedron. Besides, the distance of the Y–F bond (2.225–2.318 Å) is similar to that of the Y–O bond (HO⋯Y is 2.1–2.6 Å and H2O⋯Y is 2.48 Å), which favors the ease of transformation from YO9 and YO8 to the YF9 polyhedron via an ion-exchange process. Furthermore, the LRH unit layer with atomic thickness can act as an ideal structural template, because the simultaneous chemical transformation on the 2D platform would greatly reduce the energy barrier. Thus, it can be inferred from the experimental evidence and structural analysis that the highly topotactic structural matching and the unique layered structure of LYH facilitate the transformation from LYH to β-NaYF4.
 Fig. 6  Schematic illustration of the topological transformation growth mechanism. 
Upon introduction of NaF, OH− and coordinated H2O will be replaced by F− ions on the LYH unit layer at the 2D level, and some of the Y3+ ions are replaced by Na+ ions, leading to the formation of the β-NaYF4 {0001} lattice plane. Then, the β-NaYF4 {0001} monolayer building blocks self assemble into bulk nanocrystals along the [0001] direction. Such novel topotactic transformation growth behavior may be the key point for the direct formation of β-NaYF4 bypassing the α-NaYF4 counterpart, which is also responsible for the fast reaction. In this topotactic transformation process, some Y3+ ions were substituted by Na+ ions, and we evaluated that the yield ratio of β-NaYF4 was 76.63%. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first case of fast formation of the β-NaYF4 phase within several minutes. Our topotactic transformation synthetic route may provide some guidance for a green synthetic methodology of inorganic nanomaterials.
UC luminescence properties
Upconversion luminescence is a typical nonlinear optical phenomenon in which successive absorption of two or more photons leads to high-energy photons via a long-lived intermediate state.32 As aforementioned, β-NaYF4 has been proven to be one of the most efficient upconversion host lattices, and Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Tm3+ were often selected as sensitizer/activator systems wherein the energy transfer UC mechanism was involved. Fig. 7 shows the upconversion emission spectra of the NaYF4:15%Yb3+/2%Er3+ and β-NaYF4:15%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ samples under 980 nm NIR laser excitation. For NaYF4:15%Yb3+/2%Er3+, it contains intense green emission bands (510–535 and 535–560 nm) and a comparative red emission band (640–680 nm). The three primary bands with maximum at 521, 542, and 655 nm can be explicitly ascribed to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+ ions, respectively. For the β-NaYF4:15%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ sample, the spectrum is dominated by a relatively strong blue emission band (465–485 nm) with a weak red emission band (640–655 nm) and near infrared emission band (770–830 nm). The three emission bands centered at 477, 646 and 698 nm can be attributed to the 1G4 → 3H6, 1G4 → 3F4, and 3F3 → 3H6 transitions of Tm3+. To shed light on the UC mechanism, the dependence of the UC emission intensity (Iup) on the pump laser intensity (P) was measured (Fig. 8). Here, NaYF4:15%Yb3+,2%Er3+ was selected as a representative. It is well-established that the relationship between Iup and P can be described by the formula Iup ∝ Pn. For the unsaturated upconversion process, n is the number of pump photons involved in the UC processes. As shown in Fig. 8, the I–P logarithmic curves of emission intensity versus laser intensity were plotted and the slopes (n values) were determined to be 1.652, 1.772, and 1.650 for 542, 521, and 655 nm emission, respectively. This result reveals that population of the 4S3/2, 2H11/2, and 4F9/2 levels is a two-photon process. The experimental observations agree with previous reports.33 Our novel synthesis case may provide a new insight into the synthetic pathway for nanostructures via internal topotactic structural conversion.

Conclusion
In summary, we have described a novel direct and fast synthetic route towards monodisperse β-NaYF4:Ln3+ (Ln = Yb/Er, Yb/Tm) upconversion nanocrystals using layered yttrium hydroxide (LYH) without any capping agents or organic solvents. It was found that the topotactic structural matching of [001]LYH//[0001]β-NaYF4 and the unique layered structure of LYH facilitated the direct and fast formation of β-NaYF4, wherein the kinetic α-NaYF4 intermediate phase could be avoided at the initial reaction stage. Besides, the morphology can be effectively tuned by manipulating the NaF/Y(NO3)3 feeding ratio. In addition, the upconversion luminescence properties of the as-prepared β-NaYF4:15%Yb3+/2%Er3+ and β-NaYF4:15%Yb3+/1%Tm3+ were also systematically investigated.
