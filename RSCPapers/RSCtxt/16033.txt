    , Accepted 26th November 2022First published on 30th November 2022AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) materials have triggered broad interest owing to their unique physical and chemical properties that have pioneering applications in electronic and optical devices. In this study, a group of quaternary chalcogenide 2D-layered ACu2BS3 (A = K, Na; B = Bi, Sb) compounds are investigated using ab initio density functional theory calculations. The first-principles calculations are computed by generalised gradient approximation (GGA), such as Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functions, with the incorporation of spin–orbit coupling (SOC). The structural, electronic, and optical properties are investigated systematically, revealing that all these compounds exhibit direct band gap nature. However, the inclusion of SOC in KCu2BiS3 (KCBS) and NaCu2BiS3 (NCBS) compounds results in an indirect band gap. The change in the band gap from direct to indirect arises with the effective splitting of Bi-p and S-p states in the conduction band (CB) offset. The novel alkali-metal Na+ compounds, NaCu2BiS3 (NCBS) and NaCu2SbS3 (NCSS), exhibit better structural, electronic, and optical properties than the existing K+, KCu2BiS3 (KCBS) and KCu2SbS3 (KCSS) compounds. Thus, gaining theoretical insights into novel 2D materials paves the way for the synthesis and fabrication of photovoltaic cells (PVC) in the future.
Introduction
The future of the 21st century's modern civilisation seems bleak with its massive dependency on fossil fuels. Finding efficient renewable energy materials is of utmost concern to counter the menaces of global warming and to comply with growing energy demands. The utility of producing electricity from sunlight with the advancement of photovoltaic cells (PVC) has exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE), making it an alternative to ousting fossil fuels forever.1,2 Over the past decades, silicon photovoltaics (PV) with a PCE of 24.7% may depend on the cost per watt of electricity generated. However, it is noteworthy to identify the factors that can reduce the cost per watt and increase the ability of watt per gram. A means to achieve this is by reducing the thickness of the absorber layer. Unfortunately, when the thickness of the absorber layer in monocrystalline silicon solar cells is reduced, its photon-absorption capacity also decreases and does not yield decent data in the Shockley-Quisser limit.3 Therefore, lowering absorber thickness in silicon solar cells limits efficiency enhancement. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted immense interest since the discovery of graphene in 2004.4 Graphene has outstanding multifaceted electronic, optical, thermal, and mechanical properties. These properties include quantum-hall effect (QHE),5 ambipolar electric field effect,6 Dirac fermions,7 thermal conductivity (∼4000 Wm−1 K−1),8,9 Seebeck coefficient, and figure of merit, which has the advantage of converting electrical energy to heat.10 Along with this, it has an excellent fracture strength (130 GPa),11 high carrier mobility, and optical transparency with an ultra-region absorption spectrum.12 Owing to its functional properties, graphene has numerous advantages in energy storage systems,13 photocatalysis,14 and spintronic devices.15 Though these applications sound impressive, their zero-band gap nature restricts possible applications of graphene in PV. Many vital parameters, such as suitable band gap (0.3–1.3 eV) matching the solar light spectrum, significant absorption coefficient, high career mobility, career lifetime, and appropriate p-type and n-type doping, affect the efficiency of PV.16 Therefore, a vigorous search for versatile non-graphene 2D materials with promising applications in PV is still being pursued.
Over the past few decades, quaternary chalcogenide layered (QCL) materials with diverse applications have become a notable subject of research owing to their interesting electronic and optical properties as compared with existing 2D materials. For instance, the 2D layered material of CsCu3SbS4 from the QCL group suggests a promising birefringent material.17 Another classic example in this regard is [Ed·H2]0.5Cu2SbS3·H2O (Ed = ethylenediamine). It is useful for the decontamination of Ag+ ions via electrostatic interaction from the surface of the materials.18 Similarly, the 2D compounds, K2Cd3X4 (X = S, Se, and Te), reveal potential applications in thermoelectric materials.19 In addition, layered K2Cu3AlS4 shows high thermal stability for up to 550 °C and so on.20 KCu2(Sb/Bi)S3 compounds from the QCL family attract greater interest as they obey the minimum required functional properties suitable for the PVC. These 2D layered materials exist in a triclinic structure with a space group, P (No. 2). The structure comprises anionic layers of [Cu2(Sb/Bi)S3]− with intercalated K+ ions. In [Cu2(Sb/Bi)S3]− layers, Cu acts as a central atom occupying trigonal planar sites with (Bi/Sb)S33−. Each layer is almost similar to a graphene planar sheet-like structure composed of Cu–S and Cu–(Sb/Bi) bonds. The theoretically predicted band gap of KCu2SbS3 obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) potential shows a value between (1.13–1.37 eV), corroborating the experimental findings (1.53–1.7 eV);21,22 however, the important optical properties of this compound are not elaborated in reported studies. Similarly, the experimental band gap of KCu2BiS3 was 1.29 eV, and no other published theoretical studies on this system have been observed so far.16 PBE potential from previous reports has already proved that KCu2(Sb/Bi)S3 exhibits a band gap consistent with the experimental values, which may not require any further calculations. However, incorporating spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in complex systems is essential to achieve an accurate band, which is missing in the existing literature.23 The strategy in novel materials design is to introduce Na+ instead of K+ as the “electronegativity of Na+ (0.93) is greater than that of K+ (0.82) ions”, which tends to attract the shared pair of anionic layers of [Cu2(Sb/Bi)S3]−. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to deal with the detailed systematic investigation of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of ACu2BS3 (A = K, Na; B = Sb, Bi) using PBE potential with and without the inclusion of SOC.
As expected, being an alkali-metal, K+ ions intercalated between the anionic layer play a central role in enhancing the electronic and optical properties when they are replaced with Na+ ions. Therefore, our theoretical analyses suggest that the structural, electronic, and optical properties of KCBS and KCSS compounds match well with experimental outcomes. The DFT calculations reveal that the novel NaCu2BiS3 (NCBS) and NaCu2SbS3 (NCSS) compounds can present an improved electronic and optical response than the existing KCBS and KCSS compounds. They can also have the potential to be considered for future experimental synthesis routes with promising applications in optoelectronics.
Computational methodology
In this study, all the DFT calculations were computed using the ab initio simulation QUANTUM ESPRESSO package.24 The exchange–correlation function was treated using PBE approximation with the incorporation of SOC. The electronic interactions were executed via ultrasoft pseudopotential using the valence configurations of K (3s, 4s, 3p, 4p); Na (2s, 2p, 3s); Cu (3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p); Sb (4d, 5s, 5p); Bi (5d, 6s, 6p); and S (3s, 3p). The Brillouin zone (BZ) was sampled with the Monkhorst pack technique using 6 × 4 × 4 and 8 × 6 × 6 k-point meshes to optimise the QCL structure. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm was employed by maintaining the total energy set to 10−6 Ry between the consecutive self-consistent cycles and Hellmann Feynman forces up to 10−5 Ry bohr−1. These settings were aimed to achieve relaxed atomic positions, lattice parameters, and space group information.
The total Hamiltonian principle was treated as a sum of the Kohn–Sham equation along with its potential SOC Hamiltonian function, which was derived from the nonrelativistic potential to the Dirac equation as follows;23,25 Ĥnet = ni + ext + el + Vexc + ĤS–O(1) (2)In eqn (1), ni, ext, el, Vexc, and ĤS–O are the kinetic energy function, external potential function, Hartree/exchange potential function, exchange–correlation energy, and the SOC operator, respectively. Similarly, in eqn (2), me, c*, , e, , V, and  are the mass of the electron, velocity of light, momentum function, charge of electron, Pauli's matrices, potential energy of an electron, and special gradient, respectively.
The optical properties of all four QCL compounds were determined by using both the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric functions. The real part, ε1(ω), is described by the amount of scattering light, whereas the imaginary part ε2(ω) gives the absorption capacity of the incident light produced from the electromagnetic radiation.23,26,27 The real and imaginary parts are the crucial optical parameters for potential applications in PVC. The dielectric function, ε(ω), is the sum of the optical linear response of the real part, ε1(ω), and the imaginary part, ε2(ω), of the dielectric function, which is given as:28–30 ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω)(3)In eqn (3), the imaginary part, ε2(ω), is determined as the electronic transition takes place from the occupied states to an unoccupied energy state in the electronic band structure. This transition is represented as:27 (4)where Pβmn = |〈β,m|·|β,n〉|2(5)|β,m〉, |β,n〉, Γ, , and δ are the valence band wavefunction, conduction band (CB) wavefunction, volume of the unit cell, polarisation of the electromagnetic field, position vector of the electromagnetic radiation, and critical points used in the calculations, respectively. Therefore, from the Kramers–Kronig transformations, the real part of the dielectric function is expressed as:27 (6)By knowing both the real part and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, the absorption coefficient can be calculated using the following equation:23 (7)
Results and discussion
Structural and electronic properties
Herein we focus on the structural and electronic properties of ACu2BS3 (A = K, Na; B = Bi, Sb) QCL 2D materials. The exchange–correlation functions using PBE potential are incorporated with the inclusion of SOC and are discussed via a comparative study. Fig. 1(a–d) shows the crystal structure of all the ACu2BS3 QCL 2D compounds. The crystallographic structural parameters, bond lengths, and cartesian coordinates of QCL 2D compounds are indexed in Table 1. The structural parameters indexed in Table 1 confirm the triclinic structure with a space group P (No. 2), which is consistent with the available literature.16,21,22 The cartesian coordinate unit of ACu2BS3 (A = K, Na; B = Bi, Sb) is made of fourteen crystallographic sites occupying 2-(K/Na), 4-Cu, 2-(Sb/Bi) and 6-S sites. Among all, Cu acts as a central atom by forming a tetrahedral structure composed of Cu–S and Cu–(Sb/Bi) bonds. In the crystal structure shown in Fig. 1(a–d), the alkali metals, K+ and Na+ ions, are sandwiched between the adjacent layers of (Bi/Sb)Cu2S3, which have complex Cu atoms and are interconnected with BiS33− groups. The band structures of ACu2BS3 QCL compounds are presented in Fig. 2a–d. The exchange correlations functions are treated with PBE potential with and without the incorporation of SOC. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maxima (VBM) are located at “X” in all the compounds. From electronic band structures, the estimated band gap using PBE potential is 1.10 and 1.36 eV for KCBS and KCSS compounds, respectively, which is consistent with the reported literature. Interestingly, with the replacement of the atom of the alkali metal, K+, with the Na+ atom, the band gap increased from 1.16 to 1.69 eV in the NCBS and NCSS. The effective SOC is important to calculate the accurate band gap, especially in complex 2D QCL compounds, which is missing in the published literature.16,21,22 The inclusion of SOC in KCSS and NCSS compounds results in a reduction in the band gap due to the combined effective splitting of Sb-p and S-p states in the CB offset. In the case of KCBS and NCBS compounds, the reduction in band gap arises with an effective splitting of Bi-p and S-p states in the CB offset. The calculated band gap using SOC results in 0.9, 1.3, 1, and 1.62 eV for KCBS, KCSS, NCBS, and NCSS, respectively. In both the bismuth compounds of KCBS and NCBS, the band gap changes from direct to indirect with the inclusion of SOC.

Partial DOS of ACu2BS3 (A = K, Na; B = Bi, Sb)

Fig. 3a depicts the partial density of states (PDOS) spectra of the KCBS compound. Near the Fermi energy (EF) region, the valence band is mainly attributed to mixing Cu-d and S-p states with a small amount of Bi-p states. In the case of CB, Bi-p and S-p states are majorly associated with a small contribution of K-s and Cu-p states in the region at 1.8 eV. The exchange correlation of PBE potential with the inclusion of SOC shifts the Bi-p and S-p states towards the EF region, which is a result of the slight reduction in the band gap to 0.9 eV. Fig. 3b) illustrates the PDOS of the KCSS compound. When the Bi is replaced with an Sb atom, it enlarges the band gap up to 1.36 eV. The computed band gap arises mainly with a significant contribution of Sb-p and S-p states with a minor influence of the K-s states. The Cu-p states have a more substantial impact on KCSS as compared with the KCBS compound in the CB region. In the VB region, a significant contribution is mainly attributed to Cu-d and S-p states. The K-p states have minimum impact, which almost disappears in the VB spectra. This phenomenon is the same as that observed for the KCBS compound. The inclusion of SOC with the PBE potential impacts the slight reduction in its band gap, i.e., up to 1.30 eV, due to the shift of Sb-p and S-p states towards the EF. Furthermore, the central atom of alkali-metal K+ is replaced with a Na+ atom to investigate its structural, electronic, and optical properties. Fig. 3c illustrates the PDOS of the NCBS compound. Similar to KCBS, in the NCBS compound, the VB has a significant contribution of Cu-d and S-p states with a minimum impact of Bi-p states. The maximum contribution of CB is made due to the mixing of Bi-p and S-p states with minimum influence of Na-s and Cu-p states by forming a band gap of 1.16 eV. On the other side, the inclusion of SOC with the PBE exchange–correlation function also causes a slight reduction in its band gap to 1 eV near the EF. Fig. 3d demonstrates the PDOS of the NCSS compound. Similarly, the CB region originated by the mixing of Sb-p and S-p states with a small contribution of Cu-p and Na-s states. Its corresponding VB is composed of Cu-d and S-p states as a domination state near the EF region. NCSS produces a wide band gap of up to 1.69 eV among all the systems. The effective SOC with PBE potential reduces the band gap up to 1.62 eV near the CB region. The reduction in band gap with the inclusive SOC in all the 2D QCL compounds originated due to its band degeneracies arising in the CB region.23 The effective mass of electrons (e−) and holes (h+) was calculated from the interpolated band structure shown in Table 3, using the equation . Here ℏ2, E, and K are the reduced planks constant, energy, and wave vector.23 The valence band shows anisotropy effective masses because of its layered structure.31 From the electronic band structure of Fig. 2(a–d), the bands were flat in the valence band region of all the compounds, which is expected to produce large hole-effective masses. Consequently, the higher effective masses of holes than the electrons, indicate lower hole mobility.31 The calculated effective mass of electrons reveals , , , and  for KCBS, KCSS, NCBS, and NCSS compounds. Its corresponding effective mass of holes exhibits , , , and  for KCBS, KCSS, NCBS, and NCSS compounds. The effective mass of holes increases in antimony compounds as compared to Bi-compounds. Because of the highly effective mass of holes in all the QCL 2D compounds tabulated in Table 3, it could lead to increasingly higher acceptor ionisation energies.32 The increase in ionisation energy enhances the quantum efficiency (QE) which is beneficial in solar cells.33 Additionally, some reports show that there may be an increase in open circuit potential (Voc) for hole transport material (HTM) with increasing ionisation energy.34–36

Optical properties
The term dielectric function is likely determined from its corresponding PDOS of VB and CB spectra because certain values related to Van Hove singularities are observed.37 Thus, using eqn (1) and (2), the dielectric properties of QCL compounds were calculated, which are shown in Fig. 4(a–d). The real part, ε1(ω), and the imaginary part, ε2(ω), of the dielectric function are associated with each other through the Kramers–Kronig eqn (6). In Fig. 4a, of the real part of KCBS, the principal peaks at less energy, i.e., 1.52 and 1.88 eV using PBE and PBE + SOC fundamentally arises with the transition of Cu-d states from the VBM to the Bi-p and S-p states in the CBM. In the KCSS compound shown in Fig. 4b, the identified peaks at 1.73 and 2.07 eV using PBE and PBE + SOC are attributed to the transition from Cu-d states in the VBM to Sb-p and S-p states in the CBM. The other successive peaks in Fig. 4c, at 1.36 and 1.92 eV using PBE and PBE + SOC potential originated due to the optical transition that takes place from Cu-d states in VBM to Bi-p and S-p states in the CBM. The extrapolated high-intensity peaks among all the compounds in Fig. 4d originate from the transition from the Cu-d states in the VBM to the Sb-p and S-p states in CBM. The real part of all the ACu2BS3 (A = K, Na; B = Bi, Sb) compounds, which were determined by analysing the peak position and its energy range, are listed in Table 2. The non-linear nature of Bi-compounds in Fig. 4a and c is noticeable due to their indirect band transitions. Furthermore, the validated imaginary part ε2(ω) of the dielectric function of all ACu2BS3 (A = K, Na; B = Bi, Sb) compounds are represented in the same figures from Fig. 4(a–d), with its corresponding real part ε2(ω) of the dielectric function. Therefore, the alkali-metal of K+ compounds in KCBS and KCSS has the lowest value of ε2(ω) (5.15, 4.83) at the energy range of 2.04 and 2 eV as compared with Na+ compounds of NCBS and NCSS with the highest value of ε2(ω) (6.06, 5.88) at the energy range of 1.91 and 1.99 eV using PBE potential. Similarly, the inclusion of SOC with PBE potentially enhances the optical response up to 7.16, 7.09, 8.05, and 9.85 at energies of 2.31, 2.30, 2.32, and 2.38 eV for KCBS, KCSS, NCBS, and NCSS compounds, respectively. The change in optical response with the inclusion of SOC originates from the band degeneracies of the CBM above the EF explained by the electronic band structure. The improved optical response in the alkali-metal Na+ compounds as compared with the K+ compounds is due to the high electronegativity differences between Na (0.93) as compared with K (0.82) atoms.

The absorption coefficient of all 2D QCL compounds starts at the energy of the band gap illustrated in Fig. 5(a–d). The estimated optical band gap of all the compounds is shown in Fig. 6(a–h) in which the transition takes place in X–X for the direct band gap and Γ–Y for the indirect band gap. The optical band gap is evaluated using the equation (αhν)n = A(hν − Eg) (where n = 2 for direct band gap;  for indirect band gap). Its comparative electronic band gap is shown in Table 3.

In Fig. 5(a–d), the first absorption peak appears at 2.1, 2.7, 2, and 2.3 eV for KCBS, KCSS, NCBS, and NCSS compounds using PBE potential. Similarly, the PBE + SOC potential is observed at 2.3, 2.5, 2.2, and 2.45 eV for KCBS, KCSS, NCBS, and NCSS compounds. In both PBE and PBE + SOC potential, the first peak arises at low energy under the visible region due to the transition that takes place from the Cu-d states in the VB to the Bi-p and S-p states in the CB in both KCBS and NCBS compounds. In the case of KCSS and NCSS compounds, the first peak is due to the transition that occurs from Cu-d states in VB to Sb-p and S-p states in the CB. From all four 2D QCL KCBS, KCSS, NCBS and NCSS compounds, the absorption coefficient is greater than 105 cm−1 which is the best suitable property applicable to solar cells.
Conclusion
In summary, the structural, electronic, and optical properties of QCL 2D ACu2BS3 (A = K, Na; B = Bi, Sb) compounds were computed using the Quantum Espresso code. The calculated structural, electronic, and optical properties of KCBS and KCSS were consistent with the available literature. The effect of SOC has a significant effect on its electronic and optical properties in all the compounds. The estimated band gap changes from direct to indirect due to band degeneracies in the case of the bismuth group of the KCBS and NCBS compounds. The calculated band gap using PBE potential shows 1.10, 1.36, 1.16, and 1.69 eV for KCBS, KCSS, NCBS, and NCSS compounds. It reduces to 0.9, 1.30, 1, and 1.62 eV for KCBS, KCSS, NCBS, and NCSS when the SOC is included. Similarly, its optical band gap changes from 1.43–1.23 eV, 1.6–1.49 eV, 1.3–1.25 eV, and 1.77–1.74 eV with the effective SOC in the PBE exchange–correlation function for KCBS, KCSS, NCBS, and NCSS compounds. In addition, these compounds produce an absorption coefficient >105 cm−1. From all these peculiarities, 2D QCL compounds of KCBS, KSCC, NCBS, and NCSS show promising scope for use in the PVC. Thus, these systems can be useful in fabricating technology for solar cells.
