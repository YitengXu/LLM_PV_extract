    , Accepted 24th October 2020First published on 26th October 2020AbstractNickel foam (NF) can be directly utilized as an electrochemical electrode because of its conductive, rigid and porous structure. Herein, a novel robust binder-free Fe–Ni hydroxide-loaded NF electrode is prepared by simple corrosion of NF in a home-made piranha solution with an Fe3+ precursor. The roughened NF surface observed after the sample treatment indicates the formation of active species associated with amorphous Fe-hydroxide and/or FeNi-hydroxide particles. The piranha solution-corroded NF electrode generates more hydroxide groups compared to the water-corroded NF electrode, and exhibits remarkable electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction activity in alkaline medium with a low overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm−2. It also maintains low working potential below 267 mV at 10 mA cm−2 over 500 h operation without any sign of degradation, indicating excellent long-term stability, which can be attributed to the robust binder-free electrode and the cooperative synergistic interaction between Fe-hydroxides and Ni-hydroxides in the FeNi hybrid composite of individually incompetent OER components, generated over the NF. The role of Fe doped in Ni(OH)2 is theoretically studied by DFT calculations, and it is found that the adsorption free energies of OH* and OOH* are significantly reduced by the addition of Fe into Ni(OH)2, accelerating the OER compared to bare Ni(OH)2. Furthermore, when the active electrode is equipped with a solar cell, a high current density of 23–24 mA cm−2 is observed for 10 h under AM 1.5G 1 sun irradiation, suggesting high possibility for the production of green hydrogen from renewable solar energy.
Introduction
With the rapid development of human society, various environmental problems like global warming,1 and air2 and water pollution3 have arisen, threatening our life and society. Many suggestions from the scientific community have been discussed, and use of renewable energy has been suggested as the most suitable solution to these problems.4–6 Regarding renewable energy, hydrogen has been widely considered as the most efficient, clean and renewable energy carrier for the future as it is a zero-emission fuel when burned with oxygen since water is the only product of the reaction. It can be used in internal combustion engines or electrochemical cells to power vehicles or to get electricity. Fuel cells using hydrogen as a fuel have been considered as the most promising alternative to fossil combustion engines because of high energy efficiency and negligible pollutant emission from the reaction.
Hydrogen gas can be obtained from petroleum cracking, bio-mass or electrochemical water splitting.7–12 The electrochemical water splitting is considered as the most clean and efficient way of generating hydrogen without production of other pollutants when combined with renewable energy sources like sun and wind power. The electrochemical water splitting comprises two reactions: one is the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the other is the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These HER and OER for water splitting can be achieved in photocatalytic, electrocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic systems.9,13–19 The OER is considered as the bottleneck for the overall reaction because of the high overpotential and the poor stability of the catalysts. These issues have encouraged a lot of researchers to develop efficient OER catalysts with low overpotential and long-lasting durability.20–29
Iridium oxide (IrO2) and ruthenium oxide (RuO2) in terms of electrochemical water splitting, have been known as reference state-of-the-art catalysts for the OER, but they are too expensive to be commercialized on an industrial scale.30–33 Recently, to overcome this issue, composites of non-precious metal elements consisting of Ni, Fe, and Co and their oxides, hydroxides or (oxy)hydroxides have been studied as promising low-cost OER catalysts. Xu et al. prepared porous NiCo@NiCoO2 micro arrays constructed on carbon fibers.34 NiCo@NiCoO2 was prepared by a hydrothermal reaction generating a metal organic framework (MOF) followed by carbonization. The overpotential recorded was 366 mV at 20 mA cm−2. Qiu et al. synthesized Ni0.6Co1.4P nanocages from Cu2O templates through metal oxide phosphidation.35 They used Pearson's hard soft acid base (HSAB) principle for making Ni0.6Co1.4(OH)2 and then phosphorized this to the alloy metal phosphide. The overpotential was 300 mV at 10 mA cm−2. Yu et al. synthesized ultrathin Ni–Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets from a solid nickel prism precursor with hydrolysis of Fe2+, which showed an overpotential of 267 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and high stability in alkaline solution.36 However, most of the Fe–Ni hydroxide catalysts are prepared in powder form and thus require an extra interface with a binder (Nafion) on the electrode, resulting in the lack of direct electrical contact between catalysts and the substrate and hence poor electrical conductivity.20,22,37–40
Meanwhile, metals in the form of foams and foils have been directly used as binder-free water splitting electrodes with modification by a hydrothermal reaction or electrochemical deposition of other transition metals as well as chalcogenization using oxygen, sulfur and selenium.41–48 For example, Ren et al. reported Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 sheets on nickel foam (NF) by a simple hydrothermal reaction.49 It was used as a bifunctional electrode for the HER and OER. The overpotential of the cell was 440 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting. Zhang et al. prepared NiFe-LDH on Ni2P@NiFe hydroxide.50 The catalyst was fabricated by phosphidation of NiFe-LDH grown on NF by a hydrothermal reaction, and showed an overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH.
Another promising approach is to use corrosion engineering for self-oxidation of the metal substrate followed by reaction with other active transition metals. Wei et al. reported that the binder-free open petal-like FeNi–OH nanosheets over NF was prepared by simple immersion of NF into a solution mixture of FeCl3 and NiCl2.51 The as-prepared catalyst required an overpotential of 219 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm−2. The excellent OER activity was attributed to the increased hydrophilicity induced by the FeNi–OH structure generated on the NF. Liu et al. used corrosion engineering on an iron substrate with aqueous solution containing various metal ions (Ni2+, Co2+, Mn2+…).52 The OER performance was well maintained for 6000 h below 300 mV at 500 mA cm−2 without any degradation. Yin et al. found that metallic Ni in NF was oxidized to Ni2+ in ferric nitrate aqueous solution which reacted with Fe2+ ions finally to generate active NiFexOHy layers on the surface for high OER activity.53
In this study, a binder-free hybrid electrode of Fe–Ni hydroxide composites is in situ prepared for the first time from NF with Fe(NO3)3 as an Fe precursor in a home-made piranha solution, which is a 3:1 mixture of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a reaction medium. Interestingly, in the presence of the piranha solution, the oxidation of NF is accelerated, while Fe3+ ions are transformed into Fe-hydroxide nanoparticles (NPs) on the NF. The identical synthesis is conducted in the presence of water instead of piranha solution to prepare a control sample. The final products are examined by various analyses and evaluated for the electrochemical OER. The sample prepared in piranha solution is found to show much better OER performance than ones prepared in water, H2SO4 and H2O2. The former shows a low overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and remarkable durability over 500 h.
Results and discussion
Characterization of morphologies and the chemical structure
Herein, hybrid electrodes of Fe–Ni composites are prepared from NF with Fe(NO3)3 as an Fe precursor in different reaction media and denoted as NF–Fe–Y–Z, where Y represents the reaction medium (W for water and PS for piranha solution), and Z indicates a specific reaction time in hour besides the typical 1 h reaction time with no indication for 1 h-reacted samples (Scheme 1). The samples were also prepared without the Fe precursor in different reaction media and denoted as NF–Y–Z. Photographic images of NF samples obtained after specific treatments are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Slight color changes are noticed after the treatments. Fig. 1 shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of bare NF (Fig. 1a–c), NF–Fe–W(Fig. 1d–f) and NF–Fe–PS (Fig. 1g–i), where NF reacts with Fe(NO3)3 in either water or piranha solution, respectively. The surfaces of bare NF are smooth and clean. Fig. 1d–f reveal the resulting rough surfaces of NF after reaction with Fe3+ in water, indicating that Fe3+ ions are deposited as hydroxides on the NF during the corrosion reaction.53 When the reaction is performed in piranha solution (0.1 vol% aqueous solution), the surface roughness increases significantly with more wrinkles, and some particles are deposited on the NF as shown in Fig. 1i. The deposited particles are made up of aggregated smaller particles and thus results in a porous structure.

 Fig. 1  SEM images of (a)–(c) bare NF, (d)–(f) NF–Fe–W and (g)–(i) NF–Fe–PS at different magnifications. 
To check the effect of each component of piranha solution, NF-based electrodes were also prepared in H2O2 or H2SO4 medium as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Fig. S2a–c (ESI†) indicate the electrode prepared in H2O2 medium (detailed synthesis method is described in the ESI†). Many pores are generated on the NF substrate, and small particles of around 20 nm are also deposited on the NF substrate as shown in Fig. S2c (ESI†). We believe that the formation of pores is due to oxidation of the Ni metal surface, and the deposited particles can be FeNi or individual metal hydroxides. Fig. S2d–f (ESI†) show SEM images at different magnifications of NF–Fe–H2SO4 synthesized in H2SO4 medium. As shown in Fig. S2f (ESI†), the surface is full of thin layers, which may be typical of hydroxides of Ni or Fe. Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†) show elemental mapping images. Samples that reacted with Fe3+ ions show the distribution of Fe as well as Ni and O elements.
To further understand the NF–Fe–PS structure, transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was conducted. Fig. 2 illustrates cross sectional TEM images and corresponding elemental mapping images of NF–Fe–PS. The TEM images clearly indicate the formation of some dark objects buried under the carbon shell layer on the NF. The objects seem amorphous and are made of small particles to form clusters as seen in Fig. 2a–c. Interestingly, the elemental mapping images in Fig. 2d–g reveal that the clustered particles consist mainly of Fe and O without Ni, indicating that Fe3+ ions are transformed into iron hydroxide cluster particles on the NF surface. Moreover, Fig. S2f and g (ESI†) clearly indicate that the Fe-hydroxides are also deposited as a thin layer on the surface of the Ni foam. The formation of iron oxide (ΔGf = −744.8 kJ mol−1) is thermodynamically more favorable and spontaneous than nickel oxide formation (ΔGf = −211.7 kJ mol−1).54 The as-prepared NF–Fe–PS was further analyzed. The surface structure of a broken piece from NF–Fe–PS is amorphous as seen in Fig. S5b (ESI†) in accordance with Fig. 2b and c, but contains Ni as well as Fe and O elemental components as shown in Fig. S5c–f (ESI†) probably because the piece contains the Ni foam substrate.

In order to study the effect of each reaction medium, the electrodes were prepared without the Fe3+ precursor in different media. When piranha solution (NF–PS) is used (Fig. S6b, ESI†), the NF surface becomes porous and rough due to the etching effect. However, in the case of H2SO4 and H2O2 (NF–H2SO4 and NF–H2O2) which are the components of piranha solution, the surfaces of both structures do not develop any clear pore structures (Fig. S6c and d, ESI†). NF–H2SO4, however, leaves somewhat regular line patterns on the surface probably due to acid etching (Fig. S6c, ESI†). When the NF is treated with water without the Fe precursor, little change is seen on the surface for NF–W (Fig. S6a, ESI†).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to study the composition, structure and formation mechanism of different samples (Fig. 3). Fig. 3a reveals XPS full-survey scans of NF, NF–Fe–W and NF–Fe–PS, respectively. NF possesses Ni and O species and is considered as being covered with NiO owing to natural passivation of the NF surface. Interestingly, the O peak intensity increases further with treatment with different reaction media as shown in Fig. 3a and S7a (ESI†), indicating increased formation of oxides, hydroxides and (oxy)hydroxides. The obtained signals were corrected using C 1s at 284.8 eV as a calibration point. Fig. 3b shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p for different samples. There are two regions corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 between 850 and 865 eV and for Ni 2p1/2 between 867 and 884 eV because the 2p orbital has two spin states according to j = l + s, where l is the angular momentum quantum number, and s is the spin angular momentum number, which can be +1/2 and −1/2.51–53 The observed peaks of NF correspond to Ni0 (852.3 eV)55 and Ni2+ (855.2 eV).56 For NF–Fe–W, the Ni0 peak decreases a bit while the Ni2+ peak increases. Interestingly, for NF–Fe–PS, the Ni0 peak intensity decreases drastically, while the Ni2+ peak intensity increases and becomes dominant, indicating that piranha solution accelerates the oxidation of the NF surface.
 Fig. 3  (a) XPS survey scans and high resolution narrow scan XPS spectra of (b) Ni 2p, (c) Fe 2p and (d) O 1s, respectively of different samples. 

Fig. 3c shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p, which also reveal two main peaks at ∼712 and ∼724 eV corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively. NF–Fe–W and NF–Fe–PS display Fe3+ and Fe4+ signals at ∼710.8 eV and ∼712.5 eV in 2p3/2, respectively.57,58 which were not observed in bare NF. Bare NF shows only the Ni peak (712.1 eV). The observed Fe 2p3/2 XPS peak for NF–Fe–PS is slightly shifted to higher binding energy relative to that of NF–Fe–W probably because of more preferable formation of Fe4+ in NF–Fe–PS. High-resolution XPS spectra of O 1s are shown in Fig. 3d. The observed signals correspond to M–OH (531.05 eV), Ni–O (529.3 eV) and Fe–O (529.7 eV) binding peaks.52 Interestingly, the NF–Fe–W prepared in water has a larger Fe–O binding peak than NF–Fe–PS. This result may indicate that water facilitates more Fe–O binding than Fe–OH bonding, while piranha solution favors M–OH binding with higher M–OH/M–O ratio.
Further XPS analyses were carried out for NF–Fe–H2O2 and NF–Fe–H2SO4 prepared in H2O2 and H2SO4 solution, respectively. As shown in Ni 2p XPS spectra in Fig. S7b (ESI†) the Ni0 peak decreased significantly for both NF–Fe–H2O2 and NF–Fe–H2SO4, indicating that the formation of Ni2+ is more facilitated in both H2O2 and H2SO4 than in water medium. NF–Fe–H2SO4 also reveals a similar unsymmetrical broad peak corresponding to Fe3+ and Fe4+ in the Fe 2p3/2 spectrum like NF–Fe–PS in Fig. 3c. Interestingly, the formation of Fe4+ seems more favored in H2SO4 medium than in H2O2 medium. Moreover, NF–Fe–H2SO4 reveals an O 1s spectrum similar to that of NF–Fe–PS with M–OH as the main component (Fig. S7d, ESI† and Fig. 3d). On the other hand, NF–Fe–H2O2 shows various M–O (∼529.7 eV), M–OH (∼530.9 eV) and M–OOH (532.4 eV) binding signals and particularly reveals strong development of M–O like NF–Fe–W (Fig. S7d, ESI† and Fig. 3d).
To reveal the effects of each reaction medium alone without Fe interference, XPS analyses of the as-prepared samples in different reaction media without the Fe precursor were conducted. Fig. S8b (ESI†) shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p. NF–W exhibits dominant development of both Ni0 and Ni2+(–OH) peaks, which are quite similar to those of bare NF. This is in full agreement with Fig. S6a (ESI†), where little change is seen on the surface of the NF–W when the NF is treated with water without the Fe precursor, indicating that H2O solvent itself has almost no effect on the NF surface. However, NF-PS shows predominant development of Ni2+(–OH) with a drastic decrease of Ni0 as shown in Fig. S8b (ESI†). Interestingly, NF–H2SO4 and NF–H2O2 include not only Ni0 and Ni2+(–OH) but also Ni2+(–O) as shown in Fig. S8b (ESI†). Due to the absence of Fe, there is no specific Fe peak in high-resolution Fe 2p XPS spectra in Fig. S8c (ESI†). In the case of O 1s, NF–PS shows the lowest Ni–O intensity, while NF–H2O2 has the largest Ni–O intensity (Fig. S8d, ESI†), indicating that piranha solution shows the highest Ni–OH/Ni–O ratio. Therefore, the piranha solution must be more favourable for the formation of M–OH groups irrespective of the presence of Fe ions as shown in Fig. 3d and S8d (ESI†). Since the M–OH groups are known to be active species for the OER, the piranha solution is a very effective reaction medium for the formation of a novel Fe–Ni hydroxide-loaded NF electrode which is good for the OER.
Table S1† summarizes the elemental compositions for each sample measured from XPS. NF–Fe–W contains around 9.9 atomic% Fe species, while NF–Fe–PS contains about 5.4 atomic% Fe species. Interestingly, NF–Fe–H2O2 contains the highest amount of O species, which may be related to the chemical property of H2O2 as an oxidizing agent with capability of strongly oxidizing NF. In the absence of the Fe precursor (Table S2†), NF–PS shows the highest amount of O species, also indicating that piranha solution can easily form –OH groups on the nickel foam surface. Although both H2O2 and H2SO4 are the components of piranha solution, each component reveals somewhat subtle differences compared with the piranha solution. Interestingly, the piranha solution helps to easily develop the favourable M–OH and Fe4+ species in NF–Fe–PS from the synergistic effect of both H2O2 and H2SO4, but different from each individual component.
The metallic Ni of nickel foam and Fe3+ are oxidized by H2O2 and H2SO4, which are components of the piranha solution. H2O2 and H2SO4 play essential roles as oxidizing materials to generate FexNi(OH)y.59 Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in piranha solution controls the amount of Fe deposited on the NF surface, confirmed by XPS measurements (Table S1†). With H2SO4, the loading amount of Fe is relatively low (2.96 atomic%) because the acidic properties make Fe3+ ions stable in the solution, whereas H2O2 facilitates oxidation of metallic Ni on the NF surface and allows the Ni2+ to react with Fe3+, resulting in the increase in the loading amount of Fe (8.24 atomic%). With piranha solution, it is possible to deposit a high amount of Fe (5.36 atomic%) due to the synergistic effect of H2SO4 and H2O2.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on the various samples in Fig. S9 (ESI†). NF shows strong signals corresponding to metallic Ni (JCPDS card #04-0850). NF–Fe–W and NF–Fe–PS reveal a broad peak at 22° θ, which may correspond to the amorphous phase of Ni and Fe hydroxides, in addition to the metallic Ni peaks. Interestingly, the broad peak was not observed with individual H2O2 or H2SO4.
OER catalytic performance
The electrochemical OER was carried out in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution, and the effect of reaction medium on the OER performance in the presence of Fe species was investigated in Fig. 4. The preparation method of the RuO2 reference catalyst is described in the Experimental section. Fig. 4a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves measured for different samples, where the pre-wave at 1.35–1.40 V indicates the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+, and NF–Fe–H2SO4 shows a higher pre-wave peak intensity than other samples probably due to the relatively high Ni2+ ratio and high N content (Table S1, ESI†) and relatively more formation of M–OH (Fig. S7d†). NF–Fe–PS presents the best OER performance with an overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm−2 among the samples. It also displays a Tafel slope of 82.9 mV dec−1 as shown in Fig. 4b. This catalytic performance is found to be much better than that of the state-of-the-art RuO2. NF–Fe–H2SO4 and NF–Fe–H2O2 display better OER performance than NF–Fe–W. All the samples with Fe species also outperform RuO2, while NF–PS, NF–W, NF–H2SO4 and NF–H2O2 without Fe species reveal poor OER performance as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Interestingly, the NF-based catalysts prepared in different reaction media without the Fe precursor exhibit similar poor OER activity, not much different from that of bare NF as shown in Fig. S10a (ESI†), indicating that the reaction medium has little effect on the OER activity in the absence of Fe. Furthermore, the Fe-treated catalysts show much lower Tafel slopes compared to the catalysts without Fe species as seen in Fig. S10b (ESI†). The catalysts without Fe species also display similar high Tafel slopes, not much different from that of the bare NF. This clearly indicates that Ni oxides or Ni hydroxides alone are not efficient without Fe species. Such a high OER performance of the NF–Fe–PS sample is attributed to synergistic interactions between Fe-hydroxide particles and Fe-decorated Ni substrate or Fe-hydroxides and Ni-hydroxides in the FexNi(OH)y hybrids generated on the surface of NF–Fe–PS. Moreover, the stabilization of Fe4+ by Ni(OH)2 was reported to be a key factor for high OER activity.60 It is also reported that FexNi(OH)y may be helpful for the stabilization of Fe4+.
 Fig. 4  (a) Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves, which were iR-compensated, (b) corresponding Tafel plots for different samples. (c) Long-term stability test at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, where the electrolyte was replaced after every 100 h as marked by arrows and (d) step stability tests of NF–Fe–PS in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte (scan rate was 10 mV s−1 for LSV). 
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of different samples are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). NF–Fe–PS shows lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) relative to other samples, which depicts the superior OER activity. The OER activity decreases with increasing charge transfer resistance as illustrated in Fig. 4a. Fig. S12 (ESI†) illustrates CV curves of different samples measured with the scan rate set to 20 mV s−1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ at ∼1.44 V for bare NF shifts to higher potential at ∼1.46 V (NF–Fe–PS), ∼1.47 V (NF–Fe–H2SO4), 1.48 V (NF–Fe–W) and 1.49 V (NF–Fe–H2O2), indicating interaction of Ni with Fe species in the samples. This shift may be related to the Fe content because of higher oxidation potential of Fe than that of Ni, also proving the presence of Fe species in the sample.61,62 NF–Fe–W and NF–Fe–H2O2 show the biggest shift to higher potential probably owing to a large amount of Fe species generated as shown in Table S1.†
Durability was also tested for practical application. Fig. 4c shows the results of the long-term stability test of as-prepared NF–Fe–PS at a fixed current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 500 h with a new electrolyte changed after every 100 h. NF–Fe–PS demonstrates excellent stability, maintaining a low overpotential of 267 mV after the 500 h test. Potentials as a function of increasing step-applied current density of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mA cm−2 were also measured for NF–Fe–PS for 5 h in Fig. 4d to determine the stability of the catalyst under harsh OER conditions. This current–voltage response corresponds to the non-iR corrected LSV curve for NF–Fe–PS as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). When the identical increasing step-applied current procedure was repeated three times, little decay of performance was observed at each applied current step. To further investigate the stability of NF–Fe–PS, the NF–Fe–PS sample after the 500 h long-term test in Fig. 4c was re-tested by LSV. The LSV curves of fresh and 500 h-tested NF–Fe–PS are shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). NF–Fe–PS displayed only a bit increased overpotential to 267 from 245 mV at 10 mA cm−2 even after the long-term stability test for 500 h, illustrating the extremely high stability of the sample under harsh OER working conditions.
Fig. S15 (ESI†) shows the SEM images of NF–Fe–PS after 100, 300 and 500 h stability tests. Interestingly, compared to the fresh sample made up of small particles of Fe(OH)x before the stability test, much larger thin layered morphologies are predominantly developed on the surface as the time of the stability test is increased. Such thin and layered structures are typical of metal hydroxides. It is suggested that initial Fe-based NPs are transformed into layered metal hydroxides during the OER.
NF–Fe–PS after the stability test at different times was also analyzed by XPS to investigate the chemical structure changes. Fig. S16 (ESI†) shows the XPS spectra of the NF–Fe–PS sample before and after the long-term test at 10 mA cm−2 as illustrated in Fig. 4c. The Fe signal in Fe 2p3/2 shifted to higher binding energy and became weaker and broader with increasing test time as shown in Fig. S16a (ESI†). This change may be attributed to the change in the oxidation state from Fe3+ to Fe4+ and the dissolution of the Fe from NF–Fe–PS during the reaction. We believe that the dissolution of the Fe is closely related to the morphology change of NF–Fe–PS from particulate shape to the thin layer structure observed in Fig. S15 (ESI†). During such morphology conversion from particles to thin layers, the rearrangement between Fe and Ni takes place, and excessive amount of Fe may be leached out. Finally, Ni hydroxide with a low doping level of Fe is formed as a stable and highly active catalyst. Zhu et al. reported that Fe4+ species in Ni hydroxides is an active center for the OER through in situ ambient X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) and Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis.60 High-resolution XPS spectra of Ni 2p are almost identical in fresh and tested NF–Fe–PS samples, but the initial small amount of Ni0 almost disappears during the test as shown in Fig. S16b (ESI†). In the case of O 1s, the small M–O shoulder signal at ∼529 eV gradually disappears, while the M–OH peak is predominantly observed with increasing test time in Fig. S16c (ESI†). This is consistent with the formation of a layered metal hydroxide structure after the stability test as shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†).
Fig. S16d (ESI†) illustrates the changes of the element ratio and OER activity as a function of test time. The table underneath Fig. S16d (ESI†) summarizes the elemental composition and the overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 of NF–Fe–PS under different test conditions. Oxygen is the most abundant element present in the NF–Fe–PS sample. Notably, the fraction of Fe decreases significantly with increasing test time, but the reduction rate decreases with the test time, indicating that the Fe content is stabilized with the small amount of Fe in NF–Fe–PS. Interestingly, even though the amount of Fe in NF–Fe–PS decreases, the OER activity is maintained without severe degradation over the test time up to 500 h as seen in Fig. S16d (ESI†). It is expected that the initial Fe amount deposited on NF is too high and the excessive Fe may not take part in the OER and remain as an unstable species in KOH electrolyte. As the test time passes, the unstable Fe is dissolved out, and the small amount of remaining Fe impurities survived during the OER show the high OER performance through close interaction with Ni species in Ni hydroxide.
There has been debates on which metal species is the true active site in the Ni–Fe hydroxides for the OER. The Fe(OH)3 powder was prepared to investigate its activity in the OER. The preparation method is described in the Experimental section. Fig. S17a (ESI†) shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared Fe(OH)3 powder, which indicates the amorphous structure. Moreover, the Fe(OH)3 shows lower OER activity than RuO2 as seen in Fig. S17b (ESI†), indicating that Fe(OH)3 is not a high OER active species. Otherwise, it may suggest that only single metal hydroxide like Fe(OH)3 or Ni(OH)2 does not have high catalytic OER activity. This may indicate that Fe(OH)3 reveals superior OER performance with synergistic effects only when Fe(OH)3 exists together with Ni(OH)2, Ni–O or/and Ni metal.
The effect of catalyst preparation time and the Fe amount during synthesis was further investigated to find out the optimum preparation conditions. Fig. S18 (ESI†) shows the OER activity of NF–Fe–W and NF–Fe–PS samples prepared with various reaction times of 30 min, 1 and 3 h. Regardless of the reaction time, all the catalysts synthesized in piranha solution exhibit more improved OER activity than those in water medium. In addition, 1 h is found to be the best optimum time for the preparation of the OER catalyst in piranha solution. Interestingly, the OER activity was almost independent of the preparation time in the case of NF–Fe–W. Fig. S19 (ESI†) illustrates the OER activity of NF–Fe(x)–PS, where the x indicates the amount of Fe used for the synthesis. x = 1 indicates 12.5 mM Fe(NO3)3·9H2O used for the synthesis of NF–Fe–PS and thus 25.0 mM of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O is used to synthesize NF–Fe(2)–PS. The OER activity increases with increasing Fe content from x = 0.1 to x = 1 and then decreases with further increasing Fe amount with optimum x = 1, indicating that too much Fe amount is not good for OER activity.
Electrochemical active surface areas of the electrodes were evaluated by measuring double layer capacitances (Cdl) from corresponding CV curves. Fig. S20 (ESI†) reveals the CV curves of NF, NF–Fe–W and NF–Fe–PS at different scan rates and their calculated Cdl values. NF–Fe–PS shows a Cdl value of 1.4 μF cm2, which is higher than that of NF–Fe–W (0.8 μF cm2) and NF (0.4 μF cm2), implying high active surface area and eventually high OER activity of the catalyst.63–65
DFT calculations
The effect of Fe doping in Ni(OH)2 was theoretically studied by DFT (density functional theory) calculations. The OER pathway under alkaline conditions is described by the following four steps.66,67 * + OH− → OH* + e−(1) OH* + OH− → O* + H2O + e−(2) O* + OH− → OOH* + e−(3) OOH* + OH− → * + O2 + H2O + e−(4)where * represents the active species on the catalyst surface.
In this DFT model, Fe4+ species is considered as an active site for the OER at 1.23 V (pH = 14). For bare Ni(OH)2 the rate determining step (RDS) is step (4) with a free energy of 2.022 eV, while in the case of Fe4+-doped Ni(OH)2, the RDS is step (2) with a free energy of 0.836 eV. These results indicate that the addition of Fe4+ into Ni(OH)2 affects not only the RDS but also the free energy of the reaction. The decrease of RDS free energy from 2.022 to 0.836 eV means that the OER reaction on Fe4+-doped Ni(OH)2 is boosted compared to that on Ni(OH)2. It seems that by doping Fe4+ in Ni(OH)2, proton defects occur and reduce the adsorption energy of OH* and OOH*. Fig. 5b indicates the Fe–oxygen coordination geometry on the surface of Fe4+-doped Ni(OH)2.

Water splitting system powered by a solar cell
For practical OER applications using a renewable energy source like solar light, a two-electrode water splitting system was constructed using the as-prepared NF–Fe–PS as the anode electrode with Pt as the counter and reference electrodes operated by electrical energy obtained from a commercial solar cell (5 V, 40 mA). Fig. 6 shows the water splitting system with a solar cell under 1 sun irradiation. The system demonstrates a high current density of around 23–24 mA cm−2, which is sustained for 10 h without any significant sign of degradation in accordance with stable OER performance shown in Fig. 4c and d. Table 1 summarizes the electrochemical OER activities of various catalysts prepared from non-precious transition metals.

Conclusions
In summary, highly active and remarkably stable Ni–Fe based binder-free OER electrocatalysts were prepared in situ for the first time by simple corrosion of NF in home-made piranha solution with an Fe precursor. The NF was immersed in the piranha solution to react with ferric nitrate. Both sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide in the piranha solution played synergetic roles in the formation of active Fe hydroxide particles and Fe–Ni hydroxides on the Ni foam. The resulting NF–Fe–PS catalyst showed excellent OER performance with very low overpotential (245 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and exhibited outstanding long-term durability with retention of low overpotential below 267 mV over 500 h. This remarkable OER performance can be ascribed to the cooperative synergistic Fe–Ni interaction in the form of hydroxide, low charge transfer resistance associated with the binder-free catalyst and high electrochemical surface area of the robust and porous NF-based electrode. Interestingly, although the active Fe species continued to decrease during the long-term test of NF–Fe–PS, the OER activity was maintained without significant decay, which implied that a small amount of Fe was enough to play the key role for superior OER activity and stability. The DFT calculations illustrated that Fe4+ species played key roles to reduce the unfavourable RDS free energy of the OER. Finally, a more practical solar cell-equipped water electrolyzer has been set up with the as-prepared NF–Fe–PS anode and showed a very stable current density of 23–24 mA cm−2 under 1 sun irradiation, enabling the production of clean hydrogen from renewable solar energy. The present work demonstrates an innovative synthesis approach of low-cost, highly active, and robust binder-free Fe–Ni based composite electrocatalysts of individually incompetent OER components for scalable water splitting though a simple new corrosion method using piranha solution and can be extended to the synthesis of other novel multi-component-based catalysts over NF.
