    , Accepted 13th January 2011First published on 1st February 2011AbstractWe have studied the initial processes of atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 on TiO2 anatase (101) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our ab initio thermodynamics results predict that, at typical ALD conditions, the initial substrate is almost completely dehydrated, with water being adsorbed only near defects. We show that the first ALD half-reaction, i.e. the adsorption of trimethylaluminium (Al(CH3)3, TMA), presents a positive Gibbs free energy. The proximity of water at defect sites can considerably stabilise the interaction by elimination of one or two methyl groups. Water molecules thus serve as nucleation seeds for the growth of the overcoating. The island growth mode found in experiments is then attributed to an incomplete hydration of the substrate.
1. Introduction

Dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) are gaining more and more attention as a promising alternative to the traditional silicon devices.1,2 In a DSSC, a layer of an organic or metal-based dye is bound to the surface of a nanoporous TiO2 film, forming a chromophore/semiconductor interface which has been extensively investigated.3–10 Following the photoexcitation within the dye, an electron is transferred to the conduction band (CB) of the oxide and can be used to do some work. The dye is then regenerated by a redox couple present in solution, which in turn is reduced by the electrons passed through the load.

        Anatase is usually the TiO2 polymorph employed in DSSCs. Since it is more difficult to obtain compared to rutile, the anatase phase has been less studied. However, in the past few years, remarkable progress has been made. It is now established, for example, that the (101) is the most stable face of anatase, constituting more than 94% of the crystal.11,12 It has also been discovered that defects reside predominantly subsurface.13 In the vicinity of the defects, water binds more strongly than at the clean surface,14 and its desorption temperature is higher.15 The existence of triangular islands whose orientation is determined by two types of low energy monoatomic steps (abbreviated in ref. 16 as D and B), has been shown by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies.17 The reactivity of steps is particularly crucial for nanoparticles, where it has been estimated that 15% of the surface atoms could be located at step edges.16
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a DSSC is strongly dependent on the electron recombination at the TiO2/dye and TiO2/electrolyte interface, which can both constitute a loss of efficiency. To tackle this problem, in the past few years, many groups have coated the TiO2 film with a thin layer of a second higher CB oxide, such as Al2O3,18–21Nb2O5,22,23MgO,24CaCO3,25 and ZrO2.26 The mechanism through which the overlayer increases the PCE is still under debate. It is thought that the insulating layer works as a physical barrier that retards all of the electron transfer (ET) reactions at the interface. Since without the coating the ET to the semiconductor is around 100 faster than the decay from the excited state of the dye, the injection yield into the semiconductor is insensitive to the small lengthening of the injection time caused by the coating. Vice versa, a retardation of the recombination reactions at the TiO2/dye and TiO2/electrolyte interface reduces the losses, bringing to a final increase in the PCE. However, if the coating is too thick, the injection process can be retarded too much, and the dye decay is favoured: the result is a decrease of the photoinjection current and a corresponding loss of efficiency.
Palomares et al. have conformally grown an overlayer of Al2O3 on a nanocrystalline TiO2 film, showing a 30% improvement in PCE.19 To coat the nanoparticles, they made use of the surface sol–gel process,27 which, because it has a minimum achievable thickness of around 1 nm, gives poor controllability in the determination of the optimal thickness.
Due to its high thickness resolution (around 0.1 nm) and infiltrating capability, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is considered an ideal technique to deposit uniform and monolayer Al2O3 films.28–33Alumina ALD, whose precursors are usually trimethylaluminium (Al(CH3)3, TMA) and H2O, is based on the repetition of the two self-terminating half-reactions on the growing substrate:1. Al–OH* + Al(CH3)3 → Al–O–Al(CH3)2* + CH42. Al–O–Al(CH3)2* + 2H2O → Al–O–Al(OH)2* + 2CH4,where the asterisks represent the surface species.
In the attempt to go beyond the PCE of the sol–gel process, Lin et al. have employed Al2O3 ALD to overcoat anatase based DSSCs.34 However, despite the potential advantages of ALD, the final 14% PCE increase was lower than the 30% already reported for the sol–gel technique.19 In ref. 35, Tien et al. have ascribed the unsatisfactory results to a low Al2O3 coverage of the TiO2 film, due in turn to the prevalence of the island growth mode 37 during ALD. A complete understanding of the growth mechanism of the Al2O3 overlayers is then an essential step towards further PCE increases in DSSCs.
Here, by means of density functional theory (DFT), we investigate the first half-reaction of Al2O3 ALD on anatase (101), described in the ideal self-terminating process by:Ti–OH* + Al(CH3)3 → Ti–O–Al(CH3)2* + CH4.
We compare the reaction pathways obtained for the stoichiometric substrate with those relative to step D. Although this does not cover the entire range of possible adsorption sites and ALD reactions, the two emerging scenarios are remarkably different and we show that the role of step D during ALD can be easily extended to other defect sites such as Ti interstitials and O vacancies. Despite some simplifications in the theoretical approach, we capture important insights into the adsorption of TMA, and provide a possible explanation to the incomplete and undesired coverage of the TiO2 electrode.
2. Methods
All of the DFT calculations have been performed with the VASP package,38,39 which solves the Kohn–Sham (KS) equations of the system through a self consistent procedure. We chose the generalised gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange and correlation term, in the formalism of Perdew and Wang (PW91).40 A plane wave basis set with a cutoff of 350 eV was adopted, enough to converge the energy of the unit cell of bulk anatase within 3 meV/atom. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials 41 were used to represent the effect of the inner electrons. Specifically, the 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s and 3p electrons of Ti, the 1s, 2s and 2p of Al, and the 1s of O and C were considered core electrons and not treated explicitly. Treating also the 3s and 3p Ti electrons as valence electrons resulted in a difference in the anatase bulk parameters of less than 0.01 Å. Additional calculations were also carried out with the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method,42 with little change (always less than 0.1 eV in the adsorption energies). Since VASP implements a periodic boundary conditions scheme, we introduced a vacuum of at least 8 Å between adjacent slabs to avoid spurious interactions between replica atoms. Relaxations of structures were performed with the conjugate gradient method, and stopped when the force acting on each ion was less than 0.03 eV/Å. The optimisations were performed with the Γ-point. All of the figures were made with VMD.43
A 4-layer (1 × 3) supercell, with dimensions of 10.48 and 11.43 Å was chosen to model the anatase (101) terrace slab. To model the anatase (101) step D, we used an orthorhombic 3-layer (2 × 2) slab, with one vector orientated along [11], and dimensions of 11.16 and 28.66 Å. The monoatomic step edge was created by removing 16 of the 32 TiO2 units from the top layer.
The adsorption energies at T = 0 K were evaluated according to the formula: Δe = [E(slab + gas) − E(slab) − NgasE(gas)]/Ngas.(1)Here, E(slab + gas) is the energy of the supercell with Ngas adsorbed molecules of gas (water or TMA), while E(slab) and E(gas) are the energy of the same supercell with respectively only the substrate or a single gas molecule.
In order to take into account the effect of temperature and pressure in describing the adsorption of the precursors, we have followed the ab initio thermodynamics approach.44 The Gibbs free adsorption energy for Ngas precursors on a surface or step slab, ΔG, is defined as: ΔG = G(slab + gas) − G(slab) − Ngasμ(gas).(2)For the condensed phases, we decompose the Gibbs free energies according to G = E + Fvib + pV,(3)where E is the internal energy, and Fvib the vibrational free energy (including the zero point contribution). At typical ALD pressures, it is possible to neglect the pV term in the calculation of the Gibbs free adsorption energies of the system.45 The gas chemical potential is defined as: μ(gas)(T,p) = (−kTlnZ + pV)/N,(4)where Z is the total partition function of an ideal gas composed of N indistinguishable molecules with translational, rotational, vibrational and electronic levels: (5)Its substitution into eqn (4) gives: μ(gas)(T,p) = μref(gas) + Δμ(gas)(T,p)(6)where μref(gas) is the total energy of the molecule at T = 0 K (including the zero point energy), and (7)contains respectively the remaining translational, rotational and vibrational terms. In eqn (7), σ is the symmetry number, IA, IB and IC the principal moment of inertia, and ωi the vibrational frequencies of the molecule. Test calculations have shown that the vibrational term, though not zero (around 0.1 eV for TMA), is smaller than the rotational (0.4 eV) and translational (0.9 eV) contribution to the Gibbs free energy, and will thus be neglected. Eqn (7) has been used to estimate Δμ(gas)(T,p) of TMA.
It is instead possible to make use of experimental data to calculate the chemical potential of water. By combining eqn (6) with (8)which gives the temperature and pressure dependence of μ(gas)(T,p) once its temperature dependence at a reference pressure p0 is known, and Δμ(gas)(T,p0) = ΔH(gas)(T,p0) − TΔS(gas)(T,p0),(9)which allows to use tabulated enthalpy and entropy values at a reference pressure46 to determine the variation of the chemical potential with respect to the T = 0 K limit, we can indeed write: (10)Under the assumptions introduced, eqn (2) transforms into: ΔG = Ngas[Δe − Δμ(gas)(T,p)],(11)where, as mentioned above, Δμ(gas)(T,p) has been estimated by eqn (2) and eqn (10), respectively for TMA and water.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Hydration of anatase prior to ALD
Before the first cycle of ALD starts, the substrate is wetted with a pulse of H2O vapor. Here we will address the hydration of anatase (101), both at flat terrace and step D, with the purpose of providing a realistic model of the substrate for the first half-reaction.
Experimental 47 and theoretical 48,49 studies agree that molecular adsorption of water is favoured over the dissociative adsorption mode on the clean anatase (101), regardless of the surface coverage. Based on this finding, we have decided not to investigate any type of dissociative adsorption on the (101) terrace, focusing only on three different molecular coverages: 1/6 ML (low coverage), 1 ML (full coverage), and 2 ML (bilayer).

Table 1 compares the adsorption energies of water on anatase (101) at different sites and coverages with some previous results.

At low coverage, water is adsorbed with an energy of −0.78 eV on a 5-fold Ti (Fig. 1, top left), and forms two hydrogen bonds with a bridging O. In the full coverage, all of the rows of 5-fold Ti are saturated (Fig. 1, top right), but the bridging O can not accommodate two hydrogen bonds together, causing a rotation of the water molecules along [10] and decreasing the energy of adsorption to −0.73 eV. The bilayer coverage is obtained by adsorbing rows of water along [010], between the rows of saturated 5-fold Ti (Fig. 1, bottom). The added molecules form two hydrogen bonds with two bridging O and a third with a water of the adjacent [010] row. The new pattern of hydrogen bonds extending along [10] slightly strengthens the adsorption to −0.76 eV. Overall, the adsorption energies dependence on the water coverage follows a trend which is in agreement with literature.48,49

On step D, we investigated both molecular and dissociative adsorption of water. In the first case, water molecules were adsorbed at 5-fold step Ti; in the second, a H atom was transferred to the nearest 2-fold step O. At full coverage, a molecular adsorption (Fig. 2, left) is slightly favoured (−1.02 eV) over a dissociative one (−1.00 eV) (Fig. 2, right), in agreement with a previous study.16 The molecular and dissociative energies are less close when moving from a full to a half hydroxylated step, being respectively −1.04 and −0.95 eV.

The adsorption energies in Table 1 are valid only at zero temperature and pressure. However, since the hydration degree of any surface depends on the temperature T and partial pressure p of water in contact with it, we plot in Fig. 3 the Gibbs free adsorption energies of water on anatase (101) as a function of T, at the typical ALD pressure of p = 1 torr (eqn (11)). Each line corresponds to a different water coverage, and the horizontal line marks the zero desorption value of the bare surface. It can be seen that for temperatures above 350 K the surface is already dehydrated. This finding is fundamental, because implies that, at the typical ALD temperature of 423 K,34water molecules are already desorbed. Accordingly, we expect the first half-reaction, i.e. the adsorption of TMA, to take place on dehydrated anatase (101) terraces.

After depositing Al2O3 thin films on anatase (101), Lin et al. have established a graphical model for the adsorption of TMA34 during the first-half reaction. Here, anatase Ti–OH groups react with TMA, forming TiO–Al–(CH3)2 and releasing one CH4 molecule. Our finding, predicting water desorption at temperatures much lower than the typical ALD ones, is at odds with this model.
A different picture emerges from the adsorption of water on step D, one of the most characteristic defects of anatase (101). We have shown that at these sites water is preferentially adsorbed molecularly. Similarly to Fig. 3, Fig. 4 shows the Gibbs free adsorption energy for different coverages of molecular water at step D. It can be seen that water is desorbed at temperatures around 450 K, 100 K higher than at terraces, and, more importantly, above typical ALD working temperatures. In the next section, we will show that the presence of water deeply affects the subsequent half-reaction of the first ALD cycle, and can explain the island growth mode observed during experiments.35,36,50

3.2. Adsorption of TMA
We have shown above that ab initio thermodynamics predicts a dehydrated anatase (101) terrace as a substrate for the first metal precursor pulse. Fig. 5 and Table 2 report the T = 0 K structures and energetics for the adsorption of TMA on the bare terrace.

When a TMA molecule is adsorbed here (Fig. 5, T1), the reaction is exothermic (−1.04 eV) and does not present any barrier. The final Al–O distance is 1.84 Å, and one CH3 group interacts with a 5-fold Ti, which relaxes upwards by 0.19 Å. As a result, the CH3–Al bond is more stretched compared to the gas phase (2.13 vs. 1.96 Å). We have also considered the possibility of a dissociative adsorption of TMA (Fig. 5, T2). In this mode, still exothermic (−0.54 eV) but less favoured than molecular adsorption, the dissociated CH3 group is bonded to a 5-fold Ti below (2.22 Å). The latter moves by 0.45 Å upwards, implying that an interaction between the two fragments, separated by a distance of 2.54 Å, is still present.
The adsorption of TMA onto another substrate (bare Al2O3) has been investigated by Elliott et al.,29 who reported an adsorption energy of −1.2 eV, close to our value of −1.04 eV. However, they found the adsorbed TMA to dissociate, resulting in one AlCH3 and two CH3 fragments. The final state, less energetic by 2.4 eV than molecular adsorption, made the authors conclude that only a dissociative adsorption is stable against desorption. Here, we find instead that TMA is adsorbed molecularly, and no further stabilisation is achieved when the molecule is decomposed. This will have important consequences when the competition with desorption is taken into account.
Although some dissociated water is likely to be present at step D, we have shown above that the most thermodynamically stable configuration is 1 ML of molecular water, which has accordingly been employed on these defects for the adsorption of TMA. The T = 0 K structures and energetics for the adsorption of TMA on step D are illustrated in Fig. 6 and Table 3.

When TMA is adsorbed on the bridging O close to the edge, the relaxed structure is identical to the one at the flat terrace (Fig. 6, S1), with an Al–O distance of 1.83 Å. The interaction between a CH3 group and a 5-fold Ti is still present, which causes a stretching of the CH3 bond with the Al, like in the flat terrace. Coherently, we find a very similar adsorption energy of −1.05 eV (only 0.01 eV lower than at the flat terrace). From this structure, a methyl group can accept a hydrogen from a near water molecule and desorb as CH4. In the relaxed structure (Fig. 6, S2), the Al presents a planar coordination, and binds the bridging O with a distance of 1.75 Å. The resulting reaction energy is of −0.42 eV. Despite this configuration being stable, we have identified at least two other configurations which have a lower energy. In the first (Fig. 6, S3), Al(CH3)2 moves towards the terrace, and bonds to a second bridging O in a tetrahedral structure. The corresponding gain of energy is of 0.66 eV. In the second (Fig. 6, S4), with an energy gain of 0.57 eV, the Al(CH3)2 group moves towards the edge, making an additional bond to a 2-fold step O, and creating again a tetrahedral structure. Unlike in S3, here, another CH3 group is in proximity of the remaining OH group at the step, from which a second H can be transferred. To test this possibility, we optimised the structure relative to a double CH4 desorption (Fig. 6, S5). Here, the remaining AlCH3 group replaces the previous bond to the methyl group with a third bond to the O of the original water. This second desorption gives an additional gain energy of 0.96 eV, bringing to −3.00 eV the total exoergicity with respect to the desorbed TMA.
We recall that at typical ALD working conditions (T = 423 K, p = 1 torr), the system is correctly described by its Gibbs free energy G(T,p). In order to take into account the effects of pressure and temperature on the adsorption, we have then employed eqn (11). Fig. 7 shows the Gibbs free adsorption energetics for the adsorption of TMA on the flat terrace. It can be noticed that a molecular adsorption (T1) is endothermic (+0.3 eV), and, contrary to what happens onto the different bare Al2O3 substrate,29 a stabilisation through decomposition (T2) is precluded (+0.8 eV). As a consequence, at typical ALD conditions, the desorbed configuration (T0) will be the most stable, with TMA being unreactive towards anatase (101).

Fig. 8 illustrates the Gibbs free adsorption energies on step D. As anticipated, despite the molecular adsorption being still endothermic (S1), here, the presence of neighboring H2O molecules leads to striking differences. Provided the reaction barrier is not too high, water molecules can indeed react with TMA, making possible the elimination of a CH4 group (S2). It is the desorption of this CH4 which allows negative Gibbs free adsorption energies to be reached. S3 (dashed line at −0.8 eV) and S4 free energy levels have been further stabilised by the rearrangements of the remaining Al(CH3)2. From S4, a second methyl group can desorb (S5), bringing to a final stabilisation of −1.7 eV compared to the desorbed state S0. Accordingly, at the end of the TMA pulse, we predict the step D to be in configurations S3 and S5, i.e. covered by a mixture of Al(CH3)2 and AlCH3 groups ready to react with the subsequent water pulse of the second ALD half-reaction.

Together, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 help to understand the growth mechanism of the Al2O3 ALD on anatase (101). After the first half-reaction, some Al ions are retained only in proximity of steps D, which act as nucleation centres. These findings agree with the experimental observation of an island growth mode,35,36,50 which imposes a lower bound of 5–10 layers to the number of ALD cycles, if a uniform coating is to be obtained.
It is worth noting that at a given temperature and pressure, the only factor influencing the coverage of water is its adsorption energy (around 0.7–0.8 eV on the terrace, above 1 eV on step D). We have carried out additional calculations on adsorption of water near subsurface Ti interstitials and O vacancies, obtaining adsorption energies above 1 eV. This suggests that, after the hydration of the surface, water is retained also at these sites. Therefore, it is likely that subsurface point defects have a role similar to step D, acting as nucleation sites where TMA is adsorbed and stabilised with an analogous mechanism.
4. Conclusions
We have investigated, by means of DFT calculations, the water pulse and the subsequent first half-reaction of Al2O3 ALD on anatase (101). Our results predict that, at typical ALD working conditions, one should expect no water coverage on a flat terrace. On the contrary, in proximity to the very common step D (but also of O vacancies and Ti interstitials), due to the higher adsorption energy, water is retained. Depending on the availability of water, and hence on the adsorption site, different pathways are possible after the TMA pulse. On the flat terrace, a desorption is favoured over adsorption. At defects, the endothermic chemisorption can be stabilised by the elimination of one or two CH4 after the interaction of TMA with adjacent H2O molecules. Our results can explain the experimental difficulties faced in depositing continuous single layers of Al2O3 on TiO2 anatase. Lower temperature conditions could prevent the desorption of water from the substrate and, in principle, promote a uniform growth, although at the expenses of slower ALD reaction rates. Alternatively, increasing water partial pressure may lead to a substrate with a larger number of reactive sites, a key ingredient to the ALD success, vital in turn to the achievement of higher PCEs in Al2O3 coated DSSCs.
