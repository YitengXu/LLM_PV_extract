In this paper, we demonstrated an SBA-15 confined synthetic approach to prepare TNO nanoparticles (S-TNO) with a small particle size around 10 nm and a large BET surface area of 79.5 m2 g−1. It is worth mentioning that this is the smallest size reported so far for TNO. In contrast, the TNO (L-TNO) synthesized without SBA-15 has a particle size above 100 nm and a BET surface area of only 4.3 m2 g−1. The S-TNO shows better lithium-ion storage properties than L-TNO. The excellent electrochemical performance of S-TNO is attributed to its small crystalline size, which not only provides a larger effective area for better contact between the electrode material and the electrolyte, but also reduces the rate-limiting Li diffusion path. Moreover, S-TNO shows a high Coulombic efficiency (above 98% over 300 cycles) and negligible increase of impedance after cycling, which confirms no SEI layer formation in the operational voltage (1–3 V) of TNO.1. IntroductionShrinking supply of fossil fuels and the problems associated with global warming have stimulated the development of environmentally friendly plug-in hybrid and electrical vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy (e.g., wind and solar). Both EVs and renewable energy applications rely heavily on advanced energy storage and conversion techniques. Lithium-ion batteries are considered as the most promising choice because of their light weight, long life span, and high energy density.1–6 However, safety issues linked to lithium dendrites remain a big challenge. Furthermore, the current commercial anode material, graphite, fails to meet the requirements of large-scale energy storage due to its low theoretical capacity and relatively slow kinetics at high power.7,8 The staged insertion of Li ions into graphite (C to LiC6) has a flat voltage around 0.2 V versus Li+/Li0. The low flat voltage leads to decomposition of the liquid-carbonate electrolyte and formation of a thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer.9 SEI layers are observed not only in graphite but also in other anode materials with redox potential less than 1.0 V. Though the SEI layer is permeable to lithium ions and can protect the active materials inside, it irreversibly consumes a large amount of Li ions from the cathode in the initial charge cycle.10,11 More seriously, it causes the formation of dendrites during fast charging when the rate of lithium ion transfer across SEI is not fast enough to avoid lithium plating out on the SEI.9 The resulting dendrites can cause short circuit in the battery.12 Therefore, it is crucial to develop new anode materials with higher charging potential to avoid formation of dendritic lithium and ensure safe operation.Because of the scarcity of potential candidates, spinel Li4Ti5O12 with a high voltage of the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple (ca. 1.5 V vs. Li+/Li) exceeding the potential of SEI layer formation has been studied extensively and demonstrated to have a fast charging rate and excellent structural and chemical stabilities.13–18 However, its low theoretical capacity (175 mA h g−1) has hindered its practical application in EVs.8,9 Recently, TiNb2O7 (TNO) has attracted great research interest; it is believed that the disordered Nb and Ti atoms and 2D interstitial space existing in the monoclinic layered structure of TNO offer spaces up to 5-lithium insertion per unit formula.8,9 The 5-electron transfer reaction (Ti4+/Ti3+, Nb5+/Nb3+) not only delivers a higher theoretical capacity of 387.6 mA h g−1, more than two times that of Li4Ti5O12, but also exhibits an operational voltage larger than 1.0 V (versus Li+/Li0), which should prevent the formation of the SEI layer.8,9,19Goodenough et al. proposed TNO as a promising new candidate for anode in Li-ion batteries in 2011.9 In the same year, Lu et al. systematically investigated the lithium storage mechanism of this material on the atomic scale both experimentally and computationally.19 These seminal studies have established a solid foundation for further study but, unfortunately, very few reports on this material are currently available. Only very recently, Maier et al. have reported on TNO in an interesting 1D nano-pearl string morphology that allowed achieving stable cycle performance and high rate capability.8 Reducing the particle size and coating them by carbon layers have been regarded as very effective routes for improving electrochemical performance.20–23 Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the carbon coated nanoparticulate TNO showed good performance.9 Unfortunately, no effort has been made on reducing the particle size of TNO to achieve a shortened lithium diffusion distance. For example, a particle size of more than 150 nm was observed in Goodenough's work,9 50–200 nm in 1D-nano-pearl-string,8 and 20 μm in Lu's work.19 Another concern is that the reported data, obtained in a limited cycle number (<150 cycles), may not be sufficient for evaluating the long-term performance of the electrode material.Therefore, in this paper, we focus on minimizing the particle size of TNO down to ∼10 nm via the confinement of mesochannels inside SBA-15 mesoporous silica, which is one of the most well-known templates for the synthesis of mesoporous carbon, oxides, and sulphides.24–26 The prepared TNO shows improved performance compared to the reported data in the literature, and retains a capacity of 175 mA h g−1 comparable to the theoretical capacity of Li4Ti5O7 even after 300 charge and discharge cycles at a current density of 1 C (387 mA g−1). Excellent rate performance is also demonstrated with negligible capacity decay after cycling at different current densities up to 50 cycles. For comparison, TNO prepared without SBA-15 shows fast-fading cyclic performance even at a very low current density, 0.1 C, and large fluctuations of cyclic capacity at 1 C. The result indicates that reducing the particle size could be another powerful approach for improving the electrochemical property of TNO.2. Experimental section2.1 Preparation of SBA-15SBA-15 was prepared via a modified procedure adapted from the literature.27 Briefly, 4.05 g of triblock copolymer P123 (EO20PO70EO20) was dissolved in 73.4 ml de-ionized water (DI water), to which 2.2 g of concentrated HCl (37%) was added and the solution was stirred at 35 °C for 12 h. After addition of 8 g of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 98%), the stirring was extended for another 20 h at 35 °C. The resulting suspension was transferred into an autoclave and kept at 130 °C for 24 h. The product was filtered, washed with 1 M HCl and calcined at 550 °C in air for 5 h.2.2 Preparation of TiNb2O7 samplesIn a typical process, 0.54 g NbCl5 was dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol with vigorous stirring. After the solution turned clear, 0.302 ml of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%) was added. The mixed solution was stirred for 1 h and 0.50 g of SBA-15 was subsequently added. The solution was stirred for an additional 24 h and dried at room temperature for 5 days. The impregnation process was repeated one more time. The resulting powder was heated to 50 °C and kept for 3 h to further remove ethanol. Finally, the sample was heated to 1000 °C at the rate of 2 °C min−1 and kept at this temperature for 5 h in air. SBA-15 was removed in 2 M NaOH prepared in a DI water–ethanol mixture (1:1 by volume). The regular TNO nanoparticles were obtained in the same procedure but without the addition of SBA-15. For convenience, the SBA-15 confined TNO with a smaller particle size is noted as “S-TNO”; the regular one prepared without SBA-15 and having a larger particle size is noted as “L-TNO”.2.3 CharacterizationThe structure, composition, and morphology of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Miniflex-II with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation, 30 kV/15 mA current and kβ-filter), transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL-2010, 200 kV), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-3400NII). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of the samples was determined by using an ASAP 2020 using the standard N2 adsorption and desorption isotherm measurements at 77 K. Electrochemical measurements were conducted using CR-2032 coin cells. The working electrode was prepared by casting the slurry (70 wt% of active materials, 20 wt% of carbon black, and 10 wt% of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone) onto nickel foam, and dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 12 h to remove the solvent. All the samples were weighed by using a microbalance (Denver Instrument SI-215D) with an accuracy of 0.01 mg. The loading weight for the electrodes is around 1 mg. Lithium foil was used as the counter electrode and a mixture of 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)–dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 by volume) was used as the electrolyte. Cell assembly was carried out in an argon-filled glovebox with oxygen concentration below 1 ppm. The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed using a Land battery testing system in the cutoff voltage window of 1–3 V (vs. Li+/Li). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance were performed using a Princeton Applied Research Versa STAT4 electrochemical workstation and a CHI-680A (CH Instruments, Inc.) workstation, respectively.3. Results and discussionThe XRD patterns of S-TNO and L-TNO are shown in Fig. 1(a). All diffraction peaks of the two samples can be assigned to monoclinic TNO (JCPDS 70-2009). No other phases can be detected. The S-TNO has slightly broader peaks, indicating a smaller particle size. Using Scherrer's equation,D = 0.89λ/βcosθthe grain size, D, can be calculated, where factor 0.89 is characteristic of spherical objects, λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the fullwidth at half-maximum of the diffraction peaks, and θ is the diffraction peak angle. For S-TNO, the average grain size was calculated to be 10.2 nm, which is in good agreement with the TEM analysis. The Scherrer's equation is applied on L-TNO, and the size calculated is ∼24 nm, which is inconsistent with TEM results. From Fig. 2(a) and S2(a),† we can see that the L-TNO samples show an irregular shape, wide size distribution with majority larger than 100 nm. And the Scherrer's equation is only applicable to nanoparticles (<100 nm). N2 adsorption/desorption measurement was conducted to study the specific surface area of the samples. Calculated from the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms (Fig. 1(b)), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of S-TNO is 79.5 m2 g−1, tenth of SBA-15 (780.8 m2 g−1, Fig. S1(a)†), while L-TNO shows a dramatically smaller BET surface area of only 4.3 m2 g−1 (isotherm shown in Fig. S1(b)†). Noticeably, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm profile of S-TNO shows the presence of mesopores in the sample, and due to the nature of small nanoparticles, the voids are considered as inter particles. Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns of L-TNO and S-TNO compared to literature data for monoclinic TNO; (b) N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of S-TNO at 77 K.  Fig. 2  TEM images of (a) L-TNO; (b) S-TNO; (c) high resolution image of S-TNO, and the inset illustrates the confined growth of S-TNO; (d) the lattice fringes of S-TNO. The TEM images of the two samples confirm the much larger size of nanoparticles for L-TNO via non-confined preparation (see Fig. 2(a) and S2(a)†), majority of them have diameters over 100 nm. In comparison, S-TNO (Fig. 2(b)) exhibits more uniform size distribution with a particle size of about 10 nm. Note that this SBA-15 confined synthesis of S-TNO has the smallest particle size of TNO reported so far. More than 150 nm was observed in Goodenough's work,9 50–200 nm in 1D-nano-pearl-string,8 and 20 μm in Lu's work.19 The significantly reduced particle size in our case of S-TNO is attributed to the confinement effect of mesochannels inside SBA-15 (see Fig S2(b)†). The size of mesochannels is ∼11 nm measured from the TEM image, which is in agreement with the size, 11.8 nm, obtained from BJH absorption (the inset of Fig. S1(a)†). A schematic illustration proposed in the inset of Fig. 2(c) suggests a possible growth mechanism of particles inside SBA-15 channels. During the calcination step, the particles grow from amorphous solid solution of the precursors inside the channels. It may initiate at the wall or in the center. In either case, particles grow isotropically first, and once the particles reach the diameter of the channel in size, they can grow further only along the axis of the channel. This explains why S-TNO particles have an oval shape, as shown in Fig. 2(c), where two straight dashed lines highlight the two sides of the particle against the wall of the channel, and the two curved ends are towards the opening ends of channels. It is possible that some precursor solution may adhere onto the surface of the template. But the amount should be extremely limited. One reason is that the external surface is much smaller than the internal surface of channels; the other is that the channels can easily trap solution inside. If indeed a large amount of precursor solution could stay on the external surface, there must be another morphology (especially larger size) of the S-TNO particles due to the confinement-free growth. However, we did not observe that in TEM images. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that channels are the dominant reaction sites. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2(d) shows the lattice fringes of S-TNO with the spacing of 3.42 Å, which is in good agreement with the (300) interplanar distance of TNO.The as-prepared materials were assembled into half-cells and evaluated by galvanic charging/discharging in the voltage range of 1–3 V (vs. Li+/Li), as shown in Fig. 3(a). The lower potential end, 1 V, was chosen to avoid formation of the SEI layer. The voltage profiles for S-TNO only gradually change at a current density of 1 C with increasing number of cycles. The initial discharge capacity of 213 mA h g−1 is very close to the charge capacity of 210 mA h g−1, giving a very high Coulombic efficiency of 98%. The high initial Coulombic efficiency indicates no formation of the SEI layer and thus no irreversible consumption of lithium ions. In the 2nd and 3rd cycles, the discharge capacities of 215 and 213 mA h g−1 were measured, while the corresponding charge capacities were 210 and 209 mA h g−1, respectively. The capacity close to that of the first cycle suggests very good stability of S-TNO. Regular L-TNO (Fig. 3(b)) shows capacity values much lower than those of S-TNO. For example, the first discharge capacity, 98 mA h g−1, is less than a half of that of S-TNO (213 mA h g−1). Additionally, longer lithium ion diffusion paths due to the larger particle size in L-TNO lead to noticeable fluctuations, especially after 300 cycles, whereas the voltage curve of S-TNO stays smooth. Greater fluctuations in L-TNO suggest worse stability of the electrode material.28 Fig. 3  (a) Voltage profile for S-TNO at 1 C; (b) voltage profile for L-TNO at 1 C; (c) cycle performance of L-TNO and S-TNO at 1 C along with their Coulombic efficiency; (d) rate performance of S-TNO; (e) cyclic voltammetry profiles of S-TNO. The cyclic performance of S-TNO and L-TNO samples at the current density of 1 C in the voltage window of 1–3 V is displayed in Fig. 3(c). As can be seen, the cyclic performance curve of L-TNO observed at a large current density of 1 C is very bumpy, while a smooth but precipitously declining one was observed at the lower current density of 0.1 C (inset of Fig. S3†), which again indicates that the large particle size (i.e., long diffusion path) hinders fast lithium ion transfer. The result that L-TNO fades faster at a lower C rate (0.1 C) may be due to the larger activation extent of active materials. Each cycle lasts longer at a lower C rate, vice versa, which suggests that at a lower C rate, the active electrode materials are almost activated in the first few cycles, while with a larger C rate, it takes more cycles to activate those large particles of L-TNO. In both cases, volume expansion induced from the insertion and extraction of Li ions only leads to the decay of those activated particles of L-TNO. Therefore, the highly activated active materials at a lower C rate show higher specific capacity but faster fading; the partially activated active materials at a higher C rate demonstrate lower specific capacity but slower fading due to the remaining intact materials. In contrast, improved lithium ion transfer kinetics in S-TNO results in more stable and higher cyclic performance at both low (0.1 C, Fig. S3†) and high C rates (1 C, Fig. 3(c)). For example, it has the specific capacity of 208, 198, 189, 180, and 175 mA h g−1 at 1 C even at the 20th, 50th, 100th, 200th, and 300th cycle, respectively, which is much higher than the corresponding ones for L-TNO (140, 145, 132, 100, and 90 mA h g−1) and the theoretical capacity of Li4Ti5O12 (175 mA h g−1). Compared with the only three available literature results for TNO,8,9,19 the capacity of S-TNO demonstrates one of the best performances. A specific capacity of ∼200 mA h g−1 was observed after 10 cycles at a current density of 0.1 C,9 while S-TNO retains ∼250 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at different current densities up to 10 C and finally back to 0.5 C (Fig. 3(d)), which is almost the same as that after 20 cycles at a lower current density of 0.1 C in ref. 19. In a very recent published study, a capacity of 250 mA h g−1, observed after 50 cycles at the current density of 1 C,8 is slightly better than the result reported here (we see ∼200 mA h g−1 under similar conditions), which may be due to the advantages of its 1D nano-pearl-string structure. But the capacity retention (93%) and Coulombic efficiency (99.8%) of our S-TNO after 50 cycles are higher than the capacity retention of 92% and Coulombic efficiency of 97% for the nano-pearl string TNO after 50 cycles,8 and the initial Coulombic efficiency of 93% and the capacity retention of 96% after 20 cycles in Lu’s work (lower than 97.5% of S-TNO after 20 cycles).19 Noticeably, the Coulombic efficiency of S-TNO in Fig. 3(c) remaining above 98% during the total of 300 cycles is the highest reported value so far. The high Coulombic efficiency is attributed to the shortened lithium ion diffusion path due to the smallest particle size. The result that a 1D nano-pearl string shows a higher capacity while S-TNO reported in this paper gives a better capacity retention and a higher Coulombic efficiency suggests that smaller sized 1D TNO nanostructures are desirable for the application as an electrode material.The rate performance of S-TNO evaluated at different current densities is displayed in Fig. 3(d). As expected, the specific capacity decreased with increasing current density: the electrode delivered a capacity of ∼250 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C, ∼230 mA h g−1 at 1 C, ∼203 mA h g−1 at 2 C, ∼176 mA h g−1 at 3 C, ∼130 mA h g−1 at 5 C, and ∼76 mA h g−1 at 10 C, respectively. When the current density was changed back to 0.5 C, the specific capacity rebound to ∼250 mA h g−1, showing negligible capacity loss. Owing to the small nanoparticle size, the S-TNO demonstrates excellent rate performance and capacity retention ability. The small crystalline size of TNO not only provides larger effective area for a better contact between electrode materials and electrolyte, but also reduces the rate-limiting Li diffusion path, both contributing to faster charge transfer.20,29Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to better understand the redox reactions taking place at the electrodes. The first five cycles (Fig. 3(e)) for S-TNO were recorded at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage window of 1–3 V vs. Li+/Li. Two sharp redox peaks located at ∼1.68 V (anodic) and 1.57 V (cathodic) were attributed to the valence variation of Nb5+/Nb4+.8,30,31 The shoulder–peak pair (anodic 1.57 V, cathodic 1.51 V) corresponds to the different niobium states in TNO.8 The broad bumps within 1–1.4 V are caused by the Nb4+/Nb3+ redox couple.8,19,30,31 Another broader and less obvious pair of peaks (anodic ∼1.85 V, cathodic ∼1.76 V) is due to the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple.8,19 Noticeably, the phenomenon that the location of peaks in the initial cycle differs from that in the subsequent cycles can be explained by electronic structural change of TiNb2O7 upon insertion of Li ions.19 Moreover, all curves after the first cycle almost overlap, suggesting excellent cyclability and good kinetics at the electrode.29,32To investigate the interfacial properties, especially SEI formation of the materials, electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded for fresh coin cells and coin cell cycled in the voltage window of 1–3 V and 0–3 V after 5 charge and discharge cycles for both materials. As seen in Fig. 4(a), the Nyquist plots for both material electrodes consist of a semicircle with the charge-transfer resistance at the electrode interface, while the straight line (Warburg line) in the low frequency region is related to lithium ion diffusion.33 In all three cases, S-TNO has smaller semicircles than L-TNO, in other words, smaller charge transfer resistance at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode. For both L-TNO and S-TNO, the Nyquist plots for fresh electrodes and those cycled at 1–3 V for 5 cycles almost overlap in the high frequency region (semicircle region), indicating no increase of resistance even after cycling. However, the electrodes cycled in 0–3 V range after 5 cycles show much larger resistance (larger semicircles) due to the formation of SEI layers. It is well known that the SEI layer can increase charge-transfer resistance due to the disconnection of the charge-transfer pathway.34 Not only does the SEI layer increase the cell impedance, it also irreversibly consumes Li ions from the cathode, which usually has a very limited number of Li ions inserted in the crystallographic structure (e.g., LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiFePO4).9–11 This severe irreversible consumption can be further verified in Fig. 4(b): the S-TNO tested at 1–3 V shows very steady cyclic capacity and has a Coulombic efficiency above 98% even at the initial cycle. However, when tested in 0–3 V range, because of excessive lithium ion consumption by SEI, it shows much higher but fast decreasing capacity. The first cycle Coulombic efficiency (inset of Fig. 4(b)) in the latter case is less than 80% due to the formation of SEI layers. Though its Coulombic efficiency gradually increases, it is still lower than that of the cell tested in 1–3 V range. The TEM image of S-TNO after cycling in the inset of Fig. 4(b) shows that the nanoparticles have very smooth surface, confirming no SEI layers formed. Moreover, the particles remain intact, again confirming good structural stability. The big chunk located on the top of the figure is the composites of carbon black and PVDF polymer. Therefore, to minimize the charge transfer resistance and maximize the Coulombic efficiency, it is beneficial to employ materials with redox potentials above 1 V (e.g. TiNb2O7).

ConclusionIn summary, we have demonstrated a SBA-15 confined route to synthesize TNO with particle size around 10 nm, which is the smallest reported so far. The TNO prepared without SBA-15 shows a large particle size above 100 nm and a low BET surface area of 4.3 m2 g−1 (18 times lower than that of S-TNO, 79.5 m2 g−1). Owing to the increased effective electrode–electrolyte contact area and the shortened rate-limiting lithium ion diffusion path contributed from its small particle size and large surface area, S-TNO demonstrates high specific capacities, fast charge and discharge rate, and stable cycle performance. Moreover, the inherent advantage that TNO shows a flat voltage above 1 V, where the SEI layer does not form, allows elimination of the lithium dendrite formation. Therefore, it shows great potential as an anode material in high power lithium ion batteries.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the funding support from NSF under Grant no. 1131290.
