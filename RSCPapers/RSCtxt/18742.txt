    , Accepted 27th September 2016First published on 27th September 2016AbstractCocatalysts are one essential factor for promoting the photoelectrochemical water oxidation efficiency of photoanodes, but the influence of interface charge transfer between the semiconductor and cocatalyst has been rarely addressed. Due to their poor charge conductivity, the application of many metal oxides as cocatalysts has been limited. In this work, using photoanode Ti/Fe2O3 and cocatalyst CoOx as a model system, we elaborately design a charge transfer channel of metal Co between the photoanode and cocatalyst. Such a ternary nanostructure has proved to possess several advantageous features, including effective charge separation efficiency, long lifetime of photogenerated holes, and fast charge transport from the photoanode to the surface of the cocatalyst. Benefiting from these desirable nanostructures, the photoanode, containing a charge transfer channel of metal Co, exhibited a remarkable photoelectrochemical performance for water oxidation, with an almost 7-fold enhancement in the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE under visible light illumination and about a 0.15 V water oxidation onset potential negative shift compared to the Ti/Fe2O3 photoanode. These findings demonstrate that the successful construction of a metallic charge transfer channel between the photoanode and cocatalyst should be employed as a general strategy for photoconversion applications.
1. Introduction
The rapid consumption of fossil fuels and serious environmental pollution make the development of clean energy a global challenge.1–4 The solar energy cast onto the Earth’s surface far exceeds the world's current energy depletion and continuous growing energy requirements, which means that solar energy conversion is an ideal pathway to satisfy the world's energy demands.5 In this regard, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, direct conversion of solar energy to chemical fuels (H2 and O2), is one of the promising approaches to meet our need for abundant sources of clean energy in the future. The development of efficient photoanodes and perfecting the theory of PEC water splitting is still a hot topic from over the past 40 years since the foundation work by Fujishima and Honda.6
One of the key elements in an efficient PEC system is a suitable electrocatalyst deposited on a photoanode.7 Many cocatalysts have been reported to enhance the PEC water splitting activity of photoanodes, such as IrO2, Co–Pi, CoOx, NiOOH and NiOxetc.8–13 Despite intensive efforts in the recent development of various cocatalysts, promoting the transport of photogenerated charge carriers is still a challenging task. Charge carrier transport plays a central role in semiconductor-based PEC reactions.14 Under light irradiation, only those photogenerated charge carriers that can transfer to the surface of the electrodes could drive the PEC water oxidation reaction. Therefore, two essential criteria should be considered for the construction of an ideal cocatalyst. The first one is that it should reduce the overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which leads to an improvement in the hole transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. Secondly, efficient transport of minority charges (holes) to the cocatalyst surface but of majority charges (electrons) to the photoanode substrate is desirable. As the cocatalysts employed for the PEC reaction usually originate from excellent electrocatalysts,15–18 the first criterion has been frequently mentioned in previous reports.8,10,19–21 Meanwhile, more recent reports have strongly recommended that the second criterion should also be put on the agenda. That is to say, the charge transfer process occurring at the semiconductor and cocatalyst interface should be improved.14,22–26 Recently, p-type metal oxides, such as NiOx and CoOx, have been expected to achieve a p–n junction with a photoanode to form directed charge transport, while also acting as effective oxygen evolution cocatalysts.20,27,28 However, due to the limited charge carrier conductivity of metal oxides, a formidable resistance for charge transport from the interface side to the surface side of the cocatalyst is usually introduced when the cocatalyst is loaded. Therefore, controlling the thickness or the size of the cocatalyst down to a few nanometers is a common strategy to reduce the transfer resistance of photogenerated holes.27,29 However, the primary driving force for charge transfer from the photoanode to cocatalyst is the interfacial electric field. If the size of the cocatalyst continuously decreases to a few nanometers, the intensity of the interfacial electric field would be gradually weakened, which is undesirable for the enhancement of charge separation efficiency.
Herein, we propose the concept of the fabrication of a metallic charge transfer channel between the photoanode and metal oxide cocatalyst to meet the above-mentioned two valuable criteria simultaneously. Hematite has been shown to be a good model system to study the dynamic process of water oxidation and the electrocatalyst CoOx has been extensively used as a cocatalyst for PEC water oxidation.30–34 Therefore, Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 (Ti/Fe2O3) was employed as the model photoanode and CoOx as a model cocatalyst in this study. The charge carrier conductivity of the p-type semiconductor CoOx (∼10−4 S cm−1) is similar to that of Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 (Ti/Fe2O3) (∼10−4 S cm−1) and much lower than that of metal Co (∼106 S cm−1).35–39 We elaborately design and construct a charge transfer channel of metal Co experimentally between Ti/Fe2O3 and CoOx (core–shell Co/CoOx).
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy, and SPV transient measurement were used to demonstrate that both the CoOx and core–shell Co/CoOx could enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and prolong their lifetimes. Mott–Schottky plots, accumulated charge density measurements, photocurrent transient measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results further demonstrate that the metallic charge transfer channel of Co can make the photogenerated holes transfer to the surface of CoOx more rapidly and take part in the water splitting reaction more easily. However, without the metallic charge transfer channel within the CoOx-modified Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, most of the photogenerated holes could just be accumulated at the interface between CoOx and hematite. Experimentally, it was observed that core–shell Co/CoOx-modified Ti/Fe2O3 exhibited sustained O2 evolution with a ∼700% enhancement at 1.23 V vs. RHE and a ∼600% enhancement at 1.5 V vs. RHE over the parent Ti/Fe2O3 photoanodes. These findings demonstrate that the introduction of a metallic charge transfer channel could be a general strategy for PEC water splitting.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of photoanodes
Ti/Fe2O3 photoanodes were fabricated according to our previous report.40 Typically, 1 mL 0.025% (volume percentage) TiCl4 (99%, Sinoreagent Co., Ltd) ethanol solution was added in 30 mL aqueous solution containing 0.15 M FeCl3·6H2O (99%, Aladdin) and 1 M NaNO3 (99%, Sinoreagent Co., Ltd). The mixed solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave. A fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass) of 1 × 2.5 cm was cleaned with deionized water, ethanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate and placed in the Teflon liner. The Teflon-lined autoclave was sealed and maintained at 100 °C for 12 h. Finally, the obtained Ti/Fe2O3 film was thoroughly washed with deionized water and annealed in air at 550 °C for 2 h.
For preparation of the metal Co-modified Ti/Fe2O3 photoanode (Co–Ti/Fe2O3), 2 mg cobalt(III) 2,4-pentanedionate (98%, Aladdin) was dispersed in 30 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (99.5%, Sinoreagent Co., Ltd). The obtained solution was then transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave. A Ti/Fe2O3 film was placed in the Teflon liner and maintained at 200 °C for 10 h. The film was washed with absolute ethanol and then dried at 80 °C under N2 flow. The Co–Ti/Fe2O3 film was annealed at 250 °C in air for 1 h to obtain the core–shell Co/CoOx-modified Ti/Fe2O3 electrode (Co250–Ti/Fe2O3) and annealed at 550 °C in air for 2 h to obtain the CoOx-modified Ti/Fe2O3 electrode (Co550–Ti/Fe2O3).
2.2 Characterization
XL 30 ESEM FEG field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Company) was used to characterize the morphologies of the samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed on a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with monochromatized Al Kα excitation.
PL spectra were obtained on a FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) in air at room temperature. The lock-in amplifier-based SPV measurement and SPV transient measurement were carried out on home-made systems, which have been described previously.41 Typically, the SPV measurement system is constituted of a 500 W xenon lamp (LSH-X500, Zolix), a grating monochromator (Omni-5007, Zolix), a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP, Stanford) with a light chopper (SR540, Stanford), a photovoltaic cell, and a computer. A low chopping frequency of 23 Hz was used in the conventional testing. The SPV transient measurement system is constituted of a Nd:YAG laser (Q-smart 450, Quantel), a digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix) and a photovoltaic cell. The work function measurement was carried out on a Kelvin probe instrument (SKP 5050, KP Technology Ltd, Scotland, UK).
2.3 Photoelectrochemical experiments
Current density vs. applied potential (J–V) curves were measured with an electrochemical analyzer (LK2006A, Lanlike) using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. The applied potential used in this paper was converted to be versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the Nernst equation:ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.0591 × pH + 0.1976 V
An aqueous solution of 1 M NaOH was used as the electrolyte (pH = 13.6). The light source was provided by a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300, Trusttech) with a UV cutoff filter (≥center wavelength 420 nm, band width 10 nm), and the visible light intensity was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2.
For the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements, monochromatic light was provided by light emission from a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300, Trusttech) passing through a grating monochromator (Omni-5007, Zolix). The intensity of the monochromated light was measured using an irradiatometer (FZ-A, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University). The IPCE values were calculated using the following equation:  where J is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Pmono is the light power intensity (mW cm−2) of the monochromatic light, and λ is the wavelength of incident light (nm).
The Mott–Schottky calculations were derived from impedance measurements in the dark at 1000 Hz. The donor concentration (Nd) and flat band potential (Vfb) can be quantified by the Mott–Schottky equation:1/C2 = (2/eε0εNd)[(V − Vfb) − KT/e]where C is the capacitance of the space charge region, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ε is the dielectric constant of α-Fe2O3, e is the electron charge, V is the electrode applied potential, K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Nd is the donor concentration. The donor concentration is calculated with the equation:Nd = (2/eε0ε)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1
Accumulated charge density measurements were obtained by integration of the initial current spike. Laser-excited photocurrent transient measurements were carried out on a home-made two-electrode system as shown in Fig. S1.† The electrodes were excited with a Nd:YAG laser (Q-smart 450, Quantel) using a Pt wire as the counter electrode. The signals were recorded using a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix). The Nyquist plots calculated from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed from 100000 to 0.05 Hz under visible light illumination.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of loaded Co species
In order to fabricate the metallic charge transfer channel of Co between photocatalyst Ti/Fe2O3 and cocatalyst CoOx, a thin film Ti/Fe2O3 electrode was first modified with metal Co nanoparticles via a hydrothermal reduction reaction (Co–Ti/Fe2O3). The Co–Ti/Fe2O3 film was annealed at low temperature for a short time to form thin CoOx shells on Co nano-particles (Co250–Ti/Fe2O3). As a contrast, the Co–Ti/Fe2O3 sample was also treated at high temperature for a longer period to form completely oxidized CoOx nanoparticles (Co550–Ti/Fe2O3). The SEM images shown in Fig. 1a–c indicate the morphology change of the three electrodes. The Ti/Fe2O3 nanorod arrays are vertically grown on FTO glass and distinct nanoparticles could be observed for the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 samples. After increasing the content of cobalt(III) 2,4-pentanedionate in the hydrothermal reduction reaction, more nanoparticles with a larger size could be found in the SEM images as shown in Fig. S2† and the corresponding EDX spectra also demonstrate the existence of Co species.

To identify the existence of Co species, Fig. S3† illustrates the cyclic voltammograms of the Ti/Fe2O3 and Co–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes in 1.0 M NaOH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. No obvious oxidation or reduction peaks have been observed on the Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, while two pairs of redox peaks are obtained on the Co–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode. The redox peaks should be attributed to the Co(II)/Co(III) and Co(III)/Co(IV) redox couples respectively, which indicates that metal Co nanoparticles have been successfully loaded on the surface of the Ti/Fe2O3 electrode.42 Fig. S4† provides the XRD patterns of the electrodes before and after modification. Due to the low amount of modification, no diffraction peaks of Co or CoOx could be identified. Fig. S5† provides the XRD patterns of Co, Co250 and Co550 powder synthesized following the same procedure as that of the photoanodes but without the Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes. It is obvious that the emerging XRD peaks after the hydrothermal reaction can be indexed to the characteristics of metal Co (JPCDS 15-0806). After annealing at 250 °C in air for 1 h, some new weak peaks that can be indexed to the characteristics of Co3O4 could be found, but the main peaks are still attributed to metal Co, which indicates that core–shell Co/CoOx powder was obtained. After annealing at 550 °C in air for 2 h, almost all the peaks can be indexed to the characteristic ones of of Co3O4 (JPCDS 43-1003). These results indicate that our method for the fabrication of a core–shell Co/CoOx-modified Ti/Fe2O3 electrode is feasible.
The chemical states of Co atoms loaded on the Ti/Fe2O3 photoanodes were further detected by XPS as shown in Fig. 1d. For the Co–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, it is obvious that Co is in its metallic state after the hydrothermal reaction according to the previous reports.43,44 After heating from 250 °C to 550 °C, the main peaks shift to a higher binding energy gradually, which indicates a gradual conversion process of metal Co from the surface-oxidized state to the completely oxidized state.43 Furthermore, a weak shake-up satellite peak located at over 800 eV was obtained after annealing at 250 °C, which could also be attributed to the surface-oxidized process of metal Co. The intensity of the shake-up satellite peak became stronger after annealing at 550 °C, which provides additional evidence for the fact that metal Co is completely oxidized then.45 Raman spectra were collected to further prove the phase purity of Co species, as shown in Fig. S6.† All of the main peaks of Ti/Fe2O3 can be assigned to the α-Fe2O3 crystallographic phase.46 For the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, obvious Raman peaks at 674, 509 and 467 cm−1 can be assigned to Co3O4. These three peaks became weak for the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, which indicates that the metal Co has not been completely oxidized. The three peaks totally disappeared for the Co–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, which reveals the presence of zero-valent Co species.47 From the above experimental results, we could confirm that the Co–Ti/Fe2O3, Co250–Ti/Fe2O3, and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes are successfully modified with merely metal Co, core–shell Co/CoOx, and CoOx nanoparticles, respectively.
3.2 Assessment of the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers
The UV-vis transmittance spectra and the corresponding Tauc analysis are shown in Fig. S7.† The band gap energy of Ti/Fe2O3 is about 2.08 eV, which is in accordance with the typical band gap values of α-Fe2O3. After modification, the band gap energy changed a little to 2.06 eV. The PL measurements and the lock-in-based SPV measurements were carried out to explore the charge separation efficiency of the samples. It is generally accepted that for a similar composition of semiconductors, the higher the PL signal intensity is, the lower the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers is; in contrast, the higher the SPV response intensity is, the higher the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers is.48–50Fig. 2a shows the PL spectra of the Ti/Fe2O3, Co250–Ti/Fe2O3, and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes. All of the three samples exhibit obvious PL signals under 450 nm light excitation. The PL signal intensity decreased after the Ti/Fe2O3 was modified with core–shell Co/CoOx or CoOx nanoparticles. Similarly, the SPV responses of the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 and Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 samples, as shown in Fig. 2b, are much stronger than that of the Ti/Fe2O3 electrode. These results demonstrate that the photogenerated charge separation efficiency could be greatly improved with core–shell Co/CoOx or CoOx nanoparticle modification, and the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 sample reveals the best charge separation efficiency. Furthermore, the SPV spectra of the three samples show an obvious response under 300–600 nm light irradiation and all the SPV phase angles are around 0° (Fig. S8†), which indicates that the holes accumulate at the surface side of the samples.51–53 α-Fe2O3 is an n-type semiconductor with upward surface band bending, which makes the photogenerated holes transfer to the surface of the electrode under excitation. In addition, as shown in Fig. S9,† the undetectable SPV response proved that the separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers is extremely low in pure core–shell Co/CoOx or CoOx powder. Therefore, the significant enhancement of the SPV response in Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 and Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 should be attributed to the efficient hole collection effect of CoOx, which has been proven in our previous study.54 The interface electric field between Ti/Fe2O3 and core–shell Co/CoOx or CoOx is the main driving force for charge separation.

(b) Lock-in amplifier-based SPV spectra of Ti/Fe2O3, Co250–Ti/Fe2O3, and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 samples with a chopping frequency of 23 Hz. (c) SPV transient measurements of Ti/Fe2O3, Co250–Ti/Fe2O3, and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 samples under 20 mJ laser irradiation on a normal timescale (laser wavelength: 532 nm, pulse width: 5 ns). The inset shows the results of transient SPV measurements on a logarithmic time scale. (d) Work function mapping measurements of Co powder, CoOx powder, core–shell Co/CoOx powder coated on FTO glass, and the Ti/Fe2O3 electrode grown on FTO glass. 
Furthermore, SPV transient measurements were employed to study the dynamic properties of charge separation.55Fig. 2c provides the SPV transient results of Ti/Fe2O3, Co550–Ti/Fe2O3, and Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes under 532 nm (∼2.33 eV) pulse laser irradiation on a normal timescale and on a logarithmic time scale. It is clear that the total recombination time of the photogenerated charge carriers could be greatly prolonged from 1 × 10−3 s to 3 × 10−2 s after modification with pure core–shell Co/CoOx or CoOx nanoparticles. The photovoltage response intensity of the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 sample is about 1.5 times stronger than that of Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 and 3 times stronger than that of the Ti/Fe2O3 sample. Furthermore, the photovoltage response of the Ti/Fe2O3 sample immediately reaches a maximum (2 × 10−7 s, peak 1) and then rapidly declines. However, the photovoltage response of the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 sample also immediately reaches a maximum (2 × 10−7 s, peak 1), but stably declines to another peak position (10−3 s, peak 2). Meanwhile, for the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 sample, the intensity is stably enhanced to a second peak position (6 × 10−4 s, peak 2). Both of the SPV responses of the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 samples vanish at 3 × 10−2 s. The two peaks for the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 samples reveal that there should be two photogenerated charge transfer processes occurring in sequence: (1) the photogenerated holes of Ti/Fe2O3 inject into the core–shell Co/CoOx or CoOx; and (2) the photogenerated holes are localized in the core–shell Co/CoOx or CoOx, while photogenerated electrons continue diffusing towards the bulk of Ti/Fe2O3, which is the so-called diffusion photovoltage.56,57 When the light irradiates the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 or Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 samples, electron–hole pairs could be separated, with the holes from Ti/Fe2O3 injected into the core–shell Co/CoOx or CoOx immediately, with a maximum separation efficiency (at about 2 × 10−7 s) due to the effect of the interface electric field. The photogenerated holes collected in CoOx have a long lifetime and the relative stable photovoltage intensity (at 3 × 10−7 s to 2 × 10−2 s) is reached, indicating the slow recombination process of charge carriers. After that, the photogenerated holes and electrons will totally recombine with each other. That is to say, the hole-collecting effect of the CoOx cocatalyst should be responsible for the stronger photovoltage intensity and long lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers.
Work function mapping measurements were carried out to provide information on the interface between Ti/Fe2O3 and core–shell Co/CoOx or pure CoOx. The work function (ϕ) of the Ti/Fe2O3 films, metal Co, core–shell Co/CoOx, and pure CoOx powder is measured by a Kelvin probe, and is indirectly provided by the CPDs between the samples and the Au probe. The ϕ values of the Ti/Fe2O3 films, metal Co, core–shell Co/CoOx and CoOx powder are calculated by the following equation:ϕsample = ϕAu + eCPD, (ϕAu = 5.1 eV)
Therefore, ϕTi/Fe2O3, ϕCo, ϕCo/CoOx, and ϕCoOx were determined as 4.85, 4.98, 5.19, and 5.41 eV, respectively. Based on the above experimental results and discussion, the interfacial electric field is the primary driving force for the charge separation. When core–shell Co/CoOx or CoOx is loaded on the surface of the Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, free electrons will transfer from Ti/Fe2O3 to the cocatalysts until the Fermi levels align, which will induce an interfacial electric field orienting from Ti/Fe2O3 towards the core–shell Co/CoOx or CoOx. It can be estimated that the magnitude of the interfacial electric field is about 0.34 V between Ti/Fe2O3 and the core–shell Co/CoOx cocatalyst, and 0.56 V between Ti/Fe2O3 and the CoOx cocatalyst. Therefore, the charge separation efficiency of Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 is higher than that of the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 sample.
3.3 PEC performance of the modified Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes
Based on the above discussion, one might postulate that the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode may exhibit the best efficiency for PEC water splitting, due to the long lifetime and best separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers. However, as the current density vs. applied potential (J–V) curves show in Fig. 3a, the photocurrent density of the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode is even lower than that of the Ti/Fe2O3 film. In contrast, J–V plots for the Ti/Fe2O3 and Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes are presented in Fig. 3b. It should be noted that the photocurrent density of the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode is nearly seven times higher than that of the pristine Ti/Fe2O3 film under visible light illumination. The Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode also shows a 0.15 V water oxidation onset potential shift compared with the Ti/Fe2O3 electrode. Fig. S12† shows the stability test of the Ti/Fe2O3 and Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 100 mW cm−2 visible light illumination and the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode also shows a favourable performance of photostability as good as that of the Ti/Fe2O3 film. Fig. 3c shows the IPCE results of the Ti/Fe2O3 and Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode exhibits about a 10 times enhancement at 430 nm and an 8 times enhancement at 390 nm of the IPCE value compared with that of the Ti/Fe2O3 electrode. These phenomena imply that the metal core of Co plays an important role in the process of photoelectrochemical water oxidation.

3.4 Effect of the metallic charge transfer channel in the water oxidation reaction
Mott–Schottky plots are displayed to preliminarily reveal the role of the metal Co at the photocatalyst Ti/Fe2O3 and cocatalyst CoOx interface. The modifications with core–shell Co/CoOx nanoparticles and CoOx nanoparticles make the Vfb shift 0.15 V and 0.25 V to the negative direction compared to the Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, which corresponds to the higher interface band bending after modification.58 The Nd values of Ti/Fe2O3 and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 were calculated to have a similar value of about 5.5 × 1018 cm−3, while the Nd value of Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 is 1.7 × 1020 cm−3. The great difference in Nd between the Ti/Fe2O3, Co550–Ti/Fe2O3, and Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes could be explained. As mentioned in the introduction, the charge carrier conductivities of the p-type semiconductor CoOx (∼10−4 S cm−1) and Ti/Fe2O3 (∼10−4 S cm−1) are quite similar, which results in the similar Nd values of the Ti/Fe2O3 and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes. Meanwhile the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode is modified with core–shell Co/CoOx and the charge carrier conductivity of metal Co (∼106 S cm−1) is much higher than that of CoOx and Ti/Fe2O3. Therefore, the Nd value of the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode is higher than that of the Ti/Fe2O3 and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes. These results further demonstrate that the metal Co has not been entirely oxidized for the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode. Due to the good conductivity, the metal Co between Ti/Fe2O3 and surface CoOx could serve as a charge transfer channel to make photogenerated holes transfer to the cocatalyst smoothly.
Light-chopping experiments were also performed for the Ti/Fe2O3 and Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes, and the chopped light J–V curves are shown in Fig. S13.† Obviously, a transient anodic photocurrent peak is observed when the light is turned on and a transient cathodic photocurrent peak is observed when the light is turned off.59 For further investigation, the chopped light current density vs. time (J–t) measurements at 0.9 V and 1.23 V vs. RHE for the three samples are collected (Fig. 4a). The Ti/Fe2O3 sample shows an obvious photocurrent peak upon exposure to light at 0.9 V vs. RHE. The positive current peaks upon switching the light on for the three electrodes indicate the hole accumulation process at the electrode surface without injection to the electrolyte. Similarly, the negative current peaks when turning the light off imply the back reaction of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band with the accumulated holes. When the Ti/Fe2O3 sample was exposed to light at 1.23 V vs. RHE, a steady photocurrent was observed following the photocurrent peak. The steady photocurrent response is a faradaic current, which reveals that the photogenerated holes were injected into the electrolyte, driving the water oxidation reaction. Meanwhile, the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 sample exhibits stronger positive photocurrent peaks both at 0.9 and 1.23 V vs. RHE, which indicates semiconductor/electrolyte systems with high injection barriers. As a contrast, the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 sample also shows a stronger positive photocurrent peak at a low potential (0.9 V vs. RHE), but the positive current peak disappeared at the higher potential (1.23 V vs. RHE). This phenomenon indicates that the injection barrier from the electrode to the electrolyte no longer existed at high potentials for the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 sample.

(b) Accumulated charge density as a function of applied potential, obtained by integration of the initial current spike.

(d) Nyquist plots of Ti/Fe2O3, Co250–Ti/Fe2O3, and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes. The measurements were carried out at 1.0 V vs. RHE under 100 mW cm−2 visible light illumination. The inset shows the zoomed-in view for the plots of the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes. 
It has been reported that the number of photogenerated holes accumulated at the electrode surface could be estimated by integrating the measured density of photocurrent peaks with respect to time.10,60 In order to calculate the accumulated positive charge density at different applied potentials, we measured the chopped light current density with 0.1 V steps and integrated the transient anodic photocurrent peaks as shown in Fig. 4b.61 There are many more holes accumulated at the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes’ surface compared with the Ti/Fe2O3 electrode at low potentials (<0.9 V vs. RHE), which should be attributed to the efficient hole collection process of the CoOx cocatalyst as mentioned above. However, at higher potentials, the amount of holes accumulated at the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode surface reduced sharply and the amount of holes accumulated at the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode surface reduced slowly. Therefore, we conclude that for the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode at higher potentials, photogenerated holes could rapidly transfer to the cocatalyst surface across the interfacial metal Co and nearly all of the holes that reach the surface participate in the water oxidation reaction. Meanwhile, for the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, most of the photogenerated holes could just be accumulated at the interface between Ti/Fe2O3 and CoOx, which impedes the transfer of holes from the electrode to the electrolyte to drive the water oxidation reaction.
To further illustrate the kinetics of charge transfer in these composite electrode systems, laser-excited photocurrent transients measurements were performed as shown in Fig. S1.†Fig. 4c shows the photocurrent transient measurements under laser pulse irradiation of 532 nm. The photocurrent responses of the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 sample immediately reach a maximum at about 5 μs (as shown in the inset figure), which is much faster than that of Ti/Fe2O3 (about 50 μs) and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 (about 30 μs). The Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 sample also exhibits the strongest photocurrent intensity and the longest duration of the photocurrent (about 2.5 ms) compared with Ti/Fe2O3 (about 1 ms) and Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 (about 0.75 ms). These results provide further evidence for the important charge transfer effect of intermediate metal Co. Under pulse laser illumination, for the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 sample, photogenerated holes of Ti/Fe2O3 could rapidly transfer to the cocatalyst CoOx surface across the charge transfer channel of metal Co, which leads to a rapid water oxidation reaction of the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 sample. Furthermore, the holes with a longer lifetime collected in the cocatalyst CoOx will continuously take part in the water oxidation reaction, which leads to a long duration of the photocurrent response. Meanwhile for the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 sample, photogenerated charge carriers could efficiently separate, but most of the photogenerated holes are just accumulated at the interface of Ti/Fe2O3 and CoOx, and could hardly transfer to the cocatalyst CoOx surface to take part in the water oxidation reaction. Therefore, the photocurrent transient response slowly rises up and quickly decays.
From the above discussion, the interfacial metal Co could act as an excellent charge transfer channel, which facilitates the photogenerated hole transfer to the surface of the cocatalyst efficiently. EIS results could provide additional evidence supporting this viewpoint. The arcs in the Nyquist plots are related to charge transfer from the photoelectrode to the electrolyte.62 A set of Nyquist plots of the three electrodes measured at 1.0 V vs. RHE under illumination is compared in Fig. 4d. For the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 sample, after modification with the CoOx cocatalyst, both of the low-frequency (high impedance) and high-frequency (low impedance) semicircles are much bigger than those of the bare Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, which indicates enormous transfer resistance for photogenerated holes from the electrode to the electrolyte. Nevertheless, for the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode with a metallic charge transfer channel, both of the two semicircles are significantly smaller than those of the bare Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, which provides further evidence for the excellent charge transfer performance of the interfacial metal Co.63 Complementary Nyquist plots of the three electrodes measured at 0.7 V, 1.0 V, and 1.3 V vs. RHE provide further information about the charge transfer process (Fig. S14†). These results demonstrate that the efficient charge separation in the Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode should be attributed to the interfacial electric field between the CoOx cocatalyst and photocatalyst Ti/Fe2O3. But, the interfacial electric field also hinders the holes from further transferring to the surface of the cocatalyst and most of the holes just accumulated at the interface between the cocatalyst and photocatalyst. Meanwhile, for the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode, the metallic charge transfer channel between the photocatalyst Ti/Fe2O3 and cocatalyst CoOx induces facile charge transport between the photoelectrode and electrolyte. In other words, the low photoelectrochemical activity of Co550–Ti/Fe2O3 is due to its poor charge transfer characteristics. Assisted by the metallic charge transfer channel, the Co250–Ti/Fe2O3 electrode presents a more unobstructed process of charge carrier transfer, as illustrated in Scheme 1. The sample thus exhibits the best activity in photoelectrochemical water oxidation.

4. Conclusions
Core–shell Co/CoOx and CoOx-modified Ti/Fe2O3 electrodes have been successfully fabricated. The role of the metallic Co charge transfer channel in the water oxidation reaction was investigated in terms of accumulated charge density, laser-excited photocurrent transient and PEIS measurements. It is demonstrated that both the core–shell Co/CoOx and CoOx cocatalyst could efficiently collect and store photogenerated holes from the hematite electrode. However, the CoOx cocatalyst just accumulated photogenerated holes at the interface between Ti/Fe2O3 and CoOx. The holes could hardly transfer to the surface of the CoOx cocatalyst, which resulted in the lowest water oxidation efficiency. Meanwhile, the core–shell Co/CoOx cocatalyst could allow the photogenerated holes to transfer across the charge transfer channel of metallic Co rapidly and arrive at the surface of the cocatalyst readily, which resulted in lower photocurrent onset potentials and hence water oxidation efficiency. It is proposed that the selected cocatalyst should not only facilitate the charge separation efficiency, but also favour the charge transfer to the surface of the cocatalyst. The strategy of constructing a metallic charge transfer channel proposed herein may be adopted as a general method in cocatalyst screening and systematic design towards enhanced PEC water splitting.
