    , Accepted 9th May 2016First published on 9th May 2016AbstractAs a precursor of perovskites, lead iodide (PbI2) is a typical layered material with a direct bandgap. Perovskites are widely utilized in highly efficient photovoltaics, but the low-dimensional PbI2 nanostructures and their (opto)electronic properties are rarely reported. Herein, single-crystalline PbI2 nanosheets (phase I) and nanowires (phase II) are controllably synthesized via a facile physical vapor deposition method. Their different crystal morphology and crystallographic symmetry show obvious phase dependence. The corresponding photodetectors on both SiO2/Si and flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates are investigated systematically. Compared with PbI2 nanowire based photodetectors, PbI2 nanosheet based photodetectors exhibit a relatively high sensitivity (with a high photoresponsivity of 147.6 A W−1 and fast response time) to the 450 nm laser. Both the PbI2 nanosheet and nanowire devices with flexible PET substrates exhibit comparable performance to their photodetectors fabricated on SiO2/Si, and also show excellent mechanical stability and durability. At the same time, the photoelectric properties vary greatly with different bending angles for such flexible PbI2 photodetectors. By modeling the band structures under different compressive strains, the theoretical simulations fit very well with experimental results. These findings provide a scientific basis for exploiting high-performance flexible photodetectors based on low-dimensional PbI2 single crystals.
1. Introduction
Flexible electronic devices (including flexible displays, thin film solar cells, transistors, energy-storage devices, photodetectors, and touch sensing and portable devices) have attracted tremendous interest due to their dominant properties of shock resistance, flexibility, lightweight and transparency.1–5 Among these (opto)electronic devices, flexible photodetectors which can convert light into electrical signals have been widely investigated due to their potential applications in both commercial and scientific fields, especially in video imaging, optical fiber communication, environmental monitoring, security surveillance and biomedical sensors.6–11 Recently, SiC,12 Si,6,9,11 ZnO13 and GaN14 based photodetectors have been extensively elaborated and commercialized. But their relatively low responsivity and external quantum efficiency, long response time, high dark currents and the rigorous growth conditions limit their commercial production.6,7,9,13,15 Developing suitable active materials is one of the main solutions to obtain high performance photodetectors.11,13 The low-dimensional nanostructured semiconductors have attracted wide attention due to their high surface-to-volume ratios and small Debye lengths.6,7,16,17 The typical low-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures for real utilization in functional devices usually contain one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) systems. 1D nanostructures, such as nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods and nanobelts/nanoribbons, have been extensively studied in photodetectors.13,18–20 At the same time, 2D materials are considered to be the ideal candidates for versatile photoelectronics. Recently, many 2D materials, such as graphene,21 layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)17,22–24 and other trichalcogenide compounds (Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3etc.),25–27 have been utilised in different micro/nano-electronic devices including photodetectors, and they show unique optical and electrical properties compared with the corresponding bulk components. To achieve high sensitivity towards authentic applications, the characteristics of low-dimensional material based photodetectors still need some further improvement.
Lead–halide perovskites are considered to be attractive materials for highly efficient photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes and photodetectors.8,10,28–33 A high power conversion efficiency of over 20% is obtained in recent solar cells based on lead–halide perovskites.29,30 In addition, other photoelectric devices based on lead–halide perovskites also show some excellent photoelectric properties.8,10,31 As an important precursor for the synthesis of lead–halide perovskites, lead iodide (PbI2) gains some additional interest. Lead iodide (PbI2) is a typical layered material like cadmium iodide (CdI2) with each layer consisting of I–Pb–I repeating units stacked along the c-axis.34,35 Like other layered materials, PbI2 interlayers are connected by weak van der Waals forces. Thus, bulk PbI2 can be exfoliated into single layers. Different from MoS2 and other TMDCs, PbI2 is known to be a direct bandgap (2.28–2.5 eV) material in bulk form,36 but first-principles calculations of the band structure of PbI2 show that monolayer PbI2 has an indirect bandgap of 3.72 eV.37 Due to these unique optical and semiconducting properties, PbI2 is considered to have potential applications in solar cells, detectors and other optoelectronic devices.35–37 Meanwhile, PbI2 has been extensively studied as a stable room temperature nuclear radiation detector due to its large atomic number (ZPb = 82, ZI = 53).38,39 Many methods have been developed to synthesize PbI2 bulk crystals, such as Bridgman's method,40 the solution process,35 the sol–gel method41 and vapor deposition.34,42 However, the efficient growth methods of low-dimensional PbI2 nanostructures are rarely reported and still remain a great challenge. Thus, the realization of rigorous 1D and 2D PbI2 nanosystems is essential for the further investigation of both PbI2 and perovskites for their potential.
In this work, the single crystalline PbI2 nanosheets and nanowires are synthesized by a facile physical vapour deposition (PVD) method. The morphology of low-dimensional PbI2 crystals can be adjusted by controlling the deposition temperature, and high quality quasi-2D PbI2 nanosheets and quasi-1D PbI2 nanowires were obtained. Such a different crystal morphology and crystallographic symmetry showed obvious phase dependence. The thickness of PbI2 nanosheets also strongly relies on the growth temperature. Furthermore, we also systematically investigated the photodetectors based on PbI2 nanosheets and nanowires with different substrates (both SiO2/Si and flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates). PbI2 nanosheet photodetectors exhibit better photoelectric properties than PbI2 nanowires. Moreover, the obtained flexible devices with PET substrates exhibit excellent mechanical stability and reliability. The bending angle related photocurrent change in the experimental results was theoretically supported by simulating the band structures under different compressive strains of PbI2.
2. Experimental details
Synthesis of PbI2 nanosheets and nanowires
PbI2 nanosheets and nanowires were grown on the SiO2/Si substrate by the PVD process in a horizontal vacuum tube furnace. In a typical synthesis, 0.1 g of PbI2 power was added to an alumina boat as the source material and placed at the center of the furnace. The substrate was placed at downstream of the carrier gases (see Fig. 1a). The carrier gas was argon. The temperature was increased from 303 K to 683 K at a rate of 24 K min−1, and the temperature was maintained at 683 K for 1 min. Then the furnace was cooled down to room temperature under ambient conditions.

Fabrication of photodetectors
PbI2 nanosheet and nanowire based photodetectors were fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate (the Si substrate with a 300 nm SiO2 insulating top layer) and the flexible plastics PET substrate by a “gold-wire mask moving” technique.43 A micrometer gold-wire serving as a mask was fixed tightly on the top surface of the materials, and then a pair of Au electrodes was deposited onto the substrate by thermal evaporation. Finally, by slightly removing the Au wire mask, Au electrodes were fabricated and a gap was produced between the two electrodes.
Measurement and characterization
The phase composition, crystallographic structure, and morphologies of the as-prepared materials were examined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique with Cu Ka irradiation. Raman spectra were measured from 100 to 400 cm−1 using a laser with a 532 nm wavelength, an optical microscope, and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; JEM-2100F, JEOL). Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the device were recorded using a transistor test system (Agilent-B2902) in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell. The spectral response was obtained by using a 450 nm laser.
Density functional theory calculations
The calculations are performed by using the projector augmented plane-wave (PAW) method within the framework of DFT in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is adopted for electron exchange and correlation. The vdW interlayer interaction is described by opt PBE–vdW. A vacuum larger than 15 Å is used to eliminate the interaction between adjacent images. The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set is set to 500 eV, and the first Brillouin zone is sampled with a (15 × 15 × 4) Monkhorst–Pack grid for relaxation of PbI2 multilayers. All of the structures are fully relaxed with a force tolerance of 0.01 eV Å−1.
3. Results and discussion
PbI2 micro/nano-crystals were fabricated by a facile physical vapor deposition (PVD) method, and the schematic illustration of experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1a. The growth details can be found in the Experimental section. Fig. 1b–e are the typical optical images of the as-prepared samples at different temperature zones. The results obviously showed that the morphology of the as-prepared samples depends strongly on the deposit temperature. Hexagonal nanosheets (Fig. 1b–d) are formed in the low temperature zone (positions 1, 2 and 3), but in the room temperature zone (position 4) the nanowire-like crystals (Fig. 1e) are formed. In addition, the thickness of the prepared nanosheets also varies with the substrate temperatures. With the decrease of the substrate temperature, the thickness of the prepared samples increased. At a high substrate temperature, thin crystals with the thickness less than 10 nm are obtained (Fig. 1b). On the other hand, the thicker crystals are obtained on the lower temperature area. The optical images (Fig. 1b–d) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. S1a–c, ESI†) show that the thickness of the hexagonal PbI2 crystals range from 6.7 to 198 nm and their lateral size is more than 10 μm. According to the results of optical images (Fig. 1b–d) and the corresponding AFM images (Fig. S1a–c, ESI†), the relationship between the colors of the optical image and the thickness of PbI2 crystals is established. As thickness increases from 6.7 nm to 24.7 nm, the optical colors gradually changes from pale green to dark green. When the thickness of PbI2 crystals increases to about 200 nm, the optical color completely changes into yellow. Fig. 1e is the optical image of obtained PbI2 nanowires from the room temperature area, showing that the length of PbI2 nanowires varies from 50 to 100 μm and the diameter is about 100–500 nm (Fig. S1d, ESI†). Moreover, these two different morphologies of the as-prepared crystals are confirmed to be two different phases by XRD and TEM results. So, the PVD method is an effective way to control the formation of phase related crystals. The quasi-2D PbI2 nanosheets and quasi-1D PbI2 nanowires are successfully fabricated via this PVD method. In the process of crystal growth, the PbI2 powers are vaporized and the molecular species (have the basic structural configuration) are formed at high temperature. With the carrying of carrier gas, the molecules land on the substrate surfaces to form nuclei. After nucleation, the small nuclei grow into a large crystal. During the crystal growth, surface energy plays an important role in controlling the morphology and phase of desired crystals. Compared with the high-index crystal plane, the low-index crystal plane has lower surface energy. The low surface energy can lead to large nucleation probability.44,45 Moreover, the atoms adsorbed on the low-energy surface have a low binding energy and a high probability of desorption. These two processes influence each other, and this causes different crystal planes to have a different growth rate.44 As a result, PbI2 nanowires and nanosheets are formed in the room and low temperature zone, respectively.
The crystallographic phase of the as-synthesized products was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the phase I nanosheets, which can be indexed to the hexagonal PbI2 structure (JCPDS-73-1750, a = 4.557 Å and c = 6.979 Å, Pm1 164). Meanwhile, four strong (00L) diffraction peaks were observed for the PbI2 nanosheets, indicating lamellar stacking along the c-axis of the I–Pb–I sandwich layer as illustrated in the crystallographic model in the inset Fig. 2a. In the meantime, the crystallographic phase of the nanowires was also studied and the corresponding result is shown in Fig. 2b. The XRD pattern of phase II was well indexed to the hexagonal PbI2 structure (JCPDS-73-1288; a = b = 4.557 Å and c = 69.78999 Å, P3m1 156), and the inset image in Fig. 2b is the crystallographic model of PbI2 nanowires. Both the phase I PbI2 nanosheets and phase II PbI2 nanowires are hexagonal structures, but they have a different stacking method and different symmetry. The inset images in Fig. 2a and b show that phase I nanosheets are stacked along the Z-axis by the way of A and phase II nanowires are organized along the Z-axis by way of A and B, alternately. The overall crystallographic models of phase I and phase II are illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In addition, the diffraction peaks of these two samples are strong and sharp indicating that the as-prepared samples have a high crystallization quality. Raman spectra of PbI2 samples with excitation at 532 nm are depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The peaks of the thick PbI2 nanosheets are observed at 109 and 164 cm−1, which match well with the Raman spectrum of bulk PbI2.36,46 Compared with the PbI2 nanosheet, three strong peaks positioned at 109, 164 and 303 cm−1 are observed in the Raman spectra of PbI2 nanowires. The Raman spectral analysis further supports the results of the XRD. All peaks are sharp and show strong intensity, which indicates that the obtained samples are all in high crystalline states. In addition, Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the room-temperature UV-vis absorbance spectra of these two types PbI2 crystals. The band-gap energies calculated on the basis of the corresponding absorption edges are 2.55 eV (PbI2 nanowires) and 2.38 eV (PbI2 nanosheets).

The crystal structures of PbI2 nanosheets and nanowires were further studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 3a is a low-magnification TEM image of a typical PbI2 nanosheet, clearly indicating the hexagonal structure. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) taken from the PbI2 nanosheet is displayed in Fig. 3c. This image shows a spot pattern which is consistent with a high quality and hexagonal structured single crystal. Meanwhile, the SAED pattern also follows the [001] zone axis. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) of the PbI2 nanosheet is shown in Fig. 3b. The lattice spacings along two different directions are 3.75 Å and 3.75 Å with an intersection angle of 60°, which are corresponding to the {100} set of planes. This further confirmed the crystallographic orientation of the phase I PbI2 nanosheet. The results of HRTEM and SAED indicate that the PbI2 nanosheet stacked along the [001] direction, which agree well with the result of XRD in Fig. 2a. Similar measurements and analyses of the PbI2 nanowires also verify the high crystallinity with phase II packing (Fig. 3d–f). Moreover, the SAED and HRTEM images referring to PbI2 nanowires (Fig. 3e and f) show that the quasi-1D PbI2 nanowires grow along the [011] direction. To our knowledge, such temperature controlled growth of phase-dependent PbI2 nanostructures is rarely reported.

Besides the phase dependence of crystal packing and morphologies, PbI2 based nanodevices could also be very interesting. To investigate the opto-electronic properties of the as-prepared single-crystal thin PbI2 nanosheet and the ultralong PbI2 nanowire, photodetectors were fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate (the Si substrate with the 300 nm SiO2 insulating top layer) and the flexible plastics PET substrate. The inset picture in Fig. 4a is the AFM image of the thin PbI2 nanosheet based photodetector fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate, and atomic force microscopy height topography shows that the thickness of this PbI2 nanosheet is ∼8.32 nm, indicating that this nanosheet has 12 layers (the thickness of a PbI2 single layer is 0.69 nm). The electrical response to the illumination of the 450 nm laser was systematically studied and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 4a. The different power density of the light source ranges from 3.4 mW cm−2 to 42.24 mW cm−2. The current linearly increased with the voltage in current–voltage (I–V) curves, indicating good Ohmic contacts behavior between the Au electrodes and PbI2 nanosheets. The photocurrent of this device also shows a strong dependence on light intensity. The corresponding light intensity dependence of the photocurrent can be expressed by a power law function of I = αPβ, where I is the photocurrent, α is a scaling constant, P is the light power intensity, and β is an exponent, which represent the response of the photocurrent to light-intensity, respectively.17,19 This photodetector reveals a power dependence of I ≈ P0.533 (function: I = 6.688P0.533), and a superior photocurrent capability of the PbI2 nanosheets.

(d) photocurrent rise and decay of this photodetector under irradiation of the 450 nm laser with a light intensity of 42.24 mW cm−2 and a bias voltage of 5 V. 
The stability and sensitivity of the phase I PbI2 nanosheet based photodetectors are presented in Fig. 4c and d. The photoresponse is measured by periodically turning ON/OFF the laser with a light intensity of 42.24 mW cm−2 at a bias of 5 V. With the change of the laser from the “OFF” state to the “ON” state, the current of the photodetector rapidly increased to an obvious saturation value. As shown in Fig. 4c, when the laser is on the “OFF” state, the photodetector has a low dark current (about 1.0 × 10−11 A). The low value of dark current indicates a low noise and a high sensitivity, which are vital for the practical electric-devices.11,47 The current of the photodetector rapidly increased from 10−11 A to 10−8 A as the laser in the “ON” state gives a high photoswitching ratio (Ilight/Idark) of 103. In order to study the stability of the PbI2 nanosheet based photodetector, the laser was switched periodically at a constant interval for multiple cycles. The photodetectors exhibit excellent stability and reversibility. As shown in Fig. 4c, the ON/OFF switching behavior retained very well and reversible. In addition, the response and recovery times are recorded in Fig. 4d. The response time (defined as the time needed to reach 90% of the maximum photocurrent) and recovery time (defined as the time needed to drop to 10% of the maximum photocurrent) are estimated to be about 18 and 22 ms, respectively. These values are superior to the value reported for the other layered materials.15,17 On the other hand, the faster response and recovery also imply the high quality of 2D PbI2 nanosheets.48
Spectral responsivity (Rλ), external quantum efficiency (EQE) and detectivity (D*) are three key parameters for evaluating the sensitivity of the photodetector. Rλ is defined as the photocurrent generated per unit power of incident light on the effective area of a photodevice, EQE is related to the number of electron–hole pairs excited by a photodetector per adsorbed photon and per unit time, and D* reflects the photodetector's sensitivity. Rλ, EQE and D* can be calculated by the following equations: Rλ = ΔIλ/(PλS), EQE = hcRλ/(eλ) and D* = RS1/2/(2eId)1/2, where ΔI = Iλ − Idark is the difference between photocurrent and dark current, Pλ is the incident light intensity, S is the effective illuminated area, h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light, e is the electronic charge, and λ is the incident light wavelength.7,11,14,16,17 For the PbI2 nanosheet based photodetector, the Rλ, EQE and D* are calculated to be about 147.6 A W−1, 4.07 × 104% and 2.56 × 1011 Jones, respectively. These values are much higher than that of a recently reported bulk PbI2 photodetector (on/off ratio about 500 and Rλ of 11.3 A W−1).35 That sample had the same crystal structure of the phase I nanosheet here. The reported PbI2 photodetector is fabricated by the bulk flakes. Compared with the individual nanosheet, there are a lot of defects and grain-boundary states in bulk crystals. The defects and grain-boundary states are the effective trap center, which can easily trap the carriers (electrons and holes). For semiconductor materials, electrons leap from the valence band to the conduction band under the excitation of photons with enough energy. In this carrier transport process, a lot of photo-carriers are trapped by the trap centers. The trap centers in materials definitely hinder the efficiency of collecting photo-carriers. So, it is understandable that the PbI2 photodetectors fabricated by the individual nanosheet have much higher photo-responsivity than those fabricated by the bulk flakes. The results efficiently reveal the superior 2D structure in device application.
Apart from the stability and sensitivity, the mechanical flexibility is also an important parameter to evaluate the photodetector. As-prepared PbI2 nanosheets were transferred onto the PET substrate and were subsequently patterned with Au electrodes (∼50 nm thick). Fig. 5a is a typical picture of the PbI2 nanosheet-based photodetector on the PET substrate and the inset picture is the AFM image of the typical photodetector. Under the light illumination with the light density of 42.24 mW cm−2, the I–V curve of this photodetector shows a good linear behavior which indicates the good Ohmic contact behavior between the Au electrodes and the PbI2 nanosheet (Fig. 5b). Meanwhile, Fig. 5b also shows that the PbI2 nanosheet-based photodetector on the plastic substrate has good photoresponse. The rise and recovery time is calculated to be about 18 and 23 ms (Fig. 5c), respectively, which is similar to the PbI2 nanosheet-based photodetector on the SiO2/Si substrate. The Rλ, EQE and D* are also calculated for this PET photodetector and are similar to the devices on the SiO2/Si substrate (Table 1). From the photocurrent dependence time curve of this photodetector on the PET substrate, when the laser changed from the “OFF” state to the “ON” state, the current reached a peak value and then rapidly decreased to a constant saturation value (Fig. 5c). But for the photodetector on the SiO2/Si substrate, the photocurrent dependence time curve shows a different characteristic. From Fig. 4c, we can learn that when the laser changed from the “OFF” state to the “ON” state, the current rapidly reached a relatively large value and then slowly increased to a saturation value. This different performance is related to the influence of the substrate, and possibly due to the fact that photoexcited charges are trapped by hydroxyl groups or defects at the SiO2 interface.49 For the PET photodetector, under the light illumination, electron–hole pairs increased rapidly and accumulated in the metal–semiconductor interface, and then the accumulated electron diffused within an extremely short time which results in the photocurrent reaching a constant saturation value. This phenomenon is also observed in PbI2 nanowire based photodetectors (the specific data can be found in Fig. 6c and f).

The testing conditions in (c), (d) and (f) are under 450 nm laser irradiation with a light intensity of 42.24 mW cm−2 at a bias voltage of 5 V. 
The mechanical flexibility of the PbI2 nanosheet-based photodetector is also measured. Fig. 5b shows the I–V characteristics of the photodetector on the PET substrate with the different bending angles. It can be seen that the photocurrent decrease with the increase of bending angles. The corresponding bending angles dependence of the photocurrent can be expressed by a linear equation of y = 11.9 − 0.0316x (Fig. S5b, ESI†), indicating that the photocurrent has great dependence on the bending angle. Fortunately, the change of current is very weak (decreased about 15%) in the whole bending process. This phenomenon results from the change in the band structure under compressive strain which will be discussed later. In addition, we studied the I–t characteristics of the PbI2 nanosheet-based photodetector on the PET substrate after different bending times with a bending angle of 60°. As shown in Fig. 5c, the photocurrent and photoresponse almost no change after bending 100 times. These results show that this photodetector maintains excellent mechanical stability and reproducibility, and indicate that the PbI2 nanosheets are the ideal selection for advanced flexible photo-electric devices.
Compared with the PbI2 nanosheets, the photoelectric behavior of as-prepared single-crystal ultralong PbI2 nanowires is also studied to further confirm their phase dependence. Such nanowire-based photodetectors are similarly fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate (the Si substrate with the 300 nm SiO2 insulating top layer) and the flexible plastics PET substrate. The inset pictures in Fig. 6a and e are the optical images of single nanowire-based photodetectors on the SiO2/Si substrate and the PET substrate. Fig. S1d (ESI†) is the AFM image of the PbI2 nanowire, and atomic force microscopy height topography shows that the thickness of this PbI2 nanowire is 114 nm. Like PbI2 nanosheet-based devices, these PbI2 nanowire-based photodetectors also show an Ohmic contact between PbI2 nanowires and Au electrodes (Fig. 6a and e). As summarized in Table 1, these photodetectors also show good photoresponse, but the parameters (Rλ, EQE and D*) are lower than the nanosheets. The light intensity-dependent photocurrent of the PbI2 nanosheet-based photodetector fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate is recorded in Fig. 6b and it can be expressed by a power law function of I = αPβ. This photodetector reveals a power dependence of I ≈ P0.898 (function: I = 2.023P0.898), indicating a superior photocurrent capability and the highly crystalline nature of PbI2 nanowires. The ideal value of β is 1, and it represents light utilization. Improving the crystal quality of materials is a good method to obtain a high β value.23 During the investigation of stability and sensitivity (Fig. 6c), the photodetector maintains an excellent photoresponse after repeating many ON/OFF state cycles. The response time and recovery time are estimated to be about 18 and 25 ms (Fig. 6d), respectively, which are comparable with the PbI2 nanosheet based photodetector. The photocurrent also has a linear tendency to bending angles (Fig. 6e and Fig. S5a, ESI†). The change in the current values is more obvious than that in the PbI2 nanosheet-based flexible photodetector. The phase II nanowire flexible devices also show desirable mechanical stability and almost no change in the photocurrent and photoresponse was observed before and after bending 100 times as shown in the I–t characteristics in Fig. 6f. The spectral photoresponse of these two types of PbI2 under the continuously changing wavelengths from 200 to 800 nm were also studied (Fig. S6, ESI†). For the PbI2 nanosheets, the maximum of the photocurrent value is obtained at a wavelength of about 510 nm (Fig. S6a, ESI†). But for the PbI2 nanowires, the maximum of the photocurrent value is obtained at a wavelength of about 485 nm (Fig. S6b, ESI†). These wavelengths correspond to the band-gap of these two types of PbI2. These results match well with the absorption spectra of these two types of PbI2.
To understand the changes of photocurrent related to the bending angles of flexible PbI2 photodetectors, four-layered PbI2 (phase I) is taken as an example to investigate the influence of in-plane biaxial strain on its electronic structure by using first-principles calculations. It can be seen from its band structure (Fig. 7b) that four-layered PbI2 possesses a direct band gap with the CBM and VBM locating at the Γ point. Fig. 7a shows the variation of the band gap (Eg) between deformed and undeformed PbI2 as functions of the biaxial strain. When subjected to tensile strain, the band gap of PbI2 decreases linearly with increase of the strain. The VBM shifts from the Γ point to the K point when under a tensile strain larger than 3%, while the CBM remains at the Γ point. In the case of compressive strain, Eg shows a linearly increasing trend with the applied compressive strain until the strain reaches 8%. So, this change in the bandgap is the direct cause of the decrease of photocurrent. Combined with our experimental data (Fig. 5b and 6e), we can know that the compressive strains applied in our experiment are in the range of 0% to 8%. Larger compressive strain leads to the CBM shifting to the M point, further reducing the band gap. Further insight can be obtained from the evolution of its band structure as a function of applied strain, which is also shown in Fig. 7. Although PbI2 nanowires and nanosheets belong to different phases, they have a little change in the spatial array of their constituent atoms (Fig. S2, ESI†). The first-principles calculation of PbI2 nanowires (phase II) shows almost the same results with PbI2 nanosheets (phase I).

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, single crystalline PbI2 nanosheets and nanowires are successfully synthesized via a physical vapour deposition (PVD) method. The different crystal morphologies and crystallographic symmetries showed obvious phase dependence. The growth temperature is a key factor controlling single-crystalline PbI2 nanosheets (phase I) and nanowires (phase II). PbI2 nanosheet and nanowire based photodetectors fabricated on both the SiO2/Si substrate and the flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate show excellent photoelectric properties. In addition, the photoelectric properties of these photodetectors rely greatly on the phase dependent morphology of PbI2. The PbI2 nanosheet based photodetector fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate exhibits a maximum photoswitching ratio of 103, a photoresponsivity (Rλ) of 147.6 A W−1, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.07 × 104%. In addition to its high photoelectric detection ability, the PbI2 nanosheet based photodetector with the flexible PET substrate also exhibits excellent mechanical stability. Compared with the high performance of PbI2 nanosheets, PbI2 nanowires show relatively poor photoelectric detection ability. Meanwhile, for PET photodetectors, the photocurrent linearly decreases with increase of the bending angles. Theoretical modeling of PbI2 electronic structures indicates that the bandgap of PbI2 changed greatly under different in-plane biaxial strains (ε), which should be responsible for the change in the photocurrent. These results pave the way for exploiting high performance low-dimensional semiconductor photodetectors based on PbI2 single crystals.
