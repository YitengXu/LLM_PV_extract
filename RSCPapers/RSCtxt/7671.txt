    , Accepted 18th July 2022First published on 22nd July 2022AbstractLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are severely hindered by low sulfur utilization and short cycling lives, especially at high sulfur loading levels. An effective solution to address these problems is to improve the sulfiphilicity of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the lithiophilicity of the lithium anode. However, it is a great challenge to simultaneously optimize both aspects. To solve these problems, herein, a modification strategy involving a functional separator is used, coating a composite including MoP nanorods decorated with a N-doped thin carbon layer (MoP@NC) and porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) onto the surface of a Celgard separator. The obtained MoP@NC material, derived from a molybdenum-based MOF (Mo-MOF), possesses abundant porosity and multiple catalytic sites, with uniform and stable rod-shaped morphology. The PCNFs and N-doped thin carbon layer can effectively alleviate volume expansion, buffer the electrolyte, and trap LiPS. When applied as a modification layer coated on the separator, the MoP@NC/PCNFs-based cell with optimized lithiophilicity and sulfiphilicity enables desirable sulfur electrochemistry, including high reversibility of 902.9 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1C and 654.5 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2C. This work provides a novel strategy by which MoP derived from a MOF can be applied in the design of high-performance Li–S batteries.
1. Introduction
With the development of human society and the worsening of environmental pollution, it has become urgent to establish a balance between meeting increasing energy demands and alleviating growing pressure on the environment.1,2 Electricity can be directly obtained from clean energy sources, such as wind power, hydroelectric power, solar energy, etc., but these clean energy sources are all intermittent. Therefore, it is particularly indispensable to explore advanced energy storage and conversion devices with excellent performance.3–5 Therefore, research into efficient and sustainable energy storage devices is becoming more and more important. In addition, as a representative energy storage device, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have already found great use in portable electronics.6,7 However, with the ever-increasing demand for next-generation energy storage systems, traditionally commercial LIBs cannot meet ever-increasing energy demands due to their limited energy density.8,9 Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, as next-generation electrochemical storage device candidates, have attracted intense interest owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mA h g−1) and energy density (2600 W h kg−1), their environmentally benign nature, the abundance of the raw resources, and the low cost of elemental sulfur.10,11 Despite these multiple virtues, the practical implementation of Li–S batteries is still impeded by several major shortcomings, including the limited conductivity of elemental sulfur and Li2S2/Li2S, severe LiPS shuttling, and large volumetric expansion during cycling.12,13 These disadvantages will inevitably cause low levels of sulfur utilization and sluggish reaction kinetics, thereby resulting in unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. In the past few decades, great effort has been applied to overcome these issues, with the following main approaches: (1) the design and preparation of cathode materials with special structures; (2) configuring novel types of functional electrolytes; and (3) developing functional separators.14,15 Among these, the rational design, preparation, and application of functional separators in batteries has been confirmed as an effective and convenient way to advance the performance and support the future practical application of Li–S batteries.16,17
A separator is a crucial component of Li–S batteries; while ordinary separators allow the transmission of lithium ions, LiPS can also easily diffuse through the separator to the lithium anode.18,19 During cycling, insoluble low-order LiPS (Li2S/Li2S2) can form an insulating layer on the anode surface, which is inconvenient for the conduction of lithium ions and results in serious polarization. In order to minimize the drawbacks, diverse pure carbonaceous materials (porous carbon,20 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),21 graphene oxide,22 carbon quantum dots,23etc.) have been investigated and applied as functional layers to coat separators. These functional separators with a pure carbon coating layer can reduce the shuttle effect of LiPS through physical adsorption. However, the poor interaction between nonpolar carbon-based materials and polar LiPS usually cannot effectively inhibit the “shuttle effect” of LiPS, especially under high sulfur loading conditions.9,24 To enhance the trapping of LiPS, some carbon-based materials have been doped with heteroatoms (N,25 P,26 O,27 S,28 and B29), which leads to improved electrochemical performance. In contrast, polar materials (such as metal hydroxides,30 metal oxides,31 metal sulfides,32 metal nitrides,33 metal carbides,34etc.) have been studied with interest because of their strong chemical adsorption of LiPS and excellent electrocatalytic activity. These attempts not only curb the LiPS shuttle effect via combining physical shielding and chemical adsorption, but unreacted LiPS can also be recycled, guaranteeing to reduce the shuttle effect and improve sulfur utilization, effectively enhancing electrochemical performance.
In addition, recently, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively investigated for their applications in energy storage and conversion. Owing to the fact that MOFs are composed of organic ligands and metal ions with high porosity and tunability, various MOF-derived nanostructures can be obtained through precise subsequent treatment, including transition metal oxides (TMOs),35,36 carbides (TMCs),37 phosphides (TMPs),38,39 and so on. Catalysts derived from MOFs possess several merits which support their application in electrocatalysis: (i) metal-based nanoparticles generated during carbonization may be effective for electrocatalysis due to their combination of strong catalytic performance and good conductivity;40,41 and (ii) MOF-derived products with a porous nature are beneficial for mass transportation, hence contributing to the improvement of catalytic performance during electrocatalysis.2,42 Among the available materials, TMPs derived from MOFs usually have high theoretical capacitance and excellent conductivity. These merits are attributed to the lower electronegativity of elemental P in phosphides compared with elemental O and C in the corresponding oxides and carbides, which can allow fast electronic transport and facilitate active redox reactions in the case of TMPs.43,44 The P atoms on the surface of TMPs also endow them with inherent charge (Mδ+ and Pδ−); therefore, they can coordinate with LiPS (Mδ+) and form bonds with sulfur atoms (Pδ−), thereby showing high activity during LiPS adsorption.45 Thus, TMPs (e.g., MoP,46 Ru–Mo4P3,47etc.) can initially be applied in the cathodes of Li–S batteries. Nonetheless, the unique advantages of TMPs cannot be fully realized in these assembled Li–S batteries when they act as the sulfur host due to low sulfur loading and average rate performance (≤2C), even at a relatively low areal sulfur loading. Therefore, TMPs have gradually been exploited as separator modifiers. Duan et al. described a multifunctional interlayer composed of MoP2 nanoparticles derived from molybdenum sheets and CNT film, where CNT film acted as a conductive skeleton to support the MoP2 nanoparticles; this was regarded as a current collector and provided abundant electron pathways. A Li–S battery containing the multifunctional MoP2/CNT interlayer showed a reversible specific capacity of 905 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.2C, with capacity decay of 0.152% per cycle.48 As is well known, MOF-derived doped carbon and metal compounds possess large surface areas, low charge transfer resistance, and favorable LiPS adsorption abilities. Moreover, converting elemental metal atoms in MOF compounds to metal compounds (e.g., CoP), with stronger adsorption capacities and electrochemical activities, can further enhance the performance of Li–S batteries because of the large surface area, high porosity, diverse composition, and easy construction. Zhang et al. synthesized CoP with a N-doped carbon nanocage derived from ZIF-67 as an efficient sulfur host for use in advanced Li–S batteries, and Li–S batteries assembled with the CoP–HNC electrode showed significantly enhanced sulfur utilization (about 800 mA h g−1 at 5C), improved cycling stability, and an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.02% per cycle after 1000 cycles.49
Previously, our group has made some explorations relating to porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) and PCNFs decorated with LaF3,50 CeF3,51 YF3,52etc. as sulfur hosts for lithium–sulfur batteries, and they showed excellent electrochemical stability. Herein, we first synthesized MoP nanorods decorated with a N-doped thin carbon layer using Mo-MOF as a precursor, utilizing MoO3 and imidazole as raw materials, and we then coated these with porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs), prepared using PVP nanofibers as a precursor, with electrostatic blowing technology used to coat one side of a Celgard 2340 separator (labeled MoP@NC/PCNFs) for use in Li–S batteries for the first time. The PCNFs can shorten the ion/electron transport paths, alleviate sulfur volume changes during charge/discharge processes, and provide abundant active adsorption sites for adsorbing LiPS. More importantly, the prepared MoP@NC nanorods were capable of capturing LiPS to form Li–P, P–S, N–Li, and strengthened Mo–S bonds. The resulting battery with the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator exhibited mitigated self-discharge behavior and remarkable reversible capacities of 902.9 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1C and 654.5 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2C. Even under high sulfur loading conditions (3.8 mg cm−2), the areal capacity of the cell with the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator is still maintained at 612.1 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5C.
2. Experimental

3. Results and discussion
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of MoP@NC and Mo-MOF are shown in Fig. 2a–d, S1 and S2.† Obviously, Mo-MOF showed well-defined rod-like features, with an average diameter of about 400–600 nm (horizontal direction). MoP@NC exhibited almost the same morphology, derived from Mo-MOF, with smaller and more uniform dimensions, ranging from 300 to 400 nm, which might be caused by skeleton shrinkage during the annealing and phosphorization of Mo-MOF. In order to explore the components of the as-synthesized MoP@NC nanorods, EDS characterization was performed based on SEM and HRTEM tests. As shown in Fig. 2f, Mo and P elements were homogeneously distributed throughout the MoP@NC nanorods, while C, N, and O elements were present in the nanorods in small amounts. Meanwhile, Mo, P, C, N, and O elements were evenly distributed on the surface of the MoP@NC nanorods, as shown in Fig. S3.† These results indicated that the N-doped carbon formed upon the degradation of Mo-MOF was mainly concentrated on the surface of MoP. The formed N-doped carbon possessed a porous structure, which facilitated PH3, from the degradation of NaH2PO2·H2O, entering the interior and reacting with Mo-MOF.53 In addition, the unique structure can contribute to Li+ transport and accommodate volumetric expansion during redox reactions of LiPS.37

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrates the synthesis of MoP@NC nanorods successfully embedded in thin carbon layers, as shown in Fig. 3a. The broad peaks in the XRD pattern located at 28.1°, 32.1°, 43.1°, 57.1°, 64.9°, 67.7°, and 74.2° can be attributed to MoP characteristic peaks (JCPDF no. 24-0771) and are assignable to the (001), (100), (101), (110), (111), (102), and (201) facets.54 Moreover, MoP@NC was further investigated, examining the microscopic phase of the microstructure via HRTEM. As illustrated in Fig. 2e, the well-resolved lattice fringe of 0.165 nm could be indexed to (110) facet diffraction from the plane of hexagonal MoP.54–56 The broad peak located at 39.5° may be ascribed to amorphous carbon originating from the annealed MOF.57 All of these results indicated that MoP@NC was successfully synthesized and wrapped in a thin layer of the carbon MOF as a precursor, which can also be confirmed based on TEM and HRTEM tests (Fig. S4 and S5†). In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was also carried out to further investigate the bonding configurations and chemical environment of the as-developed MoP@NC composite, as depicted in Fig. 3b–e. It can be confirmed that Mo, P, N, C, and O elements all existed in the MoP@NC composite based on the XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 3b), which is very consistent with the element mapping results (Fig. 2f). Fig. 3c exhibits the high-resolution Mo 3d spectrum, and the strong peaks from MoP(3d5/2) at 235.8 eV and MoP(3d3/2) at 228.0 eV represented Mo–P bonding. Meanwhile, the Mo6+(3d3/2) and Mo6+(3d3/2) peaks could originate from the oxidation of MoP and Mo sources from Mo-MOF.58

As seen in Fig. 3d, the P 2p high-resolution spectrum shows a doublet at 129.5 eV and 130.3 eV, corresponding to P in MoP@NC. The P(2p3/2) peak with binding energy of 133.7 eV and the P–O peak (134.6 eV) represent typical oxidation peaks of phosphorous, such as in PO43+, P2O5, and H3PO3, which indicates that the surface of the MoP nanomaterial was oxidized59,60. As is well known, pyridinic N (398.3 eV) and pyrrolic or pyridone N (396.3 eV) can improve the surface adsorption toward sulfur and LiPS, either via interactions with pyridinic N atoms or the neighboring carbon of quaternary N (394.8 eV), and graphitic N (401.9 eV) doping increases the electrical conductivity of carbon61,62 (Fig. 3e). In general, a large specific surface area usually corresponds to a high adsorption capacity toward LiPS. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) testing was employed to characterize the specific surface area and pore size distribution of Mo-MOF and MoP@NC, and the results are described in Fig. 3f. MoP@NC exhibited a high specific surface area of 39.7 g cm−2, while Mo-MOF manifested a lower specific surface area of 29.7 g cm−2, which was attributed to the existence of small pores due to generated gas (H2O and N2) during the annealing process63 (Fig. S6†).
The modified separator coated with a MoP@NC layer showed an integrated morphology and no shrinkage, as seen in Fig. 4a. Even after folding, it exhibited excellent mechanical properties and remarkable flexibility, avoiding flaking or peeling off; it should be able to suppress lithium dendrites and adapt to the huge volume changes of electrode materials to a certain extent (Fig. S7†). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the MoP@NC separator (Fig. 4b–d) showed the facile formation of a thin integrated coating layer, while the Celgard separator possessed a highly porous structure with numerous nanopores (∼several hundred nanometers in diameter), which can result in dissolved LiPS easily shuttling back and forth (Fig. S8†). Meanwhile the prepared PCNFs manifested an excellent large specific surface area, large pore volume, and convenient conductive networks. Therefore, the prepared MoP@NC combined with the PCNF surface is conducive to having chemical and physical effects on LiPS.46,64 The surface hydrophilicity of the separator plays a significant function in restraining the migration of LiPS during the charging and discharging processes of Li–S batteries.65 For the purpose of obtaining satisfactory lithium-ion transmission capacity, separators should be designed to have suitable hydrophilicity.

To investigate the hydrophilicity of the separator before and after modification, dynamic electrolyte contact angle characterization was performed, as shown in Fig. 5. The bare Celgard separator and the functional separator exhibited contact angles of 68.7° and 37.5°, respectively, after dropping the electrolyte for 5 s. The difference between the contact angles implies that the modified separator becomes more hydrophilic and can more easily come into contact with LiPS, which is more conducive to lithium-ion transmission. The excellent hydrophilicity is mainly attributed to these reasons: firstly, there are multiple polar sites within MoP@NC; secondly, PCNFs with hierarchical pores are effective at decreasing the permeation of LiPS.

EIS is often employed to study the electrochemical behavior of cells. Fig. 6a shows the EIS curves of cells with MoP@NC/PCNFs, Mo-MOF/PCNFs, and Celgard separators before cycling. The Nyquist curves comprise a semicircle in the medium-to-high-frequency region (implying charge transfer impedance at the interface between the electrolyte and cathode) and a diagonal line in the low-frequency region (signifying diffusion impedance related to LiPS in the electrolyte).66 The fresh MoP@NC/PCNFs cell manifested a low Re value of 3.65 Ω, which was obviously smaller than those of the Mo-MOF/PCNFs (6.94 Ω) and Celgard separator counterparts (15.12 Ω), due to the increase in the hydrophilicity of MoP@NC/PCNFs and the reduction in the diffusion resistance of the liquid electrolyte. MoP@NC/PCNFs possessed a much smaller semicircle diameter, demonstrating faster charge transfer at the interface of MoP@NC/PCNFs and the electrode; this was attributed to the rapid conversion kinetics of soluble LiPS due to the high conductivity of PCNFs and N-doped thin carbon, electrocatalysis due to MoP nanorods, and an advanced ion diffusion rate.67,68 Additionally, the inclined line at low frequency reflects the speed of ion diffusion into the electrode material, and the finding that MoP@NC/PCNFs has the highest slope among these samples certified its superior ion diffusion properties for LiPS conversion.69 Consequently, it can be speculated that the prepared MoP@NC/PCNFs material had minimal polarization due to the synergistic combination of excellent conductivity, satisfactory physical and chemical adsorption of LiPS, and efficient electrocatalytic capacity. Furthermore, the charge transfer resistance clearly confirms that the MoP@NC/PCNFs-modified separator possesses a more conductive and stable structure than the pristine separator, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance in the Li–S cell. Impedance data were also collected after cycling (Fig. S9†) to evaluate any changes in charge transfer resistance. As anticipated, the charge transfer resistance of the cell with the MoP@NC/PCNFs-modified separator manifested a lower Rct value (4.21 Ω) than the cell with a pristine separator (28.6 Ω), which is mainly due to the high electrical conductivity and improved electrolyte wettability between the separator and sulfur cathode.

Fig. 6b exhibits the rate performances of MoP@NC/PCNFs, Mo-MOF/PCNFs, and Celgard separators at different current densities ranging from 0.2 to 2C (1C = 1675 mA h g−1). The MoP@NC/PCNFs separator delivered high specific capacities of 1193.4, 1112.4, and 1008.8 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, 0.5C, and 1C, respectively, which were much higher than those of Mo-MOF/PCNFs (1134.0, 954.9, and 808.1 mA h g−1, respectively) and Celgard (925.7, 804.9, and 666.7 mA h g−1, respectively) separators. When the current rate was increased to 2C, the discharge specific capacity of the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator reached 989.7 mA h g−1, indicating good reaction kinetics. However, the Mo-MOF/PCNFs and Celgard separators manifested reduced specific capacities at 2C as a result of unsatisfactory LiPS restriction and catalysis. When the current density was returned to 1C, 0.5C, and 0.2C, MoP@NC/PCNFs showed high reversible capacities, retaining 80.1%, 83.5%, and 85.7% of the initial discharge specific capacity (0.2C). These results indicated that the prepared MoP@NC/PCNFs separator possessed excellent electrochemical performance, which was attributed to the following points: firstly, the MoP@NC nanorods provided abundant active sites with excellent electrochemical activity, which facilitated redox reactions of LiPS; secondly, the larger mesoporous size of the PCNFs and N-doped thin carbon layer may benefit the rapid diffusion of liquid electrolyte solution;70,71 thirdly, obtained MoP had excellent adsorption and catalysis properties toward LiPS.
The long-term cycling performance of batteries with different separators are displayed in Fig. 6c and d. It can be clearly observed that the MoP@NC/PCNFs cell showed the highest cycling stability among these samples, with commendable capacity retention of 902.9 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1C and 654.5 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2C, corresponding to ultra-low capacity fading rates of 0.05% and 0.07% per cycle, respectively. By contrast, cells with Mo-MOF/PCNFs and Celgard separators can only retain 744.7 (fading rate of 0.07%) and 105.7 mA h g−1 (fading rate of 0.23%) after 400 cycles at 1C (Fig. 6c). Moreover, the cell with Mo-MOF/PCNFs can only maintain a capacity of 533.82 mA h g−1, with capacity decay of 0.1%, at 2C. Such a clear contrast strongly indicates higher sulfur utilization and reaction efficiency in the MoP@NC/PCNFs-based configuration, which was attributed to the construction of a strong adsorption barrier involving MoP nanorods and bifunctional carbon from NC and PCNFs that restrained the “shuttling effect” of LiPS and accelerated the kinetics of LiPS reactions.72 In addition to the adsorption of PCNFs on LiPS, the MOF-derived N-doped thin carbon layer with excellent electrical conductivity served as an upper current collector to keep utilizing trapped LiPS during the charge/discharge processes.73 Moreover, N-element doping involves pyridinic N and pyrrolic or pyridone N, which is beneficial for the adsorption of LiPS (Fig. 3e). The two-component carbon from the PCNFs and N-doped thin carbon layer further strengthened the restriction of LiPS.
To further confirm the role of functional materials, the ion diffusion coefficients (D) of the three batteries were calculated according to the following formula:  where R represents the gas constant, T is related to the absolute temperature of the test environment, A is the area of the electrode, n is the number of electrons transferred per molecule, F denotes the Faraday constant, C is the bulk concentration of carrier ions, and σ is the Warburg coefficient, which can be acquired from the slope of a plot of Z′ vs. ω−1/2 from the fitted data.74,75 The σ values were calculated to be 57.4, 32.5, and 5.7 Ω s−1/2 for Li–S batteries with MoP@NC/PCNFs, Mo-MOF/PCNFs, and Celgard separators, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7a. Accordingly, the ion diffusion coefficient for the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator (DLi+) is calculated to be 8.46 × 10−9 cm2 s−1, which is much higher than those of Mo-MOF/PCNFs (D = 3.52 × 10−10 cm2 s−1) and Celgard (D = 2.09 × 10−10 cm2 s−1). The results demonstrate that the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator can promote the diffusion of Li+, which may be attributed to the continuous network structure formed from PCNFs and the porous architecture of NC.22,76 The ratio of electrolyte to active species (E/S) is critical for determining the cycling performance and safety of a Li–S cell.77 When the amount of electrolyte is insufficient, the cathode and separator are not firmly bonded together, which will lead to large interfacial impedance and a low specific capacity.78 An increase in electrolyte is beneficial for making full use of the capacity of the active materials.12 Nevertheless, excess electrolyte will cause additional side reactions and security issues. As shown in Fig. 7b, the Li–S cell with an E/S ratio of 30 μL mg−1 exhibits the most excellent cycling performance (711.3 mA h g−1 over 150 cycles), and the assembled cell with less electrolyte manifests unsatisfactory specific capacity retention (553.0 mA h g−1 over 150 cycles). Therefore, the E/S ratio is kept at 30 μL mg−1.

To explore the synergistic merits of the different components and the hierarchical structure in Li–S batteries, the electrochemical performances of MoP@NC/PCNFs, Mo-MOF/PCNFs, and Celgard separators were systematically investigated. As shown in Fig. 8a, the charge/discharge curves of MoP@NC/PCNFs, Mo-MOF/PCNFs, and Celgard separators at 1C showed one charge plateau and two discharge plateaus, which was consistent with CV analysis (Fig. 8c). The voltage gap, ΔE, between the oxidation plateau and the second reduction plateau denotes hysteresis during the redox reactions.79 Among the tested separators, MoP@NC/PCNFs showed the lowest polarization potential (ΔE = 171 mV), significantly below those of Mo-MOF/PCNFs (ΔE = 187 mV) and Celgard (ΔE = 228 mV) separators, which further testified the improved redox reaction performance.80Fig. 8b displays the discharge/charge curves of a cell with MoP@NC/PCNFs after different numbers of cycles. The two discharge plateaus and one charge plateau match well with the CV profile, corresponding to typical sulfur electrochemistry.81 It is worth noting that the voltage profile of the cell with MoP@NC/PCNFs can be well maintained, with minimum voltage degradation and capacity loss, evidencing remarkable shuttling suppression due to the establishment of the MoP@NC/PCNFs-based barrier. The CV results for the MoP@NC/PCNFs cell are shown in Fig. 8c. During the cathodic scan, the peaks at around 2.3 V and 2.0 V correspond to the reduction of elemental sulfur to long-chain polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) and further reduction to short-chain polysulfides (Li2Sn, 1 ≤ n < 4), respectively.82 In the anodic sweep, the two oxidation peaks at approximately 2.45 V are attributed to conversion from Li2S to long-chain polysulfides and further to elemental sulfur. Obviously, when compared to the Mo-MOF/PCNFs and Celgard separators, the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator showed the highest current density. Moreover, the cell with the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator showed sharper peaks with higher peak currents and reduced onset potentials, implying satisfactory catalytic activity and leading to the promotion of sulfur species kinetics during liquid–liquid and liquid–solid transfer83. This is consistent with the results seen in Fig. 8e. For practical applications, increasing the sulfur areal loading is essential for obtaining high-energy-density LSBs. Therefore, the cycling performance of a cell with high sulfur loading at a current density of 0.5C was also tested (Fig. 8d). The MoP@NC/PCNFs cell with high sulfur loading of 3.8 mg cm−2 displayed excellent cycling performance, with a discharge capacity of 612.1 mA h g−1 retained after 200 cycles (fading rate of 0.18%). The results revealed that the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator can effectively restrain the shuttling of LiPS and ameliorate the cycling performance, even at high sulfur loading.

The compositions and morphologies of different separators after cycling were analyzed via SEM and XPS testing. Compared to the microstructure image of fresh MoP@NC/PCNFs shown in Fig. 4b, SEM images of cycled MoP@NC/PCNFs (Fig. 9a and b) showed deposited materials within the interspaces and on the surfaces of MoP@NC and PCNF nanorods; even some of the PCNF pores were filled with sediment. However, the structures of PCNF and MoP@NC nanorods in the MoP@NC/PCNFs compound material were maintained without obvious structural degradation, indicating excellent stability toward the LiPS conversion reaction when MoP@NC/PCNFs. The results indicated that MoP@NC/PCNFs can serve as a matrix for capturing and retaining polysulfide species via electrochemical deposition at the end of discharge–charge reactions.84,85 This is also consistent with the results seen in Fig. 9c and Table S1.† By contrast, the surfaces of the Mo-MOF/PCNFs and Celgard separators exhibited uneven deposition, which led to poor contact with the cathode and caused poor electrochemical performance. Moreover, cycled Mo-MOF/PCNFs and Celgard separators displayed more S elements, as shown in Fig. 9d–f and S11,† which was attributed to weak chemical force toward LiPS. These phenomena can be attributed to the large specific surface area of MoP@NC/PNCFs, which possesses enough reactive sites to interact with LiPS due to the presence of MoP@NC nanorods with abundant porosity and multiple catalytic sites.86

Fig. 10 shows morphological images of the lithium anodes from batteries with/without the MoP@NC/PCNFs-modified separator after 400 cycles at 1C. It can be found that the lithium anode disassembled in the cell with the Celgard separator, presenting a very uneven surface with many irregular particles and lots of holes (Fig. 10c and d); this resulted from serious side reactions between the shuttled LiPS and lithium metal during cycling. However, it is worth noting that the lithium anode from the cell with the MoP@NC/PCNFs-modified separator was significantly smooth and homogeneous (Fig. 10a and b). Simultaneously, in order to better understand the function of the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator in suppressing lithium dendrites and to reveal the advantages of the functional separator, the cycling performances of Li‖Li symmetric batteries are shown in Fig. S10.† The lithium symmetric battery assembled with the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator yielded a voltage of 0.015 mV in the 1st cycle and the voltage was almost maintained at this level for 500 h. However, the voltage of the lithium symmetric battery assembled with the Celgard separator sharply increased after approximately 284 h, and the cell even appeared to short-circuit after 476 h. These voltage fluctuations likely come from unstable SEI formation, which results in changes in the surface morphology of lithium during cycling. It is apparent that the voltage profile of the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator is more stable over time. All the results further confirm that the prepared MoP@NC/PCNFs separator can facilitate uniform lithium nucleation and growth due to the synergistic effects of effective chemical/physical restriction and the improved interfacial conductivity, subsequently allowing the lithium metal anode to achieve high cycling stability.87,88 Lithium dendrites originate from the disproportionate deposition of lithium during charging–discharging processes.89 MoP@NC/PCNFs should be credited with capturing LiPS via both chemical adsorption and physical suppression, and only a small amount of LiPS can diffuse to the anode, which can retard the corrosion of lithium. In addition, the uniform distribution of the MoP@NC/PCNFs coating layer was conductive to restraining the formation of dendrites via facilitating the homogeneous dissolution and deposition of lithium.90

In order to visually observe the adsorption capacity of the prepared MoP@NC and Mo-MOF materials toward LiPS, a certain amount of functional material was immersed in Li2S6 solution (Fig. S12†). It can be clearly seen that the color of the solution with MoP@NC visibly fades and even turns transparent after 2 h, which was because the acquired MoP@NC can strongly anchor LiPS and it supports rapid conversion between LiPS and elemental sulfur. By contrast, the color of LiPS solution containing Mo-MOF turned slightly lighter. XPS analysis of the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator harvested from the cell after 400 cycles further confirmed the electrochemical reaction between MoP@NC and LiPS (Fig. S13†). Obviously, the cycled MoP@NC/PCNFs separator exhibited higher amounts of S and Li elements, as seen in Fig. S13a,† which was attributed to chemical interactions between MoP@NC and LiPS. Compared with a fresh MoP@NC/PCNFs separator, the cycled one showed a new peak at 228.6 eV, which was ascribed to S 2s due to the adsorption of LiPS. The high-resolution spectrum of S 2p after cycling could be divided into five peaks, reflecting the presence of Li2S, elemental S8, thiosulfate, polythionate complexes, and sulfate.91,92 The results showed that the MoP@NC nanorods can catalyze the conversion of soluble long-chain LiPS to insoluble thiosulfate and polythionate complexes, further anchoring LiPS from solution and allowing it to undergo conversion to Li2S.93–95
4. Conclusions
In summary, we elaborately designed and prepared a MoP@NC/PCNFs composite comprising MoP@NC nanorods and PCNFs through annealing Mo-MOF and using electrostatic blowing technology, respectively, and applied it as a multifunctional sulfiphilic and lithiophilic mediator in Li–S batteries. The obtained MoP material has almost the same morphology as Mo-MOF nanorods, exhibiting high porosity and a uniformly embedded N-doped thin carbon layer. The N-doped thin carbon layer can not only limit LiPS through physical action, but it also prevents MoP from being oxidized. In addition, the MoP nanorods with high porosity and abundant active sites can effectively trap LiPS, significantly catalyze the redox kinetics during polysulfide conversion, and provide fast paths for lithium ion diffusion. Also, the high conductivity of PCNFs with N doping accelerates redox reactions at the separator surface and is conducive to inhibiting the “shuttle effect” of LiPS during cell cycling. The combination of PCNFs with N doping and a N-doped thin carbon layer has a synergistic effect on electron transfer and electrocatalytic activity. As a result, a Li–S cell with the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator delivers high specific capacities of 1139.9 mA h g−1 at 1C and 1045.0 mA h g−1 at 2C and excellent cycling stability (902.9 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1C with a low capacity–decay rate of 0.05% per cycle and 654.5 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2C with a low capacity–decay rate of 0.08% per cycle). A Li–S cell with sulfur loading of 3.8 mg cm−2 displays excellent cycling performance; of the initial discharge capacity of 952.7 mA h g−1, it retains 612.1 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles (fading rate of 0.18%). Also, a Li–S cell with the MoP@NC/PCNFs separator delivers high specific capacities of 1193.4, 1112.4, and 1008.8 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, 0.5C, and 1C, respectively. When the current density returns to 1C, 0.5C, and 0.2C, MoP@NC/PCNFs shows high reversible capacities, retaining 80.1%, 83.5%, and 85.7%, respectively, of the initial discharge specific capacity (0.2C). This work will provide an effective strategy for the design and preparation of anchoring and catalytic separators for use in advanced lithium–sulfur batteries.
