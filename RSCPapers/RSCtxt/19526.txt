    , Accepted 11th February 2013First published on 12th February 2013AbstractAn approach to prepare TiO2 nanomaterials with favorable morphologies and hierarchical structures is reported. It is seen that polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and titanium butoxide (TBT) can combine together to form PVP@TBT complexes through a water molecule, changing from a 2-dimensional (2D) linear structure to a 3-dimensional (3D) network structure in the presence of a small amount water and/or by aging. The structure of the complexes significantly affects the morphologies of the resulting electrosprayed materials. With the change of the PVP@TBT complexes from a 2D to a 3D structure, the morphologies of the electrosprayed materials transform from core–shell spheres, to bowls, to ink-bottles, to rings, and to microfibers. Moreover, the electrosprayed materials can be converted to porous TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures with tunable specific surface area, pore size, and pore volume, through facile hydrothermal treatment. Our findings provide an effective strategy to fabricate hierarchical TiO2 nanomaterials that are suitable for TiO2-based applications. It is shown that the TiO2 materials with the morphologies of bowls, ink-bottles, and rings have higher photocatalytic activity due to the multi-scattering of light.
Introduction
TiO2 has become an important functional material in many applications,1–3 and it is still drawing increasingly significant attention in the world. Up to now, great efforts have been taken to improve the performances of TiO2 by tuning its structure and morphology, including electronic structure modification,4 crystalline facet controlling,5 morphology construction,6 and porous structure implantation.7 Among various kinds of TiO2 materials, great progress has been made in the fabrication of hierarchical TiO2 materials as they have favorable morphologies, high pore volume, and high specific surface. The controlling fabrication of hierarchical TiO2 materials that can combine some features with special morphologies, such as exposed high-energy facets,8–10 high specific surface area, and high pore volume, is of great interest for material scientists and chemists.11–18 Many types of hierarchical TiO2 material have been synthesized to date, which include various morphologies of fibers, tubes, spheres, meso-crystals, and so on.18–21 As the hierarchical nanostructures contain many pores of different size inside, in which reactants and electrolyte can diffuse freely, they show high performance in the applications of photocatalysis,22 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and lithium batteries. It was reported that the hierarchical nanomaterials exhibit better properties because of some new effects. For example, the multi-light scattering within materials can enhance photocatalytic activity and DSSCs efficiency,15,23 It was also shown that the hierarchical TiO2 nanomaterials can show excellent properties if they are combined with specific morphologies and crystallinities, for example the mesoporous TiO2-B micro-spheres,24 nano-embossed hollow spherical TiO2 materials,25 mono-dispersed TiO2 spheres,16 and hierarchical TiO2 nanotube-nanoparticle structures.26
Many methods can be used to prepare hierarchical TiO2 nanostructural materials, such as the direct hydrothermal reaction, the sol–gel reaction with hydrothermal post-treatment, the sol–gel reaction and microwave post-treatment, and chemically-induced self-transformation.27–29 Due to that the morphologies of TiO2 materials are controlled by the thermodynamic behavior during chemical reactions, most of the hierarchical TiO2 nanostructural materials present the shapes of solid, core–shell, and hollow spheres. The synthesis of TiO2 materials with other morphologies does not seem easy and a new method needs to be developed. In this research, it is seen that polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymer can combine with titanium butoxide monomer (TBT) in ethanol solution to form PVP@TBT complexes, which can be changed from a 2-dimensional (2D) linear structure to a 3-dimensional (3D) network structure. A two-step method, that combines electrospray30,31 and hydrothermal treatment,22,32 is developed to prepare hierarchical TiO2 nanostructured materials with interesting morphologies of bowls, ink-bottles, and hollow rings with tunable specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size, by changing the structure of PVP@TBT complex from a 2-D linear to a 3-D network structure. It is shown that these TiO2 materials have a good photocatalytic activity for the photodecomposition of methylene blue (MB) due to the multi-light scattering inside. Overall, we have provided a particular method to prepare hierarchical TiO2 nanomaterials that can integrate morphologies of bowls, rings, and ink-bottles with high specific surface area and high pore volume. In addition to photocatalysis, these materials can also be used as functional materials in other areas, such as DSSCs, gas sensing, and lithium batteries. Moreover, this method can be used to prepare composite TiO2 and doped TiO2 materials with these morphologies, which should have much wider applications.
Experimental
Material preparation
PVP K30 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan) (0.3 g) was dissolved in ethanol (2.5 mL) and acetic acid (3.8 mL) under magnetic stirring, with different amounts of water from 0 to 400 μL being added. After ca. 10 min stirring, TBT monomer (7.0 mL) was added, and then the resulting mixture solutions were stirred for 1 h to obtain uniform PVP–TBT yellow sols. The PVP–TBT sols were aged in the dark for different periods time of 0–12 days. As shown in Fig. 1, the PVP–TBT sols were loaded into a syringe pump, and each sol was automatically pumped slowly through a metal needle at a controlled speed of 1.0 mL to 2.0 mL per hour. An aluminium target was placed vertically 15 cm to 30 cm away from the needle. A high voltage from 15 kV to 30 kV was applied between the needle and the aluminium target. The PVP–TBT sol that was pumped out of the needle was atomized into very tiny droplets under the high voltage, which was sprayed on the aluminium target. The sprayed materials were collected and dried in air overnight. The resulting powder (0.2 g) was mixed with water (10 mL) and ethanol (20 mL), stirred for 10 min, and then hydrothermally treated at 160 °C for 24 h. For hydrothermal treatment in ammonia, ammonia (2.0 mL) was added to the water–ethanol solution; other hydrothermal conditions remained the same.

Material characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were measured to determine the crystalline phases and calculate the crystal sizes of the TiO2 samples after post-hydrothermal treatment using a RINT 1500 diffractometer. The morphologies of the electrosprayed materials were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SEM-5400, JEOL, Japan). Morphologies of the hydrothermally treated TiO2 materials were checked using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan). Field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM, EM002BF) was used to visualize the morphologies and crystal facets of the nanoparticles on the TiO2 spheres. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C using an adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA). Samples were degassed at 200 °C on a vacuum line for one hour prior to measurement. The multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area of the samples using the absorption data in the P/P0 range from 0.05 to 0.2. The pore size distributions of the TiO2 spheres were derived from the absorption data of the isotherms based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. Pore volumes from 2 to 100 nm were calculated. Fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectra of the PVP@TBT complexes, the pure PVP, and the electrosprayed materials were obtained on an FT-IR spectrometer (FT/IR-6100, JASCO, Japan). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of the PVP@TBT complexes were measured using an Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer (UV-2450, Shimadzu, Japan).
Photocatalytic activity
0.03 g hydrothermally treated TiO2 samples were firstly dispersed in ca. 10 mL ethanol, and were coated on the bottom of ϕ = 90 mm glass containers. After the TiO2 sample coatings were dried (100 °C). 40 mL 2.0 × 10−5 mol L−1 MB water solutions were added in the glass containers. After absorption–desorption equilibrium of MB on TiO2 surface was reached, the photocatalytic reactions were started by turning on 365 nm UVA lamps (TOSHIBA, 15 W). The UV light intensity as measured was ca. 2.0 mW cm−2, and the temperature at which the photocatalytic experiments were performed was ca. 25 °C. The photocatalytic kinetics generally follow the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) model, which considers the Langmuir type adsorption of pollutant on TiO2 surface. In the case of very low concentration, the L–H model reduces to a quasi-first order reaction, which has the simple integration form of ln(C(0)/C(t)) = kt, with C(0), C(t), k being the initial pollutant concentration, reactive pollutant concentration, and rate constant. In this research, the photocatalytic rate constant k was calculated to evaluate the photocatalytic activity.
Results and discussion
Transformation of PVP@TBT complex from 2-D linear to 3-D network structure
UV-Vis spectra of solutions of pure PVP, pure TBT, TBT with 0.4 mL of water being presented and PVP–TBT solutions that contain different amounts of water are shown in Fig. 2A. It can be seen that the pure PVP solution is transparent below 360 nm, while the TBT solution shows an intense absorption near 400 nm because of the electronic transition from –OBu ligands to Ti cores. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the TBT solution that contains 0.4 mL water shows an obvious blue shift as compared to the pure TBT solution because water reacts with the TBT molecule. As shown in Fig. 3A, the –OBu ligands that were coordinated to Ti atoms in the TBT molecule can be substituted by hydroxyl groups (OH−) if water was presented. Moreover, we also noticed that the viscosity of the TBT solution with existing water increases significantly. Both of the changes in UV-Vis absorption and viscosity indicate the formation of a 3-D network of TBT. Fig. 2B shows the UV-Vis spectra of PVP–TBT sols that contain various amounts of PVP from 0 g to 1.2 g. Compared with the PVP-free TBT sol, the UV-Vis absorption of PVP–TBT sol containing 0.4 g PVP exhibits a little red shift, with the solution colour changing from transparent to yellow. With the increase of the PVP amount, it can be seen that the UV-Vis absorption shifts to longer and longer wavelength, which was also accompanied with the viscosity increase of PVP–TBT sols. As a consequence, it is known that the PVP molecule can react with the TBT molecule, which leads to a change in the physical properties of the TBT solutions.

In order to make clear the reaction mechanism between the PVP molecule and the TBT molecule, FT-IR spectra of PVP–TBT (PVP–TBT sol was dried at ca. 50 °C) and pure PVP were measured, as shown in Fig. 4, with assignments of peaks given in Table 1. The intensity of the carbonyl (CO) stretching vibration (labelled by an arrow in Fig. 4) of free PVP greatly decreases in PVP–TBT sol, which indicates that PVP should combine with TBT at the CO group. Because PVP is a hydrophilic polymer, the water molecule can be adsorbed on CO through hydrogen bonding, as shown in Fig 2B and 3. The water on PVP can further react with TBT, resulting in the combination of PVP and TBT molecules. As a result, linear PVP polymer molecular can be covered with many TBT molecules, resulting in the PVP@TBT linear 2-D complex. As the combination of PVP and TBT changes the coordination chemistry of the Ti atom in the TBT molecule, so the UV-Vis absorption edge of TBT solution shifts to longer wavelength if PVP was added and the mixed solution becomes yellow.

To determine the importance of water in PVP@TBT complex formation, the influence of water on the UV-Vis absorption of the complex was also studied, as shown in Fig. 2A. The absorption of PVP@TBT complexes shifts to longer wavelength when 0.1 mL of water was present. The absorption in the visible range increases when 0.2 mL of water is present, but the absorption edge starts to shift to short wavelength compared to that with 0.1 mL water. As 0.3 and 0.4 mL of water is present, it can be seen that the visible absorption remained unchanged, but the absorption edge shows much more red-shift as compared to the PVP@TBT complex with no water being present. According to the above analysis, the red-shift of adsorption edge is due to the reaction between water and TBT. In addition, comparing the absorption spectra of TBT + 0.4 mL water, PVP + TBT + 0.4 mL water, and PVP + TBT, the presence of water in PVP–TBT sols can obviously increase the visible light absorption. By referring to Fig. 2B, the increase of visible light absorption indicates the water can enhance the reaction between PVP and TBT, so it is concluded that PVP and TBT should combine through hydrogen bonding in the bridging water molecule, as shown in Fig. 3B. The blue-shift of the absorption edge of the PVP@TBT complexes shows the formation of a PVP@TBT 3D network, which is also accompanied with viscosity increase. Therefore, the presence of a small amount of water in PVP–TBT solution can transform a PVP@TBT 2D linear complex to a 3D complex network, as shown in Fig. 3C which also influences the viscosity of the PVP@TBT complex. Although the PVP–TBT solutions were often used in electrospinning and electrospray, few reports can be found to study the reaction mechanism between them. Here, UV-Vis absorptions were used to indicate the reaction between them and the formation of PVP@TBT complexes.
Tuning the morphologies of electrosprayed materials through altering the PVP@TBT complex from 2-D to 3-D
The effect of the presence of a small amount of water in the PVP@TBT complexes on the morphologies of electrosprayed materials was studied. Fig. 5 shows the SEM pictures of electrosprayed materials with different morphologies. As shown in Table 2, when the amount of water in PVP@TBT complexes was less than 0.2 mL, the spheres with core–shell structure were obtained (Fig. 5A and B). Fig. 5B shows a broken sphere that is composed of a thin shell and a big core. When 0.25 mL of water was presented, bowl-shaped materials were obtained (Fig. 5C). When > 0.3 mL of water was added, a mixture of ink-bottle-shaped (Fig. 5D) and ring-shaped (Fig. 5E) materials were formed. It is interesting that hollow-ring and ink-bottle materials were produced because they are seldom reported to date. We attempted to prepare only rings or only ink-bottles, but were limited by lack of control of the electrospray process. Although the as-sprayed spheres have a core–shell structure (Fig. 5B), the structure of bowls, ink-bottles, and rings are solid (Fig. 5E).

According to the analysis of UV-Vis spectra, in the case of the presence of < 0.2 mL of water, the PVP@TBT complex is mainly a 2D linear structure, as the absorption edge does not show an obvious blue-shift to short wavelength. During electrospraying, low-viscosity PVP@TBT complex sols are atomized into many microsized complex droplets under the driving of high voltage. As the PVP@TBT complex droplets contain much ethanol and acetic acid, they will evaporate rapidly just after electrospraying. At the same time, the TBT will quickly hydrolyse with water in air. The rapid evaporation of solvents and hydrolysis of TBT cause the surface of atomized PVP@TBT droplets to solidify quickly, which prevents the rapid evaporation and hydrolysis of the inside of the droplets. As a result, the inside of the spheres undergo relatively slower solvent evaporation and hydrolysis, which has enough time to allow the inner material to shrink, as illustrated in our previous research.32 Because of the 2-D linear structure, the weak combination in the PVP@TBT complexes leads to the separation of the surface layer from the inside of electrosprayed materials, resulting in the formation of a core–shell structure. When > 0.25 mL of water was added, the PVP@TBT sols change to a 3D network, as indicated by the obvious red-shift of UV-Vis absorption. In this case, slow shrinking of inner material cannot separate the surface layer from the inside due to the strong connection of the 3D network. In consequence, the solid surface layer of the PVP@TBT droplets is gradually deformed by pulling inside due to the inner shrinking during solvent evaporation and TBT hydrolysis, which leads to the different morphologies of bowls, ink-bottles, and rings. Therefore, the electrosprayed materials with morphologies ranging from core–shell spheres to bowls, ink-bottles, and rings is caused by the PVP@TBT complex changing from a 2D linear to a 3D network structure.
In addition, we also noticed that the viscosity of the PVP@TBT complex sols increase as the aging time increases, which indicates that the complete formation of PVP@TBT 3D complex network may be a slow process. The amounts of water in the PVP@TBT sol are also important for the formation of the 3-D network during aging. As shown in Table 2, when more than 0.4 mL of water was presented, the PVP@TBT complexes become unstable, which will decompose after aging for only one day. If no water was presented, the viscosity of the PVP@TBT sol also increases as the aging time increases because moisture in the air can slowly enter the PVP@TBT sol. As aging affects the structure of the PVP@TBT complexes, it is inferred that the morphologies of electrosprayed materials should change in the course of aging, which are presented in Table 2. Taking 0.1 mL of water as an example, the morphologies change from spheres to bowls, to ink-bottles, to rings, and finally to microfibers as the aging time increases. For the PVP@TBT complex sols without water, the aging within 5 days does not change the morphologies. However, after 10 days, the sol has a very high viscosity and produces microfibers, as shown in Fig. 5F. However, the PVP@TBT complex sols decompose before microfibers are obtained when > 0.2 mL of water was present. Consequently, the microfibers can be formed when the viscosity of the PVP@TBT complexes is very high so that it cannot be atomized as spheres, but instead was pulled as fibers during electrospraying, as shown in Fig. 5F. Although electrospinning can also be used to make microfibers, these fibres contain much polymer, as a fact that they are polymer fibres. Here, our microfibers mainly consist of amorphous TiO2 because they only contain a small amount of PVP. Overall, aging is important for the complete conversion of the PVP@TBT complex from a 2-D linear to a 3-D network structure. According to the above analysis, the change mechanism of electrosprayed materials from core–shell spheres, to bowls, ink-bottles, rings and microfibers is shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Mechanism of transformation of electrosprayed materials from core–shell spheres, to bowls, ink-bottles, rings and microfibers. 
In order to check the structure of as-sprayed materials, FT-IR absorption spectra of the electrosprayed materials before and after washing by ethanol and water, and PVP are presented in Fig. 7. The CO stretching vibration of free PVP is very weak in the electrosprayed material, indicating that PVP still remains combined with TBT after electrospray. If it was washed by ethanol and water and further dried in air, it can be seen that the CO peak appears again. Water can gradually replace PVP adhering to TBT during washing, resulting in more free PVP that generates a CO vibration. Therefore, the as-sprayed materials should be PVP@a-TiO2 complex (a-TiO2 means amorphous TiO2 due to hydrolysis).

Transforming the electrosprayed material to hierarchical nanostructure by facile hydrothermal treatment
FE-SEM images of TiO2 spheres, TiO2 bowls, and TiO2 rings after post-hydrothermal treatment without and without using ammonia are presented in Fig. 8. Fig. 7A, C and E shows the morphologies of spheres, bowls, and rings without using ammonia, and Fig. 8 B, D and F shows the materials using ammonia. As shown in our previous study,22 the surface of the as-electrosprayed materials is very smooth and dense. After post-hydrothermal treatment, it can be seen that the structure of these materials obviously changes, with their shapes being reserved. If ammonia was not used, the hydrothermally treated materials consist of many uniform small nanoparticles, which tightly pack together and form mesoporous structures. In order to show the nanostructure, the amplifications of bowls and rings are shown in the top-right corners of Fig. 8C and E, which clearly shows that the TiO2 bowls and rings are composed of tightly packed nanoparticles. If ammonia was used during hydrothermal reaction, the TiO2 materials have completely different nanostructures after hydrothermal treatment, as shown in Fig. 8 B, D and F, which are composed of bigger nanoparticles with varying size. Due to the big nanoparticles, it can be seen that large pores form in these materials, which results in a much rougher surface. High-magnification FE-SEM images of Fig. 8F is also shown in the top-right corner, which shows that adding ammonia in the hydrothermal reaction can produce many irregular nanoparticles of different morphologies in ring-shaped TiO2. It is interesting to see that some of them are closed polygons that are constructed by several interconnected nanoparticles.
 Fig. 8  FE-SEM images of electrosprayed (A and B) spheres, (C and D) bowls, and (E and F) rings after hydrothermal post-treatment with and without ammonia (scale bar: A: 500 nm, B: 2 μm, C: 1.0 μm, D: 500 nm, E: 1.0 μm, F: 2.0 μm). 
As the nanostructures of TiO2 spheres, TiO2 bowls, and TiO2 rings were similar, the specific surface area and pore structure of the TiO2 spheres after hydrothermal treatment were determined using the BET method. The sample treated hydrothermally without using ammonia has a very high specific surface area of 198 cm2 g−1 and high pore volume of 0.67 cm2 g−1 (summation of pores with diameters ranging from 2 to 100 nm). The pore size shows a narrow distribution that centers at ca. 12 nm, as shown in our previous study.22 When ammonia was used, the specific surface area decreases to ∼60 m2 g−1, and the pore volume decreases to ∼0.48 cm3 g−1, with the pore size distribution increasing to ∼50 nm. Overall, the pore structure and specific surface area can be tuned by changing the hydrothermal conditions, i.e., adding ammonia or not. Fig. 9A shows the XRD patterns of the TiO2 spheres after hydrothermal treating with and without ammonia. It can be seen that the crystalline phase of TiO2 samples are anatase, and adding ammonia can obviously increase the crystallite size in TiO2 spheres, which is indicated by the narrowing of (101) peaks. Fig. 9B–D shows the TEM images of the nanoparticles in TiO2 spheres, corresponding to the samples in Fig. 7A and B. Fig. 9B shows that the nanoparticles in the TiO2 spheres after hydrothermal treatment without using ammonia are uniform with a diameter of ca. 10 nm. Fig. 9C depicts one of the large long nanoparticles in the TiO2 spheres hydrothermally treated with ammonia. This particle shows a broken polyhedron growing along the [001] direction, with a step-like {101} surface being formed. Fig. 9D is the amplification of Fig. 9C, which clearly shows that the nanoparticle contains three crystal facets of (101), (01), and (002).

It is seen from Fig. 8 that adding ammonia in the hydrothermal reaction can lead to completely different TiO2 nanostructures from spheres, to bowls, and TiO2 rings. As the as-sprayed materials contain much acetic acid, which should adhere on the amorphous TiO2 particle surface, the acetic acids can prevent the combination of adjacent particles during hydrothermal treatment without using ammonia, and consequently the TiO2 spheres, bowls, and rings are composed of tiny uniform nanoparticles. If ammonia was used, the hydroxyl groups (OH−) can substitute the acetic acids on TiO2 surface, resulting in the formation of OH− capped TiO2 nanoparticles. The adjacent OH− capped nanoparticles can combine together through dehydration reaction to form large nanoparticles with different morphologies, as shown in Fig. 8 B, D and F.
As shown in Fig. 10A, the electrosprayed microfibers are long and have a smooth surface. After hydrothermal treatment with ammonia, these break into short pieces (Fig. 10B and C). The fibers become very rough and contain many large pores, with the surface and internal structure being the same. Hydrothermal treatment without using ammonia also breaks the microfibers (Fig. 10D), and the amplified cross-sectional and surface photos are shown in Fig. 10E and F. It can be seen that the inside consists of uniform small nanoparticles, which pack together to form mesoporous structure. The surface is also composed of uniform TiO2 nanoparticles that pack so tightly that form a very dense surface with no obvious pores being seen.

Photocatalytic activity
The samples after hydrothermal treatment with ammonia were chosen to study the effect of morphologies on the photocatalytic activity. Fig. 11 shows the dependence of C0/C on time during the photo-degradation of MB water solution under UV light illumination. As post-heat treatment was always used to induce the crystallization of electrosprayed TiO2 materials, the photocatalytic activity of directly annealed TiO2 spheres was also checked for comparison. It can be seen that the hydrothermally treated TiO2 samples have low adsorption of MB molecule in the dark. The dark adsorption–desorption equilibrium is reached after 30 min. Under UV light illumination, the UV-Vis absorption of MB water solution decreases obviously due to the photocatalytic reaction. The quasi-first order rate constants of directly annealed spheres, hydrothermally treated spheres, broken fibers, bowls, and rings (mixed with ink-bottles) are ca. 0.008 min−1, 0.012 min−1, 0.020 min−1, 0.030 min−1, and 0.032 min−1, respectively. It can be seen that the photocatalytic activity of the hydrothermally treated samples are much better than that of the directly annealed spheres. The specific surface area and pore volume of the directly annealed sample are 32 m2 g−1, and 0.07 cm3 g−1, which is much lower than the hydrothermally treated sample. The low pore volume mean that the amount of MB water solution that can enter inside the TiO2 sphere is limited, and the low specific surface area also leads to the decrease of active surface, so the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 sphere is relatively lower. Although these hierarchical TiO2 materials show similar nanostructures, the photocatalytic activities are different, which shows that the material morphologies affect the photocatalytic activity. As shown in the inner of Fig. 11. It is considered that the morphologies of bowls, ink-bottles, and rings may favor light multi-scattering inside the nanostructural materials, which may increase light absorption, finally resulting in the increase in the photocatalytic activity.

Conclusion
In summary, PVP@TBT complex sols can be changed from a 2-D linear to a 3-D network structure in the presence of small amounts of water and by aging, which significantly affects the morphologies of electrosprayed materials. These materials can be tuned from core–shell spheres to bowls, ink-bottles, and rings, and microfibers as the structure of PVP@TBT complex sols changes from 2-D to 3-D. Hydrothermal post-treatment can change the electrosprayed materials to porous anatase TiO2 hierarchical materials with tunable specific surface area and pore size, and high pore volume. The materials with bowl, ink-bottle, and ring shapes showed better photocatalytic activity as compared to the solid balls and broken fibers, which is attributed to the multi-light scattering inside. Finally, due to the effective integration of special morphologies, high specific surface area, high pore volume, and tunable pore size, these nano-structured materials are also attractive for applications in other high-performance photoelectrochemical applications, such as DSSCs and lithium batteries.
