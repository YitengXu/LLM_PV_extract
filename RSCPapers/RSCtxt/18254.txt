    , Accepted 7th May 2016First published on 9th May 2016AbstractTwo new regular (D–A1–D–A2) terpolymers P1 and P2 containing two electron-deficient moieties, quinoxaline and benzothiadiazole, were designed and synthesized. The resulting copolymers exhibit high thermal stability, broad absorption in the range of 300 to 950 nm, low Eg of both 1.36 and 1.57 eV, as well as deep HOMO energy levels of −5.24 and −5.62 eV. Such properties are useful in improving photovoltaic properties. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on optimized P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM (1:2 by weight) active layers with a 3 v% DIO/CF additive displayed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.28% (Voc of 0.93 V, Jsc of 10.28 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.55) and 5.54% (Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 12.18 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.57), respectively, under illumination of AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2). In order to increase the PCE further, the DIO/CF processed active layer was subjected to methanol treatment that resulted in a PCE increase up to 7.13% and 7.59% for the P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM based devices, respectively. The methanol treatment increases all of the photovoltaic parameters, which is attributed to the lowering of series resistance, an increase of hole mobility, and reduction of charge recombination due to enlarged built-in potential.
Introduction
Over the past few decades, π-conjugated polymers have attracted considerable attention from researchers not only from an academic, but also from a practical point of view, due to their unique optical electronic properties and applications as an alternative to inorganic semiconductor materials in a variety of fiber-electronic devices such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)1 and organic solar cells (OSCs).2,3 Donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers with strict alternation of D and A chain structures along a macromolecule are most successful materials for high-performance field-effect transistors and photovoltaic devices.4–7 A number of electron-donor and electron-acceptor structures, such as benzodithiophene,8 dithienosilol,9 dithienopyrrole,10 benzothiadiazole (BT),11–13 diketopyrrolopyrrole,14 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione,15 isoindigo16 and quinoxaline17 have been extensively studied as donor and acceptor units for high performance D–A conjugated polymers. Nevertheless, due to complications in the development of appropriate new D–A building blocks via a common combination of D and A units, only a limited number of donor or acceptor units have been successful in achieving high performance polymer solar cells (PSCs). Terpolymers with a D–A1–D–A2 configuration, in which three subunits regularly alternate along the backbone chain, are promising candidates for designing new conjugated polymers targeted at high-efficiency PSCs. In comparison with alternating copolymer analogues, D–A1–D–A2 terpolymer utilization may lead to a more inclusive solar spectrum absorption range, as well as easily adjustable HOMO and LUMO energy levels. This strategy includes the introduction of an additional acceptor with an appropriate molar ratio into the D–A polymer chain, which allows for combining the advantages of the different units.18 In this respect, a number of conjugated terpolymers containing various building blocks have been developed that have demonstrated impressive photovoltaic properties due to their relatively large short-circuit current.19,20 On the other hand, it has been stated that D–A-based polymers with two types of randomly arranged acceptor units in the backbone chain generally demonstrate only moderate PSC characteristics.21–23 This may be due to internal structural defects in materials and less favorable molecular chain π-packing, which leads to unexpected traps and charge carrier transport suppression. In this regard, terpolymers with a regular arrangement of D–A units along the chain are highly valued because of their well-defined architecture, are capable of forming an ordered π-stacked structure, and can achieve higher charge mobilities. Moreover, in contrast to random polymers, regular terpolymers are usually prepared by regular linkage of building blocks. Wang et al. have developed a series of D–A1–D–A2 regular terpolymers and compared their photovoltaic characteristics with the corresponding random terpolymers and found that they exhibit a higher PCE of 5.03% with a significant increase in short circuit current of 11.56 mA cm−2, compared with random analogues.24 Chen et al. have shown that regular terpolymers based on thiophene alternating with phenanthrocarbazole and benzothiadiazole exhibit excellent photovoltaic characteristics compared with their random counterparts.25 Quite recently, Janssen et al. also showed improved photovoltaic characteristics (PCE ∼8.0%) in contrast to their corresponding common D–A-copolymer, indicating that regular terpolymers possess great potential for solar cell applications.26 Li et al. have developed new conjugated polymers containing two different acceptor units such as pentacyclic lactam and diketopyrrolopyrrole.27 These terpolymers exhibit a broad absorption range from 300 to 900 nm, a narrow bandgap of about 1.42 eV and a low lying HOMO at −5.23 eV. PSCs based on these polymers exhibit an efficiency of about 4.7%, a short-circuit current of 9.5 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.77 V and an FF of 0.64 with an energy loss of 0.65 eV.27 These results demonstrate that two different acceptors may be used in the development of D–A conjugated polymers in order to achieve corresponding energy levels for PSC applications. Many common D–A conjugated polymers containing Qx have been synthesized and used for PSC applications. D–A conjugated polymers based on Qx as an acceptor unit and fluorene or carbazole as a donor unit exhibit good PSC characteristics.28,29 Chen et al. developed high performance PSCs based on Qx-containing polymers with improved photovoltaic characteristics, i.e. open circuit voltage (Voc) = 0.76 V and short-circuit current Jsc = 18.2 mA cm−2, resulting in a high PCE value of 8.0%.30
Nevertheless, despite this successful example it has been already established that in most cases, such polymers based on quinoxaline, a weak electron-acceptor, always have notable drawbacks, namely a large bandgap (Eg) and a low value of the short-circuit current due to an insufficiently broad solar spectrum absorption range, which may seriously affect PSC performance. To obtain conjugated polymers with broad absorption and deeper lying HOMO levels, we have designed and synthesized two conjugated terpolymers denoted as P1 and P2 containing Qx derivatives as a weak acceptor unit and BT as a second strong acceptor block, and thiophene as a spacer. The Qx unit was selected as the acceptor block because it possesses strong electron affinity and for its facial synthesis. Moreover, in order to broaden the absorption and improve the solubility of the polymers, two alkyl-thiophene π-conjugated side chains were introduced into the quinoxaline unit. These terpolymers show intensive and broad absorption and low lying HOMO (<−5.14 eV) levels with a bandgap within 1.30–1.57 eV. P1 and P2 show much greater absorption than the corresponding common D–A1 and D–A2 alternating copolymers.31,32 Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on optimized P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM (1:2 by weight) active layers with a 3 v% DIO/CF additive displayed PCEs of 5.26% (Voc of 0.93 V, Jsc of 10.28 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.55) and 5.54% (Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 12.18 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.57), respectively, under illumination of AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2). The PCE of the devices was further improved up to 7.13% (Jsc = 10.76 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.02 V and FF = 0.65) and 7.59% (Jsc = 12.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V and FF = 0.68) for optimized DIO/CF processed P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM active layers, respectively, when methanol treatment of the active layer was adopted. Our results show that regular conjugated terpolymers with electron-deficient Qx and BT units exhibit broad absorption and narrower bandgaps and hence could potentially be used as electron-donors in high performance organic electronic devices.
Experimental part
All starting reagents were obtained commercially as analytical reagents and used directly without any purification. Toluene and THF were purified by distillation from sodium under a nitrogen atmosphere. Monomers M1,33M2,34 and M335 were prepared according to previously reported procedures.

1H NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and 100 MHz on a Bruker Avance spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The elemental analysis was performed with an Elementar Vario EL III element analyzer for C, H, N, and S determination. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by the GPC method on a Waters 515–2410 system with polystyrenes as the standard and chloroform as an eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 under a nitrogen atmosphere and at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The DSC analysis was performed on a DSC Q600 under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
Cyclic voltammetry was performed under an inert atmosphere at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NO4Cl) in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. An ITO glass slide covered with a thin layer polymer (20 nm) was used as the working electrode. The counter and reference electrodes were a Pt wire and Ag/Ag+, respectively. All potentials were referenced against the redox potential of Fc/Fc+. Internal reference was 0.32 V vs. Ag/Ag+.
Synthesis of terpolymer P1
The polymerization was performed through a Stille coupling reaction. In a 50 mL flask, M1 (0.3383 g, 0.5 mmol) and M3 (0.3130 g, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 15 mL toluene, and the solution was flushed with argon for 15 min, and then 27 mg Pd(PPh3)4 was added into the solution. The mixture was again flushed with argon for 20 min. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 48 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and added dropwise to 400 mL methanol. The precipitate was collected and further purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform in sequence. The chloroform fraction was concentrated and added drop-wise into methanol. Finally, the precipitates were collected and dried under vacuum overnight to obtain terpolymer P1 as a black solid (0.31 g, yield 77%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ (ppm) 7.64–6.71 (br, 12H, ArH), 2.89 (br, 4H, CH2), 1.77–0.50 (br, 30H, CH3, CH2).

Synthesis of terpolymer P2
Terpolymer P2 was synthesized by following the same procedure for terpolymer P1 but using M2 instead of M1. M2 (0.4234 g, 0.5 mmol) and M3 (0.3130 g, 0.5 mmol mg) were used as starting materials in the polymerization. Finally, P2 was obtained as a black solid (0.40 g, yield 82%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ (ppm) 8.35–6.75 (br, 14H, ArH), 2.88–1.90 (br, 4H, CH2), 2.35–0.53 (br, 30H, CH3, CH2). Elem.

Device fabrication and characterization
The PSCs were fabricated with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al. First of all, the indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially with detergent, deionized water and isopropanol and then dried under ambient conditions. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)] was deposited through spin coating on the pre-cleaned ITO coated glass substrates with a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Baytron PVP Al 4083) at 3000 rpm and dried subsequently at a temperature of 110 °C for 20 min in air. The active blend layers of the terpolymer and PC71BM were spin coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. For the terpolymer:PC71BM PSCs, the active layer (with different weight ratios) was formed by spin coating with DIO additive (concentration of DIO was varied from 0 to 4 v% in CF) solution containing 12 mg mL−1 of the terpolymer:PC71BM and dried for 20 min. Surface treatment was done by spin coating methanol on the top of the active layer at 2500 rpm at room temperature until the active layer was completely covered by methanol and dried. Finally, the top electrode (Al) was deposited in a vacuum onto the active layer. The active area of the device was 20 mm2. The thickness of the photosensitive layer was around 90 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source-Measure Unit. A xenon lamp (150 W) coupled with a AM 1.5 solar spectrum filter was used as the light source and the optical power of the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was recorded using a monochromator and a 150 W xenon lamp and the resulting photocurrent was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions.
The devices used for the hole mobility measurement were fabricated using the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/terpolymer:PC71BM/Au. Hole mobility was calculated by fitting the current density–voltage (J–V) curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space-charge limited current, SCLC). The SCLC can be approximated by the equation:  Here J is the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the terpolymer, εo is the free-space permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), μo is the charge mobility in a zero field, γ is the constant, L is the thickness of the blended film layer, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of monomers and terpolymers
Monomers 5,8-dibromo-2,3-bis(5-octylthiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline (M1),33 5,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,3-bis(5-octylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (M2),34 and M335 were synthesized according to the literature and their structure and purity were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.
We prepared the two terpolymers P1 and P2 that contain benzothiadiazole (BT) and quinoxaline (Qx) as acceptor units, respectively. The regioregular copolymers P1 and P2 were synthesized by the Stille cross-coupling reaction of M1 or M2 and 4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c]-1,2,5-thiadiazole M3 in a 1:1 monomer ratio and in the presence of Pd(Ph3P)4 as the catalyst and in toluene as the solvent, with a high yield of 77% and 82% for P1 and P2, respectively (Scheme 1). To obtain the D–A1–D–A2 type regular terpolymers P1 and P2, monomers M1 and M2 based on the quinoxaline building block should be synthesized primarily and then coupled with the benzothiadiazole based acceptor monomer M3. The structure and purity of P1 and P2 were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (as shown in Fig. S1, ESI†). The copolymers were purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform to remove small molecular and residual catalysts. The chloroform fraction was precipitated in methanol again and a dark purple polymer was obtained after drying in a vacuum oven. P1 and P2 showed good solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. The molecular weights of the terpolymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with chloroform as an eluent and polystyrene as the calibration standard. P1 and P2 showed number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 30.5 and 22.5 kg mol−1 with a PDI index of 1.93 and 18.2, respectively.

The TGA results are listed in Table 1. Both terpolymers showed decomposition temperatures (5% loss weight) above 340 °C. They are thermally stable for applications in optoelectronic devices.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the terpolymers in chloroform solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding optical properties are summarized in Table 1. Both terpolymers showed dual optical absorption bands with high and low-energy bands that can be attributed to π–π* and internal charge-transfer (ICT) transitions between the donor and acceptor units, respectively. Terpolymers P1 and P2 show absorption peaks (λmaxabs) in the chloroform solutions at 622 and 568 nm, respectively. The λmaxabs of P2 showed a large red shift of ∼32 nm from the solution state to the solid film, as a result of aggregation and π–π stacking. The absorption peaks in the low-energy region (600–950 nm) of P2 in both the solutions and the films are slightly blue-shifted compared to P1, which may be attributed to the increase in the electron donating capability of the two thiophenes. The absorption of the P1 thin film became broad and the λmaxabs almost showed no red-shift compared to that of the solution. Optical band gaps, as measured by the onset of UV-Vis absorption in the solid state, are 1.57 for P1 and 1.36 eV for P2, which are closer to the ideal band gap of the donor polymers of PSCs.36 This indicates that the Qx flanked with thiophenes at both sides (P2) leads to a decrease of the optical bandgap of the copolymer, which is beneficial for efficient PSCs. Moreover, the observed redshift in the thin film absorption spectrum of P2 compared to P1 indicates that increasing the thiophene rings leads to an increase of the π–π stacking in the solid state. This decrease in the band gap is due to the effective increase in the conjugation length of the polymers.37

To investigate the electrochemical properties of the developed P1 and P2 D–A1–D–A2 terpolymers, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was also carried out. The CV curves are illustrated in Fig. 3 and the data are summarized in Table 1. Both polymers exhibit quasi-reversible oxidation and reduction features. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated according to the following equation:38  where Eoxdonset and Eredonset are the onset oxidation potential and onset reduction potential vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. Therefore, the resulting HOMO/LUMO values of P1 and P2 are estimated to be −5.54 eV/−3.80 eV and −5.24 eV/−3.70 eV, respectively. The deep HOMO energy levels of terpolymers P1 and P2 ensure high Voc in the corresponding PSCs because the Voc is limited by the difference between the HOMO of the donor (polymer) and the LUMO of the acceptor (PC71BM).36 The deeper HOMO energy level of P1 compared to P2 may be attributed to the presence of the additional thiophene rings that increase the donor strength in the P2 backbone, and as a result raise the HOMO level. This result is consistent with those reported by other research groups that the HOMO energy levels of the copolymers in a push pull system are primarily determined by the donor strength,39 and with those reported by Lidzey et al. that the HOMO levels increased due to the electron donating properties of the thiophene unit.40 Additionally, it is also found that the LUMO energy levels of the terpolymers are located within a suitable range, which is much higher than that of PC71BM. Therefore, efficient charge transfer and separation could be expected to occur in their resulting PSCs. The actual offsets between the LUMO levels of the two terpolymers P1 and P2 and the LUMO level of PC71BM (−4.1 eV) are 0.40 eV and 0.50 eV. These offsets are larger than 0.3 eV, which is generally accepted as a minimum driving force for the efficient exciton separation in free charges.38 The electrochemical band gaps were found to be 1.74 and 1.54 eV for P1 and P2, respectively, which are larger than the observed optical band gaps and this discrepancy might be induced by the presence of the energy barrier at the interface between the polymer film and the electrode surface.38

Theoretical calculations
We have additionally performed a theoretical study on the P1 and P2 molecular structures within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). Details on the computations are given in the ESI.† The first round of geometry optimization was performed using the Turbomole package.41 All of the follow up calculations were performed using the Gaussian package.42
The first round of calculations was the geometry optimizations of the P1 and P2 structures. The main body of the P1 and P2 structures (not including the alkanes) is highly planar. The linking thiophene moieties form small dihedral angles (up to 5°) both between themselves as well as with the benzothiadiazole (BT) moiety (present in both the structures) and with the characteristic moiety (different for each structure), namely dithiophene-thienopyrazine (TTP) and dithiophene-quinoxaline (TQx), respectively, for P2 and P1. We have calculated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the optical gaps, defined here as the energetically lowest allowed vertical electronic excitation, employing the PBE, M06, and B3LYP functionals. In Table 2, in addition to the frontier orbitals’ energy levels, we also provide the optical gap, the main contributions to the first excitation as well as the wavelength of the first excitation and of the excitations with the largest oscillator strengths.

The HOMO–LUMO (HL) gap of each structure calculated using the hybrid B3LYP functional is fairly smaller than that using the meta-hybrid M06 functional, however, the calculated optical gaps are only marginally smaller. The calculated optical gaps are low (near or less than 2 eV), with the lowest one corresponding to the P2 structure that also exhibits stronger oscillator strengths. In Table 2 we also provide the character of the first allowed excitations only for contributions larger than 4%. The first excitation, as calculated by each of the functional for both structures, clearly exhibits a single-configuration character, with the exception of the first excitation produced by the PBE function for the P2 structure.
In Fig. 4, we have plotted the isosurfaces (isovalue = 0.02) of the HOMO and LUMO for both the structures. In the ESI† we provide the next nearest frontier orbital isosurfaces of P1 and P2 that are involved in transitions with strong contributions to the first few excitations. For both the structures the HOMO is extended over the main body that consists of the linking thiophene groups and the moieties directly linked to them. For the LUMO of each structure the delocalizations are qualitatively different. The LUMO of P2 extends over the thiophene linking chain of the main body, similar to the HOMO but with the main difference of a greater percentage over BT and TTP. This is even more prominent in the case of P1 but only for the BT moiety. For the near frontier orbital isosurfaces (provided in Fig. S2 ESI†) significant similarities are noted between the corresponding orbitals of P1 and P2. Detailed contributions of transitions to electronic excitations are given in the ESI.† To quantify the contributions of the moieties to the frontier orbitals we have calculated the total and partial density of states (PDOS). The PDOS for P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). We partition the structures into BT and the linking thiophenes, for both structures, as well as the characteristic moieties TTP and TQx for P2, and P1, respectively. Both the structures make high contributions to the HOMO from the linking thiophene moieties, at 60% and 52% for P2 and P1, respectively. The contribution of the BT moieties to the HOMO is also significantly less but notable, at 9% and 3% for P2 and P1, respectively. The most significant differences are with respect to the contribution of the characteristic moiety, specifically at 30% and 18% for P2 (TTP) and P1 (TQx), respectively. This difference also exists in the case of LUMO, to which the contributions of the characteristic moieties are 38% and 16% for P2 (TTP) and P1 (TQx), respectively. These are in agreement with our earlier observations on the orbital delocalizations, and lead to a qualitatively different character (with respect to charge transfer) of the first excitation which is, as already noted, mainly a HOMO → LUMO transition in both cases. Compared to HOMO, the contributions of the thiophene moieties to the LUMO are reduced to 28% and 20%, for P2 and P1, respectively. The contributions of the BT moiety to the LUMO for P2 and P1 are at 33% and 64%, respectively.

In Fig. 5 we show the UV/visible absorption spectra of the P1 and P2 structures calculated at the TD-DFT/M06 level of theory, accounting for solvent effects both of CF and the gas phase. In Fig. S3 (see the ESI†) we also provide the corresponding spectra calculated using the B3LYP functional, which only slightly overestimates (by ∼10 nm in the small wavelength region and by ∼50 nm in the large wavelength region) the wavelengths and retains all the main characteristics compared with those obtained using M06 and the experimental spectra. The absorption spectra of P1 and P2 exhibit two main bands with high absorbance at 570 nm and ∼345 nm for P1 and 730 nm and ∼400 nm for P2. The low wavelength band in both cases exhibits subpeaks; specifically, in the wavelength range of 250–310 nm for P1 and 300–360 nm for P2.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of these copolymers, PSCs with a device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1 or P2:PC71BM/Al were fabricated. The optimized conditions of device fabrication were obtained by varying the donor to acceptor weight ratio, active layer thickness and solvent additives. Initially, we varied the D/A ratios (P1 or P2:PC71BM, wt/wt, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5 in CF solution), prepared the devices and tested their photovoltaic properties. The optimal D/A ratio obtained for both P1 and P2 is 1:2. The photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. The device based on P1 showed a PCE of 3.30% with a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 8.02 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.42. However, the P2 based device showed a PCE of 3.51% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 9.28 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.45. P1 is an A–D–A–D terpolymer with a larger optical bandgap and deeper LUMO energy level (−3.80 eV) leading to a low exciton dissociation rate, since the exciton dissociation rate is directly related to the energy offset between the LUMO of the donor and acceptor used in the active layer, which shows a low Jsc value for the resulting device. However P2 is a D–A–D–D–A–D terpolymer with a relatively small bandgap due to the increase in the number of thiophene donor units, the band gap decreases due to the increased conjugation. The LUMO level of P2 (−3.70 eV) also higher as compared to P1, resulting in an improvement of the exciton dissociation rate, leading to a higher Jsc for the corresponding device. The high Voc obtained for the P1 based device compared to P2 may be attributed to the deeper HOMO energy level of P1 relative to P2, since the Voc is directly related to the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor offset. The electron-donating characteristics were reinforced in P2 and with the influence of the spacers (thiophene), lead to an increase in the HOMO level with a reduction in the Voc value.

It is well known that the use of 3% 1,8-diiodooctane as the solvent additive for the spin-coating process of the active layer is helpful to form favorable morphologies in the blend films of the polymer and PC71BM, and thus can be used to realize better photovoltaic performance in devices.43 In order to improve the PCE of the devices, we varied the amount of DIO, 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% (v/v DIO/CF) and tested the devices to obtain the optimal ratio for the DIO additive, and found that for both P1 and P2, the optimal ratio is 3%. In addition, the thickness of the active layer was also varied and we found that the optimal active layer thickness for both P1 and P2 based devices are in the range of 90–100 nm. Fig. 6a and b show the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under 100 mW cm−2 illumination and the IPCE spectra, respectively, of the optimized devices (DIO (3 v%/CF)). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The P1:PC71BM based device showed a PCE of 5.26% with a Voc of 0.93 V, a Jsc of 10.28 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.55. Under the same conditions, the P2:PC71BM device exhibited a higher PCE of 5.54% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 12.18 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.57. The PCE value of the PSCs was significantly improved with the solvent additive compared to the devices without the additive. The solvent additive had a positive effect on Jsc and FF but the Voc slightly decreased. This is mainly because DIO possesses a high boiling point and is able to solvate the PC71BM leading to a comprehensive impact on Jsc by providing a more optimal morphology for facilitating charge carrier transportation.44 However, the reduction of Voc can be attributed to the lowering of charge-separated and charge-transfer-state energies with the introduction of the additive.45 Moreover, we assume that the addition of DIO decreases the size of fullerene domains and facilitates the formation of a bicontinuous inter-penetrating donor–acceptor network. The higher value of Jsc for the P2 based device may be related to its low optical bandgap and relatively high energy LUMO offset between the P2 and PCBM (0.5 eV) compared to P1 and PC71BM (0.40 eV), as well as the broader absorption profile of the P2:PC71BM. The increase of Jsc is also confirmed by the IPCE spectra since the IPCE spectra are broader for the P2 based devices, which closely resemble the absorption spectra of P2. The Jsc values estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra are about 10.13 mA cm−2 and 12.08 mA cm−2 for P1 and P2 based devices, respectively, and very close to those experimentally observed from J–V characteristics under illumination.

As the charge carrier mobility within the device plays a key role in the device performance of PSCs, we fabricated hole-only devices as described in the Experimental part. The hole mobilities of P1 and P2 calculated by fitting the dark J–V characteristics (Fig. 7) of the hole-only devices with the SCLC model46 were 1.62 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for as-cast P1 and P2 based blended active layers, respectively. The enhanced hole mobility of P2 compared to P1 may be ascribed to the more planar conformation and the extended conjugated side chain of P2. Thus, the π–π interaction of the resultant terpolymer P2 was enhanced, and its mobility was improved. Moreover, the hole mobilities of P1 and P2 in the blend cast from solvent additives were increased up to 7.82 × 10−5 and 8.78 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
 Fig. 7  Current–voltage characteristics in the dark for the devices to estimate the hole mobility in the active layers. 
To support our result of improved photovoltaic performance, the morphology of the active layer was recorded using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and is shown in Fig. 7 for P2:PC71BM and P1:PC71BM active layers. As shown in Fig. 8, both the blended films without the DIO additive have coarse dispersive domains and can hamper the exciton diffusion, leading to low Jsc values and poor PCE values. The morphology of the active layer cast with the DIO additive was significantly different. The larger crystallites and phase separated domains disappeared and a very fine nanoscale morphology within the range of exciton diffusion length was observed, causing favorable exciton diffusion and transportation of dissociated free charge carriers, resulting in an improvement of the PCE with a high Jsc and FF.

Although the solvent additive improves the overall PCE of the PSCs, researchers have reported that additive residues in the active layer of fabricated devices may restrict the photovoltaic performance of the resulting devices,47 due to the low volatility of DIO. In order to improve the PCE of the PSCs, we have adopted the surface treatment of the active layer by methanol. The low boiling point of methanol and poor solubility of most of the organic materials in the active layer in methanol make the post solvent treatment feasible.48 The current–voltage characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 6a and the photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. After the methanol treatment of the active layer, the PCE of the PSCs was improved up to 7.13% (Jsc = 10.76 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.02 and FF = 0.65) and 7.59% (Jsc = 12.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V and FF = 0.68) for the P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM active layers, respectively. It can be seen from Table 3 that the PCE has been improved by the methanol treatment of the active layer, which is attributed to the simultaneous improvement of Jsc, Voc, and FF. The increase in the Jsc value after the methanol treatment is consistent with the IPCE spectra of the devices (Fig. 6b). The Jsc values estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra are 10.63 mA cm−2 and 12.85 mA cm−2 for P1 and P2 based devices, respectively, which are in good agreement with the values estimated from the J–V characteristics under illumination. The Voc for the devices with methanol treatment is higher than that for the devices without methanol treatment, which may be attributed to the increase in Vbi in the devices. In order to gain information about the increase in the Voc, we have measured the dark J–V characteristics and shown them in Fig. 9 (only for P2:PC71BM based devices). The device with methanol treatment exhibits a turn on voltage which is higher than that for the device without treatment, and indicates that the built-in voltage (Vbi) of the device increases after the methanol treatment. The Vbi which influences the internal electric field in polymer BHJ solar cells is an important parameter and gives the upper limit for the Voc provided that the work function difference of the electrodes is larger than the donor HOMO–acceptor LUMO offset of the BHJ.49 Thus the increase of Vbi may be responsible for the increase in Voc in the devices after the methanol treatment. The enhancement in the Voc may also be attributed to the interfacial dipole between the active layer and the metal cathode induced by the methanol treatment.50 The interfacial dipole may induce an increased built-in potential across the active layer, which is beneficial for charge carrier transport and collection with decreased charge recombination, leading to an increase in the FF and PCE of the devices based on the methanol treated active layers. The increase in Jsc and FF may be affected by Rs (as the slope of J–V characteristics under illumination increases), which is decreased after the methanol surface treatment, charge transport properties, charge extraction and charge recombination.

The effect of the methanol treatment on the charge transport properties was further investigated by measuring the charge carrier mobilities using the same method as described earlier in Fig. 7. The hole mobility further increases up to 2.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM after the methanol treatment, whereas the electron mobility remains unchanged, i.e. about 2.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus, better balanced charge transport in devices can be achieved, which increases the FF of the devices by restricting the build-up of space charges, hence reducing recombination.51
Conclusions
In this study we successfully synthesized two terpolymers P1 and P2 containing two electron-deficient moieties quinoxaline and benzothiadiazole and thiophene donor units. With the increase of thiophene units, both the optical and the electrochemical bandgaps decrease, and the HOMO energy level tends to increase. These terpolymers were used as donors along with PCBM for the fabrication of BHJ PSCs. Although by increasing the thiophene donor units the Voc decreases, the PCE is higher for the P2 (3.51%) based PSC compared to P1 (3.30%) (as-cast active layer without any solvent additive), due to the increased absorption profile and slightly higher hole mobility. The devices with optimized active layers processed with DIO additives showed PCEs of 5.26% and 5.54% for the P1 and P2 terpolymers, respectively, as the donor. The increase of the PCE is mainly related to an increase in hole mobility and better nanoscale morphology of the active layer for exciton dissociation and charge transport. The PCE was further improved up to 7.13% and 7.59% for P1 and P2, respectively, when the DIO/CF processed active layer was treated with methanol before the deposition of the final Al electrode. The increase in the PCE due to the simultaneous improvement in Jsc, Voc and FF is related to charge transportation and extraction induced by the methanol treatment. The effects of the methanol treatment of the active layer on the enhancement in the photovoltaic performance of the device may originate from the increase in the built-in-potential across the device due to the interfacial dipole between the active layer and the metal electrode. Combined with decreased series resistance and increased mobilities, the accelerated and enlarged charge extraction and reduced charge recombination lead to simultaneous enhancement in the Voc, Jsc, and FF of the devices after the methanol treatment.
