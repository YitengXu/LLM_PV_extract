    , Accepted 20th October 2022First published on 20th October 2022AbstractDeveloping and utilizing solar to chemical energy conversion is a promising and efficient approach to green carbon-neutral energy systems. Herein, we report a facile solvothermal reaction strategy using black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets coupled with bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) to prepare uniform BP/BiOCl composite nanocatalysts with enhanced wide-spectrum light absorption and electron-rich P modulated surface acid–base properties. BP/BiOCl possesses a typical layered structure showing the features of excellent separation of electron–hole pairs and electron transfer for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. Notably, the engineered BP/BiOCl nanocomposite with substantial BP–BiOCl synergy exhibits a superior CO production rate of up to 260 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 130 and 13 times higher than those of BP and BiOCl counterparts, respectively. Meanwhile, the BP/BiOCl material shows excellent photostability for CO2 transformation under visible light irradiation. The 13C isotope labeling experiment confirms that the carbon source of C-containing products is derived from the CO2 substrate during the photocatalysis process. The S-scheme mechanism involving excited electron transfer and direct participation in chemical activation of inert CO2 molecules, generation of key intermediate CO*, and final gas products for photocatalytic CO2 reduction over the BP/BiOCl composite is thus proposed.
1. Introduction
With the burning of fossil fuels, the excessive emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) has led to a series of environmental problems, which have been regarded as an essential part of the significant challenges, such as global warming, land desertification, and climate change.1–6 The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, inspired by artificial photosynthesis, has attracted widespread attention due to its ability to convert CO2 emissions into renewable fuels or valuable hydrocarbons.7–10 However, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process still faces many problems that need to be overcome.11,12 Due to the high thermodynamic stability of CO2 and relatively high negative reduction potential, the low efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction is the major limitation.13,14 In addition, the diversity of products from the catalytic CO2 reduction leads to the bottleneck of selectivity.15 For the reasons mentioned above, excellent catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability become one of the keys to the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process.
Many traditional inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts, including metal oxides,16,17 metal sulfides,18,19 metal nitrides,20 and their complexes, have attracted extensive attention. However, a single inorganic semiconductor catalyst is usually challenging to achieve high CO2 reduction activity. Therefore, heterostructures are widely used to expand the light absorption range and improve the carrier mobility of the catalyst, and thus improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.21,22 In recent years, most of the photocatalysts developed are two-dimensional semiconductor nanocomposites. Two-dimensional semiconductor materials generally show fast charge transport, large specific surface areas, and abundant active sites, which enable them to act as photocatalysts.23
Black phosphorus (BP) with a two-dimensional layered structure has attracted much attention due to its high carrier mobility and tunable direct bandgap.23,24 Unlike zero bandgap graphene, the BP semiconductor possesses a thickness-dependent bandgap ranging from 0.3 eV for bulk BP to 2.0 eV for monolayer phosphorene, making it a promising efficient broad-spectrum absorption photocatalyst.23,25 As early as 2018, Ji et al. reported that ball-milled BP nanosheets could be used for high-performance photocatalytic hydrogen generation under visible light irradiation.26 In order to achieve broad and strong light absorption from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near infrared spectrum (NIR) region, Zhu et al. designed a binary BP/g-C3N4 metal-free nanohybrid catalyst and demonstrated that the interfacial interaction between BP and g-C3N4 effectively enhanced the photocatalytic performance.27 Although bare BP shows good photocatalytic performances, the internal photogenerated electron–hole (e−–h+) pairs are easily recombined, which greatly reduces the photocatalytic efficiency. The intrinsic instability under ambient conditions also severely limits its further application in photocatalysis. Thence, regulating the surface/interface of BP is always considered to be an effective way to enhance the chemical stability of BP. Surface modification, doping, and construction of BP-based heterostructures can effectively improve the stability of BP, and thus endow BP with more potential applications.27,28 Constructing BP-based heterostructures and composites can improve the photocatalytic stability and promote the carrier separation, thus ultimately boosting the photocatalytic performance.
Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) is a semiconductor photocatalyst with a special layer stacking structure,29 and non-uniform charge distribution between the [Bi2O2] group and the chloride layers. It has been widely used as a typical material for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants due to the fast electron transport ability, excellent environmental stability and high photocatalytic activity. With the development of photocatalytic CO2 reduction technology, BiOCl has also been applied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.30 However, due to the large forbidden band-width of BiOCl, it can only be excited by UV light that occupies a small amount of solar energy. Moreover, the high recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers of BiOCl in the bulk phase also limits its practical application in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.31
Inspired by our recent work on BP coupled conductive black titania nanocomposites with enhanced wide-spectrum sunlight response properties for solar-light-driven CO2 reduction,32 herein, we demonstrate graphene-like BP-supported BiOCl nanocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to value-added chemicals. Based on both materials’ advantages, composite nanocatalysts can significantly enhance the visible light response properties, carrier mobility of the intrinsic BiOCl, and overall photocatalysis efficiency. Furthermore, the electron-rich P element as a basic agent can effectively modulate the composite nanocatalysts’ electronic structure and surface acid–base properties, thus improving the chemical adsorption and activation of the acidic CO2 molecules. These materials show high light absorption ability for solar to chemical energy conversion. The activity is larger than that of the BiOCl counterpart and comparable with those of the previously reported noble-metal-free solid catalysts under identical reaction conditions. Besides, the BP/BiOCl hybrid catalyst exhibits excellent photostability for CO2 reduction. For in-depth insights into the catalyst microstructure, structure–activity relationship, and reaction mechanism of the BP/BiOCl catalyst for photocatalytic CO2 transformation, extensive characterization by UV-Vis, Mott–Schottky measurement, Raman, X-ray diffraction (XRD), photocurrent test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of BP nanosheets
BP nanosheets were prepared by the liquid-phase exfoliation method.26 Briefly, 50 mg of bulk BP was first ground into powder in an Ar-filled glove box and then transferred into 50 mL of dehydrated and Ar-saturated N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). After 12 h of continuous sonication in an ice–water bath, the BP/NMP mixture turned into a brown dispersion, and later the obtained dispersion was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to remove the unexfoliated and thick BP. The collected supernatant was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 30 min to obtain gray-black solid BP nanosheets. Afterward, the solid BP nanosheets were washed with dehydrated and Ar-saturated ethanol several times to remove the residual NMP liquid and vacuum-dried at 40 °C for 12 h.
2.2. Fabrication of BP-supported bismuth chloride oxide (BP/BiOCl)
The BP/BiOCl hybrid catalyst was synthesized via the solvothermal reaction. Desired amounts of BP nanosheets and Bi(NO3)3·5H2O were first added into 20 mL of dehydrated and Ar-saturated ethanol solvents, followed by sufficient sonication for 2 h to form a homogeneous dispersion. Then, 20 mL of KCl solution (0.5 mol L−1) was further dropwise added into the above homogeneous dispersion with magnetic stirring for 30 min. In the following, the mixture dispersion was transferred into a 50 mL stainless-steel autoclave lined with Teflon and reacted at 180 °C for 12 h. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, the collected precipitate of BP/BiOCl was obtained by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 20 min. The BP/BiOCl hybrid was successfully washed with ethanol and distilled water three times and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight.
2.3. Instruments and characterization
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were determined using the Micromeritics ASAP 2460 equipment. A field emission transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100F) was used to characterize the morphology of BP, BiOCl, and BP/BiOCl hybrid catalysts. The Raman spectra of the catalysts were collected using a Lab RAM HR800 Raman spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, France). XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.541874 Å). The UV-Vis diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) for the BP, BiOCl and BP/BiOCl catalysts were obtained using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2600). UPS spectra were recorded using a PHI5000 VersaProbe III system.
2.4. Photoelectrochemical characterization
To determine the photoelectrochemical properties, the photoelectrodes were prepared by coating the catalyst ink onto fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO) surfaces. Toward the preparation of catalyst ink, 10 mg of catalysts and 1 mg of ethyl-cellulose were added into 1 mL of α-terpineol and 0.5 mL of ethanol. After 6 h of sonication, 10 μL of the above catalyst ink was coated onto a piece of FTO glass (1.0 × 1.0 cm2) and dried at 60 °C to obtain the photoelectrodes. A three-electrode electrolytic cell system with photoelectrodes, Pt foil, and Ag/AgCl electrode as the working, counter, and reference electrodes was used to investigate the photoelectrochemical properties. 0.1 M KHCO3 filled with CO2 was used as an electrolyte. The photocurrent response was examined without the bias potential, and the interval between the on and off state was 10 s. The LSV curves were recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curve was obtained using the OCP as the starting voltage with an amplitude of 0.01 V.
2.5. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions were performed in a gas-tight circulation system (Labsolar 6A, Perfect Light). 10 mg of the photocatalyst sample was dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water with stirring. After complete degassing (1.2 kPa) in the reactor, 70 kPa of CO2 (ca. 8.48 mmol CO2) was injected, and the suspension was then irradiated with a 300 W Xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300D) equipped with 420 and 700 nm cut-off filters. During irradiation, the reaction suspension was maintained at 2 °C by circulating cooling water. An on-line gas chromatograph (GC 2014) with a flame ionization detector (FID) was used to analyze the evolved gases such as CH4 and C2H4 every hour, and Ar was used as the carrier gas. A packed column (TDX-01) connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was applied for the analysis of CO2, CO, and H2. For the liquid phase products in the reaction process, Shimadzu's GC-MS was used for testing; the carrier gas is He gas. 1 mL of the reaction solution was taken, centrifuged at 16000 rpm to remove the catalyst in the solution, and then the m/z of MS started from 10 to 100, the test duration was 30 min, and the temperature was 250 °C.
3. Results and discussion
As illustrated in Fig. 1a, a solvothermal method was employed to prepare the BP/BiOCl hybrid with BiOCl nanoparticles in situ modified on the surface of BP nanosheets. The amount of both BP and BiOCl components can be precisely controlled during the preparation process. The exfoliated BP nanosheets with lateral dimensions of several hundred nanometers are visible along with the stacking (Fig. 1e). From the HRTEM images shown in Fig. 1f and g, it can be observed that the mean size of BiOCl nanoparticles in the BP/BiOCl composite is on the nm scale. Moreover, the BP and BiOCl structures are in close contact with each other with a visible interface between them. Note that the interplanar spacing to the BiOCl (003) plane of 0.226 nm (Fig. 1g) is lower than the conventional value of 0.274 nm (inset in Fig. 1d).29

Moreover, the lattice parameters of 0.337 and 0.354 nm ascribed to the (112) plane of BP nanosheets (Fig. 1g) also show contraction and expansion relative to the bulk BP material.26,27 These results suggest that the lattice mismatch between in situ formed BiOCl nanoparticles and the BP substrate has existed. The contraction and expansion in the lattice parameters at the BP–BiOCl interface could result in substantial synergy and, thus higher catalytic efficiency. From the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, as shown in Fig. 1h and Fig. S1, S2 (ESI†), the elements of Bi, Cl, P, and O are well distributed on the surface of the BP/BiOCl hybrid, demonstrating the successful combination of BP and BiOCl. According to nitrogen adsorption–desorption data depicted in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (ESI†), the available BET surface area and typical hierarchical porous structures of the BP/BiOCl composite are beneficial for the effective transfer and separation of reactants and products.
The XRD patterns and Raman spectra were further used to analyze the BP/BiOCl hybrid structure. From the XRD patterns of BP shown in Fig. 2a, the prominent characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 16.7°, 34.9°, and 52.7° are respectively ascribed to the crystalline peaks for the (020), (040), and (060) planes of orthorhombic BP.26,27 The actual XRD patterns of the BiOCl compound are in good agreement with the standard data (JCPDS 97-9143). Three dominating peaks at 11.9°, 25.9°, and 33.5° are attributed to the (001), (101), and (102) planes of BiOCl,33 respectively. For the BP/BiOCl hybrid nanocatalyst, the main characteristic peaks of BiOCl and BP exist, implying the successful combination of BP and BiOCl materials. Furthermore, in the Raman spectra of the BP sample, there are three typical peaks located at 357.9, 432.2, and 460.1 cm−1, respectively, assigned to Ag1 (out-of-plane mode), B2g (in-plane mode along the zigzag direction), and Ag2 (in-plane mode along the armchair direction) phonon modes of BP (Fig. 2b).34 There are two weak Raman peaks at 146.4 and 203.1 cm−1 for the BiOCl sample. After incorporation with BiOCl nanoparticles, the composite Raman peaks show a visible blue-shift to a higher wavenumber, suggesting the electronic structure changes and considerable interactions between the BP and BiOCl components, consistent with the above HRTEM data. These could result in BP–BiOCl substantial synergy and, thus higher photocatalytic performance.

UV-Vis-NIR spectra were recorded to investigate the synthesized photocatalysts’ light response since the sample's optical absorption performance determines the photocatalytic reaction activity. As shown in Fig. 3a, the light absorption intensity of BP nanosheets in the 400–800 nm range is weaker, while BiOCl and BP/BiOCl exhibit strong values. The absorption edges of the BiOCl nanoparticles and BP nanosheets are located at 400 and 790 nm, respectively. According to the light absorption properties, the bandgap energy of BP, BiOCl, and BP/BiOCl can be calculated as 1.59, 3.30, and 1.48 eV, respectively, as shown in the data in Fig. 3b–d. In addition, BP/BiOCl displays the highest light absorption intensity compared to other bare samples in ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions (Fig. 3a). These show a strong interfacial interaction between BP nanosheets and BiOCl nanoparticles in BP/BiOCl composites, which is consistent with the above-mentioned HRTEM and Raman results. Thus, BP-supported bismuth chloride oxide can significantly improve the catalyst light absorption ability and photocatalytic performance.

The electrochemical tests for these catalysts were conducted to study the behavior of photogenerated e−–h+ pairs. Transient photocurrent spectra were also used to examine the charge separation efficiency. As can be seen from Fig. 4a, the BP/BiOCl material obtained via the combination of BiOCl nanoparticles and BP nanosheets shows a significantly higher photocurrent response than BP nanosheets and BiOCl counterparts. This suggests that the carrier separation is more efficient and the charge transfer in the composite material is improved. In addition, the magnitude of the charge transfer resistance and the separation efficiency of the photogenerated e−–h+ pairs were further studied using EIS, the results of which are shown in Fig. 4b. The smaller the arc at the beginning of EIS,28 the higher the migration efficiency of the catalyst on photogenerated carriers. Compared with bare BP nanosheets and BiOCl nanoparticles, the radius of the arc in the EIS corresponding to BP/BiOCl is smaller, which indicates that the charge transfer resistance of BP/BiOCl is significantly weaker than those of BP and BiOCl. BP/BiOCl enables rapid separation and transportation of photo- induced e−–h+ pairs. Thus, BP/BiOCl composites can exhibit better photocatalytic performance. As can be seen from the LSV curves in Fig. 4c, the overpotential of BP/BiOCl is lower than that of BP nanosheets and BiOCl at the same current density, indicating that the hybridization of BP nanosheets and BiOCl nanoparticles significantly enhances the environmental stability of BP. These results prove that the formation of elegant hybrids promotes the photogenerated carrier separation and charge transfer.

To explore the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst, we investigated the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of BP/BiOCl catalysts with various feed ratios and bare BP and BiOCl. Note that the BP/BiOCl composite nanocatalysts with the initial feed ratios of 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:5 were denoted as BP/BiOCl-21, BP/BiOCl-11, BP/BiOCl-12, BP/BiOCl-13, and BP/BiOCl-15, respectively (Fig. S5, ESI†). BP modified BiOCl samples with appropriate amounts display enhanced performance compared to bare BiOCl. As illustrated in Fig. 5a and b, the BP/BiOCl-12 sample shows the highest production rate of CO up to 260 μmol g−1 h−1 in 5 h. It should be emphasized that this recorded activity is 130 and 13 times higher than those of BP and BiOCl counterparts, respectively.
 Fig. 5  (a) CO production rate of BP, BiOCl, and BP/BiOCl catalysts with various ratios, (b) CO production rate of BP/BiOCl catalysts with various ratios, and (c) CO and CH4 production rate of the BP/BiOCl-12 catalyst under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation. (d) GC-MS spectra of 13C isotope labeling products. 
Moreover, this activity is comparable to those of the previously reported noble-metal-free solid catalysts under identical reaction conditions.35–42 As the amount of BP increases or decreases, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of BP/BiOCl decreases (Fig. 5a and b). In the BP/BiOCl catalyst, more BiOCl feed may lead to appreciable aggregation and weak nanoscale of the active component, while more BP additive can also result in a significant loss of active sites. Thus, the optimal value is the initial feed ratio of 1:2 for BP and BiOCl components in BP/BiOCl composites.
Besides the main product of CO, CH4 generation at different reaction times over the BP/BiOCl-12 catalyst was also measured, as demonstrated in Fig. 5c. Similar to the production of CO, the amount of CH4 generated increases with the reaction proceeding. Compared to CO generation, the production rate of CH4 is very low, which is only 22 μmol g−1 h−1 in 5 h. Interestingly, blank experiments of photocatalytic CO2 reduction without water, the BP/BiOCl catalyst, the CO2 substrate, and light irradiation displayed no conversion (Fig. S6, ESI†). Furthermore, the carbon source of CO/CH4 was verified by 13C isotope labeling experiments.10,32 As verified from the GC-MS data shown in Fig. 5d, the generation of 13CO (m/z = 29) and 13CH4 (m/z = 17) from 13CO2 confirms that the carbon sources of CO and CH4 are indeed derived from the CO2 substrate during the photocatalysis process. This is crucial for the proposal of a photocatalytic CO2 reduction mechanism. Moreover, the BP/BiOCl catalyst exhibits excellent photostability with at least five stable cycling times for continuous 20 h for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation (Fig. S7, ESI†). There is no significant change in the morphology, microstructure, and considerable BP–BiOCl synergy of the used BP/BiOCl (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†) relative to the fresh one, indicative of the robustness feature of BP/BiOCl in the solar to chemical energy conversion.
The Mott–Schottky test was performed to obtain valence band information for BP and BiOCl samples. As shown in the Mott–Schottky plots in Fig. 6a and b, the flat-band potentials of BP and BiOCl are −0.69 and −0.98 V, respectively.26,29 Moreover, the work functions of BP, BiOCl, and BP/BiOCl catalysts were determined using UPS spectra as 5.35, 7.58, and 6.00 eV, respectively (Fig. 6c and Fig. S10, ESI†). The electron transfer from the conduction band (CB) of BP to the valence band (VB) of BiOCl at the interface between both semiconductor contacts in the BP/BiOCl composite can result in the formation of an S-scheme heterojunction. Based on the analysis above, considering the band alignments of BP and BiOCl, a possible S-scheme mechanism involving efficient charge transfer during photocatalytic CO2 reduction on the BP/BiOCl catalyst was proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 6d. According to the UV-Vis-NIR spectra (Fig. 3a) and Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 6a and b), the VB and CB of BP and BiOCl are 0.9 and −0.69 eV, and 2.32 and −0.98 eV, respectively. Under the irradiation of ultraviolet or visible light, the BP and BiOCl components in the BP/BiOCl composite are excited by light after absorbing sufficient photon energy to produce photogenerated e−–h+ pairs (Fig. 6d). The electrons are excited from each VB to CB and participate in the catalytic reaction by activating small substrate molecules. The useless photogenerated electrons in the CB of BP can effectively migrate to the VB of BiOCl through interface contact and combine with the intrinsic useless holes.26,29,43–46 The increase in the number of electrons on the surface of BP/BiOCl composites can provide greater power and thus largely accelerate the efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4 requires electron transfer via the coupling of multiple protons. From a thermodynamic point of view, there are two reaction pathways including CO2 → CH4 (E0 = −0.24 eV, vs. NHE, pH = 0) and CO2 → CO (E0 = −0.53 eV, vs. NHE, pH = 0) (Fig. 6d).47,48 Therefore, the generation of CH4 is more conducive than CO production in theory during CO2 transformation. However, from a dynamic point of view, the BP/BiOCl composite nanocatalyst significantly boosts the reduction of CO2 to CO with a two-electron process compared to the reduction to CH4 with the eight-electron process (Fig. S11, ESI†) owing to the magic catalysis during photocatalytic CO2 transformation. And the two-electron process generally occurs more easily.49 The high-performance BP/BiOCl catalyst coupling with external reaction conditions effectively broke traditional thermodynamics limitations. The photogenerated electrons in the BP/BiOCl catalyst activate the adsorbed CO2 molecules to produce intermediate CO* (Fig. S11, ESI†). Then the CO* can be converted to CO and electrons. Finally, the generated CO molecules are desorbed from the surface of the BP/BiOCl catalyst.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully designed and developed black phosphorus nanosheet coupled bismuth oxychloride (BP/BiOCl) composite nanocatalysts showing a typical layered structure using a solvothermal reaction strategy. The BP/BiOCl catalyst exhibits enhanced wide-spectrum light absorption properties, excellent separation of e−–h+ pairs, and electron transfer for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO and CH4. The electron-rich P addition further improves the catalyst surface alkali property and adsorption ability for acidic CO2 substrates. The fabricated BP/BiOCl catalyst with substantial BP–BiOCl synergy shows a superior CO production rate of up to 260 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 130 and 13 times higher than those of BP and BiOCl counterparts, respectively. Meanwhile, this material also exhibits excellent photostability for CO2 transformation under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, the 13C isotope labeling experiments confirm that the carbon source of C-containing products is derived from the CO2 substrate during the photocatalysis process. The S-scheme mechanism involving excited electron transfer and direct participation in chemical activation of inert CO2 molecules, generation of key intermediate CO* and final gas products of photocatalytic CO2 reduction over the BP/BiOCl composite is proposed. The present findings offer effective photocatalytic CO2 reduction to valuable chemicals besides providing novel insights into surface-layered and acid–base-modulated Bi-based oxides for broader solar-to-chemical energy conversions.
