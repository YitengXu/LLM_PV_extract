, Accepted 19th June 2023First published on 21st June 2023AbstractThe rational design and fabrication of junction-based photocatalysts is of great importance to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of water splitting. Herein, a new heterophase junction photocatalyst consisting of cubic bixbyite and rhombohedral corundum In2O3 (c-In2O3 and h-In2O3) was readily prepared by directly annealing an InOOH precursor in an inert atmosphere. The resulting c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction photocatalyst showed an optimal hydrogen production rate of 0.73 mmol g−1 h−1 in a 6 h period reaction from alkaline formaldehyde solution in the presence of molecular oxygen under visible light irradiation, which was approximately 5.6 and 3.4 times higher than that of single-component c-In2O3 and h-In2O3, respectively. The superior photocatalytic activity of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction was partially attributed to its appropriate band gap and band positions. Spectroscopic characterization and photoelectrochemistry experiments indicated that the heterophase junction photocatalyst could effectively enhance charge separation and transfer abilities between h-In2O3 and c-In2O3. Furthermore, molecular O2 was found to play a key role in mediating the photocatalytic H2 evolution from formaldehyde oxidation as a catalytic electron scavenger, and O2 was not consumed throughout the reaction. Thus, the photocatalytic activity was also greatly enhanced because the adsorption ability of oxygen species was effectively improved after the formation of heterophase junctions.
1. Introduction
Artificial photosynthesis is considered as one of the most promising technologies to obtain clean and sustainable energy in the future society.1 Storage of solar energy in the form of chemical energy, especially H2, is proposed to be one of the most ideal approaches, since hydrogen is an excellent energy carrier due to its high specific enthalpy of combustion.2,3 Photocatalytic splitting of water into H2 has been extensively studied in the past decades. Among the factors affecting the photocatalytic performance, light absorption, charge separation, and reaction kinetics are the three determining factors, where charge separation usually plays the decisive role during photocatalysis.4–6
However, hydrogen production through direct photocatalytic decomposition of water requires overcoming large energy barriers.7 Therefore, sacrificial reagents are often added to the photocatalytic reaction process. Sacrificial reagents are basically small organic molecules containing hydrogen that are easily soluble in water, such as methanol, formaldehyde, etc. In previous studies on photocatalysis and thermal catalysis, we have found that both catalytic methanol and formaldehyde systems have oxygen mediated phenomena. In these reaction systems, the rate determining step is often the formation of reactive oxygen species by the photoactivation of molecular oxygen. On a suitable photocatalyst, this catalytic decomposition pathway of water can be driven by visible light under aerobic conditions, resulting in rapid hydrogen evolution kinetics. Molecular oxygen, after photocatalytic transformation to reactive oxygen species, serves as both an oxidant and a homogeneous catalyst in the photocatalytic cycle.
Meanwhile, to increase the charge separation efficiency, many strategies have been developed. Constructing Z-scheme heterojunctions is one of the most practical methods, since they not only improve the redox potential, but also promote the effective separation of charges.8–10 The heterophase junction in polymorph semiconductors was first proposed based on the considerably increased photocatalytic activities in anatase–rutile phase junction TiO2.11,12 The heterophase junction is more common in semiconductor-based photocatalytic conversion systems, since semiconductors always have several phase structures. Although the band positions of different phases are similar, the internal electrical field of the heterophase junction is sufficient to drive the photo-induced charge transfer between two phases, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity.13,14
As a typical photocatalyst with a bandgap of 2.8 eV,15 indium oxide (In2O3) has two types of polymorphs, cubic bixbyite (c-In2O3) and rhombohedral corundum (h-In2O3).16,17 Due to its adequate band positions and bandgaps, the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction photocatalyst shows huge potential in photocatalytic H2 production, CO2 reduction and oxidative hydroxylation,18–20 whereas its successful preparation is very challenging owing to the thermodynamically unstable properties of h-In2O3.
Herein, we synthesized a novel c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction photocatalyst by direct thermal decomposition of an InOOH precursor, which can facilitate the separation of charge carriers by a Z-scheme mechanism and further activate oxygen, leading to efficient photocatalytic decomposition of formaldehyde solution for hydrogen production. The hydrogen production rate of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction photocatalyst was 0.73 mmol g−1 h−1 in a 6 h period reaction, which was approximately 5.6 and 3.4 times higher than that of the single-component c-In2O3 and h-In2O3, respectively. The excellent catalytic performance of c/h-In2O3 originated from its suitable electronic band gap and band positions, effectively enhancing the charge separation and transfer between c-In2O3 and h-In2O3, thus promoting the activation of oxygen and improving its hydrogen production performance of photocatalytic formaldehyde reforming. We have revealed an efficient, oxygen-mediated Z-scheme photocatalytic reaction pathway using a novel heterophase junction photocatalyst that greatly improved the spatial separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. The formation of the heterophase junction enhanced the oxygen adsorption capacity of the photocatalyst, while the reaction triggered by the formation of reactive oxygen species from molecular oxygen allowed it to proceed through lower energy barriers, further improving the photocatalytic performance. This work opens up new pathways to efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production schemes and provides an innovative approach to the development of high-performance photocatalysts.
2. Experimental
Materials
All of the chemicals were used without further purification. InCl3·4H2O, ethylenediamine (EDA), N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine (TEEDA), NaOH, ethanol (C2H5OH), and formaldehyde (HCHO) were purchased from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Fabrication of c/h-In2O3
First, TEEDA (2.4 mL) was dissolved in 5 mL of water, InCl3·4H2O (1.095 g) was dissolved in 45 mL of ethylenediamine, and the two solutions were mixed and stirred for 10 minutes. The obtained mixture was transferred into a 100 ml autoclave and heated for 10 h at 180 °C in an oven. After cooling down naturally, the resulting white precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried at 60 °C overnight. The precursor was annealed in air at targeted temperature (500 °C) for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, and the resulting product c/h-In2O3 was obtained. Similarly, the products were obtained from the precursor at the calcination temperature (400 °C, 600 °C).
Characterization of c/h-In2O3
Thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the samples were performed with a DSC Q2000 V24.11 synchronous thermal analyzer from room temperature to 600 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The XRD patterns of the samples were measured on a diffractometer using Cu Kα irradiation (DX-2700) at a scan rate of 5° min−1 with a target voltage of 35 kV and a current of 35 mA. The Raman spectrum was tested using a confocal Raman spectrometer, Thermo Fisher Dxr2xi, excited by a He–Ne laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) (ZEISS Sigma 300, Germany) and a Tecnai G2 F20 (FEI) field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to obtain the morphology and microstructure at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The UV-vis-NIR solid diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu UV3600 spectrophotometer equipped with a 60 mm diameter integrating sphere, and barium sulfate was used as a reference for measurement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the surface composition of the product on an XPS apparatus (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, America), and all binding energies were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a FluoroMax-4 HORIBA fluorescence spectrometer (excitation wavelength = 310 nm). The capability of adsorbing oxygen was studied by O2-temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) using AutoChem1 II 2920 equipment equipped with a TCD. The samples were pretreated from room temperature to 300 °C at 10 °C min−1 for drying. Then the samples were previously treated under a pure He flow (30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h before cooling down to 50 °C under a He flow. 10% O2/He mixed gas (30 mL min−1) was passed over the samples for 1 h to saturation, and was switched to a He gas flow (30 mL min−1) to purge for 1 h to remove weakly physically adsorbed O2 on the surface. The desorption was performed from room temperature to 700 °C under a He flow (30 mL min−1) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The signal of O2 was detected using a TCD. X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals were recorded at ambient temperature on a Bruker EPR A-300 spectrometer. The spin trapping experiments were carried out by trapping the free radicals generated during the formaldehyde reforming using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) at room temperature, and then the EPR signals of the trapped free radicals were recorded. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp and a diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy accessory (DRIFTS). 5 mg of catalyst and 3 drops of reaction solution (containing 3 M formaldehyde and 5 M NaOH) were added to the reaction cell. The background spectrum was recorded after the addition of formaldehyde without light. Upon light irradiation, in situ DRIFTS spectra were recorded every 5 min (over 32 scans with a spectral resolution of 1.4 cm−1). All measurements were taken at room temperature under flowing oxygen gas.
Photo-electrochemical measurements
The photo-electrochemical properties were recorded with a three-electrode system using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660 E electrochemical workstation, China). The prepared samples (10% Nafion solution as the binder) coated on ITO sheet glass (1.0 × 1.0 cm2) were used as the working electrode. A platinum wire and saturated Ag/AgCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrolyte solution was 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution. A 300 W Xe lamp with a 420 nm cutoff filter was utilized as the visible light source. The photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) under visible-light irradiation were recorded at zero bias. Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis was performed at an alternating current potential frequency of 1000 Hz. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured on an optical bench equipped with a 300 W Xe lamp (Lot-Oriel), a monochromator. The photocurrent was measured without any external applied voltage (i.e. at zero bias) in the 320–420 nm wavelength range with a 2 nm step. The percent IPCE at each wavelength was calculated by employing the formula:IPCE = 1240 × Iλ/(Pλ × λ),where Iλ is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) measured with a digital multimeter at a specific incident wavelength λ (nm) and divided by the illuminated area of the film, and Pλ is the incident power density (mW cm−2) measured with a photodiode at the same λ.
Photocatalytic H2 evolution
The photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction was tested in a quartz tube reactor. Typically, 20 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in 5 mL aqueous solution (3 M HCHO and 5 M NaOH). Then the sealed reactor was irradiated under a 300 W Xe lamp (Beijing Electric Light Source Research Institute) and the temperature was maintained at 25 °C by cycling cooling water. At intervals of 1 h, 0.4 mL gas was taken out and analyzed using a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (GC-7900, 5A molecular sieve, TCD, China).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation and chemical structure of c/h-In2O3
The preparation procedure of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction photocatalyst is depicted in Fig. 1a. Firstly, the InOOH precursor was synthesized by a one-step solvothermal method using InCl3 (EDA) and TEEDA (aq) as the metal ion source and organic ligand, respectively. After pyrolysis treatment at different temperatures for 1 h in an N2 atmosphere, the In2O3 samples with different crystal structures were obtained. TG-DSC analysis was employed to investigate the thermal conversion process of InOOH to In2O3 (Fig. 1b). As shown in the TG curve, the initial weight loss below 238 °C was attributed to the loss of surface adsorbed molecules, such as water and the organic ligand.21 The total weight decreased sharply by a factor of about 6.1% between 238 and 440 °C, corresponding to the conversion of InOOH to In2O3, which was consistent with the strong exothermic peak at 313 °C of the DSC profile.22 The presence of another smaller exothermic peak at 456 °C suggested the phase transformation from rhombohedral corundum to cubic bixbyite.23 X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted to determine the crystal structures and phase purities of In2O3 at different calcination temperatures. The InOOH precursor had a single crystalline phase (PDF no. 71-2283)24 without other impurities (Fig. S1†). The In2O3 samples calcined at 400 °C and 600 °C matched well with the standard cards of h-In2O3 (PDF no. 22-0336)25 and c-In2O3 (PDF no. 06-0416),26 respectively, and possessed good crystallinity (Fig. 1c). The thermodynamic instability of the rhombohedral corundum structure led to the conversion of h-In2O3 to c-In2O3 when the annealing temperature was beyond the phase transformation temperature of 456 °C. Therefore, In2O3 calcined at 500 °C with mixed phase components composed of h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 was successfully obtained and named c/h-In2O3.

The initial structure and morphology of the In2O3 samples were revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 samples were spherical with uneven size, as depicted in Fig. S2.† The c/h-In2O3 sample showed a similar morphology, but with a relatively uniform particle size of ∼80 nm (Fig. 1d). In addition, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image showed that the c/h-In2O3 sample was composed of interconnected particles (Fig. S3†). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image confirmed the co-existence of two phases in the c/h-In2O3 sample (Fig. 1e), in which the lattice fringes of 0.27 nm and 0.29 nm correspond to the (110) crystal planes of h-In2O3 and the (222) crystal planes of c-In2O3, respectively.16,27 The interface between h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 could be clearly discerned, which was marked with red dashed lines, suggesting the presence of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction.
The Raman spectra were further used to verify the phase structure of c/h-In2O3 (Fig. 2a). The scattering peaks at 164, 219, 272, 385, and 591 cm−1 corresponded to the vibration peaks of h-In2O3.28 The irreducible representations for the optical modes in the crystal are 2A1g + 2A1u + 3A2g + 2A2u + 5Eg + 4Eu.29 The vibrations with symmetry A1g and Eg are Raman active and infrared inactive, while the A2u and Eu vibrations are infrared active and Raman inactive. The A1u and A2g vibrations are inactive in both. The vibration modes located at 112, 132, 308, 366, 496 and 629 cm−1 could be assigned to the vibration peaks of c-In2O3.30 For this crystal structure, the following vibration modes were predicted as: 4Ag + 4Eg + 14Tg + 5Au + 5Eu + 16Tu.31 The vibrations with symmetry Ag, Eg, and Tg are Raman active, while Tu is infrared active and Au and Eu are silent modes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the surface chemical states of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction. The XPS survey spectra of h-In2O3, c/h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 (Fig. 2b) showed the presence of In and O elements and adventitious C without other impurities. Fig. 2c and d compare the core level O 1s and In 3d spectra of the In2O3-X samples. The O 1s spectrum of In2O3 could be deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 529.64 and 531.42 eV, corresponding to the lattice oxygen (OL) and chemisorbed oxygen species (OC), respectively.32 Two characteristic binding energies at 444.21 and 451.75 eV could be assigned to the spin–orbit coupling of In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 for h-In2O3.33 Interestingly, the In 3d5/2, In 3d3/2, and OL peaks of c/h-In2O3 were slightly shifted toward higher values with respect to those of h-In2O3 and c-In2O3, which was possibly attributed to the alteration of the local chemical environment due to the electron interaction between c-In2O3 and h-In2O3, leading to the redistribution of the valence electron charges.34

3.2. Photocatalytic performance
To evaluate the effect of calcination temperature on the photoactivity of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction photocatalyst, the samples were tested for photocatalytic H2 evolution from 3 M formaldehyde aqueous solution under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation. Fig. 3a shows the temporal evolution of H2 gas from formaldehyde photooxidation under alkaline conditions on h-In2O3, c/h-In2O3 and c-In2O3. The c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction photocatalyst clearly showed superior photoactivities compared to the pure crystalline h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 photocatalysts. Amongst the In2O3 samples, c/h-In2O3 exhibited the optimal photocatalytic activity, generating 4.39 mmol g−1 H2 after 6 h of reaction, followed by h-In2O3 (1.28 mmol g−1) and c-In2O3 (0.78 mmol g−1). Furthermore, the as-synthesized c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction could serve as a good performance HER photocatalyst superior to recently reported heterophase junction catalysts in the absence of a cocatalyst or without optimizing the active specific surface area (Table S1†). The photocatalytic activity of c/h-In2O3 towards H2 evolution from formaldehyde (HCHO) was further probed by running control experiments, where any one of the three key components, viz. light, O2, and NaOH, was absent. Accordingly, negligible H2 was formed in the absence of either light (Fig. S4†) or formaldehyde (Fig. S5†), corroborating that H2 was produced from the photocatalytic activation of formaldehyde. By varying the HCHO concentration between 0 and 4 M, an optimum hydrogen production amount of 87.9 μmol over 6 h average was achieved in 3.0 M HCHO. Additionally, NaOH was also determined as an essential component for triggering the formaldehyde photodehydrogenation on 500IS-HOS. As shown in Fig. S6,† no H2 gas was detected in the absence of NaOH, whereas the maximum hydrogen production activity was measured at 5 M NaOH. It was probable that the OH− ions provided by NaOH accelerate the rate by facilitating the Cannizzaro reaction.35
 Fig. 3  (a) Photocatalytic H2 evolution activities of h-In2O3, c/h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 and (b) hydrogen production performance of c/h-In2O3 in 5 cycles. The photocatalytic reactions were conducted in an aqueous solution containing 3 M HCHO and 5 M NaOH at 0.21 O2 atm. (c) Time profiles of hydrogen production from a suspension containing c/h-In2O3 and an aqueous solution containing amounts of 3 M HCHO and 5 M NaOH under different pO2 and visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). (d) The temporal change of O2 partial pressure within 6 h of reaction with different initial O2 partial pressures (pO2). 
Consecutive photocatalytic H2 evolution experiments over the c/h-In2O3 sample were carried out (Fig. 3b). After five times repeated reaction cycles under the same conditions, the photocatalytic activities remained basically unchanged compared to the initial performance. The XRD pattern of the used c/h-In2O3 sample was consistent with the initial sample and no other characteristic peaks appeared (Fig. S7a†). Similarly, the SEM image of the used c/h-In2O3 sample showed no obvious changes compared to the fresh c/h-In2O3 sample (Fig. S7b†), proving that the c/h-In2O3 sample not only possessed excellent activity, but also had favorable stability. Interestingly, the presence of O2 was also found crucial to the reaction. Fig. 3c shows the impact of the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) on the H2 evolution amount using c/h-In2O3 as the photocatalyst. Remarkably, the H2 evolution rate enhanced as the pO2 increased from 0.02 to 0.98 atm. The high concentration of pO2 had no effect on the catalyst, and the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction still maintained favorable stability. The pO2 was also monitored throughout the 6 h reaction, as shown in Fig. 3d. It could be seen that pO2 remained almost constant in all experiments, suggesting the lack of net-consumption or production of O2 by the reaction, despite its role as a rate promoter, i.e., a catalyst, similar to the findings in our previous work on the non-photocatalytic36 and photocatalytic37 reforming of formaldehyde.
3.3. Characterization of optical and electronic properties
The charge separation and transfer properties of the IS-HOS samples were probed using a range of characterization techniques, including steady-state PL, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy, photoelectrochemical photocurrent response (PC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). As shown in Fig. 4a, In2O3 exhibited a broad PL emission band with several peaks located in the range of 420–500 nm. For the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction, the PL intensities were greatly quenched, indicating improved charge recombination abatement in the heterostructures compared to the single-component h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 photocatalysts.38 Overall, the extent of PL quenching followed the order c/h-In2O3 > h-In2O3 > c-In2O3, which correlated well to the photocatalytic activities of the samples. The trends of PL quenching and photoactivity signified that the photocatalytic performance of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction relied on its superior charge separation ability, which was further corroborated by the TRPL results shown in Fig. 4b.39,40 While the charge carrier lifetimes in single-component h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 photocatalysts were determined to be 0.815 and 0.712 ns, respectively, the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction showed a significantly longer carrier lifetime, in particular, c/h-In2O3 showed the longest average carrier lifetime of 1.534 ns.
 Fig. 4  (a) PL spectra, (b) TRPL spectra, (c) PC response, and (d) EIS Nyquist plots of h-In2O3, c/h-In2O3 and c-In2O3. 
The PC measurements were implemented with several 30 s light on/off cycles using visible light (λ > 420 nm), as shown in Fig. 4c. As the photogenerated electrons must diffuse from the bulk of the photocatalyst to the photocatalyst/ITO substrate to be transferred to the counter electrode, the photocurrent magnitude is indicative of the charge transfer efficiency of the photocatalyst.41 An unambiguous photocurrent enhancement was shown by the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction in comparison to the single-component h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 photocatalysts, which aligned well to the performance trend of the In2O3 samples for the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction. The results of the IPCE spectroscopy of the In2O3 samples are shown in Fig. S8.† The IPCE of the c/h-In2O3 peak position is approximately 367 nm, and the maximum conversion in the peak position is 11.3%. The c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction had significant PEC efficiency. A high concentration of charge carriers enables an increase in the peak intensity of the IPCE. This meant that the carrier content generated in the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction was significantly better than that of pure crystalline In2O3, and was consistent with its hydrogen production performance. The Nyquist plot measurements (Fig. 4d) verified that the extent of photocurrent enhancement displayed by the In2O3 samples could be correlated to the reduced charge transfer resistance in the materials. Typically, the smaller arc radius of the Nyquist plot represents the lower charge transfer resistance.42 Indeed, the EIS Nyquist plot of c/h-In2O3 showed the smallest arc radius among all the samples; the semicircular diameters of the samples followed the order c/h-In2O3 < h-In2O3 < c-In2O3, which was consistent with the results of the PC measurements. The above results revealed that the construction of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction was beneficial to enhance the utilization of photoexcited e− and h+, thereby enhancing the efficiency of photocatalytic H2 evolution.
3.4. Photocatalytic mechanism
UV-vis and Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out to investigate the band structures of h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 to confirm the charge transfer mechanism of the heterophase junction, as shown in Fig. 5. Based on the UV-vis spectra and Tauc plots shown in Fig. 5a and b, the optical absorption ranges of the In2O3 samples under visible light were basically similar, and the optical absorption intensities were also the same. The bandgap energies were determined to be 2.95 eV and 2.98 eV for h-In2O3 and c-In2O3, respectively. The positive slopes displayed by all the samples indicated that they are n-type semiconductors43 (Fig. 5c). The flat-band potentials of h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 were estimated to be −0.92 and −1.53 V vs. NHE (pH = 0), respectively. The formation of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junctions in c/h-In2O3 could be attested by its flat-band potential which lies between those of h-In2O3 and c-In2O3. Given that the flat-band potential of n-type semiconductors is generally ∼0.1 V below the conduction band,44 the conduction band minimum (CBM) values of h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 were therefore estimated to be −1.02 and −1.63 V vs. NHE (pH = 0), respectively. Accordingly, the valence band maximum (VBM) values of h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 were evaluated to be 1.93 and 1.35 V vs. NHE (pH = 0). Meanwhile, we validated the valence band values (VB) of the samples by the XPS valence band, as shown in Fig. S9,† and the VB values of h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 were 1.94 and 1.31 V, respectively. The VB results are close to the above calculated VBM potentials. The band alignment between h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 was then constructed. As depicted in Fig. 5d, the band structure of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction had staggered gaps and conformed to a type-II or Z-scheme heterojunction. For the type-II heterojunction photocatalyst, it could promote the spatial separation of electron–hole pairs, but its redox ability will be also reduced. However, the Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst could not only promote the spatial separation of electron–hole pairs, but also heighten its redox ability. That is to say, this staggered structure of energy levels would promote the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers in the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction and inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus achieving the goal of improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate. We will continue to discuss which type of heterojunction structure the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction belongs to in the following text.

(c) M–S plots of h-In2O3, c/h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 vs. NHE at pH = 0. (d) Band structure of photocatalytic H2 evolution over the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction. 
We found that the formation of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction energy levels further enhanced its adsorption capacity for oxygen species, which was significant for the photocatalytic oxidation of formaldehyde for the hydrogen production process. The oxygen also slightly promoted the hydrogen production performance of pure crystalline In2O3. We compared the effect of oxygen partial pressure on the hydrogen production performance of the three In2O3 photocatalysts within 6 h, as shown in Fig. 6a, corresponding to a linear relationship. The two-stage curve of c/h-In2O3 showed that the promoting effect of oxygen on c/h-In2O3 was not a single linear relationship. When the oxygen partial pressure concentration was <0.2 atm, the promoting effect on the hydrogen production performance was stronger, and when the oxygen partial pressure concentration was >0.2 atm, the promoting effect was relatively decreased. Moreover, the slope of c/h-In2O3 was significantly greater than that of h-In2O3 and c-In2O3, indicating that when heterophase junctions were formed, the catalyst was more sensitive to the mediation effect of oxygen, and the hydrogen production promotion effect of oxygen on the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction was significantly better than that on h-In2O3 and c-In2O3. In order to additionally explore the influence of oxygen on the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction hydrogen production performance, we tested O2-TPD and EPR on the In2O3 samples. O2-TPD in Fig. 6b was used to measure the oxygen adsorption and desorption capacity on the catalyst surface. The desorption peaks of oxygen at different temperatures were assigned to the physically adsorbed oxygen (Osurf) around 100 °C, the surface chemically adsorbed oxygen (O2− and O−) between 100 and 350 °C, the surface lattice oxygen (Olatt2−) in the range of 350–500 °C, and the bulk Olatt2− higher than 500 °C.45,46 c/h-In2O3 had obvious peaks at 180 °C and 423 °C, while h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 had no obvious peaks, which proved that the surface oxygen adsorption capacity of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction was better than that of In2O3 with two pure crystal structures. Fig. 6c shows the formation of free radical species as reaction intermediates during the photocatalytic reaction with the different In2O3 samples. c/h-In2O3 produced significantly stronger signals of DMPO–O2˙− and DMPO–˙H than h-In2O3 and c-In2O3, suggesting that the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction could produce enough O2˙− and ˙H free radicals to promote the catalytic reaction.47,48 In Fig. 6d, without light, signals of DMPO–O2˙− and DMPO–˙H could not be observed in the presence of c/h-In2O3. As a function of light irradiation time, the DMPO–O2˙− and DMPO–˙H signals gradually intensified and became stable, signifying that O2˙− and ˙H free radicals could be generated continuously and stably in the photocatalysis reaction system with the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction, and these free radicals have been proved to be important starting substances involved in the reaction. The higher content of free radicals led to the higher hydrogen production performance.

We used in situ DRIFTS to identify the intermediates formed in the photocatalytic HCHO oxidation process catalyzed by c/h-In2O3 to study the solution reaction mechanism in the photocatalytic process. The time-resolved DRIFTS measurements were initiated upon visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7a, the two bands at 3665 and 3020 cm−1 were attributed to the inherent tensile vibrations of free OH− and –OH (–COOH), respectively.49 In the alkaline solution, carbonate ions (CO32−) contributed to the vibration band located at 1540 cm−1.50 The evolution of the vibration band at 2370 cm−1 was associated with CO stretching of the formate group (–COOH), and the band at 2010 cm−1 corresponded to the formate group (–COOH).51 The peak intensities of OH− declined gradually, and those of –COOH and CO32− increased gradually over reaction time, suggesting their roles as reaction intermediates in the HCHO photooxidation. With the intermediate species identified by the in situ DRIFTS and spin-trapping EPR experiments, we proposed the concise reaction mechanism: HCHO → HCOO− → CO32−; this was basically consistent with the reaction mechanism of our previous photocatalytic formaldehyde system.

We conducted a probe reaction of in situ photoreduction deposition of Pt to prove the charge separation path at the heterophase junction region and verify the type of heterophase junction formed. As shown in Fig. S10a and b,† we could clearly observe that Pt nanoparticles were deposited on spherical In2O3 particles. HRTEM showed that the lattice spacing of 0.23 nm and 0.29 nm corresponds to the (111) crystal plane of Pt (ref. 52) and the (222) crystal plane of c-In2O3, respectively, indicating that Pt was deposited on c-In2O3. The Fermi level of Pt was much lower than that of the cubic and rhombohedral corundum junction formed at the interface, resulting in the photogenerated electrons being more preferably accumulated on the Pt clusters but not on the In2O3 nanoparticles.53 The Pt clusters will collect the photogenerated electrons of c-In2O3 nanoparticles and their surroundings. These results evidently demonstrated that the photogenerated electrons were separated into c-In2O3 nanoparticles, and the derived holes were separated into the h-In2O3 surface. To better understand how the charge separation takes places between different phases of the same semiconductor, a plausible mechanism was then proposed (Fig. 7b). Considering the absence of a redox ion or electron mediator, the charge transfer mode in the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction was proposed to proceed via the direct Z-scheme mechanism and not the type-II mechanism.54 Under the excitation of visible light, the VB electrons of h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 undergo transitions, resulting in the formation of a positively charged VB and a negatively charged CB. Between c-In2O3 and h-In2O3, the e− in the CB of the h-In2O3 combined with the h+ in the VB of the c-In2O3, leaving only the h+ in the VB of the h-In2O3 and the e− in the CB of the c-In2O3. The reserved e− in the CB of c-In2O3 (−1.63 eV) was strong enough to reduce H+ to H2 and O2 to O2˙−, while O2˙− could further promote the evolution of hydrogen from water. The h+ in the VB of h-In2O3 will be consumed by HCHO, thereby achieving efficient charge separation, which contributed to the efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution from HCHO solution. These above results demonstrate the prominent advantage of the new heterophase junction strategy to boost the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction has been demonstrated to efficiently catalyze an aqueous formaldehyde solution to produce hydrogen under visible light, where oxygen plays a catalytic role. The resulting heterophase junction could enhance the charge separation and transfer at the h-In2O3 and c-In2O3 interface, contributing to the superior photoactivity of the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction compared to the single-phase In2O3. Furthermore, the in situ-grown c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction strengthened the ability to adsorb and activate oxygen, which played a key role in catalyzing the aqueous phase reforming of formaldehyde to generate hydrogen via a single-electron reduction process, further enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. Experimental and characterization results indicated that the photocatalytic oxidation of formaldehyde was carried out in the absence of an electron mediator, and the charge transfer mechanism within the c/h-In2O3 heterophase junction could be characterized as a direct Z-scheme. This work paves the way for the efficient production of solar H2 fuel from a liquid organic hydrogen carrier by heterophase junction catalysts under visible light and ambient conditions.
