    , Accepted 30th July 2015First published on 30th July 2015AbstractFossil fuel alternatives, such as solar energy, are moving to the forefront in a variety of research fields. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) hold promise for their potential to be used as low-cost and efficient solar energy converters. PSCs have been commonly made from bicontinuous polymer:fullerene composites or so-called bulk heterojunctions. The conjugated polymer donors and the fullerene derivative acceptors are the key materials for high performance PSCs. In the present study, we have performed density functional theory calculations to investigate the electronic structures and magnetic properties of several representative C60 fullerene derivatives, seeking ways to improve their efficiency as acceptors of photovoltaic devices. In our survey, we have successfully correlated the LUMO energy level as well as chemical hardness, hyper-hardness, nucleus-independent chemical shift, and static dipole polarizability of PC60BM-like fullerene derivative acceptors with the experimental open circuit voltage of the photovoltaic device based on the P3HT:fullerene blend. The obtained structure–property correlations allow finding the best fullerene acceptor match for the P3HT donor. For this purpose, four new fullerene derivatives are proposed and the output parameters for the corresponding P3HT-based devices are predicted. It is found that the proposed fullerene derivatives exhibit better photovoltaic properties than the traditional PC60BM acceptor. The present study opens the way for manipulating fullerene derivatives and developing promising acceptors for solar cell applications.
1. Introduction
The development of clean and renewable energy is vital to meet the ever-increasing global energy demands arising from rapid economic expansion and increasing world population, while minimizing fossil-fuel depletion, pollution and global warming.1 Accordingly, new technologies for energy conversion e.g. solar cells and fuel cells are under intensive research.2 Solar cells are ideal alternatives to the traditional energy sources such as coal and oil. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn broad attention since their first report in 19953–5 because of their advantages of easy fabrication, low cost, light weight and the possibility of fabricating flexible devices in comparison with traditional inorganic semiconductor photovoltaics.6 Combining an electron-deficient compound (acceptor) and an electron-rich conjugated polymer (donor) leads to the formation of film which contains high donor–acceptor interfacial areas. When the film is placed between appropriate electrodes it demonstrates the photovoltaic effect and the resulting valuable device is identified as the BHJ solar cell.3,7 When light irradiates on the PSCs, the semiconducting donor and acceptor materials in the photoactive layer absorb photons to form excitons (bounded electron–hole pairs), then the excitons diffuse to the donor/acceptor interfaces where they dissociate into electrons at the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor and holes at the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor. The dissociated electrons and holes then move to and are collected by negative and positive electrodes, respectively, to realize the photon-to-electron conversion.6
In recent years, efforts for developing and optimizing materials used in PSCs have increased8,9 and various materials have been designed and synthesized in order to achieve high performance PSCs.10,11 In this way, the electron acceptors are of the same importance as the electron donors for increasing the efficiency of PSCs. However the research efforts devoted to the acceptors are much less than those to the polymer donors. Among various acceptor substances, fullerenes with inherent high electron affinity and being able to transport charges effectively have been introduced as intriguing acceptors for BHJ solar cells.7 Recently significant research efforts have already been put into developing large-area technologies for polymer:fullerene BHJ solar cells with record power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 6%.11–14 Different combinations of donor and acceptor materials have been used to make the active layer of polymer:fullerene BHJ solar cells. One of the most efficient BHJ devices is a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron donor and a soluble C60 derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM), as an electron acceptor that showed a PCE of up to 5.5% for single layer devices.15 To further improve the PCE, the design and synthesis of new fullerene acceptors have been the priority of many research surveys.7,15–20 Although some n-type conjugated polymers with stronger visible absorption have been applied as acceptors in the PSCs,21–25 the fullerene derivatives PC60BM still dominate the acceptors in the PSCs for their high efficiency.6
The overall efficiency of a solar cell is expressed as26 (1)where VOC is the open circuit voltage (voltage for I = 0), ISC is the short circuit current (current for V = 0), FF is the fill factor (FF), and Pin is the incident light power. This equation shows that the PCE of a solar cell is directly proportional to ISC and VOC. In a polymer:fullerene solar cell, merely a little improvement of the ISC value is possible since the highest reachable value of ISC is very close to its maximum feasible value27 while there are still several considerable paths for improving VOC. It is also well known that the VOC of the PSCs is proportional to the difference between the HOMO of the electron donor and the LUMO of the electron acceptor.7,27 Moreover, there is a crucial threshold value in the energy gap of the donor LUMO and the acceptor LUMO of about 0.5 eV for an efficient charge transfer from the donor polymer to the acceptor fullerene.28 So, the VOC can be increased by preserving this donor–acceptor LUMO–LUMO gap and increasing the LUMO level of the electron acceptor molecule revealing that it is necessary to find the appropriate acceptor for each donor polymer.7 Therefore, the LUMO energy level of the fullerene derivatives is a key parameter for the application as an acceptor to match a polymer donor.6 Recently, new fullerene derivatives with up-shifted LUMO energy levels were developed and the PSCs based on P3HT as a donor and the new fullerene derivatives as an acceptor show higher VOC and improved PSC efficiency.7,18,29,30
In view of recent research progress on the new fullerene derivative acceptors, in the present study, we set out to understand the effect of different substitutions on the acceptor strength of these materials. We have employed various quantum chemical properties belonging to different categories to establish several correlation relationships for the prediction of VOC of fullerene based PSCs. Accordingly, some efficient descriptors such as LUMO energy, chemical hardness, and hyper-hardness are considered for the reproduction of experimental VOC. Moreover, owing to the important role of static dipole polarizability in governing various physical and chemical phenomena, the relationship between this quantity and experimental VOC is also checked. On the other hand, the unique physical and chemical properties of fullerenes are due to the existence of an extended π-electron system. For this reason, the study of aromaticity of fullerene derivatives can elucidate various aspects regarding their structure and reactivity. Accordingly, we also investigate the magnetic properties of the interior space of fullerene derivatives by computing the nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS).31–33 This quantity not only measures electron delocalization inside the cage but also is relevant to the reactivity of fullerene derivatives based on its connection with chemical hardness. However, the obtained structure–property relationships enable us to foresee the VOC of polymer:fullerene solar cells once we know their electronic and magnetic properties of the corresponding acceptors. Thus, in the final part of the present study, we propose several new fullerene-based acceptors which have the desired properties for increasing the efficiency of PSCs.
2. Computational details
Modern density functional theory (DFT) provides a valuable tool for calculating a variety of molecular properties and electronic structures. Nonetheless, the accuracy of density functional methods depends upon the applied exchange–correlation (XC) functionals. In this study, four density functional methods belonging to different categories of DFT methods have been tested. In particular, one functional of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type, PBE,34 one meta-GGA functional, TPSS,35 and two hybrid-GGA functionals, B3LYP as well as HSE,36 have been assessed against the experimental LUMO energy (εLUMO) and HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Eg) of PC60BM. All calculations were performed by using the 6-31G(d) basis set with the help of GAUSSIAN09 suite of programs.37 In Fig. 1, we compared the density of states (DOSs) of the PC60BM calculated by HSE, PBE, TPSS and B3LYP methods. The figure demonstrates diverse predictive ability of the tested functionals. The numerical values of the calculated εLUMO and Eg of PC60BM as well as the corresponding experimental data38,39 are given in the table below Fig. 1. While the PBE and TPSS functionals underestimate the band gap by about 30–40%, the two hybrid functionals (B3LYP and HSE) give better estimations of εLUMO and Eg. In particular HSE remarkably outperforms other functionals and its results for εLUMO and Eg are in better agreement with the experimental values. This outcome is well supported by previous investigations where the hybrid functionals have been suggested as efficient methods for band gap calculations.40,41 In fact hybrid functionals improve the predicted band gaps by combining the overestimation of band gaps from Hartree–Fock with the underestimation from GGA.41 On the other hand, the selection of a suitable basis set is another important task which should be carried out with care in order to advance safely to the prediction of reliable properties. Therefore, to verify the compatibility of the 6-31G(d) basis set, we have also examined a larger 6-31 + G(d,p) basis set for computing various properties of PC60BM. A comparison between the results of two basis sets, given in Table S1 of the ESI,† indicates that there is no significant difference between the magnitudes of various properties. Accordingly, we rely on the 6-31G(d) basis set as a good compromise between performance and computational cost. In fact, our main focus is on the trends that are obtained for the different properties due to change in the fullerene structure. A larger basis set may change the quantitative value of the calculated properties but do not change the trends in the data. However, all quantum chemical calculations of this study have been carried out using the HSE functional together with the 6-31G(d) basis set. After geometry optimization and solving vibrational modes (to prove that all the stationary points are minima of the potential energy surfaces) all electronic and magnetic properties are calculated at this level of theory.

3. Results and discussion
3. 1. Structural, Electronic, and magnetic properties of the fullerene derivative

3. 1. 1 Molecular structure. 
In a comprehensive paper, He and Li6 reviewed the synthesis and physicochemical properties for a number of fullerene derivative acceptors. From those fullerene derivatives, we have selected several structures based on the VOC of the corresponding solar cells. In order to gain more insight into the molecular structures of the studied fullerene derivatives, a brief summary will be given below. Nonetheless, we refer the readers to the original reference for more details.6
The fullerene derivatives have been achieved by replacing pristine C60 fullerene with its highly soluble derivative PC60BM which was synthesized by Hummelen et al. for the first time.42 Herein, we consider PC60BM as the reference structure and other derivatives can be designed by altering the two aromatic and aliphatic substitutions attached to it. The aliphatic tail in PC60BM is butyric acid methyl ester (–CH2CH2CH2COOR, R = CH3) which can be altered with the intention of attaining a reasonable solubility in organic solvents. The structure of PC60BM and its derivatives are given in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† Yang et al. synthesized two PC60BM derivatives, 2 and 3, by adding an alkoxyl substituent on the phenyl ring and changing the methyl end group with a hydrogen atom in 3.19 Troshin et al. synthesized a series of fullerene derivatives, labeled 4–14 in Fig. S1 (ESI†), and studied the relationship between the structures of the C60 derivatives and their photovoltaic properties.43 In comparison with the side chain of PC60BM, the side chain structural changes of the derivatives are as follows: the butyl middle chain was changed to a propyl chain in 4–8 while 7 has a different end group, the methyl end group was changed to an ethyl group in 9, the phenyl ring was changed to a thienylene and furan rings with methyl and ethyl groups in 10 and 11, respectively. The phenyl ring was changed to a thienylene ring and the butyl middle chain was changed to a propyl chain in 12–14. Li et al. also synthesized several derivatives, 15–18, by changing the butyl middle chain in the side chain of PC60BM to propyl, pentyl, hexyl and heptyl chains for investigating the effect of the alkyl middle chain length on the photovoltaic properties of the C60 derivatives.17 Moreover, Zhang et al.44 synthesized two fullerene derivatives, 19 and 20, by replacing the phenylene ring in the side chain of PC60BM with a bulky triphenylamine and 9,9-dimethylfluorene, respectively. Another PC60BM-like molecule, 21, has been synthesized by inserting a nitrogen bridge between the side chain and C60 in PC60BM.45,46 Also, Drees et al.47 synthesized a PC60BM-like derivative, 22, by changing the methyl end group with a cycloethanone ring. Finally, a series of the fullerene derivatives 23–25 have been synthesized to increase the VOC of the PSCs.14,15
Fig. S1 (ESI†) also includes the experimental values of VOC for the PSCs based on these fullerene derivatives as acceptors and P3HT as a donor. Aiming to investigate the relationship between structure and performance, we consider PC60BM with VOC = 600 mV as the reference structure (F1) and 8 other fullerene derivatives that have VOC > 600 mV (F2–F9). The optimized structures of considered fullerene derivatives are presented in Fig. 2 (the F1 to F9 labeling is in accordance with increasing VOC values). All correlation equations reported in this work are developed between the calculated electronic/magnetic properties of these nine fullerenes and the corresponding experimental VOC values of the P3HT-based solar cells.

3. 1. 2 LUMO levels. 
Previous studies have shown that there is a linear relationship between the energy difference of the donor-HOMO and the acceptor-LUMO and the VOC of the polymer:fullerene solar cell, within certain limits.48–51 Thus, a linear relationship is expected between the LUMO energies of the acceptors and the corresponding VOC of the polymer:fullerene solar cells for a given polymer donor.29 The calculated εLUMO for F1–F9 compounds varies from −3.50 to −3.22 eV while the VOC changes from 600 to 810 mV (Table 1). We have presented the correlation between LUMO energy levels of F1–F9 fullerene derivatives and the experimental VOC of the corresponding P3HT-based devices in Fig. 3. A remarkable linear correlation with a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.973) is observed which implies that increasing the LUMO level of the fullerene acceptor results a higher VOC in the polymer:fullerene solar cell device. In agreement with previous reports,7,28 herein, the linear correlation between the experimental VOC and the calculated εLUMO is confirmed for diverse PC60BM based derivatives. Minor deviations from linearity may be referred to the fact that the LUMO energies are calculated for isolated molecules in the gas phase while the VOC values are measured in solid-state devices.

3. 1. 3 Chemical hardness and hyper-hardness. 
Chemical hardness is a useful concept for understanding and predicting the chemical behavior of different compounds. Hardness is defined as the second derivative of energy with respect to the number of electrons, (2)and can be used to characterize the relative stability of a system. The next derivative, called the hyper-hardness, measures the change in hardness associated with a variation in the electron number. (3)Several ways have already been explored to get the working equation for hyper-hardness.52 Morell et al. have shown that hyper-hardness is the difference between the left and the right N-derivative of hardness:53 (4)Obviously, hyper-hardness gives a comparison between the variation of ionization potential and electron affinity when the number of electrons changes. (5)Morell et al.53 explained the chemical relevance of γ such that the first term in eqn (4) describes how the electron affinity changes when the number of electrons evolve, therefore, is an indicator of the ability of the system to acquire an electron. The lower the first term, the better electrophile the system. In contrast, the second term is an indicator of how easily the system loses an electron. The higher the second term, the better nucleophile the system. One can easily see the tendency of both terms to act in the opposite directions so the value of hyper-hardness is quite difficult to interpret. The only possible interpretation is therefore that large negative values of γ indicate that a system is prone to react either as an electrophile or as a nucleophile. In contrast, low values of γ can arise when the system is neither a good electrophile (large values of the first term) nor a good nucleophile (low values of the second term).
For calculating hyper-hardness, we have employed the way developed by Fuentealba and Parr.54 They computed hardness as well as hyper-hardness from the electron affinity (A), and the first and second ionization potentials (I1 and I2), assuming that the energy varies with the number of electrons according to the relation (6)in which the coefficients a, b and c are related to A, I1 and I2 through (7a) (7b) (7c)Then hardness and hyper-hardness can be obtained by η = 2 × (b − ac);(8) γ = −3 × [c(b − ac)];(9)Here, we have calculated the hardness and hyper-hardness for the F1–F9 fullerene derivatives by using eqn (8) and (9) and the corresponding values are reported in Table 1. Inspection of the computed η and γ values elucidates that there can be correlations between experimental VOC and these descriptors. The correlation diagrams as well as correlation equations are presented in Fig. 4. It is obvious that the correlations of VOC with η and γ are not as good as what we found for VOCversus εLUMO, which may be due to the approximations used for computing hardness and hyper-hardness. However, these two quantities can be employed to explore the chemical stability and electrophilic character of the studied fullerenes. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the harder fullerene derivatives show higher VOC implying that more stable fullerene structures exhibit better performance as acceptors in a solar cell. Moreover, the linear correlation in Fig. 4(b) indicates that the more negative the γ the higher the VOC. On the other hand, it is known that fullerene derivatives that have more electrophilic character are better acceptors in PSCs leading to higher efficiency.7 In this respect, the negative values of hyper-hardness are interpreted as the electrophilicity behavior of the fullerene derivatives. As evident from Table 1, the bisadduct (F7 and F8) and trisadduct (F9) derivatives with VOC greater than 700 mV have the largest negative values of γ indicating their greater electrophilic character. Therefore, the electrophilicity of fullerene derivatives increases upon enhancing the adduct numbers.

3. 1. 4 The static dipole polarizability. 
Static dipole polarizability is another important property which defines many physical and chemical processes such as intermolecular interactions, optical properties, chemical reactions, and many others.41 Thus, investigating the polarizability of fullerenes and their derivatives is highly informative for designing novel materials with advanced properties. In a recent review article, Sabirov55 covered experimental and main theoretical studies in the field of polarizability of fullerenes and their derivatives from 1990s to 2014.
Polarizability is a molecular property that describes the ability of molecules to acquire induced dipole moment in external electric fields. When a molecule is set in a uniform electric field (F), its energy is expressed as power series of the electric field. The expansion coefficients allow the computations of the dipole moments, linear, and non-linear polarizabilities. The components of the polarizability tensor have been calculated in terms of the finite field approach as the second order derivatives of the total energy E with respect to the homogenous external electric field F: (10)The values αxx, αyy, and αzz are interpreted as main semi-axes of the polarizability ellipsoid of the molecule. They are also used for the calculation of mean polarizability (11)The reported mean polarizability values in Table 1 indicate that, in general, fullerenes are highly polarizable molecules. The calculated mean polarizability values of the studied fullerene derivatives are in the range of 91.3–135.3 Å3 which are in the same order of experimental measurement of mean polarizability for C60 (80–89 Å3).56,57 On the basis of the correlation between dipole polarizability and HOMO–LUMO energy gap which has been demonstrated in previous studies,58,59 we have used the calculated mean polarizabilities for developing structure–property relationships with the key output parameter of the solar cell (VOC). As shown in Fig. 5, the trendline has a correlation coefficient R of 0.914, which indicates good linear dependence. Accordingly, the fullerene derivatives with higher mean polarizability are better candidates to be the acceptor of PSCs.

3. 1. 5 NICS characterization. 
The study of aromaticity of fullerenes and their precursors provides valuable insight into their structure and reactivity. Aromaticity is defined as the ability of a compound to sustain an induced ring current, which causes extra stabilization/destabilization in the case of aromatic/antiaromatic compounds. Probably, the most widely employed methods among several ones to evaluate aromaticity are based on magnetic properties.60 The NICS index as a simple and efficient aromaticity probe is proposed by Chen et al.32,33 and corresponds to the negative of the magnetic shielding computed at the geometric center of a ring system. The negative NICS value in interior positions of the molecules (magnetically shielded) signifies the presence of induced diatropic ring currents or aromaticity, while the positive value at each point (magnetically deshielded) is a proof of paratropic ring currents or antiaromaticity.33,60
In order to evaluate the magnetic field due to electron mobility inside the fullerene derivatives, we have calculated isotropic NICS, NICSIso, at the geometric center of considered fullerenes (F1–F9). As evident from Table 1, monoadduct derivatives (F1–F6) have almost similar NICSIso values while the bis and trisadducts (F7–F9) exhibit larger NICSIso indicating greater electron mobility inside these cages. The enhancement in the aromatic character of F7–F9 derivatives is in line with their greater chemical hardness, that is, the stability of these derivatives is supported by both electronic and magnetic evidences. Moreover, existence of a correlation between magnetic-based indices of aromaticity and reactivity-based criteria provides an opportunity to consider NICSIso values as another descriptor for estimating VOC. The variation of NICSIso values for our objective fullerene derivatives versus the experimentally determined VOC is illustrated in Fig. 6. A linear relationship with a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.933) indicates the reliability of the NICSIso index for the prediction of VOC. We have also checked the correlation between NICSIso as a local magnetic index and εLUMO as a global electronic descriptor for the studied fullerene derivatives. The remarkable correlation (R = 0.971) shown in Fig. 7 infers that the shift at the LUMO level to higher energies and consequently the enhancement in the efficiency of the fullerene based PSCs can be predicted by isotropic magnetic shielding inside the fullerene cage.

3. 2 Designing new fullerene-based acceptors for the P3HT:fullerene solar cell
The final section of the present article is devoted to design fullerene derivatives with superior performance as acceptors of a P3HT:fullerene solar cell. In fact, the results of this work with the aid of previous findings enable us to propose new fullerene structures and to foresee the output parameters for the PSCs made with these fullerenes as acceptors and P3HT as a donor. Traditionally, the attention of such studies is directed to the use of frontier orbitals. Levels of frontier orbitals provide a good orienteer to screen the HOMO and LUMO levels of a candidate fullerene acceptor in a highly automated manner.61 Herein, we focus our attention on several descriptors derived not only from frontier orbitals but also from electric response properties. Moreover, the use of magnetic properties for the estimation of VOC is also investigated. It should be noted that the VOC of polymer:fullerene solar cells depends on several factors such as the position of the LUMO level of the acceptor, the injection barriers, the ideality factor, the recombination, the mobility and the morphology of the blend.62 For this reason, we restricted our search to the structures with the molecular dimension close to the fullerene derivatives studied in the present work (F1–F9). First we refer to the points that are taken into account for designing new fullerene acceptors. (i) Altering the aliphatic chain length as well as changing the alkoxyl substituent on the aliphatic tile affect the LUMO level of fullerene derivatives. (ii) Replacement of fullerene monoadducts by bis- and trisadducts of C60 enhances the acceptor efficiency. (iii) Attaching the heteroatoms to the external surface of fullerenes (exohedral doping) increases the LUMO level. In this context, Akasaka and co-workers have reported the synthesis of stable fullerene silirane derivatives.63 Moreover, quantum chemical calculations show that fullerene silirane derivatives with increased LUMO levels are useful to increase the VOC of a PSC.64
Considering F1, F4, F6 and F7 as the parent structures and utilizing the above points, we suggest four new fullerene derivatives as presented in Fig. 8. P1 is designed on the basis of the reduction of the aliphatic chain in F1 and increasing the number of adducts to three. The two proposed P4 and P6 derivatives have similar structures to F4 and F6 unless the attached atom to the C60 cage is silicon instead of carbon. The last structure, P7, is suggested so that doping with the silicon atom is accompanied by increasing the number of adducts to three. However, for all the proposed fullerene derivatives, the geometry optimization were performed at the same level of theory as the F1–F9 derivatives, that is HSE/6-31g(d). The calculated properties including εLUMO, hardness, hyper-hardness, mean polarizability, and NICSIso for proposed fullerenes are collected in Table 2. Compared to the primary building block (PC60BM), the LUMO levels of the proposed fullerenes increase by about 0.10–0.33 eV. To verify the effect of silicon doping and trisadduct on the electronic structure of C60, the DOS plots of proposed fullerene derivatives are presented in Fig. 9. To make the comparison easier, the DOSs of the corresponding parent structures are also included. The plots show that the LUMO levels of the new fullerene derivatives shift toward higher energies when they are compared with their parent structures. The amounts of up-shift in LUMO levels are about 0.27, 0.06, 0.04 and 0.20 eV, respectively, for P1, P4, P6, and P7. Table 2 reveals that other considered properties such as mean dipole polarizability and NICSIso vary in a consistent fashion with LUMO energy. In P1 and P7 structures, the maximum up-shifts in εLUMO are accompanied by maximum mean polarizability and larger NICSIso values. We have used these properties for predicting the VOC of constructed P3HT-based PSCs. Table 3 collects the VOC values obtained from the correlation equations with εLUMO, α, and NICSIso. Moreover, the amount of increase in VOC with respect to the parent structures is also included in this table. Obviously, increases up to 200 mV are predicted for VOC of the devices fabricated with these model fullerenes. Although the predicted VOC obtained by various descriptors have different values, similar trends are observed for the VOC variation from P1 to P7. The results demonstrate that in comparison to the presence of heteroatoms, the increasing in the number of adducts has more impact on the overall photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. Among four model fullerenes, the structures P1 and P7 are suggested as the most promising acceptors for application in the P3HT:fullerene solar cell.

Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the other two quantities, chemical hardness and hyper-hardness, fail to predict the correct trend for VOC of the proposed fullerene derivatives. This may be due to the approximations used for estimating these quantities. In fact, there is no way to obtain correct analytical derivatives of energy with respect to the number of electrons. Hence, both η and γ are estimated by approximate approaches which are mainly based on electron affinity and ionization potentials. On the other hand, no experimental measurements of electron affinity and ionization potentials are available. Thus, as demonstrated by the poor correlations between VOC and η or γ (Fig. 4), chemical hardness and hyper-hardness are not appropriate descriptors for the prediction of the VOC of polymer:fullerene solar cells. In contrast, the LUMO energy level, mean dipole polarizability, and NICSIso are found to be reliable properties for predicting the acceptor strength of the deigned fullerene acceptors.
4. Conclusion and perspectives
Improving the efficiency of fullerene-based organic solar cells is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field between the photovoltaics and fullerene materials science. The present study assesses the feasibility of theoretical prediction of the open circuit voltage for a PSC based on the quantum chemical properties of its fullerene acceptor. For this purpose, we first investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of nine fullerene derivatives already used in the fabrication of P3HT:fullerene solar cells. We have developed several structure–property relationships based on the correlations between VOC with εLUMO, α, η, γ, and NICSIso. According to the correlations found, the most efficient fullerene-based acceptors are characterized by the highest LUMO energy level, maximum hardness, maximum dipole polarizability, and a larger magnetic field inside the cage. Despite the fact that the discussed data are mainly computational, they well correlate with the known photovoltaic performance of fullerene derivatives. However, these correlations give us the opportunity to search for new fullerene derivatives and increase the efficiency of P3HT-based solar cells. Accordingly, in the second part of the present work we proposed four new fullerene derivatives and predicted the output parameters for the corresponding P3HT-based photovoltaic devices. The results demonstrate that increasing the number of adducts in the fullerene structure is most influential factor on the overall photovoltaic performance of the PSCs. Compared to PC60BM, the proposed fullerenes increase the VOC of P3HT-based PSC by about 40%. Important finding to be emphasized is that the predicted VOC by the use of different descriptors exhibit similar trends. It is worth mentioning that we have performed our calculations in the vacuum in order to find a simple approach for the theoretical prediction of VOC of a solar cell. Due to the slight dependence of the considered properties on the solvent effect,65 we expect that the obtained correlations can also be applicable in the presence of solvent. However, this idea is in its infancy and further efforts such as simulating the real media by considering the solvent model can improve the results. Indeed, the present study might serve as a modest spur to induce extensive efforts in this field. We hope that our investigations on fullerene derivatives will be useful for further theoretical and especially experimental studies dealing with applications.
