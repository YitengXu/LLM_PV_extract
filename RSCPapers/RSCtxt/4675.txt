    , Accepted 22nd September 2017First published on 22nd September 2017AbstractCarbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into more valuable chemicals has attracted great research interest in recent years. Compared to homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts are advantageous due to their recyclability and the easy separation of products from catalysts. Research has proved that photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis are able to reduce CO2 to produce a variety of organic compounds such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, methane, etc., which could not only possibly be used to reduce its accumulation in the atmosphere, but could also produce renewable hydrocarbon fuels. In these processes, catalysts play a significant role in the surface reactions, i.e. to decrease kinetic barriers and to increase activities. Although several review articles related to CO2 reduction have already been published in 2009–2014, due to booming studies in the field of materials, heterogeneously catalysed CO2 reduction has sprung up in recent decades. Therefore, it is important to provide a critical review of the recent progress in catalyst exploration for CO2 reduction, while also providing a framework for research prospects and guiding future research directions in laboratories or in industry. Herein, we review the encouraging research accomplishments achieved in the materials field in recent decades, in terms of structure engineering, cocatalyst development and hybrid catalyst system construction for CO2 reduction via photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, with a summary of future research directions in the materials field.Guixia ZhaoDr. Guixia Zhao received her BS degree from Lanzhou University in 2009 and her Ph.D. from the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Prof. Xiangke Wang, in 2014.

1. Introduction
With continually increasing energy demand, it is assumed that the worldwide energy consumption per hour in 2050 will reach 1.1 × 1021 J, more than 80% of which will be obtained from natural fossil resources.1 Such increased demand will be impossible to satisfy by present limited natural resources. An accompanying crisis is the large quantity of CO2 released from fossil consumption, which causes global warming and environmental instability.2 It has long been a scientific dream to convert CO2 into useful fuels, since this would be like killing two birds with one stone in terms of solving both the energy and environmental crises. Since CO2 is a stable molecule (ΔG° = −400 kJ mol−1) with two linear-configured double bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms, its conversion into value-added chemicals without a catalyst or input energy is not possible. Generally in present research, there are three main approaches to solving this magnificent challenge, i.e. photocatalytic CO2 reduction (so-called artificial photosynthesis), electro-reduction of CO2 and photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction.
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction has been paid consistent attention for many years with the ideal concept of utilizing solar energy and mimicking the overall natural photosynthetic cycle. This approach is considered to advance under relatively mild conditions, i.e. at room temperature and pressure without extra artificial energy input.3 The main process is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Once excited by absorbing a flux of photons with energy higher than the band gap of the semiconductor, electrons are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), with an equal number of holes generated in the CB. Such electron–hole pairs separate from each other and are transported to the semiconductor surface (trapped by the cocatalyst if possible) for the surface catalytic redox reaction, i.e. the reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels such as CO, CH3OH and CH4, and the oxidation of a sacrificial agent or H2O. Fig. 1b shows the band structure of some semiconductors with respect to the redox potentials of various CO2 reduction products at pH 7. For the photogenerated electrons to be used for CO2 reduction, the corresponding redox potential level is thermodynamically required to be below the CB position of the semiconductor. Due to the sluggish reduction kinetics, most research on photocatalytic CO2 reduction still focuses on the half reaction with a sacrificial agent as an electron donor, with relatively few studies on the overall reaction where water is used as an electron donor to form O2. Although much materials research has been focused on boosting activities in terms of engineering the structures of the semiconductor and cocatalyst, and constructing the integral assembly for the light harvester, the charge carrier transfer path and the catalytic sites, challenges still remain, such as the low production evolution rate in μmol h−1, and even lower performance when using H2O as an electron donor.4 It is necessary to provide a critical review and summary of present research on photocatalytic CO2 reduction with the aim of facilitating research and development in this area.

Compared to photocatalytic CO2 reduction, electrochemical catalysis has several advantages: (i) the process can be controlled by adjusting the potentials and reaction temperature; (ii) the chemical consumption can be minimized to water since the electrolytes can be recycled; (iii) the electrochemical reaction setup is compact, modular and easy to scale up. However, in the present state of research, obtaining high energy efficiency and selective production is also challenging due to slow kinetics, even when a high electronic potential is applied. Generally, electronic CO2 reduction includes two-, six-, and eight-electron reduction pathways in aqueous and non-aqueous phases with different standard electrode potentials, forming CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4, as shown schematically in Fig. 1b. The inside kinetics is low and the mechanism is complicated. In addition, the products are usually not pure species but mixed components. Catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction are longstanding targets because they would significantly affect the detailed reduction path, which may enable direct, efficient electrolytic fuel synthesis powered by a renewable source of electricity.5 Thus electrocatalyst exploration is of critical importance to the development of electrochemical CO2 reduction.6 In recent decades, sustained efforts have been devoted to the research and development of electrocatalysts for efficient and selective CO2 electroreduction. Herein, the progress of recent research on electrocatalysts for CO2 electroreduction will be comprehensively reviewed in an important section.
Photoelectrocatalysis is considered as an integration of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, where on one hand, the applied potential facilitates the separation of photo-induced carriers in the photocatalytic process, and on the other hand, extra light irradiation reduces the overpotential in the electronic process. Photocathodes composed of semiconductor are used not only as catalysts, but also for light harvesting. Generally, cocatalysts, especially metal complex catalysts, are coupled with semiconductors to form hybrid systems to improve selectivity and efficiency. In fact, the conversion of solar energy and electricity to chemical energy is complicated because multiple products can be formed at the cathode and anode. In the third part, we describe the remarkable recent progress in catalyst exploration toward efficient and selective CO2 reduction via photoelectrochemical catalysis. We focus on rational catalyst design and structure engineering, with the aim of gaining a fundamental understanding of the processes and shedding a light into the chemical utilization of CO2.
2. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
In the photocatalytic process, the surface redox reaction for CO2 activation likely includes one-electron transfer from the excited photocatalyst to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CO2 to form a CO2˙− species, which is unfavorable thermodynamically due to the large energy gap (13.7 eV) between the LUMO and HOMO (highest unoccupied molecular orbital), as well as the large electron affinity of CO2 (−0.6 ± 0.2 eV) that leads to a very negative redox potential, i.e. CO2 + e− → CO2˙− (E0redox = −1.90 eV vs. NHE).7,8 Photocatalysis has been considered as a facile method for activating and converting CO2 into useful chemicals, where the adsorption of CO2 onto the photocatalyst surface is the best way to lower its energy barrier, since a bent form of CO2 shows high reactivity based on the fact that the LUMO level of CO2 decreases as the molecule bends. The sequential chemical reactions are initiated by one-electron transfer to form the surface-bound CO2˙− on the photocatalyst. Depending on the number and potential of the charge carriers taking part in the chemical reaction, the operating conditions, and the type of reductant,8 the following multiple electron and proton steps determine the various products, e.g. CO is formed by two protons and two electrons; CH4 is formed by eight protons and eight electrons with different redox potentials, as shown in Fig. 1b, from which the feasibility of the semiconductor for CO2 reduction can be predicted thermodynamically. To boost the efficiency and selectivity, on one hand, semiconductors with a wide optical absorption region and appropriate CB edges are prerequisites; on the other hand, the multi-electron transfer pathway is complex and surface-attached cocatalysts play an important role in controlling the various surface pathways and the CO2 reduction selectivity, as well as suppressing electron–hole recombination. In this section, semiconductor engineering and cocatalyst construction in recent studies will be reviewed and discussed.
2.1. Semiconductor engineering
As indicated in Fig. 1, semiconductors with a CB level more negative than −0.61 eV vs. NHE can be used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Up to now, the semiconductor materials explored for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 include metal oxides, nitrides, and metal sulfides. Metal oxides containing d0 elements (Ti4+, Ta5+, V5+, Zr4+, Nb5+, Mo6+)9–14 and d10 elements (Ge4+, In3+, Ga3+),15–17, d10 metal nitride solid solutions,18–20 and some sulfides, like CdS, ZnS, MnS, Cu2ZnSnS4 (ref. 21–23), have been found to be active. These semiconductors are thermodynamically favorable for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, but many such bulk materials show quite low activities. Large efforts have been devoted to the structure engineering of semiconductor materials via bandgap adjustment, macro/meso/microporous/nano-structuralization, surface oxygen vacancy/defect engineering and control of the exposed crystal facets. The bandgap adjustment is to adjust the bandgap and CB/VB positions to enlarge the light-absorption region and further improve the photoconversion efficiency of CO2 reduction, which is mainly obtained by cation or anion doping, solid solution formation, hetero-structuralization, sensitization and Z-scheme construction. Meso/microporous/nano-structuralization is aimed at fabricating semiconductors with high surface areas, abundant surface states, readily accessible channels and enhanced CO2 affinity. Surface vacancy engineering is usually to control the surface vacancies, which are considered as the most reactive sites for CO2 reduction; while efforts to control the exposed crystal facets of semiconductors are based on the fact that crystal facet adjustment affects the electronic band structures, surface active sites, reactant adsorption and production desorption, and further determines the photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction.

2.1.1 Cation or anion doping. 
Since the VB potential of metal oxides is located at about 3 eV vs. NHE, considering that the CB potential for CO2 reduction needs to be lower than −0.6 eV vs. NHE, the bandgap of active metal oxides should be larger than 3.6 eV, which means that only UV light can be utilized. Doping N and C to replace O in the metal oxides efficiently raises the VB positions and narrows the bandgaps, leading to a visible-light response for using more photons. N-doped TiO2,24,25 I-doped TiO226 and N-doped InTaO427 have been reported to enhance CO2 photoreduction activities. Cations like Ag,28 Cu,29,30 Ce31 and Ni32 are also doped into metal oxides to create impurity energy levels within the bandgap. It was concluded that the electron–hole separation and charge carrier transfer are significantly influenced, as previously reviewed by Asahi et al.33 and Tu et al.3 Wang et al. reported ordered mesoporous cobalt-doped TiO2 synthesized by a multicomponent self-assembly process. The doped Co species change the construction of the CB and VB of TiO2, resulting in a visible-light response for TiO2 and a higher visible light activity for the reduction of CO2 among the commonly reported photocatalysts. In addition, the selectivity of the reduction products is improved by optimizing the energy-band configurations of Co-doped TiO2 through varying the molar ratio of Co/Ti. When the doping content of the cobalt species is increased to some extent, Co3O4 and oxygen vacancies can form on the surface of Co-doped TiO2 nanocomposites, which markedly improves the generation rate of CH4.34 As a newly emerging non-metal semiconductor, carbon nitride (C3N4) has been extensively investigated.35,36 For example, sulfur-doped C3N4 was fabricated by calcinating thiourea at 520 °C, which was found to absorb light up to 470 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 2.63 eV, lower than that of bulk C3N4 (2.7 eV).37 Theoretical calculations indicated that the bandgap of the doped sample was the same as that of the bulk material, but an impurity state existed in the resultant doped sample, which led to the possible jumping of photogenerated electrons from the impurity state to the CB or from the VB to the impurity state. Evaluation of photocatalytic CO2 reduction showed that the CH3OH yield of S-doped C3N4 was 2.5-fold that of undoped C3N4.37 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarified the mechanism of the experimentally-observed upward shift in the CB edge and VB edge of N-doped Ta2O5.38 This indicated that N-doping induces defects of oxygenated species, such as oxygen atoms and surface hydroxyl groups, in Ta2O5, and further induces charge redistribution to generate excess negative charge near the doped nitrogen atoms and excess positive charge near the defect sites. When the concentration of doped nitrogen atoms at the surface is not high enough to compensate for the positive charges induced at the surface defects, the remaining positive charges are compensated for by the nitrogen atoms in the inner layers. Thus the dipole moments normal to the surface generated in this situation raise the CB and VB of Ta2O5.


2.1.2 Solid solution formation. 
Solid solutions have proved to exhibit enhanced performance compared with single components due to orbital repulsion and subsequent bandgap narrowing. For instance, introducing Zn2GeO4 into ZnGa2O4 to form a zinc gallogermanate solid solution can effectively narrow the bandgap, since incorporating the s and p orbitals of Ge enhances the p–d (O 2p–Zn 3d) repulsion effect, and subsequently induces an upshift of the VB edge. In addition, the introduced low-energy s orbital of Ge induces a downshift of the CB edge. The resulting zinc gallogermanate solid solution has improved hole mobility and an enhanced water oxidation ability due to the light-hole effective mass, thus high activity in converting CO2 and H2O into CH4 and O2 was obtained.16 Sheaf-like hyperbranched Zn2GeO4 nanoarchitectures have been successfully synthesized in a binary ethylenediamine/water solvent system via a solvothermal route. Nitridation of the Zn2GeO4 nanoarchitectures resulted in yellow Zn1.7GeN1.8O with a bandgap of 2.6 eV, which exhibited the highest activity for CO2 reduction with an apparent quantum yield of 0.024% at 420 nm when loaded with 1 wt% Pt and 1 wt% RuO2.19 The sufide solid solution CuxAgxInzZnkS, with a bandgap lower than 2 eV, also showed high photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 into CH3OH under visible light with RuO2 or Rh1.32Cr0.66O3 as a cocatalyst, as reported by Liu et al.22


2.1.3 Hetero-structuralization. 
Heterostructures usually consist of two or more semiconductors with diverse band energy structures and well-controlled interface interactions for electron/hole transfer.40 In type II heterostructures, the photo-generated electrons in the higher CB of one semiconductor are transferred to the lower CB of the other semiconductor, while holes are transferred from the lower VB to the higher VB. TiO2/ZnO,41 rutile TiO2 nanoparticles/anatase TiO2 nanorods,42,43 TiO2/C3N4,44 Bi2S3/CdS,45 Cu2O/SiC,46 CuxO/TiO2,39 carbon quantum dots/Cu2O,47 and nanosized carbon nitride/MOFs48 have been investigated as efficient heterostructures for CO2 reduction.49 For example, via annealing of Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites mixed with a TiO2 precursor (TiCl4), a mesoporous p-type/n-type heterojunction material, Cu2O–CuO–TiO2 was synthesized. Due to the augmented light absorption, effective charge separation and mesoporosity, a remarkable methane yield of 221.63 ppm g−1 h−1 was achieved even when no metal cocatalyst was used (Fig. 2).39

In Zou’s group, a visible light-responsive C3N4/NaNbO3 nanowire heterojunction photocatalyst was developed via introducing amorphous C3N4 on NaNbO3 nanowires, which showed an 8-fold higher CO2 reduction activity compared with individual C3N4 under visible light. HR-TEM revealed that an intimate interface was formed between C3N4 and the NaNbO3 nanowires. It was supposed that the improved separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs from the well-aligned overlapping band structures of C3N4 and NaNbO3 at the intimate interface contributed to the significantly enhanced performance.50 Also with C3N4, a UiO-66 MOF/C3N4 nanosheet heterostructured photocatalyst was fabricated via a self-assembly method. It was demonstrated that electrons from the photoexcited C3N4 nanosheet can be transferred to UiO-66, substantially suppressing electron–hole pair recombination and providing long-lived electrons for CO2 reduction.48 A recent report by Pan et al. showed that In2O3 nanobelts coated with a 5 nm-thick carbon layer can trigger the highly enhanced photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4, with CO and CH4 evolution rates of 126.6 and 27.9 μmol h−1, respectively. The thin carbon layer induces the excitation of electrons from the O 2p band of In2O3 to the carbon band within an electric double layer at the interface between the carbon layer and In2O3, resulting in an increased absorption of sunlight and a sharply decreased electron–hole recombination rate. The thin carbon layer also increases CO2 chemisorption on the catalyst to allow longer time for capture of the protons from water splitting. In addition, H2 evolution on the catalyst via reduction of the protons from water splitting is suppressed. In summary, the increased absorption to sunlight, decreased electron–hole recombination rate, improved chemisorption of CO2, and increased proton participation in CO2 reduction are responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4 over the carbon-coated In2O3 nanobelts.51


2.1.4 Sensitization. 
It has been considered as an efficient strategy to realize the reduction of CO2 through sensitizing wide-bandgap semiconductors with narrow-bandgap semiconductors or dye molecules, with the aim of photogenerated electrons from narrow-bandgap semiconductors or dye molecules transferring to the CB of wide-bandgap semiconductors. Various narrow-bandgap semiconductors such as PbS,52 AgBr,53 CdSe quantum dots,54 Bi2S3 and 55 CdS55 have been utilized to couple with wide-bandgap semiconductors like TiO2 for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light. It is found that the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 at frequencies ranging from the violet to the orange-red edge of the electromagnetic spectrum is size-dependent. PbS quantum dot-sensitized TiO2 showed a 5-fold enhanced photoreduction rate compared with unsensitized TiO2.52 Recently, halide perovskite quantum dots were used as light harvesters and composited with graphene oxide to form a (CsPbBr3 QD/GO) composite, which exhibited an efficient photogenerated electron consumption rate of 29.8 μmol g−1 h−1 and selectivity of more than 99% for CO2 reduction over water reduction.56 However, the quantum dot sensitizer underwent deactivation after prolonged photoexcitation. More stable sensitizers need to be explored. More studies on using dye molecules and other molecule complexes to sensitize wide-bandgap semiconductors for visible light-induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction will be reviewed in this article.


2.1.5 Z-scheme construction. 
“Z-scheme” comes from mimicking natural photosynthesis in green plants for CO2 conversion into carbohydrates with photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) in a “Z” shape. Specifically, the Z-scheme system is composed of two different semiconductors with reversible redox mediators or conductive solid mediators, as shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Schematic illustration of charge separation and transfer in a Z-scheme system with two semiconductors mimicking PSI and PSII in natural photosynthesis. Reprinted with permission from ref. 57. 
Unlike with type II heterostructures, in the Z-scheme system, the double half redox reactions can occur on different semiconductors, which significantly enlarges the electron–hole separation and suppresses the back reaction. As a typical example, a Z-scheme system consisting of metal sulfides, CoOx-loaded BiVO4 and reduced graphene oxide as an electron mediator was irradiated with visible light in an atmosphere of CO2 and detected CO as a product, although the yield was quite low.58 Bi2WO6 and CdS were constructed in a Z-scheme system with Au as a mediator for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane in the presence of water vapor. The photo-generated electrons from the CB of Bi2WO6 are transferred to Au, then recombined with the holes from CdS, which allows the electrons remaining in the CB of CdS to possess strong reduction powers for CO2 reduction and simultaneously allows the holes in the VB of Bi2WO6 to possess strong oxidation powers, leading to a high activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The depressed hole density on CdS also improved the stability of CdS against photocorrosion.59 Direct Z-scheme systems composed of two heterostructured semiconductors without a mediator were also constructed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, such as CdS–WO3 (ref. 60) and α-Fe2O3–Cu2O61 heterostructures under visible light irradiation. Specifically, the CdS–WO3 heterostructure exhibits a CH4 production rate of 1.02 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 100 times and 10 times as high as that of single-phase WO3 and CdS, respectively;60 the α-Fe2O3–Cu2O heterojunction also showed a CO yield of 1.7 μmol h−1 g−1 in the presence of water vapor.61 In Yang’s group, a Z-scheme system comprising an inorganic–biological hybrid and molecular redox shuttles was constructed. The bacterium Moorella thermoacetica self-photosensitized with CdS nanoparticles to produce acetic acid from CO2 by the oxidation of the thiol amino acid cysteine (Cys) to cystine (CySS). On the other side, TiO2 loaded with a Mn(II) phthalocyanine (MnPc) cocatalyst functioned as a photooxidative catalyst for water oxidation and CySS reduction to regenerate Cys.62


2.1.6 Meso/microporous/nano-structuralization. 
To enhance the available surface areas and reaction sites, micro-/mesoporous photocatalysts for CO2 reduction can be classified into two groups: (i) photocatalysts dispersed in micro-/mesoporous supports such as zeolites,63 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)64,65 or mesoporous silica;31,66,67 (ii) pure mesoporous/microporous semiconductors, such as Zn2GeO4,68 In(OH)3,15 ZnGaO4,69 Bi2WO6,70 ZnGaNO,20,71 and ZnGeNO.18 Micro/mesoporous silica has proved to be an advanced support for loading photocatalyst active sites via condensation of the reactants within the hydrophobic cavities and the following efficient diffusion of the reactants onto the photocatalyst active sites. Thus the adsorption of CO2 onto such supported photocatalysts is largely improved, which is a prerequisite for efficient CO2 reduction. For example, Ti–SBA-15 showed a 20-fold increase of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 and CH3OH in the presence of H2O under UV light irradiation.72 Recently, in Frei’s group, an all-inorganic polynuclear unit composed of a bridged binuclear ZrOCoII group coupled with an iridium oxide nanocluster (IrOx) was assembled on an SBA-15 silica surface. Illumination of the ZrOCoII–IrOx units in the SBA-15 pores in the presence of 13CO2 and H2O vapor resulted in the formation of 13CO and O2.73 Other similar oxo-bridged heterobinuclear units of the Zr(IV)OCo(II) type covalently anchored on the pore surface of mesoporous silica SBA-15 exhibit a visible light response due to metal-to-metal charge-transfer absorption, resulting in the reduction of CO2 to gas phase CO and HCOO− in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor (triethyl- or diethylamine).67
As reported by Liu et al., hierarchical amine-functionalized titanate nanosheet-based yolk@shell microspheres were prepared via one-pot organic amine-mediated anhydrous alcoholysis of titanium(IV) butoxide. The crystallographic, morphological and textural control of the synthesized titanate nanoarchitectures and the in situ functionalization of the titanate nanosheets by concurrent interlayer intercalation and surface grafting resulted in a strong visible-light absorption ability and high CO2 adsorption capacity, which contributed to efficient CO2 reduction toward solar fuels.74 Typical cuprous oxide mesoporous nanorods coated with carbon layers were fabricated and exhibited remarkably improved stability and decent activity for CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.07% for CH4 and C2H4 at 400 nm.75 It is inferred that the thin carbon layer not only works as a protective layer to suppress the photocorrosion of Cu2O, but also endows the sample with a mesoporous and one-dimensional nanorod structure, facilitating reactant molecule adsorption and charge carrier transfer.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of metal ions or small discrete clusters through the linkage of multidentate organic molecules have recently been developed as porous photocatalysts. The highly exposed reaction sites on MOFs and the large surface area ensure enhanced interactions between the substrates and CO2 molecules, further inducing a generally improved performance compared with most other semiconductors.76 Wang et al. reported a series of earth-abundant Fe-containing MOFs, i.e. MIL-101(Fe), MIL-53(Fe) and MIL-88B(Fe), which showed photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to produce formate under visible light due to the excitation of the Fe–O clusters. It was also demonstrated that amine-functionalized Fe-containing MOFs showed improved photocatalytic activity compared with unfunctionalized MOFs due to the existence of dual excitation pathways: excitation of the NH2 functionality followed by an electron transfer to the Fe center beside the direct excitation of Fe–O clusters.77 Formic acid formation was also observed over interpenetrated Ru–MOFs78 and Mn-incorporated MOFs.79
Nano-structuralization is a conventional strategy for improving photocatalytic activities through minimizing grain boundaries/defects to suppress electron–hole recombination and providing direct pathway for charge transport since the photogenerated charges have a much higher probability of reaching the interface without recombination as a consequence of the short distances to the surface.80 Nanostructured semiconductors such as TiO2,81–84 Fe2V4O13,85 Na2V6O16,86 and Zn2GeO487,88 have shown superior performance for CO2 reduction. For example, uniform hierarchical microspheres scaffolded from ultrathin ZnGa2O4 nanosheets with over 99% exposed facets were prepared through an easy solvothermal route, as shown in Fig. 4. Remarkable CO2 photocatalytic performance (with a CH4 production rate of 7 ppm h−1) was obtained due to the high surface area of the nanosheets and high crystallinity. Further research indicated that the photo-excited carriers on the nanosheets can survive longer, which also contributes to the high photocatalytic activity of the ZnGa2O4 nanosheets.89

2.1.7 Surface vacancy engineering. 
Studies have proved the important role of the surface vacancy sites of semiconductors in CO2 activation, especially oxygen vacancies.90–92 CO2 molecules are inclined to adsorb at oxygen vacancy sites with one oxygen atom of the CO2 located at the bridged oxygen vacancy defect,7,93 which may lower the reaction barrier for CO2 reduction. For example, oxygen vacancy-rich ultrathin W18O49 showed remarkably enhanced CO2 adsorption due to the “trapping” effect of oxygen vacancies. These consumed oxygen vacancies in the photocatalyst can be recovered by the reducing power of NaBH4.91 First principles calculations have been utilized to investigate the photocatalytic reduction of CO2via two possible pathways, i.e. the fast-hydrogenation (FH) path and the fast-deoxygenation (FdO) path over the perfect and defective anatase TiO2(101) surface. It was found that in the FH path, oxygen vacancies on the defective surface can greatly lower the barrier of the deoxygenation processes and reduction can proceed at both the surface Ti sites and the oxygen vacancy sites; while for the FdO path, CO2 reduction can proceed neither on the perfect surface nor on the defective surface.94
In recent studies, other kinds of vacancy also proved to be efficient for CO2 reduction because of the induced extra defect level in the energy band structure. Gao et al. recently successfully synthesized freestanding gram-scale single-unit-cell o-BiVO4 layers with distinct vanadium vacancy concentrations for the first time. Theoretical calculations revealed that the vanadium vacancies induced a new defect level and higher hole concentration near the Fermi level, and further increased the photoabsorption and superior electronic conductivity. This resulted in a high methanol formation rate of up to 398.3 μmol g−1 h−1, and a prolonged carrier lifetime of 143.6 ns indicated higher carrier separation efficiency inside the o-BiVO4 layers with rich vanadium vacancies.95 Similar defective one-unit-cell ZnIn2S4 atomic layers were prepared and proved the existence of zinc vacancies. The one-unit-cell ZnIn2S4 layers with rich zinc vacancy exhibited a CO production rate of 33.2 μmol g−1 h−1, 3.6-fold as high as that of the one-unit-cell ZnIn2S4 layers with poor zinc vacancy, which is considered to originate from the promoted carrier separation rate in the zinc vacancy-rich ZnIn2S4.96 DFT calculations reveal that the presence of zinc vacancies induces increased charge density and enhanced carrier transport, as verified by the ultrafast photogenerated electron transfer time of ∼15 ps from the conduction band of ZnIn2S4 to the trap states (Fig. 5). In addition, the larger number of zinc vacancies also ensures increased photoabsorption, higher CO2 adsorption capacity and stronger surface hydrophilicity.

2.1.8 Exposed crystal facet engineering. 
It has been found that different surface structures have various affinities for CO2 and different abilities for CO2 activation due to different metal/O surface ratios and various reductive properties/CO2 affinities.97,98 For example, single crystalline anatase TiO2 rods with dominant reactive (010) facets exhibit superior CO2 photocatalytic reduction to CH4 and theoretical predictions also indicated a stronger CO2 interaction of CO2 on the (010) facet than on the (101) and (001) facets.99,100 Similar results were also found from research on ZnGa2O4 and Zn2GeO4 with specified crystal facets.101,102
However, as reported by Yu et al., a series of anatase TiO2 with different ratios of the exposed (101) and (001) facets were fabricated. Experimental results and theoretical analysis showed that for the sample with a high percentage of (101) facets, most of the photogenerated electrons and holes were mainly accumulated on the (101) facets, thus the charges could easily recombine; while for the sample with an optimal percentage of exposed (001) and (101) facets, the electron and hole pairs could efficiently migrate to the (101) and (001) facets, respectively, which significantly suppressed the electron–hole separation.103 Therefore, to optimize the CO2 reduction activity, comprehensive considerations need to be taken.

2.2. Cocatalyst engineering
Achievement of efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction is not only dependent on the semiconductor engineering, but is also largely related to the attached cocatalyst on the surface, due to the nearly inert chemical character of the linear CO2 molecules. The deposited cocatalyst usually facilitates the photocatalytic CO2 reduction via two pathways: (i) trapping the photogenerated electron/hole to promote the electron–hole pair separation and to prolong the lifetime of the charge carriers; (ii) lowering the reaction energy barrier for CO2 reduction via an ingenious reaction process, which either facilitates CO2 activation or provides an active intermediate for the reduction process. Due to the significant importance of the cocatalyst for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the exploitation of highly active cocatalysts has attracted intensive research in the past decade. The most widely used cocatalysts in laboratory research include noble metals such as Pt, Au, Pd, Ru, Ir, and Ag.22,51,104–107 Due to the high cost and low abundance of precious metals, inexpensive and efficient cocatalysts have been explored as alternative catalytic sites. In this section, different kinds of cocatalyst such as precious metals, single atoms, transitional metal oxides, and molecular complexes for photocatalytic CO2 reduction will be reviewed and discussed.

2.2.1 Noble metal-based catalysts. 
Noble metals such as Pt, Ag and Au on TiO2 have proved effective for the conversion of CO2 to valuable hydrocarbons.4,108–111 Umezawa et al. investigated the role of Pt co-catalysts through studying the chemisorption energies of HCOO and OH on TiO2(110) with/without a Pt cluster. It was found that free electrons provided by the Pt cluster dramatically decrease the chemical energy due to the electron transfer from high-lying Pt states to unoccupied valence states induced by the adsorbates, which facilitates the ionization of HCOO− and OH− on the TiO2 surface near the Pt cluster and subsequently promotes the chemisorption of HCOO and OH.112 Thus loading Pt nanoparticles on the surface of TiO2 can boost the production of CH4 from CO2 and H2O, as reported experimentally.10,113 However, more studies discovered that Pt cocatalysts prevailingly facilitate hydrogen production, especially in the presence of water. Compared with Pt, Ag cocatalyst-loaded BaLa4Ti4O15 (via liquid-phase reduction) showed selective CO2 reduction to CO over water splitting in the presence of an aqueous photocatalyst suspension with bubbling CO2.104 In the presence of aqueous solution, the selectivity of competitive water splitting and CO2 reduction over the cocatalyst depends on the activation energies of the two reactions and the interactions between CO2/H2O/the reaction intermediates and the cocatalyst. Pt, NiO, Ru, and Au cocatalysts are highly effective for H2 production by water splitting, and usually appear to be not active for CO2 reduction. Doped NaTaO3 (NaTaO3:A, where A = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, or La) was reported as a highly active photocatalyst for CO2 reduction to simultaneously form CO, H2, and O2 in aqueous solution under UV irradiation when used with a Ag cocatalyst. The selectivity for CO formation [CO/(CO + H2)] on Ca-, Sr-, and Ba-doped NaTaO3 photocatalysts was calculated to reach around 90%.114
Cu–Pt-coated TiO2 nanotubes were also reported as effective photocatalysts for the photoreduction of diluted CO2 (0.998% in N2) with a hydrocarbon production rate of 610 nmol cm−2 h−1 at room temperature, although no detailed mechanism was investigated.82 Also on a TiO2 photocatalyst, gold–copper nanoalloys exhibited a rate of CH4 production above 2000 μmol (g of photocatalyst)−1 h−1 for CO2 reduction under sun simulated light, with the selectivity of CB-electrons for CH4 formation over H2 about 97%, which differs from that measured for Au/P25 and Cu/P25.115 Further mechanism investigation revealed that under visible light, the hot electrons from Au are transferred to the surface Cu atoms, while the excess holes oxidize water and generate protons, which will be used further for CH4 production. Accordingly, the role of Au is for the visible light response, while that of Cu is for binding CO for further CH4 generation. RuO2 was reported as an effective cocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CH4,69,102 but insight into the mechanism is not clear. In a more detailed investigation, the workers in Yu’s group studied the facet effects of Pd cocatalysts on O2 reduction over C3N4. On the basis of experimental studies of charge transfer dynamics and the atomic-scale DFT modeling of CO2 adsorption and CH3OH desorption, it was found that the Pd(111) surface is a more preferable electron sink and is more favorable for CO2 adsorption and CH3OH desorption, thus leading to a higher efficiency for CO2 photoreduction.116
With the development of single atomic catalysts (SACs), single atomic precious metal cocatalysts have also been applied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. As a typical example, isolated Cu atoms in a Pd lattice were fabricated as highly selective sites for photocatalytic CO2 conversion to CH4 (Fig. 6). The Pd7Cu1–TiO2 photocatalyst exhibits a CH4 production rate of 19.6 μmol gcat−1 h−1 with a high selectivity of 96%. Further synchrotron-radiation characterization and theoretical simulation results implied that the isolated Cu atoms in the Pd lattice could play two roles in the enhanced CO2-to-CH4 conversion: (i) providing Cu–Pd pair sites for CO2 adsorption enhancement and H2 evolution suppression; (ii) elevating the d-band center of the Cu sites for CO2 activation improvement. This work highlights the important role of lattice engineering at atomic precision for CO2 reduction on the surface of semiconductors.117 As depicted by DFT calculations, single Pd and Pt atoms supported on C3N4 can exhibit excellent activity in CO2 reduction, where the individual metal atoms function as active sites and C3N4 provides a source of hydrogen from the hydrogen evolution reaction. The results showed that HCOOH is the preferred product of CO2 reduction on the Pd/C3N4 catalyst, with a rate-determining barrier of 0.66 eV, while the Pt/C3N4 catalyst prefers to reduce CO2 to CH4 with a rate-determining barrier of 1.16 eV.118 In Prof. Osamu Ishitani’s group, pioneering research has been reported on CO2 photoreduction with a ruthenium molecule catalyst attached onto semiconductor supports.119–121

In a heterogeneous system consisting of a ruthenium complex and C3N4, an optimized TON of greater than 1000 for formic acid production and an apparent quantum yield of 5.7% at 400 nm was obtained.119 A Ru(II) binuclear catalytic unit (RuRu′) loaded on mesoporous C3N4 selectively reduced CO2 to HCOOH under visible light (λ > 400 nm) in the presence of a suitable electron donor with high durability, even in aqueous solution. The RuRu′/Ag/C3N4 photocatalyst exhibited a high turnover number (TON) of more than 33000 with respect to the amount of RuRu′, and maintained high selectivity for HCOOH production (87–99%). The results of photocatalytic reactions, emission decay measurements, and time-resolved infrared spectroscopy indicated that Ag nanoparticles on C3N4 collected electrons with lifetimes of several milliseconds from the conduction band of C3N4, which were transferred to the excited state of RuRu′, thereby promoting photocatalytic CO2 reduction driven by two-step photoexcitation of C3N4 and RuRu′.120 Such a hybrid system even worked in aqueous solution with high durability. This work has successfully applied the homogeneous Ru molecule catalyst to the heterogeneous photocatalytic system and bridged well for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous CO2 photo-reduction.


2.2.2 Transition metal-based cocatalysts and carbon-based cocatalysts. 
For more practical applications of catalytic CO2 reduction, exploring inexpensive transition metal-based cocatalysts with efficient activities is essentially important. Ternary transition metal oxides like ZnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4 have been utilized as cocatalysts in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 for the first time.122,123 ZnCo2O4 and MnCo2O4 microspheres functioned as stable cocatalysts to cooperatively achieve the deoxygenative reduction of CO2 to CO under visible light in the presence of a photosensitizer. Miyauchi et al. reported Cu(II) oxide nanoclusters as efficient cocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction when grafted onto the surface of niobate nanosheets (light harvesters).124 Detailed ESR spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that electrons are extracted from water molecules and then excited by photon energy, promoting their injection into Cu(II) oxide nanoclusters to produce CO molecules.124 The research group members also reported thin films of SrTiO3 (STO) nanorods loaded with reduction and oxidation cocatalysts with selective reduction activity of CO2 to CO, with equivalent oxygen molecules produced through water oxidation under UV irradiation. Specifically, a CuxO nanocluster was chosen to achieve selective reduction of CO2 to CO, and a cobalt- and phosphate-based cocatalyst (CoPi) facilitated oxidation on the STO surface for oxygen generation. The dual cocatalyst-loaded STO film exhibited 2.5 times higher CO generation, whereas H2 production was very limited.125 Similar enhanced performance was reported over Ni, NiO and Co3O4 cocatalysts for CO2 reduction.27,126,127 These cocatalysts not only dramatically enhance optical absorbance, but also efficiently avoid electron–hole recombination. Zhai et al. constructed a core–shell-structured Pt@Cu2O co-catalyst, which significantly promotes CO2 photocatalytic reduction to CH4 and CO in the presence of H2O. It is proposed that the Pt core extracts the photogenerated electrons from TiO2, while the Cu2O shell provides sites for the preferential activation and conversion of CO2 molecules. The core–shell structure markedly suppresses the reduction of H2O to H2.105
Most of the reported cocatalysts facilitate the reductive half-reaction, while a few exceptional studies showed that the cocatalyst facilitated the oxidative half-reaction and also increased CO2 reduction. For example, noble metal-free polyoxometalates (Co4) with oxidative abilities were first introduced into C3N4 to form inexpensive hybrid materials (Co4@C3N4) with staggered band alignment, which showed a higher activity for CO2 reduction than bare C3N4. An optimized CO production rate of 107 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm) and high selectivity (94%) for CO production were obtained. After 10 h of irradiation, the production of CO reached 896 μmol g−1. Mechanistic studies revealed that the introduction of Co4 not only facilitated the charge transfer of C3N4 but also greatly increased the surface catalytic oxidative ability.128
By contrast, a transition metal molecule cocatalyst (also considered as a kind of single atom catalyst) anchored on the semiconductor substrate is more efficient in the CO2 reduction process and is key in controlling the selectivity for CO2 reduction, which may originate from the highly-active homogeneous CO2 reduction over the organic molecular catalyst.120,129 Anchoring such a molecule onto semiconductor substrates with a controlled configuration is considered to bridge the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts by combining the merits of both counterparts.130 For instance, Ye and co-authors constructed a covalently-linked reaction center/antenna hybrid composed of Co–porphyrin and low-molecular-weight carbon nitride via two wet-chemical steps for the reduction of CO2 to CO under visible light for the first time. The hybrids exhibited 13-fold higher photocatalytic activity (17 μmol g−1 h−1) compared with bulk C3N4, which is more than twice that in the Co–porphyrin-loaded C3N4 heterojunction system. The enhanced activity is considered to originate from the efficient electron transfer and trapping by the Co active sites as well as the affinity of Co–porphyrin for CO2. The findings may open a promising route to immobilizing the active site in the light-harvesting antenna for efficient electron–hole separation, electron transfer and the following redox reaction in the photocatalytic process, which would reform the conventional semiconductor-cocatalyst heterojunction system.131 Immobilization of nickel terpyridine complexes on CdS quantum dots resulted in photocatalytically active CO2 reduction with >90% selectivity in water under UV-filtered simulated solar light irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, λ > 400 nm, pH 6.7, 25 °C). It was found that the performance of this hybrid system crucially depended on the interface between the nanoparticulate photosensitizer and the molecular catalyst.132
Carbon-based materials have also been explored for cocatalytic CO2 reduction due to the electron sink ability. For instance, novel hybrid C3N4 and carbon (H-g-C3N4/C) composites with various carbon contents were developed by a facile one-step pyrolysis method using melamine and natural soybean oil as precursors. It was indicated that introduction of carbon components can effectively improve the textural properties and electronic conductivity of the composites, which exhibited improved activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O in comparison with bulk g-C3N4. The H-g-C3N4/C-6 catalyst with a carbon content of 3.77 wt% exhibited the highest CO and CH4 yield, i.e. 22.60 μmol gcat−1 and 12.5 μmol gcat−1, respectively, under 9 h simulated solar irradiation.133 Another carbon material, i.e. graphene oxide, was composited with CsPbBr3 quantum dots to form novel photocatalyst hybrids for converting CO2 into solar fuels in non-aqueous media. Under AM 1.5G simulated illumination, the electron consumption rate over the composite increased by 25.5% compared with bare CsPbBr3 quantum dots, due to improved electron extraction and transport with the presence of graphene oxide as an electron sink.56
To summarize the recent exploration of light harvester materials and cocatalytic materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, great progress has been achieved to increase the quantum efficiency through increasing light absorption, improving charge-carrier separation and facilitating the surface redox reactions. However, the actual product yield still remains in μmol h−1, as shown in Table 1, which is far from the criteria for practical applications. Thus it is challenging to carry out more revolutionary investigations via material engineering to improve the performance.

3. Electrochemical CO2 reduction
As mentioned in many review articles,6,134,135 CO2 reduction is challenging in thermodynamic terms, especially as the single reduction of CO2 to CO2˙− only occurs at E = −1.90 V due to the large reorganization energy between the extremely stable linear molecule and the bent radical anion. It is even more challenging in kinetic terms to assemble the nuclei and form chemical bonds for the final more complex and energetic molecule products. In the electrocatalytic process, appropriate catalysts are necessary for activation/reduction. The catalysts are supposed to either direct the complete steps for converting CO2 to CO, then to H2CO, and further to hydrocarbons/alcohols with low kinetic barriers, or to direct each of the steps with “catalyst panels” in a parallel approach, where each panel contains optimal catalysts for each step in the overall transformation of CO2 into a liquid fuel. An electrocatalyst participates in an electron transfer reaction and facilitates the acceleration of a chemical reaction (Fig. 7). Electrocatalysts are evaluated by redox potentials, current efficiencies, electron transfer rates and chemical kinetics. Direct electrochemical reduction of CO2 on a bare electrode surface usually requires large overvoltages, which are defined as the difference between the applied electrode potential (Vapplied) and E0(products/substrates) at a given current density. Low overvoltages and high production selectivities over catalysts with formal potentials  well matched to E0(products/substrates) are the ideal outcome of catalyst exploration for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.
 Fig. 7  Electrocatalysis of CO2 reduction with the catalyst loaded on an electrode. 
Although various molecule catalysts in the homogeneous phase have been reported to catalyse the electrochemical reduction of CO2, in this review, only solid-state catalysts on electrodes in the heterogeneous phase will be reviewed, which means that all the Cat shown in Fig. 7 anchored onto electrodes and only heterogeneous catalytic process with KCat as rate constants will be included herein. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 can be traced back to the 1970s. Since then, various electrocatalysts have been developed apart from the large number of homogeneous molecule electrocatalysts, such as precious metal (oxide), transition metal (oxide), conductive polymer and immobilized molecule catalysts. In the following part, recent important progress in material exploration for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction will be discussed in three categories, namely catalyst structure engineering, immobilized molecule catalysts, and hybrid catalysts.
3.1. Catalyst structure engineering
In this section, typical electrocatalyst development for CO2 reduction on precious metal-based catalysts, transition metal-based catalysts, and other non-precious catalysts with respect to crystal structuring, nano-structuring and surface engineering will be reviewed in detail. For clear comparison, structure engineering on precious metal-based catalysts, transition metal-based catalysts, and other non-precious catalysts will be discussed respectively.

3.1.1 Precious metal-based catalysts. 
Despite many years’ research on the reduction of CO2 over metallic electrodes, such approaches have still not been commercialized due to the high overpotential and low selectivity. Generally, precious Pt group metals are well-known for CO2 electroreduction. The different CO2, CO and H2 adsorption behaviors on these previous metals lead to various catalytic activities and selectivities. Pt electrodes have been applied for CO2 electroreduction in various media like water, CH3CN, DMSO, etc. It was found that in water-free electrolytes, CO2 is mainly reduced to oxalate over Pt electrodes since the CO2− intermediate can react with CO2 to form oxalate, while with the increased water concentration, a high proportion of HCOO− and CO can be produced.136,137 To enhance the efficiency and selectivity, single-crystal surface-structured Pt was applied.138 It resulted in the atomically flat surfaces, Pt(111) and Pt(100), showing poor activity for CO2 reduction, while the introduction of step sites to the (111) or (100) surface significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The rate increases proportionally with the step atom density in the order for the stepped surface: Pt(111) < Pt(100) < Pt(S)-[n(111) × (100)] < Pt(S)-[n(111) × (100)] < Pt(S)-[n(111) × (111)] < Pt(110). Kinked step surfaces show higher activity than stepped surfaces: the reduction rate per kink atom is more than twice as high as the value per step atom. Densely packed kink atoms along the step line greatly promote the reduction of CO2. Similar surface crystal effects were also discovered over other Pt group metals like Pd and Rh.139,140
Au has been targeted as an electrode material due to the high activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction to CO among polycrystalline metals.141 With the development of nanomaterials, various nanostructured Au materials have been applied for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Chen et al. showed that the reduction of thick Au oxide films resulted in the formation of Au nanoparticles (“oxide-derived Au”) that exhibited highly selective and stable CO2 reduction to CO in water at overpotentials as low as 140 mV for at least 8 h, compared with the overpotentials of at least 340 mV over polycrystalline Au electrodes and several other nanostructured Au electrodes under identical conditions. Electrokinetic studies indicated that the improved activity was attributed to the dramatically increased stabilization of the CO2˙− intermediates on the surfaces of the oxide-derived Au electrodes.142 Similar efficient and selective CO2 electroreduction to CO over ultrathin Au nanowires and monodispersed Au nanoparticles was reported by Sun’s group (Fig. 8).143 The authors also calculated the binding energies of the key COOH and CO intermediates on the Au nanowires, Au13 clusters and Au(211) using DFT with the GPAW calculator. It was suggested that both COOH and CO preferentially bind to the bridge site on the Au nanowire edge, with COOH binding marginally (0.04 eV) more strongly than on the Au(211) edge, while CO binds 0.23 eV more weakly than on the Au13 corner, implying that a nanowire surface with maximal edge sites maintains the activation of CO2 to COOH and facilitates the release of CO.144

Lu et al. reported a nanoporous Ag electrocatalyst that is able to electrochemically reduce CO2 to CO with approximately 92% selectivity at a rate over 3000 times higher than its polycrystalline counterpart under moderate overpotentials of <0.50 V.145 The electrochemical surface area is approximately 150 times larger compared with polycrystalline silver. The intrinsically higher activity may be due to the greater stabilization of CO2− intermediates on the highly curved surface, resulting in smaller overpotentials and high selectivity.
There are relatively few studies focused on RuO2 for electronic CO2 reduction. According to Spataru et al., conductive metallic oxides are promising electrocatalysts for higher reduction products. The main reduction products obtained in acidic and neutral media were formic acid and methanol, with product efficiencies as high as 40 and 7.7%, respectively.146 Later, Karamad et al. investigated the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on RuO2 using density functional theory (DFT). The thermodynamic stability of various surface terminations in the electrochemical environment was studied and CO-covered surfaces were found to be particularly stable, although their formation might be kinetically limited under mildly reducing conditions. The authors identified the lowest free energy pathways for CO2 reduction to formic acid (HCOOH), methanol (CH3OH), and methane (CH4) on partially-reduced RuO2(110) covered with 0.25 and 0.5 mL of CO*, finding that CO2 is reduced to formic acid, which is further reduced to methanol and methane.147


3.1.2 Transition metal-based catalysts. 
Much research has focused on copper electrodes instead of other metals that have been tested, due to the ability of copper to directly produce hydrocarbons and other products at a high current efficiency. Hori’s group conducted extensive studies on the electrochemical reduction of CO2 at copper electrodes and concluded that the sensitivity of adsorbed hydrogen species to the underlying structure of the copper electrode had a great impact on the product distribution.148–150 Since they display a medium hydrogen overvoltage and weak CO adsorption, Cu electrodes enable the reaction of CO intermediates to more reduced species in significant amounts. Nanostructured copper has been intensively investigated in the past decade.151,152 For instance, Cu nanoparticle catalysts in the 2–15 nm mean size range were prepared by Reske et al., and their catalytic activities and selectivities during CO2 electroreduction were analyzed and compared to bulk Cu electrodes. With decreasing Cu particle size, a dramatic increase in the catalytic activity and selectivity for H2 and CO was observed, in particular for nanoparticles below 5 nm. Hydrocarbon (methane and ethylene) selectivity was increasingly suppressed for nanoscale Cu surfaces. The surface model results indicated that changes in the population of low-coordinated surface sites and their stronger chemisorption were related to surging H2 and CO selectivities, higher catalytic activity, and smaller hydrocarbon selectivity. The presented performance–structure relationships provide novel insight into the CO2 electroreduction reaction on nanoscale surfaces.152 This conclusion is also supported by other computational studies.153,154 Sen et al. reported a distinguished onset potential, formed products and faradaic efficiencies over copper foams with hierarchical porosity compared with those over smooth copper electrodes. Specifically, the onset potential for the production observation was ∼200 mV more positive than that required at smooth copper electrodes. The faradaic efficiency of formate was 26% at −1.1 V, while it was only 3% at smooth copper. It was implied that the electroreduction of CO2 followed both the F-intermediate and C-intermediate pathways. Increasing the thickness of the copper nanofoams further enhanced the faradaic efficiency of HCOOH up to 29% due to the suppressed electrochemical reduction of adsorbed H* to H2.155 Li et al. reported that the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activities over Cu0 electrodes resulting from copper oxide reduction varied widely depending on the properties of the initial copper oxide layer.156 It was shown that Cu particles prepared by reducing μm-thick Cu2O films were able to catalyze the reduction of CO2 to form CO and HCO2H with high faradaic efficiencies at exceptionally low overpotentials and to form C2 hydrocarbons with the exclusion of CH4 at high overpotentials. Furthermore, CO2 reduction with these electrodes is resistant to deactivation for at least several hours, which is a marked improvement over the rapid deactivation of polycrystalline Cu under identical conditions. Other nanostructured Cu materials like copper nanocubes,157 copper nanowires158 and nanoscale Cu particles152,159 have also been investigated for efficient and selective CO2 reduction. However, the detailed mechanism for these various Cu electrodes has not been fully investigated and the rate-limiting and key selectivity-determining steps are still controversial. Nie et al. presented a systematic determination of the CO2 electroreduction mechanism on Cu electrodes, including the rate-limiting and selectivity-determining steps.160 The results show that it is misleading that the preferred path for methane production depends solely on reaction free energies, and reaction kinetics of elementary steps provide a different mechanistic explanation for methane/ethylene selectivity compared to methanol on Cu electrodes. An alternative reaction path that explains both methane and ethylene production through a hydroxymethylidyne (COH) intermediate from CO reduction was provided, which reconciled the latest experimental results from the Koper research group.161,162
Besides the widely-studied Cu metal catalyst, copper(I) oxide film has been reported for selective CO2 electroreduction using KHCO3 as an electrolyte. Remarkably, it was found that the faradaic yields of ethylene and ethanol could be systematically tuned by changing the thickness of the deposited overlayers. Films of 1.7–3.6 μm thickness exhibited the best selectivity for these C2 compounds at −0.99 V vs. RHE, with faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 34–39% for ethylene and 9–16% for ethanol. Less than 1% methane was formed. Further analysis revealed that the Cu2O films were reduced rapidly and remained as metallic Cu0 particles during the CO2 reduction.163
Cobalt-based catalysts are not considered as efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction in spite of the loosely bonded d-electrons and the resulting high electrical conductivity. In a recent study, Gao et al. firstly fabricated two kinds of four-atom-thick layers: pure cobalt metal and co-existing domains of cobalt metal and cobalt oxide, as shown in Fig. 9. Evaluation of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance indicated that the surface cobalt atoms of the atomically thin layers have higher intrinsic activity and selectivity towards formate production at lower overpotentials than the surface cobalt atoms on bulk samples. Partial oxidation of the atomic layers can further increase the intrinsic activity, resulting in stable current densities of about 10 mA cm−2 over 40 hours, with approximately 90% formate selectivity at an overpotential of only 0.24 V.164 The work also indicated that morphology and oxidation state control can transform a material considered nearly non-catalytic for CO2 reduction into a very active and robust catalyst.

In comparison, research on cobalt–porphyrin active sites for CO2 electroreduction can be traced back to 30 years ago, when cobalt porphyrin was used as an efficient homogeneous catalyst for CO2 electroreduction.165 In the past two years, the heterogeneous electroreduction of CO2 over cobalt–porphyrin active sites has been developed due to the construction of organic frameworks with cobalt porphyrin units.166,167 Lin et al. reported the modular optimization of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on cobalt porphyrin, which exhibited high faradaic efficiency for CO (90%) and TON (up to 290000 with an initial turnover frequency of 9400 h−1) at pH 7 with an overpotential of −0.55 V in aqueous solution. The activity was stable over 24 hours and equivalent to a 60-fold improvement compared to the molecular cobalt complex. Further X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) investigations indicated that the COF environment could directly modulate the electronic properties of molecular centers coupled into the extended lattice and the interaction between the metal and COF lattice could furnish a cobalt center with a more delocalized electronic structure.166 Similarly, MOFs with cobalt porphyrin as building units were introduced by Kornienko et al. (Fig. 10).167 As atomically defined and nanoscopic materials, the Co–porphyrin based MOFs function as stable electrocatalysts for the efficient and selective reduction of CO2 to CO in aqueous solution in at least 7 h, with a selectivity for CO production higher than 76% and a TON of 1400. In situ spectroelectrochemical testing implied that the majority of catalytic centers in this MOF are redox-accessible where Co(II) is reduced to Co(I), which is in agreement with the results reported by Lin et al.166 It was inferred that the rate-limiting step may be either CO2 molecules adsorbing onto Co(I) porphyrin coupled with a one-electron reduction, or a one-electron reduction of the Co(I)–CO2 adduct.

Transition metal dichalcogenides including MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2 have been explored by Asadi et al. for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in ionic liquid media. It was first reported that three-dimensional bulk molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can catalyze CO2 reduction to CO at an extremely low overpotential of 54 mV.168 Later, the authors reported 2D nanoflake architectures of transition metal dichalcogenides with much higher performance for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, among which tungsten diselenide nanoflakes showed a current density of 18.95 mA cm−2, CO faradaic efficiency of 24%, and CO formation TOF of 0.28 s−1 at a low overpotential of 54 mV.169


3.1.3 Other non-precious metal electrodes and metal-free electrodes. 
A special Pb film prepared by reducing PbO2 precursors exhibited up to 700-fold lower proton reduction than polycrystalline Pb foil, but the CO2 reduction ability was still maintained. This Pb film converts HCO3− to HCO2− with almost 100% faradaic efficiency, while the Pb foil has less than 10% efficiency. Electrokinetic data suggest that the difference in selectivity between the two electrodes is caused by a difference in the surface metastable Pb oxide layer, which is passivating for H+ reduction but active for CO2 reduction.170
Tin electrodes have been reported with various faradaic efficiencies,171–175 which indicate that the electrocatalytic activity is highly dependent on the structure and morphology of the catalyst. In recent studies, it has commonly been discovered that Sn is inclined towards H2 evolution, while oxidized SnOx can efficiently participate in the CO2 reduction pathway, either by providing chemical functionality to stabilize the incipient negative charge on CO2 or by mediating the electron transfer directly.173,175
As low-priced and metal-free materials, carbon materials such as N-doped carbon nanofibres176 and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes177,178 have been reported for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. For example, the carbon nanofibre catalyst exhibits a negligible overpotential (0.17 V) for CO2 reduction and more than 10-fold higher current density compared with the silver catalyst under similar experimental conditions. The catalytic proficiency is attributed to (i) the highly positive charges on carbon atoms due to the existence of electronegative nitrogen atoms within the carbon lattice and (ii) the nanofibrillar structure coupled with fractal-like corrugations of the individual fibres, leading to a large number of active sites.176 It is generally concluded that N-doped carbon materials appear to facilitate the stabilization of the intermediate CO2˙− radical anion and two-electron production (e.g. CO and HCOOH).

3.2. Immobilized molecule catalysts
Inspired by the high activities of molecule catalysts in the homogeneous phase, immobilizing such active molecule catalysts onto electrodes or conductive substrates has been considered as a promising approach to boost heterogeneous electronic CO2 reduction.
Based on the outstanding performance of microporous Co–porphyrin-based frameworks, the immobilization of Co–porphyrin sites onto conductive electrodes like carbon,179–181 ITO electrodes182 and Au183 has attracted much interest in recent research. For example, Shen et al. reported a cobalt protoporphyrin immobilized on a pyrolytic graphite electrode, which reduces CO2 in an aqueous acidic solution with a relatively low overpotential of 0.5 V and high efficiency/selectivity. The main product is CO, with CH4 as a by-product. It was found that since the reduction of CO is pH-dependent, the selectivity of CO2 towards CO increases with higher pH, while the selectivity towards CH4 decreases with higher pH. One overall mechanism was suggested: the initial step of the CO2 reduction resulted in a catalyst-bound CO2˙− radical anion, which has strong Brønsted-base character and can abstract a proton from water, leading to an overall CO2 reduction reactivity whose pH dependence is substantially different from the competing H2 evolution. The further reduction of CO to methane and methanol is slow due to the weak binding of CO to the catalyst and the fact that CO reduction prefers a more acidic environment. It is also implied that the lower potential for this catalyst-bound CO2˙− radical anion is key for catalysts with lower overpotential for CO2 reduction.180 Perfluorinated cobalt phthalocyanine (CoFPc) immobilized on carbon electrodes was reported for CO2 reduction. The fluorine substituents on porphyrin decrease its affinity towards CO, suppressing catalyst poisoning. In addition, the Co(I) intermediate is more accessible since the redox chemistry of the Co site in CoFPc is perturbed compared with that of un-fluorinated cobalt phthalocyanine. Thus a resulting faradaic efficiency of up to 93% was achieved for CO production in aqueous solution at 0.8 V vs. RHE with high stability.181
Similarly, Weng et al. reported a molecular copper–porphyrin complex (copper(II)-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)porphyrin) that can be used as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst with high activity and selectivity for reducing CO2 to hydrocarbons in aqueous media.184 The catalyst is able to drive partial current densities of 13.2 and 8.4 mA cm−2 for methane and ethylene production from CO2 reduction, at −0.976 V vs. RHE, corresponding to TOFs of 4.3 and 1.8 molecules per site per s for methane and ethylene, respectively. This represents the highest catalytic activity to date for hydrocarbon production over a molecular CO2 reduction electrocatalyst, which is attributed to the built-in hydroxyl groups in the porphyrin structure and the high reactivity of the copper(I) metal center.184
As recently reported by Reisner et al., the assembly of a [MnBr(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3] complex anchored to a carbon nanotube electrode via a pyrene unit allowed the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 under fully aqueous conditions with a catalytic onset overpotential η = 360 mV, and the controlled potential electrolysis generated more than a thousand turnovers at η = 550 mV. The production selectivity was tuned by alteration of the catalyst loading on the nanotube surface. CO was observed as the main product at high catalyst loading, whereas formate was the dominant CO2 reduction product of CO2 reduction at low catalyst loading. Two different intermediates were identified as being responsible for the change in selectivity of the heterogenized Mn catalyst. The formation of a dimeric Mn0 species at higher surface loading was shown to preferentially lead to CO formation, whereas at lower surface loading the electrochemical generation of a monomeric Mn-hydride greatly enhanced the production of formate.185
3.3. Hybrid catalysts
To maximize the performance by virtue of the advantages of different catalysts and synergistic effects, hybrids comprising multi-metals, metals and carbon, metal oxides and metals, etc. have also been investigated for electronic CO2 reduction.
For example, to understand the fundamental catalytic activity in CO2 reduction, Kim et al. assembled uniform Au–Cu bimetallic nanoparticles with different compositions into ordered monolayers on a well-defined platform.186 It was shown that the multi-parameter reactions could be described in terms of two effects, i.e. the electronic effect and the geometric effect, through which the interactions between the intermediates and the surface of a specific catalyst can be deduced and the catalytic activity can be tuned. In order to obtain high selectivity, the proton–catalyst interaction should be mitigated and the binding strength of the first few intermediates like COOH and CO should be optimized. For products with multi-electrons and protons like CH4, the catalyst should be able to stabilize the CO intermediate for efficient coupling with the adsorbed proton or hydroxyl groups, during which H2 evolution might be inevitable if no atomic configuration on the active site can prohibit proton–proton coupling. Recently, in Koper’s group, electrodeposited palladium on platinum exhibited a dramatically reduced onset potential for CO2 reduction to formic acid in comparison to bulk palladium (a decrease from −1.2 V vs. RHE (for bulk palladium) to −0.1 V vs. RHE (for Pd–Pt)).187 However, the formation of CO on the surface rapidly poisoned the catalyst and diminished the catalytic activity. Later the authors reported the synthesis of PdxPt(100−x)/C nanoparticles and their electrocatalytic properties for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid. It was found that PdxPt(100−x)/C nanoparticles have a very low onset potential for the reduction of CO2 to formic acid of ca. 0 V vs. RHE, which approaches the theoretical equilibrium potential of 0.02 V vs. RHE for this reaction. Furthermore, the Pd70Pt30/C catalyst shows a faradaic efficiency of 88% towards formic acid after 1 hour of electrolysis at −0.4 V vs. RHE with an average current density of ∼5 mA cm−2. Therefore this catalyst avoids strong deactivation.188
Also with the aid of carbon materials, a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and cobalt tetra-amino phthalocyanine (CoTAPc) composite modified electrode was fabricated by the layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technique, which turned out to significantly decrease the overpotential of CO2 reduction, and successfully reduced CO2 to formic acid (with a rate of up to 21.0 ± 0.2 mg L−1 h−1). Compared with the case without MWCNT, the MWCNT/CoTAPc composite modified electrode exhibited an enhanced current and formic acid production rate of approximately 20% and 100%, respectively, reaching the maximum faradaic efficiency at a cathode potential of ca. −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The coupling of the catalytic electrode and the bioelectrochemical system could realize the targeted reduction of CO2 in the absence of external energy input.189
As reported by Chen and Kanan, a Sn electrode with a native SnOx layer exhibited better selectivity for CO production against H2 in aqueous NaHCO3 solution saturated with CO2, since SnOx enables CO2 reduction to occur by stabilizing CO2˙−, otherwise Sn0 only catalyzes H2 evolution due to the slow electron transfer to CO2. The CO2 reduction activity of Sn/SnOx compares favorably to that of many other metal electrodes in aqueous electrolytes. The thin-film catalyst prepared by simultaneous electrodeposition of Sn0 and SnOx on a Ti electrode exhibited up to 8-fold higher partial current density and 4-fold higher faradaic efficiency for CO2 reduction than a Sn electrode with a native SnOx layer. The authors highlighted the importance of SnOx for CO2 reduction on Sn surfaces to raise the possibility that metal oxides may be involved in CO2 reduction pathways on other metal electrodes.175
Similarly, as constructed by Luc et al.,190 Ag–Sn electrocatalysts with a core–shell nanostructure containing a bimetallic core for high electronic conductivity and an ultra-thin partially-oxidized SnOx shell for catalytic CO2 conversion exhibited a high formate faradaic efficiency of ∼80% and a formate partial current density of ∼16 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V vs. RHE, with an optimal SnOx shell thickness of ∼1.7 nm. DFT calculations showed that the oxygen vacancies on the SnO(101) surface are stable at highly negative potentials and are crucial for CO2 activation. It was further found that the volcano-like relationship of the catalytic activity towards formate as a function of the bulk Sn concentration arose from the competing effects of favorable stabilization of OCHO* by lattice expansion and electron conductivity loss due to the increased thickness of the SnOx layer.
Other composites based on Ru or RuOx have also been reported. Earlier examples were Cu–Cd-modified Ru, and Cu–Cd-modified RuOx + IrOx, with products of methanol and acetone.191 Later, RuO2–TiO2 nanotube-modified Pt electrodes with the product of CH3OH and a current efficiency of up to 60.5%192 were reported. It was found that RuO2 composited with TiO2 nanotubes showed higher electrocatalytic activity than bare RuO2 and RuO2 composited with TiO2 nanoparticles, with the current efficiency for the conversion of CO2 to methanol up to 60.5%, although no detailed mechanism was investigated.192
From the above discussion, significant improvement has been achieved for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with structure explorations of catalyst structure engineering, immobilized molecule catalysts, and hybrid catalysts. The faradaic efficiency and product selectivity have been largely improved. However, the stability of the electrodes and the performance durability are far from satisfactory, to which more efforts need to be devoted. Apart from experimental exploration, the theoretical computational design of new catalysts offers good guidance for the development of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.193–195
4. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of carbon dioxide

Fig. 11 shows the typical heterogeneous catalysis of photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction through a molecular catalyst-decorated semiconductor electrode. Based on the reported hybrid systems, the properties of each component (e.g. the semiconductor and decorated catalyst) have an important impact on the activity of CO2 reduction. For the semiconductor, its optical absorption affects the quantum yield, while for the molecule catalyst, the constituents and structure determine the product selectivity, as well as the final quantum yield. Compared with photocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis has a broader selection of semiconductors with the aid of electric input. Those semiconductors with a CB level lower than the CO2 redox potential level are still able to function as photocathodes. In addition, compared with electrocatalysis, extra illumination is also favorable to further decrease the overpotential for CO2 reduction. To date, there have been a few reports on photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction over electrodes mainly consisting of a pure semiconductor, metal-modified semiconductor or semiconductor/metal catalyst hybrid, which can be divided into two kinds of configuration: (i) half-cells with sacrificial reagents such as triethanolamine (TEOA) as electron donors for oxidation in the anode electrode; (ii) full-cells with photoanodes consisting of semiconductors for water oxidation to compensate electrons. In terms of electrode materials, in the following section, we will review recent progress in research on photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction over pure semiconductor electrodes, metal-modified semiconductor electrodes and metal complex-modified semiconductor electrodes.
 Fig. 11  Schematic diagrams of three different schemes for PEC CO2 reduction on a semiconducting photocathode: (a) heterogeneous catalysis on a semiconductor electrode, (b) heterogeneous catalysis on a metal-modified semiconductor electrode, and (c) heterogeneous catalysis through a metal complex catalyst-modified semiconductor electrode. 
4.1. PEC CO2 reduction over semiconductor electrodes
Research on pure semiconductors as electrodes for PEC CO2 reduction can be traced back to four decades ago.196 With developments in materials research, various kinds of semiconductors have been applied as electrodes, such as p- and n-type GaAs, p-CdTe, p-InP, CdTe, TiO2, p-Si, p-GaP, etc.197 In the recent research literature, Barton et al. reported a p-GaP semiconductor that was able to reduce CO2 to methanol at underpotentials of more than 300 mV below the standard potential of −0.52 V vs. SCE at a pH of 5.2.198 A key feature of the system is the high faradaic efficiency (near 100%), since satisfactory selectivity and efficiency for the reduction of CO2 to methanol is extremely difficult to achieve due to similarities in the reduction potentials for methanol, formic acid, formaldehyde, and hydrogen. A carbamate was inferred to be the catalytic species leading to the reduction of CO2 to methanol, with evidence of possible hydride transfer from the pyridinium ring to CO2.198 Mg-doped CuFeO2 delafossite prepared via conventional solid-state methods and assembled into an electrode as a pressed pellet was reported to be photoelectrochemically active for CO2 reduction. The addition of a Mg2+ dopant is found to substantially improve the conductivity of the material. Using an applied electrode potential of −0.4 V vs. SCE, the photocurrent is found to be onset at irradiation wavelengths of ∼800 nm, with the incident photon-to-current efficiency reaching a value of 14% at 340 nm. The photoelectrodes were determined to have a −1.1 V vs. SCE conduction band edge and were found to be capable of the reduction of CO2 to formate at underpotentials of 400 mV.199
LaTempa et al. reported a full PEC cell composed of p-type Si nanowire arrays as photocathodes and TiO2 nanotube array films as photoanodes immersed in CO2-saturated 1.0 M NaHCO3. Under band gap illumination, the PEC cells converted CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane, along with CO and substantial rates of H2 generation from water photoelectrolysis. Traces of C3–C4 hydrocarbons, methane and ethylene were also formed at a combined rate of 201.5 nM cm−2 h−1 at an applied potential of −1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl.200 It was inferred that the 1-D orthogonal orientation of the Si nanowires and TiO2 nanotube arrays could provide a directed charge transport path, decoupling the processes of light absorption and charge separation, and the large effective surface areas of the nanowire and nanotube films could provide a maximum number of oxidation and reduction sites.
4.2. PEC CO2 reduction over metal-modified semiconductors
Transferring the catalytic activity of a metal catalyst to semiconductor photocathodes through discontinuous films of metals without sacrificing photovoltage incorporates the stability and catalytic activity of metal particles with semiconducting photocathodes. In an actual photoelectrocatalytic system, when a photoelectrode coupled with a metal catalyst is irradiated, the faradaic efficiency versus the applied potential shows similar behavior to the metal catalyst alone with a positive shift in the onset voltage, which is called the photovoltage shift. Cu, Ag, Au and Ru were widely used to couple with p-Si and p-GaP electrodes for CO2 reduction under illumination.201–203 In the past few years, various studies on applying nanostructuralized materials for photoelectrode construction have been reported.
For example, Jang et al. reported a new photocathode, i.e. a gold-coupled ZnTe/ZnO-nanowire (ZOZT) array, for selective CO2 reduction to CO, as shown in Fig. 12.204 At −0.7 V RHE under simulated 1 sun illumination, a photocurrent of −16.0 mA cm−2 and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (97%) was obtained, representing the highest among the reported ZnTe photocathodes for CO2 reduction, and a dramatic enhancement over those on a bare electrode (−7.9 mA cm−2, 68%). CO is the main product for the Au-modified ZnTe/ZnO-nanowire array, while hydrogen is the main product for bare ZnTe/ZnO-nanowires. The Au co-catalyst not only improved charge separation by forming a Schottky junction with ZnTe, but also provided reaction centers for CO2 reduction, suppressing the competing water reduction.204

A nanoporous Au thin film formed by the electrochemical reduction of an anodized Au thin film was coupled on a Si photoelectrode for a highly selective and efficient PEC CO2 reduction reaction. The Si photoelectrode with a reduced anodic-treated Au thin-film mesh exhibits excellent PEC CO2 reduction with a CO FE of over 90% and a CO producing current of −2.94 mA cm−2 at the CO2/CO equilibrium potential in an aqueous solution under 1 sun illumination. The efficient activity is considered to be due to the superior co-catalyst and photovoltage from the buried p–n junction in Si.205 A well-dispersed assembly of Au3Cu nanoparticles on the surface of Si nanowires was reported to realize the CO2-to-CO conversion under illumination.206 Such Au3Cu nanoparticle-decorated Si nanowire arrays can readily serve as effective CO2 reduction photoelectrodes, with a high CO2-to-CO selectivity close to 80% at −0.20 V vs. RHE and highly suppressed hydrogen evolution. An overpotential reduction of 120 mV compared to the planar counterpart was observed, resulting from the optimized spatial arrangement of the NP catalysts on the high surface area nanowire arrays.206 Cu was ever modified on Cu2O for efficient CO2 photoelctrochemical reduction. The irradiation of this system by UV-vis light resulted in efficient CO2 reduction at a low potential of +0.2 V. Detailed product distribution and pH effect investigations indicated that the product distribution is dependent on the radical intermediates formed during the process, such as OH˙, H˙ and CH3˙. The biased potential of the electrode and solution H+ significantly interfered in the stabilization of the product with the lowest oxidation state. In a NaHCO3/Na2CO3 buffer solution at pH 8, CH3OH generation is favored at an applied potential of 0.2 V.207
4.3. PEC CO2 reduction over metal complex-modified semiconductors
Similar to the strategy of introducing a single atom catalyst on a semiconductor support to combine the advantages of the homogeneous catalyst and the solid catalyst, a metal complex, i.e. a molecule catalyst, immobilized onto a photocathode to boost the performance has been developed in recent decades. For instance, InP coated with a Ru-complex (RuCP) functioned as a hybrid photocathode and was coupled with a reduced SrTiO3 photoanode to form a Z-scheme system, which was applied for CO2 reduction using water as an electron donor and a proton source without external electrical bias (Fig. 13).208 The conversion efficiency from solar energy to chemical energy could reach 0.14%, approximately half that of plants in nature. A r-STO/InP/[RuCP] wireless device was also fabricated and performed solar CO2 reduction in one compartment, with formate production and a conversion efficiency of 0.08%,208 which was higher than that of a similar Z-scheme system composed of TiO2/InP/[RuCP].209 It was implied that stimulated electron transfer from the photoanode to the photocathode is the main factor contributing to the observed improvement, due to an enlarged difference in the band-energy positions between r-STO and InP.

Compared with the simplest approach via dissolving the metal complex cocatalyst in the electrolyte,210,211 chemically linking the metal complex with a light harvester would result in more efficient electron trapping on the surface molecule catalysts for CO2 reduction due to the improved electron transfer. In addition, an insoluble metal complex catalyst can also be used in aqueous electrolytes if the complex is linked. For example, Schreier et al. reported the covalent immobilization of rhenium-containing CO2 reduction catalysts on the surface of a mesoporous TiO2-modified Cu2O photocathode for CO2 reduction.212 The observed photocurrents represent a significant improvement over those previously demonstrated with molecular catalysts homogeneously dissolved in electrolyte solutions, representing the first demonstration of using phosphonate linking groups to immobilize molecule electrocatalysts on the photoelectrode surface. As reported by Arai,213 PEC reduction of CO2 to HCOO− was successfully achieved by a p-type InP photocathode modified with an electropolymerized ruthenium complex in water. It was found that the total charge, calculated from the electric current over an unmodified photocathode, was much lower than that over the modified one, and no HCOO− was produced. This technique also decreased the required applied potential for CO2 reduction by utilizing solar energy. The metal-complex electrocatalyst can control the CO2 reduction selectivity over the inorganic semiconductor, even in aqueous solution. Similar linkage was carried out between the ruthenium complex and the narrow band-gap sulfide semiconductor Cu2ZnSnS4 with abundantly available and relatively cheap elements, resulting in a high selectivity (>80%) for CO2 reduction to formate. The activity was further enhanced by the insertion of Se into Cu2ZnSnS4, presumably due to enhanced carrier mobility.214
As an important type of solar cell, p-type dye-sensitized solar cells provide an ideal model to convert CO2 into solar fuels, to which NiO photocathodes decorated with supramolecular metal complexes have often been applied as photo-harvesters and CO2 catalytic centers. For example, a dyad composed of zinc porphyrin as a light-harvesting sensitizer and a rhenium bipyridyl complex as a catalytic moiety for reduction was loaded via a carboxylic group as an anchoring site on NiO for visible light-induced reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide.215 Upon visible light irradiation of the electrode in CO2-saturated DMF solution, the photoreduction of CO2 as well as a cathodic photocurrent was observed for the first time. The reactivity was remarkably enhanced by the co-adsorption of monomeric ZnTCPP as a sensitizer with the dyad, which was rationalized by the concept of “sensitization through light harvesting coupled with electron harvesting”. The surrounding sensitizers serve as an electron reservoir for the dyad, catalyzing the CO2 reduction.
A Ru(II)–Re(I) supramolecular photocatalyst anchored on a NiO electrode allows for intramolecular electron transfer from the reduced Ru unit to the Re unit, as the reduction potential of the Ru unit is more negative than that of the Re unit, allowing for the reduction of CO2 on the reduced Re unit. Once irradiated using λ > 460 nm light at −1.2 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 in a DMF–triethanolamine mixed solution under a CO2 atmosphere, the main product was CO, without the formation of H2 or CH4. The TON for CO formation was 32 (based on RuRe) and the average faradaic efficiency was 71% for 5 h irradiation.216 A similar hybrid photocathode based on a Ru(II)–Re(I) supramolecular metal complex photocatalyst covalently immobilized on a p-type NiO electrode (NiO–RuRe as a photocathode) was reported to generate CO with high selectivity in an aqueous electrolyte with a coupled CoOx-modified TaON photoanode and water as a reductant.217 In the hybrid photocathode, the Ru(II) part functions as a light harvester while Re(I) functions as a cocatalytic site. The light energy conversion efficiency of the reaction was calculated to be 1.6 × 10−5, considering the electrical bias of 0.3 V and chemical bias of 0.10 V from the pH difference between the two electrolytes.217
A visible light-responsive organic dye, P1, and the reversible CO2 cycling enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) were combined to modify a porous p-type semiconducting NiO electrode, which was reported to be able to selectively reduce CO2 to CO under visible light illumination and application of a mildly reducing potential. The assembly showed good stability under turnover conditions, indicating the possibility of being coupled with a photoanode for water oxidation in a tandem photoelectrochemical cell to close the photosynthetic cycle.218
Although photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction undoubtedly proves to be more advantageous because it combines the merits of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, studies are not as numerous as for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, especially in the full-cell construction with the photoanode consisting of a semiconductor for water oxidation to compensate electrons. Extending the stability of the photoelectrode is also a major challenge for future investigations.
5. Summary and outlook
CO2 conversion via energy input from solar and/or electric sources is a promising approach for relieving energy and environmental crises. Vigorous developments in the materials field have also led to important progress in catalyst applications in photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis in terms of catalyst structure engineering, cocatalyst construction and hybrid system designation. However, the achievements of present research are still not sufficiently satisfactory for practical utilization. In future studies, more effort should be directed towards the following issues from the viewpoint of materials, based on theoretical mechanistic studies based on density functional theory, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, and microkinetics modelling:219
(1) Developing new materials such as semiconductors, electrocatalysts, and photoelectrocatalysts. Semiconductors with a wide light response and efficient charge separation, electrocatalysts with improved product selectivity, photoelectrocatalysts with lower overpotential and more products in the liquid phase, etc. could be investigated. With regard to the cost and environmental sustainability considerations, exploring nontoxic catalysts with earth-abundant elements is more desirable.
(2) Optimizing the chemical linkages between the cocatalysts and catalysts. Combining a catalyst and cocatalyst such as a semiconductor and a metal complex, a conductive substrate and active catalytic sites could facilitate electron transfer and subsequently enhance the quantum efficiency and faradaic efficiency. To realize the ideal linkage, material modification technologies, surface interactions, and structure matching are promising strategies and directions.
(3) Enhancing the stability of catalysts. Up to now, most reported catalysts could only be maintained for less than several hours. For possible practical applications, developing technologies for stabilizing the catalyst structure and prolonging the catalyst lifetime is challenging and is of great importance.
(4) Full-cell construction in photoelectrocatalytic systems with a suitable semiconductor as a photoanode for water oxidation to compensate electrons needs more intensive investigation in the future for possible practical applications.
(5) More novel configuration construction for investigating mechanisms. Since it is difficult to obtain insight into the surface reaction mechanism in either photocatalysts, electrocatalysts or photoelectrocatalysts, more catalysts with special configurations need to be explored to gain more information about the reaction process, such as nanosheets, single atom catalysts, etc.
In brief, the greatest challenge in this field is to increase product generation rates from the nanomolar or micromolar scale by several orders of magnitude with satisfactory selectivity and stability, providing reaction volumes to obtain insight into the mechanisms and to improve the reaction kinetics.
