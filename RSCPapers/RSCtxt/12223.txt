    , Accepted 12th June 2020First published on 15th June 2020AbstractSyngas, as a necessary feedstock dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels, is a mixture of CO and H2, which could be prepared by a renewable strategy via electrochemical CO2 reduction in water electrolyte solutions. Herein, beaded Au@Co3O4 nanowire arrays (denoted as Au@Co3O4 NAs) were obtained by immersion in HAuCl4 solution with Co3O4 nanowire arrays. The Au@Co3O4 NAs exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance of producing syngas via tuning from 1:1 to 4:1 with controlling voltage. In addition, the Au@Co3O4 NAs showed better catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 320 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm−2, along with a small Tafel slope of 75 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH solution. The electrochemical performance of Au@Co3O4 NAs is obviously superior to Co3O4 NAs, which will open up a viable strategy for the design and fabrication of a bi-functional electrocatalyst for the overall reaction (CO2 + H2O → CO + H2 + O2).
Introduction
With the development of human society, the excessive consumption of fossil fuel has produced a great amount of CO2 emissions, thus causing the exacerbation of the greenhouse effect. For scientists, it is a very urgent goal to curtail the emission of CO2.1,2 The clean and efficient way to achieve this aim is to enable CO2 reutilization to fuels or other high value-added chemicals.3,4 Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ERC) is a promising strategy that can effectively reduce CO2 to form CO and O2, and it also has attracted extensive attention on the electrolysis of CO2 due to its use of a power source, which could be supplied by renewable energy sources such solar, wind and tidal energy. In fact, the reduction process of ERC involves a multiple electron- and proton-transfer reaction (including two, four, six and eight electron reaction), and the reduction products are often carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), formic acid (HCOOH) and ethanol (CH3CH2OH).5–8 Inspired by photosynthesis and overall water splitting, the overall electrocatalytic reaction H2O + CO2 → CO + H2 + O2 could be tried. For the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 in an aqueous electrolyte, the cathode is theoretically occupied by CO2 due to the competition of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which could be both electrolyzed CO2 and H2O to form syngas with a mixture of CO and H2. The corresponding reduction reaction is presented as H2O + 2e− → O2− + H2 or CO2 + 2e− → CO + O2−. The water oxidation simultaneously occurred at the anode electrolyzer with the reaction, O2− → O2 + 2e−. Thus, the overall electrocatalytic reaction is of great significance for the effective utilization of CO2, as well as the development of new technologies for energy conversion and storage. Syngas, as a necessary feedstock for many chemical industries, mainly relies on non-renewable fossil fuels, such as coal, petroleum and natural gas.9–15 The H2/CO ratio of syngas ranges from 0.5 to 3, and the synthesis-specific product should meet the specified H2/CO ratio with H2/CO = 3:1 for synthetic ammonia, H2/CO = 2:1 for methanol and H2/CO = 1:1 for higher alcohols.16 Thus, the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 in water is the most effective method, which could not only reduce greenhouse gas, but also synthesize syngas with a controlled ratio.
It is very challenging to design a catalyst that includes excellent ERC and normal HER properties. As it is well known, in addition to precious metals, transition metal oxides have had a significant breakthrough in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).17–22 Among them, Co3O4 has become quite attractive due to its advantages of an inexpensive price and natural abundance. In fact, Co3O4 not only exhibits excellent OER activities and stability in an electrolyte solution, but also relatively weakened HER catalysts for its low energy barrier due to the density of states.1 In addition, Co3O4 is a candidate for ERC performance,23,24 but it is subjected to the poor electrical conductivity of Co3O4 itself. Therefore, the ERC and HER activity of Co3O4 could be strengthened by incorporating other metals with better conductivity, which could facilitate the promotion of the catalytic activities. As a kind of coordination polymer, the metal–organic framework (MOF) has developed rapidly in the past ten years with application prospects in catalysis, energy storage and separation.25–30 Due to the porous characteristics and the periodicity structure of MOFs, MOF materials are used as ideal sacrificial templates or precursors to prepare porous metal oxides.31–33 Co3O4 materials could often be prepared by the Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) as precursors.34,35 This is because the resulting Co3O4 can retain the initial characteristics of the precursor ZIF-67, which is desirable for the maintenance of the electrochemical performance.
It is well known that the electrical conductivity of CO3O4 is poor compared with the metal itself. Thus, precious metals such as Au and Ag have been introduced to enhance the selectivity to CO, and also increase the electrical conductivity of the CO3O4 materials.36–38 Therefore, Au nanoparticles were modified with CO3O4 materials to improve the conductivity performance and ensure the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Herein, we report a facile and scalable method to synthesize Au@Co3O4 nanowire arrays (NAs) on a flexible Cu foam substrate (Scheme 1) with ZIF-67 NAs as the precursor via a hydrothermal method. The prepared Co3O4 NAs were then immersed in a HAuCl4 solution to obtain the Au@Co3O4 NAs. The catalytic activity indicates that the Au@Co3O4 NAs have an excellent catalytic effect on the CO2 conversion to syngas and a good catalytic influence on OER, demonstrating that the loaded Au serves as a conductive network to promote the rate of electron transport.

Experimental
Materials
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Aladdin, ≥99%), urea (CO(NH2)2, Aladdin, ≥99%), ammonium fluoride (NH4F, Aladdin, ≥98%), gold chloride hydrate (HAuCl4·xH2O, Aladdin, Au ≥ 47.5%), 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM, Aladdin, ≥98%), ethanol (C2H6O, Sinopharm Chemical, ≥99.7%), pyrrole (Py, Aladdin, ≥99.7%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, Aladdin, ≥99%), and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, Aladdin, ≥99.8%) were used as received. Cu foam was used as the substrate with a thickness of 1.0 mm (areal density: ∼ 550 g m−2). All standard electrolyte solutions were prepared with Milli-Q Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm, 25 °C).
Synthesis of the Co(OH)2 NAs on Cu foam
The Cu foam was sonicated in 3 M HCl for about 30 min to remove the copper oxide layer on the surface, which was subsequently rinsed with water and ethanol, and then dried in air. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (2.86 mmol), NH4F (5.79 mmol) and CO(NH2)2 (14 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL H2O. After stirring for 3 min, the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (25 mL). A piece of Cu foam (1 × 2 cm2) was immersed into the resultant solution, and then the autoclave was sealed and maintained at 120 °C for 9 h in an oven. After that, the autoclave cooled to room temperature, and the resulting Co(OH)2 nanoarrays were rinsed with water at least 3 times and then dried in air.
Preparation of the beaded ZIF-67 NAs on Cu foam
2-MIM (20 mmol) was dissolved in an aqueous mixture of 5 mL water and 5 mL ethanol. The Co(OH)2 NAs were immersed in an autoclave containing the solution, sealed and maintained 85 °C for 12 h, and then allowed to cool down to room temperature. Finally, the resulting product (ZIF-67 beaded NAs) was washed with water and then dried under air overnight.
Preparation of the beaded Co3O4 NAs electrode
Beaded Co3O4 NAs were synthesized by annealing the beaded ZIF-67 NAs in air at 350 °C for 4 h in a Muffle furnace at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1, and naturally cooled to room temperature.
Preparation of the beaded Au@Co3O4 NAs electrode
0.1 mL of pyrrole was added to 30 mL of ethanol, stirring vigorously for 10 min. The beaded Co3O4 NAs were first introduced into the pyrrole solution for about 12 h and then dried. The prepared samples were immersed in HAuCl4 (0.2 g L−1) solution overnight in the dark to obtain the beaded Au@Co3O4 NAs.
Physicochemical characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on the Hitachi SU-70 and JME-2100, respectively. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained on an Escalab 250Xi (Thermo Scientific, USA) instrument equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray radiation source. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected on an ASAP 2420 (Micromeritics, USA).
Electrochemical characterization

Evaluation of ERC. 
The electrochemical measurements were performed under a three-electrode system with 0.1 M KHCO3 solution, and the corresponding data were collected on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (ChenHua, Shanghai). The as-synthesized Au@Co3O4 beaded NAs grown on Cu foam with a geometric area of 1 × 1 cm2 were used as the working electrode, and a carbon rod and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) acted as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. All measured potentials vs. SCE were referred to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with the Nernst equation: ERHE = ESCE + 0.059 × pH + 0.2415 V. Before electrolysis, the electrolyte was bubbled with CO2 gas for at least 40 minutes. The concentration of the CO product was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-2060). The gas products were analyzed by FID (flame ionization detector) for CO. Assuming that two electrons are required to produce a molecule of CO, the faradaic efficiency (FE) was calculated as follows: FE = 2F × n(CO)/Q = 2F × n(CO)/(I × t), where F = 96485 C mol−1.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were recorded in a frequency range from 105 kHz to 10−2 Hz. The controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) curve was measured at an applied potential in an airtight glass cell, which was used to evaluate the stability of the electrode and the faradaic efficiency. Before the electrolysis test, the electrolyte was bubbled with CO2 for at least 40 min. During the CPE measurement, the amount of gas product was quantified through a gas chromatography (GC) approach (TCD and FID detector). The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was calculated by the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) with the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves. Various scan rates of CVs (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mV s−1) were measured in the non-faradaic potential region range from −0.20 to −0.40 V vs. RHE, which can determine the Cdl.


Evaluation of OER. 
The electrochemical measurement for OER was similar to the ERC with a standard three-electrode system in 1.0 M KOH, and the Hg/HgO electrode and a Pt foil were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The as-prepared Au@Co3O4 NAs were used as the working electrode with a working surface area of 1 × 1 cm2. All measured potentials vs. Hg/HgO were referred to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with the Nernst equation: ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.059 × pH + 0.098 V. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was recorded with the scan rate of 1 mV s−1 for the polarization curves. The Tafel slope was calculated via Tafel equation as follows:η = b log j + awhere η is the overpotential, b denotes the Tafel slope, j represents the current density, and a is the constant. The overpotential (η) for the OER is η = ERHE − 1.23 V, taking into account the O2/H2O equilibrium at 1.23 V vs. RHE.
The chronopotentiometry (CP) measurement was collected at 50 mA cm−2, and the CPE curve was measured at an applied potential of 1.61 V vs. RHE, which was used to evaluate the stability of the electrode. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was evaluated by measuring the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which was calculated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves. Various scan rates of CVs (2, 5, 8, 10 and 20 mV s−1) were measured in the non-faradaic potential region range from 1.01 to 1.11 V vs. RHE, which can determine the Cdl.

Results and discussion
The synthetic strategy of the beaded Au@Co3O4 NAs is shown in Scheme 1. The Co(OH)2 NAs were synthesized at 120 °C via a facile hydrothermal method, and were then reacted with 2-MIM at 85 °C to prepare the beaded ZIF-67 NAs on the Cu foam. Then, the unique beaded ZIF-67 nanowire arrays were calcined to prepare the Co3O4 NAs after an annealing treatment. Pyrrole was used as a weak reductive agent to reduce HAuCl4 to Au nanoparticles, and the pyrrole monomer was polycondensed to form polypyrrole. Furthermore, the introduction of pyrrole could also protect the Au particles from agglomeration to uniformly decorate around the surface of Co3O4 in the Au@Co3O4 NAs.
The PXRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1. Due to the presence of the Cu foam substrate, the obvious diffractions peaks at ∼43.3° and 50.4° belong to the (111) and (200) planes of Cu, respectively. The diffraction peaks at ∼31.3°, ∼36.8° and 44.8° should contribute to the (220), (311) and (400) crystal planes of the cubic crystallite Co3O4. Furthermore, the characteristic peaks of ∼38.1° and ∼44.4° could be assigned to the (111) and (200) planes of Au, respectively. Because of the strong intensity of the Cu foam substrate, the other diffraction peaks exhibited the relatively weak diffraction signal. The PXRD patterns of Co(OH)2, ZIF-67 and Co3O4 are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S3).

As shown in Fig. 2a, the Co(OH)2 nanowires are uniformly and densely arranged on the Cu foam substrate, and the arrangement orientation of the Co(OH)2 nanowires are very favorable for the subsequent growth of ZIF-67 polyhedrons. In fact, the ZIF-67 polyhedrons grew well on the Co(OH)2 nanowires with a uniform size of 0.4 μm to 1 μm for the polyhedrons, which look like a string of beads (Fig. 2b). After high temperature calcinations, the surface morphology of the resulting Co3O4 NAs derived from ZIF-67 has remained virtually unchanged, and kept the similar pristine polyhedron shape with the ZIF-67 precursor. The sole difference between Co3O4 and ZIF-67 is that the polyhedron surface of Co3O4 seems to increase the roughness and collapsibility due to shrinkage during an annealing process (Fig. 2c). The SEM image of the Au@Co3O4 NAs (Fig. 2d) is in accordance with that of the Co3O4 NAs, indicating that the morphology of the Au@Co3O4 NA remained after immersion in the HAuCl4 solution. In order to further confirm the content of Au@Co3O4, the EDX spectrum of Au@Co3O4 NAs confirmed the presence of the Au, Co and O elements (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). All results indicate that Au and Co3O4 co-existed in the Au@Co3O4 NAs.

From the TEM image of Au@Co3O4 NAs (Fig. 3a), the morphology of the string of beads was broken via the ultrasonic process during the course of the TEM preparation, and only the morphology of the nanowires remained. The Au particles were well dispersed with darker spots in Fig. 3b, and the diameter was approximately 8–10 nm. The HRTEM image revealed a clear lattice spacing of 0.466 nm, corresponding to the distance of the (111) crystal plane of the cubic-phase Co3O4. In addition, the lattice fringe was found to be around 0.235 nm from the image of Fig. 3c, which corresponds to the (111) crystal plane of Au. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns showed multiple diffraction circles, indicating that the as-synthesized Au@Co3O4 NAs exhibited polycrystalline features (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping demonstrated the distributions of the Co, O, and Au species via scanning TEM, which also confirmed the contents of the Au@Co3O4 NAs (Fig. 4). The corresponding TEM and HRTEM images of Co3O4 NAs are presented in the ESI† (Fig. S6). The N2 adsorption isotherms show a typical type IV sorption curves with a typical H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of mesoporous structures.39 The BET specific surface area of the ZIF-67 NAs with 504.0 m2 g−1 is higher than that of the Au@Co3O4 NAs with 74.4 m2 g−1 (in the ESI†, Fig. S7 and S8).

XPS measurements were further performed to confirm the chemical bonding states for Au@Co3O4. The full XPS spectrum is shown in Fig. 5a, which confirmed the existence of the Au, Co and O elements. As shown in Fig. 5b, a couple of peaks located at 84.0 and 87.4 eV corresponded to Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2, respectively. These peak locations are the typical values for the Au0 species. The XPS spectrum of Co 2p contains two main broad peaks at 779.4 and 794.8 eV that correspond to Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2, respectively, and several shakeup satellites (Fig. 5c). It was observed that the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 peaks of Co 2p could be deconvoluted into four peaks. The peaks at 779.5 and 793.8 eV belonged to Co3+, whereas 780.8 and 796.3 eV corresponded to Co2+.40 In addition, there is a spin–orbit splitting of 15.4 eV between the binding energies of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, which is significantly different from Co 2p in Co2O3 and CoO.41 In Fig. 5d, the fitting peaks with the binding energies of 529.5 and 531.1 eV are attributed to oxygen in the cobalt oxide compound and a residual oxygen-containing group (such as –OH).42 These results indicate that the as-prepared catalyst is Au@Co3O4, in accordance with the analysis of the XRD measurement. For comparison, the full XPS spectrum of the pure Co3O4 NAs is present in the ESI† (Fig. S9).

The electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction to CO was measured with a three-electrode system in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3, and the pH of the electrolyte solution is 6.8. The production of gas was analyzed via gas chromatography with an FID detector for CO and TCD detector for H2, and the liquid production was characterized by a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR). In order to investigate the catalytic activity of CO2 to CO, the Co3O4 NAs and Cu foam substrate were also compared with the Au@Co3O4 NAs. As shown in Fig. 6, the current density, CO partial current density and H2 partial current density of the Co3O4 NAs and Au@Co3O4 NAs all exhibited an obvious increase with growing potential compared with the Cu foam substrate. It was easy to see that the Au@Co3O4 NAs showed the highest current density and CO partial current density at different applied potentials, and its catalytic performance was greater than that of the Co3O4 NAs.
 Fig. 6  (a) Current density, (b) CO partial current density, and (c) H2 partial current density of the Au@Co3O4 NAs, Co3O4 NAs, and blank Cu foam. 
Based on the LSV curve of the CO partial current density, the controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) was performed at the potential range from −1.2 V to −2.0 V vs. SCE (Fig. S10 to S12 in ESI†). After electrolysis for 1800 s, no liquid products could be detected by NMR spectroscopy. Only a gas product mixture of CO and H2 could be produced. The ratio of all reduction products is presented in Fig. 7a. Judging from the curves of the faradaic efficiency (FE), the trends of the Co3O4 NAs is really similar to that of Au@Co3O4 NAs toward to the FE of H2 and CO. The only exception is the outstanding activity of the CO2 reduction to CO for the Au@Co3O4 NAs compared to that of the Co3O4 NAs. For the Cu foam, the maximum FE of CO was 5.1% at −1.6 V vs. SCE, and the corresponding FE value also decreased with the potential shift towards more positive or negative potentials. The Co3O4 NAs were found to exhibit a maximum FE of CO at 26.7%, and the minimal FE of H2 was 70.1% at a potential of −1.2 V vs. SCE. The minimal FE of CO was only 11.75% at −1.8 V vs. SCE, and the maximum FE of H2 was 85.3%. Compared with the Co3O4 NAs, the Au@Co3O4 NAs exhibited a significantly higher catalytic selectivity for CO. The minimal FE of CO was 21.7% at −1.4 V vs. SCE, and the maximum value was 47.65%. Interestingly, with the increasing potential from −1.2 V, −1.3 V to −1.4 V vs. SCE, the FE ratio of H2/CO also changed with 2:1, 3:1 to 4:1, respectively. The corresponding ratio of syngas could be met for synthetic ammonia and methanol. The potential continued to increase from −1.6 V to −1.8 V vs. SCE, and the FE ratio of H2/CO remained more or less stable at about 2:1. When the potential increased to −2.0 V vs. SCE, the FE ratio of H2/CO was about 1:1, which is suitable for the hydroformylation of alkenes to aldehydes. Combined with the above data, the Au@Co3O4 NAs exhibited remarkable catalytic activity of ERC compared with Co3O4 NAs. This could improve the catalytic efficiency of CO, and also control the H2/CO ratio of 1:1 to 4:1. According to the reported references,43 the catalytic activity of the Au nanoparticles depends mainly on the size of the Au nanoparticle. As the size of the nanoparticles decreases, the faradaic selectivity to CO decreases. Based on the preparation method of loading the Au nanoparticles and the diameter of the Au nanoparticles being approximately 8–10 nm, it can be speculated that the high dispersion of the Au nanoparticles in the Au@Co3O4 NAs could greatly expose the catalytic active sites. Furthermore, compared with other works,44–47 Au@Co3O4 NAs can be specifically tuned in the potential window from −1.2 V to −2.0 V vs. SCE for different H2/CO ratios from 1:1 to 4:1, which could be used as an intermediate for the production of higher alcohols, methanol, ammonia and other products.

(b) Nyquist plots of the Au@Co3O4 NAs and Co3O4 NAs recorded at −1.3 V vs. SCE in a CO2 saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an AC voltage of 5 mV. (c) The capacitive current density measured at −1.3 V vs. RHE as a function of the scan rate. (d) The long-time stability test of the Au@Co3O4 NAs at −1.6 V vs. SCE, and the corresponding FEs of CO and H2. 
The EIS measurement was also carried out and the Nyquist plot was fitted (Fig. 7b), wherein Rs and Rct represent the electrolyte resistance and the charge transfer resistance, respectively, and CPE is the constant-phase element. The Rs of the Au@Co3O4 NAs was lower than that of the Co3O4 NAs due to the conductivity enhancement of the Au introduction, which could decrease the contact resistance at the active material/current collector interface. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) for the Au@Co3O4 NAs was 33.72 Ω, which is also smaller than that of the Co3O4 NAs (36.32 Ω). This indicates a faster charge transfer rate and higher electrical conductivity for the Au@Co3O4 NAs. In addition, to further evaluate the performance of the catalyst, the ECSA of solid–electrolyte interface was determined by the equation, ECSA = Cdl/Cs, where Cdl was measured via CV curves with the potential range from −0.20 to −0.40 V vs. RHE in the non-faradaic region (Fig. S13 and S14). The Cdl for the Au@Co3O4 NAs and Co3O4 NAs was calculated as 8.87 and 7.11 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. 7c). This corresponded to ECSA values of 221.75 cm2 and 177.75 cm2 for the Au@Co3O4 NAs and Co3O4 NAs, respectively. These values indicated that with a larger surface area and exposure to more active sites, the electrocatalytic activity would correspondingly be higher. The stability of the Au@Co3O4 NAs was carried out at the applied potential of −1.6 V vs. SCE in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 (Fig. 7d). The gas production was recorded with three points in the initial and final stages of the stability test. The corresponding FECO and FEH2 were kept in the range of the error bar, suggesting a good sustainability of the Au@Co3O4 NAs for ERC catalysis. The morphology stability of the Au@Co3O4 NAs was confirmed via SEM after 15 h of electrolysis, and is shown in the ESI† (Fig. S4).
The electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared Au@Co3O4 NAs towards OER was also investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 1.0 M KOH solution with iR correction at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 8a. The Au@Co3O4 NAs exhibited excellent catalytic activity with the lower overpotential of 320 mV at 50 mA cm−2, while the current density was only 8.2 mA cm−2 for the Co3O4 NAs at the fixed potential of 1.55 V vs. RHE. It is obvious that the onset potential of the Au@Co3O4 NAs was less than that of Co3O4 NAs (400 mV). It was also lower than other reported hierarchically structured Co3O448 and hollow polyhedrons Co3O4.49 This result indicates that the construction of the hybrid Au@Co3O4 NAs may provide a promising strategy for improving the catalytic performance compared with the pure Co3O4 electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the Tafel slope, as key parameters, can be used to evaluate the kinetics of the OER, which is exhibited in Fig. 8b. The Tafel slope of the Au@Co3O4 NAs was 75 mV dec−1, which is significantly smaller than that of the Co3O4 NAs (91 mV dec−1), suggesting that the Au@Co3O4 NAs has more favorable reaction kinetics than Co3O4 NAs.

The electrical conductivity enhancement for the incorporated Au nanoparticles and the charge transfer abilities in catalysis were demonstrated by EIS measurement. As shown in Fig. 8c, the Au@Co3O4 NAs showed a smaller Rct (0.87 Ω) than Co3O4 NAs (1.90 Ω), suggesting superior charge transfer kinetics and higher electrical conductivity for the Au@Co3O4 NAs in OER. The Cdl of the Au@Co3O4 NAs and Co3O4 NAs was calculated as 133.9 and 46.7 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. 8d), and the corresponding ECSA was 3347.5 and 1167.5 cm2, respectively (Fig. S15 and S16). According to the above data, the Au@Co3O4 NA has excellent electrocatalytic activity, which is derived from its unique structure. Its electrical conductivity was also improved due to the doping of the Au particles.
The long-term stability is essential to evaluate the performance of OER. The chronopotentiometry (CP) of the Au@Co3O4 NAs and Co3O4 NAs was carried out at a constant current density of 50 mA cm−2 over 15 h (Fig. S17, ESI†). During the electrolysis process, the Au@Co3O4 NAs remained stable at the current density, whereas the Co3O4 NAs had a slight fluctuation in the last few hours. Furthermore, the outstanding stability of the Au@Co3O4 NAs was also proved by bulk electrolysis with 1.7 V vs. RHE, and the current density only increased by 3.8% after more than 15 h (Fig. S18, ESI†). The concentration of oxygen was tested in the electrolysis proceeding via Faraday efficiency measurement. The theoretical oxygen yield was obtained by the Faraday equation nO2 = Q/4F, and the charge Q was determined by the circuit. The amount of evolved O2 gas was determined by GC analysis with a faradaic efficiency of 96.4% (Fig. S19, ESI†).
In summary, the good electrocatalytic properties of the Au@Co3O4 NAs are attributed to the cooperation of the Au nanoparticles with the Co3O4 NAs. First, the introduction of the Au nanoparticles could reduce the electron density around Co in the Co3O4 NAs, which could be favorable for exposing more catalytically active sites. Second, the 3D composite structure of the Au@Co3O4 NAs could facilitate the delocalization of the Co–O bond and strengthen the catalytic activities. Furthermore, the doping of Au could optimize the adsorption Gibbs free energy of the intermediates in the catalytic process to improve the catalytic activity. In addition, the modification of Au on the surface of Co3O4 could prevent the Co3O4 NAs from being sintered during the catalytic process, which significantly facilitated the diffusion of electrons between the electrolyte solution and the electrode materials.
Conclusions
In summary, the Au@Co3O4 nanowire arrays exhibited ERC performance of syngas and OER performance, longtime durability and favorable kinetics in comparison to those of the pure Co3O4 nanowire arrays. The Au@Co3O4 NAs exhibits a tunable syngas ratio from 1:1 to 4:1 by controlling the potential. The OER performance of Au@Co3O4 NAs exhibited a low overpotential of 320 mV with a current density of 50 mA cm−2 and long durability. The improved performance can be attributed to the incorporation of Au particles, which led to the exposure of more active sites, increasing the strong structural stability and even enhancing the electric conductibility. Thus, the design and synthesis of such in situ growth bi-functional catalyst are expected to be used directly in the overall reaction (CO2 + H2O → CO + H2 + O2).
