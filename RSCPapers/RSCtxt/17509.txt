Broader context
The increasing global demand for energy requires new sources that can be exploited without the environmental impact of fossil fuels. The largest and most widely distributed source of energy on Earth is sunlight, whose intermittent nature requires efficient energy storage strategies before it can become a major source of energy to power the modern society. Although significant progress has been made in devising practical strategies of capturing and utilizing solar energy, such as photovoltaics to generate electricity, photocatalysis to produce chemical fuels and solar heating, progress in energy storage remains limited. This review analyzes one potential solution for solar energy storage based on the reversible photogeneration of highly strained molecules. Such a solar heat battery combines the capability for long-term energy storage (weeks or years), characteristic of conventional fuels such as CH4 or CH3OH, with closed-cycle operation in which no chemicals are released into the environment. In theory such batteries could have energy and power densities at least comparable to that of redox batteries and may be of particular value in meeting intermittent energy demands in distributed or mobile applications.

1. Introduction
Meeting the ever-increasing global demand for energy in a sustainable manner is arguably the greatest scientific challenge of our time. Answering this challenge requires considerable innovations in technology, which in turn require advances in the underlying basic science, particularly in capture, conversion, and storage of solar energy. Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of photocatalytic splitting of H2O to H2 and O2,1 of conversion of CO2 and H2O to CH3OH and O2 and similar endergonic transformations. This research receives widespread attention in the chemical and materials science literature. Here we will review and analyze another, so far relatively unexplored, strategy of storing solar energy by the photochemical generation of high-energy metastable compounds, whose subsequent thermal isomerization can release large amounts of heat. The sequence of photoisomerization followed by exothermic thermal isomerization can be repeated many times and represents a closed cycle of storing solar energy as high-energy chemical bonds. It offers unique attributes that make such a cycle a useful candidate for a mix of solutions for the capture, storage and utilization of solar energy.
Below we first highlight some of the general challenges of solar energy conversion and storage, and then present and analyze the potential and emerging chemical solutions. Particularly, we will discuss the molecular design of chromophores whose photochemical products can be safely stored for days or even months at room temperature but can also be triggered to revert back to the stable isomer releasing large amounts of heat. This strategy garnered considerable attention several decades ago but the fundamental problems, largely related to molecular design, proved to be insurmountable at that time to yield a practical solution. We argue that recent advances in understanding the effect of molecular strain on the thermal and photochemical reactivity of small molecules offer an opportunity to approach the problem of designing closed-cycle solar fuels systematically. We also define the photophysical and chemical properties of a photochromic material needed to yield a practical solar thermal cell and speculate that a photochromic pair of isomers with the combination of such properties likely exists. Because the purpose of this review is to highlight a strategy of solar-energy storage that may have been overlooked by most chemists, the references in the text are necessarily selective rather than exhaustive.
2. Powered by the sun
The most recent projections indicate that the annual global energy demand will increase from ∼520 EJ (∼17 TW annually averaged consumption rate) in 2007 to ∼780 EJ (∼25 TW) in 2035.2 In the United States the transportation sector, powered primarily by liquid fuels, is projected to continue to be the largest consumer of energy, growing from ∼29 EJ (29% of total domestic energy consumption) in 2009 to ∼33 EJ (28%) in 2035.3 In Europe and Asia, energy use in transportation will increase from ∼27 EJ (19%) and ∼24 EJ (14%) in 2007 to ∼28 EJ (18%) and ∼51 EJ (15%) in 2035, respectively.2 The energy consumed by households excluding transportation accounted for 14% of the global energy demand in 2007 and is projected to grow by 1.1% annually to 2035.2 The majority of the growth in global energy demand will come from developing countries.4 The economically, politically and societally acceptable solutions to meet this increase in energy demand are determined largely by three factors:
(1). the near doubling of the worldwide number of energy users by mid-century,
(2). the present (and presumably continuing) lack of large-scale (legacy) energy infrastructure in the areas that are expected to experience the largest increase of energy users5 and.
(3). the effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on climate and the concomitant need to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 50% (or more) by 2050 compared to the 2000 levels to avoid potentially catastrophic climate changes.6,7
The last consideration suggests that the proportion of renewable and non–CO2–emitting (e.g., wind, hydropower and nuclear) sources of energy should represent at least 38% of the energy makeup by 2035.4 In the OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development) countries, new energy generating and distributing technologies compatible with the large energy grid systems would benefit from economies of scale, while those technologies that are incompatible with the legacy systems (e.g., high-voltage constant-current transmission) may be hindered. In less affluent countries, the lack of investment funds rather than the institutional inertia of the legacy infrastructures may be a particularly strong barrier to adoption of new forms of energy storage and conversion.8
The competing and diverse demands for energy will likely be met by an array of carbon-neutral technologies each optimized for its own technological niche. Sunlight is by far the most abundant carbon-neutral energy source available on Earth, delivering 430 EJ of energy each hour (∼120 PW), more than the annual global energy consumption in 2001 (410 EJ, average rate of 13 TW).9 Though humanity has always relied on solar energy stored by natural photosynthesis as biomass and fossil fuels to satisfy its energy needs, photosynthesis alone will not be sufficient to continue doing so. The increasing atmospheric levels of CO2 since the beginning of the industrial revolution indicate that we consume photosynthetically stored sunlight faster than the biosphere captures it as C–H and C–C bonds.
Photosynthesis-bypassing strategies of converting sunlight into forms of energy suitable for storage, distribution and terminal use include photovoltaic (conversion to electrostatic gradients, Fig. 1A),10 photothermal (conversion to thermal gradients suitable to drive heat engines or high-temperature chemical reactions, Fig. 1B and C),11–15 and photocatalytic (conversion to electrochemical gradients, e.g., synthesis of CH4 or CH3OH from CO2 and H2O, of H2 from H2O or of Li from Li2O2 or Li2CO3). Of the three methods, photocatalytic or photothermal generation of high-energy chemicals (chemical fuels) in theory provides a means of storing solar energy with the highest energy density and longest lifetime, which is particularly important for mobile applications (e.g., transportation) and point-of-use power generation off established distribution grids (e.g., in developing countries or locations in developed countries where grid distribution has been interrupted).
 Fig. 1  Existing technologies to convert sunlight into electricity on large scales include the use of arrays of photovoltaic cells (A) to do so directly and the use of parabolic troughs (B, courtesy of DOE/NREL) or fields of sun-tracking reflectors (C) to concentrate sunlight on pipes containing heat-transfer fluids to drive steam turbines. 
This review focuses on a strategy for converting solar energy into chemical potentials for use in solar thermal batteries, i.e., on the design of molecules to allow the closed-cycle storage of solar energy as enthalpy of a chemical reaction (Fig. 2A). A solar thermal battery exchanges energy with its environment but not matter, absorbing photons during charging and releasing only heat during discharge. In contrast, conventional fuels (either produced with input of solar energy or extracted from geologic deposits) must be burned (or in certain cases reacted with water14) to extract free energy, consuming O2 and producing CO2 and/or H2O (Fig. 2B). A major objective in developing solar thermal batteries is to exceed what is thought to be a fundamental limit on energy and power density of conventional redox batteries, while improving the number of charge/discharge cycles, energy conversion efficiency, shelf-life of the charged state and/or usability and recyclability. If suitable molecules can be designed and synthesized, the corresponding batteries would provide means for the portable, non-CO2-emitting storage of solar energy particularly suited for mobile and off-grid applications.
 Fig. 2  General energy storage/release cycles for closed-system (A) and open-system (B) solar fuels. (A) The precursor (stable isomer) for a closed-system solar fuel uses the energy of an absorbed photon to drive its endergonic, unimolecular photoisomerization into the fuel form (metastable isomer). Upon heating or exposure to a catalyst, the fuel thermally isomerizes back to the precursor form without exchanging any material with the environment, releasing the stored energy ΔGisomo which can be used to do work. (B) A catalyst absorbs the energy of multiple photons to drive the multi-step endergonic conversion of the fuel precursor (here, CO2 and H2O) into fuel (CH4). Though the necessary oxidant for combustion (O2) is also produced, it is generally instead pulled from the environment (air) during the combustion process, and the combustion products are generally released into the environment. The free energy released during combustion represents the maximum amount of work that the system may perform. 
The idea of closed-system solar thermal energy storage is old and much effort has been devoted to developing practical systems based on the norbornadiene/quadricyclane isomeric pair. In our opinion, the absence of a practical solar thermal battery is a failure of molecular design rather than evidence of the fundamental problem with the concept of storing energy as metastable molecules obtained by photoisomerization. Unlike the challenges in optimizing existing types of energy storage systems (e.g., redox batteries), which are more physical and engineering than chemical, and those of generating conventional fuels using solar energy, which are finding appropriate heterogeneous catalysts, the contemporary challenges in the development of portable solar thermal batteries are fundamentally chemical, particularly those of molecular design and exploiting the relationship between molecular strain and reactivity. Consequently, we speculate that it is the area of sustainable energy generation which can benefit particularly from the attention of synthetic, physical, materials and theoretical chemists.
3. Storage is essential
Utilization of any intermittent primary energy source, such as solar or wind, requires robust and efficient solutions for energy storage.1,16–18 Despite its enormous flux, solar radiation is locally an intermittent energy source with the local insolation and demand curves out of phase.9,16 Both closed-system and open-system schemes for solar energy storage are being considered.
Open-system solar energy storage typically consists of (1) hydrocarbons or their oxygenated derivatives synthesized from H2O and CO2 photocatalytically, (2) H2 from photochemical, photoelectrochemical or photothermal13,19,20 splitting of water or (3) alkali or alkaline-earth metals by electrolysis using photovoltaics, which can then be used in recyclable metal-air “batteries”. Energy densities of such fuels exceed those of other storage technologies by at least an order of magnitude, making them particularly well-suited for transportation, where demand is necessarily distributed and intermittent and the energy densities are paramount. Most solar fuels that release energy when oxidized (burned) are open-cycle, because the oxidation products (e.g., CO2 for all carbon-based fuels) are released permanently in the environment (see below).
In closed-system storage, only energy (but not matter) is exchanged between the environment and the energy-storing system. Examples of closed-system solar-energy storage schemes are pumped water or compressed air (mechanical storage) and rechargeable batteries or supercapacitors (electrochemical or electrostatic), with the energy coming typically from photovoltaics or photothermal sources. The primary drawback of most existing closed-system energy storage technologies, both mechanical and electrochemical,14,17 is their modest mass and/or volume energy densities (0.001–0.5 MJ kg−1). Technologies with the highest specific energy densities, such as overheated steam (up to 3 MJ kg−1), lithium ion batteries (up to 1 MJ kg−1), or reversible fuel cells, particularly high-temperature solid-oxide cells,20 either lack portability, are too costly for many applications and/or are not suitable for energy storage for longer than a week.14,16,20 The energy densities of most such technologies may be impossible to increase much further because of the fundamental limitations imposed by the physical properties of materials.16
Whereas the design of electrochemical batteries has attracted considerable attention, a complementary solution, solar thermal batteries based on the reversible photoisomerization of stable chromophores into highly strained isomers without changes in their chemical composition, has been comparatively little explored. In solar thermal batteries, the stored energy is released as heat when the strained isomer reverts to its stable analog in response to an external trigger. The development of chemistry for such solar thermal batteries presents unique challenges for chemists' abilities to control chemical reactivity through molecular design. We suggest that these challenges can only be met by critically reexamining the conventional ideas about the relationship between molecular strain and reactivity.
4. Open-system fuels
Conventional chemical fuels, such as gasoline or methane, are stable in the absence of O2 or another oxidant and release energy only upon oxidation (burning), with changes in the chemical composition. Because such fuels have been used extensively throughout human history, their chemistry is well studied. Efficient technologies and infrastructure exist to interconvert between various open-system chemical fuels on industrial scales (e.g., cracking, reforming, (de)hydrogenation, Fisher–Tropsch conversion) and to maximize the fraction of the free energy of their combustion that is converted to useful work, for example in driving a vehicle or a gas turbine. Liquid hydrocarbons and their partially oxygenated derivatives (e.g., methanol) possess unique advantages as fuels. They have high mass and volumetric energy densities (e.g., derived from standard enthalpies of combustion:21 22.7 MJ kg−1 or 17.9 MJ L−1 for CH3OH and 47.9 MJ kg−1 or 33.7 MJ L−1 for n-C8H18, the primary component of gasoline) and useful power densities (50–500 W kg−1).16 Hence they require only simple precautions for safe handling and storage and can be transported fairly cheaply. They are relatively non-toxic (for an 85 kg human, LD50 values for methanol and gasoline correspond ingesting ∼0.7 L and ∼1.6 L, respectively, compared to only 1.4 g of strychnine or 2 mg of ricin). The primary challenge of using such fuels to store solar energy is the development of efficient photocatalysts to convert CO2 and H2O to hydrocarbons or their derivatives. In other words, we know what chemicals make good open-system solar fuels and we know how to extract free energy out of them using an abundant and free oxidant (air), but we do not know how to synthesize them effectively using solar energy.22
The major drawback of carbon-based solar fuels is the release of CO2 upon combustion. Practical and economical non-biological conversion of CO2 to fuels likely requires a feedstock with concentrations of CO2 far higher than in ambient air. Consequently, CO2 released by the combustion of solar fuels in a vehicle or at other distributed points of use cannot be practically recaptured. Such capture and sequestration is easier to accomplish if solar fuels are burned at large stationary consumers of energy (e.g., power plants),23 but it is not clear how the use of solar fuels in such circumstances would be advantageous compared to direct photovoltaic or photothermal energy conversion, other than the improved capabilities for energy storage mentioned above. Therefore it seems that carbon-based solar fuels can decrease the CO2 burden of human technology at best by two-fold, by converting the output of a fossil-fuel burning centralized power plant with high-concentration CO2 to liquid hydrocarbons using solar energy. Once this solar fuel is consumed (in a mobile application), the CO2 is again released in the environment.
The combustion of H2 produces only H2O, making H2 potentially a carbon-neutral method of storing solar energy. Because of this and its very high specific energy density (142 MJ kg−1) the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier has attracted a huge amount of attention.19,24–29 In 2004, 50 million metric tons of H2 was produced worldwide, mostly from steam reforming of hydrocarbons, eqn (1), and the water-gas shift reaction, eqn (2). In nature H2 is produced by hydrogenases.30–32 The photochemical, photoelectrochemical and photothermal splitting of water on various semiconductors, catalyst-functionalized electrodes, or with molecular photocatalysts24,26,33 is intensely investigated as a method of carbon-neutral generation of H2. CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2(1) CO + H2O → CO2 + H2(2)
Under ambient conditions H2 is a gas with an impractically low volumetric energy density of 0.013 MJ L−1 (i.e., <0.01% that of gasoline). Its storage is a major challenge.34 Photosynthetic organisms store and distribute hydrogen generated in water splitting as reducing equivalents of large complex molecules, such as NADPH and NADH for short-term storage, or carbohydrates for long-term storage.35 One example of the technological use of small molecules as hydrogen carriers is the catalytic cycling between CO2 and H2 and formic acid (Fig. 3A).34,36 The reversible hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of organic compounds has also been considered as a method for storing and transporting hydrogen equivalents for use in automotive applications (Fig. 3B).37,38 Other methods of high-density hydrogen storage are hydrides39–41 (e.g., Fig. 3C) and physisorption42,43 or chemisorption44 in high-surface-area materials. All H2 storage methods require significant further development before they become practical.45
 Fig. 3  Examples of operation cycles for molecular H2 carriers: (A) the cycling of CO2 to carry H2 as formic acid;36 (B) a H2 storage and release cycle developed at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. using a catalytic hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and oxidation cycle of π-conjugated organics (here, fluorene);37,38 and (C) the release of H2 from ammonia borane and the regeneration of ammonia borane from the product polyborazylene (PB) using hydrazine in liquid ammonia.41 
In summary, liquid open-system solar fuels are convenient to distribute and use due to their high energy densities, but it is unclear how to synthesize them efficiently and whether they can be carbon-neutral forms of energy storage. Combustion of H2 releases no CO2, and H2 may be generated by photochemical, photoelectrochemical or photothermal19,46 water splitting with reasonable efficiency. However, the impractically low volumetric energy density of H2 under ambient conditions raises questions of whether it offers significant advantages over competing forms of solar energy storage, such as advanced batteries, for mobile applications or direct photovoltaics for stationary ones.
5. Solar heat batteries
As stated earlier in the review, we have a pretty good idea of what chemicals make good open-system fuels because we have used such chemicals for centuries. In solar thermal batteries, the exergonic reaction results in the rearrangement of chemical bonds without changes in the chemical composition of the molecule (i.e., the energy storing/releasing cycle involves isomerization). Beyond the obvious requirements that the metastable isomer be strained and the stable isomer absorb photons of useful wavelengths, no systematic knowledge yet exists to guide the design of closed-system fuels. The fundamental limit of the energy density of such fuels is not immediately clear, and neither is the achievable efficiency of photochemical energy conversion nor the relationships between the photoisomerization wavelength, the fraction of the photon energy stored in the metastable isomer and the half-life of this isomer. Thus, though the desired performance characteristics of a practical closed-system chemical fuel were articulated a long time ago,47–52 the geometric and electronic parameters of molecular chromophores required to realize these characteristics remain unknown.
The advantages of closed-system solar energy storage strategies over open-system complements are
(1). the elimination of oxidation products whose release may be detrimental to the environment,
(2). the potentially simple recycling of spent fuel at the point of use (e.g., a properly designed closed-system solar fuel may be regenerated simply by exposing the stable isomer to sunlight) and
(3). a greater tolerance to the cost of molecules used as fuel, which increases the flexibility in selecting the structural and electronic molecular parameters to yield fuel best suited for the intended application.
These advantages make solar thermal batteries potentially useful in mobile applications, for applications in areas lacking large legacy energy grids, including both developing countries and the remote areas of the developed countries, or areas where access to the existing grids has been temporarily interrupted, e.g., as a result of a natural disaster, war, terrorist attack or industrial accident. Scaled up, closed-system solar fuels offer a carbon-neutral means of storing large amounts of heat for long periods without significant heat dissipation due to thermal gradients.
A closed-system energy storage scheme can never match a conventional fuel in terms of mass and/or volume energy density, because energy-releasing (exergonic) reactions of conventional fuels draw O2 from the environment, whose mass and volume is usually not included in calculations of energy density. For specific applications, the unique advantages of closed-system energy storage systems can outweigh their intrinsically lower energy densities, and the smaller the gap between the energy densities of the open- and closed-systems, the wider use rechargeable batteries will find. The maximum practically attainable energy density of a chemical battery is determined by the relationship between the activation and standard free energies of the exergonic reaction. Very broadly, across identical mechanistic classes of chemical reactions, reactions accelerate as they become more favorable (i.e., the so-called free energy relationship between the standard free energy of a reaction, ΔGo, and its free energy of activation, ΔG‡, as established by the Leffler postulate53). For several mechanistic classes, Marcus theory adequately describes the quantitative relationship between ΔGo and ΔG‡. The theory predicts an inverted region, in which ΔG‡ increases as ΔGo decreases (becomes more exergonic).54 This inverted region is thought to enable the initial charge-separation step of photosynthesis. Several energy donor/acceptor pairs have been rationally designed to access the inverted region, but such a region has not been observed for any other reaction type, and no battery exists that exploits the inverted region to increase its energy density without sacrificing its self-discharge rate.
The fundamental limit of the specific energy density of a redox battery can be estimated as follows: the highest energy-density cathode (reductant) is metallic Li (14 MJ kg−1); presently the highest energy-density anode (oxidant) is probably Si (up to 10 MJ kg−1).55 A hypothetical mixture of metallic Li and Si in 4:1 molar ratio can release ∼13 MJ kg−1 upon complete conversion to Li4Si. In order for such a mixture to generate electromotive force (electrical current against opposing electrostatic potential), the cathode and anode need to be separated by an electrolyte. The ratio of the masses of the electrolyte and the electrodes is determined by the desired self-discharge rate, impedance, electrode kinetics, etc. Existing redox batteries have energy densities below 1 MJ kg−1 and it has been argued11 that further improvements in their energy densities are unlikely.
The highest energy-density molecule known to date is probably nitrocubane, whose calculated standard free energy of formation is 717 kJ mol−1.56 Based on this number, its standard (i.e., pure solid at 298 K and 1 atm) calculated specific energy density for decomposition to N2, H2O and CO is ∼31 MJ kg−1 or ∼46 MJ L−1. The standard energy densities of commercial monopropellants and explosives do not exceed half of this value, e.g., <12 MJ kg−1 for CH3NO2,21 9.4 MJ kg−1 for octogen (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine, HMX),57 9.5 MJ kg−1 for RDX (cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine)57 and 7.3 MJ kg−1 for the C(NO2)4 + 3N2H4 mixture (all values are for decomposition to CO, CO2, H2O and N2).21,58 Even conventional fuels fall in the same range when the mass of consumed O2 is included, e.g., <11 MJ kg−1 for n-octane and ∼16 MJ kg−1 for the discontinued high-energy aviation fuel based on boranes. Importantly, at least 35% of the standard free energy of these reactions is entropic, i.e., due to the generation of gases (CO2, CO, N2, steam). A reaction that is accompanied by large entropic changes (i.e., by large changes in molar volume) is unsuitable for use in a battery whose volume should remain constant throughout the charge/recharge cycle. Hence, it seems likely that the fundamental properties of chemical bonds limit the specific enthalpy density of an organic material to <10 MJ kg−1. The energy density of a solar battery based on single-photon photoisomerization is further limited by the shortest-wavelength solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface to <1.5 MJ kg−1. Finally, practical considerations may limit the energy density to <1 MJ kg−1 even for multiphoton isomerization reactions, as discussed below.
At Earth's surface, the intensity of light below ∼340 nm is probably too low to be of practical interest in energy capture (Fig. 4). In the absence of multiphoton absorption (which requires very high fluxes60), the 340 nm cut-off is equivalent to a maximum amount of energy that can be deposited per chromophore of 3.50 eV. A particle-in-a-box calculation suggests that a HOMO–LUMO gap of 3.5 eV requires a linear π system of a minimum of three conjugated CC bonds (i.e., a hexatriene, molecular weight 80 g mol−1). In practice, the smallest chromophore with significant absorbance at ∼340 nm we are aware of is NCCHCH–CHCHN(CH3)2.61,62 Indeed, among organic compounds, the longest wavelength of absorption increases almost linearly with the minimum molecular weight of a chromophore (Fig. 5A). Because vibronic coupling often extends useful absorption of chromophores to 40–50 nm longer wavelengths than λmax (Fig. 5B), the lightest chromophore that absorbs ambient solar light has a molecular weight of ∼130 to 150 g mol−1.

See Fig. 6 and Table 1 for the chemical structures. (B) A generic, vibrationally resolved electronic absorption spectrum (0 → 0, 0 → 1, etc. denote the initial and final vibrational states of each peak). The vibronic structure of UV-vis spectra of organic chromophores is often resolved only at temperatures <77 K; at room temperature transitions from vibrationally excited states on the S0 surface become sufficiently intense to result in broad unresolved absorption peaks. 
The standard free energy of isomerization of the stable isomer to its metastable analog, ΔGisomo, is the maximum energy that can be stored for any period of time per mole of chromophore (Fig. 6). ΔGisomo must satisfy eqn (3), where ΔGisom‡ is the activation free energy of isomerization of the stable to metastable isomer, ΔGrev‡ is the free energy of activation for thermal reversion of the metastable isomer to the stable isomer, τ1/2 is the time (in seconds) during which half of the stored energy is dissipated spontaneously (half-life), T is the storage temperature and kB, R and h are the Boltzmann, gas and Planck constants, respectively. Assuming a self-discharge rate at room temperature of 1% per week (τ1/2 = 4 × 107 s) and ΔGisom‡/NA = 3 eV (NA is the Avogadro number) gives a maximum specific energy density of 1.7 MJ kg−1 for a metastable isomer with molecular weight of 100 g mol−1. This density can be practically achieved only if the metastable isomer is transparent at the photoisomerization wavelength. Otherwise, irradiation of the stable isomer (i.e., of a discharged battery) can only yield a mixture of the two isomers whose ratio is determined by their molar absorptivities at the irradiation wavelength(s) and the photoisomerization quantum yields. (3)
 Fig. 6  Reduced-dimensionality energy surfaces of the singlet ground (S0) and first excited (S1) states of a hypothetical photochromic compound. The photochemical conversion of the stable to the metastable (fuel) isomers is indicated by the solid black arrows: upon photon absorption the stable isomer is excited to the S1 surface, followed by fast (femtoseconds) relaxation from the initial Franck–Condon configuration toward the S1 minimum. The molecule returns to the S0 surface through an S0/S1 seam (e.g., the minimum energy conical intersection MECI) within a few picoseconds after photon absorption. On the S0 surface, the molecule may return to the original stable isomer (unproductive relaxation, dashed black arrow) or form the metastable isomer (productive relaxation). The metastable isomer reverts to the stable analog thermally (solid red arrow) over the energy barrier of ΔGrev‡, which releases the stored energy, ΔGisomo. 
Experimental evidence suggests a broad correlation between the activation enthalpy (or free energy) of thermal isomerization and the photon energy needed to convert the stable isomer to the metastable analog (Fig. 7 and Table 1). Only a fraction of the known photochromic compounds appear to satisfy the two fundamental requirements for use in a solar thermal battery: photoisomerization with light >350 nm and the half-life of the metastable isomer, τ1/2 > 7 days at room temperature. Designing new chromophores that lie above the correlation curve in Fig. 7 at the left edge of the unshaded area is a major challenge for the development of practical solar batteries.

A practical limit on the energy density of a solar cell may be placed by the time, t, and/or the surface area, A, required to collect enough incident photon energy. Because of the broad correlations between λmax, ΔHrevo and the minimum molecular weight of the chromophores among the known organic compounds, the maximum energy density of a metastable isomer decreases as ∼λmax−2 (Fig. 8A), where λmax is the wavelength of the maximum absorptivity of the lowest-energy photoisomerization band. On the other hand, the number of photons reaching the Earth's surface decreases approximately exponentially with 1/λmax. Consequently, the product of the solar-radiation collection area and collection time, At, required to charge a cell increases faster than exponentially with its energy density (Fig. 8B). Under the best circumstances, charging an optimal solar cell containing 1 kg of a photochromic compound with an energy density of 0.1 MJ kg−1 that absorbs all light down to 800 nm and has a 100% quantum efficiency of generating the metastable isomer would require collecting all solar radiation from an area of 1 m2 for ∼600 s. The total amount of solar energy delivered during this time over this area is ∼350 kJ. Some of this energy is contained in rare short-wavelength photons, whose absorption by the chromophore would promote it to the higher excited states (S2,…). Such states rapidly relax to the S1 surface dissipating their excess energy as heat; more energy is dissipated as the excited chromophores relax to the metastable isomer in the ground electronic state.
 Fig. 8  (A) Maximum energy density, ED of a photochromic compound as a function of the longest wavelength of absorption, ED(λmax) < hcNA/(2.3λmax2–200λmax), where c is the speed of light, h is the Planck constant, NA is the Avogadro number (black line) and the integrated solar flux (the total number of photons with wavelength less than or equal to λ) reaching Earth surface (read line). (B) The relative best-case product of collection time and collection surface area as a function of the maximum energy density of an ideal photochromic compound that follows the molecular weight vs. λmax and ΔHrevovs. λmax trends in Fig. 6 and 7. 
In contrast, a similar cell with a 10-fold higher energy density (1 MJ kg−1) would be transparent to light above ∼350 nm, and would require a 100-fold greater At value, e.g., collecting light from 1 m2 for ∼15.5 h. A cell with 1.5 MJ kg−1 energy density would require increasing At by another factor of 104.
In practice, these numbers are likely to be considerably worse, because of the difficulty in achieving 100% quantum efficiency both at the molecular (i.e., no competing reactions) and bulk (i.e., no absorption of light by the metastable isomer) scales, the necessary parasitic losses (such as maintaining chemical and thermal homogeneity of the sample), partial reflection and absorption of light by the cell interface; fluctuations in solar flux, etc.
How important solar thermal batteries may ultimately be among the various solar-energy storage strategies may depend on developing fundamentally new types of chromophores, particularly maximizing the fraction of absorbed photon energy that is converted to the molecular strain energy. To do so, one needs to understand how strain affects the photoisomerization wavelength, its quantum yield and the barrier of reversion of the metastable isomer.
6. Developments to date
The potential for storing solar energy by reversible photoisomerizations was recognized in 190948 when the photodimerization of anthracene (Fig. 9A) was proposed for this purpose. Since the early 1970s, developments of the closed-system chemical storage of solar energy have been based on concerted (electrocyclic) conversion between double CC and single C–C bonds (Fig. 9B and C)52,81 and E/Z isomerizations of double NN50,82 (Fig. 9D) and CC83 bonds (Fig. 9E). More recently, certain organometallic photochromic compounds (Fig. 9F) have attracted attention. Inorganic photoreactions were considered in the 1960s but do not appear to be actively pursued any longer. So far the primary focus has been on maximizing the efficiency of energy conversion. As argued above, energy density rather than energy conversion efficiency may be of greater importance in determining the role of chemical solar thermal energy storage schemes.
 Fig. 9  Classes of chromophores previously studied as potential photothermal solar fuels: (A) anthracene/its dimer, (B) norbornadiene (NBD)/quadricyclane (QC), 1/2, (C) tricyclic/bishomocubane 3/4, (D) E/Z azobenzenes, (E) E/Z N,N′-dialkylindigos and (F) (fulvalene)tetracarbonyl-diruthenium. The metastable isomers are on the right. 
6.1 Electrocyclic reactions
The most extensively studied chemical reaction for the closed-system storage of solar energy is the photoisomerization of norbornadiene (NBD, 1) to quadricyclane (QC, 2), or their derivatives.52,81 Thermal reversion of QC to NBD has a standard enthalpy (−ΔHisomo) of −89 kJ mol−1,84 corresponding to a specific energy density of neat QC of ∼1 MJ kg−1, and an activation energy of 140 kJ mol−165 (corresponding to τ1/2 of 14 h at 140 °C85).
The S1 state of NBD is optically dark and may not be accessed by direct photon absorption.86 Weak absorption of NBD at ∼236 and ∼213 nm corresponds to a population of several valence and Rydberg states. QC appears within 500 fs after photon absorption by NDB and is thought to be formed through an S1/S0 conical intersection following rapid relaxation of the excited NBD from the initially generated higher-energy states. However, no computational studies of the mechanism have yet been reported.
Sensitized photoisomerization of NBD to QC is more efficient than the direct conversion and is thought to involve adiabatic NBD/QC isomerization on the T1 surface prior to relaxation of either isomer to the ground electronic state.81 Because NBD is transparent at wavelengths above 300 nm and has a singlet–triplet (S0–T1) gap of 257 kJ mol−1 (equivalent to the energy of ∼475 nm photons), useful triplet photosensitizers have to satisfy rather demanding conditions. Sensitizers with triplet–singlet gaps above ∼280 kJ mol−1 (such as aceto- or benzophenone) add to NBD in side reactions or participate in charge transfer, forming NBD cation radicals, which are prone to decomposition. Certain Cu complexes87 appear to be the longest-wavelength sensitizers (∼405 nm) capable of promoting photoisomerization of NBD, albeit with quantum yields on the order of 10−2.
Considerable effort has been devoted to increasing the absorption wavelength of NBD (which also decreases the singlet–triplet gap) by incorporating the NBD core in a conjugated system or decorating it with donor/acceptor (electron-withdrawing/electron-donating) substituents.52 Increasing the absorption wavelength is accompanied by a decrease of the activation energy of QC → NBD thermal reversion and of the quantum yield of the photoisomerization but also increases the photostability of NBD. For example, substituted NBD 7 was reported to photoisomerize to the QC isomer 8 upon irradiation at 510 nm with the QC isomer having lifetime of ∼9000 h at room temperature.66,88 The cycle could be repeated at least 103 times (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  A donor–acceptor substituted norbornadiene that has a long-wavelength absorption edge at 510 nm. 
Thermal reversion of QC to NBD is forbidden by orbital symmetry, which explains its high activation barrier despite large exergonicity. It is catalyzed by many transition metal complexes and surfaces,89 which probably allow the reaction to proceed through a formally triplet transition state. Heating donor–acceptor QCs, which have lower free energies of activation than unsubstituted QC, to 65–180 °C has also been used to initiate energy-releasing reversion of QC to NBD. Covalent attachment of the NBD chromophore and suitable sensitizers to inert polymers yielded energy-storage materials capable of storing between 44 and ∼90 kJ of solar energy per mole of the NBD chromophore, albeit at the expense of low energy and power densities and energy conversion efficiencies relative to neat NBD.
Other intramolecular electrocyclizations, such as the photochemical formation of bishomocubanes (Fig. 9C) and similar cage compounds, have been examined for solar energy storage. The photoisomerization 3 → 4 has moderate quantum yields (0.35–0.40) in various solvents at 330–380 nm.47 Similarly to QC, the reversion of 4 to 3 is catalyzed by transition metal complexes, but though its catalyst-free thermal reversion is even slower than that of QC (4 is inert up to nearly 300 °C), the amount of solar energy stored is less (ΔHisomo = 67 kJ mol−1).47 High thermal stability is advantageous for long-term storage, but may complicate triggering energy release. The Rh catalysts suitable for thermal 4 → 3 isomerization do not catalyze the analogous 10 → 9 reaction (Fig. 11A) even at elevated temperatures.47 Likewise, 12 could not be thermally converted to 11 without significant decomposition at the required high temperatures.90
 Fig. 11  Examples of photocyclizations with high quantum yields for forming cage compounds. 
Hexamethylprismane (HMP, 13)/hexamethyl Dewar benzene (HMDB, 14)/hexamethylbenzene (HMB, 15, Fig. 12)91 make up another extensively studied system potentially suitable for solar energy storage. The formation of HMDB and HMP from HMB is endothermic by ∼250 kJ mol−192 and >380 kJ mol−1,93–95 respectively (corresponding to mass energy densities of 1.5 and 2.3 MJ kg−1 for neat HMDB and HMP, respectively). Both HMP and HMDB are generated upon irradiation of dilute solutions of HMB at ∼204 nm,91,95 with oxidizing sensitizers being particularly effective in promoting the isomerization, presumably by a radical cation chain mechanism.96
 Fig. 12  The structures of hexamethylprismane (HMP, 13) and its Dewar (14), Kekulé (15) and Möbius (16) benzene analogs. Energy differences: 13, ref. 93–95; 14, ref. 92 and 93; 16, ref. 97. 
In the absence of sensitizers, the isomerization is thought to proceed through a high-energy S1/S0 conical intersection, which cannot be accessed from the Franck–Condon region on the S1 surface of HMB. However, the mechanism and energetics of photogeneration of Dewar benzene and prismane appear to have been relatively little-studied computationally.
The mechanism of thermal isomerization of HMP and HMDB to HMB remains a matter of controversy. Prismanes appear to convert to benzenes through the intermediacy of the Dewar benzene. The conversions of HMP to HMDB and HMDB to HMB are first order, with ΔHrev‡ = 138 kJ mol−1 and ΔSrev‡ = 21 J mol−1K−1 and ΔHrev‡ = 152 kJ mol−1 and ΔSrev‡ = 31 J mol−1K−1, respectively93 (slightly different activation parameters were also reported98,99); thermal isomerization of unsubstituted Dewar benzene proceeds with ΔHrev‡ = 105 kJ mol−1 and ΔSrev‡ = 3 J mol−1K−1.100 The Woodward–Hoffman rules of electrocyclic reactions suggest that the orbital symmetry-allowed concerted (conrotatory) dissociation of the central C–C bond in HMDB should produce one of the newly formed CC bonds close to the trans configuration (so-called Möbius benzene, 16, Fig. 12), which was thought to be “impossibly strained”.101 The alternative requires a biradical transition state. Recent reaction path computations on unsubstituted Dewar benzene at the CASSCF(10,10)/6-311G** level of theory found a concerted conrotatory (closed-shell) transition state that leads directly to benzene without the intermediacy of the Möbius isomer. The disrotatory (diradical) transition state leading to the Möbius isomer is 28 kJ mol−1 higher; the Möbius isomer must pass through another diradical transition state to convert to benzene.102 In certain substituted Dewar benzenes, the Möbius benzene derivatives appear as shallow intermediates connecting different transition states on the path to benzene.97 The kinetic stability of highly strained prismanes and Dewar benzenes can be ascribed to their conformational rigidity, which prevents biradical transition states from adopting geometries in which the relief of molecular strain would compensate for the uncoupling of an electron pair.
The isomerizations of QC to NBD, HMP to HMB and HMDB to HMB described above are fairly unique in their combination of high standard enthalpies (between −89 and −350 kJ mol−1), which would potentially allow high energy densities, and high free energies of activation to give useful thermal stabilities of the metastable isomers. However, the integration of these metastable hydrocarbons into practical solar-energy storing schemes is complicated by the need for UV light and/or sensitizers for their generation, their complex photoisomerization mechanisms, their difficult synthesis and the limited opportunities for tuning their absorption, standard enthalpies of reactions and reactivities through substitution. Other limitations of these reactions have been discussed elsewhere.49
6.2 Photoisomerization of double bonds
Adopting systems based on the photoisomerization of CC or NN bonds for solar-energy storage presents its own set of challenges. Donor–acceptor azobenzenes are produced industrially for use as dyes because they absorb visible light (e.g., λmax = 425 nm for 2,2′-dimethyl-4-(N,N-dimethylamino)-5′-nitroazobenzene).67,103,104 However, azobenzenes suffer from:
(1). low exothermicities of thermal isomerization of (Z)-azobenzenes to their E analogs82 (<50 kJ mol−1, corresponding to the energy densities <0.2 MJ kg−1 for pure Z azobenzenes)
(2). low free energies of activation of Z → E isomerization (between 91 and 110 kJ mol−1 in solution corresponding to half-lives of <250 h at room temperature)82 and
(3). difficulties in preparing samples containing pure Z isomers (photostationary states of azobenzenes typically contain <75% of the metastable Z isomer due to the modest ratio of the extinction coefficients of the two isomers at >400 nm).
No substitution pattern is known that significantly increases the activation barrier for Z → E isomerization above that of unsubstituted azobenzene.105 The mechanisms of E/Z photo- and thermal isomerization remain controversial. Isomerization may occur by rotation about the NN bond, by inversion of one of the N atoms or a combination of the two (concerted inversion,106–108Fig. 13). For thermal isomerization, the free volume of activation (V‡ = −RT(∂ln k/∂P)T) decreases from rotation to inversion and pressure-dependent thermal Z → E isomerization rates could help differentiate the mechanisms. The Z → E isomerization rates typically increase with pressure (i.e., V‡ < 0).109–112 In contrast, E → Z isomerization is suppressed in closely packed films113–115 and can in some cases cause bulk film deformation.116
 Fig. 13  The different mechanisms for photoisomerization of azobenzenes. 
The molecular mechanism of E → Z photoisomerization is further complicated by the existence of two photochemically active optical absorbance bands: the weaker symmetry-forbidden n–π* (S0 → S1) transition and the stronger, symmetry-allowed π–π* (S0 → S2) transition. The relative importance of various mechanisms may be quite sensitive to substitution and solvent.
Indigos (Fig. 9E and various derivatives carrying arene substituents) are industrially important dyes and have been considered for the chemical storage of solar energy. Many indigos have very low quantum yields of E/Z photoisomerization, presumably due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding117 (Fig. 14) which creates significant barriers for the necessary nuclear rearrangement of the singly excited isomer (S1 surface) from the Franck–Condon region to the S1/S0 conical intersection(s) (Fig. 6). Such hydrogen bonding is eliminated by alkylation of N, and N,N′-dialkylated indigos photoisomerize upon irradiation at >500 nm.83 Strong absorption at such long wavelengths has been attributed to significant distortions of the central CC bond in N,N-dimethylindigo due to steric repulsion of the α-C substituents.118 Although indigos are amenable to tuning their properties by substitution, they suffer from similar deficiencies as azobenzenes:50,119 low standard and activation free energies of Z → E isomerization (<34 kJ mol−1 and <100 kJ mol−1, respectively).83
 Fig. 14  Intramolecular hydrogen bonding in indigo prevents its photoisomerization. 
6.3 Organometallics
Finally, the potential of a series of organometallic photochromic complexes to form the basis of a solar thermal battery was recently evaluated computationally,120 extending previous experimental work.121,122 Irradiation of dilute solutions of FvRu2(CO)4 (5, Fig. 15) in THF at or above 350 nm produces a photostationary mixture containing 80 mol% of the strained anti isomer 6. Thermal reversion to 5 occurs in two steps with overall standard and activation energies of 83 ± 6 kJ mol−1 and 125 ± 8 kJ mol−1, respectively,120 corresponding to a maximum specific energy density of ∼0.2 MJ kg−1 and a self-discharge rate of ∼5% per year (at room temperature). The complex could be cycled at least 10 times without evidence of degradation.121 Quantum-chemical computations suggested that thermal reaction proceeds by a rate-determining coupling of the cyclopentadienyl ligands with simultaneous weakening of the Ru–C bonds, followed by rotation around the newly formed C–C bond and formation of the Ru–Ru bond to yield 5 (Fig. 15).
 Fig. 15  A calculated mechanism of thermal isomerization of an organometallic photochromic compound 6. 
A Ru complex is unlikely to be attractive for practical applications both because of its cost and large molecular weight (442 g mol−1), which decreases the specific energy density. Computations suggest that the Fe and Os analogs of 5 lack the favorable energy profile of the Ru system.120 However, this example suggests that organometallic complexes should be considered along with the conventional organic photochromic molecules as potential constituents of solar thermal batteries.
7. Whitherward?
Despite the large amount of work devoted to photochromic compounds, including those for solar thermal energy storage, the potential of this strategy relative to alternatives (e.g., electrochemical batteries) remains unclear. We ascribe the situation to the apparent lack of any systematic effort to design chromophores expressly to meet the minimum necessary and desired performance characteristics of a practical solar thermal fuel cell. So far any such effort has relied on the few basic photochromic pairs with large differences in the enthalpies of formation of the two isomers, supplemented by attempts to adjust the absorption properties of the stable isomer by substitution. Such a strategy is rather limiting: few known photochromic pairs show a large enough difference in the formation enthalpies of the two isomers, with the current examples being limited to [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of strained cyclic dienes or related hydrocarbons. Little is known about how to design new photochromic pairs de novo, often because of the complex and poorly understood photoisomerization mechanisms of the existing examples.
The alternative approach is (1) to identify a photochromic pair with suitable photophysical and spectrokinetic properties but potentially small difference in the formation enthalpies of the two isomers and (2) to adjust the structure of one of the isomers to maximize the standard free energy of thermal isomerization through molecular design. A starting point for such an approach is the expression of the performance characteristics of a solar thermal battery in terms of the molecular properties of its photochromic material. Below we attempt to do so and speculate about which questions may need to be answered first in any quest for a practical chemical solution to solar thermal energy storage.
The important performance parameters of a thermal battery include energy and power densities, energy conversion efficiency, self-discharge rate and cost per MJ of energy in addition to ease of use (both regeneration and discharge) and the probability and severity of catastrophic failure. Molecular properties of the isomeric pair (i.e., its chemical composition, thermodynamics, kinetics and photophysics; see Table 2) place fundamental upper limits on some of these parameters.

7.1 Energy density
The effect of molecular properties on the maximum specific energy density of a photochromic material was discussed earlier in the review. Limited solar flux at wavelengths below ∼340 nm at the Earth's surface places the upper limit on the energy that can be deposited into a chromophore at ∼3.5 eV. In theory this amount can be increased if absorption of one photon creates a sufficiently long-lived metastable intermediate that converts into an even higher-energy isomer upon absorption of another photon. One such case is the photodimerization of 2-cyanonaphthalene (17, Fig. 16A) to form the (presumably highly strained) cubane derivatives 18–20.123 The dimerization is a two-photon process proceeding through the intermediacy of a [4 + 4] adduct (22),124,125 though the standard enthalpy of isomerization for these compounds was not reported. In contrast to the photodimerization of anthracenes,126 many naphthalenes do not photodimerize in solution without supramolecular complex formation or even in the solid state.123,125 At present very few compounds are known to manifest stepwise photoisomerizations, and the standard enthalpy of isomerization between the least and most strained isomers may be only a small fraction of the energy of the two absorbed photons.127 Nonetheless, we are not aware of any physical laws that fundamentally prevent such a multi-photon, multi-step photoisomerization mechanism from being exploited for solar energy storage.
 Fig. 16  (A) The photodimerization of 2-cyanonaphthalene with λirrad > 280 nm results in a mixture of anti-head-to-head (18) and anti- and syn-head-to-tail (19 and 20) regioisomers of cubane derivatives, presumably by a two-step process involving a [4 + 4] intermediate.123 (B) The first step of the photodimerization of methyl 3-methoxy-2-naphthoate with λirrad > 280 nm requires the presence of a supramolecular template, γ-cyclodextrin, making the formation of the [4 + 4] intermediate 22 enantioselective; further irradiation (with or without γ-cyclodextrin present) subsequently affords a [2 + 2] photocycloaddition, yielding the cubane derivative 23.124,125 
Another strategy of maximizing the energy density of a solar thermal battery is to increase the fraction of the absorbed photon energy that is stored in the metastable isomer (Fig. 6). In many existing photochromic compounds for which kinetic data for thermal relaxation are available, the photon energy required to convert the stable isomer to its metastable analog is 2–3 times greater than the activation barrier separating the stable from the metastable isomer, ΔGisom‡. Because the standard free energy of isomerization of the metastable to the stable isomer, ΔGisomo, which is the energy stored per mole of chromophore, must be less than the activation barrier, ΔGisom‡ (ΔGisom‡ = ΔGisomo + ΔGrev‡), most photochromic compounds can store < 30% of absorbed photon energy.
In the simplest case, the rest of the photon energy can be separated into the energy gaps (1) on the S1 surface between the Franck–Condon configuration and the minimum–energy conical intersection (MECI) leading to the metastable conformer, E1, and (2) on the S0 surface, between the MECI and the transition state of thermal isomerization, E0. In theory the fraction of the photon energy that could be stored in the metastable isomer can be increased by bringing the geometry of the S0 transition state closer to that of the MECI and/or the MECI geometry closer to the Franck–Condon geometry, i.e., by redistributing the photon energy from E0 and E1 to ΔGisomo.
Calculated values of E1 (and its fraction of the vertical excitation energy in parentheses) vary from <42 kJ mol−1 (0.15) in azobenzene128 to ∼60–85 kJ mol−1 (0.17–0.25) in conjugated olefins, such as stilbene or rhodopsin 24,62,129 to ∼40 kJ mol−1 (0.3) in benzadithiophene, 26 (the S1 state is dark and the excitation to the S2 state is required for photoisomerization)130) and >330 kJ mol−1 (>0.5) in hypothetical tetrahydro-cyclopenta[a]pentalene, 28 (Fig. 17).131 The largest fraction of the absorbed photon energy is dissipated in the excited states in valence photoisomerization reactions, reactions in which the S1 state of the stable isomer is dark or photoisomerizations in which the MECI does not lead to the desired product (e.g., the formation of the Dewar benzene). We are not aware of any studies that have systematically explored how substituents of a chromophore affect the energy of the MECI relative to that of the excitation energy. Qualitatively, lowering E1 and hence the energy gradient along the reaction path on the S1 surface may also lower the quantum yield of the productive photoisomerization process by increasing the residence time of the electronically excited chromophore in the vicinity of the Franck–Condon configuration. This increase could promote relaxation of the excited chromophore to the stable instead of metastable isomer by several mechanisms, as illustrated by temperature- and viscosity-dependent quantum yield of E/Z photoisomerization of stilbene.132
 Fig. 17  Structures for which values of E1 have been calculated; structures not shown are defined elsewhere in the text. In 24 and 25, Rhodopsin represents the rest of the protein. 
Calculated values of the energy difference between the MECI and the transition state of thermal isomerization vary from ∼42 kJ mol−1 (0.2) in the rhodopsin/bathorhodopsin pair129,133 to ∼105 kJ mol−1 in olefins and azobenzenes to >167 kJ mol−1 in valence isomerization reactions. The T1–S0 energy gap probably vanishes at the geometries of biradical transition states, which are common in thermal isomerization of olefins, and increasing the corresponding activation energies at constant photoisomerization wavelength would have to be accompanied by a decrease in the T1–S1 gap as well.
The maximum energy density of a photochromic material is determined both by the standard free energy of metastable-to-stable conversion reaction and the fraction of the metastable isomer at the photostationary state, χm. Ideally, the photostationary state is composed of only the metastable isomer (χm = 1), which is only possible if at the photoisomerization wavelength the metastable isomer is either
(1). transparent, i.e., εs(λ)/εM(λ) → ∞, where εS and εM are the molar absorptivity of stable or metastable isomers, respectively or
(2). photochemically inactive, i.e., quantum yields of all its photochemical processes are zero.
The former is preferable because it corresponds to the maximum achievable photochemical energy conversion efficiency for a given excitation wavelength and activation energy of thermal relaxation. Reliable wavelength-dependent molar absorptivities of both isomers are available for only a few photochromic compounds. In most cases, the metastable conformer absorbs at longer wavelengths than the stable one (positive photochromism134) and consequently εS(λ)/εM(λ) = 0 for wavelengths above a certain threshold. However, because most molecules are relatively less transparent to shorter rather than longer wavelengths, the εS(λ)/εM(λ) ratio rarely exceeds 10 (Table 3 and Fig. 18). The notable exceptions are photocyclizations that lower the degree of conjugation. For example, the anthracene photodimer is transparent above ∼290 nm, whereas anthracene absorbs strongly (ε > 100 M−1 cm−1) up to ∼380 nm. Larger acenes manifest even greater differences: acenaphthylenes and naphthacenes absorb up to at least 450–500 nm, whereas their dimers are transparent above ∼350 nm. Azaacenes (e.g., acridizinium 44, Fig. 19) and phanes (e.g., 45) manifest similar trends.

 Fig. 18  Structures of the photochromic compounds described in Table 3. The metastable isomers are on the right. 
 Fig. 19  The parent structures of the N-heterocycle acridizinium (44) and a cyclophane (45). 
The dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene pair (Fig. 20) is an example of so-called “one-way” photochromism, i.e., dihydroazulene converts to vinylheptafulvene upon irradiation (with quantum yields of up to 1 for certain derivatives), whereas the reverse reaction can only be performed thermally. One-way photoisomerization of a stilbene dendrimer in H2O was also reported.139 In such “one-way” photochromism, significant absorption of incident light by the metastable isomer, even if it is not accompanied by photoisomerization, can result in photoheating of the battery, which may require active cooling during charging.
 Fig. 20  (A) The structures of dihydroazulene (46) and vinylheptafulvene (47), (B) the compounds used to model them (28 and 29) and (C) the model compounds' energy surfaces that dictate their interconversion. Modified from ref. 131. 
The mechanism of “one-way” photochromism has been studied computationally and is thought to result from the minimum-energy conical intersection lying below the transition state of thermal isomerization (on the electronic ground state energy surface) and/or having geometry close to one of the isomers (Fig. 20).
Quantum yields of photoisomerization are generally different for wavelengths corresponding to the reactant excitation to different excited states. Such wavelength-dependent quantum yields may result in the irradiation wavelength yielding a photostationary state of the maximum energy density being different from the irradiation wavelength corresponding to the highest conversion efficiency of solar energy. For example, the quantum yields of photoisomerization of (E)-azobenzene to the metastable Z isomer are ∼0.2 at λ < 320 nm (corresponding to S0 → S2 excitation) and ∼0.35 at λ > 400 nm (corresponding to S0 → S1 excitation). The maximum εE(λ)/εZ(λ) ratio of ∼8 is observed at ∼320 nm; at λ > 400 nm, the ratio is <4. Yet irradiation at >400 nm may be preferable, because it decreases photoheating and irreversible photobleaching due to side reactions.
7.2 Power density
Under isothermal discharge, the average power density delivered by a fully charged cell as it discharges, PD, is related to its energy density, ED, by eqn (4), where ΔHrev‡ and ΔSrev‡ are the standard enthalpy and entropy of activation of thermal isomerization of the metastable isomer, T is the temperature, and kB, h and R are the Boltzmann, Planck and gas constants, respectively. At 100 °C, a fully charged solar thermal battery would deliver initially up to 0.5 kW kg−1 of power. Its average specific power density over 50% discharge at the same temperature is 2ln 2 ≈ 1.4 times lower (∼0.3 kW kg−1). These values correspond to isothermal discharge, i.e., mixing (passive or active) is assumed to be efficient enough to dissipate any thermal (and hence concentration) gradients within the cell throughout its discharge fast relative to the total discharge time. If the temperature of the cell changes during discharge, power densities can be both lower and higher than the isothermal values cited above, because local heat fluxes depend approximately exponentially on local temperature (see below). The isothermal power densities are representative numbers and compare well to the maximum power density of Li ion batteries (0.1–1 kW kg−1).16 (4)
7.3 Explosion hazard
We are not aware of any published analysis of the potential of a catastrophic failure of a solar thermal battery. A charged battery of any kind is thermodynamically metastable and may spontaneously discharge if the energy-releasing chemical reaction is accelerated in some way (e.g., by adventitious catalyst). As discussed earlier, the only strategy to increase the specific energy density of a solar thermal cell above 1.5 MJ kg−1 is either to use light of shorter wavelengths than those reaching the Earth's surface or to rely on multi-photon isomerization reactions. Neither option seems plausible at present. At 1.5 MJ kg−1, the specific energy density of a solar thermal cell would be far less than that of conventional explosives (e.g., from standard enthalpies of combustion, TNT at ∼15 MJ kg−1,21,140 octogen at 9.4 MJ kg−157 and hexanitrobenzene at 7.4 MJ kg−1140) but comparable to that of NH4NO3 (∼0.9 MJ kg−1)140–142 and N2H4 (∼1.6 MJ kg−1),58,142 both of which are used as monopropellants. The fundamental difference between monopropellants (and chemical explosives) and photochromic molecules for potential solar-thermal cell use is the enthalpic vs. entropic contributions to their exergonicity. Monopropellants and chemical explosives are designed to decompose into gaseous products, i.e., their exergonicity has a substantial entropic component. In contrast, an isomerization reaction suitable for reversible solar energy storage should have a minimal entropic component.
The only mode of catastrophic failure of a solar heat battery that seems plausible to us is spontaneous heating due to a runaway reaction, i.e., a situation when the rate at which the reaction generates heat exceeds the rate at which this heat is dissipated to the environment. Because the rate of a thermal reaction increases exponentially with temperature, sufficiently high local heating may conceivably set up a propagating, self-accelerating reaction front. If the average cell temperature becomes sufficiently high, the cell may lose structural integrity, the photochromic material may degrade irreversibly and/or damage to property or living organisms may result.
We envision two limiting mechanisms which can set off a runaway reaction: (1) the cell is placed in an environment whose ambient temperature exceeds the thermal stability limit of the cell or (2) the ambient temperature is below this threshold value, but the reaction is initiated in a small volume of the cell, for example by an adventitious catalyst.
To get a semi-quantitative idea of the low limit of the thermal stability of a solar thermal cell, we modeled the time-dependent temperature of a spherical cell of radius ro (Fig. 21) initially at uniform temperature To placed in ambient environment of temperature Text. The dynamics of cooling of a sphere in air are described adequately by a heat equation even for very large Grashof numbers.143 Consequently, we solved simultaneously a generalized 1-dimensional heat equation (eqn (5)), where the first term describes heating due to the reaction, and a differential unimolecular rate law with mass transport (eqn (6)) with boundary conditions defined by eqn (8) and (9). In eqn (5)–(9), T(t, r) is the temperature of an infinitely thin shell r metres from the center of the cell at t seconds after the initiation event; χ(t, r) is the molar fraction of the metastable isomer at t and r (0 ≤ χ ≤ 1), ΔHrev‡ is the activation enthalpy of the exergonic reaction (we assume ΔSrev‡ ≈ 0 as discussed above), R is the gas constant, α is the thermal diffusivity of the photochromic material (−ro ≤ r ≤ ro) or of the surrounding medium (r < −ro, r > ro) and D is the effective diffusion coefficient of the photochromic material. Function a(r) is defined by eqn (7), where ED is the volumetric energy density of the fully charged battery, ρ and Cv are the density and constant-volume heat capacity of the photochromic material, respectively, and kB and h are the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively. Because the only source of heat is the reaction occurring within the cell, a = 0 outside of the cell. The encapsulation of the photochromic material is assumed to have negligible thickness and infinite thermal conductance. (5) (6) (7) T(0, −ro ≤ r ≤ ro) = To, T(0, r∉[−ro, ro]) = T(∞, r) = T(t, r∉[−rc, rc]) = Text(8) χ(0, −ro ≤ r ≤ ro) = 1, χ(t, r∉[−ro, ro]) = χ(∞, r) = 0(9)
 Fig. 21  The schematic of the solar thermal cell modeled. 
The boundary conditions, eqn (8) and (9), have the following physical meaning:
(1). Before the exergonic reaction is initiated, no temperature gradients exist inside or outside of the cell, although a temperature gradient may exist across the cell/environment boundary; the environment is assumed to be infinitely large so as to absorb all heat generated by the cell without changing the temperature at the ultimate thermal equilibrium (t = ∞), but its finite thermal conductivity allows transient heating of the environment in the vicinity of the cell above Text.
(2). The final state of the cell is the absence of thermal gradients across the system and of chemical gradients across the cell (i.e. complete conversion of the metastable isomer to the stable isomer).
We modeled heat exchange between the cell and the ambient air as convection within rc − ro meters from the surface of the cell, where rc is the distance corresponding to the Rayleigh number, Ra = 10. The environment beyond this range was assumed to remain at the ambient temperature. The value of rc was found self-consistently by eqn (10), where α, μ, ρ and γ are coefficients of thermal diffusivity, dynamic viscosity, density and thermal expansion of air under standard conditions, g is gravitational acceleration, T(t − dt, rc) is the temperature at the preceding temporal step of a simulation and | | signify absolute value. In our simulations, typical rc values during catastrophic heating were on the order of 1 cm. (10)
The results of this modeling are shown in Fig. 22, where the maximum sustained (over at least 1 s) surface temperatures of cells of different diameters are plotted against the ambient temperature. The threshold ambient temperature above which the cell is not stable is fairly insensitive to details of modeling of the heat exchange between the cell and the environment but the maximum sustained temperature is. We present the range of temperatures observed in simulations with somewhat different values of rc (extrapolated and properly scaled from the data in ref. 143 and 144). As expected, the smaller the cell, the higher ambient temperatures are required to set off catastrophic discharge, because larger surface-to-volume ratios of smaller cells facilitate passive cooling. Spherical cells <0.4 L in volume (ro < 10 cm) appear to be stable against catastrophic discharge at any practical storage temperature. The highest ambient temperature at which cell is stable decreases from >85 °C for the 0.4 L cell (ro = 10 cm) to ∼45 °C for the largest cell we modeled (∼42 L, ro = 100 cm). Running-average (100 s interval) surface temperatures of the 0.4 L and 42 L cells as a function of time since the cell was exposed to high external temperature (color coded on the graph) are illustrated in Fig. 23.
 Fig. 22  The maximum surface temperatures sustained for at least 1 s of solar thermal cells of varying radii (ro, cm) as a function of the ambient temperature, Text. A range of temperatures reflects different simulation parameters as described in the text. 
 Fig. 23  Deviation of the surface temperature (running average over 100 s), of 0.4-L (A) and 42-L (B) thermal cells from the ambient temperature, Text, as a function of time since exposure of the cell to the ambient temperature. 
Surface temperatures above 100 °C can result in injuries or damage to property but may not cause significant damage to the cell itself. Higher temperatures, however, which we estimate can remain above 200 °C for >100 s within larger cells (Fig. 23B), may result in decomposition of the photochromic material and the release of the material into the environment. Yet we tend to view these results as the “worst case” scenario because (1) a sphere has the lowest surface-to-volume ratio of any shape and hence is least amenable to passive cooling, (2) our simulations neglected convective mixing within the cell and probably underestimated the efficiency of convective cooling in air, and (3) the simulations are for a metastable isomer with the maximum attainable energy density using 1-photon chemistry and natural sunlight. We conclude that relatively small batteries (<100 mL) in different shapes would probably not be susceptible to catastrophic discharge and hence would be as practical as conventional redox batteries.
7.4 Stability, life cycles and cost per MJ
Solar thermal cells are only practical if they can operate over many charge/discharge cycles. The photochromic material can degrade during either cycle, typically as a result of unimolecular side reactions of the electronically excited states during charging (so-called photobleaching, e.g., the formation of dihydrophenanthrene from (Z)-stilbene followed by its oxidation to phenanthrene), in reactions with sensitizers if any are used (e.g., the photoaddition of ketones to NBD) or with ambient O2 or H2O or the material of the cell. Some of the most stable known photochromic pairs can undergo >104 cycles without degradation; examples include methyl-substituted dithienylperfluorocyclopentene 48145 (Fig. 24), bacteriorhodopsin,146 anthracene126 and certain azobenzenes and isoindigos. When both O2 and H2O are excluded, stiff stilbene appears to be quite resistant to photobleaching. Often photobleaching is more likely when shorter photoisomerization wavelengths and triplet sensitizers are used. For example, photoisomerization of NBD to QC (Fig. 9) is accompanied by the formation of toluene, among other byproducts. Toluene is a sensitizer for the reverse photoisomerization (QC → NBD) and its accumulation in the battery may significantly degrade the energy density and energy conversion efficiency.
 Fig. 24  The photocyclization and ring opening of a methyl-substituted dithienylperfluorocyclopentene, which exhibits thermally irreversible photochromism capable of cycling >104 times without significant degradation. In the dark, there is no interconversion between 48 and 49 at 80 °C for months.145 
If both isomers absorb at the photoisomerization wavelength(s), the stability of the photochromic material will be lowered if significant concentration gradients are allowed to develop along the optical path during charging (photoisomerization). Under such conditions molecules closer to the entrance surface of incident radiation will undergo many more excitation events than molecules farther away. Such repeated excitation can be minimized by limiting the optical path so that <15% of incident irradiation is absorbed during a single passage through the cell or, at the expense of lower energy conversion efficiency, by forced convection.
The cost of photochromic material is probably not a significant determinant of the potential utility of solar thermal cells. A battery material with a specific power density of 1 MJ kg−1 and price of $50 kg−1 (i.e., an approximate wholesale price of azobenzene derivatives) would deliver power at $0.15 per MJ at 1000 charge/discharge cycles if the overall system efficiency is 30%, assuming no maintenance costs. This compares to the mid-2011 retail price of gasoline of $0.03 per MJ in the US147 (and up to $0.1 per MJ worldwide2), photovoltaics of $0.06–0.12 per MJ (without subsidy, assuming 75000 operating hours),148 lead-acid batteries at $0.07 per MJ at 750 cycles; Li-ion batteries of $0.15 per MJ at 1000 cycles (including retail electricity at $0.04 per MJ);149 NiCd batteries at $0.2 per MJ at 2000 cycles; NiMH at $0.4 per MJ at 750 cycles; alkaline batteries at $53 per MJ and disposable Zn batteries at $75 per MJ.
7.5 Photoisomerization (charging) kinetics
The rate at which a discharged battery can be recharged depends primarily on the photon flux, magnitude of concentration and thermal gradients along the optical path of the cell and the quantum yield of photoisomerization. In the simplest case of minimal concentration and thermal gradients (which can be achieved by limiting the optical path so that <30% of incident radiation is absorbed, or by forced hydrodynamic convection), the fraction of the metastable isomer, x as a function of the irradiation time, is given by eqn (11), where I is the wavelength-dependent molar spectral irradiance of incident radiation (with units of mol s−1m−3, i.e., moles of photons per unit time per unit area per unit wavelength), [S]0 and [M]0 are volumetric concentrations of the stable and metastable isomers at the beginning of irradiation, [S] is the concentration at time t, εS and εM are the wavelength-dependent extinction coefficients of the two isomers; ϕS and ϕM are the (possibly wavelength-dependent) quantum yields of S → M and M → S photoisomerizations, respectively and l is the length of the optical path. (11)
An ideal chromophore for a solar thermal battery is transparent over the full range of radiation wavelengths (i.e., εM = 0). Three simpler limiting situations are possible:
1. The optical path is short enough that only <30% of incident radiation is absorbed. Since 1–10−x ≈ xln (10) for x < 0.3, eqn (11) simplifies to eqn (12), where [M] is the concentration of the metastable isomer at t seconds of irradiation, k is the photochemical rate constant (), and l is the optical path. In this case, the concentration of the isomers remains uniform throughout the optical path, eliminating the need for active mixing. (12)
2. All incident radiation is absorbed by a top layer of the material, but the solution is actively mixed to maintain a uniform concentration of the isomers and temperature throughout the optical path. Eqn (11) simplifies to eqn (13), which has no closed-form solution. (13)
3. All incident radiation is absorbed by a top layer of the material and material exchange between the photochemical layer and the bulk occurs by passive diffusion only.
Each of the three scenarios has its own advantages and disadvantages. Electronic transitions that result in photochemistry are often orbitally allowed and have molar absorptivities of εS(λmax) > 104 M−1 cm−1 (103 m2mol−1), so that 99% of incident radiation of λmax would be absorbed within a ∼300 nm thick layer of a hypothetical ideal neat chromophore of molecular weight 150 g mol−1 and density of 1 kg L−1. Consequently, in practice in may be difficult to achieve conditions 1 or 2 for photoisomerization at wavelengths around λmax. If the intensity of the incident irradiation at wavelengths that are absorbed by the metastable isomer is zero, each molecule of the chromophore would absorb on average no more than 1/ϕS photons, passive (diffusive) mass transport should not pose a significant risk of photobleaching. Simulated charging curves of 1 m × 1 m × 0.1 cm films (0.1 L volume) of such photochromic pairs are illustrated in Fig. 25. Because the metastable isomer is transparent at irradiation wavelengths, the photostationary state is comprised exclusively of the metastable isomer even if the quantum yield of its generation is <1 (diamonds). Note that although the irradiation time to full charging of a film of the photochromic compound absorbing at 550 nm 2–3 times less than that of the 330 nm absorbing film, its energy density is lower. Consequently, small chromophores that absorb around 300–350 nm are probably more suitable for use in solar batteries than larger analogs absorbing at the wavelength of the maximum intensity of solar radiance, even for applications where energy density is not of paramount importance or under the conditions of limited charging time. Another advantage of the higher-energy chromophores is the relatively lower reduction in the intensity of solar flux at wavelength below ∼450 nm by cloud cover, making higher-energy density solar batteries potentially less sensitive to weather conditions than the lower-energy analogs.
 Fig. 25  Simulated charging curves of 1 m × 1 m × 0.1 cm films of four hypothetical ideal photochromic compounds with the lowest-energy absorption peaks centered at 330 nm (blue) and 550 nm (red) under maximum solar flux. The curves were generated by numerical solution of eqn (11) assuming Gaussian absorption peaks with full width at half height of 60 nm; the diffusion coefficient of 10−9 m2 s−1 and density of 1 kg L−1. The relationship between λmax and the maximum energy density was the same as in Fig. 8A. 
However, if a fraction of the incident irradiation is absorbed by the metastable isomer, even if such absorption does not lead photoreversion to the stable isomer, reliance of passive (diffusive) mass transport in optically thick films may lead to an unacceptable degree of photobleaching. Long residence time of the metastable isomer in absorbing layers due to slow diffusion would result in sequential absorption of multiple photons, thus increasing the probability of side reactions of the electronically excited molecule. In such a situation, filtering irradiation that is absorbed by the metastable isomer or active mixing may be required.
7.6 Thermal isomerization (discharging) kinetics
The thermal isomerization of the metastable to stable isomer (discharge) should be slow at ambient temperature in the absence of the catalyst to prevent self-discharge. When needed, the reaction can be accelerated either by exposing the metastable isomer to a catalyst, or by increasing the temperature of the cell. The discharge temperature and the free energy of activation of the reversion reaction (ΔGrev‡) determine whether the discharge can be initiated and sustained without the use of a catalyst. Fig. 26 shows the minimum discharge temperature required to achieve average power density of 100 W kg−1 over 50% discharge of cells with the energy density of 0.5 MJ kg−1 and 0.1 MJ kg−1 as a function of ΔGrev‡. Operating temperatures above ∼200 °C may result in decomposition of the photochromic compound, suggesting that batteries that rely on thermal isomerization reactions with activation free energies above ∼125 kJ mol−1 can be discharged at useful rates only if continuous contact between a catalyst and the metastable isomer is maintained during discharge. Activation free energies of most valence isomerization reactions considered so far for solar thermal energy storage considerably exceed 125 kJ mol−1, and their use may require catalysis. Although several catalysts have been identified for some such reactions (e.g., QC to NBD, Fig. 9B), little is known about the catalytic mechanisms and catalysts remain to be identified for most valence isomerization reactions. A metastable isomer separated by a 125 kJ mol−1 activation barrier would have half-life of ∼12 years at room temperature, which should be sufficient for practical applications of the solar battery. The discharge of batteries based on metastable isomers with the activation energies of 125 kJ mol−1 or below may be self-sustaining, potentially requiring only transient local heating to initiate the reaction. Because of the difficulties in identifying the appropriate catalysts and potential technical complexities of designing cells to control the exposure of the metastable isomer to a catalyst there seems to be little benefit from using photochromic pairs that have activation barriers in excess of 125 kJ mol−1.
 Fig. 26  Discharge temperature required for self-sustained isomerization of the metastable isomer at a rate corresponding to an average power density of 100 W kg−1 over 50% discharge as a function of the activation free energy of the isomerization reaction. 
The analysis of charging and discharging kinetics suggest that an optimal metastable isomer for solar thermal batteries should have an activation free energy between ∼100 kJ mol−1 and 125 kJ mol−1 and an absorption spectrum that does not overlap with that of the stable isomer.
8. Technological niches for solar thermal batteries
We speculate that the first applications of solar thermal batteries would be to counterbalance diurnal temperature variations and/or to provide heat for personal needs, such as water heating, cooking or cleaning. Such uses could be of value both in stationary applications regardless of accessibility to a grid (e.g., from suburban houses to remote installations) and in mobile or rapid-deployment settings (e.g., military and humanitarian aid operations). Unlike conventional fuel supplies, which are depleted, solar thermal batteries are rechargeable. They may be preferable to photovoltaics by eliminating a second energy conversion step (i.e., solar to heat vs. solar to electrostatic potential to heat). A 1.5 MJ kg−1 solar thermal batter cycled 100 times would deliver more energy per unit mass than hydrogen or 3 times more than gasoline (even neglecting the mass of oxygen required for their combustion). Though the single-cycle specific energy density of a photochromic compound limits how much material would be needed for a given energy demand, the medium- to long-term energy needs of an individual may be satisfied with a few kg of such batteries. In situations where minimizing the mass of delivered material is crucial (e.g., the deployment of isolated military units or the delivery of aid materials to disaster areas), solar thermal batteries can readily meet the demands for basic necessities.
For example, maintaining a personal living space of ∼1 m3 at an average temperature of 19 °C when the outside temperature is −6 °C (average nighttime lows in the Sahara desert) requires ∼0.15 kW using modern foam insulation (thermal conductance 40 m K W−1, thickness 2.5 cm). A 3 kg solar battery of 1 MJ kg−1 energy density may satisfy this requirement and it can be fit to <1% of the living space. The battery could then be recharged by placing it in the sun during the day. Even during cloudy periods, the units could be incrementally recharged by intermittent sunlight but several batteries may be required to ensure that charged units are always available.
Cooking heat is required even when dwelling space heating is not. With suitable thermal insulation, a 1 MJ kg−1 solar thermal battery could be used to heat ∼3 times its mass of water from 25 °C to its boiling point, or it could sustain an elevated temperature in a smaller amount of water for a longer period of time. Such a system could be used to cook, to disinfect drinking water, or to disinfect items placed in the boiling water. With a single battery (or several smaller batteries which may be more safely stored) capable of delivering 1 MJ of energy (e.g., 1 L of 1 MJ kg−1 with density ∼1 kg L−1) contained in a 4 L cylinder with an inner diameter of 16 cm and a internal height of 20 cm sheathed in ∼2.5 cm of extruded polystyrene (R5 insulation, 0.88 m2 K W−1), the 75 °C difference between the interior and exterior could be maintained for more than 1 h. In places where electricity is unavailable or fuel delivery is impractical, such a rechargeable source of heat for cooking and water disinfection might be important.
9. Conclusions
It is highly unlikely that the increasing global energy demand can be met by a single technology. Solar fuels make up an attractive solution that combines high energy densities and the ability to meet distributed demands in diverse applications. The development of the two types of solar fuels involves different sets of challenges. Conventional open-cycle fuels, such as CH4, and CH3OH, synthesized from CO2 and H2O with solar energy input can be used in existing devices. The central scientific questions for their development are those of catalysis and how to couple endergonic reactions to the absorption of photons. To be carbon-neutral, the generation and use of such fuels must be combined in a cycle that is closed on the macroscopic level. To do so requires either isolating the combustion products at the point of generation or recapturing them from the environment once they are released. Either task is challenging to carry out efficiently.
A chemical solution for storing solar energy can also be closed at the molecular level, producing solar thermal batteries based on reversible isomerization of photochromic molecules. Despite a substantial amount of work over the past 40 years, practical photochromic molecules suitable for use in solar thermal batteries remain to be created. In this review we analyzed briefly molecules that have been considered in the past for solar energy storage, suggested how molecular properties of a photochromic pair determine the performance characteristics of the battery (although such relationships very much remain to be quantified experimentally), and proposed an alternative strategy to developing the chemistry of solar thermal batteries. The traditional approach relies on designing a pair of isomers, one of which is significantly strained followed by attempts to tune the photophysical properties of the strain-free (stable) isomer to make the pair suitable for solar energy storage.
The alternative is to start with a photochromic pair already having suitable photophysical properties and to modify the chromophore to make one of the isomers strained. An example of such an approach is a macrocycle containing a stiff stilbene chromophore (red moiety, Fig. 27) with its phenyl rings bridged by an inert linker whose length is sufficient to accommodate the strain-free Z isomer but is too short for the longer E isomer.
 Fig. 27  Bridging the phenyl rings of stiff stilbene by an inert linker, R, 11 or fewer atoms long does not affect the thermodynamic stability of the Z isomer but destabilizes the E analog by up to 28 kcal mol−1, turning stiff stilbene in a potentially promising candidate for solar thermal energy storage.148,150,151 
This approach requires a fundamental understanding of how to use molecular design to satisfy seemingly contradictory requirements, such as minimizing the standard free energy of reaction while maximizing both its activation energy (which is the inverse of the widely applicable linear free energy relationships) and the quantum yield of generation of the strained isomer and the photoisomerization wavelength (in contrast to the common decrease in the activation energy of isomerization with an increase in the photoisomerization wavelength, Fig. 7).
Despite the molecular-design challenges posed by developing closed-system solar fuels, they may offer unique advantages over other solutions for storing solar energy (e.g., combustible fuels, redox batteries, etc.), including carbon-neutral operation, potential ease of use and recycling, capacity for the long-term storage of energy and suitability for mobile applications. Although solar thermal batteries based on one-photon photochemistry cannot compete with conventional fuels in terms of single-cycle energy densities, their cumulative energy densities (energy stored and released over their operational lifetime) significantly exceeds that of a conventional fuel, thus relaxing constraints on which molecular structures would be economically feasible. Given these attributes, closed-system solar fuels can, with sufficient R&D investment and based on a fundamental understanding of the relationship between chemical reactivity and molecular strain, provide a practical means of capturing, storing and releasing solar energy.

Broader context
The increasing global demand for energy requires new sources that can be exploited without the environmental impact of fossil fuels. The largest and most widely distributed source of energy on Earth is sunlight, whose intermittent nature requires efficient energy storage strategies before it can become a major source of energy to power the modern society. Although significant progress has been made in devising practical strategies of capturing and utilizing solar energy, such as photovoltaics to generate electricity, photocatalysis to produce chemical fuels and solar heating, progress in energy storage remains limited. This review analyzes one potential solution for solar energy storage based on the reversible photogeneration of highly strained molecules. Such a solar heat battery combines the capability for long-term energy storage (weeks or years), characteristic of conventional fuels such as CH4 or CH3OH, with closed-cycle operation in which no chemicals are released into the environment. In theory such batteries could have energy and power densities at least comparable to that of redox batteries and may be of particular value in meeting intermittent energy demands in distributed or mobile applications.


 	Fig. 1  Existing technologies to convert sunlight into electricity on large scales include the use of arrays of photovoltaic cells (A) to do so directly and the use of parabolic troughs (B, courtesy of DOE/NREL) or fields of sun-tracking reflectors (C) to concentrate sunlight on pipes containing heat-transfer fluids to drive steam turbines.	 

 	Fig. 2  General energy storage/release cycles for closed-system (A) and open-system (B) solar fuels. (A) The precursor (stable isomer) for a closed-system solar fuel uses the energy of an absorbed photon to drive its endergonic, unimolecular photoisomerization into the fuel form (metastable isomer). Upon heating or exposure to a catalyst, the fuel thermally isomerizes back to the precursor form without exchanging any material with the environment, releasing the stored energy ΔGisomo which can be used to do work. (B) A catalyst absorbs the energy of multiple photons to drive the multi-step endergonic conversion of the fuel precursor (here, CO2 and H2O) into fuel (CH4). Though the necessary oxidant for combustion (O2) is also produced, it is generally instead pulled from the environment (air) during the combustion process, and the combustion products are generally released into the environment. The free energy released during combustion represents the maximum amount of work that the system may perform.	 
CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2	(1)
CO + H2O → CO2 + H2	(2)

 	Fig. 3  Examples of operation cycles for molecular H2 carriers: (A) the cycling of CO2 to carry H2 as formic acid;36 (B) a H2 storage and release cycle developed at Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. using a catalytic hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and oxidation cycle of π-conjugated organics (here, fluorene);37,38 and (C) the release of H2 from ammonia borane and the regeneration of ammonia borane from the product polyborazylene (PB) using hydrazine in liquid ammonia.41	 

 	Fig. 4  Solar irradiance on an equator-facing surface with a 37° tilt for air mass 1.5. Data from ref. 59.	 

 	Fig. 5  (A) The wavelength of the lowest-energy absorption band at its absorption maximum, λmax, vs. the molecular weight of several classes of chromophores: olefins (purple), polyenes (black), stilbenes (light blue), norbornodienes (red), spiropyrans (blue), azobenzenes (green) and isoindigoes (orange). See Fig. 6 and Table 1 for the chemical structures. (B) A generic, vibrationally resolved electronic absorption spectrum (0 → 0, 0 → 1, etc. denote the initial and final vibrational states of each peak). The vibronic structure of UV-vis spectra of organic chromophores is often resolved only at temperatures <77 K; at room temperature transitions from vibrationally excited states on the S0 surface become sufficiently intense to result in broad unresolved absorption peaks.	 
	(3)

 	Fig. 6  Reduced-dimensionality energy surfaces of the singlet ground (S0) and first excited (S1) states of a hypothetical photochromic compound. The photochemical conversion of the stable to the metastable (fuel) isomers is indicated by the solid black arrows: upon photon absorption the stable isomer is excited to the S1 surface, followed by fast (femtoseconds) relaxation from the initial Franck–Condon configuration toward the S1 minimum. The molecule returns to the S0 surface through an S0/S1 seam (e.g., the minimum energy conical intersection MECI) within a few picoseconds after photon absorption. On the S0 surface, the molecule may return to the original stable isomer (unproductive relaxation, dashed black arrow) or form the metastable isomer (productive relaxation). The metastable isomer reverts to the stable analog thermally (solid red arrow) over the energy barrier of ΔGrev‡, which releases the stored energy, ΔGisomo.	 

 	Fig. 7  The longest wavelength that affects photoisomerization of stable chromophores to its metastable isomer (at the maximum absorptivity, λmax, Fig. 5B) correlates inversely with the activation barrier of thermal reversion, ΔHrev‡, across several classes of chromophores. The chemical structures and the data are listed in Table 1.
