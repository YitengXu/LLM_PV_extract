Broader context
The increasing demand for energy and environmental protection has stimulated intensive research on energy production and conversion. Hydrogen and oxygen produced via water splitting have emerged as a potential fuel for sustainable energy cycles, such as fell cells. Meanwhile, the water splitting technology by electrolysis can effectively regulate the balance of power demand-supply. Efficient catalysts for the oxidation of H2O to O2 represent a critical component in solar fuel production systems that store renewable energy in the form of chemical fuels. The current main challenge is to lower the substantial overpotential of earth-abundant material based electrodes, and thus enhance the energy harvesting efficiency. Herein, a Ni3S2 nanorods/Ni foam composite electrode is prepared as a high-performance catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which exhibits excellent OER activity with a small overpotential of ∼157 mV based on the onset of catalytic current.

Efficient catalysts for the oxidation of H2O to O2 represent a critical component in solar fuel production systems that store renewable energy in the form of chemical fuels.1–4 To date, the most robust and efficient catalysts for this oxidation reaction are precious metal oxides (e.g. RuO2 and IrO2).5–8 Especially, RuO2 exhibits a low overpotential of ∼140 mV in alkaline solutions.9,10 However, the high cost and scarcity of these noble metals severely limit their widespread application in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recently, electrode materials based on transition metal oxides as alternatives to these expensive noble metals, such as manganese oxide,11,12 cobalt oxide13–15 and nickel oxide,16,17 have been the subject of intense research. The overpotential of earth-abundant catalysts can be markedly reduced by using complex oxides with different structures (e.g. spinel and perovskite)18–20 and morphologies (e.g. nanowire and nanosheet),21 or loading them on various substrates (e.g. Au and graphene).22,23 For instance, Pickrahn et al. reported that MnO films on glassy carbon obtained by atomic layer deposition (ALD) presented the best performance among MnOx catalysts, where the overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was ∼360 mV.9 Gao et al. reported that a current density of 10 mA cm−2 can be achieved at a small overpotential of ∼450 mV for the Mn3O4/CoSe2 nanocomposite,20 comparable to the performance of the best reported Co3O4/graphene catalyst.23 However, the overpotential of transition metal oxides is still much higher than that of Ru-based catalysts (RuO2).9,10 Therefore, the current main challenge is to lower the substantial overpotential of earth-abundant material based electrodes, and thus enhance the energy harvesting efficiency.
As earth abundant, environmentally friendly and rich valence state materials, nickel sulfides (such as NiS and Ni3S2) have been widely investigated24–26 owing to their important applications in electrochemical capacitors (e.g. NiS hollow spheres)27 and lithium batteries (e.g. Ni3S2 nanowires and nanoflakes).28,29 The nickel foam was usually used as an electrode material in applications such as supercapacitors30,31 and electrocatalysis.32,33 However, to the best of our knowledge, the use of Ni3S2/Ni as an OER catalyst has not been reported yet. Herein, a novel highly active OER catalyst, a Ni3S2 nanorod array grown on Ni foam, referred to as Ni3S2/Ni, was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction. Our results show that the Ni3S2/Ni electrode has an ultra-low overpotential of ∼187 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH at 25 °C, which is much lower than that of 20 wt% Pt/C or transition metal oxides, such as MnO2, Fe2O3, and Co3O4, presented in this paper. In fact, the Ni3S2/Ni prepared in this work, with a performance close to that of Ru based-catalysts (RuO2),10 exhibited the best OER performance among the non-noble metal inorganic catalysts reported so far.23
Fig. 1a–c depicts the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the obtained Ni3S2/Ni (see the Experimental section for details). The Ni foam is uniformly covered by Ni3S2 nanorods (Fig. 1a) with diameters in the range of 300 to 600 nm and lengths of ∼1 μm (Fig. 1b and c). The XRD pattern of the as-grown Ni3S2/Ni (Fig. 1d) shows obvious phase peaks at 2θ = 21.7°, 31.1°, 37.8°, 49.7° and 55.2° corresponding to (101), (110), (003), (113) and (122) planes of the Ni3S2 crystal, respectively (JCPDS no. 44-1418). Note that the two characteristic peaks at 2θ = 44.5° and 51.8° in the XRD pattern are from the Ni foam (JCPDS no. 65-2865).

The structure of as-prepared Ni3S2 nanorods was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2a shows a representative TEM image of a single Ni3S2 nanorod. The HRTEM image of the Ni3S2 nanorod (Fig. 2b) gives a lattice spacing of 0.28 nm and 0.4 nm, corresponding to the (110) and (101) interplanar spacings of Ni3S2, respectively (hexagonal, a = b = 0.574 nm, c = 0.714 nm). The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Fig. 2a) confirms that the single crystalline Ni3S2 nanorod grows along the [110] direction.

The linear sweeps of all test materials in an anodic direction are shown in Fig. 3a. The potential onset of the catalytic current of the Ni3S2/Ni electrode is about +0.42 V with a low overpotential (η) of only 157 mV (see the calculation in the ESI†). Such performance is much better than that of 20 wt% Pt/C at the same catalyst loading (Fig. 3a) and the best reported Co3O4/graphene OER catalyst (∼310 mV at 10 mA cm−2, 1 M KOH).23 Note that the pure Ni foam shows the anodic oxidation peak at +0.46 V, which leads to an unstable potential with running time. This oxidation peak was not observed for the Ni3S2/Ni electrode, indicating the good stability of the composite catalyst. In addition, the Ni3S2/Ni electrode showed the smallest Tafel slope value (159.3 mV dec−1) among all the presented samples (Fig. 3b). In order to exclude the effects from Ni foam, pre-synthesized Ni3S2 nanorods were also adhered onto glassy carbon (GC) electrodes and subjected to voltammetric sweeps in 0.1 M KOH (see ESI for experimental details†). Similar measurements for a bare GC electrode, 20 wt% Pt/C–GC, MnO2 nanoparticles (NPs)–GC, Fe2O3 NPs–GC and Co3O4 NPs–GC electrodes were also performed for comparison (Fig. S1a†). As expected, the bare GC electrode showed poor catalytic activity for OER. Ni3S2 nanorods on the GC electrode exhibited the highest current and a much earlier onset of catalytic current as compared to all the other tested samples. It is worth mentioning that the Tafel slope of the Ni3S2 modified GC electrode was 64.8 mV dec−1, much smaller than that of the Ni3S2/Ni electrode (i.e. 159.3 mV dec−1), which can be attributed to the diffusion limitation through the Ni foam electrode. However, in the Ni3S2/Ni hybrid system, the factors affecting the Tafel slope are complicated. Therefore, we evaluated the catalysts based on the onset potential, i.e., the potential at which the OER activity begins.

(b) Corresponding Tafel plot (overpotential versus log current) derived from (a). (c) OER polarization curves for the Ni3S2/Ni electrode before and after 1000 cycles used for the stability test. (d) Current–time plot of the Ni3S2/Ni electrode with the applied potential at 0.5 V and 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under the same conditions. All tests were performed using a Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) as the counter electrode. 
In addition to the good catalytic activity, the Ni3S2/Ni electrode also exhibited good stability for OER. Fig. 3c shows that, even after 1000 potential cycles, the j–V curve of the Ni3S2/Ni electrode was almost the same as the initial one. The result of reverse scans also confirmed the good stability of the Ni3S2/Ni electrode (Fig. S2†). In contrast, the stability of the Ni3S2 nanorod-loaded GC electrode was not as good as that of the Ni3S2/Ni electrode (Fig. S1c†). Even after only 50 cycles, the anodic current of the Ni3S2/GC electrode was obviously reduced by 0.9 mA cm−2 at +0.55 V. The anodic oxidation peak at about +0.44 V was observed after 200 cycles. This suggests that the direct growth of Ni3S2 on Ni foam ensures a strong bonding between Ni3S2 and Ni, which enables effective electron collection and fast electron transfer. In contrast, the physically attached Ni3S2 structures on the GC electrode might lose contact with the electrode over repeated catalytic cycles, thus leading to poor cycling stability.
To further investigate the stability of Ni3S2/Ni in OER, the current–time plots of the Ni3S2/Ni electrode with the applied potentials at +0.5 V and +0.6 V are presented in Fig. 3d. The stable current over 10 h of continuous operation suggests that the Ni3S2/Ni electrode exhibits good durability for OER in 0.1 M KOH, which decreased by about 5%. The bubbles were observed on the surface of the Ni3S2/Ni electrode (Fig. S3b†). The gas was confirmed to be oxygen by gas chromatography, and the oxygen production rate is shown in Fig. S3a.† Importantly, the stable OER currents of the Ni3S2/Ni electrode at +0.5 V and +0.6 V are about 10 and 6 times that of 20 wt% Pt/C, respectively.
Furthermore, different structures of Ni3S2 on Ni foam were synthesized by controlling the reaction time (e.g. 2, 4 and 6 h), thereby investigating the effect of Ni3S2 morphology on the catalytic activities. The SEM images and XRD results of Ni3S2 NPs (e.g. 2 h of reaction) and Ni3S2 long nanorods (e.g. 6 h of reaction) grown on Ni foam are shown in Fig. S4 and S5,† respectively. Ni3S2 NPs/Ni foam was unremarkable in OER performance with obvious oxidation of Ni (Fig. S6a†), which was similar to that observed with the pure Ni foam. Ni3S2 long nanorods/Ni foam displayed the highest initial anodic current (Fig. S6a†) but the stability was not good (Fig. S6b†). After 1000 cycles, the anodic current decreased to a value similar to that of Ni3S2 short nanorods/Ni foam (e.g. 4 h).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the surface composition of the composite electrodes (Fig. 4). The two strong peaks at around 855.2 and 872.7 eV can be attributed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 4a). The peak at 852.7 eV is the characteristic peak of Ni3S2.29,34 The associated excited final state satellite near 860 and 879 eV indicated the presence of nickel–oxygen species on the surface of Ni3S2, most probably hydrated nickel oxide.26 After 100 cycles, the peak for Ni3S2 at 852.7 eV disappeared (Fig. 4b). Meanwhile, the relative intensity of the primary and satellite 2p3/2 peaks (i.e. 860 and 879 eV) arising from hydrated nickel oxide was enhanced, which implied that the layer thickness of hydrated nickel oxide on the surface of Ni3S2 nanorods increased after 100 cycles. This increased surface oxidation can also be observed by SEM (Fig. S7a–c†). However, hydrated nickel oxide was not detected in the composite electrodes after 100 and 1000 cycles by XRD analysis (Fig. S7d†), probably because the oxide layer was too thin.

The mechanism for the enhanced performance of the Ni3S2/Ni composite electrode is still not fully understood. We believe that the rich and unusual valence states of Ni (Ni0, Ni+ and Ni2+) in the Ni3S2/Ni composite electrode play important roles in its enhanced OER performance with a low overpotential. A similar mechanism for the disproportionation and comproportionation of Mn3+ in MnO2 OER catalysts was reported.10 Moreover, hydrated nickel oxide derived from the Ni2S3 on its surface in basic solution also could provide the active sites. This is because, in general, the oxides or hydrated oxides are good OER catalysts since water adsorbs favorably on their surfaces, which is a critical first step in the process of OER. Furthermore, the direct growth of Ni3S2 on Ni foam, which can effectively collect and rapidly transfer electrons, enables a strong bonding between Ni3S2 and the Ni electrode and thus an enhanced OER stability. The Bell22 and Dai23 groups also reported that Au and graphene conductive support significantly enhanced the OER activity of the Co3O4 catalyst, suggesting that the synergetic chemical coupling effect between the catalyst (Co3O4 and Ni3S2) and the support (Au, graphene, Ni foam) is presumably another important reason for the enhanced OER performance.
In summary, the large-scale preparation of Ni3S2/Ni composite, i.e. single-crystal Ni3S2 nanorod decorated Ni foam, was achieved by a simple hydrothermal reaction. This composite electrode exhibited excellent OER activity with a small overpotential of ∼157 mV based on the onset of catalytic current. The synergetic chemical coupling effects among hydrated Ni3S2 nanorods, the nickel oxide layer and the Ni foam support could be the reason for the enhanced OER performance. The low-cost, earth-abundant and easily constructed Ni3S2/Ni composite electrodes with a low overpotential, good stability and large anodic current could be new promising active materials for the OER application.
