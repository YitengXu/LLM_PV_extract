, Accepted 3rd October 2016First published on 3rd October 2016AbstractThe creation of stable and efficient photocatalysts that produce hydrogen from water under solar light is a burgeoning area of research. As a prospective candidate, TiO2 has been widely studied. Herein, we further designed and synthesized composites of mixed crystal TiO2 with high-performance carbon quantum dots (CQDs) via a facile approach. The CQDs were made by electrolyzing graphite rods and the mixed crystal TiO2 from titanium oxysulfate under a hydrothermal reaction, and then the resulting materials were heated to a high temperature under H2. All the characterization proved that the CQDs had been successfully modified onto TiO2 with both anatase and brookite phases. The newly synthesized samples showed an excellent performance for hydrogen evolution using AM 1.5 light sources. The large hydrogen evolution yield was 280 μmol h−1, which was higher than that produced by pure TiO2. It indicates that CQDs as electron storage could improve the separation of charges and inhibit the recombination of electron–hole pairs. Concurrently, the formation of heterostructures between the two phases of TiO2 would help electron–hole separation, which is another reason for the good performance of the photocatalyst.
1. Introduction
In recent years, energy and environment issues have been paid increasing attention.1,2 So far special attention has been focused on hydrogen, known to be a kind of attractive clean energy. To generate hydrogen from water under mild conditions, the reasonable selection of catalysts is of great importance. Since Fujishima and Honda discovered, in 1972, that the TiO2 single crystal electrode can decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen under UV light,3 a new era of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution has been coming. And thus TiO2 has become one of the most promising photocatalysts in recent research.4–7
However, because of the large band gap (3.2 eV), high recombination rate of photoelectrons and holes and the low quantum yield, the solar energy conversion efficiency of TiO2, particularly utilizing visible light, is restricted. Many efforts have been made to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.8–10 Some earlier studies have found that non-metal element modification can enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. C, N, S, and F modified TiO2 for instance have been reported by many researchers.11–15
Quantum dots have attracted a lot of attention during the past few years.16–19 As a new type of carbon material, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a real candidate material for photocatalytic reactions. Since their discovery in 2004,20 CQDs have attracted considerable interest from many researchers because of their merits of low toxicity, biocompatibility, optical properties, etc.21–24 In many studies, researchers used CQDs to form a composite with a metal (Au, Ag, Pt),25,26 semiconductor oxides (TiO2, Fe2O3)27,28 and bulk materials, which can extend the application of the composite to areas such as biological imaging, photocatalysis, photoelectric conversion and sensors. Although, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 can be enhanced by CQD modification on its surface,29,30 at present, little is known about the intrinsic mechanism. The process of electronic transmission between the CQDs and the semiconductor also requires in depth understanding.
Herein, a hydrogen-treated CQD modified TiO2 composite (CQDs-H2) with enhanced photocatalytically active TiO2 nanoparticles was produced by an improved solvothermal approach, and CQDs were prepared via electrolysis of graphite rods. A series of CQD-TiO2 (CST) composites were synthesized by changing the weight content of CQDs in ethanol and then treated under H2 to give CST-H2. Their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation under solar light was addressed.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
The chemicals used in this work, titanium oxysulfate and hydrazine hydrate, were purchased from the Aldrich Company. All aqueous solutions were prepared with ultrapure water. All chemical reagents in this study were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
2.2 Synthetic procedures
Synthesis of mixed-crystal phase TiO2 (ST). First, 1 g of titanium oxysulfate was dissolved in 30 mL of distilled water. Then, 4 mL of hydrazine hydrate was added to the solution, and this solution mixture was magnetically stirred for 10 min. After stirring, the mixed aqueous solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 150 °C for 24 h. After completing the reaction, the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature. The resultant precipitate was centrifuged and washed with distilled water five times and dried at 60 °C for 5 h. The anatase and brookite mixed-crystalline-phase TiO2 (ST) was obtained.
Synthesis of CQDs. The CQDs were synthesized through electrolysis of graphite rods. Firstly, the graphite rods were put into a 500 mL quartz container with fully-distilled water as both the anode and cathode. Then, the CQDs were produced under a current of 10 A for 3 days. After treatment by rotary evaporation and dialysis, black CQDs were obtained.
Synthesis of CST-H2. Firstly, xCQDs (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5 wt%) were dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol, and stirred at room temperature. Then the ST was added to the solution, and vigorous stirring was continued for another 10 min. The solution was centrifuged at a high speed, 8000 rpm, for 3 min to obtain the precipitate and dried at 60 °C for 8 h. The dried precipitate was heated from room temperature to 600 °C at a rate of 2 °C min−1 and then maintained at 600 °C for 2 h under H2. A gray final sample was obtained. Furthermore, ST-H2 was synthesized by incinerating the ST under the same conditions.
2.3 Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were taken with a Hitachi S-4800 operating at 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs were obtained with a JEM-2100 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were measured with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with a VG ESCALAB MK II equipped with an Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) achromatic X-ray source. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One spectrometer using KBr pellets. The photoluminescence spectra (PL) were recorded with a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature.
2.4 Photocatalytic hydrogen production
The photocatalytic hydrogen production experiment was investigated by suspending 0.1 g of catalyst in a mixture of 80 mL of distilled water and 20 mL of methanol in the reaction container by using a magnetic stirrer. 1 wt% Pt from a H2PtCl6 aqueous solution was loaded onto the photocatalysts by the known normal method of in situ photodeposition. Before starting the reaction, the suspension was degassed by evacuation to remove O2 and CO2 dissolved in the water. The reaction was carried out by irradiating the suspension with an AM 1.5 solar power system (solar simulator (Oriel, USA)) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, USA). The data was collected on an online photo-catalytic hydrogen production system (Aulight, Beijing, CEL-SPH2N) at ambient temperature (20 °C). Gas evolution could be observed only under irradiation, and was analyzed on an on-line gas chromatograph (SP7800, TCD, N2 carrier, Beijing Keruida Limited). To determine the stability of photocatalyst, after running the hydrogen production process for 2.5 h, the photocatalyst was centrifugated from the suspension, washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 °C. The refreshed photocatalyst was then used for the next hydrogen production for 2.5 h under the same conditions.
2.5 Photoelectric properties measurement
The photocurrents of the CST-H2 and ST-H2 electrodes were measured by using a BAS100B electrochemical analyzer (Bioanalytical Systems Inc. USA) in the three-electrode configuration. CST-H2 or ST-H2 was the working electrode, saturated Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, and platinum foil (3 × 2 cm) was used as the counter electrode. 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte. A 70 mW UV lamp (OMRONZUV-C30H, k = 365 nm) provided the AM 1.5, which penetrated the circular quartz window mounted on one side of the cell and illuminated the working electrode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization
The X-ray diffraction patterns can be used to reveal the structure and crystallinity of the material. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the xCST-H2 (x = 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 wt%) composites with different amounts of CQDs. The diffraction peaks at 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.2°, 53.9°, 55.1° and 62.7° correspond to the characteristic peaks of anatase,31 while the diffraction peak at 30.8° is indexed as the (121) lattice plane of the brookite phase.32,33 It can be seen that all the samples exhibit the characteristic diffraction peaks of the anatase and brookite phases of TiO2, illustrating that they are composed of both anatase and brookite phases, and that there is a junction between the two phases, which is one of the reasons for the improvement in properties of the samples. Meanwhile, every sample has diffraction peaks in fixed positions with no shift, elucidating that the different amounts of CQDs in the CST-H2 have not changed the structure of the composites. We cannot see any diffraction peaks belonging to the CQDs in Fig. 1, which can be ascribed to their poor crystallinity and low content. Interestingly, the diffraction intensity of the brookite phase has a slight enhancement with an increased amount of CQDs. However, 0.5 wt% CST-H2 has the weakest intensity at 30.8° instead of 0.2 wt% CST-H2, which suggests that when the mixed-crystalline-phase ST is modified by 0.5 wt% CQDs, the brookite content is decreased. Table S1† shows the relative ratio between the brookite phase and the anatase phase in xCST-H2 (x = 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 wt%). The results indicate that the 0.5% CST-H2 has the lowest amount of the brookite phase TiO2, at only around 0.74%.

TEM is used to reveal the morphology changes of the composite. It can be employed for further investigation of the sample’s structure. From the TEM image of 0.5% CST-H2 (Fig. 2a), it can be seen that the sample is a spindle type structure with a uniform size. There is a disordered layer around the composite, which retains a similar spindle shape to the pure ST samples (Fig. 2b). This suggests that the hydrogenation treatment process can result in the formation of a disordered layer, which is in agreement with the previous conclusion. Fig. 2c shows the HRTEM image of 0.5% CST-H2. The lattice spacing of 0.34 nm is in accordance with the d-spacing of the (101) plane of the TiO2 anatase phase, and the lattice spacing of 0.29 nm corresponds to the (121) plane of the TiO2 brookite phase. At the same time, there is an obvious heterojunction between the two phases of TiO2. Meanwhile, Fig. 2d can clearly prove the existence of CQDs. The lattice spacing of 0.2 nm corresponds to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon, further proving the successful coupling of the CQDs with the ST. The conclusions drawn from Fig. 2 show great agreement with the XRD analysis, revealing that a disordered layer could be formed after hydrogen incinerating treatment. According to the above discussion, the carbon quantum dots successfully combined with the ST, and the existence of the disordered layer formed after hydrogen incinerating treatment was proved, which will improve the efficiency of both generation and separation of the photo-generated carriers within the sample.

FT-IR spectra are shown to demonstrate the chemical structure of hydrogenated CQDs (CQDs-H2), 0.5% CST-H2 and ST-H2 samples in Fig. 3. The characteristic absorption peaks at 3421 and 1628 cm−1 in both the 0.5% CST-H2 and ST-H2 samples are related to vibrations of O–H bonds. There is a peak at nearly 2976 cm−1 present in the CQDs-H2 and 0.5% CST-H2 samples, which can be assigned as the C–H bonds of the CQDs. Comparing the two samples, the remarkable absorption peak of 0.5% CST-H2 at 1372 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of C–O bonds on the boundary of the CQDs and ST,34 which arises from the interaction between the CQDs and ST. The above evidence proves that the CQDs have been integrated successfully with the ST. This also further confirmed the preceding conclusion.

An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiment was performed for further investigation of the surface chemical composition and valence state of the composites. The full-range spectrum in Fig. 4a shows that the existing elements on the surface of the composite are Ti, O, N, and C. In Fig. 4b the C 1s signal of 0.5% CST-H2 has three distinct peaks at 284.7 eV, 286.1 eV and 288.9 eV, which are attributed to the sp2 orbital of the C–C bond, C–O and OC–O bonds, respectively. This suggests that the CQDs are loaded successfully on to the ST, which is consistent with the HRTEM and FT-IR analysis. The XPS peaks of O 1s at 529.6 eV, and 532.2 eV are ascribed to the Ti–O and O–H bonds, respectively, and the characteristic peak at 530.9 eV is attributed to the C–O bond (Fig. 4c),35 which further indicates the presence of CQDs in CST-H2. Fig. 4d shows the Ti 1s orbital of the ST-H2 and 0.5% CST-H2 samples. Comparing the Ti 1s XPS spectrum of 0.5% CST-H2 to that of ST-H2, the 0.5% CST-H2 composite shows a slight shift towards higher binding energies, suggesting that the chemical state of Ti has been changed in the compound. This may imply the formation of Ti–O–C36,37 which is due to the existence of loaded-CQDs. As indicated in previous reports,7,38–40 the Ti 2p peak of Ti3+ usually occurs in the relatively low-energy region. So our XPS results suggest that there may exist some Ti3+ on the surface of the 0.5% CST-H2. To keep the electroneutrality of the sample, charges would be compensated for by oxygen vacancies. As a result, the formed Ti3+ and the oxygen vacancies can effectively reduce the band gap and improve the photocatalytic efficiency. From a previous study,29 the evidence obtained from the XPS spectra and other measurements prove the existence of CQDs on the ST.

The optical features and electronic band gaps of all the composites with different amounts of CQDs were also examined through UV-visible measurements, together with ST and ST-H2 as references. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the samples exhibit absorption in the visible region of 400–800 nm. Compared to ST-H2, the ultraviolet absorption of 0.5% CST-H2 has a slight red-shift, that may be due to the good contact interface between CQDs and ST. The hydrogenation process can not only introduce a great number of defects (Ti3+/oxygen vacancy),41 but also play a role in providing the surface with hydrogenation reduced CQDs (r-CQDs). It’s reported42 that surface r-CQDs underwent changes of their surface state, which will vary the CQDs’ chemical properties, such as wavelengths of absorption and emission. After hydrogen treatment at high temperatures, the surface state of the intrinsic r-CQDs achieves an increasing degree of conjugation due to the loss of surface groups, which leads to a red shift of the absorption. So after the combination of TiO2 and the CQDs, the electrons can be transferred from the CQDs to TiO2.41,42

However, the absorption edge of 0.5% CST-H2 is 3.32 eV, showing a reduction of about 0.03 eV compared to that of ST-H2 (Fig. S1†). This suggests that after hydrogen treatment, the surface-disordered-layer of the samples further improves their absorption intensity, which is another reason that caused little differences between the two kinds of sample.
Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra are generally used for investigating the electron–hole pair lifetime of semiconductor materials, and also provide recombination information on photo-generated carriers.43 Fig. 6 shows the PL spectra of all the samples, which were excited at 320 nm. However, in the PL spectrum of the 0.5% CST-H2 composite, a weaker emission peak in the same position is detected, which indicates that the photo-generated charge recombination rate in the 0.5% CST-H2 composite is much lower than that in ST and ST-H2. The recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs is greatly inhibited by the introduction of CQDs.
 Fig. 6  Photoluminescence spectra of ST, ST-H2 and xCST-H2 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5 wt%) samples under excitation at 320 nm. 
The time course hydrogen evolution activities of xCST-H2, ST-H2 and pure ST samples under AM 1.5 light irradiation are shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7a illustrates that pure ST is able to generate 40 μmol of hydrogen gas per hour under AM 1.5 light irradiation. As a comparison 0.5% CST-H2 showed a higher rate of hydrogen generation activity of about 280 μmol h−1, illustrating that the sample has excellent activity for hydrogen evolution (Table S2†). We can clearly distinguish that CST-H2 has better hydrogen generation activity than ST-H2 and the pure ST sample, suggesting that the hydrogen incinerating treatment can improve the optical activity of the samples. That may be because of the formation of the disordered layer caused by oxygen vacancies during the hydrogen treatment process. The disordered layer and the existence of the CQDs may boost generation and separation of the photo-induced charge carriers. The disordered structure can capture photo-generated carriers and simultaneously the CQDs could restrain the electron–hole pair recombination rate.44

In order to measure the stability of the 0.5% CST-H2 sample, we repeated the hydrogen evolution experiment 5 times under the same conditions, and the results are shown in Fig. 7b. However, the performance of the sample did not show a significant change, suggesting that the sample is able to sustain steady activity for hydrogen production, and indicating that the sample has great stability. The transient photocurrent response of the ST, ST-H2 and xCST-H2 (x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 3, 5 wt%) samples was measured to study the excitation and transfer of photo-generated charge carriers during several on–off cycles under AM 1.5 light irradiation, the results of which are shown in Fig. 8. All of the samples exhibit a prompt photocurrent response, however the photocurrent response of 0.5% CST-H2 is notably enhanced, showing a response that is twice as large as that of ST-H2. We find that the stable photocurrent density trend of the two samples is in agreement with the trend of the hydrogen generation activity. The 0.5% CST-H2 composite, with better hydrogen generation activity, also has a greater photocurrent response. This can be ascribed to the CQDs in the composite playing a role as a photo-generated electron acceptors. On one hand, it can improve the separation of photo-induced electron–hole pairs through receiving electrons. On the other it can also control the recombination of them.39

The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are presented as Nyquist plots (Fig. S2†) and it was observed that the charge-transfer resistance of 0.5% CST-H2 was decreased compared to that of ST-H2. All of the results illustrate that the photo-induced electron-transfer efficiency is increased after coupling with the CQDs. Based on the above evidence, the reaction mechanism can be obtained as follows. CQDs wrap around the mixed phase TiO2 surface, after hydrogen treatment, a disordered layer was formed on the TiO2. Because of the existence of mixed-phase TiO2, the junction between the two phases favours transportation of photo-generated carriers. The electron–hole recombination process in intrinsic state CQDs can be regarded as the nature of the electron transfer. After the combination of TiO2 and CQDs, the electrons can be transferred from the CQDs to TiO2. The CQDs, as electron acceptors, absorb photoinduced electrons which were generated from the phase-mixed TiO2 surface and the existence of the disordered layer, resulting in the inhibition of the recombination of photo-generated electrons. At the same time, because there is a small amount of interface between the two phases of TiO2, it will improve the lifetime of the photo-generated charge carriers.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized CST-H2 samples with different amounts of CQDs. These samples have efficient activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under AM 1.5 light irradiation, especially the 0.5% CST-H2 sample. The formation of a disordered layer may improve the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency. Moreover, the reasons that the electron–hole pair recombination rate decreases and the lifetime of charges increases, are not only the introduction of CQDs, but also the existence of the mixed phases of TiO2. Therefore our work presents a new method to synthesize CQD modified TiO2 materials that have enhanced photocatalytic properties.
