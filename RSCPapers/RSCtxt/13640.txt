    , Accepted 15th May 2017First published on 1st June 2017AbstractSolution-processable organic metal halide compounds, such as methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3), possess unique optical and electronic properties such as long carrier lifetimes and high charge carrier mobility. Here we study a layered, 2-dimensional hybrid halide compound: methylammonium lead thiocyanate iodide ((CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2). Films deposited from solution are observed to grow with strong preferential alignment of 2-dimensional layers parallel to the substrate. The charge-transport properties of carriers in the 2-dimensional planes of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 were measured using the contactless electronic characterization technique time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC). TRMC measurements show that the sum of the electron and hole charge carrier mobilities in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 is above 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and that the carrier lifetime is relatively long.
Introduction
Solution-processable, earth-abundant organic metal halide materials possess optoelectronic properties that are, by many metrics, extraordinary.1–16 Hybrid organic metal-halide, Pb-based compounds with the general perovskite formula ABX3 are strong absorbers in the visible and near-infrared portion of the solar spectrum,7,17 have high charge-carrier mobilities,12,18 exhibit carrier-diffusion lengths on the order of microns,5,6 display an unusually low concentration7,19 of energetically shallow12 electronic traps states, and demonstrate evidence of photon recycling.15 Lab-scale solar cells based on methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) (see Fig. 1(a)) and other related compounds have been reported with certified power conversion efficiencies in excess of 22%;20 fast approaching that of monocrystalline silicon,21,22 making them competitive with existing thin film materials such as CdTe.23 Despite these breakthroughs and following intense research, questions related to the stability of these materials and their fundamental properties must be answered before widespread commercialization of these systems can take place.24–27 For this reason, the incentive to identify alternative materials with similar optoelectronic properties is considerable.28–41

The range of 3-dimensional hybrid-halide perovskites is relatively limited,29–32 owing to the size constraint of the A-site, which facilitates just two organic cations (when the B site is Pb2+, Sn2+): methylammonium (CH3NH3) and formamidinium (HC(NH2)2), and inorganic counterions such as Cs+. However, there are now a number of notable reports of other hybrid-halide material classes with interesting properties, including “perovskite-like” structures such as defect perovskites,33 double-perovskites,39,40 perovskite-related materials with bismuth and antimony,36,37 and hybrid-halide compounds utilizing functional organic cations.41 It has been long known that by reducing the dimensionality of the corner-connected perovskite structure, the size constraint on the organic cation molecule can be relaxed, enabling a larger range of molecules to be employed.42 By controlling the number of perovskite layers35,43,44 or the orientation45 in such layered compounds a range of optical and electronic properties have been observed. Ruddlesden–Popper hybrid-halide compounds for example34,35,38 have shown remarkable stability and sustained performance in single junction solar cells due to preferential film growth orientation.38
In this report, we study an alternative strategy to form 2-dimensional hybrid-halide compounds. Instead of replacing the cation molecule, some of the halide atoms can be substituted with pseudo-halides, as in the case of the compound methylammonium lead thiocyanate iodide: (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 (see Fig. 1(b)).46–56 This is a 2-dimensional analog of CH3NH3PbI3, where the halide anion I− is substituted with the pseudo-halide thiocyanate (SCN)− in the axial sites of the Pb octahedra. We employ time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) to study the charge transport properties of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2. Because this compound is a layered 2-dimensional structure rather than a 3-dimensional perovskite, one can anticipate significant differences in the optical and charge-transport properties from CH3NH3PbI3.44,51,56,57
TRMC is a local technique that probes the combined charge-carrier generation and transport properties of a material, without the need for a continuous film,12,58–72 hence providing a probe of material properties independent of its behavior in a device. The extracted figure of merit ϕΣμ, and lifetime τ, serve as reliable proxies for potential charge-extraction performance in solar cells.12,73 By applying the TRMC technique to (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2, we are able to identify long lived-carriers with mobilities of ∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1, as has previously been observed for fully-halogenated layered organic metal halides.44
Results and discussion
We grew films of CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 on quartz substrates from solution via known solvent-annealing techniques.51,74,75 Optical micrographs are shown in Fig. 1(c and d) for CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 respectively, demonstrating the semi-continuous nature of the (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 films over large areas. Scanning electron microscope images of CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 are shown in Fig. 1(e and f) respectively. The lateral dimensions of the grains determined by image analysis are approximately 200 nm for CH3NH3PbI3, comparable to films grown under similar conditions,70 and 2 μm for (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2. The size of grains in films of CH3NH3PbI3 are known to be highly-dependent on growth-conditions70,75,76 and we have not examined protocols to produce micron-sized76 grains of CH3NH3PbI3 for the purposes of this study.
The optical properties of the films were determined using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (see Fig. 2). The absorption spectrum of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 is clearly blue-shifted with respect to the 3-dimensional perovskite, as expected for a 2-dimensional analogue.51,77 There is a clear exciton peak in the two-dimensional material at 554 nm (2.24 eV), and the spectrum is in general agreement with those previously reported.51,53 Photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements were also carried out on these films, again in agreement with previous reports56 (see Section S5, ESI†).

The structural purity and preferential-alignment of the (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 films were examined using X-ray diffraction. Fig. 3(a) shows normalized experimental XRD spectra of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 grown on a quartz, scrapped off the surface with a razor blade, then ground into a powder, and of a pristine (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 film. Calculated spectra of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 with preferential orientation in the [100], [010] and [001] directions as well as no preferential orientation (isotropic) are additionally shown. We see that, as expected, the powder scraped off the substrate shows a spectrum closely matching that of isotropic (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2. The spectrum of the film of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 appears to closely match that with preferential orientation in the [100] direction, i.e. with 2-dimensional planes parallel to the substrate. We do not observe the presence of CH3NH3PbI3 in films of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2, and the same experimental data is plotted with a logarithmic y-axis scale in the Section S2 (ESI†) to illustrate purity.

Fig. 3(b) shows a rocking curve taken at the 200 peak of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2. The full-width at half maximum of the rocking curve is 515 arcseconds, a value that is indicative of a polycrystalline film that is highly textured along the 100 direction.
When reducing the dimensionality of a system, one can generally expect to observe a wider band-gap in a 2-dimensional system than its 3-dimensional counterpart.57,77,78 The exact details of the electronic structure of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 are currently under debate with respect to the experimentally observed optical absorption spectrum,50,51 but the band structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) indicates the compound has a nearly direct band gap of ∼2.1 eV, with a marginally smaller indirect gap of ∼2.05 eV.51 The band structure reported51 from DFT yields effective masses parallel to the 2-dimensional sheets in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 are mh* = 0.99me and me* = 0.88me in the [010] direction and mh* = 2.36me and me* = 0.34me in the [001] direction, where me is the rest mass of an electron in vacuo. For comparison, the effective masses of carriers in CH3NH3PbI3 are reported to be between 0.1me and 0.3me.79 However, the band diagram is very flat in the [100] direction between layers in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2, suggesting that carriers are highly confined to the 2-dimensional planes and that transport between layers would occur by hopping conduction.
To study the electronic properties of this compound we employed time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC).58,64 The geometry of our TRMC system enables us to measure the mobility of charge carriers moving perpendicular to the propagation direction of the incident optical photons and hence in the plane of the film and, based on orientation extracted from XRD, in the planes of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 layers. The energy of incident photons (2.33 eV) is in excess of the band gap of both CH3NH3PbI3 (∼1.5 eV)19 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 (∼2.0 eV)51 so carriers are generated by band-to-band transitions in both systems. Thermalization of hot carriers is known to take place on the order of ∼ps6 to ∼100 ps80 in hybrid halide compounds, which, despite being slower than in organic bulk heterojunctions for example,81,82 is faster than the timescale of TRMC measurements, defined by the response of the cavity and width of laser pulse (∼ns). Hence, we can be confident that the values of ϕΣμ extracted are representative of relaxed carriers. Our excitation energy is higher than the exciton binding energy of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2; therefore initially formed electron–hole pairs can recombine to the ground state, or to form excitonic states upon relaxation. Nonetheless we expect the carrier yield to be lower in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 than in CH3NH3PbI3.
The effective masses calculated for (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2,51 while higher than CH3NH3PbI3,79 suggest that in-plane charge transport should result in a mobility comparable to other solution processable semiconductors. Fig. 4 shows TRMC plots (ϕΣμ as a function of time) for a film of (a) CH3NH3PbI3 and (b) (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 at a high fluence of 1.6 × 1014 photons cm−2. The TRMC figure of merit (ϕΣμ) is the product of the charge-carrier generation efficiency ϕ, and the sum of the electron and hole mobilities: Σμ = μe + μh. At this fluence of 1.6 × 1014 photons cm−2, the maximum value of ϕΣμ is approximately 0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 for CH3NH3PbI3 and 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2. Fig. 4(c) shows TRMC plots for (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 under various fluences, with a logarithmic y-axis scale.

The samples were illuminated with green light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with emission frequency of 532 nm and a full-width at half maximum of 5 ns. The films were measured in ambient air conditions at room temperature. The applied microwave power and frequency were 16 dBm and 8.35 GHz, respectively. Insets: structures of CH3NH3PbI3 (a) and (b) (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2. 

Fig. 5(a) shows peak values ϕΣμ for CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 at various fluences. A minimum fluence of 1.1 × 1011 cm−2 and 2.8 × 1012 cm−2 were studied for the CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 films respectively. These values represent the respective instrument limits for the two films. Because the film coverage was better in the former case, the signal-to-noise ratio was higher, and the measurement range was larger. Extraction of the sum of the mobility of the carriers from the peak value of ϕΣμ is dependent on knowledge of the number of carriers in the sample generated by the light pulse, and is affected by the yield and recombination prior to detection of the transient. The yield of carriers will depend on the exciton binding energy, and the yield is known to decrease with lower dimensionality in layered hybrid-halide compounds.44 In the 2-dimensional compound, (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2, the exciton binding energy is reported to be approximately 200 meV,53 while the value for the 3-dimensional perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 is known to be ∼5–60 meV.83–85 The relatively strong signal in our TRMC data is consistent with ionization of the carriers in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2. We can consider a simple model that the rate of ionization of excitons will vary with the exciton binding energy (Eb) as ∼ν0exp(−Eb/kbT) where ν0 is an attempt frequency. At room temperature with the reported Eb of ∼200 meV,53 the rate is expected to be ∼108 to 109 s−1 assuming typical pre-factors of 1012 to 1013 s−1. This frequency is much larger than the observed recombination rate of the carriers suggesting that ionization can be relatively facile or that there are long lived excitations in this material (vide infra).56 Overall, we expect the room-temperature value of ϕ in the lower-dimensional (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 to be lower than that in CH3NH3PbI3,44 which would only increase the observed sum of the carrier mobilities.
 Fig. 5  (a) Maximum value of ϕΣμ extracted from TRMC plots and (b) time constant obtained by taking a weighted average of two single exponential fits to two regions of the TRMC plots, as a function of fluence. The samples were illuminated with green light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with emission frequency of 532 nm and a full-width at half maximum of 5 ns. The films were measured in ambient air conditions at room temperature. The applied microwave power and frequency were 16 dBm and 8.35 GHz, respectively. 
The peak values of ϕΣμ decrease with increasing fluence, a phenomenon widely observed in TRMC experiments.12,62,64,86–92 At higher fluence, and hence high charge-carrier densities, higher order (e.g. bi-molecular and Auger) recombination processes during the ∼ns laser pulse also affect the peak value of ϕΣμ (ϕΣμmax).88,93,94 A consequence of this recombination is a reduction in the observed value of ϕΣμmax with increasing fluence.12Fig. 5(a) shows ϕΣμmax as a function of fluence for CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2, with values reaching ∼2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the latter, at the lowest fluence examined. At low fluence (roughly ≤1013 cm−12) higher order recombination processes (bimolecular and Auger) are no longer dominant, and a roughly fluence-independent ϕΣμmax for CH3NH3PbI3 is observed. It is anticipated that at a lower fluence (beyond that of our instrument resolution), ϕΣμmax for (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 should also reach a maximum, fluence-independent, value. The difference in the incident fluence at which ϕΣμmax makes the transition from being fluence-dependent to fluence-independent for CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 is attributed to the differences in the bimolecular and Auger rate constants expected with dimensionality in hybrid-halide compounds.44
We observe that ϕΣμmax for (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 is a factor of 2 to 4 lower than that of a thin film of CH3NH3PbI3 at fluences >1013 cm−2. We do not know the precise carrier density as a function of fluence because the carrier yield is likely lower in the layered compound,44 precluding a direct comparison of the sum of the mobilities in the 3D and layered compounds. Our values of ϕΣμmax as a function of fluence for CH3NH3PbI3 agree relatively well with those reported in the literature for comparable grain size and incident fluence,12,71,95 and repeated measurements on separate films illustrate our techniques are consistent (see Section S4, ESI†). The mobility in CH3NH3PbI3 films has been shown to depend on the grain size and processing conditions,13 with a plateau in ϕΣμmax, by TRMC, at large grain sizes and at low incident fluence.70 The grain size between films formed of the two compounds here are significantly different (see Fig. 1(e and f)). Our films of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 have grain sizes comparable to those reported in the plateau region for the mobility of CH3NH3PbI3, while our films of CH3NH3PbI3 are lower than the reported plateau. For comparison, the reported value of ϕΣμ for films of CH3NH3PbI3 with micron scale grains was ∼25 cm2 V−1 s−1 at low fluence,70 and ∼11 to 25 cm2 V−1 s−1 from a different lab for 500 nm to micron scale grains at a fluence of ∼1012 cm−2.95 While our maximum value of ϕΣμ for (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 is lower than this (∼2 cm2 V−1 s−1), we have not completely eliminated the contribution of carrier recombination to the peak value. A comparable figure of merit (∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1) was found for the fully halogenated layer compound, (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4 (phenethylammonium lead iodide) by THz spectroscopy.44
We observe long-lived carriers in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2, similar to observations in CH3NH3PbI3.12 The lifetime τ, of carriers is determined by a number of processes (monomolecular, bimolecular and Auger),85 that have different relative contributions at different carrier concentrations. For this reason, unambiguously extracting a single decay parameter from TRMC transients is challenging.71 As described in the Section S3 (ESI†), we have here estimated the carrier lifetime by fitting single exponential functions to 2 regions of the TRMC decay curves and taking a weighted average of the two, in an analogous approach to previous reports.71Fig. 5(b) shows the lifetime τ, of carriers in films of CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2. τ is observed to be approximately constant with incident fluence at high values and increases at lower values for CH3NH3PbI3 – indicative of the presence of higher-order processes at higher fluence. As is evident from Fig. 4(c), there exists a very long-lifetime, signal in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 that does not decay sufficiently on our experimentally accessible timescale to determine a decay constant. For this reason, and to avoid ambiguity in extracting parameters, we have only estimated τ for this compound at high fluence where bimolecular recombination is likely the dominant process, and the transient can be fit with confidence to an exponential decay. Our values are substantially longer than the monomolecular lifetime for (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbI4 found by THz spectroscopy of ∼1 ns.44 A key difference here, other than the change in coordination at the Pb atom, is the reduced layer spacing in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2. We attribute the existence of long-lived carriers to ionization of long-lived states, but whether the origin is the reduced layer spacing, which modifies the dielectric coupling between layers,96 or the coordination of Pb is not clear at present. There is evidence for long-lived states in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 assigned to triplet states and we observed emission from our films in agreement with those observations (Fig. S6, ESI†).56 A recent study has also suggested generation from edge states in fully halogenated layered materials.38 In either case, the behavior here differs from that in previously examined 2-D layered organic metal halides.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have studied the electronic properties of a 2-dimensional layered hybrid-halide compound formed by halide substitution. We grew thin films of the 3-dimensional perovskite: methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) and the 2-dimensional layered compound: methylammonium lead thiocyanate iodide ((CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2). Solution-deposited films of ((CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2) were observed to form with layers highly-aligned parallel to the substrate. The yield-mobility product of charge-carriers moving in plane were observed to be comparable for CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 and the carriers had relatively long lifetimes. This illustrates the potential promise of lower-dimensional hybrid-halide compounds. With respect to application in solar cells, the band gap (∼2 eV) of (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 would likely limit its use to tandem or front cells. However, we anticipate (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 will be attractive for short-wavelength (blue/ultraviolet) lateral photodetector applications, and in thin-film transistors,79,97,98 where carriers largely travel parallel to the substrate. Thin-film transistors based on CH3NH3PbI3 are known to be highly susceptible to ionic-screening,97 but the isolated layers in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2, could inhibit ionic screening mechanisms and potentially enable such devices to operate with high carrier mobilites at room temperature.99,100
Experimental
Methylammonium iodide synthesis
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was prepared following the common method101 by an acid–base reaction of HI with the amine CH3NH2. For 2 g of product, HI (1.74 mL, 13.2 mmol, 1.05 eq., 57% in aqueous solution, 99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich) in anhydrous ethanol (2 mL, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) was slowly dropped into a solution of CH3NH2 (1.57 mL, 12.6 mmol, 1.00 eq. 33% solution in absolute ethanol, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) at 0 °C. After stirring for 30 min at room temperature, the excess solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The remaining precipitation was recrystallized twice from a hot ethanol/water mixture and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 1 h to give white crystals. The phase purity was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (data not shown).
Lead thiocyanate synthesis
Lead thiocyanate was synthesized following reported procedure.102 Summarized, 500 mL of 1 M lead nitrate [Pb(NO3)2] (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) was added in 50 mL aliquots with moderate stirring to 136 mL of 10 M ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%). These reagent solutions were made at room temperature, filtered, then cooled in an ice bath prior to combining. This chilled combined solution was allowed to stir for 30 minutes. White precipitate settled out after mixing which was washed via decantation with ice cooled deionized (DI) water. The crude Pb(SCN)2 was then dissolved in boiling DI water at a ratio of approximately 100 grams of lead thiocyanate to 3000 mL DI water, hot filtered, and then slowly cooled. White prismatic crystals were collected via vacuum filtration and then dried under vacuum overnight. This product was stored in a dry glove box but can be kept in a desiccator with no issues.
Methylammonium lead iodide thin-film preparation
Lead iodide (PbI2) and CH3NH3I were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio then dissolved in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and γ-butyrolactone (3:7 by volume). The solution was left stirring overnight at 60 °C before deposition. Films were spin-cast under atmospheric-pressure N2 at 5000 rpm. In order to drive out solvent, chlorobenzene was applied to the sample a few seconds before the spin-casting procedure was complete, as reported elsewhere.74,75,97 The films were then annealed at 110 °C for 10 minutes under atmospheric-pressure N2. CH3NH3I was synthesized as described as described above and PbI2 was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All film preparation was conducted in an N2-filled glovebox with sub-ppm oxygen and moisture levels.
Methylammonium lead thiocyanate iodide thin-film preparation
A 2:1 molar ratio of methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and lead thiocyanate (Pb(SCN)2) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at a concentration of 700 mg mL−1. The resultant solution was left to stir at 60 °C for at least three hours prior to film deposition. Films were spin-cast at 2000 rpm with a subsequent drying spin of 5000 rpm. To ensure complete removal of DMF, diethyl ether (Et2O) was applied to film at the conclusion of the final spin cycle, as reported earlier.51 Samples were annealed at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to any characterization measurements. Precursor materials (CH3NH3I and Pb(SCN)2) were synthesized as described above; anhydrous DMF and Et2O were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All film preparation was conducted in an N2-filled glovebox with sub-ppm oxygen and moisture levels.
Film thickness measurements
The average thickness of spin-cast films of CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 were evaluated using a Bruker Dektak XT profilometer. Films were deposited as described above onto quartz substrates. Valleys were formed in the films by scratching with carbon-tipped tweezers. The film thickness was then measured in 20 different positions for each film. The average and standard deviations of each film were then evaluated to be: CH3NH3PbI3: 120 ± 10 nm and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2: 2.3 ± 1.9 μm.
Optical microscopy
Optical microscope images of films of CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 were taken using an Olympus BH2 optical microscope. Measurements were made in transmission mode with various exposure times.
Scanning electron microscopy
Scanning electron microscope images were obtained using an FEI Nova NanoSEM 650, with a 10 keV beam and a spot size of 3.0. Films of CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 were deposited onto polished, highly-doped (n++) silicon.
X-ray diffraction
X-ray diffraction patterns were measured using a Panalytical Empyrean powder diffractometer with a copper Kα source (films were of large enough thickness to measure adequate signal in Bragg–Brentano geometry). The rocking curve was measured on a Panalytical MRD PRO diffractometer (Cu-Kα) at the Bragg condition corresponding to the 200 peak of (CH3NH3)Pb(SCN)2I2. Powder XRD patterns were simulated using the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS), with a calibration file specific to our instrument and structure factors taken from a solved single-crystal. Oriented diffraction patterns were simulated using March–Dollase preferred orientation correction factors of 0.5.103
Ultra-violet-visible absorption spectroscopy
Films of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) and methylammonium lead thiocyanate iodide ((CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2) were grown as described above. Measurements were carried out using a Shimadzu UV-2600 ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer.
Photoluminescence measurements
Films of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) and methylammonium lead thiocyanate iodide ((CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2) were grown as described above. Photoluminescnece measurements were carried out on a Horiba FluoroMax 4 spectrometer calibrated using Milli-Q water. Films were loaded into a thin-film sample stage angled between the excitation and emission port.
Time-resolved microwave conductivity experiment
A diagrammatic illustration of the time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) system is shown in Fig. 6. A microwave-frequency oscillatory electric signal is generated using a Sivers IMA VO4280X/00 voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). The signal has an approximate power of 16 dBm and a tunable frequency between 8 GHz and 15 GHz. The oscillatory signal is then directed through coaxial cables to port 1 of an electronic circulator (Fairview Microwave SFC0712). The circulator acts as uni-directional device in which signals entering from port 1 exit through port 2 and signals entering from port 2 exit through port 3. The signal exiting the circulator from port 2 is then fed into a SMA to X-band waveguide adapter (purchased on eBay but similar to Fairview Microwave part 90AC206). This antenna is coupled to X-band cavity (purchased on eBay) using a homebuilt coupling iris and tuning screw fabricated from a thin aluminum plate. The cavity is a TE103 mode formed by a short section of X-band waveguide and a homemade slotted copper plate (slots along the direction of current) that allows optical access to the sample. The antenna emits electromagnetic radiation (microwaves) which form a standing wave in the cavity. The tuning screw enabled over-, critical-, and under-coupling to the cavity and all experiments were performed in the under-coupled regime. The sample is mounted inside the cavity at a maximum of the electric-field component of the standing microwaves. Microwaves reflected from the cavity are then incident on port 2 of the circulator, exiting through port 3. Microwaves emitted from port 3 of the circulator – the power reflected from the cavity and sample – are then directed into a zero-bias Schottky diode detector (Fairview Microwave SMD0218 operating in the linear regime). The rectified signal is amplified by a homebuilt DC-coupled, wide-band amplifier built around a Texas Instruments THS3091 operational amplifier (battery powered, three stages of amplification). We note that the microwave power is split at the source allowing a second detector and amplification stage to monitor/normalize the reflected power from the cavity. The amplified signal (and reference) is detected by a Textronix TDS 3032C digital oscilloscope. A Minilite Continuum pulsed Nd:YaG laser is used to illuminate the sample. The laser pulse has a wavelength of 532 nm, a full-width at half-maxima of approximately 5 nm and a maximum fluence of 1015 cm−2. An external trigger link is employed to trigger the oscilloscope 50 ns before the laser fires. The area exposed to the incident optical pulse is approximately 10% of the cross-sectional area of the cavity. Changes in the detector voltage under illumination can then be used to extract the relevant TRMC parameters; ϕΣμ and τ, as described in Section S1 (ESI†). The films were measured in ambient air conditions at room temperature, immediately after being removed from the glovebox. The total measurement time was <2 hours for a fluence-dependent sweep. Carrying out the sweep from high to low fluence vs. low to high fluence, yielded no difference in behavior. This suggests that neither degradation in air over this period, nor damage due to the laser were significant in our study. TRMC measurements conducted on encapsulated films exhibited no significant difference from those carried out under ambient conditions.
 Fig. 6  Schematic representation of time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) system. A microwave-frequency (∼8–9 GHz) electrical signal is generated by voltage controlled oscillator (labeled VCO). The electrical signal is directed into port 1 of the circulator through coaxial cables. The incident signal exits the circulator via terminal 2 and enters the antenna in the microwave cavity. The oscillatory signal in antenna emits microwaves into the cavity which form a standing wave (electric field component only shown for clarity). A sample is placed into the cavity at one of the maxima of the standing electric field. Free carriers within the sample absorb microwaves, resulting in an attenuation in the reflected microwave signal. The reflected microwave-frequency electrical signal then exits the circulator from terminal 3, where it is directed into the detection circuit. Carriers are created in the sample using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with emission frequency of 532 nm and full-width at half maximum of 5 ns.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a and b) Crystal structure of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) and methylammonium lead thiocyanate iodide ((CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2) respectively. Purple spheres represent iodine atoms, green octahedra surround lead atoms, brown spheres represent carbon atoms, grey spheres nitrogen atoms, yellow spheres represent sulfur, and white spheres hydrogen atoms. (c and d) Optical microscope images of CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 films deposited onto quartz substrates, respectively. (e and f) Scanning electron microscope images of CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 film surfaces, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  Optical absorption spectra of films of methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) and methylammonium lead thiocyanate iodide ((CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Experimental and calculated XRD spectra of various forms of methylammonium lead thiocyanate iodide ((CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2). “Film (Exp)” labels the experimentally measured spectrum of a thin film, “[hkl] (Calc)” labels the calculated spectra with preferential growth in the labelled direction, “Isotropic (Calc)” labels the calculated spectrum with no preferential growth direction and “Powder (Exp)” labels the spectrum obtained experimentally from a powder scraped off a thin film and ground up. (b) Normalized rocking curve of 200 diffraction peak in (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 (along the plane stacking direction). The full-width at half-maximum was extracted to be 515 arcseconds.	 

 	Fig. 4  Example time resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) plots; ϕΣμ as a function of time, for films of (a) methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) and (b) methylammonium lead thiocyanate iodide ((CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2) at a fluence of 1.6 × 1014 photons cm−2. (c) 4 example TRMC plots for (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 at various fluences, plotted with a logarithmic y-axis scale. The samples were illuminated with green light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with emission frequency of 532 nm and a full-width at half maximum of 5 ns. The films were measured in ambient air conditions at room temperature. The applied microwave power and frequency were 16 dBm and 8.35 GHz, respectively. Insets: structures of CH3NH3PbI3 (a) and (b) (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Maximum value of ϕΣμ extracted from TRMC plots and (b) time constant obtained by taking a weighted average of two single exponential fits to two regions of the TRMC plots, as a function of fluence. The samples were illuminated with green light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with emission frequency of 532 nm and a full-width at half maximum of 5 ns. The films were measured in ambient air conditions at room temperature. The applied microwave power and frequency were 16 dBm and 8.35 GHz, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 6  Schematic representation of time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) system. A microwave-frequency (∼8–9 GHz) electrical signal is generated by voltage controlled oscillator (labeled VCO). The electrical signal is directed into port 1 of the circulator through coaxial cables. The incident signal exits the circulator via terminal 2 and enters the antenna in the microwave cavity. The oscillatory signal in antenna emits microwaves into the cavity which form a standing wave (electric field component only shown for clarity). A sample is placed into the cavity at one of the maxima of the standing electric field. Free carriers within the sample absorb microwaves, resulting in an attenuation in the reflected microwave signal. The reflected microwave-frequency electrical signal then exits the circulator from terminal 3, where it is directed into the detection circuit. Carriers are created in the sample using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with emission frequency of 532 nm and full-width at half maximum of 5 ns.
