    , Accepted 2nd July 2017First published on 4th July 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic halide perovskites have attracted a lot of interest for applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors and lasers. As this group of materials is highly sensitive to moisture and oxygen, a simple in situ controlled synthesis of these nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer matrix will open up the possibility for a wide range of light-emitting and color-conversion applications. This paper presents a simple in situ approach for controlled synthesis of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite NPs as a function of halide composition in polymer matrix (polymethyl methacrylate, PMMA). Chemical mapping using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) shows a varying of size distribution of the lead halide perovskite NPs. Mixed halide NP in PMMA were composed of grains of different compositions. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) correlated with compositional information from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) provides evidence for the role of surfaces and grain boundaries on charge recombination in the nanoparticles. The annealing temperature and the molar ratio of the precursors were found to greatly affect the morphology and composition of the perovskite NP in polymer matrix.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have recently attracted considerable interest due to their unique optical and excitonic properties and electrical conductivity.1–5 Recently, a few groups found high photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiencies leading to coherent light emission in solution-processed pristine films of organic–inorganic halide perovskites.6–9 The light-emitting diodes based on such films exhibited high external quantum efficiency (EQE) approaching 9%.10,11 Tan et al. demonstrated the great promise of using organometal halide-based perovskites in large-area electrically pumped lasing applications and thus optoelectronics.9 In addition, the low-temperature solution processing of organic–inorganic perovskites is highly compatible with unconventional flexible substrates, printing technologies and monolithic integration with silicon-based electronics. However, due to the weak van der Waals interactions between the organic and inorganic components, they are extremely sensitive to atmospheric moisture.1,12–14 Burschka et al. concluded that device fabrication should be carried out at a humidity below 1%12 while Niu et al. found that perovskite films tend to degrade to PbI2 in a high humidity environment.13 Deng et al. found that the quenching of PL in the pre-moisturized sample (RH ∼ 85%) is immediate and this process occurs rapidly upon biasing.15 Although humidity is reported to affect the long-term stability of perovskite film, controlled amount of moisture is one of the prerequisites to obtain high photoluminescence and thereby a high power conversion efficiency in perovskite devices.16,17 Eperon et al. proposed that the controlled moisture environment during film preparation reduces trap states in the films.17
In general, the poor air stability of perovskites can prevent their widespread applications and remedies for their moisture sensitivity thus need to be developed. One solution is to protect the perovskite film with an overlayer of a hydrophobic polymer film to impede moisture permeation.18–20 The perovskite nanoparticles (NPs), once formed using this synthetic route, are embedded in the polymer matrix and isolated from air and moisture, and thus the degradation of the NPs can be suppressed. This method allows the control of the nucleation and growth of the perovskite NPs. It can also lead to improved dispersion of perovskite NPs in the polymer matrix.3,14
In this work, we demonstrate a simple in situ controlled synthesis route for organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite NPs in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. The advantage of this in situ synthesis method is the formation of protected NPs highly suitable for a range of luminescence applications. We chose PMMA due to its hydrophobicity. The coating of PMMA or other polymer layer on organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite film has been previously shown to improve its air stability.21 The preparation, crystal structure and optical properties of our organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite NPs within polymer matrices are presented.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.99%), lead(II) chloride (PbCl2, anhydrous, 99.999%), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.999%), methylamine solution (MA solution, 33 wt% in absolute ethanol), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 wt% in water), hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48 wt% in water), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water, 99.99%), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, Mw ∼ 120000), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%), diethyl ether (99.9%, inhibitor-free) and chlorobenzene (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Synthesis of MAX (X = Cl, Br or I). 
Methylammonium chloride (MACl), bromide (MABr) or iodide (MAI) were synthesized by reacting the methylamine solutions with HCl, HBr or HI aqueous solutions, respectively. This is an exothermic reaction which has to be carried out inside a fume hood. In detail, 30 mL of MA solution reacted with 20 mL of HCl, 25 mL of HBr or 30 mL of HI solution at 0 °C for 2 h with constant stirring to synthesize MAX. Precipitation of MAX was achieved using a rotary evaporator at 50 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was washed 5–8 times with diethyl ether until a colorless solution was obtained and then dried under vacuum. After that, the MAX was stored inside a nitrogen glovebox (oxygen and water levels <10 ppm).


Synthesis of methylammonium lead halide perovskite NPs in the polymer matrix. 
Typically, PMMA (0.22 g) powder was added to a pre-dissolved solution containing the as-synthesized MAX (0.2 mmol) and PbX2 (0.2 mmol) in 3.35 mL of DMF. The above solution was stirred overnight on a hotplate at 60 °C. Microscope glass slides were washed with acetone, IPA and DI water. They were subsequently treated with an alkaline piranha solution (DI H2O:ammonia:H2O2 = 1:1:5 by volume, also called standard clean I) to make them hydrophilic. After that, they were dried with nitrogen gas before use. The film uniformity was greatly improved if the glass substrate was treated with the alkaline piranha solution prior to spin coating with the solution of perovskite precursors and polymer. Perovskite NPs matrix films were prepared by spin-coating (600 rpm, 90 s) followed by annealing on a hotplate at 130 °C for 20 min. An additional PMMA layer was spin-coated (1500 rpm, 90 sec) on top of the above film using a mixture of PMMA (0.15 g) in chlorobenzene (1.5 mL) followed by annealing at 130 °C for 3 min. This layer prevents any perovskite nanoparticles from being exposed to air and is thus referred to as the PMMA protection layer. The spin-coating and annealing steps were done in the nitrogen glovebox. Subsequently, the samples were tested in air. The effect of annealing temperature, annealing time and the molar ratio of MAX to PbX2 were studied.


Preparation of pure methylammonium lead halide perovskite film. 
The reaction conditions were almost identical to those above for the nanoparticle synthesis. The only difference is the absence of PMMA in the initial solution.

Characterization
Absorption spectra were measured using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV-Vis spectrometer with a 15 cm integrating sphere while the associated photoluminescence spectra (including those of stability studies) were obtained using a Horiba FluoroMax© 4 spectrometer with a 15 cm integrating sphere. The absorbance of the solids was determined using transmission-reflectance method. Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were performed using a photoluminescence confocal setup. The excitation wavelength was set to 405 nm for all PL tests. All experiments were carried out at room temperature and ambient conditions. Chemical mapping and imaging were done in FEI Titan 80-200 ChemiSTEM with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. TEM grids were used to pick up the solution and immediately annealed under the same conditions as for matrix film preparation. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X'Pert PRO PANalytical system from Phillips with CuKα irradiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using Digital Instruments (Nanoscope IIIa) in tapping mode. Film thicknesses were measured using an Alpha-Step profilometer (KLA-Tencor).
Results and discussion
In this study, methylammonium halides (MAX, where X is I, Br or Cl) are mixed with lead halides (PbX2) at a predefined molar ratio and with polymer in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Subsequently, the solution is spin-coated on a glass substrate and annealed at different temperatures to covert the precursors into the perovskite NPs in matrix (see schematic illustration in Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b shows a photo of the solutions of different precursor mixed with PMMA and photos of two types of perovskite film or matrix film: prepared with and without polymer added. All solutions containing iodide compounds appeared yellowish while the solutions containing bromide and chloride compounds appeared colorless. The color of the spin-coated films slowly changed in the nitrogen glovebox over time as the matrix films dried even before annealing. For example, the MAPbBr3 in polymer matrix changed from colorless to light yellow and then to orange over 5 min. This implies that the reaction between the precursors is already taking place at room temperature, although at a very slow rate. Subsequently the matrix were annealed to complete the reaction and form perovskite NPs in the polymer.

(b) Solutions of precursors (row I) and perovskite films without (row II) and with polymer matrix (row III) after annealing at 130 °C for 20 min. Row IV and V show samples from rows II and III, respectively, under UV excitation (λ = 365 nm). In row I: labels X–Y2 stand for MAXY2. 
In order to obtain well-crystallized perovskite NPs and to understand the structural transformation of the NPs in the polymer matrix, the effects of annealing temperature were first investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns from the matrices of MAPbI3 perovskite in PMMA annealed at temperatures of 80, 100, 130, 150, 170, 200 and 250 °C are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. We found that the bulk MAPbI3 film without PMMA added at room temperature showed a tetragonal phase (see Fig. 2). It can be seen from the XRD patterns that the matrix films annealed at 80 and 100 °C contain the mixed phases: tetragonal and unknown phase(s). Some peaks located at 21.00, 24.16 and 28.01° are not able to identify at this moment. These peaks may relate to precursors. Upon increasing the annealing temperature from 80 to 130 °C, three peaks mentioned above disappear while some peaks located at 14.11, 20.02, 23.50, 24.45, 31.86 and 42.79° corresponding to the (110), (020), (121), (022), (130) and (141) planes of tetragonal perovskite I4/mcm phase gradually appear. The calculated cell parameters for MAPbI3 NPs are a = 8.863(2) Å and c = 12.489(8) Å in agreement with previous reports.5,22,23 Although the cubic phase may be stable at higher temperatures, we did not observe the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transformation in this study. Therefore, the presence of the polymer matrix may be able to help in stabilizing the phase of the organic–inorganic perovskite NPs. When the annealing temperature is increased to 200 °C or above, new peaks at 12.70, 25.50 and 38.71° corresponding to PbI2 can be observed indicating partial decomposition of the perovskite. Thus, a moderate temperature of 130 °C is optimum as the annealing temperature to ensure a complete transformation to the single tetragonal phase and at the same time to prevent thermal decomposition of perovskite. This choice of temperature also satisfies a condition of annealing above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PMMA.

Both the crystal structure and the bandgap (Eg) of perovskite NPs in a PMMA depend on the molar ratio of MAX to lead halide in the precursor solution. For example, when the molar ratio of MAI to PbI2 was changed from 1:1 to 2:1, a few new peaks at around 24.0° appeared in XRD pattern (see Fig. S1a, ESI†). A further increase of the molar ratio from 2:1 to 3:1 resulted in two new peaks at 11.5 and 20.9° while the peaks at 20.1, 24.3, 40.6 and 43.2° disappeared. The appearance of new peaks may indicate the presence of a residual DMF-induced new phase in the final matrix film. The peaks that appear in the XRD pattern with increasing MAX:Pb ratio is not likely due to the MAI itself (see * marked in Fig. S1a, ESI†). This is consistent with previous studies of films without PMMA matrix which found that changes in the molar ratios will result in perovskite NPs of different compositions and structures.24 The band gaps of matrix films with molar ratios of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 are 1.58, 1.56 and 1.52 eV, respectively (see Fig. S1b, ESI†). We admit that the band gap of perovskite NPs matrix can also be affected by the ratio of MAI in the matrix since it has a big bandgap. However, our PL results showed that the matrices prepared with MAX:Pb ratios of 1:1 have the highest brightness. Based on those studies, matrices for subsequent detailed structural, chemical and optical studies were prepared from a solution of 60 mM of MAX and 60 mM of PbX2 in DMF containing 66 mg mL−1 polymer. The MAX:PbX2 molar ratio was 1:1 and after spin coating, the matrices were annealed at 130 °C for 20 min. The weight and volume percents of perovskite NPs in polymer are around 36% and 14% if all precursors convert to perovskite NPs during heating up.

Fig. 3, Fig. S2 (ESI†) and Table 1 summarize XRD patterns from all of our organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite NP matrices. It can be seen that most of the perovskite films, for example, MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3, are highly crystalline and show a single phase5,22,24–26 while a few of the mixed halide perovskite NPs matrices, for example MAPbBrI2, MAPbICl2 and MAPbClI2, contain more than one phase. The difference in the ionic radii of I− (2.06 Å), Br− (1.81 Å) and Cl− (1.67 Å) may account for the possibility of the formation of an inhomogeneous mixture. It is especially true for MAPbClI2, the difference between ionic radii of I− and Cl− is largest.24 A small peak at around 12.49–12.66° in some iodide-containing matrices is related to the PbI2 phase24 while peaks at 12.71 (14.15°) in some matrices are possibly related to the PbBr2 (or PbCl2) phase. The PbX2 (X = I, Br or Cl) “impurity” could be a sign that either a small amount of perovskite has degraded into PbX2 during annealing or the conversion to perovskite is incomplete. Further studies are needed to improve the purity of perovskite NPs.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns from MAPbIX2 NPs in PMMA after annealing at 130 °C for 20 min. Note that the perovskites are named after the starting precursors. This means that we added MAI and PbX2 in equal molar ratio to the solution. The dotted lines indicate the peak shifts. Peaks labeled with an asterisk originate from PbX2. 
We found that adding polymer greatly improves the film formation capability as well as film roughness and uniformity (see Fig. S3, ESI†). For example, a surface root mean square (RMS) roughness of matrix films of perovskite NPs in PMMA was measured to be 14 nm while that of film without PMMA is above 100 nm. Besides the improvement in film formation, the addition of PMMA was also found to improve the stability of MAPbX3 in air. Fig. 4 and Fig. S4 (ESI†) show the evolution of photoluminescence (PL) spectra and XRD patterns of MAPbI3 samples with and without any polymer over a 5-day air exposure (RH = 70–80%). In both cases, a drop in PL intensity was observed upon exposure to humid ambient, which is mainly attributed to: (1) the formation of non-radiative recombination channels due to structural defects, and (2) the transformation of perovskite phase into wider-band gap PbI2 phase (Eg ∼ 2.3 eV).28 However, the presence of PMMA appears to remarkably suppress the PL decay, i.e., while the pristine MAPbI3 showed no appreciable PL after one day, the polymer-protected sample still retained roughly more than 71% of the initial PL intensity and still exhibited weak PL intensity on the fifth day. The change in the optical properties of MAPbI3 correlates well with the structural data obtained from the XRD measurement. In the absence of PMMA, the moisture-induced degradation results in complete disappearance of the MAPbI3 perovskite peak (∼14.1°) after first day accompanied by the emergence of a new peak at ∼12.5° indicative of the PbI2 phase. In fact, the PbI2 peak at 12.71° (refer to Fig. 2) was already observed in day 0, suggesting a rapid degradation of the hybrid perovskite in air when removed from inert environment. Water molecules are able to assist the diffusion of the organic species away, leaving the inorganic cage behind. On the other hand, the MAPbI3 phase could still be detected on to day fifth of the study coexisting with the PbI2 phase. Although XRD pattern on the fifth day shows the presence of predominantly the perovskite phase, but the PL intensity drops to ∼14%. The possible reason is that the PbI2 phase or structural defects in matrix films quenches photoluminescence. This is probably a limit of perovskite NPs incorporation into polymer matrix. Similar decay trends for MAPbI3 NPs in PMMA were observed for the other measured systems: MAPbIBr2 and MAPbICl2 (see Fig. S5, ESI†). PMMA was able to impart better moisture stability in the mixed organic–inorganic perovskites. In the following discussion, we will look into the chemical composition of MAPbIX2 NPs in PMMA (X = I, Br or Cl) and how its variation affects the optical properties.
 Fig. 4  (a) Integrated PL intensity normalized to the initial value and (b) XRD patterns of MAPbI3 NPs in PMMA (solid balls) and without PMMA (solid squares) after 5-day exposure to humid ambient (RH = 70–80%). Note that the 405 nm wavelength excitation is not able to excite the PbI2 phase due to its wide band gap. 
Compositional uniformity was studied using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) which is able to provide chemical composition information with high sensitivity on a nanometer scale. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) maps together with simultaneously acquired high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images of MAPbIX2 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskite NPs in PMMA were collected and are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S6 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5, the morphology and distribution of elements is highly composition. All perovskites in PMMA contain large NPs (50–300 nm) in addition to a dense almost continuous background of small particles with a characteristic size of 9 ± 4 nm (see Fig. 5a–c and Fig. S6a–c, ESI†). MAPbI3 embedded in PMMA formed large NPs (114 ± 51 nm) (Fig. 5a) while MAPbIBr2 (Fig. 5b) and MAPbICl2 (Fig. 5c) in PMMA formed smaller (80 ± 21 and 88 ± 36 nm, respectively) particles due to the formation of a larger number of nucleation sites and in the latter case the lower solubility of PbCl2 in DMF.27 With better control of the matrix preparation (e.g. optimizing solvent drying, volume of cast solution, etc.), it should be possible to have a better control of NP size distribution and chemical composition, the latter is discussed in the next section.

The MAPbI3 and MAPbICl2 NPs in PMMA were found to be less uniform in size but more homogenous in composition. The MAPbICl2 NPs contain separate grains of MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 perovskite with the MAPbI3 grains having a thin platelet morphology. The small NPs in the background are mostly MAPbCl3. HAADF images of MAPbI3 NPs (Fig. S6a, ESI†) show that they are also composed of multiple grains. MAPbIBr2 is homogenous on the scale of the images (Fig. 5b), with mostly round NPs, but their surfaces are decorated with a number of small grains of MAPbI3. In contrast to MAPbICl2, for MAPbIBr2 the small NPs in the background are of mixed composition.
Based on the above results, we propose the following mechanism to illustrate the in situ perovskite NP formation: after spin-coating, the excess DMF slowly evaporates from the precursor film, while the Pb and X ions self-assemble to form layered PbX2 nuclei in the polymer matrix.29 After that, residual DMF molecules inside the wet film intercalate into the space between the layered PbX2 and CH3NH3X.29 This results in an expansion of the space between the adjacent layers and the formation of a DMF-induced intermediate phase. However, further growth of layered PbX2 nuclei is hindered by the availability of precursors and the presence of stiff hydrophobic polymer chains in the film (TgPMMA: ∼110 °C). Later on, annealing of the film at 130 °C results in further DMF evaporation from the solid film including both the free DMF molecules in the film and the bonded-DMF molecules in the DMF-induced intermediate phase. This process results in the formation of perovskite nuclei from the reaction between CH3NH3+ and PbX2. The extended annealing process greatly improves the flexibility of the originally stiff amorphous PMMA chains, which along with heat-induced diffusion of the precursor ions in the polymer matrix, facilitates further growth of perovskite nuclei into larger NPs. Due to the depletion of precursor these perovskite nuclei have less chance to grow bigger. Thus, their nucleation and growth of perovskite nuclei tend to occur more locally. The presence of polymer might have inhibited uncontrolled perovskite precipitation and facilitated a more uniform NP distribution. Our synthesis process allows for a facile control of the film thickness (around 400–500 nm) and uniformity. It also opens up the possibility of particle size control through variation of perovskite precursor and polymer ratio for future studies. On top of that, the presence of the polymer also provides protection against environmental attack, which could lead to rapid film degradation. We noticed that the detailed mechanism of nanoparticle formation within the polymer domains is still disputed,30–32 recent studies suggest a reaction-diffusion controlled nucleation and growth process, which is initiated by the formation of small clusters that act as nucleation sites and subsequently grow and deplete reactant from the surrounding polymer matrix.31,32 The nanoparticle growth is then determined by the interplay of the homogeneity of precursor load, details of the nucleation and growth process, and the stabilization of nanoparticle surfaces by the surrounding polymer matrix. Very recently, Raja et al. demonstrated the good stability of using hydrophobic macroscale polymer matrices in synthesizing CsPbBr3 perovskite NPs.30

Fig. 6 shows a comparison between the PL spectra from the three MAPbIX2 perovskite NPs in PMMA matrix under excitation with a 405 nm laser. The PL spectra reflect the material composition determined by chemical mapping. The PL from the MAPbI3 sample consists of a single peak with an emission wavelength of 760 nm. The PL spectrum from MAPbICl2 show only one peak very close to, but at slightly shorter wavelength than that of MAPbI3. As discussed above, MAPbI3 and MAPbCl3 rich phases segregate in MAPbICl2 and the observed signal originates from the mostly-MAPbI3 NPs. The PL spectrum did not contain a signal near the bandgap of pure Cl perovskite (2.88 eV, 429 nm) but with an excitation laser of 405 nm (3.06 eV) and the very low detection efficiency of our system for wavelengths shorter than 440 nm, the PL signal might have been below the detection limit. The PL signal from MAPbICl2 in PMMA was very weak compared with the other films. The PL spectrum from MAPbIBr2 are more complex. There are two peaks in the spectrum while the composition of the NPs as observed by EDX (Fig. 5b) is rather uniform. The color of the NPs in EDX is not however completely uniform and apart from grains of mostly MAPbI3 (blue) that decorate the surface of the large NPs, one may identify Br3 (red) and IBr2 (pink) regions in the NPs. It is thus possible that the surface of core of the NP is decorated with multiple small grains of different composition. Perhaps there are small I- or Br rich domains, which contribute to the PL. Power-dependent PL spectra from MAPbIBr2 NPs matrices in PMMA (shown in Fig. S7, ESI†) shed more light on the origin of the peaks. At low power only one peak is present at 725 nm and when the power is increased, it is replaced with peaks at 601 nm and 731 nm. The peak at 601 nm increases faster than that of 731 nm perhaps as a result of saturation of emission from grains of the NPs emitting at 731 nm. Finally, at the highest laser power another peak at 672 nm emerges and dominates the spectra. The three peaks could be assigned to MAPbI3 rich (731 nm), MAPbBr3 rich (624 nm) and MAPbIBr2 (672 nm) mixed grains of the NPs. The appearance of the mixed MAPbIBr2 grain PL at high laser powers indicates that radiative recombination competes there with a very fast non-radiative recombination. Alternatively, it may be due to the laser heating effect assuming which is a reversible process.
 Fig. 6  Normalized PL signal from MAPbIX2 samples in PMMA. Black: MAPbI3, red: MAPbIBr2, green: MAPbICl2. Note that the 405 nm wavelength excitation will not excite the pure Cl perovskites. 
UV-Vis and PL spectra from the other NPs studied are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The PL spectra from some NPs, e.g. MAPbClBr2 or MAPbBr3, show the near band edge emission with a narrow (<40 nm) full width at half maximum (fwhm). The wavelength of the emission is as expected for a mixed halide perovskite. Two perovskites (MAPbBrI2 and MAPbCl3) showed a multi-edge absorption spectrum and a PL signal well below the first absorption edge. In the case of PL from MAPbIBr2 and MAPbClI2, the peak also appears at a shorter wavelength than that of the first absorption edge. This means that those perovskites contain different compositional phases. Based on the absorption and PL spectra, we can see that MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MAPbClBr2, and MAPbBrCl2 showed well-defined absorption and symmetric PL spectra and are thus potentially suitable for light-emission applications.6–9
Direct information about the dynamics of the photogenerated free carriers can be gained from a decay of photoluminescence following a pulse of excitation in time-resolved PL (TRPL). Carrier dynamics in the perovskites is a complex function of excitation power33 and can also be affected by longer term (minutes) photoinduced changes.34 In order to compare the samples, we thus measured the samples under the same excitation power scaled by absorption of the matrix film at the excitation laser wavelength of 405 nm. TRPL decay curves corresponding to the spectra in Fig. 6, measured at the peak emission wavelength for I-rich grains, are shown in Fig. 7. Due to complex carrier dynamics in perovskite, we chose to use the 1/e time as a measurement of the recombination rate. The slowest PL decay – characteristic of pure perovskite (1/e time = 6.6 ns) – is observed for MAPbI3 (see Fig. 7). The shorter time decay (3.3 ns) of PL from MAPbI3 NPs in PMMA is faster which can be explained by surface recombination in smaller nanocrystals present in PMMA. Since the diffusivity of carriers in perovskites is long and compared to the bulk sample, the size of perovskite NPs is very small, photocarriers can thus easily reach the surface and recombine at surface states.
 Fig. 7  Time evolution of the photoluminescence signal following a laser pulse at time zero for MAPbI3, MAPbIBr2 and MAPbICl2. 1/e times: 6.6 ns, I – 3.25 ns, Br – 1.33 ns, Cl – 0.12 ns (limited by t the instrument response function shown as a broken line). 
The decay rate of carriers at 730 nm (MAPbI3 rich phase) in MAPbIBr2 in PMMA is much faster than for pure MAPbI3 in PMMA consistent with the fact that the MAPbI3 rich phase grains are now much smaller. This may also mean that the presence of grain boundaries in MAPbBr3 rich and mixed perovskites constitutes another source of non-radiative radiation. The recombination time from MAPbI3 rich phase in MAPbICl2 in PMMA is so short that most of carriers must decay non-radiatively (it also showed the weakest PL signal). It is a direct consequence of the flat platelets geometry of these grains. Thus perovskite NPs with a single phase and less surface and grain boundary recombination are preferred for the light-emitting application. In addition, we also attempted to test the PLQY of the prepared films (after 5 h exposure in air) using an integrated sphere. We obtained 4.14 and <0.01% of PLQY for MAPbICl2 with and without polymer matrix. This showed another advantage using polymer matrix to protect perovskite NPs.
Conclusions
In summary, we report a simple in situ approach for the controlled synthesis of organic–inorganic halide perovskite NPs in a polymer matrix. We found that the annealing temperature and the molar ratio of the precursors used greatly affected the morphology and composition of the synthesized perovskite NP matrices. The presence of hydrophobic polymer was also found to improve the moisture stability of the perovskite NP matrices. STEM HAADF and EDX maps showed that the NP size distribution and composition were not uniform. Mixed halide NPs in PMMA were composed of grains of different composition. We propose that the solubility of PbX2 in DMF could greatly affect the availability of precursors for further growth of the initially formed nuclei. The miscibility between the polymer and the precursor materials could also affect the nucleation and growth. This suggests that the size, shape and distribution of NPs could be controlled by varying the ratio between the polymer and precursor materials, as well as by using different type of polymers. PL studies correlate very well with the STEM EDX compositional measurements. The combination of the two methods leads to the conclusion that perovskite NPs embedded in PMMA are susceptible to surface and grain interface non-radiative recombination so the design of NP matrices must aim at the formation of relative large and fully mixed (or fully separated) NPs. The enhancement in film uniformity, optical and structural properties may pave the path for large-area applications of this promising family of materials.
