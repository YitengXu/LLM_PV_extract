    , Accepted 11th June 2014First published on 17th July 2014AbstractIn this paper, the bromination of carbazole has been controlled and then subsequent mono, di, tri and tetra-bromocarbazoles have been subjected to Suzuki cross-coupling to yield a series of carbazole-tetraphenylethene (TPE) materials with varying numbers of peripheral TPE groups. Accompanied by 2,7-dibromo-carbazole, five new Cz-TPE materials are successfully synthesized. All the Cz-TPEs are non-fluorescent in THF and emit strong blue-green fluorescence in aggregate states (fw = 90%) and thin films because of their aggregation induced emission (AIE) nature. In THF (10−5 M) solution, all the Cz-TPEs emit deep blue fluorescence after UV irradiation and we find that the more the TPE groups, the slower the enhancement of fluorescence. In thin films (40 nm), the emission maximum blue shift decreases and finally becomes non-emissive after about 1.5 h of UV irradiation for all the Cz-TPEs. We suppose these optical properties are attributed to photo-induced irreversible changes of TPE to diphenylphenanthrene derivatives. The photo-oxidation process for Cz-1TPE has been investigated and proved by HPLC analysis, 1H NMR and LS-MS. Electrochemical properties of all the Cz-TPEs are investigated by cyclic voltammetry and with UV-absorption spectra, and their energy levels are calculated. Finally, we applied the Cz-TPEs to organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices by the spin coating deposition process with OLED devices configuration: ITO/PEDOT (40 nm)/Cz-TPEs (50 nm)/TPBi (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). All EL devices emit blue-green light with a maximum luminance (Lmax) of 2858, 1353, 986, 2088 and 1129 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency (ηc,max) of 3.5, 4.9, 3.1, 3.1 and 5.5 cd A−1, a maximum power efficiency (ηP,max) of 2.1, 3.9, 2.2, 1.8 and 3.1 lm W−1 and a turn on voltage (Von) of 3.5, 3.5, 3.3, 3.6 and 4.2 V for Cz-1TPE, Cz-2TPE, Cz-3TPE, Cz-4TPE, Cz-2TPE (2,7), respectively.
Introduction
Carbazole-based materials have been important within organic semiconductor research for several decades due to their efficient hole-mobility properties. As a result they have found widespread use in academic and commercial settings in areas such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),1 xerography2 and solar cells.3 With respect to OLEDs carbazole-based materials have been used as hole-transporting materials and incorporated into the light-emitting materials to improve both hole-transporting and injection properties.4 Current research regarding host materials for phosphorescence OLEDs has involved carbazole due to its high triplet energy level and low oxidation potential.5 In most cases carbazole materials for OLED applications are functionalized either at the 2,7-, 3,6 or the 9-(N) position.6 However, we recently reported novel methods for the bromination of carbazole at the 1,3,6- and 1,3,6,8-positions and subsequent Suzuki cross-couplings afforded new carbazole oligomeric materials.7a
Recently great progress has been made regarding materials that display aggregation induced emission (AIE) properties.8 These materials exhibit opposite properties of the more commonly observed aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) and, in fact, have excellent fluorescence quantum efficiencies in the solid-state compared to near quenching in solution. The original material that was found to exhibit such intriguing optical properties was 1-methyl-1,2,3,4,5-pentaphenylsilole and was first discovered by B. Z. Tang's group.9 Within this last year other materials based on cyanostilbenes,10 fumaronitrile,11 dibenzosuberenylidene,12 carborane,13 9,10-distyrylanthracene,14 phenylpyrrole,15 spiropyran,16 and even some organometallic iridium materials17 have also demonstrated AIE activity. However, besides silole-based materials, probably the more active player within the AIE research field has been tetraphenylethene (TPE) and its derivatives.18 TPE-based materials are easy to synthesize and modify, exhibit high AIE-effect values (extent of emission enhancement), and display excellent solid-state fluorescence quantum yields (near quantitative).8,18 Due to these aspects TPE-based materials have been paid increased attention in the fields of OLEDs and chemo/biosensors with recent review articles being published regarding both topics.19 We also designed and synthesized two TPE–phenanthroline conjugates, which exhibit different fluorescence behavior of metal ions in the aggregate state and in the free molecule state.20
Due to the excellent hole-transporting properties of carbazole and the high photoluminescence quantum yields of TPE it has been the subject of several research papers to combine these two units together. This has also been successfully achieved using fluorene as its major core component, in which hindered internal bond motions of the TPE end-cap groups are responsible for the enhanced fluorescence in the “aggregate” state. The connection between TPE and carbazole consists of 9-N-position, 3,6-position linkage, both at 9-N-position and 3,6-position and in conjugated hyperbranched polymers.21 What's more, a variety of highly emissive solid emitters with high Tg (ref. 22) and good hole transporting properties23 have been synthesized and applied to OLED or PLED. From our recent success regarding the synthesis of 1,3,6- and 1,3,6,8-brominated carbazole materials and the lack of investigations at the 2,7-positions we believe that it was important to complete this research topic. Therefore, in attempt to tie together our previous research work we have fully incorporated TPE into carbazole at all possible connection sites (1,2,3,6,7, and 8-positions, see Fig. 1) and investigate their comparative thermal, optical, electroluminescence and AIE properties. Due to the susceptibility of TPE to undergo photo-oxidation,24 the photo-oxidative stability was fully evaluated in solution and the solid-state, in which the latter is especially important for OLED applications.

Herein, we report the synthesis of tetraphenylethene-decorated carbazoles at all possible connection sites (1 and 8,3 and 6,2 and 7-positions) via selective bromination of carbazole followed by Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. The thermal, optical, photochemical, electrochemical and electroluminescence properties of tetraphenylethene-decorated carbazoles have been studied comparatively.
Experimental
All commercially available starting materials, reagents and solvents were used as supplied, unless otherwise stated, and were purchased from Aladdin, Acros Organics and Puyang Huicheng Chemical Co. Ltd. All reactions were carried out under a dry nitrogen atmosphere unless water was used as a solvent or reagent and the temperatures were measured externally. For brominations no nitrogen was used to prevent contamination of the nitrogen line. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were dried using sodium wire and benzophenone as indicators. Dichloromethane (DCM) was dried over calcium sulfate and distilled. Reported yields are isolated yields. Purification of most intermediates and all final products was accomplished in most cases by gravity column chromatography, using silica gel. For qualitative purity tests of all intermediates and final products, a single spot (visualized using UV-light at 254 nm and 365 nm) was obtained. Elemental analysis was used for quantitative purity checks of all final products. 1H NMR spectra are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane as an internal standard.
The synthesis procedure of different bromo-substituted carbazoles and TPE boronic acid could be found in previous work.6

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Carbazole-based materials used in organic semiconductor research are usually designed and subsequently built from the accessible points at the N-9-position, 3,6-positions and the 2,7 positions. The functionalisation of the 9-N-position and 3,6-positions is relatively straightforward and requires Ullmann condensations/nucleophilic substitutions and bromination, respectively. Due to the fact that electrophilic substitution of carbazole occurs at the activated 3,6-positions, the 2,7-dibromo carbazole requires an alternative synthetic pathway. One alternative pathway involves the nitration of 4,4′-dibromo-1-1′-biphenyl to yield its mono-nitro derivative, which can be subsequently ring-closed using PPh3 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) to yield 2,7-dibromo-9H-carbazole. 3-Bromocarbazole and 3,6-dibromocarbazole are easily prepared using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature. The synthesis of 1,3,6-tribromocarbazole has recently been reported by our group and can be prepared by treating 9-octylcarbazole with NBS–silica gel in CHCl3 in excellent yield and purity. 1,3,6,8-Tetrabromocarbazole can also be synthesized at room temperature using Br2/FeCl3 in CH2Cl2. The N-position was functionalised with octyl chains by N-alkylation using NaOH, a two-phase toluene–water solvent system and 1-bromooctane. Standard Pd-catalysed Suzuki couplings were performed to prepare the final materials, Cz-1TPE, Cz-2 TPE (3,6), Cz-2TPE (2,7), Cz-3TPE and Cz-4TPE (Scheme 1).

The glass transition temperatures (Tg) were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). From Fig. 2B, all these newly synthesized Cz-TPEs exhibited relatively high thermal stabilities with Td (corresponding to 5% weight loss) of 331, 449, 493, 463, and 443 °C for Cz-1TPE, Cz-2TPE, Cz-3TPE, Cz-4TPE, and Cz-2TPE (2,7), respectively. As expected the DSC scans (see Fig. 2A) of all 5 fluorophores show a first order transition temperature above room temperature, which represents a glass transition temperature (Tg). A crystallization exotherm was observed only for Cz-2TPE (2,7) and for the other carbazole-TPE materials no crystallization exotherms are observed during the cooling and heating cycles. Cz (1–4) TPE were isolated as amorphous materials due to the absence of an endothermic melting peak on the first heating cycle. This is probably due to the high viscosity of the amorphous state. The highest Tg value was observed for Cz-4TPE (138 °C), which has the highest molecular weight and perhaps the most hindered free volume. We have also confirmed the amorphous nature of these materials by XRD analysis (see Fig. 2C), in which the diffraction curve shows the characteristic amorphous halo without sharp crystalline diffractions.

The lack of diffraction peaks indicates that Cz-2TPE (3,6) remains as an amorphous material for a long period of time without crystallisation. 
Photo-physical and aggregation induced emission (AIE)

Static state UV-vis absorption. 
The absorption spectra of Cz-TPEs in THF (10−5 M) are shown in Fig. 3. In the same concentration of 10−5 M, the absorbance (molar extinction coefficient ε) at the maximum wavelength is in the following order: Cz-1TPE < Cz-2TPE ≈ Cz-3TPE < Cz-4TPE. Two peaks at 290 nm and 334 nm are observed for Cz-1TPE, which is 35 nm red shifted compared to TPE (299 nm) molecules alone. The absorption spectrum of Cz-2TPE is more red-shifted to that of Cz-1TPE with two peaks at 299 nm and 337 nm, which might be because two TPEs at both 3 and 6 positions of carbazole form a larger conjugation than that of Cz-1TPE. The absorption spectra of Cz-3TPE and Cz-4TPE are very broad between 270 nm and 360 nm with peaks at 318 nm and 326 nm respectively.
 Fig. 3  UV-vis absorption spectra of Cz-TPEs in THF with concentration equal to 10−5 M. 
For all the Cz-TPEs (TPE at 1,3,6,8 positions), the absorption spectra are similar, while Cz-2TPE (2,7) is quite different. Only one defined peak at 360 nm is observed for Cz-2TPE (2,7), which is 23 nm red-shifted compared with Cz-2TPE (3,6). This could be explained by the former mechanism proposed by Bea M. W. Langeveld.1d We can see from Fig. 4 that the conjugation length of Cz-TPEs at 1,3,6,8 positions are isolated in one phenyl ring of carbazole and TPE, while at 2 and 7 positions form a whole conjugation of the molecule. Since more TPEs connected to 1 and/or 8 position do not enlarge the conjugation of the molecule, they exhibit very little difference in absorption spectra.
 Fig. 4  Molecular structures of Cz-2TPE (3,6) and Cz-2TPE (2,7) and the oval represent the conjugation of the molecule. 


Aggregation induced emission. 
The AIE behavior is investigated by monitoring the change in PL intensity with the addition of increasing amounts of water in a THF–water solvent mixture. Here, THF acts as the solvent and water acts as the non-solvent. Typical AIE behavior is observed by a transition from isolated molecules to nano-aggregates at a critical concentration of water. This results in a corresponding increase in the PL intensity. The experiment is carried on by adding 20 μL Cz-TPEs solution (10−3 M in THF) using a microsyringe (25 μL) to a 2.0 mL mixture of THF–water (fw = 0–90%). In this way, the concentration is ascertained to be 10−5 M at different fw. During the experiment, all the aggregates were homogeneous with no precipitates.
In THF, all the Cz-TPEs are non-fluorescent. Cz-1TPE is non-fluorescent at fw = 0–75%, and then a broad peak around 500 nm at fw = 80% is observed. The PL intensity increases sharply with fw = 90% for 37.5 times compared to fw = 0% (see Fig. 5A1). The corresponding UV-vis absorption at fw = 0–50% nearly unchanged. When the fw gradually increases to 90%, the two peaks at 290 nm and 344 nm slowly red-shifted with decreases in intensity and a long tail around 400–600 nm is observed, simultaneously (see Fig. 5A2). The decreases in absorption and the long tail around 400–600 nm are because of nano-aggregates formed at high fw. This has been proved by differential light scattering (DLS) data (see Table 1 and Fig. S3†). The diameter of a nano-aggregate at fw = 90% of Cz-1TPE is calculated to be 125.4 nm. The other Cz-TPEs are similar to that of Cz-1TPE and the diameters of nano-aggregates at fw = 90% for Cz-2TPE, Cz-3TPE, Cz-4TPE, Cz-2TPE (2,7) are calculated to be 127.5, 136.6, 144.1 and 115 nm, respectively.

It is interesting to note that at the fw, the emission that begins to “light up” is in the following order: Cz-4TPE (fw = 60%) ≈ Cz-3TPE (fw = 60%) < Cz-2TPE (3,6) (fw = 65%) < Cz-2TPE (2,7) (fw = 60%) < Cz-1TPE (fw = 75%). This phenomenon could also be witnessed from the photos in Fig. 6. With more TPE attached to the carbazole core, the fluorescence lights up at lower water content (fw) in THF–water. This phenomenon could be attributed to the fact that when more TPEs are connected to the carbazole, the solubility of Cz-TPEs would decrease and as a result becomes much easier to form nano-aggregates in relative low water content (fw).

The plot of (I/I0 − 1)−fw is made to compare the AIE properties of the Cz-TPEs. We can see from Fig. 7 that Cz-1TPE < Cz-2TPE (2,7) ≈ Cz-2TPE (3,6) < Cz-4TPE < Cz-3TPE. Apart from the fact that the intensity of Cz-4TPE is weaker than that of Cz-3TPE, we can conclude that when more TPEs are connected to the carbazole, the AIE properties are strengthened. To investigate the AIE properties more quantitatively, quantum yields for all the Cz-TPEs in PMMA films and pure THF solution are studied, using DPA as the standard material (see Fig. S1†). The fluorescent quantum yields are 44.6%, 50.5%, 61.1%, 57.6% and 47.5% in PMMA films compared to 0.37%, 0.16%, 0.23%, 0.18% and 0.22% in THF solution for Cz-1TPE, Cz-2TPE, Cz-3TPE, Cz-4TPE and Cz-2TPE (2,7), respectively (see Table 1). The fluorescent quantum yields of Cz-TPEs in PMMA films are consistent with the (I/I0 − 1)−fw.

Photo-oxidation

Photo-oxidation in dilute solution. 
The experiments are performed by dissolving Cz-TPEs in distilled THF (concentration equal 10−5 mol L−1) and exposing under UV light (302 nm, 0.85 mW cm−2) for different times. Cz-TPEs are not fluorescent in THF because of their AIE nature. After UV light irradiation for 5 min, Cz-1TPE exhibits two peaks at 391 nm and 404 nm. The fluorescent intensity enhances sharply with further increase in the irradiation time. And the UV-Vis absorption spectra peaks at 335 nm and 293 nm blue shift gradually to 327 nm and 290 nm, respectively, with an isosbestic point at 312 nm (Fig. 8A2). The fluorescent intensity of Cz-2TPE solution slightly increased in the first 30 min. After 45 min irradiation, it increases 5.7 times with 3 defined peaks at 407 nm, 430 nm and 456 nm. By extending irradiation time, it increases by 21.1 times and the peaks at 430 nm and 456 nm become misty with one strong peak at 406 nm.

The corresponding UV-Vis absorption peaks at 338 nm and 301 nm blue shift gradually to 334 nm and 298 nm with an isosbestic point at 316 nm (Fig. 8B2). Similar to Cz-2TPE, the fluorescent intensity of Cz-3TPE and Cz-2TPE (2,7) solution nearly unchanged in the first 30 min and three defined peaks are observed in 45 min which are 407 nm, 432 nm and 456 nm. These peaks are identical to that of Cz-2TPE after UV irradiation, which indicates a similar process in the photo-oxidation process. The absorption peak of Cz-3TPE at 323 nm decreases and the peak at 301 nm increases with an isosbestic point at 310 nm (Fig. 8C2). The absorption peak of Cz-2TPE (2,7) at 360 nm decreases and an isosbestic point at 344 nm was observed after UV irradiation (Fig. 8E2). The fluorescent spectra of Cz-4TPE nearly unchanged even after being irradiated for 2 h. However, the absorption spectra of Cz-4TPE clearly changes: the peak at 326 nm decreases and absorbance increases around 250–300 nm with an isosbestic point at 310 nm (Fig. 8D2). After further irradiating it for 1 h, a strong peak at 410 nm appears. This indicates that there exists an induced period of fluorescence occurrence for TPE multi-substituted carbazole. The oxidation reaction of TPE continued upon UV irradiation, though. Only when the all-oxidation of four TPEs was finished, the fluorescence increases abruptly.


HPLC analysis. 
HPLC analysis is performed to detect the photo-oxidation process. In this case, we choose the simplest molecule Cz-1TPE as an example. We investigate the effect of different concentrations of the samples, which are 10−3 M, 10−4 M, 10−5 M and different irradiation times: 1 h, 2 h and 3 h on the photo-oxidation process. Cz-1TPE is first dissolved in THF with concentration divided into three groups: 10−3, 10−4 and 10−5 mol L−1. Then each group is irradiated under UV lamp (302 nm) for 1 h, 2 h and 3 h. These samples are kept in open air to evaporate the solvent THF and then they are used for HPLC directly using hexane as the eluent.
Before we carried out the experiments, we first measured the HPLC spectrum of Cz-1TPE using hexane as the eluent (the retention time is 18.4 min for Cz-1TPE without UV irradiation). Thus the peak at 18.4 min can be attributed to Cz-1TPE and the two peaks at 27.8 min and 29.4 min are the photo-oxidation products. We normalize the intensity of the peak at 18.4 min and compare the peak intensity at 27.8 min and 29.4 min (see Fig. 9A) for every sample. In the sample with [conc.] = 10−3 M, after 1 h irradiation, the integral areas at 27.8 min and 29.4 min are 0.50% and 0.89% respectively. With longer irradiation times of 2 h and 3 h, they increase to 0.98% (27.8 min), 1.86% (29.4 min) and 1.42% (27.8 min), 2.52% (29.4 min). These changes are very tiny but identical to indicate the changes after UV irradiation. When the sample is 10 times and 100 times diluted, 10−4 M and 10−5 M, the intensity exhibits higher changes at 27.8 min and 29.4 min, which indicates that more Cz-1TPE convert to photo-oxidation products. The detailed changes of peak 1 (27.8 min) and peak 2 (29.4 min) could be seen from Fig. 9B and C with different UV irradiation times and concentrations. It is clear that with longer irradiation time and more diluted concentration, the conversion of photo-oxidation improves from the HPLC results.

HPLC analysis was performed using an analytical column equipped with a UV detector; the mobile phase was hexane with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 (range; 0.005, inject volume; 20 μL, detection wavelength; 312 nm), inset: expanded image of 10−3 M around retention time between 27 min and 33 min; (B) plot of relative content of peak 1 (retention time 27.8 min) with different concentrations (10−3 M, 10−4 M, 10−5 M) and UV irradiation times (1 h, 2 h, 3 h); (C) plot of relative content of peak 2 (retention time 29.4 min) with different concentrations (10−3 M, 10−4 M, 10−5 M) and UV irradiation times (1 h, 2 h, 3 h). 



1H NMR and LC-MS analysis. 
We further investigate the photo-oxidation of Cz-1TPE in solution by 1H NMR and LC-MS. The experiment was performed by exposing the NMR tube with samples under UV light for 3 h. The corresponding 1H NMR spectra of Cz-1TPE before (A) and after (B) UV (302 nm, 3 h) light irradiation are presented in Fig. S17.† Basically, the chemical shift of Cz-1TPE before and after UV irradiation nearly unchanged (see ESI Fig. S15†) except a few multi peaks around δ 4.3 (N–CH2) was observed. As we set the integral area around δ 4.3 as 2, the integral area around δ 7.0–7.22, which belongs to the TPE group (17 Ar-H, in red) decreases from 16.85 to 16.14. It can be explained that the decrease of relative integral area around δ 7.0–7.22 is attributed to the photocyclisation of phenyl rings in TPE.
After the 1H NMR experiments we use the photo-oxidized products directly for LC-MS measurement. The LC-MS spectra of Cz-1TPE before and after UV (302 nm, 3 h) are presented in Fig. 10. We can see clearly the 610.5 (M + 1) signal of Cz-1TPE (Mw = 609.8) and corresponding isotope signals 611.3 and 612.2 in Fig. 10(A). After UV irradiation two new signals of 608.5 and 609.6 appear together with the three peaks from the Cz-1TPE (610.5, 611.5 and 612.5), which are exactly 2H less from Cz-1TPE. These results directly support our photo-oxidation mechanism. Meanwhile, it is worth to emphasize that the photo-oxidation was not 100% converted to the photo-oxidation products, which could be witnessed from both the 1H NMR and LC-MS measurements. This is because the concentration of the sample for 1H NMR usually needs to be high (much higher than 10−5 mol L−1). In our case, 5.5 mg Cz-1TPE was dissolved in 0.6 mL CDCl3 and the concentration is calculated to be 1.5 × 10−2 mol L−1. According to the former HPLC analysis when the concentration increases, the photo-oxidation conversion decreases dramatically. And the similarity of the photo-oxidation products and Cz-1TPE makes it more difficult to discriminate the changes from the 1H NMR analysis. As we know, usually photo-chemical reactions are much more complex than normal chemical reactions, and if the UV irradiation time is too long, other unpredictable changes might happen.

Photo-oxidation in pure thin films. 
In order to investigate the photo-oxidation of Cz-TPEs practically, we apply the experiment in pure thin films, since an important application of TPE molecules is in OLEDs. The samples are prepared by dissolving Cz-TPEs in distilled THF. Then the solution is dropped onto glasses. By the spin-coating method (400 rad s−1, 1 min), pure thin films (thickness: ∼40 nm) of Cz-TPE samples are made. The thickness of the prepared film is calculated and presented in ESI Fig. S3.†
Cz-1TPE emits strongly in the thin film at 483 nm. The λem of Cz-2TPE, Cz-3TPE, Cz-4TPE and Cz-2TPE (2,7) are 487 nm, 486 nm, 483 nm and 489 nm, respectively (Fig. 11). The fluorescent intensity gradually decreased in the first 30 min. After 90 min irradiation, the fluorescence of Cz-1TPE quenches to 1% of the original intensity and blue shifts to 460 nm. A similar phenomenon is observed for other Cz-TPEs. The fluorescent intensity decreases to 2%, 1.6%, 0.7% and 1.4% for Cz-2TPE, Cz-3TPE, Cz-4TPE and Cz-2TPE (2,7), respectively. The plot of I/I0 (fluorescence intensity at 483 nm) with different UV irradiation times is shown in Fig. 11F.

From the photo-oxidation experiment we can conclude the following characteristics of photo-oxidation: (1) in THF solutions, the non-fluorescent Cz-TPEs solutions emit strong blue light around 410 nm after appropriate time of UV irradiation; (2) the absorbance peaks of Cz-TPEs decrease and blue-shift with a remarkable isosbestic point around 310 nm (Cz-2TPE (2,7) is an exception because of its better conjugation (λmax = 360 nm), also an isosbestic point at 344 nm was observed); (3) in thin films, the fluorescence quenches and blue shifts to shorter wavelength after appropriate time of UV irradiation. These characteristics strongly indicate their similarity in the photo-oxidation process, which could also be induced from the similar structures (Fig. 12A and B). According to the former investigation in photo-oxidation of TPE molecules,24 we proposed the following process to explain the photo-oxidation here. Under long time UV irradiation, the TPE molecule could be oxidized to form a diphenylphenanthrene structure. And for Cz-1TPE, two possible structures (Fig. 12C) are exhibited as the two peaks of HPLC (27.8 min, 29.4 min) after photo-oxidation (Fig. 9A). This small change in the molecular structure makes it from AIE active molecule to ACQ molecule. These characteristics are supported by the strong enhanced emission in dilute solution and nearly quenching in thin films after UV irradiation. It should be noted that in solutions the concentration affects the conversion of photo-oxidation greatly. From the HPLC results of high concentration solution (10−3 M), we can observe that upon 1 h UV irradiation, only very little photo-oxidation products form (0.50% at 27.8 min, 0.89% at 29.4 min). Even if it is irradiated up to 3 h, the photo-oxidation reaction rate is still slow (1.42% at 27.4 min, 2.52% at 29.4 min). While for 10−5 M, the photo-oxidation product improves from 11.08% (27.8 min), 20.57% (29.4 min) at 1 h, 40.68% (27.8 min), 78.04% (29.4 min) at 2 h, to 47.85% (27.8 min), 73.54% (29.4 min) at 3 h. We propose that O2 might participate in the photo-oxidation process. In dilute solutions, the amount of O2 in solution could be treated as constant without changing the volume and temperature of the sample during photo-oxidation experiment. Consequently, in concentrated solutions the conversion is much lower compared with dilute solutions at the same irradiation time.

It is interesting to note that the Cz-4TPE in solution shows very little changes until 3 h irradiation while Cz-1TPE exhibits strong emission in just 5 min, meanwhile the UV-Vis absorption of all the Cz-TPEs exhibits similar changes upon UV irradiation. We make the plot of I/I0 (fluorescence intensity at 407 nm) and A/A0 (the Abs at 335 nm for Cz-1TPE, 338 nm for Cz-2TPE, 338 nm for Cz-3TPE, 326 nm for Cz-4TPE, 360 nm for Cz-2TPE (2,7)) with UV irradiation times (see Fig. 8F1 and F2). We can see from Fig. 8F2, all the absorbance decreases gradually as we increase the irradiation time, which indicates that the photo-oxidation process happens uniformly for all the Cz-TPEs without exception. We suppose the difference in the numbers of TPE in the molecules is the main reason. When the only one TPE in Cz-1TPE is oxidized, the product will “soon” turn from AIE-active to ACQ; whereas in Cz-4TPE, even if one or two TPEs in the molecule are oxidized, it might still remain AIE-active and as a result the fluorescence changes much “slower” than that of Cz-1TPE. Generally, we can observe the fluorescence changes trend as Cz-1TPE > Cz-2TPE ≈ Cz-2TPE (2,7) > Cz-3TPE > Cz-4TPE from Fig. 8F1.
Similarly, the plot of I/I0 (fluorescence intensity at 483 nm) with different UV irradiation times was made to investigate the photo-oxidation in thin films (see Fig. 11F). The I/I0 value of Cz-1TPE decreases in the slowest manner, while those of Cz-2TPE and Cz-3TPE decrease in the fastest manner, which is quite different from that in THF. We suppose that “this disorder” in the fluorescence response to UV light irradiation might be attributed to the following reasons. In the solid state, the concentration effect disappears, instead the effect of thickness of the films is seen. The prepared films by the spin coating method could hardly be made highly uniform, especially for small organic molecules, since the thickness of the film affects a lot their fluorescence response to UV light. As a result, in films the fluorescence changes upon UV light irradiation look “disordered” compared to that in THF. However, we can conclude that in the thin film state all the Cz-TPEs could be photo-oxidized by UV light from these results.

Theoretical calculations
To further understand the correlation between the structure and the physical properties as well as the device performance, quantum chemistry computations were conducted. The geometries of the molecules have been optimized using DFT calculations with the B3LYP exchange-correlation functional and a 6- 31G* basis set. Fig. 13 shows the optimized geometries and the orbital distributions of HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Cz-TPEs (the HOMO and LUMO data are calculated from UV-Vis absorption and CV). The LUMO electron clouds of Cz-1TPE and Cz-2TPE are distributed at TPE groups (3 and/or 6 position), which are different from those of Cz-3TPE and Cz-4TPE (TPE at 1 and/or 8 position of carbazole). The LUMO level of Cz-2TPE (2,7) is well-distributed in both TPE and carbazole, which might be because of the symmetry of the molecule and better conjugation at the 2 and 7 positions of carbazole. The electron clouds of HOMO levels of all the Cz-TPEs are dominated by the carbazole and TPE at 3 and 6 positions.

Electrochemical and electroluminescence properties
The electrochemical properties of Cz-TPEs were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 14). The HOMO energy levels were calculated to be 5.01 eV, 4.96 eV, 5.07 eV, 4.96 eV and 4.97 eV for Cz-1TPE, Cz-2TPE, Cz-3TPE, Cz-4TPE and Cz-2TPE (2,7), respectively, according to the following equation: HOMO = (4.8 + Eox) eV. The single TPE molecule is also measured in the same way with a HOMO value of 5.69 eV. Their LUMOs could be obtained from optical band gap energies (estimated from the onset wavelength of their UV absorptions) and HOMO values, which gave LUMO values of 1.21 eV, 1.25 eV, 1.43 eV, 1.37 eV and 1.39 eV for Cz-1TPE, Cz-2TPE, Cz-3TPE, Cz-4TPE and Cz- 2TPE (2,7), respectively.

After we have obtained the theory calculation and electrochemical properties of these Cz-TPEs, we fabricated multilayer OLED devices with configuration ITO/PEDOT (40 nm)/Cz-TPEs (50 nm)/TPBi (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) by spin coating deposition processes, in which Cz-TPE materials serve as the emitting layer, PEDOT functions as the hole-transporting layer and TPBi (1,3,5-tris(N-phenyl-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene) functions both as the hole-blocking and electron transporting layer. The detailed procedures are performed by dissolving 10 mg Cz-TPEs into 1 mL THF and this solution was then spin-coated at 1000 rad s−1 for 1 min. The thickness of the emitting layer was calculated to be ∼50 nm. The EL spectra, current density–voltage–brightness (J–V–L) characteristics, efficiency versus current density curves, efficiency versus power efficiency, energy diagrams and device configurations are shown in Fig. 15.

As shown in Fig. 15A, the electroluminescence devices of Cz-TPEs exhibit similar characteristics compared to the PL spectra in thin films and the CIE coordinates are thus calculated to be (0.18, 0.34), (0.20, 0.40), (0.20, 0.39), (0.20, 0.38) and (0.20, 0.38) for Cz-1TPE, Cz-2TPE, Cz-3TPE, Cz-4TPE, Cz-2TPE (2,7), respectively. The devices based on Cz-TPEs (with the same sequence) exhibit a maximum luminance (Lmax) of 2858, 1353, 986, 2088 and 1129 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency (ηc,max) of 3.5, 4.9, 3.1, 3.1 and 5.5 cd A−1, a maximum power efficiency (ηP,max) of 2.1, 3.9, 2.2, 1.8 and 3.1 lm W−1 and a turn on voltage (Von) of 3.5, 3.5, 3.3, 3.6 and 4.2 V, respectively. The detailed EL performances are listed in Table 2.

We have previously reported a series of fluorene oligomer end capped TPE materials (F(1–5)-TPE) and investigated its EL performances. With the same EL device structures and similar conditions, it is shown that the Cz-TPEs based EL devices exhibit great improvements compared to those of F(1–5)-TPEs. Cz-1TPE exhibits the highest Lmax with 2585 cd m−2, which is 2 times that of the F-1TPE (1300 cd m−2, highest among F(1–5)-TPE). The ηc,max and ηP,max of Cz-TPEs are around 3.1–5.5 cd A−1 and 1.8–3.9 lm W−1, while the highest for F(1–5)-TPE are only 2.6 cd m−2 and 1.0 lm W−1, respectively. All the Cz-TPEs show lower turn on voltage compared to those of F(1–5)-TPE (4.8–6.4 V) with the lowest 3.3 V for the device of Cz-3TPE. The better matching of the HOMO energy level to PEDOT and good hole transporting properties of carbazole moieties might be the main reasons for the EL performance improvements.
Conclusions
In this paper, we design and synthesize a series of novel TPE-decorated carbazole fluorophores with aggregation-induced emission characteristics. The bromination of carbazole has been controlled and then the subsequent mono, di, tri and tetra-bromocarbazoles have been subjected to Suzuki cross-coupling to yield a series of carbazole-tetraphenylethene (TPE) materials with varying numbers of peripheral TPE groups. We have carried out a comparative study of their thermal, optical, electrochemical and electroluminescence properties.
From the DSC and TGA curves, the glass transition temperature increases as the number of tetraphenylethene groups increases around the central carbazole ring (20.7 °C to 137.5 °C) and all oligomers exhibit good thermal stability with high thermal decomposition temperatures in the range of 331 °C to 493 °C. Generally, the molar absorptivity (ε) of Cz-TPEs increases as there are more TPE groups connecting to carbazole and the substitution at 2,7 positions contributes more to the conjugation of the whole molecule compared to others at 1,3,6,8 positions of carbazole.
All the Cz-TPEs are non-fluorescent in THF and emit strong blue-green fluorescence in thin films because of their AIE nature. In the water–THF measurements, the emission starts to light up “earlier” with lower water content (fw) when there are more TPEs in the molecules, which could be attributed to the fact that more TPEs in the molecules make it more insoluble in water and thus the rotation of the phenyls in TPE becomes much easier to be restricted in the poor solvent mixtures.
In THF (10−5 M) solution, all the Cz-TPEs emit deep blue light after proper time of UV (302 nm) irradiation and we find that the more the TPE groups, the slower the enhancement of fluorescence. In thin films (40 nm), the emission maximum blue shift, decreases and finally becomes non-emissive after about 1.5 h for all the Cz-TPEs. We suppose these optical properties are attributed to the photo-induced irreversible changes of TPE to diphenylphenanthrene derivatives. The photo-oxidation process of Cz-1TPE in solution is also investigated and proved by HPLC analysis, 1H NMR and LC-MS.
Consequently, we applied the Cz-TPEs to OLED devices by the spin coating deposition process with OLED devices configuration: ITO/PEDOT (40 nm)/Cz-TPEs (50 nm)/TPBi (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). All the EL devices emit blue-green light with a maximum luminance (Lmax) of 2858, 1353, 986, 2088 and 1129 cd m−2, a maximum current efficiency (ηc,max) of 3.5, 4.9, 3.1, 3.1 and 5.5 cd A−1, a maximum power efficiency (ηP,max) of 2.1, 3.9, 2.2, 1.8 and 3.1 lm W−1 and a turn on voltage (Von) of 3.5, 3.5, 3.3, 3.6 and 4.2 V, for Cz-1TPE, Cz-2TPE, Cz-3TPE, Cz-4TPE, Cz-2TPE (2,7), respectively.
The photo-oxidation of Cz-TPEs is a common phenomenon in both solution and thin films regardless of the number of the TPEs or substitute positions at the carbazole from our work. It is noteworthy that the photo-oxidation in dilute solutions (10−5 M) and thin films (thickness ∼ 40 nm) upon UV (302 nm) light irradiation are rather obvious. As the sustained growth and increasing passion of investigation in TPE molecules exist in recent years, designing more photo-stable TPE molecules might be an important research topic. Our group has undertaken synthesis of modified TPEs to achieve this goal.
