    , Accepted 10th November 2014First published on 24th November 2014AbstractIn a search for blue light emitting multifunctional materials, the electron transport enhancing diphenyl phosphine–oxide (Ph2PO) group has been appended to blue light emitting pyrene derivatives. This design, we observe, leads to highly efficient electron transporting blue-emitters for non-doped organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) with good film formation characteristics. The superior performance is attributed to enhanced charge transport and formation of pyrene excimers assisted by thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in the device. We report the synthesis and characterization using experimental and computational methods of six such pyrene derivatives. Although three of these derivatives show quenching of luminescence in solvents at higher concentrations, in the thin film invariably all six of them exhibit typical pyrene excimer emission. X-ray crystal analysis reveals π–π stacking and the C–H⋯O interactions in the solid due to the PO group. The measured electron mobilities for all the compounds are higher in comparison to the standard electron transport material, Alq3. Non-doped OLEDs with the pyrene derivatives as emitters (multi-layer configuration) as well as electron transport cum emitters (bilayer configuration) exhibit excellent efficiencies. The derivatives as emitters display a performance with current efficiencies (ηc) in the range 21.1–30.1 cd A−1, power efficiencies (ηp) 11.0–15.76 lm W−1, external quantum efficiencies (EQE) 7.2–9.1% and brightness 28500–42750 cd m−2. In addition, the derivatives as electron transporting emitters demonstrate very good external quantum efficiencies in the range of 3.0–4.0%. These results demonstrate a successful strategy to obtain blue light emitting multifunctional materials for OLED applications.
Introduction
Organic molecules with potential applications as luminescent materials have been the focus of current research because of the attractive custom-tailored design and versatility of synthesis. An example of a practical application of such a molecule as a material is the emissive layer in organic light emitting diodes (OLED). Since the initial report, there has been rapid research progress in the OLED field, at both the basic and applied levels.1 OLEDs have potential as a technology for flat panel displays and lighting because of their characteristic low driving voltage, high brightness, full-colour emission, fast response time, wide viewing angle and self-emitting properties, with an added advantage of low price.2 Full colour displays require the three primary colours (red, green and blue) with equal stability, colour purity and improved efficiency.3 Among these, green and red light emitters have been extensively studied and numerous reports are available in the literature.4 However, blue light emitting materials are relatively less explored due to their wide band gap and low HOMO energy level, which impede the charge carrier injection from the adjacent layers.5 Thus, the development of blue light emitting materials with high efficiency remains a challenge to researchers.
The basic OLED principle is that the hole (radical cation) and electron (radical anion) should undergo recombination in the emissive layer (electrochemiluminescence (ECL)) to generate light.6 Generally, OLEDs with fluorescent and phosphorescent emitters have been fabricated in a multilayer configuration, possessing a hole transport layer (HTL), an emitting layer (EML) and an electron transport layer (ETL) along with charge injection and blocking layers, which are sequentially deposited in between the anode and the cathode, with each layer having their own function.6 In such a configuration, holes and electrons are injected from HTL and ETL, respectively, into the emitting layer, where the charge recombination takes place and an exciton is generated which emits light. The major drawbacks of the multilayer configuration are the complexity and manufacturing cost.7 To overcome these hurdles, materials with multi-functional properties, like emission and charge transport, have to be developed so as to reduce the number of layers in the device.8 Emitting materials with electron transport properties are relatively less explored than hole transporting emitters.9 Though the phosphorescent OLEDs show high efficiency compared to fluorescent OLEDs, the colour purity, dopant concentration and triplet–triplet annihilations limit their applications.10 Recently Adachi and co-workers11–16 have identified a new phenomenon whereby thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can play a major role in enhancing the performance of OLEDs. Overall, small organic molecules have advantages such as easy synthesis and purification, compared to polymers.
Keeping the above factors in mind and our own research interests, we aimed in this work to develop an efficient multifunctional blue emitter.9c,17 We chose the pyrene moiety for the emitting part because of its high fluorescence quantum yield, good thermal stability and greater number of reactive positions to develop numerous analogues.18 Though pyrene as an emitter has been the subject of numerous investigations, most of the reported work has focused on preventing its tendency to form π–π stacking and excimers.19 Very few reports actually utilize the excimer emission of pyrene in the device.20 Because the π–π stacking enhances the charge transport, we retain it and additionally we increase the electron affinity of the molecules by end-capping the electron deficient/withdrawing diphenyl phosphine oxide group onto the pyrene. In an earlier study, end-capping pyrene derivatives with electron-donating diarylamino groups so as to obtain bifunctional blue-emitting material yielded reduced EL.19l Conversely, there are reports of PO functional groups appended to highly fluorescent molecules such as anthracene and triphenylamine leading to effective electron transporting blue emitters.21
Using this design principle, here we have synthesized and investigated six new diphenyl phosphine–oxide appended pyrene derivatives (Fig. 1). In this series of compounds, different spacers were introduced into compound 10 to improve optical and thermal properties. The positional isomers 11 and 13 were designed to characterize the influence of molecular configuration on optoelectronic properties. The increase in the number of phenyl rings between the pyrene and the PO entities promises to increase the thermal stability. Compound 15 was designed to compare the influence of the non-planar biphenyl and the planar fluorene motifs as a π-bridge. Two methyl groups were appended to the phenyl ring, which caused molecular non-planarity through twisting of the phenyl ring for compound 14. Photophysical, electrochemical and thermal properties evaluations of all the compounds (10–15) have been carried out. The crystal structure of 13 was analyzed by X-ray crystallography. Non-doped OLEDs were fabricated for each of the compounds 10–15 as an emitter [device configuration: ITO (120 nm)/F4-TCNQ (2.5 nm)/α-NPD (45 nm)/emissive layer (10–15) (30 nm)/BCP (6 nm)/Alq3 (30 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (150 nm)] as well as an electron transport emitter [device configuration: ITO (120 nm)/F4-TCNQ (2.5 nm)/α-NPD (45 nm)/emissive layer (10–15) (50 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (150 nm)]. In addition, the electron mobilities were measured for all the compounds at an electric field of 1 × 105 V cm−1. To the best of our knowledge, the present manuscript is the first report of phosphine oxide functionalized pyrene derivatives as multifunctional blue light emitters.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization

Schemes 1 and 2 illustrate the synthetic sequence adopted to obtain the target materials 10–15 (Fig. 1). Pyrene was brominated to get bromo pyrene 130 and subsequently 1 was transformed to its corresponding borolane derivative 231 (Scheme 1). In another sequence, commercially available fluorene was brominated to get dibromo derivative 332 and it was then dimethylated to obtain compound 433 (Scheme 1). A Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction was developed to make key mono bromo intermediates 5–9 in good yields (73–85%), by reacting compound 2 with various dibromo derivatives such as 1,4-dibromobenzene, 4,4′-dibromobiphenyl, 1,3-dibromobenzene, 1,4-dibromo-2,5-dimethylbenzene and 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene (Scheme 2).34 The synthesized mono bromo intermediates 1 and 5–9 were treated with n-BuLi to generate the corresponding aryl lithio derivative at −78 °C, which was quenched with chlorodiphenylphosphine and subsequently oxidized using hydrogen peroxide to obtain the target phosphine oxide compounds (10–15), as depicted in Scheme 2. All the intermediates and target compounds were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry. The target compounds (10–15) were additionally characterized by 31P NMR, EI-HRMS and IR-spectroscopic studies (see Experimental section).

Molecular geometry, orbital picture and crystal structure
Knowledge of the geometry of the individual molecules would be of help in understanding the properties and the effect of substitution. Additionally, comparison of the geometries obtained by X-ray analysis where possible (molecule in the solid state environment), and DFT methods (isolated molecules in the gas phase) would also be helpful in understanding the intermolecular interactions in the solid. In this study, only for 13 were we able to determine the molecular structure using X-ray analysis shown in Fig. 2 along with the DFT-optimized structure. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that the major changes in the geometry on changing the environment from the solid to the gas phase are the dihedral angles between the rings (Table S1 ESI†). The dihedral angle between the pyrene ring and the neighbouring aryl ring is about 10° smaller in the gas phase but larger changes of as much as 70° are seen in the dihedral angles of the phenyl groups in the diphenyl phosphine oxide moiety. This indicates the large role of the PO moiety in the stabilization of molecules in the solid state.22

Another important point is to understand the conjugation between the pyrene ring and the phosphine oxide group in the ground state. In the case of 13, in spite of the smaller dihedral angle of 55° between the pyrene ring and the phenyl group, one can observe that due to m-substitution of the diphenyl phosphine oxide group the conjugation is decreased. However, for all the other molecules the dihedral angle between the pyrene ring and its neighbouring group dictates the conjugation. For example, in 14 the optimized angle is 75°, which is large and attributed to the steric effect, so we can expect a decreased conjugation. Conversely, in 11, 12 and 15 the angles vary between smaller values, namely 35°–55°, indicating that conjugation would be effective. Thus, for all the molecules this dihedral angle seems to play an important role in enhancing or decreasing the charge transfer.
The frontier molecular orbitals along with the individual contributions of the groups are shown in Fig. 3. In all the molecules, the HOMO is mostly localized on the pyrene ring. While the LUMO of 10, 13 and 14 are mainly localized on the pyrene ring, in the case of 11, 12 and 15 the LUMO is delocalized on the non-pyrene part, due to conjugation. The dipole moments estimated from DFT studies indicate that the ground state dipole moments are small at ∼3.4 to 4.0 Debye (Table 1), with very little variation with substitution.

We also obtain other near-degenerate conformations with different dihedral angles between the pyrene ring and the neighbouring aryl ring when we change our initial geometry in the DFT methods, shown as isomer 2 for 13 (Fig. S1 ESI†). In fact, one can envisage many near-degenerate local minima (rotational conformations), due to the low rotation barrier about this angle in these molecules in the gas and solvent phases in the ground states. In the excited state, one can also expect a change in the geometry due, in the case of intramolecular charge transfer, to this dihedral angle, but this rotation may be restricted in the solid state due to the strong intermolecular forces.
To get a deeper understanding of the intermolecular interactions, we studied the solid state nature of compound 13 (Fig. 4). 13 crystallizes in the triclinic P space group, with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit (Z′ = 1). The molecule is predominantly hydrophobic, due to the polar phosphine oxide. This functional group is considered to be a good H-bond acceptor and can result in strong hydrogen bonding, usually with polar amine or hydroxyl donor groups. However, in 13, the phosphine oxide is involved in multiple C–H⋯O interactions because the molecule lacks strong hydrogen bond donors. Three C–H⋯O interactions essentially propagate the molecular packing and stabilize the crystal lattice – a C2–H2⋯O1 interaction with its inversion-related molecule facilitates dimer formation, followed by extending the dimer of molecules into a zig–zag tape via C30–H30⋯O1 interaction, and finally by linking inversion-related tapes by a third C15–H15⋯O1 interaction. The pyrene rings allow multiple π–π ring stacking interactions to be established along the zig–zag tape and impart additional stability to the crystal structure. Significant non-covalent interactions in 13, along with their symmetry codes, are tabulated (Table S2 ESI†).

Electrochemical properties
The redox behaviours of 10–15 were investigated by performing cyclic voltammetric (CV) experiments with a standard three-electrode configuration electrochemical cell in dry THF under nitrogen atmosphere, and ferrocene as the internal reference (Fig. S2 ESI†). The main aim was to estimate the ionization potential (IP) and the electron affinity (EA) values of the molecules relative to the vacuum level. The IP of all the compounds were estimated (after correcting for the ferrocene standard) from the onset oxidation potential according to an empirical formula IP = −(Eonsetox + 4.8) eV35 and EA were estimated from the onset reduction potentials according to an empirical formula EA = −(Eonsetred + 4.8) eV35, which are compiled in Table 1. Their potentials were corrected to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) by measuring the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple in this system (0.6 V versus SCE). The onset oxidation potentials of 10–15 were estimated to be between 1.26–1.46 V, corresponding to the IP between 5.46–5.66 eV. The very small variation indicates that the oxidation occurs from the same moiety in all the molecules, namely pyrene. The onset reduction potentials were estimated to be between 1.6–1.85 V, corresponding to the EA of 2.35–2.60 eV. The band gaps obtained by the electrochemical methods were in the range 2.95–3.24 eV (Table 1).
IP and EA estimated by CV can be correlated to the HOMO and LUMO energy values obtained from DFT calculations.36 Hence, for comparison with the values obtained from DFT, frontier orbital data is given in the same Table. While the HOMO values obtained from DFT are in good agreement with the IP obtained from CV measurements, the LUMO values are slightly underestimated by the DFT method. While it is well known that EA using DFT methods are underestimated, here this could also be due to the different conformation adopted by the molecule in the solvent (the variation of LUMO with change in geometry is larger in these molecules).37Fig. 5 depicts the typical energy level diagram for a bilayer device with α-NPD as HTL and synthesized materials as n-type emitters. The IP of compounds offers a minimal energy barrier for holes to be injected from α-NPD, while EA is relatively closer to the work function of cathode LiF/Al. Hence, the compounds are suitable for hole and electron injection.

Photophysical properties
UV-Vis absorption studies have been carried out for 10–15 in chloroform (1.0 × 10−5 M), as well as in the thin film state, to analyze the optical properties and to estimate their utility for EL applications. The corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 6 and the relevant data are summarized in Table 2. The absorption spectra of 10–15 are almost similar, having comparable high energy bands (∼260 to 300 nm) and low energy bands (∼325 to 350 nm). There is very little variation of the λmax with substitution (346–353 nm), indicating that the group causing this absorption in all the molecules is most probably the same. Compounds 10 and 14 exhibit fine structure (relative to 11, 12, 13 and 15) in their absorption spectra. To understand the nature of the band, solvatochromic studies in various non-polar to polar solvents were carried out. A small or negligible solvent polarity effect was observed in the UV-Vis absorption spectra of these compounds (Table S3 and Fig. S3 ESI†), indicating that there is no major change in the dipole moment of these molecules upon excitation. In the case of the thin films, the absorption spectra recorded are almost similar to the absorption spectra in solution as shown in the same figure, except for a small red shift. This red shift (∼10 nm) can be attributed to the intermolecular interactions such as π–π stacking, or due to a change in the dihedral angle in the solid state.

TD-DFT calculations at the pbe0/6-31g (d,p)22 level of theory have been carried out in order to obtain a deeper insight into the absorption spectra and to determine the origin of the electronic transitions. The absorption maxima obtained by computational methods are in good agreement with the experimental values (Table 2). The first singlet excited state (S1) of all the molecules is attributed to the HOMO–LUMO transition (∼90%). From the orbitals shown in Fig. 3, this could be classified as a π–π* transition. Interestingly, in the case of 10, 13 and 14, the orbital density is almost localized on the pyrene moiety in the HOMO–LUMO transition, while in the rest of the molecules the HOMO–LUMO transition proceeds with a small charge transfer to the neighbouring aryl moiety. This can be seen in the computed oscillator strengths of the transitions, which are slightly smaller in the cases of 10, 13 and 14.
Fluorescence spectra of 10–15 were recorded in chloroform solvent, as well as in the thin film. The spectra are shown in Fig. 6 and the relevant data summarized in Table 2. The emissions in chloroform are in the range of 380–420 nm, which can be attributed to the substituted pyrene monomer. The fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) of the derivatives 10–15 were measured in CHCl3 using quinine sulphate (quantum yield: 0.53)23 as the standard (Table 2) and are in the range of 0.51–0.91. Optical band gaps obtained from the intersection point of offset point of absorption and onset of emission are given in the same table. The band gaps lie in the region 3.10–3.38 eV corresponding to blue emission. Interestingly, compared to 10, 13 and 14, the spectra of 11, 12 and 15 in chloroform show a broad structureless peak having a small red shift. The emissions in the thin film state of all the molecules are red shifted to around 458–482 nm. This large red shift can occur due to aggregation in the solid state or due to a change in the geometry of the molecules in the solid state.
Fluorescence spectra were also recorded in various polar and non-polar solvents in order to understand the nature of the excited state (Table 3 and Fig. S4 ESI†). Fluorescence spectra recorded for 11, 12 and 15 in various solvents show a red shift of almost 20–30 nm in going from hexane to a more polar solvent of acetonitrile/methanol. This behaviour is absent in 10, 13 and 14, which exhibit almost no red shift. The possible reason for this is that the former molecules are excited to a local excited state (HOMO–LUMO) which then relaxes to an intramolecular charge transfer state (ICT) with a change in the geometry. Conversely, in 10, 13 and 14, the excited state do not show any charge transfer, with the charge being localized almost on the pyrene moiety, even after excitation.

Changes in the emission spectra with increasing concentration of the compound were also studied in chloroform solvent (Fig. S5 ESI†). With increasing concentration, the intensity of the emission spectra of 13 at 390 nm decreases, and a new peak at 430 nm is observed which increases in intensity with increasing concentration. This effect is also seen in 10 and 14, where the red shifted peaks are at 430 and 420 nm, respectively. The emission spectra of 10, 13 and 14 at low energy wavelengths in thin film are similar in high concentration solution spectra and different in low concentration solutions, which can be attributed to emission from pyrene excimer. In fact, the thin film emission has a broad emission, typical of excimer emission.
Conversely, in 11, 12 and 15, with increasing concentration in the solvent, self-quenching is observed. The intensity of the peak decreases with no formation of a new red shifted peak. In the corresponding thin film spectra, we find that there are broad peaks around 450–470 nm as in the case of 10, 13 and 14. Based on the red shift and the previous data of 10, 13 and 14 we believe this emission to be also due to the formation of excimers. The quenching effect in the solvent could be caused by a change in geometry (ICT) in the excimer on excitation (rotation of the pyrene ring), leading to non-radiative decay of the excited state. On the other hand, the strong intermolecular interactions restrict the rotation in the solid, which leads to a radiative decay. Thus, we conclude that the emissions at 450–482 nm in the solid in all the molecules 10–15 arise as a consequence of the excimer emission. Importantly, all the compounds exhibit their emission in the blue region (380–480 nm) in solution as well as in the thin film state.
To understand the mechanism of luminescence and to identify the species responsible for emission, luminescence lifetime measurements were carried out for compound 13. A femto laser set-up was used to determine the short-lived fluorescence lifetimes for 13. At lower concentration (10−5 M), where the steady state data shows no excimer formation, the short lifetime component (5 ns) may be attributed to the lifetime of the locally excited singlet state and the longer lifetime (12 ns) to the charge separation between pyrene and diphenyl phospheneoxide. A Fluorolog-3 spectrometer equipped with a flash lamp was used for determining delayed emission for 13. The fluorescence lifetime decay of 13 at 10−5 and 10−2 M concentrations was measured at emission wavelengths of 390 and 460 nm (Table S4 and Fig. S6 ESI†). The delayed emission of 13 was checked with 0.1 ms delay after flash; the spectra show delayed emission with a lifetime of 9 μs at lower concentration (10−5 M), and at higher concentration (10−2 M), 7 μs and 97 μs (Fig. 7), involving excimer formation. The delayed emission with 9 μs lifetime is the delayed fluorescence of 13, since it has overlap with the fluorescence spectrum of 13. The origin of this delayed fluorescence is interesting in that it arises from a possible close-lying triplet.11–16 Both fluorescence and delayed fluorescence spectra are nearly coincident; hence the delayed component may be attributed to thermally activated delayed fluorescence.38,39 The proposal of a close-lying triplet comes from the observations recorded on phosphine oxide containing small molecules40 having triplet energy, ET ∼ 3.1 eV. The singlet formed upon absorption of light undergoes intersystem crossing to give the triplet state, which undergoes reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) to populate delayed singlet leading to delayed fluorescence (Fig. 7), or it can interact with another molecule (at higher concentrations) leading to excimer fluorescence. The reverse intersystem crossing associated with TADF arises due to close-lying singlet and triplet states.

Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out for 10–15 to obtain thermal decomposition (Td) and glass transition temperatures (Tg), respectively (Fig. S7 ESI†). The Td and Tg data obtained are presented in Table 4. The compounds 10–15 exhibit good thermal stability with Td (corresponding to 5% weight loss) in the range of 341–444 °C. In repeated DSC scans, relatively high Tg values were observed in the second heating scan between 73–125 °C. Among the six compounds, higher Tg values were noticed for 12 (104 °C), 14 (112 °C) and 15 (125 °C) than for other compounds (10, 11 and 13), which could be attributed to the increased molecular size and molecular weight. A crystallization temperature as an exothermic peak in the DSC scans was not observed for all the compounds, indicating their amorphous nature, which is required for better performance of OLEDs. Melting points exhibited in DSC scans as sharp endothermic peaks were found to be between 188 °C and 273 °C.

Electroluminescent (EL) properties
EL studies were performed for 10–15, using them as electron transport emitters with the following configuration (i): ITO (120 nm) F4-TCNQ (2.5 nm)/α-NPD (45 nm)/emissive layer 10–15 (50 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (150 nm). In this device, ITO (indium tin oxide) and LiF/Al are the anode and the cathode, respectively; α-NPD (4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenyl amino] biphenyl) is the hole transporting layer (HTL). The F4-TCNQ (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7′,8,8′-tetracyanoquinodimethane) is utilized for efficient hole injection from ITO to α-NPD and its thickness is used as optimized by Tyagi41et al. for enhanced efficiency and life time of OLEDs. Then the EL spectrum, current density–voltage–luminescence (J–V–L) characteristics and CIE co-ordinates are characterized by EL devices. Fig. 8 depicts the EL spectrum for all the molecules and their emission was found to be in the 465–491 nm wavelength range. Peak wavelength and CIE co-ordinates for each device are listed in Table 5. J–V–L characteristics of the bilayer devices using these molecules as emitters are presented in Fig. 9. The EL devices constructed using 10–15 as emitters show good EL performance over a wide range of current density. The current and power efficiency were calculated for each device and are tabulated in Table 5. The onset voltage and maximum brightness data have also been included in the same Table. All the devices were found to possess very low onset voltage, 3.5 V. The key point to be noted about the device is that these devices do not have any doped transport layer. Therefore, the onset voltage of 3.5 V indicates very high electron mobilities for these molecules. This also indicates charge carrier balance inside the emissive layer. Bilayer devices are found to possess very high brightness of around 30000 cd m−2. The efficiency of these devices was found to be very high with current efficiency (ηc) ∼ 16.0 cd A−1 and power efficiency (ηc) ∼ 8.0 lm W−1. The high efficiency data indicate that these molecules have very high electron mobilities and emission efficiencies. Further, we have also measured the external quantum efficiencies for these devices at 6.0 V. The quantum efficiencies are found to be in the range of 3.0–4.0% and these quantum efficiencies are very high for bilayer blue fluorescent OLEDs. If a 1:3 ratio of singlet to triplet excitons4c,d and 20% out-coupling efficiency for OLED structure is considered,41b,c the internal quantum efficiency of these OLEDs comes in the range of 60–80%, which is very close to the measured fluorescence efficiencies for these molecules. Therefore, these bilayer devices have a charge carrier balance factor very close to unity, which indicates that the electron mobility of these molecules is very close to the hole mobility in α-NPD.41d

 Fig. 9  Current density–voltage–luminescence (J–V–L) characteristics of compounds 10–15. 
Furthermore, to have a complete analysis of the EL properties of these molecules, we also tested them as emitters with a multilayer device structure as (ii): ITO (120 nm)/F4-TCNQ (2.5 nm)/α-NPD (45 nm)/emissive layer 10–15 (30 nm)/BCP (6 nm)/Alq3 (30 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (150 nm), which has an additional BCP as a hole blocking layer and an Alq3 electron transport layer.41e–gFig. 10 depicts the J–L characteristics for these devices. The efficiency data are listed in Table 6. Multilayer OLEDs show very high efficiencies close to 16 lm W−1 power efficiency, 45 Cd A−1 current efficiency and 9.1% external quantum efficiency. From these data, it can be seen that the results of these compounds as electron transporting emitters are very similar to their results as emitters. For the multilayer device in comparison to the bilayer, the difference in the efficiency data is nearly twofold, and compared to previous reports on emitting organic molecules it is more than fivefold.9b,42 For reference, the OLED with Alq3 as emissive layer, with the same structure, has a power efficiency close to 2 lm W−1 and with the pyrene derivative in the same configuration, the efficiency reaches as high as 10 lm W−1 and gives a difference in efficiency of a factor of 5.43 This indicates that our molecules possess very high electron mobility in comparison to Alq3. Therefore, in configuration (i), the injected electrons traversed very quickly to the HTL/EML interface, where the recombination zone is located and the high fluorescence efficiencies of these molecules give rise to very high luminous efficiencies of the devices. Hence, these molecules serve the purpose of both electron transport and emission. The selected thickness was 50 nm, which leads to a recombination zone located near the HTL/EML interface so as to avoid cathode-induced quenching, as obtained by other researchers.44 Recently reported efficiencies (external quantum) for synthesized blue emitters are 2.4% based on carbozole–dimesitylborane by Lin et al.,45a 5.0% on triphenylamine–imidazole by Li et al.,45b 3.1% and 2.0% by Zhang et al.45c and Yu et al.45d Other reports also range from 3.0–6.0%.45e,f The higher reported efficiencies in our case clearly signify the improvement made in our synthesized compounds.

We have measured the electron mobilities of these molecules using the time of flight method.46 The electron mobilities are found to be in the range of 1 × 10−4 to 5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured at an electric field of 1 × 105 V cm−1 (Table 5). To understand the reason for the high values, we carried out the calculation of the transfer integrals, using computational chemistry, between the molecules in the crystal of 13 and, for comparison, in an unsubstituted pyrene crystal obtained from the literature (Fig. 11).47 The values of the transfer integral for both electron and hole transport in the unsubstituted pyrene are large, but only in one direction, while from the figure it is clear that the charge transport in 13 has more possible channels with slightly smaller transfer integrals. This increase in channels we believe leads to larger electron mobilities. These results justify our arguments for the high efficiencies as electron transport emitters. The measured mobilities in our molecules were found to be an order of magnitude higher than the standard electron transport material Alq3.41h,46 Also from the electron mobility data, the low efficiencies in case of 14 can be explained. This molecule was found to have three times lower mobility in comparison to other materials and therefore gave rise to low efficiencies due to a charge carrier balance factor less than unity. These EL studies imply that the molecules synthesized in these studies possess excellent n-type emitting properties.

Synthesis of diphenyl(pyren-1-yl)phosphine oxide (10). 
To a suspension of 1 (3.0 g, 10.7 mmol) in dry THF (120 mL) was added n-BuLi (6.4 mL, 12.8 mmol, 2.0 M in cyclohexane) dropwise at −78 °C, under nitrogen atmosphere, which turned to a greenish suspension. Stirring was continued for another 1 h, and then chlorodiphenylphosphine (3.0 mL, 16.1 mmol) was added dropwise while maintaining the same temperature; the reaction mixture turned to a clear pale yellow solution. The resulting mixture was gradually warmed to ambient temperature and stirred for 2 h. After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), dry methanol (10 mL) was added. The organic compound was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 80 mL), and the combined organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to get a white solid. The residue obtained was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL) and H2O2 (10 mL, 30%) was added dropwise. After stirring for 4 h at room temperature, water (60 mL) was added and the organic phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 40 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The crude reaction mixture was purified by column chromatography using hexane–ethyl acetate (1:1) as the eluent to afford compound 10, which was further purified by precipitating in chloroform and diethyl ether (1:3) mixture.

Synthesis of diphenyl(4-(pyren-1-yl)phenyl)phosphine oxide (11).

Measurements
All chemicals were reagent/analytical grade and used without further purification. 1H NMR and 13C NMR were recorded on a Bruker Avance (75 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl3 with TMS as the internal standard. 31P NMR spectra were recorded on an Avance III-500 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3 with reference to phosphoric acid. Mass spectra were obtained using electron ionization (EI) ion trap mass spectrometry (Thermofinnigan, Sanzox, CA, USA) and recorded on a VG-AUTOSPEC spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed using a Vario-EL elemental analyzer. UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured using a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. Steady state fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) were estimated by integrating the fluorescence bands and by using quinine sulphate as the standard.23 The glass-transition temperature (Tg) of the compounds were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a nitrogen atmosphere and at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a DSC Q200 (TA Instruments). The Tg was determined from the second heating scan. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a TGA/SDTA 851e (Mettler Toledo) in the temperature range of 30–550 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed on a PC-controlled CHI 620C electrochemical analyzer (CH instruments). Cyclic voltammetric experiments were performed in 1 mM solution of degassed dry THF at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumperchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte. The glassy carbon was used as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and platinum wire as the counter electrode. The working electrode surface was first polished with 1 mm alumina slurry, followed by 0.3 mm alumina slurry on a micro cloth. It was then rinsed with Millipore water and also sonicated in water for 5 min. The polishing and sonication steps were repeated twice.
Fluorescence lifetime measurements
Steady state and time resolved phosphorescence measurements were carried out in a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer using a flash lamp with 0.1 ms delay after flash at RT. Time correlated single photon counting was used to measure the fluorescence lifetime in the nanosecond time scale. The femtosecond pulses at 8 MHz repetition rate were obtained from a fractional part of the MaiTai output passing through a femtosecond Pulse Selector (3980-5S, Spectra Physics). The excitation pulses at 370 nm were generated by frequency doubling the 740 nm Ti-sapphire output with a 0.5 mm BBO crystal. This excitation pulses were focused to the sample using Fluorescence Up-conversion set up (FOG100 system CDP System). The time distribution data of fluorescence intensity were recorded on a SPC-130 TCSPC module (Becker & Hickl). The instrument response function was 250 ps.
Crystal structure determination
The pyrene derivative 13 was crystallized from CH3OH–CHCl3 (1:4) and the single crystal structure was determined. It crystallizes into the monoclinic P21/c space group. All H atoms were positioned geometrically and treated as riding on their parent C atoms, with C–H distances of 0.93–0.97 Å, and with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C) or 1.5Ueq for methyl atoms. Crystal data for 13: C34H23OP, M = 478.49, colourless needle, 0.42 × 0.12 × 0.10, triclinic, space group P (no. 2), a = 9.0088(9), b = 9.6445(9), c = 14.0042(13) Å, α = 96.309(2), β = 98.1750(10), γ = 92.359(2)°, V = 1195.1(2) Å3, Z = 2, Dc = 1.330 g cm−3, F000 = 500, CCD area detector, MoKα radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å, T = 293(2)K, 2θmax = 50.0°, 11563 reflections collected, 4195 unique (Rint = 0.0174). Final GooF = 1.062, R1 = 0.0350, wR2 = 0.1011, R indices based on 3860 reflections with I > 2σ(I) (refinement on F2), 325 parameters, μ = 0.142 mm−1.
Computational methodology
To analyse the absorption spectra and molecular orbitals, quantum chemical calculations have been carried out. Optimized geometries of the molecules were obtained using density functional theory (DFT), at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)24,25 level of theory as implemented in the Gaussian09 (ref. 26) software package. Frequency calculations were carried out to ensure that the minima obtained is a stationary point on the potential energy surface. Molecular orbital surfaces are visualized using Gaussview. Solvent effects are simulated using the polarizable continuum model (PCM).27 Lowest singlet excitation energies are calculated using time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) at the pbe0/6-31g(d,p)28 level of theory, in CHCl3 solvent. The transfer integrals have been calculated at the PW91/tzp level of theory using ADF software.29
Device fabrication
For the EL studies, indium–tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates, with a sheet resistance of 20 Ω, were photolithographically patterned and cleaned using trichloroethylene, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and deionised water sequentially for 20 minutes using an ultrasonic bath and dried in flowing nitrogen. Prior to film deposition, the ITO substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 5 minutes. On the substrate, the hole transport layer, emitting layer, hole blocking layer, electron transport layer, electron injecting layer and cathode were sequentially deposited under a high vacuum (1 × 10−5 torr). The deposition rate of organic materials was kept at 1 Å s−1, whereas the deposition rates of LiF and Al were 0.5 Å s−1 and 5 Å s−1, respectively. The thickness of the deposited layers was controlled by a quartz crystal monitor. The cathode was deposited on the top of the structure through a shadow mask. N,N-Diphenyl-N′,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (α-NPD (Sigma Aldrich) was used as a hole transport layer, 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) was used as the hole blocking layer, tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)-aluminium (Alq3, Sigma Aldrich) was used as the electron transport layer, LiF (Merck, Germany) was the electron injection layer and the Al as the cathode. The size of each pixel was 3–4 mm. The ECL spectra were measured using an Ocean Optics high resolution spectrometer (HR-2000CG UV-NIR). The J–V–L characteristics were measured with a luminance meter (LMT l-1009) and a Keithley 2400 programmable voltage–current digital source meter. All the measurements were carried out at room temperature under ambient conditions.
Conclusion
In summary, an effective strategy for the design of highly efficient multifunctional emitters with good film formation characteristics has been demonstrated. The high efficiencies of the compounds synthesized are explained on the basis of different phenomenon including charge transfer and delayed fluorescence. The π–π stacking along with the other intermolecular interactions due to PO group in the solid restrict the rotation of the pyrene molecules, leading to blue emission of the pyrene excimer assisted by TADF in the excited state. These interactions also help in enhancing the electron and hole transport while the increased electron affinity due to the diphenyl phosphine oxide group helps with better electron injection. The present results demonstrate that these compounds are promising emitter cum electron-transport materials for OLEDs.
