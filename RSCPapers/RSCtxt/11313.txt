There is an urgent need to search for reliable green energy storage technologies. The electrical energy storage systems based on neutral aqueous solutions are attractive candidates compared to the present energy storage systems utilizing flammable and expensive organic electrolytes because of their improved safety, low cost and environmental friendliness. What is more, high-rate performance can be achieved due to the high ionic conductivity of the aqueous electrolytes. However, the lower electrochemical window of water limits the possible high output voltage and high energy density. Recently, many new concepts based on neutral aqueous energy storage chemistries including aqueous rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors have exhibited high power and energy densities, excellent cycling life and high Coulombic efficiency. The present paper reviews the latest advances in these new chemistries based on neutral aqueous electrolytes, and the challenges and outlooks in this field are briefly commented on and discussed.Yuping WuDr Yuping Wu is a professor at Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

1 Introduction
Recently, the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the increasing emission of greenhouse gases causing air pollution have become serious issues. There is a clear urgent need for the development of reliable green energy storage technologies to achieve a secure and reliable energy supply. Electrical energy storage (EES) systems including batteries and supercapacitors, an intermediate platform to the versatile and efficient deployment of renewable energy such as solar, wind and tide, have received worldwide attention. What is more, they play a prominent role in our future modern lives. Since the emergence and extensive use of many new types of portable electronic devices and electric vehicles (EVs) which are promisingly expected to significantly contribute to solving the problems of global warming and environmental pollution, the demand for good EES systems is becoming more and more urgent.1–5
Lithium ion batteries (LIB) have been well acknowledged as an EES system with high energy density and long cycling life, and are superior to other conventional batteries.6–10 However, their inherent safety issue related to the use of high cost, toxic and flammable organic electrolyte and superfast charging performance are still two challenges for their applications in large-scale EES systems such as electric vehicles and smart grids.11,12 Compared with the combustible organic electrolytes of LIBs, operating in environmentally friendly neutral aqueous electrolytes with high ionic conductivity, about 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of the nonaqueous ones, is attractive for electrochemical energy storage in terms of safety and cost.13–16 If both high specific power and energy densities are achieved, such EESs would be useful for power quality applications, such as to assist propelling electric vehicles that require fast acceleration and intense braking.17 Nevertheless, the previous energy storage devices using aqueous electrolytes based on different chemistries such as Ni–Cd, Ni–MH and lead acid batteries are limited in applications due to their serious ecological threat, poor cycling life and low energy density.18–20 There are a lot of endeavors to explore new EES systems.21–24
Since 2007, aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs) using positive electrode materials from commercial LIBs have attracted wide attention as a promising system because of their low capital investment, environmental friendliness and good safety, and they can be a suitable alternative because their energy density can be above that of lithium ion batteries.14,15,25–30 Different flexible EES systems based on aqueous electrolytes sprang up in recent years: there are a variety of novel aqueous alkali-ion battery chemistries31,33 and supercapacitors.32 They are potentially advantageous owing to their good safety, high ionic conductivity and the low cost of aqueous electrolytes.
In this review, we briefly discuss the recent progress and challenges associated with the EES systems based on neutral aqueous electrolytes including aqueous rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors with an emphasis on the most notable work.
2 Aqueous rechargeable batteries
Aqueous rechargeable batteries mainly include aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs) and aqueous rechargeable sodium and potassium batteries.
2.1 Aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries
An ARLB should meet the following three conditions:14
(a) It uses lithium intercalation or lithium-containing compound(s) as one or two of the electrodes;
(b) Its charge and discharge processes are based on redox reactions accompanying the gain and loss of electrons instead of absorption and desorption;
(c) It uses a lithium-containing aqueous solution as an electrolyte.
ARLBs can overcome some disadvantages of lithium ion batteries such as the high cost and safety problems, and environmental pollution problems of lead acid or Ni–Cd batteries. It may be an ideal energy storage system to satisfy the demands of a grid-scale application due to its excellent safety and reliability.14,34–36 However, since the introduction of ARLBs in 1994, the progress on improving their performance was very limited. Recently, there have been many breakthroughs which show clearly that they can present very high reversible capacity, good cycling performance, and rate capability, especially super-fast charge performance which can be comparable to filling cars engines with gasoline.13–16,28,37–41 Of course, they include positive and negative electrodes.

2.1.1 Positive electrode materials. 
There are various positive electrode materials for ARLBs, which are listed in Table 1, and their properties are also summarized in Table 1. To the best of our knowledge, spinel LiMn2O4 is considered to be an excellent candidate in ARLBs due to its low cost, good stability and electrochemical performance in aqueous electrolytes. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of LiMn2O4 in 0.5 mol L−1 Li2SO4 aqueous solution and in an organic electrolyte are shown in Fig. 1.38,42 There are two redox couples which are situated at 0.78/0.73 V and 0.92/0.83 V (vs. SCE), respectively, at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1, attributed to lithium intercalation and deintercalation in the spinel host structure in the aqueous electrolyte. Additionally, the CVs in the aqueous electrolyte at the higher scan rates, even at 100 mV s−1, present two couples of well defined and sharp redox peaks, which is much better than that in the organic electrolyte. In the case of the organic electrolyte, when the scan rate is increased to 2 mV s−1, the two couples of redox peaks could not be differentiated. From the above comparison, it is clear that the current response and the reversibility of the redox behavior in aqueous electrolytes are better than those in organic electrolytes due to the higher ionic conductivities of aqueous electrolytes.

The excellent cyclic voltammetric behavior in the aqueous electrolyte shows great promise for super-fast charge and discharge capabilities.13,38,43,44 In the case of a LiMn2O4 nanotube prepared by using multiwall carbon nanotubes as a sacrificial template, its schematic synthesis route, morphologies and electrochemical properties are shown in Fig. 2.43 It exhibits excellent rate behavior and displays a reversible capacity of 110 and 99 mA h g−1 at the charge/discharge current densities of 500 and 10000 mA g−1, respectively. The flat plateaus in the charge and discharge curves are well-defined at all current densities and the voltage decrease is very slight at very high current densities. The charge process of this positive electrode material can be finished within several seconds. Capacities of 97.3, 80.2 and 59.3 mA h g−1, corresponding to 88.5% 72.9% and 53.9% of the capacity, respectively, could be obtained at the charging rates of 120 C (30 s), 300 C (12 s), and 600 C (6 s). This super-fast second-level charge capability can be ascribed to the following reasons: (1) the ionic conductivity of the aqueous electrolyte is much higher than that of the organic electrolytes; (2) the crystal orientation of the LiMn2O4 nanotube suggests that more Li sites are exposed to the aqueous electrolyte due to the preferred growth of (400) planes; and (3) the unique nanostructure leads to the low electronic resistance and makes Li+ ions deintercalate and intercalate very easily because of a very short diffusion distance.

Its electrochemical performance is measured using Ni as the counter electrode and SCE as the reference electrode (modified from ref. 43). 
In the aqueous electrolytes, the Jahn–Teller effect still exists, which can be seen clearly from the charge and discharge curves shown in Fig. 2d. However, the porous structure can accommodate some strain/stress during the charge and discharge process. As shown in Fig. 3, a porous LiMn2O4 prepared by using polystyrene particles as a template exhibits excellent cycling performance.13 There is no more than 7% capacity loss after 10000 full cycles at 9 C (1000 mA g−1) in the neutral 0.5 mol L−1 Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Such a result is markedly superior to those reported in organic electrolytes. In contrast, the discharge capacity of the conventional solid LiMn2O4 electrode decreases rapidly in the first 2000 cycles. Only 19.8 mA h g−1 is retained after 10000 cycles. Moreover, other effective methods such as doping and surface coating can be utilized to improve the cycling behavior by buffering structural distortion during the charge/discharge process.41

As mentioned above, the nanostructure provides good performance for the positive electrode materials of ARLBs since the nanostructured materials could provide short diffusion pathways and more channels due to their high specific surface area for the intercalation/de-intercalation of Li+ ions.13,37,45 Recent studies on lithium intercalation materials have paid much attention to the nanostructured materials with various morphologies (Table 2) such as nanoporous,46–48 nanochains,44 nanotubes,43,49,50 nanowires,51 nanorods,52,53 nanosheets54 and so on. Further combination of nanostructures with traditional micrometer structures will enable their further development.

2.1.2 Negative electrode materials. 
As for the negative electrode materials of ARLBs, vanadium oxides, molybdenum oxides and some lithium intercalation compounds have been reported, and some performances are also summarized in Table 1. Research about the negative electrode materials is quite limited owing to more challenges concerning dissolution of the active cations so that some conductive polymers or carbon are coated on the surface of negative electrode materials.45,55–57 It is well known that polypyrrole (PPy) is one of the most popular conducting polymers,58,59 which has been used to modify electrode materials for lithium ion batteries. It not only serves as a conducting additive reducing the weight ratio of inert materials in the electrodes, but also acts as a coating prohibiting the dissolution of active material and associated release of metal ions during the charge and discharge process.
For example, a hybrid of V2O5 nanowires and MWCNTs coated with PPy has been prepared as an anode material for ARLBs,56 and the preparation procedure is shown in Fig. 4a, which combines a hydrothermal method with a chemical coating reaction. Its SEM and TEM micrographs (Fig. 4b and c) show that V2O5 nanowires are homogeneously entangled with MWCNTs to get a three-dimensional network structure, which is expected to provide a large interface with electrolytes for facile ion transportation and act as a conductive network with high electronic conductivity. The modes of action of the PPy coating and the MWCNTs are schematically shown in Fig. 4d. The PPy coating can prevent the dissolution of multivalent Vn+ ions so that the electrochemical performance of the negative electrode material for the ARLB is markedly improved, including the cycling life and rate capability.

The lithium intercalation/de-intercalation processes and kinetic parameters of LiV3O8 as a negative electrode material for ARLBs have been investigated by CV, chronoamperometry (CA), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).60,61 There are also three steps of the lithium ion intercalation reaction for LiV3O8 in aqueous solution, agreeing well with those in an organic electrolyte. The rate capability of a nanorod LiV3O8 prepared by a sol–gel method is very good. When it is further coated with a thin layer of PPy, its cycling behavior is also greatly improved.55
Metals such as Zn and Sn can also be used as negative electrode materials for ARLBs since they can combine with the positive electrode as mentioned above to achieve a higher discharge voltage and energy density.62–66


2.1.3 Battery systems. 
Since Dahn's research group first reported an ARLB system with VO2 and LiMn2O4 as negative and positive electrode materials, respectively, in 1994,25 there has been much exploration into ARLB systems, as listed in Table 3. Some properties are also summarized in Table 3. Here we take one example for illustration.

An ARLB consisting of a nanocomposite of PPy@MoO3 and LiMn2O4 displays excellent rate capability and good cycling performance (Fig. 5).45 CV curves of the negative and positive electrodes in 0.5 mol L−1 Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1 show that both of them are stable in aqueous electrolyte and can take part in reversible redox reactions as shown in eqn (1): (1)
 Fig. 5  (a) CV curves of the nanocomposite of MoO3 coated with PPy and the nanochain LiMn2O4 at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1, (b) charge and discharge curves of the nanocomposite negative electrode, the nanochain LiMn2O4 positive electrode and the ARLB system consisting of the two electrodes, (c) the cycling behavior of the ARLBs at 1000 mA g−1 based on LiMn2O4, and (d) Ragone plots of the ARLB systems using 0.5 mol L−1 Li2SO4 aqueous solution (modified from ref. 45). 
The electrochemical window of this ARLB can be up to 2.0 V. The charge cut-off voltage can be extended to 1.95 V without evident side reactions. In the charge and discharge curves, there are two evident plateaus, indicating clearly the redox reactions of LiMn2O4. The average charge and discharge voltages are 1.40 and 1.22 V, respectively. The cycling behavior of the ARLBs from the nanocomposite exhibits an improved cycling behavior compared with that from the pristine MoO3 because that PPy coating can not only prevent or inhibit the dissolution of Mo ions but also buffer the possible volume changes during the cycling process. The energy density of this ARLB is 45 W h kg−1 at 350 W kg−1 and even maintains 38 W h kg−1 at 6 kW kg−1. This excellent rate capability can be compared with that of supercapacitors, which is ascribed to the nanochain structure of LiMn2O4 and the conductive PPy coating decreasing the charge transfer resistance.
When overpotentials are employed, the stable working voltage of ARLBs can be expanded leading to an increase in energy density. However, it is known that the electrochemically stable window is very narrow due to the decomposition of water, which is the main bottleneck for the further increase of the energy density of ARLBs. The output voltage could not be increased too high. Consequently, further direction is needed to break through this limit.

2.2 Aqueous rechargeable sodium and potassium batteries
The price of raw materials in ARLBs could still be a limitation for large-scale EES systems, therefore aqueous rechargeable sodium batteries (ARSBs) appear to be a promising and attractive alternative to their lithium counterparts because of the wide availability and low cost of sodium resources.67 However, ARSBs are rarely reported except a few Na-intercalation materials. On the one hand, the radius of Na+ (0.102 nm), especially the hydrated sodium ion (0.358 nm), is much larger than those of H+ and Li+, making the intercalation reactions more difficult and leading to the low capacity of the active materials. On the other hand, the bulky sodium ion during the intercalation leads to lattice deformation, resulting in the collapse of the crystal structure and poor cycling stability. In the case of aqueous rechargeable potassium batteries (ARPB), there are even fewer reports. Since they are batteries, they include positive and negative electrodes.

2.2.1 Positive electrode materials. 
Inspired by the positive electrode materials of ARLBs, some rich sodium (potassium) transition metal oxides such as birnessite type MnO2, NaxMnO2, and KxMnO2 can be used as the positive electrode materials. They present good reversible intercalation/deintercalation of sodium and potassium ions.68–71 Na0.44MnO2 (ref. 72–74) is used as a positive electrode with a high diffusion coefficient of about 10−13–10−12 cm2 s−1. It presents three pairs of redox peaks in the CV curves (Fig. 6), which are related to phase transitions. The optimized Na0.44MnO2 shows a specific capacity of 45 mA h g−1 with good cyclability for 1000 cycles. λ-MnO2 is able to deliver a specific capacity up to 100 mA h g−1.75
 Fig. 6  Cyclic voltammogram of the Na0.44MnO2 electrode material in 1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (modified from ref. 73). 
Prussian blue analogues with an open framework of general formula AxPR(CN)6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2), in which P+m and R+n coordinate to the nitrogen and carbon ends of the CN-group, respectively, and A atoms can be intercalated in the interstitial sites that result from the large cages, have also been investigated. Recently, copper and nickel hexacyanoferrates (KCuFe(CN)6 and KNiFe(CN)6) and copper–nickel alloy hexacyanoferrate (CuNiHCF) materials offer ultra-long cycling life, high capacity, and very low hysteresis allowing the development of devices with very high energy efficiency for the positive electrodes of ARSBs and ARPBs and application in grid-scale energy storage.76–79 Nanoparticles of sodium iron hexacyanoferrate have been employed as positive electrode materials for ARSBs.80 These materials have a theoretical capacity up to 60 mA h g−1. The discharge plateau of KNiFe(CN)6 in aqueous electrolyte is at 0.59 V (vs. SHE) for sodium ions, and 0.69 V for potassium ions, and that of KCuFe(CN)6 is at 0.9 V and 0.95 V (vs. SHE) for sodium and potassium ions, respectively. What is more, the operating voltage of CuNiHCF is tunable based on its composition, which decreases dramatically with the increase of Ni content. The copper hexacyanoferrate has an ultra-low strain open framework structure, and presents excellent cycling behavior. After 40000 deep discharge cycles at a 17 C rate, 83% of the original capacity is retained.78 Even at a very high cycling rate of 83 C, two thirds of its maximum discharge capacity is achieved. This good rate performance can be ascribed to the rapid kinetic behavior of Na+ intercalation at modest current densities. The energy efficiencies can be up to 99%. In other words, it seems that the open framework structures of rigid MHCFs (M refers to Cu, Ni, or their mixture) have greater durability compared to more extensively studied metal oxide electrode materials.81


2.2.2 Negative electrode materials. 
To the best of our knowledge, there are a few negative electrode materials for ARSBs and ARPBs. NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 can be viewed as a successful example.82,83 CV and galvanostatic discharge/charge tests indicate that sodium can be reversibly intercalated into the host structure in aqueous Na2SO4 solution, presenting a stable charge and discharge platform at −0.82 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with reversible capacity of 120 mA h g−1, 70% of the reversible capacity is retained even at the 100 C rate due to its fast ionic conducting structure for sodium. Some promising polymers such as polyimide and poly(2-vinylanthraquinone) can be used as the negative electrode for ARSBs.84,85
Zinc can be a good negative electrode since its redox potential is 0.13 V (vs. SHE) and its reversible redox reactions in the aqueous solutions of ZnAc2 and NaAc are very good,86 whose CV curves are shown in Fig. 7. In the case of the positive electrode Na0.95MnO2, the de-intercalation and intercalation of Na+ ions are not affected in the aqueous electrolyte.

2.2.3 Battery systems. 
From the above illustration, it is known that there are three types of negative electrode materials: oxides participating in redox reactions, transition metal oxides based on intercalation/deinercalation, and the metals Zn or Sn based on plating/dissolution during the charge and discharge processes. Some ARSBs are summarized in Table 4. Here we take the ARSB based on Zn and Na0.95MnO2 as one example.86 Its charge and discharge process and electrochemical performance are shown in Fig. 8. Its average discharge voltage is 1.4 V. It can be charged and discharged at a high rate up to 15 C at least, which can meet the rapid change of power supply and demand from the grids. Its energy density can be up to 78 W h kg−1 based on the two electrode materials. Its cycling performance is very good with only 8% capacity loss after 1000 cycles at 4 C between 1 and 2 V.

2.3 High energy density ARLBs
The main disadvantage of the aforementioned ARLBs, which can be called the first generation of ARLBs (1G ARLBs), is that their output voltage and energy density are still much lower than those of conventional lithium ion batteries due to the limit of the electrochemically stable window of water.14,16,28 Since the output voltage of the new ARLBs is much higher above this window and can be above 4.0 V, these ARLBs are discussed in this separate section. Of course, they can also be called the second generation (2G) ARLBs. The main feature of these 2G ARLBs is that they use stable lithium metal as the negative electrode.

2.3.1 Stable lithium metal. 
If negative electrode materials of lower redox potentials can be stable in aqueous electrolytes, high energy density systems will be feasible. For the traditional systems, the removal of oxygen is very crucial.36 Recently, our group invented a coated lithium metal that is stable in neutral aqueous solution and the removal of oxygen is not needed.87–89 It is well-known that alkali metals are very active, and belongs to the “fire” category. Aqueous solutions surely belong to “water” in the traditional five elements theory of China. It is known that fire and water are not compatible. To make them compatible, a “wood” is needed. Wood consists mostly of polymers. Then we put a layer of polymer (GPE) on the surface of the lithium metal. The GPE consists of our homemade sandwiched polymer membrane, such as PVDF (poly(vinyl difluoride))/PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate))/PVDF structure, with organic electrolyte. However, water molecules can slowly dissolve the lithium salt and organic solvents in the gel polymer electrolyte, and lithium ions cannot transport between the lithium metal and the aqueous solution. Another layer, a glass-ceramic layer (LISICON from Ohara, Japan) which belongs to “earth”, is used. LISICON film is a solid electrolyte (σLi+ > 10−4 S cm−1) which can also act as a separator and allows only the pass-through of Li+ ions between both sides of the film while the pass-through of protons, water, hydrated and solvated ions is forbidden. This composite layer makes the lithium metal very stable, whose structure is schematically shown in Fig. 9a. In 0.5 mol L−1 Li2SO4 electrolyte, the coated lithium metal ensures good electrochemical stability; only Li+ ions can transfer between Li metal and the outside via the LISICON film and the GPE, and dissolution and plating of Li can reversibly happen at about −2.70 V (vs. SCE) (Fig. 9b). When Li metal is only coated by the membrane of the gel polymer electrolyte, the coated lithium metal is still stable in the aqueous solution even when the temperature is up to 60 °C.
 Fig. 9  (a) Schematic illustration of the coated lithium metal, and (b) CV curves in the first scan of the coated lithium metal at the scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (modified from ref. 26). 
The recent introduction of the solid electrolytes (LISICON) based on selective conduction of the Li+ ion paves a new way for constructing lithium batteries of high energy density by using Li-metal as the negative electrode.87–90 Therefore, a new strategy for aqueous rechargeable batteries using water-soluble redox couples as the positive electrode or other positive electrodes is also possible.


2.3.2 Positive electrodes. 
Positive electrode materials include lithium transition metal oxides such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, Li[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O2 and LiFePO4, which are also used as positive electrode materials for lithium ion batteries and 1G ARLBs. They are formerly discussed in the section for the 1G ARLBs, and will not be discussed here again since their performance is similar to that discussed in Section 2.1.1. In addition, NiOOH, AgO, Ag, Cu, and Fe(CN6)3−/Fe(CN6)4− couples, can be used as the positive electrode materials.91–95 Recently, some redox couples based on an aqueous electrolyte, such as I3−/I−, have been explored as positive electrodes.31,96 Their electrochemical reactions are simpler and can be described as in eqn (2):96 (2)
These successful candidates have higher energy densities and reasonable charge stability. The high solubility of the triiodide/iodide redox couple shows fast electrochemical reaction kinetics. Its specific capacity is 207 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 2.5 mA cm−2. This provides a chance to prepare 2G ARLBs of high energy density.


2.3.3 Electrochemical behaviors of 2G ARLBs. 
We combined the coated Li metal as mentioned above with lithium intercalation compounds such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2 and LiFePO4 to prepare a 2G ARLB as in Fig. 10a,26,27,97 whose average output voltage and energy density are markedly higher than those of the 1G ARLBs. It also presents good cycling and rate performance. When LiMn2O4 is used as the positive electrode, the CV curve of the 2G ARLB presents two couples of redox peaks situated at 4.14/3.80 and 4.28/3.93 V, respectively, at the scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 10b), which is consistent with the charge and discharge curves (Fig. 10c). It indicates that this kind of “potential cross-over”, which is similar to the electrode double layer, can assemble 2G ARLBs with a stable working voltage up to 4 V, a break-through of the stable electrochemical window of water (1.23 V). Its cycling is excellent with a Coulombic efficiency of 100% except in the first cycle (Fig. 10d). Its energy density can be 446 W h kg−1 based on the electrode materials, about 80% higher than that for the traditional lithium ion battery. Its energy efficiency can be above 95%.
 Fig. 10  (a) Schematic illustration of our designed new ARLBs using the coated lithium metal as negative electrode, lithium intercalation compounds as positive electrode and aqueous solution as electrolyte, (b) CV curve of the new ARLB with LiMn2O4 as positive electrode at the scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1, (c) Galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of the ARLB at the current density of 100 mA g−1 based on the mass of LiMn2O4 between 3.7 and 4.25 V in the first cycle, and (d) cycling behavior of the ARLB (modified from ref. 26 and 27). 
When solutions of some redox flow batteries are used as the positive electrodes, a 2G ARLB with good safety and large capacity at an acceptable cost can be easily circulated in a flow-through configuration.33,90,98,99 This new concept 2G ARLB is different from the semi-solid redox flow batteries100,101 since it uses Li metal in an organic electrolyte as negative electrode and an aqueous solution of a redox-couple as the positive electrode. It has the advantages of high energy density from lithium metal and an independent operation on power and energy capacity from redox flow battery. Additionally, it also reduces self-discharge for the redox flow battery system. In the case of the 2G ARLB based on Li//I, its energy density can be 330 W h kg−1, approximately twice that of lithium ion batteries.96 Its power density eventually approaches 34.8 mW cm−2 at 12 mA cm−2 associated with a discharge voltage of 2.9 V. Moreover, the Li//I battery exhibits excellent cycling performance, capacity retention with no degradation after 100 cycles and ideal Coulombic efficiency, superior to those of Li//air and Li//S batteries.
Briefly, the 2G ARLBs will surely be promising for energy storage systems in electric vehicles due to their low cost, more reliable safety and high energy density. They provide another chemistry for post lithium ion batteries. However there are many remaining challenges during their infancy, especially in optimizing the battery structure, searching for an appropriate positive electrode, and improving both the ionic conductivity and stability of LISICON film at any environmental condition, such as over the full range of pH.102,103

3 Aqueous supercapacitors
Supercapacitors or electrochemical capacitors (ECs) are energy storage devices which can provide higher power density as compared to batteries and higher energy density than conventional capacitors. They are regarded as promising energy storage devices for electric vehicles, and have attracted intensive attention.104–106 Here we focus on neutral aqueous medium, i.e. lithium, sodium and potassium solutions in a wide range of concentrations, which are promising electrolytes for supercapacitors because they are cheap, non-corrosive and allow for application of a diverse range of current collectors, making the supercapacitor assembling process much easier and cheaper. Additionally, such electrolytes are electrochemically stable and environmentally friendly.107
Depending on the energy storage mechanism, supercapacitors can be classified into two general categories: electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.108 EDLCs store charges electrostatically via reversible ion absorption/desorption at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which commonly use carbon-based active electrode materials with high surface area.109 In contrast, pseudocapacitors use reversible redox reactions at the surface of electroactive materials for charge storage.110 Typical active pseudocapacitive materials include transition metal oxides and electronically conducting redox polymers such as polyaniline (PAn), polypyrrole (PPy), polythiophene (PTh) and their derivatives.57 Here we discuss their electrode materials according to their different mechanisms.
3.1 Electrode materials based on electrochemical double layer absorption/desorption
In neutral aqueous solutions, so far there are only carbon materials with high surface area that display electrochemical double layered capacitive behavior. To date, various forms of carbonaceous materials such as activated carbons (ACs),111 mesoporous carbons,112 activated carbon fabrics113 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)114 have been utilized for both symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors. These carbon-based materials offer some advantageous features including low cost, high electronic conductivity, good electrochemical stability with long cycling life and tunable porous structures. Most recently, graphene115 and graphene-based composites116–118 have been investigated because of their unique structures and high specific surface area (2630 m2 g−1).
In the case of ACs, the pores including micro-, meso-, and macro-pores are randomly distributed in the ACs, the pore sizes have a significant influence on capacitance which is closely related to the electrolyte.119,120 In neutral solutions, the ion size presents different behavior at different current or power densities. For example, in 0.5 mol L−1 Li2SO4, Na2SO4 and K2SO4 aqueous electrolytes, the rate behavior of the AC improves in the order of Li2SO4 < Na2SO4 < K2SO4 (Fig. 11a). This can be attributed to the different hydrated ionic radius contributing to the different charge densities and different migration speeds.120 The hydrated ionic radius of K+ is the smallest and its ionic conductivity is the highest, consequently its access to the inner pores of AC is much easier, and the relaxation time for the migration of the hydrated K+ is the shortest at the high scan rate. In addition, the equivalent series resistances (ESR) for the three electrolytes decrease in the order of Li2SO4 > Na2SO4 > K2SO4 (Fig. 11b). As a result, K2SO4-based electrolyte exhibits the largest capacitance at the high scan rates (Fig. 11c). At the low scan rate, the capacitance is mainly determined by the size of un-hydrated cations, which decreases in the order of Li+ < Na+ < K+. As a result, the capacitance increases in the same order, i.e. Li+ > Na+ > K+. They present very stable cycling in the neutral electrolytes, which opens a platform for aqueous supercapacitors based on neutral electrolytes.

The inset shows the cycling behaviors of AC in the three electrolytes (modified from ref. 120). 
Chemically converted graphene (CCG) retains a rectangular shape at the slow scan rates in 1 mol L−1 Li2SO4 solution (Fig. 12a).121 The voltage is up to 1.6 and even 1.8 V when the oxygen in the Li2SO4 aqueous solution is removed. It also exhibits good rate and long cycling performances. A specific capacitance of 202 or 138 F g−1 is achieved at a galvanostatic charge/discharge rate of 1 or 200 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 12b). Over 88.8% of specific capacitance is retained after 2000 cycles at a high current density of 100 A g−1 (Fig. 12c).

3.2 Electrode materials based on absorption/desorption and redox reactions
Any material has some specific surface area, and absorption/desorption is unavoidable. It is well known that some transition-metal oxides such as amorphous RuO2,122 MnO2,105,123 V2O5 (ref. 56, 81 and 124) and MoO3,45,104,125 as well as some polymers such as PAn, PPy, PTh and their derivatives exhibit pseudocapacitive properties.57 Their large specific pseudocapacitance (typically 300–1000 F g−1) exceeds that of carbon-based materials (typically 100–250 F g−1) based on double layer charge storage. Of course, the positive electrode materials for ARLBs can also be good positive electrode materials for aqueous supercapacitors since they also present good and reversible redox reactions, which present good pseudocapacitance. Since they are discussed in Section 2.1.1, here they will not be repeated.
Material morphology is closely related to the specific surface area and the diffusion of ions. Pseudocapacitive technology has been benefited greatly by moving from conventional to nanostructured materials.110 The nanostructured materials have drawn intense attention to develop better supercapacitors because of their high surface area, nanosize effects, significantly enhanced kinetics and high capacitance. For example, a nanocomposite of molybdenum trioxide104,126 (α-MoO3) nanobelts coated with polypyrrole (PPy), whose morphology is shown in Fig. 13a and b, presents one pair of redox peaks at −0.45 and −0.32 V (vs. SCE), respectively, corresponding to the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of K+ ions into/from the MoO3 matrix in its CV curves (Fig. 13c), indicating a good negative electrode for supercapacitors. Even at the high scan rate of 40 mV s−1, the redox peaks are still evident. Of course, the nanocomposite can also present good reversible intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ and Na+ ions into/from the MoO3 matrix.

For different neutral aqueous electrolytes containing a lithium salt of Beti−, C6H13CO2−, ClO4− or NO3−,127 MnO2 presents better electrochemical performance in the electrolytes based on a mineral lithium salt than the organic anions, including good material stability and capacity retention. MnO2 nanorods with a surface area of 135 m2 g−1 present a better capacitive behavior than the micrometer material.123 It is similar to AC,120 MnO2 presents the best rate capability in the K2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and the highest capacitance in the Li2SO4 one.123 When a conductive network such as MWCNTs is introduced, the rate capability will be much improved.105 Nanohybrids of LiMn2O4 and nanoporous LiMn2O4 can also achieve better capacitive behaviors.48,128,129
The positive electrode materials for ARSBs and ARPBs such as NaxMnO2 and KxMnO2 can also be good positive electrode materials for supercapacitors.69–71,73 When they exist as nanostructures such as nanowires, their capacitive behavior will be much improved.
3.3 Aqueous supercapacitors
In neutral aqueous electrolytes, symmetric supercapacitors can be assembled by using carbonaceous materials such as AC, CNTs and graphene as both electrodes.119 In the case of supercapacitors based on graphene, the voltage range is much higher than those based on acidic or basic electrolytes.121 However, most supercapacitors are asymmetric, and some of them including their partial electrochemical performance are summarized in Table 5. Here we take the supercapacitor of AC//KxMnO2·nH2O as an example.

The charge and discharge curves of the supercapacitor of AC//KxMnO2·nH2O in 0.5 mol L−1 K2SO4 electrolyte at 2 C rate present slight plateaus at about 1.2 V (Fig. 14a), which is due to the KxMnO2·nH2O positive electrode. It exhibits short plateaus at about 0.6 and 0.4 V (vs. SCE) during the charge and discharge process, respectively. Similar to the supercapacitor of AC//MnO2 in neutral aqueous electrolytes,123 it also presents excellent cycling life (Fig. 14b). Without the removal of oxygen in the aqueous electrolyte, there is no clear capacitance fading after 10000 full cycles. As mentioned above, AC and MnO2 present the best rate capability in the K2SO4 aqueous electrolyte among the Li2SO4, Na2SO4 and K2SO4 aqueous electrolytes. The AC//KxMnO2·nH2O supercapacitor also shows better rate capability than that based on AC//LiMn2O4. At the higher power, its energy density is higher than that based on AC//LiMn2O4 though its energy density is smaller at the lower power (Fig. 14c).71

In the case of the asymmetric supercapacitors, the weight ratios of each electrode should be optimized to assure the capacitance of the negative electrode is a little over that of the positive electrode.126 For example, in the case of the supercapacitor based on AC and PPy@MoO3 in 0.5 mol L−1 K2SO4 electrolyte, their optimal weight ratio is 1:1.
Due to the good advantages of the neutral aqueous electrolytes, the aqueous supercapacitors based on neutral electrolytes exhibit high energy and power densities, excellent cycling life and environmental friendliness as shown in Table 5. Of course, their cost is much cheaper than those based on organic electrolytes. These exciting results offer new chances for the rapid development of supercapacitors.
4 Summary and outlooks
As the most ideal electrolyte solvent, water is abundant and environmentally friendly. The above discussion shows clearly that the latest explored energy storage systems based on neutral aqueous electrolytes provide several advantages over the traditional energy storage systems:
• Low cost: inexpensive and good availability of salts such as Li2SO4 and LiNO3 instead of expensive LiPF6, which do not need rigorously strict humidity control of the assembling environment as batteries based on organic electrolytes do and their requirements on separators are low.
• Suitable for charging and discharging at high rates: high ionic conductivity of the aqueous electrolytes.
• Satisfactory or high energy density based on both electrodes.
• High power density competitive with fuel cells and capacitors.
• Long cycling life.
• High Coulombic efficiency.
• Environmental friendliness: completely green, which is superior to lithium ion batteries having serious HF acid pollution to the environment due to the reaction of the used LiPF6 with water.
• More safe: no combustibility or explosion compared with the energy storage systems based on flammable organic electrolytes.
Of course, these advantages are achieved due to the new preparation technologies, especially coating and nanostructures. New concepts such as aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries of high energy density (2 G ARLBs) are also important to break through the electrochemically stable window of water, which provide new directions for post lithium ion batteries. Introduction of nanostructures together with the traditional intercalation compounds leads to an increase of energy and power densities and excellent cycling life of supercapacitors.
The above characteristics are also important for these systems in storing energy from electrical grids connected with intermittent energy sources such as solar, wind and hydropower. It is also important to lower the cost and meet the stringent safety requirements of batteries for pure electric vehicles. The challenges to significantly increase the specific output power and energy density of batteries urgently need to be solved.100,144 Some directions are very important for the further development of energy storage systems based on neutral aqueous electrolytes:
(1) New energy storage chemistries are still needed to explore. For example, MnO2 can be the reversible host for some divalent cations such as Zn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Ba2+ in aqueous electrolytes,130–132 and the +2 cations can suppress the activation energy barrier for the interfacial charge transfer of a prussian blue analog thin film electrode.133,134 The Al3+ ion also presents reversible storage behavior in anatase TiO2 nanotube arrays.135 The mixed system (Li,Na)FePO4//FePO4 is also possible.136,137 Aqueous rechargeable batteries such as Ni//Fe,138,139 Co(OH)2//Ni(OH)2,140 TiO2//Ni(OH)2,141 and aqueous Li//S rechargeable batteries142 have been proposed. The concept of a desalination battery with a simple construction and a promising energy efficiency is fascinating since it has fewer corrosion problems than the existing desalination technology by using readily available materials.143 Undoubtedly, such efforts are important and need more encouragement. Combination of batteries with supercapacitors is also a good way to realize the balance between energy and power densities.
(2) New materials are crucial to push forward the application of these energy storage systems. For example, solid electrolytes need much improvement in mechanical processing, ionic conductivity and stability in different aqueous electrolytes.146–149
(3) More preparation or modification methods for electrode materials are still required. For example, electrode materials with good crystal orientation to realize much faster charging or discharging behavior require good templates.13,43 Micro-/nano-structured materials with excellent electrochemical performances are another focus since nanostructures provide short diffusion pathways and large specific surface area and the microstructure provides good processing and stability.144,145
