    , Accepted 14th December 2016First published on 14th December 2016AbstractThe influence of halogen atom substitution (Br and I), in different amounts and positions in an aza-BODIPY skeleton, on the photophysical properties of some aza-BODIPY derivatives has been investigated by using density functional theory and its time-dependent extension. The heavy atom effect on excitation energies, singlet–triplet energy gaps and spin–orbit matrix elements has been considered. The maximum absorption within the therapeutic window has been confirmed for all the aza-BODIPY derivatives. The feasible intersystem spin crossing pathways for the population of the lowest triplet state, that will depend on the values of the spin–orbit matrix elements, the energy gap as well as the orbital composition of the involved states have been found to most likely involve the S1 and T1 or T2 states. The outcomes of computations support the potential therapeutic use of these compounds as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy.
1. Introduction
4,4-Difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) and its aza (aza-BODIPY) derivatives have been proposed for several technological applications such as biological labelling, electroluminescent devices, tunable laser dyes, solid-state solar concentrators, fluorescent switches, fluorophores in sensors, thanks to the relatively simple synthesis, high redox and thermodynamic stability, and peculiar photophysical properties (large absorption extinction coefficients, sharp emission and quantum fluorescence yields).1–6 Starting from the seminal works of O'Shea and co-workers,7 BODIPY derivatives have also been proposed as promising photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy (PDT).8–10 The photosensitizer's photodynamic action starts with the absorption of a photon followed by competing radiative and nonradiative reactions which ultimately lead to the oxidative degradation of essential biomolecules. Molecular oxygen plays a crucial role in propagating the initial biomolecule damage, leading to the formation of organic radicals and activated oxygen species which act to cause diseased cell death. The basic mechanism of PDT includes the excitation of the photosensitizer with appropriate wavelength light (S0 → Sn) and a successive energy transfer to a triplet state (Sn → Tn) via a nonradiative intersystem spin crossing (ISC).2,3,11 The photophysical processes that follow the photosensitizer's triplet state population can essentially give rise to two types of photoreactions, called type I and type II. In the former electron or hydrogen-atom transfer between the T1 sensitizer and the substrate molecules occurs yielding radical ions and free radicals. While, the latter involves an energy transfer between the excited triplet sensitizer and ground-state molecular oxygen (3O2) to yield singlet oxygen (1Δg) species. Thus, the photodynamic effect mainly results from the energy and/or electron transfer of the excited triplet photosensitizer to an organic substrate or molecular oxygen. Most of the photosensitizers currently under evaluation degrade the biological target mainly via Type II photoreactions. Accordingly, 1O2 is considered the principal cytotoxic agent in PDT.
Several porphyrin-like photosensitizers have been proposed so far and some of them are in various phases of clinical trials or are currently used in the PDT for the treatment of various cancers and other diseases,3,12–16 such as ®Foscan17 and temocene.18,19 Several non-porphyrin systems such as squaraine dyes,20,21 substituted perylenediimides,22 bisanthracene bis(dicarboxylic imide)s23 and ipericine24 have also been investigated. Nevertheless, most of these systems possess intrinsic drawbacks, such as dark toxicity and low absorption in the NIR region and, consequently, low penetration power in the tissue. BODIPY dyes, although generally have the wavelength for maximum absorption falling outside the therapeutic window and are highly fluorescent, hardly undergo efficient ISC, have the advantage of being surely non-toxic in the dark and, once structurally modified, can be able to absorb within the right range and to efficiently generate excited singlet oxygen.1,8–10 Furthermore, their chemical functionalization is relatively inexpensive and they are stable against redox reactions that can occur in the body.
Recently, a series of aza-BODIPYs differently substituted with bromine or iodine atoms, with an intense absorption band in the near infrared region, have been found to be able to generate singlet oxygen in high yield.1 Thanks to their non-dark toxicity, high stability and the enhanced quantum yields of triplet excited states, some of them can be proposed as promising PDT photosensitizers.
The application of first principles methods in the elucidation of photophysical properties, such as excitation energies, singlet–triplet energy gaps and spin–orbit matrix elements, of relatively large molecules is well established.19,21,23–30 We report here a computational study, at DFT and TDDFT levels of theory, on the photophysical properties of systems reported in Scheme 1 with the aim of elucidating the origin of the improved 1O2 production.

2. Computational section
All the computations have been carried out by using the Gaussian 0931 code at DFT and its time dependent formulation TDDFT32 levels of theory.
On the basis of our previous experiences on the photophysical properties of similar and other systems,27–30 ground and excited state optimization has been performed by using the M0633 exchange correlation functional coupled with the 6-31G* basis sets for all the atoms with the exception of bromine and iodine, for which the SSD pseudopotential has been employed34 in the framework of DFT and TDDFT levels of theory, respectively. The excitation energies have been calculated by substituting the 6-31G* basis set with the 6-31+G* ones. The inclusion of the solvent effects has been made by means of the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM)35,36 which corresponds to a linear response in equilibrium and non-equilibrium solvation, and in geometry optimization of excited and ground states, respectively. A dielectric constant of 46.826 has been used in order to take into account the dielectric media of the solvent used in the experiments,1 dimethyl sulfoxide.
As in all cases the ground and first excited singlet states exhibit approximately the same structural parameters, spin–orbit matrix elements have been computed by using the DALTON code37 at the ground state equilibrium geometries. The quadratic-response TDDFT approach has been applied by employing the exchange and correlation functional B3LYP.38,39 As suggested by the authors, the cc-pVDZ basis set has been selected for H, C, N, F and O, while the SDD pseudopotential has been used for Br and I atoms. Therefore, while the atomic-mean field approximation40 has been employed for 1a, the spin–orbit coupling operators for effective core potentials with the effective nuclear charge41 have been used for the other derivatives.
3. Results and discussion
The investigated systems differ in the position and the number of halogens substituted in the aza-BODIPY skeleton of compound 1a (see Scheme 1). In 1b and 1c, halogen atoms (Br and I) occupy the peripheral position, while in 2a two iodine atoms are inserted in the two pyrrole rings of the aza-BODIPY core. Compound 2b is characterized by the presence of two extra iodine atoms in the peripheral position. Finally, system 3 contains the highest amount of halogen atoms investigated here, six iodine atoms in both the peripheral and aza-BODIPY core.
3.1 Ground and excited state geometries
The optimization of ground (S0) and low lying singlet (S1, S2) and triplet (T1, T2) excited states reveals that in all cases the structural parameters that undergo a significant variation in going from ground to excited states are the dihedral angles (see Table 1), and no significant changes have been found in both bond lengths and valence angles, including those involving the halogen atoms. For example, it can be seen that in 3 the bond distance between C20 and I atoms on the BODIPY core assumes approximately the same value in going from S0, S1, S2, T1 and T2 states.

The aza-BODIPY core retains the planarity in the ground and excited states for all the investigated systems. While, the torsional angles, which account for the orientation of the aryl substituent with respect to the BODIPY core, show some interesting variations, such as Ψ2 that in compounds 1a–c for the S1 and T1 states assumes values about 20 degrees higher than in S0 and T2 ones. In compound 3, the presence of iodine atoms in both the core and peripheral position causes a significant variation in Ψ2 and Ψ3 as the aromatic ring rotates in order to alleviate the conformational strength with a consequent reduction of the electron delocalization. In 3 also the electron-donor methoxy group undergoes conformational changes (see Ψ5 values in Table 1) because of the steric effect generated by the adjacent iodine atom.

 Fig. 1  Graphical representation of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied MOs involved in the vertical transitions obtained from the equilibrium geometries of ground, GS, and excited states, S1, S2, T1 and T2 at the M06/6-31G* level of theory for (a) 2a and (b) 3. The plots of the orbitals were accomplished with an isodensity value of 2 × 10−2 a.u. 
From data in Table 2 it emerges that most of the aza-BODIPY investigated showed absorption in the red region (620–750 nm). The effect of including the iodine atoms to the BODIPY core in 2a, b derivatives results in a slight hypsochromic shift of about 20 nm with respect to the derivative that does not contain any heavy atoms (1a), while a blue-shift of more than 30 nm has been found with respect to compounds which contain halogen atoms in peripheral positions (1b, c).
The aza-BODIPY derivative which had both periphery and core substitution exhibits a maximum absorption at approximately the same wavelength of 1a, that does not contain halogen atoms (621 vs. 623 nm), according to what has been reported by Ramaiah and co-workers.1 Anyhow, the comparison between computed and experimental wavelengths shows a reasonable agreement with an error of few tens of nm, typically found for these systems.29,31 However, it is noteworthy that the deviations between theory and experiment can be in part ascribable to the inherent limits of TDDFT, which does not take into account double excitations, and in part to the use of vertical approximation and the linear response solvent effects, as recently shown.42
For 1a–c and 2a, b compounds the oscillator strength (f) of the first singlet excited state, S1, assumes values higher than 0.8, while S2 is found to be dark in nature. In contrast, in 3 the S2 state has an f value of 0.704 and S1 is found to be very weak in intensity (f = 0.092). In 1a–c and 2a, b systems, S1 is originated by a HOMO → LUMO transition, while in 3 the transition HOMO−1 → LUMO dominates about 80% of the dark first excited state. The plot of molecular orbitals reported in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†) clearly reveals that the electronic transition occurs from π to π* orbitals. Similar to the first excited state in the other molecules, S2 in 3 is due to a HOMO → LUMO excitation and results to be ππ* in nature (Fig. 1). The low lying triplet state T1 involves ππ* transition (HOMO → LUMO) in compounds in which the halogen substitution is accomplished exclusively in the para position of the peripheral aryl groups (1b, c, see Fig. S2, ESI†), while in compound 2a, where the iodine atoms occupy a position on the BODIPY core, the transition involves orbitals with different nature, πn*, as the LUMO is dominated by the lone pairs of the heavy atom directly bound to the core. Interestingly, in 2b and 3 in which the iodine atoms are present, in different amounts, in both peripheral and core positions (see Scheme 1), the effect of the heavy atom on the BODIPY core plays the major role in the characterization of the state, with the LUMO being again localized on the lone pairs of one iodine atom.
Concerning the T2 state it can be noted that a transition between orbitals with different nature significantly contributes to this excited state for 1c, 2a, b and 3, as the transition involves the LUMO (HOMO−3 → LUMO for 1c and 2a, b, and HOMO−1 → LUMO for 3). In contrast in 1a, b, although T2 is originated by the same transition as 1c, the LUMO is characterized by the delocalization on the BODIPY core, then the transition is of type ππ* (see Fig. S2, ESI†).
In order to verify if the investigated aza-BODIPY derivatives can be proposed as efficient photosensitizers for PDT, the computed vertical energy gaps between singlet ground and low lying triplet electronic states (ΔES–T), included in Table 3, will be discussed. As can be seen, a common feature in the computed excited states is the T1 energy below the S1 one, together with the T2 excited state. In addition, it is evident that ΔE(S0–T1) gaps are closer to 0.9 eV,32 the energy computed to be necessary to activate O2 from its ground triplet (3Σg) to the excited singlet state (1Δg). The highest T1 state has been found for 2a, b (approximately 1 eV). Similar values have been previously found at the DFT level of theory in a series of BODIPY and aza-BODIPY systems.29,31

3.3 Spin–orbit coupling constants
High quantum yields of cytotoxic singlet O2 species, fundamental in PDT, can be correlated with the rate constants of the intersystem crossing (radiationless transition Sn→Tm). The ISC efficiency, in the golden rule approximation43 and in the framework of Marcus–Levich–Jortner theory,44 can be expressed as:  where  is the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) integral between the singlet (Sn) and triplet (Tm) pure spin states and FCWD represents the Franck–Condon weighted density of the states. In this case, compounds very similar in structural behaviour will be compared, so it can be reasonable to consider the relative FCWDs approximately of the same magnitude. Anyhow, this term is proportional to an exponential term in which the ΔES–T plays the major role.44 As, from accurate ab initio electronic structure data, it has been established that SOCs and small Sn–Tm energy gaps define the efficiency of ISC processes,43 the computed singlet–triplet energy gap reported in Table 3, combined with SOC values, can be considered as a reliable parameter in evaluating the ISC kinetics.
The spin–orbit matrix elements between the initial Ψ(S1) and final Ψ(T1) wave functions, following the El Sayed rules,45 depend on the nature of the orbitals involved in the transition (internal effect). The presence in the molecular system of a heavy atom can also affect the SOCs in two ways: (i) contributing to changing the orbital nature of the excited states; (ii) varying the SOC with values proportional to the atomic number and inversely proportional to the mean cubic radial distribution (r−3) of the electron (heavy atom effect).
As in all cases two excited triplet states, T1 and T2 originated by H → L and H−3 → L transitions, respectively, have been found to be lying below the energy of the first singlet excited one, S1, SOCs have been computed for S1 with the two triplet states. From Table 4 it emerges that the presence of halogen atoms increases in all cases the SOC amplitude. Comparison between the values obtained for 1c (two iodine atoms in peripheral positions) and 2a (two iodine atoms in the BODIPY core) well evidences as the substitutional position strongly affects both the  and  values. Looking at Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), it appears clear that the inclusion of iodine atoms directly in the BODIPY core entails a change in the orbital composition of the LUMO in the triplet excited states, with respect to 1c bearing halogen atoms in peripheral positions, enhancing the SOC amplitude. The addition of further iodine atoms (compound 2b) does not cause strong variations in the computed SOC values, because of occupying peripheral positions. Finally, the increasing number of iodine atoms in 3 (addition of other two I atoms in the ortho position of the peripheral aryl rings) causes an increase of about 150 cm−1 and a modest decrease of  and , respectively. This is probably due to the similar energy of S1 and T2 states, that in turn enhances the probability of the intersystem crossing.

Nevertheless, for all the derivatives, different intersystem spin crossing pathways for the population of the lowest triplet states have been explored, considering a series of plausible non-radiative decay pathways depending on the excited state electron energies, as depicted in Scheme 2. For 1a–c and 2a, b, for which the absorption generates the S1 state, the population of the lowest triplet excited state can reasonably follow two ways (blue lines in Scheme 2): (a) (b)In the first pathway a direct ISC from S1 to T1 is hypothesized and looking at the  values, it is found that this transition has increasing probability to occur in going from 1a to 2b. The computed energy gaps (Table 3) are between 0.8 and 1.2 eV, the lowest of which has been found for the compounds which contain the iodine atoms directly bound to the BODIPY core, 2a and 2b, and for which substantial SOCs have been calculated, 256.4 and 238.8 cm−1, respectively. Indeed, as previously underlined, the SOC values depend on the nature of orbitals in the two involved states: in 1a–c the nonradiative transition occurs between states with ππ* character, while in 2a, b the T1 states have πn* character, due to the iodine lone-pair contributions. In path (b) an ISC, that occurs between S1 and T2 states, should be followed by a fast T2 → T1 internal conversion. Also in this case the computed SOCs almost increase in the series and the energy gaps are very small (the maximum value is 0.25 eV). The T2 molecular orbital composition results to be ππ* in nature for 1a, b and becomes πn* in the case of 2a, b systems. Due to the SOC, ΔES–T values and the change in orbital composition both channels should be possible, especially for 2a, b molecules, for which significant SOCs have been computed.
 Scheme 2  Representative energy diagram of the excited singlet and triplet states and plausible deactivation pathways, denoted with blue, for 1 and 2, and red arrows for compound 3. 
For compound 3, as the absorption involves the S2 state, three deactivation pathways can be hypothesized (red lines in Scheme 2): (c) (d) (e)In path (c) the intersystem crossing can occur between the populated S2 state and the T2 one that in turn undergoes a fast internal conversion to T1. Assuming that the energy difference between the involved states is rather small (0.32 eV), the relative SOC is found to be considerably smaller than those computed for the coupling with the S1 state. In addition, taking into account Kasha' rule46 that indicates as, in a given spin manifold, the transition Sn → S1 (with n > 1) should be very fast and triplet state population should start from the lowest singlet excited state (S1), this pathway seems to be unlikely to occur.
The other two decay channels (d) and (e) share the first step (a fast IC from S2 to S1) but in the former the T1 population occurs by a direct S1 → T1 ISC, while in the latter by the S1 → T2 one. S1 → T1 intersystem crossing is dominated by a high SOC value (202.5 cm−1) and the ΔE(S1–T1) energy gap assumes a value of 0.77 eV. Channel (e) is characterized by the highest SOC (470.8 cm−1) and a negligible ΔES–T, and therefore it seems to be the most probable one.
For all the considered systems it can be possible to compare the computed SOC values involved in the intersystem crossing between S1 and low lying excited triplet states with the experimental data, that are singlet oxygen (ϕΔ) and sensitizer's triplet (ϕT) quantum yields (Fig. 2).1
 Fig. 2  Computed SOC for S1 → Tm (with m = 1, 2) radiationless transition and measured1 quantum yields of singlet oxygen ϕΔ and triplet excited states ϕT for the investigated systems. 
The experimental and theoretical behaviours are quite similar. In particular, it can be noted that both singlet oxygen (ϕΔ) and triplet (ϕT) quantum yields slightly increase in going from 1a to 1c while a drastic enhancement in 2a, where iodine atoms occupy a position of the BODIPY core, has been found. The addition of extra heavy atoms produces only a modest increase of the singlet oxygen and triplet quantum yields. The reported SOC values approximately show the same trend. In particular for derivatives containing iodine atoms in the core region of the molecule (2a, b and 3), the experimental trend is finely reproduced by the SOCs computed for S1 → T2 radiationless transition.
4. Conclusions
The halogen atom effect on the photophysical properties of a series of recently synthesized aza-BODIPY derivatives has been elucidated by using DFT and TDDFT approaches. In particular, the maximum absorption wavelengths, singlet–triplet energy gaps, spin–orbit matrix elements for the radiationless Sn → Tm, and the preferred channels for the photosensitizer's triplet state population have been determined. The following conclusions can be drawn:
– All the studied systems show a Q band that falls within the so-called therapeutic window;
– The ΔE(S0–T1) gaps are higher than 0.90 eV and, accordingly, all the aza-BODIPY investigated should be able to generate the cytotoxic singlet molecular oxygen;
– The introduction of halogen atoms induces an increase of the spin–orbit matrix elements, which are even more substantial when heavy atoms occupy a position in the core region of the molecular system;
– Following the El-Sayed and Kasha rules, the most probable channel for the triplet state population starts from the S1 state (ππ*) and involves intersystem spin crossing between the states characterized by different orbital compositions, that in both low lying triplet excited states possibly involved is πn*.
Putting together these considerations, all the halogenated aza-BODIPY derivatives studied here could be proposed as candidates to be tested as photosensitizers in type II photodynamic therapy.
