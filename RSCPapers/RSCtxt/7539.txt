    , Accepted 17th November 2014First published on 18th November 2014AbstractA Co3O4 nanorod–multiwalled carbon nanotube hybrid (Co3O4@MWCNT) has been fabricated as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation in alkaline electrolytes. The well-defined Co3O4 nanorods were successfully anchored onto mildly oxidized MWCNTs with the assistance of diethylenetriamine (DETA) following a simple route. The as-prepared hybrid possesses a promising BET specific surface area of about 252 m2 g−1 and shows excellent electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) with an onset potential of about 0.47 V vs. Ag/AgCl and an overpotential of 309 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 mol L−1 KOH. In addition, the Co3O4@MWCNT catalyst exhibits prominent stability during long-term electrolysis of water. We attribute the enhanced performance to a synergic effect between MWCNTs and Co3O4 nanorods by gaining insight into the electrochemical properties of the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid. This work offers a useful way to synthesize one-dimensional (1D) metal oxides combined with 1D carbon materials for wide applications in energy storage and conversion.
1. Introduction
Electrochemical water splitting that produces hydrogen and oxygen is an environmentally benign method to store electricity generated from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.1–6 However, the efficiency of electrochemical water splitting is usually low due to high overpotentials and low currents associated with the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER).7,8 To expedite the kinetics of the OER, efficient electrocatalysts, such as Pt, RuO2,9 and IrO2,10 have been widely used as commercial products. Despite the fact that RuO2 and IrO2 exhibit low OER overpotentials and high current densities, they suffer from high cost and poor long-term stability in alkaline media, which limit their practical applications.11
Recently, novel OER electrocatalysts based on inexpensive and abundant materials such as manganese (Mn),12 nickel (Ni),13 and cobalt (Co)14–16 have been intensively investigated because their electrocatalytical activities towards the OER are comparable to those of noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Among these OER electrocatalysts, spinel cobaltite oxides (such as Co3O4) have attracted a considerable amount of attention as effective anode materials for oxygen evolution in alkaline solution.17–19 However, Co-based catalysts, such as Co3O4, have shown disadvantages including strong causticity in alkaline solution, intrinsic poor electrical conductivity, and undesirable morphology or crystalline structure.18 To circumvent these problems, it is favorable to utilize a suitable substrate to support Co-based catalysts in a rational manner, thereby achieving an enhanced electrocatalytical performance. The required substrates should be preferably conductive, have high specific surface area, and be mechanically stabile in order to stabilize the uniformly dispersed electrocatalyst at the surface and maximize the electrocatalytic activity. As a member of carbon-based nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, large surface area, high mechanical strength, and structural flexibility, thereby offering an ideal scaffold for supporting Co-based electrocatalysts.18–23 Indeed, CNT supported Co-based electro-catalysts have already been used for the OER with improved catalytic activity and stability. For instance, Xie et al.18 reported the Co3O4 nanocrystals on single-walled carbon nanotubes as OER catalysts, focusing on the enhanced durability of the resultant hybrid under neutral conditions. Zhao et al.19 demonstrated that mildly oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) can be used to combine Co3O4 nanoparticles with oxygen-containing groups, while the inner-wall of MWCNTs acts as a highly conducting network.
On the other hand, it is known that the properties of the metal oxides strongly depend on their morphologies and structures, such as crystal sizes, orientations, stacking manners, aspect ratios and even crystalline densities.24–29 Thus, the rational design of morphology and structure of Co3O4 is an effective route to afford high activity for Co3O4 in electrochemical applications. In general, nanorod-shaped materials have a high surface-to-volume ratio36 and mainly expose (110) crystal planes, which are considered as highly activated facets for CO oxidation, methane combustion and ethylene oxidation,25–28 (110) crystal planes with high energies should reduce the oxidation–reduction gaps, and thereby considerably accelerate the reaction rates. As such, we expect that Co3O4 nanorods anchored on CNTs should generate a novel composite with promising OER performance. So far, only nanoparticles18,19,30–32 or other irregular structured33–35 Co3O4 in Co3O4–CNT composites have been reported. Therefore, it is of scientific significance to realize the anchoring of the 1D Co3O4 nanorod on the 1D CNT towards electrochemical water oxidation, while the technique still remains challenging.
Herein, we report the synthesis of nanorod-shaped Co3O4 anchored on MWCNTs with the assistance of diethylenetriamine (DETA) to obtain a novel electrocatalyst with high OER efficiency. The hybrid is prepared by a mild solution-phase synthesis step. DETA is chosen because it acts as a dispersing agent, as well as helps to produce nanorod-shaped Co3O4 and favors the growth of Co3O4 nanorods on MWCNTs. We demonstrate that the resulting Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid shows excellent OER performance and good stability in alkaline solutions due to its fast electron transport properties and highly exposed activated crystal planes of {110}.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
Co(Ac)2·4H2O (97%, Nacalai tesque), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, OD: 20–30 nm, length: 1–2 μm, Beijing Nachen S&T Ltd), sodium carbonate (99.5%, Merck), ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, absolute for analysis, ACS, Merck), and diethylenetriamine (DETA; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Purification and oxidation of MWCNTs
In a typical procedure, 850 mg MWCNTs were initially mixed with concentrated hydrogen nitrate (HNO3) (200 mL, 4 mol L−1) in a 250 mL beaker and ultrasonicated for 1.0 h, followed by putting in a water bath at 80 °C under magnetic stirring for 3.0 h to remove metallic and organic impurities and obtain oxygen-containing groups. Then, the resulting mixture was washed with deionized water several times until pH was 7.0, and then the mildly oxidized MWCNTs were dried at 60 °C.
2.3 Preparation of Co3O4, Co3O4@MWCNT, and Co3O4–MWCNT composites
Typically, 50 mg acid-treated MWCNTs were dispersed in 18.5 mL of ethylene glycol by sonication for 20 minutes, then the mixture was transferred to a three-necked bottle (capacity of 250 mL) and put in a flask heating mantle under refluxing, and then a nitrogen flow was introduced at a constant rate, followed by the addition of 1.5 g Co(Ac)2·4H2O and 30 μL diethylenetriamine (DETA; 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) under magnetic stirring. After stirring for 2 minutes, the system was heated up until the temperature rose to 160 °C. Then, 60 mL of 0.2 M sodium carbonate aqueous solution was added to the solution drop by drop. The precipitate was further aged for 8.5 h and then was centrifuged followed by thorough washing with distilled water and ethanol several times, and then vacuum-drying at 55 °C overnight. Finally, the resulting product was heat-treated at 350 °C for 4.0 hours in an Ar atmosphere. For a control experiment, Co3O4–MWCNT was prepared following the same steps as those used for the preparation of Co3O4@MWCNT without adding DETA. Also, Co3O4 nanorods were prepared following the same steps as those used for the preparation of Co3O4@MWCNT without adding MWCNTs and DETA, referring to a reported process with some modifications.37
2.4 Characterization
The morphology was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, QUANTA FEG 250) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN). The obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV, Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV, 40 mA). Raman spectra were recorded on a RM 2000 microscopic confocal Raman spectrometer (Renishaw in via Plus, England) employing a 514 nm laser beam. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Physical Electronics 5400 ESCA. Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw RM 2000 with a 633 nm laser. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was carried out on a Profile Spec to determine the content of the cobalt element. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements using N2 absorption was performed on an Autosorb-IQ2-MP-C system.
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
1.0 mg of catalyst was dispersed in a mixture of 850 μL alcohol and 15 μL Nafion solution and sonicated to form a homogeneous ink. Then, 10 μL of the dispersion was dropcast onto the surface of a glass carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE, PINE, 5.61 mm diameter), leading to the catalyst loading of ∼0.05 mg cm−2 and a disk area of 0.25 cm2. The as-prepared catalyst decorated RDE working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode constituted a three-electrode electrochemical cell, and the electrochemical measurements were conducted with a CHI 760 Electrochemical Workstation. Electrochemical tests were performed at room temperature.
Linear sweep voltammetry curves were obtained by sweeping the potential from 0.3 to 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl at room temperature at a sweep rate of 1.0 mV s−1, and j (mA cm−2) in this work is normalized by the geometric area of the glassy carbon electrode (0.25 cm2), marked as jgeo. Experiments involving RDE were carried out with the working electrode continuously rotating at 2000 rpm to eliminate the oxygen bubbles. The catalyst was applied for a number of potential sweeps until the data were stable before polarization curves were measured, which were all corrected with 95% IR-compensation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of Co3O4 and Co3O4@MWCNT
The degree of oxidation for MWCNTs is very important for the follow-up synthesis process. The functional groups on the outer-walls of CNTs help to nucleate and anchor the nano-sized electrocatalyst, while the highly electrical conductive inner-walls of CNTs are very important networks for electron transport. Here, we chose mildly oxidized MWCNTs as substrates, such MWCNTs contain functional groups on the outer walls and maintain the inside wall as a conducting network. Scheme 1 shows the synthesis process of the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid. First, the amino group of DETA can effectively interact with MWCNTs via physisorption or electrostatic adsorption. Subsequently, the Co2+ cations were introduced to DETA through a specific interaction and an inductive effect.38 Meanwhile, it is known that the polar weak capping agent tends to adsorb on {110}.29 Thus, polar DETA should tend to adsorb on {110}, thus contributing to the growth of nanorods. Subsequently, with the addition of sodium carbonate, cobalt hydroxide acetate was produced following a gradual intercalation of carbonate anions into the interlayers.37 The Co3O4@MWCNT was finally observed by aging the formed cobalt hydroxide acetate at 160 °C, and then calcination for 4 hours.

Fig. 1 presents the SEM and TEM images of the synthesized Co3O4, Co3O4–MWCNT and Co3O4@MWCNT, displaying the morphology and microstructure of the samples. As shown, the pure Co3O4 sample showed a nanocrystallized structure with a diameter of about 10 nm and a length of 100–200 nm (Fig. 1a and b) which were similar to the results reported previously.37 In comparison, the Co3O4@MWCNT sample showed a clearly different morphology, as shown in Fig. 1c and d, the Co3O4 units maintained a well-defined nanorod shape, closely wrapped on the nanotubes, resulting in a unique 1D plus 1D structure. However, the Co3O4–MWCNT sample, which was synthesized without the addition of DETA, displayed irregular particles mixed with tangled MWCNTs (Fig. 1e and f). Moreover, it can be seen that the Co3O4 nanoparticles tended to aggregate and MWCNTs were not fully covered, which demonstrates that the DETA plays an important role in synthesizing particular shaped-Co3O4@MWCNT, as shown in Scheme 1. The TEM images of Co3O4–MWCNT and Co3O4@MWCNT firmly demonstrated the crucial role of DETA in the structure of the resultant catalysts. The apparent difference in the morphology of the Co3O4@MWCNT and Co3O4–MWCNT should be explained by the fact that DETA either helps to disperse the MWCNTs in the solution or contributes to the growth of Co3O4 nanorods on the MWCNTs. Fig. S1† shows the SEM image of the Co3O4–MWCNT hybrid synthesized with raw MWCNTs. Obviously, it displays a simple mixture of MWCNTs with thin Co3O4 particles. It seems that DETA could physically adsorb onto MWCNTs. However, a close comparison of the SEM results shows a very different morphology for the catalysts prepared with raw MWCNTs and mildly oxidized MWCNTs (Fig. S1† and 1c). The regular structure and well-defined morphology of Co3O4@MWCNT strongly demonstrate that oxidized MWCNTs should benefit from electrostatic interactions between oxygen containing groups on the oxidized MWCNT and DETA, thereby contributing to the uniform growth of Co3O4 on MWCNTs.

In order to further identify the chemical composition and structure of the prepared samples, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was conducted. As shown in Fig. 2a, the XRD spectra of the three samples showed the existence of spinel crystalline structured Co3O4 (PDF: 43-1003). We noted that the XRD spectra of Co3O4, Co3O4–MWCNT and the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid were nearly the same, while the 2θ values of 26° and 43°, assigned to the diffraction peak of MWCNTs, were not clearly observed at Co3O4–MWCNT and Co3O4@MWCNT samples. This phenomenon should be either probably due to a low content of CNTs in the hybrid, or possibly attributed to the blocking effect from the strong peaks of Co3O4. As for Co3O4–MWCNTs, Fig. 1e clearly shows the existence of MWCNTs. To further demonstrate the existence of MWCNTs in the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and Raman spectra are shown in Fig. S2† and 2b, respectively. XPS spectra of Co3O4@MWCNT (Fig. S2†) display intense, Co 2p peaks with binding energies of about 781 eV, which are characteristic of Co3O4 species, while C 1s peaks with binding energies of about 284 eV indicate the presence of carbon from MWCNTs. As shown in the inset an enlarged figure around 780 eV, the XPS peak assigned to Co 2p of pure Co3O4 in the region around 780.2 eV, the shift of the peak for Co 2p of the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid at 781.5 eV and for Co3O4–MWCNT at 781.1 eV can probably be attributed to the interactions between Co3O4 and MWCNTs. These different BE shifting data in XPS spectra for the three samples confirm the successful assembly of Co3O4 nanorods on MWCNTs.18 As shown in Fig. 2b, the Raman spectrum of Co3O4 exhibited three well-defined Raman peaks at 477.1, 507.8 and 671.1 cm−1, which were assigned to the Raman active modes of Co3O4 (i.e., T2g, Eg, and A1g symmetries),39–41 while the MWCNT exhibited three strong peaks at 1345.2, 1580.8 and 2687.6 cm−1, respectively. From the Raman spectra of the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid, the peaks at 478, 515.5 and 673.6, assigned to Co3O4, and the peaks at 1341.8, 1580.8 and 2683.0, corresponding to MWCNTs were clearly observed. We next performed the TGA test to estimate the mass content of MWCNTs in Co3O4@MWCNT, which is ca. 34%.

3.2 Electrochemical properties of Co3O4 and Co3O4@MWCNT
To assess the OER catalytic activity of Co3O4@MWCNT, the sample was investigated by a series of electrochemical experiments. The ohmic potential drop (iR) losses that arise from the solution resistance were all corrected (Fig. S3†). Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) showed that the OER onset potential of the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid was about 474 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M KOH (an overpotential only about 268 mV, vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 14), which was much more positive than that of the Co3O4–MWCNT and pure Co3O4 electrodes, as shown in Fig. 3a. Specifically, the current response of Co3O4 nanorod modified electrodes was lower than that of the Co3O4@MWCNT electrode. Also, the onset potential of the Co3O4 electrode was ∼503 mV, which was about 30 mV higher than that of Co3O4@MWCNT. Similar to the control experiments, the MWCNT electrode and blank RDE electrode showed a negligible current response toward the OER. Meanwhile, to achieve a current density jgeo = 10 mA cm−2, an applied potential of Eapp = 515 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) was required, corresponding to a small overpotential of ca. 310 mV. The excellent performance is comparable to that of reported IrOx and Co3O4 nanoparticles as OER catalysts in alkaline media.14,19,24 Similar LSV measurements were further performed in 0.1 M KOH solution (as shown in Fig. S4†). Again, the Co3O4@MWCNT electrode exhibited the best OER catalytic activities among all the electrodes. The results strongly demonstrate that the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid has excellent OER catalytic activities in alkaline solution in comparison to pure Co3O4 or MWCNT, which was probably contributed to by a synergistic effect between Co3O4 and MWCNT components in the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid.

(b) Tafel plot of Co3O4@MWCNT, Co3O4–MWCNT and Co3O4 derived from (a) . Scan rate = 1 mV s−1. (c) Galvanostatic OER profiles at j = 20 mA cm−2 of the Co3O4@MWCNT composite and Co3O4 in 1 M KOH. (d) Current profiles during 11000 s electrolysis at 0.8 V using the Co3O4@MWCNT composite and Co3O4. Experimental conditions: 1 M KOH, T = 298 K, glassy carbon electrodes of RDE at 2000 rpm. 
To further demonstrate the advantages of the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid, the OER kinetics were analyzed using Tafel plots, as shown in Fig. 3b. All the Tafel plots for Co3O4@MWCNT, Co3O4–MWCNT and Co3O4 electrode displayed a linear dependence of the logarithm of current density in 1.0 M KOH. We found that the Tafel slopes for pure Co3O4 and Co3O4–MWCNT were 62 mV and 65 mV per decade, respectively, while the Co3O4@MWCNT afforded a smaller Tafel slope down to 51 mV dec−1. The observed decrease in the Tafel slope values might be caused by a synergistic coupling effect between Co3O4 and MWCNTs. Moreover, in the absence of DETA, the Co3O4–MWCNT shows irregular Co3O4 particles mixed with tangled MWCNTs, and this insufficient contact between Co3O4 and MWCNTs might weaken the synergistic coupling between Co3O4 and MWCNTs in Co3O4–MWCNT than that of Co3O4@MWCNT, leading to weaker kinetics of Co3O4–MWCNT. We noted that DETA did not introduce “N” functionalities in such hybrid assemblies, which can be proved by the inset of Fig. S2.† The use of DETA is to mainly help to tightly and uniformly anchor Co3O4 nanorods on MWCNTs, thereby enhancing the synergistic coupling between Co3O4 and MWCNTs.
The stability test for the Co3O4@MWCNT composite was carried out by continuously performing the OER on a modified RDE under alkaline conditions. Galvanostatic curves for Co3O4@MWCNT, Co3O4–MWCNT and Co3O4 were recorded for over 9000 s, as shown in Fig. 3c. Only a slight change of the potential for Co3O4@MWCNT was observed, while apparent deviation of the potential for Co3O4–MWCNT and Co3O4 was found, suggesting better alkaline tolerance of Co3O4@MWCNT than that of Co3O4–MWCNT and Co3O4. Moreover, the potential change of Co3O4–MWCNT is less than that of Co3O4@MWCNT, illustrating that the addition of DETA not only helps the successful synthesis of Co3O4@MWCNT, but further improves the stability of Co3O4@MWCNT. To further demonstrate the stability of the Co3O4@MWCNT catalyst, electrolysis of water was carried out over 11000 s in 1 M KOH aqueous solution at 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as shown in Fig. 3d. As seen, the catalytic current density of Co3O4@MWCNT decreased from 79 mA cm−2 to 74 mA cm−2; the degrading value is about 6.3% of the initial value, which was probably caused by partial desorption of the catalyst from the RDE or the degradation of the electrolytes (e.g. pH and conductivity change); the inset of Fig. 3d shows that the value of jgeo decreased about 15.4% during 30000 s (from 79 mA cm−2 to 66 mA cm−2). In comparison, the catalytic current density of Co3O4 showed a decay from 68 mA cm−2 to 55 mA cm−2 during 11000 s; the degrading value is about 19.1% of the initial value. Furthermore, the jgeo of Co3O4 is always lower than that of Co3O4@MWCNT, clearly indicating much poorer stability of the Co3O4 sample. We assumed that the presence of MWCNTs in the Co3O4@MWCNT should help to improve the stability by preventing the strong causticity from the alkaline electrolyte.
Per-metal turnover frequency (TOF) is an important parameter in assessing the OER performance of the catalysts. Based on the obtained data, the TOF can be calculated by measuring the current density for the OER process on the Co3O4@MWCNT electrode. Moreover, inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP) results showed that the mass content of Co is ca. 7.786 mmol g−1. As a result, the TOF of Co3O4@MWCNT was calculated and compared with the results obtained with other cobalt-based catalysts. (Table S1†) We noted that the TOF was estimated by assuming that every Co atom is involved in the catalysis.
We further carried out gas chromatography to identify the product at the Co3O4@MWCNT anode chamber (Fig. S5†). It shows that, along with the continuous electrolysis at 0.8 V at the Co3O4@MWCNT anode, the produced O2 increased, correspondingly. Moreover, we noted that there is no CO or CO2, the possible oxidation products of CNTs, can be detected during the course of 2 h electrolysis of water at 0.6 V (ca. 10 mA cm−2). The above results clearly demonstrate that Co3O4@MWCNT, which was synthesized with the assistance of DETA, is an excellent OER catalyst in terms of catalytical activity and stability, compared to Co3O4 nanorods and MWCNTs. We believed that the mildly oxidized MWCNTs, allowing for the balance of the surface oxidation and structural integrity of the CNTs, can act as suitable substrates for anchoring Co3O4 nanorods, thus attaining high OER activity. We attribute the enhanced OER performance of Co3O4@MWCNT to the following possible reasons.
(1) The observed promising activity should arise from the unique structure and morphology of the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid. We have mentioned that nanorod-shaped Co3O4 is favorable for the OER due to its special crystalline properties. To verify this, high resolution TEM (HRTEM) was used to characterize the morphological and structural properties. Fig. 4a shows the HRTEM images of the Co3O4 nanorod anchored on MWCNTs, displaying a section of Co3O4 nanorods in the [1–10] orientation. It revealed that the naonorods were grown along the [110] direction, which was constructed from {111} planes, with a flat side parallel to [001]. In the [100] orientation, which was constructed from {022} planes with a spacing of 0.286 nm, these (001) side planes were also observed. Taking into account the HRTEM results, a schematic representation was presented to show the crystalline structure of the anchored Co3O4 nanorods on MWCNTs, as shown in Fig. 4b. Therefore, the preferentially exposed crystal planes for the Co3O4 nanorods in the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid, including two side planes and two end planes, can be determined to be {110}. It is known that the {110} planes are composed mainly of Co3+ cations, which are regarded as the most active sites for ethylene oxidation42 and CO oxidation.43 Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that predominant {110} planes that are composed of rich Co3+ species in the Co3O4 nanorods could result in high OER activity.

(d) Schematic illustration of the water oxidation under the synergetic effect of the Co3O4 nanorod and MWCNT of the hybrid. 
(2) Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements show that the BET specific surface areas of Co3O4@MWCNT, Co3O4–MWCNT and Co3O4 are about 252.5 m2 g−1, 219.8 m2 g−1 and 218.4 m2 g−1, respectively. It suggests that the incorporation of the MWCNT helps to increase the surface areas of the resulting hybrid. The impressively large surface area of Co3O4@MWCNT offers a high density of Co3+ active sites available for surface reactions.36
(3) MWCNTs are relatively chemically inert and have been reported to be stable under strong oxidative environments. The results from gas chromatography are evidence that no possible oxidation products of MWCNTs like CO or CO2 could be detected. In addition, the support function of MWCNT substrates enables the OER to occur primarily on Co3O4 surfaces, which can decrease the corrosion of MWCNTs thus improving the stability of the hybrid. As shown in Fig. 3a, the current response in LSVs of MWCNTs almost can be ignored, illustrating that the current response from MWCNT corrosion can be excluded from that of Co3O4@MWCNT.
(4) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is shown in Fig. 4c. The values of Rct can be calculated by fitting of the Nyquist plot. The Rct of Co3O4@MWCNT, Co3O4–MWCNT and Co3O4 are 4.2 Ω, 5.1 Ω, and 6.5 Ω, respectively, illustrating that Co3O4@MWCNT exhibited the smallest charge transfer resistance, indicating that the introduction of the MWCNT apparently improved the efficiency of charges to shuttle between the electrode and KOH solution. We believe that, with the assistance of DETA, Co3O4 nanorods could be closely attached to MWCNTs, offering a facile electron transport route, as well as facilitating electrochemical reactions at the surface. Such a synergetic effect between Co3O4 and MWCNTs is illustrated is Fig. 4d. On one hand, the OER was promoted at the anchored Co3O4 nanaorods possessing a highly activated [110] crystalline surface, on the other hand, the mildly oxidized MWCNTs transfer easily the produced electrons to the outer circuit during the water oxidation.
4. Conclusion
We have successfully synthesized Co3O4 nanorod decorated MWCNTs with the assistance of DETA via a simple strategy. The obtained Co3O4@MWCNT sample reveals a well-defined structure of 1D nanorods winding around a 1D nanotube. In comparison with Co3O4–MWCNT, pure Co3O4 nanorods, MWCNTs and the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid exhibits prominent catalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. Moreover, galvanostatic and chronoamperometric measurements reveal that Co3O4@MWCNT has promising stability in alkaline solution for a long-term test. The HRTEM results demonstrate that the nanorod-shaped Co3O4 in the hybrid is composed of a highly activated [110] crystalline surface, affording improved OER activity for the Co3O4@MWCNT hybrid. Moreover, a synergistic effect between MWCNTs and the anchored Co3O4 nanorods may also help to promote the interfacial electron transfer at surfaces and improve the OER performance. This work can not only essentially provide a facile strategy to prepare a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the OER, but also easily be expanded to prepare other 1D carbon material combined 1D metal oxide nanostructured composites for different applications, such as catalysis, sensors, and energy storage and conversion.
