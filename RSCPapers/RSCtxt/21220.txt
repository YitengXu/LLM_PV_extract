    AbstractNovel p-type and low bandgap penta- and hexa-thiophenes asymmetrically endcapped with solubilizing triarylamine or triarylamino-substituted carbazole dendron and dicyanovinyl groups, namely, PhNOF-OT(n)-DCN and G2-OT(n)-DCN, respectively where n = 5–6 for solution-processable photovoltaic applications have been synthesized and investigated. With the incorporation of a solubilizing electron-donating group, the highly extended oligothiophenes are highly soluble in common organic solvents and solution-processable. Upon extending the oligothiophene backbone, there is a strong increase in the absorption around 420 nm in addition to the intramolecular charge-transfer absorption (520 nm) which results in a strong spectral broadening. The optical band-gap of these donor–acceptor oligothiophene thin-films greatly reduces to 1.85 eV. The solution-processed bulk heterojunction PV cells fabricated from these materials blended with PCBM as an acceptor showed a PCE up to 1.72% with Voc = 0.79 V in an as-fabricated device. Our findings also suggest that highly extended donor–acceptor oligomers can be useful for a p-type, low-bandgap semiconductor for solution-processable bulk heterojunction PV cells.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (PV) cells, which directly convert sunlight into electricity, have drawn considerable attention from both academia and industry because of their promise as low-cost, lightweight, renewable energy sources.1 Heterojunction PV cells based on solution-processable conjugated p-type semiconducting materials blended with a soluble fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) offer advantages of facile and large-area fabrication on flexible substrates by various printing or coating techniques or a roll-to-roll process2 affording high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of greater than 6% recently.3 However, the structural characteristics including molecular weight, polydispersity, and regioregularity as well as the purity of the polymer greatly affect its functional properties, the performance and the stability4 of the resulting devices. In addition to polymers, π-conjugated small molecules have been found attractive as alternative solution-processable p-type donor materials because of monodispersity, ease of obtaining in high purity and reproducible properties. Nevertheless, the use of solution-processable small molecules for PV applications has drawn considerable attention.5 Recently, a PCE of 1.17% was obtained from a solution-processed BHJ solar cell using an anthracene-core donor and C61-PCBM acceptor.6 In addition, a small molecule PV cell based on the blend of a benzothiadiazole derivative and C61-PCBM showed a PCE of 2.4% in the annealed device.7 A high PCE of 3.0% has very recently been demonstrated based on an oligothiophene-diketopyrrolepyrrole and C71-PCBM blend.8 To achieve a high efficiency heterojunction PV cell, it is fundamentally important to develop new p-type π-conjugated small molecules with a narrow energy bandgap to harvest more solar radiation and a high charge carrier mobility to transport the photogenerated charges to the electrodes.9
Oligothiophenes endcapped with triarylamino and dicyanovinyl or tricyanovinyl groups, which exhibit low optical gap absorption and possess a large enough LUMO level offset with the PCBM acceptors for efficient exciton dissociation, have been shown to be useful for a high performance bilayer heterojunction photovoltaic cell.10 Nevertheless, these molecules were not suitable for solution-processable bulk heterojunction PV cells. For application in solution-processable bulk heterojunction PV cells, the materials need to have good solubility and thin-film forming properties.8 To promote the solution-processable properties of small molecule donors, we have developed a novel series of highly extended oligothiophenes asymmetrically endcapped with a solubilizing triarylamine or triarylamino-substituted dendron and a dicyanovinyl group as a p-type, low-optical-gap semi-conductor for solution-processable bulk heterojunction PV cells. The use of a highly extended π-conjugated system not only lowers the optical bandgap and promotes strong π–π stacking of conjugated backbones but also increases the absorption and broadens the absorption spectrum as compared to the lower homologues.
We report herein the synthesis and molecular properties of novel p-type and low bandgap penta- and hexa-thiophenes asymmetrically endcapped with solubilizing triarylamine or triarylamino-substituted carbazole dendron and dicyanovinyl groups, namely, PhNOF-OT(n)-DCN and G2-OT(n)-DCN, respectively where n = 5–6 for solution-processable photovoltaic applications. With the incorporation of a solubilizing electron-donating group, the highly extended oligothiophenes are highly soluble in common organic solvents and solution-processable. The optical band-gap of these donor–acceptor oligothiophene thin-films greatly reduces to 1.85 eV. The solution-processed bulk heterojunction PV cells fabricated from these materials blended with PCBM as acceptors showed a PCE up to 1.72% with Voc = 0.79 V in an as-fabricated device. Our findings also suggest that highly extended donor–acceptor oligomers can be used as a p-type, low-bandgap semiconductor for solution-processable bulk heterojunction PV cells.
Results and discussion
The synthesis of novel triarylamine and dicyanovinyl asymmetrically disubstituted oligothiophenes is outlined in Scheme 1. By adapting the convergent approach used previously,10 the palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling of 7-diphenylamino-9,9-di-n-decylfluorenyl-2-boronic acid 1 and iodobithiophene 2 in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst afforded the desired diphenylaminofluorenyl-substituted bithiophene 3 in 73% yield. Lithiation of 3 at −78 °C followed by quenching with trimethylborate and subsequently acid hydrolysis afforded the corresponding boronic acid 4 in a good yield. The palladium catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling of 7-diphenylamino-9,9-di-n-decylfluorenyl-5′-bithiophene-5-boronic acid 4 with iodoter- or iodoquater-thiophenecarboxaldehyde 5a or 5b afforded the desired diphenylaminofluorenyl-substituted penta- and hexa-thiophenecarboxaldehydes, 6a and 6b, respectively in good yields (78–80%). Condensation of these aldehydes 6a or 6b, with malononitrile in the presence of pyridine in refluxing chloroform afforded the desired donor–acceptor oligothiophenes PhNOF-OT(n)-DCN, n = 5 or 6 in excellent yields. Furthermore, the synthesis of novel triarylamine-substituted carbazole dendron and dicyanovinyl asymmetrically disubstituted oligothiophenes is outlined in Scheme 2. 5-{3,6-Bis[4-(diphenylamino)-1-phenyl]carbazol-9-yl}-2-bithiophene-boronic acid, 7 was prepared according to the previously published protocol.5f The palladium catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling of boronic acid 7 with iodoter- or iodoquater-thiophenecarboxaldehyde 5a or 5b afforded the desired triarylamine-substituted dendritic penta- and hexa-thiophenecarboxaldehydes, 8a and 8b, respectively in good yields (80–83%). Similarly, subsequent condensation of 8a or 8b with malononitrile afforded the triarylamine-substituted carbazole dendron and dicyanovinyl asymmetrically disubstituted oligothiophenes G2-OT(n)-DCN, n = 5 or 6 in 89–91% yields. All the newly synthesized donor–acceptor oligothiophenes were fully characterized with 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MALDI-TOF MS, and elemental analysis and found to be in good agreement with their structures.

The thermal behaviour and stability of these donor–acceptor oligothiophenes were investigated by DSC and TGA analyses, respectively. The results are summarized in Table 1. The triarylamine-substituted oligothiophenes, PhNOF-OT(n)-DCN exhibit no apparent glass transition except a melting transition (Tm) in the range of 199–217 °C; on the other hand, the dendron-substituted oligothiophenes, G2-OT(n)-DCN show distinct and high glass transition temperatures with Tg > 144 °C suggesting that these dendrimers can form morphologically stable amorphous thin films. All the oligothiophenes exhibit an excellent thermal stability with Td in the range of 440–515 °C. (Fig. 1)

The absorption spectra of these donor–acceptor oligothiophenes measured in chloroform and DMSO as shown in Fig. 2 are composed of three broad and structureless absorption bands, a weak to strong absorption in the range of 310–330 nm corresponding to the n → π* transition of the arylamine moiety of the triarylamine-based donating group, a moderate to strong absorption around 410–420 nm corresponding to the transition of the extended oligothiophene core, and the long wavelength absorption (λabsmax) around 520 nm corresponding to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transition. The λabsmax remains fairly constant for PhNOF-OT(n)-DCNs and shifts slightly to a longer wavelength for G2-OT(n)-DCNs when the oligothienyl core extends from five to six indicating the approach of the effective conjugation length for the series. It is worth mentioning that in addition to ICT, the enhancement of the absorption around 420 nm upon extending the oligothiophene backbone gives rise to a strong spectral broadening. These oligomers also exhibit an inverted solvatochromic effect upon an increase in polarity of solvent. There is no observable fluorescence emission upon irradiating at λabsmax which is attributed to the strong charge-transfer character of these donor–acceptor oligothiophenes. These oligomers showed pronounced peak broadening and red shifts of ∼40 nm of absorption cutoff upon formation into thin films which is attributed to the planarization of aryl rings and the presence of interchain interactions in the solid state, resulting in the optical band gap reducing to 1.85 eV.

Both PhNOF-OT(n)-DCNs and G2-OT(n)-DCNs exhibit very similar electrochemical redox behavior. All the oligothiophenes showed three oxidation waves with Eoxd1 at 0.30–0.35 V, Eoxd2 at 0.39–0.48 V, and Eoxd3 at 0.73–0.86 V (E1/2 (Fc/Fc+) = 0.49 V vs. SCE) corresponding to the sequential removal of electrons from the arylamino group(s), the oligothiophene core or the interior carbazole moieties, and the oligothiophene core, respectively. (Fig. 3) They also exhibit two reduction waves (Ered1 = −1.50 V and Ered2 = −2.00 V vs. Fc/Fc+) corresponding to the reductions of dicyanovinyl group and the reduction of oligothiophene core, respectively. Hence, the HOMO and LUMO levels of these oligothiophenes were estimated to be ∼−5.2 eV and ∼−3.3 eV, respectively based on CV data.

The potential of these highly extended oligothiophenes as hole-transporting light-absorbing materials in solution-processable photovoltaic cells was explored. The bulk heterojunction PV cells with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/oligomer:PCBM/LiF (1 nm)/Al (120 nm) were fabricated by the spin-casting of a PEDOT-PSS layer and then a blend of oligomer:PCBM layer followed by vacuum deposition of LiF and Al as the cathode. The PV responses of these devices were measured under AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The results of the device performance are summarized in Table 2. Most of the devices have relatively large Voc (∼ 0.8 V) because of the low-lying HOMO levels of these oligothiophenes (∼ −5.2 eV) resulting in larger differences to the LUMO level of PCBM. The devices with a thicker active layer have better PCEs and fill factors. By increasing the film thickness from 100 nm to 160 nm, devices fabricated with 1:2 G2-OT(6)-DCN:PCBM ratios exhibit a significant increase in Jsc and PCE up to 1.12% with Voc of 0.79 V (Fig. 4). It is known that the carrier mobility of a blended film is greatly influenced by the donor:acceptor ratio. G2-OT(6)-DCN:PCBM-based devices with a ratio of 1:4 exhibit decreases in Jsc, Voc and thus, PCE. In sharp contrast, devices fabricated with 1:4 PhNOF-OT(5)-DCN:PCBM ratios exhibit dramatic enhancement in Jsc (to 5.41 mA cm−2) and FF (= 0.40) with a PCE up to 1.72% (Fig. 5). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements show that the PhNOF-OT(5)-DCN-based device exhibits a very broad photoresponse range from 300 nm to 680 nm which corresponds well to the UV-vis absorption spectra of the films and the maximum EQE reaches 43% at 424 nm. Our findings highlight the potential of this class of materials for further device optimization in high performance PV applications.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel series of solution-processable, p-type, low-optical-gap semiconductors based on penta- and hexa-thiophenes asymmetrically endcapped with a triarylamine or triarylamino-substituted dendron and dicyanovinyl groups has been synthesized. A highly extended oligothiophene backbone results in strong spectra broadening which is advantageous to light harvesting. The PhNOF-OT(5)-DCN:PCBM-based device exhibits a high PCE of 1.72% with Voc = 0.79 V and EQEmax = 43%. Our findings also suggest that highly extended donor–acceptor oligomers can be useful as a p-type, low bandgap semiconductor for solution-processable bulk heterojunction PV cells. Further device optimization to enhance the efficiency of these oligomer-based PV cells is still in progress.
Experimental
General procedures and requirements
All the solvents were dried by the standard methods wherever needed. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker-400 NMR spectrometer and referenced to the residual CHCl3 7.26 ppm. 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker-400 NMR spectrometer and referenced to the CDCl3 77 ppm. Mass spectroscopy (MS) measurements were carried using fast atom bombardment on the API ASTER Pulser I Hybrid Mass Spectrometer or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) technique. Elemental Analysis was carried out on a CARLO ERBA 1106 Elemental Analyzer. Thermal stabilities were determined using a thermal gravimetric analyzer (PE-TGA6) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. The glass transition and melting transition were extracted from the second run DSC traces which were determined by differential scanning calorimeter (PE PYRIS Diamond DSC) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. All absorption measurements were performed with a Varian Cary 100-UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The half-wave potential (E1/2) or peak potential (Ep) vs. FC+/FC were estimated by a cyclic voltammetric method (Voltammetric Analyzer CV-50W) using a platinum disc electrode as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and SCE as the reference electrode with an agar bridge connecting to the oligomer solution dissolved in CH2Cl2 using 0.1 M of Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and all the potentials were calibrated with ferrocene as an external standard.
OPV device fabrication and testing
ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω/□) were patterned by a conventional wet-etching process using an acid mixture of HCl (6 N) and HNO3 (0.6 N) as the etchant. The active area of each solar cell was 5 × 7 mm2. After patterning, the substrates were rinsed in deionized water, and then ultrasonicated sequentially in acetone (20 °C) and 2-propanol (65 °C). Immediately before device fabrication, the ITO substrate was treated in a UV-ozone oven for 15 min. Subsequently, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) thin film (50 nm) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm from its aqueous solution onto the treated substrate, and then baked at 140 °C under nitrogen for 30 min. The active layer composed of the blend of oligomer and PCBM at various ratios was then spin-coated on top of PEDOT-PSS from chlorobenzene solutions for 60 s. The thickness of the resulting film was measured with a Dektak III surface profilometer. The device fabrication was completed by the vacuum deposition of LiF (1 nm) and Al cathode (120 nm). The solar cells with no protective encapsulation were subsequently tested in air under air mass (AM) 1.5 simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2, Sciencetech, Model SF150). Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter.

To a dry 100 mL two-neck flask containing 2.0 g (2.57 mmol) of 3 and 30 mL of dry THF was dropwise added 2.4 mL (3.9 mmol) of 1.6 M of n-butyl lithium under N2 at −78 °C while maintaining a good stirring. After stirring for 1 h, trimethyl borate (0.45 mL, 4.0 mmol) was added in one portion. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 1 h at −78 °C. When the mixture was naturally warmed to −30 °C, water and HCl (3 M) were added. Then the solution mixture was poured into water and extracted with EA (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to dryness at 35 °C. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography using DCM and PE–EA as eluent affording the desired product, 5-[9,9-bis(n-decyl)-2-diphenylamino-7-fluorenyl]-2-bithiopheneboronic acid (4) as a green solid (1.58 g, 75%). The product was directly used in the next coupling reaction without further purification. To a 100 mL round bottom flask was added 300 mg (0.36 mmol) of boronic acid 4, 100 mg (0.25 mmol) of aldehyde (5a), 50 mg of Pd(PPh3)4, 2 mL of 2 M K2CO3 and 20 mL of THF. The mixture was heated to 80 °C and stirred overnight under N2. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into water and extracted with DCM (3 × 20 mL).
