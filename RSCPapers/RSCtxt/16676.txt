    , Accepted 28th April 2022First published on 29th April 2022AbstractFirst-principles calculations were employed to evaluate the doping effects on the activity and selectivity of various single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts for the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR). A series of SAA catalysts are formed by the introduction of different single transition metal (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, W, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au) atoms into a defective Re(111) surface. Our periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the Mn/Re(111) SAA has the ability to spontaneously adsorb N2 molecules rather than H atoms, and thus it can effectively improve the selectivity of the eNRR and inhibit that of the HER. Electronic structure analysis shows that hydrogenation of *N2 to *NNH on the surface of the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst results in the formation of a *N2−˙ radical via the charge transfer from the H atom to the adsorbed N2 molecule. Due to the very high reactivity of the *N2−˙ radical, the calculated free energy changes of the subsequent hydrogenation processes along the favorable distal pathway are close to 0 eV or even negative on the surface of the Mn/Re(111) SAA. All these results indicate that the Mn/Re(111) SAA may be an excellent catalyst with high activity and selectivity for the eNRR.
Introduction
The Haber–Bosch process, which is the first economically feasible method for directly synthesizing ammonia (NH3) from dihydrogen (H2) and atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) on the surface of an iron-based catalyst, is still dominant in the field of artificial nitrogen fixation currently. Because of its harsh reaction conditions (∼500 °C and >100 atm), the Haber–Bosch method consumes a large amount of energy and releases a lot of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually.1–3 Therefore, it is important to find an energy-saving and environmentally friendly nitrogen fixation technology to replace the Haber–Bosch method. Because the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) can be performed at ambient temperature and pressure, and electrical energy can be converted from green energy sources such as solar and wind power, the eNRR is an emerging environmentally friendly method of nitrogen fixation that uses readily available H2O and N2 as reactants to generate NH3 under ambient reaction conditions. To date, the eNRR is considered as an alternative sustainable technology for ammonia synthesis.4–8
Transition metals (TMs) with both empty and filled d orbitals have long been considered as catalysts for the reduction of N2 to NH3 because they have the potential to activate the N–N bond of inert N2. Many TMs have been demonstrated to be effective for the eNRR.9–12 However, the pure metal surfaces of eNRR catalysts have some significant disadvantages. For example, the selectivity of the pure metal catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is higher than that of the eNRR, resulting in low reaction efficiency for the eNRR.13–15 Although various strategies have been proposed to improve the selectivity of the eNRR, the very strong interaction between TM and hydrogen (H) atoms and high energy barrier for the potential determining steps (PDS) of *N2 + H+ + e− → *NNH and *NH + H+ + e− → *NH2 in the eNRR are bottleneck problems for the development of transition-metal-based catalysts.13,16–19
Single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts are designed by doping a different TM atom to replace an atom on the pure metal surface. SAA catalysts have 100% metal dispersion and maximum atomic utilization, well-defined active centers, clear coordination, and unique electronic structures.20–22 Compared to a series of active sites exposed on the pure metal surfaces, the introduction of different TMs could change the activity and selectivity of SAA catalysts via a combination of ligand and ensemble effects. The ligand effect refers to the change in the electronic structure of SAA catalysts due to the doping of different metal atoms to form an alloy, while the ensemble effect refers to the change in the number of atoms as active sites before and after the doping of metal atoms to form an alloy.23
SAA catalysts consist mainly of TM atoms anchored to kinks, terraces, step edges, or metal surfaces containing atomic defects.24 The strength of the metal–metal bonds in SAA catalysts ensures their superior stability relative to oxide-supported or carbon-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs).25–28 In addition, the metal–support interaction of SAA catalysts could tune the electronic structure of SAA catalysts effectively. Various efficient SAA catalysts could be rationally designed to improve the activity and selectivity of specific reactions by tuning the metal–support interaction, and have been widely used in the field of electrocatalysis currently,29–40 as well as the eNRR. Zheng and co-workers reported a high throughput screening of Au-based SAA catalysts with N2 reduction activity based on DFT calculations.41 The alloying strategy by separately doping different single transition metal atoms on the pure metal Au(111) surface effectively improves the intensity of N2 adsorption and thus reduces the free energy barrier in the first hydrogenation step. Three descriptors are proposed to describe ΔG(*N2 → *NNH): ΔG(*NNH), d-band center, and electronegativity. Mo, W, Ru and Ta/Au(111) were found to be promising electrocatalysts for the eNRR. Kour and co-workers reported 19 different transition metal-doped Ru-based SAA catalysts.42 All of these materials showed excellent thermodynamic stability, selectivity, and catalytic activity during the eNRR. The V-doped Ru(0001) SAA could reduce N2 to NH3 by the consecutive mechanism. The alloying of Ru with transition metals helps to adjust the binding energy of N2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface, thus improving its catalytic activity.
In this paper, we designed 17 SAA catalysts by the introduction of a series of TM atoms into the defect site of the Re(111) surface (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, W, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au), and their potential catalytic performances for the eNRR were well investigated by using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and various wavefunction analysis methods. We found that the surface of the Mn/Re(111) SAA can spontaneously adsorb N2 molecules, but not H atoms. Such results indicate that the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst can effectively improve the selectivity of the eNRR and inhibit that of the HER, simultaneously. The free energy calculations show that along the favorable distal mechanism pathway N2 can be reduced to NH3 on the surface of the Mn/Re(111) SAA with a relatively low free energy barrier.
Computational details
All the calculations were based on density functional theory as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).43,44 The projector augmented wave (PAW) method45 was adopted to describe the ion–electron interactions. The generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function46,47 was used, and a cut-off energy of 500 eV was set for the plane-wave basis. A Re(111) surface containing a 2 × 2 × 3 atom slab was used as the substrate with a 15 Å vacuum space and the Brillouin zone was sampled with Monkhorst–Pack 3 × 3 × 1 and 7 × 7 × 1 k-point grids for geometry and electronic structure calculations, respectively. In the case of structural optimization of all surfaces, the upper two layers and the adsorbates were relaxed, while the atoms in the bottom layer were fixed. The energy and force convergence thresholds for the iteration in the self-consistent field (SCF) were set to 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively.
The adsorption energies (Eads) of the eNRR intermediates were obtained by the following equation: Eads = Etotal − ESAA catalyst − Eadsorbate(1)
In the above equation, Etotal, ESAA catalysts, and Eadsorbate represent the total energies of the species-adsorbed SAA catalyst system, clean SAA catalysts, and the adsorbate, respectively. According to this definition, the more negative adsorption energy indicates its stronger adsorption.
The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) for each reaction step was calculated using the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model proposed by Nørskov and co-workers,48 which uses one-half of the chemical potential of hydrogen as the chemical potential of the proton–electron pairs. The ΔG was obtained by the following equation: ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + ΔGpH + eU(2)In the above equation, ΔE is the reaction energy obtained directly from the DFT calculation. ΔEZPE and TΔS are the contributions of the zero-point energy and entropy for the ΔG, which are calculated using the VASPKIT49 through the frequency analysis. T represents the temperature, which is set at 298.15 K. The parameters e and U represent the number of electrons and the applied electrode potential, respectively. ΔGpH is the free energy correction of pH, which can be calculated by ΔGpH = kBT × pH × ln10. Notably, the pH value was set to zero in this work.
In this work, the limiting potential (UL) value was used as a descriptor of catalytic activity, which was determined by the PDS among six proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. UL was obtained by the following equation: (3)where ΔGmax represents the ΔG of the PDS.
Results and discussion
Stability
Nørskov and co-workers have proved that the Re(111) surface exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the eNRR among most pure metal (111) surfaces.13 In this study, 17 different TM atoms were introduced into a defect of the Re(111) surface to form different SAA catalysts (Fig. 1a). The structure diagram of the TM/Re(111) SAA catalysts is shown in Fig. 1b the doping of the TM atoms into a defect of the Re(111) surface results in a hexa-coordination sphere surrounded by Re atoms. Due to their analogous metallic radii, no significant structural deformation occurs for the TM/Re(111) SAA catalysts (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, W, Os, and Ir).
 Fig. 1  (a) TM atoms were anchored to the defective Re(111) surface to form a variety of SAA catalysts, and (b) the structural formula of the SAA catalysts. 
To evaluate the experimental feasibility for the synthesis of TM/Re(111) SAA catalysts, we calculated the binding energy (Eb) of TM atoms and the Re(111) surface. In addition, we also compared the difference between the Eb and metal cohesion energy (Ec) to assess the possibility of aggregation and diffusion of TM atoms anchored to the Re(111) surface. Eb and Ec are calculated by the following equations: Eb = ETM/Re(111) − ETMsingle − EDefectiveRe(111)(4) Ec = ETMbulk/n − ETMsingle(5)where ETM/Re(111), EDefectiveRe(111), ETMbulk, ETMsingle, and n indicate the energy of SAA catalysts, the energy of the Re(111) surface with an atomic defect, the energy of the bulk crystal cell of the corresponding TM, the energy of a single TM atom in a vacuum and the number of atoms in the cell, respectively. If Eb < 0, this means that the TM atoms tend to anchor to the Re(111) surface. If Eb − Ec < 0, this means that the binding of TM atoms to the Re(111) surface is thermodynamically favorable relative to the aggregation of TM atoms. The calculated Eb and Eb − Ec values are shown in Fig. 1a. It can be seen that the TM atoms on the defective Re(111) surface all have large binding energies. In addition, for all TM atoms, their Eb − Ec values are negative, which means that TM atoms have strong interactions with the defective Re(111) surface, making TM atoms tend to bind to the Re(111) surface rather than undergo aggregation to form clusters, and all SAA catalysts have good experimental feasibility thermodynamically. In addition, the experimental feasibility can be assessed by calculating the formation energy of the SAA and comparing it with the experimental results.50
For transition metal elements located in the same period of the periodic table, the electronegativity of the transition metals becomes stronger from left to right. Therefore, when a single transition metal has a weaker electronegativity than Re, electrons tend to transfer from the d orbital of the single transition metal atom to the d orbital of Re, which leads to the TM/Re(111) surface undergoing electron rearrangement via such an electron transfer process. Accordingly, when a transition metal has a stronger electronegativity than Re, electrons tend to transfer from the less electronegative Re to the d orbital of the single transition metal, which also leads to the rearrangement of electrons on the TM/Re(111) surface. To reveal the nature of the interaction of different TM atoms with the defective Re(111) surface support, we analyzed the Bader charge transfer between the TM atoms and the support (Table S2†). Interestingly, in the 17 SAA catalysts, the calculated Bader charge transfer values for the doped Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Tc, and Fe atoms in the SAA catalysts are −0.62, −0.47, −0.45, −0.29, −0.06, and −0.25 e−, respectively (see Fig. 2a). This means that in these six SAA catalysts, they tend to undergo charge transfer from the TM atom to the support when the TM atom is anchored to the defective Re(111) surface. In contrast, the TM atoms on the right side of the Re element in the elemental table tend to undergo charge transfer from the support to the TM atoms when they are anchored to the defective Re(111) surface. The calculated Bader charge transfer values for the doped Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au atoms in the SAA catalysts are 0.04, 0.10, 0.03, 0.23, 0.40, 0.38, 0.19, 0.41, 0.65, 0.70, and 0.56 e−, respectively. Such results are in good agreement with the prediction by using simple electronegativity.
 Fig. 2  (a) Bader charge transfer between Mn and the defective Re(111) surface. The positive value represents that the atom obtains Bader charge. (b) The charge density difference of the Mn/Re SAA. Red and green isosurfaces represent charge accumulation and depletion in the space. The isosurface value was set to 0.005 e Å−3. 
We employed the Mn/Re(111) SAA as an example to analyze the details about the charge transfer between the doped TM atom and Re(111) support. The charge density difference of the Mn/Re(111) SAA is shown in Fig. 2b. It can be found that the charge transfer between Mn and the support mainly occurs on the Mn atom and the nine Re atoms adjacent to the Mn center (six Re atoms in the top layer and three Re atoms in the subsurface layer). Charge depletion occurs mainly on the Mn atom and charge accumulation occurs mainly on the Mn–Re bond. This is consistent with the Bader charge analysis. The charge transfer between the single TM atom and the Re support indicates a strong metal–support interaction, which makes the single Mn atom stably anchored to the defective Re(111) surface.
Adsorption
During the whole eNRR process, the first key step is the adsorption and activation of the inert N2. And we have considered two kinds of N2 adsorption configurations for all the SAA catalysts studied here, end-on and side-on configurations, respectively (see Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  The adsorption configurations of N2 on the TM/Re(111) SAA in an end-on configuration and a side-on configuration, respectively. The cyan, purple, and blue colors indicate Re, TM, and N atoms, respectively. 
The calculated adsorption energies and Gibbs free energies of N2 adsorption on the different TM/Re(111) SAA catalysts studied here via both configurations are listed in Table S3.† And the calculated adsorption energies for the most stable adsorption configurations are compared in Fig. 1a. It can be found that the calculated adsorption energies of N2 on the surface of these SAA catalysts range from +0.55 to −0.80 eV, and the calculated Gibbs free energy changes for this adsorption behavior range from +1.07 to −0.23 eV. Moreover, the end-on configuration is more favorable in energy than the side-on configuration for all the SAA catalysts studied here.
As shown in Fig. 1a, the absolute value of adsorption energy for the end-on configuration decreases in the following order: Mn/Re(111) (−0.80 eV) > W/Re(111) (−0.62 eV) > Co/Re(111) (−0.59 eV) > Cr/Re(111) (−0.59 eV) > Tc/Re(111) (−0.58 eV) > pure Re(111) surface (−0.58 eV) > Mo/Re(111) (−0.58 eV) > Ru/Re(111) (−0.56 eV) > Os/Re(111) (−0.53 eV) > Rh/Re(111) (−0.45 eV) > Ir/Re(111) (−0.41 eV) > Fe/Re(111) (−0.33 eV) > Ni/Re(111) (−0.25 eV) > Au/Re(111) (−0.01 eV) > Ag/Re(111) (−0.01 eV) > Cu/Re(111) (0.00 eV) > Pd/Re(111) (+0.05 eV) > Pt/Re(111) (+0.09 eV). For the three TM/Re(111) SAA catalysts (TM = Au, Ag, and Cu), the distance of the TM and N2 is calculated to be 4.140, 3.780 and 3.947 Å in the most stable adsorption species of N2, respectively, which means that N2 interacts with these three catalysts through very weak physisorption. And the physisorption would lead to a more difficult hydrogenation reduction reaction of N2, therefore, we believe that these three SAA catalysts do not have high activity for the eNRR. By contrast, the five SAA catalysts formed by doping the defective Re(111) surface with Mn, W, Co, Cr, and Tc, respectively, lead to strong N2 adsorption compared to the pure metal Re(111) surface.
Tuczek and co-workers proposed that the atomic charge and N–N bond length of the adsorbed N2 molecule are key factors in determining the reactivity of N2 with the proton in the eNRR.51 In the present paper, the optimized N–N bond length is plotted against the calculated Bader charge of the N2 moiety, which is shown in Fig. 3. A linear relationship (R2 = 0.94) indicates that a significant correlation effects between the Bader charge of N2 moiety and N–N bond distance, where the longer N–N distance results in the more positive Bader charge on the N2 moiety.
 Fig. 3  Relationship between the Bader charge and N–N bond length of the adsorbed N2 molecule. 
Thus, the Bader charge on the N2 moiety and the N–N bond distance were both effective predictors for the activation of N2 for our studied systems. On the other hand, the calculated Bader charge of the two N atoms in the N2 moiety is not equivalent. The calculated Bader charge on the bridging N atom is larger than that of the terminal N atom. Obviously, such results indicate that the terminal N atom exhibits a poor basicity relative to the bridging N atom, and thus a low reactivity of the terminal N atom and proton.
According to the Sabatier principle, excellent catalysts should have the capability to bind atoms and molecules with moderate strength.52 This implies that the adsorption strength of catalysts should neither be too weak so that they can activate the reactants, nor too strong so that the products can be desorbed. Thus, there is an optimum adsorption strength for every target catalytic reaction. Unfortunately, how to carry out the Sabatier principle to screen the eligible catalyst for a single catalytic reaction is still a great challenge currently. Because N2 is very chemically inert, the adsorption strength of N2 on most catalysts is almost weak. Thus, the strong adsorption behavior of N2 on the catalyst surface is a prerequisite in the determination of an excellent catalyst for most eNRR. Thus, the five SAA catalysts (TM/Re(111), TM = Mn, W, Co, Cr, and Tc) with considerable adsorption energy relative to the pure Re(111) surface may be the robust catalysts for the eNRR according to their adsorption behavior of the N2 molecule.
In particular for the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst, our DFT calculations show that the Mn/Re(111) SAA exhibits the largest adsorption energy and adsorption free energy of −0.80 and −0.23 eV among all the SAA catalysts studied here. The optimized structural parameters of the end-on adsorption configuration of N2 on the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst show that N2 is adsorbed on the top site of the Mn atom in the end-on configuration. And the optimized distance of Mn–N and N–N is 1.914 and 1.130 Å, indicating a strong Mn–N bonding interaction and an elongated N–N bond, respectively. Meanwhile, the Mn atom protrudes 0.122 Å from the defective Re(111) surface when compared with a clean Mn/Re(111) surface. The large Bader charge transfer value, elongation of the N–N bond, and considerable adsorption free energy indicate that the N2 molecule was effectively activated by the Mn/Re(111) surface.
Activity
After N2 is adsorbed on the catalysts in the end-on configuration, *N2 could be reduced to *NH3via either a distal or alternating mechanism through six PCET processes (see Scheme 2).53,54 For the distal mechanism, the terminal N atom, which is more distant from the support and active site, will be hydrogenated firstly until the first NH3 is produced and then released. In the distal mechanism, the six intermediates are *NNH, *NNH2, *N, *NH, *NH2, and *NH3, respectively. For the alternating mechanism, the two N atoms will be alternately hydrogenated. In the alternating mechanism, the six intermediates are *NNH, *NHNH, *NHNH2, *NH2NH2, *NH2, and *NH3, respectively.
 Scheme 2  The distal and alternating mechanisms for the reduction of N2 to NH3. The blue and red solid arrows represent the distal and alternating mechanisms, respectively. 
For the reduction of N2 to NH3via a distal or alternating mechanism, the PDS is usually the first PCET process, i.e., *N2 → *NNH according to previous studies both theoretically and experimentally.55,56 To evaluate the ability to convert N2 to NH3, we first calculated the Gibbs free energy change for the first PCET process during the conversion of N2 to NH3 for all the SAA catalysts studied here. Fig. 4a summarizes the free energy changes for the first PCET process in the eNRR on all the SAA catalysts studied here. Here, the SAA catalysts with the free energy change of the first PCET process below 1.00 eV were considered as candidates for robust catalysts in the eNRR. As shown in Fig. 4a, there are seven SAA catalysts that may be eligible catalysts for the eNRR, in which the calculated free energy changes for the first PCET process of these seven SAA catalysts are +0.91, +0.91, +0.87, +0.85, +1.00, +0.90, and +0.86 eV for Cr/Re(111), Mn/Re(111), Fe/Re(111), Tc/Re(111), Ru/Re(111), W/Re(111), and Os/Re(111), respectively.
 Fig. 4  (a) Free energy changes of the first PCET process and (b) desorption of the second NH3 molecule on all the SAA catalysts studied here. 
On the other hand, the N2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface will form two NH3 molecules after the six PCET processes. It is worth mentioning that the desorption of the second NH3 is always thermodynamically unfavorable for most reported catalysts because the NH3 molecule with lone pair electrons has the potential to coordinate to TM atoms with unoccupied d orbitals.57 In the present paper, the desorption energies of the second NH3 molecule on all the SAA catalysts studied here have been calculated and are compared in Fig. 4b. Although the calculated free energy changes for the desorption of the second NH3 are negative for the TM/Re(111) (TM = Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au) SAA catalysts, they cannot be viewed as eligible catalysts for the eNRR owing to their very weak adsorption behavior of the N2 molecule. By contrast, the calculated free energy changes for the desorption of the second NH3 from the seven SAA catalysts TM/Re(111) (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Tc, Ru, W, and Os) decrease in the following order: W/Re(111) (+0.54 eV) > Cr/Re(111) (+0.32 eV) > Tc/Re(111) (+0.30 eV) > Os/Re(111) (+0.23 eV) > Ru/Re(111) (+0.22 eV) > Mn/Re(111) (+0.15 eV) > Fe/Re(111) (+0.04 eV). This means that the desorption of the second NH3 on the Mn/Re(111) and Fe/Re(111) surfaces may be an easy process because of the small thermodynamic barrier relative to the other SAA catalysts studied here. However, there is a very high thermodynamic barrier for the desorption of the second NH3 molecule from the W/Re(111) surface. This implied that the presence of trace NH3 may lead to catalyst poisoning and deactivation of the W/Re(111) SAA, even *NH3 species can be released in the form of NH4+ by further protonation in strongly acidic solutions.58,59
To further evaluate the whole catalytic process, the Gibbs free energy changes of the reduction of N2 to NH3 through distal and alternating mechanisms catalyzed by these six SAA catalysts have been calculated and are shown in Fig. 5. Here, the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst has been employed as an example to analyze the details of the eNRR. In both distal and alternating mechanisms, the first hydrogenation step of *N2 is *N2 + H+ + e− → *NNH (see Scheme 2). Our DFT calculations show that the formation of *NNH requires a free energy change of +0.91 eV. In the distal mechanism, the calculated free energy change of the second hydrogenation process is close to 0 eV (+0.05 eV), implying that this step is roughly thermoneutral. And the subsequent hydrogenation processes are found to be all thermodynamic downhill, where the calculated free energy changes are −0.54, −0.35, −0.18, and −0.53 eV, corresponding to the formation of *N, *NH *NH2, and *NH3, respectively. Among them, the third and sixth steps are calculated to be strongly exoergic steps, which are in good agreement with the theoretical results on most of the TM catalysts for the eNRR in the steps of releasing the first NH3 molecule via cleavage of the N–N bond and the second NH3 molecule via hydrogenation of *NH2.
 Fig. 5  Free energy changes of N2 reduction to NH3 catalyzed by Mn/Re(111), Cr/Re(111), Fe/Re(111), Tc/Re(111), Ru/Re(111), and Os/Re(111), respectively. The blue and red solid lines represent the intermediates of the distal and alternating mechanisms, respectively. 
In the alternating mechanism, the calculated free energy changes for the subsequent hydrogenation processes are +0.50, −0.09, +0.03, −1.46, and −0.53 eV, corresponding to the formation of *NHNH, *NHNH2, *NH2NH2, *NH2 and *NH3, respectively. The third step is found to be thermoneutral for the formation of *NHNH2. And a significant thermodynamic downhill is found to be the formation of the first NH3 molecule via cleavage of the N–N bond in the fifth step. And the formation of the second NH3 molecule is also calculated to be a strongly exoergic step of −0.53 eV. All these results indicate that the UL of the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst is 0.91 V in both the distal and alternating mechanisms, corresponding to the first PCET process, *N2 + H+ + e− → *NNH. And the distal mechanism is more favorable in energy than the alternating mechanism.
By the same log, we found that in the six SAA catalysts studied here, the PDS is the first PCET process in both the distal and alternating mechanisms, and the distal pathway is a favorable mechanism. As shown in Fig. 5, the calculated free energy change of the PDS along the favorable distal pathway is in the range from +0.85 to +1.00 eV. Such results indicate that the six SAA catalysts have comparable activity. To screen an eligible catalyst, the selectivity of these SAA catalysts in the eNRR is worth studying further in the following.
In addition, we found a new descriptor for describing the activity of the SAA catalysts, where the charge transfer during N2 adsorption has a volcanic relationship with the UL of the whole reaction (Fig. 6). We found that during N2 adsorption, the UL of the whole reaction becomes lower and lower as the charge gain of N2 from the catalyst gradually increases, reaching a minimum value when N2 obtains 0.27 e− from the catalyst. When N2 obtained more charges from the catalyst, the activity of the catalyst started to decrease. The SAA catalyst exhibited high reaction activity when N2 obtained 0.25 to 0.28 e− from the catalyst.
 Fig. 6  Volcanic relationship between the charge transfer during N2 adsorption and the UL of the whole reaction. 
Selectivity
Previous studies have shown that the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the eNRR is extremely low on most pure metal surfaces.13,60 The pure metal surfaces are easily covered by hydrogen atoms, which can occupy the active center of the catalyst and result in high selectivity for the HER. Thus, the HER has long been viewed as a competitive reaction and a key limiting factor in the determination of low selectivity for the eNRR.
To evaluate the selectivity of all the SAA catalysts studied here in the eNRR, we have calculated a series of free energy changes for the adsorption of the H atom on the surface of the SAA catalysts studied here. Fig. 7 summarizes the differences in the adsorption free energy of the H atom and N2 molecule for all the SAA catalysts studied here.
 Fig. 7  Comparison of the adsorption free energy for the N2 molecule and H atom on the 17 SAA catalysts. The region above the red line means that N2 is preferentially adsorbed. The region below the red line means that the H atom is preferentially adsorbed. 
This difference provides a clear understanding of the occupation of the active sites by the N2 molecule or H atom. If ΔG(*N2) > ΔG(*H), this indicates that the N2 molecule will preferentially occupy the active sites of the catalysts, and therefore the H atom cannot be adsorbed onto the active sites of the catalysts, resulting in a high probability about the reaction of *N2 + H+ + e− → *NNH when compared with that of the reaction of M + H+ + e−→ M–H.61–65 As shown in Fig. 7, eight SAA catalysts tend to adsorb the N2 molecule instead of the H atom (TM/Re(111), TM = Mn, Ru, Cr, Fe, Mo, Co, Ag, and W). Moreover, four of the eight SAA catalysts, TM/Re(111) (TM = Mn, W, Co, and Ru), can spontaneously adsorb N2 at 298.15 K because the calculated free energy change for the adsorption of the N2 molecule is negative. This means that N2 will be preferentially anchored to the active sites of the four SAA catalysts, which will result in a higher surface concentration of *N2 relative to *H. This indicates that the surface of the TM/Re(111) (TM = Mn, W, Co, and Ru) SAA catalysts has the capability to improve the selectivity of the eNRR and inhibit the selectivity of the HER.
According to previous studies, the catalyst with ΔG(*H) ≈ 0 can be classified as a HER catalyst under the ideal situation.66,67 Our DFT calculations show that the free energy changes for the adsorption of the H atom on the surface of the four SAA catalysts are +0.42, +0.19, +0.11, and +0.06 eV for Mn/Re(111), W/Re(111), Co/Re(111), and Ru/Re(111), respectively. Obviously, the Mn/Re(111) SAA possesses a significant positive free energy change for the adsorption of the H atom. By contrast, the calculated free energy changes for the adsorption of the H atom on the surface of the W/Re(111), Co/Re(111), and Ru/Re(111) SAA catalysts are all fairly close to zero. Thus, they should be classified as HER catalysts, rather than eNRR catalysts. All these results indicate that Mn/Re(111) is an excellent catalyst with both high activity and selectivity for the eNRR.
Mechanism
To understand the origin of the high activity and selectivity, we investigate the electronic structure of the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst by using various wavefunction analysis theories. According to a previous study, the activation of the N2 molecule by TM atoms mainly arises from a bidirectional charge transfer between *N2 and the catalysts. This process is called the “acceptance–donation” interaction,68 in which the unoccupied d orbital of the TM atom accepts lone pairs of electrons from N2 while the occupied d orbital of the TM atom reversely contributes electrons to the empty π* orbital of N2 in the opposite direction (Fig. 8a).

(b) The partial density of states (PDOS) of the Mn atom (3d orbital) and N2 molecule before and after adsorption. (c) The projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) between the TM and N on the Mn/Re(111) SAA. The dashed line indicates the EF. (d) Bader charge transfer between N2 and the Mn/Re(111) SAA. 
We firstly examined the partial density of states (PDOS) for the intermediate after adsorption of the N2 molecule on the surface of the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst (Fig. 8b). It can be found that the energy levels of the 3d orbital of Mn and the π* orbital of N2 are well-matched, and the high spin polarization of the Mn atom results in the d–π* bonding and antibonding orbitals across the EF. This indicates a strong interaction between Mn and N2, and therefore a higher adsorption energy of N2 on the surface of the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst.
To further elucidate the activation mechanism of N2 by the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst, we investigated the bonding and anti-bonding states for the intermediate after adsorption of the N2 molecule on the surface of the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst by the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP)69 analysis. The pCOHP curves for the interaction of the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst with N2 are shown in Fig. 8c. The positive (bonding) and negative (antibonding) contributions are shown on the right and left sides of the figure, respectively. Below the EF, both the bonding and partial antibonding contributions were found clearly. Moreover, the binding contributions are larger than those of antibonding. Such results indicate that the d–π(Mn–N2) bonding interaction effectively counteracts the d–π(Mn–N2) antibonding contributions, thus leading to a strong Mn–N2 bonding interaction via the so-called “acceptance–donation” pattern. As shown in Fig. 8d, the calculated Bader charge transfer value of the adsorbed N2 molecule is +0.27 e−, indicating a total charge transfer from the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst to the adsorbed N2 molecule via the “acceptance–donation” interaction. A detailed analysis shows that the bridging N atom obtains 0.24 e−, and the terminal N atom only obtains 0.03 e− (Fig. 8d). Such a result indicates that the basicity of the terminal N atom is significantly lower than that of the bridging N atom. Because of the poor basicity of the terminal N atom, there is a very low reactivity of the terminal N atom with a proton in the primary step for the reduction of N2 to NH3. This is in good agreement with our free energy calculations, in which the first hydrogenation step of *N2 + H+ + e− → *NNH is calculated to be the PDS in both the distal and alternating pathways.
On the other hand, our Bader charge analysis shows that ∼0.46 e− is transferred from the H atom to the N2 moiety in the *N2 intermediate when the first H atom is transferred to *N2 to form *NNH (Fig. S5†). And thus, the N2 moiety in *NNH obtained 0.51 e− and can be viewed as the *N2−˙ radical. Because of the high reactivity of the *N2−˙ radical, the calculated free energy changes of the subsequent hydrogenation processes along the favorable pathway are close to 0 eV or even negative.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we explored the activity and selectivity of the eNRR on TM/Re(111) SAA catalysts doped with different TM atoms by using periodic DFT calculations. The results indicate that the synthesis of all the SAA catalysts studied is experimentally feasible thermodynamically. The charge transfer between the TM atom and defective Re(111) surface enhances effectively the metal–support interaction, and thus results in high stability. The investigation of the adsorption behavior of the SAA catalysts studied here shows a good linear relationship between the Bader charge of the N2 moiety and the N–N bond distance, indicating a significant correlation effect between them. The N2 molecule can be well adsorbed on the surface of the five SAA catalysts, TM/Re(111), TM = Mn, W, Co, Cr, and Tc, via an end-on configuration. The calculated free energy changes for the adsorption of the NH3 molecule and the reduction of N2 to NH3via six PCET processes show that the six SAA catalysts TM/Re(111) (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Tc, Ru, and Os) may have a high activity because of the low free energy barrier and low desorption energy for the NH3 molecule. However, an investigation about competitive adsorption of the H atom and N2 molecule on the surface of these SAA catalysts shows that the Mn/Re(111) SAA can effectively improve the selectivity of the eNRR and inhibit that of the HER, simultaneously. Such results indicate that the Mn/Re(111) SAA may be an excellent catalyst with high activity and selectivity for the eNRR. The unique catalytic performance of the Mn/Re(111) SAA in the eNRR can be attributed to a significant bidirectional charge transfer via an acceptance–donation interaction between N2 and the Mn/Re(111) SAA catalyst. According to the electronic structure analysis, the hydrogenation of the *N2 intermediate results in the formation of a *N2−˙ radical in the *NNH intermediate. The high reactivity of the *N2−˙ radical in the *NNH intermediate leads to a thermodynamic downhill pathway for the subsequent hydrogenation processes along the favorable distal pathway.

 	Fig. 1  (a) TM atoms were anchored to the defective Re(111) surface to form a variety of SAA catalysts, and (b) the structural formula of the SAA catalysts.	 
Eb = ETM/Re(111) − ETMsingle − EDefectiveRe(111)	(4)
Ec = ETMbulk/n − ETMsingle	(5)

 	Fig. 2  (a) Bader charge transfer between Mn and the defective Re(111) surface. The positive value represents that the atom obtains Bader charge. (b) The charge density difference of the Mn/Re SAA. Red and green isosurfaces represent charge accumulation and depletion in the space. The isosurface value was set to 0.005 e Å−3.	 

 	Scheme 1  The adsorption configurations of N2 on the TM/Re(111) SAA in an end-on configuration and a side-on configuration, respectively. The cyan, purple, and blue colors indicate Re, TM, and N atoms, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  Relationship between the Bader charge and N–N bond length of the adsorbed N2 molecule.	 

 	Scheme 2  The distal and alternating mechanisms for the reduction of N2 to NH3. The blue and red solid arrows represent the distal and alternating mechanisms, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Free energy changes of the first PCET process and (b) desorption of the second NH3 molecule on all the SAA catalysts studied here.	 

 	Fig. 5  Free energy changes of N2 reduction to NH3 catalyzed by Mn/Re(111), Cr/Re(111), Fe/Re(111), Tc/Re(111), Ru/Re(111), and Os/Re(111), respectively. The blue and red solid lines represent the intermediates of the distal and alternating mechanisms, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 6  Volcanic relationship between the charge transfer during N2 adsorption and the UL of the whole reaction.	 

 	Fig. 7  Comparison of the adsorption free energy for the N2 molecule and H atom on the 17 SAA catalysts. The region above the red line means that N2 is preferentially adsorbed. The region below the red line means that the H atom is preferentially adsorbed.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Schematic diagram of the charge transfer process between TM atoms and N2. (b) The partial density of states (PDOS) of the Mn atom (3d orbital) and N2 molecule before and after adsorption. (c) The projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) between the TM and N on the Mn/Re(111) SAA. The dashed line indicates the EF. (d) Bader charge transfer between N2 and the Mn/Re(111) SAA.
