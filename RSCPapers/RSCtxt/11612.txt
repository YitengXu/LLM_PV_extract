    , Accepted 20th May 2013First published on 21st May 2013AbstractNovel three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical macroporous–mesoporous layered titanates were synthesized by self-assembly of interconnected “house-of-cards”-type nanosheets with a facile template-free solvothermal method in presence of hydrazine. Prolonging the time of solvothermal treatment led to the enlargement in size and thickness of the titanate nanosheets in the materials. When the solvothermal temperature was increased, diamond-shaped nanoparticles without macrochannels were formed. Stability of the unique 3D architectures in the materials was attained by post-thermal treatment of the materials in temperatures ranging between 500 and 900 °C. During the post-thermal treatment, a gradual transformation from flake-like titanates with porous structures to anatase/rutile crystalline particles was also observed. Such changes in the hierarchical morphology significantly altered the porosity, crystallinity, and optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the layered titanate materials. Owing to their hierarchical 3D porous structures, large surface area and appropriate band gap energy, these novel layered titanate materials exhibited higher adsorption capacity and more efficient photodegradation catalytic activity towards organic contaminants in wastewater compared with the commercially available P25 TiO2 (Degussa/Evonik) and many other previously reported hierarchical TiO2 materials.
Introduction
With the tremendous research efforts made in nanoscience and nanotechnology over the past two decades or so, numerous synthetic approaches have been explored for the design and synthesis of various nanomaterials with different compositions and structures for a myriad of applications.1,2 These efforts have resulted in several different types of shape- and size-controlled zero-dimensional nanomaterials (e.g., nanodots and nanoparticles); one-dimensional nanomaterials (e.g., nanowires, nanotubes, nanofibers, nanoneedles and nanorods); two-dimensional nanomaterials (e.g., nanosheets, nanoflakes and nanoplates); three-dimensional (3D) nanomaterials (e.g., “nanoflowers”, core–shell nanoparticles, nanourchins and nanosheaves); and many other complex superstructures.3 Recently, investigation of synthetic methods to nanomaterials with 3D hierarchical nanostructured geometries at multiple length scales has attracted more attention; this is because such materials have better mass-transfer properties for many targeted molecular species and possess large specific surface area for accumulation of different analytes.4–9 These materials are, therefore, among the most suitable for numerous applications including adsorption, separation, and catalysis. However, because many of the properties of 3D hierarchical nanostructured materials depend on the nature of their 3D structures, advances in synthetic methods that can lead to tunable 3D super-nanostructures with concomitantly improved adsorption properties are still sought.
Of many different compositions, metal oxides are generally more conducive for building 3D supernanostructures with, because they can easily be prepared in solution via methods such as the sol–gel process and by using relatively easily accessible reagents such as metal alkoxides. TiO2 and Ti-related oxides, in particular, are more appealing for making 3D supernanostructures with, because of their interesting semiconducting properties as well as potential applications in areas as diverse as sunscreens, paints, solar cells, photocatalysis, environmental purification, electronic devices, and energy storage and conversions.10–15 Moreover, TiO2 and other Ti-based oxides can take a range of fascinating geometries, polymorphs, and dimensions when synthesized using synthetic methods such as co-precipitation, hydrothermal-solvothermal synthesis, electrochemical synthesis, chemical vapor deposition, micelle/reverse micelle (surfactant-assisted) techniques, etc.1,8,9,11,14 However, some of these synthetic methods employ lengthy or complex procedures, produce small quantity of samples, or require expensive instrumentation set-ups.
Herein we report a facile, efficient and cost-effective approach for the synthesis of hierarchical macro–mesoporous layered titanate superstructures composed of 3D interconnected “house-of-cards”-type titanate nanoflakes. Unlike many other synthetic methods that use templates to produce nanoporous structures, the method reported here involves no template or structure-directing agents to afford the hierarchical macro–mesoporous structures in the materials. Moreover, the resulting materials possess specific unique geometries, large surface area, and other desirable physico-chemical properties, such as high adsorption capacity and very good photocatalytic activity for photodegradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solutions. The resulting unique hierarchical porous titanates were also proven to be better photocatalysts for degradation of organic compounds than many other titania-based materials reported in the literature, including mesoporous titania.
Experimental section
Synthesis of hierarchical layered titanate (HLT)
All of the chemical reagents used in the synthesis of the materials described in this report were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without further purification. The HLTs were synthesized by a simple, one-pot and template-free synthetic method. Typically, a mixture of titanium n-butoxide (TBOT, 8.5 g) and 100 mL of monohydrate hydrazine (MH, 80 wt%) was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After stirring at 80 °C for 4 h, the solution was then treated under solvothermal conditions in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at different temperatures for various reaction times (see below for details). The resulting solid materials were then separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol (via centrifugation, followed by decantation). Finally, the solid products were dried at 80 °C overnight and then ground into fine powder.
To investigate the effects of synthetic conditions on the structures, morphology, and morphological evolution of the HLT materials, different reaction times and temperatures were used during the synthesis of the materials. This included solvothermal reaction times of 15, 30 and 45 h; solvothermal temperatures of 120, 160 and 200 °C; and calcination temperatures of 500, 600, 700 and 900 °C. The resulting materials were denoted hereafter as “HLT-T-t(-i)”, where T, t and i represent the reaction temperature, solvothermal time in hours, and heat treatment conditions, respectively, used for the synthesis of the respective materials (see Table 1).

Characterization techniques
The morphology of the samples was characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL, JSM-600F, 10 kV) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the samples were also obtained with the HR-TEM microscope. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and information about the crystal structures of the materials were acquired using a Rigaku D/MAZX2500V/PC high power diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) that was run with a scan rate of 2°(2θ) min−1. The optical absorption properties of the materials were studied with a UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer (SPECORD® 210 Plus, Analytikjena). N2 sorption measurements were conducted with a Micromeritics ASAP2020 instrument. Other analytical techniques used for characterization of the materials such as Raman, FT-IR, TGA and XPS are described in detail in ESI.†
Simulated solar photocatalytic activity measurement
The photocatalytic activity of the materials was evaluated based on their catalytic activity towards photodegradation of methylene blue (C16H18N3SCl·3H2O, MB). In a typical experiment, 10 mg of the HLT material was dispersed in 100 mL of aqueous MB solution (Co = 3 × 10−5 M), which was kept in a reaction chamber surrounded by water jacket that was used to maintain the photoreactor's temperature constant. The solution was kept initially in the dark under constant stirring until the adsorption of MB on the material reached equilibrium. An Osram 300 W Ultra Vitalux UV sunlamp, which gives off mainly UV-A light (315–400 nm) and partly UV-B light (280–315 nm), was then switched on to illuminate the photoreactor. For comparison purposes, a similar test was conducted by using the commercially available and widely used P25 TiO2 (Degussa/Evonik) as photocatalyst. The degradation of MB upon light exposure and in presence or absence of the photocatalysts was then determined with UV-Vis absorbance microplate spectrophotometer (Spectra Max® Plus 384) by withdrawing samples from the photoreactor at 5 min interval, centrifuging them, carefully separating the precipitate from the supernatant by decantation, and finally measuring the supernatant's absorbance at λmax = 664 nm.
Results and discussion
Morphological evolution of hierarchical layered titanates
The synthesis of hierarchical layered titanates (HLTs) with controlled morphologies was achieved by solvothermal treatment of TBOT in MH solution and by adjusting the experimental parameters such as the solvothermal time period, temperature and post-treatment conditions. The geometries and structural and textural properties of all the resulting HLT materials are summarized in Table 1.
Influence of solvothermal time period
The FE-SEM and HR-TEM images showing the morphologies and the changes in morphologies of the HLT materials obtained under solvothermal treatment at 120 °C for 15, 30 and 45 h are displayed in Fig. 1 and 2. The images show novel paralleled macrochannel architectures composed of interconnected “house-of-card”-type nanoflakes in all of the materials obtained at 120 °C regardless of the solvothermal time periods employed to synthesize them. The dimension of the paralleled macrochannels ranged from 1 to 7 μm. However, when shorter solvothermal treatment times were used, their channel diameters became bigger, with the biggest value being exhibited by HLT-120-15. As seen from the corresponding magnified FE-SEM images (Fig. 1b and d and 2b), prolonging the reaction time resulted in 2D-like nanoflakes with significantly enlarged perimeters and thickness. The HR-TEM micrograph in Fig. 2c revealed that the thickness of an individual nanoflake was ca. 2.4–2.8 nm, with interplanar spacing of 0.70 nm.

This corresponds well with the diffraction peak at ∼9.8° in the XRD patterns of the materials (Fig. 3), which can be attributed to the interlayer distance d200 of layered protonic titanate H2Ti2O5·H2O (JCPDS 47-0124).11,26 In addition to this diffraction peak, the XRD patterns of the different HLT-120 samples (HLT-120-t) showed multiple broad peaks ranging from 15 to 30°, accompanied by a series of smaller diffraction peaks at 32, 38, 48 and 63°; these peaks are all characteristic XRD peaks of protonic titanates H2Ti2O5·H2O, belonging to general formula of H2TinO2n+1·xH2O (n = ∼2–8).11,24,26 This clearly indicates that the HLT-120-t materials we studied are composed of layered titanates. This information is also in agreement with the results obtained from FT-Raman spectra (Fig. S1 in ESI†), which revealed peaks corresponding to layered titanates in all of the HLT-120-t samples. The presence of Ti and O species was further evidenced by EDX analysis of the samples, e.g., the EDX spectrum of HLT-120-15 displayed in Fig. S2 in ESI.†

Core-level (N 1s) analysis of the HLT samples using XPS is depicted in Fig. S3 in ESI.† The result indicated the presence of trace amount of N species in the HLT samples. As hydrazine was the only N-containing reagent used for the synthesis of the HLT materials, it should be the only likely source of the N species in the samples. The spectra however did not show any evidence for the presence of substitutional N in the form of Ti–N in the lattice of the HLT materials, as no peak in the range of 396–397 eV that correspond to Ti–N moieties was observed in the spectra.16–19 The small N1s peak observed at 399.7 eV was, therefore, attributed to N species chemically bound to hydrogen16 or to interstitially oxidized N atoms present in form of Ti–O–N linkages.17 On the other hand, the dominant peak in the range of 401–402 eV was attributed to molecularly adsorbed N2, N-containing surface contaminates,18,19 and/or possibly also free hydrazine impurities. By using these results, two possible pathways by which hydrazine possibly took part in during the formation of the HLT materials were proposed: (1) owing to its basic properties and its being in aqueous solution, hydrazine could undergo hydrolysis or acid–base type dissociation in water to form singly or doubly charged hydrazinium ions: H2N–NH3+ (or ≡N2H5+) or +H3N–NH3+ ≡ N2H62+, or (2) the hydrazinium ions could then be trapped or intercalated in between the titanate layers as the layers form.20,21
FTIR was also used to analyze the samples further. The FT-IR spectra (Fig. S4, in ESI†) of the HLT samples showed a wagging vibration at ∼1110 cm−1 and two bending bands at ∼1410 and 1460 cm−1 corresponding to the charged –NH3+ groups of the hydrazinium ions.22 Moreover, an absorption band (a band at ∼1401 cm−1) corresponding to NH4+ species was observed in the spectra. In addition, the spectra showed a series of absorption bands at ∼505, 670, 910 and 1629 cm−1 that are attributable to protonated titanate species. However, the stretching vibration corresponding to Ti–N bonds (i.e., a band at ∼1030 cm−1) was once again not detected, corroborating the XPS result above.
We expected that the HLT nanostructures synthesized here with their hierarchical macrochannel geometry and their “house-of-cards”-like structures, as seen from their TEM and SEM images, would possess good porosity and large surface area. To confirm this and also obtain quantitative information about their textural parameters and porosity, the samples were characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption (and the results are summarized in Table 1). Not surprisingly, the N2 adsorption/desorption data indicated that the materials possessed relatively large specific surface area (500–600 m2 g−1) and large pore volumes (0.9–0.95 cm3 g−1); these values are comparable to those of other highly porous titanate-based materials previously reported in the literature.11,23–26 Furthermore, the porosity of the materials was found to change as the synthetic conditions were varied. For example, when longer solvothermal treatment was employed during the synthesis of the materials, the resulting materials had lower surface areas and larger average pore size. This result is consistent with the observations made by TEM and SEM analysis; i.e., the TEM and SEM images also showed that the materials synthesized with longer solvothermal times had bigger size nanoflakes, with concomitantly increased pore sizes.
Thermal stability of HLT superstructures
Next up, the thermal stability of the 3D hierarchical nanostructures in the HLT materials was investigated, by treating selected samples at higher temperatures and then characterizing them. As shown in Fig. 4, the macrochannels of HLT-120-45 remained unchanged after treatment of the sample under high temperature, although its “house-of-cards”-type walls underwent significant changes. For instance, the nanoflakes in the macroscopic walls of HLT-120-45 began to crack at 500 °C (Fig. 4a and b) and then gradually transform into granular-shaped particles with average lengths of 300–600 nm at 600 °C (Fig. 4c and d).
 Fig. 4  Stability of the 3D hierarchical HLT-120-45 structure after post-treatment at (a and b) 500 °C, (c and d) 600 °C, (e and f) 700 °C and (g and h) 900 °C. 
The XRD results of the sample in Fig. 5 further showed phase transformation from titanate to crystallite anatase, and then to anatase/rutile or rutile phases upon high temperature treatment. This is presumably due to high temperature-induced dehydration of the layered titanates in the materials, which consisted of zigzag chain-like structures composed of several [TiO6] octahedral units linked by edge-sharing and proton/water molecules (H+/H3O+) intercalating the structures.25,26 As the temperature was increased to 600 °C, the [TiO6] octahedra can be rearranged via: (i) face-shared bonding that form spiral chains of anatase titania and (ii) edge-shared bonding that form chains along c-axis, followed by corner-shared bonding among chains that lead to rutile structure.27,28 Subsequent increases in the temperature above 600 °C resulted in large numbers of aggregated particles with irregular shapes and bigger sizes within the macropore walls, as seen in Fig. 4e and f. Finally, heat treatment of the material at 900 °C resulted in the HLT-120-45 sample possessing walls entirely composed of very large particles with large macrochannel pores. The treatment at 900 °C also made rutile to be the major phase in the HLT samples. Due to high degree of crystallinity and condensation of the oxide networks upon sintering, a concomitant reduction in the surface area of the material occurred, producing surface areas as low as 12–82 m2 g−1 (cf. the surface of the original as-synthesized material, which is 495 m2 g−1) (Table 1).

Effect of solvothermal temperature
In order to obtain some insights about the underlying growth mechanisms during the formation of the hierarchical HLT materials, a series of experiments was conducted at different solvothermal temperatures for 45 h. As displayed in Fig. 6a, sample HLT-160-45 did not exhibit macrochannels that were typically observed in HLT-120-t; however, the former still contained “house-of-cards”-type flakes, despite its flakes' size was much bigger (500–600 nm) than those of HLT-120-45. This increase in flake size explains why the funnel-like macroporous geometry was absent in HLT-160-45 and why its BET surface area is significantly reduced to 398 m2 g−1 compared with that of HLT-120-45 (Table 1). Moreover, HR-TEM images of HLT-160-45 clearly show the shrinkage of its interplanar spacing to 0.68 nm and the expansion of its flake thickness to 3.1–3.8 nm in comparison with those of HLT-120-45 (whose d-spacing is 0.70 nm and flake thickness is 2.4–2.8 nm). This result is also consistent with the slight shift in the Bragg reflections of HLT-120-45 to larger 2-theta values, as shown in the XRD pattern of the sample in Fig. S5 (see in ESI†). The FT-Raman bands of the samples obtained with solvothermal temperatures at higher temperatures for 45 min were similar to those of HLT-120-45 (Fig. S6†).
 Fig. 6  (a–c) Morphology of HLT-160-45, which was obtained at solvothermal treatment at 160 °C for 45 h; the sample appeared to have interconnected nanoflakes without macrochannels. (d–f) Large aggregates of HLT-200-45, which was obtained after solvothermal treatment at 200 °C for 45 h; the sample appears to have abundant diamond-shaped particles. 
When the solvothermal synthesis was carried out at 200 °C for 45 h, the resulting HLT material had large aggregates consisting of abundant diamond-shaped nanoparticles with octahedral structure and sharp edges, as shown in Fig. 6d and e. The sizes of the diamond-shaped structures were not uniform and ranged from 50 to 150 nm. HR-TEM images revealed that the nanoparticles were composed of highly crystalline structures with a representative lattice fringe of 0.34 nm, which was assigned to (101) reflection of anatase TiO2. This value is in agreement with the XRD pattern of the sample (HLT-200-45) (Fig. S5†), which displays numerous peaks at 25.3, 38.2, 48.5 and 63.2° (2-theta) corresponding to the (101), (004), (200) and (204) reflections of pure crystalline anatase, respectively (JCPDS 21-1272). The phase transformation occurring at higher solvothermal temperature can be ascribed to possible high-temperature driven re-assembly of [TiO6] octahedron units.29 In other words, we could conclude that higher solvothermal temperature promoted the crystal growth of titania, gradually transferring it from layered titanate to anatase. This was further corroborated by FT-IR spectra of the samples obtained at higher solvothermal temperatures (Fig. S7†), which showed several characteristic bands in the range of 400–850 cm−1 that correspond to anatase TiO2.
Growth mechanism of hierarchical layered titanate
In general, the solvothermal time, reaction temperature and post-treatment conditions were all found to play important roles in the morphological evolution of the HLT materials. Most importantly, although no template or surfactant assemblies were used, our solvothermal synthesis in presence of MH still gave good macroporous HLT structures with comparable pore properties as those of other previously reported macroporous materials that were synthesized using templating methods, or from the self-assembly of titania or other metal oxide nanoparticles.4–7,9,30
By taking into consideration all the results obtained and discussed above, the synthesis and evolution of the structures and morphology of the HLT materials is proposed as illustrated in Scheme 1. Because in our study the nanoporous titanate structures were easily formed by using only Ti-alkoxide precursor in hydrazine monohydrate solution (i.e., without any templating agent), we proposed that the unique hierarchical porous titanate structures in the HLT materials were the result of self-assembly and instantaneous precipitation reactions, as previously reported for other materials.7,8 According to these previous reports, the components of the solid metal oxide phase can be spontaneously organized via a hydrolysis-condensation process to form the macroporous structures, while the particles aggregate and neck with one another to give rise to interstitial void spaces and mesoporous structures in the materials.7 It was also demonstrated that the pH of the reaction mixture can strongly dictate whether the self-assembly processes leads to hierarchical structures or not; in this regard, basic solutions were, in particular, suggested to be favorable to the formation of well-ordered macroporous titania-based materials from TBOT precursor.7 Thus, the formation of the HLT materials we reported here must have followed this same process because MH (an alkaline solution) was the only reagent present in the reaction solution, besides TBOT. The basic condition in our case may have also contributed to the formation of the nanoflakes within the macrochannel walls, in the same way as how other materials with similar structures were obtained under hydrothermal conditions at low temperatures (<120 °C) in the presence of highly concentrated alkaline solutions such as NaOH, KOH, LiOH, or (C4H9)4NOH solution.11,31
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the evolution of morphology of HLTs: the walls of the hierarchical macrochannels composed of interconnected “house-of-card”-type nanosheets became larger and thicker as the solvothermal treatment times were increased from 15 h to 45 h. Further increase in the reaction temperature led to the transformation of the morphology of the HLTs into aggregated diamond-like structure. Additionally, when the materials were post-treated under different calcination temperatures, their unique nanosheet-like structures gradually transformed to small nanoparticles. 
Apart from serving as the reaction medium and making the solution basic, MH can also function as a chelating ligand. It is well-established that the metal centers in metal alkoxide precursors are susceptible to attack by strong nucleophiles.32,33 Thus, during the hydrolysis of TBOT, the replacement of butoxy groups by hydrazine via hydrazinolysis could occur, forming hydrazide or other intermediate complexes such as Ti(O–Bu)4−x(N2H4−x), Ti(O–Bu)4−x(N2H3)x, Ti(O–Bu)4−x(NH)x, and Ti(O–Bu)4−x(N2H2)xTi(O–Bu)4−x species.33,34 The subsequent condensation/polymerization of these species could finally form the Ti–O bonds of the layered titanate structures intercalated with H+ and/or H3O+ ions.
Photodegradation of organic compounds by UV sunlamp using HLT as photocatalyst

Morphology-dependent photocatalytic activities of HLTs. 
Owing to their macroporous structures and unique superstructured assemblies composed of “house-of-cards”-type titanate flakes, the HLTs reported here could potentially be suitable for accumulation, diffusion, and subsequent transfer of organic molecules or organic pollutants to the surface of the materials, predictably accelerating the decomposition of the organic species. Hence, the morphology-dependent photocatalytic activities of the HLTs were evaluated by using the HLTs as photocatalyst for photodegradation reaction of MB dye (a model organic pollutant) under UV sunlamp. As expected, the materials showed good photocatalytic activities. The photocatalytic activity of HLT-120-45 and HLT-160-45, in particular, were found to be the strongest towards the photodegradation of MB, as shown in Fig. 7a, and both materials enabled the complete photodecomposition of MB under 40 min exposure to solar simulated light. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of the HLT materials towards the photodegradation of MB was found to be much higher than those of the octahedral particles (see Table 2) and also the commercial TiO2–P25 (90%).

The kinetics or rate of photodecomposition of MB was then studied to quantitatively evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the HLTs. The results show that the photocatalytic degradation profiles of MB obey the Langmuir–Hinshelwood first-order kinetic model, as described in eqn (1):35 (1)where C and C0 are the concentration of MB at initial time and at time t, respectively; k is the rate constant; K is the adsorption coefficient; and kapp denotes the apparent first-order rate constant (when C0 is very small or KC ≪ 1). By plotting graphs of ln(C/C0) versus f(t), as in Fig. 7b, the values of kapp were derived from the slope of the linear graphs obtained. As summarized in Table 2, HLT-120-45, which possessed macro–mesoporous superstructure, exhibited the fastest reaction rate (162.64 × 10−3 min−1). This rate is higher than that obtained for the HLT having “house-of-cards”-type titanate flakes with no hierarchical geometry (126.61 × 10−3 min−1), and five-fold greater than the rate obtained for the photocatalyst possessing diamond-like structure (30.90 × 10−3 min−1). Overall, the catalytic activity of the HLT materials toward the photodegradation of MB was found to decrease in the order of materials containing: hierarchical macrochannels > “house-of-card”-assembled particles > P25 > octahedral aggregates (Table 2).
Owing to their unique geometries and extremely large surface area, the supernanostructured HLT materials that we synthesized and reported here were also found to exhibit superior photocatalytic activities compared with many other porous TiO2–based materials, such as mesoporous TiO2 obtained via surfactant supramolecular template-assisted route as well as other previously reported hierarchical titanate and TiO2 materials possessing various morphologies. For example, Bai et al.36 reported the synthesis of 3D dandelion-like TiO2 composed of TiO2 nanorod aggregates that shows photocatalytic activity. However, the photocatalytic activity of the material towards decomposition of methyl orange (MO) in presence of UV light for 1 h was only comparable to that of the commercial P25 TiO2; in other words, the photocatalytic activity of the material was lower than that of HLT under the same photocatalytic conditions. In another work, Zhu et al.37 synthesized flower-shaped hierarchical TiO2 mesoporous spheres composed of anatase nanosheets, which possessed a surface area of 170 m2 g−1. The adsorption capacity of the materials towards MB after 4 h in the dark was as high as 12 mg g−1, i.e., about 4.8 times higher than that of P25. When subsequently irradiated with UV light for 240 min, the dye underwent complete degradation with kapp of 0.0363 min−1, a value better than that obtained with P25 (0.0159 min−1) but lower than that obtained with HLT in our case (Table 2). Similarly, Ge et al.38 reported the hydrothermal synthesis of flower-shaped TiO2 nanostructures possessing SBET = 60.2 m2 g−1 and composed of wimble-shaped nanorods. In absence of H2O2, this hierarchical TiO2 material resulted in mineralization of 63% of rhodamine B (RhB) in 80 min; upon addition of H2O2 (19.80 mM) and under simulated solar light irradiation, ∼100% photodegradation of RhB was achieved with a reaction rate constant of 0.045 min−1. Huang et al.39 reported the synthesis of flower-shaped hierarchical titanate material with a surface area of 290 m2 g−1 and a lower band gap energy of 3.5 eV. In comparison with titanate nanotubes and nanowires, the material showed larger adsorption capacity and faster adsorption kinetics towards MB and therefore a higher photocatalytic activity towards the photodegradation of MB (by completely degrading MB in solution over 1 h irradiation with UV-B after adsorption equilibrium); however, the photocatalytic efficiency of the material is still lower than the one obtained in our case. In another example, Zhao et al.40 reported a simple and fluorine-free hydrothermal synthetic method for the synthesis of hierarchically ordered mesoporous anatase TiO2 spheres that consisted of pear-shaped, long nanorods that were covered by a square-shaped “nano-mosaics” with a few tens of nanometers in size. Compared with P25, the material showed higher adsorption capacity and photocatalytic performance towards RhB, with kapp = 0.025–0.035 min−1 in 75 min. Recently, Wang et al.41 synthesized complex 3D TiO2 nanoboxes by employing TiOF2 nanocubes as templates through topotactic reaction. The photocatalysts were shown to degrade 96–96% of RhB in 75 min with kapp of 2.19–3.3 h−1 under Xe arc lamp irradiation.
Thus, based on comparison with the properties and photocatalytic activity of many of these recently reported titania-based materials, overall the 3D HLT materials reported in our study clearly show better photocatalytic activity. This is further corroborated by directly comparing the photodegradation catalytic activity of HLT-120-45 towards MB with respect to other hierarchically ordered materials that we also reported before.42 The results (Fig. S8 in ESI†) clearly confirm that the HLT materials reported herein possess significantly higher photocatalytic activity than many other forms of hierarchical titanate materials.
The higher photocatalytic activity of HLT-120-45 and HLT-160-45 compared with the others can be attributed to the fact that the former have flake- or sheet-like structures as well as large specific surface area. This is not unprecedented considering the fact that flake- or sheet-like structures have previously been found to be more favorable for the diffusion and separation of photoexcited charge carriers in photocatalysis.12 Furthermore, surfaces and edges in nanosheets in other materials were shown to serve as the prominent oxidation and reduction sites for photocatalysis because they render a very short path length for the diffusion of holes and electrons photogenerated on the materials.12 This makes the holes to readily reach the surface of the materials and be trapped by interlayer H2O, while at the same time, it makes the electrons to diffuse more freely and sufficiently until they reach the edges of the materials. These processes, in turn lead, to significant inhibition of possible recombination of charge carriers and improvement in the photocatalytic activities of the materials.12

Relation of photocatalytic performance to textural and optical properties of HLTs
The 3D interconnected and “house-of-cards”-type structure of the HLTs are also beneficial in photocatalysis because they increase the materials' adsorption capacity to MB (or other organic pollutants). This was proven by plotting and comparing the adsorption to MB (in mg) per mass of HLT (or gcat, gram of catalyst) versus time for the different samples; the graphs are depicted in Fig. S9 in ESI.† For example, the equilibrium MB uptake, qe, of HLT-120-45 was found to be 88.11 mg gcat−1, which is 10% higher than that of HLT-160-45 and two-fold higher than that of HLT-200-45, which possessed diamond-shaped particles. The superior adsorption capacity of HLT-120-45 and HLT-160-45 for MB can also be inferred from their lowest value of pseudo-second-order adsorption rate constant (2.03 × 10−6 min−1) (see Table 2). In the case of HLT-120-45, its high adsorption capacity is most likely due to the fact that this material has the largest surface area among the three materials synthesized. Moreover, its 3D hierarchical porous structure and numerous macrochannels and interconnected mesopores possibly may have provided it with more interstitial or accessible spaces for the MB molecules to efficiently adsorb, accumulate or migrate in it. Despite lacking macroporosity and having smaller surface area, HLT-160-45 still exhibited good performance; this may have stemmed from the fact that this material has good mesoporous structure due to its a very large total pore volume (1.2 cm3 g−1) and interconnected titanate flakes (please note that HLT-160-45 has the largest total pore volume of the three samples investigated here, i.e., HLT-120-45, HLT-160-45, and HLT-200-45).
It is well-established now that the photocatalytic activities of many semiconducting materials, including HLTs, correlate with their optical properties. When exposed to light with appropriate energy and wavelength (E ≥ Eg, where Eg is the band gap of the material), a photocatalytic material generates electron–hole pairs due to excitation of its electrons from its valance band to conduction band.10 The electrons and holes can then react with oxygen and hydroxyl ions from surface adsorbed water molecules, respectively, and produce superoxide anions ˙O2− and reactive hydroxyl (˙OH) radicals. These species can serve as strong reductant and oxidant, and subsequently decompose and transform harmful organic substances into harmless or much less harmful products such as CO2 and H2O. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of many photocatalytic materials relies directly on the degree of separation (or inversely on the possible recombination) of the photoexcited electrons and holes. Apart from the charge carrier separation/recombination, the photocatalytic efficiency of a photocatalytic material depends on its ability to adsorb the reacting organic molecules, its quantum efficiency for absorption of the light necessary to induce excitation of the electrons from valance to conduction band, and its effectiveness for electron transfer processes.10 Hence, the optical properties of the HLT materials synthesized here were further analyzed using UV-Vis-DRS. The UV-Vis-DRS spectra of representative materials are presented in Fig. 8 and S10 (see in ESI†). The spectra showed a redshift in the absorption maximum (or a shift to smaller band gap energy (Eg)) when the reaction temperature used to make the materials was increased from 120 to 160 °C, or when the solvothermal time was increased. For example, HLT-120-15 (the sample treated at 120 °C for 15 min) gave an Eg of 3.22 eV, but HLT-120-45 (the sample treated at 120 °C for longer reaction time of 45 h) gave lower Eg value of 3.07 eV (Fig. S10, ESI†). Thus, it can be concluded that varying the solvothermal time period can produce changes not only on the textural features but also on the optical properties of the HLT materials synthesized through the method described here. The solvothermal temperature also affected the optical properties of the materials. For example, the direct band gap energy became narrower, decreasing from 3.07 eV for HLT-120-45 to 2.98 eV for HLT-160-45 as seen in Fig. 8. Moreover, the latter material exhibited a slightly different optical behavior, with a sharp peak below 250 nm and a broad absorption band throughout the visible light range. The indirect band gap, instead of the direct band gap, was thus determined for this material, as has been done in other previous cases.43 The experiment suggested that the Eg value of HLT-200-45 was ca. 5.63 eV, which is much higher than those of HLT-120-45 and HLT-160-45. Using the formula E = hc/λ, the calculated wavelength was then found to be ca. 220 nm. Thus, the light source that should be more suitable for HLT-200-45 is UV-C lamp (100–280 nm) although its absorption tail in the visible region could further let it function under visible lights as well.

Conclusions
In this study, we reported a facile, template-free and cost-effective synthetic approach for making hierarchical macrochanneled layered titanate (HLT) materials composed of 3D interconnected “house-of-cards”-type titanate nanoflakes. The morphological evolution of the materials as a function of reaction conditions such as solvothermal duration, reaction temperature and post-synthetic treatment was investigated. The resulting novel hierarchical materials were shown to exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity for photodegradation of organic compounds for possible wastewater treatment.
