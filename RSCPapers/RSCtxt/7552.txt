    , Accepted 9th August 2021First published on 9th August 2021AbstractWe report a novel hole conductive polymer with photoactive Os(II) complexes in the side chains. This PPV derivative can be activated upon absorption of red visible light and delivers notable photocurrents when used as photocathode material. Thus, the polymer presents as a stepping stone towards developing soft matter alternatives to NiO photocathodes, which function under visible light irradiation. To show the concept we combine electrical impedance spectroscopy with steady state spectroscopy. As light-driven hole injection from Os complex to the PPV polymer is thermodynamically feasible both based on reductive quenching of photoexcited PPV and based on oxidative quenching of the photoexcited Os chromophores we investigate the impact of illumination wavelengths on the photocathode behavior and photochemical stability of the material. While both blue and red light excitation, i.e., excitation of the chromophoric units PPV and excitation of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer transitions in the side-chain pendant Os chromophores yield cathodic photocurrents, the photochemical stability is drastically enhanced upon red-light excitation. Hence, the results of the investigations discussed show the validity of the concept developing red-light sensitized hole-conducting polymers for energy conversion.
Introduction
Nature stores energy of the sun by performing photosynthesis1–4 which inspires the recent contemporary research in artificial photosynthesis. Inspired by nature, artificial photosynthesis aims at generating storable chemical energy from direct solar energy conversion, e.g. by photocatalytic splitting of water.5 A functional artificial photosynthetic system requires synergy of a range of processes such as absorption of light, transfer of energy, reduction/oxidation of a catalyst to trigger hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In reducing the practical challenges towards full photocatalytic water splitting, (dye-sensitized) photoelectrochemical cells (DS-PEC) have been introduced, in which the half-reactions of the full water splitting are separated spatially.1,2 Typical DS-PEC consists of two photoactive semiconductor electrodes, which are sensitized by molecular sensitizers to expand their absorption range into the visible spectrum and molecular photocatalysts for e.g. HER and OER.5–9
To ensure efficient light-harvesting in DS-PECs transition metal complexes are often used as photosensitizers. Prominent choices are Ru(II) and Ir(III) polypyridyl complexes, which show broad absorption in the visible range, good photo- and thermal stability, long-lived excited state, as well as versatile redox and catalytic properties.1,2,7,10–14 The high costs of Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes and their limited absorptivity towards the red part of the visible spectrum might be considered disadvantages of these systems.12,15–18Os(II) complexes, as structural analogues to their Ru(II) counterparts, offer an extended absorptivity towards the red part of the visible spectrum,19,20 which is due to an intense (formally) spin-forbidden MLCT transition.21
As benchmark material for cathodes in DS-PEC for hydrogen evolution NiO has emerged,7,8,22,23 despite the fact that its performance is limited by a high defect concentration and comparably low hole mobility.7,8 Some composite materials, for example, delafossite CuCrO2 based materials, have also been exploited in DS-PEC for hydrogen generation via co-assembly of the catalyst and dye sensitizer.24,25 Despite the prevalence of metal-oxide electrode materials, in principle alternatives from soft matter exist. Organic hole conducting organic polymers have been developed e.g. for polymer solar cells,26–31 light emitting device,32 and their application has been extended to catalysis and solar energy conversion.2,30,33–40 The chemistry of conductive polymers has also been combined with Ru(II) complexes, which have been integrated into the polymer backbones of e.g. polyfluorene, polyfluorene-co-thiophene and poly(3-hexylthiophene).12,41,42 Similarly, poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV), a semiconducting hole transport polymer revealing an energy gap close to the one of NiO,23,35,36,43–49 was side-chain functionalized with Ru(II) complexes (RuPPV) and utilized as an alternative to conventional NiO photocathodes in a proof-of-concept experiment towards HER.22 The main drawback of the reported RuPPV architecture, which was characterized in terms of their photoinduced charge-transfer dynamics,41 remains the blue absorption of the Ru(II) complexes below 520 nm. This leaves a large fraction of the solar spectrum unharvested. To avoid this scenario, this work reports on a novel PPV derivative, in which Os(II) complexes are CLICKed to the azide functionalized side chains of a PPV, yielding OsPPV (see Fig. 1). The investigated structures, i.e.PPV, [(4,4′-bis(tert-butyl)-2,2′-bipyridine)2(5-ethinyl-1,10-phenanthroline)-osmium(II)](PF6)2, Os(II) complex and OsPPV are displayed in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Structures of Os(II), PPV and OsPPV. Molecular structure of OsPPV with a molecular weight of a simple repeating unit amounts of 7650 g mol−1 in which 7.6% of all phenyl units of the polymer chain, which has an azide group, are linked to Os(II). 
This paper presents mechanistic investigations on the photophysics of OsPPV and the excitation wavelength-dependent photoelectrochemical performance of OsPPV photocathodes. Thereby, we evaluate the prospect of red-absorbing soft-matter electrodes as alternatives for the established NiO photocathodes.
Results and discussion
Ground state properties
The steady-state UV/Vis absorption and emission spectra of Os(II), PPV and OsPPV are displayed in Fig. 2. The absorption spectrum of Os(II) exhibits features below 400 nm, which are attributed to π–π*,20,50–55 while contributions of MC transition cannot be ruled out to contribute to the shoulder at 330 nm.50,51 The broad absorption band with two peaks at 445 and 500 nm stems from 1MLCT transitions.19,20,50–52,55,56 The broad and rather structureless absorption band between 550 and 700 nm is attributed to the spin-forbidden 3MLCT transition.19,20,50,51,55,56 The absorption of OsPPV, however, is dominated by the features characteristic for PPV, in particular the strong π–π* absorption band at 482 nm.48,57,58 Contributions of the Os(II) complex to the absorption of the polymer is most directly visible below 300 nm and indicated by the small absorptivity between 600 and 700 nm.20,50–52 Also the emission OsPPV, recorded upon excitation at 482 nm, is dominated by PPV features, i.e. a band centered at 505 nm accompanied by a shoulder due to vibronic progression at 590 nm.59,60 Only at wavelengths longer than 700 nm the emission spectrum of OsPPV deviates from the one of PPV indicating emission contribution of the Os(II) units. However, the emission quantum yield of OsPPV (0.19) significantly reduced compared to PPV (0.44) reflecting the influence of Os(II) on the emissive state of OsPPV. The emission yield of Os(II) was measured to 0.17, i.e. in the range available from literature.20,50,56,61–64
 Fig. 2  Steady-state absorption (solid lines), emission spectra (dashed lines) and excitation spectra (dotted lines) of Os(II) (blue, λex = 440 nm, λem = 750 nm) (A), PPV (red, λex = 482 nm, λem = 560 nm) (B) and OsPPV (black, λex = 482 nm, λem = 560 nm) (C) solution measured in chloroform (CHCl3). The absorption spectrum of OsPPV is multiplied by a factor of 50 to show the absorption contribution of Os(II) at the wavelength range of 550–700 nm. 
Characterization by cyclic voltammetry (CV) yielded the reduction/oxidation potentials of Os(II), PPV and OsPPV as summarized in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows the CVs of Os(II), PPV and OsPPV, where Os(II) was measured in solution as reference, while PPV and OsPPV were measured as films on the working electrode anticipating their use as materials in polymer photocathodes. The oxidation of Os(II) shows a reversible wave, which is assigned to the metal based oxidation of the Os3+/Os2+. The resultant reversible oxidation fits good to literature reports of Os(II) complexes.21,50,51 The CVs reveal three reduction waves for Os(II) at −1.46, −1.76 and −2.06 V vs. Fc+/Fc0. The first two represent reduction of the bpy ligand,21,50,51 while the third wave is due to reduction of the phenanthroline ligand. For PPV and OsPPV two irreversible reduction peaks are observed at −2.59 and −2.86 V and at –2.45 and −2.89 V vs. Fc+/Fc0, respectively. Oxidation of PPV within the experimentally accessed potential range is not observed. In OsPPV an irreversible oxidation peak is visible at 0.54 V vs. Fc/Fc+, reflecting oxidation of the metal center Os(II) in agreement with literature reports.41,65–68 The reduction of the Os(II) complexes is correlated to the bpy ligand based reduction.68

The potentials of reduction and oxidation from CV measurements in CHCl3 for OsPPV/PPV and in ACN for Os(II) are shown as well. Furthermore, E0–0 in V was calculated from the cross-section point of normalized absorption and emission spectra. Gibbs energy for electron and hole transfer respectively in eV with three occurring cases: (i) only Os(II) is excited, and (ii) both Os(II) and PPV are excited.

 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of Os(II) (blue, c = 1 mM) as solution, PPV (red, c = 0.3 mM) and OsPPV (black, c = 0.1 mM) as drop casted film on the WE measured in acetonitrile (ACN) with 0.1 M TBABF4 as supporting electrolyte and a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 for reduction (A) and oxidation (B). 
Based on the observed reduction and oxidation potentials and the steady state spectroscopy, we estimate the Gibbs free energy (ΔG*) for electron and hole transfer in OsPPV. Given the overlapping absorption spectra of the complex and the polymer backbone, we estimate ΔG* values for two different scenarios (Table 1): (i) optical excitation of only Os(II), and (II) excitation of both Os(II) and a neighboring chromophoric unit in PPV, which might become feasible at high photon fluxes. The hole transfer from the complex to a chromophoric unit of the PPV-backbone under scenario (II) yields Gibbs free energy  of −2.19 eV, indicating thermodynamically feasibility of the process. On the other hand,  for scenario (i) is nearly zero. Hence, excitation of the Os(II) chromophore in OsPPV would lead to hole injection with – at best – only very low driving force since the photoelectrochemical tests of OsPPV exhibit cathodic photocurrent under red light illumination which is representative of scenario (i) (vide infra).
Photoelectrochemical performance by chopped-light voltammetry
Drop-casted OsPPV photocathodes were assessed photoelectrochemically by chopped-light voltammetry (CLV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The behavior of the OsPPV electrode was compared to a drop-casted PPV only electrode upon single-wavelength at 365, 405, 450 and 530 nm as well as upon white light irradiation in the range between 400 and 800 nm.

Fig. 4 shows the photocurrent density of the OsPPV photocathode upon 627 nm irradiation to exemplify the scenario, in which light absorption in the polymer is dominated by the weak absorption of the Os(II) chromophores. Cathodic photocurrents observed upon different irradiation conditions are summarized in Fig. S6 of the ESI.†Table 2 compares the experimental photocurrents of OsPPV and PPV obtained from the CLV measurements at different irradiation wavelengths. The photocurrent of OsPPV is more pronounced than in PPV but decays during the measurement time of 10 min. For compared to the PPV electrode, for which only a low but rather stable photocurrent is observed. The photocurrent densities are calculated by normalization of the photocurrent to the absorbance at the excitation wavelength and the film area. The peak photocurrent densities of OsPPV and PPV upon excitation at 627 nm at 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl amount to 7.13 and 0.64 μA cm−2 A627nm−1, respectively. Consistently, also CLV reveals a higher photocurrent density for OsPPV (3.18 μA cm−2 A627nm−1) compared to PPV (0.31 μA cm−2 A627nm−1). The increased cathodic photocurrent for OsPPV reflects the increased absorptivity of OsPPV due to direct excitation of the 3MLCT transitions in the Os-chromophores.

The CLV was carried out by applying a potential 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The obtained photocurrent was normalized to the film area to give photocurrent density.

Irradiation of OsPPV and PPV cathodes at 405, 450 and 530 nm as well as by white light yields similar cathodic photocurrent densities (see Fig. S7, ESI†), while very low photocurrents are observed upon irradiation at 365 nm. This observation correlates to the absorption spectra of both OsPPV and PPV (Fig. 4C): The highest photocurrent was observed for illumination at 405 nm, i.e., not in the maximum of the absorption spectrum. This indicates that not a single process determines the macroscopic photocurrent observed, but rather an interplay of hole injection from photoexcited Os(II) chromophors or to photoexcited chromophoric units of the PPV (cathodic contributions). Upon excitation at 627 nm the photocurrents observed for OsPPV solely stem from photoexcited Os(II) complexes. This scenario causes significant photocurrent densities compared to PPV.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) scales with the absorption spectrum of OsPPV. As the IPCE is a product of light harvesting efficiency (LHE), the charge injection efficiency (ηinj) from the photoexcited Os(II) to PPV, and the charge collection efficiency (ηcc), it is clear that the IPCE of 14.7% upon 450 nm excitation is the highest because also the LHE peaks at this wavelength. To gain insight on the intrinsic light-conversion efficiency, which is equal to the internal quantum efficiency, the absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE) is calculated and summarized in Table 2. The APCE of OsPPV indicates that excitation of both the photoactive PPV backbone and Os(II) sensitizer yields APCE of 65.5%. On the contrary, an APCE of 25.5% is obtained by selective excitation of the Os(II) complex. Compared to conventional dye-sensitized NiO photocathodes, the IPCE as well as the APCE of the OsPPV photocathode is on par with a 200 nm thick dye sensitized PS-b-P2VP templated NiO photocathode.71 In such scenario a maximum IPCE and APCE of 13% and 70% were reported.71 Specifically, Gibson and co-workers compared different architectures for molecularly functionalized NiO photocathodes.71 In their comparative work, they showed that typical APCE values for NiO photocathodes with thickness ranging from 0.8 to 5 μm are in the range 23 to 40%.71 Thus, the comparably high APCE for OsPPV, despite the low concentration of Os(II) complex in the polymer, reflects the promising performance of the polymer photoelectrode and provides a solid basis for further optimization of the dye loading on PPV backbone.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the OsPPV films with respect to the slow charge transfer kinetics and charge recombination, i.e., the recombination reaction between holes on the PPV reduced species in the electrolyte, which serves as a redox mediator. Furthermore, the photostability of both the polymer films is studied by irradiation-wavelength dependent EIS.

Fig. 5 exemplifies the impedance response of OsPPV both in the dark and upon irradiation at 627 nm: irradiation slightly affects the frequency response as visible in the Bode Plot and the second semi-circle in the Nyquist Plot at low frequencies. Since OsPPV film is the only photoactive component in the system, the results reflect that the frequency response at >10 kHz and below 1 kHz stems from the charge transfer at the counter (TCO|Pt|electrolyte) and working electrode (TCO|OsPPV|electrolyte), respectively. As we are interested in the charge transfer processes at the OsPPV cathode, we will focus the analysis to the EIS data recorded at lower frequencies.
 Fig. 5  (A and B) Bode Plot (C) and (D) Nyquist Plot of EIS experiment for OsPPV film measured in three dark (A and C) and light cycles (B and D) with a LED of UV light (λLED = 627 nm, intensity of 800 W m−2 FWHM = 86 eV). 
The EIS data is analyzed by an equivalent circuit model consisting of two modified Randle circuits, i.e., a parallel connection of resistance and a pseudo capacitance. The hole mobility (μ) and the time constant for recombination between photo-injected hole and reduced species in electrolyte (τ) are calculated as follows:72  and  where δ represents the film thickness (cm), V the applied voltage (Volt), R the charge transfer resistance (Ohm), Q the pseudo capacitance (F) and α is the non-ideality factor.
The impedance analysis is in good agreement with the photocurrent response obtained from CLV, i.e., photoinduced hole injection occurs irrespective of the excitation wavelength. For OsPPV, it is shown that the hole mobility of PPV is dependent to the irradiation wavelength (see ESI,† Fig. S8–S18) which spans between 5.07 × 10−5 and 1.04 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The wavelength dependency of the hole mobility is proportional to the absorption spectrum of PPV. Irradiation at 450 nm excites 1MLCT of both PPV and Os(II) and leads to high hole mobility as the photogenerated hole roots not only from photoinjected hole but also the hole from oxidized PPV. In addition, this excitation also leads to highest time constant for recombination compared to other excitation wavelengths indicating a lower probability for recombination between the hole and the reduced species. Upon irradiation at 627 nm where only the 7.6% loading of Os(II) in OsPPV are excited at this wavelength the hole mobility is found the lowest of 5.07 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Nonetheless, the recombination time constant of OsPPV upon irradiation at 627 nm is considerably higher (3.2 ms) among other excitation wavelengths.
Furthermore, the EIS data indicate the limited photostability of PPV backbone under irradiation. Upon irradiation at 450 nm the hole mobility in pristine PPV decreases by 77% after only three cycles of irradiation, indicating that only 23% of the PPV retain structural integrity and contribute to hole transport in the polymer. However, upon excitation at 627 nm, i.e., in a spectral region, in which PPV itself does not absorb and, hence, no photooxidation takes place, the hole mobility decreases by less than 1% under otherwise identical conditions.

Table 3 puts the performance data of the OsPPV photocathode into the context of other systems available from literature.8,22,69,71 Compared to conventionally used dye-sensitized NiO photocathodes the resulting current density in OsPPV is lower (2.46 vs. 120 μA cm−2). However, it is somewhat comparable to the current density yielded from the organic push–pull P1 dye-sensitized NiO photocathodes.71 Compared to the previously introduced RuPPV electrode22 the performance of OsPPV can be considered promising as it produces approximately half of the current density under red-light irradiation (80 mW cm−2 ≈ 1 sun). By working under red-light irradiation OsPPV biases the main drawback of RuPPV system, i.e., its limited photostability due to photodegration of the PPV under blue-light irradiation. For RuPPV this degradation led to a drop in photocurrent generation by 35% within only 10 min of illumination.22 For OsPPV under red-light excitation not only the photocurrent increases but also the integrity of the PPV is maintained. Future developing OsPPV might target a device architecture developed by Schuhmann and co-workers for biophotocathodes.73 Despite the complexity of their system,71 the Os complex sensitized poly(4-vinylpyridine-co-butylmethacrylate) (P4VPcoBMA) in combination with photosystem 1 and poly(ethylene glycol)diglycidyl ether could produce a stable photocurrent density up to 70 μA cm−2 even with irradiation wavelength of >600 nm.73

Conclusions
This study presents a proof-of-concept for a red-light sensitized hole-conducting polymer for energy conversion, particularly as a steppingstone to developing polymer-based substitutes for metal-oxide photocathode materials. Photoactive Osmium phenanthroline complexes are linked to the side chains of a PPV polymer enabling photoexcitation of the system by red light. While such excitation conditions yield photocurrents and IPCE in the range of 3 μA cm−2 A627nm−1 and 1.4%, respectively, it avoids the strong photo degradation of the PPV backbone, which is observed upon excitation of the system with blue or green light. Photooxidation of PPV is suppressed under irradiation at 627 nm and it maintains >99% of electronic mobility after three cycles of irradiation (vs. mobility decreases by 71% for irradiation at 450 nm). The OsPPV based photocathodes can generate the highest photocurrent density under irradiation at red wavelength compared to other irradiation wavelengths because this irradiation condition allows only hole injection process to occur while other irradiations at higher energy leads to a competition between hole and electron injection process at the Os(II)–PPV interface. Despite the success of the embodiment of soft-matter based photocathode, studies accommodating the possible replacement of a more photostable hole transport polymer or using organic photosensitizers to yield high performing noble-metal free sensitizer-polymer based photocathodes will be a future challenge.

Steady state spectroscopy
Absorption experiments were recorded in a quartz cell with a path length of 1 cm on a JASCO V780 UV-Visible/NIR spectrophotometer. The software used of UV/Vis absorption spectra was SpectraMeasurement-V-780, using a wavelength range from 250 nm to 800 nm and recording the baseline with the pure solvent for all measurements. The emission and excitation spectra were measured in a quartz cell with a path length of 1 cm using an FLS980 photoluminescence spectrometer (Edinburg-Instrument). The software used for emission experiment was F980 (Version 1.4.4). For the emission measurements an excitation wavelength of 482 nm (for PPV and OsPPV) was used. For the excitation experiments, an emission wavelength at 560 nm (for PPV and OsPPV) was applied, which was derived from the emission maxima.
UV/Vis spectroelectrochemistry (SEC)
The experiments for the UV/Vis-SEC measurements were carried out in an electrochemical cell with a three-electrode setup. This setup consists of a PET/ITO as WE, a Pt as CE and an Ag/AgCl as RE and the cell was filled with 0.1 M recrystallized TBABF4 in CHCl3. A potentiostat BioLogic SP50 (Science Instruments) was used to apply the redox potentials for the UV/Vis-SEC data. During the UV/Vis-SEC measurements absorption spectra were recorded with the PET/ITO WE with a diode array spectrometer for UV/Vis range SPECORD S600 (Analytik Jena) with the light source of a halogen and deuterium lamp. The parameters for UV/Vis-SEC experiments were an OCP of 30 s followed by applying the determined potentials for 2 min. Afterwards, the OCP of 30 s was measured again to ensure reversibility of the sample. The used software for UV/Vis-SEC measurements was EC-lab V11.26, in the case of the absorption spectra, WinASPECT.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
The CV measurements were performed in a three-electrode setup. This setup consisted of a disk glassy carbon as WE, Pt wire as CE and Ag wire as RE and the PPV/OsPPV solution in CHCl3 was drop casted (20 μL) as film on a disk glassy carbon WE. As supporting electrolyte was used a 0.1 M TBABF4 dissolved in dry and degassed ACN. The CV experiments were performed on a VersaSTAT 3 potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research) with different scan rates and 3 cycles for each measurement. Electrochemical data of Os(II) were obtained by CV using a conventional single-compartment three-electrode cell arrangement in combination with a CH Instruments CHI 620E electrochemical workstation. A Pt wire was used as the auxiliary electrode, a silver wire as the reference electrode and a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode. The measurements were carried out in anhydrous and argon-saturated ACN. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte at ambient temperature (20 ± 5 °C). All potentials are referenced to ferrocene/ferrocenium [E(Fc/Fc+) = 0.00 V].
Chopped light voltammetry (CLV)
CLV measurements were investigated in a three-electrode setup. Therefore, a 1 cm SEC cuvette was used, which became narrower towards the button with a 2 mm thin slide in the middle. The used WE consists of a polymer(Surlyn)-masked PET/ITO substrate on which the OsPPV and PPV films dissolved in CHCl3 were drop casted (30 μL, c = 0.36 mM). The area of the film amounted to 0.81 cm2, which was covered with adhesive tape. A Pt wire was used as CE and a leakless Ag/AgCl electrode as RE. After connecting the three electrodes with the respective cables to the pro-Scientific instrument from ZAHNER ZENNIUM potentiostat the electrolyte solution was filled into the cuvette. A CoII/CoIII redox couple was utilized as electrolyte solution. This redox couple contains of 0.25 M tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine) cobalt(II)di[bis (trifluoromethane)]sulfonimide, 0.06 M tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(III)-tri[bis(trifluoromethane)]-sulfonimide, 0.1 M LiTFSI and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine in dry ACN. Then the investigation of the photocurrent in chronoamperometric mode is started together with chopped light illumination. Six different LEDs were used for irradiation, which were provided by pro-Scientific instrument from ZAHNER ZENNIUM (see Table 4). The electrochemical data were recorded by the software ThalesXT5.0.16.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
The EIS was performed in two-electrode setup where the working and counter electrodes are OsPPV film on a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass and thin Pt film-coated TCO glass, respectively. OsPPV was dissolved in CHCl3 followed by drop casting (30 μL, c = 0.33 mM) on the conducting side of the TCO glass of the WE. After fixing both electrodes (TCO glass of WE and CE with RE) against each other a drop of electrolyte solution was added. The electrolyte solution consisted of 0.5 M tert-butylammoniumiodide (Roth, ≥99% p.a.), 0.1 M LiI (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 98%, under argon), 0.1 M I2 (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent, ≥99.8%) and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich, 96%). Each film was measured in three dark and irradiation cycles. Three films were made for each LED to ensure reproducibility. In total, six different LEDs (see CLV) were used to investigate the different behavior of the film at different irradiation wavelengths. The LEDs were controlled by a pro-Scientific instrument from ZAHNER ZENNIUM. Each sample was irradiated for 5 min at the specific LED, then the impedance response was measured by a VersaSTAT 3 potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research). The impedance was then investigated in the dark followed by 5 min of irradiation. These cycles were repeated three times.
