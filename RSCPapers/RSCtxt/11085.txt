    , Accepted 17th October 2012First published on 17th October 2012AbstractZnSnO3, as an anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), was investigated for the first time with structures ranging from unique ZnSnO3 nanocubes (ZSCs) to ZnSnO3 nanosheets (ZSSs). These structures were synthesized by a dual-hydrolysis-assisted liquid precipitation reaction and subsequent hydrothermal route. After calcination of the precursors, both formed two types of regular ZnSnO3 mesocrystal. Both mesocrystals showed almost the same capacity at the initial cycle, which agreed with the theoretical value of 1320 mA h g−1. However, they exhibited different cycle abilities and rate performances. The capacity of the ZSSs decayed slowly over the first 12 cycles and no obvious degradation was observed after then. However, the capacity of the ZSCs decayed more quickly. After 50 cycles, the capacity of the ZSSs had only decreased by 38.4%, in contrast to a decrease of 77.5% for the capacity of the ZSCs. The different performances of the same material can be related to the differences in phase and exposed facets.
1. Introduction
As the field of nanotechnology evolves, particle configuration is becoming as important as size in determining the chemical and physical properties of a nanostructure.1 A variety of nanostructures with well-defined shapes have been synthesized to improve their properties.2–4 Besides the shape and size of a particle, the surface engineering of nanocrystals has attracted considerable attention in materials science because the properties of a material are strongly dependent on its surface atomic structures.5–7 In the past few years, extensive studies on the structure of facets mostly focused on anatase TiO2 crystals, which are usually dominated by {101} facets due to their low surface energy.8–10 Recently, much progress has been made in producing other materials with particular facets exposed in order to enhance their properties, such as BiVO4 nanoplates with exposed {100} facets,11 cubic gold nanocrystals enclosed by {720} facets,12 and Ag3PO4 sub-microcrystals bounded by {110}/{100} facets.13 Thus, the fabrication of nanomaterials with only highly reactive facets exposed is very promising and significant. Complex metal oxides are important functional materials that exhibit a wide range of chemical and physical properties. But the surface control of these oxides with the desired facet exposure is still a big challenge.
Zinc stannate, a multifunctional ternary metal oxide material, exists as two types of oxide with different Zn/Sn/O ratios (ZnSnO3 and Zn2SnO4), which have potential applications in lead-free ferroelectics,14 transparent conductors,15 photocatalysts,16 dye-sensitized solar cells,17 gas sensors,18 and lithium ion batteries (LIBs).19,20 In recent years, it has been found that some stannates, such as CoSnO3 and CaSnO3,21,22 display impressive electrochemical performances as anode materials for LIBs. However, the electrochemical behavior of ZnSnO3 with a high theoretical capacity has been studied little, except for some rare instances.23 Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate the potential application of ZnSnO3 in LIBs. Various ZnSnO3 micro/nanostructures have been prepared previously via various routes, including a solid-state reaction under high pressure,14 a co-precipitation method,24 low-temperature ion exchange,25 and hydrothermal reaction.26 For instance, ZnSnO3 ultra-thin nanorods have been synthesized by a fast and facile template route.27 Hu et al. synthesized cubic ZnSnO3 microcrystals on a large scale via a one-step chemical solution route.28 Recently, hollow ZnSnO3 fibers were also fabricated using cotton as a biotemplate.29 The ZnSnO3 nanocrystals reported are mostly one-dimensional (1D) or three-dimensional (3D) structures. To the best of our knowledge, however, the synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) plate-like nanostructures has been rarely reported.
In this study, we have synthesized ZnSnO3 precursors with two kinds of shapes via a dual-hydrolysis-assisted liquid precipitation reaction and subsequent hydrothermal treatment. Cubic nanostructures could be obtained by the first step. After the hydrothermal treatment, the nanocubes could be completely transformed to 2D sheet-like structures. After calcination of the precursors, the products were converted into ZnSnO3 mesocrystals with two different crystalline phases, preserving their original morphologies. We have also discussed the impact of the solvent and the hydrothermal temperature on the morphology. It is interesting that the ZSSs showed more obvious excellent electrochemical properties than the ZSCs in LIB tests. We ascribed the electrochemical results to their different phases and exposed surfaces which resulted in the formation of different channels for Li-ion insertion, indicating the potential applications of ZnSnO3 in high-performance LIBs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials synthesis
The reagents used in the study were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China) and all the chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without any purification process. The water was Millipore Milli-Q grade with a resistivity greater than 18 MΩ cm−1.
The cube-like precursors were synthesized by using the dual-hydrolysis-assisted solution process and the sheet-like precursors were synthesized by using the dual-hydrolysis-assisted solution process and subsequent hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis, 0.534 g of Na2SnO3·3H2O and 0.439 g of Zn(CH3COO)2·3H2O were each dissolved in 20 mL of an ethylene glycol (EG)–deionized water mixture (5 mL EG and 15 mL deionized water) to obtain aqueous solutions. Then, the Na2SnO3 solution was added dropwise to the Zn(CH3COO)2 solution under magnetic stirring and a white suspension was immediately produced. Then the suspension was centrifuged, washed several times with distilled water and dried under vacuum. Thus the cube-like precursor was obtained. In the other experiment, hydrothermal treatment of the above prepared white suspension followed. The suspension was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 12 h, followed by cooling, centrifugation, and drying under vacuum, and then the sheet-like precursor was obtained. The dried precursors were finally calcined in air at 500 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2.8 °C min−1. To investigate the growth process, intermediate products were collected at reaction times of 10 min, 4 h, 8 h and 12 h.
2.2. Material characterization
The morphology and microstructures of the synthesized samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi, S-4800) and the crystal structures of the products were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Dmax-2500) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 250 mA, 8° min−1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were recorded on a JEOL2010 electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded using a WQF-410 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (Beijing Secondary Optical Instruments, China).
2.3. Electrochemical testing of battery performance
The electrochemical properties of the samples were evaluated using CR2016-type coin cells. The active materials were mixed with carbon black and carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) in a weight ratio of 80:10:10 with water as a dispersant. The mass of the active material on each anode was ca. 1.0 mg. Pure lithium foils were used as the counter electrodes. A Celgard 2400 microporous polypropylene membrane was used as a separator. The electrolyte consisted of a solution of 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate–diethyl carbonate (1:1:1 by wt%). CR2016 coin-type cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with water and oxygen contents of less than 1 ppm. The discharge and charge measurements were carried out on an Arbin BT2000 system with cut off potentials of 0.01 V for discharge and 3 V for charge. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) experiments also took place at room temperature on the Arbin battery test system at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and morphological characterization
To trace the composition of the precursors and the formation history of the ZnSnO3 during calcination, FTIR investigations were carried out, and the spectra are shown in Fig. 1. The band at ∼3220 cm−1 is attributed to the bending and stretching vibration modes of the OH group in ZnSn(OH)6. The four bands at 538, 775, 1178, and ∼2336 cm−1 arise from the vibration of the M–OH or M–OH–M groups in ZnSn(OH)6. The peak at 1540 cm−1, which disappeared after calcination, is ascribed to the vibration of absorptive water.30,31 The bands observed at ∼584 and 1110 cm−1 are assigned to the vibrations of the M–O or M–O–M groups in the ZnSnO3; the peaks of the hydroxyl groups in the precursor had almost diminished after calcination, while the peaks assigned to the formation of metal–oxygen bonds at about 550–670 cm−1 became strong. Besides, in curve b there are two weak peaks at 584 and 1110 cm−1 (marked by the dark ellipses). This means that a small amount of ZnSnO3 could have been formed after hydrothermal treatment which is consistent with the XRD results as seen later.

The crystallinity and phase information were confirmed by XRD measurements, as shown in Fig. 2. The upper curve in Fig. 2A shows the diffraction reflections for the cube-like precursors obtained by the direct dual-hydrolysis-assisted reaction. It is indexed to the standard ZnSn(OH)6 phase (JCPDS card, no. 20-1445); no peaks from other phases can be detected, indicating high purity. After calcination, all of the diffraction peaks (lower curve) were attributed to cubic phase ZnSnO3 (JCPDS card, no. 11-0274), which is consistent with the above FTIR results, manifesting the complete disappearance of the hydroxyl groups. Fig. 2B shows the XRD patterns of the products after additional hydrothermal treatment. The main peaks (upper curve) of the precursors are assigned to the ZnSn(OH)6 phase (JCPDS card, no. 20-1445), but there are also some residual peaks at 2θ = 33.95°, 60.53°, 65.15° and 66.35° which belong to the ZnSnO3 phase (JCPDS card, no. 28-1486), indicating a partial transformation of the ZnSn(OH)6 phase into the ZnSnO3 phase. After calcination, the peaks can all be ascribed to the ZnSnO3 phase. The diffraction patterns (between the first reflection and a reflection close to 2θ = 60°) show clearly a change in the relative intensities compared with the JCPDS card, which results from the particle morphology and their preferred orientation. Such a case is similar to previously published papers.32

Typical SEM, TEM and HRTEM images provide insight into the morphologies and structures of the products obtained after calcination of the two precursors at 500 °C. As shown in Fig. 3a, large-scale monodisperse cubic crystallites can be observed. Furthermore, the cubes were transformed into nanosheets after hydrothermal treatment (Fig. 3b). The magnified SEM images (the insets of Fig. 3a and b) and Fig. S2† reveal the detailed morphologies and structures, showing that the cubic crystallites had an edge size of 50–100 nm while the nanosheets possessed thicknesses in the range of 25–35 nm, with rough surfaces. The morphologies and sizes of these crystallites were very similar to those of their precursors. This proves that the heating process has little influence on the morphology.

TEM provides further insight into the microstructural details of the products. Fig. 4a and b reveal uniform cubic and sheet-like ZnSnO3 structures, which agree well with the SEM results. The magnified TEM images of an individual cube and an individual sheet are shown in Fig. 4c and e, respectively. Fig. 4d clearly represents the HRTEM image taken from a part of the single cube (Fig. 4c), which shows a pair of visible lattice fringes that are perpendicular to each other. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Fig. 4d) exhibits periodic diffraction spots, which demonstrates the single-crystalline nature. Combined with the TEM image in Fig. 4c, this shows that it is a typical mesocrystal. Its characteristics are consistent with those of a mesocrystal,33,34 implying that the particles were comprised of many small crystals which were attached to each other in the same orientation. The HRTEM image of the ZSSs in Fig. 4f shows two sets of lattices and the interplanar distances are 0.259 and 0.265 nm. The SAED pattern (inset in Fig. 4f) demonstrates the single-crystalline nature. Combined with its TEM image in Fig. 4e, this shows that it is a typical mesocrystal. The final morphology of the nanomaterials is determined not only by thermodynamics but also by kinetics.35 In this study, it was found that the volume ratio of solvent/water and the reaction temperature played crucial roles in determining the morphologies of the final products.

3.2. Growth analysis and formation mechanism

Fig. 5 displays the morphologies of the crystals obtained from the mixed solution with different volume ratios of water to EG. When no EG was added (Fig. 5a), there were a lot of irregular cubic nanoparticles with a small number of sheet-like shapes present in the product. When the ratio of water to EG was adjusted to 20:20 (Fig. 5b), monodisperse nanosheets with much greater thicknesses were clearly observed. When the ratio was further adjusted to 10:30 (Fig. 5c), nanosheets and some nanoparticles coexisted in the product. If the solution contained no water, the morphology would be irregular (Fig. 5d). According to the experimental results, we propose that the EG solvent acted as a structure-directing reagent.36 During the process, it could adsorb on two surfaces of the nanoparticle as a surfactant and played the role of capping agent, suppressing the growth rate of two planes. As a result, the edge of the nanosheet covered with the fewest EG molecules grew fastest and nanosheets were formed. In addition, it should be noted that the concentration of EG could affect the quality of the sheets, indicating that an important role was played by water. As water and EG were added together, the water molecules would preferentially bind to the EG molecules and the resultant dielectric constant would decrease, facilitating stronger electrostatic interactions between the charged segments in the molecules.37 Murray et al. reported that a decrease in the water content in a mixed solvent resulted in an increase in the number of particles.38 Furthermore, a water molecule is quite small and can be easily polarized, which effectively stabilizes the ions in the solution in hydrogen-bonding type interactions, resulting in the low reactivity of the reactant.39 Thus, the increase of EG in the mixed solvent enhances the reactivity of the ions. However, the number of nucleation particles also increases and the reactant becomes more reactive with increasing EG content. This makes it impossible for the particles to age. So the particles aggregated and formed irregular crystal morphologies. Thereby, with an optimum volume ratio of water to EG, the nucleation particles can be driven into a uniform morphology with a favourable size. This process is thermodynamically favourable because the surface energy and the total energy of the system are substantially reduced when the interfaces are eliminated.40

We also investigated the influence of temperature on the morphology using a volume ratio of H2O–EG of 30:10. As shown in Fig. 5e and f, no sheets or only a few nanosheets were produced as the temperature decreased to 150 °C or increased above 210 °C. The reaction temperature not only affected the nucleation of the particles but also led to different dynamic processes forming different morphologies. A lower temperature resulted in a lower cleavage rate and driving force to make EG reduce the growth rate of two planes. Although a higher temperature provided a higher energy, the speed of nucleation and growth was greatly accelerated. However, there was less time for the position of EG on the surface of the nanocrystals to be adjusted before the binding occurred. Thus, this led to the aggregation of the particles and a small number of sheet-like shapes.
To elucidate the possible process of transition from nanocubes to nanosheets, the hydrothermal time-dependent reaction was terminated at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h, and the corresponding material morphologies are shown in Fig. 6. Uniform cubic nanostructures with an edge size of 50–100 nm could be observed before hydrothermal treatment. When the reaction time reached 4 h, there was a large number of cleavage fragments on the surface. When the reaction time was increased to 8 h, the cubic structures evolved into nanosheets, accompanied by many irregular nanoparticles. After reaction for 12 h, the small particles completely disappeared and formed nanosheets. In addition, it was clearly seen from the SEM images that the sample morphology evolved from cubes to nanosheets. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible morphological evolution mechanism of the products from cubes to nanosheets was elucidated, as shown in Scheme 1. There are four stages in the formation of the nanosheets: (1) in the initial stage, due to the dual-hydrolysis-assisted liquid precipitation reaction, H2SnO3 and Zn(OH)42− are largely and easily produced to form cube-shaped ZnSn(OH)6 crystals; (2) under specific hydrothermal conditions, the metastable ZnSn(OH)6 cubes dissolve and recrystallize to form irregular flakes with increasing temperature and pressure in the presence of EG, according to the “dissolution-recrystallization” mechanism;41,42 (3) at longer reaction times, the flake units assemble into larger nanosheets, which is related to the “further growth” process, and perfect and uniform nanosheet structures are formed.

3.3. Electrochemical performance
A series of electrochemical measurements were carried out in order to study the lithium storage behaviours of the ZSCs and ZSSs. CV profiles of the batteries were characterized at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 over a voltage range of 0.01–3.00 V versus Li/Li+, as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b). On the basis of the lithium storage mechanism of ZnO and SnO2,43,44 we propose a lithium insertion mechanism of ZnSnO3 particles, as follows: 4Li+ + ZnSnO3 + 4e− → Sn + 2Li2O + ZnO(1) 6Li+ + ZnSnO3 + 6e− → Zn + Sn + 3Li2O(2) xLi+ + Sn + xe− ↔ LixSn, x ≤ 4.4(3) yLi+ + Zn + ye− ↔ LiyZn, y ≤ 1(4)

In the first cycle for ZSCs (Fig. 7a), there is an inconspicuous cathodic peak centred at 1.34 V, which disappeared in subsequent cycles. It may be due to a small amount of inserted lithium in the crystal structure of ZnSnO3 to form LixZnSnO3.45 As reported in the literature, the amount of inserted lithium (the value of x) is related to the particle size. For example, 1 mol of Li can be inserted into nanometer-sized particles, while only 0.03 mol of Li can be inserted into submicrometer-sized particles.46 Another two peaks located near 0.69 V and 0.05 V correspond to the multistep electrochemical lithiation process with the decomposition of ZnSnO3 (eqn (1) and (2)) and the formation of alloys (eqn (3) and (4)). Meanwhile, the anodic peak at 0.68 V corresponds to the dealloying reaction and a broad anodic peak at ∼1.4 V is attributed to the oxidation of Sn (∼1.3 V)47 and Zn (∼1.5 V).48 In the second and subsequent cycles, the peak at 0.69 V shifts to 0.8 V. The two redox couples indexed as 0.05/0.68 V and 0.78/1.4 V appeared due to the alloying/dealloying process and the formation/decomposition of Li2O. Cyclic voltammogram profiles of the ZSSs batteries are displayed in Fig. 7b. It was found that the potential of their cathodic and anodic peaks were similar to those of the ZSCs. But the peak current and the integrated area of the ZSCs peak decreased more quickly than those of the ZSSs, suggesting more capacity loss in the ZSCs. Due to hysteresis in the CV technique, the voltage value of the cathodic peak is shifted in the negative direction, and the anodic peak is positively shifted compared to the voltages of the charge–discharge plateaus.49Fig. 7c and d show that the potential plateaus are almost the same and located at ∼0.8/1.35 V and ∼0.75/1.3 V in the first discharge–charge process, respectively. The discharge capacity of the ZSCs in the first cycle is 1370 mA h g−1, which is a little lower than that of the ZSSs (1390 mA h g−1). However, the charge capacity of the ZSCs (805 mA h g−1) is obviously lower than that of the ZSSs (1010 mA h g−1) and their initial Coulombic efficiencies are 58.7% and 72.7%, respectively. Furthermore, in subsequent cycles, the capacity loss of the ZSCs is apparently larger than that of the ZSSs.

Fig. 8 compares the cyclability and coulomb efficiencies of the ZSCs and ZSSs at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Although the discharge capacity of both materials is almost equal in the first cycle, the ZSS cell exhibited less initial irreversible loss than the ZSCs cell (27.3% vs 41.3%). These losses are both lower than those for SnO2 or ZnO anode materials of Li-ion batteries. It was observed that the capacity of the ZSSs electrode decayed slowly over the first 12 cycles and no obvious degradation was observed after that. However, the capacity of the ZSCs electrode exhibited a much quicker decay. After 50 cycles, the capacity of the ZSSs electrode decreased by 38.4%, in contrast to a decrease of 77.5% for the capacity of the ZSCs electrode. The theoretical value of the reversible capacity was calculated to be about 623.7 mA h g−1 from the maximum uptake of ZnSnO3 (x = 5.4) based on eqn (3) and (4). The capacity of the ZSSs was higher than the theoretical value (625 mA h g−1), even after 50 cycles.

In addition, the ZSSs exhibited a better cycle ability and a better rate capability than the ZSCs. As shown in Fig. 9 (the first cycle for both curves is omitted), the ZSSs exhibited rather good rate capability with an average discharge of 1241 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.05 A g−1, 991 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 665 mA h g−1 at 0.4 A g−1, 440 mA h g−1 at 0.8 A g−1, 314 mA h g−1 at 1.2 A g−1, and 680 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. The ZSCs exhibited limited discharge capacities of 948, 721, 388, 181 and 54 mA h g−1 at the respective rates. After the current density had returned to 0.1 A g−1, the ZSSs delivered a capacity of 690 mA h g−1, while the ZSCs showed a capacity of 368 mA h g−1. These results indicate that the ZSSs obtained from hydrothermal treatment are very promising as an anode material for LIBs.

The particle size, morphology, and crystallinity have a great influence on the cyclic stability.50–52 The differences in electrochemical performance between the same materials with two different crystal structures could be ascribed to their different phases and surface exposures which result in different channels for Li-ion insertion. Lou et al. reported that largely exposed reactive (001) facets on the TiO2 surface could provide more channels along the c-direction to facilitate Li+ ion insertion/extraction.53 Although both of the structures are now known due to our present work, we think that the exposed facets might play crucial roles in determining their electrochemical behavior in lithium storage on a large scale. Further study needs to be done in our future work.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a simple dual-hydrolysis-assisted liquid precipitation reaction and subsequent hydrothermal route have been developed for the synthesis of 3D ZSCs and peculiar 2D ZSSs as a result of the transition of 3D nanocubes on a large scale. The volume ratio of water to EG and the hydrothermal synthesis temperature were the key parameters in the conversion of ZnSnO3 from 3D nanocubes to 2D nanosheets. A possible growth mechanism for the formation of the sheet-like structures was elucidated. When evaluated for lithium storage capabilities, the as-prepared ZSSs exhibited better electrochemical performance than the ZSCs, which could be attributed to their different phases and exposed reactive surfaces that may result in distinct Li+ conveying passageways. On the other hand, the ZSSs may be more in favour of the release of the stress caused by the drastic volume expansion due to their relatively stable structures and low surface energies obtained by hydrothermal treatment. The work implies that these interesting ZnSnO3 nanostructures are very promising as anode materials for high power and high energy LIBs.
