1. Introduction
Transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have attracted considerable attention in many fields over the past decade due to their unique structure/composite-dependent properties;1–6 especially, they have been demonstrated to have great potential applications in energy storage and conversion with high energy and power densities.7–20 Among them, zinc chalcogenides (ZCs) have unique characteristics with high theoretical capacities, low operation voltages, or Earth-abundance, cheaper production costs and non-toxicity, which have been widely studied in solar cells, electrochemical catalysis, electrochemical capacitors, and various batteries.21–27 Zinc chalcogenides (ZnX, X = S, Se, Te) are an appropriate alternative for advanced rechargeable batteries, partly because, taking advanced Li-ion batteries as an example, the constituent element Zn has a smaller volume change (∼71%) than other Li-alloying metals (Si: ∼270%, Ge: ∼240%, Sn: ∼255%) along with a high theoretical capacity of ca. 410 mA h g−1 (ca. 2927 mA h cm−3) and low working potential (e.g., ∼0.4 V vs. Li/Li+), while the chalcogen group of elements (e.g., S, Se, Te) can also alloy with Li to form Li2S, Li2Se, or Li2Te, exhibiting a high theoretical capacity of 1672, 678, or ca. 420 mA h g−1, respectively.24,28–30 Notably, these ZCs all have superior high volumetric capacity due to the high density of ZnO (5.61 g cm−3), ZnS (4.09 g cm−3), ZnSe (5.27 g cm−3), and ZnTe (6.34 g cm−3).24 And specifically, zinc selenide and telluride (ZnSe/ZnTe) are of particular interest as they possess high theoretical volumetric capacities, higher electric conductivities (viz. a more obvious metallic property), larger ion-insertion interstitial sizes, and weaker ionic bonds compared with ZnS/ZnO, although selenium (or tellurium) is somewhat more toxic and expensive than sulfur.23,28,31–33
In the past several years, there has been an increasing trend in studying ZCs as potential anodes with high capacities or enhanced rate performances for next-generation alkali–metal-ion (i.e., Li, Na, K-ion) batteries.23,25,34,35 Although they have high theoretical capacities, the large volume expansions, relatively low electron conductivities, side reactions, and shuttle effects of polysulfides or polyselenides will result in severe capacity loss, poor reversibility, or low utilization of active materials.18,36,37 Much effort has been devoted to alleviating these problems and considerable achievements have been made by enhancing the conductivity of the material via the formation of hybrids/composites, optimizing the desirable nanostructures, electrode design, and electrolyte content, tuning the cut-off voltage windows etc.23,25,36
Presently, there are some reviews involving the topics on transition-metal chalcogenides for energy storage and conversion; however, a timely and systematical review on semiconducting ZCs for energy storage is highly desirable.23,25,36 In this review, we focus on overviewing the development of ZnSe/ZnTe-based electrodes in synthesis/fabrication methods and applications in Li/Na/K-ion batteries. The strategies for improving the performance of electrode materials are summarized. Moreover, challenges in electrode design and mechanism investigation are also suggested. Finally, the opportunities are also pointed out.
2. Electrochemical storage mechanisms
As a family of high-capacity anode materials for potential advanced Li-ion batteries, for example, investigation of the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of ZCs is vital for the rational design of electrodes and optimization of performance. It is well known that the TMCs generally undergo a combination of intercalation–conversion–alloying (M = Sn, Sb), or intercalation–conversion (M = Mo, W, Fe, Co, Ni), or merely intercalation (M = Nb) reactions during the charge/discharge process, i.e., dependent on the groups of transition metals.36 The conversion-type TMCs based on a multi-electron transfer process can easily accommodate more Li ions to yield specific capacities two to four times higher than those of intercalation-type TMCs, which is appealing for the production of high-energy rechargeable batteries. Moreover, compared with the M–O bonds in oxides, M–S, M–Se and M–Te bonds are gradually weaker, which is kinetically favorable for conversion reactions during the charge/discharge process.18,31,36,38,39 The lithiation/delithiation mechanisms examined by ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses reveal that the ZnS finally converts into LiZn and Li2S during lithiation, and subsequently incompletely recombines into ZnS during delithiation, thus resulting in traces of Zn and S;22,40 similar electrochemical conversion/partial recombination reactions also exist between ZnTe and Li, leaving a small amount of Te after the recombination of ZnTe.24 For ZnSe, the lithiation–delithiation and sodiation–desodiation mechanisms are similar to ZnS or ZnO;25,39,41 however, they could obtain a full conversion reaction during the charging process along with a lower potential plateau (∼1.3 V and ∼1.0 V, respectively) owing to the smaller band gap, weaker bond strength, and lower electronegativity of Se.16,38,42
The electrochemical charge/discharge mechanism can be expressed as follows (intercalation and conversion reaction: eqn (1); alloying reaction: eqn (2); overall reaction: eqn (3); A = Li, Na, K; X = S, Se, Te. Note: ZnTe may undergo a partial recombination reaction; i.e., eqn (1) and (3) are not completely reversible but leave a minor amount of Te in an elemental state after A extraction; in some references, elemental Se also presents in the charge/discharge process for ZnSe).16,22,24,29,31,37,40,41,43–47 xA+ + ZnX + xe− ↔ AxX + Zn (0 < x ≤ 2)(1) xA+ + Zn ↔ AxZn − xe− (0 < x ≤ 1)(2) (x + 2)A+ + ZnX + (x + 2)e− ↔ A2X + AxZn (0 < x ≤ 1)(3)
The alloying/dealloying process is both multi-step via diverse alkali–metal-alloys, for example, LixZn (i.e., LiZn4, Li2Zn5, LiZn2, Li2Zn3, or LiZn), corresponding to several small peaks of CV curves below 0.5/1.0 V.16,31,48 It is believed that Li alloying/dealloying reactions with Zn are fully reversible. The conversion reaction (e.g., selenidation and reduction processes of Zn metal) is partially reversible, which may be responsible for a large irreversibility between the first and subsequent cycles beyond the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The irreversible capacity loss can be mitigated by further enhancing the electronic conductivity and kinetics of the ZCs and their intermediates. Nano-sized metallic Zn may play an important role in enhancing its electrochemical activity toward the formation/decomposition of Li2Se, for example. This two-step mechanism is partially similar to that of ZnO with lithium, featuring the reversible formation/decomposition of Li2O and ZnLi alloying/dealloying processes.44 Notably, for the TMCs including ZCs, they usually exhibited a pseudocapacitance-dominated behavior (rather than diffusion-controlled process), especially at high rates, which are beneficial for high-performance batteries.17,31,46,48–50
Zinc chalcogenides typically have a cubic (sphalerite, or zinc blende) crystal structure, but can be also prepared as halite crystals or in hexagonal crystals (wurtzite structure). Those with unusual layered structures (e.g., tetragonal, t-ZnX, X = S, Se) prefer the AA stacking pattern (theoretical dZnS = 2.40 Å, and dZnSe = 2.48 Å in double-layer sheets) when forming multilayer structures, although exhibiting an interesting variation of interlayer distance (i.e., shortening to 2.33 Å for t-ZnS bulk but elongating to 2.91 Å for t-ZnSe bulk). Moreover, they exhibit a strong adsorption of Li atoms without reducing the Li mobility, featuring barrierless Li diffusion on the single layers (e.g., t-ZnS) for fast-charging LIBs.21 For the anodes with polymorphic ZnSe phases, the reaction mechanism would be more complicated. During the charge–discharge process, it is revealed that lithium is inserted into the 2H-ZnSe (wurtzite) phase prior to insertion into the 3C-ZnSe (zinc blende) phase, and the 2H-ZnSe phase finally transforms into 3C-ZnSe with higher thermodynamic stability in the following lithiation and delithiation processes (Fig. 1a–c).31 This lithium-induced polymorphic phase transformation was also observed in other systems, probably owing to the thermodynamic non-equilibrium.51 For the bimetallic selenide compounds, the reaction mechanism is similar, but the two-phase hybrids or the phase boundaries would exist during the cycling, which would relieve the stress and enhance the diffusion kinetics (Fig. 1d–h).41,52,53

Metal sulfides/selenides including ZC electrodes are often accompanied by rising and additional reversible capacities beyond their theoretical capacities during cycling (even twice the theoretical capacities after hundreds of cycles), the accurate mechanisms of which are still poorly understood. Recent ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals that a major contribution to the extra rising capacity in the Li-ion battery system may be ascribed to the generation and activation of Se during the electrochemical process.43
The sodium storage mechanism, however, shows some differences from the aspects of the potential plateau, reaction kinetics and corresponding intermediates. For example, to study the phase changes of ZnSe during the discharge/charge process, the ex situ XRD, SAED and HRTEM characterization studies performed at different stages reveal that the cubic ZnSe diminishes gradually and disappears completely with the discharge voltage decreasing from 1.5 V to 0.1 V followed by the formation of Zn and Na2Se (1.0–0.4 V) and specific cubic NaZn13 phase (0.1 V); while during the subsequent charge process, the ZnSe is gradually recovered and the Zn, Na2Se and NaZn13 vanish completely. In particular, if incorporated into robust conductive matrices, e.g., hollow carbon spheres or a 3D porous carbon matrix, the hierarchical hybrid electrode structure can be well maintained during the repeated discharge/charge process (ultrafine ZnSe nanoparticles in an amorphous carbon matrix, see Fig. 2).34,54,55 The electrochemical reaction mechanism for potassium storage resembles that of sodium in ZnSe-based materials, forming K2Se and KZn13.33,35,56,57 For example, the ex situ XRD and HRTEM characterization studies clarify that the electrochemical K storage mechanism for ZnSe electrode materials (Fig. 3), selenide intermediate (K2Se3, other references reported as K2Se) and elemental Se are clearly detected in the discharge–charge process, and cubic phase ZnSe can be fully recovered thereafter.33,35,56,57 In regards to Na/K-storage for bimetallic selenide compounds, the reaction mechanism is somewhat similar to that for Li-storage.52

Based on these results of mechanism investigation, new opportunities will surely open up for the rational and facile design and synthesis of advanced materials and electrodes for electrochemical energy storage devices.
3. Strategies for improving anodes for batteries
Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are now the most widely used power sources for portable electronic devices, and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are considered as promising candidates to replace LIBs owing to the low cost and abundant sodium/potassium reserves, especially in next-generation large-scale electrical energy storage.34 However, the anode capacity of LIBs is limited and the application of SIB/PIB anode materials is still confronting rapid capacity fading and undesirable rate capability due to the sluggish Na/K-ion kinetics.34 As key members of the chalcogenides, zinc-based selenides and tellurides have been increasingly exploited for the anodes of LIBs, SIBs and PIBs in the recent decade.32,58 Plenty of effort has been made to overcome the arduous challenge of obtaining cycling stability while realizing superior rate capability.
3.1 Structural control
Structural control is of great importance for the enhancement of electrochemical performance, not only from the aspect of ionic diffusion kinetics and electron transfer, but also as being beneficial to the structural and cycling stability of electrodes.5,59–61 Thus much effort has been devoted to the design and optimization of ZnSe and ZnTe micro-/nanostructures, these typical examples including 0D, 1D and 2D nanostructures,62–65 hollow structures,56,66–69 and 3D or hierarchical nanostructures.23,54,70 More and more structure design has been focused on metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived ZnSe and its composites/hybrids via selenization/tellurization and other in situ/subsequent compositing or hybridization, although they may be presented with various morphologies such as nanocubes, nanocages, and polyhedra with hollow or porous nano-/microstructures. The elaborately designed structures of these ZnSe/ZnTe structures, especially low-dimensional or hollow/porous structures, provide adequate diffusion paths for ions and effectively accommodate volume variation (e.g., buffer the strain thereof) in the repeated charging/discharging process.46,69
3.2 Hybridization with conductive materials
To date, most effort has been focused on carbonaceous incorporation to further enhance the electronic conductivity of zinc chalcogenides and the electrochemical performances thereof. These examples include ZnSe/C nanocomposites synthesized by various methods, as well as some nanostructured ZnTe–C, ZnTe–TiO2–C, or ZnTe@TiC-C composites synthesized by high-energy ball milling,29,30,71,72 and ZnTe@C nanowires, etc.73 Worth noting is that these conductive materials not only reduce resistance but also serve as buffers to alleviate volumetric changes during repeated charging/discharging.46,74 Furthermore, the strategies of structural control and hybridization with conductive materials are usually integrated (e.g., ZnSe/C hollow polyhedra,46,47 ZnSe/MWCNTs,75,76 ZnSe embedded in N-doped carbon nanofibers,77,78 willow-leaf-like ZnSe@NC,33 ZnSe nanoparticles embedded in N-doped porous carbon nanosheets,79 3D ordered porous ZnSe/N-doped carbon hybrid,54 “dual-carbon-confined” ZnSe@i-NMC@o-rGO80), thus for synergistic effects to boost the overall electrochemical performance.
3.3 Heteroatom doping and construction of heterostructures
Heteroatom doping and the construction of heterostructures are efficient for the improvement of conductivity and active sites, and thus beneficial for higher capacity and rate performance.10,11,81,82 Compared with elemental (e.g., indium) incorporation into ZnS for higher rate capability and superior stable cycling,27 many other elements have been tried on ZnSe and ZnTe. Typical examples include bimetallic selenide heterostructures (CoSe2/ZnSe, ZnSe/CoSe),52,69,83 Co/Zn bimetal selenide microrods (Co–Zn–Se@C),84 ultrafine MnSe/ZnSe implanted in N-doped carbon nanofibers,85 2D CuGaSe2@ZnSe-NC heterostructures,65 CoSe2/ZnSe@NC flakes,86 few-layer MoSe2/ZnSe–C hollow porous sphere nanocomposite (ZnSe/MoSe2@C),53 ZnSe/CoSe2 nanodots@N-doped yolk–shell carbon nanocages (ZnSe-NC@CoSe2-NC),41 ZCS@NC/CNTs composite (ZCS: ZnSe/CoSe),87 flower-like Mn-doped ZnSe,88 ZnSe/CeO2/RGO,89 3D porous or hierarchical ZnSe/CoSe2-C composite, etc.70,90
4. Anodes for lithium-ion batteries
4.1 ZnSe
Beyond the wide utilization in the semiconductor industry, numerous efforts have been focused on the design and application of ZnSe for energy storage owing to its high theoretical capacity (557 mA h g−1) and higher conductivity.16,91 Much effort has been made to address the essential issues and improve the performance of ZnSe, such as nanostructuring,44,67 and incorporation with conductive carbon (including carbon nanoparticles, porous carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes or nanofibers),16,28,45,48,77,91,92 by various methods including hydrothermal methods,45,67,91 pulsed laser deposition (PLD),44in situ pyrolysis/selenization,31,48 and the solid-state synthesis/mechanical milling route.16,28 For example, Xue et al. fabricated high-quality crystalline ZnSe thin film by reactive PLD and firstly proposed the lithium storage mechanism of ZnSe based on ex situ XRD and in situ absorbance spectra results. The reversible formation and decomposition of LiZn and Li2Se indicated the coexistence of both classical alloying/dealloying processes and the partial selenidation/reduction of nanosized metal zinc in the lithium electrochemical reaction of ZnSe. Although the cycling performance of ZnSe/Li cell is fairly good compared with that of Zn–Se/Li cell (Zn–Se: a mixture of Zn and Se), the high degree of crystallinity in the zinc alloys and the slow kinetics could be responsible for a large irreversible capacity loss and poor cyclability.44 Owing to the lower potential plateau, ZnSe and its composites may select a narrow voltage range, e.g. between 0 and 2.0 V, for a higher voltage/energy density output in a full cell or batteries. As an example, the ZnSe/C nanocomposite electrode prepared though simple solid-state synthetic routes shows a very stable capacity retention of ca. 437 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles at a current rate of 100 mA g−1, compared with that of ca. 705 mA h g−1 within the voltage range 0–3.0 V.16
As a one-atom thick layer of carbon material, graphene is a highly effective matrix to support TMCs for enhanced electrochemical properties owing to its structural stability and superior electronic conductivity, as well as flexibility and large surface areas.13,92–97 As an example, Zhang et al. synthesized polyhedral ZnSe/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites (N–ZnSe@rGO), with N-doped ZnSe nanoparticles of irregular shapes (∼40 nm) anchored on graphene nanosheets, via a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach.45 As LIB anodes, the ZnSe/rGO nanocomposites exhibit much better electrochemical performances than bare ZnSe owing to the synergistic effects between the ZnSe nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets, i.e., delivering a high reversible capacity (876 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1), excellent cycling performance and excellent rate capability (778 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1000 mA g−1). Moreover, the unique structure restrains the aggregation of ZnSe nanoparticles and prevents the restacking of graphene nanosheets, and the flexible graphene nanosheets also provide a superior platform for significantly enhancing the conductivity of nanocomposites, buffers the volume changes of ZnSe nanoparticles, and offers more exposed surfaces for lithium storage. The excellent electrochemical properties demonstrate that ZnSe/rGO nanocomposite is a promising candidate for anode materials for advanced LIBs (Fig. 4).45,92

The rational design of hierarchical porous hybrids/composites is an alternative solution to address these issues including large volume expansion, particle agglomeration, low conductivity, and stability of the ZnSe material and electrode thereof during the charge–discharge process.31,43,48,98 For example, Chen et al. prepared a polyhedral composite composed of ZnSe nanodots (∼5 nm) uniformly confined within a 3D N-doped hollow porous carbon network (ZnSe ND@N-PC) via a facile ZIF-template pyrolysis/selenization process (Fig. 5a–n).31 When used as LIB anode material, the composites exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, e.g., a high reversible capacity, enhanced structural and performance stability (1134 mA h g−1 at 600 mA g−1 after 500 cycles) and outstanding rate capability (1029, 696 and 474 mA h g−1 at 1.6, 6.4 and 12.8 A g−1, respectively) (Fig. 5o–r). This significantly enhanced lithium storage performance can be attributed to the 3D hierarchical nanoarchitecture of the hybrid composites, which not only alleviates the internal mechanical stress by buffering the volume change, and constructs a 3D conductive network during cycling, but also provides a large reactive area and reduces the Li+ ion diffusion distance. The strategy herein opens a new way for the facile design of multifunctional hierarchical porous composites towards high-performance energy storage devices.

Hollow structures with the advantages of higher surface areas, faster ion diffusion, and rich inner voids have been considered as an effective alternative to buffer the large volume variation and mitigate the capacity fading.59,99–102 Wang et al. prepared hollow-sphere ZnSe and its ZnSe/C composites by using the Ostwald-ripening approach and the subsequent introduction of a conductive carbon network.91 Owing to the enhanced structural stability and higher conductivity, the composite electrode exhibits a high capacity, excellent cycling stability (573.7 mA h g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 over 800 cycles), and superior rate performance (318.8 mA h g−1 even at 10.0 A g−1 over 5000 cycles). This indicates that this type of hollow composite can be a promising candidate for lithium storage applications. Similar works, e.g. through the selenization/pyrolysis of specific MOFs (ZIF-8 and its variants), have been increasingly reported in recent years and are demonstrating synergistic effects for enhanced performances along with the synchronously formed heteroatom doped carbon coating or matrix.46,103
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently been increasingly utilized as the precursors and/or templates to develop transition metal oxides or chalcogenides (TMOs or TMCs) with controllable morphologies and porosity, revealing great potential in energy storage and conversion applications.84 Due to the reinforcement, modification or synergistic effect between two metal components between different components, special properties can be endowed upon the multi-metal oxides or chalcogenides.53,84 Bimetal-organic-frameworks can be used to fabricate carbon-coated bimetal selenide hybrid nanoarchitectures, e.g., Co/Zn bimetal selenide microrods,49,84 (hollow/porous) mixed metal selenide polyhedra/particles (ZnSe/CoSe/NC,70,83 ZnSe/CeO2/RGO89), and carbon nanotube-interconnected Zn/Co selenide polyhedra (ZCS@NC/CNTs),87 which all exhibit good lithium-storage properties. For example, by a facile bimetal-organic framework approach, Wang and coworkers fabricated a carbon-coated bimetal selenide microrod composite (Co–Zn–Se@C).84 Owing to the MOF-derived porous particle-assembled rod-like structure and the synergistic buffering effect between the two metal components, the Co–Zn–Se@C electrode demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 949 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 500 cycles (higher than those of the CoSe@C electrode with rapid fading to 267 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles and the ZnSe@C electrode of 426 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles) and good high-rate capability (809 and 655 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively). The pseudocapacitive capacity plays an important role in the whole capacity, especially at high scan rates. In addition, with increasing cycling numbers, the surface-controlled (capacitive) redox reaction gradually dominated over the diffusion redox-reaction kinetics, resulting in enhanced Li-ion diffusion characteristics along with increased active sites, lower charge transfer resistance and reduced electrode polarization for the Co–Zn–Se@C electrode after activation, which probably accounts for the gradually increased reversible capacity during cycling. Zhou et al. synthesized a similar structure but with binary metal selenide (ZnSe/CoSe) polyhedra coated with N-doped carbon and interconnected by carbon nanotubes (ZCS@NC/CNTs) via a simple solution method followed by in situ pyrolysis and selenization.87 The rationally designed ZCS@NC/CNTs hierarchical structure provides a stable interconnected conductive network, integrated porous structure and shortened pathway for charge transport, which synergistically enhances the Li+ insertion capability, especially the rate performance. And the optimized anode material exhibits high capacity, excellent rate capability and superior cycling stability; e.g., a high and stable capacity of 768 mA h g−1 can be retained after 1000 cycles even at a high current density of 1 A g−1, superior to the performances of these individual components. The full cell with LiFePO4 as the cathode and ZCS@NC/CNTs as the anode was assembled and cycled under a voltage of 1–3 V. The full cell could deliver a stable capacity of 92.4 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles at 0.2C (here 1C = 170 mA g−1). Further studies are needed to focus on the full battery, from both theoretical and engineering aspects, to advance the practical applications. It is noteworthy that the multicomponent TMCs based on typical layered MoSe2 and ZnSe can also be fabricated into a hollow structure, which inherits not only the merits of MoSe2 with larger interlayer spacing (0.65 nm), higher electrical conductivity and enhanced capacitance-type contribution, but also the advantages of the in-situ-formed carbon matrix and abundant accommodation for volume variation. The as-designed ZnSe/MoSe2@C hollow nanocomposite via the transformation of polymetallic MOFs (composed of Keggin-type heterpolyanions, POMs), as the LIB anode, can deliver a high capacity of 1051 mA h g−1 (at 200 mA g−1 after 150 cycles) and excellent rate and cycling performance (524 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at 4.0 A g−1).53 A similar structure of N-doped yolk–shell carbon nanocages homogenously filled with ZnSe and CoSe2 nanodots (ZnSe-NC@CoSe2-NC) is derived from core–shell polyhedral MOFs (ZIF-8@ZIF-67) (Fig. 6a–c).41 The interfacial effect (i.e., built-in potential arising from the heterojunctions formed by coupling nanomaterials with different bandgaps) between the two active anodic components (Fig. 6d and e) and hollow mesoporous carbon matrix synergistically accelerates the Li+/Na+ ion diffusion and enhances the structural stability of the electrodes. Benefiting from these merits, the as-obtained ZnSe-NC@CoSe2-NC as an LIB anode can exhibit excellent electrochemical performances such as a stable and long-term capacity of 718 mA g−1 over 600 cycles at 200 mA g−1 (superior to the individual ZnSe-NC or CoSe2-NC). Even for full-cell LIBs (ZnSe-NC@CoSe2-NC//LiCoO2), the electrochemical performances are also promising (retaining a stable and high discharge specific capacity of 657 mA h g−1 in the range of 1.0–3.8 V after 150 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1 with a CE of 98.4%) (Fig. 6f and g). Overall, the MOF-derived bimetal/mixed-metal selenide nanostructures would extend the synthesis and promising application of metal selenides in the field of advanced energy storage systems. Of course, some similar bi-/multimetal selenide structures may also be fabricated via other strategies including co-precipitation synthesis (ZnSe–SnSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanocubes,90,104 ZnSe–Fe3Se4@NC nanocubes105), hydrothermal/solvothermal methods (hollow ZnSe/CoSe2@N-C nanospheres,68 core–shell MoO2/ZnSe@N-C nanorods106), electrospinning (MnSe/ZnSe implanted in N-doped carbon nanofibers85), etc. The summary of the Li-storage performances of typical ZnSe- and ZnTe-based materials is presented in Table 1.

In addition, it is well known that the electrolyte and its additives play a significant role in determining the electrochemical performance of electrode materials including selenides, especially for SIBs.37,78,103,107–110 For ZnSe, ester-based electrolytes, e.g., diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME), possesses lower charge-transfer resistance and better wettability, thus efficiently enhancing the electrochemical reaction kinetics and cycling performance thereof compared with carbonate-based electrolytes.34 For the LIBs, ether electrolyte (1,3-dioxolane/dimethoxymethane, DOL/DME) also demonstrates enhancement of stable SEI film formation and electrochemical performances for higher rate performance, superior cycling stability and longevity, owing to the suppressed dissolution of selenium into the electrolyte during the increasing cycles (Fig. 7).37

4.2 ZnTe
Typical ZnTe-based nanocomposites include nanostructured binary ZnTe@C nanowire composites via a multi-step hydrothermal, ion-exchange and carbonization process,73 and ternary ZnTe–TiO2–C, ZnTe@TiC–C composites by high-energy mechanical milling using ZnO, Te, Ti, and C as starting materials (showing superior performance compared to binary ZnTe–TiO2 or ZnTe–C composites).29,30,72 For example, Seo and Park investigated the lithium storage performance of ZnTe and its nanostructured ZnTe/C composite, which were synthesized by a simple solid-state (high-energy ball milling) route. The mechanism of Li storage is somewhat different to that of ZnS and ZnSe; i.e., the reaction between ZnTe and Li is partially reversible, leaving a minor amount of elemental Te after the recombination reaction, revealed by ex situ XRD and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis (Fig. 8a). With further enhanced conductivity, the ZnTe/C nanocomposite (consisting of ZnTe nanocrystallites embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix) could deliver a high capacity, favorable rate capability (ca. 550 mA h g−1 at 1C and 504 mA h g−1 at 3C) and excellent cycling stability (623 mA h g−1 in the voltage window of 0–3.0 V after 200 cycles), superior to the performance of a commercialized MCMB graphite anode. Furthermore, the reaction of the remaining Te and Li could be avoided by limiting the voltage window to 0–1.7 V, resulting in an outstanding capacity retention of 91.5% of the initial charge capacity after 200 cycles (Fig. 8b and c).

Zhang et al. rationally designed a kind of core–shell ZnTe@N-doped carbon nanowire via facile ion-exchange and carbonization; the 1D carbon-coated ZnTe (ZnTe@C) heterostructured nanocomposite (Fig. 9a–c) showed enhanced transfer kinetics and thus superior electrochemical performance as an anode material for LIBs and SIBs. As for Li ion storage, it can deliver a high gravimetric capacity of 1119 mA h g−1 (volumetric capacity of 906 mA h cm−3) at 0.1 A g−1, as well as a high rate capability (769, 706, and 618 mA h g−1 at 0.5, 1, and 2 A g−1, respectively) and long-term cycling stability (capacity of 710 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 200 cycles with a low capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle and CE almost 100%) (Fig. 9d–g). It is worth mentioning that the nanostructured materials may usually have a relatively lower tap density, and thus the volumetric energy density of the electrode and the full cell thereof may be somewhat reduced.73 ZnTe–TiO2–C composite demonstrated a good rate capability (76% retention at 10 A g−1 compared with 0.1 A g−1) and a high cycling performance (611 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 over 300 cycles with ∼95% capacity retention and 492 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 500 cycles). The configured full cell with cathode LiFePO4−graphite (LFP@G) in the voltage window of 1.0–3.8 V showed an apparent potential of ∼2.5 V, and a specific capacity of 81 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, a CE of ∼100%, as well as good rate capacities and energy densities.29 Overall, the strategy of incorporating high-density high-performance active materials into highly conductive nanostructured buffering matrix will be an efficient way towards superior energy storage systems with volumetric capacity concerns.

5. Anodes for sodium-ion batteries
5.1 ZnSe
SIBs are considered as one of the most promising alternative energy-storage devices for sustainable development in modern society. However, it is still a major challenge to search for proper anode materials with superior cycling and rate performance.75 Among the various TMCs, ZnSe also exhibits electrochemical activity as an anode material for SIBs beyond LIBs.75,111,112 For example, Li et al. fabricated a hierarchical hybrid with ZnSe nanoparticles uniformly wrapped in a 3D porous nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon matrix (ZnSe NP@p-NC) via a self-template-engaged in situ selenation reaction between Zn-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) nano-dodecahedra and Se powder (Fig. 10a–d).42 Owing to the structural and compositional merits, these unique ZnSe NP@p-NC “popcorn balls” exhibit an excellent sodium-storage performance, including high rate capability, exceptional cycling stability (294.2 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 5 A g−1 and181.7 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 10 A g−1), and superior ICE (94.3%) (Fig. 10e–g). The ZnSe NP@p-NC composites with higher crystallinity and fewer lattice defects of ZnSe together with controlled particle size or suppressed aggregation show the lowest ion diffusion resistance and best electrochemical performance, especially a higher rate performance; meanwhile, a higher content of ZnSe in the composite and a higher degree of graphitization of carbon components improve the electronic conductivity of the composite. Tang et al. prepared ZnSe microspheres (composed of primary nanoparticles) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes composite (ZnSe/MWCNTs) by introducing a continuous conductive network via a hydrothermal reaction and subsequent grinding process.75 The ZnSe/MWCNTs composite exhibits excellent rate capacity and superior cycling life, i.e., retaining a high capacity of 382 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles at a current of 0.5 A g−1 (corresponding to a capacity retention of 94% of the second cycle), and the (initial) coulombic efficiency of ZnSe/MWCNTs can reach 88% (ICE) and increase to around 100% in the following cycles. Most of the ZnSe/MWCNTs and ZnSe/N-CNFs (N-doped carbon nanofibers) composites64,75–77 with enhanced capacitive behavior, as well as ZnSe/rGO composite92 with capacitive-dominated kinetics, exhibit superior electrochemical performance compared with ZnSe/acetylene black (AB) as SIB anode materials, which can be ascribed to the improved continuous electron transport pathway, porous structure, and effective stress relaxation. In addition, worth noting is that covalent Zn–O–C bonds could be formed to crosslink the ZnSe active material and carbon matrix and are serving as an electron/ion bridge, which further brings about the enhancement of charge/ion transport and electrochemical reaction kinetics as well as the improved polyselenide capture ability and structural stability.113

It is noteworthy that ZnSe and its composites as SIB anode materials usually exhibit a diffusion-controlled process (i.e., battery behavior) rather than surface-controlled process (capacitor behavior),42,75 which is different from that as LIB anode materials; one exception is that the ultrafine ZnSe nanoparticles may show an enhanced pseudocapacitive contribution.34,41 Lu et al. rationally designed a robust hybrid hollow structure with ultrafine ZnSe nanoparticles simultaneously grown on the inner and outer surfaces of amorphous hollow carbon nanospheres (ZnSe@HCNs) via a facile hydrothermal process with the assistance of polymer hollow templates followed by calcination (Fig. 11a–j).34 The unique hierarchical hybrid nanostructure indicates a typical mixed sodium storage mechanism of intercalation, conversion and alloying reactions, where ZnSe converts to Na2Se and specific cubic NaZn13 phase (discharged to 0.1 V) through a series of intermediate compounds. The ZnSe@HCNs as an SIB anode, successfully preventing severe aggregation and ensuring structural integrity, exhibit an outstanding capacity, long-term cycling stability (361.9 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 87.0% and CE above 99.9%), and a superior rate capacity (266.5 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1) as well as a high ICE (92.2%) (Fig. 11k and l). Furthermore, a full cell constructed from a ZnSe@HCNs anode and NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode114 can deliver a reversible discharge capacity of 313.1 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 (in the voltage window of 0.1–3.0 V with a discharge voltage plateau of ∼1.7 V) with a high CE of over 98.2%. The outstanding sodium storage of the as-prepared ZnSe@HCNs can be ascribed to the effective confinement and accommodation of ZnSe structural changes both inside and outside of hollow nanospheres during the sodiation/desodiation processes, offering a promising design of high-power-density electrodes for various battery systems. Similar ZnSe nanoparticle-decorated hollow N-doped carbon nanocubes or hollow polyhedra show comparable performances.47,115

Two-phase or multi-phase compounds have been explored to exhibit intrinsically enhanced electrochemical performances for energy applications owing to the formation of heterostructures of abundant phase boundaries and interfacial charge redistribution (or built-in electric field).10,11,52,116–118 Fang et al. designed a bimetallic selenide heterostructure (CoSe2/ZnSe nanoflakes, abbr. CoZn-Se) and studied the fundamental mechanism behind their superior electrochemical performance.52 Benefiting from the abundant phase boundaries with lattice distortion between the CoSe2 and ZnSe crystalline domains (Fig. 12a–c), CoZn-Se exhibited low Na+ adsorption energy (more conducive to the adsorption of Na+ ions in the ZnSe side with high electron density) and fast diffusion kinetics for SIBs. The multistep redox reaction mechanism in the CoZn-Se heterostructure effectively relieves the stress of Na+ insertion. As expected, the CoZn-Se shows superior high-rate sodium-ion storage capability compared with its counterparts, especially an excellent cycling stability up to 4000 cycles in a half-cell (Fig. 12d and e). Outstanding sodium storage capability (332 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 based on the mass of CoZn-Se, discharge plateau of >2.0 V), specifically a superb cycling stability up to 800 cycles (83% retention at 1 A g−1), was obtained for the Na3V2(PO4)3//CoZn-Se full-cell. These works reveal the importance of engineering heterostructures or the high-active phase boundaries in bimetallic compounds to boost the performance in various applications (for ex situ observations see Fig. 12f–j). Alternatively, by incorporation of TMCs of larger interlayer spacing such as MoSe2 and hollow structures, the aforementioned ZnSe/MoSe2@C hollow nanocomposite as an SIB anode could deliver a superior capacity of 468 mA h g−1 (after 50 cycles) and a high ICE of 89% at 200 mA g−1 as well as a high rate capacity and cycling stability (381 mA h g−1 at 4.0 A g−1 after 250 cycles).53 Not only the carbonaceous shell or matrix, but also some polymer-based coatings such as polydopamine (PDA) are showing advantages in some heterojunction bimetallic selenides (e.g., SnS2/ZnSe) via surface engineering. The as-prepared SnS2/ZnSe@PDA nanobox with enhanced lattice distortion and electron redistribution at the heterophase boundaries in the specific hollow structure with a conductive and elastic shell can facilely adsorb/transfer Na+ ions, and promote the reaction kinetics and cycling performance. Thus, it can deliver a superior reversible capacity of 744 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 200 cycles, 616 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles as well as high rate capabilities.119 The abovementioned yolk–shell ZnSe-NC@CoSe2-NC nanocages also show an enhanced cycling performance with a stable capacity of 309 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles, compared with the ZnSe-NC and CoSe2-NC anodes, respectively. Further construction of bimetallic selenides via cation-exchange for ZnSe/Sb2Se3@NC hollow microspheres, for example, could enhance the Na+ ion storage capability and the cycling performance.120 Some similar works have been published in recent years; these typical structures/composites include ZnSe/CeO2/RGO,89 2D CuGaSe2@ZnSe-NC,65 core–shell or yolk–shell ZnSe/CoSe/@NC or ZnSe/CoSe2@NC nanobox/polyhedra,69,121–123 Fe3Se4/ZnSe@NC nanospheres and nanocubes,105,124 CoSe2/ZnSe@C nanoparticles,125 ZnSe/Sb2Se3@NC hollow microspheres,120 heterojunction nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofibers/nanorods (Cu2Se-ZnSe-CNFs, porous ZnSe/CoSe2/C, ZnSe/Co0.85Se@NC@C),126–128 ZnSe⊂N-C@MoSe2/rGO,55 ZnSe/Co0.85Se@NC@rGO,129 2D CoSe2/ZnSe@NC hybrid,86 and 3D or hierarchical CoSe2/ZnSe@NC hybrids etc.90

Furthermore, the optimization of electrolytes is also of importance for SIBs with ZnSe-based anode materials; e.g., Li et al. demonstrate that the use of NaOTf/DIGLYME (NaOTf: sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate) as an electrolyte shows significantly enhanced Na+ reaction kinetics, apparently reduced activation energy, and higher initial Coulomb efficiency (ICE) in comparison with traditional NaPF6 or NaClO4 in EC/DEC (ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate) electrolyte, accompanied by the formation of a more stable, uniform and thinner amorphous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with less decomposed Na2CO3/NaF (Fig. 13).54 Besides, the addition of some functional components such as rGO may also effectively suppress the decomposition of the electrolyte, and thus be beneficial for the formation of thinner but more stable SEI film (e.g., partly avoiding the Se being involved in the SEI and dissolving into the electrolyte, and the deteriorative intercalation of solvated Na+ ions into the SEI film) and the enhanced ion diffusion kinetics and electrode structure thereof.112

5.2 ZnTe
Ball milling is a versatile and popular technique to prepare nanocomposites; e.g., nanostructured ZnTe/amorphous C composite can be made by high-energy ball milling (mechanochemical reaction) of Zn, Te, and carbon black. The incorporation of C not only enhances the electrical conductivity, but also serves as a buffering matrix for volume change for the nanocomposite, resulting in an excellent rate capability (89% capacity retention with current density increased from 0.1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1) and good cycling life (373 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 500 cycles).71 In addition, the aforementioned ZnTe@C nanowires can also be utilized as anode materials for SIBs, which demonstrated a high specific capacity of 492 mA h g−1 at 50 mA h g−1, as well as good cycling performance with a capacity of 306 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at a current density of 200 mA h g−1.73
Heterostructures have also received attention in ZnTe-based anodes of SIBs. For example, Sun et al. designed a series of antiblocking heterostructures of NiTe2–ZnTe (NiZn–Te–CN heterostructures) via a bimetallic MOF nanosheet pyrolysis and tellurization process (Fig. 14a–e).130 The as-synthesized materials demonstrate superior rate and cycling performances due to the specific highly conductive antiblocking heterointerfaces which boost electron transfer from NiTe2 to ZnTe, viz., a lower energy barrier and higher Na+ diffusion efficiency (Fig. 14f). When configured with Na3V2(PO4)3 as the cathode, the full cell can deliver a stable capacity of 134 mA h g−1 over 90 cycles (91.3% retention) with a discharge voltage plateau of ∼2.0 V (Fig. 14g). These kinds of antiblocking heterostructure hold promise as anode materials for SIBs compared with monometal tellurides or blocking heterostructures. The summary of Na-storage performances of typical ZnSe- and ZnTe-based materials is listed in Table 2.

6. Anodes for potassium-ion batteries
Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are considered as another candidate to replace LIBs, owing to the low redox potential and high abundance of K in the Earth's crust (similar abundance but lower redox potential compared with Na).35,50,56,80,88 However, the relatively large K+ ions require specific active materials to avoid or alleviate the sluggish reaction kinetics and undesirable structural collapse; thus, considerable effort has been made in material design and electrode engineering, including typical transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) such as ZnSe- and ZnTe-based anode materials (see Table 3), owing to their appropriate potential plateau, high theoretical capacity, high electrical conductivity and low cost.

ZnSe with high-capacity merits from both conversion and alloying reactions is one of the most promising alternatives to realize better anodes with superior energy density, high rate capability, and long cyclability. However, the electronic conductivity and structural stability need to be further improved for an enhanced electrochemical performance.80 Incorporation with carbon is a facile but most effective way to boost the performance of ZnSe-based PIBs, and most studies are now focused on ZIF-8-derived ZnSe hybrids.50,132 Besides the nanoparticles, some other low-dimensional nanostructures have also been designed to address these problems, e.g., 1D ZnSe@C porous nanorods and nanofibers.35,78Via a self-sacrificial template (Zn2GeO4 nanorod)-directed approach followed by hydrothermal selenization, uniform porous core–shell ZnSe@C nanorods could be prepared. The nanorod hybrid with moderated volume expansion and improved electronic conductivity and K+ diffusion pathways can deliver an enhanced rate capability (286, 226, and 168 mA h g−1 at 1, 2, and 4 A g−1, respectively) and more stable cycling performance as the anode of PIBs.35 By embedding ZIF-8-derived ZnSe nanocrystals into electrospun N-doped mesoporous carbon nanofibers (ZnSe@PCNF), the capacity of the hybrid with potential application in a flexible PIB could deliver a superior reversible capacity and cycling performance compared with that of ZnSe@C nanoparticles (Fig. 15),78 which further reveals the critical role of the interconnected hierarchically porous networks for the enhancement of electrical conductivity and structural stability of the integrated anode.

To further alleviate the volume change and aggregation upon cycling and achieve higher performance, Liang et al. designed a flower-like Mn-doped ZnSe with a tunable electronic structure and boosted ion transport kinetics for PIBs (Fig. 16a–h).88 The atomic-level structure engineering relieved the potassiumization-induced internal strain and enhanced the structural stability of the anode material. The ultrathin Mn-doped ZnSe nanosheet assembled flower-ball structure exhibited a high capacity of 345 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a low current density of 0.2 A h g−1 with a 95.4% capacity retention, and a stable and high-rate performance with a capacity of 167 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 2 A h g−1 (Fig. 16i and j). The doping chemistry and mechanical stability enhancement thereof inspired a new pathway towards high-performance PIBs. The incorporation of carbon with ZnSe with delicate structures could further buffer the dramatic volume variation with simultaneously enhanced electronic conductivity. Dong et al. synthesized a willow-leaf-like N-doped carbon-coated ZnSe nanocomposite (ZnSe@NC) via a solvothermal approach followed by a classic selenization process, which induced more exposed active sites and facilitated the electron/ion transmission (Fig. 17a–c).33 The obtained ZnSe@NC exhibits good rate capability and cycling stability when used as an anode for PIBs, i.e., retaining a specific capacity of 107 mA h g−1 after 550 cycles as well as an enhanced capacitive contribution (Fig. 17d–g). Chu et al. constructed hierarchical stress-buffering open nanocages with sub-10 nm nanoparticles located in the shell of hollow carbonaceous structures via the classic hydrothermal method along with synchronous selenization and hydrazine reduction.56 The specific structure improves the structural integrity and electronic conductivity and avoids the ZnSe agglomeration. The hollow-structured hybrid could deliver a reversible specific capacity of 318 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and good cycling performance (189 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 500 mA g−1); however, the conductivity of the carbonaceous shells could be further enhanced for a better rate performance. Some similar structures are also reported, e.g., a ZnSe nanoparticle@N-doped hollow polyhedron composite (ZnSe NP@NHC),47 and double-shell or yolk–shell structured ZnSe-C nanospheres (ZnSe-HC).57

The introduction of 2D/3D conductive frameworks is of great importance to realize ideal electron/ion transport in electrochemical energy storage systems.61,93,94,133 Ruan et al. designed a “dual-carbon-confined” structure with N-doped carbon-coated ZnSe nanoparticles embedded in 2D rGO by coprecipitation and self-assembly with the assistance of freeze-drying followed by simultaneous pyrolysis, reduction and selenization (Fig. 18a–e); the as-prepared hybrid (ZnSe@i-NMC@o-rGO) showed an excellent specific capacity and cycling performance, i.e., 233 mA g−1 after 1500 cycles at 2.0 A g−1 (Fig. 18f and g). The enhanced performance may be attributed to the increased K+ reactivity and alleviated volume expansion with/of ZnSe via the introduction of an inner carbon layer along with the stabilized structure and promoted reaction kinetics caused by the outer rGO matrix, i.e., the so-called synergistic effect of the dual-carbon.80 Some similarly constructed mixed-metal selenide hybrid structures also exhibited an enhanced performance in some aspects, e.g., MOF-5 derived ZnSe–FeSe2/rGO nanocomposites131 and Zn–Co–Se@NCP (NCP: N-doped hollow carbon polyhedra).132 The improved performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the components, i.e., relieved stress due to different reaction potentials in the insertion/extraction process, enhanced electrochemical stability and charge transfer.

Although some full cells obtained by configuring with various cathode materials such as organic perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA)35 or inorganic KFeIIFeIII(CN)6,88 have been adopted, and are showing relatively acceptable capacity, the overall cycling performance and voltage output should be further improved for real cost-effectiveness and large-scale energy storage applications.
7. Anodes for other batteries
In recent years, some other new energy storage systems based on Earth-abundant multivalent ions as shuttle carries have been emerging; e.g., ZnSe (or ZnTe/ZnTe2), and bimetallic selenides are also emerging as a kind of positive electrode (cathode) for rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) or aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs),134–136 or as protective/SEI layer materials of Zn anodes for rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) or zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) to eliminate dendrites and side reactions (i.e., to enhance the stability of Zn anode).137–139 Although some work showed encouraging results, it is still in the infant stage, and much effort is needed to achieve the balanced capacity, rate performance and cycling stability. In addition, ZnSe and their hybrids/composites can also be applied in advanced lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) of low cost and high energy density via the enhancement of adsorption sites, redox kinetics and volume expansion buffering,140,141e.g., hollow ZnSe/NHC polyhedra as both an adsorber and a catalyst for lithium polysulfides/sulfides,142 and catalytic CoSe–ZnSe heterojunctions for accelerated bidirectional sulfur conversion reactions along with robust adsorption toward polysulfides,143,144 and thus for higher initial capacities (or ICE), excellent rate capability, and more stable cycling performance.
8. Conclusion and perspectives
In this review, we summarized the recent significant achievements and challenges in the utilization of semiconducting zinc chalcogenides (ZCs, typically ZnSe and ZnTe) and their hybrids/composites in advanced Li/Na/K-ion batteries. By tuning the band gap, interlayer spacing, introducing conductive components, optimizing electrolytes, and electrode design, the performances of ZCs have been greatly enhanced, showing a promising application in advanced LIBs, SIBs, and PIBs with superior volumetric capacities, rate capabilities and cycling durations. However, more effort is needed to overcome some vital challenges for their real-life applications.
(i) The rational design new structures of ZCs focuses mostly on three aspects: nanostructuring to shorten the Li+/Na+/K+ diffusion path and to enlarge the specific surface area of the material; designing hollow structures with suitable inner void spaces to accommodate volume expansion; and constructing hierarchical structures to improve the geometrical and cycling stability. Moreover, novel electrode designs such as flexible or freestanding electrodes also exhibit good promise in next-generation batteries.
(ii) The introduction of abundant phase boundaries in two-phase or multiphase ZCs via the construction of heterostructures creates crystal defects and active sites, which is beneficial for ion diffusion. The phase boundaries also enhance the reaction kinetics via the improved interfacial charge behaviors. Furthermore, the separate multistep (de)lithiation or (de)sodiation of two- or multiphases would effectively alleviate the stress during the repeated electrochemical reactions.
(iii) The incorporation of conductive components, in particular carbon materials including carbon nanoparticles, porous carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon thin layers, and graphene, as a matrix/backbone or protective shell of ZCs is an effective method to enhance electron/ion conductivity, and alleviate the volume change or aggregation of active materials during synthesis processes and repeated charge/discharge processes. The binary-carbon matrix may not only improve upon the electrical conductivity of carbon-free or single-carbon matrices, but also accommodate volume changes in the active materials during the cycling and effectively mitigate the aggregation of electrodes, thus producing a superior rate capacity and long-term cycling stability. In addition, for porous carbon materials with a high specific surface area, it can provide not only additional holes and pathways for ion diffusion and electrolyte infusion, but also additional pseudocapacitance for enhanced electrochemical performance.
(iv) The MOF-derived hybrid nanostructures are of great interest for electrochemical energy storage and conversion owing to the following merits: (a) the enhanced ion diffusion and infusion of organic electrolyte in the porous particle-assembled structure; (b) the synergistic effect between two metal components with different ion-insertion potentials, resulting in alleviated mechanical stress where the inactive component can serve as “volume-buffering reservoir” in a different voltage range for Li/Na-storage in the active one; (c) the existence of a carbon matrix/backbone, leading to the enhanced structural stability and electronic conductivity of the hybrid electrode.
(v) It is crucial to identify new electrode materials and appropriate electrolytes, especially for SIBs. Ether-based electrolytes facilitate electron transport and Na-ion diffusion in ZC nanostructures with a much lower energy barrier, thus enhancing the overall electrochemical performances including cycling stability and rate capability. In addition, by replacing the commonly used carbonate-based electrolyte with an ether-based one, it can mitigate the side reactions, e.g., the nucleophilic addition or substitution between the intermediate sodium polysulfide and carbonate-based electrolyte. And adding proper additives such as FEC or LiNO3 can stabilize the SEI film or protect the promising metal anodes, thus benefiting the electrochemical performance, especially the higher ICE, for competent practical applications. Besides the conventional liquid electrolytes, solid (all-solid or gel-type) electrolytes have also been emerging in recent years, which is conducive to the development of advanced all-solid-state, flexible, or wearable batteries.
(vi) The insight into the electrochemical mechanisms can provide guidance for the rational design of materials and electrodes. Similar to most of the transition-metal chalcogenides, ZCs exhibit a combined reaction mechanism of intercalation, conversion or alloying. Thus, tuning the cut-off voltage can control the degree of (de)lithiation or (de)sodiation and may realize a higher reversible reaction and long-term cycling, although the avoided conversion reaction will lower the capacities. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ and ex situ characterization studies have proved to be effective solutions. In situ or operando characterization studies with advanced techniques would help a better understanding of the real reaction processes and the real-time analyses of reaction products under realistic reaction conductions. And the cell configuration and compatibility with advanced in situ or operando characterization instruments should be further improved for facile and qualitative/quantitative investigation.
(vii) Despite the fact that many modified ZCs and their hybrid electrodes have exhibited an excellent performance in half-cells, for practical application, more investigation and assessment of ZCs in full-cell batteries should be emphasized in the future, especially for the higher output voltages and higher ICEs, another common problem confronting researchers on hollow nano/microstructures and some low-dimensional nanomaterials when considering extending them to industrial applications. Through the tailoring of the hollow structures, dimensions, and/or hybridization, the indicators for the tap density and energy density can be improved, and a higher capacity and enhanced rate performance (or power density) can be simultaneously achieved or balanced. In addition, more efforts on higher yields and facile procedures of these novel ZCs are still required for practical applications.
