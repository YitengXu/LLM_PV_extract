    , Accepted 23rd September 2021First published on 25th September 2021AbstractSolar evaporation is considered as a promising approach for harvesting freshwater from non-potable water utilizing sustainable solar energy. Integrating the photocatalytic effect into solar vapor generation is beneficial for the substantial augmentation of solar energy utilization for freshwater production and dealing with polluted water when it is used as source water. In this work, a synergistic photothermal–photochemical hybrid membrane is prepared by facilely dip-coating three-dimensional porous carbon nitride (CN) and a two-dimensional MXene on non-woven cotton cloth. The obtained hybrid membrane possesses high light absorption in the whole solar spectrum, a decreased band gap, excellent photothermal conversion accompanied by a reduced non-radiative reflection loss, and enlarged photocurrent by forming a Schottky junction between the MXene and CN under simulated solar light. With the combined merits above, the hybrid membrane shows excellent photocatalytic performance and solar steam generation. Typically, the hybrid membrane degrades 95% Rhodamine B, 92% crystal violet and 72% methyl orange at 3 mg L−1 under 1 kW m−2 irradiation within 60 min. The water evaporation rate is up to 2.30 kg m−2 h−1 with a solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of 98.9% under one-sun irradiation. Significantly, a large-scale solar conversion device is constructed for outdoor experiments to simultaneously harvest freshwater from contaminated water and degrade organic dyes in source water. The daily freshwater production rate is 5.7 kg m−2, meeting the requirement of two adults. This work demonstrates the promising potential of the hybrid membrane for potable water production and contaminated water treatment within one device and opens an avenue for application in energy conversion and storage.
1. Introduction
Water scarcity is among the most severe global challenges in our modern society and threatens the lives of human beings in the coming decades.1 Great efforts have been devoted to obtaining freshwater from alternative sources.2 Among them, interfacial solar steam generation, which exploits sustainable sunlight to generate freshwater from saline or contaminated water by directly heating water at the air–water interface and driving its evaporation, appears to be an appealing approach.3–5 A variety of photothermal materials have been investigated for proper thermal management, such as carbonaceous materials, plasmonic materials, semiconductors, and polymers, and near 100% efficiency has been achieved by advanced photothermal materials.6–13 By isolating the evaporating surface as well as tuning the wettability and topography of the evaporating surface, the generated thermal energy can be effectively used for water desalination, overpassing the theoretical evaporation rate limit of 1.47 kg m−2 h−1 under one-sun irradiation.7,8,14,15 However, as various water sources are used for solar vapor generation, nonvolatile impurities may remain and even get enriched in the leftover water when contaminated water is used for evaporation, possibly leading to more serious wastewater pollution. To solve this problem, several efforts have been devoted to incorporating photocatalytic materials into photothermal materials for the photo-oxidation/reduction of volatile contaminants.16–22 For example, Wang et al. prepared a ceramic plate with a CuFeMnO4 coating for solar vapor generation and degradation of volatile organic compounds by taking advantage of the photothermal and photocatalytic capability of CuFeMnO4.20 Recently, TiO2-based heterojunctions on solar evaporators have been developed for the photocatalytic degradation of contaminants.18,21,22 Despite the great progress achieved, building a synergistic photothermal and photocatalytic function into one system is the key to simultaneously realizing high-performance freshwater production and photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, which however remains a challenge.
Graphitic carbon nitride (CN) has been widely used in contaminated water treatment in recent years, due to its appealing merits such as nontoxicity, chemical stability, moderate band gap, and appropriate band structure.23–27 However, CN only utilizes a small portion of the solar spectrum, making the other part of the solar spectrum especially NIR light wasted. Furthermore, the high recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes within CN decreases the energy utilization efficiency and photocatalytic effect when used as an individual photocatalyst.28,29 Introducing another photothermal semiconductor or semimetal into the photocatalyst to form a heterojunction has been proved to greatly enhance the electron–hole separation and photocatalytic effect.30 MXenes, as a new family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and carbonitrides with appealing physicochemical properties, recently have displayed great potential in photothermal and photochemical conversion.31–35 Firstly, MXenes have excellent photothermal behavior, especially the near 100% internal efficiency of light-to-heat conversion, which can further promote photochemical reactions and solar vapor generation.36,37 Secondly, the excellent metallic conductivity and suitable Fermi level make MXenes a good co-catalyst by accepting electrons generated by n-type semiconductors and forming a Schottky junction, facilitating photoexcited carrier transfer and separation.28,29 Therefore, the integration of an MXene can trap the electrons to reduce the energy loss and enlarge the light absorption range of CN, which finally greatly improves the energy utilization efficiency. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there have been no reports on the construction of bifunctional solar evaporation-photocatalytic devices based on the combination of MXenes and CN.
Herein, we design a synergistic photothermal–photocatalytic membrane based on an MXene and CN to produce potable water by distillation and deal with the remaining source water by photocatalysis in the meantime, making it environmentally friendly for disposal. The synergistic membrane is fabricated via facile dip-coating of MXene and CN suspension on non-woven cotton cloth. The hybrid membrane exhibits excellent light absorption (ca. 99.7%) in the whole solar spectrum, superior solar-to-thermal conversion, and super-hydrophilic character. Therefore, the hybrid membrane exhibits a high solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of 98.9% under 1 sun, generating a water evaporation rate of 2.30 kg m−2 h−1. Meanwhile, the hybrid membrane effectively purifies organic dye-contaminated water with a high degradation efficiency of dyes during solar evaporation. Finally, a Z-scheme for the charge transfer in the MXene and CN-coated cloth was proposed to clarify the photocatalytic reactivity in the photo-oxidation. This work provides a sustainable and promising approach to design multifunctional materials as efficient solar evaporators toward the treatment of contaminated water sources and freshwater production.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals and materials
LiF was bought from Aladdin Reagents. MAX (Ti3AlC2) was received from 11 Technology Co., Ltd (China). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, Mn = 80000–90000 g mol−1) was supplied by Kuraray Co., Ltd (Japan). Cotton cloth was provided by GRACELAND Textile Co. Ltd (China). Melamine, NaCl, HCl (37%), and other reagents were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All reagents were analytically pure and received without further treatments.
2.2 Preparation of MXene (Ti3C2Tx)
MXene was prepared by selectively etching Al species from the MAX phase (Ti3AlC2).38 Typically, 20 mL HCl solution (9 mol L−1) was used to dissolve 1 g of LiF in a Teflon vessel. Then, 1 g of MAX powder (400 mesh) was slowly added under continuous stirring and reacted for 24 h at 35 °C. The obtained grey-black slurry was thoroughly washed using HCl (1 mol L−1) and deionized water (centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min) until pH > 6. Finally, a homogeneous suspension of MXene nanosheets was obtained by ultrasonication for 1 h under a N2 atmosphere and centrifuging at 3500 rpm for 30 min. The concentration of MXene was calculated to be ca. 4 mg mL−1 by weighing the dried mass of MXene from a known volume of the uniform suspension. The yield of MXene is ca. 41 wt%.
2.3 Preparation of three-dimensional (3D) porous CN
The 3D porous CN was prepared as previously reported.25 Briefly, 10 g of melamine (C3H6N6) and 450 g of NaCl were adequately mixed through ball milling (QM-2SP12) in a quartz container at 300 rpm for 3 h. Subsequently, the obtained fine powder mixture was heated to 550 °C for 2 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 under an argon atmosphere in a tube furnace and naturally cooled to room temperature. The light-yellow CN was prepared by washing thoroughly with deionized water to remove NaCl and subsequently freeze-dried at −60 °C for 3 days. The yield of CN is ca. 56 wt%.
2.4 Fabrication of CNMC-x hybrid membranes
The CNMC-x hybrid membrane was prepared by the drop-casting method (Fig. 1). Firstly, a designed amount of CN powder was dispersed in MXene suspension with the mass ratio of CN to MXene set to be 5:1, 1:1 and 1:5 under magnetic stirring, resulting in the formation of a uniform Suspension A with a total solid content of 30 mg. After that, 1 mL of PVA solution (30 mg mL−1) was added into Suspension A to get Suspension B by magnetic stirring. Suspension B was drop cast onto the pre-cleaned cotton cloth (thickness = 800–900 μm and diameter = 3 cm). Finally, the CNMC-x hybrid membranes were naturally dried at room temperature.
 Fig. 1  Scheme for preparing the CNMC-x hybrid membrane via dip-coating the mixture of CN and the MXene in PVA solution on the surface of non-woven cotton cloth for efficient solar distillation of contaminated water and photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in the contaminated water. The inset shows the photograph of the folded CNMC-5 hybrid membrane to show its flexibility. 
2.5 Solar steam generation
The light-to-heat conversion performance of the hybrid membranes was measured under simulated solar light (CEL-S500L, AULTT, China). Typically, 8 mL of the dye solution (3 mg L−1) was put into a 15 mL glass beaker, and then the CNMC-x membrane floated on the dye solution under the support of a polystyrene foam (diameter = 29 mm and height = 4 mm). Afterwards, the mass loss of water due to vapor generation under solar light of 1 kW m−2 was recorded on an electronic balance in real time (JA2003, Soptop, accuracy = 0.1 mg). Meanwhile, the surface temperature was measured using an infrared camera (DMI220, Dongmei, China). The environmental temperature was controlled to be ca. 38 °C and the relative humidity was ca. 35%. The solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency (η, %) was calculated as follows: (1)where hLV is the enthalpy (kJ kg−1) for the liquid–vapor phase change, I represents the total light power (kW m−2) on the material surface, and m is the evaporation rate (kg m−2 h−1) after subtracting the evaporation rate in the dark.
2.6 Photocatalytic activity of the hybrid membrane
The photocatalytic properties of the hybrid membrane were assessed by the photodegradation of organic dyes, including Rhodamine B (RhB), methyl orange (MO) and crystal violet (CV) at 3 mg L−1 under light irradiation of 1 kW m−2. The hybrid membrane floating on the surface of dye solution was firstly stored in the dark for 0.5 h to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium before initiating the photocatalytic reaction. To obtain the degradation kinetics of dyes, the specimens (ca. 0.45 mL) were collected during the irradiation at time intervals of 15 min. The dye concentration was measured by detecting the characteristic peaks in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum (Shimadzu UV6100). To test the long-term stability of the hybrid membrane, the reclaimed hybrid membrane was soaked in deionized water overnight after each cycle to remove residues and subsequently dried naturally before the next photocatalytic experiment.
2.7 Photoelectrochemical measurement
The photocurrent measurement was conducted on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., China) with a standard three-electrode cell in a Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.1 mol L−1). Platinum foil served as the counter electrode, while Ag/AgCl worked as the reference electrode. The working electrode was obtained as follows: firstly, 20 mg of sample was dispersed in a solution composed of 1 mL of ultra-pure water/ethanol and 50 μL of Nafion, followed by ultrasonication to obtain a homogeneous colloidal dispersion. Then, the as-prepared dispersion was dropped on ITO glass with an active area of 1 × 0.8 cm2 and dried at room temperature. The photocurrent measurement was conducted at a bias potential of 0.5 V under the irradiation of a Xenon lamp (300 W, PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Trusttech Co. Ltd, China). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in a 2.5 mmol L−1 K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] electrolyte at frequency ranging from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz.
2.8 Characterization
The morphology was investigated by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi SU8010, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV. Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) elemental mapping was performed using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX, Genesis 2000). The phase structure was characterized on a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, SmartLab-SE, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation operating at 40 kV and 200 mA. The thickness of the MXene flake was measured by using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Shimadzu SPM-9700, Japan). An ultraviolet-visible near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectrophotometer (UV6400, Shimadzu, Japan) was used to analyze the light absorption performance of samples in a range of 500–2500 cm−1. The water contact angle was examined on a contact angle instrument (Dataphysics, OCA 15 EC, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, USA) was applied to check the elemental chemical state of the samples. An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer (Bruker EMXmicro-6/1) was used to probe the existence of free radicals.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology, microstructure and composition

Fig. 1 shows the fabrication process of the hybrid membrane by a facile dip-coating method. Commercial cotton cloth was selected as the matrix due to its good scalability, deformation flexibility, hydrophilicity, and thermal insulation. By dip-coating a designed volume of MXene, CN and PVA suspension, the white cotton cloth was decorated with black MXene for NIR light absorption and yellowish CN for UV/visible light absorption. The as-fabricated hybrid membrane was labelled CNMC-x, where x denotes the mass ratio of CN to MXene. For comparison, CNM-x was prepared by drying the uniform mixture of CN and MXene with different mass ratios. Thanks to the rich oxygen-containing groups such as –COOH and –OH, cotton fibers can form hydrogen bonding with MXene and CN to enhance their adhesion. Besides, adding high-molecular-weight PVA into the solution further improves the adhesion between the fibers and MXene/CN. The bifunctional hybrid membrane was further loaded on polystyrene foam as an insulation and supporting layer for solar vapor generation and photocatalytic degradation of dyes. The CNMC-x hybrid membrane is flexible and easily tailored or deformed into various shapes (see the inset of Fig. 1 and S1†).
The morphologies of the MXene, CN, cloth and the CNMC-5 hybrid membrane are shown in Fig. 2. MXene (Ti3C2Tx) was prepared by selectively etching Al species from the MAX (Ti3AlC2) phase and then exfoliated in distilled water to obtain a stable MXene suspension (Fig. S2†).38Fig. 2a presents the SEM image of the typical exfoliated MXene sheets with sizes ranging from several hundred nanometers to a few microns. The AFM image of MXene sheets on a mica substrate shows a height of ca. 1.33 nm (Fig. 2b), indicating a few-layer structure. Compared to MAX, the disappearance of the peak at 2θ = 38.7° and the emergence of a new peak at 2θ = 6.9° in the powder XRD profile of MXene confirm its exfoliated layer structure (Fig. S2†).39,40 The as-fabricated CN has an uneven surface and 3D porous foam-like morphology, with the sizes of meso- and macro-pores ranging from 0.1 to 1 μm (Fig. 2c), resulting from the elimination of the salt template.25,26Fig. 2d exhibits the SEM image of pristine fibers in the cotton cloth, which have a relatively smooth surface and a diameter of 12.5 ± 1.9 μm (Fig. S3†). After decorating with the MXene and CN flakes, the surface of cotton fibers becomes rough, which facilitates intense light scattering inside the membrane. The cotton fibers are connected by a porous membrane of the flake mixture, generating micro- and nano-pores, which helps the transport of water inside the membrane. SEM-EDX elemental mapping further confirms the even distribution of Ti, N, C and O elements in the hybrid membrane, indicating the uniform coating of the MXene and CN on the surface of cotton fibers. Besides, the surface elemental composition and chemical state of CNMC membranes were examined by XPS (Fig. S4 and Table S1†).

3.2 Photoelectrochemical properties
The light absorption of the hybrid membrane was investigated by UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 3a). CN shows strong absorption in the UV range (wavelength < 400 nm) and moderate absorption in the visible and NIR light range (wavelength = 400–900 nm). In comparison, as a good light absorber, MXene exhibits excellent absorption in the visible and NIR range (wavelength = 400–2500 nm). Thus, the combination of CN and MXene endows the hybrid material with excellent light absorption under the broadband solar spectrum. Besides, MXene shows a metallic conductivity similar to metals and has suitable Femi levels, and therefore it can capture and store photogenerated electrons from other semiconductors to retard the charge recombination process.40 Based on the Kubelka–Munk equation, the optical energy gaps (Eg) of CN, MXene and CNM-5 are determined to be 2.65, 2.29 and 0.55 eV, respectively (Fig. S5†). By self-assembling MXene and CN, a large interface is created for charge migration. With the charge transfer from CN to MXene, the photocurrent is significantly enlarged to 9.5 times compared to that of pure CN (Fig. 3c). The interfacial charge transfer is further verified by the decreased electrochemical resistance as evidenced by the EIS Nyquist plot (Fig. 3d).25

3.3 Light absorption, wettability, and solar-to-thermal conversion
The light absorption ability of the CNMC membranes was measured. Native cloth has moderate or low light absorption in almost the whole solar spectrum (Fig. 4a). In comparison, CN-coated cloth can effectively absorb light in the UV and visible light region (<700 nm) rather than in the infrared region (Fig. S6†). Comparatively, it was reported that MXene has good NIR light absorption and photothermal behavior contributed by the localized surface plasma resonance effect, resembling that of gold nanoparticles.34,41,42 By incorporation of MXene into CN, the light absorption of CNMC-x in the whole solar spectrum is obviously enhanced up to 99.7% (Fig. 4a and S6†). Besides, the CNMC-x membranes have low thermal conductivities (ca. 0.07–0.08 W m−1 K−1, Table S2†), which favours the reduction of the conductive heat loss during solar evaporation.
 Fig. 4  (a) UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the native cloth and CNMC-0.2. (b) Surface temperature curves and (c) infrared images of pristine cloth and CNMC-0.2 under 1 kW m−2 irradiation. 
Besides excellent optical absorption, low thermal conductivity and a highly nanoporous structure, ideal solar evaporators require high photothermal conversion capability and quick water/vapor molecule transport. Therefore, the surface temperature of CNMC-x under 1 kW m−2 irradiation was measured. Fig. 4b shows that the surface temperature of CNMC-0.2 rises from 39.5 °C to 75.2 °C within 8 min under one-sun irradiation, which is faster than that of pristine cloth (from 38.4 °C to 52.9 °C). Besides, the steady state temperature of CNMC-0.2 (75.2 °C) is higher than that of CNMC-1 (72.5 °C), CNMC-5 (71.7 °C), and MXene- (69.0 °C) or CN-coated cloth (67.4 °C) (Fig. S7†), indicating the excellent photothermal conversion ability of CNMC-0.2. The improved light-to-thermal conversion ability of the CNMC membranes mainly results from the reduced radiation relaxation as charge transfer from CN to MXene occurs, which is affirmed by the increased photocurrent of CNMC-0.2 as compared to CN or the MXene (Fig. 3c).43 The electrons transferred to MXene induce a localized surface plasma resonance effect.41,42 Therefore, the nonradiative relaxation of charges to heat is enhanced.43,44 As a support, the infrared images of pristine cloth and CNMC-0.2 are shown in Fig. 4c and d. Consistently, CNMC-0.2 displays the best photothermal conversion performance in translating solar energy into thermal energy.
Additionally, the water transportation properties of solar evaporators are evaluated by water contact angle measurement. Water is immediately absorbed within a few milliseconds by the pristine non-woven cloth (Fig. 5a), indicating its excellent wettability. In comparison, the water contact angle of the MXene coated cloth remains at 70.7° within 180 s (Fig. 5b), indicating the hydrophilicity of the MXene resulting from the fluorine and oxygen-containing functional groups (Fig. S8†). By contrast, the water contact angle of the CN decorated cloth evolves from 93° to 0° within 0.3 s, suggesting its super-hydrophilic feature (Fig. 5c), which should originate from its nitrogen-rich (Fig. S4†) and 3D porous structure (Fig. 2c). The combination of these three hydrophilic materials produces hydrophilic CNMC-x membranes (Fig. 5d and S9†), which facilitates the continuous water pump in solar steam generation. Typically, CNMC-5 shows a water contact angle of 0° within 0.1 s (Fig. 5d).

3.4 Interfacial solar vapor generation
The interfacial solar vapor generation of CNMC-x hybrid membranes using a model dye (MB) solution is explored by using a lab-build setup, consisting of an electric balance and a solar light simulator (Fig. S10†). Polystyrene foam floating on the water surface is used as the support to separate the membrane from bulk water and minimize the heat loss by conduction.43,45 Generally, the water mass loss is a linear function of the irradiation time (Fig. 6a and S11a†). CNMC-0.2 shows a faster water mass change than pristine cloth and MXene- or CN-coated cloth. Meanwhile, the evaporation rate of CNMC-0.2 is up to 2.30 kg m−2 h−1, greatly overpassing that of pristine cloth (0.85 kg m−2 h−1) and MXene- (2.03 kg m−2 h−1) or CN-coated cloth (1.17 kg m−2 h−1). For comparison, the evaporation rates of CNMC-1 (2.20 kg m−2 h−1) and CNMC-5 (2.12 kg m−2 h−1) are slightly lower than that of CNMC-0.2 (Fig. 6b). Therefore, CNMC-0.2 has the highest evaporation rate. The solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of CNMC-0.2 is calculated to be 98.9% after the dark evaporation rate is subtracted. The heat loss of CNMC-0.2 is calculated to be 4.9% (Note S1 in the ESI†).
 Fig. 6  (a) Water mass changes and (b) evaporation rates and conversion efficiency of different solar evaporators under 1 kW m−2 irradiation. (c) Comparison of the solar evaporation performance of CNMC-0.2 and other reported evaporators (Table S3 in the ESI†). (d) The water mass changes in the dark and the corresponding evaporation enthalpies of various evaporators. 
The performance of CNMC-0.2 during solar evaporation is compared with that of other solar evaporators. CNMC-0.2 shows outstanding performance among various evaporators reported in the literature, including Co-MOF coated MXene foam,36 graphene oxide/MXene aerogel37 and MXene coated wood46 (Fig. 6c and Table S3 in the ESI†). Furthermore, the water evaporation enthalpy was calculated based on the water loss in the dark within 1 h, where the evaporators obtain the same energy from the environment for liquid water to vapor conversion. As exhibited in Fig. 6d, the water mass loss in the dark within 1 h is measured to be 223.1 mg for pristine cloth, 263.3 mg for the MXene, 295.0 mg for CNMC-0.2, 285.9 mg for CNMC-1, 277.1 mg for CNMC-5, and 261.0 mg for CN. According to the theoretical evaporation enthalpy of liquid water (ca. 2.434 kJ g−1), the enthalpy of CNMC-x is calculated by using the formula: Uin = Eequmg = E0m0(2)where Uin is the total energy provided by the environment in unit time; E0 and m0 denote the water evaporation enthalpy (kJ g−1) and the mass loss (g) of pure water per hour; mg represents the water loss (g) of samples; Eequ is the equivalent evaporation enthalpy (kJ g−1).
Accordingly, the calculated water evaporation enthalpy of pristine cloth is 1.0 kg J−1, reduced by 58.5% compared to that of dye-polluted water (2.41 kg J−1), due to the presence of many oxygen-containing cotton fibers confining water molecules inside the spaces between fibers through hydrogen bonding.43,47 In comparison, all of the coated-cloth samples have lower water evaporation enthalpies than pristine cloth. Among them, the water evaporation enthalpy of CNMC-0.2 is as low as 0.7 kg J−1, 29.0% of that of dye-polluted water (Fig. 6d). The decorated MXene and CN on the cloth play essential roles in promoting the water evaporation rate due to the following reasons: (i) MXene facilitates visible-light adsorption and light-to-thermal conversion; (ii) the oxygen-containing groups on the surface of MXene (Fig. S4†) and nitrogen-containing heterocycles of CN form hydrogen bonding with water molecules, weakening the hydrogen bonding between water molecules, and thus favoring the water transport; (iii) the interlayer spacing of ca. 1.44 nm between the hydrophilic MXene and CN (Fig. S2†) gives rise to the formation of water nanofluids in the nanochannels, which greatly reduces the water evaporation enthalpy in CNMC membranes.43,45,47,48 The combined merits of reduced water evaporation enthalpy, high light-to-thermal conversion, and exceptional wettability make CNMC-0.2 an excellent solar evaporator.
3.5 Photocatalytic performance
The photocatalytic activity of solar absorbers was firstly evaluated by a photodegradation experiment using RhB as a model pollutant. The sample was kept in the dark for 30 min to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium before irradiation under a Xenon lamp with a light intensity of 1 kW m−2 to initiate the photocatalytic reaction. Fig. 7a and S12† show the RhB dye concentration ratio C/C0versus irradiation time under different conditions. Generally, the characteristic peak of RhB in the UV-Vis absorption spectra decreases as the irradiation time increases (Fig. 7b and S13†). Strikingly, CNMC-5 degrades 98.9% of RhB within 1 h, higher than that of CNMC-1 (89.0%), CNMC-0.2 (80.4%) or CN-coated cloth (80.7%). The photodegradation of RhB at low concentrations follows a pseudo-first order reaction, i.e., ln(C/C0) = kt, where C and C0 are the concentration at reaction time t and the initial concentration at t = 0, respectively.16,22,25 The reaction rate constant (k, min−1) was calculated by fitting the slope of ln(C/C0) versus irradiation time (Fig. S14†). CNMC-5 shows the highest reaction rate constant of 3.1 × 10−2 min−1, about 5.5 times that of pristine cloth (5.7 × 10−3 min−1). It is about 2 times that of CN-coated cloth, indicating efficient electron–hole separation by the combination of MXene and CN. As the mass ratio of CN to MXene decreases, the k values of CNMC-1 and CNMC-0.2 decreases to 1.9 × 10−2 min−1 and 1.4 × 10−2 min−1, respectively (Fig. 7c), suggesting that the best mass ratio of CN to MXene is 5:1 for the photocatalytic effect. As supportive evidence, Fig. 7d shows the color change of RhB solution after photocatalytic degradation for 1 h by various solar evaporators and at different times by the photocatalytic degradation of CNMC-5 under 1 kW m−2 irradiation.

(f) The Z-scheme structure of the CNMC-x membranes under simulated solar-light irradiation. 
The degradation mechanism of RhB was explored. Thanks to the narrow bandgap, CNMC-5 can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under visible light to drive RhB degradation. The presence of ROS is confirmed by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra (Fig. 7e), which clearly exhibit the signals of DMPO–OH˙, DMPO–O−2˙ and TEMPO–1O2. The ROS can oxidize RhB and other organic pollutants to CO2 and H2O. According to the measured conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions of CN, MXene and CNM, the Z-scheme structure of the CNMC-x hybrid membrane is shown in Fig. 7f. The CB of CN is close to the VB of MXene; meanwhile the interaction of CN and MXene such as hydrogen bonding (Fig. S15†) could facilitate the formation of a heterojunction structure. Therefore, the photogenerated electrons are assumed to be transferred from the CB of CN to the VB of MXene, inducing the effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Moreover, electrons react with oxygen to form O2−˙ and 1O2 could be formed by the photosensitization of CN or via the oxidation of O2−˙ by h+.17,25 As the VB position of OH–(H2O)/OH˙ is more positive than that of CN, OH˙ radicals cannot be directly formed by the oxidation of OH– or H2O. However, OH˙ could be generated as follows:25,49 O2˙− + H+ → HO2˙(3) 2HO2˙ → H2O2 + O2(4) H2O2 + O2˙− → HO˙ + O2 + OH−(5) H2O2 + hv → 2OH˙(6)
The photocatalytic performance of CNMC-5 is further verified in the degradation of the other two dyes, i.e., methyl orange (MO) and crystal violet (CV) (Fig. S16 and S17†). Fig. 10a and b show the concentration ratio C/C0 of MO and CV versus irradiation time by pristine cloth and CNMC-5 under one-sun irradiation. As the irradiation time increases, the color of the dye solution fades gradually (insets of Fig. 8a and b). The comparison of the concentration ratio of the three different dyes shows that CNMC-5 degrades RhB and CV more effectively (Fig. 8c), possibly due to the higher affinity of these cationic dyes to the negatively charged CN or MXene surface than that of anionic dyes.50,51 The reaction rate constant value of CV is ca. 4.6 × 10−2 min−1, about 1.5 times that of RhB or 3 times that of MO (Fig. 8d).

3.6 Recyclability of the CNMC-5 membrane
To evaluate the recyclability of the CNMC-5 hybrid membrane, interfacial solar evaporation and photocatalytic degradation by adopting dye solution were performed for ten cycles. The concentration ratio of dyes remains below 0.2 all the time; meanwhile the water evaporation rate remains above 2.1 kg m−2 h−1 (Fig. 9), demonstrating the excellent recyclability of the CNMC-5 hybrid membrane for simultaneous photodegradation of pollutants and freshwater production. The good long-term stability of the CNMC-5 hybrid membrane is related to the robust cotton cloth matrix and PVA binder as well as the high stability of CN and MXene in dye solutions.

3.7 Outdoor solar evaporation and photocatalytic performance
To assess the real-world solar evaporation and photocatalytic performance of the CNMC membrane, we constructed a large-scale solar-driven evaporation and photocatalytic setup, composed of an evaporation camber, CNMC-5 membrane (diameter = 16 cm) on PS foam, a vapor condenser, and water collecting troughs (Fig. 10a and b). The transparent solar desalination setup (transmittance of ca. 97%) was loaded on the rooftop of Eastern Chemistry Building at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (July, 2021, Fig. 10c and d). The transparent cover made of poly(methyl methacrylate) condenses the vaporized water into water droplets, which subsequently converge and flow along the outer edge of the chamber to the outlet pipe at the bottom. Generally, during solar distillation, a thin layer of water mist adheres to the inner side of the cover after ca. 10 min of irradiation by sunlight, which condenses into water droplets in ca. 40 min (Fig. 10e–g). During the experiment from 7:00 to 19:00, the highest sunlight intensity and environmental temperature are 0.55 kW m−2 and 38.6 °C, respectively (Fig. 10h). The device realizes a highest water production rate of 0.75 kg m−2 h−1 at ca. 12:00 and reaches an accumulated water generation amount of 5.67 kg m−2 after 11 h of solar evaporation (Fig. 10i). Therefore, the freshwater produced from a 1 m−2 device is sufficient for the daily consumption of two adults (ca. 2.5 L for each person). Meanwhile, 3 ppm RhB solution was continuously degraded under sunlight. After 11 h, 87.0% of RhB was degraded accompanied by a color change from rose pink to almost colorless (Fig. S18†). Besides, the cost of CNMC-5 is as low as ¥6.27 per piece (Table S4 in the ESI†). The results of outdoor solar evaporation and photocatalytic degradation show the excellent water purification ability, photodegradation ability and scalability of the CNMC-5 membrane.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a low-cost, flexible, bifunctional membrane has been prepared by a facile dip-coating method. The incorporated MXene not only works as a NIR light absorber but also performs as an electron sink to accept the electrons generated by CN enhancing the electron–hole separation efficiency and photocatalytic ability. Accordingly, the hybrid membrane can utilize the short-wavenumber part of the solar spectrum to generate photoexcited electrons and holes via a Z-scheme system to purify polluted water via the photodegradation of organic dyes. In the meantime, the hybrid membrane effectively utilizes visible and NIR light to generate fresh water via solar distillation, providing a new approach to exceed the limitation of energy efficiency in traditional photocatalytic water treatment. This synergistic strategy offers an alternative way to enhance solar energy efficiency for contaminated water treatment.
