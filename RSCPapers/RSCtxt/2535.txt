    , Accepted 18th April 2022First published on 27th April 2022AbstractThe thermoelectric properties of intrinsic n-type β-Ga2O3 are evaluated by first-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory and relaxation time approximation. The electron mobility is predicted by considering polar optical phonon scattering in β-Ga2O3. A temperature power law of T−0.67 is obtained for the intrinsic electron mobility. Due to the ultra-wide band gap of 4.7–4.9 eV, β-Ga2O3 has a large Seebeck coefficient. As a result, a maximum power factor of 3.1 × 10−3 W m−1 K−2 is obtained at 1600 K. A clear anisotropy in lattice thermal conductivity is observed, with the highest thermal conductivity of 23.1 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K along the [010] direction, and a lower value of 13.2 and 12.2 W m−1 K−1 along the [001] and [100] directions, respectively. A high ZT value of 1.07 at 1600 K can be obtained at the optimal carrier concentration of 2.4 × 1019 cm−3, which is superior to that of most other oxides such as ZnO. In addition, the lattice thermal conductivity can be reduced by precisely adjusting the grain size, and the lattice thermal conductivity at 300 K (1600 K) can be reduced by 73% (39%) when the grain size is decreased to 10 nm. The excellent thermoelectric properties of β-Ga2O3 have promoted its potential application in the field of high temperature thermoelectric conversion.
1 Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) conversion technology can realize mutual conversion between heat and electrical energy, and thus can convert large amounts of waste heat into electrical energy for reutilization.1–3 It is a green energy conversion technology, which can alleviate the current energy crisis and environmental pollution to a certain extent. The conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials is dependent on the dimensionless figure of merit ZT as: (1)where TH and TC are the temperatures at the high-temperature hot side and low-temperature cold side,  is the average ZT value in the temperature range from TC to TH, respectively. ZT = S2σ T/κ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, S2σ is also called the power factor (PF), T and κ stand for the absolute temperature and thermal conductivity (including contribution from electronic thermal conductivity κE and lattice thermal conductivity κL), respectively. The higher the ZT value, the higher the conversion efficiency. Therefore, to achieve excellent thermoelectric performance, the materials should have large S and high σ (to obtain high PF), and simultaneously low thermal conductivity.
Up to now several high performance thermoelectric materials such as GeTe, PbTe, SnSe and Cu2Se have been reported to achieve a maximum ZT value of 2.4–2.8.1 However, most of these materials contain heavy metal elements, which are toxic and also costly. More important is that these materials will suffer from decomposition, evaporation/sublimation and oxidation when they are working at high temperatures. The oxidation of SnSe occurs quickly at low temperatures of 200 °C, and a thick oxide layer can be formed at 600 °C.4 Formation of secondary phases also occurs frequently at higher temperatures. The easy diffusion of Cu ions in Cu2Se will lead to the formation of Cu precipitation at high temperatures.5 All these processes will result in serious deterioration of the thermoelectric performance. So most of them can only work at medium temperatures below 600 °C. It is necessary to find high temperature TE materials, which have applications in many important circumstances, for example, the conversion of nuclear energy to electrical power for space missions.
Due to the high thermal and chemical stability, low cost and nontoxicity, oxide thermoelectric materials have attracted extensive attention from researchers in this field.6–9 Various oxides have been investigated as thermoelectric materials, such as BiCuSeO, Ca3Co4O9, ZnO, In2O3 and SnO2. Although BiCuSeO has excellent thermoelectric properties due to its low thermal conductivity, it is difficult for large-scale industrial applications since it contains a resource-poor heavy metal element. In addition, it has a narrow band gap (0.8 eV) which limits its high temperature application due to the bipolar effect. Among these oxides, ZnO, In2O3 and SnO2 are wide band gap semiconductors with band gaps of 3.4–3.6 eV. The bipolar effect at high temperatures can be avoided since the band gap is far beyond 10 kBT,10 where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Therefore the wide band gap oxides can work at very high temperatures while keeping high stability. However, these oxide-based TE materials generally possess relatively low ZT values due to the high thermal conductivity caused by the strong ionic bonding and also the light mass of the oxygen atom. ZnO is one of the best wide band gap oxide thermoelectric materials which can achieve a ZT of 0.65 at 1247 K after co-doping with Al and Ga.11 But this is still much lower than that of the high performance TE materials such as SnSe and Cu Se due to a high lattice thermal conductivity (47 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature). Nevertheless, since these materials can work at very high temperatures (usually >1200 K), a high conversion efficiency can still be obtained with a moderate ZT value. For example, with an average ZT of 1.0, cold and hot side temperatures of 300 K and 1500 K, a high conversion efficiency of 20% can be obtained according to eqn (1).
As one of the oxide materials, Ga2O3 has attracted considerable interest in recent years.12–14 There are five polymorphs of Ga2O3 (α-, β-, -, δ- and ε-Ga2O3). Among them, β-Ga2O3 is a thermodynamically and chemically stable phase, and the other four polymorphs are metastable phases, which will be transformed into β-Ga2O3 after high temperature treatment. As a result, more research works were concentrated on β-Ga2O3.15 Due to the ultra-wide band gap (4.8 eV), exceptionally high breakdown field (8 MV cm−1), low cost and high thermal stability, β-Ga2O3 has great application prospect in many fields such as high-power electronic devices, transparent conducting electrodes, solar-blind ultraviolet photodetectors, solar cells, gas sensors and catalysis.12,16,17
β-Ga2O3 may also be a potential thermoelectric material, which is expected to exhibit better thermoelectric properties than ZnO. First of all, β-Ga2O3 can achieve excellent electrical conductivity after appropriate doping. According to the reported results, the carrier concentration in Si and Sn-doped β-Ga2O3 can reach 1–2 × 1020 cm−3, and the conductivity can reach more than 7 × 104 S m−1.18,19 The electron mobility can be as high as 300 cm2 V−1 s−1.20 These properties can fully meet the requirements of TE materials. Secondly, a large number of studies have shown that the maximum Seebeck coefficient in semiconductor materials is proportional to its band gap Eg as Eg = 2eSmaxT,21,22 where e is the unit charge. The ultra-wide band gap of 4.8 eV for β-Ga2O3 suggests that its Seebeck coefficient may also be higher than that of other oxide semiconductors. A large Seebeck coefficient of −300 ± 20 μV K−1 at room temperature has been reported in β-Ga2O3 with a carrier concentration of 6 × 1017 cm−3.23 First-principles calculations also predicted that the Seebeck coefficient of β-Ga2O3 at this carrier concentration is −341 μV K−1, which is consistent with the experimental data. With the temperature increasing to 1000 K, the Seebeck coefficient can further increase to about −450 μV K−1.24 A larger Seebeck coefficient will generally lead to a high power factor. Thirdly, since the β-Ga2O3 polymorph is a monoclinic crystal, it has relatively low symmetry, which provides a large phase space for phonon scattering, making its lattice thermal conductivity relatively low, and the lattice thermal conductivity of β-Ga2O3 will show a certain degree of anisotropy. First-principles calculations showed that the lattice thermal conductivities of β-Ga2O3 in the [100], [010] and [001] directions at room temperature are 16.06, 21.54 and 21.15 W m−1 K−1, respectively,25 while the experimentally measured thermal conductivities of the β-Ga2O3 single crystal are 10.9 ± 1.0, 27.0 ± 2.0 and 14.6 ± 1.4 W m−1 K−1 along the [100], [010] and [001] directions, respectively.26 This indicates that the lattice thermal conductivity of β-Ga2O3 is much lower than that of ZnO (47 W m−1 K−127). Based on the above three factors, β-Ga2O3 is expected to obtain better thermoelectric properties than ZnO.
However, up to now the systematic study of thermoelectric properties of β-Ga2O3 is still very scarce. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of β-Ga2O3 is comprehensively evaluated by the first-principles calculation combined with Boltzmann transport theory. The potential of β-Ga2O3 in the field of TE conversion is compared with ZnO, which is presently an excellent oxide TE material. Our results indicate that β-Ga2O3 has excellent thermoelectric performance, which would be a promising high temperature thermoelectric material.
2 Computational details
The electrical properties of β-Ga2O3 were calculated by the first-principles method, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).28 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used to evaluate the exchange–correlation energy with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).29 By the convergence test, the cut-off energy of 500 eV was used for the plane wave basis and a k point mesh of 4 × 16 × 8 was generated with Γ-centered in the irreducible Brillouin zone. The quasi-Newton algorithm was used to optimize the atomic position and the force convergence criteria of structure relaxation is 0.001 eV Å−1. Since the PBE functional will underestimate the band gap of semiconductors, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)30 hybrid functional calculations were used to calculate the band gap. The band gap is corrected by the exact exchange of 35%, so that the obtained band gap is consistent with the experimental value (the experimental band gap is 4.8 eV31).
The Boltzmann transport theory was adopted to calculate the electrical transport properties. Within the relaxation time approximation (RTA), the electrical conductivity σ and Seebeck coefficient S are calculated, as implemented in the BoltzTraP code.32 The electrical conductivity σ and Seebeck coefficient S are given by (2) (3)where Nk, V, μ, ε and fFD are the total number of state k, unit cell volume, chemical potential, energy eigenvalue and Fermi Dirac distribution function, respectively. τe,nk and ve,nk are the electronic relaxation time and group velocity of wavevector k. Wherein, the energy eigenvalue was obtained by applying the HSE functional. The electronic relaxation time is a key parameter to evaluate the electrical transport performance, which is dependent on the specific scattering mechanism in materials. Previous studies have verified that the dominant scattering mechanism for β-Ga2O3 is polar optical phonon (POP) scattering.33–36 This is mainly because β-Ga2O3 is a polar semiconductor material, and its Ga–O bond has strong ionicity,37 which makes the electron–polar optical phonon interactions very strong. Therefore, the POP scattering was considered to calculate the electronic relaxation time, as implemented in the AMSET code.38 In the present work, the scattering rate from state |nk〉 to state |mk + q〉 is calculated using Fermi's golden rule as38 (4)where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, g is the scattering matrix element, and δ is the Dirac delta function. For POP scattering, the scattering matrix element is given by (5)where, ωpo is PO phonon frequency, e∝ and es are the high-frequency and static dielectric tensors. The PO phonon frequency, and static and high-frequency dielectric constants can be obtained using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) with the PBE functional. The electron mobility μe can be obtained by , where  is the conductivity effective mass, that is, the harmonic mean value of the band effective masses in three directions.
For the evaluation of the phonon transport properties, the inter-atomic force constants (IFCs) as main inputs were calculated. A 1 × 2 × 2 supercell containing 80 atoms was used to calculate the harmonic IFCs and anharmonic IFCs. The phonon vibrational properties are computed with the finite displacement method using the Phonopy code.39 The interatomic interactions were set to be the sixth nearest neighbor for the anharmonic IFCs. The lattice thermal conductivity κL was evaluated via fully iteratively solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, as implemented in the ShengBTE code.40 The κL is calculated by (6)where Nq is the total number of phonon modes q, fBE is the Bose–Einstein distribution function, and ωq, vp,q, and τp,q are the phonon angular frequency, group velocity and relaxation time, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and band structure

Fig. 1 shows the crystal structure of β-Ga2O3, which has an anisotropic base centered monoclinic structure with the C2/m space group. The conventional unit cell contains 20 atoms, and the corresponding lattice parameters are a = 12.23, b = 3.04, c = 5.80 Å and β = 103.70°.16 Since the previous experimental measurements and calculations were performed along the [100], [010] and [001] crystallographic directions, in this work the relevant parameters in the three directions were also calculated.

The electronic band structure of β-Ga2O3 is displayed in Fig. 2. Due to the fact that the temperature considered in this work exceeds 1000 K, the effect of thermal expansion on the band structure should be considered. So we also calculated the band structure with the lattice parameters at 1200 K (as shown in Fig. S1, ESI†).41 The lattice constant increases with temperature, but the effect on the band structure is negligible at finite temperature. Since the PBE functional will underestimate the band gap of semiconductors, the energy band structure computed by applying HSE06 is also presented in Fig. 2(c). A direct band gap of 4.84 eV is obtained, which is in line with the experimental value of 4.80 eV.31 The conduction band minimum (CBM) is located at the Γ point, and the valence band maximum (VBM) is between Z and I1. Since the energy difference between the VBM and valence band extremum at Γ is only 0.04 eV, it is often artificially regarded as a direct band gap semiconductor.42–44 In addition, β-Ga2O3 is an intrinsic n-type semiconductor, and the VBM of β-Ga2O3 is very flat, making the effective mass very large, resulting in poor p-type thermoelectric performance. So in this work the focus is put only on the characteristics of the n-type β-Ga, and the electronic structure properties are essentially not affected. Although β-Ga has a monoclinic structure with low symmetry, the conduction bands are isotropic. This is mainly due to the fact that the conduction band is mainly contributed by Ga 4s orbitals and O 2p orbitals, and there is a strong hybridization between these two orbitals, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The band effective mass of electrons at the Γ point is also calculated, and the results show fundamental isotropy. The electron effective mass using the HSE hybrid functional is 0.27 me along three different directions. This value agrees very well with previous calculation results with HSE and also the experiment value of 0.28 (0.26) me.42

3.2 Electrical transport properties
Based on the electronic band structure, the electrical transport coefficients can be obtained by solving the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equations. The calculation results show that the Seebeck coefficient is substantially isotropic, which is mainly caused by the isotropy of the conduction bands. Therefore, in the following discussion of the electrical transport performance, only the result in the [100] direction will be given. Fig. 3 plots the Seebeck coefficient of β-Ga2O3 as a function of carrier concentration at different temperatures along the [100] direction. The Seebeck coefficient is directly derived from the energy band structure with no adjustable parameters. The experimental result for β-Ga2O3 from the literature is also included in Fig. 3 for comparison. Our calculated Seebeck coefficient for β-Ga2O3 shows good agreement with the experimental results, which was about 300± 20 μV K−1 at room temperature with a carrier concentration of 6 × 1017 cm−3.23 The previous calculated S was also as high as −341 μV K−1 at 300 K with a carrier concentration of 5.5 × 1017 cm−3,24 which is very close to our result of −360 μV K−1, confirming the reliability of our calculation. Compared with ZnO, the S of β-Ga2O3 is a little higher. This is mainly due to the larger band gap of β-Ga2O3 (4.8 eV) than that of ZnO (3.4 eV).49 In addition, the S is also related to the density-of-state effective mass  as follows: (7)where, n is the carrier concentration. At a certain carrier concentration and temperature, the higher the density-of-states effective mass, the larger is the S. The electron effective mass of n-type β-Ga2O3 is 0.27 me and of ZnO is about 0.24 (0.20) me.50 This is also a key factor for the excellent electrical transport performance of β-Ga2O3.

To calculate the electrical conductivity σ, it is necessary to obtain the carrier relaxation time τ, which is related to the carrier mobility μe. The carrier mobility depends on a variety of scattering mechanisms. For β-Ga2O3, the influence of different scattering mechanisms on carrier mobility has been discussed in previous works, such as polar optical phonon scattering, ionized impurity scattering, and nonpolar optical phonon scattering.24,33,51 Conventionally, the carrier mobility is calculated using the deformation potential theory. However, this theory considers only the scattering effect of acoustic phonons on electrons, and thus will give an overestimated carrier mobility. As POP scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism at room temperature in β-Ga2O3, we only considered POP scattering to obtain the carrier mobility in this work (the corresponding parameters are shown in Table S1, ESI†). The calculated temperature dependence of electron mobility is shown in Fig. 4. The room temperature mobility is 101 cm2 V−1 s−1. According to the study of the β-Ga2O3 single crystal by Kumar et al.,45 the relationship between mobility and temperature is μe ∝ T−0.70 when the temperature is higher than 220 K.45 By fitting the calculated results, we get the relationship of electron mobility with temperature as μe ∝ T−0.67, which shows an excellent agreement with the experimental results.45 It should be pointed out that some extended defects may be generated at high temperatures, which will reduce the electron mobility. However, the experimental value of the carrier mobility at room temperature in β-Ga2O3 has a wide range between 90 and 300 cm2 V−1 s−1 according to the reported data.34,45,52–54 For a more comprehensive evaluation of the thermoelectric performance of β-Ga2O3, three typical mobility values at room temperature were also used in the present work, which are 90 cm2 V−1 s−1 reported by Kumar,45 184 cm2 V−1 s−1 by Feng34 and 300 cm2 V−1 s−1 by Sasaki,54 respectively. Wherein, the electron mobility of β-Ga2O3 at different temperatures was obtained by applying the relationship between mobility and temperature μe ∝ T−0.70.45 After getting electron mobilities of β-Ga2O3, the electrical conductivity along the [100] direction is shown in Fig. 5. It decreases gradually with the increase of temperature. Since the working temperature of β-Ga2O3 as thermoelectric materials can be very high, the bipolar conduction effect at high temperature should be taken into consideration. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the bipolar effect is weak, which appears only at a very high temperature of 1600 K. This is obviously due to the ultra-wide band gap of β-Ga2O3. The larger the band gap, the weaker the bipolar effect. The bipolar effect also has influence on the Seebeck coefficient as shown in Fig. 3. It is noteworthy that even at a high temperature of 1600 K, the bipolar effect occurs only at a low carrier concentration (<3 × 1017 cm−3). Normally a high performance TE material should have carrier concentration in the order of 1019−1020 cm−3. Therefore the bipolar effect in β-Ga2O3 can be neglected even at very high temperatures. This is favorable for the application of β-Ga2O3 as a high-temperature thermoelectric material.

The experimental data are listed in (a) for comparison.31,46–48 
With the above calculated Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity available, the variation of power factors with carrier concentration can be obtained, which is shown in Fig. 6 at different temperatures along the [100] direction. Since Seebeck coefficient S and electrical conductivity σ have opposite dependence on the carrier concentration, as shown in Fig. 3 and 5, there is a coupling relationship between S and σ. As a result, the power factor S2σ will show a complicated behavior with the carrier concentration, and a maximum power factor will appear at an optimal carrier concentration.55 The optimal carrier concentration is dependent on temperature since both S and σ are related to the temperature. As shown in Fig. 6, at 300 K the optimal carrier concentration is 9.55 × 1018 cm−3 with a maximum power factor of 0.93 × 10−3 W m−1 K−2, and at 1600 K the optimal carrier concentration increases to 1.35 × 1020 cm−3 with a maximum power factor of 3.1 × 10−3 W m−1 K−2. This optimal carrier concentration provides important guidance for the realization of high thermoelectric performance in experiments. On the other hand, the optimal carrier concentration in β-Ga2O3 can be easily achieved by doping in the experiment.18,19

3.3 Phonon transport properties
The phonon dispersions of β-Ga2O3 are shown in Fig. 7(a), which play an important role in determining the accurate phonon transport properties. The phonon modes of β-Ga2O3 have no imaginary frequencies, indicating that the lattice structure is dynamically stable. The three acoustic branches are marked with different colors while the optical branches are shown in black in the plots.

The lattice thermal conductivity of β-Ga2O3 as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 7(b). According to the symmetry of the monoclinic structure of β-Ga2O3, the lattice thermal conductivity along three different directions can be obtained by: κL[100] = κLxx, κL[010] = κLyy, κL[001] = κLxxsin2β + κLxzsin2β + κLzzcos2β(8)
Different from the electrical transport properties, the lattice thermal conductivity shows obvious anisotropy. The calculated κL values of β-Ga2O3 at 300 K are found to be 12.2, 23.1 and 13.2 W m−1 K−1 along the [100], [010] and [001] directions, respectively, which are in agreement with the experimental values, and are significantly lower than the κL of ZnO (47 W m−1 K−127). In addition, the calculated lattice thermal conductivity of β-Ga2O3 follows the relationship of 1/T, which indicates that phonon scattering is mainly aan Umklapp scattering process. This is also in agreement with the experimental results of Guo et al.26 The normalized cumulative lattice thermal conductivity with respect to the frequency at 300 K is shown in Fig. 7(d). The result reveals that 85% of the total κL is contributed by acoustic phonons and low-frequency optical phonons. Along the [010] crystal direction, the highest frequency of the acoustic phonons is higher than that along the other two directions as shown in Fig. 7(a), which accounts for the highest lattice thermal conductivity along this direction. It is worth noting that many studies have shown that the anharmonicity will increase with the increase of temperature.56–58 When the temperature increases to 1600 K, the effect of anharmonicity on lattice thermal conductivity may be more pronounced than that at low temperatures. In this work, the effect of higher-order force constants on the κL of β-Ga2O3 was not included, which may cause a small deviation between the calculated high-temperature κL and the actual value.
It is of great significance to reveal the underlying mechanism for the relatively low lattice thermal conductivity of β-Ga2O3. According to the Slack's model, the lattice thermal conductivity can be simply evaluated by: (9)where A, Ma, ΘD, δ3, N and γ are the physical constant, average atomic mass, Debye temperature, volume per atom, number of atoms per primitive unit cell and the Grüneisen parameter, respectively. The related parameters are shown in Table 1. ΘD and γ can be evaluated using the elastic constants (bulk modulus and shear modulus), and the specific details of calculation can be found in the corresponding literature.59,60 These two parameters determine the magnitude of κL to a large extent. The Grüneisen parameter reflects the anharmonicity of lattice vibration, which has strong influence on the lattice thermal conductivity. Generally, a TE material with a large Grüneisen parameter will exhibit a low lattice thermal conductivity as indicated by eqn (9). On the other hand, the Debye temperature is proportional to the average sound velocity. Therefore, a high Debye temperature will contribute to a high lattice thermal conductivity. The mode Grüneisen parameters with respect to frequency were obtained by (10)

This reflects the relationship between phonon frequency and volume change, which is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The Grüneisen parameters are smaller than those of many common materials with low lattice thermal conductivity,61–63 indicating that the anharmonicity of β-Ga2O3 is weaker. In order to compare the strength of the anharmonicity more intuitively, the Grüneisen parameter obtained by elastic properties is also presented in Table 1. The Grüneisen parameter of β-Ga2O3 obtained by elastic properties is 1.6, which is lower than the value of ZnO (2.2).64 In addition, the calculated Debye temperature of β-Ga2O3 is 705 K, which is lower than the previously reported value of 872 K obtained by first-principles calculations,43 but is in good agreement with the experimental result of 738 K.26 Compared with ZnO, the Debye temperature of β-Ga2O3 is higher. Both of the two parameters in β-Ga2O3 are not conducive to the relatively low lattice thermal conductivity. This suggests that other factors are responsible for the low thermal conductivity in β-Ga2O3 instead of the anharmonicity and Debye temperature. Then, the influence of the intrinsic crystal structure of β-Ga2O3 on the κL was further considered. As the crystal structure of β-Ga2O3 has low symmetry, when only the processes involving up to three phonons were considered, the corresponding phase space of three-phonon scattering was calculated as shown in Fig. 7(c). The low symmetry leads to a larger phase space of three-phonon scattering and provides more channels for phonon scattering as opposed to ZnO, resulting in a relatively low intrinsic thermal conductivity.
Despite that the lattice thermal conductivity of β-Ga2O3 is relatively low as compared with that of ZnO, it is still rather high for the application as thermoelectric materials. It is therefore necessary to introduce various phonon scattering centers to suppress the thermal conductivity. The lower limit of lattice thermal conductivity in β-Ga2O3 can be calculated using the Cahill's model by assuming that the material is in an amorphous state.65 According to this model, the minimum lattice thermal conductivity κLmin (also called amorphous limit) can be calculated by: (11)where vi is the sound velocity in each phonon mode (one longitudinal and two transverse). The predicted κLmin for β-Ga is 1.49 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K, and it increases slightly to 2.01 W m−1 K−1 at 1600 K. This indicates that the lattice thermal conductivity can be significantly reduced through some appropriate strategies. It has been reported that the lattice thermal conductivity of oxide TE materials can be reduced by one or two orders of magnitude through enhanced phonon scattering by nanosized pore structures.66–68
3.4 Optimized ZT value
With all the above calculated transport properties available, the thermoelectric performance of β-Ga2O3 can be evaluated. Fig. 8 depicts the ZT values of β-Ga2O3 along the [100] direction with variable carrier concentrations at different temperatures. As the carrier mobility reaches 300 cm2 V−1 s−1, the maximum ZT in the [100] direction at 300 K is 0.022, and the corresponding optimal carrier concentration is 9.55 × 1018 cm−3. With the temperature increasing up to 1600 K, the maximum ZT along the [100] direction can be as high as 1.07 with an optimal carrier concentration of 2.41 × 1019 cm−3. For the other two directions, the lattice thermal conductivity is higher, which will result in a lower ZT value. For example, the room temperature κL in the [010] direction has a highest value of 23.1 W m−1 K−1, and the maximum ZT reaches a relatively lower value of 0.69 at 1600 K. But this is still much higher than that of other oxide thermoelectric materials such as ZnO (the calculated ZT value of ZnO is about 0.43 at 1600 K69).
 Fig. 8  The calculated ZT values of β-Ga2O3 along the [100] direction as a function of carrier concentration (the carrier mobilities used in figures (a–d) are 101, 90, 184 and 300 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). 
By comparing the results of the power factor in Fig. 6 and ZT in Fig. 8, it can be found that the optimal carrier concentration for the ZT value is different from that for the power factor. This is due to the reason that the total thermal conductivity contains contributions from both electrons and phonons (κ = κE + κL). It is interesting to find that the optimal carrier concentration for power factor increases with increasing temperature, while that for ZT changes little, especially at higher temperatures. This suggests that once the electrical transport of β-Ga2O3 is tailored under the optimal conditions, it can be applied to other higher temperatures with persistent high performance.

Fig. 9 shows the calculated optimal ZT value of β-Ga2O3 as a function of temperature along the [100], [010] and [001] directions using four different carrier mobilities. The optimal ZT increases with temperature, which is consistent with previous studies. It is worthy to note that the increasing rate of ZT also increases with temperature. This suggests that β-Ga2O3 is especially appropriate for high temperature TE materials. Since the electrical conductivity is strongly dependent on the carrier mobility, a low carrier mobility will lead to a lower ZT value, as indicated in Fig. 8 and 9. In addition, due to the anisotropy of lattice thermal conductivity, the ZT values also differ along different directions as shown in Fig. 9. In a very recent study, Ashish Kumar et al. obtained a ZT value of 0.01 at 300 K in a Sn-doped β-Ga2O3 with a carrier concentration of 2.15 × 1018 cm−3 and mobility of 90 cm2 V−1 s−1.45 By using this carrier mobility and carrier concentration, our calculation gives a ZT value of 0.007 at 300 K, which is in good agreement with the results of Kumar et al. This further confirms the reliability of our calculations, and a high carrier mobility and optimal carrier concentration are both necessary to achieve good thermoelectric performance.
 Fig. 9  The calculated optimal ZT value of β-Ga2O3 as a function of temperature along (a) [100]; (b) [010] and (c) [001] directions applying different carrier mobilities. 
Based on the above results and discussion, it can be concluded that an elaborate tailoring of the electrical transport properties of β-Ga2O3 to attain the optimal carrier concentration is the first and the most important step for high thermoelectric performance. High quality crystals are also necessary for high carrier mobility. Besides, the lattice thermal conductivity is another important parameter to further improve the ZT of β-Ga2O3. The effective way is to introduce various phonon scattering centers such as grain boundaries, point defects, nanoprecipitates and pores. If the lattice thermal conductivity at 300 K is reduced to below the amorphous limit (1.49 W m−1 K−1) by introducing strong phonon scattering centers such as pore structures,66,67 the optimal ZT along the [100] direction will be higher than 0.16. Since the crystal structure of oxides still remains after introducing nanopore structures, the Umklapp phonon–phonon scattering process will cause a further decrease of κL with increasing temperature as opposed to the increase of κLmin shown in Fig. 7(b). Therefore the ZT values at higher temperatures will also become higher, which leads to a substantial increase in the average ZT, thus a high conversion efficiency will be achieved.
In this work, we also tried the further optimization of thermoelectric performance of β-Ga2O3 by decreasing the crystal size to the nanometer scale for introducing grain boundaries. The dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity on the grain size after nanocrystallization was calculated. The lattice thermal conductivity of finite-size (10, 30, 50, 100, 150 and 200 nm) β-Ga2O3 as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The κL decreases with decreasing grain size for β-Ga2O3 due to the enhanced boundary scattering. When the crystal size decreases to 100, 50 and 10 nm, the κL in the [100] direction at 300 K is reduced by 31% (8.42 W m−1 K−1), 44% (6.84 W m−1 K−1) and 73% (3.27 W m−1 K−1), and at 1600 K it is is reduced by 8% (1.95 W m−1 K−1), 15% (1.82 W m−1 K−1) and 39% (1.30 W m−1 K−1), respectively. As a result, the optimal ZT values of β-Ga2O3 can be further improved by decreasing the grain size.
4 Conclusions
In summary, the thermoelectric properties of β-Ga2O3 were systematically studied using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory. The results show that a high power factor of 3.1 × 10−3 W m−1 K−2 can be obtained at a carrier concentration of 1.35 × 1020 cm−3 taking the carrier mobility to be μ = 300 cm2 V−1 s−1. The lattice thermal conductivity shows clear anisotropy, which is 23.1, 13.2 and 12.2 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K along the [010], [001] and [100] directions, respectively. As a result, a maximum ZT value of 1.07 at 1600 K along the [100] direction can be achieved. It is obvious that the thermoelectric properties of n-type β-Ga2O3 are superior to ZnO, suggesting that β-Ga2O3 is a potential candidate for high temperature thermoelectric materials. Furthermore, if the grain size of β-Ga2O3 is reduced to 10 nm through nanocrystallization, the lattice thermal conductivity is reduced to 1.30 W m−1 K−1 at 1600 K, and the optimal ZT may be enhanced.
