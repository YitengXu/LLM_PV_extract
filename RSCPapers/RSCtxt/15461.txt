    , Accepted 2nd July 2021First published on 13th July 2021AbstractThe water oxidation reaction involves a four electron–proton coupled process that is kinetically sluggish and has hindered the widespread application of water-splitting technology. Metal-MOF-coupled heterostructures serve as good OER electrocatalysts due to their endowed MOF frameworks and numerous transition metal active sites at the interface. In this study, a simple ultrasonic impregnation strategy was used to prepare CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 heterostructures via the impregnation of Co and Ni ions into UiO-66 followed by roasting in air at 300 °C to obtain heterostructures with UiO-66-retained frameworks as revealed by SEM. The electrochemical results show that the respective impregnation successfully modulated the electronic charge at the interface of the heterostructures, leading to rapid electron transfer that enhanced the OER activity. CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 heterostructures showed good oxygen evolution reaction activities of 283 mV and 291.6 mV, respectively, due to the retained UiO-66 framework, while CoOx/UiO-66-550 and NiO/UiO-66-550 heterostructures calcined at 550 °C showed a decrease in OER activities of 332.6 mV and 346.6 mV, respectively, due to the collapsed UiO-66 framework. This work gives insight into the development of heterostructures of MOF-retained frameworks for energy applications.
Introduction
Global energy demand has been on the increase, and energy sources from non-renewable fossil fuels are gradually depleting.1 This back-drop has resulted in the development of energy conversion and storage technologies (e.g. water electrolysis) that converts electric energies generated from solar and wind power into hydrogen fuels,2,3 thus bridging the gap between demand and supply. Recently, much attention has been drawn towards electrocatalysis of water splitting involving two half-reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to produce hydrogen at the cathode and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to produce oxygen at the anode because it is renewable, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective. The OER is considered the bottleneck that has hindered the widespread application of this technology because it suffers from a kinetically sluggish four-electron process, limiting its efficiency. This development necessitated the urgent requirement for highly active and stable catalysts to boost the OER efficiency. This can be achieved by synthesizing catalysts that could provide high current density at a lower applied potential to increase the reaction kinetics and reduce the working overpotential. The benefit of this achievement is an optimum operational electric energy consumption that will make water-splitting technology more competitive among the other existing hydrogen production technologies.4,5
Precious metal oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2 are the benchmark OER catalysts due to their ability to exhibit high activity at wide pH values.6 Thin films of RuO2 and IrO2, for instance, require an overpotential of 200 mV (acid) and 300 mV (base), respectively, to achieve a current density (j) of 10 mA cm−2. Although these electrocatalysts are practically employed in proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, their scarcity, high cost, and low stability hinder their widespread applications.7,8 These challenges rocking noble-metal-based electrocatalysts make it necessary to develop earth-abundant, low-cost, stable, and efficient electrocatalysts with enhanced catalytic performance towards the OER.
In recent years, transition metal-based materials such as their oxides, phosphides, sulfides, nitrides, and hydroxides have been used as alternative OER electrocatalysts due to their earth-abundance, cost-effectiveness, and abundant OER active sites provided by the metal centers.9–14 They are presently state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions and they can be extended to the industry due to their cost-effectiveness and abundant reserves.15–18 CoOx and NiO have been precisely reported as the best transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts. This is due to their favorable OH–M bond strength that results in optimum adsorption and desorption of intermediates, thus leading to oxygen oxidation at a low overpotential in addition to the OER active sites they provide. Despite the significant success recorded in the activities and selectivities of transition metal-based oxide catalysts for the OER, they exhibit poor electrical conductivity, low specific surface area, and instability. It is necessary to improve their electrocatalytic performance, by developing electrocatalysts with large surface area and suitable size.
The development of heterostructures is an effective strategy for designing electrocatalysts with increased OER performance.19,20 This is carried out through interfacial engineering by constructing a heterojunction via the integration of various components.21–24 This strategy helps in enhancing the inherent properties of the individual components with unique physicochemical properties that are favorable for the OER. This can arise from the lattice mismatch at the interface between different components, thus creating additional catalytically active sites. It is generally believed that building heterostructures containing dissimilar coupling components with different bandgaps could promote the interfacial reaction kinetics and accelerate the charge carrier transport due to the strong intrinsic electric field at the heterointerface. Importantly, the size of the energy bandgap between the integrated compounds is directly proportional to the electric field at the heterointerface. Therefore, a strong electric field at the heterointerface is induced by a large energy bandgap and vice versa between the integrated compounds.25–28 Unlike MOF-derived heterostructures obtained via high-temperature thermal treatment (600–1000 °C) which collapses the MOF framework leading to a loss of the highly ordered porosity and reduced surface area, heterostructures with inherent MOF morphology and framework give better OER performance. Previous studies have reported that UiO-66 is a thermally and chemically stable MOF, but lacks sufficient catalytic active sites.29–33 On this note, transition metals are ideal candidates that can introduce OER active sites to UiO-66 for outstanding activity. Although numerous studies have incorporated transition metal oxides into MOFs for OER electrocatalysis, they recorded high overpotentials due to the loss of MOF features which impedes the practical application of water-splitting technology.34 To the best of our knowledge, the superiority of heterostructures with a UiO-66-retained framework over UiO-66-derived heterostructures as OER electrocatalysts has not been reported. Therefore, to ensure enhanced OER catalytic activity, it is important to develop heterostructures with MOF-retained frameworks to benefit from the various endowed features of MOFs.
In this study, CoOx and NiO were respectively incorporated into the framework of UiO-66 MOFs through the ultrasonic impregnation of Co and Ni ions followed by calcination in air at 300 °C to form unique CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 heterostructures with a retained UiO-66 framework for an efficient OER. Among the prepared materials, a lower overpotential was recorded for CoOx/UiO-66-300 (η10 = 283.6 mV) compared to NiO/UiO-66-300 and UiO-66 that gave 291.6 mV and 416.6 mV, respectively. Under increased thermal treatment of UiO-66 and impregnated Co and Ni ions under 550 °C, the UiO-66 framework collapsed, leading to a decrease in the OER performance of the heterostructures. This work provides a new way to improve the OER performance of Co- and Ni-based materials by rational design of heterostructures.
Experimental
Materials
Cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O; 99.99%), nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O 99.99%), UiO-66 powder, and potassium hydroxide (KOH, 90%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai, China). Carbon cloth (CC) was purchased from Jiangyin Youkun Experimental Equipment Co. Ltd. Nafion solution was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methanol (99.5%) was purchased from Beijing Chemical Corp. The water was purified by using a Millipore system. All these reagents were used without any further purification. In a typical procedure, hydrophilic carbon cloth was obtained by refluxing it in concentrated HNO3 at 200 °C for 2 h, then cleaned with ethanol and water, and dried under an Ar atmosphere.
Synthesis of CoOx/UiO-66-300, NiO/UiO-66-300, and CoOx/UiO-66-550

Preparation of CoOx/UiO-66-300/NiO/UiO-66-300 catalysts. 
According to the water absorption rate of carriers, a 1:1 mass ratio of a metal precursor and carrier precursor was used. 1.5 mmol (436.54 mg) of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 1.5 mmol (436.18 mg) of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were separately dissolved and then formulated into two different solutions. The UiO-66 carrier powder was ultrasonically impregnated into the two solutions for 4 h according to the equal volume impregnation method and was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The obtained powder was then calcined in a tube furnace at 300 °C for 4 h in an air atmosphere, and then the temperature was lowered to obtain a catalyst. The Co content of the catalyst is calculated as Co metal, and the Co loading amount is equal to mCo/mUiO-66 × 100%. We prepared the catalyst with 5% Co content and denoted it as CoOx/UiO-66-300. In the same way, a NiO/UiO-66-300 catalyst with a Ni content of 5% was prepared.


Preparation of CoOx/UiO-66-550/NiO/UiO-66-550 catalysts. 
The CoOx/UiO-66-550/NiO/UiO-66-550 catalysts were prepared using the same preparation process of the CoOx/UiO-66-300/NiO/UiO-66-300 catalysts, except that the temperature rise rate of 5° min−1 is increased to 550 °C for 4 hours during the calcination in a tube furnace, and the rest of the operation process is consistent with that of the CoOx/UiO-66-300/NiO/UiO-66-300 catalysts.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance powder diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα (k = 0.15418 nm) source. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi model SU8020 FESEM. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) with a Krato, AXIS-HS monochromatized Al Kα cathode source, at 75–150 W, using a low-energy electron gun for charge neutralization. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded using nitrogen-adsorption apparatus (AUTOSORB-IQ-XR-C) and the specific surface area was calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were carried out in an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) based on a standard three-electrode cell with 1.0 M KOH solution at room temperature. A piece of carbon cloth supported catalyst was used as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl served as the reference electrode and a platinum plate (1 cm2) was selected as the counter electrode. To prepare the working electrode, 4.0 mg of the catalyst or IrO2 was dissolved in a mixed solution of 30 μL of Nafion (0.5 wt%), 500 μL of ethanol, and 470 μL of water, followed by sonication for 30 minutes to form a homogeneous suspension. In a loading area of 0.3 cm2, 30.0 μL of the catalyst ink was loaded on both sides of the pretreated carbon cloth substrate (1 × 3 cm2) with a catalyst loading of 0.3 mg cm−2. In this study, the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following equation: E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 − pH + 0.197. Before the electrochemical tests, O2 was purged into 1.0 M KOH solution for 30 min. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with iR-corrected. The following Tafel equation was used to calculate the Tafel slope: η = blog(j/j0), where η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, j is the current density and j0 is the exchange current density. CV measurements in the non-faradaic region from 1.10 to 1.20 at scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 mV s−1 were performed to investigate the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), where the capacitive current ΔJ (Ja − Jc) at 1.15 V is the width of the CV taken at 1.15 V of the various scan rates. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 1 Hz with a 10 mV AC signal amplitude using a PAR-STAT 2273 test system. To evaluate the catalyst durability, chronopotentiometry testing was performed at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2.
Results and discussion
Formation of CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300
The synthetic process of CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 heterostructures is demonstrated in Scheme 1. CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66 resulted from the respective ultrasonic impregnation of Co and Ni ions into UiO-66 at room temperature, followed by thermal treatment at 300 °C. The resulting product comprised a unique heterostructure of UiO-66 support and incorporated CoOx for (CoOx/UiO-66-300) and NiO for (NiO/UiO-66-300). Interestingly, the prepared CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 maintained the inherent morphology and structure of UiO-66, thus explaining why this strategy was employed. The choice of UiO-66 support was made due to its chemical and thermal stability followed by its ability to impregnate active species, while Co and Ni were chosen due to their optimum bond strength and active sites which show the bonding with intermediates, making them suitable for the OER.

Characterization of catalysts
The morphology of the prepared samples was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images of UiO-66-300, CoOx/UiO-66-300, and NiO/UiO-66-300 are shown in Fig. 1(a–c). Fig. 1(a) shows that the SEM image of UiO-66-300 has a square-like shape without any variation in morphology. In Fig. 1(b and c), the SEM images of CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 also maintain the same morphology as UiO-66-300, and no aggregation or morphological variation of CoOx and NiO is observed after being encapsulated. HRTEM analysis was further carried out to investigate the structure of NiO/UiO-66-300 and the effect of the incorporated NiO on the UiO-66-300 structure. Fig. 1d shows the dispersed particles of the incorporated NiO on the UiO-66 framework with an interplanar distance of 0.203 nm (Fig. 1(e)). As evidenced in Fig. 1(e), there are no broken fringes after NiO was incorporated, suggesting that NiO did not affect the structure of the UiO-66. The EDS mapping analysis shown in Fig. 1(f–j) reveals the existence of C, O, Ni, and Zr in NiO/UiO-66-300. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) are used to investigate the purity and crystallinity of the as-synthesized materials as shown in Fig. 2(a). The XRD patterns of pristine UiO-66 MOF show that all the diffraction peaks matched well with the simulated pattern of UiO-66. The XRD patterns of UiO-66-300 also indicate that the diffraction peaks are indexed to UiO-66. The XRD peaks of pristine UiO-66 and UiO-66-300 clearly show no additional peaks for impurity, implying the purity of UiO-66 without any contamination. The CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 XRD patterns showed that the diffraction peaks are indexed to UiO-66. This indicates that the incorporation of CoOx and NiO did not collapse the UiO-66 framework during the synthesis of CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300.

The surface area of UiO-66-300, CoOx/UiO-66-300, and NiO/UiO-66-300 was investigated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements to determine the surface area of the prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of CoOx/UiO-66-300, NiO/UiO-66-300, and UiO-66-300 displayed type IV characteristics. The density functional theory calculation shows a specific surface area of 1004.1 m2 g−1 for CoOx/UiO-66-300, 1004.3 m2 g−1 for NiO/UiO-66-300 and 1179.1 m2 g−1 for UiO-66-300. This suggests that the specific surface area of UiO-66-MOF was maintained after the incorporation of CoOx and NiO, respectively. As demonstrated in Fig. 2(c), the survey analysis of XPS reveals the presence of C, O, Zr, and Co elements. The high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra corresponding to CoOx/UiO-66-300 display the coexistence of Co3+ and Co2+ followed by two satellite peaks. Fig. 2(d) also shows the presence of C, O, Zr, and Ni elements. The high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectra corresponding to NiO/UiO-66-300 display the presence of two ionic Ni followed by two satellite peaks (Fig. S1, ESI†).
Electrochemical activity of CoOx/UiO-66-300 and Ni/UiO-66-300 heterostructures
A standard three-electrode system was used to carry out the OER in 1.0 M aqueous KOH. For the OER assessment, the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is the standard criterion. Fig. 3(a and b) show that the overpotential needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 varies among the prepared samples. For example, CoOx/UiO-66-300 requires an overpotential of 283 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, while NiO/UiO-66-300, UiO-66-300, and the commercial IrO2 require the overpotentials of 291.6 mV, 416.6 mV, and 388.9 mV, respectively, to reach a current density of 10 mV. The superior OER performance of CoOx/UiO-66-300 over NiO/UiO-66-300 demonstrates that the interface of CoOx/UiO-66-300 provides a more optimized active site for the adsorption/desorption of oxy–hydroxide (M–OOH) since M–OOH is a key intermediate in the OER process in an alkaline medium. Also, it is important to note that the weaker activity of UiO-66-300 implies the insufficient OER active sites, confirming that the introduced active sites caused an increase in electron transfer at the CoOx/UiO-66-300 interface and also at the NiO/UiO-66-300 interface which enhanced the OER activity. The OER performance comparisons of some recently published heterostructure catalysts are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). To further evaluate the performance of the prepared catalysts via an inherent method of analyzing catalytic kinetics, the Tafel equation (η = blogj + a, where j is the current density, η is the overpotential and b is the Tafel slope) was used to fit the Tafel plots. Fig. 3(c) shows that the Tafel slope of CoOx/UiO-66-300 (118.91 mV dec−1) is lower than that of NiO/UiO-66-300 (122.92 mV dec−1), UiO-66-300 (264.09 mV dec−1), and the commercial IrO2 (128.90 mV dec−1), thus confirming the fast OER kinetics of CoOx/UiO-66-300. This result shows that the introduced CoOx and NiO, respectively, enhanced the water oxidation at the interface. Also, the enhanced water oxidation was due to the facilitation of electron transfer at the interface of the heterostructure, which can be attributed to the additional OER active sites introduced by the CoOx and NiO nanoparticles. It can also be pointed out that the endowed UiO-66 morphology maintained by the prepared catalyst (CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300) also contributed to the improved OER activity.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to measure the interfacial charge transfer resistance of the prepared samples at an external bias of 0.688 V vs. Ag/AgCl. It is demonstrated in Fig. 3(d) that CoOx/UiO-66-300 displayed a slightly smaller semi-circle than NiO/UiO-66-300, compared to UiO-66-300 that displayed a bigger semi-circle. This implies that CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 have small charge transfer resistances compared to UiO-66-300 with a bigger charge transfer resistance. The smaller semi-circle of CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 can be attributed to the rapid charge transfer that occurs at the electrode/electrolyte interface of the CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300, leading to a reduced charge resistance.35,36 This result is also in line with the LSV and Tafel slope results. As shown in Fig. 3(e), various tests of CV measurements at the scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 mV s−1 in the non-faradaic region from 1.10 to 1.20 were carried out to investigate the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) which is directly proportional to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The capacitive currents ΔJ (Ja − Jc) at 1.15 V against the various scan rates were fitted to obtain the Cdl by estimating the slope of the capacitive current. Compared to NiO/UiO-66-300 (27.3 mF cm−2) and UiO-66-300 (21.5 mF cm−2), CoOx/UiO-66-300 (29.4 mF cm−2) showed a larger ECSA. This suggests the increased catalytically exposed OER active sites at the interface due to the UiO-66 and CoOx coupling.
For practical application purposes, the durability and long-term stability of catalysts are important factors. Fig. 4(a) shows the evaluation of the long-term stability of CoOx/UiO-66-300 after 1000 CV cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. It reveals that the overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 after 1000 CV cycles only increased by 9 mV, indicating the high OER stability of the catalyst. Further investigation of the CoOx/UiO-66-300 durability was carried out at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 as shown in Fig. 4(b). After 36000 s of continuous testing, CoOx/UiO-66-300 maintained 96% of its initial activity, thus confirming its durability.

The outstanding performance of the prepared heterostructures with the UiO-66-retained framework can be attributed to many factors. (i) The maintained architecture of UiO-66 by the heterostructures (CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300) enhanced the access of electrolytes to active sites and the evolution of oxygen gas due to the highly ordered porosity in the UiO-66 framework. (ii) The thermal treatment condition of CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 contributed to their morphology and architecture which achieved a good OER performance. This is confirmed by comparing the OER performance of CoOx/UiO-66-300 that was thermally treated at 300 °C with the performance of CoOx/UiO-66-550 that was thermally treated at 550 °C as shown in Fig. 6(a). (iii) The constructed interface of the heterostructures added more channels that facilitate charge and mass transfer, thus resulting in an optimum contact between the electrolytes and active sites. This is demonstrated in the result obtained from EIS (Fig. 3(d)), which shows the rapid charge transfer that occurs at the electrode/electrolyte interface. (iv) In the heterostructure with an endowed synergistic interface between the CoOx and UiO-66-300 coupling, UiO-66-300 enhances conductivity by ensuring the transfer of electrons while CoOx provides sufficient active sites. This is demonstrated in Fig. 3(a) which shows the poor performance of bare UiO-66-300 due to the insufficient OER active sites. (v) Studies from the literature report that Co3O4 has a narrower bandgap of 1.6 eV,37–41 compared to NiO and UiO-66 with wider bandgaps of 3.6 to 4.0 eV for NiO42,43 and 4.0 eV for UiO-66.44–46 This suggests that for the CoOx/UiO-66-300 heterostructure, the difference in the bandgap of both components created a strong electric field at the heterointerface which facilitated interfacial reaction kinetics, increased conductivity, and charge transport that enhanced the OER activity. Although the NiO/UiO-66-300 heterostructure possesses well-exposed active sites as the CoOx/UiO-66-300 heterostructure, the difference in the bandgap of NiO and UiO-66-300 created a weaker electric field at the heterointerface with reduced interfacial reaction kinetics, conductivity, and charge transport, giving rise to a lower OER activity compared to the CoOx/UiO-66-300 heterostructure. (vi) Notably, the narrower bandgap, robust interfacial interaction that exists between CoOx and UiO-66, large surface area, and ordered porosity provided by UiO-66 can be attributed to the enhanced OER activity and stability.
We summarize that the enhanced OER performance can be attributed to the architecture of the heterostructures with the UiO-66-retained framework, large surface area, highly ordered porosity inherited by CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300, the well-exposed active sites at the interface, increased mass transport of ions/gas due to the increased catalytically active OER active sites at the interface, and the modulated interfacial electronic structure.
Characterization of CoOx/UiO-66-550
UiO-66 incorporated CoOx under thermal treatment at 550 °C was characterized to determine the effect of high temperature on the morphology, structure, and surface area of the prepared heterostructure. Fig. 5(b) reveals that the SEM image of CoOx/UiO-66-550 shows disordered aggregated particles, which is different from the morphology of UiO-66-300. This demonstrates that the UiO-66-MOF was not stable when thermally treated at 550 °C, thus leading to the collapse of the UiO-66 framework at 550 °C. The X-ray diffraction patterns in Fig. 5(c) reveal the detection of several peaks belonging to Co3O4 (PDF #78-1969), ZrO2 (PDF #86-1450), and ZrO2 (PDF #79-1767). These peaks do not match well with the UiO-66 peaks, indicating a structural change due to the collapsed UiO-66 framework. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement of CoOx/UiO-66-550 in Fig. 5(d) reveals a significant decrease in the specific surface area. The decrease in the specific surface area can be attributed to the loss of UiO-66 features due to the collapsed framework as evidenced in the SEM and XRD analyses of CoOx/UiO-66-550.

Electrochemical activity of CoOx/UiO-66-550 and NiO/UiO-66-550 heterostructures
According to the LSV test of CoOx/UiO-66-550, 332.6 mV is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is however higher than the overpotential of CoOx/UiO-66-300 (Fig. 6(a and b)). The increase in the overpotential value can be attributed to the collapsed UiO-66 framework which resulted in the Co3O4/ZrO2 heterostructure with a reduced specific surface area and a decreased electron transfer. The same applies to NiO/UiO-66-550 which requires an overpotential of 346.6 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Fig. 6(c) reveals that there is an increase in the Tafel slope of CoOx/UiO-66-550 (286.24 mV dec−1), thus implying a decrease in the OER reaction kinetics. It can be stated that the Co3O4 and ZrO2 coupling provided a reduced electron transfer at the interface and a reduced specific surface area compared to CoOx/UiO-66-300. CoOx/UiO-66-550 and NiO/UiO-66-550 showed an increase in interfacial charge resistance when the EIS was performed to determine their ion diffusion kinetics. A larger semi-circle was recorded for both CoOx/UiO-66-550 (Fig. 6(d)) and NiO/UiO-66-550 (Fig. S3, ESI†) heterostructures compared to the smaller semi-circles of CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 heterostructures. This result is in agreement with the LSV result recorded for CoOx/UiO-66-550. The CV measurement of the ECSA of CoOx/UiO-66-550 (28.3 mF cm−2) reveals a decrease in the electrochemically active surface area for the OER compared to CoOx/UiO-66-300 (29.4 mF cm−2). This indicates that the number of catalytically active sites exposed for the OER in CoOx/UiO-66-550 reduced, compared to CoOx/UiO-66-300 with more exposed OER catalytic active sites. The ECSA of NiO/UiO-66-550 (25.6 mF cm−2) also reveals a decrease in the electrochemically active surface area when compared to NiO/UiO-66-300 (27.3 mF cm−2) as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).

The decreased performance of the UiO-66-derived heterostructures (CoOx/UiO-66-550 and NiO/UiO-66-550) can be attributed to the loss of MOF features from the collapsed UiO-66 framework leading to reduced porosity and specific surface area of the resulting heterostructures. The reduced specific surface area and porosity decreased the exposed active sites at the interface and channels for mass transport of ions, thus resulting in reduced electron transfer in the reaction kinetics.
Conclusion
We have successfully prepared CoOx/UiO-66-300 and NiO/UiO-66-300 heterostructures that retained UiO-66 frameworks through ultrasonic impregnation of Co2+ and Ni2+ ions into the UiO-66 framework. The thermal treatment temperature was used as the key factor in the preparation of the unique heterostructures. The incorporated CoOx and NiO provided the OER active sites while UiO-66 enhanced the conductivity. The modulation of electronic charge and the interfacial interaction between the UiO-66 and the incorporated CoOx/NiO increased the mass/charge transfer to enhance the OER performance. The OER performance of the heterostructure with endowed UiO-66-inherent frameworks was superior to that of the UiO-66-derived heterostructure (Co3O4/ZrO2). In 1 M KOH, CoOx/UiO-66-300 (283.6 mV) and NiO/UiO-66-300 (291.6 mV) showed better OER activities compared to CoOx/UiO-66-550 (332.6 mV) and NiO/UiO-66-550 (346.6 mV). This work provides a strategy for preparing heterostructures with MOF-retained frameworks for energy applications.
