    , Accepted 6th August 2019First published on 6th August 2019AbstractLimited fossil resources require innovative monomers and polymers derived from renewable feedstocks such as plant biomass. Thermosetting epoxy resins largely rely on petrochemical bisphenol-type monomers, which give high performance materials but are controversial due to their effects on human health. Herein, we present two biobased epoxy resins by direct dehydrogenative dimerization of eugenol, the main component of clove oil. Taking the Principles of Green Chemistry into account, we developed electrochemical dehydrodimerization at reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) electrodes using methanol as environmentally benign solvent. Thus, fluorinated solvents such as 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) or commonly used oxidizers such as potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]) are avoided and a high reaction mass efficiency (RME) of 47% is obtained. Alkylation and epoxidation gave two epoxy resins MDDE-2E and ADDE-4E with 2 and 4 epoxy functionalities, respectively. Curing with MHHPA gave durable epoxy materials with Tg's of 153 °C for MDDE-2E (for DGEBA: 151 °C) and an extraordinary 216 °C for ADDE-4E, reflecting the increased network density of the cured epoxy material. Thermal degradation under nitrogen and air was observed at temperatures above 300 °C with T10% of 304 and 347 °C, respectively. In contrast to DGEBA, high char rates and slower degradation above 400 °C indicate flame-retarding properties of the eugenol-derived epoxy resins.
Introduction
The awareness of man-made chemical pollution, resource depletion and changing global climate due to increased greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere has caused chemists to re-assess their responsibilities towards reducing their environmental impacts and developing sustainable strategies that take into account the needs of future generations. The most recognized framework is the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry developed by Anastas and Warner,1 which focus on the elimination of waste and harmful chemicals, the substitution of limited fossil resources by renewable feedstocks, energy efficiency and operational safety.2 Companies worldwide launched the Responsible Care Global Charter, a voluntary commitment to improve health, safety and environmental aspects in the chemical industry, probably also with the incentive to improve reputation and preempt stricter government regulation.3 To avoid the depletion of limited petrochemical resources, plant biomass is used as a generally non-toxic, sustainable alternative for the preparation of monomers and polymers.4 A versatile class of polymers are thermosetting epoxy resins.5,6 They exhibit good compatibility with mechanical stress, elevated temperatures, and excellent adhesion properties with applications inter alia in coatings, adhesives and composites.7 The market for thermosetting epoxy materials largely relies on petrochemical bisphenol-type monomers. The most commonly used component, bisphenol A, shows activity as an endocrine disruptor and is classified as a reprotoxic substance.8 Biobased alternatives are therefore investigated in order to provide sustainable alternatives with similar or even superior thermomechanical properties.9
A broad variety of natural resources are used to prepare epoxy resins: vegetable oils (mostly linseed, soybean, and castor oil),10 carbohydrates11 or fermentation products thereof such as itaconic acid,12 tannins,13 rosin,14 and lignin.15 Epoxy resins derived from aliphatic feedstocks often result in mechanically inferior, low Tg materials with poor dimensional stability as for vegetable oil-based epoxies, or are difficult to process, e.g. high melting rosin-based epoxies. Superior characteristics are generally obtained using biobased aromatic starting materials such as cardanol,16 vanillin,17 ferulic acid or eugenol.18
Eugenol accounts for 80–90% of clove bud or cinnamon leaf oil and is commonly used as a fragrance and flavoring agent in food products.19 While eugenol as a plant extract is a limited resource, the depolymerization of abundant and commonly thermally utilized lignin is a promising strategy to access large amounts of eugenol from lignocellulosic biomass.20 The phenylpropanoid structure exhibiting a terminal olefin and a phenolic hydroxyl group provides the key building block in the preparation of various thermosetting resins: ruthenium-catalyzed metathesis gives access to a bisphenol dicyanate used in thermosetting polycyanurates and polycarbonates.21 Ether-22 and esterification23 as well as silylation24 lead to a conjugation of two eugenol-moieties providing two epoxy functionalities for efficient cross-linking of the resins. The preparation of a phosphoric acid triester with eugenol increases the number of reactive epoxy functionalities and shows inherent flame retarding properties.25 Formaldehyde condensation of eugenol gives di- or oligomerized novolak-type polyglycidyl resins that are cured in thiol/ene and thiol/epoxy-maleimide reactions.26
Most of these resins rely on aliphatic linkages between eugenol units, which add flexibility to the corresponding materials, giving inferior mechanical properties or processability compared to the rigid bisphenol-based resins. Therefore, we chose the direct dehydrogenative dimerization of eugenol as a more sustainable alternative to rigid biphenol epoxy precursors (Fig. 1). Conventional oxidative homo-coupling of eugenol was achieved by oxidizing agents such as potassium ferricyanide (K3[FeCN6]) or potassium permanganate, generating large amounts of reagent waste. In contrast, oxidative homo-coupling of phenols by electric current is particularly favorable with respect to the aforementioned Principles of Green Chemistry as electrons are used as reagents and only hydrogen gas is released as a valuable by-product. Renewable energy production by solar or wind power makes preparative electrosynthesis a highly sustainable method.27,28

In recent years, we developed electrochemical arylation reactions of phenols and anilines as a versatile method to efficiently access phenol–arene,29 phenol–phenol,30 phenol–aniline,31 and aniline–aniline32 motifs by direct dehydrogenative homo- and cross-coupling reaction. This step-economic approach avoids leaving functionalities, templating moieties and complex catalysts to control the selectivity33 and is inherently safe as after switching off electricity, no reactive species is generated. 1,1,1,3,3,3-Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as a unique solvent provides not only a particularly wide potential window, but also has the ability to stabilize reactive intermediates such as radicals or cations.34 In addition, larger π-systems can be protected by solvates from overoxidation.35 Consequently, this is the solvent of choice for such transformations. Although HFIP is largely recovered, it remains expensive, volatile (b.p. 59 °C, vapour pressure 16 kPa at 20 °C), corrosive and therefore unfavourable for technical and sustainable applications. Hence, we chose methanol as an economically and ecologically benign substitute for the dehydrogenative dimerization of eugenol.
Herein, we report an efficient electrochemical synthesis of dehydrodieugenol as an epoxy resin precursor and the preparation of biobased epoxy resins thereof. These renewable epoxy resins of varying epoxy content are then cured with anhydrides and their thermomechanical properties are compared to bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA).
Results and discussion
Electrochemical dehydrodimerization of eugenol
The dehydrodieugenol scaffold is of high interest and is the backbone of biobased aromatic monomers such as bismaleimide resins. It is commonly prepared by oxidative coupling of eugenol using iron(III) chloride or potassium ferricyanide.36,37 The use of stoichiometric amounts of oxidizers and the tedious workup yielding high amounts of inorganic salts call for a more sustainable approach. An enzymatic approach was reported by Llevot et al., giving dehydrodieugenol in good yields (>85%).38 The laccase-catalyzed dimerization relies on oxygen as a terminal oxidant and requires the addition of relatively expensive purified enzymes. Therefore, we considered an electrosynthetic protocol that uses inexpensive and reusable carbon-based electrodes and abundant and potentially sustainable electric current for the oxidative dehydrodimerization of eugenol.
A galvanostatic electrolysis in an undivided cell is particularly favorable as it provides operational simplicity with regard to the power source (providing constant direct current) and the cell setup without the need for a reference electrode, as well as ensuring scalability of the process.28 Starting from earlier reported conditions in alkaline methanol using glassy carbon (GC) electrodes,39 we used sodium hydroxide as a base and sodium perchlorate as the supporting electrolyte (Table 1, entry 1). As an electrode material, we chose reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foam.40 This rigid, lightweight high surface glassy carbon has excellent conductivity properties and is used in electrosynthesis to increase space-time yields.41 In this case, reticulated vitreous carbon not only reduced the electrolysis time by providing a higher surface and higher currents, but also facilitated purification by generating less by-products. Subsequently, the low substrate concentration and relatively large amounts of supporting electrolyte had to be addressed to improve sustainability. However, an increase of substrate concentration led to a decrease in yield which could not be compensated by increasing amounts of applied charge (entries 2 and 3). Without the addition of the supporting electrolyte, severe electrode passivation was observed (entry 4). As sodium perchlorate as a supporting electrolyte is unfavourable due to its ability to form less soluble, explosive perchlorate salts42 and its environmental and health hazards,43 it was substituted by methyl tributylammonium methyl sulfate (MTBS), an inexpensive and readily accessible technical ammonium salt (entry 5).

By increasing the amount of charge, isolated yields up to 80% of dehydrodieugenol were obtained (entries 6 and 7). A reduced electrolyte concentration of 0.01 M gave identical results (entry 8). Unfortunately, higher substrate concentrations led to lower yields (entry 9) and highly polar by-products from over-oxidation. An increase in the concentration of base led to incomplete conversion of the starting material, indicating a solvent oxidation side reaction. We found a sufficiently strong base (pKa ≥ 11 of conjugated acid) crucial. This indicates that the phenolate of eugenol is the oxidized species (see Fig. S4 and S5†), forming a radical cation which subsequently reacts with a second phenolate. A second anodic oxidation and deprotonation yields the dehydrodieugenol. Identical biphenol yields were obtained using 5% piperidine in methanol or 2 equivalents of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, both without the need for an additional supporting electrolyte (Table S1†). For ecological and economic reasons, we favour the use of sodium hydroxide and MTBS as the supporting electrolyte. By this protocol, dehydrodieugenol is obtained as a single low-molecular weight product in high purity as judged by GC-MS and LC-MS.
The scale-up of the electrolysis required the design of an RVC-glassy carbon stacked cell, which is safer in operation and more durable than previously reported setups.41 The fragile porous material RVC was therefore embedded in PTFE frames and contacted by a thin metal sheet (Fig. 2). This allows a stacked arrangement of RVC anodes and provides a durable electrode setup under rapid stirring and cleaning of the electrodes. Using two RVC anodes and three glassy carbon counter electrodes, dehydrodimerization was conducted on a multi-gram scale in 150 mL and 600 mL electrolysis volume with no significant changes in yield (79% and 73%, respectively, Table S2†). The crude dehydrodieugenol was already obtained in high purity after aqueous extractive workup, which was considerably cleaner than when using K3[Fe(CN)6] as the oxidizer. Traces of highly polar by-products, most likely from over-oxidation and polymerization at the anode, were observed by TLC. Dehydrodieugenol was obtained by crystallization from cyclohexane, so that there is no need for chromatographic purification and further scale-up of the process is viable.

While yield is generally a good indicator of efficiency, more elaborate metrics are needed to quantify the sustainability of a chemical process. Therefore, we compared our electrochemical dehydrogenative dimerization of eugenol to the use of potassium ferricyanide as an oxidizer (Table S3†). The direct dehydrogenative coupling generating only hydrogen as the by-product shows an inherently high atom economy (AE)44 of >99%. The waste-oriented E-factor (total waste in kg per kg product) as proposed by Roger Sheldon is 63 and 53, respectively, and is already in the range for industrial fine chemical production.45 As the electrochemical reaction is limited in starting material concentration in the given solvent, the improvement in sustainability by reagent reducing waste is not represented in this metric. If complete recycling of the organic solvents is assumed, the anodic oxidation is clearly favourable (E-factor of 9 and 37). Finally, the reaction mass efficiency (RME) developed at GlaxoSmithKline combines the atom economy, yield and stoichiometry of all reactants.46 With an RME of 47%, the electrochemical process is significantly more sustainable when using K3[Fe(CN)6] as the oxidizer (RME of 11%). In conclusion, quantitative assessment of the dehydro-dimerization clearly reveals the benefits of our electrochemical approach in terms of sustainability.
Eugenol as a plant essential oil is natural. Besides having a variety of beneficial nutraceutical properties,47 it is considered a weak skin sensitizer.48 The dehydrodimer DDE is known to have an even lower skin sensitizing ability and lower cytotoxic effects49 than eugenol. These data support dehydrodieugenol as a promising alternative to bisphenol A, although a further evaluation of toxicology is needed.
Preparation of epoxy monomers
With a sustainable access to dehydrodieugenol (DDE) being established, we prepared two epoxy resins with two and four reactive oxirane moieties (Scheme 1): dimethylation of the biphenol DDE and subsequent epoxidation of the dimethyl ether MDDE gave difunctional epoxy resin MDDE-2E in high yields, while diallylation increased the resulting epoxy functionalities to four (epoxidation of ADDE to ADDE-4E). In contrast to former reports using high-boiling solvents (DMF, DMSO),37,50,51 the alkylations were conducted in acetone as an environmentally preferred solvent,52 giving the alkylated biphenols MDDE and ADDE in excellent yields. More importantly, this optimized procedure avoids any chromatographic purification and therefore greatly reduces the amounts of solvents and waste. For this reason, we favoured an epoxidation protocol using 2-butanone and potassium peroxomonosulfate,53 commonly obtained as a triple salt oxone (2 KHSO5·KHSO4·K2SO4) and frequently used in pool care or as a bleaching agent. The benign solvent, inexpensive and abundant oxidizer and simple extractive workup make it a practical and sustainable protocol. Routinely used epoxidation agents such as m-CPBA25 gave inferior results and required a large excess of expensive peracid and purification by column chromatography. The preparation of diepoxide MDDE-2E has not been reported so far, while tetraepoxide ADDE-4E was just recently communicated with application in thiol-epoxy materials.50 For both epoxy monomers, we are the first to present the curing with anhydrides to thermosetting epoxy materials and a comparison of those materials with regard to their thermomechanical properties. Both epoxy resins are viscous liquids at ambient conditions and therefore easily processed.

Curing of the epoxy resins with anhydrides
Formulations of epoxy resins with amines or cyclic anhydrides are thermally cured to give durable epoxy materials. For materials with particularly high temperature resistance, cyclic anhydrides are used as cross-linking agents.54 We chose methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) as a common and commercially available curing agent to compare the thermomechanical performance of the prepared epoxy resins. To evaluate the curing characteristics, the non-isothermal curing processes of the eugenol-derived di-epoxide (MDDE-2) and tetra-epoxide (ADDE-4E) as well as the commercially available DGEBA as reference were monitored by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Resin and curing agents were thoroughly mixed in a 1:1 ratio of epoxy/anhydride functionalities, ensuring a complete reaction of all epoxy functionalities. As the initiator, 1 wt% 2-ethyl-4-methyl imidazole was used in all epoxy/anhydride reagent mixtures. Scans were performed under nitrogen atmosphere from 50–200 °C (Fig. 3). All three showed a single exothermic peak, which corresponds to the predominant curing reaction of ring-opening of the epoxide moieties by carboxylates and further reaction of the alcoholates with cyclic anhydrides in an oxo-anionic copolymerization.55 The quantitative comparison of the reactivity was achieved by determination of the apparent curing activation energies. Therefore, DSC scans were conducted at heating rates of 2, 5, 10 and 20 °C min−1, respectively (Fig. S6†). The activation energies Ea were determined by the Kissinger method56 following eqn (1): (1)
 Fig. 3  Curing of eugenol epoxies MDDE-2E and ADDE-4E as well as DGEBA with MHHPA characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at 10 °C min−1. 
The eugenol-derived diepoxide MDDE-2E showed a slightly lower activation energy for the curing reaction with MHHPA compared to DGEBA (71 and 76 kJ mol−1, Table 2). This difference in reactivity corresponds to the structural epoxy motifs, the glycidyl ether in DGEBA and the epoxidized allyl moieties in MDDE-2E. The tetraepoxide ADDE-4E contains both types of epoxy functionalities and lies in between with an Ea of 74 kJ mol−1, as the DSC curves indicate.

Test specimens for mechanical testing were prepared in a silicon mold. Epoxy resin, anhydride curing agent MHHPA and initiator were thoroughly mixed at 50 °C, degassed and poured into the cavities. Curing for 3 h at 80 °C and 2 h at 120 °C followed by a post-cure for 1 h at 160 °C resulted in largely cured epoxy materials as judged by DSC as no exothermal peak was observed. The elevated temperature of 160 °C ensured complete curing of the materials and allowed for the release of stress accumulated during cross-linking.
Mechanical properties
Dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA) of the test specimen in a dual cantilever setup were performed in a temperature range of 20–250 °C (Fig. 4). An epoxy/anhydride ratio of 1:0.8 proved beneficial for the thermomechanical stability of the corresponding materials, as epoxy homo-polymerization occurred especially at high epoxide conversion.5 A clear transition from the thermoset glassy state to the viscoelastic state was observed for each epoxy resin. The storage moduli at 25 °C and the glass transition temperatures Tg, which were determined from the peak of the loss factor tand, are shown in Table 2. The prepared eugenol-derived epoxy materials showed a higher storage moduli at 25 °C than for DGEBA. While the glass transitions of MDDE-2E and DGEBA were almost identical with Tgs of 151 and 153 °C, respectively, the tetraepoxide ADDE-4E showed an extraordinary mechanical stability at temperatures up to 200 °C. A broad maximum of the damping curve was observed for this epoxy resin with a Tg at 216 °C. The decreased intensity of the tand peak indicates an increased cross-linking density caused by the two additional glycidyl moieties.57
 Fig. 4  Storage modulus and tan d curves for eugenol-based epoxies and DGEBA. 
Thermal stability
The thermal stability of the cured epoxy materials was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Fig. 5 shows the TGA thermograms under nitrogen and air atmosphere. All three epoxy resins exhibited high thermal stability up to 300 °C. Up to 400 °C, DGEBA gave superior results (Table 3) in thermal stability. Above 400 °C, rapid charring under N2 and subsequent decomposition under air was observed. The highly cross-linked tetraepoxide ADDE-4E showed only slightly inferior stability up to 400 °C, followed by MDDE-2E. Notably, both eugenol-based resins led to high amounts of charred residue under nitrogen atmosphere (27 and 20%). This correlates to the thermally labile glycidyl ether linkages in the epoxy materials with DGEBA being the least stable. On the other hand, at temperatures above 420 °C, MDDE-2E barely decomposes anymore as it has a fully carbon-based monomer backbone. This property could be of interest in flame retardant applications. The TGA under air atmosphere shows a similar degradation curve up to 500 °C, followed by a rapid complete decomposition of all materials.

Conclusions
Dehydrodieugenol, a biobased biphenol, is prepared by electrochemical dehydrogenative coupling of eugenol using methanol as environmentally benign solvent. This high-yielding and scalable protocol has a high reaction mass efficiency (RME) of 47% and is therefore particularly sustainable as the use of electric current replaces conventional oxidizers and therefore greatly reduces reagent waste.
Starting from dehydrodieugenol, two epoxy resins were prepared in a simple two-step alkylation and epoxidation protocol, giving epoxy resins with two and four reactive oxirane functionalities without the need for chromatographic purification. After curing of these resins with MHHPA as the anhydride curing agent under identical conditions, the eugenol-based materials showed notably higher stiffness at ambient temperatures than DGEBA-based materials. Diepoxide MDDE-2E and DGEBA led to materials with identical glass transition temperature, while the increased cross-linking of tetraepoxide ADDE-4E led to an extraordinarily stable material with a Tg of 216 °C. Although thermal decomposition of the eugenol-derived materials started earlier than for DGEBA-based epoxies, initial decomposition temperatures above 300 °C and high char rates greater than 20% under N2 atmosphere imply above average thermal stability. Hence, the dehydrodieugenol scaffold is a promising alternative to petrochemical bisphenol A and may find application in biobased composite materials with increased mechanical stability and potentially flame retarding properties.

Electrochemical setup
Electrochemical experiments were conducted in undivided beaker-type cells equipped with a heating jacket and using RVC as anode material and glassy carbon cathodes (see the ESI† for details).

General procedure for the anodic dehydrodimerization of eugenol to 5,5′-diallyl-3,3′-dimethoxy-2,2′-biphenol (dehydro-dieugenol, DDE). 
Eugenol (2.46 g, 15 mmol), sodium hydroxide (1.20 g, 30 mmol) and MTBS (0.47 g, 1.5 mmol) were dissolved in 135 mL methanol and 15 mL H2O and transferred to an undivided beaker-type cell equipped with a stacked electrode arrangement of RVC anodes and glassy carbon cathodes (see Fig. S2 and 3†). Under vigorous stirring, a current of 122 mA was applied until a charge of 1.5 F (2171 C) had passed. The solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and H2O (50 mL) was added and adjusted to pH 3 by addition of aqueous HCl (10%). The aqueous layer was extracted three times with EtOAc (50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4.

General procedure for the epoxidation of DDE derivatives
The alkene (MDDE or ADDE, 25 mmol) was dissolved in 2-butanone (50 mL) and water (12.5 mL). Sodium hydrogen carbonate (21 g, 250 mmol, 10 eq.) and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (2.55 g, 7.5 mmol, 0.3 eq.) were added. Over the course of 10 min, oxone (8.3 g, 25 mmol) in H2O (45 mL) was added under vigorous stirring. After 30 min of efficient stirring, the addition of aqueous oxone solution was repeated three times until a total amount of 33.3 g oxone was added. The resulting reaction mixture was diluted with H2O and extracted twice with diethyl ether (200 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with H2O and brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. To ensure conversion to the corresponding di- and tetraepoxides in high yields, the epoxidation procedure was repeated.
Following the general procedure, MDDE diepoxide (MDDE-2E) was obtained in 88% yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) = 6.82 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H), 6.74 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H), 3.90 (s, 6H), 3.64 (s, 6H), 3.17 (tdd, J = 5.7, 3.9, 2.7 Hz, 2H), 2.91–2.76 (m, 7H), 2.57 (dd, J = 5.0, 2.7 Hz, 2H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 152.4, 145.3, 132.3, 132.1, 123.2, 112.2, 60.5, 55.7, 52.3, 46.7, 38.4. HR-MS (ESI): 409.1622 calcd for C22H26O6Na+, 409.1629 found [M + Na+].
Following the general procedure, ADDE tetraepoxide (ADDE-4E) was obtained in 81% yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm) = 6.81 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H), 6.77 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 2H), 3.96–3.82 (m, 12H), 3.21–3.11 (m, 2H), 3.09–2.99 (m, 2H), 2.84–2.78 (m, 7H), 2.67–2.60 (m, 2H), 2.56 (dd, J = 5.0, 2.7 Hz, 2H), 2.43–2.35 (m, 2H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 152.5, 144.4, 132.8, 132.5, 123.7, 112.6, 73.9, 56.0, 52.6, 50.6, 47.0, 44.8, 38.7.
