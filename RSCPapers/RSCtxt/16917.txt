    , Accepted 15th November 2021First published on 16th November 2021AbstractHighly-active heterojunctions hold the pivotal function in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Ta3N5@ReS2 photocatalysts are rationally designed via the combination of template-assisted, hydrothermal and solution–adsorption processes, in which few-layered ReS2 nanosheets are anchored on hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres with intimate contact for charge transfer. The photocatalytic H2 production rate of Ta3N5@ReS2 heterojunctions reaches 739.4 μmol g−1 h−1, which is ∼16 times higher than that of the bulk Ta3N5 counterpart, and superior to those of Ta3N5-based photocatalysts ever reported. According to the experimental results and theory calculation, it is proposed that such designed Ta3N5@ReS2 heterojunctions could be highly effective for enhancing the absorptivity of light, improving charge separation and transfer, as well as increasing edge active sites for HER, thus leading to the promoted H2-evolution kinetics.
Introduction
With the overuse of fossil fuels, the energy crisis and environmental issues are becoming more and more serious and thus is highly urgent to develop clean and renewable energy resources to replace fossil fuels.1–3 Hydrogen (H2) is widely believed as one of the most promising energy sources for substituted fossil fuels because of the high energy density and zero pollution emission.4–8 Among the existing H2 production technologies, photocatalytic water splitting to produce H2 is known to be one of the most prospective and compelling avenues and one of the key requirements is developing efficient photocatalysts in this field.9–17 Encouraged by the first report on photocatalytic hydrogen production using TiO2 in 1972, considerable studies have been devoted to designing stable and efficient photocatalysts for achieving high “solar-to-H2” (STH) conversion efficiencies.2,18
Over the past decades, many efforts have been devoted to developing semiconductor photocatalysts with narrow bandgap and efficient charge separation and transfer, such as g-C3N4, CdS, and Ta3N5.8,17,19–21 Amongst, Ta3N5 has been considered as one of the promising photocatalysts for H2 generation due to its appropriate band structures, narrower band gap (2.1 eV), wider light absorption region and high theoretical STH efficiency (15.9%).22–26 However, bulk Ta3N5 based photocatalysts often have some serious shortcomings, including their small specific surface area, poor electrical conductivity, rapid photogenerated carrier recombination and slow surface dynamics, which greatly inhibit their application as an efficient photocatalyst.25,26 Typically, it is well-known that the activity of a photocatalyst is greatly dependent on its methodology. In this regard, one of the efficient solutions to overcome obstacles is to prepare Ta3N5 with special nanostructures, because they can ensure the accessibility of active sites, improve the mass transfer and minimize the photocarrier transport distance. To date, various nanostructured Ta3N5 have been designed for photocatalytic H2 generation, such as nanoparticles, nanospheres, nanofibers, nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes and nanosheets.26 In particular, the hollow nanosphere would be a commendable choice for Ta3N5, because the hollow structure could remain multiple reflections for enhanced light absorption while the inside–outside walls could offer double specific surface areas for increasing the reaction sites during photocatalytic reactions.27 Moreover, coupling another semiconductor with nanostructured Ta3N5 to form a heterojunction would further facilitate the interfacial charge separation and transfer, leading to improved photocatalytic performance. For example, Li et al. reported the preparation of nanofiber-shaped Ag2O/Ta3N5 p–n heterojunctions using a facile deposition method and the resulting Ag2O/Ta3N5 photocatalyst exhibited effective suppression of charge recombination and improved photocatalytic activities.28 Although significant progress has been made, the design of Ta3N5-based heterojunctions with high efficiency remains challenging.
Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which have graphene-like structures, are receiving considerable research interest in photocatalytic applications because of their unique physical, chemical, and electronic properties and high surface areas.29–31 In recent years, many kinds of TMDs have been extensively investigated as efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, such as MoS2, WS2 and ReS2. Among them, ReS2 is an emerging member of the TMDs family, which has recently attracted significant attention in the catalysis fields due to its unique characteristics of large surface area, active unsaturated coordinate edge sites and layer-independent electric/optical properties.29,32,33 Benefiting from these advantages, they endow ReS2 with considerable potential as cocatalyst or efficient photocatalyst, which may provide new opportunities for enhancing photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of Ta3N5. However, to our knowledge, promising Ta3N5@ReS2 photocatalysts have not been reported so far.
Herein, for the first time, an efficient and stable Ta3N5@ReS2 photocatalyst is designed for hydrogen evolution, where few-layer ReS2 nanosheets were anchored on hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres. The hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres present a larger surface area for increasing active sites and promoting the photon-generated electron diffusion, leading to an enhanced photocatalytic behavior than their bulk counterparts. In addition, the introduction of few-layered ReS2 nanosheets with Ta3N5 can extend the visible-light response range, provide abundant edge active sites for HER and significantly facilitate the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs by forming a type-I heterojunction. Consequently, the resultant Ta3N5@ReS2 photocatalyst shows excellent photocatalytic H2 production performance compared to that of bare Ta3N5 and ReS2.
Experimental section
Sample preparation

Preparation of Ta3N5 with hollow sphere structure. 
Ta3N5 with a hollow structure was synthesized using carbon spheres as a template. In a typical process, 10 wt% glucose aqueous solution was employed in the hydrothermal reaction to synthesize carbon sphere template. Then, the synthesized carbon sphere template was further washed with water and ethanol several times. The precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven at 333 K for 12 h before use. 250 mg of TaCl5 was firstly dissolved in 100 mL of absolute ethanol followed by adding 500 mg of dried carbon spheres as a template in the mixed solution. The mixture was ultrasonically dispersed for 1 h, then kept stirring for 10 h at room temperature. After that, the mixture was centrifuged and washed with ethanol 4 times, and dried in the oven. Then, TaOx hollow spheres were obtained by calcination of the mixture to remove the carbon sphere template in the air at 773 K for 8 h. Finally, TaOx were treated under an NH3 flow (100 mL min−1) at 973 K for 6 h to obtain Ta3N5 with a hollow sphere structure.


Preparation of ReS2 ultrathin nanosheets. 
The chemical reagents of 43 mg of ammonium perrhenate (NH4ReO4), 54.4 mg of thiourea (CH4N2S) and 42 mg of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HONH3Cl) were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water, the mixture was kept stirring for 1 h followed by transferring to a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 493 K for 12 h in an oven. Then, bulk ReS2 was obtained by centrifugation and drying. ReS2 ultrathin nanosheets (ReS2 Uns) were prepared by a liquid-assisted ultrasonic method. Specifically, 10 mg of bulk ReS2 was dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol and peeled off using an ultrasonic cell grinder for 2 h, then the supernatant was sucked to obtain a dispersion of ReS2 Uns after the stripped mixture was centrifuged at high speed.


Preparation of Ta3N5@ReS2. 
Ta3N5@ReS2 was synthesized by a solution–adsorption process using a mechanical mixing procedure. In detail, 10 mg of Ta3N5 with hollow structure was added to the mortar followed by adding 0 mL, 10 mL, 20 mL, 30 mL of ReS2 Uns ethanol solutions in each sample. Then, the mixture was mechanically ground for 3 minutes and the ethanol solvent was naturally evaporated. The obtained samples were referred to as TR0, TR10, TR20, TR30, respectively. For comparison, bulk Ta3N5 was synthesized by treating commercial Ta2O5 under an NH3 flow (100 mL min−1) at 1073 K for 6 h.

Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-2010, JEOL, Japan) were operated to explore the microstructures and morphologies of various samples. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) was used to obtain the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The surface species and chemical states were measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific, America). The Raman spectra of the as-fabricated catalysts were collected on an iHR550 instrument from HORIBA Scientific using a 532 nm solid laser as the excitation source. The diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of the products were recorded on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Hitachi UV-3900) equipped with an integrated sphere attachment using BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra were recorded using the fluorescence and transient fluorescence spectrometer (FLS-1000, Edinburgh) with excitation wavelengths of 255 nm and 375 nm at room temperature (RT), respectively. Pore size distribution was obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model using the adsorption branch of the isotherm. The specific surface area of the materials was calculated using the adsorption data in the pressure range of P/P0 = 0–1 by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model.
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction
The photocatalytic reaction was performed using a all glass automatic on-line trace gas analysis system (Labsolar-6A, Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd.). In detail, the reaction system is composed of a quartz reaction cell and a vacuum-closed circulation system, and the system is connected with a gas chromatograph to detect reaction products. For hydrogen evolution reaction, 10 mg of photocatalytic material was dispersed in a mixture containing 100 mL deionized water, 4.41 g of Na2SO3·6H2O and 8.4 g of Na2S·9H2O. The photocatalytic reaction was triggered by a 300 W Xenon lamp after evacuating the reaction system several times. The temperature of the reaction cell was maintained at 279 K using a circulating cooling water jacket during the reaction to eliminate the heating effect of the lamp source. The generated gas was sent to the gas chromatograph for analysis.
The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was evaluated by following equation below: (1)I and R are the number of incident photons and generated H2 molecules during the same period, respectively. The conditions for the AQY test were kept the same as the photocatalytic H2 evolution test, except for the lamp source was changed to a 300 W Xenon lamp with a 420 nm bandpass filter.
Photoelectrochemical measurement
Photoelectrochemical analysis was carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell using 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions as an electrolyte. Ag/AgCl and Pt electrodes were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The working electrode was prepared by a drop coating method. In detail, 25 μL of suspension A (5 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 1 mL ethanol) and 25 μL of suspension B (50 μL of Nafion were added into 1 mL of ethanol) were mixed and dropped onto the exposed area (1 cm−2) of the ITO glass, then dried to obtain the working electrode. The light source was a 300 W Xenon lamp with simulated solar film and the illumination intensity was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2. Transient photocurrents were measured at 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed under the potential of 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. Mott–Schottky plots were determined in 0.5 M of Na2SO4 aqueous solution at a frequency of 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz, respectively. A voltage range of −0.7 to 0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale by the Nernst equation: ERHE = 0.059pH + E0Ag/AgCl + EAg/AgCl(2)ERHE is the converted potential versus RHE, E0Ag/AgCl is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl, and EAg/AgCl is the experimental potential versus Ag/AgCl.
Computing method
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were computed with Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP),34 based on Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.35 The electron–ion interaction was treated by the projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials with a kinetic energy cutoff of 450 eV.36 The valence electron configurations are 1s1 of H, 2s22p3 of N, 5p65d36s2 of Ta, 3s23p4 of S and 5p65d56s2 of Re. The convergence threshold for self-consistent-field (SCF) iteration was set at 1.0 × 10−5 eV, and the atoms were allowed to relax until all the force components decrease to below 0.05 eV Å−1. The optimized Ta3N5 or ReS2 bulk cells were used to construct surface slab models. A Ta3N5 (110) surface slab model of 4 Ta–N layers was built with the bottom 3 layers of the atoms fixed to simulate Ta3N5 bulk and a monolayer ReS2 (001) surface slab model was built. For investigating the H* adsorption at the edge site of ReS2, complete ReS2 was also broken to construct incomplete ReS2 with edge sides. The heterostructure was built by Ta3N5 (110) and incomplete ReS2 (001) slab. The Brillouin zone was sampled by 4 × 4 × 1 k-point mesh centered at the Γ point for Ta3N5, ReS2 slabs and Ta3N5@ReS2 heterostructure.
The Gibbs free energy changes (ΔGH*) for H* adsorption on these slabs were calculated by the equation: ΔGH* = Esur–H − Esur − E1/2H2 + ΔEZPE − TΔS,37 where Esur–H is the total energy of the surface adsorbed with an H, Esur is the energy of the clean surface, and EH2 is the energy of H2 in the gas phase, ΔEZPE is the zero-point energy change and ΔS is the entropy change. For this study, the value of ΔEZPE − TΔS on the catalyst surface is 0.24 eV for H absorption.37
Results and discussion
The overall preparation route of Ta3N5@ReS2 nanocomposites is illustrated in Fig. 1. Carbon nanosphere templates and bulk ReS2 were first prepared by a hydrothermal method. Then, the as-prepared carbon nanospheres were added to the TaCl5 solution and hollow TaOx nanospheres were obtained by the removal of the carbon nanospheres templates by high-temperature calcination. Subsequently, hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres were produced by heat treatment of hollow TaOx nanospheres under flowing NH3 atmosphere. Finally, few layered ReS2 nanosheets were attached on the surface of hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres through an absorption process.

The phases and crystal structures of the obtained samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman analyses. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the samples without the addition of ReS2 present some typical peaks at 24.48°, 31.45°,35.01°, 36.12°, 39.27° and 57.4°, which can be respectively assigned to (110), (023), (130), (131), (042) and (223) lattice planes of Ta3N5 (JCPDS card no. 79-1533).38 As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the characteristic peaks of pure ReS2 samples at 14.55°, 29.95° and 40.1° can be indexed to (100), (020) and (2−22) crystal planes of triclinic ReS2 (JCPDS card no. 24-0922).39 In the XRD patterns of all hybrid samples with different amounts of ReS2, only characteristic peaks of the Ta3N5 structure can be observed and no peaks of ReS2 are identified due to the uniform dispersion and low loading content. In addition, there is also no diffraction peak shift of Ta3N5 and no new peaks appeared, which suggests that the loading of ReS2 cannot affect the crystal structure of Ta3N5. Fig. 2(b) shows the Raman spectra of bare Ta3N5 (TR0), ReS2 and Ta3N5@ReS2 (TR20) samples. The characteristic Raman spectrum of the TR0 sample is similar to that of the bulk material, in which the frequencies of 140.9, 401.8 and 522.3 cm−1 can be assigned to Ag vibration modes while 125.8, 262.1, 492.9, and 599.8 cm−1 correspond to Bg vibration modes.4 In the Raman spectrum of TR20 nanocomposites, an obvious characteristic peak can be identified at 206 cm−1, besides the characteristic peaks of Ta3N5, according to the out-of-plane (Ag-like) vibration mode of ReS2,39,40 which confirms the existence of ReS2 within the Ta3N5@ReS2 composite.

The morphology features of the obtained samples were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), it was observed that the sacrificial carbon nanosphere template showed high uniformity and dispersity with a diameter of approximately 200 nm. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows SEM images of the TaOx sample produced after removal of the carbon core template. Clearly, the as-synthesized TaOx products can not only inherit the nanosphere structure of the carbon template but also present a hollow core structure. After the ammonia thermal treatment of TaOx, the Ta3N5 sample can hold the will-defied hollow-spherical nanostructure (Fig. 3(a1 and a2)). The thickness of the shell is ∼10 nm, as shown from the recorded TEM image in Fig. 3(a3). Fig. 3(b1 and b2) shows the typical SEM images of the as-prepared bulk ReS2, displaying flower-like nanospheres with an average diameter of approximately 400 nm. The TEM image in Fig. 3(b3) reveals that the flower-like nanospheres are composed of uniformly dispersed ReS2 nanosheets, which can be easily peeled to ultrathin nanosheets through an ultrasonic stripping process (the inset in Fig. 3(b3)). As for the Ta3N5@ReS2 sample, SEM (Fig. 3(c1 and c2)) and TEM images (Fig. 3(c3)) show that ultrathin ReS2 nanosheets were attached on the surface of hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres.

More structural details of the samples were examined using a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). As observed in a typical HRTEM image of bare Ta3N5 (Fig. S4(c), ESI†), the resolved interplanar distances of 0.296 nm and 0.365 nm could be ascribed to the lattice spacing of (112) and (110) plane, respectively, of Ta3N5.41,42 The HRTEM image of the bare ReS2 nanosheets present an interplanar distance of 0.61 nm and 0.27 nm, indexing to (100) and (020) crystal plane, respectively.29,39Fig. 4(a) provides a representative HRTEM image obtained from the Ta3N5@ReS2 (TR20) sample, which shows different sets of lattice fringes. Typically, the lattice fringe with a spacing of 0.365 nm is consistent with the (110) lattice plane of the Ta3N5 (Fig. 4(b)) while the lattice fringes of 0.27 nm can be attributed to the (020) plane of ReS2 (Fig. 4(c)). Moreover, it is worth pointing out that the lattice fringes of Ta3N5 and ReS2 are interwoven with each other, demonstrating the formation of the Ta3N5@ReS2 heterostructure with an intimate interface. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were further recorded to confirm the crystal structures of the samples (Fig. S4(d), S5(c) and 4(d), ESI†). As for the Ta3N5@ReS2 sample (Fig. 4(d)), the distinct concentric diffraction rings are indexed to the (020), (110) and (112) planes of Ta3N5 (JCPDS card no. 79-1533), and also the diffraction plane of the ReS2 ((020) and (2−22)) can be found, confirming the co-existence of Ta3N5 and ReS2 crystal phases.22,33,39 The chemical compositions of the hybrid Ta3N5@ReS2 sample (TR20) were further identified from the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX), as shown in Fig. 4(e). The results show that the hybrid sample mainly consists of Ta, N, S and Re, while the small amounts of C and Cu are resulting from the copper grids for supporting the TEM sample. The atomic ratio of the detected elements is listed in Table S1 (ESI†), which confirmed that samples are Ta3N5 and ReS2 nanocomposites. The EDX mapping images were used to further get insight into the ReS2 distribution on the surface of hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres. As displayed in Fig. 4(g–j), the uniform distribution of Ta, N, S and Re elements in the sample suggests the homogeneous distribution of ReS2 on the surface of hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was further conducted to probe the chemical composition and surface chemical states of the as-prepared TR0, ReS2 and TR20 samples. As shown in Fig. 5(a), Ta, N, Re, and S elements were detected in the survey spectrum of TR20, which originate from hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres and ReS2 ultrathin nanosheets. Meanwhile, the signal of C in the survey spectrums of all samples is ascribed to the adventitious contamination from the XPS instrument. Fig. 5(b) shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ta 4f for TR20 and TR0 samples. The typical peaks belonging to Ta 4f5/2 and Ta 4f7/2 in Ta3N5 are observed at approximately 26.8 and 24.9 eV, respectively.38,43 Significantly, compared with pure Ta3N5, the binding energies of Ta 4f for Ta3N5@ReS2 exhibit slightly positive shifts of ∼0.11 eV. These positive changes in binding energies imply that electrons transfer from Ta3N5 to ReS2 on account of the hybridization.33 This fact was also further confirmed from the N 1s, Re 4f and S 2p high-resolution XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the binding energies of N 1s in the TR20 sample also displayed a slightly positive shift compared with pure Ta3N5. As for the Re 4f high-resolution XPS spectra of samples (Fig. 5(d)), the binding energies of Re4+ 4f5/2 and Re4+ 4f7/2 in Ta3N5@ReS2 are, respectively, located at 43.6 eV and 41.25 eV, both of which are 0.93 eV smaller than those for bare ReS2. Moreover, the binding energy of S 2p in Ta3N5@ReS2 also exhibits an obvious negative shift of ∼0.83 eV, relative to pure ReS2 (Fig. 5(e)). Therefore, the above results reveal the existence of a strong interaction between Ta3N5 and ReS2, which can make the electrons transfer from Ta3N5 to ReS2, resulting in effective carrier separation for boosted photocatalytic performance.

The light-harvesting capacity of the samples was examined using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS).44 As displayed in Fig. 6(a), the absorption edge for the bare Ta3N5 (TR0) sample is located around 600 nm, which is corresponding to the intrinsic band gap of 2.1 eV. As for the pristine ReS2 sample (Fig. S6, ESI†), it presents a very broad and strong absorption in both UV and visible light regions.29 After the coupling of Ta3N5 and ReS2, the resulting Ta3N5@ReS2 samples exhibit an extended visible light absorption range as compared to that of the bare Ta3N5 sample, enabling Ta3N5@ReS2 heterojunctions to utilize more visible light during the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, the relative absorption intensity and absorption edge strengthen with an increasing amount of ReS2, which may affect the photocatalytic performance. Nitrogen (N2) sorption analysis was employed to investigate the surface area and pore volume of the TR0, TR20 and ReS2 samples. According to the result N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, BET surface areas were calculated as 100.056 m2 g−1, 26.3237 m2 g−1 and 53.99 m2 g−1 for ReS2, TR0, and TR20 samples, respectively. Significantly, the BET surface area of the Ta3N5@ReS2 sample was about 2 times that of pure Ta3N5. The high specific surface area of the Ta3N5@ReS2 sample is also expected to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by exposing more exposed reactive sites.29

The photocatalytic activities over the sample photocatalysts were evaluated by detecting the H2 production rate in the mixed Na2SO3 and Na2S aqueous solution under 300 W Xenon lamp light irradiation. Fig. 7(a) depicts the comparison of photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of commercial bulk Ta3N5, bare Ta3N5 hollow nanospheres (TR0), pristine ReS2 and Ta3N5@ReS2 samples (TR10, TR20 and TR30). The results show that both pure ReS2 and commercial bulk Ta3N5 display extremely low activity for hydrogen evolution with the rate of 47.5 and 44.8 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, which is because of inefficient photoinduced carrier separation. Interestingly, the bare Ta3N5 hollow nanospheres (TR0) show an enhanced H2 production rate (164.9 μmol g−1 h−1) as compared to commercial bulk Ta3N5, demonstrating that Ta3N5 hollow nanospheres are more efficient than the commercial bulk Ta3N5 photocatalyst for hydrogen production.26 This result also suggests that the hollow nanospheric structure contributes to providing abundant reaction sites and also offer efficient charge transport pathways in comparison to the commercial bulk Ta3N5, thus leading to the boosted photocatalytic activity. More impressively, the H2 evolution rate was further dramatically promoted when ReS2 nanosheets were introduced on the surface of Ta3N5 hollow nanospheres. In addition, the content of ReS2 in this hybrid also had a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity.29,45

It is interesting to see that the optimized Ta3N5@ReS2 sample photocatalyst (TR20) exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2-production activity of 739.4 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 16.5, 4.5 and 15.6 times higher than that of commercial bulk Ta3N5, bare Ta3N5 hollow nanospheres and pure ReS2, respectively. The achieved photocatalytic H2-production rate is also superior to that of most reported Ta3N5-based photocatalysts by using Pt as cocatalyst (see Fig. 7(c) and Table S2, ESI†).1,4,22,24–26,46–49 Moreover, the photocatalytic H2 production rate of the TR20 sample can be further boosted to 1378.6 μmol g−1 h−1 by loading 3% Pt as a cocatalyst, which represents the highest H2 production rate among the reported Ta3N5-based photocatalysts. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of the TR20 photocatalyst under 420 nm is 0.102% without any cocatalyst loading, which is also comparable to that of the reported Ta3N5-based photocatalysts with Pt as a cocatalyst. Additionally, the recyclable photocatalytic hydrogen production was also measured to study the stability and repeatability of the as-prepared Ta3N5@ReS2 sample photocatalyst. As displayed in Fig. 7(b), no obvious decrease in the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of TR20 photocatalyst was found after three cycles, which suggests that the as-prepared Ta3N5@ReS2 sample photocatalysts possess excellent photocatalytic stability. Furthermore, the XRD and TEM characterizations of the TR20 sample were conducted to explore its stability in photocatalytic recycling reactions. As shown in Fig. S7 and Fig. S8 (ESI†), no noticeable changes could be observed in crystal structure and morphology, further reflecting the satisfied durability of as-fabricated photocatalysts.
The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was then conducted to disclose the transport behavior of photogenerated charge carriers. As shown in Fig. S9(a) (ESI†), the PL spectrum of TR20 exhibits a weakened emission intensity than that of bare Ta3N5, which implies a fundamentally decreased recombination of photogenerated charge carriers.50–52 Moreover, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were collected to further investigate the excitation kinetics of charge carriers, as shown in Fig. S9(b) (ESI†). It seems that the TR20 sample shows a lower average fluorescence lifetime (τ = 0.45 ns), compared to the bare Ta3N5 (τ = 0.55 ns). Typically, the decreased average emission lifetime reflects the overall emission decay behavior of the sample. Thus, it suggests that the coupling of ReS2 with Ta3N5 could restrain the recombination of charge carriers in Ta3N5.53,54
To further understand the transmission and separation of photogenerated charge carriers, transient photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted. Firstly, the transient photocurrent over the bare Ta3N5 and Ta3N5@ReS2 sample photoelectrodes was measured in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution at a constant potential of 0.6 V (Ag/AgCl) with an interval time of on-off switches at 2 s and under simulated solar light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 8(a), both Ta3N5@ReS2 sample photoelectrodes present stronger photoresponse with higher current density than the bare Ta3N5 photoelectrode, indicating that the construction of the Ta3N5@ReS2 heterojunction can effectively promote the separation of photoinduced electrons and holes. Among them, the TR20 photoelectrode displays the highest photocurrent responses, demonstrating the excellent charge separation efficiency in comparison with other counterparts, and thus the optimal photocatalytic performance. The interfacial charge transfer properties were further studied through EIS measurements. In general, the diameter of the Nyquist plot semicircle is related to the charge transfer resistance in the electrolyte solution and a smaller semicircle arc indicates a lower charge-transfer resistance, thus representing a faster interfacial charge migration.55,56 As shown in Fig. 8(b), it can be seen that the diameters of the arc radius of Ta3N5@ReS2 heterojunctions (TR10, TR20 and TR30) are significantly decreased as compared to that of bare Ta3N5 (TR0), suggesting the lower charge transfer resistance and accelerated charge transport kinetics after the introduction of ReS2 on Ta3N5. Obviously, the TR20 sample heterojunction demonstrates the smallest Nyquist curve arc radius compared to that of other counterparts, representing the faster charge separation efficiency and best photocatalytic performance.

(e) Schematic illustration on the charge carrier separation and transportation in Ta3N5@ReS2 photocatalyst. 
To disclose the photocatalytic H2 production mechanism over the Ta3N5@ReS2 heterojunction, Mott–Schottky plots of Ta3N5 and ReS2 were firstly measured to determine their electron band structures. As depicted in Fig. 8(c) and (d), both Ta3N5 and ReS2 present a positive slope, indicative of n-type semiconductor characteristics. It is common knowledge that the conduction band potential (ECB) is negative by about ∼0.1 V than acquired flat-band potential for n-type semiconductors.57,58 The flat band potentials of Ta3N5 and ReS2 were determined to be −0.685 V and −0.63 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. According to the Nernst equation, the measured flat band potential could be converted to −0.485 V and −0.43 V (vs. NHE) for Ta3N5 and ReS2, respectively. Thus, the CB positions for the pristine Ta3N5 and ReS2 were therefore calculated as −0.585 V and −0.53 V (vs. NHE), respectively. According to the band-gap energy estimated from UV-vis DRS, the positions of the valence band (EVB) were estimated to be +1.465 eV and +0.97 eV (vs. NHE) for Ta3N5 and ReS2, respectively. Accordingly, a type I (straddling type) heterojunction was constructed between ReS2 and Ta3N5 in the as-prepared Ta3N5@ReS2 nanocomposite.
Based on the aforementioned experimental results, a possible photocatalytic mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activities of the as-prepared Ta3N5@ReS2 heterojunctions is also proposed in detail. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, electrons would be respectively excited to the CB of Ta3N5 and ReS2, with holes generated in their own VB. Generally, most of the photogenerated electrons and holes will recombine in pure Ta3N5 and ReS2, and only a small fraction will participate in the photocatalytic reaction, thus resulting in a lower H2 evolution activity. However, after the formation of Ta3N5@ReS2 heterojunctions with an intimate interface (Fig. 8(e)), photogenerated electrons in the CB of Ta3N5 will effectively transfer to ReS2, which will quickly participate in the reduction reaction to produce H2. It is worth pointing that the adsorption and reduction of protons for H2 evolution was accelerated because of the high surface area and atomic-level edge reactive sites of few-layered ReS2 nanosheets. Simultaneously, the holes leave the VB of Ta3N5 or are transferred to the VB of ReS2 and would be consumed by the surrounding S2− and SO32−. As a result, the charge recombination of Ta3N5 will be substantially suppressed, leading to improved photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the introduction of ReS2 on Ta3N5 can increase visible light absorption, which will promote the production of more photogenerated electrons and holes to participate in photocatalytic reactions. What is more, the hollow nanosphere nanostructures of Ta3N5 not only can provide abundant active sites but also induce rapid and long-distance electron transport of photo-generated carriers, which put forward an enhanced photocatalytic behavior as compared to that in the bulk counterparts.
To further prove the photocatalytic mechanism, we calculated the Gibbs free energy change (ΔGH*) of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Ta3N5, ReS2 and Ta3N5@ReS2 surface (see the models in Fig. 9(a)–(c)) by density functional theory (DFT). Generally, there are some vacancy defects in ReS2, which could improve the HER performance. As a result, we also investigated the effect of some surface defects, e.g., S vacancy (VS) and Re vacancy (VRe) on the ΔGH*, as displayed in Fig. 9(d). The results are shown in Fig. 9(e) and (f), and some detailed discussion is presented in ESI (please see Fig. S10 and S11†), which show that the ΔGH* of Ta3N5 surface is 0.32 eV, which is much smaller than that of perfect ReS2 surface and ReS2 with VS (Fig. 9(f)) but larger than that of ReS2 with VRe (ΔGH* = 0.14 eV), indicating that VRe could significantly improve the HER property of ReS2. When VRe is produced in ReS2, some unsaturated S atoms around the VRe site are generated, which benefits the adsorption of H* proton, thus producing better HER property than perfect ReS2 (Fig. 9(f)).33 As shown in Fig. 9(f), it can be concluded that the combination of Ta3N5 in the Ta3N5@ReS2 system could enhance the HER performance of sole ReS2 regardless of defects. Ta3N5 combined with ReS2 with VRe exhibits the best HER property (ΔGH* = 0.06 eV) compared to both Ta3N5 and ReS2–VRe, representing the synergetic enhancement effect of Ta3N5, ReS2 and VRe. To investigate the HER at the edge site of ReS2, complete ReS2 (Fig. 9(b)-II) was also broken to construct build incomplete ReS2 (Fig. S11, ESI†) with many edge sides (labelled as Ta3N5@ReS2-edge). To analyze the energy level matching of Ta3N5 and ReS2, the density of states (DOS) of Ta3N5, ReS2 and Ta3N5@ReS2 surface were displayed in Fig. 9(g). Fig. 9(g)-III depicts that the conduction band minimum (CBM) of ReS2 is lower than that of Ta3N5, which could accelerate the electron transport from Ta3N5 to ReS2 for the enhanced HER property.

(d) ReS2 with the S vacancy (VS) and Re vacancy (VRe), respectively. (e) Calculated Gibbs free energy diagram (ΔGH*) of HER on Ta3N5 (110) surface, ReS2 (001) surface with VRe, Ta3N5@ReS2 heterostructure with VRe and Ta3N5@incomplete-ReS2 heterostructure. (f) ΔGH* of ReS2 and Ta3N5@ReS2 heterostructure without/with defects. (g) Density of states for (I) Ta3N5 (110) slab, (II) ReS2 (001) slab, (III) Ta3N5@complete-ReS2 and (IV) Ta3N5@incomplete-ReS2 heterostructure. The Fermi level was set at zero. 
When incomplete ReS2 is produced, many unsaturated S atoms at the edge site are generated whose impurity states appear in the bandgap, as shown in Fig. 9(g)-IV. As a result, the unsaturation S atoms at edge sites benefit the adsorption of H* proton, thus producing better HER property (ΔGH* = −0.24 eV) than that at the center site (ΔGH* = 1.84 eV) (Fig. 9(e)).33 Based on these calculations, it is concluded that a small number of VRe could enhance the adsorption of H*, and thus improve HER performance (ΔGH* = 0.06 eV). These results also confirmed that few-layered ReS2 nanosheets anchored on the Ta3N5 surface could provide abundant edge active sites (small concentration of VRe) for HER with synergistically improved photocatalytic performance.
In addition, we also investigate the formation energies of VS and VRe defects. As shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the energy barriers of the formation of VRe are higher than those of VS in both ReS2 and Ta3N5@ReS2 systems, caused by more Re–S bonds needed to be broken when VRe is formed. Besides, the formation energy of VRe in Ta3N5@ReS2 heterostructure is smaller than that in the sole ReS2, which could produce more VRe for enhancing the HER performance.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an efficient Ta3N5@ReS2 heterojunction by modifying a few layers of ReS2 nanosheets on the surface of hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres for high-efficiency photocatalytic H2 production. The optimal Ta3N5@ReS2 heterojunction photocatalyst (TR20) exhibits high photocatalytic H2 evolution activity with a rate as high as 739.4 μmol g−1 h−1, which is nearly 16.5, 4.5 and 15.6 times higher than that of commercial bulk Ta3N5, bare Ta3N5 hollow nanospheres, and pure ReS2, respectively. Moreover, the achieved H2 evolution performance also significantly outperformed most Ta3N5-based photocatalysts reported thus far. It is considered that the hollow nanosphere structure can increase the reaction active sites while the loading of few-layered ReS2 nanosheets on hollow Ta3N5 nanospheres can increase visible-light absorption, offer abundant edge active sites for HER as well as boost the separation of photo-generated carriers, thereby attaining a higher H2 production activity of Ta3N5@ReS2 binary hybrids. Current work might provide some new concepts on the exploration of advanced heterojunction photocatalyst for hydrogen generation applications.
