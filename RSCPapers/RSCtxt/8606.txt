    , Accepted 3rd October 2011First published on 3rd November 2011AbstractA new dye-sensitized solar cell based on a thermoelectric Bi2Te3/TiO2 composite anode is demonstrated, in which the incorporated Bi2Te3 nanoplates function as built-in nanoscale electron generators to convert “waste heat” to electricity and as a good photoreaction catalyst to enhance the charge transfer rate, resulting in 28% improvement of the overall power conversion efficiency.

Broader context
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have fuelled great interest due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost. The concomitant solar thermal energy and heat generation in DSSC operation is often wasted, known as “waste heat”. Herein we demonstrate a proof-of-concept DSSC to simultaneously scavenge both thermal and photo energies by using composite anode of Bi2Te3/TiO2 in a single cell. As a result of Bi2Te3 incorporation, the maximum PCE of the DSSC is improved by 28%. Mechanistic investigations show that Bi2Te3 can not only convert the “waste heat” to electricity by working as built-in “nanogenerators” inside DSSC, but also enhance the charge transfer as a good photoreaction catalyst. On the other hand, Bi2Te3 nanoplates play a role as nanoscale coolers to resist the temperature increase of the devices. With the design of new nanostructured thermoelectric materials and optimal loading, we believe that this approach can eventually lead to solar cells with higher PCE and long operation lifetime for broad practical applications.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) convert light energy into electricity and have been recognized as a great alternative to silicon solar cells due to their low fabrication cost and high power conversion efficiency.1–3 Great efforts have been devoted to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) and long-term stability of DSSCs for practical applications since their discovery.1,4,5 Experimental investigations include the use of advanced semiconducting materials for high-performance photoanodes6–8 and efficient dyes to garner more sunlight1,9 and superior electrolytes to improve their stability and electron/hole transport.10,11 Fundamental studies of DSSCs have also been conducted extensively to provide scientific insights for guiding further research and development.12–14 However, researches have primarily focused on only one type of energy conversion, i.e. light to electricity. Recently, converting multi-type energies in an integrated device has been considered as a significant advance to improve solar cell efficiency. For example, conversion of mechanical energy into electricity has been achieved in a ZnO-based DSSC.15,16 Investigations to explore the thermionic effect in silicon-based solar cells have also been demonstrated, but are usually performed at elevated temperatures by external heating.17,18 Very recently, serially connected photovoltaic and thermoelectric devices have been reported to generate electricity from low energy sunlight or externally exerted temperature differences.19,20
In solar cell operation, heat is mild and often produced from IR irradiation, charge recombination (back reaction) and illumination energy higher than the sensitizer energy gap.21,22 Thus, conversion of the “waste heat” to useful electricity should be a good approach to improve the overall efficiency of solar cells. Thermoelectric materials can transform a temperature gradient into an electric voltage and have been widely used in device cooling and power generation.23–29 Among the various thermoelectric materials, Bi2Te3 is superior to others in converting a temperature gradient into electricity due to its high Seebeck coefficient (240 μV K−1, bulk materials) around room temperature.30,31 More importantly, Bi2Te3 possesses the highest figure of merit among the thermoelectric materials at around room temperature, near to 1. Therefore, in this work, we fabricate novel thermoelectric material Bi2Te3/TiO2 composite photoanode for DSSCs, in which Bi2Te3 nanostructures generate “electrons” from their thermoelectric effect to convert “waste heat” into electricity for overall PCE improvement (Fig. 1a). Such a design avoids the need of stacking an additional TE device. On the other hand, the cooling effect of the thermoelectric Bi2Te3 is demonstrated to extend operation life of DSSCs. Bi2Te3 is also observed to significantly enhance the charge transfer rate of the photoreactions, which eventually reduces charge recombination process from the reduction process. These synergic effects result in an overall PCE improvement of 28%.
 Fig. 1  Structure and electron generation/transfer of the composite anode based DSSC. (a) Schematic illustration of the structure and electron generation/transfer process of the DSSC. There are two routes for energy conversion. Route (1) is the photovoltaic effect: from the excited dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2; route (2) is the thermoelectric effect: charge transport from the Fermi level of Bi2Te3 nanoplate to TiO2 upon heating by sunlight irradiation. (b) TEM image of the as-synthesized Bi2Te3 nanoplates. (c) SEM image of the composite anode film, in which Bi2Te3 nanoplates embedded in the mesoporous TiO2 network, Bi2Te3 nanoplates are highlighted with dashed circles. 
Bi2Te3 cuboid nanoplates with edge lengths of about 150 × 500 nm and thicknesses of 20–30 nm were synthesized by a solvothermal approach (Fig. 1b). The Seebeck coefficient of the as-synthesized Bi2Te3 nanoplate thin film is −128 μV K−1 at ∼303 K, indicating n-type semiconductor behavior (Fig. S1†).32 The high Seebeck coefficient provides the possibility to harvest thermal energy in solar cells. Bi2T3/TiO2 composite photoanodes were prepared by mixing Bi2Te3 nanoplates with TiO2 paste under sonication at 60 °C for 2 h (see Experimental for details). To optimize DSSC performance, Bi2T3 nanoplates in TiO2 nanoparticles with final weight percentages of 0%, 0.34%, 0.89% and 1.78% were prepared for devices 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (Table 1). In these DSSCs, cis-bis(isothiocyanato) (2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) (2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dinonyl) ruthenium(II) (coded as Z907 dye) sensitizer and iodide-based liquid electrolyte (HL-HPE) were employed. The thicknesses of all the film anodes were controlled to be 12 μm. The effective areas of the anodes are 0.25 cm2 for all the devices.

Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the fabricated devices were measured under one sun illumination, and the results summarized in Table 1 show that with incorporation of Bi2Te3 nanoplates in TiO2 photoelectrode the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factors (FFs) increases while the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) fluctuates around 14.56 mA cm−2, resulting in PCE of 6.08%, 6.24%, and 7.33% for device 1, 2 and 3, respectively. This clearly demonstrates that the device performance can be significantly improved by incorporation of Bi2Te3 into TiO2 photoanode.
Obviously, the improved PCEs of composite anode based devices can be firstly ascribed to the improved open-circuit voltage and fill factors (Table 1). The steady increase of Voc could be attributed to the lift-up of quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 owing to the charge equilibration between Bi2Te3 (EF = −1.2 eV) and TiO2.33,34 However, further increasing Bi2Te3 up to 1.78% (device 4) leads to both η and Jsc dropping down to 6.02% and 13.48 mA cm−2 respectively. It is possibly caused by the relatively lower content of TiO2 nanoparticles and aggregation of Bi2Te3 at high concentration (Fig. S3b†), resulting in lower dye loading on TiO2 surface and less efficient charge injection.35,36
The thermoelectric effect of Bi2Te3 nanoplates in the composite anode was investigated under long time sunlight irradiation, which was expected to accumulate heat allowing observation of possible heat–electricity conversion. Upon illumination, both Jsc and η of device 3, the most efficient one among the tested devices, quickly increase until they achieve their maximum values of 16.98 mA cm−2 and 7.66% after 90 min illumination (Fig. 2a and 2c), showing an improvement of 0.33% in PCE. In contrast, Jsc and η of device 1, without incorporated Bi2Te3, gradually reduce to 13.50 mA cm−2 and 5.93% after 90 min illumination (Fig. 2b and Table 1). This performance deterioration is usually caused from quenching/dissociation of dyes and counter electrode corrosion by electrolytes.37 It is also observed that the surface temperature of device 1 increases from 23.0 °C to 34.7 °C, clearly showing the heating effect of sunlight irradiation. However, the temperature of device 3 increases only to 31.6 °C, which is less than that of device 1 by 3.1 °C. These results reveal that the incorporated Bi2Te3 nanoplates in the photoanode not only improves the PCE by converting heat to electricity, but also function as nanoscale coolers. When illumination is prolonged to 150 min, the PCE of device 3 remains stable while device 1 shows a continuous performance deterioration (Fig. 2c), suggesting that the thermoelectric Bi2Te3 could resist the performance deterioration.

Interestingly, heating manner plays a critical role in displaying the thermoelectric behavior of Bi2Te3 in the composite anode. When the composite anode based device was heated from room temperature (23.0 °C) to 50.0 °C by a hotplate, no performance enhancement was observed. This indicates that the “bulky” uniform heating is not able to build up a “nanoscale” thermal gradient for potential difference along these individual Bi2Te3 nanoplates to produce electrons. However, sunlight heating is different. Fig. 1c shows SEM images of the Bi2Te3/TiO2 anode film in which Bi2Te3 nanoplates are partially embedded in or decorated by TiO2 nanoparticles. Since TiO2 is covered by a Z907 monolayer, heat produced in TiO2 comes mainly from low energy (IR) sunlight irradiation and is attenuated by dyes. Bi2Te3 nanoplates are black (Fig. S2d†) and absorb more sunlight to produce heat. Therefore, the temperature of “exposed” parts of Bi2Te3 nanoplates should be higher than that of the embedded part in TiO2, enabling electron injection from the Fermi level of Bi2Te3 to TiO2 (Fig. 1a) and thereby leading to more electrons to be collected for a higher PCE.38,39 The increased electron density from thermoelectric effect should increase the electrode negativity for a more negative potential. This could also be a possible reason for the observed increase of the open circuit voltage for DSSC with Bi2Te3 incorporated anode. Similar to the observation above, the temperature increments in device 2 and 4 are also less than that of device 1 during operation (Table 1). Detailed inspection shows that the temperature increase of Bi2Te3-incorporated DSSCs under illumination is inversely correlated with the incorporated amount of Bi2Te3 whilst the PCE increment is proportional to the Bi2Te3 amount (Table 1), further proving the merit of “waste heat” harvesting and device cooling effect of Bi2Te3.
The effect of Bi2Te3 in the photoanode on charge recombination kinetics was investigated by analyzing J–V characteristics under darkness. The dark current associates with the reduction of I3− to I− by electrons in the TiO2 conduction band at a specific applied potential.40 The dark current of device 1 slightly decreases after 90 min irradiation at an applied voltage range from 0.5 to 1.0 V (Fig. 2d), which could be ascribed to the device’s intrinsic deterioration through Pt electrode erosion and electrolyte degradation.37 However, device 3 shows a larger dark current from 0.5–1.0 V than that at room temperature after 90 min heating by sunlight illumination (Fig. 2d). This dark current increase can be ascribed to the larger electron population produced from the thermoelectric effect of Bi2Te3 increasing the recombination probability. Device 4 illustrates a trend similar to that of device 3 but different from device 1, reaffirming that more electrons are generated by thermoelectric Bi2Te3 nanoplates (Fig. S5c†).
It is known that the photoelectrode in a DSSC simultaneously conducts photooxidation and reverse reduction, and their ratio determines Voc.41 It is apparent that the photooxidation should be much faster than that of the reverse reduction to greatly suppress the charge recombination process for higher power conversion efficiency. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at open-circuit voltage (OCV) under one sun illumination was measured to study the charge transfer rate towards photooxidation for the composite anode. The Nyquist plots in Fig. 3 show well-defined semicircles, of which a smaller diameter represents a lower Faraday resistance (Rct) for higher oxidation rate while a lower maximum frequency (ωmax) indicates slower recombination process42,43 at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. Since all EIS measurements use an identical counter electrode, the results should mainly reflect the behavior of the photoelectrodes.
 Fig. 3  EIS spectra of the devices measured at open-circuit voltage condition under one sun illumination. EIS spectra of devices 1 (black), 2 (red), 3 (blue) and 4 (green) without heating (a) and those of devices 1 (black), 2 (red), 3 (blue) and 4 (green) under illumination after heating by long time light irradiation (b). 
Under sunlight irradiation, the Rcts for devices 2, 3 and 4 calculated from EIS are 150.5, 42.5, 13.5 and 96.5 ohms, respectively, indicating that the incorporated Bi2Te3 nanoplates can significantly improve the charge transfer rate for higher PCE. The ωmaxs from the semicircles for device 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 115, 110, 107 and 105 Hz respectively (Fig. 3a), showing reduced effective rate constant of recombination (Keff) at TiO2/electrolyte interface with increased BiTe3 content, which has the same trend as the Rcts. In addition, the dc resistances at ω = 0 (R0, series resistance) in the DSSCs decreases with more Bi2Te3 incorporation, suggesting an increment in electron density (ns) for reduced series resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.42,44 The increase of ns at the beginning of the DSSC operation implies that the thermoelectric effect could occur instantaneously upon illumination to generate higher electron density. Theoretically, a higher charge transfer rate can better suppress the charge recombination process from the reverse reaction. That is why smaller Rct corresponds to lower ωmax. The PCE of device 4 drops with the highest Bi2Te3 content, and should be due to its greatly increased Rct resulting from the aggregated Bi2Te3 nanoplate in the composite electrode material as discussed above. Upon 90 min irradiation, both Rct and ωmax further reduce for PCE improvement (Fig. 3b). However, the series resistance at ω = ∞ of device 1 increases upon long time illumination (Fig. 3a and b). The reduced performance of device 1 is possibly due to its intrinsic deterioration as discussed above. In contrast, the observed series resistance decrement of device 3 and 4 (Fig. 3b) may stem from more electrons being generated,36,44,45 which is induced by the power generation effect of Bi2Te3 upon long time illumination. The nearly unchanged dc resistance at ω = ∞ of device 2 before and after 90 min illumination is probably due to small amount of Bi2Te3 addition in comparison to device 3 and 4. The EIS results are in good agreement with the device performance data to well support the thermoelectric effect induced performance enhancement of the composite anode based solar cells.
In brief, a proof-of-concept of composite anode based dye-sensitized solar cell has been demonstrated to take advantage of the thermoelectric property of Bi2Te3 nanoplates. This dual-energy-conversion routes result in an overall power conversion efficiency increased by 28% in comparison to the conventional TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells. Impedance analysis also clearly demonstrates that Bi2Te3 can speed up the charge transfer rate while suppressing the charge recombination process to improve the power conversion efficiencies. The observed cooling effect of the thermoelectric material could be expected to extend the device operation lifetime. This new concept to concurrently harvest thermal and light energy through a composite anode could also be applicable for other dye/quantum dot-sensitized solar cells made from different photoanodes such as ZnO, SnO2 nanostructures,1,4 organic solar cells,46,47 and CIGS solar cells.48 With the design and use of new thermoelectric materials and the construction of novel nanostructured electrodes, we argue that this composite anode-based solar cell can eventually lead to a high power conversion efficiency and a long operation lifetime for broader practical applications.
Experimental
Bi2Te3 nanoplates were synthesized by a solvothermal approach by using bismuth citrate (99.99% trace metals basis), sodium telluride (99%) as precursors and diethyleneglycol, polyethylene glycol as solvent, detailed synthesis is provided in the supporting information.† Different amounts of Bi2Te3 nanoplates (in ethanol) were mixed with TiO2 paste (DSL 18NR-T, the paste corresponded to 18 wt.% TiO2) through sonication for 1 h at 60 °C for the formation of mixed paste. The weight percentages of 0.062%, 0.16% and 0.32% of Bi2Te3 in TiO2 paste for the formation of the bottom layers were prepared for device 2, 3, and 4. Device 1 is a normal device without Bi2Te3 addition.
Device fabrication
A doctor-blade technique was utilized to produce the conducting TiO2 anode. Briefly, transparent conducting glass (SnO2:F, FTO, Nippon Glass Sheet, Japan, 12 Ω−1) was cleaned in 5 wt % detergent using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, followed by rinsing with DI water. The FTO glass was then immersed in DI water and sonicated for 10 min, followed by removal of water. This procedure was repeated 3 times to clean the surface of FTO. After that, FTO glass was immersed into 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min to form a thin layer of TiO2 nanoparticles on the FTO glass surface. Then, 12 μm thick TiO2 electrodes, which were composed of a 7 μm Bi2Te3/TiO2 mixed paste (or pure TiO2 paste for the ordinary DSC) in the bottom layer and a 5 μm scattering layer (400 nm TiO2 nanoparticles), were doctor-bladed onto TiCl4 pretreated FTO surface. It was relaxed at room temperature for 3 min before heating at 125 °C for 6 min. After that, the film was sintered at 400 °C for 60 min to remove the polymer and generate TiO2 network, followed by cooling down to 80 °C. For the dye adsorption, the electrode was then immersed in 0.3 mM Z907 dye in acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) at room temperature for 15 h, followed by rinsing with ethanol and drying in air. Platinum counter electrodes were prepared by a sputtering method at 20 mA for 60 s at a power 150 W. Two holes (0.75 mm in diameter) were pre-drilled in the FTO glass for introduction of the electrolyte. After that, the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and counter electrode were stacked and sealed with 60 μm thermal-plastic Suryln spacers at 115 °C for 12 s. The effective areas of the photoanodes were 0.25 cm2. An iodide-based liquid electrolyte (HL-HPE) was introduced into the sandwich cells through the drilled holes in the Pt electrode. After that, it was sealed by parafilm at an elevated temperature.
Characterization methods
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Jeol JSM-6701F) was used to characterize the morphology of the Bi2Te3 nanoplates and cross-section of the Bi2Te3/TiO2 films. TEM images of the as-synthesized Bi2Te3 nanoplates were collected from JEM-1400 Transmission Electron Microscopy operated at 120 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker AXS X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). UV-Vis-NIR absorption of the Bi2Te3 nanoplate solution was carried out using UV-3600 SHIMADZU UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer. A Newport solar simulator with AM 1.5G filter for illumination (100 mW cm−2), the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the assembled cells were measured by a Keithley 2420 multimeter. The temperatures of the devices were measured by a non-contacting infrared thermoscope thermometer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded under one sun illumination over a frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV by using Solartron Analytical 1260 Impedance/Gain-phase Analyzer connected with the 1294 Impedance Interface measuring unit. The parameters were calculated from Z-View software (v2.1b, Scribner Associate, Inc.).
Thermoelectric properties characterization
The as-prepared Bi2Te3 nanoplate in ethanol were centrifuged out and re-dispersed into the N2H4· H2O: ethanol = 1:4 mixture to remove the capping surfactants. After 1 h, the Bi2Te3 nanoparticles were again centrifuged out and dispersed into the N2H4· H2O: ethanol = 1:8 mixture. The solution was then used for film preparation onto glass substrate by using an air brush spray system. The thickness of the film was measured using a scanning probe station. The Seebeck coefficients were measured on the film samples with an area of 4 mm × 1.5 cm using a ZEM-3 Seebeck meter at pre-selected temperature range of 298∼373 K. The results are depicted in Fig. S1.†

Broader context
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have fuelled great interest due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost. The concomitant solar thermal energy and heat generation in DSSC operation is often wasted, known as “waste heat”. Herein we demonstrate a proof-of-concept DSSC to simultaneously scavenge both thermal and photo energies by using composite anode of Bi2Te3/TiO2 in a single cell. As a result of Bi2Te3 incorporation, the maximum PCE of the DSSC is improved by 28%. Mechanistic investigations show that Bi2Te3 can not only convert the “waste heat” to electricity by working as built-in “nanogenerators” inside DSSC, but also enhance the charge transfer as a good photoreaction catalyst. On the other hand, Bi2Te3 nanoplates play a role as nanoscale coolers to resist the temperature increase of the devices. With the design of new nanostructured thermoelectric materials and optimal loading, we believe that this approach can eventually lead to solar cells with higher PCE and long operation lifetime for broad practical applications.


 	Fig. 1  Structure and electron generation/transfer of the composite anode based DSSC. (a) Schematic illustration of the structure and electron generation/transfer process of the DSSC. There are two routes for energy conversion. Route (1) is the photovoltaic effect: from the excited dye to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2; route (2) is the thermoelectric effect: charge transport from the Fermi level of Bi2Te3 nanoplate to TiO2 upon heating by sunlight irradiation. (b) TEM image of the as-synthesized Bi2Te3 nanoplates. (c) SEM image of the composite anode film, in which Bi2Te3 nanoplates embedded in the mesoporous TiO2 network, Bi2Te3 nanoplates are highlighted with dashed circles.
