    , Accepted 6th March 2017First published on 7th March 2017AbstractEngineering of inorganic–organic lead halide perovskites for photovoltaic applications has experienced significant advances in recent years. However, the use of the relatively expensive spiro-OMeTAD as a hole-transporting material (HTM) poses a challenge due to dopant-induced degradation. Herein we introduce two new three-armed and four-armed HTMs (BTT-4 and BTT-5) based on isomeric forms of benzotrithiophene (BTT). The isomerism impact on the optical, electrochemical and photophysical properties and the photovoltaic performance is systematically investigated. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using BTT-4 and BTT-5 as HTMs show remarkable light-to-energy conversion efficiencies of 19.0% and 18.2%, respectively, under standard measurement conditions. These results validate the readily available BTT heteroaromatic structure as a valuable core for the design of highly efficient HTMs for the preparation of PSCs.
Introduction
The Sun is the most powerful energy source available in our Solar System. The energy that hits our planet is free, clean, renewable and practically limitless (120000 TW per year).1,2 Harvesting this energy in an efficient manner has currently become one of the most important challenges for the scientific community. To date, the photovoltaic (PV) market is still dominated by silicon-based solar cells, which transform 25% of the incident sunlight into electricity when using crystalline silicon and around 15% for microcrystalline silicon devices.3 Despite the remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) displayed by silicon-based solar cells, the development of low-cost and competitive new alternatives represents a challenge for the coming years.
Since the advent of organic–inorganic hybrid methylammonium (MA) lead halide MAPbX3 perovskites as active materials for photovoltaic applications in 2009,4 the PCE of perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) has dramatically increased from the initial 3.8% to a recently certified 22.1%.5 Emerging from this groundbreaking discovery, unprecedented scientific research has sprouted in the field of photovoltaics due to the exceptional physical properties of these materials, namely high charge-carrier mobilities,6,7 panchromatic light absorption with n- and p-type conduction, tunable band gaps by anionic and cationic substitution8,9 and long electron/hole diffusion lengths.10–12
The most highlighted organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites are those based on MAPbI3, which however raise some concerns about thermal stability and degradation upon contact with moisture. Larger cations such as formamidinium (FA) instead of MA lead to an enhancement of the light-harvesting ability. Nevertheless, FAPbI3 suffers from structural instability and is also sensitive to humidity and solvents. One way to overcome the instability of FAPbI3 has been addressed by introducing compositionally engineered perovskites such as [FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15.13 The MA cation acts as a “stabilizer” of the perovskite phase and, simultaneously, forms crystallites, which leads to significantly improved PCE values.
The ambipolar behaviour exhibited by hybrid perovskites allows their combination in planar or mesoporous arrangements, sandwiched between n-type and/or p-type charge extractors. For the latter, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is the most featured and commonly used hole-transporting material (HTM) for PSCs. Just a few candidates have outperformed the PCE of spiro-OMeTAD.14–17 However, developing new and easy attainable HTMs is essential due to the challenging synthetic route for the preparation of the spirobifluorene core along with its low overall yield and costly purification, which renders spiro-OMeTAD a relatively expensive material.18–20
Planar and sulfur-rich polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bearing arylamine moieties have been demonstrated to be a successful approach for designing new highly efficient HTMs for PSCs.21–26 Conventionally, the π-extended conjugation associated with the planar and electron-rich structure of the fused heterocycles enables them to show strong stacking through intermolecular interactions (π–π, S⋯S), thereby bestowing enhanced hole-carrier mobilities.27,28
Our group has recently proposed the BTT-3 compound (Fig. 1), which incorporates the benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene core endowed with electron-donor groups, as a new HTM for PSCs displaying efficiencies higher than 18%.21 The symmetrical benzotrithiophene (BTT) core involved in BTT-3 (named as C-3) possesses a planar structure with three identical thiophene rings fused to a central benzene ring (C3h),29 which is envisioned to benefit the intermolecular π–π interactions, leading to efficient hole-transporting properties. This interesting aromatic core presents seven possible isomers for the BTT structure regarding the position of the sulfur atoms. Among these isomers, the asymmetrical bbb-BTT or C-4 core has been extensively used for PV applications,30–32 whereas the bbc-BTT or C-5 core has been essentially reported for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).33,34

In this article, we describe the synthesis, characterization and photovoltaic performance of the new three-armed BTT-4 and four-armed BTT-5 HTMs based on the isomeric forms of BTT bearing p-methoxytriphenylamines (Fig. 1). In comparison with the previously reported BTT-3, the different arrangements of the sulfur atoms endow the new HTMs with different structural, electrochemical and photophysical properties. The new materials have been implemented in PSCs, displaying remarkable efficiencies of 19.0% for BTT-4 and 18.2% for BTT-5, which even surpass that exhibited by their “brother” molecule BTT-3. The results obtained validate the potential of the readily available benzotrithiophene heteroaromatic structure as a valuable core for the design of highly efficient HTMs for PSC applications.
Results and discussion
Syntheses of BTT-4 and BTT-5
The synthetic route for preparing the new sulfur-rich HTMs was achieved by stepwise syntheses as illustrated in Scheme 1. BTT cores were synthesized according to previously reported procedures (see the ESI for details†). The core of BBT-4 (C-4) was prepared in good overall yield by a straightforward two-step synthesis involving a two-fold Stille Pd-catalyzed reaction between 2,3-dibromothiophene and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene, followed by an oxidative photocyclization after irradiation in the range of 320–400 nm. Regioselective bromination at the α positions of C-4 employing N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) gave rise to the tribromo intermediate. On the other hand, the tetrabrominated C-5 core was obtained in three synthetic steps in moderate yields. 3,3′-Dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene was subjected to a two-fold Sonogashira Pd-catalyzed (Pd/Cu catalytic system) reaction with ethynyltrimethylsilane (TMSA). The third thiophene ring was formed by treating intermediate 3 with the Wilkinson catalyst [Rh(PPh3)3Cl] in refluxing benzene, followed by the addition of sulfur powder. The trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups of the thus-obtained intermediate 4 were partially removed during the purification through silica-gel column chromatography. Subsequent treatment of the C-5 core with NBS in a mixture of acetic acid and chloroform provided the tetrabrominated derivative, which was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Although the brominated intermediates C-4-Br3 and C-5-Br4 are essentially insoluble, further three- and four-fold Suzuki coupling reactions with p-methoxytriphenylamine successfully furnished the targets BTT-4 and BTT-5 in 72% and 61% yield, respectively.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic scheme for the preparation of BTT-4 and BTT-5. 
The formation of the aforementioned HTMs was confirmed by using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and high-resolution MALDI-TOF techniques. The 1H NMR spectra reveal the symmetry of the BTT-5 structure, which exhibits only one singlet (δ ≈ 7.38 ppm) for the β protons of thiophene rings (see the ESI for details†). In contrast, BTT-4 is less symmetric and shows three different singlets for the β protons at δ ≈ 8.04, 8.03 and 7.78 ppm.
Structural and electronic properties
To gain more insight into the effects that the isomerism of the BTT core has on the structural and electronic properties of the BTT derivatives, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G** level in the presence of the solvent (CH2Cl2) for the BTT-3, BTT-4 and BTT-5 compounds. The C-3, C-4 and C-5 cores, and the pendant p-methoxytriphenylamine (OMeTPA) group, as well as the reference spiro-OMeTAD compound, were also calculated for comparison purposes (see the ESI for full computational details†).
Fig. S1† summarizes the values calculated at B3LYP/6-31G** for the most representative bond lengths of the BTT cores and derivatives. The C3h-symmetric C-3 core shows similar carbon–carbon (CC) distances of 1.408 and 1.418 Å for the central benzene indicating the aromatic character of this ring. In contrast, the central benzene ring of the C2v-symmetric C-5 core presents quite different bond lengths (from 1.397 to 1.454 Å) showing that the aromatic character is lost. C-5 actually exhibits a single/double CC bond pattern characteristic of a cis-bithiophene where an extra thiophene ring is linked to the central β positions (Fig. S1†). The formation of a bithiophene-type structure favors an efficient π-conjugation path. The C-4 core can be considered as an intermediate case where the aromatic character of the central benzene ring is still maintained although it presents larger differences between the CC bond lengths compared with C-3. The structural features discussed for the BTT cores are preserved in the extended BTT-3, BTT-4 and BTT-5 derivatives, the main difference being the lengthening of the peripheral CC and carbon–sulfur bonds to which the OMeTPA groups are attached. Despite the bulky OMeTPA groups, BTT-3 and BTT-4 exhibit quite planar structures that, in principle, can favor stacking aggregation in the solid state. In contrast, BTT-5 presents a more crowded structure due to the presence of four OMeTPA arms (Fig. S2†).

Fig. 2 displays the frontier molecular orbitals calculated for the OMeTPA pendant groups, the BTT cores, the BTT-based HTMs and spiro-OMeTAD. The structural changes discussed above are in line with the electronic properties computed for the BTT derivatives. For instance, the HOMO/LUMO of the BTT cores is significantly destabilized/stabilized in passing from C-3 (−5.79/−0.89 eV) to C-4 (−5.67/−1.22 eV) and to C-5 (−5.36/−1.56 eV). This destabilization/stabilization is due to the more effective conjugation of the core, especially for C-5, and gives rise to a decrease of the HOMO–LUMO gap along the series. The topology of the HOMO for C-5 indeed resembles that computed for the HOMO of 2,2′-bithiophene, following the single/double CC bond conjugated pathway with no contribution from the sulfur atoms.35,36 The HOMO of the three-armed and four-armed BTT derivatives is destabilized when compared with the respective cores owing to the antibonding interaction with the OMeTPA units (Fig. 2). BTT-3 exhibits doubly-degenerate HOMO and LUMO levels which mainly spread over the OMeTPA groups. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO of BTT-4, and especially of BTT-5, show a larger contribution of the BTT cores. The energy of the HOMOs, similarly to that found for the BTT cores, undergoes a destabilization in passing from BTT-3 (−4.73 eV) to BTT-4 (−4.61 eV) and to BTT-5 (−4.50 eV) approaching the HOMO level calculated for the archetypical spiro-OMeTAD HTM (−4.44 eV). It is to be noted that a significant charge transfer takes place from the peripheral OMeTPA groups to the central BTT unit. The BTT core has a total net charge of −0.39e for BTT-3 and BTT-4 that increases to −0.45e for BTT-5 due to its four-armed structure. The electronic structure of the BTT HTMs is therefore predicted to be significantly polarized.

Electrochemical properties and reorganization energies
The electrochemical properties of the sulfur-rich BTT-based HTMs were studied by cyclic voltammetry in TBAPF6/CH2Cl2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 3a). Table 1 summarizes the redox potentials of BTT-3, BTT-4 and BTT-5, and also includes the HOMO energies estimated from the first half-wave oxidation potential (Eox1/2). As shown in Fig. 3a, the chemical structure of the isomeric BTT core has a strong influence on the electrochemical properties of the BTT derivatives. The cyclic voltammogram of BTT-3 shows only one oxidation wave with an E1/2 value of 0.93 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). This oxidation wave is assigned to a simultaneous three-electron oxidation process, where, according to the frontier molecular orbitals computed for BTT-3 (Fig. 2 and S3†), the three electrons are extracted mainly from the triphenylamines with some contribution from the BTT core. BTT-4 is a slightly better donor than BTT-3 and exhibits three reversible oxidation waves. The first oxidation wave at Eox1/2 = 0.89 V corresponds to two overlapping oxidation waves, implying the consecutive extraction of one and two electrons, respectively. For BTT-5, the cyclic voltammogram reveals four reversible oxidation waves with E1/2 values of 0.74, 0.89, 1.03 and 1.33 V corresponding to one-, one-, two- and one-electron processes, respectively. The first oxidation wave is assigned to an electron extraction mostly involving the BTT core and two of the OMeTPA arms according to the computed HOMO (Fig. 2). The second and third oxidation waves would involve the extraction of three additional electrons mainly from the OMeTPA groups (Fig. S2†). The values recorded for the first oxidation potential of BTT-3 (0.93 V), BTT-4 (0.89 V) and BTT-5 (0.74 V) are in good agreement with the increasing energy values calculated for the HOMO at B3LYP/6-31G** (Fig. 2).

The HOMO energies experimentally estimated from Eox1/2 are found to be −5.37, −5.33 and −5.18 eV for BTT-3, BTT-4 and BTT-5, respectively. The energy inferred for the HOMO level of BTT-5 is indeed similar to that obtained for the reference spiro-OMeTAD compound (−5.16 eV). Therefore, the novel sulfur-rich HTMs (BTT-4 and BTT-5, as well as BTT-3) feature an excellent band alignment with the valence band edge of the perovskite (ca. −5.4 eV).
The oxidized species (up to the trication for BTT-3 and BTT-4 and up to the tetracation for BTT-5) were also calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G** level for a better understanding of the oxidation processes. Table S1† summarizes the charges accumulated by the BTT cores and the OMeTPA units as oxidation takes place. For BTT-3˙+, the charge is equally extracted from the OMeTPA units with some contribution from the core (0.20e). In contrast, for BTT-4˙+ and BTT-5˙+ the electron is primarily removed from the OMeTAP groups connected to the conjugated 2,2′-bithiophene unit and the BTT core participates in a higher degree (0.25 and 0.30e, respectively). In going to the trication (the tetracation for BTT-5), all the OMeTPA units present a net charge of +1.0e and the BTT cores have lost the excess of electron density they have in the neutral state (Table S1†). The evolution of the charges upon oxidation therefore evidences the cooperative effect between the OMeTPA groups and the conjugated BTT core. It is worth noting that, for BTT-3, the ionization energies (IEs) required for passing from the neutral molecule to the cation (IE1 = 4.66 eV), from the cation to the dication (IE2 = 4.80 eV) and from the dication to the trication (IE3 = 4.92 eV) have similar values. For BTT-4, the IE1 has a smaller value (4.52 eV) and is more separated from the IE2 (4.85 eV) and IE3 (5.00 eV) values that remain close. In contrast, larger energy differences are found for BTT-5 between IE1 (4.38 eV), IE2 (4.83 eV) and IE3 (5.17 eV), whereas the formation of the tetracation requires a similar energy (EI4 = 5.25 eV). These findings explain the different electrochemical behavior found for the BTT derivatives; i.e., the unique three-electron oxidation wave observed for BTT-3, the overlapping one- and two-oxidation waves recorded for BTT-4 and the well-resolved one-, one- and two-electron waves registered for BTT-5 (Fig. 3a).
Hole reorganization energies (λ) were also calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G** level to evaluate the ability of the BTT derivatives as HTMs (see the ESI for computational details†). The λ values computed for the BTT cores are 0.228 (C-3), 0.241 (C-4) and 0.191 eV (C-5). All the BTT cores therefore exhibit reorganization energies smaller than that computed for the OMeTPA group (0.255 eV). For the BTT-OMeTPA derivatives, λ values of 0.097, 0.150 and 0.173 are obtained for BTT-3, BTT-4 and BTT-5, respectively. The λ values computed for the BTT HTMs are smaller than those obtained for their BTT cores due to the participation of the OMeTPA groups in the oxidized species. BTT-3 indeed exhibits a reorganization energy significantly smaller than that calculated for the reference spiro-OMeTAD compound (0.126 eV), and similar to the λ values obtained for other excellent p-type semiconducting organic materials.37,38 The small λ values obtained for the BTT derivatives together with the adequate energy level alignment with the valence band edge of the perovskite highlight the potential of this BTT family of compounds as hole-transporting materials for PSC devices.
Photophysical properties
The photophysical properties of the new HTMs were inspected by means of UV-vis absorption and fluorescence and compared with those of the previously described BTT-3 (Fig. 3b). Recorded absorption and emission wavelengths are listed in Table 1. In solution, the absorption maxima (λmax,abs) for BTT-3, BTT-4 and BTT-5 are centered at 387 (ε = 1.4 × 104), 397 (ε = 1.1 × 104) and 459 nm (ε = 0.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1), respectively. BTT-4 presents a broader, more complex absorption band than BTT-3 due to the weaker peaks appearing at lower energies derived from the direct conjugation between the two cis thiophene rings, in contrast to the meta arrangement with the central benzene ring in BTT-3. The absorption maximum of BTT-5 is significantly red-shifted in comparison with the other two three-armed compounds due to the enhanced π-electron delocalization, and in agreement with the narrower HOMO–LUMO gap calculated (see the Structural and electronic properties section). An intense absorption band below 350 nm is also registered for BTT-5.
Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations of the lowest-energy singlet excited electronic states (Sn) were performed for BTT-3, BTT-4 and BTT-5 at the B3LYP/6-31G** level in CH2Cl2 (Table S2†). The absorption band centered at 387 nm for BTT-3 is ascribed to two intense, quasi-degenerate electronic transitions (S0 → S1 and S0 → S2) computed slightly lower in energy around 430 nm. These electronic transitions are of π → π* nature and mainly imply one-electron excitations from the degenerate HOMO−1 and HOMO to the degenerate LUMO and LUMO+1, which involve both the BTT core and the peripheral OMeTPA groups (Fig. S2†). For BTT-4, the HOMO and LUMO are not degenerate and TDDFT calculations predict the first five electronic transitions, which are mainly described by one-electron promotions from the HOMO−2, HOMO−1 and HOMO to the LUMO and LUMO+1, in the 378–482 nm range with significant oscillator strengths (Table S2†). These close-energy transitions are responsible for the broad absorption band peaking at 397 nm for BTT-4. Finally, for BTT-5, the HOMO and the LUMO are well separated from the adjacent levels and a dominant S0 → S1 electronic transition with a markedly HOMO → LUMO character is calculated at 524 nm, which is associated with the experimental absorption band appearing in the 460–490 nm range. TDDFT calculations therefore explain the shape of the absorption spectra and correctly predict the red-shift of the lowest-energy S0 → S1 electronic transition in passing from the three-armed BTT-3 and BTT-4 to the four-armed BTT-5.
The emission spectra (Fig. 3b) show broad bands and reveal the same bathochromic shift upon enhanced delocalization from BTT-3 to BTT-5. Large Stoke shifts in the 75–100 nm range are observed for the new HTMs. Optical gaps (E0–0) of 2.87, 2.67 and 2.48 eV were estimated from the absorption and emission intersection for BTT-3, BTT-4 and BTT-5, respectively.
Thermal properties
To unveil the thermal properties of the isomeric BTT derivatives, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed (Fig. S7 and S8†). Thermal properties are gathered in Table 1. Both BTT-4 and BTT-5 exhibit good thermal stability and start decomposing at temperatures (Tdec) above 460 and 430 °C, respectively (5% weight loss under a N2 atmosphere). DSC sheds light on the thermal behavior of the new HTMs. BTT-4 is essentially amorphous showing a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 157 °C, which implies a reduced tendency to crystallize. The first heating cycle of BTT-5 reveals a sharp endothermic peak, corresponding to a melting temperature (Tm) of 317 °C, which is not observed after consecutive heating/cooling cycles. On the second heating cycle, a Tg of 153 °C appears, indicating its crystalline and amorphous nature. Both HTMs exhibit higher Tg than spiro-OMeTAD.
Photovoltaic performance of BTT-4 and BTT-5
The performance of the new HTM molecules BTT-4 and BTT-5 was evaluated in perovskite-based solar cells. Devices were fabricated from a stack of thin films onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass as described in detail in the ESI.† In short, a 30 nm blocking layer is applied by spray pyrolysis onto the FTO followed by 250 nm mesoporous titania. The perovskite layer was prepared in a single-step spin-coating process by spinning the perovskite precursor solution at 5000 rpm for 30 s. After 15 s, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was poured onto a rotating substrate to obtain a smooth perovskite layer after annealing for 40 min at 100 °C. The composition of the perovskite material is (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 with 5% of PbI2 excess. The HTM layer was applied by spin-coating a 20 mM solution of the BTT-4 and BTT-5 molecules in chlorobenzene using tert-butylpyridine, Li-TFSI and FK-209 as dopants. The thickness of the HTM layers was found to be around 100 nm for both molecules. Finally, the gold electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask. The structure of a PSC device can be observed from the cross-sectional SEM image of a representative device using BTT-4 as the HTM, as displayed in Fig. 4.

Photovoltaic testing of the PSC devices was performed under 1 sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight. Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves for BTT-4 and BTT-5 recorded under reverse bias (solid line) and forward bias (dashed lines) scan directions. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized as a table inset. Both molecules show excellent power conversion efficiencies of 18.2% for BTT-5 and 19.0% for BTT-4 with only little hysteresis. This is indeed very similar to that observed for the reference cell using spiro-OMeTAD showing 18.9% PCE (Fig. S5†). The open-circuit potential is around 1.1 V for both the new compounds. Compared to BTT-5, BTT-4 shows a slightly higher short-circuit current of 23.0 mA cm−2 and a better fill factor of 75.3% (22.5 mA cm−2 and 73.3% for BTT-5). The short circuit currents found by J–V measurements match well the ones calculated from the integrated external quantum efficiency measurements shown in Fig. 5b. For both compounds, integrated currents were found to be around 22.5 mA cm−2. To further confirm the efficiencies obtained from the J–V measurements, peak power tracking experiments were performed to monitor the performance of the PSCs at their maximum power point for several minutes (Fig. 5c). The measurements show stabilized efficiencies of 18% for BTT-5 and 19% for BTT-4. The slight decrease in efficiency with time is associated with heating up of the device and is fully recovered after storing the device in dry air overnight. Small statistics for the devices fabricated with BTT-4 and BTT-5 is shown in Fig. 5d. Good reproducibility is achieved for both compounds with average PCE values of 17.9 ± 0.7% for BTT-4 and 17.2 ± 0.6% for BTT-5.

Compared to BTT-3,21 the new HTMs BTT-4 and BTT-5 having asymmetric central cores show enhanced device efficiencies. This is especially true for BTT-4, which can be directly compared with BTT-3, as both molecules have three side arms, and shows a remarkable improvement from around 18% to 19%. We think that the sulfur atoms facing each other in the BTT core of BTT-4 and BTT-5 may further benefit the interaction with the perovskite material, thus allowing even better hole extraction compared to BTT-3. On the other hand, the asymmetric core might as well have influence on the packing of the HTM molecules, which could be the reason for an increased hole mobility or conductivity.
The results were further confirmed by comparing the conductivity of the BTT-based HTMs. Fig. 6 shows the current–voltage plot of the BTT derivatives including the corresponding conductivity values. For the measurement, the molecules were spin-coated onto substrates having interdigitated gold electrodes (channel length: 2.5 μm) using the same conditions as for the device preparation. The measured conductivity values nicely follow the trend found in the device efficiency. The highest conductivity was observed for the BTT-4 molecule with σ = 5.3 × 10−4 S cm−1. This value is around twenty times higher than that previously reported for BTT-3 (σ = 2.8 × 10−5 S cm−1) and indeed significantly higher than what is reported for spiro-OMeTAD (8.7 × 10−4 S cm−1).39

Conclusions
In summary, we present the syntheses and a systematic study of the impact that the isomerism of the benzotrithiophene (BTT) core has on the optical, electrochemical and photophysical properties and the photovoltaic performance of novel multi-armed hole-transporting materials. The new HTMs (BTT-4 and BTT-5) were obtained by crosslinking the BTT cores with p-methoxytriphenylamines in four simple synthetic steps. The BTT-based molecules are good electron donors, and their HOMO levels are properly aligned with the valence band of the perovskite, which suggests an efficient hole-injection from the HTM. Also, BTT-4 and BTT-5 exhibit good thermal stability of up to 430 °C. Impressive light-to-energy conversion efficiencies of 19% for BTT-4 and 18.2% for BTT-5 are measured, which even surpass the efficiency exhibited by BTT-3 and the widely used spiro-OMeTAD. BTT-4 shows higher conductivity than the other BTT derivatives, which follows the trend found in the device efficiency. We surmise that the cis arrangement of the sulfur atoms facing each other in the BTT-4 core may further benefit the interaction with the perovskite material, thus allowing even better hole extraction. The results presented here further confirm the potential of the BTT family as a highly efficient alternative to the costly spiro-OMeTAD as hole-transporting materials.
