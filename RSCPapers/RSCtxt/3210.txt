    , Accepted 4th November 2018First published on 6th November 2018AbstractCurrently, all inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs) of cesium lead halides (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I) have been mainly fabricated using wet chemical methods. Unfortunately, applications of perovskite QDs have been limited due to their poor stability. In the present work, the in situ growth of whole-family CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite QDs in Zn–P–B–Sb based oxide glass via a glass crystallization strategy is reported. The as-prepared CsPbX3 QDs@glass nanocomposites exhibit typical excitonic recombination emissions and superior chemical stability benefited from the protection of the robust inorganic glass matrix. Through modifying the molar ratio of halide sources in glass, multi-color tunable emissions in the entire visible spectral range of 400–750 nm are achieved. As a result, light-emitting diode devices can be constructed by coupling blue-emissive CsPbBrCl2, green-emissive CsPbBr3 and red-emissive CsPbBr0.5I2.5 QDs@glass powders with a commercial ultraviolet chip, yielding bright white light luminescence with excellent optoelectronic performance.
Introduction
All-inorganic lead halide perovskites CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) have attracted great attention as active media for their promising applications in optoelectronic fields including solar cells, lasers and displays.1–6 Currently, perovskite colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) or quantum dots (QDs) are successfully fabricated and exhibit superior optical performance, such as narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM, up to 12 nm), high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, up to 90%) and tunable emissive color covering a visible full-spectral range.7–11 Notably, one of the main issues is to improve their stability, especially water resistance, as CsPbX3 nanocomposites are ionic crystals and will easily decompose in the moisture environment.12
So far, great endeavors have been made to solve this problem and the stability of CsPbX3 has been improved in part by encapsulating them in polymers or silica.13–22 On the other hand, specially designed inorganic oxide glasses were recently demonstrated to be robust hosts for the incorporation of CsPbX3 perovskites.23–28 One of the key factors of this strategy is to achieve the in situ nucleation/growth of the CsPbX3 crystalline phase within the glass matrix, which is beneficial to protect them from decomposition. Importantly, controlling glass composition and structure is highly demanded to enable CsPbX3 crystallization from glass as well as to realize excellent optical properties. At present, although some CsPbBr3 or CsPbI3 perovskite embedded glasses have been prepared, there is no report on the achievement of crystallization of whole-family CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I and their mixture) QDs from the glass matrix as well as the corresponding visible full-spectral tunable emissions.
Herein, by elaborately designing the Zn–P–B–Sb based glass composition, controllable nanocrystallization of whole-family CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Cl/Br, Br, Br/I, and I) crystals within the glass matrix is achieved via melt-quenching and subsequent heat treatment for the first time. The as-fabricated CsPbX3 perovskite QD embedded glasses (QDs@glass) exhibit tunable visible full-spectral emissions and superior water resistance. As a proof-of-concept experiment, the present QDs@glass nanocomposites are demonstrated to be applicable as blue/green/red color converters in UV-excitable white-light-emitting diodes (wLEDs).
Experimental section

In situ growth of CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) QDs@glass
CsPbX3 QDs@glass samples were synthesized by a melt-quenching route and subsequent crystallization (heat treatment). Glass matrices were designed with molar compositions of 27.3Zn(PO3)2–36.4H3BO3–15Sb2O3–7.7BaCO3–4.5Na2CO3 and the added perovskite-related components were Cs2CO3–PbX2–KX (X = Cl, Br, and I). The raw materials were mixed well and ground into powders, then kept in corundum crucibles and sintered in a muffle at 800 °C for 20 min under an ambient atmosphere. Then the melt was poured into a water-cooled copper mold to obtain a precursor glass (PG). Finally, QDs@glass was obtained after heating a PG at 300–400 °C for 2 h. The QDs@glass products were optically polished or ground into powders for further characterization and usage.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out to identify the crystallized phase structure of the as-prepared samples using a powder diffractometer (MiniFlex600 RIGAKU) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) operating at 40 kV. Microstructural observation of QDs@glass was conducted on a JEOL JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 kV accelerating voltage. PL, PL excitation (PLE) spectra and two-dimensional excitation–emission mapping were recorded using an Edinburgh Instruments (Edinburgh, UK) FS5 spectrofluorometer equipped with a continuous (150 W) lamp. The time-resolved spectra of CsPbX3 QDs@glass samples were recorded using a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, LifeSpec-II) based on a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique with an excitation of 375 nm picosecond laser. PLQY, defined as the ratio of emitted photons to absorbed ones, was determined using a spectrofluorometer (FS5) equipped with a 15 cm integrating sphere and a xenon lamp as the excitation source.
Construction and measurement of QDs@glass-based wLEDs
pc-wLED devices were constructed by coupling the as-fabricated QDs@glass on a GaN ultraviolet (UV, 390 nm) chip. Opaque silica gels were filled around the edges of the device to avoid the leakage of ultraviolet light. Blue-emitting CsPbBrCl2 QDs@glass, green-emitting CsPbBr3 QDs@glass and red-emitting CsPbBr0.5I2.5 QDs@glass powders were blended with the silicone gel A/B in order to directly paint on the surface of the GaN near-ultraviolet chip. Photoelectric parameters, including spectral power and photon distribution of the total radiant flux of the emission spectra, the color rendering index (CRI), the correlated color temperature (CCT), the luminous efficiency (LE), and Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates, were measured using a HAAS-2000 spectroradiometer (Everfine, P. R. China) equipped with an integrating sphere of 50 cm diameter at a forward bias of 20 mA.
Results and discussion
XRD patterns of CsPbBr3 PG and QD@glasses are shown in Fig. 1a. Obviously, the as-prepared PG shows a typical amorphous structure, whereas distinct diffraction peaks gradually appear in the QDs@glass samples prepared with an increase in heat-treating temperature. These diffraction peaks can be well assigned to the (110), (200), (211) and (220) crystalline planes of the cubic CsPbBr3 phase (JCPDS No. 54-0752), respectively. The TEM image of QDs@glass (Fig. 1b) evidences homogeneous precipitation of CsPbBr3 QDs with sizes of 3–8 nm among the glass matrix and their high-crystallinity with well-resolved lattice fringes. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern for an individual CsPbBr3 particle and a typical interplanar spacing of 2.38 Å for the (211) plane are indicated. Based on the FWHM of diffraction peaks, the mean size of the precipitated QDs in glass is calculated to be about 12 nm using the Scherrer formula. Compared to the sizes obtained from TEM observation, the larger sizes determined from XRD patterns were may be due to the partial aggregation of QD particles in glass. Apparently, the yellowish appearance (inset of Fig. 1c) of QDs@glass and the corresponding narrow-band emission located at ∼518 nm with a FWHM of 30 nm (Fig. 1c) further verify the successful crystallization of CsPbBr3 particles among the glass matrix. The PLE spectrum recorded by monitoring 518 nm emission exhibits a broadband excitation feature due to the transition from the valence band to the conduction band of QDs and the absorption spectrum shows a typical exciton absorption peak, indicating that the luminescence of CsPbBr3 QDs derives from direct exciton recombination.29–31 As shown in Fig. 1d, two-dimensional excitation–emission mapping indicates that the emissive position and shape of CsPbBr3 QDs in glass are independent of the wavelengths of incident excitation light, confirming that the green emission is originated from intrinsic exciton recombination instead of defect-related emitting states. Fig. 1e exhibits the time-resolved decay curves of CsPbBr3 PG and QDs@glass samples recorded at different heat-treatment temperatures. Owing to their non-single-exponential features,32,33 the PL decay can be described by the following biexponential fitting τ = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(1)The evaluated lifetime values of PG and QDs@glass samples (crystallization at 300, 350 and 400 °C) are 6.4, 8.3, 9.7 and 11.5 ns, respectively. A lifetime of nanosecond order is one of the typical characteristics of the exciton recombination of CsPbBr3 QDs embedded in glass.27

The fitted curves by a biexponential function have also been provided. 
The dependence of absolute PLQY values on the crystallization temperatures of CsPbBr3 PG and QDs@glass samples are plotted in Fig. 2a and the corresponding quantitative PL spectra are given in Fig. 2b–e. Obviously, the sample heat-treated at 350 °C has a relatively high PLQY (∼30%) compared to that of others. Combined with XRD results, we can draw a conclusion that unheated and heat-treated at relatively low temperature samples have insufficient activation energy for crystallization or precipitation of CsPbBr3 QDs. However, the 400 °C heat-treated sample shows a very low PLQY (∼1.2%), indicating that high temperature may destroy the structure of CsPbBr3 QDs, increase the number of surface defects and ultimately induce emission quenching. Notably, all these PLQY values are relatively low compared with those of colloidal QDs, probably owing to the existence of defect states in QDs produced by high-temperature crystallization as well as the influence of interface defects between QDs and the glass matrix. Temperature-dependent PL spectra of CsPbBr3 QDs@glass were recorded, as shown in Fig. 2f. With the increase of recording temperature, the integrated emission intensity monotonously weakens (Fig. 2g) owing to the enhanced non-radiative transition of excitons. Accordingly, the exciton binding energy (Eb) can be estimated using the following equation29,34 (2)where I(T) and I0 are the emission intensities at temperature T and 0 K, respectively, A is the constant and kB is the Boltzmann constant. As demonstrated in Fig. 2g, the exciton binding energy is determined to be 36 meV, which agrees with previously reported values (35–44 meV)29 for CsPbBr3 perovskites. All these results confirm the successful nanocrystallization of CsPbBr3 within the glass matrix and the realization of intense exciton emission from QDs@glass.

The fitted curve is also provided in (g). 
Furthermore, we tried to fabricate whole-family CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) QDs@glass composites through modifying halogen elements and contents in the investigated Zn–P–B–Sb based glasses. Fig. 3a shows typical XRD patterns of CsPbClmBr3−m (m = 0–3) QDs@glass samples. Evidently, all the crystallized products in glasses are of the pure cubic perovskite phase and the related diffraction peaks monotonously shift towards a higher 2θ angle increasing Cl content, i.e., lattice contraction of QDs is found, which is due to gradual substitution of larger Br− ions by smaller Cl− ones in CsPbClmBr3−m QDs. Impressively, PL spectra evidence that the obtained CsPbX3 QDs@glass composites can yield multi-color tunable emissions in the full-spectral visible wavelength region from 400 nm to 750 nm (Fig. 3b), indicating the successful crystallization of CsPbX3 particles with variable halogen (Cl/Br/I) elements within the glass matrix. Notably, it is still hard to exactly determine Cl/Br and Br/I ratios for the QDs produced after heat-treatment owing to the interference of the glass matrix. Herein, the Cl/Br and Br/I ratios of QDs in glasses were evaluated by comparing their emission spectra with those of colloidal QDs with defined Cl/Br and Br/I ratios prepared by hot-injection. As demonstrated in Fig. 3c, the apparent color of QDs@glass varies from colorless to yellow and finally to dark red with the precipitation of CsPbCl3, CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3 crystals in glasses, respectively. Accordingly, the luminescence of QDs@glass products is colorful under the irradiation of a UV lamp and the modification of halogen elements can lead to violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red and dark red emissive colors (Fig. 3c). As shown in Fig. 3d, the change in the crystallized phase from CsPbCl3 to CsPbBr3 and finally to CsPbI3 induces the gradual increase of decay lifetime owing to the enlarged bandgap of QDs in the glass matrix. This phenomenon has been previously observed for the colloidal CsPbX3 QDs,7,11,29,32,35 certainly confirming that the CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I and their mixtures) QDs are indeed precipitated in the present Zn–P–B–Sb based glass.

(d) Time-resolved PL traces of CsPbCl3, CsPbCl2Br, CsPbBr3, CsPbBr2I, and CsPbI3 QDs@glass samples under excitation of a 375 nm picosecond laser. 
To explore the stability of the as-prepared QDs@glass, including water resistance and thermal stability, a series of tests were carried out. Firstly, a typical CsPbBr3 QDs@glass sample was directly immersed into aqueous solution for a time period and the corresponding PL spectra were recorded. As shown in Fig. 4a, remnant PL remains ∼70% of the initial emission intensity after immersing in water for 10 days, and the luminescence tends to be stable even after storing for up to 30 days. By contrast, the PL of colloidal CsPbBr3 QDs is quickly quenched after immersing in aqueous solution only for 2 h (inset of Fig. 4a). As evidenced in Fig. 4b, CsPbBr3 QDs@glass in aqueous solution retains its bright green luminescence over a period of 30 days. Consequently, it is concluded that the present Zn–P–B–Sb based inorganic glass matrix can indeed provide an effective protection for perovskite QDs against decomposition in water and significantly enhance its moisture resistance. Secondly, a representative CsPbBrCl2 QDs@glass was subjected to a cyclic heating/cooling procedure to evaluate its related thermal stability. The variation in PL intensity with the increase/decrease of temperature is plotted in Fig. 4c. Impressively, the as-prepared nanocomposite exhibits superior thermal stability, i.e., the excitonic emission intensity of QDs can remain about 70–80% of the original one after experiencing two heating/cooling cycles at 150 and 200 °C.

(c) Temperature-dependent emission intensity of CsPbBrCl2 QDs@glass obtained via heating/cooling cycles at 150 and 200 °C. 
Finally, we demonstrate promising applications for the as-prepared full-spectral emissive CsPbX3 QDs@glass composites as color converters in solid-state lighting. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, CsPbBrCl2, CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr0.5I2.5 QDs@glass powders dispersed in the silicone gel respectively yield three primary colors of blue, green, and red under UV lamp irradiation. Importantly, bright and stable white-light can be produced for their mixtures benefited from the protection role of inorganic oxide glass and thus the prohibited anion exchange among these three kinds of QDs. As a proof-of-concept experiment, light-emitting-diode (LED) devices were constructed by blue, green, and red QDs@glass powders and their mixtures with a UV chip. Electroluminescence (EL) spectra show a blue emission band assigned to CsPbBrCl2 QDs, a green one atrributed to CsPbBr3 QDs and a red one originated from CsPbBr0.5I2.5 QDs (Fig. 5b–d). The appropriate adjustment of the molar ratio (2:1:2) of blue, green and red QD@glass powders in the silicone gel can finally lead to bright white-light luminescence for the constructed LED device with a CRI of 72, a CCT of 5850 K and a LE of 18 lm W−1 (Fig. 5e). Finally, the color coordinates of QDs@glass-based devices in operation are labeled in the CIE chromaticity diagram (Fig. 5f). Impressively, the designed LED devices exhibit a wide color gamut of blue/green/red (white triangle), covering up to about 125% of the National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) TV color standard (black triangle).

Conclusions
In summary, CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I and their mixture) perovskite QD embedded glasses have been successfully fabricated via an in situ nanocrystallization strategy. Full-spectral visible emissions assigned to the intrinsic exciton recombination of QDs in glasses can be easily realized by simply modifying halogen elements in glasses. Importantly, compared to the colloidal counterparts, the moisture resistance and thermal stability of QDs in glass were remarkably improved owing to the effective protection of the inorganic oxide glass matrix for QDs against decomposition by the external environment. As a consequence, a prototype white light-emitting diode device was designed using the as-prepared blue/green/red QDs@glass nanocomposites as color converters, certainly suggesting their promising applications in optoelectronics fields.
