    , Accepted 1st February 2019First published on 1st February 2019AbstractThree novel fullerene derivatives containing a C60-fluorene core and thiophenyl, terthiophenyl and tetrathiophenyl groups grafted at the 2-position of the fluorene ring, respectively, were synthesized and characterized. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated systematically. The results showed that their UV-vis absorption bands in the range of 350–500 nm were much wider and stronger than that of the traditional fullerene derivative PC61BM, and the LUMO energy levels of the synthesized fullerene derivatives were gradually up-shifted by increasing of the number of thiophene rings in the oligothiophene units.
1. Introduction
The urgent demand for low-cost, environmentally-friendly energy sources is constantly stimulating the development of efficient, simple, low-cost organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). Nowadays, with the rapid progress of organic semiconductors, the popularization and application of low-cost solar power generation technology has become possible. Compared with traditional silicon-based and other inorganic solar cells, OPVs have the following unique advantages, such as easy fabrication, low cost, lightweight, and the possibility to achieve large areas and flexible production.1–3 Due to the huge potential of these advantages, OPVs have become an important development direction for the new generation of solar cells. Over the past decade, OPVs have undergone significant development and achievement, and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 15%.4,5
Generally, OPVs adopt a sandwich structure of a transparent electrode/photoactive layer/metal electrode, and the active layer is the core component of OPVs.6–8 The active layer is usually composed of the donor material and acceptor material. So far, the donor materials have been extensively developed, including the wide band gap donors P3HT9,10 and PBDT-FBTA,11 the medium wide band gap donors PDBTT112 and PBDB-T13 and the narrow band gap donors PTB7-Th.14 The electron acceptors with excellent performance play an equally important role in improving the power conversion of OPVs. In the field of acceptor materials, the fullerene derivatives, such as PC61BM and PC71BM, are still the most widely used electron acceptor materials in OPVs until now due to their good solubility in aromatic solvents, strong electron accepting capability and excellent electron mobility.15–17 Other typical fullerene-based electron acceptors include various PC61BM analogues with different ester alkyl chains18,19 or different aromatic groups,20–22 and indene-C60 or -C70 bisadduct (IC60BA or IC70BA).16,17,23 However, the fullerene-based electron acceptors also suffer from unconquerable drawbacks, such as narrow wavelength absorption, high affinity, poor solubility, which have severely limited their wide application as electron acceptors for organic solar cells and have largely hampered further improvement of the device performance. Recently, some non-fullerene-based organic small molecule electron acceptor materials have drawn much attention due to their attractive advantages, such as adjustable energy level, facile synthesis, good solubility, low processing cost and wide absorption in the visible spectrum for higher power conversion efficiency, which include fluoranthene-fused imide-based acceptors,24,25 1,4-diketopyrrolo-[3,4-c]-pyrrole-based acceptors,26,27 benzothiadiazole-based acceptors,28,29 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (99′BF)-based acceptors,30–32 fused-ring electron acceptors13,33,34 and so on.
At present, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on P3HT/PC61BM showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4–5% by solvent annealing and thermal annealing.35–37 However, due to the fact that light absorption range of PC61BM is mainly in the ultraviolet region, in the visible region and near-infrared region, there is little absorption, thus its contribution to the photocurrent is weak. Furthermore, the LUMO energy level of PC61BM is too low, which does not match the energy levels of P3HT, limiting the open circuit voltage (Voc) of OPVs.38–40 Based on the above two factors, the efficiency of the solar cells fabricated from the P3HT/PC61BM system is difficult to further improve. In order to overcome these shortcomings of PC61BM, in this work, we try to increase the LUMO energy level of fullerene derivatives by grafting C60 onto 9-position of fluorene by double bond, and by attaching the oligothiophene moiety to the C60-fluorene core to improve absorption of the fullerene derivatives in the visible region. The modification of the fullerene derivatives is different from the traditional modification method of PC61BM analogues.
The fluorene core is a planar framework with a highly delocalized π-system and appropriate energy levels. The purpose of grafting C60 onto 9-position of fluorene is to improve energy levels of the target molecule and make them more universal. Furthermore, in order to overcome the narrow band absorption of traditional PC61BM, the fluorene unit is used to reduce the symmetry of C60 and broaden the absorption band. Moreover, attaching an oligothiophene moiety to the C60-fluorene core could increase the conjugate range of the whole molecule and extend the absorption band to the long wave region. From the above discussion, three novel fullerene derivatives, FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60, were synthesized and characterized (Fig. 1), and their photophysical and electrochemical properties, and thermal stabilities were comprehensively investigated.

3. Results and discussion

FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 had been synthesized by the tosylhydrazone routes.42 Firstly, through a Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling reaction,43,44 the appropriate fluorenone derivatives containing thiophenyl, terthiophenyl and tetrathiophenyl groups were prepared as previously described.41 Secondly, the appropriate fluorenone derivatives were treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide catalyzed by hydrochloric acid in boiling methanol to transform them into the fluorene tosylhydrazone intermediate I, II and III, respectively, with moderate yields after purification by recrystallization from methanol. Finally, the target fullerene derivatives (FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60) were obtained by a one-pot reaction by treating the appropriate fluorene tosylhydrazone intermediates with C60 in the presence of sodium methoxide in a boiling solvent mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and pyridine. The conversion process of the fluorene tosylhydrazone intermediates to the fullerene derivatives, underwent three reaction procedures:45 (1) the relatively unstable diazo compounds were produced in situ by the base-induced decomposition of tosylhydrazone derivatives (I, II and III), which were not required to be purified prior to addition of C60; (2) the diazo compounds were rapidly trapped by C60 to produce [5,6] isomers by the above one-pot reaction procedure; (3) the conversion of [5,6] isomers to the [6,6]-closed methanofullerenes (FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60) were accomplished by heating at 180 °C.
Three final compounds (FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60) were characterized by 1H NMR, MS and FT-IR spectroscopy. In the 1H NMR spectra of the corresponding precursors I, II and III, the proton at the 1-position of the fluorene ring could be differentiated by the higher field 1H NMR signals (<8.5 ppm), while in their target compounds (FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60) the chemical shifts of the proton at the 1-position of the fluorene ring move to the lower field (>8.9 ppm). It may be due to the fact that C60 has stronger electron absorption than the carbonyl group, which reduced the electron cloud density of the proton at the 1-position of the fluorene ring and resulted in a deshielding effect. In the FT-IR spectra of the target compounds (FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60), the strong characteristic absorption peaks of C60 appear at ca. 520 cm−1. The specific absorption bands of 2925 (2924) and 2848 (2847) cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of –CH3 and –CH2–, respectively. In addition, the medium-strong absorption bands at 1610–1606 and 1580–1569 cm−1 were due to the aromatic CC stretching vibrations. In the HRMS spectra of FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60, mass peaks corresponding to FST-C60 (1078.1714), FTT-C60 (1243.1591) and FFT-C60 (1437.2693) were observed.
In order to compare the UV-vis absorption spectra of the target compounds with those of C60 and PC61BM, the UV-vis absorption spectra of C60, PC61BM and the target compounds in toluene solution are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption spectrum of C60 exhibits four main absorption bands at 335, 407, 540 and 599 nm, in which the absorption band at 335 nm is an intense band, while the latter three absorption bands are very weak. The absorption spectrum of FST-C60 is similar to that of PC61BM, FST-C60 exhibits an intense absorption band at 329 nm and four weak absorption bands at 329, 437, 499 and 691 nm, PC61BM shows an intense absorption band at 331 and three weak absorption bands at 433, 499 and 697 nm. In the absorption spectra of FTT-C60 and FFT-C60, there is an intense absorption band at 335 nm and a broad and stronger absorption band from 350 to 500 nm, together with the appearance of a weak broad band from 500 to 650 nm and a small distinct peak at ∼700 nm.
 Fig. 2  UV-vis absorption spectra of FST-C60, FTT-C60, FFT-C60, PC61BM and C60 in toluene solution (C = 1.0 × 10−5 mol L−1). The inset shows a magnified view of the absorption edges for the compounds. 
From the UV-vis absorption spectra of the target compounds and C60 and PC61BM, three obvious characteristics can be found. In the UV range below 360 nm, C60, PC61BM and three target compounds exhibit nearly the same absorption bands, which are attributed to the strong allowed transition of the fullerene core.46 In the visible region where the transition is mostly symmetry forbidden for the highly symmetric molecule of C60, the broad absorption bands from 450 to 650 nm for PC61BM and three target compounds slightly blue-shift in contrast to that of C60. From Fig. 2, the maximum molar extinction coefficients of FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 were 1.23 × 105, 1.30 × 105 and 1.68 × 105 (M−1 cm−1), respectively. It can be found that the maximum molar extinction coefficients of these compounds were higher than that of PCBM (0.39 × 105 M−1 cm−1).
Besides, when compared with the UV-vis spectrum of FST-C60, the absorption band from 350 to 500 nm of FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 greatly red-shifted and the absorption intensity enhanced with the increase in the number of thiophene rings. This is mainly due to the conjugation increase by the introduction of the terthiophenyl unit and the quaterthiophenyl unit to the fluorene ring, which results in the red-shifting of absorption bands. On the other hand, the presence of hyperconjugation effects between the thiophene rings and the aliphatic chain also increase the conjugate and molar absorptivity of the oligothiophene units, which clearly enhances the absorbance of the molecules.
To investigate the frontier orbitals of FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to investigate their electrochemical behavior. Their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were calculated from the onset of oxidation potentials of their cyclic voltammetry measurements, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were deduced from their HOMO energy levels and the optical band gaps were determined from their extrapolated UV-vis absorption edges. The cyclic voltammograms of PC61BM, FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The onset oxidation potentials (Eox) for PC61BM, FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 are 1.17, 1.15, 0.96 and 0.85 V versus Ag/Ag+, respectively. From their onset oxidation potentials, the HOMO energy levels of PC61BM, FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 were calculated according to the equation:47 HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71), where Eox is the onset oxidation potential (V) versus Ag/Ag+. The HOMO energy levels of PC61BM, FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 were calculated to be −5.88, −5.86, −5.67 and −5.56 eV, respectively. The optical band edges of PC61BM, FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 were estimated to be at ca. 654, 653, 655 and 657 nm, which correspond to 1.90, 1.90, 1.89 and 1.89 eV. Therefore, the LUMO energy levels of PC61BM, FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 were calculated to be −3.98, −3.96, −3.78 and −3.67 eV, respectively. This indicates that the LUMO energy levels of FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 up-shift by −0.02, −0.20 and −0.31 eV as compared to PC61BM.
In order to visually compare the energy levels of the target compounds with those of the traditional donor and acceptor materials P3HT and PC61BM, Fig. 3 depicts the corresponding HOMO/LUMO energy diagram of FST-C60, FTT-C60, FFT-C60, P3HT and PC61BM.

In improving the power conversion efficiency of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, three main aspects should be focused: (1) the spectral overlap of the constituting donor and acceptor compounds with respect to the solar irradiance, (2) the charge carrier generation and (3) the transport and collection properties.48 Concerning charge separation and electron transport properties, fullerenes and their soluble derivatives have proved to be the most efficient materials for solar cell applications among the currently available acceptors. So far, the regioregular P3HT and PC61BM represent the promising organic solar cell materials. However, the excessively low LUMO energy level of PC61BM results in a low open circuit voltage (Voc, ca. 0.6 V) of the devices based on P3HT/PC61BM, which limits further improvement of the device efficiency. Strategies must be developed to improve light harvesting and charge carrier transport in the most common solar cell based on P3HT/PC61BM for enhanced solar cell performance. Furthermore, more and more researchers have recognized the importance of reducing ΔEHOMO between the donor and acceptor in the devices, which is advantageous for reducing the Eloss and thus obtaining a high Voc.49 The Voc in organic solar cells depends on the energy difference between the ionization potential (HOMO) of the donor component and the electron affinity (LUMO) of the acceptor component forming the heterojunction. Thus, for increasing the efficiency of the bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells, various new donor and acceptor photovoltaic materials have been developed in recent years.
For P3HT-based OPV, the development of new acceptors with the up-shifted LUMO energy levels and the appropriate HOMO energy levels is important to improve the Voc and PCE. As shown in Fig. 3, it is found that the LUMO energy levels of the synthesized new fullerene derivatives were gradually up-shifted to be −3.96 to −3.67 eV as the number of thiophene rings in oligothiophene units increased. The LUMO energy off-set values between P3HT and FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 are 1.26, 1.08 and 0.97 eV, respectively, which are less than that of P3HT and PC61BM (1.28 eV). In addition, the Voc of a donor/acceptor bulk-heterojunction cell is directly related to the energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor component. The energy differences between the HOMO level of P3HT and FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 are 0.84, 1.02 and 1.13 eV, which are greater than that of P3HT and PC61BM (0.82 eV). It means that larger open circuit voltages are expected when FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 are used as the electron acceptors in P3HT-based OPVs.50
Theoretically, the grafting of alkyl-thiophene is expected to improve the solubility of fullerene derivatives. However, in the experiment we found that the solubility of FST-C60 is still very poor, while the solubility of FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 is greatly improved, but not excellent. In the process of fabricating photovoltaic devices, it was found that the power conversion efficiencies of the devices were very low. It may be caused by poor film formation and other factors.
The thermal stabilities of FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 were investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements under a nitrogen atmosphere, and their TGA curves are shown in Fig. 4. The compound FST-C60 displays good thermal stability up to 330 °C (<1% weight loss), with increasing temperature, there are two sharp weight losses in its TGA curve at 340 and 433 °C, it shows that FST-C60 undergoes two large-stage decomposition processes. Compared with FST-C60, the compounds FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 exhibit higher thermal stability up to 375 °C (<1% weight loss). With increasing temperature, the compound FFT-C60 undergoes one large-stage decomposition process at 392 °C, while the compound FTT-C60 undergoes two large-stage decomposition processes at 392 and 570 °C.

4. Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized three novel fullerenes derivatives, FST-C60, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60, containing a C60-fluorene core and thiophenyl, terthiophenyl and tetrathiophenyl groups grafted at the 2-position of the fluorene ring. These compounds exhibit good thermal stability. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of FST-C60 is very similar to that of PC61BM, while the UV-vis absorption bands of FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 in the range of 350 to 500 nm gradually widen and strengthen with the increase in the thiophene ring number. The LUMO energy levels of the synthesized fullerene derivatives are gradually up-shifted with the increase in the number of thiophene rings in oligothiophene units, and their LUMO energy levels up-shift by −0.02, −0.20 and −0.31 eV as compared to PC61BM. From the point of view of the LUMO energy level, FTT-C60 and FFT-C60 have better energy level matching with P3HT than PC61BM. Through further structural modification, these compounds are expected to be better photovoltaic acceptor materials.
