    , Accepted 3rd July 2013First published on 3rd July 2013AbstractCollective surface plasmons (SPs) generated by two-dimensional (2-D) Au nanostructures are attractive for developing miniaturized photonic devices with sub-wavelength plasmonic structures and bimolecular sensors with single molecule sensitivity. However, high-fidelity methods for fabricating ordered arrays of AuNPs with nanoscale precision are limited. Herein, the fabrication of AuNP hierarchical structures with tunable domain spacing controlled precisely by Au phage peptide (A3) end-functionalized poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) domains in a hexagonally packed polystyrene-PMMA block copolymer (BCP-A3) thin films is demonstrated. Dynamic thermal field processing techniques control the BCP-A3 orientation and ordered-assembly, thus controlling the arrangement of AuNP superstructures from hexagonal clusters to parallel wires.
Introduction
Controlled organization of AuNPs into multi-dimensional and morphologically addressable arrays is a scalable approach to emerging applications in single molecule surface-enhanced spectroscopy,1–3 colorimetric sensing,4,5 high efficiency solar cells,6 as well as logic and memory devices.7,8 Two dimensional (2-D) highly-ordered AuNP arrays have the potential to miniaturize photonic devices based on surface plasmon (SP) properties to a scale much smaller than currently possible.9–18 Concentrating light with highly-ordered 2-D AuNP arrays leads to significantly enhanced electromagnetic fields which affords construction of plasmonic sensors for molecular information decoding.19–23 Due to large signal enhancement, well-defined AuNP assemblies maximize the signal-to-noise ratios that enable single molecule detection. Highly ordered nanostructured Au substrates are central to the development of emerging applications in molecular detection.24 Techniques such as electron beam (E-Beam) lithography and focused ion beam (FIB) lithography have progressively advanced “top-down” strategies for generating tunable metallic surfaces with high integration density and small dimension.25–29 However, E-Beam and FIB methods are expensive and time-consuming, especially at scales below 100 nm, and developing patterns over large areas remains challenging. Moreover, these methods are not able to approach length scales below 20 nm.
Recent synthetic advances have enabled the formation of complex nanostructures from the “bottom-up”. AuNP-loaded membranes have been made through solvent-evaporation,30 controlled flowing31 and spinning induced assembly of BCP.32 However, defects limit the generation of highly-ordered surface patterns over large areas with the above methods. Programmable DNA chains have been shown to be effective in guiding well-defined nanoparticle assemblies with tunable morphologies and dimensionalities in buffered aqueous solution.33–36 Even though well-defined AuNP superlattice can be incubated with this method, two issues limit their use in solid-state device integration: limited scalability and the structural instability during processing and drying. Nanocomposites based on interactions between AuNPs and functionalized polymers have shown higher stability and many groups have shown that well-defined block copolymer arrays can be fabricated over macroscopic distance.37–47 Nevertheless, there is a thermodynamic and kinetic gap that separates the respective phase behavior of the thin film and bulk materials due to surface interactions and finite size effects. The gap further limits the transfer of highly-ordered arrays from bulk to thin film.43,48 Investigators have selectively deposited surface functionalized AuNPs that were tuned to have wetting preference to one block, onto polymer thin films with microphase separation.31,48–52 While the approach overcomes the thermodynamic issues, it introduced additional challenges regarding the optimal nanoparticle surface modification.
In this work, we demonstrate a scalable thermally directed self-assembly (DSA) approach to directly manipulate 2-D hierarchical AuNP arrays on the surface of Au phage peptide-end functionalized block copolymer (BCP-A3) thin films with well-defined nanopatterns with both vertical and horizontal orientations. Selectively engineering Au-binding affinity via DSA driven A3 peptide tethered to the chain end of one of the block copolymer phase allows for versatile patterned peptide expression on the BCP surface and consequent AuNP surface patterning. Kinetically controlled binding of AuNP from aqueous solution yielded statistically significant hexagonally close packed AuNP clusters and parallel Au nanowires.

Cuprous bromide (CuBr, Aldrich, 98%) was freshly purified by stirring in acetic acid overnight, washed with acetone, and dried in vacuum.
Alkyne-A3 peptide synthesis
A3 peptide (AYSSGAPPMPPF) was synthesized on an automated solid phase peptide synthesizer (CEM Liberty 1 Microwave Peptide Synthesizer) using standard Fmoc chemistry. The preloaded Fmoc-Phe-Wang resin substitution was 0.65 meq. g−1 and the reaction scale was 0.1 mmol. The peptide was derivatized at the N-terminus with 5-hexynoic acid using DIC (154 μL, 1 mmol) and HOBT (153 mg, 10 mmol) in DMF (5 mL). The reaction was performed at room temperature for 3 h. Then the resin was thoroughly washed and the alkyne functionalized A3 peptide was cleaved from the resin using standard conditions. The alkyne-A3 peptide was triturated, precipitated in cold diethyl ether and collected via centrifugation.
Polystyrene-Br
Purified styrene (10.00 g, 0.94 mol), methyl 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate (22 mg, 0.11 mmol), CuBr (20 mg, 0.14 mmol) and anhydrous toluene (15 mL) were added into a 250 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The mixture was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles. PMDETA (24.0 mg, 0.14 mmol) was introduced into the mixture under nitrogen. Following three additional freeze–pump–thaw cycles, the flask was immersed into a 110 °C oil bath. After 33 h, the reaction was quenched with liquid nitrogen. The reaction solution was passed through the column filled with silica gel to remove the Cu. The polymer was precipitated in cold MeOH, polystyrene and collected by vacuum filtration.
Polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)-Br
Polystyrene-Br (Mn = 42.1 kDa, 500 mg, 0.012 mmol), methyl methacrylate (892 mg, 8.92 mmol), CuBr (2.1 mg, 0.015 mmol) and anhydrous anisole (10 mL) were added to a 100 mL reaction flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The solution was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles. PMDETA (2.5 mg, 0.015 mmol) was added to the mixture under nitrogen. Following three additional freeze–pump–thaw cycles, the flask was immersed into an oil bath at 80 °C for 10 h and then quenched with liquid nitrogen. The reaction solution was passed through a column filled with silica gel. PS-b-PMMA-Br was precipitated by dropwise addition into cold diethyl ether and collected by vacuum filtration. The block copolymer (480 mg) was obtained after drying in vacuum for 24 h.
Polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)-N3
Polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)-Br (PS Mn = 42.1 kDa, PMMA Mn = 17.4 kDa, 450 mg, 0.008 mmol), sodium azide (10 mg, 0.16 mmol) and anhydrous DMF (10 mL) were added into a 50 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 48 h. The solution was diluted with 250 mL CHCl3 and washed with water 4 times to remove excess sodium azide. After removing the majority of solvent, the block copolymer was precipitated into diethyl ether and collected by vacuum filtration. The polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)-N3 was obtained after drying under vacuum for 24 h and the yield was 86.7% (390 mg).
Polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)-A3
Polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)-N3 (350.0 mg, 0.006 mmol), alkyne-A3 peptide (39.4 mg, 0.03 mmol), PMDETA (4.0 mg, 2.0 × 10−2 mmol) and anhydrous DMF (5 mL) were added to a 100 mL reaction flask with a magnetic stirrer. After polymer and peptide were dissolved, the mixture was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles. CuBr (3.0 mg, 0.02 mmol) was added under protection of nitrogen and following three additional freeze–pump–thaw cycles, the flask was stirred at 60 °C for 72 h. The solution was diluted with 250 mL of CHCl3 and washed with saturated NaCl solution 4 times to remove metal salts and excess alkyne-A3 peptide. Anhydrous MgSO4 was added to remove water from the collected polymer–peptide solution before vacuum filtration. After removing the majority of the solvent, the bioconjugate was precipitated into diethyl ether and collected by vacuum filtration. The polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate)-A3 was obtained after drying under vacuum for 24 h and the yield was 33.5% (120 mg).
AuNP synthesis
An aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (1 mM, 50 mL) was heated to boiling for 30 min. Then a trisodium citrate solution (5 mL, 38.8 mM) was quickly added into the solution. As soon as the initial color changed to red, the solution was allowed to cool to ambient temperature and stored and protected from light. The concentration of the AuNPs was calculated based on the average size (d = 12 nm by TEM) and density (19.3 g cm−3) of AuNPs.
BCP thin film preparation
Amorphous quartz substrates were rinsed in toluene followed by 1 h of ultraviolet-ozone (UVO) treatment. PS-b-PMMA-A3 block copolymer films were spin-coated (4500 rpm, 30 s) from toluene solution (2.0 wt%) onto the UVO cleaned substrates. Prior to the annealing process, residual solvent was removed by drying samples at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum. Oven annealed samples were kept in a vacuum oven at 180 °C for 48 h to achieve a stable morphology that did not evolve further with time. Cold Zone Annealing-Sharp (CZA-S) and Cold Zone Annealing-SoftShear (CZA-SS) were performed using a temperature gradient (∇T) of 45 °C mm−1 at varying annealing velocities from 5 μm s−1 to 100 μm s−1. The maximum temperature (Tmax) of the temperature gradient was set at 210 °C. Although 210 °C is normally above the peptide degradation temperature, the short exposure time due to continuous annealing process does not appear to degrade the peptide groups to prevent its interaction with the AuNPs.
Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)
SEC analysis was performed with a Waters 150-C Plus instrument equipped with three HR-Styragel columns (100 Å mixed bed 50/500/103/104 Å, mixed bed 103/104/106 Å) and a double detector system (differential refractometer, Waters 410; laser light scattering detector, Wyatt Technology, DAWN EOS, λ = 670 nm) with THF as solvent (flow rate = 1.0 mL min−1, T = 30 °C). Regular SEC calibrations were conducted with PS standards (Polymer Laboratories).

1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)

1H NMR spectra were performed in CDCl3 with a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer. The spectra were referenced to the residual protons in CDCl3 at 7.25 ppm. Typical acquisition parameters were a relaxation delay of 1 s, an observed pulse of 7.1 μs corresponding to a 90° flip angle and a scan number of 128. Data was analyzed using Varian software VNMRJ VERSION 2.2 REVISION C.
Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
The experiment was preformed with a Bruker HCT Ultra II quadrupole ion-trap (QIT) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Samples were prepared by adding methanol (20% v/v) to water. Sample solutions were introduced by direct infusion into the instrument at a rate of 360 μL h−1 using a syringe pump. A potential of +4.0 kV (negative ion mode) was applied to the entrance of the sampling capillary, which is orthogonal to the grounded spraying needle. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizing gas (10 psi), which flows coaxially with the spray and aids in the formation of charged droplets, and as the drying gas (8 L min−1, 300 °C), which heats the sampling capillary to help in the droplet desolvation process. Ions were allowed to accumulate up to a maximum time of 200 ms before mass-selective ejection through ramping up of the RF potential of the ring electrode for m/z measurement. Data analysis was done by Compass Data Analysis Version 4.0.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
FTIR spectrum were measured with an Excalibur Series FT-IR spectrometer (DIGILAB, Randolph, MA) through casting polymer films on KBr disks. Data analysis was performed with Win-IR Pro Software.
UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis)
UV-Vis spectra were measured with a HP 8453 UV-Vis Spectrometer. AuNP thin films loaded on transparent quartz substrates were fixed in front of the pinhole and the signal was accumulated for 30 s for each measurement. Background was subtracted by performing the same measurement with a blank quartz substrate. Data was analyzed with UV-Visible ChemStation Software.
Cold zone annealing (CZA)
The structural design of our modified zone annealing apparatus is based on the design concept described previously by Lovinger et. al.53 Low molecular weight PDMS oil (“Thermal C10” Julabo USA Inc.,) is circulated at −5 °C using a recirculating bath (Julabo F12-ED Refrigerated/Heating Circulator) to cool the cold blocks. The hot zone is generated by a low resistance (0.025 Ω cm−1) nickel-chrome wire covered with a 3 mm (outer diameter) ceramic insulation that is powered with a high current source (Digital DC Power Supply, Model 1692, B&K Precision Corp.). The cold blocks are separated from the nickel–chromium wire at a distance of 1 mm. The height of the wire is fine tuned so as to achieve desired ∇Tmax of 45 °C mm−1. The temperature gradients thus produced are characterized using a thermal IR imaging camera having an accuracy of 0.1 °C (Testo 875 Thermal Imager).
Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
QCM measurements were performed on QE401-F1343 (Biolin Scientific/Q-Sense, Västra Frölunda, SWEDEN) with the sensors of QSX303 SiO2 (Biolin Scientific/Q-Sense, Västra Frölunda, SWEDEN) spin-coated (4500 rpm, 30 s) with polymer thin films from 2 wt% PS-b-PMMA and PS-b-PMMA-A3 toluene solutions (dthickness (PS-b-MMA-A3) ≈ 150 nm, dthickness (PS-b-MMA) ≈ 150 nm). AuNP water suspension (∼30 nM, pH = 5.5) was used as the incubation solution. Q-Sense software was utilized for data analysis.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
AFM images were recorded with Dimension V (Veeco Instrument Inc., Santa Barbara, CA). TM 200 Tapping Mode Probes (tip radius < 15 nm, f: 145–230 kHz, k: 25–95 N m−1, SensaProbes, Santa Clara CA) were used under tapping mode. AFM image was analyzed using Veeco's NanoScope® software.
Grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS)
Grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements were performed at the D1 beamline of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and at the X9 beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. At CHESS D1, 9.8 keV X-ray photons with a 1.5% bandwidth from a multilayer monochromator impinged on thin film samples coated on silicon wafers at an angle of 0.12°, at the first waveguide resonance of the film. GISAXS images were collected with a CCD camera (MedOptics) at 1493 mm from the sample. The CCD was protected from the intense scattering in the incident plane with a rod-like beamstop. Sample alignment and measurement of the reflectivity curve close to the film critical angle was performed with an ion chamber. Data conversion to q-space was accomplished using silver behenate powder as a standard. The intensity of the samples (I) were plotted with respect to q, where q = (4π/λ)sin(θ/2), λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray beam and θ is the scattering angle. Spacing between adjacent domains was calculated through d = 2π/q.
Results and discussions
PS-b-PMMA has been a model block copolymer (BCP) system that has been self-assembled into periodical structures including cylinders, lamellae, gyroid, etc. using a variety of substrates and processing conditions.54–56 AYSSGAPPMPPF (A3), first identified by Naik et al. using phage display techniques, has been shown to bind specifically to Au and Ag. For AuNPs, A3 had a calculated adsorption strength of −63 kcal mol−1 for {111} surface and −9 kcal mol−1 for {100} surface.57,58 A3 has also been used to synthesize AuNPs in aqueous solution and bind selectively to {111} and {100} surfaces.57,59–62 Covalently tethering A3 peptide to the PMMA chain end enables an embedded preferential wetting ability of AuNPs into PMMA domains of the polymer thin film. Through carefully controlling the thermally directed self-assembly process, pre-synthesized PS-b-PMMA-A3 can self-assemble into thin films with either perpendicular or parallel PMMA cylinders to guide the patterned binding kinetics of AuNP from aqueous solution on the BCP-A3 surface. Scheme 1 briefly illustrates the strategy for generating highly-ordered 2-D hierarchical Au nanostructure using A3 end-functionalized PS-b-PMMA thin films.
 Scheme 1  The scalable strategy for the fabrication of hexagonal close packed AuNP arrays and Au nanowires. PS-b-PMMA-A3 peptide was synthesized to take advantage of the binding affinity of A3 peptide to AuNPs and the well-defined microphase separation properties of the BCP. It was fabricated into thin film templates possessing highly-ordered hexagonal or parallel cylindrical surface patterns. The BCP templates were used to direct AuNP self-assembly on A3-functionalized PMMA domains to form 2-D hexagonally close packed AuNP clusters and parallel Au nanowires. Our surface directed approach is highly versatile and with further refinement, can be adapted to large area arrays and 3 dimensional (3-D) systems. 
PS-b-PMMA-A3 (Mn = 59.5 kDa, ΦPS = 70.7%, ΦPMMA = 29.3%) was synthesized through sequential atom-transfer radical-polymerization (ATRP)63 from PS to PMMA. A number of methods have been utilized to end-label polymers with peptides.64–69 The high fidelity of the chain end post polymerization using ATRP methods lends itself toward click chemistry approaches.70,71 Following purification, the Br termini on the PMMA chain end was converted sequentially to an azide using previously defined conditions and conjugated to an alkyne containing A3 peptide (ESI†). Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was used to assess the availability of the A3 peptide on the surface of the BCP thin film and the non-specific adsorption of the AuNPs to non-A3 functionalized control BCP surface. The QCM indicated that the AuNP absorbed with significant specificity to the PS-b-PMMA-A3 relative to PS-b-PMMA, and that the AuNPs were bound to an extent that they remained immobilized upon rinsing. Frequency changes were measured by flowing a AuNP solution (30 nM, pH 5.5) through sensor chips coated with PS-b-PMMA-A3 and PS-b-PMMA, respectively (Fig. 1a).
 Fig. 1  (a) The distinct sharp and irreversible frequency shift in frequency obtained using QCM measurements of PS-b-PMMA (black) and PS-b-PMMA-A3 (red) in AuNP solution (30 nmol L−1, pH 5.5); indicate that the A3 peptide is available on the surface of the template and able to bind AuNPs. (b) AFM phase image of pre-annealed PS-b-PMMA thin film after incubation with an aqueous AuNP solution (30 nmol L−1, pH 5.5, 6 h). Few AuNPs were immobilized on the unfunctionalized film. (c) AFM image of pre-annealed PS-b-PMMA-A3 thin film following incubation with an aqueous AuNP solution (30 nmol L−1, pH 5.5, 6 h). The thin film was covered with AuNP clusters. 
When the AuNP solution was introduced to the PS-b-PMMA thin film, the QCM frequency dropped slightly indicating non-specific adsorption, remained constant during incubation and recovered to the original values as the AuNP solution was washed out. The subtle frequency drop can be attributed to a solution density difference between water and the AuNP suspension. The recovery of the oscillation frequency shows that very little AuNP bind non-specifically to the thin film without A3 peptide. However, a sharper, irreversible frequency drop was observed for the thin film end-functionalized with A3 peptide, indicating both the availability and selective immobilization of AuNPs to the PMMA domains, as specified by the AFM measurements. To confirm the wetting differences of AuNPs between thin film with and without the attached A3 peptide, control experiments incubating both pre-thermal annealed (180 °C, 48 h) PS-PMMA-A3 and PS-b-PMMA thin films were performed in concentrated AuNP solutions (30 nM, 6 h). Few nanoparticles were observed on the neat PS-b-PMMA thin film as shown in the AFM phase image in Fig. 1b. In contrast, AuNP clusters covered the majority of the PS-PMMA-A3 thin film surfaces following incubation (Fig. 1c). The control experiments provide direct evidence that AuNPs have a selective and strong affinity to the A3 functionalized BCP compared to the peptide-free BCP.
Creating well-defined AuNP hierarchical structures involves two essential steps. The first step requires the generation of a highly-ordered BCP template with perpendicular or parallel oriented PMMA cylindrical domains with surface-exposed A3. The second step is the selective adsorption of AuNP onto the A3 functionalized PMMA domains. We anticipate that the irreversible gold adsorption to the A3 peptide is akin to a nucleation and growth process (sigmoidal in time). The initial few gold molecules heterogeneously adsorb at the different A3 peptide locations with different incubation time periods to form “gold nanoparticle nuclei” that have likely a linear growth phase but slow down drastically at later times. Different incubation times for the gold nuclei would explain the heterogeneity in distribution of gold nanoparticle sizes observed. A significant slowing down and saturation of the late stage, larger gold nanoparticle development, is expected to occur in a nucleation and growth mechanism process.
For perpendicular orientation, thin films of PS-PMMA-A3 were coated on quartz substrates and subsequently dynamically cold zone annealed using a sharp temperature gradient, termed as CZA-S.72 CZA-S annealing of PS-PMMA films at temperature much below the BCP order–disorder transition temperature was previously shown to rapidly orient cylinders perpendicular to the substrate.53,72–74 CZA-S annealing of PS-PMMA-A3 thin films led to similar results i.e. vertically oriented PMMA cylinders with surface-exposed A3 linkages as seen in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  AFM images of PS-b-PMMA-A3 peptide thin film after (a) static thermal annealing (180 °C, 48 h); and (b) CZA-S (Tmax = 210 °C, temperature gradient ‘∇T’ ∼ 45 °C mm−1, velocity ‘v’ = 5 μm s−1). Highly-oriented perpendicular PMMA cylinders were obtained with CZA-S; (c) a schematic illustration of the CZA-S set up which constitutes of a sharp thermal gradient created by a hot block and two cold blocks. Orientation of PMMA cylinders can be manipulated through pushing the sample through the thermal gradient with controlled velocity. 
In contrast, conventional thermal annealing in a vacuum oven leads to a ‘finger print’ horizontal cylindrical morphology, also shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a and b contrasts the AFM images of PS-b-PMMA-A3 thin films upon static thermal annealing (temperature ‘T’ = 180 °C, 48 h) and dynamic CZA (Tmax = 210 °C, temperature gradient ‘∇T’ ∼ 45 °C mm−1, velocity ‘v’ = 5 μm s−1). After static thermal annealing over 2 days, the polymer chains approach their long term equilibrium morphology. Static-thermal-annealed PS-PMMA-A3 films exhibit PMMA cylindrical domains that show horizontal orientation with the observed lattice spacing of ∼48 nm. CZA-S annealed PS-PMMA-A3 films exhibit hexagonally close packed vertically orientated PMMA cylinders with a cylinder-to-cylinder spacing of ∼55 nm. Confinement and surface effects in horizontally oriented BCP films can alter domain spacing as shown previously.75Fig. 2c shows the schematic set up of CZA-S. In the second step, AuNPs, with an average diameter ∼ 12 nm, were prepared according to an established procedure without additional surface modification.76 Three competing phenomena direct the binding kinetics and self-assembly of AuNP on the BCP-A3 thin film surface: (1) A3 peptide availability at the free surface of the vertically oriented PMMA-A3 section is given by a probability distribution, depending on chain end conformation ending at the free surface as well as the surface wetting properties of the A3 peptide; (2) selective immobilization of AuNPs to the PMMA-A3 exposed domain of the thin film, controlled by the large binding energy of Au to the A3 phage peptide, i.e. −63 kcal mol−1 for {111} surface and −9 kcal mol−1 for {100} surface, and (3) AuNP aggregation which can simultaneously affect resolution of the final hierarchical structure. In order to reduce nanoparticle aggregation, the A3 derivatized thin film template was immersed in a dilute AuNP solution (∼3 nM) under vigorous stirring.
AFM images depicting the formation of AuNP hierarchical patterns on the templates were recorded for different incubation periods (Fig. 3). Fig. 3a shows the template prior to AuNP deposition. After 8 h incubation, a small population of AuNPs was sporadically dispersed on the thin film surface (Fig. 3b), which steadily increased with prolonged incubation time (Fig. 3c). The physico-chemically attached AuNP to the peptide patterned surface presented a hierarchical hexagonal Au pattern after 24 h (Fig. 3d).
 Fig. 3  (a–e) A series of AFM images show the time-dependent self-assembly of AuNPs on the perpendicularly-oriented PMMA cylinder template. The template was incubated with dilute AuNP water solution (3 nmol L−1, pH 5.5) for different periods of time: (a) 0 h; (b) 8 h; (c) 16 h, (d) 24 h and (e) 32 h. Coverage of AuNPs on template increased with incubation time. Hexagonally close packed (hcp) AuNP pattern was observed after 24 h incubation, while hcp of the block copolymer is observable in regions between AuNP under readjusted contrast in (b)–(d). (f) Kinetics of total gold nanoparticle adsorption in (a)–(c), fit with a sigmoidal curve. 
While free AuNPs were deposited on the PMMA domain of the thin film, the interaction of these nanoparticles immobilized on the film surface by non-specific interactions is much weaker. As the incubation time was increased to 36 h, the AuNP aggregation spread all over the template, as shown in Fig. 3e. Incubating under identical conditions as shown in Fig. 3d.

Fig. 4a shows a high resolution AFM image displaying the in situ self-assembly of hexagonally patterned AuNP hierarchical structure. The inset image is an enlarged area showing the repeating units of hexagonal configuration. The center-to-center distance of two adjacent AuNP clusters is measured to be ∼57 nm, which is consistent with that of the inter-PMMA domain spacing of the PS-b-PMMA-A3 template underneath. The observation suggests that hexagonally ordered A3 peptide domains on the thin film are able to regulate AuNP arrangement on the surface. However, temporal heterogeneity in binding and aggregation kinetics of AuNPs can result in different AuNP cluster domain sizes and deviation of particle location, thereby leading to inhomogeneous distributions of AuNP. Grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) was performed to dimensionally probe the AuNP superstructure in conjunction with the block copolymer morphology. The GISAXS measurements of these films are shown in Fig. 4b and c. The X-ray incident angle was chosen to be at the first waveguide resonance, which is just above the critical angle of the BCP film. This ensured that the X-rays homogeneously illuminated the entire film. Fig. 4b shows the typical GISAXS scattering pattern that is seen for these films after AuNP deposition. The inset in Fig. 4b shows the GISAXS scattering pattern of the BCP film prior to gold deposition. It shows the presence of vertical streaks which are characteristic of vertically oriented PMMA cylinders. This is in accordance to previous results on CZA-S annealing of BCP thin films.72 The first order scattering peak position in Fig. 4b coincides with the domain spacing of the BCP lattice, which is the primary lattice. The higher order scattering, as seen in Fig. 4b, is characteristic of the AuNP lattice. Fig. 4c shows the integrated intensity of Fig. 4b. The AuNP scattering peak positions are indicated in the figure. The first order peak position of the nanoparticle lattice has the value q ≈ 0.523 nm−1 that corresponds to a lattice spacing of ≈12 nm. The AuNPs are roughly 12 nm in size as noted earlier. Therefore, the lattice spacing is equal to the AuNP size, and it is only possible when the AuNPs are touching each other. Additionally, the second order scattering peak for Au lattice has the value q ≈ 0.91 nm−1. The relative peak positions for Au lattice is 1:√3, which indicates the AuNPs are arranged in hexagonally close packed lattice with a domain spacing of 12 nm. These quantitative observations confirm the presence of AuNP superlattice, the primary lattice being the BCP lattice with a lattice spacing of 48 nm and the secondary lattice being the AuNP lattice with a lattice spacing of 12 nm. The observation of Au lattice formation provides evidence as to the interaction of immobilized AuNPs on the PS-PMMA-A3 surface to the free AuNPs suspended in solution. Given a dilute solution and adequate incubation time, AuNPs can self-anneal themselves to attain “lower energy” or specific binding positions on the BCP surface, such as with the A3 peptide. Given the density of the A3 peptide on the top surface is not 100% due to chain end conformations ending up in film interior as well, the high density of hexagonally closed packing of AuNPs observed is in fact remarkably high. Plasmon absorption of AuNPs immobilized on thin film was compared with those dispersed in solution through UV-Visible spectroscopy measurement. The well dispersed AuNPs water solution exhibiting a deep-red color presented in a sharp absorption peak at 525 nm (Fig. 4d), which red-shifted to 555 nm together with a peak width broadening after AuNPs were immobilized onto the thin film (Fig. 4e). The above signal change is attributed to formation of AuNP lattices within each domain, which leads to closer spacing between individual nanoparticles.

Red-shift and spectral broadening of absorption peak is due to the formation of nanoparticle clusters. 
One of the key advantages of using a polymer thin film as a template lies in its morphological tunability to guide different AuNP patterns. To illustrate the idea, we have modified the thin film processing to generate parallel PMMA cylinders to assemble 2-D Au nanowires. Thin films with highly oriented parallel cylinders along the substrate were obtained through soft-shear CZA annealing (termed ‘CZA-SS’ annealing) of the BCP thin film, well demonstrated previously on a lower molecular weight cylinder forming PS (33k)-PMMA (12k) block copolymer that we utilize here.74 Like CZA-S annealing, CZA-SS annealing is a continuous process that is compatible with roll-to-roll processing. CZA-SS is an extremely rapid process where pristine unidirectional BCP line patterns can be fabricated at the rate of 12 mm min−1. In order to demonstrate that this novel nanomanufacturing procedure is robust for reduced lattice spacing's and with heterogeneous BCP systems, we prepared a 1:1 (wt/wt) blends of PS-b-PMMA-A3 with pure PS-b-PMMA with a number-average molecular mass of 35 kDa. With the addition of smaller molecular mass PS-b-PMMA, the observed BCP lattice spacing decreased to 37 nm, compared with 48 nm in PS-b-PMMA-A3 thin film without blending (Fig. 5a). Blending of non-A3 functionalized polymer also resulted in a reduction of peptide chain concentration in each PMMA domain, which weakened the preferential wetting ability of thin film to bind AuNPs. In order to compensate for this decrease in peptide concentration, we doubled the incubation time to study AuNP self-assembly. In Fig. 5b, a small amount of AuNP have been immobilized and notably aligned on the thin film template. This is consistent with an expectation that surface wetting of PS block under typical static thermodynamic annealing does not hold under dynamic CZA-SS conditions. Rather, PMMA cylinders, with attached A3 peptide, are partially exposed at the top film surface. We also note that since PMMA swells only ∼2% under aqueous conditions, we do not believe that surface re-structuring under aqueous gold nanoparticle solution exposure plays a critical role. Immobilized AuNP population increases over time and gradually reaches a full coverage after 64 h of incubation time (Fig. 5c–e). However, the weakened affinity and selectivity of the template to AuNPs in turn facilitates the formation of nanoparticle aggregation. During incubation, these two competing issues appear to be similar in rate and binding amounts. Furthermore, the enhanced coverage of AuNPs on the template is accompanied by growing aggregation grains, which prohibits fabrication of well-defined Au nanowires with high resolution. Fig. 6a shows a 2-D Au nanowire surface pattern after 40 h incubation, where straight and parallel AuNP lines can be observed partially covering the thin film and propagating across the overall 2 μm × 2 μm scanning area. A magnified image is shown in Fig. 6b, where AuNP have been aligned anisotropically to display a linear configuration. In this area, the distance between two adjacent gold lines was measured to be ∼80 nm, nearly two times the observed BCP lattice spacing shown in Fig. 5a, with an explanation as illustrated in Fig. 6c. The observed ∼37 nm spacing comes from cylinders from two adjacent layers (blue and yellow).56 In the same layer, the shortest distance between two cylinders is ∼74 nm, two times of that from the observation. In the ideal circumstance, when cylinders in the same layer are exposed to AuNP solution, the closest Au line-to-line distance should be 74 nm instead of 37 nm, which is close to the ∼80 nm spacing observed in Fig. 6b.
 Fig. 5  A series of AFM images show the time-dependent self-assembly of AuNPs on the horizontal PMMA cylinder template. The template was incubated in a dilute aqueous AuNP solution (3 nmol L−1, pH 5.5) for different time intervals: (a) 0 h; (b) 16 h; (c) 32 h; (d) 48 h and (e) 64 h. Aligned Au nanowires on template increased with incubation time and reached a full coverage with an incubation time of 64 h. Kinetics of the AuNP adsorption process is expected to be sigmoidal in time, similar to Fig. 3 due to the similarity of the underlying process mechanism. 
 Fig. 6  Dimensional explanation of the observed Au nanowire spacing. (a) AFM height image showing the formation of parallel Au nanowires after 40 h of solution incubation; (b) an enlarged AFM image showing the linear configuration of the AuNP arrangement with the minimum line-to-line distance measuring ∼80 nm; (c) a schematic illustration of the minimum cylinder-to-cylinder distance (74 nm) on the template surface accessible to AuNPs; (d) UV-Vis absorption of Au nanowires on template with the peak absorption wavelength at 550 nm. The spectral red-shift and broadening of the plasmon peak is attributed to reduced inter particle spacing. 
Even though the parallel cylindrical thin film is able to template the line-to-line distance, density of nanoparticles within each line varies significantly, from single AuNP to clusters. This phenomenon can be attributed to unevenly dispersed peptide chains in each PMMA column and/or the interaction between immobilized AuNPs to free ones in solution. The area where more AuNP are located is more likely to form nanoparticle aggregates as incubation time goes on. Further incubation of the thin film increases coverage of AuNPs and aggregation simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 5. Although complete nanoparticle coverage has not been achieved, the above free-standing AuNP thin film is able to afford SPs with a broad absorption spectrum of which the peak is centered at ∼550 nm (Fig. 6c). Compared with that of well-dispersed AuNPs in water solution (Fig. 3d), red-shifting of the plasmon peak and broadening of the peak width is attributed to formation of reduced interparticle spacing and poly-dispersity in AuNP aggregate sizes as shown in Fig. 5b. Taking advantage of CZA-SS technique, we have successfully demonstrated robustness of the peptide–BCPs to induce AuNP self assembly and arrangement. Moreover, results on the above two AuNP superstructures (hexagonally close packed AuNP clusters and Au nanowires) supports the fact that peptide concentration plays an important role in overcoming the competing issues impacting AuNP surface immobilization. Increasing the peptide concentration further should strengthen the preferential wetting ability of the peptide labeled BCP thin films to surface pattern AuNP's. In addition optimizing the incubation process will reduce the occurrence of AuNP aggregate formation. These offer promising pathways to eliminate defects in heterogeneous hierarchical structures in the future.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a scalable, continuous approach to assemble AuNPs into well-defined 2-D arrangements over macroscopic distances. A peptide-derivatized block copolymer, PS-b-PMMA-A3, was synthesized in order to take advantage of the specific binding affinity of A3 peptide to AuNPs and the well-defined microphase separation properties of the BCP. A CZA technique was used to dynamically fabricate the hybrid BCP into vertically oriented hexagonally packed thin film structures able to selectively bind AuNP through interactions with the A3 peptide at the PMMA chain end. The kinetics of the AuNP binding process is sigmoidal, consistent with a nucleation and growth process. Using a thin film template, hierarchical 2-D hexagonal AuNP cluster structures were demonstrated by controlling AuNP incubation conditions to maximize selective immobilization of nanoparticles to the template but minimize nanoparticle aggregation. Under the same principle, 2-D Au nanowire configuration has been successfully fabricated by changing CZA processing procedures to soft-shear mode. The ability to decouple formation of the organic template from AuNP deposition overcomes stability issues arising from traditional aqueous assembly. This strategy provides new opportunities to fabricate 2-D AuNP superstructures. This method may further expand the use of bio-functionalized block copolymers in solid-state devices where the plasmonic modes could be varied with interchangeable templates and spacing.

 	Scheme 1  The scalable strategy for the fabrication of hexagonal close packed AuNP arrays and Au nanowires. PS-b-PMMA-A3 peptide was synthesized to take advantage of the binding affinity of A3 peptide to AuNPs and the well-defined microphase separation properties of the BCP. It was fabricated into thin film templates possessing highly-ordered hexagonal or parallel cylindrical surface patterns. The BCP templates were used to direct AuNP self-assembly on A3-functionalized PMMA domains to form 2-D hexagonally close packed AuNP clusters and parallel Au nanowires. Our surface directed approach is highly versatile and with further refinement, can be adapted to large area arrays and 3 dimensional (3-D) systems.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) The distinct sharp and irreversible frequency shift in frequency obtained using QCM measurements of PS-b-PMMA (black) and PS-b-PMMA-A3 (red) in AuNP solution (30 nmol L−1, pH 5.5); indicate that the A3 peptide is available on the surface of the template and able to bind AuNPs. (b) AFM phase image of pre-annealed PS-b-PMMA thin film after incubation with an aqueous AuNP solution (30 nmol L−1, pH 5.5, 6 h). Few AuNPs were immobilized on the unfunctionalized film. (c) AFM image of pre-annealed PS-b-PMMA-A3 thin film following incubation with an aqueous AuNP solution (30 nmol L−1, pH 5.5, 6 h). The thin film was covered with AuNP clusters.	 

 	Fig. 2  AFM images of PS-b-PMMA-A3 peptide thin film after (a) static thermal annealing (180 °C, 48 h); and (b) CZA-S (Tmax = 210 °C, temperature gradient ‘∇T’ ∼ 45 °C mm−1, velocity ‘v’ = 5 μm s−1). Highly-oriented perpendicular PMMA cylinders were obtained with CZA-S; (c) a schematic illustration of the CZA-S set up which constitutes of a sharp thermal gradient created by a hot block and two cold blocks. Orientation of PMMA cylinders can be manipulated through pushing the sample through the thermal gradient with controlled velocity.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a–e) A series of AFM images show the time-dependent self-assembly of AuNPs on the perpendicularly-oriented PMMA cylinder template. The template was incubated with dilute AuNP water solution (3 nmol L−1, pH 5.5) for different periods of time: (a) 0 h; (b) 8 h; (c) 16 h, (d) 24 h and (e) 32 h. Coverage of AuNPs on template increased with incubation time. Hexagonally close packed (hcp) AuNP pattern was observed after 24 h incubation, while hcp of the block copolymer is observable in regions between AuNP under readjusted contrast in (b)–(d). (f) Kinetics of total gold nanoparticle adsorption in (a)–(c), fit with a sigmoidal curve.

Red-shift and spectral broadening of absorption peak is due to the formation of nanoparticle clusters.	 

 	Fig. 5  A series of AFM images show the time-dependent self-assembly of AuNPs on the horizontal PMMA cylinder template. The template was incubated in a dilute aqueous AuNP solution (3 nmol L−1, pH 5.5) for different time intervals: (a) 0 h; (b) 16 h; (c) 32 h; (d) 48 h and (e) 64 h. Aligned Au nanowires on template increased with incubation time and reached a full coverage with an incubation time of 64 h. Kinetics of the AuNP adsorption process is expected to be sigmoidal in time, similar to Fig. 3 due to the similarity of the underlying process mechanism.	 

 	Fig. 6  Dimensional explanation of the observed Au nanowire spacing. (a) AFM height image showing the formation of parallel Au nanowires after 40 h of solution incubation; (b) an enlarged AFM image showing the linear configuration of the AuNP arrangement with the minimum line-to-line distance measuring ∼80 nm; (c) a schematic illustration of the minimum cylinder-to-cylinder distance (74 nm) on the template surface accessible to AuNPs; (d) UV-Vis absorption of Au nanowires on template with the peak absorption wavelength at 550 nm. The spectral red-shift and broadening of the plasmon peak is attributed to reduced inter particle spacing.
