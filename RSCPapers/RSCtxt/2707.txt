    , Accepted 6th October 2014First published on 6th October 2014AbstractThis work introduces cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) as a spacer between the porphyrin chromophore and cyanoacetic acid to obtain a porphyrin dye (coded as LW9). The resultant novel porphyrin dye exhibits extended absorption spectra and a split B band at 520 nm. Therefore, a full spectrum light harvesting characterization of sensitized TiO2 mesoporous film can be achieved. To conduct a thorough investigation of the influence of the spacer unit, new sensitizers conjugated with biphenyl (LW7) and bithiophene (LW8) have been synthesized. As the electron-donating ability of the spacer varies from biphenyl to bithiophene and cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene, stepwise red-shifted electronic absorption spectra and the consistently decreasing energy gap of the dye are presented. These novel porphyrins have been evaluated in dye-sensitized solar cells, achieving a power efficiency of 6.5% employing a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple for the LW9 device under reporting conditions. Detailed investigation, including time-resolved photoluminescence, transient photovoltage decay, and scanning electrochemical spectroscopy measurements, provides important information on the factors affecting the principal photovoltaic parameters. The present report highlights the potential of D–π–D–A porphyrin for the development of efficient sensitizers with broad light absorption properties.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted growing interest due to their high indoor power conversion efficiency and low cost compared to inorganic solar cells.1 In the last 20 years, DSSCs using ruthenium(II)-based sensitizers have reached an overall solar-to-electric power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.4% under full sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2).2 Ruthenium is a noble and expensive metal. Therefore, the research activity has increased in exploring ruthenium-free sensitizers.3 Porphyrin has been considered as one of the most promising candidates because of the up to near-infrared region electronic absorption spectra, long-lived π* singlet excited states for hot electron injection and tunable electrochemical and photophysical properties.4 In this case, a new benchmark in DSSCs with an overall PCE of 13.0% was achieved by a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) porphyrin (SM315) with a cobalt redox couple.5
In 2011, Lin and Diau et al. reported a series of highly efficient porphyrin dyes, utilizing dialkylamine as a donor in conjunction with ethynylbenzoic acid as an acceptor. These dyes showed superior photovoltaic performance over 10%.4a,b,6 As we know, elongation of π conjugation and loss of symmetry in porphyrins cause broadening and a red shift of the absorption bands.7,8 In this case, oligomer thiophenes,9 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl,10N-annulated perylene,7,11 anthracene,12 and other functional groups,13 were successfully utilized to construct the porphyrin dyes. DSSC devices based on these sensitizers showed PCEs in the range of 4–10.5%.9–13 However, it is worth noting that few porphyrins simultaneous present strong light harvesting ability across from the visible to the near-IR region.6c,14 Recently, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) was introduced as a linker between benzoic acid and porphyrin chromophore, affording porphyrins with a filled valley between the B and Q bands.5b,6a The device efficiency of GY50 and SM315 porphyrins was obviously increased due to the introduction of an electron-deficient group.6a
Inspired by Lin and Diau's pioneering work, electron-rich hetero-aromatics such as thiophene and 2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine (EDOT) were introduced as a π spacer between the porphyrin macrocycle and the cyanoacetic acid anchoring group by our group, aiming to extend the light harvesting area into the near-IR region.15 As expected, these dyes with a thiophene or EDOT as a spacer showed extended incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) up to 850 nm, demonstrating that electron-rich spacers were beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer in D–π–A porphyrins.15 Along this track, cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) was introduced as a spacer between cyanoacetic acid and porphyrin chromophore (LW9 dye) in this article. CPDT possesses strong electron-donating ability compared with thiophene or EDOT, as well as the steric effect of alkyl groups placed in the 4,4-position.16 It was observed that the absorption valley between the B and Q-band was filled by a B band split at 520 nm, and the absorption bands were obviously broadened and red-shifted. As a result, LW9 dye exhibits strong light-harvesting character across from the visible to near-IR region. To fully investigate the influence of the spacer on spectroscopic and photoelectric properties of this dye, biphenyl and bithiophene conjugated porphyrins (coded as LW7 and LW8) were also synthesized. As the electron-donating ability of the spacer varied from biphenyl to bithiophene and CPDT, stepwise red-shifted absorption spectra and consistently decreasing energy gap can be observed. We evaluated these dyes in DSSCs. To avoid the loss of photovoltage using iodide/triiodide electrolyte, in this study, a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple (molecular structure see Scheme 1) was employed to improve the photovoltage as well as the efficiency of the DSSC devices. A PCE of 6.5% was achieved with the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox couple for the LW9 device under reporting conditions. While for LW7 and LW8, it was 6.02% and 6.32%, respectively. Detailed investigation, including time-resolved photoluminescence, transient photovoltage decay, and scanning electrochemical spectroscopy measurements, provides important information on the spacer factors affecting the principal photovoltaic parameters.

Experimental section
Materials and synthesis
The structures and purity of all intermediates and final compounds (LW7, LW8, and LW9) were identified by NMR and mass spectrometry (see Fig. S1–S7, ESI†). For comparison, the LD14 sensitizer was also synthesized according to the literature.4a
Computational
The frontier molecular orbitals for LW7–LW9 dyes were calculated via the density functional theory (DFT) method in DCM at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level using the Gaussian 03 package. Four step computational protocol strategies were used to determine the charge transfer features of rod-like porphyrin dyes efficiently. It aims to evaluate the distance separating the barycentre of the electron density gain/depletion upon electron transition. Through the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM), all calculations in our case systematically considered the bulk solvent effects. Four dodecyloxy chains have been replaced by methyl groups in order to lighten the computational burden.
Device fabrication
FTO glass plates (3 mm thickness, 7 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass) were cleaned in detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 15 min and then rinsed with de-ionized water and ethanol for 15 min. A 7.5 μm thick transparent layer of 20 nm TiO2 particles was first printed on a FTO glass and then coated with a 5 μm thick second layer of 400 nm light scattering anatase particles (WER2-O, Dyesol). The film thickness was measured by DEKTAK (VECCO, Bruker). After treatment with 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min, the TiO2 film was first sintered at 500 °C for 30 min and then cooled to about 80 °C in air. The details for the preparation of the 20 nm TiO2 particles and TiO2 films have been described elsewhere.2a Then the TiO2 film electrodes were dipped into a 200 μM dye solution in a mixture of toluene and ethanol (volume ratio, 1:1) at room temperature for 5 h. After being washed with ethanol and dried by air flow, the sensitized titania electrodes were assembled with thermally platinized conductive glass electrodes. The working and counter electrodes were separated by a 25 μm thick hot melt ring (Surlyn, DuPont) and sealed by heating. The internal space was filled with liquid electrolytes using a vacuum back filling system. The cobalt based electrolyte (coded W30) for devices was 0.165 M Co(bpy)3(PF6)2, 0.045 M Co(bpy)3(PF6)3, 0.8 M 4-tert-butylpiridine and 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile. The devices were optimized with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as the coadsorbent with the optimized dye/CDCA ratio of 1:10.
Photovoltaic characterization
A 450 W xenon light source solar simulator (Oriel, model 9119) with AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to give various irradiance at the surface of the solar cell. The current–voltage characteristics of the cell under these conditions were obtained by applying external potential bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA). IPCE spectra were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source meter (Keithley) as a function of wavelength under a constant white light bias of approximately 1 mW cm−2 supplied by a white LED array (IQE-LIGHT-BIAS, Newport). A 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel Co.) was used as the excitation beam source in combination with a Corstoner 260 monochromator (Newport) and chopped at 10 Hz. The devices with the photoanode area of 0.16 cm2 were tested with a metal mask of 0.09 cm2. The photovoltaic parameters were obtained by measuring a number of independently samples individuals.
Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) characterization
SECM experiments were performed on a CHI 920C electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Shanghai). A homemade Teflon cell (with volume of 2 mL) was used to hold a Pt wire counter electrode, an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The photoanode FTO/TiO2/porphyrin sample films were attached to the cell bottom and sealed with an O-ring as a working electrode. In SECM measurements, the dye-sensitized transparent semiconductor nanocrystal films (TiO2 with a thickness of about 2.3 μm) were used as the working electrode. An extra Pt wire was connected to the FTO substrate with the electrolyte in order to operate the photoelectrochemical cell in a short-circuit setup. A 25 μm diameter Pt wire (Goodfellow, Cambridge, UK) was sealed into a 5 cm glass capillary prepared by a Vertical pull pin instrument (PC-10, Japan). The ultra-microelectrode (UME) was polished by a grinding instrument (EG-400, Japan) and micro-polishing cloth with 1.0, 0.3 and 0.05 μm alumina powder. Then the UME was sharpened conically to a RG of 10, where RG is the ratio between the diameters of the glass sheath and the Pt disk. All experiments were carried out at room temperature. The irradiation was focused onto the backside of the photoanode from a light emitting diode (red, Lumileds Lighting, USA).
Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) experiment
TPRL measurements were recorded using Edinburgh instruments (FLSP920 spectrometers). The excitation light source was a picosecond pulsed light-emitting diodes centered at 445 nm (10 ps pulses), operated at a frequency of 10 MHz. The TiO2 nanoparticles were screen-printed on quartz substrates. The substrates coated with nanoparticles were immersed in 200 μM dye solution, followed by rinsing and drying to remove the excess dye. Data fitting procedures were according to the literature,24 Data collected for solution and TiO2 samples were fitted by the convolution of the Gaussian instrument response function with a single stretched exponential: in t = A0e−(τ/t)β, where β is the stretch parameter. We set the β as 1 to obtain the excited singlet state fluorescence lifetime of the samples.
Transient photovoltage decay (TPD) measurement
The determination of the interfacial charge recombination lifetime was performed by transient photovoltage decay measurements and charge extraction experiments. For the transient decay measurements, a white-light bias was generated from an array of diodes. Blue-light-pulse diodes (0.05 s square pulse-width, 100 ns rise and fall time) that were controlled by a fast solid-state switch were used as the perturbation source. The voltage dynamics were recorded on a PC-interfaced Keithley 2602A source meter with a 500 ms response time. The perturbation light source was set to a suitably low level for the voltage-decay kinetics to be mono-exponential. By varying the intensity of white-light bias, the recombination lifetime could be estimated over a range of open-circuit voltages. The chemical capacitance of the TiO2/electrolyte interface and the density of state (DOS) at VOC were calculated according to Cμ = ΔQ/ΔV, where ΔV is the peak of the photovoltage transient and ΔQ is the number of electrons injected during the red-light flash. The latter parameter was obtained by integrating a short circuit transient photocurrent that was generated from an identical red-light pulse. Before the LEDs switched to the next light intensity, a charge-extraction routine was executed to measure the electron density in the film. In the charge-extraction techniques, the LED illumination source was turned off within <1 μs, whilst the cell was simultaneously switched from an open circuit to short circuit. The resulting current, as the cell returned to V = 0 and J = 0, was integrated to give a direct measurement of the excess charge in the film at that VOC value.
Results and discussion
Synthetic procedures
The molecular structures of LW7, LW8, and LW9 sensitizers are presented in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic procedure and compound characterization are described in the ESI.† Briefly, standard Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction reported by Lindsey and co-workers was used to prepare LW7, LW8, and LW9 sensitizers (see Scheme S1, ESI†).17 The synthesis started with the key precursor 5-bromo-15-(4-N,N-dimethylamino-phenyl)ethynyl-10,20-bis[2,6-di(dodecyloxy)phenyl]porphinato zinc(II) (coded as Por-1) according to the literature.18 Firstly, the π-spacer aldehydes ethyl-4′-bromo-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4-carbaldehyde (compound 1), 5′-bromo-(2,2′-bithiophene)-5-carbaldehyde (compound 2), and 6-bromo-4,4-didodecyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′] dithio-phene-2-carbaldehyde (compound 3) were coupled with trimethylsilylacetylene via Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira-coupling to obtain intermediates 4′-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4-carbaldehyde (compound 4), 5′-[(trimethylsilyl) ethynyl]-(2,2′-bithiophene)-5-carbaldehyde (compound 5), and 4,4-didodecyl-6-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene-2-carbaldehyde (compound 6). Then, 4′-ethynyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4-carbaldehyde (compound 7), 5′-ethynyl-(2,2′-bithiophene)-5-carbaldehyde (compound 8), and 4,4-didodecyl-6-ethynyl-4H-cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene-2-carbaldehyde (compound 9) were achieved by de-protection of trimethylsilyl with potassium carbonate. Compound Por-1 was coupled with the intermediate π-spacer aldehydes (compounds 7, 8, and 9) through Sonogashira coupling reaction, affording the porphyrin aldehyde precursors (compounds 10, 11, and 12), whose molecular structures are illustrated in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The target porphyrins LW7, LW8, and LW9 were achieved by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid and piperidine. The structure and purity of all reactive intermediates and final compounds were identified by NMR and mass spectroscopy (see Fig. S1–S7, ESI†).
Photophysical properties

Fig. 1 presents the absorption spectra of LW7, LW8, LW9, and LD14 sensitizers in THF solution and the corresponding data are tabulated in Table 1. In solution, LW7, LW8, and LW9 sensitizers exhibited progressive red-shifted and broadened absorption spectra. The absorption peaks in the visible region were found at 461, 467, and 471 nm for the B band, 670, 684 and 697 nm for the Q band, stemming from S0 → S2 transition and S0 → S1 transition, respectively.19 Comparison with the LD14 dye (with D–π–A structure), LW8 (with D–π–π–A structure) and LW9 dye (with D–π–D–A structure) show a higher molar extinction coefficient (about 8 × 104 M−1 cm−1) in the range of 650–750 nm. Thus, a strong near-IR light-harvesting ability is expected of the porphyrin sensitized TiO2 film, which could lead to an improvement of JSC upon sensitization.20 The LW8 absorption spectra was entirely red-shifted compared to the LW7 dye (with biphenyl), indicating that bithiophene is more beneficial for extending the absorption spectra than biphenyl in this system. The bathochromic shift observed in the LW8 dye compared to LW7 may be due to the more efficient intramolecular charge transfer transition. This may be caused by the change in the electron-donating ability of the bithiophene spacer moiety. The phenomenon is even clearer when bithiophene in the LW8 is switched to CPDT in the LW9 dye, presenting extended absorption spectra and a obvious shoulder at 520 nm. This is helpful for filling the light-harvesting valley in the range of 500–600 nm compared with conventional porphyrin sensitizers. Fig. S8 (ESI†) presents absorption spectroscopy of LW9-stained 2.3 μm TiO2 film, showing an obvious shoulder at 520 nm and significant broadened absorption spectra. The peak of the LW9's Q band was red-shifted 14 nm relative to LW8, suggesting an efficient intra-molecular charge transfer behaviour. Elongation of π conjugation and loss of symmetry in porphyrins are two of the main strategies for broadening the light-harvesting area of porphyrin dyes.8c The linked two thiophene unit in LW8 dye are free to rotate. Therefore the conjugation would be broken if the two thiophene are not co-planar. While for LW9 dye, the conjugation across the CPDT group with rigid structure is more efficient. Thus, it was suggest that the difference of the absorption spectra should be attributed to the elongated conjugation in the LW9 dye. The stepwise red-shifted absorption spectra of LW7, LW8, and LW9 are consistent with the trend of their fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. S9, ESI†). The maximum fluorescent emission bands of LW7, LW8, and LW9 porphyrins were found at 686, 702, and 725 nm, showing mirror images of their Q bands. The same trend suggests that the variety spacer units similarly affects push–pull porphyrin in photon absorption and emission.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical behaviour of new sensitizers was explored with cyclic voltammetry. The results are presented in Fig. S11 and Table S1 (ESI†). The first oxidation potential (Eox) of LW7, LW8, and LW9 dyes is estimated to be 0.70, 0.72, and 0.73 V, respectively, which are higher than that of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple (≈0.57 V vs. NHE).21 According to the literature,5g the first oxidations are assigned to the porphyrin ring oxidation and the second assigned to the dimethylaminophenyl group, respectively. Thus, the very similar oxidation and reduction behaviours could be explained by the identical structure of the donor and porphyrin group in this case. The very small variation in the oxidation potentials may be due to the different spacer groups. The HOMO–LUMO gaps were determined to be 1.83, 1.79, and 1.75 eV for LW7, LW8, and LW9 sensitizers by intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectrum. Thus, the dye excited state (dye+/dye*) were calculated to be −1.13, −1.07 and −1.01 V (vs. NHE), respectively. Fig. S11 (ESI†) presents the energetic alignment of S0 and S* energy levels of the three porphyrins with the conduction band of TiO2 and the redox potential of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ electrolyte, showing that an effective electron injection is energetically possible from the excited dye to the TiO2.
Computational
Density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G level was used to gain insight into the geometry and electronic transitions in different absorption bands. Fig. 2 illustrates the isodensity surface plots of the three new porphyrins at the HOMO and HOMO − 1 as well as LUMO and LUMO + 1 energy levels. The corresponding calculated energy levels are displayed in Fig. S12 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2, new porphyrin dyes present a similar planar molecule form upon varying the spacer. The HOMOs of LW7, LW8, and LW9 porphyrin dyes are delocalized through the N,N-dimethylaminophenyl group and the porphyrin macrocycle, while the excited electrons are shifted to the spacer and the electron accepting unit (cyanoacrylic acid in LW9 for example) as observed in the LUMOs levels. This result indicates good charge separated states in these dyes upon excitation. Fig. S11 (ESI†) presents the energetic alignment of S0 and S* energy levels for LW7–LW9 dyes compared to the TiO2 conduction band (CB) and quasi-equilibrium redox potential of [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ mediator. Clearly, the excited electrons can be effectively injected into the TiO2 CB through the anchoring group.22 With increasing in the electron-donating ability of the spacer, the first vertical excitation values from the calculated absorption was evaluated to be 738 nm (1.68 eV), 775 nm (1.60 eV) and 792 nm (1.56 eV) for LW7, LW8, and LW9 sensitizers, respectively. The ground state dipole moments of LW7, LW8, and LW9 sensitizers were estimated to be 11.17, 13.25 and 15.31 D, respectively. The dipole moment was increased as the spacer changed from biphenyl, bithiophene to CPDT, similar to the trend of the absorption and fluorescence spectra.

Electron injection and oxidized dye regeneration
A favourable balance between dye electron injection and dye regeneration is essential for highly efficient DSSCs.23 In this context, TRPL and SECM were employed to characterize the electron-injection and oxidized dye regeneration processes.24Fig. 3 presents the fluorescence decays of LW7, LW8, and LW9 dyes in THF solution and the dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 films filtered with cobalt complex-based electrolyte. By considering the re-convolution of instrument response function, the fluorescence lifetimes for LW7, LW8, and LW9 dyes in THF were evaluated to be 1.185, 1.073 and 1.224 ns, respectively. When adsorbed onto the TiO2 nanoparticle surface, strong quenching of the emission for those sensitizers was observed as depicted in Fig. 3. The lifetime of the excited singlet state of LW7, LW8 and LW9 in the adsorbed state was estimated to be 125.6, 71.2 and 70.0 ps. LW8 (bithiophene) and LW9 (CPDT) present absolute stronger quenching than LW7 (biphenyl), which may be explained by the twisted molecular structure of the former with thiophene derivatives as the spacer (see Fig. 2). The strong quenching of the photoluminescence of LW7, LW8, and LW9 suggested that the electron transfer from the excited dyes to semiconductors is absolutely fast and efficient.25

SECM measurements were carried out to elucidate the kinetics of interception of the different dye anions by redox couples.26Fig. 4a presents the normalized feedback curves for a Pt ultra-microelectrode approaching towards a FTO/TiO2/LW9 film in electrolytes containing [Co(bpy)3]3+ under illumination with a red light LED (intensity 14.7 × 10−9 mol cm−2 s−1). As shown in Fig. 4a, the interfacial charge transfer dominated the current curves when the tip approached the sample surface. The normalized apparent heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant κ can be obtained by fitting the approach curves.27 Based on the constant κ, the effective heterogeneous rate constant (keff, in cm s−1) can be evaluated using keff = κD/rT, where D is the diffusion coefficient for the redox couple in the electrolyte. Fig. 4b displays the calculated heterogeneous rate constants keff as a function of mediator's concentration. As shown in Fig. 4b, LW9 has a slight higher keff value than that of LD14 when the concentration of [Co(bpy)3]3+ is low, which presents similar values (about 1 × 10−3 cm s−1) to that of LD14 dye when increasing [Co(bpy)3]3+ concentration, indicating a similar apparent regeneration process for these porphyrins. Therefore, these novel porphyrins can satisfy requirements from an efficient DSSC device upon fast electron injection (as shown in Fig. 3) and the oxidized dye regeneration process (as shown in Fig. 4).

LW7, LW8, LW9 and the reference dye LD14 were evaluated in DSSCs using [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ as a redox shuttle. The photovoltaic parameters, i.e., PCE, short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) of LW7, LW8, LW9 and LD14 devices are summarized in Table 2. The photocurrent–voltage curves and incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra are displayed in Fig. 5. The device of LW9 (CPDT) exhibited a JSC of 11.47 ± 0.16 mA cm−2, a VOC of 738 ± 8 mV, a FF of 0.76 ± 0.02, giving an overall PCE of 6.50 ± 0.06%, while LW7 (biphenyl) was 9.58 ± 0.34 mA cm−2, 802 ± 4 mV, 0.78 ± 0.03, 6.02 ± 0.11% and LW8 (bithiophene) was 10.37 ± 0.24 mA cm−2, 788 ± 6 mV, 0.76 ± 0.02, 6.32 ± 0.08%. The JSC of the LW9 device was higher than LW7 and LW8 devices. Under similar conditions, the reference porphyrin LD14 gave an efficiency of 7.93%. The dramatic decrease in VOC of LW9 devices relative to the others may be on account of serious interfacial charge recombination, which will be discussed in the next part. As shown in Fig. 5b, the LW9 device possessed a broadened light-harvesting area up to 800 nm and aroused shoulder in 500–550 nm, explaining its higher JSC compared to LW7 and LW8 devices. It was also observed that the onset wavelengths of photocurrent response were stepwise extended from LW7, LW8 to LW9, which were in general agreement with the electronic absorptions of dye-sensitized 2.3 μm-thick titania films (Fig. S8, ESI†).

 Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves of and the DSSC devices based on LW7, LW8 and LW9 porphyrins measured under simulated AM 1.5G full sunlight, and (b) IPCE spectra of LW7, LW8 and LW9 devices. The cells were measured with a mask (area = 0.09 cm−2). 
TPD and charge extraction measurements were employed to get insight into the details of electron recombination dynamics between the photoinjected electrons at the TiO2 and the oxidized electrolyte in LW7, LW8, LW9 devices.28 The variations of VOC may be ascribed to a shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge bending with respect to the electrolyte potential and/or differences in the e−-TiO2/electrolyte+ recombination reaction.29 According to the literature,5 chemical capacitance (Cμ) provides information about the shift of conduction band edge of TiO2 and the distribution of trap states. As presented in Fig. 6a, LW7 and LW8 devices showed lower Cμ compared to LW9 at a given VOC, indicating a trend of conduction band bending of LW7 > LW8 > LW9. Comparing to the LW7 dye using bithiophene as spacer, CPDT in the LW9 dye leads to a negative shift (versus NHE) of the conduction band edge of TiO2 of about 40 mV. A similar phenomenon was found by Gao et al., showing that a negative shift of the conduction band bending of 50 mV was caused by employing a CPDT instead of the spacer in organic dyes.30 The relationship of electron lifetimes as a function of VOC was given in Fig. 6b, affording insight into the electron recombination occurring at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The LW9 device presented a shorter lifetime compared to LW7 and LW8 devices, implying a faster recombination reaction on the dye-sensitized TiO2/electrolyte interface. As we know, a faster electron recombination is always followed by a negative shift (versus NHE) of the conduction band edge of TiO2. Therefore, the observed drop in the photovoltage of LW9 compared to that of LW8 could be principally due to a negative shift of the conduction band edge of TiO2.

Conclusions
This work presents a method to broaden the light-harvesting area for a porphyrin sensitizer using a D–π–D–A approach. Porphyrin (LW9) with cyclopenta[1,2-b:5,4-b′]dithiophene as a spacer between the porphyrin chromophore and cyanoacetic acid exhibited intensively red-shifted absorption spectra, together with obvious splitting of the B band at 520 nm. Therefore, LW9 offers the light-harvesting ability through the visible spectrum to the near-IR region. To investigate the influence of the spacer, biphenyl and bithiophene conjugated porphyrins were also synthesized and investigated. These porphyrins present stepwise red-shift of absorption spectra and consistently decrease energy gap, which are quite consistent with the increase of the electron-donating ability of the spacer. A PCE of 6.0%, 6.3% and 6.5% using the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox couple was achieved for LW7, LW8, and LW9 dyes, respectively. A higher JSC of the LW9 device was ascribed to the broadened light-harvesting area. However, the fast interfacial charge recombination process and TiO2 conduction band bending caused a significant drop in VOC. The low PCE of these devices could be due to the improper molecular structure of the dye. To increase the VOC and efficiency of DSSCs, further optimization of the molecular structure based on LW9 porphyrin is on-going.
