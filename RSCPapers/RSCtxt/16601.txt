Exceptionally high open-circuit voltage, Voc, was found for the symmetrical structurally benefited dye, which also gave the best overall solar cell performance.
Introduction
The demand for alternative power sources has drawn attention to a variety of light-harvesting devices. Among these, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1 have attracted a large number of research groups in recent decades. So far, the conventional ruthenium-based sensitizers such as N3/N7192,3 and black dye4 have reached the promising solar-energy-to-electricity conversion efficiencies of 11% under AM 1.5 irradiation. In comparison, organic sensitizers have reached efficiencies of 6–9.8%.5–19 However, organic chromophores for DSCs exhibiting high molar extinction coefficients, can be prepared and easily modified and are environmentally friendly. The high extinction coefficients are needed in solid-state devices where limitation of the photovoltaic performance by low hole mobility and insufficient pore filling requires thin TiO2 films.20 Organic chromophores based on triphenylamine (TPA) donors have proved potent sensitizers in DSCs over the past few years.10,11,17–19,21,22 Many research groups focus on broadening the absorption spectra of the chromophores in order to increase their efficiency. The spectral red-shift of organic sensitizers is frequently associated with parallel limitations; firstly, expanding the absorption by increasing the conjugation can result in sensitization problems often referred to as aggregation,23–25 secondly, decreasing the HOMO–LUMO gap can result in driving force limitations for the injection and regeneration.26 One principal difference between organic and Ru-based chromophores is that the main absorption band in the organic dye arises mainly due to a single, strong HOMO → LUMO excitation, while the panchromatic absorbance of common Ru-dyes is due to numerous weakly allowed transitions. The HOMO-1 energy of organic dyes is generally too low to make any significant contribution except in the near-UV region. Moreover, it has proven difficult to absorb the near-IR photons by extending the π-conjugation of the molecule, without negatively affecting the stability and overall efficiency.23 Given these limitations, it remains a challenge for organic sensitizers to compete with the high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of e.g. N719.2
In recent years a number of chromophores with insulating alkyl groups, both on the linker and the donor, have been published.11,19 It has been shown that the efficiencies of the sensitizers are strongly dependent on the position of these insulating groups. Hara and co-workers have elegantly elucidated the influence of the position/number of alkyl chains on the open-circuit voltage, Voc, and hence the efficiency of the sensitizers.6 Moreover, it is well-established that electron-donating groups at the para-position of the TPA phenyls, e.g. amine or alkoxy groups, red-shift the absorption spectrum and increase efficiency, where the degree of red-shift is dependent on the electron-donating strength of the substituents.11,17 Tian et al. reported a series of chromophores with aryl amines at the para-position of the TPA moiety and they indeed shifted the spectra bathochromically.14 One drawback with this strategy however, is the risk of raising the HOMO potential too high, hence not matching the redox potential of the electrolyte.
We have designed and synthesized a series of chromophores based on the TPA donor group (Fig. 1). The TPA group has been substituted in the para-position with additional phenyl groups, functionalized with p-dimethylamine (D29) and/or p,o-butoxy groups (D35, D37). This series can be used to study the impact of structural versus spectral benefits on the overall solar cell efficiency. The chromophore D29, with dimethylaniline substituents can be regarded as a chromophore with spectral benefits, due to the strong electron-donating properties of the amine groups.
 Fig. 1  Structures of the chromophores. 
The chromophore D35, on the other hand, receives structural benefits from the large steric bulk introduced by the four butoxy groups, but it is not red-shifted as much as D29, due to lower electron-donating strength. The chromophore D37 is a hybrid of the two parent chromophores D29 and D35, and is included since it encompasses a combination of properties that might be optimal for solar cell performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such an unsymmetric organic chromophore has been presented, however, unsymmetric squaraine dyes have been investigated.27 Moreover, breaking the symmetry of the molecule gives rise to orbital rearrangements. As has been observed in a different class of dyes, two explicit acceptor groups give two near-degenerate LUMOs.28
Prior to the synthesis of the three novel organic chromophores (Scheme 1), their electronic and spectral properties were evaluated using hybrid-DFT computational methods. Gas-phase optimized geometries and absorption spectra were obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, employing the Gaussian03 program package.29 Time-dependent DFT was used to obtain the vertical transitions. Although it is well-known that hybrid-DFT gravely underestimates the charge-transfer excitations,30 present in all organic sensitizers, B3LYP does successfully reproduce the general characteristics of the spectra, making it the method of choice in this study. Fig. 3 displays the simulated absorption spectra together with the relative energy levels of the three dyes. The calculations indicate that the unsymmetric dye D37 has more evenly spaced occupied frontier orbitals, having contributions from both the D29 and D35 electronic structures. The main absorption band is predicted to be broadened at the blue end, because of a larger contribution from the HOMO-1 → LUMO transition, which is essentially forbidden in D29 and D35. This difference is mainly due to a better overlap between HOMO-1 and LUMO in D37 (Fig. 2). The calculations predict a systematic red-shift, when increasing the number of dimethyl amines in the functional groups.

 Fig. 2  Isodensity plots of the new organic chromophores, showing HOMO-1, HOMO and LUMO. Good charge separation is obtained by transferring an electron from an occupied orbital to the LUMO, facilitating electron injection. D37 is the only of the three dyes where the HOMO-1 orbital extends over the linker region, which explains the relatively strong second transition. Note that the butoxy groups have been truncated in the calculations, in order to save computational time. This does not significantly affect the electronic or spectral properties.

Results and discussion
The straightforward synthesis of the chromophores, illustrated in Scheme 1, is strongly based on the Suzuki coupling reaction of commercially available materials.31 Suzuki coupling was carried out with unprotected 5-formyl-2-thiophene-boronic acid and 4-(diphenylamino)-bromobenzene under microwave irradiation to directly yield the aldehyde in 1, necessary in the final reactions. Bromination of the para-positions of the triphenylamine moiety was carried out with NBS to yield 2. Additional Suzuki coupling reactions under microwave irradiation introduced the functionalized phenyl groups. The final reaction of the three dyes was the condensation of the respective aldehydes with cyanoacetic acid by the Knoevenagel reaction in presence of piperidine.

Table 1 presents the experimental spectral and electrochemical properties of the dyes in ethanol solution and adsorbed onto TiO2, respectively. The predicted red-shift in the absorption maxima, due to the increasing electron-donating strength of the moieties, was observed. As seen in Fig. 4, the difference is small, and the theoretical overestimation of absorption wavelength is evident. In the experimental spectrum for D37, a slight broadening at the blue end of the visible band is observed. We believe that this is due to the second transition discussed above. The appearance of only one band can be explained by solvation broadening and the fact that the two vertical transitions are closer in reality than in the theoretical spectrum, thus embedded in the same band. The estimated LUMO energy levels, calculated from E(HOMOox) − E0–0, seem to be sufficiently more negative than the TiO2 conduction-band edge for all three dyes, reported in Table 1.

 Fig. 4  Normalized absorption spectra of D29 (red), D35 (green), and D37 (black line) measured in ethanol. 
However, the LUMO energy level of D37 is surprisingly negative, and not at all in the same region as the two parent chromophores, D29 and D35, which was predicted. The monochromatic IPCE spectra are presented in Fig. 5, and show that the highest IPCE is obtained from the D35 solar cell. The IPCE of D37 is a combination of the two parent chromophores, but not quite as red as the D29 nor as high as the D35. A comparison of the photovoltaic performances of solar cells based on the different dyes D29, D35 and D37 under AM 1.5 illumination is presented in Table 2. The efficiencies were 4.83, 6.00 and 5.24% for D29, D35 and D37, respectively.

Spectra of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSCs based on D29, D35, and D37dyes. 
The D35dye showed remarkably high Voc, 0.75 V, which we believe is due to an insulating effect of the bulky butoxy chains.17 This is also supported by our preliminary electron-lifetime studies, which are presented in Fig. 6. Comparing the electron lifetimes as a function of Voc, DSCs based on D35 showed significantly longer electron lifetimes compared to D37 and D29. This provides support for the four insulating butoxy chains introduced in D35 preventing electrons in TiO2 from recombining with redox species yielding a high Voc. Despite the red-shift in the absorption spectrum and hence a more optimal HOMO and LUMO energy-level composition with regards to the TiO2–I−/I3− system, the D29dye showed a comparatively low performance due to the lack of insulating bulky substituents. The predicted broader spectral response of D37 was not decisive for the photovoltaic performance. We are currently working on the synthesis of spectrally and structurally benefited chromophores.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this series of chromophores showing high efficiencies in DSCs were used in a comparative study of structural versus spectral benefits. The TPA donor units were functionalized with electron-donating groups and bulky substituents, respectively. Neither the red-shift of the symmetrical dye D29 nor the expanded spectral response from the unsymmetrical dye D37 can compete with the structural benefits of the symmetrical dye D35. In the present study, solar cells based on D35 yielded the highest efficiency, thereby showing that structural properties are of central importance to solar cell efficiency.
Experimental section
General procedure for preparation of solar cells

          Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (Pilkington-TEC8) were cleaned using (in order) detergent solution, water and ethanol using an ultrasonic bath overnight. The conducting glass substrates were immersed in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. The screen-printing procedure was repeated (layers of ∼3 µm) with TiO2 paste to obtain a transparent nanocrystalline film of thickness around 10 µm. The preparation of TiO2 paste (∼25 nm colloidal particles) is described elsewhere.32 A scattering layer (∼3 µm, PST-400C, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals LTD) was deposited and a final thickness of 13.0 ± 0.2 µm was attained. The TiO2electrodes were gradually heated in an oven (Nabertherm Controller P320) in an air atmosphere. The temperature gradient program had four levels at 180 °C (10 min), 320 °C (10 min), 390 °C (10 min) and 500 °C (60 min). After sintering, the electrodes once again passed, as described above, a post-TiCl4 treatment. A second and final sintering, at 500 °C for 30 min, was performed. When the temperature decreased to 70 °C after the sintering, the electrodes were immersed into 0.2 mM dye solutions and kept for 16–17 h in darkness at room temperature. The solvent was ethanol (99.5%) for D35, acetonitrile (99.8%) for D29 and D37, respectively. After the adsorption of the dyes, the electrode was rinsed with the same solvent. The electrodes were assembled with a platinized counter electrode using a hot-melt Surlyn film. The redox electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M LiI (99.9%), 0.6 M TBAI (98%), 0.05 M I2 (99.9%), 0.5 M 4-TBP (99%), and 0.05 M GuSCN in acetonitrile (99.8%) was introduced through a hole drilled in the back of the counter electrode. Finally, the hole was also sealed with Surlyn film.
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements.
The current–voltage characteristics and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of the prepared solar cells were studied. Current–voltage measurements were carried out with a Newport Oriel 300 W Solar Simulator (Model 91160) with AM 1.5 G filter. The incident light intensity was 1000 W m−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. For the J–V curves, the solar cells were evaluated by using a slightly larger black mask (working area 0.25 cm2, aperture area of 0.49 cm2) on the cell surface to avoid diffusive light. IPCE measurements were carried out with a Xenon arc lamp (300 W), a 1/8 m monochromator, a source/meter, and a power meter with a 818-UV detector head.
Photophysical measurements
All UV–vis spectra of dye solutions (1 × 10−5 M in ethanol) were recorded on a Lambda 750 spectrophotometer using a 1 cm cuvette. All fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical experiments were performed with a CH Instruments electrochemical workstation (model 660A) using a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell. The supporting electrolyte consisted of 0.05 M TBAPF6 in DMF and dye concentrations of 1 × 10−3 M. A glass carbon disk was used as the working electrode, a platinum wire served as a counter electrode, a Ag/Ag+ electrode was utilized as a reference electrode, and the scan rate was 100 mV s−1. All potentials were calibrated vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) by the addition of ferrocene as an internal standard taking E° (Fc/Fc+) = 630 mV vs.NHE.
Electron-lifetime measurements
Electron lifetimes in the complete dye sensitized solar cell device were measured in a system using a red-light-emitting diode (Luxeon Star 1 W, λmax = 640 nm) as light source. Voltage traces were recorded using a 16-bit resolution data acquisition board (DAQ National Instruments) in combination with a current amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR570) and a custom-made system using electromagnetic relay switches. Electron lifetimes were determined by monitoring the transient voltage responses after a small light intensity modulation (square-wave modulation, <10% intensity of 0.5 Hz), and the step response was recorded by the DAQ board. The voltage response was well fitted to first-order decay, and time constants were thus obtained.
General synthetic procedure

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 500 and 400 MHz instruments by using the residual signals δ = 7.26 ppm and 77.0 ppm from CDCl3, δ = 2.50 and 39.4 ppm from [D6]-DMSO and δ = 2.05, 29.84, and 206.26 ppm from [D6]-acetone, as internal references for 1H and 13C respectively. HRMS was performed using a Q-Tof Micro (Micromass Inc., Manchester, England) mass spectrometer equipped with a Z-spray ionization source.

 	Fig. 1  Structures of the chromophores.	 

 	Scheme 1  Synthesis of the chromophores.	 

 	Fig. 2  Isodensity plots of the new organic chromophores, showing HOMO-1, HOMO and LUMO. Good charge separation is obtained by transferring an electron from an occupied orbital to the LUMO, facilitating electron injection. D37 is the only of the three dyes where the HOMO-1 orbital extends over the linker region, which explains the relatively strong second transition. Note that the butoxy groups have been truncated in the calculations, in order to save computational time. This does not significantly affect the electronic or spectral properties.	 

 	Fig. 3  Calculated gas-phase absorption spectra of the senzitisers. Each spectrum was generated by employing an arbitrary Gaussian broadening of 3000 cm−1, and the calculated transitions are shown as vertical lines. The right panel shows relative energy levels.
