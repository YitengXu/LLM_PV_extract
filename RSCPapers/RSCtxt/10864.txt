    , Accepted 12th July 2019First published on 22nd July 2019AbstractWe demonstrate carrier-gas assisted vapor deposition (CGAVD) as a promising synthesis technique for high-quality metal halide perovskite thin films. Wide tunability of film microstructure and morphology are accesible with CGAVD via the combination of several independently controllable experimental variables. Here, we examine in detail the material transport mechanisms in CGAVD and develop analytical expressions for deposition rates for the halide perovskite precursors MABr, MAI, SnBr2, and SnI2 as a function of experimentally tunable temperatures, pressures, and flow rates. The method is then applied to systematically control the growth of MASnBr3 thin films via co-deposition across a range of stoichiometries and morphologies. In varying source material temperature, carrier gas flow rate, dilution gas flow rate, substrate temperature, and chamber pressure, corresponding changes are realized in the degree of crystallinity, grain orientation, and average grain size (from ∼0.001 to >0.7 µm2). Thin films of MASnI3 and MASnBr3 deposited using CGAVD show resistivities of 0.6 Ω cm and 7 × 104 Ω cm, respectively, broadly consistent with previous reports.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskites have gained significant attention as active materials for optoelectronic devices, due to their tunable electronic and optical properties and their compatibility with high-throughput processing on flexible substrates.1–8 This interest has been amplified by the impressive performance of metal halide optoelectronics, with solar cell power conversion efficiencies exceeding 23% (ref. 9) and light-emitting diodes reaching external quantum efficiencies of >20%.10
It is widely acknowledged that film quality and morphology strongly impact device performance, as film microstructure can influence charge recombination and collection, shunting pathways, and ion migration kinetics.1,11–19 In turn, microstructure is dictated by the film processing technique and specific crystallization conditions.20 There is still much to understand regarding the interplay between synthesis conditions, film microstructure, and the resulting optoelectronic properties. The impact of grain boundaries on non-radiative recombination rates, for instance, is still an area of debate.21–24
Consequently, thin film deposition techniques that yield stoichiometrically precise, defect-free perovskite films with tunable morphology are becoming increasingly essential for device applications. Ideally, these techniques should be efficient in their use of materials, robust with respect to reproducibility, and scalable for high-throughput production.
These requirements have motivated a growing interest in vapor-based deposition techniques. The nascent body of work on vapor-deposited metal halide perovskites has already demonstrated deposition on large-area flexible substrates and fine control over film composition and morphology.25–65 Moreover, vapor deposition can enable facile growth of multi-layer stacks, such as an interlayer-free 2-terminal perovskite-Si tandem cell,66 thus providing a practical route to tandem and multi-layer perovskite solar cells.67,68
The most commonly employed vapor deposition methods utilize high-vacuum (∼10−6 Torr) thermal evaporation (VTE), either by co-evaporation or sequential evaporation of the precursor materials.25–32,40–47 An alternative but understudied approach is carrier-gas assisted vapor deposition (CGAVD), where an inert carrier gas such as N2 or Ar is used to transport source material vapors to the substrate at pressures >0.1 Torr. CGAVD provides a large parameter space to tune film composition and microstructure via six independently controllable pressures, temperatures, and flow rates. Indeed, CGAVD has been previously explored in the context of organic semiconductors, demonstrating exquisite control of composition and morphology, and enabling the growth of planar and bulk heterojunction devices.69–74
For metal halide perovskites, however, CGAVD has been only sporadically used. Jiang et al. and Leyden et al. have synthesized CsxFA1−xPbI3, MAPbBr3, and MAPbIxCl3−x35,38,59,75 using a “hybrid” approach, where the metal halide (e.g. PbI2) film is first deposited using a solution or high-vacuum process, and then CGAVD is used to expose that film to the organic halide (e.g. MAI).35,38,59,75,76 Where FA and MA refer to formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA), respectively. Power conversion efficiencies exceeding 15% have been achieved with perovskite films deposited using these two-step hybrid processes.36,76,77 We are aware of only two reports where the full perovskite film is deposited using CGAVD. Wang et al. use CGAVD to achieve epitaxial growth of single-crystal CsPbBr3 and CsSnBr3 on NaCl substrates.78 Tavakoli et al. form ∼1 µm grained, pinhole free MAPbI3−xClx films via CGAVD for incorporation into 11.1% efficient photovoltaic cells.34 However, no comprehensive exploration of the morphologies accessible using CGAVD has been reported, and consequently there is substantial room for further exploration and development of this promising technique.
In order to harness the full potential of CGAVD, a detailed understanding is needed of how changes in system pressures, temperatures, and flow rates impact film microstructure. Here, the impact of each parameter on source material transport and deposition rate is examined. By developing an analytical model for deposition rate, operating regimes are identified that lead to robust and repeatable film growth. Further systematic tuning of CGAVD experimental parameters is applied to engineer the microstructure and stoichiometry of MASnBrxI3−x thin films, including the degree of crystallinity, grain orientation, and grain size.
Experimental methods
MASnBrxI3−x thin films were deposited using the CGAVD system shown in Fig. 1. This system consists of a 3″ diameter quartz tube inside a three-zone cylindrical furnace. The axial temperature profile within the tube is controlled by the furnace temperature set points. Four 0.5″ diameter quartz tubes are positioned eccentrically inside the larger 3″ tube. Within each 0.5″ tube, source material powder (e.g., MABr, MAI, SnBr2, or SnI2) is packed in a porous frit and attached to a linear feedthrough with embedded thermocouples for real-time temperature monitoring. These linear feedthroughs are used to translate the sources axially to vary source material temperature.

Part numbers are defined as follows: (1) linear actuator with embedded thermocouple; (2) N2 carrier gas manifold; (3) showerhead for dilution gas delivery; (4) source material attached to linear actuator; (5) source material tube; (6) 3″ diameter quartz chamber; (7) water-cooled substrate holder; (8) ports for rough pump. (a) CAD model (to scale) of 4-source CGAVD system. (b) Schematic highlighting the six independent experimental parameters in CGAVD (orange boxes): the carrier gas flow rate CG,i; the dilution gas flow rate DIL; the source material temperature Ti; the gas temperature Tg; the substrate temperature Ts; and the deposition pressure P. 
Nitrogen, the carrier gas, flows through each source tube and over the source material, carrying sublimed vapor towards a cooled substrate. The tubes-within-tubes arrangement with independent carrier gas flows for each source minimizes back flow and source material contamination. Additional N2 is fed into the annular region around the source material tubes. This flow dilutes the vapors emerging from the source tubes, providing additional control over the species fluxes independent from the source material evaporation rate and chamber pressure. After exiting the source tube, the vapors impinge, condense, and/or react on the cooled substrate to form films.
Six independent experimental parameters can be varied (Fig. 1b) to alter the deposition of a source material i: the carrier gas flow rate CG,i; the chamber dilution gas flow rate DIL; the source material temperature, Ti; the chamber gas temperature Tg; the substrate temperature, Ts; and the total chamber pressure, P. All gas flow rates are set and maintained constant during deposition by mass flow controllers. The substrate temperature, Ts, is adjusted by changing cooling water temperature. The total pressure, P, is controlled by a combination of dilution gas and a valve before the pump. Typical values of the deposition parameters for synthesizing the MASnBrxI3−x thin films reported herein are listed in Table 1. Additional experimental details are provided in the ESI.†

Given the vast parameter space of CGAVD, it is imperative that a systematic and informed approach is adopted when developing this technique for metal halide perovskite depositions. For instance, a combination of low Ti and high CG,i during deposition can cause deposition rates to depend on the source material surface area (Fig. S1†), which is difficult to control and thus can introduce significant run-to-run variation.
Following Shtein et al.,71 an analytical model of mass transport in CGAVD was developed and used to calculate precursor species fluxes arriving at the substrate. A detailed treatment for a wide range of deposition conditions can be found in the ESI.† For the deposition conditions used herein, the flux of a material i at the surface of the substrate (ri) can be expressed as (1)where C1,i and C2,i are material-specific constants (see Table S1†), ΔHsi is the sublimation enthalpy, R is the universal gas constant, P0 = 760 Torr, and T0 = 25 °C. Eqn (1) elucidates the functional impact of different experimentally adjustable variables on the deposition rate. As ri has an exponential dependence on Ti, source material temperature can be used to make large changes in deposition rate. The dependence of deposition rate on CG,i, Tg, and P however, is linear, and these parameters can be used to easily make smaller, incremental adjustments in ri.
To validate and calibrate the model in eqn (1), neat films of MABr, MAI, SnBr2, and SnI2 were deposited at a variety of temperatures, pressures, and flow rates, while keeping the substrate temperature constant (Ts = 15 °C). These data were used to extract the enthalpy of sublimation, ΔHsi, for each material (Table 2) which agree well with available reported values. See Fig. S2† for the experimental data and fits of eqn (1).

Numbers in square brackets correspond to the 95% confidence intervals for these fits. Fig. S2 shows plotted fit data and fits vs.CG,i and Ti. No value for ΔHsMABr could be found in the literature; this range corresponds to the sublimation enthalpies for MACl and MAI,88 which bound the value for MABr

With the extracted values for C1,i, C2,i and ΔHsi, eqn (1) can be used to select processing conditions to deposit MASnBrxI3−x films at desired deposition rates and compositions (e.g., x = 2). For co-depositions involving two materials (denoted A and B), the ratio rA/rB represents the ratio of precursor species available to react and form the perovskite at the substrate/film surface (2)

Eqn (2) implies that changes in film stoichiometry during co-deposition of components A and B can be realized through changes in CG,A, CG,B, TA and/or TB. Here, we define the normalized precursor excess rA,B rA,B = (rA − rB)/min(rA, rB),(3)where rA,B = 0 indicates equal molar fluxes of species A and B, a negative value indicates excess metal halide (e.g., SnBr2) and a positive value indicates excess organic halide (e.g., MABr).
Results and discussion
Phase-pure, uniform MASnBrxI3−x on a variety of substrates
Phase pure MASnBr3 and MASnI3 thin films were deposited via one-step co-deposition by manipulating CG,i and Ti according to eqn (2) such that rMABr/rSnBr2 ∼ 1 and rMAI/rSnI2 ∼ 1, respectively. Moreover, MASnBrxI3−x (0 < x < 3) films were fabricated by depositing MASnI3 on top of MASnBr3 and using the relative thickness of each layer to achieve the desired stoichiometric ratio x. Deposition parameters for these films are listed in Table S2.†Fig. 2 shows X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical absorption, and photoluminescence (PL) from films with x = 0, 1.5, 2 and 3. These data are consistent with previous reports of MASnBrxI3−x synthesized using other techniques.52,79,80 XRD peaks shift monotonically to larger 2θ values with increasing Br content, from 16.5° (x = 0) to 17.5° (x = 3), implying a smooth phase-transition from tetragonal MASnI3 to pseudocubic MASnBr3 as described elsewhere.80 Strong texturing along (001) is evident for x = 0, 1.5, and 2. While texturing can be substantially tuned independent of stoichiometry using CGAVD, strong texturing is observed more readily for MASnI3 films than MASnBr3 films.
 Fig. 2  (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of MASnBr3, MASnI3, and MASnBrxI3−x films deposited on quartz using CGAVD. MASnI3 and MASnBrxI3−x films are highly oriented along [001], with small (111) and (102) peaks visible for MASnBr2I1. (b) Corresponding absorbance (solid lines) and photoluminescence (dashed lines) spectra. No significant photoluminescence is observed for x > 1.5, which is consistent with previous reports. Film thicknesses are 450 nm, 310 nm, 130 nm, and 410 nm for x = 3, 2, 1.5, and 0, respectively. See Table S2† for deposition parameters for these films. 
The measured optical absorption spectra (Fig. 2b) show absorption onsets decreasing from a wavelength of 880 nm for x = 0 to 575 nm for x = 3. Photoluminescence is observed at a wavelength of 730 nm for x = 1.5 and 960 nm for x = 0, with no significant PL from films with x ≥ 2. This is consistent with previous reports, where the PL efficiency was negligible (<0.1%) and no electroluminescence was observed from MASnBrxI3−x films with x > 1.5.80
Interestingly, the sequentially deposited MASnBr3 and MASnI3 films mix spontaneously even at substrate temperatures as low as 15 °C. To our knowledge, this is the first synthesis of MASnBrxI3−x by sequential deposition of single-halide perovskite films. This rapid and spontaneous mixing implies high I− and Br− diffusion rates within the perovskite crystal structure. Based on this observation, MASnBrxI3−x appears to be energetically favourable and stable at room temperature.
CGAVD deposited MASnBrxI3−x films are uniform over large areas. MASnBr3 grown on a silicon substrate, for example, has less than 10% thickness variation over 4 cm2, the largest area that can be accommodated in the current CGAVD system. Due to the collimated flow reaching the substrate, uniformity over larger areas should be attainable with larger CGAVD systems or by rotating the substrate.
In addition to uniformity over large areas, CGAVD enables the formation of morphologically similar films on a variety of different substrates and on materials used as electron- and hole-transport layers. Fig. S3† shows the morphology of MASnI3 and MASnBr3 films grown on various substrates including PEDOT:PSS, c-TiO2, Si, quartz, and indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass. The ability to deposit films with similar morphology on different surfaces provides an opportunity to conduct meaningful studies of the roles of electron- and hole-transport layers on films with comparable morphology.
Stoichiometric and morphological control viaCG,i and Ti
Following eqn (2), CG,i and Ti (i = MABr, SnBr2) were tuned to access a range of relative precursor fluxes and resulting film stoichiometries. Fig. S4a–f† shows SEM images of films deposited on quartz with −1 < rMABr,SnBr2 < 1. Deposition conditions for these films are shown in Table S3,† and XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S5.† Fig. S4g† shows average grain size as a function of film stoichiometry, where the films' phase-purity is calculated using the diffraction peak intensity. The XRD peak intensity ratios IMABr/IMASnBr3 and ISnBr2/IMASnBr3 are calculated by dividing the largest excess precursor (i.e., MABr or SnBr2) XRD peak intensity with that of the MASnBr3 (100) peak (at 2θ = 17.5°). Films are deemed “stoichiometric” if there are no observable diffractions from MABr or SnBr2. Average grain area is calculated by applying the Weka Trainable Segmentation tool in ImageJ to several SEM images taken from different locations on each substrate. Representative images and resulting grain boundaries are shown in Fig. S6.†
Films with excess MABr or excess SnBr2 are observed to have non-ideal microstructures. MABr-rich films have large grains (up to 10 µm2 for Fig. S4a†) but exhibit incomplete coverage and domains that appear to be perovskite grains surrounded by excess MABr. SnBr2-rich films exhibit small-grained structures that have significant pinholes, cracks, and ill-defined grain boundaries (Fig. S4e and f†). In contrast, stoichiometric films exhibit large (0.2 µm2), well-defined grains and dense substrate coverage (Fig. S4d†).
Interestingly, during these growths it was observed that on some occasions, non-zero rMABr,SnBr2 resulted in stoichiometric films; i.e. even without perfectly balanced precursor fluxes, no excess precursor peaks were observed in the XRD patterns. To investigate this further, MASnBr3 depositions were carried out at a variety of CG,i and Ti (i = MABr, SnBr2), and a range of substrate temperatures Ts. Fig. 3 shows that the range of rMABr,SnBr2 which results in stoichiometric films depends strongly on Ts. For low Ts of 15–20 °C, an imbalance of precursor fluxes still results in stoichiometric films for −0.3 < rMABr,SnBr2 < 0.3. This window increases for warmer Ts of 25–30 °C, where stoichiometric films are formed up to flux imbalances of −0.7 < rMABr,SnBr2 < 0.7. For Ts > 35 °C, this range extends further, such that a flux imbalance of −1 < rMABr,SnBr2 < 1 still results in a stoichiometric film. This result suggests that MASnBr3 films grown using CGAVD have a self-correcting window in the sense that the surface adsorption and reaction probabilities of MABr and/or SnBr2 adjust to balance their net incorporation rates into the film. This relaxes the need to balance the precursor fluxes exactly in order to deposit phase-pure MASnX3 films.
 Fig. 3  Impact of Ts on stoichiometrically “self-correcting” window for MASnBr3 films on quartz. For low Ts of 15–20 °C, an imbalance of precursor fluxes results in non-stoichiometric films for |rMABr,SnBr2| > 0.3. This window increases for warmer Ts of 25–30 °C where stoichiometric films are formed for |rMABr,SnBr2| < 0.7. For Ts > 35 °C, this range extends further, such that a flux imbalance of 100% for either SnBr2 or MABr still results in a stoichiometric film. 
Another important benefit of this “self-correcting” window is the ability to vary the film morphology while maintaining nominal film stoichiometry and phase purity, essentially decoupling morphological control from compositional control. Fig. 4a shows average grain area and the intensity of the (100) peak (normalized by film thickness) as a function of rMABr,SnBr2 for the stoichiometric films in Fig. 4b–f. XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S7.† In this case, rMABr,SnBr2 was tuned by adjusting the SnBr2 source temperature while keeping all other experimental variables constant. The intensity of the (100) diffraction peak is a measure of the film crystallinity and Fig. 4 shows that it changes dramatically with changes in rMABr,SnBr2, increasing by an order of magnitude from rMABr,SnBr2 = 0.27 to rMABr,SnBr2 = 0.5. Average grain size has a similar trend, increasing from 0.003 µm2 to over 0.2 µm2 for −0.75 < rMABr,SnBr2 < 0.5.
 Fig. 4  Film grain size (black squares) and crystallinity (red circles) for MASnBr3 on quartz within the stoichiometric region but at different MABr:SnBr2 flux ratios. rMABr,SnBr2 corresponding to each image (b–f) is labelled in (a). Here, the flux ratio was controlled by changing TSnBr2. All other variables remained constant for these depositions: CG,SnBr2 = 6 sccm, CG,MABr = 3 sccm, DIL = 191 sccm, TMABr = 136 °C, Tg = 300 °C, Ts = 30 °C, and P = 2.6 Torr. 
Morphological control viaP and Ts
For a given precursor flux ratio rMABr,SnBr2, the morphology of metal halide perovskite films can be further tuned using parameters such as P, DIL, and Ts. Fig. 5 shows the impact of deposition pressure P and substrate temperature Ts on grain size and orientation factor for phase-pure MASnBr3 films with constant rMABr,SnBr2 ≅ 1. Grain area distributions are shown in Fig. S8,† and representative SEM images are shown in Fig. S9.† The texture coefficient TChikili is calculated using eqn (4):81 (4)where Ihikili is the intensity of the measured (hikili) diffraction peak, I0,hikili is the intensity of the calculated hikili for a powdered crystalline sample, and N = 5 is the number of peaks considered. For a polycrystalline sample TChikili = 1, whereas TChikili < 1 indicates supressed (hikili) peaks and TChikili > 1 indicates orientation in the (hikili) direction.
 Fig. 5  Film grain size (a) and texture coefficient TChikili (b and c) as a function of P and Ts for MASnBr3 on quartz. All other variables remained constant for these depositions: CG,SnBr2 = 4 sccm, CG,MABr = 3 sccm, DIL = 20 sccm (for P < 2.6 Torr) or DIL = 200 sccm (for P ≥ 2.6 Torr), TSnBr2 = 233 °C, TMABr = 142 °C, and Tg = 300 °C. For all depositions, rMABr,SnBr2 ≅ 1. Grain size distributions, representative SEM images, and texture coefficients for additional peaks are shown in Fig. S8–S10.† 

Fig. 5a shows that increasing Ts results in larger grain sizes, with grain size increasing from Ts = 30 °C to Ts = 70 °C for all pressures. Interestingly, the degree to which deposition pressure impacts grain size appears to increase with increasing Ts. For Ts = 30 °C, changing the deposition pressure from 0.3 to 10 Torr has relatively little impact on average grain size. For Ts = 50 °C, however, the same change in pressure results in an approximate doubling of grain size. For Ts = 70 °C this effect is even more dramatic, as grain size triples from P = 0.3 Torr to P = 10 Torr. Grain size distributions (Fig. S8†) have a similar dependence on P and Ts; at low substrate temperatures (Ts = 30 °C), deposition pressure has little impact on grain size distributions, but for Ts > 30 °C, the range of grain areas increases with both P and Ts.
Film texturing can also be tuned using P and Ts. Fig. 5b and c show the texture coefficient for (100) and (110) peaks calculated using eqn (4), demonstrating the ability to preferentially orient or suppress these peaks. TChikili for additional peaks are shown in Fig. S10.† As with grain size, the dependence of TChikili on P varies with substrate temperature. Whereas the orientation of the (100) peak increases monotonically with increasing pressure for Ts ≥ 50 °C, this trend is not monotonic for Ts = 30 °C. For Ts ≥ 50 °C, the (110) peak can be nearly completely supressed at P = 10 Torr, but it is slightly oriented for Ts = 30 °C and P = 10 Torr.
Fig. 6 shows calculated and measured deposition rates for the films in Fig. 5 and S8.† Interestingly, deposition rates calculated including total precursor fluxes (eqn S(27)†) greatly overestimate the measured values, whereas excluding excess precursor flux (eqn S(26)†) results in a calculated deposition rate that agrees well with experiment. This good agreement is further evidence of the stoichiometrically self-correcting behavior of MASnBr3 deposited using CGAVD. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows that substrate temperatures used here have a minimal effect on deposition rate, allowing the independent tuning of morphology with Ts and P.
 Fig. 6  Measured and calculated deposition rates corresponding to the films in Fig. 5 and S8–S10.† Measured deposition rates agree well with calculated values when excess precursor flux is excluded (eqn S(26)†). Calculated deposition rates that include total flux of both precursors (eqn S(27)†) significantly overestimates deposition rate – indicating that excess precursor flux is rejected during MASnBr3 film formation using CGAVD. 
Electrical properties vs. stoichiometry
To probe the electrical properties of CGAVD-grown MASnBr3 and MASnI3 films, 4-terminal resistivity measurements were taken at 280 K. As reported elsewhere,82,83 MASnBr3 films were much more resistive than MASnI3 films. Resistivities of 0.6 Ω cm and 7 × 104 Ω cm are obtained for MASnI3 and MASnBr3, respectively, consistent with previous reports.82–84
For MASnI3, the lower resistivity enabled Hall effect measurements to be made as a function of excess precursor species (IMAI/IMASnI3 or ISnI2/IMASnI3). Fig. S11† shows the corresponding resistivity (ρ), hole concentration (p), and Hall mobility (µ) for MASnI3 films at 280 K. All MASnI3 films were p-type, with hole concentration rising by nearly one order of magnitude from ∼2 × 1019 cm−3 to ∼1020 cm−3, as the film composition moves from SnI2 excess to MAI excess. Hole conduction is typically associated with the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+,84–86 and the relatively high concentrations (1019–1020 cm−3) may be due to the lack of a reducing agent such as SnF2, as well as air exposure of the source material and films during loading and unloading from the CGAVD chamber and preparation for electronic transport measurements. Consequently, mobilities calculated assuming the Drude model (i.e., ρ = 1/epµ where e is the electric charge) are relatively low for these films, ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, compared to typical Hall mobilities reported in the literature for MASnI3 (1.6–2320 cm2 V−1 s−1).82,87
The carrier concentrations and mobilities reported herein are not optimized, and represent a relatively narrow range of the experimental parameter space. Optimization of electrical and optical properties as a function of deposition conditions, reducing agents (such as SnF2), and minimized air exposure are ongoing.
Conclusion
This work presents a detailed treatment of the transport regimes and operating conditions required to grow high-quality halide perovskite thin films via a carrier-gas assisted vapor deposition (CGAVD) technique. While this technique has been previously explored in the context of organic semiconductors, it has yet to be fully harnessed for optimizing perovskite thin film synthesis. By developing and applying an analytical model for the deposition rates of MABr, MAI, SnBr2, and SnI2, we are able to synthesize uniform MASnBrxI3−x thin films on a variety of substrates. By varying source material temperature, carrier gas flow rate, dilution gas flow rate, substrate temperature, and chamber pressure, we realize changes in the degree of crystallinity, grain orientation, and average grain size (from ∼0.001 to >0.7 µm2) for MASnBr3 thin films. Preliminary measurements show resistivities of 0.6 Ω cm for MASnI3 and 7 × 104 Ω cm for MASnBr3 at 280 K. We systematically probe resistivity, hole concentration, and mobility for MASnI3 films as a function of precursor excess, and find relatively high carrier concentrations likely associated with the lack of reducing agent and potential air exposure. The ability of films grown using CGAVD to stoichiometrically self-correct by rejecting excess precursors, even with substantially unbalanced precursor flux rates, underscores the robustness of this technique.

 	Fig. 2  (a) X-ray diffraction patterns of MASnBr3, MASnI3, and MASnBrxI3−x films deposited on quartz using CGAVD. MASnI3 and MASnBrxI3−x films are highly oriented along [001], with small (111) and (102) peaks visible for MASnBr2I1. (b) Corresponding absorbance (solid lines) and photoluminescence (dashed lines) spectra. No significant photoluminescence is observed for x > 1.5, which is consistent with previous reports. Film thicknesses are 450 nm, 310 nm, 130 nm, and 410 nm for x = 3, 2, 1.5, and 0, respectively. See Table S2† for deposition parameters for these films.	 

 	Fig. 3  Impact of Ts on stoichiometrically “self-correcting” window for MASnBr3 films on quartz. For low Ts of 15–20 °C, an imbalance of precursor fluxes results in non-stoichiometric films for |rMABr,SnBr2| > 0.3. This window increases for warmer Ts of 25–30 °C where stoichiometric films are formed for |rMABr,SnBr2| < 0.7. For Ts > 35 °C, this range extends further, such that a flux imbalance of 100% for either SnBr2 or MABr still results in a stoichiometric film.	 

 	Fig. 4  Film grain size (black squares) and crystallinity (red circles) for MASnBr3 on quartz within the stoichiometric region but at different MABr:SnBr2 flux ratios. rMABr,SnBr2 corresponding to each image (b–f) is labelled in (a). Here, the flux ratio was controlled by changing TSnBr2. All other variables remained constant for these depositions: CG,SnBr2 = 6 sccm, CG,MABr = 3 sccm, DIL = 191 sccm, TMABr = 136 °C, Tg = 300 °C, Ts = 30 °C, and P = 2.6 Torr.	 
	(4)

 	Fig. 5  Film grain size (a) and texture coefficient TChikili (b and c) as a function of P and Ts for MASnBr3 on quartz. All other variables remained constant for these depositions: CG,SnBr2 = 4 sccm, CG,MABr = 3 sccm, DIL = 20 sccm (for P < 2.6 Torr) or DIL = 200 sccm (for P ≥ 2.6 Torr), TSnBr2 = 233 °C, TMABr = 142 °C, and Tg = 300 °C. For all depositions, rMABr,SnBr2 ≅ 1. Grain size distributions, representative SEM images, and texture coefficients for additional peaks are shown in Fig. S8–S10.†	 

 	Fig. 6  Measured and calculated deposition rates corresponding to the films in Fig. 5 and S8–S10.† Measured deposition rates agree well with calculated values when excess precursor flux is excluded (eqn S(26)†). Calculated deposition rates that include total flux of both precursors (eqn S(27)†) significantly overestimates deposition rate – indicating that excess precursor flux is rejected during MASnBr3 film formation using CGAVD.
