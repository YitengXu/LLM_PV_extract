    , Accepted 20th October 2014First published on 20th October 2014AbstractTwo TPB-based HTMs were synthesized and their energy levels were tuned to match with perovskite by introducing electron-donating groups asymmetrically. The TPBC based doping-free perovskite solar cell afforded an impressive PCE of 13.10% under AM 1.5G illumination, which is the first case of an effective device with TPB-based doping-free HTMs.
Very recently, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3, where X corresponds to halogenes) solar cells have attracted much attention due to their simple structure, low production cost and superb photovoltaic performance. Using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as a hole transporting material (HTM) instead of liquid electrolytes in this hybrid solar cell, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 15.0% were achieved under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2).1–4 Although spiro-OMeTAD has been considered as the best candidate HTM for perovskite solar cells, intensive effort has been devoted to develop cheaper alternatives to spiro-OMeTAD. Several polymer hole conductors have been employed as HTMs and the highest PCE was 12.0% based on PTAA.5 Compared to polymer HTMs, small-molecule HTMs benefit from the fact that they are easy to purify and easily form crystalline films for the fabrication of desired high efficiency devices. Various small-molecule HTMs, such as 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-,6 pyrene-,7 linear π-conjugated structure,8 butadiene-,9 swivel-cruciform thiophene-,10 oligothiophene-,11 tetrathiafulvalene-,12 quinolizinoacridine,13 and 1,3,5-triazine-14 based HTMs, have been developed and gave an efficiency of 8.8–13.8%. Our group has reported the synthesis of several triphenylamine-based small-molecule HTMs, and impressive performances (PCE = 11.6%) have been achieved with these HTMs.8,9 From the commercialization viewpoint, the exploration of efficient and cost-effective HTM is still the key challenge for further advancement of the hybrid perovskite solar cell.

N,N,N′,N′-tetraphenyl-benzidine (TPB), one essential HTM, has been widely used in diverse organic electronic devices such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),15–19etc. It also usually serves as a building block for construction of largely conjugated HTM molecules due to its superb hole-transport ability.20 Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, development and application of TPB-based HTM in perovskite solar cells have been neglected. In our previous work, TPB was introduced into the perovskite solar cells to engineer the metal–semiconductor interface.21 The PCE increased by about 28% after interface modification. We also proved that TPB could enhance the interfacial resistance of the CH3NH3PbI3/Au interface to favor the reduction of dark current effectively and lead to improvement in open-circuit voltage (Voc). The higher LUMO of TPB compared to perovskite could block the electron transport and hence suppress the carrier recombination. However, TPB exhibits a deeper HOMO than that of perovskite, which is unfavorable for hole transportation. The antagonistic contribution of electron-blocking and hole-transport leads to a relatively low PCE (6.71%).21
Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two TPB-based HTMs (TPBS and TPBC) as shown in Fig. 1(a), as well as their application in perovskite solar cells. The device, fabricated with TPBC as HTM, achieves a PCE of 13.10% without doping under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. This result is comparable with that obtained using the well-known p-type doping spiro-OMeTAD. By simply introducing 3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene (EDOT) and N-ethylcarbazol (NEC) into the TPB skeleton, the energy levels of the TPB-core HTMs are tuned to match with the perovskite, which is expected to benefit hole transportation and retard electron transportation. Additionally, the nonplanar configuration of the TPB core could be expected to prevent close contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and HTMs, which favors to reduce electronic coupling and charge recombination.
 Fig. 1  (a) Molecular structures of HTMs; (b) synthetic route for HTMs. 
The TPB-core HTMs were synthesized through a simple process with low cost based on Wittig reaction according to our previous report.22 The synthetic route for the HTMs is depicted in Fig. 1(b) and experimental details are given in the ESI.† The new TPB derivatives (TPBS and TPBC) were fully characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrum, and elemental analysis (ESI†). All the analytical data are consistent with the proposed structures. The two HTMs have good solubility in commonly used solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and toluene, etc.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of TPBS, TPBC and TPB in dichloromethane (DCM) are depicted in Fig. 2(a). As shown in the UV-vis spectra, the absorption band of TPB is located in the UV range. While for TPBS and TPBC, the extended conjugation length results in a red shift of their absorption band to the visible range.23 This suggests that introduction of electron-donating moieties (EDOT and NEC) could increase the electron density in the TPB core and hence tune the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels effectively. Besides, TPBS and TPBC exhibit fine structure (shoulder peak) in DCM due to the substitution on the TPB core.
 Fig. 2  (a) Normalized absorption spectra of TPBS, TPBC and TPB in DCM; (b) the energy level diagram of the corresponding materials used in perovskite solar cells. 
The energy levels of these HTMs (Table 1) are determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S1, ESI†) in dilute DCM solutions and relative data are listed in Table 1. It is found that both the HOMO levels of TPBS (−5.30 eV) and TPBC (−5.33 eV) are higher than that of the TPB core (−5.52 eV), which is caused by the electron-donating effect of EDOT and NEC. Fig. 2(b) shows the energy level diagram of the corresponding materials in the devices. The HOMO levels for TPBS and TPBC could well match with the valence band of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV), which is energetically favorable to hole transfer at the interface. Furthermore, since the Voc of the solar cell is governed by the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi levels of the electrons in the TiO2 and the HOMO of the HTM,6TPBS and TPBC could be expected to afford a higher Voc than spiro-OMeTAD for perovskite solar cells because of their deeper HOMO than spiro-OMeTAD (−5.15 eV). Besides, the LUMO levels of TPBS (−2.45 eV) and TPBC (−2.39 eV) are higher than the conduction band edge of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.93 eV), which could block the electron transportation from CH3NH3PbI3 to Au and hence suppress carrier recombination.21

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements show that TPBS and TPBC have high decomposition temperatures (Td, 381 °C and 474 °C for TPBS and TPBC, respectively) and glass transition temperatures (Tg, 104 °C and 105 °C for TPBS and TPBC, respectively) (Fig. S2, ESI†). This result reveals that these two HTMs have excellent thermal stability to favor their practical application in the device.
The hole transporting mobilities of TPBS and TPBC are evaluated by time-of-flight (TOF) measurements (Fig. S3, ESI†). The hole mobility (μ) is calculated according to the equation μ = d2/Vtτ, where d, V and tτ is the film thickness, applied bias voltage and transit time, respectively. It is found that the hole-drift mobilities of TPBS and TPBC are 3.87 × 10−4 and 4.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, at an electric field of 2.3 × 105 V cm−1, which are little higher than that of TPB (2.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1)18 and the well-known small molecular HTM spiro-OMeTAD (2 × 10−4 cm V−1 s−1 determined using the same technique24). The high hole mobility indicated that these HTMs could have great potential for application in perovskite solar cells.
The photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells based on TPBS and TPBC as HTMs without doping is evaluated. The device based on p-type doping spiro-OMeTAD as HTM is also fabricated for a comparative study. Fig. 3(a) illustrates the structure of the perovskite solar cell. Clear interfaces in the device structure are observed in the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 3(b)). The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves for FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au solar cells are presented in Fig. 3(c) and related parameters are summarized in Table 2. As expected, TPBS and TPBC give a higher Voc than spiro-OMeTAD for the device, which is commensurate with their deeper HOMO level. The best cell affords an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 942 mV, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.32 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72, leading to a PCE of 13.10% under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. This result is comparable to that of spiro-OMeTAD with lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) as dopants.13 However, devices based on p-doping TPBS and TPBC exhibit much poorer performance, especially in terms of FF and Jsc. Further investigation of the effect of the dopant and the optimization of the doping process is in process. The IPCE spectrum of the cell with the two HTMs is presented in Fig. 3(d). An integral photocurrent from the overlap of the IPCE spectrum is 15.2 mA cm−2 and 17.9 mA cm−2 for TPBS and TPBC, respectively, basically in agreement with the experimentally obtained Jsc.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis is carried out, in which the potential bias is applied from 400 to 900 mV in the dark in the frequency range from 105 to 0.1 Hz, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). According to the simplified transmission line model, the main arc mainly attributes to the combination of the recombination resistance (Rrec) and the chemical capacitance of the film (CPEμ) (inset of Fig. 4(a)).25–27 By fitting the Nyquist plots, the bias voltage dependence of Rrec for both TPBS and TPBC is obtained (Fig. 4(c)). For both HTMs, the declined Rrec is observed as the forward bias voltage increased, which could be ascribed to the elevated Fermi level in the mesoscopic TiO2 under the forward bias (>500 mV).9 The larger Rrec of the device with TPBC than TPBS at the same forward bias voltage suggests that TPBC as the HTM is superior to TPBS in preventing charge recombination. The larger Rrec is supposed to favor the improvement of photovoltaic performance, which is in agreement with the results listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the decreased Rrec of the device with p-doped TPBS and TPBC indicates more charge recombination and worse photovoltaic performance, which is consistent with the results listed in Table 2. The Nyquist plots of the device based on p-type doped TPBS and TPBC in the dark over different forward biases are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).

TPBC is taken as a model HTM to further investigate the influence of HTM deposition amount on the cell performance. As shown in Fig. 4(d) and Table S1 (ESI†), the cell fabricated at very low HTM concentration (5 mg mL−1) exhibits poor photovoltaic performance. This could be explained by the reason that effective ohmic contact is difficult to construct between the metal–semiconductor interface due to the very thin HTM layer.21 The best device performance is achieved as the HTM concentration is 20 mg mL−1. The worse cell performance at high HTM concentration (>20 mg mL−1) could be ascribed to the elevated series resistance caused by the increased HTM layer thickness at higher concentration.9 At the range of 20–100 mg mL−1, the higher Voc at lower HTM concentration is mainly due to the declined dark current as the HTM film thickness decreased.28 This result proves that suitable HTM layer thickness will facilitate the cell performance.
Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay measurement has been conducted to understand the charge transfer (Fig. S5, ESI†) and the PL decay time (τ) is estimated by fitting the data with the bi-exponential decay function.29 Without the HTM layer, the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface exhibits a long decay time of 102.18 ns. While a significantly reduced τ is observed for the device with TPBS (34.2 ns) and TPBC (11.4 ns), which indicates fast charge transfer at the CH3NH3PbI3/HTM interface.29 Besides, the charge transfer from perovskite to TPBC is faster than that of TPBS, which suggests that TPBC has better hole pumping capacity.9
In addition, the reproducibility of the cells’ performance based on the new HTMs (TPBS and TPBC) is evaluated by testing photovoltaic parameters of ten cells. Related data are presented in Table S2, ESI.† The standard deviation of PCE for the cells with TPBS and TPBC is 0.36% and 0.26%, respectively. These results indicate good reproducibility in our study.
In summary, two TPB-based HTMs (TPBS and TPBC) are successfully synthesized by a simple process with low cost. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these TPB derivatives are effectively tuned to match with perovskite by introducing electron-donating groups asymmetrically into the TPB core, which is demonstrated by optical and electrochemical studies. The perovskite solar cell based on TPBC as HTM without doping affords an impressive PCE of 13.10%, which is comparable to that obtained employing the well-known p-doping spiro-OMeTAD. This result provides compelling evidence for the first time that small-molecule HTMs with the TPB core have great potential for the application in highly efficient doping-free perovskite solar cells.
