    , Accepted 24th February 2022First published on 24th February 2022AbstractUtilizing sunlight to produce valuable chemicals from methane serves as a promising green strategy, exploiting hydroxyl radicals generated by water photooxidation to accomplish methane C–H activation. However, the selective and efficient synthesis of multicarbon compounds for direct methane conversion remains highly challenging. Herein, we present a composite catalyst composed of reduced graphene oxide/titanium dioxide (RGO/TiO2) with abundant oxygen vacancies for photocatalytic methane conversion to C2 and C3 oxygenates using only water vapor as an oxidant under mild conditions. The optimized catalyst achieves aldehyde and acetone yields of 289.6 and 191.2 μmol gcat−1 h−1, respectively, and multicarbon oxygenate selectivity as high as 97% under simulated solar irradiation, far superior to those of state-of-the-art photocatalytic processes. Comprehensive characterization demonstrates the synergistic effect between the π–π-conjugated substrate of RGO and the oxygen vacancies of TiO2, expanding visible light absorption and increasing charge separation/transfer efficiency, resulting in outstanding photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations suggest favorable chain growth routes through methane–methanol–CO-oxygenate pathways. Our findings provide insights into the design of highly active and stable photocatalysts for selectively converting methane into desirable value-added chemicals under ambient conditions.
Introduction
As the principal component of natural gas and shale gas, abundant and affordable methane (CH4) is not only a high-quality clean fossil energy source but also an indispensable feedstock in the manufacture of value-added chemicals.1 Direct conversion of CH4 to chemicals remains highly challenging because perfectly symmetrical tetrahedral CH4 molecules exhibit high C–H bond strength (439 kJ mol−1), negligible electron/proton affinity, and low polarizability.2–4 Conventional industrial large-scale transformation of CH4 is performed indirectly, resulting in preliminary conversion into syngas—a mixture of H2 and CO—via steam or dry reforming as the feedstock and a subsequent Fischer–Tropsch synthesis of syngas at high temperature and pressure to produce various chemicals. For other potential thermocatalytic routes, such as oxidative and nonoxidative couplings of methane (OCM and NOCM), the activation of C–H bonds requires either highly oxidative reactants or extremely high temperatures, which may cause target products such as ethylene or aromatics to be further converted to CO and CO2 or coke.2–4 Therefore, with the urgent need to mitigate safety and environmental concerns and reduce running costs, developing direct methane conversion to valuable chemicals under ambient conditions is highly desirable.5
Photocatalytic oxidation of methane (POM) has emerged as a promising green route for direct methane conversion, enabling C–H bond cleavage under mild conditions by virtue of photoexcitation instead of high-temperature activation. However, a trade-off between photocatalytic productivity and selectivity remains extremely difficult,6,7 and the dominant product in POM is still methanol (CH3OH), while higher-value products such as multicarbon oxygenates are seldom reported.8,9 This is largely because C1 oxygenated products such as methanol and formaldehyde are more active than the methane molecule itself and are prone to deep mineralization to CO and CO2,10 making it challenging to selectively produce target chemicals containing C–C bonds.
To achieve efficient POM to multicarbon compounds, the key challenges lie in precisely controlling the intermediate to be suitable for C–C coupling while fulfilling the essential C–H photoexcitation steps. Choosing an appropriate oxidant is important for controllable POM to selectively produce multicarbon compounds. Oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and molecular oxygen (O2) have been reported to successfully oxidize methane over colloidal gold-palladium nanoparticles supported on titania catalysts in aqueous solution at mild temperature.11 However, because of their relatively strong oxidizability, it is difficult for H2O2 and O2 to preserve the available C–C coupling intermediates that are easier to oxidize to CO2 under practical conditions.12 Alternatively, water is the most abundant natural oxygen source for moderately reactive species and can be used for methane photooxidation at a lower cost.9,13 Upon excitation of a flux of photons with an energy of only several electron volts, water is stimulated to split into reactive and electrophilic oxygen species that readily initiate C–H dissociation and realize photocatalytic methane conversion with a markedly decreased energy barrier.14,15 It is important to develop efficient and inexpensive catalysts to utilize H2O to selectively convert methane to desirable multicarbon products under ambient conditions.
On the other hand, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has long been the most promising photocatalyst because of its natural abundance, photostability and nontoxicity. However, TiO2 possesses a wide band gap, leading to insufficient visible light absorption and rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers.16–19 Thus, extensive efforts to modify the electronic band structures of TiO2 for visible light harvesting are being made, and composites of TiO2 coupled with nanoscale carbonaceous materials have exhibited promising potential.16–19
Here, we show that by tuning the band structures of TiO2 supported on reduced graphene oxide (RGO), CH4 can be selectively and efficiently converted into multicarbon products under simulated solar irradiation using only water vapor as an oxidant. We demonstrate that the synergistic effect between the π–π-conjugated substrate of RGO and oxygen vacancies (O-vacancies) of TiO2 can expand the visible light absorption and improve the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer. Moreover, abundant single-electron-trapped O-vacancies of TiO2 induced by the interaction with RGO initiate H2O oxidation to hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), which then activate methane to generate methyl radicals (˙CH3). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that ˙OH reacts with ˙CH3 to quickly form CH3OH, which is easily photooxidized into another product, CO. The formed CO can also serve as a key intermediate for C–C coupling reactions by the suitable adsorption of the related intermediates on O-vacancy sites. Consequently, we propose a possible photooxidation pathway (CH4–CH3OH–CO) and a photoreduction pathway (CO-oxygenates) for direct methane conversion to multicarbon oxygenates. This study not only provides a mild strategy for controllable titania O-vacancy generation to activate and convert methane but also demonstrates deeper mechanistic research to understand the reaction pathway of POM to multicarbon products through defect engineering.
Experimental methods
Reagents
Graphene oxide (GO) was purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd. Anhydrous ethanol (C2H5O) and titanium isopropoxide (C12H28O4Ti) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. Deionized water from a Master-S30UVF system was used throughout all experiments, and all chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
Synthesis
Typically, 50 mg of GO was dispersed into 30 g of anhydrous ethanol in a glove box, followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 30 min and magnetic agitation overnight to obtain a yellow GO suspension. Then, 3.38 g of titanium isopropoxide was added dropwise to the above GO suspension under vigorous magnetic agitation overnight. Subsequently, the sealed bottle containing the titanium precursor and GO suspension was removed from the glove box and attached to a custom purging device. The purging device was first vacuumed to ensure no air and water vapor inside the bottle, and then the ethanol in the bottle was dried under the continuous purge of high-purity nitrogen at a flow rate of 400 mL min−1. Next, the water vapor from the ultrapure water at different temperatures (20 to 90 °C) carried by the nitrogen flow was transferred into the bottle for restrained hydrolysis for 24 h to obtain a gray powder. The hydrolysis rate of the titanium precursor could be adjusted by controlling the water vapor content from ultrapure water at different temperatures. The gray powder was put into a U-type quartz tube and calcined at 450 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under a N2 flow (99.999%, 100 mL min−1). The as-obtained composite catalyst-reduced graphene oxide-supported titanium dioxide (RGO/TiO2) was further denoted as RGTX, where “X” = 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90, representing the temperature of ultrapure water (°C). For comparison, the reference catalyst pure TiO2 (denoted as T20) was synthesized at an ultrapure water temperature of 20 °C by the same restrained hydrolysis method without the addition of GO.
Photocatalytic tests
Tests of the photocatalytic oxidation of gas-phase methane were conducted in a 30 mL custom gas-tight quartz cell equipped with a quartz window to allow light irradiation and a constant temperature circulator (60 °C) under atmospheric pressure. In a typical process, 10 mg of each as-prepared catalyst was ultrasonically suspended in 2 mL of anhydrous ethanol solution, dispersed for 30 min, and then uniformly brushed onto a 2 cm × 2 cm stainless steel mesh, and the catalyst loading amount was 0.25 mg cm−2. After drying at 40 °C in a vacuum (5 × 10−4 Torr) oven overnight, the mesh loaded with the catalyst was placed in the cell. Then, the cell was purged with argon (99.999%, 100 mL min−1) for 30 min, and a humidified (20 °C water vapor) 10% CH4/Ar gas stream with a steady flow of 4 mL min−1 was introduced and irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300) with simulated solar light (air mass (AM) 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The light intensity was measured by using an optical power meter (CEL-NP 2000). The cell outlet flow was maintained at 60 °C and directly vented into two online gas chromatographs (GC-2014, Shimadzu). One GC was equipped with two 60- to 80-mesh HayeSep C columns and a 50- to 80-mesh ShinCarbon ST column for product-gas separation and a flame ionization detector (FID) for oxygenate detection. Another GC was equipped with a molecular sieve-13X 60/80 column and a Porapark-Q80/100 column, a methanizer, an FID detector, and a TCD detector to analyze ethane, ethylene, CO and H2 products. GC runs were initiated every 15 min. The gas chromatograms for the detection of POM products were quantified by an external standard method using the different standard gases with certain product proportions (purchased from Shanghai Pujiang Special Gas Co., Ltd.).
The oxygenate products of the methane photooxidation reaction were further quantified using 1H NMR spectra obtained by means of a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker). For the NMR measurements, 0.5 mL of the liquid containing oxygenate products collected in an ice-water bath containing ultrapure water was mixed with 0.1 mL of D2O and 0.1 mL of 6 mM 3-trimethylsilyl-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium salt as the external standard substance (1H NMR standard for D2O solvent, DSS, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.). The possible acid products were also examined by an ion chromatography (ICS-5000+, Thermo Scientific).
Product analysis
The yields of products were calculated by using the concentrations (ppm) detected by GC as follows: (1)where CCH4 is the flow rate of CH4 (4 mL min−1); ppm is the concentration of the gas-phase products, including methanol, aldehyde, ethanol, propanal, acetone, ethane, ethylene, CO or H2; and m is the loading mass of each catalyst. The selectivity of C1 products (CO and methanol), C2 products (aldehyde and ethanol) and C3 products (propanal and acetone) were calculated as follows: (2)where yieldC1 = yieldCO + yieldmethanol, yieldC2 = yieldaldehyde + yieldethanol, and yieldC3 = yieldpropanal + yieldacetone.
Characterization
The crystal structures of the catalysts were obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) in the 2θ range from 5° to 80° at 40 kV and 40 mA. XRD patterns were recorded at a scan rate of 2° min−1. Identification of the crystalline structures was performed by comparing the XRD peaks to Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) cards. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were performed on a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) was conducted by using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3010) equipped with an integrating sphere attachment. The spectra were recorded in the range from 200 to 800 nm with optically pure BaSO4 as a reference. The diffuse reflectance coefficient (R), deduced from the absorbance of catalysts, was converted to the Kubelka–Munk function F(R) as Tauc plots for further calculations. Raman spectroscopy measurements were carried out on a Horiba Aramis confocal microprobe Raman instrument with an argon ion (Ar+) laser (λ = 514.5 nm) at a laser power of approximately 5 mW. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were obtained using a Nd-YAG laser with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe instrument using monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV; work function = 4.62 eV) performed at 12 kV and 4 mA. The binding energies of all XPS spectra were calibrated to the C 1s peak (284.80 eV) and fitted with the Gaussian–Lorenz function after removing the extrinsic loss structure by Shirley-type background subtraction. The XPS spectra were deconvoluted by using a commercially available data-fitting program (XPSPEAK 41 software) after a Shirley background subtraction procedure. The parameters were fitted to the experimental envelope by a least square iterative procedure. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were performed to detect oxygen vacancies of the catalysts on a Bruker A300 EPR spectrometer (9.855 GHz) at room temperature. EPR spectra of radicals spin-trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were recorded by means of a Bruker spectrometer, and a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5 filter was used as the light irradiation source. The catalysts were dispersed in CH4-dissolved water to detect methyl radicals (˙CH3) and hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) by EPR. In the free radical detection process, 10 mg of catalysts were dispersed in 5 mL of ultrapure water. After ultrasonic vibration, 200 μL of the suspension was mixed with 100 μL of the DMPO solution at a concentration of 100 mmol and then packed into a capillary tube at a constant temperature of 60 °C. The signals of ˙CH3 and ˙OH were detected after simulated sunlight irradiation for 5 min.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on a Biologic VMP3 potentiostat using a three-electrode quartz cell system. A clean glassy carbon electrode comprising the deposited catalyst layer was employed as the working electrode, and a Pt wire and KCl-saturated Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. An aqueous mixture of 0.2 mol L−1 KCl (GR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) and 0.2 mol L−1 K3[Fe(CN)6] (AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) served as the electrolyte. In a typical preparation of the working electrode, 10 mg of catalyst powder was ultrasonically dispersed in 0.5 mL of 0.25 wt% Nafion ethanol solution for 30 min to form a homogeneous ink, and then 10 μL of the ink was added dropwise onto the working area of the glassy carbon electrode using a micropipette and dried at room temperature. Before the EIS measurements, the solution was purged with Ar and then bubbled with sufficient CH4 to form a CH4-saturated electrolyte solution. A Nyquist plot was recorded at the open circuit voltage with a sinusoidal signal of 10 mV amplitude over a frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz. An equivalent Randles circuit model was fitted to the data only in the high-frequency region to calculate the resistance of charge transfer (Rct) for each catalyst. Transient photocurrent response tests were conducted on the same Biologic VMP3 potentiostat using the chronoamperometry method at a fixed potential of 0 mV vs. Ag/AgCl under chopped illumination periods of 50 s. The CEL-HXF300 Xe lamp (300 W, AM1.5G) was used as the light irradiation source. Carbon paper pieces (2 cm × 2 cm) coated with the photocatalyst film (1 mg) were used as the working electrode, a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and KCl-saturated Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. The CH4-saturated 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte solution. Mott–Schottky plots of catalysts were obtained in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution by impedance measurement at a fixed frequency of 500 Hz using a CHI 660E three-electrode electrochemical workstation equipped with Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) and a Pt wire as the reference electrode. The catalyst to be tested was rotary coated on the round-shape conductive glass (diameter, 3 cm) as the working electrode by controllable spin-coating method (spin coater, KW-4A).
DFT calculations
Spin-polarized DFT simulations were carried out by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).20,21 The projector-augmented wave (PAW)22,23 potentials and the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)21 were used to display the electron–ion interaction as well as the electron–electron exchange and correlation functional, respectively. The cutoff energy was set to 400 eV in the calculations. Based on the characterization results, two catalyst models were constructed: a TiO2(101) surface without vacancies and a TiO2(101) surface with O-vacancies. This (2 × 2) TiO2(101) structure contains six layers of O–Ti–O and thus 12 atomic layers consisting of 24 titanium atoms and 48 oxygen atoms. We fixed the bottom three layers of the surface at the bulk positions, while the other layers were allowed to relax. A vacuum layer of 13 Å between adjacent surfaces was set to prevent the influence of neighboring slabs on the calculated energies and reactions. A Monkhorst–Pack24 mesh (3 × 4 × 1) grid was used during the optimization. The convergence criterion was set to 0.03 eV Å−1 for the force and 10−5 eV per atom for energy. As reported in the literature,25 the most stable form of O-vacancies was constructed by removing a twofold coordinated bridging oxygen atom. Therefore, we chose this structure to model the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface. In this model, one 2-coordinate oxygenate was removed from the perfect (2 × 2) TiO2(101) surface. A DFT plus Hubbard model (DFT + U) of Ueff = 4 eV was applied to the Ti d states.26 Grimme's DFT-D3 scheme was used to treat the van der Waals interactions to overcome the failure of standard DFT in the description of molecule/surface long range interactions.27 The transition states were determined by initially applying the force reversed method28 and further optimizing using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB).29,30 The transition states were confirmed by vibrational analysis yielding one imaginary frequency. The Gibbs free energy can be expressed as follows: ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE − TΔS, where ΔE, ΔZPE, and ΔS are the reaction energy calculated using the DFT methods, the changes in zero-point energies, and the entropy during the reaction, respectively. The entropy and ZPE of the adsorbates were computed based on the normal-mode vibrational frequencies, while the entropy of the gaseous molecules was taken from the NIST Chemistry WebBook (Tables S1 and S2†).31
Results and discussion
Catalyst preparation and characterization

Scheme 1 shows the general restrained hydrolysis processes and an illustration of the synergistic effect between RGO and TiO2 for selective and efficient photooxidation of methane to multicarbon products. After complete solvent evaporation in the uniform suspension of titanium isopropoxide and GO (Scheme 1a), the dispersity and granularity of titania were affected by the hydrolysis rate of the titanium precursor. The water vapor content controlled by the water temperature in the restrained hydrolysis synthesis determined the size of the intermediate titanium hydroxide, which was further calcined to form titania nanoparticles with different particle sizes. For the composite catalysts (Scheme 1b), the TiO2 particles were evenly distributed on the RGO substrate generated by calcination in an inert atmosphere. Thus, conductive RGO serves as an electron reservoir to facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes and promote the overall POM performance (Scheme 1b).

The representative TEM image of RGT90 (Fig. 1a) shows that the particles with a d-spacing of 3.52 Å correspond to the (101) lattice fringe of anatase TiO2 (101), and a spacing of 1.89 Å is consistent with the anatase TiO2 (200) plane. The corresponding elemental maps of Ti, O, and C and their overlap (Fig. 1a) indicate that the TiO2 particles are evenly distributed on the RGO substrate.

The XRD patterns of the GO, RGO, T20 and RGTX composites are shown in Fig. 1b. The typical characteristic (111) reflection peak of GO appears at 2θ = 9.9°, corresponding to a d-spacing of 0.89 nm, which is much larger than the d-spacing of natural graphite (0.335 nm).32 This indicates that a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups greatly increase the GO layer spacing. Abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of GO are beneficial for the dispersion of GO in ethanol solutions containing titanium isopropoxide, resulting in the formation of RGTX with a uniform particle distribution. Due to the partial reduction of GO occurrence, a weak broad peak (002) attributed to the RGO catalyst was observed at 2θ = 25.36° after calcination, and the corresponding d-spacing was 0.351 nm, which was close to that of conductive graphite. For the T20 catalyst, the peaks observed at 2θ = 25.31°, 36.95°, 37.84°, 38.60, 48.06°, 53.99°, 55.15°, 62.08°, 62.79°, 68.81°, 70.34°, 75.16° and 76.12° could be indexed to the (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), (211), (213), (204), (116), (220), (215) and (301) planes of anatase-phase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1271), respectively.33 Other polymorphs of TiO2, such as rutile and brookite, were not observed, indicating the pure anatase phase of the as-prepared T20.34 The RGTX catalysts exhibited diffraction peaks similar to those of T20, implying that the addition of GO did not affect the structure and phase composition of TiO2. However, the most intense peak of anatase TiO2 (101) in RGTX overlapped with that of RGO (002).35–37 Furthermore, the average particle sizes of titania particles in the composite catalysts were calculated by employing the Scherrer equation on the basis of the anatase (200) peak of T20 and RGTX at 20.9 nm (T20), 19.3 nm (RGT20), 17.6 nm (RGT30), 16.7 nm (RGT40), 13.1 nm (RGT50), 11.7 nm (RGT60), 10.6 nm (RGT70), 7.6 nm (RGT80) and 6.9 nm (RGT90) (Fig. S1†).38 For the T20 and RGT20 catalysts under the same hydrolysis conditions, the average particle size of the TiO2 nanoparticles decreased slightly after adding GO, suggesting that the titania particle size was mainly determined by the hydrolysis rate of the titanium precursor. For the serial RGTX catalysts, the average particle sizes of the TiO2 nanoparticles decreased almost linearly with increasing water temperature, and RGT90 had titania particles of the smallest size. That is, the highest water vapor content in the high-temperature water accelerated the hydrolysis and nucleation of the titanium precursor, resulting in the smallest titanium hydroxide intermediate and TiO2 end-particles. Furthermore, the intensity of all TiO2 peaks decreased gradually with increasing water temperature, implying lower crystallinity, smaller particles and more defects in the TiO2 particles. It has been reported that the defect density of metal oxide surfaces increases with decreasing particle size within a certain threshold.39 Defects, especially O-vacancy defects derived from the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, as highly active sites have been frequently reported in various photocatalysts.36,40,41
Oxygen vacancy analysis
The detailed structures of individual components in the RGTX composites were further investigated by Raman spectroscopy. As displayed in Fig. 1b, the Raman spectra of T20 and RGTX below 1000 cm−1 exhibit a sharp peak at ∼160 cm−1 and broad peaks at ∼410, ∼530 and ∼660 cm−1, which can be attributed to the characteristic Ti(IV)–O bond vibration modes Eg(1), B1g, A1g and Eg(2), respectively.42,43 The blank catalyst T20 gave rise to Raman peaks at 159.9 (Eg(1)), 413.6 (B1g), 530.9 (A1g) and 658.1 cm−1 (Eg(2)), which all originated from typical anatase TiO2, consistent with the XRD results. Compared to T20, the Eg(1) mode of RGT20 was observed at 160.5 cm−1 with an obvious redshift and peak broadening, which could be caused by the interaction between RGO and TiO2.44 Further inspection (Fig. 1c) reveals that the Eg(1) peaks gradually redshifted and broadened with decreasing particle size. Smaller nanoparticles induce phonon confinement, resulting in an increase in localized defects and lattice disorder (nonstoichiometric TiO2), i.e., Ti3+ and surface O-vacancies.45–49 RGT90 has the highest content of O-vacancies and the most redshifted Eg(1) peak.
In addition, the Raman spectra of both GO and RGO showed two characteristic peaks, namely, the D band at 1356 cm−1 and the G band at 1599 cm−1. The D band corresponds to a breathing mode of k-point phonons with A1g symmetry, which is a common feature of sp3 carbon and is usually associated with structural defects, such as edges and amorphous carbon. The G band is attributed to the first-order scattering of the E2g mode observed in sp2 carbon domains.50 Compared with those in the spectra of GO and RGO, both the D band and G band peak positions in the spectrum of RGTX show blueshifts of 13 and 17 cm−1, respectively, also implying strong interactions between titania particles and the substrate (Fig. 1c). In general, the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) is a criterion for disorder defects in carbon-containing catalysts. All the RGTX catalysts displayed higher ID/IG ratios than GO and RGO (Fig. S2†), suggesting that more sp3 defects were induced by the titania particles in the composites.51 The same titania loading amount enabled the defects contained in the composites to be maintained at a similar constant level.
To further verify the lattice disorder or defects of titania, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were used. The EPR spectra of all the catalysts (Fig. 1d) show evidence of O-vacancies with strong symmetric resonance peaks centered at g = 2.003, which originate from single-electron-trapped titania O-vacancies.52 The bare T20 gave rise to an obvious O-vacancy-related peak, implying the formation of titania O-vacancies by calcination in an inert atmosphere. Moreover, the intensity of the EPR signal in RGT20 is more intense than that of T20, indicating that the density of titania O-vacancies increases by virtue of the interaction with the RGO substrate. With decreasing titania size, the RGTX composites show increasing EPR signals, and RGT90 possesses the most intense EPR signal, implying that most titania O-vacancies are formed in RGT90.
The surface electronic states of the T20 and RGTX catalysts were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Ti 2p peaks of T20 and RGTX were unsymmetrical and could be deconvoluted into four subpeaks located at 458.3, 458.9, 463.8, and 464.3 eV, corresponding to Ti3+ 2p3/2, Ti4+ 2p3/2, Ti3+ 2p1/2 and Ti4+ 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. S3a†). It is known that Ti3+ defect sites are caused by electron transfer for electrostatic balance from O-vacancies to adjacent Ti4+, i.e., Ti4+ can be reduced to Ti3+ by trapping electrons from O-vacancies. Thus, the existence of O-vacancies is associated with Ti3+ species.53 With decreasing particle size, the Ti 2p peaks of titania in the RGTX composites shift positively, implying the presence of fewer oxygen atoms in the vicinity of Ti.54,55 Furthermore, the Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio can be used to evaluate the surface O-vacancies of the catalysts. The Ti3+/Ti4+ ratios of RGTX composites (Fig. S3b†) increase with decreasing titania size in the catalysts, implying an increasing concentration of surface O-vacancies, indicating a similar tendency to those of the EPR and Raman results.
Band structure characterization
The adsorption edges and band structures of the T20 and RGTX catalysts were studied by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS). As displayed in Fig. 1f, all catalysts exhibited strong absorption in the UV region. T20 showed inferior visible light absorption ability, with a threshold of approximately 400 nm owing to the inherent wide band gap of TiO2.38 All the RGTX catalysts exhibited extended absorption in the range of 400–700 nm attributed to the combined modulation of abundant O-vacancies and RGO.56,57 In particular, RGO doping was the main contribution to the enhanced visible absorption.57 Actually, the introduction of RGO into TiO2 generates hybrid energy levels above the valence band edge, thus decreasing the optical absorption band gap and resulting in less input energy involved in the excitation of charge carriers.58 O-vacancies could modify the electronic structure of TiO2 by introducing defect states below the conduction band bottom and narrowing the band gaps to better match the solar spectrum.59,60 According to the Kubelka–Munk function, the estimated corresponding band gap (Eg) can be calculated from the different Tauc plots of (αhν)1/2versus photon energy.61,62 Tauc plots (inset in Fig. 1f) based on DRS absorption edges show that the band gaps are sharply narrowed from 3.03 eV for T20 to 2.75 eV for RGT20. After that, lower band gap values were observed with gradual decreases from 2.69 eV (RGT30) to 2.67 eV (RGT40), 2.58 eV (RGT50), 2.53 eV (RGT60) and 2.43 eV (RGT70) and further decreases to 2.07 eV (RGT80) and 2.03 eV (RGT90), which is attributed to the modification of O-vacancies.59,60 Thus, regulated band gap values have been realized, and RGT90 possesses the narrowest band gap (2.03 eV), which favors the light harvesting of RGT90. Mott–Schottky tests were conducted to further approximately estimate the conduction band positions of catalysts, which determine the band structure alignments together with the DRS optical bandgaps.63,64 As shown in Figs. S4a, b and c,† the estimated flat band potentials were −0.40, −0.33 and −0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl, corresponding to the conduction band potentials (ECB) of −0.20, −0.13 and −0.02 V vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode), over the three catalysts T20, RGT20 and RGT90, respectively. Thus, the valence band potentials (EVB) of three catalysts were obtained by subtracting ECB from Eg, and were found to be +2.83 V (T20), +2.62 V (RGT20), and +2.01 V (RGT90), respectively. This implies that hVB+ on the VB levels could oxidize water to produce ˙OH radicals as EVB values of all three catalysts were more positive than the redox potential of OH−/˙OH (+1.99 V vs. NHE), in agreement with previous reports.65,66
Carrier behavior evaluation
The photoinduced charge carrier behaviors of the catalysts were investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. All PL spectra of the T20 and RGTX catalysts (Fig. S5†) show two characteristic peaks at 470 and 530 nm, corresponding to the band gap transition and intrinsic O-vacancy defects of TiO2, respectively. Bare T20 demonstrates extremely high PL intensity, suggesting the rapid recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs (eCB−–hVB+).67 In RGO-modified composite catalysts, significant and successive PL signal quenching is realized, implying that the RGO component provides a new way to separate and migrate charge carriers by regulating the electronic structures of titania. Because the Fermi level of RGO is more positive than the conduction band of TiO2,68 the photogenerated electrons in the TiO2 conduction band tend to be injected into RGO, which acts as an electron reservoir for accepting photogenerated electrons. The high electrical conductivity of RGO enables these electrons to transport in two-dimensional π-conjugation structures, i.e., π–π-conjugated substrates of RGO sheets rather than recombination with holes in the titania valence band.69 These results indicate that the increase in donor density coupled with the intermediate energy level efficiently facilitated the separation and transportation of photoexcited eCB−–hVB+ pairs.70 Consequently, the lifetimes of charge carriers are prolonged, i.e., more holes and electrons participate in CH4 oxidation and H2O reduction, hence leading to the enhancement of C–C coupling at O-vacancy active sites in photocatalytic methane conversion.
Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to study the charge transfer behaviors of the T20 and RGTX catalysts, and their impedance spectra in the complex plane (Nyquist plot) are presented in Fig. S6.† Compared to T20, RGTX composites possess significantly reduced resistance of charge transfer (Rct), implying that the presence of RGO improves the composite charge transfer capability. Then, the Rct values further decreased gradually with decreasing titania size, and RGT90 exhibits the smallest Rct (128 Ω cm2), implying the best capability of suppressing charge recombination.
The higher transfer efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in RGT90 was also confirmed by the photocurrent responses shown in Fig. S7.† The photocurrent density of RGT90 is approximately 29.5 μA cm−2, which is larger than that of RGT80 (22.3 μA cm−2) and those of the other composites (less than 9.11 μA cm−2). These data adequately prove that RGT90 can efficiently promote photogenerated charge mobility, thus leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance.
Photocatalytic activity assessment
Photocatalytic methane oxidation reactions were conducted over the catalysts under simulated sunlight irradiation. For blank RGO, no product of the CH4 photooxidation reaction was detected (Table S3†). In contrast, over the T20 and RGTX catalysts, C2 products (aldehyde and ethanol) and C3 products (acetone and propanal) were detected reproducibly in addition to C1 products (methanol and CO) under simulated sunlight irradiation (Fig. 2a), indicating that titania particles are crucial active components of POM. Trace amounts of ethylene and ethane were also observed over T20 and RGTX. The selectivity of C1 products was 27% over T20 and decreased to 17% when the titania particles were supported on RGO, i.e., RGT20. As the titania particle size decreased, the C1 product selectivity decreased in a stepwise manner to 11% (RGT30), 10% (RGT40), 7% (RGT50), and 5% (RGT60 and RGT70) and then further decreased to 3% (RGT80). RGT90 showed the lowest C1 product selectivity of less than 3%. In contrast, the C2 and C3 product selectivities of T20 to RGT90 exhibited an increasing tendency. These results demonstrate that the O-vacancy concentration in TiO2 particles plays an important role in the formation of products containing C–C bonds.

(d) EPR spectra over T20, RGT20 and RGT90 in the dark, under light irradiation for 5 min in water or under light irradiation for 5 min in water containing CH4, where DMPO was added to the reaction mixture as the radical trapping agent. Signals marked with burgundy solid diamonds are attributed to the DMPO–˙OH adduct (aN = aH = 1.49 mT); signals marked with grass-green solid squares are attributed to the DMPO–˙CH3 adduct (aN = 2.30 mT, aH = 1.56 mT); aN and aH are the hyperfine coupling constants of N and H atoms. 
On the other hand, the product yields over the T20 and RGTX catalysts showed significant variation different from the product selectivity. The product yields slightly increased from T20 to RGT30 and then rapidly increased from RGT40 to RGT90 (Fig. 2b). In particular, the aldehyde and acetone yields gradually increased from 33.1 and 15.9 μmol gcat−1 h−1 (RGT20) to 37.9 and 16.8 μmol gcat−1 h−1 (RGT30) and to 50.9 and 22.8 μmol gcat−1 h−1 (RGT40) and then quickly increased to 80.0 and 58.5 μmol gcat−1 h−1 (RGT50), 117.3 and 69.5 μmol gcat−1 h−1 (RGT60), 141.4 and 73.1 μmol gcat−1 h−1 (RGT70), 209.5 and 114.9 μmol gcat−1 h−1 (RGT80), and 289.6 and 191.2 μmol gcat−1 h−1 (RGT90). Among all the composite catalysts, RGT90 possesses the best performance of POM, with a total multicarbon product yield as high as 558.9 μmol gcat−1 h−1 and a selectivity greater than 97%, which was also confirmed by off-line NMR measurements (Fig. S8†). Furthermore, trace amounts of ethane and ethylene were detected (Table S4†), and the production of acid products formic acid and acetic acid was negligible (Fig. S9†). In addition, the above products containing C are from half reactions of oxidation driven by photoexcited holes, and the matching half reaction of reduction by photoexcited electrons generates H2, which was also measured by online GC. The yield of H2 was synchronous with the total yield of oxidation products (Fig. S10†), implying the occurrence of redox reactions in pairs.
The stability of RGT90 was evaluated by circulation experiments under simulated sunlight irradiation over six consecutive cycles. All product yields over RGT90 remained basically constant, and no obvious decline occurred after six recycles (Fig. 2c), indicating the high stability of POM.
Titania particles with substantial O-vacancy defects can convert methane to multicarbon oxygenates, but their efficiencies are too low due to intrinsic shortcomings, including insufficient light absorption and photoexcited carrier recombination. By virtue of RGO, the TiO2 particles in the RGTX composites possessed more O-vacancy active sites and promoted band gap structures, and electron–hole recombination was also substantially alleviated. As a result, the RGTX composites exhibited improved POM performance; in particular, RGT90 exhibited the highest activity and selectivity of multicarbon products, benefitting from the highest O-vacancy concentration and uniform titania-RGO distribution in RGT90. Dispersion of the TiO2 particles on RGO enabled the synergistic effects induced by the interfacial interaction of anatase TiO2 with the RGO substrate, resulting in high-concentration O-vacancies in small titania particles, and this synergy resulted in improved visible light harvesting ability and the accelerated separation of eCB−–hVB+. Specifically, doping TiO2 with RGO improved the light harvesting ability of TiO2 by narrowing the band gap and extending the light absorption in the visible light region, which can reduce the energy for the valence band to the conduction band electronic transition; thus, a higher population of eCB−–hVB+ pairs was excited.
Radical photoreaction study
Radical reactions of water and methane molecules were further studied by EPR with the radical spin-trapped reagent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). As shown in Fig. 2d, no EPR signal was detected by DMPO with H2O in the dark over the three catalysts T20, RGT20 and RGT90. When DMPO with H2O was exposed to light irradiation, distinct DMPO-EPR quadruple signals appeared over the three catalysts, with intensities in the order of RGT90 > RGT20 > T20. These signals were attributed to DMPO–˙OH adducts with a characteristic peak intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1, indicating the formation of ˙OH radicals (aN = aH = 1.49 mT).8 Upon further introducing CH4, the newly emerging signals of the sextet pattern might be attributed to ˙CH3 radicals (aN = 2.30 mT; aH = 1.56 mT), and the signal intensity order of both DMPO–˙OH and DMPO–˙CH3 adducts over the three catalysts was RGT90 > RGT20 > T20.8
These results suggest that POM is based on free radical reactions and is involved in the first H2O oxidation to ˙OH radicals and the subsequent CH4 activation to ˙CH3 radicals at O-vacancy sites of titania. That is, photocatalytic reactions between water and holes at active O-vacancy sites initiate the formation of oxidative species hydroxyl radicals ˙OH, which then attack CH4 to produce ˙CH3. Thus, the key C–H activation for direct methane conversion is fulfilled.9
In addition, the as-formed ˙CH3 radicals undergo coupling to generate ethane and attack by ˙OH to form methylene radicals (˙CH2), which further couple to generate ethylene.71,72 However, the probability of these steps involving two free radical (˙CH3 or ˙CH2) reactions is extremely low, as evidenced by the trace output of ethane and ethylene (Table S4†). Notably, CH3OH, derived from the coupling of ˙CH3 with ˙OH, is the most common product of POM and was further photooxidized by ˙OH to produce CO, resulting in CH3OH and CO as minor products.15 Interestingly, the formation of C2 and even C3 products is predominant over both T20 and RGTX, implying that O-vacancy active sites of titania catalysts also play a key role in the formation of multicarbon oxygenates.
Computational DFT studies
DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the mechanisms of methane oxidation into C2H5OH, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 on the TiO2(101) surface and O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface (Fig. S11†). Here, we focus on two key steps: (1) H abstraction of CH4 to form ˙CH3 radicals. (2) Chain growth reactions to form C2H5OH, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3.
It is considered that H abstraction of CH4 should proceed via a radical mechanism, including the direct C–H dissociation mechanism and surface OH-assisted dissociation mechanism, as there was too much water vapor in the system. The structures of the elementary steps of H abstraction of CH4 through direct and OH-assisted mechanisms are shown in Fig. S12 and S13.† This confirms that the reaction energy barrier of H abstraction of CH4 by oxygen atoms on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface is considerably lower than that of the defectless TiO2(101) surface. The activation energies of CH4 direct dissociation are 1.87 eV and 1.62 eV on the TiO2(101) and O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surfaces, respectively. This result means that dissociation of CH4 is thermodynamically more favorable in the presence of O-vacancies. We further explored the calculated barriers for the OH-assisted dissociation mechanism to ˙CH3 radicals and H2O. The calculated barriers are 0.21 eV and 2.42 eV on TiO2(101) and O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surfaces, respectively. In this case, OH* participated in the reaction as the actual O-provider and enabled direct H abstraction of CH4 with a much lower barrier on the defectless TiO2(101) surface and a higher barrier for the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface. The barrier difference is due to the difference in OH adsorption, and the calculated adsorption energies for OH adsorption on defectless TiO2(101) surfaces and O-vacancy/TiO2(101) are −1.16 eV and −4.72 eV, respectively (Table S2†). The defectless TiO2 with a H abstraction reaction energy as low as 0.21 eV showed a higher activity for the initial C–H breakage (Fig. S12†), but the further C–C coupling of the intermediates became difficult over the defectless TiO2 due to the absence of active sites. In contrast, although the strong adsorption of OH affected C–H activation to some degree (Fig. S13†), O-vacancy active sites in defective TiO2 facilitated the key intermediate CO* coupling to produce multicarbon products (Fig. 3d and e). Consequently, defective TiO2 with sufficient O-vacancies possessed much higher photocatalytic activity to produce multicarbon oxygenates compared with defectless TiO2.

The methyl radicals generated from the C–H direct dissociation mechanism and surface OH-assisted dissociation mechanism then combine with ˙OH to form CH3OH was thermodynamically favorable. According to the DFT calculations, the very negative ΔG(CH3OH) value (−2.63 eV) means that the product CH3OH was generated by coupling the ˙CH3 radical with the ˙OH radical derived from the photooxidation of H2O. In other words, under an atmosphere of water, once CH4 was activated by irradiated photocatalysts at the initial reaction stage, CH3OH formed quickly, which is in accordance with the experimental results, while without water, no product was found (Table S3†). After the formation of CH3OH, another product of CO* can be produced from the further photooxidation of CH3OH by ˙OH radicals. The proposed path for CO* generation goes through in the sequence of CH3OH* → CH3O* → CH2O* → CHO* → CO*. The adsorption energies of C1 oxygenates on the TiO2(101) surface and O-vacancy/TiO2(101) are listed in Table S2.† The energetic pathways for the formation of CO* on the TiO2(101) surface and O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface were examined by DFT calculations, and the free energy diagrams are illustrated in Fig. S14.† The free energy changes of the optimized intermediate structures for each elementary step involved are listed in Table S5.† According to the calculations, the total free energy change for CO* production is negative on the perfect TiO2(101) surface, indicating that CO* formation from CH3OH was more favorable, which was confirmed by experiments. Meanwhile, it was noticed that CO* formation on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface was not favorable; the reason was also the stronger stability of OH adsorption on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface (Table S2†).
The formed CO* can also serve as a key surface reaction intermediate of C2+ oxygenates. Once there is enough CO* in the system, surface-adsorbed CO* can successively dimerize to COCO* and then undergo hydrogenation to CH2CH3OH, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3. Actually, the appropriate adsorption of *CO on the catalyst surface is significant for the C–C coupling to produce multicarbon products. Note that the adsorption of CO* on defectless TiO2(101) was weak with an adsorption energy of −0.42 eV (versus −0.86 eV on O-vacancy/TiO2(101)) (Table S2†), which is unfavorable for C–C coupling. Because of the weakness of CO adsorption on the defectless TiO2(101) surface, the routes to generate multicarbon products were only conducted on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface. The free energy change for the overall process of CH2CH3OH, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 production was introduced to evaluate the thermodynamic selectivity. The adsorption energies of C2 and C3 intermediates on the TiO2(101) surface and O-vacancy/TiO2(101) are listed in Table S2.† According to the calculations, COCO* and other C2+ species can physically adsorb only on the TiO2(101) surface, as there is no suitable active site for COCO* reduction on the TiO2(101) surface. In contrast, the adsorption energies of all reaction intermediates involved in the CH2CH3OH, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 formation pathways on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface are all exothermic, and the five-coordinate Ti atom and four-coordinate Ti atom near the O-vacancy are the most common adsorption sites for adsorbed species (Fig. 3c and S15†). Further charge analysis shows that five-coordinate Ti atoms and four-coordinate Ti atoms near the O-vacancy are cations with Bader charges of 2.20e and 2.22e, respectively. As a result, this facilitates charge transfer from the adsorbates to the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface. Therefore, it is believed that the O-vacancy site is necessary for multicarbon oxygenate formation; in fact, the experiments showed that there are many O-vacancies during the reaction. Therefore, the TiO2(101) surface without defects is not considered in chain growth for CO* reduction.
The free energy diagrams for CO* dimerization and further reduction to CH2CH3OH, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 and the corresponding energetically favorable structures on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface are shown in Fig. S16,†3d and e. The free energy changes for each elementary step involving CH2CH3OH, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 are given in Tables S6 and S7.† The proposed path for CH3CH2OH generation proceeds in the sequence CO* → COCO* → HCOCO*/COCOH* → HCOHCO* → COCH2OH* → HCOCH2OH/COHCH2OH* → HCOHCH2OH* → CHCH2OH* → CH2CH2OH* → CH3CH2OH* → CH3CH2OH. The free energy change for most processes of CH3CH2OH production from CO* dimerization and reduction is negative, and the downhill free energy change indicates that reducing CO* to CH3CH2OH is thermodynamically favorable on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface. Based on the lowest energy pathways for CH3CH2OH* generation, the C–C coupling of two CO* species, HCOHCO*, HCOHCH2OH* and CHCH2OH* formation and CH3CH2OH* desorption are crucial for the formation of C2+ products, with free energy barriers of 0.34 eV, 0.19 eV, 0.75 eV and 0.41 eV. Therefore, for generating CH3CH2OH, the rate-determining step was the desorption of CH3CH2OH* (Fig. S12†).
The proposed path for CH3CHO generation through CH3CH2OH reduction follows the sequence of CH3CH2OH* → CH3CHOH* → CH3CHO* → CH3CHO (gas). The formed CH3CH2OH* intermediate is further reduced to CH3CHOH* and CH3CHOH*, which have ΔG values of 1.28 eV and −1.05 eV on O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surfaces, respectively. Therefore, for CH3CHO production, the rate-determining step was CH3CHOH* formation (Fig. 3d). The total free energy change for CH3CHO* formation indicates that reducing CO* to CH3CHO* is also thermodynamically favorable on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface.
As observed in Fig. 2b, acetone is considered another main product, and we also determined the formation path of CH3COCH3. The proposed path for CH3COCH3 generation followed the sequence of CO* → COCO* → COCOH* → COC* → COCH* → COCH2* → COCH3* → COCOCH3* → COHCOCH3* → CCOCH3* → CHCOCH3* → CH2COCH3* → CH3COCH3* → CH3COCH3 (gas). The CO–CO* coupling to COCO*, COHCOCH3*, CCOCH3* formation and CH3COCH3* desorption steps are energetically endothermic, with ΔG values of 0.34 eV, 0.30 eV, 1.02 eV and 1.30 eV, respectively. So, it can be found that the desorption step is the rate-determining step. DFT calculations showed that all the other elementary steps have a negative free energy change, and the downhill free energy change indicates that reducing CO* to CH3COCH3* is also thermodynamically favorable on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface.
As observed in Fig. 2b, other oxygenates, such as CH3OH, can also be produced via CO* reduction. The energy pathways for the formation of CH3OH on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface were also examined by DFT calculations, and the results are illustrated in Fig. S17.† The free energy changes of the optimized intermediate structures for each elementary step are given in Table S8.† There are four coupling pathways to form CH3OH, but only the thermodynamically favorable pathway that passes through the CHO* intermediate was selected because in this pathway, all the reaction steps are downhill in free energy on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface. Therefore, CH3OH production on the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface is feasible. The total free energy change for gas CH3OH formation was 0.34 eV, in contrast to −0.60 eV, −0.49 eV and −2.88 eV for CH3CH2OH, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 formation from CO* reduction. As a result, the formation of CH3COCH3 was faster than that of CH3CHO and CH3CH2OH because the selectivity-determining step became more energetically favorable. Moreover, CH3CHO is more energetically favorable than CH3CH2OH, while CH3OH is the least energetically favorable product among all the C1–C3 oxygenated products through CO* reduction.
Conclusions
In summary, RGO/TiO2 composite catalysts prepared by the restrained hydrolysis method exhibited the capability of efficient photocatalytic oxidation of CH4 to multicarbon products under ambient conditions. The photocatalytic activity was highly dependent on the concentration of O-vacancies, which not only enhanced the generation of electron–hole pairs and reduced their recombination but also acted as the active sites for the C–C coupling of the key intermediate CO*. The optimized composite catalyst with the highest content of O-vacancies shows the best performance for POM, with a multicarbon product yield of 558.9 μmol gcat−1 h−1 and a selectivity of over 97%. DFT calculations further demonstrated the preferred C–C coupling surface reactions on the O-vacancy sites of titania. The thermodynamically favorable chain growth routes of multicarbon product formation obey the methane–methanol–CO-oxygenate pathways. Our findings open a new avenue for the development of efficient photocatalysts for CH4 conversion.

 	Scheme 1  Schematic illustrations of (a) the preparation of RGTX composite catalysts by the restrained hydrolysis method; (b) photocatalytic CH4 conversion over RGTX under simulated sunlight.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) HR-TEM image and EDS element mapping of RGT90. (b) XRD patterns of GO, RGO, T20 and RGTX in the range of 5–80°; X = 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90, respectively. (c) Raman spectra of GO, RGO, T20 and RGTX. (d) Eg(1) peaks of T20 and RGTX along with the corresponding peak center positions. Inset: Eg(1) peak shift of T20 and RGTX. (e) EPR spectrum of T20 and RGTX. (f) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of T20 and RGTX. Inset: Tauc plots based on the DRS spectra, where [F(R)hν]1/2 is the Kubelka–Munk function for indirect-band semiconductors, and hν is photon energy.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Product selectivity and (b) yield over T20 and RGTX for POM with H2O under simulated sunlight irradiation. (c) Stability test over RGT90 for POM under simulated sunlight irradiation. (d) EPR spectra over T20, RGT20 and RGT90 in the dark, under light irradiation for 5 min in water or under light irradiation for 5 min in water containing CH4, where DMPO was added to the reaction mixture as the radical trapping agent. Signals marked with burgundy solid diamonds are attributed to the DMPO–˙OH adduct (aN = aH = 1.49 mT); signals marked with grass-green solid squares are attributed to the DMPO–˙CH3 adduct (aN = 2.30 mT, aH = 1.56 mT); aN and aH are the hyperfine coupling constants of N and H atoms.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Side view and (b) top view of the 2 × 2 supercell structure of the O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surface, and (c) the corresponding top view profile with an isosurface value of 0.01 e Å−3. Ovac denotes the twofold-coordinate O atom vacancy. The yellow and blue colors in (c) indicate the positive and negative values, respectively. Free energy diagrams calculated for the pathways of CO* reduction to (d) CH3CHO and (e) CH3COCH3 on O-vacancy/TiO2(101) surfaces. Dark gray: C; light gray: C; red: O; white: H.
