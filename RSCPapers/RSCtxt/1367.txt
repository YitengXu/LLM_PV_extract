    , Accepted 10th January 2013First published on 11th January 2013AbstractThe charging of an undivided cerium–zinc redox battery by various current waveforms some of which mimic the output of renewable energy (solar, wind, tidal, biofuel burning) to electricity transducers is considered in this work, where the battery operates through diffusion-only conditions, and is discharged galvanostatically. Under reasonable assumption, the mathematical model developed enables the observation that the performance characteristic of the cells charged with a constant power input differentiates between the various current–charge waveforms, with cell geometry and electrode kinetics playing subtle, but significant, roles; in particular, high efficiency is observed for sunlight-charged batteries which are thin and suffer no corrosion of the sacrificial electrode, and which have already experienced a charge–discharge cycle. The performance characteristics of the systems are interpreted in the light of consequences for smart grid realisation, and indicate that, for a constant power input, the most matched renewable is biofuel burning with a current output that linearly increases with time.

Broader context
The smart grid is a 21st Century electricity distribution infrastructure that is reliant on signals intelligence (COMINT and ELINT) from both electricity generation boards and consumer demand. Meeting national targets for quotas of electricity supply by renewable necessitates grid support through, inter alia, battery storage. Although many types of renewable energies (such as solar, wind and lightening bolts) are somewhat unpredictable, and dictated by weather characteristics, we treat them in this work as providing definable temporal variations in current output for battery charging. Six types of charging waveform corresponding to manifestations of solar, tidal, wind and biofuel burning are used to charge-up a cerium–zinc battery in an undivided cell to a constant power loss through Joule heating. After accounting fully for the charge and discharge of the electrical double layers at both electrodes, we observe, for a constant current discharge, that cell geometry is an important factor in matching renewable energy to energy storage in batteries, with biofuel burning to a ramped current output affording the most efficient means to energy storage. It is notable that thin cells that suffer no electrode corrosion are suited for multi-cycle solar energy storage.

1 Introduction
Energy will be increasingly consumed by end users in electrical form, necessitating the deployment of efficient and strategic routes by which it can be generated, distributed and stored.1,2 Automated information and communications intelligence will be employed at both supplier and consumer levels to improve distribution efficiency, sustainability and economics (through the promotion of competition). This “smart grid”3 will require storage systems to allow for a fluidity in energy provision through load levelling, peak shaving or energy arbitrage via differential pricing approaches, viz. in storing surplus energy generated during off-peak times, with grid support during times of high demand. Large scale redox flow batteries4 are typically used for applications requiring kW power scales, especially for uninterrupted/back-up supplies, but can be deployed for MW scale applications in transmission, grid support and load shifting. They are highly attractive and cost-effective for these applications since they are not limited to particular geographical locations, whilst being able to maintain the advantages of the rapidity of energy provision (∼1 to 10 min) through deep discharge under conditions of ambient temperature and pressure. Other forms of energy storage, such as compressed air, flywheels or pumped hydropower are mainly used for MW/GW scale bulk energy management at power stations; Stirling engines (for compressed air energy storage) rely on temperature differences and so require some form of heating/cooling, superconducting magnetic energy storage requires very low temperatures, whilst efficient storage in flywheels is limited by the maintenance of vacuum conditions.5 On the other hand, redox batteries are closed loop systems not limited by the availability of any fuel source and require no external input (except electricity), making them suitable for underground installation,6a or even for use in electric vehicles.6b,c
Although flow battery systems have been quoted4c to have energy efficiencies (ratio of energy generated during discharge to energy utilised for charging) of 70–90%, the pumping of the electrolyte consumes ∼10 to 15%, so that practical energy efficiencies are closer to 60%. Nevertheless, several installations utilising redox flow batteries already exist, such as the ZBB Energy Corp zinc–bromine system utilised at military bases, or for elevator back-up at NIDON Clean Energy, Hawai, USA,7a and Cellenium's vanadium redox battery system operational since December, 2008 in Thailand.7b The integration of battery-stored energies into electricity grids requires infrastructure capable of managing the direct currents (DC) generated by batteries. This is not such a major issue as it first appears, given the requirements of modern technology devices (such as computers, mobile accessories, etc.) which utilise DC and the development of DC microgrids,8 coupled with advances in invertors, high power semiconductor thyristors and insulated gate bipolar transistors. In addition DC may play a more prominent role in transmission in future; although alternating current (AC) won the so-called “Current Wars”, high voltage DC (HVDC) is considered to be more economical for transmission over long distances (especially underwater), whilst suffering lower electrical losses, even though it requires a single point of origin and termination.2 Such long distances typically occur between areas of renewable energy availability (for electricity generation) and regions of human civilisation (for electricity consumption).2 This is exemplified through the Xianjiaba Dam to Shanghai, China line commissioned in 2010 (which operates at 800 kV – approximately the upper DC limit due to corona discharge, delivering 6.4 GW over 1980 km),9 the Rio Madeira link soon to be commissioned between Porto Velho (Amazonas) and Araraquara (São Paulo State), Brazil (to operate at 600 kV so as to deliver 3.15 GW power over in excess of 2300 km) – the World's longest HVDC line,9 and the East West Interconnector from County Dublin to close to Liverpool, connecting the Irish grid with the UK grid (200 kV at 500 MW, with 75 km underground and 186 km submarine cabling), allowing excess wind power generated in Ireland to be exported to the UK.9
Efficient storage of renewable energies requires sufficient capability to adapt to the uncertainties in the weather characteristics (which may last from seconds to days).2 Tidal devices are naturally affected by highly predictable daily, and also seasonal, temporal variations in the tides that rise and ebb periodically based on Moon–Earth–Sun gravitational interactions. On days with varying cloud, daytime solar may vary by up to 70% maximum output on timescales of seconds. Wind varies in intensity over a matter of hours but again with superimposed seasonal cycles. Existing installations of redox batteries coupled to solar and/or wind demonstrate their practical application in conjunction with these energy technologies. Examples include the all-vanadium system installed by Prudent Energy10a or Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd10b (who commissioned the world's largest redox flow battery in July, 2012), or the zinc–bromine system developed by RedFlow, Ltd.10c
However, the overall efficiency of this electrical energy storage through charging galvanic cells is known to be determined by its amount and the time-dependent characteristics and hence will be affected by the type of renewable energy generation to which it is coupled. The importance of this relationship is often underestimated in comparing storage techniques for renewable energies, and we seek to unravel its significance in this work.
We first develop an understanding of the DC current generation characteristics of biofuel burning/wind, tidal and solar power (see the cartoon in Fig. 1 and the waveforms in Fig. 2), and of the use of these to control the single-cycle charging of a cerium–zinc redox battery system pioneered by the now defunct Plurion, Ltd.11 This cell chemistry has recently been shown to exhibit promising operational characteristics within a membrane-free (undivided) cell,11d and, hitherto, no mathematical model has been offered to simulate its chemistry.4,12 Such cells, though not employed in any large scale system as yet, are highly attractive, given the extent of power loss (i2R) through costly separating membranes (of typical electrical resistances between 1–10 Ω cm−2) that are generally employed. They also preclude the otherwise necessary consideration of junction potentials that occur as a result of ion flux through the membrane.
 Fig. 1  Cartoon illustrating the approach taken in this work: solar, wind or tidal power is generated and used to charge-up a cerium–zinc redox battery, with the latter used to power cities. The rectifier/selector system also contains invertors to reconvert the battery DC output into AC. Note that for the tidal power case, we have chosen to depict the oscillating hydrofoils pioneered by Pulse Tidal (http://www.pulsetidal.com; accessed 1 August 2012) which sweep up and down, as demonstrated within the River Humber, Hull. Also illustrated is the electrical circuit equivalent of the battery system.

Note that the rectified AC signal is illustrated here at an exaggerated frequency (0.5 Hz) than that used in simulations (50 Hz), so that the nature of its waveshape is seen. 
2 Diffusion model for battery charge and discharge
2.1 Classification of renewable energy current generation characteristics
Whilst battery systems require DC for charging, owing to the occurrence of Faradaic electrolysis, of the renewable energies considered here, only solar photovoltaic or the less popular photogalvanic systems immediately and exclusively provide a DC output; the others rely on the induction of current through conductor motion within a magnetic field – turbine generation, which affords AC in the armature, or DC (if subsequently rectified, or through the use of split-ring commutators). Bearing this in mind, we may classify individual renewable energies through their characteristic profiles for power generation, as has very recently been undertaken by Aziz.13 However, these are directly related to the temporal variations of their impact on a turbine.14 In an approximately twelve hour day period, biofuel burning can be made to achieve a constant current output, or, if so desired, an output that could change with time; wind, if present due to a land-sea breeze, is variable about a constant level; tidal current output varies in a sinusoidal manner on a diurnal (24 h) or semidiurnal timescale. Even solar power generation is time-dependent owing to its dependence on light intensity; clear sky (AM 1.5) days at the Equator afford a semi-elliptical power generation rate, peaking at 12H00, followed by a resting state. It follows that, if our idealised renewable energy–power generator operates on a windy, clear day at a tidal barrage near the Equator, the battery charging current is of a form characteristic of the energy exploited.
The formulation of equations for these current outputs for our purposes, however, causes a quandary in consideration of whether it is the total power of the generated current or the state-of-charge of the battery system that should be constant for the comparison of these waveforms. We chose to ensure that the root mean square charging current, viz., is identical for each type of current waveshape; by definition, this ensures that the heat dissipated through Ohmic loss within the system (Joule heating15) is then constant for all considered waveforms, and allows for simplicity in that it is only the total energy that needs to be considered; we ignore thermal energy loss in discharge as well as charge in this work.
Thus, for daytime generation, we may consider six types of battery charging waveform, noting that more complex waveforms (to account for rectified AC variation) may be constructed from these, through linear superimposition. These six forms are constant DC, ramp, cyclic elliptical (in current or time), sinusoidal and a single-cycle rectified sine wave, and they are represented in Fig. 2 and below. Note that we operate within a reduced timescale – one real time day (24 h) maps to 20 s in this work (vide infra).
Pure, constant DC (biofuel burning at a constant output, or constant wind; no AC variation) (1)
DC ramp (linear increase in current output from biofuel burning; no AC variation) (2)
DC accelerator–decelerator (symmetrical increase and decrease via variable output in biofuel burning; no AC variation) (3)
Fully rectified AC at 50 Hz with a constant DC offset (constant wind or constant output of biofuel burning) (4)
Rectified tidal; no superimposed AC variation (5)
Solar (6)
In the above, i is the current, i0 is the background level (taken to be zero in this work), A is then the maximum current carried through a pure, constant DC supply (taken to be −30 mA in this work, where charging currents are negative), t is the time variation, and ts is the half-time period (kept at 5.0 s in this work, so that diffusive mass transport in the battery may only be considered; the occurrence of natural convection is precluded through the imposition of this limitation16). Also given above is the charge passed during the charging cycle when , where it is clear that the state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery decreases with the waveforms illustrated in Fig. 2 in the order constant DC > solar > tidal = rectified AC > DC ramp > DC accelerator–decelerator. We model discharge as occurring immediately after charging, primarily so that there is no additional contribution from electrode corrosion (vide infra), and occurring under a constant DC load (current, with no reactive power), as we wish to study the performance of the system under light and heavy drain.
2.2 Evaluation of the battery performance with the renewable energy waveforms
We are interested in determining which of the renewable energy waveforms in Fig. 2 when used for charging the galvanic cell described in Fig. 1 yields efficient energy storage, high power characteristics of the battery under discharge, and a reasonable characteristic time (order of magnitude of the energy:power ratio). For the first of these figures of merit, for conditions of constant current in discharge, we consider the energy loss ratio (ELR) defined as the ratio between the energy generated under cell discharge and the energy used for cell charging: (7)
The other two depend on the position of the system under discharge within the energy–power plane (Ragone plot).17 However, it is important to encompass effects due to the variable SOC with change in the charging waveform; we define the SOC as the ratio of the charge passed during cell charging to the total possible charge that could be passed during charging, viz. for the system considered in this work (vide infra).
As the renewable energy waveforms depend on the time passed, as indicated in eqn (1)–(6), experimental data need to be analysed within the temporal domain; for a constant current discharge to a cut-off time, tdischarge, (8) (9)
Hence, for performance evaluation purposes, we normalise the energy and power characteristics in eqn (8) and (9) with those expected from an ideal battery, viz. one which exhibits no frequency-dependent response and no non-linear responses due to Faradaic or pseudocapacitative contributions (outlined in ESI 1†). Thus, an adimensional Ragone plot may be constructed with  on the ordinate and  on the abscissa, or vice versa.
We next describe how these parameters may be determined through knowledge of the battery chemistry.
2.3 Model for an undivided galvanic cell
For a storage system, we have chosen to employ a zinc–cerium hybrid redox battery operated under diffusion-only conditions, for simplicity – there is then no need to consider intrinsic energy losses due to pumping of the electrolyte through the cell, nor to worry about the changing thickness of the diffusion layer between the upstream and downstream edges of the electrode surface, which itself is a function of the volume flow rate. Flow batteries of this system have been demonstrated to operate under mild, ambient temperature conditions (295 K) in a fully electrochemically supported undivided cell (see Fig. 1).11d We assume that the cell electrolyte is oxygen-free (to prevent any electrode passivation through zinc oxide precipitation), and suppose that it contains additives so that the hydrogen evolution (due to proton reduction) and oxygen evolution (through water oxidation) reactions do not proceed within the cell even under the most extreme potentials generated at the electrodes. We further assume that the electrodes are perfectly flat (fractal dimension of exactly 2.0), allowing heterogeneous electron transfer reactions to proceed uniformly on the electrode surface, and so that there is no dendrite formation on the electrode surfaces. These assumptions allow the surface area of the electrodes in contact with the electrolyte to be constant throughout the electrolysis. Note that other models for hydrogen or oxygen evolution within redox batteries command a similar assumption, viz. the Laplace pressure is sufficiently small to prevent bubble formation.12 The galvanic cell can thus be written through the following cell diagram.  
Note that the above concentrations are experimentally realistic for flow batteries,11 with an initial concentration of Ce4+ ions set at three orders of magnitude higher than that typically used for “ion-free” conditions,18 to ensure full stability of the numerical simulations employed herein (vide infra). Furthermore, for the charging reactions, the vast excess of Zn2+ compared with Ce3+ ensures the latter is the limiting reagent.
We define the planar electrode, parallel-plate battery system schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 using a single spatial co-ordinate (x) set so that the carbon surface facing the solution is at x = 0, with the electrolyte-exposed zinc surface at x = . The electrolyte used in realised experimental systems consists mainly of aqueous methanesulfonic acid of high concentration (typically between 4 and 6 M) to suppress electrical migration of the redox species and reduce the electrical resistance (Rs) between the electrode plates.11 This additionally sets up electrical double layers of capacitance Cdl1 and Cdl2 at each electrode which need to be charged and discharged with change in the voltage in time (vide infra) in parallel with the redox reaction at each electrode (see Fig. 1). We assume there are no parasitic reactions (other than those considered below) causing leakage or shunt currents to occur in parallel to the load resistances.

2.3.1 Cell chemistry. 
Thus, at open circuit (no current flowing, no power delivered), we may write down the following potential-determining equilibria.
Right-hand electrode: (A)
Left-hand electrode: (B)
Note that these half-cell reactions are idealistic; we assume that all activity coefficients are unity, so that the formal potentials quoted correspond to standard electrode potentials against the standard hydrogen scale (SHE). A more detailed discussion of these half-cell processes is given in ESI 2.†19–22 Note that no other Faradaic processes are assumed to occur, and that zinc deposition is assumed to be uniform and to proceed such that the cell thickness does not change with time (q.v. ESI 2†).
Although we are interested in the energy storage efficiency of the particular charging waveform, we note that most experimental systems involve the plating of zinc onto carbon during charge, and are thus limited by zinc dissolution under discharge.11 Thus, rather than assuming that the zinc electrode is physically thick, viz. with a surface coverage, ΓZn, inflated by some large factor over its monolayer value, we set the surface coverage to take the typical monolayer23 value of 10−10 mol cm−2, and employ a bulk stripping boundary condition (vide infra).
Thus, the cell reaction occurring under short circuit is Ce4+(aq.) + ½Zn(s) → Ce3+(aq.) + ½Zn2+(aq.)(C)viz. the right-hand electrode becomes positive relative to that at the left-hand side, in a thermodynamically spontaneous process; the observed open circuit voltage under non-standard conditions is: (10)where the potential of the right-hand electrode of the cell diagram, (11)and the potential of the left-hand electrode, (12)are Nernstian expressions, cs is the standard concentration (1.0 M), R is the molar gas constant, T is the absolute temperature (taken to be 298 K in this work), F is Faraday's constant and (13)


2.3.2 Open circuit corrosion of the zinc electrode. 
Since the corrosion rate for zinc in acidic solutions of pH < 3 is low, typically18 ∼40 mm per year, as a result of kinetic limitations (vide supra), we suppose zinc dissolution with hydrogen evolution to be negligible. However, it is well known24 that, at least in brine, Ce3+ suppresses corrosion of zinc, whilst Ce4+ stimulates it. Thus, for the case of our undivided cell where there is a comparatively tiny, but finite, amount of Ce4+ present initially (else cell potentials would tend to −∞, a value that is impossible to use in numerical simulations), the open circuit voltage will not be given by the Nernst expression owing to the occurrence of generation and depletion conditions at the zinc electrode, due to the spontaneous heterogeneous reaction: Ce4+(aq.) + ½Zn(s) → Ce3+(aq.) + ½Zn2+(aq.)(D)
The effect of this is to alter the concentration profiles of Ce3+, Ce4+ and Zn2+ within the cell, and thus impact on the charge–discharge characteristics of the cell.
ESI 3† illustrates how the corrosive mixed-potentials may be calculated at open circuit, under the assumption of a Butler–Volmer formalism25 for the electrode kinetics. Note that we define the corrosive reaction (Ce4+ reduction on zinc) as occurring with standard heterogeneous rate constant ks3 and with α3 the associated symmetry factor. We are interested in two limiting cases : (i) ks3 = 0 cm s−1, corresponding to no corrosion of the zinc electrode, so that its potential is as given in Section 2.3.1, and (ii) ks3 = ks and α3 = α – the kinetics of cerium(IV) reduction on zinc are commensurate with those at the carbon electrode. For the experimental conditions given, these cases correspond to instantaneous initial open circuit voltages of (i) +2.04 V and (ii) +1.60 V, respectively; the occurrence of corrosion reduces the open circuit voltage (Voc), as anticipated.


2.3.3 Cell geometry. 
In the laboratory-scale experimental system developed by Walsh,11d the galvanic cell has symmetric, parallel-plate, porous electrodes of dimensions 4.5 × 2.0 × 0.5 cm, separated by 1.85 cm, with electrolyte that is flowed from, and collected by, a single reaction reservoir, at a linear flow velocity of 3.9 cm s−1. Similar values for cell dimensions and flow rate have been employed by Roberts26 in an undivided redox flow battery for solar energy storage, or for an all-chromium system. However, for the diffusion-only galvanic cell considered in this work, such values do not allow for the occurrence of effects of transport-limited electrolysis during the charge step, nor allow for corrosive generation conditions at the zinc electrode to impact on the carbon electrode under the timescale limitation imposed. Accordingly, we chose to realise a system in which the parallel-plate electrodes are assumed to be of identical area, S, separated by the fixed distance  (cell thickness), and to compute the cell depth in terms of multiples of the diffusion layer thickness of Ce3+ ions at the right-hand electrode, viz., (14)where Di is the diffusion coefficient of species i, 1 ≤ ι ≤ 10, and to keep the electrode surface area as a factor, φ, larger than that required for complete charging of the thinnest cell considered within the allocated time, using a pure, constant DC input: (15)
The above formulation was determined to be optimised, since complete electrolysis during charge would otherwise cause faster depletion of redox species at the electrode compared with mass transport, leading to cell voltages that could not be determined through numerical methods. For typical experimental values considered in this work, 40 ≤ /μm ≤ 400, with square electrodes of side 2.0 cm, corresponding to φ ≃ 2.5.


2.3.4 Transport and Faradaic currents. 
We are interested in the performance of this galvanic system under load, and thus seek a solution to the following transport equations, which describe the mass transfer resistances ROx and RRed in the equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. 1, (16) (17) (18)under the following boundary conditions, where we assume that Butler–Volmer kinetics are sufficient to describe the current dependence on the potential at each electrode (these are represented being electrically equivalent to a junction diode within the circuit diagram in Fig. 1; we recognise that were the electrode kinetics to account for the density of electronic states within the electrode through modelling via non-adiabatic Marcus–Hush theory, the electrical circuit equivalent is merely a thermionic diode). Note that, although as alluded to earlier (q.v. Section 2.1), we have not explicitly allowed for the inclusion of natural convection as a transport means; this is possible simply by allowing the individual diffusion coefficients, D, to be apparent diffusion coefficients, Dapp, which are fourth-order functions of the distance normal to the electrode surface,16 (19)in which δconv is the thickness of the convection-free layer.
Initial conditions  

During charge/discharge

Equal and opposite flux at each electrode  Equal and opposite flux at the carbon electrode under the assumption of Butler–Volmer kinetics, with zinc ions being electro-inactive,  Equal and opposite flux of cerium species at the zinc electrode with Butler–Volmer kinetics for the corrosion/deactivation processes, with the surface flux of zinc ions being set as a bulk stripping condition,  
In the above, we explicitly identify the Faradaic current as if, employ the reduced potentials  and , and keep to the convention that discharge currents are positive. The unusual formulation of the stripping condition is to account for the fact that this is the condition for the upper boundary of the simulation (q.v.Fig. 1). Note that the surface condition for the sacrificial zinc anode corresponds to bulk stripping;27 as such, , so that ks2cse2(1−α2)ξ2 is set to zero when ΓZn = 0.
The occurrence of corrosion of zinc (at open circuit) coupled with the deactivation of cerium(IV) at the zinc electrode (under closed circuit conditions) within our undivided cell thus causes the three species Ce3+, Ce4+ and Zn2+ to be intimately coupled through the Neumann conditions at the zinc electrode. Accordingly, the partial differential equations are soluble using the backward implicit finite difference approach, solving first for the concentrations of species Ce3+ and Ce4+ simultaneously, using a pentadiagonal matrix algorithm (see ESI 4†), followed by solution for the concentration of Zn2+ through the use of the Thomas algorithm, using experimentally realistic values of the diffusion coefficients, viz., DCe3+ = DCe4+ = 0.5 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 and DZn2+ = 6.9 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, where the smaller value for the cerium(III)/cerium(IV) species implicitly accounts for complex formation that is thought to occur within the aqueous methanesulfonic electrolyte.11b
The calculation of the electrode potentials during the current-controlled (galvanostatic) charge/discharge processes is detailed in ESI 5.† Thus, in the absence of effects due to double layer charging or Ohmic drop, the cell voltage is: Ecell = ECe3+|Ce4+ − EZn|Zn2+(20)


2.3.5 Capacitative currents and Ohmic loss. 
The large majority of battery models for operation under galvanostatic conditions do not account for contributions due to charging or discharging of the electrical double layer present at each electrode. In order to incorporate capacitative contributions, the double layers at each of the two electrodes were treated as symmetrical series capacitors, each of capacitance17b 40 μF cm−2, so that the effective equivalent capacitance for the cell is , giving rise to (21)which, for the electrode area employed in this work, corresponds to 80 μF.
The total current passing through the cell (q.v.Fig. 1) is comprised of Faradaic (if) and capacitative (icap) contributions, by Kirchhoff's laws: i = if + icap(22)
However, both contributions are coupled through the Ohmic loss within the cell, where it is the solution resistance (Rs) that acts as the major cause of this voltage drop. This parameter is related to both the cell geometry and the nature of the supporting electrolyte, (23)where ρs is the solution resistivity. Given the average value of the supporting electrolyte concentration (∼5 M), the solution resistance is dominated by the resistivity of the methanesulfonic acid solution; at 298 K, literature data on molar conductance of this aqueous electrolyte28 afford the following relation for methanesulfonic acid concentrations, c0, in the range 0.01 ≤ c0/M ≤ 2.0, lg(ρs/Ωm) = −0.9135lg(c0/M) − 1.4575(24)with a Pearson's product–moment correlation coefficient of 0.9986. Extrapolation to 5.0 M concentrations affords ρs = 0.080 Ω m, leading to 0.8 ≤ Rs mΩ−1 ≤ 8.0 as estimates for the undivided cell geometries considered here, where we are not concerned with the development of membrane junction potentials. This leads to experimental cell time constants of 64 ≤ RsCdl/ns ≤ 640. We note that since the electrolyte is aqueous (and of assumed specific heat capacity at constant pressure, Cp = 4.18 J g−1 K−1), Joule heating of the cell  affords merely a ca. 0.1 mK temperature rise, a change which has negligible impact on the cell potentials , as anticipated (vide supra).
The strategy employed for calculating the capacitative current is given in ESI 6,† where it is readily inferred that this is an iterative protocol owing to the aforementioned coupling between Faradic and capacitative currents through the internal cell resistance. Although not examined, we note that this approach, unlike others,29 holds the advantage of allowing for potential-dependence of the capacitance to be incorporated within the simulation.


2.3.6 Short circuit current. 
At short circuit, the potentials of the two electrodes are equal: V = 0; ERHS = ELHS = Esc – there is negligible resistance in the external circuit connecting the two electrodes, allowing the maximum current, isc = iscf + isccap, to flow under any SOC, whilst delivering no workable power (q.v. Section 2.2). The instantaneous Faradaic contribution can be determined from the concentration profiles corresponding to a particular SOC of the system, and is instantaneously supplemented by the full capacitative current: (25)where Voc is the open circuit voltage across the terminals of the cell immediately prior to discharge.
It can be readily shown from the electrical equivalent circuit that the current flowing during short circuit is (26)
However, we are not interested in the time dependence of the short circuit current, nor the potential of the individual electrodes. Accordingly, we calculate the short circuit current from the solution resistance and the open circuit voltage: (27)where Voc is given by the concentration profiles immediately after cell charging through either the Nernst expression or the corrosion-corrected value, as detailed in Section 2.3.1 and Section 2.3.2, respectively.

3 Results and discussion
We consider first the results obtained in charging and discharging the cells of thin and thick depth, with and without corrosion/deactivation occurring at the zinc electrode, and subsequently evaluate the data through the performance characteristics of the discharged cell.
3.1 Cell charging
The six waveforms illustrated in Fig. 2 represent (a) battery-powered constant DC charge, (b) linear DC variation, (c) cyclic elliptical in current DC variation, (d) fully rectified AC tantamount to turbine generation through biofuel burning or constant wind, or even grid-charge, (e) rectified tidal with no AC variation and (f) solar output from a photovoltaic cell. These are described in Section 2.1 and afford cell charging waveforms as given in Fig. 3 for thin and thick cell geometries (panels a, b and c, d, respectively), where deactivation of Ce4+/zinc corrosion is both present (panels b, d) and absent (panels a, c), and affords cells of the characteristics reported in Table 2, where Voc is the instantaneous open circuit voltage observed at the end of the charging process (vide infra). Note that the equality ks3 = ks for the presence of corrosion was assumed given the paucity of literature data. The value of A chosen for the simulations (−30 mA) was taken since this value does not cause the cell potentials to tend to infinity due to transport-limited electrolysis for any cell/waveform combination (due to electrolytic consumption being faster than mass transport refreshment of Ce3+ and Zn2+). However, in the cases of the DC ramp and the DC accelerator–decelerator systems, the slow/concave variation of the current with time at short times causes any corrosive/deactivation behaviour to dominate at the zinc electrode, resulting in ΓZn → 0. For the case of the DC accelerator–decelerator waveform, the calculation could only complete if the first approximation to the electrode potential discussed in Section 2.3.4 and ESI 5† was employed, causing the cell voltage to spike until the charging current became sufficiently large for deposition conditions to be established at the zinc electrode (q.v.Fig. 3b and d).

As noted earlier, the data reported in Table 2 are for the instantaneous open circuit voltage, viz., the voltage of the cell immediately after charging. It is thus not surprising that there is very little difference in those values between thick or thin cells with/without corrosion taking place, since Faradaic electrolysis has just occurred, and the concentrations of the individual species (which governs the open circuit voltage through the Nernst equation) will pertain to that history. Accordingly, it is instructive to examine the temporal variation of the open circuit voltage. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 for all six waveforms considered, where it is seen that the open circuit voltage decreases in time for all cases, as expected – the result of the Faradaic electrolysis at each electrode is to create a concentration gradient (strictly, a gradient in chemical potential), so that the entropic mixing of species within the depletion layers will occur. For thin cells operating so that there is no corrosion of the zinc electrode, the cell thickness is comparable to the diffusion layer thickness, so that a steady open circuit voltage is expected to be established irrespective of the mode by which the cell had been charged. This is indeed observed in Fig. 4 (red traces). In contrast, non-corroding thick cells have cell thicknesses that have been set to be an order of magnitude larger than the diffusion layer thickness, a value taken in most electrochemical simulations as being essentially equivalent to semi-infinite diffusion, so that the open circuit cell voltage will decrease in time, as evidenced in Fig. 4 (black traces). Owing to the slow corrosive kinetics (ks is equivalent to ks3), the diffusive “spreading” of the species concentrations into semi-infinite space dominates the response at the thick electrodes, that is why the corrosive, thick cell traces (green lines) in Fig. 4 directly overlie those of the non-corroding thick cells (black lines). This cannot be the case for corroding thin cells, owing to the restricted space; the cell open circuit voltage is forced to dramatically decrease in time owing to the corrosion flux (blue traces in Fig. 4). Thus, in considering Fig. 4, deviations from the red line correspond to “non-ideal” scenarios, which are observed in all cases over the 10 s period at which the cell is left at open circuit, especially after ca. 5 s. However, it is evident that the corrosive extent is smaller when the cell is charged using either the DC ramp or the DC accelerator/decelerator protocols.
 Fig. 4  Variation of the cell voltage during charge (the first 10 s) and then when the cell is kept at open circuit (the second 10 s) for thin cells (red and blue traces) and thick cells (black traces and green circles) with (blue traces and green circles) and without (red and black traces) corrosion occurring at the zinc electrode, for all six charging regimes: (a) pure, constant DC, (b) DC ramp, (c) solar, (d) DC accelerator–decelerator, (e) rectified tidal and (f) fully rectified AC at a constant DC offset. See Table 1 for cell and kinetic parameters. 
In general, the charging current causes a net increase in the cell voltage compared with the initial state of the system, as expected, and is particularly influenced by the charging current gradient: the maximum in the cell voltage lags any current maximum, with the time delay being influenced by the steepness by which the current rises and falls; the cell voltage always follows the cell current, and decreases for the case of solar, tidal and DC accelerator–decelerator systems in accordance with the associated electrode boundary conditions. This effect is more highly pronounced for this latter waveform. In the case of the fully rectified AC signal, the constant charge and discharge of the electrical double layers is manifested by a greater noise in the cell voltage under charge and a loss in voltage compared with the pure, constant DC signal, even though the same trend in the voltage rise during charge is observed. The cell voltage observed for the DC ramp exhibits the most extreme behaviour, where activation, Ohmic and concentration polarisations are readily discernible. Such effects are pronounced in the time variation of the capacitative currents flowing (Fig. 5), which exhibit discontinuities at maxima and minima in the cell voltage.
 Fig. 5  Variation of the modulus of the capacitative current during cell charge: pure, constant DC (black), DC ramp (green), DC accelerator–decelerator (yellow), fully rectified AC at 50 Hz with a constant DC offset (cyan), rectified tidal (red), and solar (blue); the cell geometry was thin with (b) or without (a) corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode. 
The instantaneous open circuit voltage, current under short circuit and state-of-charge of all simulated systems are presented in Table 2. It is clear that in all cases, the SOC is less than 50% (as designed), and decreases in the order constant DC > solar > AC = tidal > DC ramp > DC accelerator–decelerator as noted in Section 2.1. However, the open circuit voltage of the charged system decreases in the order DC ramp > constant DC > solar = tidal = AC > DC accelerator–decelerator. Accordingly, the amount of electrical work done in charging the cell (note the power dissipated by heat over the full charging period, and thus the energy wasted as heat, is independent of the charging current waveform) decreases in the order constant DC > solar > tidal = AC > DC ramp > DC accelerator–decelerator, viz. commensurate with the electrical charge passed. These trends are important since they detail the amount of energy available for discharge, and are essentially independent of the cell type/conditions: the occurrence of corrosion at the zinc electrode does not manifest significantly on the immediate cell characteristics after charge. In considering the difference between thick and thin cells, we observe that the SOC is smaller in the former case, as expected. This also impacts on the short circuit current that flows, as this is proportional to the cell conductance, which is inversely proportional to the cell thickness.
For all cell geometries and electrode boundary conditions considered, the ramp, AC, constant DC, solar and tidal charging scenarios hold cell voltages which cross-over close to the maximum in the solar and tidal scenarios (typically ca. 8 s). This is quite significant, since it may suggest that, although the SOC will be lower if the charge cut-off time is reduced from 10 s to 8 s, the higher open circuit voltage that results may allow for a more efficient discharge of the cell. This is not considered within this work, since the energy lost to heat would then be different for each waveform.
3.2 Cell discharge
Cells were discharged under constant DC currents in the range 15 ≤ i/mA ≤ 50, with the constraint in cell voltage gradient as a “cut-off” imposed (q.v. Section 2.4); Fig. 6 provides a selection for both thick and thin cells. In each case, the three characteristic regions of activation, Ohmic and concentration polarisations are observable. These classical waveshapes cause a “U”-shape in the modulus of the capacitative current that is generated (Fig. 7). In all cases the cells charged with the DC accelerator–decelerator waveform are discharged most rapidly, since this reflects the SOC. However, the discharge characteristics for the other waveforms are a convolution between SOC and the open circuit voltage, for both thick and thin cells. Furthermore, it is apparent that the presence or absence of corrosion is more significant for the discharge of the thin cells rather than the thick cells: in the former, discharge is faster in the presence of corrosive deactivation; in the latter, there is no apparent difference in the discharge rates. This is as expected, since reactant cross-over can occur in the timescales considered for the thin cells only.
 Fig. 6  Variation of the cell voltage during constant current (30 mA) discharge, immediately after charge: pure, constant DC (black), DC ramp (green), DC accelerator–decelerator (yellow), fully rectified AC at 50 Hz with a constant DC offset (cyan), rectified tidal (red), and solar (blue); the cell geometry was thin (panels (a and b)) or thick (panels (c and d)), with no corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode (panels (a and c)) or with corrosion (panels (b and d)). Note that the cell was charged for the first 10 s and allowed to discharge over the next 10 s. 
 Fig. 7  Variation of the modulus of the capacitative current during cell discharge (from 10 s) after charging for the first 10 s: pure, constant DC (black), DC ramp (green), DC accelerator–decelerator (yellow), fully rectified AC at 50 Hz with a constant DC offset (cyan), rectified tidal (red), and solar (blue); the cell geometry was thin with (b) or without (a) corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode. 
We next consider the performance characteristics of the cells in the light of the figure-of-merit introduced in Section 2.2.
3.3 Performance characteristics

3.3.1 Energy loss ratio (ELR). 

Fig. 8 illustrates the variation of the ELR with discharge current for both thin (panel a) and thick (panel b) cells. In general, energy conversion efficiencies decrease with increasing drain, as expected, with the most inefficient cell (affording at most 30% efficiency in energy conversion) charged by the DC accelerator–decelerator function; the most efficient cell is a thin cell with no corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode, charged either through a constant DC current, or through a clear sky solar waveform, and discharged under a low drain (∼48% efficient). However, in general, the most efficient charging waveform is the DC ramp, since this protocol charges to a high open circuit voltage, whilst expending the second lowest amount of energy. This scenario is well known.29
 Fig. 8  Variation of the energy loss ratio with drain current for thin (a) or thick (b) cells; closed and open symbols refer to cells with or without corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode, respectively. Key: pure, constant DC (black squares), DC ramp (green inverted triangles), DC accelerator–decelerator (yellow stars), fully rectified AC at 50 Hz with a constant DC offset (cyan pentagons), rectified tidal (red triangles), and solar (blue circles). 
As anticipated from Section 3.2, there is little, if any, difference between the performance of cells in the presence or absence of corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode for thick cells (Fig. 8b). For this case, the solar, tidal and AC waveforms are approximately as efficient as each other, and deviate from the constant DC system with increasing drain. In contrast, thin cells are more efficient in energy conversion than thick cells when corrosion/deactivation is not rapid at the sacrificial electrode. Here, solar charged cells are amongst the most efficient for energy conversion at low drain, but become almost as inefficient as thin, corroding cells at high current drain. Indeed, in this limit, the most efficient cell is that charged by a DC ramp, with comparative efficiency for thin and thick cells.


3.3.2 Energy–power plane (Ragone plot) characteristics. 
Integration of the discharge curves as outlined in Section 2.2 empowers the energy (ε) and power (p) delivered under discharge; the characteristic time for all cells simulated was determined to be between 1 and 10 s, essentially varying with the SOC. Ragone plots normalised as indicated in Section 2.2 and with respect to the cell volume are illustrated in Fig. 9 for both thin (panel a) and thick (panel b) cells. The superimposition of symbols for the case of with and without corrosion in the case of Fig. 9b is expected, as are the trends in Fig. 9a, where it is clear that corrosion-free solar charged cells outperform most other cells under low power drain, with, in all cases, the DC ramp charged cell performing best under high drain.
 Fig. 9  Volume-normalised Ragone plots for thin (a) or thick (b) cells; closed and open symbols refer to cells with or without corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode, respectively. Note the difference in the scale of the ordinate axis in comparing both panels. Key: pure, constant DC (black squares), DC ramp (green inverted triangles), DC accelerator–decelerator (yellow stars), fully rectified AC at 50 Hz with a constant DC offset (cyan pentagons), rectified tidal (red triangles), and solar (blue circles). 
The normalisation of the dimensionless energy and power with cell volume highlights the nature of these “supercabatteries”:31 at a constant adimensional power, the amount of adimensional energy delivered is larger for thin cells with large electrodes, emphasising that scale-out of these systems is more important than scale-up.
In order to examine the performance of the systems over repeated charge–discharge cycles, we next examine the solar charged cell over a period of one week (corresponding to 140 s in our mapped time).

3.4 Solar charging over one week
Cells were charged and discharged over a period of seven days as indicated in Fig. 10a, assuming daytime for the first six days consisted of clear skies, with a full day solar eclipse on the seventh day, and with a variable discharge for the first five nights, with open circuit occurring for the last two nights. This particular regime was chosen to illustrate the effects of diffusion layer thickness at the electrode surface and differences in corrosion between the two extreme limits in cell geometry and electrode kinetics.
 Fig. 10  Performance characteristics of the galvanic cell under one week of solar illumination, with no work undertaken during the evenings of Day 6 and Day 7, with the morning of Day 7 having no Sun. Note that one day corresponds to 20 s in this work. (a) Current–charge and discharge characteristics. (b) Cell performance characteristics for thin (black and red) and thick (green and blue) cells in the presence (red and blue) or absence (black and green) of corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode. (c) Variation of (i) the energy used to charge-up the cell and (ii) the energy efficiency of the cell over the studied time period; key: open symbols refer to the absence of corrosion with closed symbols indicating corrosion of the zinc electrode, at thin (black and red) or thick (green and blue) cells. The data for Day 6 [in panel (ii)] and Day 7 [in panels (i) and (ii)] are not shown as no electrical work is done when the cell is at open circuit, viz. during the “night” of Day 6 and throughout the full day solar eclipse on Day 7 – a day of “rest”! Note that the absence of appearance of green traces in (b) and (c) is due to them lying immediately beneath the blue traces. 

Fig. 10b illustrates the charge–discharge curves. Note that all cut-off limits were removed for the collection of these data; the discontinuities between night discharge and day charge reflect the cases when the electrode surface concentrations tend to zero, giving rise to smaller diffusion layer thicknesses as the discharge current increases. The decrease in the open circuit voltage for thick, non-corrosive cells is understood through the diffusive mixing of material from the bulk to the surface.
Whilst the thick cells (which again do not discriminate between corrosive and non-corrosive conditions) maintain approximately a uniform characteristic over the week, with a maximum change of ca. 10% in energy required for charge (Fig. 10b) and a reasonably constant energy efficiency (Fig. 10c), thin cells only afford high energy efficiency and stability of the open circuit voltage under non-corrosive conditions. It is important to realise that both discharge conditions and cell history contribute to the energy efficiency.
4 Conclusions
In this work, we have examined the performance of various charging waveforms, some of which directly mimic a renewable energy output profile, on a redox battery operated under diffusion-only conditions, having incorporated, for the first time, the modelling of the charge and discharge of the electrical double layer capacitance that is present at electrodes immersed into electrolytic solution. We have seen that both cell geometry and electrode kinetics play important roles which are not always immediately predictable – thick cells do not discriminate between corrosive and non-corrosive boundary conditions; the energy efficiency of a cell (thin or thick) in the absence of corrosion is optimised if the cell is more concentrated in the diffusion layer than in the bulk. Moreover, for single charge–discharge experiments, we have seen that renewable energy waveforms charge cells that exhibit good performance under low drain. This is entirely in line with expectation, in the light of our earlier work on solar-rechargeable galvanic cells.32
In returning to the question posed in the title, we suggest all of the renewable energy system characteristics considered (solar, tidal, constant wind and biofuel burning) have good performance when employed for energy storage in redox batteries. The matching of renewable to redox batteries depends on the anticipated discharge load – low battery drain rates are matched with solar charged systems; higher drain rates require battery charge to be undertaken by biofuel burning with a ramped output, or a constant signal afforded by constant wind or biofuel burning (pure, constant DC). It is noteworthy that tidal charging regimes do not appear to perform as well as solar charged systems. Moreover, in comparing solar charging with that afforded by the fully rectified AC signals around a constant DC offset, which is a more realistic approach to constant wind/biofuel burning output, we note that turbine generation is almost comparable with solar charged systems. It is clear from the Ragone plots in Fig. 9 that, excluding low power drain, biofuel burning with a linearly increasing output (DC ramp) affords the greatest energy for the desired power, stressing its importance, at least, for the intermediate energy strategies. We note that this view is emphasised in a recent analysis of the potential success of the current UK renewable energy policy to meet the designated 2020 target of 15% final energy supply via renewables.33
Nevertheless, we note that storage efficiency of a particular renewable energy in redox batteries is as much a function of the cell type (geometry and electrode kinetics) as the cell discharge drain and battery charge–discharge cycle history, at least for the battery system we have considered. We emphasise that corrosion of the zinc electrode in our membrane-free cells is not particularly significant in cells which are sufficiently thick so as to exhibit a quasi-semi-infinite diffusion regime, albeit at the expense of the extent of the state-of-charge of the system. Thus, provided corrosion-free, low drainage conditions can be enforced, the use of solar energy charging of redox batteries can be made attractive; the smart grid would need to process information on weather characteristics, individual cell geometry and kinetics, cell cycle history, and power demand, since the cell discharge must match the cell type for optimised performance. This is potentially pragmatically achievable with modern computing facilities.
Last, we note that, irrespective of the charging waveform, banks of redox cells are required for any large scale system, with thinner cells providing greater volumetric energies than thick ones. This makes sense since, all other things being equal, the battery internal resistance necessarily becomes smaller with decreasing cell thickness. In translating our simulations concerning diffusion-only conditions to the convective-diffusion transport of redox flow batteries, we suggest that microfluidic redox flow batteries wired in parallel would then allow for high energy and power characteristics – allowing for the desired top right-hand corner of the energy–power playing field to be populated; this is a case for supercabatteries to play an increasingly important role for energy storage.31

Broader context
The smart grid is a 21st Century electricity distribution infrastructure that is reliant on signals intelligence (COMINT and ELINT) from both electricity generation boards and consumer demand. Meeting national targets for quotas of electricity supply by renewable necessitates grid support through, inter alia, battery storage. Although many types of renewable energies (such as solar, wind and lightening bolts) are somewhat unpredictable, and dictated by weather characteristics, we treat them in this work as providing definable temporal variations in current output for battery charging. Six types of charging waveform corresponding to manifestations of solar, tidal, wind and biofuel burning are used to charge-up a cerium–zinc battery in an undivided cell to a constant power loss through Joule heating. After accounting fully for the charge and discharge of the electrical double layers at both electrodes, we observe, for a constant current discharge, that cell geometry is an important factor in matching renewable energy to energy storage in batteries, with biofuel burning to a ramped current output affording the most efficient means to energy storage. It is notable that thin cells that suffer no electrode corrosion are suited for multi-cycle solar energy storage.


 	Fig. 1  Cartoon illustrating the approach taken in this work: solar, wind or tidal power is generated and used to charge-up a cerium–zinc redox battery, with the latter used to power cities. The rectifier/selector system also contains invertors to reconvert the battery DC output into AC. Note that for the tidal power case, we have chosen to depict the oscillating hydrofoils pioneered by Pulse Tidal (http://www.pulsetidal.com; accessed 1 August 2012) which sweep up and down, as demonstrated within the River Humber, Hull. Also illustrated is the electrical circuit equivalent of the battery system.	 

 	Fig. 2  Battery charging waveshapes: pure, constant DC (black) [battery-powered charging], DC ramp (green) [linear variation], DC accelerator–decelerator (yellow) [cyclic elliptical in current], fully rectified AC at 0.5 Hz with a constant DC offset (cyan) [turbine generation for constant wind, or biofuel burning], rectified tidal (red) [no AC variation], and solar (blue) [photovoltaic]. Note that the rectified AC signal is illustrated here at an exaggerated frequency (0.5 Hz) than that used in simulations (50 Hz), so that the nature of its waveshape is seen.

Note that the cell was charged for the first 10 s and allowed to discharge over the next 10 s.	 

 	Fig. 7  Variation of the modulus of the capacitative current during cell discharge (from 10 s) after charging for the first 10 s: pure, constant DC (black), DC ramp (green), DC accelerator–decelerator (yellow), fully rectified AC at 50 Hz with a constant DC offset (cyan), rectified tidal (red), and solar (blue); the cell geometry was thin with (b) or without (a) corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode.	 

 	Fig. 8  Variation of the energy loss ratio with drain current for thin (a) or thick (b) cells; closed and open symbols refer to cells with or without corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode, respectively. Key: pure, constant DC (black squares), DC ramp (green inverted triangles), DC accelerator–decelerator (yellow stars), fully rectified AC at 50 Hz with a constant DC offset (cyan pentagons), rectified tidal (red triangles), and solar (blue circles).	 

 	Fig. 9  Volume-normalised Ragone plots for thin (a) or thick (b) cells; closed and open symbols refer to cells with or without corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode, respectively.

 	Fig. 10  Performance characteristics of the galvanic cell under one week of solar illumination, with no work undertaken during the evenings of Day 6 and Day 7, with the morning of Day 7 having no Sun. Note that one day corresponds to 20 s in this work. (a) Current–charge and discharge characteristics. (b) Cell performance characteristics for thin (black and red) and thick (green and blue) cells in the presence (red and blue) or absence (black and green) of corrosion/deactivation at the zinc electrode. (c) Variation of (i) the energy used to charge-up the cell and (ii) the energy efficiency of the cell over the studied time period; key: open symbols refer to the absence of corrosion with closed symbols indicating corrosion of the zinc electrode, at thin (black and red) or thick (green and blue) cells. The data for Day 6 [in panel (ii)] and Day 7 [in panels (i) and (ii)] are not shown as no electrical work is done when the cell is at open circuit, viz. during the “night” of Day 6 and throughout the full day solar eclipse on Day 7 – a day of “rest”! Note that the absence of appearance of green traces in (b) and (c) is due to them lying immediately beneath the blue traces.
