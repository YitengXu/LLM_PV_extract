1. Introduction
In the 1950s and 1960s, the emergence of silicon diodes opened a new era of modern solid-state photovoltaics.1 This technology has developed rapidly and has greatly altered the human energy structure in the past few decades. Presently, large terrestrial and space photovoltaic power stations are spread all over the world, with the gradually maturing techniques of mono-2 and poly-crystalline silicon,3 gallium arsenide (GaAs)4 and other inorganic solar cells.5,6 Nevertheless, the subsequent emergence of organic polymer solar cells (PSCs) with the advantages of low cost, light weight, and solution processability for application in large-area flexible devices, has attracted great interest, which have been extensively studied in the past 20 years. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs have greatly improved from the initial near 1% (ref. 7) to a current of over 17% (ref. 8) benefiting from great innovation works on the development of novel donor9 and acceptor10,11 materials, design of new device architectures,8,12,13 optimization of the photoactive layer phase or morphology,14,15 and interface engineering16–18 between the active layer and the electrodes.
However, the practical application of PSCs has been restricted by their low efficiency and short lifetimes compared with that of inorganic material-based devices. The factors limiting the efficiency and lifetime of PSCs are as follows. The first involves the lack of high-performance low band-gap (LBG) polymers (Eg < 1.30 eV), which results in more than 60% of solar radiation not being effectively utilized. The second is related to absorption intensity because their low carrier mobility19 and short exciton diffusion length20 limit the active layer thickness and further aggravate insufficient photon harvesting.21 The third is the reduction of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) due to the thermal loss of hot carriers.22 Thus, the development of efficient LBG polymers or using a thicker active layer seems to be the easiest way to conquer these limitations. However, the former only has very limited success to date and the latter will the reduce carrier collection ratio and affect device performance detrimentally since a balance between light absorption and carrier collection is a basic requirement for high performance photovoltaic devices. Accordingly, the typical thickness of the active layer is about 100–200 nm,23,24 which can only utilize 60–80% of incident light and leads to a 70% limitation in external quantum efficiency (EQE), although the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is high at about 90%.21,25 Considering all the abovementioned factors, the PCE of polymer single-junction solar cells is unsatisfactory. Hence, feasible strategies for enhancing the performance of PSCs should focus on adequately harvesting sunlight in a broader spectral range and circumventing the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limitation of single-junction solar cells.26–28
Tandem configuration solar cells can synchronously tackle the aforementioned narrow absorption window and thermalization losses in single-junction devices via stacking two or more sub-cells with complementary absorption ranges.29–31 For a tandem solar cell (TSC) comprised of two sub-cells, the front sub-cell (or bottom sub-cell near ITO) based on wide band gap (WBG) materials absorbs high energy photons in the short wavelength region, and the rear sub-cell (or top sub-cell near metal electrode) based on LBG materials harvests low energy photons in the long wavelength region.32,33 Apparently, TSCs significantly broaden the spectral absorption coverage and overcome the thickness problem in single-junction cells through active layers stacked with matching band structures.34,35 Meanwhile, thermal loss can be effectively avoided due to the designable and tunable band structures of the active organic materials in each sub-cell. Benefiting from these outstanding features, a high efficiency potential of up to 30% can be predicted theoretically.
Very recently, a series of inspiring efficiency breakthroughs in polymer TSCs have been reported,8 which not only exhibits their great potential to achieve a higher PCE, but also makes them very promising despite their scientific and technological challenges. In this review, we attempt to present a systematic and comprehensive overview on the latest progress of polymer TSCs based on our long-term research experience. The operating principles that govern the photovoltaic process in polymer TSCs, including the key function of the intermediate layer (ICL), are introduced firstly to get an in-depth understanding of the device physics of organic optoelectronics. We then give a detailed summary on the selection rules of WBG and LBG polymer materials for TSC application, followed by introducing high performance non-fullerene acceptors and their exciting achievements in polymer TSCs. Furthermore, the progress on the design and processing of the ICL is reviewed as an indispensable subject for efficient polymer TSCs. After, the spectral response characterization of TSCs and the challenges with polymer TSCs are discussed, and their future prospects are presented briefly in the last section.
2. Working mechanism of polymer tandem solar cells
TSCs simultaneously tackle absorption and thermal losses, and thus enhance spectral coverage by combining WBG materials as high energy photon absorbers and LBG materials as low energy photon absorbers. According to the nature of the interconnecting layer (ICL) and the connection styles of the sub-cells, TSCs can be divided into parallel and series devices. Fig. 1a displays a 2-terminal (2T) monolithic polymer tandem device comprised of two sub-cells with complementary absorption spectra and matching band structures. Fig. 1b and c present the equivalent circuit of TSCs in series. The series connection requires current matching since the short current density (Jsc) of TSCs is limited by the minimum Jsc of the sub-cells, and the total open circuit voltage (Voc) of the TSC is the sum of each sub-cell (as shown in Fig. 1b and c). Jsc-series = Min [Jsc-front, Jsc-rear](1) Voc-series = Voc-front + Voc-rear(2)where, Jsc-series, Jsc-front and Jsc-rear are the Jsc of the TSC, front sub-cell and rear sub-cell and Voc-series, Voc-front and Voc-rear are their corresponding Voc, respectively. Under solar illumination, Jsc-front and Jsc-rear can be calculated as follows: (3) (4)where, Eg1 and Eg2 are the bandgap energy of the donor used in the front sub-cell and rear sub-cell, respectively, Iph is the photon flux in AM 1.5G and EQE1/IQE1 is the absorption of the bottom sub-cell. It must be noted that Mirrorloss represents the loss of absorption in the sub-cell implemented in the tandem versus the stand-alone single-cell, which will have a perfect mirror as the top electrode, and is induced by the absence of significant reflection at the interface between the bottom sub-cell and the ICL.36 Thus an unbalanced photocurrent between the sub-cells in series devices will seriously decrease the PCE of TSCs.

In contrast, in the parallel configuration (as shown in Fig. 1d and e), voltage matching is the basic requirement because the Voc of TSCs is determined by the sub-cell with the smaller Voc, and the total Jsc is the sum of each sub-cell. Voc-parallel = Min [Voc-front, Voc-rear](5) Jsc-parallel = Jsc-front + Jsc-rear(6)hence, it is necessary to choose materials with equal or similar Voc for the fabrication of parallel-configuration TSCs because the Voc of organic semiconductors is determined by the band gap of their donor and acceptor.
The ICL plays an important role both in series- and parallel-connected TSCs. In series-connected TSCs, the ICL placed between two sub-cells serves as an intermediate recombination layer. Fig. 2a and b show simplified band diagrams of conventional and inverted tandem cells connected in series via an ICL. The ICL should ensure the alignment of the quasi-Fermi level between the acceptor in the bottom cell and the donor in the top cell for traditional PSCs (Fig. 2a) or conversely between the donor in the bottom cell and the acceptor in the top cell for the inverted architecture (Fig. 2b). Following the same principle, an infinite number of devices can be theoretically stacked this way, and the ICL is assumed to guarantee balanced recombination between the electrons extracted from one sub-cell with holes from the other sub-cell. Hence, the voltage loss of TSCs can be effectively avoided benefiting from the complete carrier recombination in the ICL. Moreover, the ICL in series TSCs should be highly transparent to minimize the optical loss.

In parallel-connected TSCs, the ICL works as a common electrode incorporated between the front and rear sub-cells. Hence, the sides of the two sub-cells facing the ICL are supposed to have the same polarity, i.e., one sub-cell is the conventional structure and the other is the inverted structure. Fig. 2c and d show simplified band diagrams of the parallel TSCs. To maximize the photocurrent output of parallel TSCs, an ICL with high electrical conductivity and low impedance is vital to ease the resistance loss and further boost device performance. Fig. 3a and b show the corresponding contour plots of efficiency limits versus bandgaps of the two sub-cells. Currently, the development of highly efficient parallel TSCs is lagging behind series TSCs due to the lack of printable ICLs with high transparency and conductivity. Also, the high PCE window of TSCs in parallel is much narrower than that of series-connected TSCs by simulation.

3. Photoactive materials for polymer tandem solar cells
Based on the working mechanism analysis above, selecting and designing photoactive materials in each sub-cell to form a matching-band structure is crucial for achieving high performance TSCs. Generally, materials with bandgaps higher than 1.70 eV are defined as WBG materials, while that with bandgaps below 1.50 eV are called LBG materials. Materials with energy levels between 1.70 eV and 1.50 eV are referred to as medium bandgap materials. For efficient TSCs, there are satisfactory choices of WBG materials for the front sub-cell, but it is still challenging to find rear sub-cell photoactive materials with an infrared absorption onset of up to 1050–1150 nm.
Fortunately, benefiting from the advanced synthesis of organic materials, currently, non-fullerene molecules with widely tunable band structures open another door for optimal choice of rear cell active materials. The synthetic strategies for obtaining outstanding photoactive materials are as follows: (i) D–A copolymerization for narrower Eg and lower-lying HOMO, (ii) substitution with electron-withdrawing groups for lower-lying HOMO, and (iii) two-dimensional conjugation for broad absorption and higher hole mobility.38 Therefore, in this section, we aim to present a comprehensive review on a variety of WBG donors for front sub-cells, LBG donors for rear sub-cells and non-fullerene acceptors with complementary absorption spectra for TSCs. Additionally, we try to enumerate the current problems and challenges that they face, and suggest a series of countermeasures for their future development.
3.1 Wide bandgap materials for the front sub-cell
Many novel WBG polymer donor materials have been designed and synthesized, as shown in Fig. 4. Polythiophene derivatives, as one of the important WBG polymer light absorbers, have been widely used in BHJ organic solar cells and have shown high performance. For instance, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT, with an Eg of 1.9 eV is a typical polythiophene derivative donor material, which has played a pivotal role during the development of PSC efficiency. After tireless efforts from scientists, the PCE of optimized PSCs based on P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICBA increased from the initial less than 1.00% to 5.10% and 6.48%,38–41 respectively. Nevertheless, WBG materials regularly suffer from narrow absorption, and moreover, there constantly exists a tradeoff between high voltage and wide absorption. Thus, to extend the absorption edge and promote the Voc, strategies for enhancing the LUMO of the acceptor and deepening the HOMO of donor have to be addressed because the Voc of PSCs is proportional to the offset between the HOMO level of electron donor materials and the LUMO level of electron acceptor materials.
 Fig. 4  (a) Chemical structure and (b) energy level of wide band gap polymers for tandem solar cells (the HOMO–LUMO levels were extracted from published papers, which may differ slightly from actual measurements). 
For donor materials, the intensively adopted strategy is D–A copolymerization for narrower Eg and lower-lying HOMO, and the application of less electron-rich and strong electron-deficient groups is practical to reduce the HOMO level of the donor. Fluorene, carbazole, furan and benzodithiophene (BDT) moieties are the typical less electron-rich atoms and groups. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), benzothiophene (BT), benzotriazole, thienopyrrole-dione (TPD), dithienopyrrole (DTP) and carboxylate substituents, sulfonyl, and alkylsilyl are the strong electron-deficient groups. Qiang Peng et al. reported two conjugated copolymers of PBDTFBZO (Eg = 2.10 eV) and PBDTFBZS (Eg = 2.06 eV) consisting of dialkylthiol-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene BDT donor and monofluorinated benzotriazole acceptor blocks.42 By replacing the thiophene with a furan moiety, the HOMO level of PBDTFBZO was found to be lower than that of PBDTFBZS since the electron density of furan is lower than that of thiophene due to its higher ionization potential.43 The HOMO and LUMO levels for PBDTFBZS are −5.32 eV and −3.26 eV, and the corresponding levels for PBDTFBZO are −5.38 eV and −3.28 eV, respectively. The obtained low-lying HOMO energy level via incorporating dialkylthiol and fluorine substituents on the polymer backbone contributes to a higher Voc. Simultaneously, higher carrier mobility, suppressed charge recombination, and fine nanostructure morphology also lead to an improvement in Jsc and FF. The corresponding device with structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTFBZO:PC71BM/Ca/Al showed a Voc of 0.91 V, surpassing that of 0.86 V for devices based on PBDTFBZS:PC71BM. Further, the TSCs with PBDTFBZS:PC71BM front and PNDTDPP:PC71BM back sub-cells presented a relatively high quantum efficiency within the wavelength range of 300 to 750 nm and the maximum EQE of 65% passed through at about 560 nm, leading to a PCE of 9.40%, which is superior to that of the individual cell based on PBDTFBZS:PC71BM (6.18%) and PNDTDPP:PC71BM (6.35%).
The WBG donor, which have strong electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid substituents, of poly[5,5′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-(2,2′-bithiophene)-4,4′-dicarboxylate-alt-5,5′-2,2′-bithiophene] (PDCBT, Eg = 1.90 eV)44 was synthesized. A 30 nm red-shift in the absorption edge was realized for PDCBT (650 nm) in contrast to that of P3HT by deepening the HOMO level from −4.90 eV of P3HT to −5.26 eV of PDCBT. Benefiting from the lower-lying HOMO and high absorption coefficient (1.03 × 105 cm−1) of PDCBT, the PSCs based on PDCBT/PC71BM (1:1, w/w) exhibited a PCE of 7.20% with a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 11.00 mA cm−2, and FF of 72.00%, where the maximum reached 75% at 470 nm, which is 30% higher than that of the devices with a P3HT donor. Notably, the PCE of the devices based on PDCBT:ITIC even reached up to 10%.45 In contrast, the solar cells based on P3HT/PC71BM (1:1, w/w) only showed a PCE of 1.80% with a Voc of 0.63 V, Jsc of 4.50 mA cm−2, and FF of 62%. Inspiringly, the TSCs utilizing PDCBT:PC71BM as the active layer for the front sub-cell fulfilled an excellent PCE of 10.16%.32
For the acceptor materials, it is necessary to raise their LUMO, and therefore increase their absorption in the visible spectrum, whilst try to boost their carrier mobility. Strong electron-donating groups are useful to lift the LUMO of acceptor materials. For example, the widely used acceptors [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) is superior to [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) since C70 absorbs visible light more efficiently. NC60BA, one of the dihydronaphthyl-based[60]fullerene bisadduct derivatives, possesses a LUMO level higher than that of PC60BM by 0.16 eV, and has a slightly stronger absorption capability within the wavelength range of 400 to 550 nm. Consequently, devices based on P3HT:NC60BA exhibited a Voc of 0.84 and PCE of 5.37%.46
Yongfang Li et al. designed and synthesized IC60BA38 (indene-C60 bisadduct) and IC70BA47 as bisadduct fullerene derivatives with the electron-rich characteristics of indene and the effect of the bisadduct, which are excellent acceptors for the P3HT-based PSCs because the LUMO of IC60BA and IC70BA are −1.70 eV and −1.90 eV higher than that of PCBM (−3.90 eV), respectively. Therefore, the highest recorded Voc of 0.84 V for the P3HT:ICBA based solar cell is much higher than that of the P3HT:PCBM based solar cell of 0.60 V, leading to a PCE of 6%.41 In 2012, ICBA successfully served as the acceptor of the bottom sub-cell in TSCs. Yang Yang's group prepared a TSC with a P3HT:ICBA based bottom sub-cell and PBDTT-DPP:PC71BM based top sub-cell, achieving an impressive PCE of 8.62%.48 Then they combined the same bottom sub-cell with the PDTP-DFBT:PCBM-based top sub-cell, and successfully broadened the spectral response to 900 nm and broke the 10% PCE barrier.33 Their TSCs fulfilled a Voc of 1.53 V, which outperformed other counterparts and reached the milestone of 10.60%.
3.2 Low band gap donors for the rear sub-cell
The LBG donors for rear sub-cells are crucial to obtain a current balance between each sub-cell and further realize efficient TSCs since the sub-cells with optimal bandgaps divide the solar spectrum into several spectral regions and the LBG rear sub-cell needs to sufficiently harvest long wavelength photons. Desirable organic semiconducting donors for the rear sub-cell should have low bandgap and low HOMO. Many strategies are widely used to design high quality LBG organic semiconducting materials, such as the introduction of a copolymer with quinoid features and groups with the π-electron push–pull effect (or donor–acceptor D–A features) of benzothiadiazole (BT),49,50 DPP,48,51 isoindigo,52 terthiophene units.53 However, these methods significantly elevate the HOMO levels of donors by introducing strong electron-donating groups, which is contrary to reducing their bandgap and widening their absorption spectral coverage, and results in a significant decrease in Voc.
Considering the HOMO is dominated by the electron-rich unit and the LUMO by the electron-deficient unit, the nature of the side chains can be used to preferentially influence the HOMO or LUMO level.54,55 To obtain low band gap donors for rear sub-cells, introducing alkoxy or alkyl amino side groups is a feasible approach.56–58 DPP, as a versatile building block, has been combined with electron-rich fragments such as oligothiophene to produce an effective low bandgap donor polymer for solar cells. PBDTT-DPP is a typical DPP-based LBG donor material for TSCs, which has a wide absorption coverage range; however, there is an absorption valley within the spectral region from 300 to 650 nm. The WBG material PCDTBT can result in complementary absorption with PBDTT-DPP because the absorption of PCDTBT is very strong in the wavelength range of 400 to 650 nm. Thus, the inverted TSCs using PCDTBT and PBDTT-DPP as the donor polymers for the front and rear sub-cells, respectively, achieved a PCE of 9.02%, Jsc of 8.53 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.60 V, and FF of 66.14%, demonstrating that PBDTT-DPP is a very promising low bandgap polymer for high performance TSCs.59
DPP is also a good LBG acceptor candidate for multi-junction TSCs. Janssen et al. developed a series of ultra-small bandgap donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers of PDPPTDTPT and PDPPSDTPS by using DPP as the acceptor and pyrrole-based groups as donors,57 which could progressively push the bandgap down to 1.34–1.13 eV and maintain a high spectral response. The photo-response was pushed to 1200 nm and the maximum EQE reached up to 50%. Moreover, the bandgap of DPP can be effectively tuned by the length of its electron-rich segments. PMDPP3T with an Eg of 1.30 eV was synthesized by placing two additional methyl substituents on position 3 of the thiophene ring connected to DPP, which displayed ambipolar behavior with balanced hole and electron mobility in the range of 10−2–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. When blended with PC61BM and PC71BM for single junction devices, the absorption edge was extended to 900 nm and the corresponding EQE reached up to 55% and 61% at 800 nm, respectively. Similarly, the double and triple-junction TSCs utilizing PMDPP3T as the LBG donor of the rear sub-cell exhibited a PCE of 8.90% and 9.60%,60 respectively.
Other excellent LBG materials featuring benzodithiophene and thienothiophene52,55,61–65 have been successfully synthesized and applied in TSCs. They not only provide desirable Jsc by reducing their bandgap, but also lower the HOMO level by 0.12–0.13 eV for LBG materials, leading to a distinct enhancement of Voc and PCE. For instance, in 2016 Jianhui Hou et al. synthesized an excellent LBG material of poly(2,5-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-3,6-diyl-alt-3′′,4′-difluoro-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene-5,5′′′-diyl) (PDPP4T-2F)66 by introducing F atoms to PDPP4T. PDPP4T-2F embraces a deeper HOMO of −5.22 eV and Eg of 1.37 eV, and the PDPP4T-2F-based single-junction devices achieved a Voc of 0.78 V and EQE values beyond 60% in the wavelength range of 700 to 900 nm. The TSCs with the architecture of ITO/PFN/PBDD4T-2F:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag/PFN/PDPP4T-2F:PC71BM/MoO3/Al fulfilled a PCE of 11.60% with a Voc of 1.68 V, Jsc of 11.29 mA cm−2, and FF of 61.30%. Remarkably, the EQE was as high as 65% within the spectral coverage range of 700 to 800 nm. Another LBG donor material of PDTP-DFBT was first synthesized by introducing two electron-withdrawing F atoms to PCPDT-BT, which possesses a lower HOMO of −5.34 eV than that of PCPDT-BT (−5.18 eV). However, the EQE of the prepared cell based on PDTP-DFBT was only slightly higher than 40% within the wavelength range of 600 to 800 nm, and the in-depth understanding and application about this material warrant further study. The chemical structure and energy level of the LBG polymers used in tandem solar cells are summarized in Fig. 5.

3.3 Non-fullerene acceptors for tandem solar cells
In TSCs, the widely used photoactive layers are generally composed of a polymer donor and a fullerene acceptor (predominantly [6,6]phenylC71/C61butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM/PC61BM)). Fullerene derivatives as the electron acceptor in PSCs have been extensively studied and achieved great progress in the last decade. However, several drawbacks have to be addressed. The first is their poor light absorption in the visible region, resulting in inefficient photon harvesting and low Jsc. The second involves their high photovoltage loss,67 which means single-junction devices exhibit a low Voc in the range of 0.6–1.0 V,68–70 and TSCs offer a Voc in the range of 1.2–1.8 V.71,72 The third is related to the aggregation of fullerenes under elevated temperatures, causing a deterioration in morphology and detrimental effect on the lifetime of PSCs. Hence, an ideal non-fullerene acceptor should have merits including: (i) appropriate energy levels to match the donor, (ii) wide and strong absorption or complementary absorption with the donor, (iii) morphology compatibility in film, (iv) good exciton separation and charge transport, (v) easy synthesis, (vi) good solvent compatibility, and (vii) non-critical processing conditions.
The utilization of polymers or non-fullerene molecules as electron acceptors is considered to be an effective strategy to solve the abovementioned problems.73–75 Compared to polymer/fullerene-based solar cells, all-polymer or polymer/non-fullerenes solar cells demonstrate more superior properties, including enhanced thermal stability, optical absorption, mechanical properties and greater synthetic flexibility in regulating the properties of the acceptor material. During the past decade, the rapid development of all-polymer or polymer/non-fullerene solar cells has confirmed that a higher Voc (0.90–1.30 V) can be obtained in these single-junction devices than that of fullerene devices with a similar optical bandgap.76,77 The device using tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) as the acceptor and α-sexithiophene (6T) as the donor gave a PCE of 2.7% with a rather high Voc of 1.25 V.78 Zhan Xiaowei et al. used carbonyl and cyano electron-withdrawing groups to design and synthesize the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC (HOMO/LUMO, −5.61/−4.02 eV),75 based on which, Hou et al. further synthesized a series of non-fullerene acceptors including IT-M(HOMO/LUMO, −5.58/−3.98 eV) and IT-DM(HOMO/LUMO, −5.56/−3.93 eV). The devices based on PBDB-T:ITIC, PBDB-T:IT-M, and PBDB-T:IT-DM exhibited an average PCE of over 11%, with a Voc of 0.90 V, 0.94 V and 0.97 V, respectively.79
Nevertheless, few studies have been focused on all-polymer and polymer/non-fullerene TSCs in comparison with polymer/fullerene TSCs. Very recently, stimulated by further improving performance of PSCs, some investigations attempt to explore polymer/non-fullerene TSCs. For instance, P2F-DO shows weak absorption capability in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm, but the copolymer of NDI-bithiophene and N2200 acceptor demonstrate strong absorption properties in the wavelength range of 400 nm and 600–800 nm, which can form complementary absorption with P2F-DO. The devices with the structure of ITO/ZnO/P2F-DO:NDI2OD-T2(N2200) (110 nm)/M-PEDOT:PSS(50 nm)/ZnO(40 nm)/P2F-DO:NDI2OD-T2(N2200) (110 nm)/MoO3/Ag give a PCE of 7%, which is 43% higher than that of single solar cells.80 Chen et al. successfully fabricated polymer/non-fullerene TSCs with structure of ITO/ZnO/PFN/P3HT:SF(DPPB)4/MoO3/Ag/PFN/PTB7-Th:IEIC/MoO3/Ag, exhibiting a Voc of 1.97 V, Jsc of 8.28 mA cm−2, FF of 52% and PCE of 8.48%.81 In this device, P3HT:SF(DPPB)4 and PTB7-Th:IEIC BHJs with complementary absorption in the visible region were used as the front and rear sub-cells in an inverted tandem structure, respectively.
The LBG non-fullerene acceptor material IEICO with an Eg of 1.34 eV, LUMO of −3.95 eV and HOMO of −5.32 eV was designed and synthesized by introducing the electron-donating alkoxy group into the main chain of the conjugated small molecule of IEIC (Eg = 1.50 eV). When it was blended with the PBDTTT-E donor material, the Voc of the device was 0.82 V and the absorption edge was extended to 900 nm, leading to a PCE of 8.4% for the single solar cells and 10.7% for TSCs.82 Recently, a non-fullerene TSC based on PBDB-T:F-M (front sub-cell) and PTB7-Th:NOBDT (rear sub-cell) realized a Voc of 1.71 V, Jsc of 11.72 mA cm−2, FF of 70% and maximum PCE of 14.11%, benefiting from the WBG non-fullerene acceptor F-M (Eg = 1.72 eV) and LBG non-fullerene acceptor NOBDT (Eg = 1.37 eV).71 For the optimization of the Eg of NOBDT (HOMO = −5.26 eV and LUMO = −3.89 eV), a strong electron-donating ability octyloxy and a fluorine atom were synchronously utilized based on 4,4,10,10-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,10-dihydrodithienyl[1,2-b:4.5-b′]benzodi-thiophene-2,8-diyl)bis(2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (NFBDT), causing the absorption edge to be red-shifted by 100 nm compared to NFBDT. F-M was synthesized based on 2,9-bis(2-methylene(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)indanone))7,12-dihydro-4,4,7,7,12,12-hexaoctyl-4H-cyclopenta[2′′,1′′:5,6; 3′′,4′′:5′,6′]diindeno[1,2-b:1′,2-b′]dithiophene (F–H) by introducing methyl as a weak electron-donating unit to elevate the LUMO and HOMO (both elevated by 0.01 eV compared to that of F–H, which were −5.42 and −3.70 eV, respectively). More inspiringly, a TSC achieving a remarkable PCE of 17.29%, Voc of 1.636 V, Jsc of 14.32 mA cm−2 and FF of 72.1% adopted the same active layer PBDB-T:F-M for the front sub-cell giving a Voc of 0.94 V. While, the rear sub-cell employed the ternary blend PTB7-Th:O6T-4F:PC71BM with the non-fullerene acceptor O6T-4F featuring an Eg of 1.20 eV and infrared absorption onset of ∼1050 nm, exhibiting a high Jsc of 27.98 mA cm−2 in the range from 300 to 1050 nm and Voc of 0.69 V (Fig. 6).

4. The interconnection layers for polymer tandem solar cells
In addition to the requirement that the photoactive material must have complementary absorption, a tandem cell connected in series requires an interlayer electrode capable of connecting the front and rear sub-cells electrically and physically. Typical ICLs can be divided into the following categories: (i) ICLs composed of a p-type material with high work function (WF) and n-type material with low WF, (ii) ICLs made of small molecules by thermal vacuum evaporation, (iii) ICLs made of merely a thin metal layer or metal cluster, (iv) ICLs made of a doped p–n junction, and (v) ICLs composed of a sandwiched structure with a metal between a p-type and n-type material. The widely accepted ICLs consist of n-type and p-type materials that selectively extract electrons and holes to be recombined at the ICL. Since the performance of tandem devices is strongly dependent on the properties of their intermediate electrodes, ICL is one of crucial issues in TSCs.
Therefore, a suitable ICL needs to meet the following requirements: (i) the ICL is supposed to achieve non-impedance electrical connection of sub-cells for there to be no/minimal electric potential loss in the photoelectric conversion process, (ii) the transmittance of the ICL should be high enough within the visible range to minimize light absorption, (iii) the quasi-Fermi level of electrons and holes must be aligned by the ICL to allow complete recombination, and (iv) most importantly, the physical robustness of the ICL should be high enough to protect the underlying layer from destruction during fabrication of the subsequent layers. Also, it is vital to broaden the solvent selection range for the ICL because low boiling point solvents such as chloroform and methylene chloride solution and accelerating dry technology are used in the following sub-cell processing. In addition, the ICL processing technology should be facile and have the potential to achieve high processing throughput at low cost.
Currently, thermal vacuum deposition and solution processing are commonly used to prepare the ICL. The former is generally adopted by small molecule-based OPV, which is easy to construct tandem structures but consumes a great amount of energy and time. The typical ICLs processed via this method include Au, Ag, Al, MoO3/Ag/Al/Ca,83 and MoOx/SnOx.84 In 1990, a 2 nm-thick Au layer was firstly utilized as an ICL to fabricate TSCs with the structure of ITO/Me-PTC/H2Pc/Au/Me-PTC/H2Pc/Au, and it was found that the holes from one sub-cell and electrons from the other sub-cell recombined at the Au layer, and thus the stacking of solar cells was realized.85 The Voc of TSCs was enhanced to 0.78 V in contrast to 0.44 V for a single-junction device, achieving a higher Voc by stacking two cells in series. In 2002, ultra-thin Ag clusters connecting two or more sub-cells were used to recombine unpaired chargers from two sub-cells in copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) donor and 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic bis-benzimidazole (PTBDI) acceptor-based TSCs.86
The low temperature solution processing of ICLs is potentially a low cost technology for commercial application. An efficient ICL, which consisted of ZnO and neutralized PEDOT:PSS and achieved excellent functionality and reliability, was processed at 80 °C in air.87 Considering the important role the ICL plays in TSCs, we attempt to elucidate the functions of the ICL on device performance in this section, review different ICLs in conventional and inverted series-connected TSCs and raise the current problems of ICL and their solutions.
4.1 Functions of ICL on the performance of tandem solar cells
ICLs with different structures and components demonstrate different functions on device performance although the charge recombination process is basically the same. The influence of ICLs on the light field, electrical field and other properties of devices need to be investigated from different aspects, which include the thermionic emission effect, plasma effect, and optical microcavity effect.
The functions of ICLs from a thermionic emission and WF regulation point of view have been widely reported. Full solution-processed MoOx/dipole layer/TiO2 ICLs were studied using three amino-functionalized water/alcohol polymers as dipole layers, where PF6N25Py, PF6NO26Py, PF6NO35Py were the dipole layers.88 The studies demonstrated that the dipole layers eliminate the existing counter diodes between MoOx (−5.42) and TiO2 (−4.2 eV) (a phenomenon that introduces a hindrance to prevent the recombination of holes and electrons), and PF6N25Py, PF6NO26Py, PF6NO35Py can tune the work function of MoOx from −5.42 eV to −4.71, −4.43 and −4.18 eV, respectively. The TSCs using an ICL of MoOx/dipole layer/TiO2 delivered an s-shaped J–V curve (Fig. 7) in comparison to that of the control devices with an ICL layer of MoOx/TiO2 when the temperature drops below 300 K, indicating that the holes from the front sub-cell and electrons from the rear cell are subjected to a barrier, and hence it is difficult for them to reach the dipole layer for recombination. This suggests that the thermionic emission in the dipole layer contributes greatly to the electron–hole recombination, and the dipole layer provided an Ohmic contact for charge recombination.

The intercalation of dopant nanoparticles in the ICL has two functions: (1) the formation of a recombination center for unpaired carriers produced within the device and (2) introduction of a near field to increase the absorptivity of the active layer. The PEDOT:PSS/PEI ICL with dopant Ag NPs was developed to connect two identical sub-cells based on a P3HT:PCBM photoactive layer. The results showed that the larger size of Ag NPs with a strong plasma effect is beneficial to the Jsc (EQE) but harmful to the FF and Voc, and the small-sized Ag NPs with a very weak plasma effect have a much better overall effect on device performance. This indicates that the enhancement of Jsc (EQE) is irrelevant to the local field induced by the plasmon effect. Under 635 nm red LED light, the carrier transmission time was 8.95 and 3.14 microseconds before and after the introduction of Ag NPs, respectively. While, the exciton recombination time was extended from 63.4 to 356.3 microseconds before and after incorporating the Ag NPs. The extended lifetime of the electron–hole pairs strongly indicate that the Ag NP layer acted as the recombination site and the carrier accumulation at the active layer interface was significantly reduced.89
In the ICL of TSCs, incorporating metal nanoparticles into polymers is one of the commonly used methods to regulate the electric field and increase the absorptivity of the active layer. Yang et al. introduced Au NPs into the ICL and fabricated inverted TSCs with the structure of ITO/TiO2:Cs/P3HT:ICBA/PEDOT:PSS:Au/TiO2:Cs/PSBTBT:PC70BM/MoO3/Al. The plasma primitive effect produced by Au NPs improved the optical absorption capacity of the sub-cells, leading to an increased efficiency by 20%.90
The optical microcavity effect can be described as when incident light passes through an electrode and is absorbed firstly by the active layer, then the unabsorbed photons move to the other electrode and reflect back to the active layer for further absorption. The optical microcavity between two highly reflective surfaces may limit the specific wavelength of light by resonant recycling. Interposing a thin metal layer between n-type and p-type materials of the ICL results in the formation of an optical microcavity. When a portion of the unabsorbed light transmits from the front junction cell to the ICL, part of the light can be reflected back to the front junction cell by the metal layer. Similarly, the back contact electrode metal can reflect the light unabsorbed by the rear sub-cell to the rear sub-cell again for further harvesting.91–93 The oscillation characteristics of the microcavity depend on the thickness of the photoactive layer, the capping layer and the ultrathin metal layer.
The optical microcavity effect has been applied in a parallel TSCs, and the maximum Jsc can be achieved when the thickness of the rear sub-cell is 75 nm, which is independent of the thickness of the front sub-cell. This is attributed to the formation of a microcavity in the rear sub-cell, which not only enhances optical input coupling, but also allows specific wavelengths to be captured in the rear sub-cell. Unlike the strict current balance required in series TSCs, the thickness of both the front and rear cells can be used in a certain range without causing loss of Jsc.94 A previous report even showed that the Jsc of TSCs with a capped optical microcavity was 5% higher than of that of the single-junction device, and the single-junction cell with a microcavity structure had a Jsc that was 25% higher than that of the single-junction cell without a microcavity.95 The ICLs used in tandem solar cells connected in parallel are summarized in Table 1.

4.2 ICLs in conventional and inverted series-connected tandem solar cells
The low temperature solution processing of ICLs is potentially a low cost technology both in conventional and inverted series-connected TSCs. In 2007, Kim for the first time prepared a polymer TSC using a full-solution method.96 Solution-processed TiOx/PEDOT:PSS as the ICL, and P3HT:PCBM and PCPDTBT:PCBM as the complementary light-absorbing layers were integrated to increase the efficiency of TSCs. The milestone PCE of the full-solution polymer TSCs reached 6.5%, which is a great breakthrough for polymer TSCs. The commonly used ZnO/PEDOT:PSS and TiOx/PEDOT:PSS for conventional TSCs are both fabricated via solution processing, which have been proven to be effective ICLs. The p-type material m-PEDOT with a high WF and n-type material TiO2 were used to prepare an ICL in a full-solution processed TSC, and the m-PEDOT film attracted holes from its nearby sub-cell and TiO2 film attracted electrons from its nearby sub-cell.97 In addition, some ICLs have been prepared via vacuum deposition together with solution processing, such as LiF/Al/Au/PEDOT:PSS, LiF/Al/MoO3, and Al/TiO2/PEDOT:PSS.
Some ICLs can produce photo-generated carriers under illumination. A model was constructed with the architecture of ITO/TiO2/PEDOT/Al to understand the working mechanism. To avoid short-circuiting of the devices, TiO2 films with a thickness of 80 nm were used, which account for the high-resistance state of the conductive state. The J–V curves of the device before and after illumination are shown in Fig. 8. A very limited current can pass through the device prior to illumination due to the low carrier concentration in the interlayer. However, the incident light significantly increases this charge carrier density, which reduces the electron injection barrier between PEDOT and TiO2, making electrons easily tunnel through the interface, resulting in a large injection current. Combined with ITO/Ag(10 nm)/P3HT:IC60BA/TiO2/m-PEDOT/PSBTBT:PC70BM/V2O5(7 nm)/Al, the device should be insulated, as observed from the original device. However, after photoactivation of TiO2, typical diode behavior was observed in the dark. This phenomenon strongly suggested charge injection from the ICL to the two sub-cells, namely, electrons and holes are produced from the ICL under forward bias, followed by their injection into front and rear sub-cells. The overall effect of UV activation is to allow electrons to flow from the rear sub-cell to the front sub-cell, considering the injection of electrons into the front sub-cell and the injection of holes into the rear cell. Thus, it was concluded that the UV-activated electrons in TiO2 are the starting point for the charge generation process and the energy level alignment (starting point) for the transition from m-PEDOT to TiO2 without barriers.98 The ICLs used in conventional tandem solar cells connected in series are summarized in Table 2.

In inverted tandem solar cells, the commonly used ICLs are PEDOT:PSS/ZnO99 PEDOT:PSS/TiOx, MoO3/Ag/Al/Ca, and MoO3/Ag/ZnO. PEDOT:PSS/ZnO was employed as an ICL, and under UV illumination an Ohmic PEDOT:PSS/ZnO contact was well-formed, which exhibited an excellent performance in solution-processed inverted tandem solar cells.100,101 Recently, we applied titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TIPD) as both an electrode modification layer and intermediate layer to investigate its feasibility in inverted tandem polymer solar cells. The same photoactive layers of PTB7-Th:PC71BM were adopted in both the front and rear sub-cells to simplify the evaluation of the effectiveness of the TIPD layer in tandem structures. By modulating the treatment conditions of IML and the thickness of the photoactive layer, efficient inverted tandem PSCs were achieved with minimized voltage loss and excellent charge transportation. The best Voc of 1.54 V was obtained, which was almost two times that of the single bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-PSC (0.78 V) and an enhanced PCE of up to 8.11%.102 Furthermore, we adopted MoO3/Ag/PFN-Br as an interconnecting layer to join the front sub-cell of PBDTBDD:PC70BM and rear sub-cell of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F for the construction an inverted tandem solar cell with the structure of ITO/TIPD/PBDTBDD:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag/PFN-Br/PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F/MoO3/Al. The tandem devices demonstrated strong and wide light responses in the wavelength range of 300 and 1000 nm. A Promising PCE of 9.74% was achieved with a Voc of 1.503 V. The PCE of the tandem cell was 41.36% higher than that (6.89%) of the front sub-cell and 27.82% higher than that (7.62%) of the rear sub-cell, as shown in Fig. 9.103

Yang et al. prepared two different inverted TSCs with PEDOT/ITO (defined as Tandem I) and MoO3/ZnO:Al (defined as Tandem IV) ICL, and a-Si:H (1.80 eV) (200 nm) for the front cell and PDTP-DFBT(1.38 eV):PC70BM (120 nm) for the rear cell. Although the Voc and FF differences fort the two TSCs were both within 5%, the Jsc for the front sub-cell in Tandem I was 9.8 mA cm−2, much larger than 8.0 mA cm−2 of Tandem IV. The Jsc performance of different ICLs connecting the same sub-cells strongly indicates that the ICL plays an important role in the light field distribution of tandem solar cell devices. This conclusion was further verified by single-junction cells using PEDOT/ITO and MoO3/ZnO:Al as the back electrode. The results showed that the performance the single-solar cell with the PEDOT/ITO back electrode was superior to that with MoO3/ZnO:Al. EQE and optical simulation were carried out to investigate the origin of the reflective effect of PEDOT/ITO on light. One reason is that MoO3, a commonly used charge quencher and charge recombination site in bulk heterojunctions, degrades the surface of the active layer. The electrical requirement for the ICL is that it should form an Ohmic contact with the active layers. A good Ohmic contact can effectively reduce the parallel resistance of tandem solar cells, promoting the carriers to reach the IML and composite at the IML. The contact interface of PEDOT/ITO and MoO3/ZnO:Al with the active layer is different and the Ohmic contact is not the same, which may also cause changes in device performance.97,104 The ICLs used in inverted tandem solar cells connected in series are summarized in Table 3.

4.3 Problems raised by ICL and their solutions
Despite the stringent requirements for processing, the performance of the ICL generally is imperfect due to its complex design and preparation process. The common problems include non-geminate recombination,105 resulting in s-shaped protrusions in the J–V curves and causing a serious drop in Jsc, FF and PCE of TSCs.106–111
A thin dipole layer, energetic barrier, or less conductive layer in ICL can result in charge accumulation, charge transfer imbalances, and Schottky resistance between active layers, resulting in s-shaped curves, which indicate a counter diode or strongly voltage dependent photo current generation.112–117 Although s-shaped curves are caused by many different factors, the bias voltage-dependent photocurrent recombination accounts for the s-shaped J–V curves.117 Several models have shown that s-shaped curve generation is induced when Schottky junctions are present in the cell. The open-circuit voltage is obtained when the diffusion current equals the drift current. Accordingly, there is no net current and all bias voltages are used to suppress the light current on the p–n junction since Schottky junctions have no effect on Voc, which is generic in p–n junctions. However, the large series resistance acts as a major determinant when the voltage equals the Voc. In D–A junctions, differential series impedance is almost the same as series impedance. The Schottky junction differential series impedance is large, which equals both the resistance of a single Schottky junction and the parallel resistance. Therefore, when the Voc = 0 V, the Schottky characteristics play a decisive role, where an s-shaped curve appears just as the Schottky characteristic curve. Therefore, it can be concluded that any non-Ohmic contact, or any rectifier junction connected in series with the D–A junction may cause an s-shaped curve.
Methods, including establishing recombination centers and aligning the quasi-Fermi level of electrons and holes, have been proposed to eliminate the s-shaped curves of TSCs.118 An ultrathin Au, Ag, and Al layer, metal nanoclusters, and metal nanoparticles,89 acting as the carrier recombination center and promoting the aligned Fermi level, could be interposed between the HTL (MoO3, WO3, V2O5, PEDOT:PSS, etc.) and ETL (LiF, CsF, Cs2CO3, TiO2, ZnO, etc.) of the ICL to improve the collection and recombination of carriers, eliminate the s-shaped curve and boost FF.81,109,119–121 It is worth noting that to avoid s-shaped curves, the metal nanoparticles (such as Ag NPs) should be small enough to be completely covered by the following ETL or HTL to avoiding direct contact between the nanoparticles and the subsequent active layer.
A thermal ion and work function adjustment layer can effectively solve the s-shaped curve issue caused by splitting of the Fermi level.122 A TSC with PEDOT/PF6N25Py as the ICL gave an s-shaped J–V curve due to the insufficient alignment of the Fermi level of PEDOT/PF6N25Py, exhibiting an FF of 39.41%, Voc of 1.18 V, Jsc of 3.43 mA cm−2 and PCE of 1.60%. A ZrAcac layer, generating thermionic emission phenomena and modulating the work function of PEDOT to align the Fermi level of electrons and holes, was inserted into the ICL.118 Finally the TSC exhibited a Jsc of 4.53 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.20 V, FF of 64.61% and PCE of 3.51%, resulting from the PEDOT/ZrAcac/PF6N25Py ICL great ability to reduce the s-shaped curve. The structure and characteristic curve are shown in Fig. 10.

A metal interlayer (e.g. Au) playing a dual role was proposed in TSCs, where on one hand, it may prevent the interdiffusion of dopants to avoid the formation of a compensated region. On the other hand, it extenuates the s-shaped curve by providing gap states, which are beneficial for the tunneling charges penetrating the p–n junction barriers.121 TSCs based on a phthalocyanine zinc (ZnPc) and C60 photoactive layer with Au layer in the ICL delivered a higher Jsc and increased FF of 45% in comparison with that of TSCs without the Au layer (FF of 32%). However, ICLs consisting of a simple layer of metal or metal nanoclusters exhibit insufficient carrier extraction selectivity, resulting in insufficient carrier recombination and s-shaped bumps. Therefore doped HTL and ETL are adopted in the ICL to eliminate the s-shaped curves.33,123–126 Besides, introducing a doping layer to the ICL only based on a metal thin layer or metal cluster can improve conductivity and reduce Ohmic contact loss.127 ICLs consisting of p-type HTL PEDOT:PSS and n-type ETL TiO2/ZnO (UV excitation) have been widely reported.118,128,129 However, the insufficient conductivity of PEDOT:PSS and TiO2/ZnO may bring about s-shaped curves, which can be solved by applying UV excitation to TiO2/ZnO130 since UV excitation is beneficial to reduce potential loss during the recombination of carriers of TSCs.131,132
Also, in the ICL, firstly the Fermi level can be moved to the transport level with a very small HOMO and LUMO difference and very narrow space charge layer (only several nanometers). Secondly, a high doping concentration can increase the carrier concentration by several orders of magnitude on both sides of the composite interlayer, and the high carrier concentration can reduce the narrow space charge layer and reduce the impedance of the ICL by several tens to several hundred times.133–136 Both aspects result in a high recombination rate in the ICL, which removes the quasi-Fermi level splitting at the heterojunction and s-shaped curves.109,137,138
When two sub-cells are directly stacked together without ICL (Fig. 11a), the electrons from one sub-cell and holes from the other cannot meet at the same energy level, resulting in quasi-Fermi level splitting and reverse voltage between the contacts of the sub-cells, which compromise the Voc of tandem solar cells.124Fig. 11b shows the metal clusters as recombination centers between two sub-cells, where the quasi-Femi level splitting would be eliminated if the carrier recombination rate is larger than the generation rate owing to illumination, and therefore no reverse voltage at the contact is expected and the Voc of TSCs equals the sum of sub-cell Vocs. However, when combining different metals with various organic materials, the recombination contact efficiency is highly dependent on the materials,124,139 potentially due to the influence of interface dipoles occurring between metal and organics140 or doping effects of the metal.141Fig. 11c shows the energy diagram of TSCs connected by doped HTL and ETL. The high recombination efficiency from high doping concentrations eliminates the splitting of quasi-Femi level, and thus the Voc of TSCs equals the sum of the Vocs of the two sub-cells.

5. Spectral response characterization of TSCs
Spectral response measurement especially EQE (external quantum efficiency) is a vital procedure to evaluate the performance of TSCs, which is carried out under the standard measuring conditions, namely, 25 °C, illumination intensity of 1000 W m−2 with an AM1.5G spectrum for solar cells.142 For the characterization of TSCs, initially, spectral mismatch correction is carried out with a spectrum-adjustable solar simulator with at least as many individually adjustable light sources as sub-cells in the multi-junction device under test through iterative measurement procedure142 or by mathematical procedures, which requires a multi-source simulator set-up allowing variation of the intensity of the individual light sources without changing their spectral distribution in ref. 143 The mismatch factor for each sub-cell is identified after measuring the spectral distribution of light source of solar simulator by a spectroradiometer, and thus the current balances are calculated. Also, the constraint current balance for a reasonable limit is usually 3% and minimal spectral mismatch error is 1%.142,144
For the J–V characterization of TSCs, access to each sub-cell spectral response, J–V characteristics, and Voc makes it much easier. Hence, three solutions have been proposed to characterize the Voc: (i) apply spectral response measurement under specific bias illumination and bias voltage to get characteristics of sub-cell without any changes to TSCs,145 (ii) insert an intermediate conductive interlayer to extract current or voltage from each sub-cell separately144 and (iii) insert a third electrode situated outside the active layer to contact the recombination layer.145
EQE measurement, as an important part of the standard protocol, is to assess the device spectra response and to cross-check the photo-current densities tested under the solar simulator.142,144 The EQE test principle involves saturating one sub-cell with a proper monochromatic bias light to measure the other current-limiting sub-cell simultaneously. The selection of bias light can be based on the absorption profile of the photoactive layer or the individually measured spectral response of a single-junction cell with the absorber adopted by sub-cells of TSCs. This approach is appropriate when the absorption profiles of absorber materials show insignificant overlap.146,147 Gilot et al. proposed several points in testing the EQE of TSCs,145,147 where to characterize the EQE of one sub-cell, several requirements have to be satisfied: (i) according to the spectral response of absorber materials, the appropriate monochromatic bias wavelength and the decent bias light intensity should be decided to generate enough superabundant charge carriers to supply recombination partners for all charge carriers from the current-limiting sub-cell. (ii) Under monochromatic bias light, the optically saturated sub-cell leads an electrical field into the current limiting sub-cell. To prevent misjudgment of the Jsc of the current-limiting sub-cell, an external voltage (defined as V2), which is estimated according to single-junction reference cells under the same working conditions, has to be applied to compensate the electrical field. (iii) The overall photogenerated current density should match the photocurrent density generated under AM1.5 illumination (working conditions) to prevent misjudgment of Jsc and EQE due to declined charge carrier interplay, and hence a change of the recombination regimes.
Optical field simulations have been adopted to confirm the optimum monochromatic bias wavelength;148 however, are not suitable for good bias light intensity and V2 estimation. Yusoff et al. calculated the EQEs of the sub-cells from the internal quantum efficiencies of single-junction cells and the simulated sub-cell absorption.148,149 Gilot introduced an additional metal-like electrode separating the sub-cells (shown in Fig. 12) in parallel TSCs to detect the open-circuit voltage of the sub-cell. This method is consistent with the conclusion of the EQE detection by using bias light without interfering with the light incoupling of the cell.145 The shortcoming of the metal-like electrode is that it does not provide direct access to the Jsc of the sole sub-cell.

All rights reserved. 
Unlike parallel TSCs, one of the critical issues of series-connected TSCs, especially homo-TSCs (TSCs with two identical sub-cells), is the difficulty to test the performance of a single sub-cell. It is worth mentioning that the PCE of homo-TSCs has already approached 11.3% based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM. However, in homo-TSCs, as the active layer absorbs the same wavelength spectrum, the bias light wavelength determination can no longer follow the test method as common TSCs (refers to hetero-TSCs, TSCs with different sub-cells).150 Therefore the characterization of homo-TSCs has become a more complicated issue, such as being not able to test the individual sub-cell EQE curve151 or the Jsc contributed either by the front sub-cell or rear sub-cell. In homo-TSCs, to generate excessive charge carriers in the optically biased sub-cell, the optical field distribution and the competition of the sub-cells for photon harvesting at the chosen monochromatic bias wavelength have to be considered to guarantee that the EQE measured on TSCs truly reproduces the EQE of the current-limiting sub-cell. Alexander Colsmann introduced a transparent polymer electrode to study sub-cell photocurrent density without changing the optical and electrical properties.150 By using a c-PEDOT:PSS/m-PEDOT:PSS bilayer with similar thickness instead of the non-conductive m-PEDOT:PSS layer, an additional intermediate electrode was constructed with unchanged optical and electrical properties. The three-terminal device (Fig. 13b) becomes an alternative to the two-terminal device (Fig. 13a). This structure can experimentally enable the determination of the monochromatic bias light wavelength and intensity as well as the bias voltage V′.

To decide the required bias light intensity during the EQE test, the bias light generated current density for saturating the optically biased sub-cell needs to be estimated. In hetero-TSCs, this saturation of the optically biased sub-cell can be achieved by selective stimulation using bias light from the exclusive absorption wavelength region. While, in homo-TSCs (taking a homo-TSC with PTB7-Th absorbers as an example), under the measurement of a given wavelength of bias light (e.g., 500 nm), for low bias light illumination Jbias, tandem ≈ 0, no saturation of the optically biased sub-cell occurs, which is reflected in JEQE, tandem approaching the two-terminal tandem device EQE current density. With bias light intensity increasing (i.e., increasing Jbias, tandem), the EQE current density gradually approaches the EQE current density JEQE,2 of the current-limiting sub-cell. From this simulation (Fig. 14a), it is speculated that the current density generated by the monochromatic bias light (Jbias, tandem) has to be orders of magnitude higher than the current density generated by the EQE probe light (JEQE,2). Hence, the bias light intensity (at which saturation occurs) is remarkably higher than often expected. By adding the voltages for a given device current density, following Kirchhoff's law, the TSC's J–V curves from the J–V curves of the sub-cells for two illumination scenarios, including under bias light (Jbias, tandem) and under bias light plus probe-light illumination (Jbias, tandem + JEQE, tandem), can be calculated according the method previously reported.152 The difference in both tandem current densities lies in the expected measurable EQE device current density JEQE, tandem under illumination by probe light. If the competition between the two sub-cells for photons at a certain wavelength is too fierce, the bias light intensity has to be rather high, which potentially exceeds the AM1.5 equivalent intensity for the solar cell. Therefore, it is suggested to choose a bias-wavelength featuring low enough competition for photon absorption, and thus the bias light choice is indirectly narrowed.
 Fig. 14  (a) Simulation of the saturation behavior of the bottom cell (JEQE current densities were chosen at 500 nm EQE probe light); (b) symmetric J–V curves of both sub-cells under 700 nm monochromatic bias light illumination.150 Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 150, Copyright© 2015, John Wiley and Sons. 
During the EQE test, oversimplifying the bias voltage, such as applying an open-circuit voltage or not applying any bias voltage, leads to an imprecise EQE. For the choice of bias voltage, an intermediate transparent polymer electrode enables the direct measurement of a single sub-cell. By short-circuiting the introduced third electrode and the corresponding electrode of each sub-cell under the bias light illumination determined above, the obtained voltage is the expected bias voltage for EQE characterization (Fig. 14b).
For a TSC without a third electrode contacting the recombination layer, when the EQE is conducted under illumination of a bias light matching the absorber of the optically biased sub-cell (sub-cell 1), sub-cell 1 will be working close to its Voc. Thus, during the EQE measurement of sub-cell 2 without applying a bias voltage, Vbias, the TSC is at short-circuited condition, while sub-cell 2 is at reverse bias (circular symbol), shown in Fig. 15a, resulting in an overestimated spectral response of sub-cell 2. However, by applying a forward bias voltage, the J–V curve of the tandem solar cell is moved towards negative voltages (dashed lines) such that sub-cell 2 will be at short-circuit condition (squared symbol) since it is necessary for a correct spectral response measurement.
 Fig. 15  Schematic description of the J–V characteristics of a tandem organic solar cell and its sub-cells. While measuring spectral response of sub-cell 2 without applying a bias voltage, Vbias, the tandem solar cell is at short circuit while sub-cell 2 is at reverse bias(circular symbol). The resulting spectral response will be overestimated. (a) By applying a bias voltage the J–V curve of the tandem solar is moved towards negative voltages (dashed lines) such that sub-cell 2 will be at short-circuit condition (square symbol) as it is necessary for a correct spectral response measurement and (b) since Vbias is hard to determine, an easy approximation is to use Vsubcell 1oc as the bias voltage. This leads to slight deviation compared to the use of Vbias.144 Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 144, Copyright© 2015, Springer Nature. 
If the bias light intensity is sufficiently high, sub-cell 1 is working close to its Voc at this illumination condition, regardless of the voltage of the TSC. In such a case, applying a bias voltage equal to the Voc of sub-cell 1 will enable sub-cell 2 to be at approximately short-circuit condition, under which the spectral response measurement can be carried out. However, special attention should be paid to avoid the big error from the FF of sub-cells and bias light intensity.144,145
6. Outlook
With the tireless efforts of researchers, the working mechanism of organic TSCs has become much clearer, providing guidance for the research on organic TSCs. Recently, numerous excellent donor and acceptor materials have been synthesized, which play a decisive role in enhancing the performance of organic TSCs. Thus, organic TSCs have been improving and their PCE reached over 17%. In the future, the development of polymer solar cells will have the following characteristics: (i) non-fullerene-based solar cells and full-solution processing technology will remain the focus of polymer TSCs since they provide prerequisite guarantee for the future large-scale processing of highly efficient cells, (ii) with lots of excellent interface layer materials and semitransparent electrode being designed and synthesized, flexible and semitransparent polymer TSCs will attract more attention in the near future and (iii) the stability of TSCs is a precondition for their application, and thus the stability problem will definitely need to be solved urgently in the future. With the efforts from around the world, TSCs will be fully developed to meet numerous functional needs.

 	Fig. 15  Schematic description of the J–V characteristics of a tandem organic solar cell and its sub-cells. While measuring spectral response of sub-cell 2 without applying a bias voltage, Vbias, the tandem solar cell is at short circuit while sub-cell 2 is at reverse bias(circular symbol). The resulting spectral response will be overestimated. (a) By applying a bias voltage the J–V curve of the tandem solar is moved towards negative voltages (dashed lines) such that sub-cell 2 will be at short-circuit condition (square symbol) as it is necessary for a correct spectral response measurement and (b) since Vbias is hard to determine, an easy approximation is to use Vsubcell 1oc as the bias voltage. This leads to slight deviation compared to the use of Vbias.144 Figures reproduced with permission from ref. 144, Copyright© 2015, Springer Nature.
