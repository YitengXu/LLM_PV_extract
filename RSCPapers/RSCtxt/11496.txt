Herein, free-standing mesoporous titanium nitride nanotube arrays (TiN NTAs) were fabricated to serve as a substrate for Pt loadings in trace amounts. TiN NTAs were prepared by thermal treatment of anodic TiO2 NTAs at 750 °C for 3 h in a NH3 atmosphere. The uniform TiN NTAs showed an inner diameter of ∼80 nm and a length of ∼7 μm, with many mesoporous holes ranging from 5 to 10 nm in diameter on the nanotube walls. Pt species dissolved from the Pt counter electrode in electrochemical cycling were redeposited on the mesoporous TiN NTAs to produce Pt-TiN NTAs with an ultra-low Pt loading of 8.3 μg cm−2. Pt-TiN NTAs exhibited 15-fold higher mass activity towards HER than the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C in acidic media, with an overpotential of 71 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope value of 46.4 mV dec−1 and excellent stability. The performance of Pt-TiN NTAs is also much better than that of Pt species deposited on non-mesoporous nanotube arrays due to the shortcuts originating from the mesoporous holes on the nanotube walls for electron and mass transfer.
1. Introduction
Replacing fossil fuels with various types of clean and renewable energy sources is vital to effectuate sustainable development.1 Renewable energies from solar, wind, and ocean tides have emerged as promising substitutes for fossil energy.2,3 However, these renewable resources are often intermittent and unpredictable. Recently, hydrogen has been considered to be the most promising fuel to substitute the conventional fossil fuel.4,5 Electrochemical water splitting is proven to be the most effective and sustainable approach to achieve industrialization and cheap production of hydrogen.6,7 Unfortunately, hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) usually show high overpotential, which is highly energy-consuming.8,9 The noble metal platinum exhibits high electrocatalytic activity towards HERs, but its widespread utilization is severely restricted by its scarcity and the skyrocketing prices.10–12 Therefore, two approaches for developing HER catalysts that are highly active and less expensive have been considered: (a) to develop non-precious electrocatalysts and (b) to alloy Pt with transition metals to reduce the usage of noble metals and the costs.13–16
Immobilization of the noble metal platinum in an active matrix can greatly enhance the electrocatalytic activity of nanocomposites.17,18 Various deposition methods19 such as chemical impregnation,20,21 thermal decomposition,22,23 and electrodeposition24,25 have been explored. The structure of the substrate for Pt loading is a key issue to utilize the ultra-high electrocatalytic activity of Pt species.26,27 Free-standing one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures are of particular interest for trace Pt loading due to their merits such as high surface area, direct electron transfer pathway and strong adhesion to the supporting materials.28,29 Titanium-based oxides and nitrides have been intensively developed to construct highly ordered nanostructures.30,31 Anodic TiO2, an n-type semiconductor with a wide band gap of ∼3.2 eV, has been extensively investigated in the field of energy conversion.32,33 In particular, highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2 NTAs) obtained from electrochemical anodization have been exploited for electrocatalyst loading.34,35 This uniform 1D nanostructure can offer abundant active sites for catalytic reactions.36–38 However, the low electrical conductivity of TiO2 semiconductors limits the transmission of electrons in electrocatalysis.39,40 Moreover, the nanotubes of TiO2 NTAs are non-mesoporous on the side walls, so that electrons and protons are transported along the tube wall in one dimension.41,42 The mass and electron transfer will become much faster if there are many mesoporous holes distributed on the nanotube walls. The mesoporous holes provide shortcuts for the transportation.
Herein, we present a novel nanostructure composed of free-standing mesoporous titanium nitride nanotube arrays (TiN NTAs) for Pt loading in trace amounts. Nitrogen-doped anodic TiO2 nanotubes have been fabricated previously by annealing in a NH3 atmosphere to enhance the photochemical, electrical and catalytic properties.43–46 In this work, TiO2 NTAs were treated in a NH3 atmosphere at a high temperature of 750 °C to further etch the nanotubes to prepare mesoporous TiN NTAs. The uniform TiN NTAs had an inner diameter of ∼80 nm and a length of ∼7 μm, with many mesoporous holes ranging from 5 to 10 nm in diameter on the nanotube walls. This unique nanostructure perfectly addresses the disadvantages of TiO2 NTAs for electrocatalytic applications. TiN NTAs are highly conductive for electron transfer. The nanotubes become interconnected via mesoporous holes. This unique 3D nanostructure effectively decreases the interfacial resistance between nanotubes and promotes the transfer of electrons and molecules. Pt species were introduced into the TiN NTAs by electrochemical deposition to fabricate Pt-TiN NTAs, with an ultra-low Pt loading of 8.3 μg cm−2. The Pt-TiN NTAs exhibited much higher mass activity towards HER than the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C and excellent stability. The performance of Pt-TiN NTAs is also much better than that of Pt species loaded on non-mesoporous nanotube arrays, due to the shortcuts originating from the mesoporous holes on the nanotube walls for mass and electron transfer.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Fabrication of Pt-TiN NTAs
All chemicals were of analytical grade and used to prepare solutions without further purification. A titanium foil (0.89 mm thick, 99.7% purity, Alfa Aesar) was sliced into square pieces with a geometric area of 10 × 10 mm2. The titanium foil was mechanically polished with sandpaper and carefully cleaned in acetone, ethanol and distilled water, respectively, under sonication. The foil was then immersed in a bath containing distilled water, hydrogen fluoride, and hydrogen nitrate in a volume ratio of 5:1:4 for 5 min to remove impurities and oxide layers on the surface. Electrochemical anodization was conducted in a two-electrode electrochemical cell, with a graphite foil as the cathode and the titanium foil as the anode. Anodic TiO2 films were generated at 60 V and 20 °C for 30 min in an ethylene glycol solution containing 0.5 wt% ammonium fluoride, 5 vol% methanol and 5 vol% distilled water with a direct current power supply (IT6152, ITECH, Nanjing, China). After electrochemical anodization, the foil was rinsed with distilled water to remove the residual electrolyte, subsequently dried in a nitrogen stream and annealed in a tube furnace at 450 °C for 3 h in air, which was named TiO2 NTAs. Then, the TiO2 NTAs were further annealed in a NH3 atmosphere at 750 °C for 3 h to obtain mesoporous TiN NTAs. The Pt-TiN NTAs were synthesized via electrodeposition controlled using a CHI 660E potentiostat (CH Instruments Inc., Austin, TX, USA) with a standard three-electrode configuration, containing 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The mesoporous TiN NTAs, a Pt wire electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode served as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical deposition process was performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with successive 1500 cycle scans, using a potential window between −1.0 and −0.2 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.
2.2 Fabrication of Pt–C/TiO2 NTAs, Pt-TiO2 NTAs, Pt–H-TiO2 NTAs and Pt/C electrode
For comparison, non-mesoporous nanotube arrays with no mesoporous holes on the side walls were fabricated for Pt loading and HER evaluation. TiO2 NTAs were immersed in a 0.02 M glucose solution within a sealed Teflon-lined steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated to 200 °C for 10 h and then cooled naturally. The foil was rinsed several times with distilled water and carbonized in a tube furnace at 550 °C for 3 h under nitrogen flow at a flow rate of 20 sccm, which was named C/TiO2 NTAs. Using the same electrochemical deposition procedures, Pt species were deposited on C/TiO2 NTAs and TiO2 NTAs. The obtained materials were named Pt–C/TiO2 NTAs and Pt-TiO2 NTAs, respectively. TiO2 NTAs further annealed at 750 °C in air for 3 h was named H-TiO2 NTAs. Using the same electrochemical deposition procedures, Pt species were deposited on H-TiO2 NTAs and the material was named Pt–H-TiO2 NTAs.
A Pt/C electrode was also prepared for comparison. In detail, 15 mg of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) was dispersed in a mixture of 950 μL ethanol and 50 μL Nafion solution, followed by ultrasonication for 30 min. The mixture was then dropped onto the surface of the nickel foam (10 mm × 10 mm) and dried at 50 °C. The mass loading of Pt/C is about 1.5 mg cm−2, which amounts to 0.3 mg cm−2 of Pt mass loading.
2.3 Material characterization
The morphology and structure of the products were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova 450 NanoSEM, FEI, USA) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100 UHR STEM/EDS, JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a XRD-7000S diffractometer (Shimadzu) to analyze the phase structure. The surface chemical compositions were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and collected using an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer (ThermoFisher USA). All binding energies of the XPS curves were calibrated with reference to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was carried out using a PerkinElmer NexION 300X to calculate the Pt mass loading on the catalysts.
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical experiments were performed using a CHI 660E electrochemical analyzer in 0.5 M H2SO4. With a three-electrode configuration, the as-fabricated product served as the working electrode, and a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode served as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All the potentials mentioned in this work were calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 pH + 0.21 V. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at the open circuit potential. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was further measured from the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) on the basis of CV sweeping in the potential range without a redox process between 0.22 and 0.37 V (vs. RHE) at varying rates from 20 to 200 mV s−1. The Cdl values were obtained by plotting ΔJ at 0.3 V (vs. RHE) against the scan rates. The long-term stability was tested by chronopotentiometric measurements at η = −200 mV (vs. RHE) at a current density of 100 mA cm−2 for 24 h.
3. Results and discussion
SEM was utilized to examine the morphology of the prepared materials. As shown in Fig. 1A, highly ordered TiO2 NTAs were vertically aligned on the Ti foil after electrochemical anodization. Fig. 1A (a) shows that the nanotube wall of TiO2 NTAs is very smooth. The TiO2 NTAs possess a tubular shape with an inner diameter of around 80 nm and a length of ∼7 μm (Fig. 1A (b)). As shown in Fig. 1B (a), the morphology of the nanotubes was converted to mesoporous nanotubes after thermal treatment under NH3 flow at 750 °C for 3 h. The inner diameter was still ∼80 nm and length ∼7 μm for a nanotube. Many mesoporous holes with a diameter ranging from 5 to 10 nm emerged on the nanotube walls. After treatment under the flow of NH3 for 1 h (Fig. S1A†), the mesoporous holes began to form on the nanotube wall. When treated in a NH3 atmosphere for 3 h, mesoporous holes penetrate through the entire side wall. After treatment under the flow of NH3 for 6 h, mesoporous holes on the side wall become larger with a diameter ranging from 10 to 20 nm (Fig. S1B†). Polarization curves show that TiN NTAs treated under NH3 flow for 3 h exhibit the highest catalytic activity towards HERs with the same electrodeposition procedures to load Pt species (Fig. S2†). Hence, subsequent electrodeposition of Pt species was performed on the TiN NTAs fabricated under NH3 flow for 3 h. After electrochemical cycling to deposit platinum, the morphology of Pt-TiN NTAs changes negligibly (Fig. 1C). The morphologies of Pt–C/TiO2 NTAs and Pt-TiO2 NTAs are shown in Fig. S3.† No obvious mesopores and platinum nanoparticles can be observed. The crystalline structure and chemical composition were detected by XRD. From the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 1D, strong TiN signals indicate that TiO2 NTAs were converted into TiN NTAs after thermal treatment under NH3 flow. After high-temperature annealing at 750 °C, rutile TiO2 appears in TiN NTAs (JCPDS no. 21-1276). Fig. S4† shows the XRD patterns of TiN NTAs annealed in a tube furnace at 750 °C under NH3 flow for different durations. TiN NTAs have evident peaks located at 36.8 and 42.8°, indexed as the (111) and (200) planes of cubic TiN (JCPDS no. 65-5774). The characteristic peaks of TiN NTAs fabricated under NH3 flow for 3 h are stronger than 1 h and 6 h-TiN NTAs, implying that most TiN is exposed. No obvious characteristic peaks of Pt appeared, owing to its ultra-low mass ratio and high dispersity in the nanocomposite.

XRD patterns (D) of TiO2 NTAs, TiN NTAs and Pt-TiN NTAs. The peak annotation corresponds to the crystal structure (A (anatase) and R (rutile)). 
More insights into the microstructures of Pt-TiN NTAs were gained by TEM. Fig. 2A demonstrates that the nanotube wall of the TiN NTAs is mesoporous with many holes along the sidewalls, which is clearly different from the smooth nanotube wall of TiO2 NTAs. Fig. 2B further reveals lattice spacings of 0.21 nm and 0.24 nm corresponding to the (200) and (111) planes of cubic TiN.47,48 The selected mapping area is shown in Fig. 2C. The elemental mapping shown in Fig. 2D suggests that Ti, O, N and Pt are uniformly distributed across the nanotube wall. Furthermore, the Pt content is by far less than those of Ti, O and N in Pt-TiN NTAs. Fig. S5† shows the image of multiple nanotubes of Pt-TiN NTAs and the corresponding platinum element mapping image. Most Pt species are highly dispersed in nanotubes. A small amount of Pt species aggregated to form Pt nanoparticles, with a diameter of 5–15 nm. This heterostructure with atomic Pt segregation can efficiently utilize the high activity of Pt species and will bring great benefits for HER.

The surface chemical states of Pt-TiN NTAs were analyzed by XPS. The survey spectrum in Fig. 3A depicts that elements of Pt, C, N, Ti and O are observed in Pt-TiN NTAs. The high-resolution spectra of the surface Ti 2p shown in Fig. 3B exhibits Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 peaks maximum centered at 464.65 eV and 458.65 eV, indicating the absolute coordination of Ti4+.49 The spectrum was fitted by considering two resolved doublets (with a spin–orbit splitting of ∼5.7 eV between 2p1/2 and 2p3/2). The characteristic peaks were present at 461.81 eV and 455.85 eV, relating to Ti3+ (Ti–N). Due to the presence of oxygen atoms in the crystal lattice, the characteristic peaks were set at 463.45 eV and 457.15 eV, which could be assigned to Ti3+ (Ti–N–O).50 The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3C) was fitted with three peaks, located at 530.2 eV, 531.3 eV and 532.5 eV, which corresponded to Ti2O3, non-lattice oxygen/OH and surface chemisorbed oxygen, respectively.51,52 The N 1s spectra shown in Fig. 3D also confirms the chemical bonding structure of Ti–N–O and Ti–N at binding energies of 397.15 eV and 396.25 eV, respectively. The characteristic peaks centered at binding energies of 398.8 eV and 401.8 eV were assigned to pyrrolic N and graphitic N.53–55 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Pt is shown in Fig. 3E. The Pt 4f has a spin–orbit splitting (Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2) located at 71.25 and 74.58 eV, respectively. The most intense doublet Pt 4f peaks were attributed to metallic Pt0.56 In addition, two weak peaks centered at 72.36 and 76.22 eV, which were ascribed to Pt2+.57

ICP-MS was performed to analyze the mass activity of Pt. As shown in Fig. 4, the Pt-TiN NTAs with a Pt mass loading of 8.3 μg cm−2 exhibit a high mass activity of 2.84 A mg−1, which is approximately 2 times higher than that of Pt–C/TiO2 NTAs (with a Pt mass loading of 4.94 μg cm−2) and 15-folds greater than that of the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C (0.18 A mg−1).

Polarization curves were conducted to evaluate the catalytic activities of the samples. As shown in Fig. 5A, C/TiO2 NTAs exhibit a high overpotential of 788 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. TiN NTAs electrode shows a relatively low overpotential of 743 mV. It should be attributed to Ti3+ in TiN NTAs that can promote to form a self-hydrogenated shell to reduce the activation barrier of H2.58 As illustrated in Fig. S6,† TiN NTA electrodes show a high overpotential, which is highly energy-consuming for water splitting. After Pt deposition, the electrodes exhibited much improved catalytic activity with a considerably smaller overpotential (Fig. 5A). The superior HER catalytic activity should be attributed to the trace amount of Pt species loaded on the mesoporous TiN NTAs. The Pt wire electrode serves as the counter electrode during electrochemical cycling in a 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. Trace amounts of Pt species can be dissolved in the process and can be redeposited on the mesoporous TiN NTAs that serve as the working electrode. Fig. 5B displays the polarization curves of platinum deposited on different substrates. Platinum deposited on TiN NTAs has the smallest overpotential than other substrates. The variations in the HER activity should be attributed to the unique mesoporous structure of mesoporous TiN NTAs and the existence of Ti3+. The mesoporous holes on the nanotube walls promote the mass and electron transfer between Pt species and electrolytes, thereby resulting in much improved HER performance. The Tafel slope can provide insights into the mechanistic pathways of HER. As shown in Fig. 5C, the Tafel slope of Pt-TiN NTAs is 46.4 mV dec−1, revealing a possible Volmer–Heyrovský mechanism in which electrochemical desorption determines the reaction rate.59 In detail:Volmer step: H+ + e− → HadsHeyrovský step: Hads + H+ + e− → H2

The electrochemical discharge step produces adsorbed hydrogen atoms (Hads), and then, Hads reacts with one surface hydrogen and one hydrated proton. Hads follows the Heyrovský reaction, rather than the Tafel step (2Hads → H2), which unambiguously proved that the active sites of the catalyst are highly dispersed on the catalyst surface, just like Pt.60 The overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and the corresponding Tafel slopes of various TiO2-based electrocatalysts are listed in Table 1 and Fig. 5D,61–68 suggesting the high efficiency of Pt-TiN NTAs in HERs.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was conducted to examine the electrode/electrolyte interface and the electrochemical processes on the surface in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. Fig. 6A reveals that TiN NTAs and Pt-TiN NTAs exhibited the capacitive behavior at a low frequency range owing to the slope of nearly 90°. The inset of Fig. 6A is an equivalent circuit diagram, including ohmic resistance (RΩ), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), constant phase elements (CPE) and Warburg diffusion impedance (W).69 Generally, the higher slope implies the faster charge transfer of the catalysts. The slope at low frequencies reveals the faster electron transfer at TiN NTAs and Pt-TiN NTAs, which is conducive to the fast kinetics of the HER. It is generally accepted that the fast charge transfer kinetics result from a small charge transfer resistance (Rct). Therefore, the Rct values of TiN NTAs and Pt-TiN NTAs are the smallest as compared with the other materials. The outsets observed at high frequencies correspond to the charge transfer limiting process. The RΩ values were determined by the initial non-zero intercept at the real axis at the beginning of the semicircle. The outsets of Fig. 6B observed at high frequencies demonstrate that the RΩ value of TiN NTAs is much smaller than that of TiO2 NTAs, and the RΩ value of Pt-TiN NTAs is much smaller than that of Pt–C/TiO2 NTAs. The results of the small RΩ and Rct values unambiguously prove that TiN NTAs and Pt-TiN NTAs are feasible for interfacial charge transfer in HERs.

The ECSA of the catalysts is a key extrinsic factor that affects the intrinsic activity. Cdl measurements, calculated by CV curves at different scan rates of 20 to 200 mV s−1 (S7 A–D†), offer a general and nondestructive alternative to value ECSA. As shown in Fig. 7, the specific capacitance of TiO2 NTAs was calculated to be 3.8 mF cm−2. TiN NTAs show a much higher value of 52.4 mF cm−2, which suggests that nanotubes have enlarged active surface area and proper porosity annealing after exposure to a NH3 atmosphere. After Pt deposition, the capacitance value of Pt-TiN NTAs increases to 67.9 mF cm−2. Such a high ECSA of Pt-TiN NTAs will be undoubtedly beneficial towards Pt loading and electrocatalytic performance.70 Furthermore, the durability of the electrodes for long-term H2 production is evaluated by electrolysis at a constant potential (Fig. 8). The chronopotentiometric curve of Pt-TiN NTAs shows negligible degradation after 24 h, implying that Pt-TiN NTAs can be applied for long-term practical applications. The curves of Pt-TiO2 NTAs and Pt–C/TiO2 NTAs show obvious fluctuations, illustrating the lower stability of these materials.

4. Conclusion
In summary, Pt-TiN NTAs have been fabricated with an ultra-low Pt mass loading of 8.3 μg cm−2 for enhanced HER activities. Uniform TiO2 NTAs have been prepared by electrochemical anodization. After annealing under NH3 flow, TiO2 NTAs were converted into TiN NTAs with many mesoporous holes with a diameter ranging from 5 to 10 nm on the nanotube wall. Highly dispersed Pt species were then introduced into TiN NTAs by electrochemical cycling to fabricate Pt-TiN NTAs. The mass activity towards HERs at Pt-TiN NTAs is 15-fold higher than that of the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C. The excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability should be attributed to the highly dispersed Pt species anchored on the mesoporous scaffold, the high surface area and the highly conductive TiN NTA substrate. The mesoporous nanostructure provides more active sites than non-mesoporous nanotube arrays and facile electrolyte penetration channels that can effectively decrease the interfacial resistance between nanotubes and promote the transfer of electrons and molecules. Our work demonstrated that the mesoporous self-supporting material with ultra-low Pt loadings will be an efficient catalyst of choice for hydrogen energy.
