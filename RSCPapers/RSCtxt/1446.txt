    , Accepted 26th March 2021First published on 27th March 2021AbstractTwo new cyanopyridinone-capped 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives, 5,5′,5′′,5′′′-(([9,9′-bifluorenylidene]-3,3′,6,6′-tetrayltetrakis(4-hexylthiophene-5,2-diyl))tetrakis(methanylylidene)) tetrakis(1-butyl-4-methyl-2,6-dioxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carbonitrile) (A1) and 5,5′,5′′,5′′′-(([9,9′-bifluorenylidene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetrayltetrakis(4-octylthiophene-5,2-diyl))tetrakis (methanylylidene))tetrakis(1-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-methyl-2,6-dioxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carbonitrile) (A2), were synthesized as non-fullerene small molecular acceptors for organic solar cells. The compounds exhibited excellent solubility in a variety of common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, toluene and o-dichlorobenzene due to possessing different length alkyl chains on the thiophene-bridged groups and the cyanopyridinone units. The introduction of the strong electron-withdrawing cyanopyridinone groups as the capping groups can improve the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and thus broaden the absorption spectra of the molecules. By changing the connection points of the capping groups in the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene core, the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the compounds can be easily adjusted. The photovoltaic performance of A1 and A2 as acceptors was investigated by fabricating solar cells with the following structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:A1(or A2)/PDTNO/Al. The results showed that power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 1.01% and 1.98% were obtained using A1 and A2, respectively, as the acceptors without any treatment. After treating the active layers with solvent vapor annealing, their PCEs were increased to 1.28% and 2.94%, respectively.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, the consumption of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas is increasing, but fossil fuels are a finite resource. Therefore, it is urgent to find renewable energy resources as cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. Among the renewable energy resources, organic solar cells (OSCs) have been widely studied due to their low cost, light weight and mechanical flexibility.1–3 As the key part of OSCs, the active layer of the bulk-heterojunction is composed of an electron donor and an electron acceptor, which are jointly responsible for the light absorption, energy transfer and exciton dissociation.4,5 With the continuous development of active layer materials and device fabrication technologies, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has increased from the initial single digit to over than 17% today.6–8 This shows that, by constantly exploring new non-fullerene acceptor materials (NFAs), the commercial applications of OSCs can be made possible. Research studies have shown that the ideal matching donor/acceptor materials can match the solar spectrum as closely as possible, improve photon utilization and light current density,9–11 ensure efficient energy-transfer and exciton dissociation,12,13 and finally realize high efficiency organic solar cells.
Fullerene derivatives such as PC61BM and PC71BM are the most widely used receptors for organic solar cells due to their strong electron acceptability and excellent electron mobility,13–16 and organic solar cells based on fullerene derivatives have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 11%.17 However, the defects of fullerene derivatives such as poor solubility in common organic solvents, poor energy level tenability and intrinsic weak light absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum limit their further application in organic solar cells. In order to solve the defects of fullerene derivatives, researchers have exploited non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) to substitute the fullerene derivatives.18–22 NFAs have flexible molecular structures and can be easily tailored using purposeful molecular engineering to work with different donors in both optical complementarity and energetic compatibility.23–25 In the past few years, some representative efficient NFAs, such as the fused-ring A–D–A small molecules ITIC and IDIC,26,27 and benzothiadiazole-core-based fused-unit dithienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole molecule Y6,28 have been successfully developed.
It is well known that the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene core is a dimerized fluorene structure linked by a double bond between the 9 and 9′ carbon atoms of two fluorene units and could accept one electron easily. The molecular conformation of 9,9′-bifluorenylidene is exactly same as the structure of aromatic fragments of the fullerene, and 9,9′-bifluorenylidene has stable photophysical properties and an excellent electron accepting ability. In addition, 9,9′-bifluorenylidene can be easily chemically modified to construct small molecular non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells. Similar to the core of 9,9′-bifluorenylidene, which is a three-dimensional structure, tetraphenylethylene, spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] and triphenylamine had been often used as the electron-donor building blocks of NFAs.29–31 The three-dimensional structure can inhibit the strong aggregation between molecules, while maintaining the extension in each direction and effective conjugation to obtain a better photon capture.
Cyanopyridinone (CP) unit has a strong accepting strength and flexible structure, and was used as an electron-deficient unit for building NFAs in OSCs.29,31–33 D. Srivani et al.32 designed a A–A–A type receptor material N6 by combining naphthalene diimide (NDI) and CP groups and achieved a PCE of 6.10% when paired with P3HT.
Based on our continuous research interests in the non-fullerene acceptors based on the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene core,24,34 and taking into account the strong accepting strength of cyanopyridone (CP), in this report two new cyanopyridinone-capped 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives (A1 and A2) were synthesized as non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells (Fig. 1). Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated, and the photovoltaic performance of the solution-processed organic solar cells using PBDB-T (poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)]) as the electron donor and the compounds A1 and A2 as the electron acceptors was investigated.

2.3 Device fabrication
OSCs with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/PDINO/Al were fabricated. The ITO substrate was cleaned with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath sequentially for 15 min. After cleaning, it was dried by blowing nitrogen and treated with UV exposure for 30 min in a UV-ozone apparatus. The active layer solution of the PBDB-T/acceptor with a mass ratio of 1:1 was dissolved in chlorobenzene and prepared as a solution of 20 mg mL−1, which was stirred at room temperature. PEDOT:PSS solution was coated on the ITO glass substrate at 4500 rpm, and annealed at 160 °C for 15 min. The active layer solution was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form the active layer. After treating the active layer with different treatment processes, PDINO (3,3′-(1,3,8,10-tetraoxo-1,3,8,10-tetrahydroanthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-2,9-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine oxide)) alcohol solution was spin-coated on the active layer at a rotational speed of 3500 rpm. Finally, the Al electrode of 100 nm was deposited in vacuum. The effective area of each OSCs is controlled at 0.1 cm2.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under simulated 100 mW cm−2 irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were analysed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis
The synthetic routes and procedures of the compounds A1 and A2 are shown in Scheme 1 and Experimental section.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes for the 9,9′-BF derivatives A1 and A2. 
The end-capped groups, cyanopyridinone derivatives I and II, were prepared according to the literature with good yields.35 The key intermediates VI and VII were synthesized through four reaction steps. First, 2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-one or 3,6-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-one was converted into the corresponding fluorene-diboronic esters. The corresponding fluorenone derivatives with alkyl-substituted thiophenes were synthesized from Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of the corresponding fluorenone-diboronic esters with the corresponding 3-alkyl-substituted-2-bromo-thiophene under a base condition with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst, then followed by the self-coupling method of the corresponding fluorenone derivatives with alkyl-substituted thiophenes in the presence of Lawesson's reagent to give the corresponding 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (9,9′-BF) derivatives with alkyl-substituted thiophenes. Finally, the classic Vilsmeier-Hacck formylation reaction was used to introduce the aldehyde groups onto the thiophene units of the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (9,9′-BF) derivatives with alkyl-substituted thiophenes as the reactive active sites.
The target compound A1 or A2 was synthesized by Knoevenagel-condensation reaction of intermediate VI or VII with an excess amount of end-capped group I or II in the presence of pyridine and chloroform, respectively. The target compounds A1 and A2 were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy. These compounds exhibited excellent solubility in common solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, toluene and chlorobenzene, due to the presence of long alkyl chains on the thiophene rings and end-capped groups.
3.2 Thermal stabilities and photophysical and electrochemical properties of the compounds A1 and A2
The thermal stability of A1 and A2 was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under nitrogen atmosphere, and the TGA results are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, the compounds exhibited good thermal stability up to 300 °C, and at 311 °C and 435 °C, the TGA curves of the compounds showed two obvious weight losses, indicating that both compounds had undergone two large-stage decomposition processes. The thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) of A1 and A2 were 306 and 307 °C (<5% weight loss), respectively. The result indicates that both the compounds have good thermal stability and can be used in practical applications of OSCs.

The absorption capacity of the active layer to sunlight determines the Jsc of the photovoltaic device to some extent, which plays an important role in device performance. The UV-vis absorption spectra of A1 and A2 in chloroform solutions and solid thin films are shown in Fig. 3, and their photophysical data are listed in Table 1. In chloroform solution, compound A1 exhibited a weak absorption band below 350 nm in the high energy region and three strong absorption bands at 450, 498 and 585 nm (Fig. 3(A)). In the absorption spectrum of compound A2 in chloroform solution, a weak absorption band below 350 nm in the high energy region and a strong absorption band at 493 nm were observed. The absorption band below 350 nm in the high energy region was mainly attributed to the π → π* transition by the conjugated double bonds in the molecular skeletons, while the absorption bands in the range of 370–700 nm were mainly assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect of the donor–acceptor in the molecules.24 On comparing the absorption spectra of the two compounds in the range of 370–700 nm, it can be seen that the absorption bands of compound A1 were obviously widened. This was attributed to the fact that compound A2 has a stronger steric hindrance between the donor core (9,9′-BF) and the electron-withdrawing groups compared with compound A1, which reduces the planarity of the A2 molecule. Theoretically, this steric hindrance is beneficial to reducing the excessive aggregation of molecules and forming a good active layer morphology. In addition, the decrease of the ICT effect could lead to widening the optical bandgap of the molecule and narrowing the absorption range to solar light, resulting in the weakening of the absorption of sunlight. With increase in steric hindrance, the molar extinction coefficient (ε) of A1 and A2 decreased from 8.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1 to 7.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1. As shown in Fig. 3(B), compounds A1 and A2 in solid thin films exhibited broad absorption bands in the range of 370–800 nm and 370–700 nm, respectively. Compared with their maximum absorption bands in the corresponding solutions, the maximum absorption peaks of A1 and A2 in solid thin films were red-shifted by 18 and 7 nm, respectively. The red-shift and broadening of their absorption bands could be attributed to the interaction between molecules and the aggregation of molecules after the formation of thin films. The degree of red-shift is influenced by the degree of molecular aggregation, which can prove that the strong steric hindrance effect in A2 molecule inhibited the aggregation of molecules. The optical band edges of A1 and A2 in solid thin films were estimated to be ca. 778 and 690 nm; thus, their optical bandgaps (Eoptg) were calculated to be 1.60 and 1.80 eV, respectively, from equation: Eoptg = 1241/λabs-onset.

The electrochemical properties of A1 and A2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves of the compounds are shown in Fig. 4, and their electrochemical data are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 4, the first oxidation potential (Eox) values of A1 and A2 were 1.04 and 0.93 V, respectively. Under the same conditions, the Fc/Fc+ potential was found to be 0.39 V. The HOMO energy levels of A1 and A2 were estimated to be −5.45 and −5.34 eV according to the equation:36EHOMO = −e(Eox – EFc/Fc+ + 4.8) (eV), where Eox is the onset oxidation potential (V) versus Ag/Ag+. The LUMO energy levels of A1 and A2 were calculated to be −3.85 and −3.54 eV from the equation: ELUMO = (EHOMO + Eoptg) (eV).

The structures of the compounds A1 and A2 were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set to calculate their frontier molecular orbitals. The electron-density distributions of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the compounds are depicted in Fig. 5. The electron-density distribution in the HOMO energy level of A1 was mainly concentrated in the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene core, a small portion of electron density resided on the thiophene-bridged rings and the cyanopyridone units. The electron-density distribution in its LUMO energy level was similar to that in the HOMO energy level, but electrons located on the cyanopyridone units was very few. The electron density in the HOMO energy level of A2 completely distributed on one side of the skeleton of A2 molecule (including fluorene ring, thiophene-bridged rings and the cyanopyridone units), while in its LUMO energy level, most electron densities resided on the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene core, and a small number of electron densities located on the thiophene-bridged ring and the adjacent cyanopyridone unit. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of A1 and A2 were −5.97/−3.89 and −5.90/−3.64 eV, respectively.

3.3 Photovoltaic properties
By preparing OSCs with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/PDINO/Al, the photovoltaic properties of these compounds as the acceptors were investigated, in which PBDB-T was used as the donor material and PDINO was used as the electron transport material. The device structure and energy level diagram of the materials investigated in this work are depicted in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Schematic diagram of OSC structure (A) and the relative HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the materials investigated in the work (B). 
In order to investigate the performance of the compounds, the OSC devices were prepared through three ways: spinning at cast without any treatments, thermal annealing at 100 °C for 20 min (TA) and solvent vapor annealing (fumigated for 10 seconds with CS2) (SVA-CS2), respectively. The selected weight ratio of donor (D)/acceptor (A) was 1:1, and chlorobenzene was used as the solvent. The photovoltaic parameters of the fabricated devices under simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination are shown in Table 2. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of OSCs obtained using different processing ways are shown in Fig. 7.

 Fig. 7  (a) J–V curves of the devices based on A1; (b) J–V curves of the optimum devices based on A2. 
As shown in Fig. 7(a) and Table 2, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices fabricated from the active layer of PBDB-T:A1 were slightly increased under different processing ways. The device without any treatment showed the photovoltaic parameters of Voc = 0.67 V, Jsc = 3.38 mA cm−2, FF = 44.42%, and PCE = 1.01%. The device with thermal annealing exhibited values of Voc = 0.68 V, Jsc = 3.64 mA cm−2, FF = 43.78%, and PCE = 1.08%. After solvent vapor annealing, the PCE of the device was increased from 1.01% to 1.28% due to having a higher Voc (0.70 V) and Jsc (4.47 mA cm−2). When A1 was used as the receptor material, the Jsc and FF values of the devices were relatively low, which limited the further improvement of the device PCE. After spin-coating, the molecular aggregation of the film surface was more obvious, which may be due to the poor miscibility of A1 with the donor PBDB-T in chlorobenzene solution, resulting in the low filling factor of the devices.
As shown in Fig. 7(b) and Table 2, the device fabricated from the active layer of PBDB-T:A2 without any treatment showed the photovoltaic parameters of Voc = 0.66 V, Jsc = 8.56 mA cm−2, FF = 35.22%, and PCE = 1.98%. After TA and SVA-CS2 treatments, the PCEs of the devices fabricated from the active layer of PBDB-T:A2 were increased to 2.57% and 2.38%, respectively, due to possessing higher Voc (0.74 V for TA and 0.73 V for SVA-CS2) and FF (41.09% for TA and 38.72% for SVA-CS2) values, which may be attributed to the improvement of the film morphology of the active layers after the annealing processes. This indicated that the PCEs of the devices were greatly affected by the fabrication conditions. In order to further investigate the effect of different annealing processes on the PCEs of the devices, dichloromethane (DCM) and chloroform (CF) were, respectively, used as the fumigating solvent. As showed in Table 2, after the SVA-CF treatment, the PCE of the devices fabricated from the active layer of PBDB-T:A2 was improved obviously, and a PCE of 2.94% was achieved due to possessing higher Voc (0.77 V), Jsc (8.73 mA cm−2) and FF (43.84%) values.
Solvent annealing (SVA) is a simple and effective method to improve the PCE of devices.37 It was found that the Voc and Jsc of the devices based on A1 and A2 increased after the SVA treatment. When the active layer was exposed to solvent vapor, the solvent vapor could partially dissolve the BHJ film, making it rearrange into a form more conducive to thermodynamics. At the same time, the electrons and holes could be effectively extracted, reducing recombination, and thus improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency.
For the photovoltaic parameters of the OSC devices of compounds A1 and A2, the large difference between A1 and A2 was the Jsc value of the devices. There was little difference between the FF values of the devices based on A1 and A2, but because the Jsc values of the devices based on A1 were too low, the PCEs of the devices was low. On one hand, A1 has a stretched-out spatial configuration, which may inhibit the formation of favorable oriented stacking between acceptor molecules. On the other hand, due to the presence of end groups, excessive aggregation occurs between A1 molecules, which is also not conducive to the formation of ordered aggregation between donor and acceptor, and ultimately leads to the failure of effective separation and transport of the electron–hole pairs at the donor interface. This showed that compound A1 did not blend well with the donor material, which could lead to the agglomeration phenomenon in the preparation of the active layer.
The EQE spectrum and the corresponding integrated Jsc curves of the optimal device based on PBDB-T:A2 are shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the device showed a strong broad photoresponse in the range from 320 to 750 nm, and the maximum EQE value was 44.7% (640 nm). A Jsc value of 7.68 mA cm−2 was obtained by integral calculation of the EQE spectrum, which was consistent with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V measurement.

The surface morphology of the PBDB-T:A2 blend film treated with SVA-CF was investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As showed in the height images in Fig. 9, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of the PBDB-T:A2 blend film was measured to be 0.719 nm. The appropriate RMS value of the PBDB-T:A2 blend film indicated the excellent miscibility of the donor and acceptor, which could lead to an efficient bicontinuous interpenetrating network.

4. Conclusions
In summary, two new cyanopyridinone-capped 9,9′-bifluorenylidene derivatives, A1 and A2, were successfully synthesized by grafting strong electron-withdrawing cyanopyridinone groups as the capping groups on the 3,6-position and 2,7-position of the 9,9′-bifluorenylidene core. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties and thermal stability were investigated systematically. The photovoltaic performance of A1 and A2 as acceptors and PBDB-T as the donor was investigated. Under different treatments (spinning at cast without any treatments, TA and SVA-CS2), the PCEs based on the active layer PBDB-T:A1 were 1.01%, 1.08% and 1.28%, respectively, while the PCEs based on the active layer PBDB-T:A2 were 1.98%, 2.57% and 2.38%, respectively. After treating the PBDB-T:A2 blend film with SVA-CF, the PCE of the device based on PBDB-T:A2 was increased to 2.94%.
