Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials have achieved tremendous success with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19%. Efficient carrier generation after light absorption is the central process for OSC device operation. So far, research efforts have been exclusively focused on the hole transfer process from photoexcited NFAs to polymer donors. Its counterpart, the photoinduced process after donor light absorption and its implications for OSC device performance remain much less explored and unclear. Herein, by combining ultrafast spectroscopy and photovoltaic characterization, we unambiguously show a dominant ultrafast (∼80 fs) and lossless Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from photoexcited polymer donors to NFA. The FRET process with an efficiency of over 65% is followed by reverse hole transfer (HT), bypassing direct electron transfer, becoming an efficient charge generation channel, especially for the state-of-the-art Y6 series OSCs. In contrast to fullerene-based OSCs, this synergistic two-step process eliminates the requirement for electron transfer driving force and facilitates the dissociation of donor excitons and leads to interesting spectral uniform photocurrent generation with reduced energy loss in star NFA OSCs. This study emphasizes the great potential of lossless FRET and the central role of HT and also provides new guidelines to engineer FRET for next generation high-efficiency OSCs.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention because of their special characteristics including low cost, flexibility, solution process and scalable printing.1–6 Recently, OSCs have achieved tremendous success with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 19%,7–9 owing to the invention of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, e.g. ITIC,10 Y6,11 etc. Compared to conventional fullerene acceptors, NFAs show remarkable advantages, including tunable energy levels, intense light absorption, strong π–π stacking and crystallinity, and long exciton diffusion length.12–18 Among them, the efficient photocarrier generation is the central process for OSC device operation.19–26 After NFA light absorption, efficient hole transfer (HT) from NFAs to polymer donors with a small highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) offset has been generally reported.19,21,27–31 In previous studies, our group has demonstrated the diffusion-mediated biphasic HT process with Marcus type behavior in high-efficiency NFAs OSCs.29,30 Meanwhile, some other explanations, e.g. delocalization of NFAs,16 CTXs model,27 and i-EX model,28 have also been proposed to describe efficient HT processes, especially for Y-series NFA based systems yielding the maximum PCE recorded, exhibiting a rich photophysical picture.
However, compared to the well explored HT process, very few efforts have been devoted to its counterpart, the photoinduced process after donor light absorption. In conventional fullerene-based OSCs, ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the polymer donor to fullerene occurs with a large (>0.3 eV) lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) offset, forming charge transfer (CT) states.32–34 Both hot-state charge delocalization35 and vibronic quantum coherence36 for ultrafast ET have been revealed in fullerene based systems. For the state-of-the-art NFA OSCs, recently, Wang and Zhang have suggested that the ET process after donor excitation is regulated by an intermediate CT state,28 similar to the classical fullerene systems.33 Meanwhile, Wang and Yang have inferred that exciton–exciton annihilation in photoexcited polymer donors leads to interchain polaron-pair dissociation, generating charges in OSCs.37 In contrast, Safakath et al. have claimed that the dominant energy transfer from donor acting may affect the finial PCE in low-bandgap NFAs based OSCs.38 A direct correlation study of photophysical process and photovoltaic performance remains lacking and it is urgent to fully reveal what happens after donor light absorption and how it affects the photovoltaic performance in high-efficiency NFA based OSCs.
Herein, by combining ultrafast visible-to-near IR broadband spectroscopy39 and photovoltaic characterizations, we unambiguously show the dominant ultrafast (∼80 fs) and lossless Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from a photoexcited polymer donor to NFAs, followed by slower reverse HT (tens of ps) in NFA OSCs, driven by the spectral overlap and energetics. The FRET efficiency correlates well with spectral overlap between donor emission and NFA absorption. In contrast to fullerene-based OSCs, this synergistic two-step process, bypassing electron transfer, leads to highly efficient photocarrier generation, regardless of excitation wavelength in NFA OSCs, as well as lower the energy loss by suppressing the formation of intermedia non-luminous CT exciton.
Results and discussion
Molecular structures and properties
As shown in Fig. 1(a), we choose state-of-the-art donor–acceptor combinations with two commonly used polymer donors, PM6 and D18-Cl, and six small molecule NFAs with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structures, including BTP-S2, L8-BO, Y6, CH1007, IXIC-4Cl and BTPV-4F, which have pushed the PCE to above 18%.8 We first focus on the most popular PM6:NFAs systems (the weight ratio of donor and acceptor is 1:1.2, leading to the best device performance) and extracted their HOMO and LUMO levels using a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (see Methods and Fig. S1, ESI† for details). As shown in Fig. 1(b) inset, the LUMO level of PM6 is more than 0.3 eV higher than that of NFAs, implying sufficient driving force for ET from photoexcited PM6 to NFAs. The HOMO offset, which is associated with HT process, shows small but favorable values (∼0.1 eV) in PM6: BTP-S2/L8-BO/Y6/CH1007 systems and slightly negative values, −0.06 eV and −0.08 eV, respectively, in PM6: IXIC-4Cl and PM6: BTPV-4F.

The normalized absorption spectra of neat PM6 and NFA films, together with the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of PM6, are compared in Fig. 1(b). The PM6 film exhibits a broad absorption from 350 to 680 nm with two main peaks at 580 nm and 620 nm and a PL extending from 600 to 1000 nm with two main peaks at 710 nm and 780 nm (see Fig. 1(b) shadow area). The absorption of NFAs is complementary to that of PM6 donor, from 650 nm to 1000 nm, with the main absorption peak redshifted gradually in the order of BTP-S2 (785 nm), L8-BO (805 nm), Y6 (820 nm), CH1007 (850 nm), IXIC-4Cl (860 nm), BTPV-4F (880 nm). Obviously, there is a large spectral overlap between the PL of PM6 and the absorption of NFAs, suggesting an FRET process40 from photoexcited PM6 to NFAs.
TA measurements and dynamics
To unravel the photophysical process, we use femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy with high temporal resolution and visible to near-IR (NIR) spectral coverage to investigate the representative PM6:Y6 (1:1.2 wt%) binary system. We first use a 750 nm pump pulse (<5 μJ cm−2) to excite only Y6 without exciting PM6 to capture the HT process.29 The TA results of pure Y6 and PM6:Y6 blend films under 750 nm excitation are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), respectively. The positive bleach peak at ∼850 nm in both pure Y6 and blend films can be attributed to the combined contribution of ground state bleach (GSB) and stimulated emission (SE) of Y6. In the blend film, accompanying the Y6 SE decay, a new bleach peak at 550–640 nm forms in ∼100 ps (see Fig. S2, ESI†), which corresponds to PM6 absorption and indicates an efficient HT process from photoexcited Y6 to PM6, i.e. PM6 + Y6* → PM6+ + Y6−, in agreement with previous literature.28,41–43
We then focus on the main photophysical process in the PM6: Y6 blend film under 550 nm photoexcitation (<5 μJ cm−2) which mostly (>85%) excites polymer donor (PM6) in the blend film. The 2D color plots of visible and NIR TA spectra of pure PM6 film and PM6:Y6 blend film under 550 nm excitation are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively, with a few representative TA spectra at indicated delay times in Fig. S3, ESI† and Fig. 2(c), respectively. The TA spectra of pure Y6 is also shown in Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S4, ESI† for reference. While the visible probe is dominated by the bleach of donor and NFA materials, the NIR probe displays solely their excited state absorption (ESA) features. As shown in Fig. 2(a), pure PM6 film exhibits a bleach peak at ∼630 nm and an ESA peak of the singlet state at ∼1100 nm instantly after photoexcitation. In the PM6:Y6 blend (Fig. 2(b) and (c)), the GSB and ESA of PM6 decay quickly in the first hundreds of femtoseconds accompanied by the formation of the GSB of Y6 at ∼850 nm and its singlet ESA at ∼1550 nm.

(f) Schematic depiction of two charge generation channels in the blend after donor light absorption, including (i) electron transfer (ET) and (ii) energy transfer (FRET) followed by hole transfer from NFA to donor. 
The GSB (from visible probe) and ESA (from NIR probe) kinetics of PM6 and Y6 in the blend are shown in Fig. 2(d) and (e), respectively. We choose the 613 nm probe kinetics to represent the GSB kinetics of PM6 in the blend film where Y6 (Fig. S2, ESI†) and SE of PM6 (Fig. S3, ESI†) has negligible signal and choose 850 nm probe kinetics to represent the GSB kinetics of Y6 in the blend where PM6 has negligible signal. Also shown in gray dashed lines are the HT kinetics from photoexcited Y6 to PM6 (Fig. 2(d)) and ESA kinetics of the pure PM6 film (Fig. 2(e)) for comparison. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the GSB of photoexcited PM6 in the blend shows an ultrafast decay in the first few hundreds of femtoseconds, which is accompanied by the rapid formation of Y6 GSB. Meanwhile, the decay of PM6 singlet ESA in the blend decays much faster than that in the pure PM6 film and correlates very well with the rise of Y6 singlet ESA (Fig. 2(e) and Fig. S4, ESI†). The visible and NIR TA results together unambiguously confirm FRET from photoexcited PM6 to Y6, i.e. PM6* + Y6 → PM6 + Y6* (Fig. 2(f)). A single exponential fitting (black dashed lines in Fig. 2(d) and (e)) on the rising process of Y6 GSB and ESA yields a FRET lifetime of ∼0.08 ps. In principle, both ET33,35,36 and FRET can occur after PM6 photoexcitation in PM6:Y6 blend. However, ET process itself should not lead to the decay of PM6 GSB and the formation of Y6 singlet ESA. The results here indicate prominent FRET in polymer donor/NFA blends. The relative contribution of ET vs FRET will be determined quantitatively later by variable excitation wavelength PL quenching measurements.
Interestingly, at a later time in 1–100 ps, the PM6 GSB grows again (Fig. 2(d) red line), which correlates with the decay of Y6 ESA (Fig. 2(e) blue line). This process well matches the 1–100 ps HT kinetics under 750 nm excitation. This result indicates that after photoexcitation of PM6 donor and initial PM6 to Y6 FRET process, HT occurs subsequently from excited Y6 back to PM6, forming separated charges (Fig. 2(f)). Despite eventual charge separation by either FRET followed by HT or direct ET after donor light absorption, it has strong implications for the photocurrent generation performance in OSC devices, as we’ll show later. In addition to TA measurements, the FRET process can also be confirmed by ultrafast PL kinetics of Y6 in the blend under different excitations, 750 nm (exciting Y6) and 550 nm (exciting PM6). As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), compared to 750 nm excitation, Y6 PL kinetics under 550 nm excitation shows a slower increase in the sub-ps range, which can be attributed to the ultrafast energy transfer from PM6 to Y6. Besides, the slower Y6 exciton decay in the blend at 550 nm pump can be explained via a persistent Y6 exciton generation process, in agreement with the PM6 exciton diffusion to the D/A interface followed by FERT (PM6*⋯PM6 + Y6 → PM6⋯PM6* + Y6 → PM6⋯PM6 + Y6*).
PL characterization and FRET efficiency
To further determine the FRET efficiency, we have performed variable excitation wavelength PL quenching measurements.44 The PL quenching of Y6 in the PM6/Y6 blend by comparing pure Y6 and blend films under 785 nm and 532 nm photoexcitation are shown in Fig. 3(a) left and right panels, respectively. The PL quenching of PM6 under 532 nm excitation is also shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) for reference. Under 785 nm excitation which only excites Y6, the Y6 PL intensity in the blend is quenched by 96%. In contrast, under 532 nm photoexcitation which excites both PM6 and Y6, the PL quenching of Y6 reduces to 89% accompanied by PL quenching of PM6 of over 99%, suggesting FRET from photoexcited PM6 to Y6. According to the light absorption of each component from absorption spectra and PL quenching, we can calculate the FRET efficiency of ∼47.3% in PM6:Y6 blend (see Note S1, ESI† for details).

We also estimated the FRET efficiency in other PM6: NFA blends (including PM6: BTP-S2, PM6: L8-BO, PM6: CH1007, PM6: IXIC-4Cl and PM6: BTPV-4F) and they all show high FRET efficiency (30–66%, Fig. 3(b) and Table S1, ESI†). Since PM6 donor has a long intrinsic excited state lifetime (∼100 ps), the FRET efficiency in blend is determined by the competition between the donor ET process and the FRET process, i.e. η = kFRET/(kFRET + kET), where kET and kFRET is ET and FRET rate, respectively. Generally, the FRET rate kFRET can be described as kFRET = (1/τD)(R0/RDA)6, where τD is the radiative lifetime of the donor, RDA is the donor–acceptor separation distance and R0 is the FRET radius determined by the spectral overlap between normalized donor emission and acceptor absorption.40 A stronger donor–acceptor spectral overlap gives rise to a larger FRET radius and thus a higher FRET efficiency. We estimated the FRET radius R0 in these PM6: NFA blends and the value increases from 3.09 to 3.40 nm with the red-shifting of NFA absorption (see Note S2, ESI† for details). Indeed, Fig. 3(b) shows a generally positive correlation between FRET efficiency and R0, revealing the dictating role of spectral overlap on the FRET process.
Furthermore, with donor–acceptor separation distance RDA of ∼1 nm38 and PM6 donor lifetime τD of 106 ps (Fig. S3, ESI†), we can calculate the FRET rate in blend films and the values are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). For the PM6: Y6 system, the calculated FRET rate is 8.2 × 1012 s−1, in good agreement with the ∼80 fs lifetime from TA measurements. As FRET efficiency in polymer donor/NFA blend is determined by the competition between the donor ET process and the FRET process, over 50% and up to 65.9% FRET efficiency shown in Table S2 (ESI†) indicate that donor exciton dissociation via the two-step process involving FRET, prove to be a more efficient charge generation channel than direct ET, which has always been ignored in the past research.
Implications for device performance
To reveal the effect of the FRET process on OSC device performance, we fabricated OSC devices with the typical structure of ITO/PETDOT-PSS/PM6: NFAs/PFN-Br/Ag (Fig. 4(a)). Fig. 4(b) and (c) display the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all six PM6: NFA devices, respectively. The average characteristic photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. OSC devices with PM6: BTP-S2, PM6: L8-BO, PM6: Y6, PM6: CH1007, PM6: IXIC-4Cl and PM6: BTPV-4F show PCEs of 15.6%, 18.1%, 16.2%, 17.3%, 11.7% and 9.2%, respectively. From EQE and absorption spectra, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of PM6 (IQED) and NFA (IQEA) can be calculated (Note S3, ESI†) and the results are compared in Fig. 4(d) (blue and pink bars) and Table 1. Also shown in Fig. 4(d) (gray bar) is PL quenching of NFA in the blend which indicates the HT efficiency and HOMO offset.

In Fig. 4(d), the IQEA closely follows the NFA PL quenching efficiency, confirming that the IQEA is governed by the NFA-to-donor HT step. As shown previously, the HT process is controlled by donor-NFA HOMO offset, with a faster HT at a larger HOMO offset.29,30 Indeed, IQEA remains high (>95%) in the star OSC blends including PM6: Y6, PM6: L8-BO and PM6: BTP-S2 with ∼0.1 eV HOMO offset8,11,21,45,46 and drops to ∼55% with the HOMO offset decreasing to ∼−0.08 eV in PM6: IXIC-4Cl and PM6: BTPV-4F.
We now focus on the IQED, which is one of the main points of this study. Interestingly, IQED varies largely and almost equals IQEA, despite sufficient (>0.3 eV) LUMO offset but varying HOMO offset in all these blends. The high FRET efficiency and IQED in star OSC blends (e.g. PM6: Y6, PM6: L8-BO, PM6: CH1007 and PM6: BTP-S2) imply that the ultrafast FRET process does not necessarily harm the photocurrent generation in OSC devices. Moreover, IQED drops in the same way as IQEA in blends with unfavorable HOMO offset (e.g. PM6: IXIC-4Cl and PM6: BTPV-4F). This is consistent with Fig. 2(f) that FRET is followed by HT, contributing to photocurrent generation and bypassing ET. As the FRET step is ultrafast and efficient, it is the subsequent HT step that dictates the overall photocurrent generation efficiency, leading to the uniform IQE under either a polymer donor or NFA excitation. Therefore, our results reclaim the central role of the hole transfer process on regulating photocurrent generation, regardless of the excitation wavelength.
Compared to traditional fullerene based OSC systems where photoinduced ET from the donor to the fullerene acceptor dominates photocarrier generation (Note S4, ESI†), NFA-based OCSs show the unique large spectral overlap between donor emission and NFA absorption, resulting in a prominent energy transfer process from photoexcited donor to NFAs. Recent studies have shown that NFAs have higher dielectric constant than polymer donors because of conjugated rigid plane structure and high packing density of NFA molecules8,16,18,47 (see Fig. S2c, ESI† for the Y6 crystal structure), which is beneficial for charge separation.48–50 In addition, thanks to the characteristic wavefunction delocalization,16,51 low reorganization energy52 and orbital hybridization46,53 of NFA molecules, new photocarrier generation channels (e.g. self-stimulated dissociation,54 i-EX,28 CTX27) have also been revealed in NFA systems, enabling efficient hole transfer with near zero donor-NFA HOMO offsets.
Notably, instead of the traditional exciton dissociation pathway mediated by the CT state, latest research on Y-series materials revealed the unique HT channel mediated by intermolecular delocalized singlet excitons (DSE)55 or i-EX28 aids Y-series exciton dissociation. Therefore, the energy transfer from donor to Y-series acceptors enables more charge generation through HT without the CT state channel, avoiding the CT exciton formation, and thus reducing the CT geminate recombination as well as non-radiation recombination energy loss (ΔVnr). In experiments, we measured EQEEL (Fig. 4(e)) to determine the ΔVnr by ΔVnr = −kTln(EQE)EL, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature. As shown in Fig. 4(f), compared with PM6:PCBM, which is governed by traditional electron transfer and the CT state, the ΔVnr in the PM6:Y-series system is greatly reduced. More importantly, with the increase of FRET efficiency, the ΔVnr shows a certain downward trend, suggesting the two-step charge generation channel via FRET might be an effective way to reduce the energy loss by suppressing the formation of intermedia non-luminous CT state in PM6: Y-series system.
The ultrafast and lossless FRET process was observed not only in PM6: NFA systems, but also in blends with another star polymer donor D18-Cl which has boosted the PCE to 18.7% (D18-Cl: L8-BO) recently (Fig. S7, ESI†).56 Therefore, the energy transfer process, in fact, turns the flexible and localized polymer donor excitons32,33 into the delocalized16 or dissociated16,54 ones in NFAs. In that regard, under donor light absorption, FRET followed by HT, rather than efficiency limit, could be a good strategy to achieve efficient exciton dissociation and lower energy loss,16,51,57 improving the PCE of NFA based OSC devices. Moreover, by enhancing the efficiency of FRET, the LUMO level of NFAs is no longer limited by the need for sufficient ET driving force, and thus NFAs will provide tunable VOC while maintaining high charge generation efficiency. According to the FRET rate expression above, the following designing rules could be explored to increase FRET rate and efficiency: (i) increasing the PL quantum yield58 or decreasing PL lifetime of donor; (ii) increasing the spectral overlap between donor emission and NFA absorption; and (iii) decreasing the distance between donor and acceptor via side-chain engineering59 or one component D/A molecular design.60 On the other hand, blend morphologies and domain sizes might affect the FERT efficiency from the donor to NFAs. Here, we added the AFM results shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The RMS value of these blends varies from 0.81 nm to1.14 nm, showing a slight difference between these blends. The AFM phase images of PM6: NFAs show a similar fibrous interpenetrating network structure with phase aggregation on the order of tens of nanometers, suggesting negligible morphological effects in terms of the characteristic photophysical process. However, due to the limitations of the microscopic morphology characterization method, we can’t do a more useful analysis and deep discussion. Indeed, more theoretical and experimental approaches with interfacial sensitivity are needed to be developed and explored, which are beyond the scope of this study.
Conclusions
To summarize, we unambiguously unravel a dominant ultrafast (∼80 fs) and lossless FRET process from the photoexcited polymer donor to NFAs, followed by slower reverse HT in high-efficiency NFA OSCs. The high FRET efficiency of up to over 65% can be attributed to substantial spectral overlap between donor emission and NFA absorption. In contrast to fullerene-based OSCs, this synergistic two-step process, bypassing direct ET, dominates the charge generation process after donor excitation. Moreover, this photophysical process facilitates the dissociation of donor exciton and leads to interesting spectral uniform photocurrent generation in star NFA OSCs, exhibiting the ability to reduce the energy loss as well. This study shows the great potential for much less explored energy transfer process and emphasizes the core role of HT in NFA OSCs, regardless of excitation wavelength, and provides new designing principles to engineer the FRET process for next generation high-efficiency OSCs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials have achieved tremendous success with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19%. Efficient carrier generation after light absorption is the central process for OSC device operation. So far, research efforts have been exclusively focused on the hole transfer process from photoexcited NFAs to polymer donors. Its counterpart, the photoinduced process after donor light absorption and its implications for OSC device performance remain much less explored and unclear. Herein, by combining ultrafast spectroscopy and photovoltaic characterization, we unambiguously show a dominant ultrafast (∼80 fs) and lossless Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from photoexcited polymer donors to NFA. The FRET process with an efficiency of over 65% is followed by reverse hole transfer (HT), bypassing direct electron transfer, becoming an efficient charge generation channel, especially for the state-of-the-art Y6 series OSCs. In contrast to fullerene-based OSCs, this synergistic two-step process eliminates the requirement for electron transfer driving force and facilitates the dissociation of donor excitons and leads to interesting spectral uniform photocurrent generation with reduced energy loss in star NFA OSCs. This study emphasizes the great potential of lossless FRET and the central role of HT and also provides new guidelines to engineer FRET for next generation high-efficiency OSCs.
