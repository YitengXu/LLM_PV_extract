    , Accepted 5th January 2018First published on 8th January 2018AbstractThermoelectric materials have been extensively studied for decades to help resolve the global energy shortage and environmental problems. Many efforts have been focused on the improvement of the figure of merit (ZT) for highly efficient power generation. Lead telluride is one of the materials with high ZT, but lead toxicity is always a concern, which has inspired research on lead-free tin chalcogenides. ZT values as high as ∼2.6 at 923 K for SnSe single crystals and ∼1.6 at 923 K for Sn0.86Mn0.14Te(Cu2Te)0.05-5 atm% Sn were recently reported, attracting extensive attention for potential applications. In this review, we present the progress in SnTe, SnSe, and SnS, mainly discussing the effective tuning of the electron and phonon transport based on the intrinsic properties, along with the challenges for further optimization and applications. For SnTe, successful strategies, including resonant doping, band convergence, defect engineering, etc., are discussed. For SnSe, we focus on the analysis of the intrinsic low thermal conductivity due to strong anharmonicity and a high Seebeck coefficient because of the multi-valley bands. For SnS, high performance is expected considering its similar band structure and crystal structure to SnSe.Shan LiShan Li is currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen).

1. Introduction
The world-wide demand for alternative clean energy has promoted the rapid development of research on thermoelectric (TE) materials, which can directly generate electricity by applying a thermal gradient to realize waste heat harvesting. The conversion efficiency of TE devices is limited by the Carnot efficiency and dimensionless figure of merit ZT = [S2σ/(κe + κL)]T of the materials, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, κe is the is the electronic thermal conductivity, κL is the lattice thermal conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature.1–7 A high ZT value requires a combination of a high Seebeck coefficient, a high electrical conductivity, and a low thermal conductivity. However, all these parameters are inter-dependent, always accompanied by many compromises when optimizing the materials. Based on the underlying mechanisms, numerous efforts have been devoted to decoupling and synergizing individual TE properties, contributing to the continuous breakthroughs over the past few years. Most of the classical materials have been improved with ZT values higher than 1.58–14 or even higher than 2 for some rare cases.15–18 Meanwhile, some valuable criteria were derived to guide the property adjustment and also help develop new TE materials with promising TE properties. In recent years, plenty of new TE materials have been identified with satisfactory TE properties, such as low temperature materials (T < 300 K) YbAgCu419 and CsBi4Te6,20 near room temperature materials (300 K < T < 500 K) MgAgSb,21,22 mid-temperature materials (500 K < T < 800 K) BiCuSeO,23,24 Mg2(Si,Ge,Sn),25–27 Mg3Sb2,28,29 Ba8Ga16Ge30,30 Zn4Sb3,31 In4Se3,32–34 and Cu2(S,Se,Te),35–40 and high temperature materials (T > 800 K) Yb14MnSb11,41 NbFeSb-,42,43 ZrCoSb-,44,45 and ZrNiSn-based half-Heusler alloys,46,47etc. A representative family is Sn chalcogenides, Sn(Te, Se, S), with high reported ZT values of ∼1.6 at about 923 K for Sn0.86Mn0.14Te(Cu2Te)0.05-5 atm% Sn48 and ∼2.6 at about 920 K for single crystal SnSe.49 The high performance is attributed to the intrinsic features, like high anharmonicity for low lattice thermal conductivity in SnSe and SnS, and multi-valley bands for a possible high Seebeck coefficient in SnTe and SnSe. However, we must also notice the low Seebeck coefficient and high thermal conductivity due to the high concentration of intrinsic Sn vacancies in SnTe and very low electrical conductivity in SnSe and SnS, which need to be further optimized. From an environmental point of view, inorganic tin compounds are rather non-toxic. Typical strategies to increase the electrical properties, including effective doping,6,50 resonant doping,51–53 band convergence,54–56etc., and to decrease the thermal conductivity, including defect engineering,57–59 nano-engineering,60–62etc., have been successfully studied.
Here, we review recent advances in tin chalcogenides (SnTe, SnSe, and SnS) bulk alloys, mainly discussing the effective tuning of the electron and phonon transport based on the intrinsic properties. For SnTe, we focus on typical strategies for obtaining high electrical properties and low thermal conductivity. For SnSe, progress in single crystals and polycrystals is separately presented, including the demonstration of the crystal structure, intrinsic low thermal conductivity, intrinsic multi-valent bands, and effective p-type and n-type doping. The study on SnS is relatively scare compared with that on SnTe and SnSe, so a brief summary is included. We then conclude with the possible directions for further improving the TE properties in this material system and elucidate the challenges for optimization and application of tin chalcogenide materials.
2. SnTe
A lead-free compound, tin telluride (SnTe), has recently attracted much attention with promising TE performance.63–67 Pristine SnTe is inherently riddled with a great number of Sn vacancies, leading to a heavily hole doped (1020–1021 cm−3) p-type semiconductor possessing an extremely low Seebeck coefficient and a high thermal conductivity.68–71 So SnTe was less studied for TE applications. Its similar two-valence-band electronic structure to PbTe and PbSe suggests the possible high performance with a benefit from band convergence.64,72–75 However, the valence and conduction band edges of SnTe locating at the L point of the Brillouin zone are separated by a very small band gap (0.18 eV at 300 K), normally resulting in a significant bipolar effect.76,77 In addition, the energy separation (0.35 eV at 300 K) between the light-hole band at the L point and the heavy-hole band at the Σ point is larger than those of PbTe (∼0.12 eV) or PbSe (∼0.26 eV), making the benefit of the heavier band for the Seebeck coefficient less significant.72,78–80 Many strategies have been used to improve the ZT values of SnTe. Great improvements have been achieved in SnTe based materials.48,53,81–88Table 1 shows the list of the thermoelectric properties of some well-developed SnTe-based materials. The highest ZT value has been increased dramatically from ∼0.3 to ∼1.6 at 923 K, making it a possible substitute for lead chalcogenides for solid-state waste heat recovery.

2.1. Band engineering and carrier optimization

2.1.1. Band engineering. 
Creating resonant levels is an important approach to increase the Seebeck coefficient by distorting the density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level first proposed in metals in the 1950s.99 Significant enhancements in the Seebeck coefficient because of the presence of resonant levels have been reported in Tl-doped PbTe,100 Al-doped PbSe,101 Sn-doped Bi2Te3,102 K-doped Bi0.95Sb0.05,103etc. In 1984, Bushmarina et al. found that the transport behaviors of In-doped SnTe were related to resonant scattering.104 Zhang et al. recently utilized the resonant level near the Fermi level of SnTe by 0.25 atm% In doping, successfully increasing the Seebeck coefficient and ZT value of SnTe to 1.1.53 Compared with the pristine SnTe compound, the Seebeck coefficient of In-doped SnTe was markedly improved (filled squares, Fig. 1(a)). The room temperature Pisarenko relations showed a deviation of In-doped SnTe from the valence band model (VBM), which describes the light nonparabolic hole band (mlh = 0.168) around the L point combined with a parabolic heavy hole band (mhh = 1.92) with ΔE (ΔE = 0.35 eV) lying below the valence band edge.47 The VBM fits well to all the obtained undoped SnTe with different hole concentrations (2 × 1020 to 1.8 × 1021 cm−3, caused by different Sn vacancies) and other doped SnTe, like Bi- and Cu-doped SnTe.78 The deviation of the In-doped SnTe from the VBM implies a possible mechanism, which was further studied by first principles density of states (DOS) calculation as shown in Fig. 1(b). Circled features are due to the added resonant state observed in the DOS of In-doped SnTe near the band edge, to which the abnormally high Seebeck coefficient might be attributed.47

The Fermi level in the simulation resides at 6.207 eV, slightly below the DOS “hump”.53 (c) Schematic diagram of the electronic structure of SnTe, PbSe, PbTe, and Sn1−xAxTe near the Fermi level to show the relative positions of the conduction band (CB), light hole valence band (VBL), and heavy hole valence band (VBΣ).

A similarly enhanced Seebeck coefficient at a given carrier concentration has also been found in Sn1−xAxTe (A = Hg, Cd, Mn, Ca, Mg)83–85,91–93,105 (filled circles Fig. 1(a)) due to band convergence. Analogous to PbTe and PbSe, there are also two valence bands in SnTe (one light valence band at the L point and one heavy valence band at the Σ point).72,78–80Fig. 1(c) shows the schematic diagram of the electronic structure of SnTe, PbSe, and PbTe near the Fermi level. The smaller L point energy gap of SnTe makes the nonparabolicity larger, and the Seebeck coefficient drops faster with increasing concentration.72 The larger separation between the light-hole and heavy-hole band edges in the SnTe system prevents the contribution from the heavier band for enhancing the Seebeck coefficient, which is further confirmed by the comparison of predictions from the VBM and the two-band Kane (TBK) model (TBK model ignores the heavy-hole band contribution) (shown in Fig. 1(d)).72,78–80 The contribution from the heavy-hole band occurs at higher carrier concentration and higher temperature in the SnTe system. In order to better realize the band convergence, SnTe alloyed with different tellurides with a larger band gap than SnTe, like HgTe,85 CdTe,83,86 MnTe,91,92,105,106 CaTe,93 MgTe,84etc., were prepared to artificially modify the electronic band structure by diminishing the energy separation between the light-hole and heavy-hole valence bands, and enlarging the energy band gap as shown in Fig. 1(c). The room temperature Seebeck coefficient of Sn1−xAxTe increased dramatically at the same carrier concentration (see Fig. 1(a)), similar to the effect of resonant doping. Some features of resonant doping and band convergence are as follows. (1) Resonant doping sharply increases the effective mass of holes, which can benefit the enhanced Seebeck coefficient, but strongly scatter the carriers and significantly decrease the carrier mobility. (2) When alloying with large band gap materials, the enlarged overall band gap suppresses the bipolar effect and the engineered two valence bands facilitate the band convergence. The point defects simultaneously generated by alloying not only decrease the lattice thermal conductivity, but also increase the electronic scattering. (3) Resonant states are more beneficial to the thermoelectric properties at room temperature. The high Seebeck coefficient at higher temperature is more attributed to the converging of the two valence bands of SnTe. Combining these two strategies, SnTe codoped with In & Cd,86 In & Mn,88 and In & Mg96 was reported. The relationships between the room temperature Seebeck coefficient and the carrier concentration are also presented in Fig. 1(a) (filled stars). The Seebeck coefficients of In & Cd-codoped samples are much higher than those of undoped and Cd-doped SnTe and comparable to those of In-doped SnTe.83,86 The Seebeck coefficients of In & Mn,88 and In & Mg-codoped samples are higher than those of In-doped,96 Mg-doped,84 and Mn-doped SnTe.91,92,105,106 The calculated band gap increased and the gap between light hole band and heavy hole band edges decreased, suggesting the successful band modification.86 Well-defined peaks appear near the Fermi level inside the valence bands of these codoped samples, confirming the existence of resonant states.53


2.1.2. Carrier optimization. 
Since the poor TE properties of SnTe are mainly due to the intrinsic high hole carrier concentration (1020–1021 cm−3), much work has been focused on the balance of the carrier concentration, including Sn self-compensation and extrinsic doping.71,72,83,107 With x changing from 0 to 0.1 in Sn1+xTe as the nominal composition, the hole carrier concentration decreased with increasing Sn content to a Sn self-compensation limit at about x = 0.3, resulting in increased thermoelectric properties.83 Tan et al. demonstrated a 3 mol% self-compensation of Sn resulting in a 50% improvement in ZT.83 Acharya et al. also reported that partial control of charge carriers can be achieved by self-compensation via careful filling of the vacancies using excess Sn.108 Zhao et al. reported that counter doping (electron-optimized) in SnTe with Ga, In, Bi, and Sb improved the electrical transport properties through Fermi level tuning.107 Zhou et al. investigated the effects of both donor- and acceptor-doping on the Hall carrier concentration and thermoelectric properties of SnTe and found that donor-doping decreased the Hall carrier concentration and enhanced the Seebeck coefficient, while acceptor-doping increased the Hall carrier concentration and also enhanced the Seebeck coefficient due to the dominant contribution from the heavy valence band.71 Zhang et al. prepared Ag and Gd-codoped SnTe. Ag doping increased the Seebeck coefficient due to the decreased carrier concentration and adjusted phase composition.109 The temperature dependences of peak ZT and average ZT for some optimized SnTe compounds are shown in Fig. 1(e) and (f), respectively. Both the peak ZT and the average ZT were increased by band engineering and effective doping. The highest ZT value is ∼1.6 at about 923 K for Sn0.86Mn0.14Te(Cu2Te)0.05-5 atm% Sn.48 The best average ZT value is ∼0.79 for Sn0.88Mn0.12Te with cold side temperature at 300 K and hot side temperature at 900 K.106 In fact, each optimization has included more strategies, such as resonant doping, band convergence, normal doping for tuning the carrier concentration, defect engineering, nano-engineering, etc.

2.2. Nanostructures and point defect engineering
High thermal conductivity also limits the development of SnTe, which has been partially reduced when high hole density was depressed. However, the lattice thermal conductivity of pristine SnTe (∼3.5 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature and ∼1.3 W m−1 K−1 at 900 K)53 is much higher compared with the theoretical lowest lattice thermal conductivity k min (∼0.5 W m−1 K−1 calculated using the model proposed by Cahill et al.110). Both nano-engineering and point defect engineering have been demonstrated to be effective in enhancing the phonon scattering and decreasing the lattice thermal conductivity in SnTe based materials.

2.2.1. Nanostructures. 
Single-phase SnTe could be directly prepared by ball milling the raw materials. With increasing ball milling time, the average grain size decreased and the lattice thermal conductivity decreased. Fig. 2(a) shows the optimized In0.0025Sn0.9975Te samples consisting of big grains with diameters of several tens of microns, small grains with diameters of ∼1 μm, and nano-grains with sizes around 100 nm.53 The increased density of grain boundaries effectively lowered the room temperature lattice thermal conductivity from 3.42 W m−1 K−1 to 1.52 W m−1 K−1. Even smaller SnTe grains have been synthesized by a wet chemical method. SnTe nanoparticles with grain sizes from ∼65 nm to ∼115 nm have been synthesized by a one-pot and surfactant-free solution route (Fig. 2(b)).111 It decreased lattice thermal conductivity from ∼3.33 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and ∼2.84 W m−1 K−1 at 530 K to ∼1.63 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and ∼1.28 W m−1 K−1 at 530 K. Se & Cd-codoped SnTe octahedral particles have also been prepared by a microwave-stimulated solvothermal method. A low thermal conductivity of ∼1.8 W m−1 K−1 at 773 K for Sn0.98Cd0.02Te0.90Se0.10 and an extremely low lattice thermal conductivity of ∼0.53 W m−1 K−1 at 675 K for Sn0.97Cd0.03Te0.90Se0.10 were obtained. The as-synthesized Sn0.98Cd0.02Te0.90Se0.10 has a grain size of ∼1.2 μm with many nanoscale precipitates of ∼10 nm.98In situ nano-precipitates formed in the SnTe based alloys also contributed to the lowered lattice thermal conductivity. Zhang et al. have reported that Gd doping can effectively reduce the lattice thermal conductivity because of the strong scattering of the phonons by mass fluctuation between a second phase and matrix coupled with mesoscale scattering via grain boundaries (Fig. 2(c)).109 Tan et al. also found that alloying some AgBiTe2 in SnTe can dramatically decrease the lattice thermal conductivity due to the strong scattering of phonons (by point defect scattering as well as Ag-rich nanostructures) to achieve a low kL of ∼0.7 W m−1 K−1 at 750 K (Fig. 2(d)).90 CdS was selected as the second phase (size range from 3 to 4 nm) in Cd-doped SnTe and In & Cd codoped SnTe due to the limited solubility and a well-behaved nucleation and growth mechanism, leading to the lowest lattice thermal conductivity of ∼0.58 W m−1 K−1 for SnCd0.03Te-2 atm% CdS (Fig. 2(e)). Rabih et al. recently reported that Ga-doping in SnTe exhibited the lowest lattice thermal conductivity of ∼0.48 W m−1 K−1 at 723 K, which is slightly below the theoretical amorphous minimum estimated using the model proposed by Cahill et al. The microstructure of Ga-doped SnTe is presented in Fig. 2(f), showing GaTe nano-precipitates.95,110

2.2.2. Point defect engineering. 
When alloying with HgTe,85 CdTe,83,86 MgTe,84 SrTe,107 GdTe,109 YbTe,112 AgBiTe2,90 or MnTe91,92,105,106 to engineer the band structure, the alloy defect scattering could effectively decrease the lattice thermal conductivity by scattering the high frequency phonons. The atomic radius, strain fluctuations, and mass difference between alloying atoms and Sn could decide the strength of the scattering. In Fig. 2(g), the Debye–Callaway model (grey solid line) was used to consider the pure alloying effect on the lattice thermal conductivity.105 The lattice thermal conductivity of all the alloyed SnTe decreased to be close to this theoretical line. An extremely low lattice thermal conductivity was found in SnTe doped with Ga forming GaTe nano-precipitates (red filled circles) and (SnTe)1−x(Cu2Te)x solid solutions with interstitial Cu atoms (green filled pentagon). The lowest lattice thermal conductivities were both ∼0.48 W m−1 K−1 at 723 K. Fig. 2(h) shows the solid solution nature of (SnTe)0.94(Cu2Te)0.06 with interstitial Cu (red circles). A peak ZT higher than 1 was then achieved in Sn0.94Cu0.12Te at 850 K, without relying on other approaches for electrical performance enhancements.94 Combined with the band convergence, a high ZT value of ∼1.6 was achieved in Sn0.86Mn0.14Te(Cu2Te)0.05-5 atm% Sn at 923 K,48 as shown in Fig. 2(i).
A full-scale hierarchical structure is suggested to effectively dissipate a wide range of thermal carrier phonons, thereby significantly reducing the lattice thermal conductivity in Sn1−xMnxTe (0 < x < 0.5).91,113 Different kinds of nanostructures were observed in the bulk samples with nano-precipitates (Fig. 2(j)), MnTe second phases in the SnTe matrix as laminates (Fig. 2(k)), arrayed dislocations along the interface (Fig. 2(l)), and stacking faults inside MnTe laminates (Fig. 2(m)). All these microstructures along with the mesoscale grains in these samples lead to a very low lattice thermal conductivity close to the theoretical limit. And in this study the κL decreased from 1.6 W m−1 K−1 for SnTe to 0.6 W m−1 K−1 for Sn0.83Mn0.17Te at 900 K and the ZT value was ∼1.3.91

3. SnSe
Tin selenide (SnSe) is a well-known semiconductor with potential applications in solar cells, infrared optoelectronic devices and phase change memory alloys.114–117 The high room temperature electrical resistivity (101–105 Ω cm) impeded its possible thermoelectric application.115 However, a remarkably high ZT of ∼2.6 along b directions at about 923 K was reported in single crystalline SnSe,49 which excited the thermoelectric community for further study on the electrical and thermal transport properties of SnSe.
3.1. Crystal structure
SnSe crystalizes in a layered orthorhombic structure with the Pnma space group (lattice parameters a = 11.501 Å, b = 4.153 Å, and c = 4.445 Å) at room temperature, which can be derived from a three-dimensional distortion of the rock-salt structure.118–120 The Sn and Se atoms are arranged in double layers with two planes of zigzag Sn–Se chains along the x-axis,121 as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). The unit cell of the SnSe structure contains highly distorted SnSe7 polyhedra with three short and four long Sn–Se bonds, and a lone pair of Sn2+ sterically occupied one of the symmetrical sites;49 see Fig. 3(b). The easy cleavage in this structure is along the (100) plane due to the weak bonding interactions by van der Waals force with the lowest ideal strength of ∼0.59 GPa under the (100)/〈001〉 shear load.122 When increasing temperature to ∼750 K, SnSe undergoes a second order displacive phase transition from the orthorhombic Pnma space group to a higher-symmetry orthorhombic Cmcm space group structure (lattice parameters a = 4.310 Å, b = 11.705 Å, and c = 4.318 Å), which preserves bilayer stacking and each Sn (or Se) atom is coordinated to four neighboring Se (or Sn) atoms at equal distances in the y–z plane, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), resulting in a considerable difference in the band structure and transport properties.120,123–126 Therefore, it is of great importance to clarify the effect of high-temperature phase transition on the transport properties if measured at a temperature higher than the phase transition temperature.

3.2. Intrinsic low thermal conductivity
Typically, low thermal conductivity may arise from complex structures,20,41,127 strong anharmonicity,128–130 weak chemical bonding,131 heavy constituent elements,132 low-frequency optical phonons,127 lone-pair electrons,133etc. The high ZT value achieved in SnSe is mainly attributed to the ultralow thermal conductivity induced by strong anharmonicity due to the long-range bond length between Sn and Se atoms in the layered accordion-like structure. The strength of lattice anharmonicity in bonding can be characterized by the Grüneisen parameter, which shows the relationship between the phonon frequency and volume change. Assume that the anharmonic Umklapp process dominates the phonon transport. If only considering the acoustic phonon modes, the lattice thermal conductivity (κL) is defined as134,135 (1)where A is a collection of physical constants,  is the average mass of the atoms in the crystal, θD is the Debye temperature, δ3 is the volume per atom, n is the number of atoms in the primitive unit cell, and γ is the acoustic phonon mode Grüneisen parameter. A high Grüneisen parameter leads to low lattice thermal conductivity. Based on first-principles density-functional phonon calculations within the quasi-harmonic approximation, the Grüneisen parameter dispersion of SnSe and PbQ (Q = Te, Se, S) was calculated (see Fig. 4(a)). The Grüneisen parameter γ ∼ 3.13 of SnSe, derived from the longitudinal and shear sound velocities, is much higher than those of ∼1.65, ∼1.69, and ∼1.67 for PbTe, PbSe, and PbS, respectively.136 The high Grüneisen parameter of SnSe suggests weaker interatomic bonding between SnSe slabs, which possibly provides a good stress buffer or ‘cushion’, thus dissipating phonon transport laterally.137 Furthermore, the giant phonon anharmonicity in SnSe single crystals was recently experimentally confirmed by inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements.126 The anisotropy of phonon dispersions is characterized by the phonon dynamical structure factor, S(Q,E), where Q is the neutron wavevector transfer and E is the phonon energy. Fig. 4(b) shows the S(Q,E) sliced along [H,0,2], and [0,K,2] at 100 K, revealing that transverse acoustic (TA) and transverse optical (TO) phonons propagated along Γ–X and Γ–Y, respectively. The TA modes are considerably softer along the Γ–X direction than along the Γ–Y direction. This is consistent with the lower lattice thermal conductivity along the a axis than along the b and the c axis. In addition, both TO and TA branches along the Γ–Y direction are much stiffer than those along the Γ–X direction, accounting for anisotropic thermal transport. Furthermore, phonon dispersions along the Γ–X direction at high temperature are drastically softer than those along the Γ–Y direction. Therefore, a strong anisotropy is revealed by the degree of anharmonicity of phonons. This strong anharmonicity of SnSe derives from a bonding instability that stems from the long-range resonant network of Se p-bonds coupled to stereochemically active Sn 5s2 lone pairs. Apart from the high anharmonicity of chemical bonding, there are other factors that may also result in the extremely low lattice thermal conductivity in single phase SnSe. Using a sophisticated aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), plenty of off-stoichiometric defects in single crystalline SnSe were directly observed.138 As shown in Fig. 4(c), a large number of Se atoms are accommodated at the interlayer interstitial position, while Sn vacancies also exist, leading to an off-stoichiometry Sn:Se atomic ratio. The interesting off-stoichiometric features may arise from the segregation of Sn2+ and Se2− at the solidified state due to a quick cooling rate during the crystal growth process by the vertical Bridgman method. To further validate the effect of off-stoichiometry on the thermal conductivity, almost stoichiometric SnSe was synthesized by the horizontal gradient freezing method at a Sn–Se ratio of 98.9:100. In contrast, this sample exhibits a neat Sn–Se lattice without detectable interstitials. The lattice thermal conductivity is much higher compared with that of the off-stoichiometry single crystalline SnSe with a Sn–Se of 83.5:100.138 These findings suggest that the off-stoichiometric point defects can cause significant phonon scattering. Similar phenomena have also been confirmed in other material systems. Mg interstitials can increase the carrier concentration and Mg vacancies can scatter phonons in Mg2(Si, Sn) solid solution.139 Antisite defects have increased the TE performance of ZrNiSn based half-Heusler alloys and (Bi, Sb)2(Te, Se)3 based materials.57,140

3.3. Multi-valley bands
SnSe presents an extraordinarily complex electronic structure, which contributes to a relatively high power factor in doped SnSe single crystals. Fig. 5 shows the band structures of SnSe with the low-temperature Pnma phase and high-temperature Cmcm phase calculated based on the one-shot GW method and the Berkeley GW code.141 The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of Pnma-SnSe occur at different points of the Brillouin zone, which makes it an indirect band gap semiconductor with a band gap Eg of 0.829 eV. There are multiple valence bands with a small energy window. A small energy difference of ∼0.06 eV is between the first two valence band edges in the Γ–Z direction. And the energy difference between the first and the third band edge is only ∼0.13 eV. When the carrier concentration is as high as 5 × 1019 cm−3, the Fermi level can touch the 4th, 5th, and 6th valence bands, presenting collective contributions to the Seebeck coefficient. In the high-temperature Cmcm phase of SnSe, the valance bands are different from those of the Pnma phase with the parabolic flattened edge of the valence band. Both the VBM and CBM lie in (0.34, 0.50, 0.00) along the X–A direction, showing a direct band gap with a lower Eg of ∼0.464 eV.

Pnma-SnSe has an indirect band gap of 0.829 eV, and Cmcm-SnSe has a direct band gap of 0.464 eV. Both phases exhibit multiple local band extrema that lie close in energy to the global extrema.141 Reproduced with permission from ref. 141. Copyright 2015, AIP Publishing LLC. 
3.4. Thermoelectric properties of SnSe single crystals
A dramatically high ZT of ∼2.6 at 923 K was achieved in SnSe single crystals along the b axis due to the exceptionally low thermal conductivity as shown in Fig. 6(a), while the lowest thermal conductivity is along the a axis with weaker bonding between SnSe slabs. This layered structure causes the anisotropic TE properties along three directions,49 which needs much attention for the correct properties in the same direction. In Table 2, we present the TE properties in different directions for the to date reported SnSe single crystals.

The power factors along the b and c axes are higher than those along the a axis, and much higher than those in other TE materials with intrinsically low thermal conductivity because of the higher carrier mobility in single crystals. The high ZT value at high temperature (near and above 750 K) is also attributed to the structure conversion from Pnma to Cmcm, which helps to reduce the energy gap (from 0.61 eV to 0.39 eV) and enhance the carrier mobility for a higher power factor. However, we must notice the very low ZT values at lower temperature, which will limit their applications. Considering the multi-valley bands in SnSe (Fig. 6(b)), heavily Na-doped SnSe single crystals were prepared to expect the band convergence. With increasing doping content of Na, the carrier concentration increased, pushing the Fermi level deep into the multi-valence bands within a small energy window and increasing the Seebeck coefficient dramatically, which was supported by the room temperature Pisarenko relationship fitted using the multi-valley band structure (Fig. 6(c)). As a result, an increased room temperature ZT of ∼0.7 along the b axis together with a high peak ZT of ∼2.0 at 773 K was realized in Na-doped SnSe single crystals, which gives the highest device ZT of ∼1.34 and a calculated efficiency of ∼16% (Fig. 6(d)) with cold side temperature at 300 K and hot side temperature at 773 K.142 Large size Ag-doped SnSe single crystals were also prepared by a novel horizontal Bridgman method. The highest ZT along the a axis was measured to be ∼0.95 at 793 K mainly due to the low thermal conductivity near the Pnma–Cmcm phase transition temperature.143 A similar high ZT value was also obtained in n-type Bi-doped SnSe single crystals. With increasing content of bismuth, the carrier concentration changed from 5.2 × 1018 cm−3 for undoped SnSe to 8.7 × 1018, 1.7 × 1019, and 2.1 × 1019 cm−3 at 773 K. The success of n-type doping is attributed to the similar atomic sizes between Bi (1.43 Å) and Sn (1.45 Å). Fig. 6(e) presents the comparison of the microstructure for undoped and Bi-doped SnSe samples obtained using a low temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Sn vacancies are widely distributed in undoped SnSe, but absent in Bi-doped SnSe.144 Both p-type and n-type SnSe single crystals have promising high ZT > 2. However, these outstandingly high ZT values need to be confirmed independently.
3.5. Thermoelectric properties of SnSe polycrystals
Studies on high performance SnSe polycrystals were consequently pursued for potentially large scale applications. However, the reported high ZT values in SnSe single crystals are difficult to be realized in polycrystalline samples. Relatively high ZT values ranging from 0.6 to 1.7 at 750–873 K have been obtained in polycrystalline SnSe samples by alloying,146–148 doping,149–160 and microstructure modulation,161–163 but most of the maximum ZT values were under 1.0 as shown in Fig. 7. First, lots of defects induced by the segregation of Sn were frequently observed in polycrystalline SnSe, which can have a strong influence on the carrier mobility and hence on the electrical conductivity and power factor. The carrier mobility is limited to be only ∼50 cm−2 V−1 s−1 for undoped polycrystalline SnSe with a carrier concentration of ∼2.5 × 1017 cm−3,149 which is substantially lower than that of the single crystals of ∼250 cm−2 V−1 s−1 cm−3 at a similar carrier concentration of ∼3 × 1017 cm−3 along the b axis.49 The lower carrier mobility of polycrystalline SnSe decreased the electrical conductivity. Second, a SnO2 layer is easy to form during the preparation of polycrystalline SnSe, since the single crystals have a very low surface area to be exposed to oxidation. The thermal conductivity of SnO2 is about 140 times higher than that of SnSe.164,165 Studies on the surface structure of oxidized single crystalline SnSe showed that there are two different layers on the surface: the outer thin amorphous oxide layer (predominantly SnO2) and a second amorphous Sn1−xSe alloy layer. After long-time oxidation in air, the thickness of the oxide layer increases, while the second amorphous layer only slightly grows.166 This surface oxidation is believed to lead to high thermal conductivity. Therefore, it is very important to well protect the polycrystalline SnSe from the oxidation during the preparation process. We also listed the TE properties of reported p-type and n-type polycrystalline SnSe in Table 3.

3.5.1. Effective doping for p-type SnSe. 
Because of the very low electrical conductivity in polycrystalline SnSe, effective doping is considered as an effective way to increase the carrier concentration and improve the TE performance. However, unlike lead chalcogenides, it is fairly difficult to dope SnSe. In previous reports, various dopants, such as Na, K, Li, Ag, Mg, Zn, Pb, Al, Cu, and Tl as acceptors, and Br, Sb, Bi, I, and In as donors, have been tried. However, most of the dopants cannot effectively increase the electrical conductivity, possibly due to the lower solubility of these dopants in the SnSe lattice. Doping with Ag increased the charge carrier density. A maximum room temperature Hall carrier concentration of ∼9 × 1018 cm−3 was achieved in the Sn0.97Ag0.03Se sample. A continuous increase in the content of Ag failed to further enhance ZT because the secondary phase reduced the carrier mobility and increased the thermal conductivity. A peak ZT value of ∼0.6 at 750 K was obtained in the Sn0.99Ag0.01Se sample.149 More studies were focused on Na-doped SnSe, which has been proven effective in single crystal SnSe.142,145 The carrier concentration has been greatly increased from 1017 cm−3 for undoped SnSe to 1019 cm−3 for Na-doped SnSe, resulting in a highly increased electrical conductivity and power factor. Together with the low intrinsic thermal conductivity, a peak ZT of ∼0.8 at 773 K was achieved in 1.5 atm% Na-doped SnSe along the hot pressing direction.155 Compared with Li and K, Na was found to have the best doping efficiency. All three alkali-metal dopants increased the carrier concentration, but when doped with K or Li, the Hall mobility decreased more sharply, which is mainly due to the larger difference in the atomic size between dopants and the matrix, resulting in a stronger potential-based interaction and carrier scattering.152 Moreover, K doping can prevent the formation of Sn oxides. With the presence of coherent nanoprecipitates in the SnSe matrix for phonon scattering, an impressively low lattice thermal conductivity of ∼0.2 W−1 K−1 and a peak ZT of 1.1 were obtained at 773 K perpendicular to the pressing direction in 1 atm% K-doped SnSe.154 Very recently, high TE performance was achieved in (Na, K)-codoped polycrystalline SnSe by synergistic tailoring of the band structure and atomic-scale defect phonon scattering. The energy offsets of multiple valence bands in SnSe are decreased after Na doping and further decreased by (Na, K)-codoping, resulting in an enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient and power factor. As a result, the maximum ZT value reached ∼1.2 for 1 atm% (Na, K)-codoped SnSe. In addition, (Na, K)-codoping increased the solid solubility of Na and K compared to Na-doping alone. The precipitates observed in the (0.5 atm% Na & 0.5 atm% K)-codoped sample are smaller and the density is lower than that in the 1 atm% Na-doped sample.159
Alloying is another potential way to improve TE performance due to the phonon scattering from point defects for low thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity can be further decreased by alloying with SnS, or SnTe, in spite of the extremely low thermal conductivity in SnSe. It is to be noted that alloying with Te can not only enhance the phonon scattering, but also increase the hole concentrations for higher electrical conductivity. A peak ZT of ∼1.1 at 800 K and an average ZT of ∼0.56 from 300 K to 800 K were found in SnSe1−xTex nanoplates synthesized by a microwave-assisted solvothermal method.169 Studies on the TE properties of Na-doped SnSe1−xTex polycrystals showed that SnSe1−xTex solid solution is formed when x changes from 0 to 0.2. When doped with Na, the carrier concentration increased from ∼7 × 1017 to ∼1 × 1019 cm−3, leading to a high ZT of ∼0.72 at 773 K in Sn0.99Na0.01Se0.84Te0.16.147 When PbSe was alloyed up to 12 mol% with SnSe, single-phase solid solution can be formed, accompanied by a structural transition to high symmetry. Although the lattice thermal conductivity decreased, the impaired mobility induced by a mixed carrier scattering process deteriorated the overall TE performance.172 Another report found that PbSe alloying with SnSe generates a large number of nanoscale precipitates with compositional fluctuation and lattice strains across the interfaces rather than forming solid solutions, further reducing the lattice thermal conductivity.168 Along with 1 atm% Na doping to optimize the carrier concentration, the electrical conductivity and power factor were remarkably improved. A high peak ZT of ∼1.2 at 773 K and an average ZT of ∼0.5 from 300 K to 773 K were achieved in Na0.01(Sn1−xPbx)0.99Se.148
Because SnSe adopts a layered structure, texture-control can be an effective approach to enhance the thermoelectric properties. Higher Hall mobility was observed in the polycrystalline SnSe with highly preferred orientation and textured structures prepared by the zone melting (ZM) method, leading to a higher power factor of ∼9.82 μW cm−1 K−2, almost two times higher than those for polycrystalline SnSe. With the reduction of lattice thermal conductivity by introducing grain boundary scattering, the ZT value was enhanced to over 1 at 873 K.161,162 Ag-doped SnSe polycrystals prepared by the ZM method show a high texturing degree, which exhibited excellent electrical properties and lower thermal conductivity compared with Ag-doped single crystals. As a result, a peak ZT of ∼1.3 at 793 K and an average ZT of ∼0.5 were obtained in zone-melted Sn0.99Ag0.02Se.175
How pressure intrinsically enhances the TE properties of the SnSe-Pnma phase has been studied using density functional theory. At 6 GPa, the a direction exhibits n-type thermoelectric behavior and the estimated ZT value can reach 1.7 at 600 K.176 Experimentally, Cu-doped polycrystalline SnSe has been prepared through a melting and high pressure (6 GPa) sintering method. The highest ZT of ∼0.79 at 823 K was achieved in Sn0.97Cu0.03Se.174 First principles calculations suggested that SnSe undergoes a phase transition from the Pnma to the Cmcm structure in the constant pressure simulation at 7 GPa.177 Recently, Yan et al. reported that SnSe became semimetallic at 12.6 GPa, followed by an orthorhombic to monoclinic structural transition. The electronic transition was confirmed by first principles band structure calculations, and the semimetal character of SnSe can be attributed to the enhanced coupling of Sn-5s, Sn-5p, and Se-3p states under pressure, which results in the broadening of the energy bands and subsequent closure of the energy band gap.178 Furthermore, hydrostatic pressure can effectively reduce the phase transition temperature, leading to a significant enhancement in the power factor of SnSe in the middle-temperature range. The pressure modulated variation of electrical transport and structural properties may pave a new path to enhance the thermoelectric properties of SnSe.179–181


3.5.2. Effective doping for n-type SnSe. 
N-Type SnSe is less studied, in spite of the prediction that n-type SnSe can have higher performance than p-type SnSe. First principles calculation shows that SnSe also has multi-conduction band structures, and the gap between the first and the second conduction band is closer than that in the valence band.182–184 But the electron concentration is too low to realize the band convergence. How to improve the very low carrier concentration is a big issue. Iodine-doped n-type polycrystalline SnSe has been prepared by melting and hot pressing. With increasing content of iodine, the carrier density changed from 2.3 × 1017 cm−3 (p-type) to 5.0 × 1015 cm−3 (n-type) and then to 2.0 × 1017 cm−3 (n-type). The highest ZT of ∼0.8 at 773 K was obtained in SnSe0.97I0.03 along the hot-pressing direction. By alloying with 10 atm% SnS, an even lower thermal conductivity (∼0.25 W m−1 K−1 at 770 K) and an enhanced Seebeck coefficient were achieved, leading to an increased ZT of ∼1.0 at about 773 K in the same direction. Intrinsic Sn defects introduce p-type carriers.150 With 5 atm% extra Sn, the SnSe compound becomes slightly n-type. Together with BiCl3 doping in SnSe0.95, the carrier concentration significantly increased from 2.41 × 1017 cm−3 for SnSe0.95 to 1.07 × 1019 cm−3 for SnSe0.95-0.4 atm% BiCl3, and a high power factor of ∼5 μW cm−1 K−2 and a ZT of ∼0.7 were achieved at 793 K in the n-type SnSe0.95–BiCl3 system.149,156 Br is also an effective dopant to tune SnSe to be an n-type conductor. The carrier concentrations increase from 2.25 × 1017 cm−3 for undoped SnSe to 1.83 × 1018 cm−3 and 1.02 × 1019 cm−3 for SnSe0.97Br0.03 and SnSe0.96Br0.04, respectively. The power factor can be enhanced from ∼2 μW cm−1 K−2 for undoped SnSe to ∼5 μW cm−1 K−2 for 3 atm% Br-doped SnSe. By alloying with PbSe, the power factor was further increased to ∼7 μW cm−1 K−2. A high ZT value of ∼1.2 at 773 K along the pressing direction was achieved in Sn0.9Pb0.1Se0.97Br0.03.153 These great improvements indicate that n-type polycrystalline SnSe is a robust candidate for thermoelectric applications.

4. SnS
SnS is a potential candidate for next generation thin film solar cells because of the appropriate bandgap (1–1.6 eV) and large absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1).185–188 The high ZT value achieved in SnSe inspired TE research on this analogous SnS alloy, which has a similar crystal structure and multi-band structure to SnSe. The crystal structure of SnS adopts an orthorhombic structure (Pnma space group, lattice parameters a = 4.334 Å, b = 11.200 Å, and c = 3.987 Å) with double layers of tightly bound Sn–S atoms.189–191 The layers pile up mainly with the weak and long Sn–S interactions. A second-order displacive phase transition was observed near 878 K, changing from the Pnma phase to a higher symmetric Cmcm phase.119 SnS single crystals show p-type conductivity and a large electrical resistivity (ρ ≥ 10 Ω cm) due to their very low carrier concentration of ∼1016 cm−3.192 First-principles calculations predicted that SnS is a potential TE material if doped heavily and avoided the greatly degraded mobility. For highly hole-doped SnS crystals, a very flat and high ZT value ranging from 1.3 at 300 K to 1.9 at 800 K was predicted. The optimum doping concentration is (2.75–8.01) × 1019 cm−3 for p-type SnS and (6.68–14.02) × 1019 cm−3 for n-type SnS.193 By mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering, Ag-doped SnS was prepared. Ag doping increased the carrier concentration and thereby significantly improved the electrical conductivity. A maximum ZT value of 0.6 was achieved in the Sn0.95Ag0.05S sample at 873 K with a low thermal conductivity below 0.5 W m−1 K−1, higher than that of undoped SnS with a ZT value of ∼0.16 at 823 K.194,195 Considering the similar crystal structure, the TE performance of SnS–SnSe solid solution was also investigated.146,196 A maximum ZT of ∼0.82 at 823 K along the hot-pressing direction was obtained for SnS0.2Se0.8 due to the increase of the carrier mobility and the reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity. Much work is needed for the enhancement of the TE properties of SnS.
5. Summary and outlook
Significant developments have been achieved in environmentally friendly tin chalcogenide TE materials. For SnTe, the focus was on electronic strategies to enhance the power factor, including carrier concentration tuning and band structure engineering (e.g., resonant levels and band convergence), and phonon strategies to reduce the thermal conductivity by simultaneously introducing multiscale scattering centers, including atomic-scale point defects, nanoscale endotaxial precipitates and mesoscale grain boundaries. For SnSe, the intrinsic features (strong anharmonicity and multi-valent bands) were fully exploited to increase both the peak ZT and the average ZT. SnS is believed to have promising TE performance due to its similar crystal structure and band structure to SnSe, but enough experimental work on it is still lacking. High ZT values have been subsequently obtained in both SnTe and SnSe. However, the very high densities of Sn vacancies in SnTe limited the preparation of n-type SnTe. The very low carrier mobility in polycrystalline SnSe degraded the TE performance in SnSe polycrystals.
The current results for tin chalcogenides have clearly shown the validity of most strategies used in other material systems. We expect to see much more successful optimization through other useful strategies, such as modulation doping to increase the low carrier mobility in SnSe and SnS, composites with low thermal conductivity materials and SnTe and SnSe and SnS with high electrical conductivity materials, heavy doping to realize band convergence in n-type SnSe, etc., or even brand new strategies to be discovered for significant ZT enhancement. In addition, many important mechanisms are expected to be further clarified. For example, how does the Sn vacancy affect the electronic and phononic transport in tin chalcogenides and how to control the heavy Sn vacancy in SnTe to obtain n-type SnTe? How does the SnO2 layer influence the TE properties of tin chalcogenides and how to avoid it for higher ZT? How does the phase transition impact the transport properties and how to correctly consider it? Anyway, it is very exciting to see the amazing progress in all these materials related to tin chalcogenide systems. However, because of the abundant vacancy point defects, the crystal lattice has a geometrical distortion, which affects the mechanical properties of tin chalcogenides, especially at higher temperature, leading to a possibly deviation from the real TE properties when measured to higher temperature. Much more research is needed to improve the mechanical properties and long-time thermal stability of the materials and devices for real applications.
