SnO2 with high electron mobility and excellent energy level matching with adjacent perovskites has been considered as an ideal electron transport material with excellent application prospects. However, some surface defects always exist on the SnO2 films prepared by a solution method, which will cause non-radiative recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface. Herein, an interfacial engineering strategy is adopted to eliminate the surface defects and improve the interface performance by modifying the SnO2 with ammonium polyacrylate (PANH4). After the PANH4 treatment, the interfacial defects of the SnO2/perovskite film were reduced significantly and the electron transport was effectively facilitated by the denser SnO2 layer, finally improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. Besides, the grain size of the perovskite increases, simultaneously improving the stability of the device. As a result, the PCE of PSCs with an active area of 0.09 cm2 was increased from 18.91% to 20.70%.
1. Introduction
During the past years, organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made great progress in promoting the power conversion efficiency (PCE),1–5 and developing electron transport layers (ETLs) has become one of the most effective strategies.6–8
SnO2 is a material with high potential in the photovoltaic field. In all transparent conductive oxide materials, F-doped SnO2 has a low price, good working performance, good thermal stability, strong mechanical durability, high chemical stability, and low toxicity. Meanwhile, SnO2, as an ETL material, has many advantages, such as a wide band gap, deep conduction band and valence band, excellent optical and chemical stability, high mobility, easy preparation at low temperature and high transparency in the range of 300–1000 nm. The record for the highest PSC photovoltaic performance is held by devices that using SnO2 as ETL.9
There is also room for improvement of the electron extraction from the perovskite by tuning the SnO2 energy level via doping,10 attributed to the existing preparation techniques of SnO2 that leave many defects. Metal oxides contain surface hydroxyl groups, and these generate trap states.11 These defects will not only affect the growth of perovskite, but also adversely affect the electronic transmission. Most importantly, the resulting defects will greatly affect the stability of the overall device and have a huge impact on the commercial value of the product.
Chemical compounds have been used in perovskite cells as passivating modifiers, and some studies have shown that the addition of chemical compounds into the electron transport layer can help improve the properties of the electron transport layer itself and passivate the defects between the electron transport layer and the optical absorption layer.12–15 Yang et al. introduced EDTA into SnO2 for passivation treatment, and obtained an efficient and stable perovskite solar cell with negligible hysteresis.16 Kim et al. introduced polyacrylic acid into SnO2 quantum dots to strengthen the interaction between the SnO2 layer and the TiO2 layer to improve the efficiency of the overall device.13 Ma et al. treated SnO2 with an asymmetric organic ammonium salt to passivate the ETL surface using electrostatic coupling of I− and Sn4+, where NH4+ also passivates I-defects within the perovskite.19
Here, we use ammonium polyacrylate (PANH4) to modify SnO2 with improved performance. As a simple polymer material, PANH4 has many advantages, such as easy to dissolve in water, excellent dispersion, low toxicity, and cheap availability. Unlike previous work, this material is an NH4+ containing polymer. Due to the nature of the polymer, a very small amount of PANH4 can be used to produce a significant doping effect. It is also cheap and readily available, which may be of interest for subsequent market applications. Since PANH4 is highly soluble in water, and easily dissociates and releases NH4+, the PANH4 aqueous solution appears weakly acidic, and the NH4+ can also be used as the passivation group to interact with Pb2+ in perovskite. Meanwhile, due to its own carbonyl, it can also passivate the hydroxyl group on the surface of SnO2 prepared by a wet method.24
2. Results and discussion
As mentioned above, in order to passivate the surface defects of SnO2, such as hydroxyl defects, we chose a weak acidic polyhydroxy polymer (PANH4) to treat the SnO2 ETLs (Fig. 1). In short, 1 wt% PANH4 and 5.34 wt% SnO2 aqueous solutions were mixed in ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 (hereinafter abbreviated as SnO2/PANH4-1, SnO2/PANH4-2 and SnO2/PANH4-3, respectively). After stirring and dispersing, it was spin coated on the ITO substrate and annealed. As mentioned later, the optimal mixing ratio is 1:3, for simplicity, SnO2/PANH4 refers to SnO2/PANH4-3 unless otherwise specified. Due to the existence of some hydroxyl defects at the surface of the SnO2 film prepared by the wet method, the weak alkaline of the whole film can be reduced by treating the SnO2 precursor with weak acidic PANH4 to avoid the corrosion of perovskite.20 NH4+ is widely proven to have a positive effect on the passivation of internal defects in perovskite,21,22 and the CO of PANH4 also acts on Pb2+ inside perovskite. We add an appropriate amount of PANH4 to the precursor solution of SnO2 for spin coating.

The interaction between PANH4 and the SnO2 surface is further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. As shown in Fig. 2a, the control SnO2 film shows two characteristic peaks located at Sn 3d5/2 (486.57 eV) and Sn 3d3/2 (494.67 eV), respectively. It demonstrates that the peaks for Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 shift toward higher binding energies (486.76 eV and 495.20 eV, respectively) after PANH4 modification, indicating that interaction exists between PANH4 and SnO2. The O 1s spectrum of the SnO2 film can be deconvoluted into two peaks of 530.50 eV ascribed to lattice oxygen and 531.60 eV assigned to chemisorbed oxygen on the surface of the SnO2 film (Fig. 2b and c).23 After PANH4 modification, the strength of lattice oxygen decreases obviously, while the strength of chemisorbed or amorphous oxygen increases. The results show that the carbonyl group acted on the surface of SnO2 and treated the oxygen vacancy and defects of the SnO2 surface well and the reduction of hydroxyl defects. The reason for the increased signal intensity of the chemisorbed oxygen atom should be attributed to the function groups of ester group in PANH4 (Fig. 1), which has also been proved in the work of others.24,25 It should be mentioned that the transmission spectra of both the control and modified films were almost the same (Fig. 2d), which indicated no significant change in the light transmission of the films after PANH4 modification.

The energy level changes of SnO2 films treated with PANH4 were estimated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As shown in Fig. 3a, the cutoff binding energy (Ecut-off) is 17.41 eV for the control SnO2, while 17.64 eV for SnO2/PANH4, and the corresponding work function (WF) values are determined to be 3.81 eV and 3.58 eV, respectively, based on the formula of WF = 21.22 eV – Ecut-off. As shown in Fig. 3b, the Fermi edge (EF,edge) values are estimated to be 4.03 eV for SnO2 and 4.18 eV for SnO2/PANH4. The corresponding valence band positions (EVB) are calculated to be −7.94 eV and −7.76 eV, respectively, based on the formula of EVB = EF − EF,edge. The band gap energy (Eg) is obtained by Kubelka–Munk plotting of the UV-vis absorption spectra, which are almost the same (3.88 eV and 3.89 eV) for these two films (Fig. 3c). Hence, the conduction band positions (ECB) of them are determined to be −4.03 eV and −3.88 eV, respectively, using the formula of ECB = EVB + Eg, and the energy level diagram of PSCs is shown in Fig. 3d, and Fig. S1 (ESI†) is the scheme of the device.17 Besides, the conductivity of the ETL is improved with the introduction of the PANH4 (Fig. S2, ESI†), which may be ascribed to the reduction of surface defects of the SnO2 film and the increase of free electrons donated by the PANH4 interlayer, also contributing to improved interfacial electron transporting.23 However, too much polymer may produce an insulating layer during annealing, resulting in reduced conductivity of the film (Fig. S2, ESI†), affecting the overall charge transmission. Moreover, introduction of a small amount of polymer will not change the overall light transmittance of the ETL (Fig. 2d), which has negligible influence on the generation of photocurrent for high-performance PSCs. In contrast, the absorbance of the perovskite thin film is slightly increased in the visible light absorption range, which may be attributed to the reduction of interface defects, leading to the increase of the grain size of the perovskite thin film, which will be mentioned later.

The surface morphologies of the control and PANH4 modified SnO2 films are characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 4a and b). The root-mean-square roughness of the SnO2 film is 1.71 nm, with the introduction of dopant, the SnO2/PANH4 film roughness increases to 1.91 nm of SnO2/PANH4, and as the polymer concentration increases, the film roughness becomes larger (Fig. S3, ESI†). The increase of roughness can increase the contact between the ETL and perovskite layer and provide nucleation sites for the growth of perovskite.5 In addition, the contact angle measurement shows that the wettability of the perovskite precursor solution on the modified substrate is better, which decreases from the control of 74° to SnO2/PANH4-1 of 54° (Fig. S4a–d, ESI†), this may be attributed to the introduction of hydrophilic groups. This better wettability of the PANH4 modified substrate provides more nucleation sites to promote the crystallization and growth of perovskite on top of it, resulting in the growth of perovskite crystals with a larger grain size and reduced grain boundary defects. The top scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Fig. 4c and d) of the perovskite films deposited on the control and PANH4 modified SnO2 substrates show that both complete perovskite film without pinholes have been grown. In addition, larger grains and more dense perovskite films were obtained in the films on PANH4 treated substrates. The average grain size of the perovskite films deposited on SnO2 and SnO2/PANH4 substrates is 286.86 nm and 305.81 nm, respectively. The surface roughness and contact angle of SnO2 films treated with different concentrations of PANH4 have slight differences. Part of carbonyl in PANH4 can help the film crystallize and promote the growth of perovskite grains.24

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of perovskite films deposited on SnO2 and SnO2/PANH4 substrates is shown in Fig. 5a. Obviously, compared with the original perovskite film, the crystallization degree of the perovskite film on the PANH4 treated SnO2 ETL is significantly enhanced, indicating that the introduction of PANH4 can improve the crystallization quality of the perovskite layer. At the same time, the characteristic signal (12.7°) of PbI2 decreases, which is attributed to the strong interaction between PANH4 and PbI2.26,27 The improved crystallization of the perovskite layer is attributed to the fact that PANH4 can act as efficient heterogeneous nucleation sites to reduce the Gibbs free energy required for nucleation, thereby significantly lowering the energy barrier to promote crystallization. After PANH4 treatment with an optimized ratio of 1:3, the peak intensity of the plane (110) is significantly enhanced (Fig. S5, ESI†). Therefore, the stronger characteristic peak intensity and narrower peak width in the XRD spectrum indicate that the crystallinity of the perovskite film has been improved. Fig. 5b shows that after PANH4 treatment, the light absorption of perovskite films in the range of 400 nm to 500 nm increases slightly, which should be attributed to the increase of crystallinity. The above results strongly proved that the PANH4 surface modification is beneficial to the crystallization of perovskite. These large and vertical grains can reduce non radiative recombination and enhance carrier transport properties.

We constructed the device with the architecture of ITO/ETL/perovskite/Au to measure the space charge limiting current (SCLC) of pure electronic devices. The dark I–V curves of the two kinds of devices are shown in Fig. 6a, and trap density of states (Nt) can be estimated quantitatively using the following function: Nt = 2VTFLεε0/eL2, where ε0 represents the vacuum dielectric constant and ε represents dielectric constant of perovskite, e and L represent the electronic charge and thickness of the perovskite film, respectively. The VTFL of devices based on SnO2 and SnO2/PANH4 substrates is suitable for 0.296 V and 0.259 V, respectively. The corresponding reduction in the trap state density can be obtained. Therefore, PAHN4 treatment significantly inhibited the trap defects on the surface of perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 6b, the carrier recombination and transport behaviors are explored by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The PL intensity of SnO2/PANH4/perovskite on glass substrates is significantly lower than that of the SnO2/perovskite sample, which indicates that the efficiency of electron extraction and delivery at the perovskite/SnO2/PANH4 interface has been enhanced. These two results are mutually verified.

(c) Nyquist plots of the perovskite device fabricated on SnO2 and SnO2/PANH4. (d) J–V curves for champion PSCs with pristine and modified SnO2 under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 G). 
As shown in Fig. 6c, the carrier recombination and transport behavior in PSC were further studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In the Nyquist diagram, the semicircles in the high-frequency and low-frequency regions are related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the composite resistance (Rrec), respectively. The PANH4 modified devices show high composite resistance under dark conditions and open circuit voltage. This result shows that PANH4 treatment on the surface induces both enhanced electron extraction and suppressed interfacial recombination. The typical structure of the PSC device is glass/ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The illuminated J–V curves of champion devices based on SnO2 and SnO2/PANH4 are shown in Fig. 6d, with the main output parameters listed in Table 1.

The control device generates 18.91% PCE in reverse scanning, and the highest PCE reached to 20.70% after PANH4 treatment. The open circuit voltage (Voc) increased from 1.07 V to 1.12 V, which can be attributed to the significant inhibition of carrier recombination between SnO2 and the surface of the perovskite layer. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) is slightly increased from 23.99 mA cm−2 to 24.33 mA cm−2, which is due to the increased absorption and improved carrier collection through the preferred energy level arrangement. The filling factor (FF) of the device increased from 73% to 76%, indicating that the carrier transport and conductivity of the modified ETL were improved. Statistical photovoltaic parameters of 12 individual devices are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The PANH4 modified device showed a higher average PCE (20.15 ± 0.55%) than the control devices (18.00 ± 0.91%). The corresponding statistical histograms of the JSC, VOC, and FF showed relatively good repeatability. From the IPCE spectra (Fig. S7, ESI†), the integrated current densities of battery devices based on SnO2, SnO2/PANH4 are 22.83 and 23.17 mA cm−2, respectively, which follows the same trend as the Jsc obtained from the J–V test (error values less than 5%).
In addition, the control and PANH4 modified devices were stable under RH ∼25% and dark conditions at room temperature (Fig. S8, ESI†). The control PSC was almost 50% degraded after 480 hours of exposure, while the modified PSC still hold an initial efficiency of 80%. The results clearly show that SnO2 modified by PANH4 can significantly improve the stability of PSC. Therefore, the multifunctional groups of PANH4 can improve the crystallinity of the perovskite film, reduce surface defects, improve the interface quality of SnO2/perovskite, inhibit the decomposition of the perovskite film, and contribute to the better stability of PSCs.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a SnO2/perovskite interface defect passivated by doping SnO2 with a carbonyl-containing polymer (PANH4). The defects of the hydroxyl group and oxygen vacancy of SnO2 can be reduced by interacting with carbonyl, and the introduction of some hydrophilic groups leads to a more hydrophilic interface, which is conducive to the formation of a good morphology of the perovskite film and the improvement of the overall crystallinity of the film. At the same time, the preferred band arrangement is induced and the conductivity of the film is improved, which helps to improve the charge extraction from the perovskite to the SnO2 layer. It is worth mentioning that the functional groups of carbonyls and NH4+ can passivate the internal defects of the perovskite film and reduce the trap state density of the perovskite film. Therefore, carrier recombination can be reduced by PANH4 treatment, which improves carrier transport at the SnO2/perovskite interface. As a result, the performance of the PSC is improved, with the champion device producing 20.70% PCE and exhibiting good stability.
