, Accepted 3rd December 2014First published on 10th December 2014AbstractHere for the first time, we demonstrate a novel Mn-doped CuS counter electrode via a facile chemical bath deposition, which exhibited an efficiency of 5.46% comparable to the solar cell based on the bare CuS electrode (4.29%) and Pt electrode (1.37%) under similar conditions.
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) as one of the third generation solar cells are under intense investigation. The structure and working principle of the QDSSCs is similar to that of the dye-sensitized solar cells, except quantum dots (QDs) are used as sensitizers instead of dye molecules.1–3 Interesting properties of QDs such as multiple exciton generation,4 high absorption coefficient,5 tunable band gap6 and hot electron transfer7 have made them prime candidates for the design of next-generation solar cells. Immense efforts have been devoted to improve the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs in the past few years, many of which were focused on the optimization and design of QD sensitizers.8,9 The efficiency of QDSCs was greatly enhanced and the best record of 7.04% has been achieved in a recent report.10
Besides photoanodes, the optimization of counter electrodes (CE) and an electrolyte are equally important path to improve the power conversion efficiency of the QDSSCs. The efficiency of QDSSCs is lower than that of DSSCs, which could be attributed to a high charge-transfer resistance on the counter electrode (CE) surface, and a fast charge recombination at the TiO2/QD/electrolyte interface.11,12 CE plays a crucial role in transferring electrons from the external circuit back to redox electrolytes by catalytic reduction of redox electrolytes. Till date, the optimal polysulfide redox couple (S2−/Sn2−), which can greatly stabilize the cadmium chalcogenides QD sensitizers and provide a relatively good photovoltaic performance.13 It is necessary to find the suitable CE material to greatly improve the performance of the QDSSCs.
It has been confirmed that platinum (Pt) counter electrodes (CEs) have low resistance and superior electrocatalytic activity for the iodide/triiodide redox couple in DSSCs.14 Nevertheless, when iodide/triiodide is used as the electrolyte in QDSSCs; the Pt electrodes have short lifetimes and are expensive. It was reported that Pt CEs have problems when the polysulfide redox couple is used as the electrolyte in QDSSCs. The sulfur-containing compounds in the electrolyte preferentially and strongly adsorb to Pt surfaces, which decrease the conductivity and surface activity of the Pt electrodes and shortens their lifetimes.15 Therefore, various non-platinum materials such as CuS, CoS, PbS, and NiS CEs have been investigated.16 The doping of a PbS counter electrode with Mn metal ions in a QDSSC greatly improves the electrocatalytic activity compared with Pt and PbS CEs, achieving an efficiency of 3.61%.17 The incorporation of transition metal ions can help to improve the catalytic activity of the metal sulfide CE by promoting electron production, thereby improving the performance of QDSSCs.
However, few reports focus on using CuS as CEs in QDSSCs.12,16,18,19 In this work, Mn-doped CuS was in situ grown on FTO glass substrate by a facile chemical bath deposition method and then tested for use in QDSSCs system as CE catalyst without any post-treatment. As a result, the Mn-doped CuS CE showed excellent catalytic activity for polysulfide reduction than the bare-CuS and Pt CEs. Thus, the obtained Mn-doped CuS CE delivered an efficiency of 5.46%, which was comparable to that of the bare-CuS electrode (4.29%) and Pt electrode (1.37%) tested under similar conditions.
The morphology of CuS and Mn-doped CuS on FTO substrate was observed by SEM measurement. The SEM images of chemical-bath-deposited CuS and Mn-doped CuS are shown in Fig. 1. The morphology of the films in Fig. 1 can be characterized as a network of randomly oriented submicron-sized particles uniformly deposited on the FTO surface. All four kinds of particles show uniform particle distribution, which indicates that the crystals of the materials grow very well and have good crystallinity. Notably, no significant changes are observed among the four samples, which demonstrate that minor doping with Mn ion has no effect on the morphology of the CuS materials obtained from the facile chemical bath deposition. The thicknesses of the CuS, 5% Mn–CuS, 10% Mn–CuS, and 20% Mn–CuS films are 691, 688, 646 and 652 nm, respectively. Interestingly, with the addition of Mn concentration form 0 to 10%, the thickness of CuS is reduced from 691 to 646 nm. Upon loading of more Mn (20%) the thickness is increased to 652 nm. A lower thickness results in a lower electrical resistance, which contributes a higher current density and fill factor.20 The introduction of transition metal ions provides many opportunities to alter the structural and electronic properties of the CE, which improves the catalytic ability of the CE by promoting electron production and thereby improves the performance of the resulting QDSSCs.17 The deposition of Mn in the CuS film is well explained by further EDX analysis in Fig. S1.†

X-ray diffraction was used to confirm the phase purity of the as-synthesized CuS film. Fig. 2(A) shows the XRD patterns of CuS thin film on FTO substrate using CBD. The diffraction peaks at 29.3, 32.8, 35.05, 43.1, and 56.3 can be assigned to the crystal planes of (1 0 2), (0 0 6), (1 0 4), (1 0 6), and (2 0 1) for CuS, respectively, with hexagonal structure. The FTO peaks are due to the low thickness of the as-synthesized sample. The diffracted peaks of CuS in the XRD match well with reported values (JCPDS file no. 01-079-2321).

The absorption onset of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe shows an enhanced red-shift compared to bare TiO2 and CdS. Due to that the light absorption range of TiO2/CdS/CdSe providing its application value to enhance the performance of QDSSCs, and the UV-vis absorption graphs are shown in ESI, Fig. S2.† Fig. 2(B) shows the photo-current density–voltage (J–V) curves of CuS and Mn-doped CuS CEs, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The Voc for all reported CEs in Fig. 2(B) shows similar values with slight variation. The CuS was applied as the CE in a QDSSC, which produced a conversion efficiency of 4.29%, and the FF was 0.473, implying satisfactory catalytic activity. To improve the catalytic activity, we attempted to dope the transition metal Mn2+ with the CuS to synthesize the efficient Mn-doped CuS catalyst. The 5% Mn–CuS CE in QDSSC exhibited η of 4.92%, a noticeable improvement-in PCE compared to the undoped CuS. As the Mn content increased to 10%, the QDSSC provided the optimal η of 5.46% with improvements in the Jsc and FF (17.58 mA cm−2 and 0.532). In contrast, further doping of Mn in the CuS (20% Mn–CuS) did not enhance the catalytic activity, resulting in a low Jsc and η of 17.01 mA cm−2 and 5.23%, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters of the Pt CE was found to be (Voc = 0.566 V, Jsc = 7.96 mA cm−2, FF = 0.299, η = 1.37%), respectively. The performance of Mn–CuS is superior to that of the CuS and Pt CEs. The appropriate doping amount of Mn (10 mM) in CuS can effectively catalyse the polysulfide electrolyte in QDSSCs.

EIS analysis was conducted with symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical electrodes to investigate the electrochemical process for the as-prepared CuS, Mn-doped CuS and Pt CEs, which is closely related to the catalytic activity. Fig. 3(a) shows the Nyquist plots for the symmetrical cells. The high frequency in the Nyquist plot of symmetrical cells provides information about the series resistance (Rs). The middle frequency gives information of the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface and the capacitance (Cμ), while the low frequency region provides the Warburg diffusion impedance (Zw) of the polysulfide electrolyte.21,22

The inset in Fig. 3(a) contains the equivalent circuit used to fit the Nyquist plots. The Rs values for the CuS, 5% Mn–CuS, 10% Mn–CuS, 20% Mn–CuS and Pt electrodes are 10.25, 7.93, 7.26, 7.87 and 11.03 Ω, respectively. The Rs decreased gradually for thickness between 691 to 646 nm with Mn doping ranging from 0 to 10%, and further doping of Mn (20%) gives slight increase in thickness (652 nm) with improved Rs value. The low Rs value of the 10% Mn–CuS provides good bonding strength between the Mn–CuS film with the FTO substrate, which in turn promotes the collection of more electrons from the external circuit. The Rct of 5% Mn–CuS is 14.53 Ω smaller than the value of CuS (22.57 Ω), demonstrating that Mn-doped CuS has high catalytic activity in the reducing redox couple. The Rct values of 10% Mn–CuS, 20% Mn–CuS and Pt are 12.98, 14.37 and 65.08 Ω, respectively, indicating both compounds possess good catalytic activity. The lower value of Rct of the novel 10% Mn–CuS reflects the superior charge transfer and electrocatalytic ability at the CE/electrolyte interface. The fact that the Rct of the Pt CE is more than an order of magnitude higher than that of the Mn-doped and undoped CuS CEs indicates that the Pt CE has lower electrocatalytic activity toward the polysulfide electrolyte in the QDSSCs. The higher Cμ value corresponds to higher surface area, leading to better catalytic activity.23,24 Moreover, a larger Zw (12.61 Ω) is obtained for CuS electrode than Mn–CuS electrodes. High Zw value indicates a lower diffusion velocity of the redox couple in the polysulfide electrolyte. The high value Zw of Pt is attributed to the poisoning and deposition of S over the Pt surface tends to increase over all resistance of the electrode.12 The catalytic activity of the these CEs also investigated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a CuS, Mn-doped CuS and Pt symmetric dummy cells, and the corresponding plots are shown in Fig. S3.† The high catalytic activity in Mn-doped CuS caused by the conversion rate of S2− ions is more from oxidized polysulfide Sn2− ions and tends to result in high current values (ESI, Fig. S3†) Table 2.
To confirm the electrocatalytic activity of the CuS, Mn–CuS and Pt electrodes, Tafel polarization measurements were also conducted with a symmetrical cell under dark conditions. Fig. 3(b) shows the Tafel plots with the logarithmic current density (logJ) as a function of voltage (V). The exchange current density (J0) can be calculated from the extrapolated intercepts of two branches of the corresponding Tafel curves. It is directly related to the electrocatalytic activity of the CE. The cathodic and anodic slope of a tangent to the 10% Mn–CdS curve exhibits a larger J0 than that of CuS, 5% Mn–CuS, 20% Mn–CuS and Pt CEs. This result is in good agreement with the EIS values in terms of eqn (1): 
(1)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is Faraday's constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance.
Fig. 4 shows the stability test of QDSSCs with Mn-doped and undoped CuS counter electrodes obtained over 10 h. By comparison, QDSSCs incorporated with the CuS electrode shows the degradation in Voc and more obvious decline of Jsc and FF and consequently η, upon increasing the soaking time from 0 to 10 h. The PCE of Mn–CuS decrease in the first 1 h and after 1 h it maintains a good photovoltaic performance in a course of 10 h as shown in Fig. 4. The increase of PCE in Mn–CuS can be partially attributed to a capillary effect of slow electrolyte solution permeation into the TiO2 and the enhanced ionic transport due to heating of the electrolyte.25 The η of the CuS decreased from 4.29% to 3.28%, and the 10% Mn–CuS showed a change in η from 5.46% to 5.44% in 10 h. There is a slight decline in the Voc (0.583 to 0.574 V) and almost equal Jsc (17.58 to 17.55 mA cm−2) and improved FF (0.532 to 0.539) were obtained in the course of 10 h illumination. The decrease in Voc may be due to an enhancement of the current. The Jsc and FF gain compensates the loss of Voc, resulting in almost constant efficiency during light soaking.26 All of the results indicates that our Mn–CuS CE based QDSSC have much better stability than the bare CuS based CE. From the results, we concluded that the performance of the QDSSC was improved by doping with an appropriate amount of Mn in the CE material.

This experimental evidence confirmed that the incorporation of 10% Mn in the CuS site strongly influences the thickness and properties of the counter electrode by improving the electron transfer rate at the interface of CE/electrolyte, but increases in Mn ions in CuS lower the electron transfer rate, and affect the device efficiency.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that the Mn–CuS prepared on FTO substrate by a simple CBD method and it was much more effective to catalyse the reduction of Sn2− to S2− than bare CuS and Pt CEs. QDSSC based on a 10% Mn-doped CuS electrode of very low thickness, ∼646 nm, gained an improved short-circuit current density of 17.58 mA cm−2, open-circuit photo voltage of 0.583 V, fill factor of 0.532, and overall conversion efficiency of 5.46% under 1 sun illumination. A lower thickness of 10% Mn–CuS CE (∼646 nm) showed lower electrical resistance at the interface of counter electrode/electrolyte, which contributes a high photovoltaic performance than that of bare CuS (∼691 nm), 5% Mn-doped CuS (∼688 nm), 20% Mn-doped CuS (∼652 nm). These confirm that the appropriate amount of Mn ions on CuS was found very effective to improve the surface and electronic properties both in chemical stability and photovoltaic performance. The Mn–CuS can be considered as an alternative CE to CuS and Pt CEs in many applications, owing to its higher electrocatalytic activity, lower charge transfer resistance, and greater stability. Finally, a ∼28% higher power conversion efficiency was achieved by applying a Mn–CuS CE than the bare CuS CE. Therefore, Mn–CuS shows much prospect as the efficient, stable and low-cost CE for QDSSCs.
