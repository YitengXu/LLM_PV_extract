Three cobalt complexes, which are [Co(bpy)3]n+, [Co(phen)3]n+ and [Co(NO2-phen)3]n+, are introduced into the PECD as the redox couples and a self-powered coloring/bleaching process of the cobalt electrolyte-based PECDs is achieved for the first time. The PECD using the [Co(NO2-phen)3]n+ electrolyte presents the highest transmittance modulation of 42.6% at 636 nm between the colored and bleached states. From current–voltage characteristics, it is found that the transmittance of bleached PECD is improved with a higher open-circuit voltage, resulting in an enhanced transmittance modulation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies indicate that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at PProDOT-Me2|electrolyte interface is correlated with the response time for the bleaching process.
1. Introduction
Electrochromic (EC) materials, whose optical properties can be altered reversibly at applied voltages, are expected to be used for modulating visible light.1–3 Smart windows based on EC materials can dynamically modulate solar radiation and thus significantly decrease the energy consumption of buildings.4 To make an electrochromic device (ECD) self-powered, the photoelectrochromic device (PECD) emerged. The first demonstration of a PECD was reported in 1996.5 By replacing the Pt counter electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with a WO3 EC electrode, the device could convert the incident light into electrical energy for powering the electrochromic process of WO3. The advantages of energy-efficient PECDs, being capable of altering optical properties with no need for external potential and outputting electrical power to external circuit, are however somewhat dimmed by the following drawback: the photovoltaic performance is still no match for a typical DSSC because of the fact that less or even no oxidized species is added in the electrolyte in order to improve PECD transparency and then to improve the self-powered coloring/bleaching performance. In view of this, efforts have been made by means of improving the configuration of PECD.6–10 Furthermore, conducting polymer EC materials have also been introduced into PECDs due to their high coloration efficiency.11–14 In our previous studies, poly(3,4-(2,2-dimethylpropylenedioxy)thiophene) (PProDOT-Me2) was employed as the EC material of PECDs, exhibiting favorable performance and strong cycling stability.12,15
In the reported PECDs, I−/I3− electrolyte is commonly used. Nevertheless, PECDs based on conducting polymer EC materials hardly achieved satisfactory transmittance modulation with use of I−/I3− electrolyte,11,14 besides, the relatively dark color of I−/I3− electrolyte limits the transparency of device in the bleached state. By substituting Br−/Br3− electrolyte for I−/I3− electrolyte, conducting polymer EC material-based PECDs obtained remarkable transmittance modulation higher than 40%;13,15 however, the potential toxicity of Br−/Br3− electrolyte would limit its commercial application. As a result, searching alternative redox couples of PECDs has been a highly important topic.
Recently, cobalt complexes are a promising substitute for I−/I3− because they absorb less visible light, possess more positive redox potential and reduced corrosiveness.16–19 More important, by changing the ligand structure, the redox potential of cobalt complexes can be adjusted, and the driving force for dye generation and then the photovoltaic performance can be affected. By introducing electron-withdrawing groups in the ligand, the redox potential of cobalt complexes will be enhanced. On the other hand, the fast recombination at photoanode|electrolyte interface and the mass transportation problem of bulky cobalt complexes through the photoanode make cobalt-based electrolytes challenging.20 More recently, DSSCs using cobalt-based electrolyte have yielded the remarkable photovoltaic conversion efficiency of over 14%.21 And the cobalt redox electrolytes have further proved to be the leading promising electrolyte for DSSCs. In 2014, Taya et al. proposed an energy-harvesting electrochromic window based on an organic dye and [Co(bpy)3]n+ redox couple; however, the coloring process of device was achieved with the need for a bias of 1.5 V.22
In this work, we introduce three kinds of cobalt complex electrolytes in PECD and achieve the self-powered coloring/bleaching process for the first time. The cobalt complexes are CoII/III (2,2′-bipyridine)3 ([Co(bpy)3]n+), CoII/III (1,10-phenanthroline)3 ([Co(phen)3]n+) and CoII/III (5-nitro-1,10-phenanthroline)3 ([Co(NO2-phen)3]n+). With different ligands, [Co(bpy)3]n+, [Co(phen)3]n+ and [Co(NO2-phen)3]n+ possess redox potentials of 0.56 V, 0.61 V and 0.85 V against a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively.18 Since PECD is a combination module based on DSSC and ECD, cobalt electrolytes with different redox potentials are supposed to affect both photoelectric conversion characteristic and optical change performance. Based on this consideration, we performed our work. Our results reveal that cobalt complexes have a great potential in the PECD application, moreover, the successful introduction of cobalt complexes will further broaden the research approach of PECDs.
2. Experimental
The reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and were used as received. Monomer 3,4-(2,2-dimethylpropylenedioxy)thiophene (ProDOT-Me2), 5-nitro-1,10-phenanthroline, [Co(bpy)3](PF6)2, [Co(phen)3](PF6)2 and [Co(NO2-phen)3](PF6)2 were prepared in our laboratory following the published procedures.18,23,24 Ti-nanoxide HT, together with Ruthenium 535-4TBA, was obtained from Solaronix.
2.1. Preparation of electrochromic electrode
Electropolymerization of PProDOT-Me2 film was performed from an electrodeposition bath of 10 mM monomer in a 0.1 M LiClO4/ACN electrolyte in a standard three-electrode system with a clean indium tin oxide (ITO) glass working electrode, a silver wire reference electrode in addition to a platinum sheet counter electrode.23 EC films were obtained at a constant potential of 1.7 V for 4 s. After rinsing gently by ethanol, it is air-dried. The EC film finally obtained presented a thickness of 180 nm.
2.2. Preparation of dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode
A transparent TiO2 film was prepared by doctor-blading a TiO2 nanoparticle paste onto the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass. Afterward, the film was sintered at 500 °C for 45 min. The thickness of TiO2 film was measured to be 2 μm. Dye adsorption was carried out by immersing the TiO2 electrode into methanol solution of 0.3 mM Ruthenium 535-4TBA for 20 h in a glove box. Then the electrode was rinsed by ethanol for subsequent use.
2.3. Fabrication of the photoelectrochromic device
The redox electrolyte consisted of 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 0.15 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M [Co(L)3](PF6)2 in acetonitrile/ethylene carbonate (6/4, v/v), where L represents the different ligands. PECDs were assembled by arranging the EC electrode and the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode facing each other. The electrolyte was introduced to fill the space between the two electrodes. The configuration of PECD is schematically presented in Fig. 1.

2.4. Characterization
Thicknesses of EC film and TiO2 film were measured by a surface profiler (Dektak; Veeco). Electrochemical impedance spectra were measured using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D; CH Instruments). The spectra were obtained within the frequency scope of 104 to 0.1 Hz as well as with an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The applied bias was set at open-circuit potential. Optical characteristics of PECDs were measured with a spectrometer (USB 2000+; Ocean Optics). Current–voltage measurements were performed with a solar simulator (OTENTO-SUN II; Bunkoukeiki Co. Ltd.).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Optical performance of PECDs
When the PECD is illuminated in short-circuit state, electrons generated by excited dye molecules transfer to the TiO2 conduction band, then transport to the EC film via the external circuit. Meanwhile, Li ions existing in the electrolyte intercalate into the EC film for keeping the balance of charge. Correspondingly, the transparent EC film turns into deep blue color. The oxidized dye molecules get reduced by CoII species existing in the electrolyte. The bleaching process can be achieved in open-circuit state under illumination. In this case, it is impossible for electrons to transport to the EC film via the external circuit, but electrons from EC film can still be captured by the oxidized species, which are produced in the coloring process. Meanwhile, Li ions are driven out from the EC film, resulting in the bleaching process.
Fig. 2 shows the transmittance spectra of the PECDs based on three cobalt complex electrolytes. The wavelength of the maximum transmittance modulation was determined to be 636 nm. The PECD using [Co(bpy)3]n+ electrolyte exhibited a transmittance modulation of 25.5% at 636 nm, with 10.3% and 35.8% for the colored and bleached states, respectively (Fig. 2a). The fully coloring state of device was achieved, whereas the fully bleaching state could not be reached. The PECD using [Co(phen)3]n+ electrolyte exhibited an improved transmittance modulation of 36.0% at 636 nm, with 12.0% and 48.0% for the colored and bleached states, respectively (Fig. 2b). Compared to the device using [Co(bpy)3]n+ electrolyte, the transmittance of bleached device was largely enhanced, while the transmittance in the colored state only showed a slight increase. The PECD using [Co(NO2-phen)3]n+ electrolyte revealed the highest transmittance modulation of 42.6% at 636 nm, with 13.0% and 55.6% for the colored and bleached states, respectively (Fig. 2c). In this case, the fully bleaching state of device was achieved. The declining transmittance of the bleached device below 600 nm was caused by the light adsorption of dye molecules and cobalt electrolytes.

The in situ transmittance response stability of PECDs recorded at 636 nm between the colored and bleached states by switching the on and off states of external circuit is shown in Fig. 3. The time necessary to alter its 95% transmittance modulation is defined as the response time here. With the external circuit switched to the short-circuit state, the transmittance of the PECD rapidly decreased. With the external circuit switched to the open-circuit state, the transmittance of the PECD increased. In Fig. 3a, for the initial cycles, PECD using [Co(bpy)3]n+ electrolyte exhibited response times of 2.0 s and 5.5 s for coloring and bleaching processes, respectively. The stability of device was also tested. It can be seen that the response time after 1000 cycles almost showed no degradation, indicating a very good stability. In Fig. 3b, using [Co(phen)3]n+ electrolyte, the PECD similarly exhibited a robust cycling stability over 1000 cycles. The response times for coloring and bleaching processes were 2.0 s and 7.0 s, respectively. In Fig. 3c, with use of [Co(NO2-phen)3]n+ electrolyte, the response times for initial coloring and bleaching processes were 3.6 s and 20.0 s, respectively. After 1000 cycles, a marked degradation was observed. This could be attributed to the lower stability of [Co(NO2-phen)3]n+ complex caused by the strong electron-withdrawing groups on ligands.19

3.2. Photovoltaic performance of PECDs
To figure out the cause of the distinct optical performances of PECDs, the current–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed under 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 4). The PECD based on [Co(bpy)3]n+ electrolyte exhibited the highest short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.44 mA cm−2 and the lowest open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.52 V. The PECD based on [Co(phen)3]n+ electrolyte exhibited the Jsc of 0.60 mA cm−2 and the Voc of 0.57 V. The PECD based on [Co(NO2-phen)3]n+ electrolyte exhibited the lowest Jsc of 0.43 mA cm−2 and the highest Voc of 0.62 V.
 Fig. 4  Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of PECDs based on cobalt complex electrolytes. 
It can be found that the Jsc value of PECD decreased and the Voc value increased with the enhanced redox potential of cobalt electrolytes. As for the coloring process, the electrochemical reaction of EC materials was affected by the injected electrons from external circuit, which can be deduced from the Jsc value of device. With decreased Jsc value, the coloring process of device was slowered, moreover, the transmittance of device in the colored state was slightly enhanced. It also suggests that a Jsc value of 0.43 mA cm−2 was sufficient to accomplish the coloring process of PProDOT-Me2 film. The bleaching process of EC material was achieved by building up a positive potential at EC electrode in open-circuit state under illumination. It is found that the higher Voc is good for the improved transmittance of bleached PECD. Nevertheless, the photovoltaic conversion efficiencies of devices in this work were still low, in future work, it is necessary for us to make efforts to find other dyes for the propose of better photovoltaic property.
3.3. Electron transfer studies between redox electrolyte and PProDOT-Me2 film
The bleaching process of PECD is much slower than the coloring process, since the electrons in open-circuit state are extracted from the EC film involving the electron transfer reaction. To investigate the electron transfer process at EC film|redox electrolyte interface, EIS measurements of EC films were performed in a solution containing 1.0 mM CoII complex and 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile (Fig. 5). The semicircle in high frequency is attributed to the double layer capacitance (Cμ) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the EC film|electrolyte interface. It can be seen that the Rct value was affected by cobalt complex variety. By fitting the Nyquist plots to an equivalent circuit diagram,25 some important parameters were obtained. The Rct values for [Co(bpy)3]n+, [Co(phen)3]n+ and [Co(NO2-phen)3]n+ were 55.9, 115.1 and 151.5 Ω, respectively. The Rct value increased with the enhanced redox potential of cobalt electrolytes. The lowest Rct occurred at PProDOT-Me2|[Co(bpy)3]n+ electrolyte interface, while the highest Rct occurred at PProDOT-Me2|[Co(NO2-phen)3]n+ electrolyte interface, indicating that the higher value of Rct is responsible for the slower bleaching process of PECD.

4. Conclusions
In this work, three cobalt complex electrolytes, which are [Co(bpy)3]n+, [Co(phen)3]n+ and [Co(NO2-phen)3]n+, are introduced into PECD. Using [Co(bpy)3]n+ electrolyte, the PECD presents a transmittance modulation of 25.5% at 636 nm, with 10.3% and 35.8% for the colored and bleached states, respectively. The PECD based on [Co(phen)3]n+ electrolyte provides an improved transmittance modulation of 36.0%, and the PECD based on [Co(NO2-phen)3]n+ electrolyte gives the highest transmittance modulation of 42.6%, with 13.0% and 55.6% for the colored and bleached states, respectively. Furthermore, PECDs using [Co(bpy)3]n+ and [Co(phen)3]n+ electrolytes exhibit good cycling stability over 1000 cycles. The current–voltage characteristics of PECDs indicate that the higher Voc is good for the higher transmittance of bleached PECD, and the higher Jsc benefits the faster coloring process, meanwhile a Jsc of 0.43 mA cm−2 is sufficient for the electrochromism of EC film. With EIS study, we find that the higher charge transfer resistance (Rct) at PProDOT-Me2|electrolyte interface results in the slower bleaching process. As a result, our research reveals the great potential of cobalt complex in PECD application.
