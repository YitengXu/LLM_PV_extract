    , Accepted 25th May 2021First published on 25th May 2021AbstractQuantum dots (QDs) with unique properties have been widely employed for energy, environmental, and health care applications. Green natural resources, because of their renewability, sustainability, abundance, low cost, and environmental-friendliness, can be utilized for the synthesis of diverse nanoarchitectures. This critical review highlights the recent advancements in the greener and sustainable synthesis of carbon, graphene and metal-based QDs, as well as their significant environmental applications such as photocatalytic hydrogen production, degradation of hazardous contaminants/pollutants and reduction of CO2, with emphasis on the important challenges and future perspectives.
1. Introduction
In classical photocatalysis processes, particulate catalysts form a pair of adsorption bands between the electron of the conduction band (ecb−) and the hole of the valence band (hvb+) to absorb photons having energies equal to or more than that of the band gap of the material.1 The valence and electron bands can contribute to the redox reaction of water treatment, but the dominant oxidants are hydroxyl radicals (˙OH).2 Although photocatalysts are inherently destructive, the atmospheric oxygen in the ambient conditions can suffice alone as an oxidant. By employing sunlight as the light source for the photocatalysis, this process becomes very cost-effective.3,4 The photocatalytic reactions have some fundamental requirements, including sufficient utilization of the solar spectrum, effective redox reactions on the surface and rapid migration of the charge carriers.5 Nanomaterials can play important roles for designing and developing innovative and efficient photocatalysts with controllable characteristics, via energy gap enlargement and modification of surface and bulk features.6 In the category of nano-sized materials, quantum dots (QDs) with a typical size below 10 nm have revolutionized the field of photocatalytic applications.7 QDs have some inimitable properties, including up-conversion ability and large two-photon absorption cross-sections,8 nontoxicity, renewability, tunable chemical activity and excellent selectivity, which make them as one of the best candidates for photocatalysis.9–11 QDs with conjugated π structures are best known for their dual character, the redox systems acting as electron reservoirs, and electron transfer mediators, promoting their photocatalytic performance.12–14 Additionally, QDs are able to transfer several photons with low energy to photons having a higher energy level; this characteristic is an anti-Stokes-type emission, which is also called an upconversion process, by which fluorescence emission takes place as a result of the sequential absorption of photons at a wavelength shorter with respect to the excitation wavelength.15,16 Furthermore, diverse functional groups on the surface of QDs are associated with the enhancement of their aqueous solubility, giving rise to an opportunity to functionalize them with the aid of a wide range of inorganic, organic, polymeric and biological materials.17–19
Generally, various methods are deployed for synthesizing QDs, including microwave radiation,20,21 solvothermal methods,22,23 hydrothermal treatment,24 ultrasonication,25,26 laser ablation,27,28 arc discharge,29,30 and oxygen plasma treatment.31 Despite great advances in synthesis methods, the extensive applications of QDs are restricted due to the harsh reaction conditions, toxic precursors and complex surface passivation procedures. In this regard, greener and sustainable syntheses of QDs using affordable, clean, biocompatible, nontoxic and attainable natural renewable resources are focused on by researchers. However, the large-scale and commercial production of QDs through these greener strategies is still a critical challenge in view of the multiplicity of factors affecting the synthesis procedures, as well as difficulties in optimization, purification and stabilization procedures.
In this paper, we focus on reviewing the photocatalytic activity of carbon, graphene, and metallic QDs synthesized through greener and sustainable methods for photocatalytic applications with a focus on environmental applications. The improvements in photocatalytic properties of these QDs are also highlighted.
2. Greener and sustainable synthesis of QDs
QDs are conventionally found as double-layer materials in which a metal core capable of fluorescence transmission is encased in a shell-forming component to prevent photobleaching or leakage.32,33 The main problem of semi-conducting conventional QDs is their toxicity, which arises from the presence of heavy metals in their structure.34 Even a very low amount can have devastating effects on living resources and humans as a consequence of the entry of heavy metals into their structure during the production process.35 Natural-based QDs (NQDs) have gained the enthusiastic approval of researchers due to their promising features, including environmental-friendliness, biocompatibility, abundance, aqueous solubility and diverse functionality compared with conventional QDs.36 NQDs are much more acceptable and affordable, because they can be prepared by the conversion of bio-wastes into green and value-added materials.37 The synthesis of NQDs via greener and sustainable methods has some important advantages such as low toxicity, cost-effectiveness, and simplicity; however, some critical tips for these synthesis procedures are controlling the size/morphology, preventing nanomaterial accumulation/aggregation, and also paying attention to the surface characteristics.
The precursors for manufacturing of NQDs can be widely varied from milk, honey and fruit juices to pepper, garlic, coriander, curcumin, rice husks, watermelon or pomelo peels, capsicum, grass, plant leaves, bacteria and synthetic polymers.38–41 Hoan et al.42 have synthesized highly luminescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) from lemon juice through a one-pot hydrothermal method with the quantum yield in the range of 14.86 to 24.89%. Liu et al.43 utilized carrot juice for synthesizing carbon dots via hydrothermal treatment which resulted in a quantum yield of 5.16%. In another study, CQDs (quantum yield of 32%) have been synthesized from banana juice with no requirement for surface passivation, oxidizing agent and inorganic salt.44 Additionally, Murugan et al.45 prepared highly fluorescent CQDs by pyrolysis of finger millet or ragi (Eleusine coracana).
Zhang et al.46 proposed a one-step hydrothermal method for preparing CQDs from egg white, which led to a high quantum yield of 61%. Chitosan can also be utilized as a bio-macromolecule precursor for the synthesis of QDs.47,48 In one study, Kumar et al.49 synthesized nitrogen-doped GQDs using low-cost and nontoxic chitosan biopolymer as a carbon and nitrogen precursor by chemical vapor deposition. Additionally, a solvothermal synthesis method was reported for the preparation of graphene QDs (GQDs) from coal,50 and also Chen et al.51 have developed a facile route to synthesize GQDs from high molecular weight starch. The structure of such QDs is highly tunable in terms of the size, zeta potential, surface functionalization as well as cytotoxicity of the QDs. One can simply modify their surface as well via adsorbing leaf extracts, which is responsible for the incorporation of several functional groups into their structure. The chemistry of QDs has been accordingly developed with the aid of different types of ligands/linkers attached to the surface.
The greener synthesis of QDs by recycling of biowastes is attractive for researchers as it can reduce/prevent environmental pollution. For instance, Kang et al.52 indicated that biowastes could be employed for preparing CQDs due to their abundance, eco-friendly nature, accessibility and use of low-cost renewable raw materials such as cellulose, hemicellulose, carbohydrates, lignin, and proteins. Abbas et al.53 reviewed facile, low-cost and scalable approaches for preparing biowaste-derived GQDs. Microorganisms are known as the other resources for synthesizing a variety of inorganic nanomaterials such as metal and metal oxide QDs in an energy-saving manner from non-toxic and renewable precursors. For instance, Escherichia coli cultures as bacterial cells were employed for synthesizing CdS and CdS/CdSe core–shell QDs having sizes of ca. 12 and 17 nm, respectively, to obtain green, cost-effective photovoltaic devices.54 Additionally, Órdenes-Aenishanslins et al.55 synthesized ternary CdSAg QDs by Escherichia coli BW25113 in a mixture of CdCl2, cysteine, and AgNO3, with a size below 15 nm. In another study, Mala et al.56 produced ZnS as semiconductor QDs using Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC 2918 fungus, and Syed and Ahmad57 utilized a Fusarium oxysporum fungus for room-temperature synthesis of exceedingly fluorescent CdTe QDs with a mixture of CdCl2 and TeCl4.
The utilization of diverse natural resources results in the formation of different functional groups on the surface of NQDs, such as thiol, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and so on, that improves their quantum yields. Natural resources may contain three types of bioactive molecules: (i) basic constituents such as alkaloids, polyphenolic, and phenolic compounds; (ii) acidic components including ascorbic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, tannin, flavonoids, and polyphenols; and (iii) neutral ingredients such as carbohydrates.58–60 The surface functionality, reactivity, particle size and quantum yield of QDs can be tuned by these bioactive components.
Synthesis methods can significantly affect the physicochemical characteristics of QDs. The ability to control the shape and size of QDs depends on the reaction conditions and routes of synthesis. Basically, according to the reaction mechanism, the synthesis of QDs can be conducted by two main techniques: bottom-up and top-down.61 Bottom-up techniques make possible the development of larger structures from smaller ones via dehydration or dehydrogenation in which individual atoms/molecules interact with each other by applying microwave, hydro- or solvothermal degradation, or thermal pyrolysis to yield QDs with a controllable size and morphology.58 However, these techniques may be time-consuming and multicomplex. Additionally, the low crystallinity of the products, finding appropriate dopants for heteroatom substitution in the lattice, and the complexity of reaction mechanisms in bottom-up methods are the significant challenges for future research in this field. On the other hand, top-down techniques consist of converting large domains into smaller ones by removing some parts through chemical oxidation or mechanical shearing including laser ablation, arc discharge, and ultrasonic methods, which usually results in high-yield QDs;62,63 top-down methods are simpler and easier than bottom-up techniques, and also are time-saving approaches.64,65 Some important synthesis methods of producing QDs from low-cost and natural resources by emphasizing hydrothermal photoreduction, precipitation, carbonization, microwave irradiation, wet impregnation, pyrolysis, and heating methods are summarized in Fig. 1 and Table 1.

2.1. Hydrothermal method
Hydrothermal or solvothermal methods are simple, cheap, rapid, environmentally friendly, and nontoxic methods for the preparation of QDs from various precursors (Table 2). The solution of starting materials is reacted and sealed in a hydrothermal reactor under high temperature and pressure conditions.96 QDs can be prepared using hydrothermal methods from different natural precursors such as protein,97 glucose,98 and fruit juice99etc. In one study, Jahanbakhshi and Habibi100 developed a simple, low-cost, and green hydrothermal method for synthesizing CQDs from the salep natural polymer, which was carbon-based in water as a synthesis environment at 180 °C. Additionally, He et al.101 synthesized fluorescent CQDs via a hydrothermal method from lemon juice in the presence of ethanol at 120 °C, which resulted in CQDs with a size of 3.1 nm. CQDs were prepared from chitin, chitosan and graphite via a hydrothermal method at 200 °C.102 The combination of these renewable precursors resulted in the formation of various functional groups on the surface of CQDs in the form of amine groups with carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. In another study, Atchudan et al.103 utilized banana peel waste for the hydrothermal synthesis of CQDs in the presence of deionized water at 200 °C, which resulted in narrow-size-distribution CQDs (∼5 nm) with a good quantum yield of 20%. Wang et al.104 prepared sulfur-doped GQDs through hydrothermal treatment of durian flesh with deionized water at 150 °C using platinum (Pt) sheets as the catalyst. They found that the Pt sheets had a critical role in forming the honeycomb sp2 and thiophene structure of sulfur-doped GQDs since poor crystalline quality was obtained without the Pt catalyst. Additionally, Bao et al.105 developed an efficient bacterial hydrothermal synthesis method for the production of CdTe QDs using Escherichia coli, with a quantum yield of 15%. The most interesting point about the use of different kinds of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains is that they are both able to act as a reducing agent at the same time as a stabilizing agent. Besides, they can be removed from the medium by increasing the temperature and/or pH value. On the other hand, the use of bacterial strains could help scientists to reduce the bacterial resistance in different microenvironments along with enlarging the industrial application window of these types of biosynthesized QD.

2.2. Precipitation method
The precipitation method is a convenient approach for synthesizing QDs (Table 3). Conventionally, an acidic solution such as HCl, HNO3, or H2SO4 or a base solution like NH4(OH), NaOH, or KOH is added dropwise into a mixture of metal/chalcogenide, which results in metal chalcogenides precipitating through the chemical reaction.140 Then, ultracentrifugation and vacuum filtration are applied for the separation of precipitates. Besides, some surfactants and salts of the various anions including NaCl, KCl, KSCN, NaBr, KBr, KI, NaI, NaAc and CH3COONa have been utilized for facilitating the reaction.141 The rate of precipitation and nature of the precipitant are important parameters that remarkably affect the particle size and morphology of the QDs. Additionally, magnetic stirring interval and droplet size noticeably can affect the size and properties of the QDs. For instance, Bhuvaneswari and Radjarejesri142 synthesized cadmium sulphide (CdS) QDs though a chemical precipitation method using papaya peel extract. The small pieces of papaya peel were boiled with deionized water at 100 °C and then filtered and employed as a capping agent. Notably, the temperature would decline by 30% in some cases, leading to removal of the extracts achieving an optimized yield. This phenomenon is depended upon the solvent, solute and other types of cations/anions present in the solution. The CdS precipitate was mixed with the papaya peel extract by a magnetic stirrer for about 18 h to obtain QDs with a size of 2.7 nm. Additionally, Yu et al.143 prepared folic-acid-modified CuS QDs through a green and easy co-precipitation method, and these were capped with chitosan as schematically shown in Fig. 2a. CuCl2·2H2O was magnetically stirred into the acidic (HCl) aqueous solution of chitosan as the surface ligands. Then, Na2S solution was added dropwise and magnetically stirred for 6 h to prepare the CuS QDs. By conjugation of FA on the CuS–CS QDs the samples obtained had an average diameter of about 4 nm (Fig. 2b). The TEM image of CuS–CS–FA QDs showed obvious lattice fringes with a d-spacing of about 0.189 nm which confirmed the (1 1 0) plane of the hexagonal structure of the CuS crystal. XRD and XPS patterns of samples (Fig. 2c–e) indicated the formation of covellite CuS, and FA conjugation had no distinguishable impact on the phase and composition of the QDs. Pavan Kumar et al.144 synthesized spherical zinc oxysulfide (ZOS) QDs (∼3.6 nm) using Aegle marmelos fruit extract and ZnSO4 solution through a facile precipitation route. The mixture was stirred for 20 min to achieve the ZOS precipitate.

2.3. Carbonization method
Carbonization is a simple procedure widely employed for preparing nanomaterials; different types of raw material can be selected for the production of QDs through the carbonization method. This method can enhance the chances of forming abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of QDs, which results in an indication of excellent water solubility; additionally, by applying the carbonization process, the surface functional modification of QDs is possible.152,153 The structures and properties of carbonized QDs are affected mainly by the type of starting material and preparation conditions such as temperature, time, and chemical additives. Moreover, pH triggers could affect the carbonization process; but the rate of such an alteration is not too great.152
Chitosan is a polysaccharide rich in amino (–NH2) and hydroxyl (–OH) functional groups, which can be found in large quantities in nature.154 Liu et al. utilized chitosan as a natural source of carbon in the synthesis of CDs through one-step carbonization;155 chitosan was heated at 300 °C for 2 h under nitrogen conditions followed by cooling to ambient temperature. The resulting dark brown syrup was mechanically ground to collect fine powders properly dispersed within water, and then the obtained CQDs were collected by filtration. CQDs are expected to impact on manipulate the type and kinetics of the reaction based on the greener synthesis of QDs with polysaccharides, where the C/N ratio is a key in this kind of synthesis. Typically, a low ratio of C/N is responsible for a non-homogenous morphology, and in some cases QDs with heterogeneous morphology are synthesized. The morphology considerably governs the photocatalytic activity of the QDs. By contrast, a high ratio of C/N would increase the reaction time for a given range of temperature/pH, in this way controlling the morphology/structure of QDs.
Varisco et al.156 utilized dried wine lees for the preparation of CQDs by carbonization for 3 h at 300 °C under an air atmosphere, which resulted in a quantum yield around 6%. In another study, a simple, facile, low-cost and rapid acidic carbonization of sucrose was explored to obtain sulphur-doped CQDs with a quantum yield of 5.77%.157 A slurry-like mixture was obtained by mixing sucrose and H2SO4 and was kept in a hood undisturbed until the formation of a porous carbon cake that was crushed, stirred in water and filtered to get sulphur-doped CQDs. Kwon et al.158 deployed the emulsion-templated carbonization of glucose for synthesizing CQDs, and this was combined with in situ nitric acid treatment to obtain high quantum yields up to 53%. Despite all the advantages of this method, there are still some challenges, especially regarding the long reaction time. Additionally, during the carbonization synthesis of QDs, carbonaceous aggregation may occur, which can be prevented using electrochemical or pyrolysis methods.
2.4. Microwave irradiation
Unlike the hydrothermal method, microwave (MW) irradiation of organic precursors is a rapid and affordable approach for synthesizing QDs; this method can not only merely shorten the reaction time but also improves the quantum yield. There is sufficient evidence for the superiority of MW-based synthesis of QDs over electrochemical, hydro- and solvothermal, and pulsed-laser based routes because of it being greener, faster, and cheaper.159 Moreover, since they can be obtained from biomass and microorganism processes, there is no need to use chemicals in the MW-assisted synthesis of QDs.145,160,161 Therefore, the MW irradiation method as a fast heating technique is widely used for synthesizing QDs. For instance, Mahmoud et al.162 employed a rapid MW irradiation pyrolysis method for synthesizing CQDs in only 10 min inside a MW oven at 700 W from a solution of starch in deionized water. Additionally, Zhao et al.163 synthesized CQDs from a nitrogen-rich precursor (ethylenediamine) and a carbon-rich resource (natural kelp) by applying MW irradiation at 800 W for 10 min. The average diameter of the CQDs was ca. 3.7 nm with a quantum yield of 23.5%.
Ganguly et al.164 synthesized N-rich carbon dots via MW irradiation of melamine and L-arginine in a domestic MW oven (750 W) for 8 min, which resulted in CQDs with an average size of 2.4 nm and a quantum yield of 58%, as shown in Fig. 3. In another study, Moradi Alvand146 employed two green extraction routes, i.e. based on MW (270 W in 15 min) and ultrasonic (15 min at 45 °C) treatment for the synthesis of QDs based on cadmium telluride (CdTe) from liquefied Ficus johannis plant. The average particle size of the resulting CdTe QDs was found to be 1.2 nm. Besides, Van Tam et al.165 prepared amine-functionalized GQDs from glucose, H2O2, and NH3 solution through a one-pot MW-assisted method under 700 W irradiation for 4 min; the obtained GQDs possessed a high quantum yield of 39% with an average size of 3.78 nm.

2.5. Wet impregnation method
Wet impregnation is a well-known simple and most widely employed method in the development of catalysts. In this method, metals, metal oxides and metal chalcogenides are immobilized on a porous or non-porous support; the precursor solution is dissolved in a solvent containing a support material and stirred magnetically for several hours until the formation of an equilibrium adsorption of metal ions. Then, vacuum filtration is deployed for the separation of the support material with its adsorbed metal ions, and the product is dried. The product is then loaded into a tubular furnace and calcined under different atmospheres such as nitrogen, hydrogen, air, H2S and argon gas to produce the metal-loaded support material. For obtaining a stronger interaction between the surface of the catalyst and the support, they can be put in a nut shell.166 Different kinds of semiconductors including TiO2, ZnO, CdS, and Bi2O3 can be utilized as support materials. Mehta et al.167 detected toxic lead (Pb) ions by fluorescence CQDs, and then by impregnation of TiO2 into the Pb–CQDs composite, applying it for the photodegradation of detrimental dyes. For this purpose, CQDs were synthesized from ascorbic acid and Kollicoat, and utilized for the preparation of the Pb–CQDs–TiO2 composite by the wet impregnation method.
2.6. Biological synthesis of QDs

2.6.1. Biosynthesis of CQDs. 
Biological synthesis of QDs follows the principles of green chemistry, because no harmful chemicals are used, high temperature and pressure are avoided and the production of by-products is minimized. Bacteria and yeasts/fungi have become a major carbon source due to easy preparation, cost-effectiveness and low environmental impact. In recent years, researchers have become interested in the production of biologically synthesized QDs. Wang et al.168 synthesized blue fluorescent CQDs derived from the yeast Cryptococcus podzolicus 5–2 via a hydrothermal method. Firstly, they incubated the culture of C. podzolicus 5–2 in yeast extract peptone dextrose medium (28 °C) for 24 h. Then the collected samples were kept in a high-pressure autoclave at 200 °C for 6 h to react and produce CQDs. It was indicated that the prepared CQDs had a uniform spherical structure with an average size of 4.8 nm and a quantum yield of 3.99%. Amjad et al.169 synthesized CQDs from Pectinodesmus sp. through a green hydrothermal method. The Pectinodesmus sp. was sub-cultured in Bold's basal medium and maintained at 26–28 °C for 14 days, and then the growth microalgae were harvested and dried. The dissolved dried microalgae in deionized water at 50–60 °C were placed into a Teflon autoclave at 200 °C for 3 h to obtain CQDs. Gao et al.170 used beer yeast as a precursor for synthesizing CQDs. Beer yeast as a safe food with proteins, vitamins, nucleic acids and glutathione in its structure can be used as a carbon source for preparing CQDs. Accordingly, the prepared CQDs with a high quantum yield of about 21% were obtained from beer yeast with low toxicity. Qin et al.171 synthesized fluorescent CQDs via a hydrothermal approach from tryptone and yeast extract at 200 °C for 12 h. It was indicated that the prepared CQDs exhibit a blue fluorescence emission at 422 nm with good solubility and stability in aqueous solutions. In addition, they found that the synthesized CQDs had high ionic strength in a wide pH range and particular photostability under UV irradiation. Wu et al.172 prepared CQDs from yeast extract powder on a large scale with a high quantum yield of about 65.8%. They showed that the obtained CQDs had high dispersibility in water with uniform size. Wang et al.173 used cyanobacteria as a low-cost biomass for a carbon source to develop water-soluble CQDs via a hydrothermal approach (Fig. 4). The cyanobacteria-derived monodisperse CQDs had an average diameter of 2.48 nm and displayed excitation-dependent emission with a quantum yield of 9.24%. In addition, the obtained CQDs indicated no photobleaching under long-term UV irradiation with high photostability in a wide range of pH and salinity. The prepared QDs showed low cytotoxicity since no hazardous chemical was used in the synthesis procedure for the CQDs.

2.6.2. Biosynthesis of metal selenide QDs. 
The microbial preparation of metal selenide (MeSe) QDs is a complex method due to the re-oxidization of the aqueous selenide (HSe−) to Se(0) in the presence of oxygen, which requires a strong reducing agent like sodium borohydride for producing HSe−.174 Nevertheless, a few studies focused on the reduction of Se(0) to produce HSe− by applying microorganisms. Additionally, the utilization of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) as an exogenous redox mediator (from selenite to selenide) can expedite the reduction. Reports suggest that the selenide yield can be increased in the presence of AQDS and the absence of reducing agent even up to five-fold, because of the linking between the bio-resource of QDs and living organisms present in selenium-polluted wastewater.175
Several bacteria have been explored for synthesizing MeSe QDs under mild conditions. For instance, Abou-Assy et al.176 synthesized cubic cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs (∼2–4 nm) using Providencia vermicola BGRW at 37 °C within 24 h (pH = 9). P. vermicola BGRW can resist many metals such as bismuth, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc. Yan et al.177 utilized the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens bacterium for the preparation of CdSe QDs at 30 °C in pH 7.4, which resulted in QDs with a uniform shape and an average size of 3.57 ± 0.31 nm. Additionally, Lin et al.178 prepared CdSe QDs with a size of 3.71 ± 0.04 nm using Bacillus licheniformis in a 37 °C incubator for 18 h. The distribution of amino and carboxyl groups with a positive and negative charge on the surface of the thick cell walls of this bacterium permitted the cells to adsorb heavy metals,179 which makes it an ideal potential biological matrix for the biosynthesis of QDs.
The biosynthesis of CdSe QDs was reported by applying Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida glabrata yeasts.180,181 Shao et al.182 explained the mechanism of CdSe QD biosynthesis using S. cerevisiae yeast. Selenium, like sulfur, shared the same metabolic pathway, and therefore the overexpression of the genes stimulated the conversion of selenomethionine to selenocysteine; the addition of CdCl2 resulted in the formation of intracellular glutathione in yeast cells to detoxify Cd2+. Finally, the Se precursor (selenocysteine) interacted with the Cd precursor to form CdSe QDs. In another study, Brooks and Lefebvre183 treated yeast S. cerevisiae with CdSe QDs in the cytoplasm. The utilization of sodium selenite and cadmium chloride was useful, and the authors explored the need for glutathione in the biosynthesis mechanism since they reported the intracellular reduction as a result of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and buthionine sulfoximine addition for cellular interaction. They found that these reagents remarkably inhibited the biosynthesis of CdSe QDs when applied after selenite treatment and before adding cadmium, demonstrating that glutathione may contribute to the biosynthesis process.
Sur et al.184 biosynthesized CdSe QDs using S. cerevisiae; the concentration of the generated tryptone glucose yeast extract could significantly affect the yield of the synthesis, which reached its optimum at 25 g L−1. Tryptone contains amino acids with a negative charge attracted by the Cd ions with a positive charge and this resulted in CdSe nucleation; higher concentrations of tryptone probably can interact with the metabolic pathway and reduce the production of QDs. Additionally, Cao et al.185 performed aerobic biosynthesis of CdSe QDs by the aid of a yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and conditioned cells in the vicinity of Na2SeO3 or CdCl2, in separate experiments; the whole-mount cells imaged on microscope vividly reflected the population of grains connecting to the cells (Fig. 5a). The longshot scans witnessed the presence of aggregates within and outside of the cells (Fig. 5b). Additionally, the obvious signals could be detected from Cd and Se elements inside the particles (Fig. 5c). The microtomed samples were detected meticulously by the combination of TEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses to visualize the fingerprint of aggregates in- and/or outside the cells (Fig. 5d); this was inferred from extracellular polysaccharides as well as the capsule of the cells. Further purification and precise observation by a high-resolution (HR)-TEM suggested a lattice spacing of 0.23 nm for the QDs (Fig. 5e), possessing 3.2 ± 0.4 nm as regular diameter of the cleansed QDs (Fig. 5f).185

TEM micrographs serve to directly observe and quantify the cells once CdSe is synthesized (a and b). Ultrathin microtomed cross-sectional surfaces are also analyzed using TEM (c) and EDS (d). HR-TEM micrographs are also provided from the purified samples (e) and particle size distribution is determined (f). Reproduced with permission from ref. 185. 


2.6.3. Biosynthesis of metal telluride (MeTe) QDs. 
Tellurium (Te) is an important element as a positive semiconductor; Te oxyanions including tellurate (Te(VI)) or tellurite (Te(IV)) can be biotransformed to insoluble elemental tellurium (Te(0)) or telluride (Te(−II)) by microorganisms.186 Inside cells using membrane-bound nitrate reductase and thioredoxin (Trx)–glutathione (GSH), Te(IV) can be detoxified through a reduction procedure to the elemental Te(0) precipitates.187 The bioreduction of Te can be helpful in the bioremediation of wastewaters and soils from Te pollutant; additionally, it can be useful for the formation of metal telluride (MeTe) to remove heavy metals. The formation of MeTe QDs (especially CdTe QDs) was reported by applying different bacterial and fungal cultures. Akbari et al.188 reviewed the biosynthesis of CdTe QDs using herbal species and microorganisms; CdTe QDs can be prepared intra- and extracellularly through a biomimetic method based on feeding organisms with cadmium and telluride precursors.
Bao et al.105 reported the biogenic synthesis of CdTe QDs using Escherichia coli bacteria in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C. The CdTe crystals were nucleated extracellularly by incubation of the Te precursor with E. coli in LB medium. E. coli-secreted proteins attached to the dissolved components of the nucleated nanocrystals and accelerated the dissolution of small nanocrystals, causing the growth of CdTe QDs (∼2.6 nm ± 0.6) (Fig. 6a and b). The proportion of nanocrystalline zones in the cubic CdTe having a d-spacing of 0.32 nm was also promising. This observation was further confirmed based on XRD analysis (Fig. 6c), which peaked intensively at ca. 27.5 °C corresponding to a d-spacing of (1 1 1) planes, as the reference pattern.105 The advantages of the microbially synthesized QDs over mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA)-capped QDs obtained via hydrothermal synthesis were also featured by the larger hydrodynamic size of the former (Fig. 6d), illustrating the successful capping process. The surface modification of CdTe QDs was further confirmed by particle charge zeta potential measurements (Fig. 6e), featuring a higher value for the microbially synthesized QDs (ca. 1.9 times); both types of particle also signaled a negative charge in electrophoresis based on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. The strong negative surface charge of the biosynthesized QDs was responsible for the acceptable stability and solubility of the nanocrystal suspension; hence, it is hoped that this will open gates to bioimaging applications. The FTIR spectrum of these QDs demonstrated distinct absorption peaks at 1668 and 1545 cm−1, respectively ascribed to bending vibrations of amides type I and II in proteins (Fig. 6f).105
 Fig. 6  TEM (a) and HRTEM (b) micrographs of CdTe QDs synthesized extracellularly. The close-ups of the size distribution pattern and crystalline zone of the developed structure are available at the top and bottom of part (b), respectively. Moreover, circles in the HR-TEM image show lattice planes with crystalline d-spacing of 0.32 nm, which are of the order of that of the (1 1 1) plane in the cubic zinc blende structure of the bulk CdTe crystals. XRD scans are provided from the synthesized QDs (c), and profiles of hydrodynamic size (d), ζ potential (e) and FTIR spectra of hydrothermal and extracellularly biosynthesized CdTe QDs (f) are also compared. Reproduced with permission from ref. 105. 
Plaza et al.189 reported the successful synthesis of fluorescent QDs by highly cadmium- and tellurite-resistant bacteria (Pseudomonas, Psychrobacter and Shewanella) isolated from Antarctica in LB medium at 28 °C in the presence of CdCl2 and K2TeO3. Additionally, Syed et al.57 reported the extracellular preparation of CdTe QDs with intensive fluorescence behavior from Fusarium oxysporum in a low-concentration solution of Te and Cd through a single-step bottom-up method; the secreted proteins from the fungi capped the prepared nanocrystals and stabilized their dispersibility. It was found that the band gap of the QDs was 2.61 eV and their fluorescence emission band was at 475 nm. Bao et al.190 biosynthesized CdTe QDs using S. cerevisiae cells. The ensuing CdTe QDs were identified with a particle size in the range of 2.0–3.6 nm, finely dispersed in both the cytoplasm and the yeast cells’ nuclei.


2.6.4. Biosynthesis of metal sulfides (MeS) QDs. 
Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are found in nature with different ranges of carbon/nitrogen and carbon/sulfur as well as nitrogen/sulfur ratios; however, all of them are suitable for biosynthesis procedures. Such microorganisms, anaerobic ones, which belong to anoxic habitats and normally grow from their sulfate terminals. The sulfate reduction process is similar to the ATP sulfurylase process, both of which could result in the generation of adenosine phosphosulfate (APS). This is an endergonic reaction and the catalyst of this reaction would be a pyrophosphate hydrolysis process. Generally, SRBs can rapidly reduce the sulfate moieties to sulfides, helping them to react with divalent metal ions to generate MeSs.191–193
The sulfide moieties have a higher stability compared with other types of chalcogenide compounds, and thus their QDs have rigid and static band gaps; additionally, they are usually stable in high temperatures, and at the considerable voltages of optoelectronic devices, and are also suitable for transform energy. These properties make these MeS QDs suitable candidates for a wide range of applications including photocatalytic processes. Different types of organism were explored for the synthesis of different QDs with unique properties (Table 4).194,195

2.6.5. Mechanism of biological synthesis methods. 
Using different types of microorganism leads to promising results, which prompted scientists to study their mechanisms. In this context, by studying the in situ synthesis of metal chalcogenides (MeCh) in the presence of microorganisms, it was illustrated that these MeCh were localized in the periplasm, cytoplasm and also in the extracellular medium.226 Therefore, the formation of MeCh in the cytoplasm of microorganisms can be possible.227 Furthermore, due to the small size of these QDs and MeCh, these nanoparticles are able to transport physically from their synthesizing medium inside the cellular membrane to outside the membrane (extracellular medium). Some research groups reported the transportation of the nanoparticles from intracellular to extracellular media, and found that by adding extra CdS to the E. coli cells, most of these nanoparticles could be detected outside of the cells.201,228 However, the in-situ-biosynthesized CdS could penetrate easily to the cellular membranes, and it was revealed that the synthesis medium could modify the surface of nanoparticles with different types of functional groups that help them to penetrate inside the cells.202,219
The size and morphology of the produced nanoparticles could be controlled by adjusting the temperature, pH, light, and other physical parameters and reaction conditions. For instance, the synthesis of CdS QDs using Brevibacterium casei was illustrated. At pH 9 a smaller size of these QDs was generated, and by changing the pH, their size may differ significantly.199,229 The associated mechanism of this phenomenon could be due to the higher precipitation rate in the higher pH, causing the fast nucleation process. Notably, the intracellular pH is slightly different from the extracellular pH, and this difference in pH in particle size and morphology has not yet been studied. Another fact regarding this phenomenon is that the effect of the pH of the medium on the physical properties of these QDs would be because of the balance between the crystal growth and nucleation rates; these parameters are varied in different microorganisms. Other investigations were proposed wherein, by changing the incubation time, the size of these QDs can be changed significantly. For instance, by increasing the incubation time from 10 to 40 h for the yeast cells in the presence of CdCl2, the size of the synthesized CdSe QDs increased from 2.6 to 6.4 nm,230 which resulted in a dramatic difference from altering a physical parameter. From another perspective, if this incubation time increased up to 5 days, the mean particle diameter increased substantially, along with a broadening of the particle size distribution.210

2.7. Other miscellaneous methods
Due to the inimitable structure and excellent properties of QDs, more synthesis methods have been reported such as the photoreduction method, pyrolysis, laser ablation technique, and electrochemical method. In the photoreduction method, semiconducting particles generate electron and hole pairs under photoirradiation in aqueous solution. The generated photoelectrons and holes cause an oxidation–reduction reaction on the surface of the semiconductor particles. The semiconductor particles adsorb metal ions from aqueous or alcoholic solution, which undergo a reduction reaction to metallic species by accepting electrons. Wang et al.231 synthesized GQD–Ag photocatalysts by a green photoreduction strategy from a water solution. A GQD solution was utilized as a green solvent and dispersant; AgNO3 solution was introduced to the GQD solution under UV illumination to transfer Ag+ to the Ag particles.
Among the other synthesis methods, thermal decomposition or pyrolysis is a single-stage, straightforward, time saving, high yield, large-scalable and cost-effective approach.232 Rahimi et al.233 synthesized GQDs by a facile, cost-effective, and large-scalable pyrolysis method involving citric acid for 30 min at 200 °C. Additionally, Gu et al.234 deployed a pyrolysis method to carbonize a solid mixture of citric acid and urea to GQDs under infrared irradiation at a temperature of 200 °C within 20 min. Atienzar et al.235 pyrolyzed natural widely available alginate biopolymer at 900 °C under an inert atmosphere to form multilayer GQDs.
Highly pure QDs can be obtained by using lasers, which facilitate the ablation of bulk materials. Russo et al.236 employed femtosecond laser ablation for the synthesis of GQDs with dimensions of about 2–5 nm from highly oriented pyrolytic graphite with laser energies between 20–30 J cm−2. Besides, Kang et al.237 developed environmentally friendly pulsed laser ablation in a liquid method for synthesizing GQDs from Earth-abundant and low-cost coal. The schematic possible mechanism of formation of GOQDs from coal by pulsed laser ablation is shown in Fig. 7. During the laser-pulse injections Coulomb explosions occurred at the surface of the coal. Next, a plasma plume with a high temperature and pressure formed surrounding the solid because of multiphoton absorption ionization. As the plasma mass expanded and cooled, a cavitation bubble was produced in the solution. Then, the carbon clusters which are separated from the solid with high surface energy tended to aggregate and formed layered graphene sheets. Intartaglia et al.238 bio-conjugated silicon QDs in a single-stranded oligonucleotide biomolecule solution using a femtosecond laser system.

The electrochemical method is another synthesis method for the preparation of QDs. Tian et al.239 electrochemically synthesized N-doped GQDs via a bottom-up approach. With the aid of this method it is possible to endow the process with a high yield (as high as 95%) without the formation of any by-products. O-Phenylenediamine was utilized in the absence of chemicals, with highly purified platinum sheets as anode and cathode under a constant voltage of 500 V for more than 1 h at 25 °C. In another study, CQDs were synthesized via an electrochemical method using graphite rods as the anode and counter-electrode in aqueous NaOH as the electrolyte with direct current at static potentials of 15–60 V which were applied to the electrodes.240 The obtained CQDs with an average size of 4.5 nm and a yield of about 16.5% were water soluble and highly luminescent. Then, the CQDs were combined with TiO2 to produce a visible-light photocatalyst. Fig. 8a exhibits the electrochemical synthesis method of CQDs.240 The zeta potential of the prepared CQDs confirmed the electrostatic dispersion stability. They showed that the CQDs were well dispersed with particle sizes of 3–6 nm (Fig. 8d). The TEM image of the CQDs also revealed diameters of about 4.5 nm for the CQDs (Fig. 8e). In addition, Fig. 8f exhibits a crystal lattice spacing of about 0.321 nm, which confirmed (002) lattice planes of graphitic carbon.240

3. Environmental applications of QDs as photocatalysts
QDs can play important roles in different photocatalytic applications such as hydrogen production, decomposition of pollutants and CO2 reduction.
3.1. Photocatalytic hydrogen production
In recent decades, it was found that hydrogen can be a source of clean energy which leads human society towards sustainability. Hydrogen as a clean fuel, an alternative for petroleum-based energy, is easily stored in gas cylinders; H2 is an eco-friendly gas in comparison with exhaust fossil-based fuel gases. Moreover, its energy content is about 3 times higher than that of gasoline.166 Hydrogen is utilized in diverse fields including power generation, production of chemicals, as a reducing agent in chemical reactions, as an antioxidant, and as fuel for automobiles and rockets.241 The commercial steam refining process is the main source of hydrogen production from the chemical industry, which is very expensive and requires high heat energy to operate. Particularly, the production of photocatalytic hydrogen with the aid of solar light is an easy and green approach to achieve mass hydrogen production in the future. The preparation of QDs has started a revolution for photocatalytic hydrogen production. For instance, Sargin et al.161 synthesized CQDs by microwave irradiation from Agaricus bisporus, which is an edible mushroom, and examined them as a TiO2 sensitizer in photocatalytic hydrogen production. A UV420-Vis irradiation-assisted hydrogen evolution reaction of TiO2/CQD photocatalyst with and without a Pt co-catalyst ended in hydrogen amounts of 1458 and 472 μmol g−1 after 2 h, respectively. Simultaneous valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) excitation is a measure of photon absorption, required for H2 production. The sp2-conjugated CQDs have excited electrons in the valence–conduction-band bridge due to photon absorption; this is followed by donation of the photo-generated electrons towards the conduction band of TiO2, resulting in the photocatalytic production of H2. The catalyst CQDs/TiO2/Pt can also be reused without reduction in its activity. Genc et al.242 reported the MW-assisted synthesis of CQDs using Gingko biloba to obtain a photosensitizer for TiO2 photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The utilization of Pt as a co-catalyst could improve the hydrogen evolution rate from 665 μmol h−1 g−1 for CQDs/TiO2 to 1502 μmol h−1 g−1 for the CQDs/TiO2/Pt composite. Additionally, Gogoi et al.243 chemically developed orange-peel-derived CQDs deposited on cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanowires to drive a UV-vis-aided water-splitting reaction. By exploring the effect of the mass fraction of CQD in CdS, the optimal catalyst was found for the 0.4CQD/CdS sample (quantum yield of 32.6%), exhibiting a hydrogen production rate of 309 mmol g−1 h−1 that was 50% higher with respect to bare CdS. Before oxidizing the CdS, the sacrificial reagents (S2− and SO32−) decreased the photocorrosion by inhibiting photo-generated holes. The presence of sulfur vacancies along with the formation of cadmium oxide as an excellent charge transfer and separator were possible reasons for the outstanding photocatalytic performance of CQD/CdS (Fig. 9).

Extensive CO2 emissions can cause a lot of environmental challenges such as the greenhouse effect, which contributes to global warming. The reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed that the CO2 concentration has exceeded the safe limit (below 350 ppm),244 which has forced researchers to look for solutions to this problem.245 The conversion of CO2 to sustainable energy resources such as methane and carbon monoxide by photocatalytic reduction can not only diminish the greenhouse effect by the CO2 transmission but also reduce the energy crisis.246,247 The utilization of semiconductor QDs as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction has some advantages such as activation under boundless solar energy and operation at ambient temperature and pressure.248–250 For instance, Kulandaivalu et al.251 synthesized blue-fluorescent CQDs through a top-down hydrothermal method for 1 h at 250 °C using empty fruit bunch biochar as the carbon source. Then, a CQDs/Cu2O nanocomposite was prepared by the incorporation of the prepared CQDs into copper(I) oxide nanoparticles. It was indicated that the CQDs/Cu2O nanocomposite improved the photoreduction of CO2 by about 54% compared with pure Cu2O. The photoreduction of CO2 was initiated by photoexcitation of Cu2O under visible light and generation of e− at the CB and h+ at the VB. The redox potential of pure Cu2O was between the VB (EVB = −1.0 V) and the CB (ECB = +1.1 V), which makes it capable of reducing CO2 to C2H6 (E° = −0.27 V). The e− at the CB participated in the photoreduction of CO2 to ˙CO2− radicals, and the h+ at the VB of Cu2O reacted with H2O to form ˙OH and H+ which further oxidized to O2 and H+. The H+ ions subsequently reacted with e− to form ˙H radicals. From the reaction of the ˙H and ˙CO2− radicals, ˙CH3 was formed on the surface of the Cu2O. Finally, the dimerization of two ˙CH3 generated C2H6. However, because of the high recombination rate of the charge carriers, most of the photogenerated e− recombined with h+ in the VB of Cu2O, and only a portion of the electrons and holes could participate in the photocatalytic reaction. In the case of the CQDs/Cu2O nanocomposite, photogenerated carriers of charge were taken out by CQDs to move the photoreduction reaction forward. Therefore, the same as for the photocatalytic mechanism of Cu2O, for CQDs/Cu2O all the reactions occurred on the surface of the Cu2O, except for the photoreduction of CO2, which occurred on the surface of the CQDs. Additionally, the prepared CQDs/Cu2O nanocomposite showed photostability preservation up to ∼90% even after five times of photoreaction.251
In recent decades, many efforts have been made to prepare an optimized solar-driven evolution of hydrogen based on different semiconductors. In this case, QDs have been utilized widely due to their suitable band gap as well as their performance in solar cells. QD-based photocatalytic systems have better dispersibility, H2O solubility, and stability; thus, they are better to apply for H2 evolution systems. The QD-based hydrogen evolution photonanosystems showed significantly high turnover number (TON) compared with the other types of semiconductor, and also showed acceptable quantum yields, which makes them suitable candidates for solar-driven cells.252–255 A list of breakthrough studies in this field with complete information about the QDs, co-catalysts, types of electron donor chemical and also their TON and quantum yield results is illustrated in Table 5. Also, recent advancements in QD photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 evolution photonanosystems are presented in Table 6.

3.2. Photocatalytic degradation of pollutants
Industries release significant amounts of organic waste into the environment without special treatment. These organic wastes can be gene-toxic, mutagenic, and cytotoxic,279 which is forcing researchers to develop various methods for overcoming this problem. The rate of degradation of organic wastes (e.g., dyes) is affected by different parameters such as concentration, pH and light intensity. Semiconductor heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions are promising routes for the degradation of industrial dyes and other pollutants. QDs are auspicious photocatalytic materials with a limited bandgap, which enhance UV-Vis absorption. An important parameter in this method is that the redox potential of the H2O/˙OH couple (OH− = ˙OH + e−E° = −2.8 V) should be approximately equal to the bandgap of the semiconductor. Therefore, the produced reactive oxygen species can completely break down the dye molecules. Various green-synthesized QDs have been employed as nanophotocatalysts for the removal of different organic wastes and dyes, as illustrated in Table 7.

Prekodravac et al.290 prepared N-doped CQDs from glucose in water using a MW reactor for 1 min for the removal of toxic Rose Bengal organic dye under visible light irradiation. It was indicated that only a low content of the prepared CQDs could degrade the dye up to 93% in 30 min under visible light irradiation. Additionally, the pH remarkably affected the efficiency of photocatalytic performance of the CQDs. The degradation of dyes occurred at neutral and basic pH; however in acidic pH a stable conjugation between the dyes and CQDs was obtained. Begum and Ahmaruzzaman145 prepared SnO2 QDs via a MW heating method using Parkia speciosa Hassk pods extract, and utilized them as photocatalysts to decompose acid yellow 23 dye conditioned to UV254 light. An electron–hole pair was generated in SnO2 QDs under UV254 light, which could result in the migration of an electron (e−) from the VB to the CB, creating a hole (h+) in the VB. The created h+ reacted with H2O and formed ˙OH radicals, acting as a strong oxidant for the degradation of acid yellow 23 dye. The adsorbed O2 on the surface SnO2 QDs trapped the e− in the CB and produced superoxide radicals, which could react with H2O and formed ˙OH radicals, again. Therefore, according to the mentioned mechanism, the SnO2 QD catalyst with a dose of 20 mg in an aqueous solution containing 5 mg L−1 acid yellow 23 dye showed a degradation efficiency of 98% under UV254 light in 24 min. Additionally, these QDs could be reused as photocatalysts for the degradation of dyes to CO2 and H2O for up to 5 cycles without diminishing their stability and efficiency. Wang et al.291 investigated the photocatalytic activity of CdSe QD-modified TiO2 compared with TiO2 and bulk CdSe-modified TiO2 on the degradation of malachite green aqueous solution exposed to UV-Vis. The quantum size resulted in an increment of the band gap from 1.75 eV for bulk CdSe to 2.21 eV for CdSe QDs. The high rate of electron transfer from CdSe QDs to TiO2 was considerably governed by the large variance existing between the conduction band potentials of materials that could enhance the separation of charge carrier. Therefore, higher amounts of active species including O2˙−, H2O2 and ˙OH were generated within the photocatalytic reaction. Additionally, Tyagi et al.292 synthesized water-soluble CQDs (∼1–3 nm) from lemon peel waste using a hydrothermal method with a quantum yield of about 14%. Then, they immobilized the CQDs over electrospun TiO2 nanofibers for degrading methylene blue (MB) dye. The electrons which transferred to the CQDs from the TiO2 conduction band led to the formation of O2˙− through a reaction with oxygen at the photocatalyst surface, and the holes which remained in the valence band of TiO2 produced hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) through a reaction with water. The generated O2˙− and ˙OH radicals in the TiO2–CQDs degraded the MB into harmless products about 2.5 times more than the TiO2 nanofibers due to the facilitated charge separation at the interface. Ramar et al.293 developed undoped CQDs and nitrogen-doped CQDs from pomelo (Citrus maxima or Citrus grandis) juice using a hydrothermal method to conduct the degradation of MB dye exposed to solar light. The resulting precursor played the role of catalyst and light absorber, because the photo-oxidation and photosensitization mechanisms were simultaneously detected in the time span of solar irradiation of the CQDs. Bhattacharjee and Ahmaruzzaman294 prepared SnO2 QDs (∼4 nm) using a microwave heating method from serine with a bandgap of 4.5 eV. It was found that the rate of degradation of eosin Y dye using SnO2 QDs was 98% in 60 min, which was higher than commercial SnO2 (96%). Roushani et al.295 prepared GQDs by pyrolyzing citric acid for the degradation of a cationic dye (New Fuchsin, NF) under visible light irradiation. It was indicated that the maximum decolourization reached about 95.83% at a dye concentration of 6 ppm and decreased when the concentration of NF dye increased. Both photocatalytic and photosensitization degradation mechanisms could be detected in the decolourization processes. Based on the photocatalytic activity of the GQDs, e− in the VB of GQDs could be excited to the CB and e−–h+ pairs could be generated. Then, O2 on the surface of the GQDs was able to be rapidly reduced to O2˙− and ˙OOH by the photogenerated e−. Additionally, the h+ of VB could directly oxidize NF dyes attached to the outermost layer of the GQDs or induce the mineralization of NF dyes by the aid of ˙OH produced by the reaction between h+ and H2O or chemisorbed OH− (Fig. 10a). Besides, self-photosensitization for photodegradation of the NF dyes in the presence of GQDs occurred under visible light irradiation as shown in Fig. 10b. The NF dyes could be adsorbed on the large surface area of the GQDs. Then, irradiation with visible light caused photogenerated e− to be transferred from the excited state of the adsorbed dye to the CB of the GQDs, which induced active species including O2˙−, ˙OOH and ˙OH to react with NF+ and dissociated it.

4. Conclusion and future outlook
The greener-synthesized QDs are relatively non-toxic, low-cost, and water-soluble with suitable physicochemical and photochemical stability. This review gives a global view about the greener and sustainable synthesis of carbon-, graphene-, and metal-based QDs using diverse natural and renewable resources, as well as their photocatalysis applications, including photocatalytic hydrogen production, degradation of pollutants and reduction of CO2. The importance and unique properties of these QDs were also highlighted to identify their high photocatalytic performances for future applications. Despite all the efforts made by researchers in this field, we believe that still some important challenges are lingering, including an insufficient level of control over the shape, microstructure, size, size distribution, surface, and bulk elemental composition. Bottom-up methods can result in the production of QDs with a considerable size distribution, which is not appropriate for photocatalytic applications. By contrast, top-down approaches can enable the generation of size-controlled QDs; obviously, under the harsh reaction conditions (high temperature and/or pressure), the yields of these approaches are low for practical applications.
Future research should rely on the development of a greener, eco-friendly, and low-cost synthesis of QDs over a wide range of temperature/pressure for developing structures with a narrow size distribution and high photocatalytic performances. It could also be a particular matter of interest to chemically combine QDs with various semiconductors for improving the interfacial charge carrier transfer. Additionally, there is an increasing need for QD-based composites for hydrogen production, water purification and CO2 photoreduction, emergent and sustainable areas of research. The utilization of plant extracts as surface modifiers can be a great option; this is because there are different functional groups in these plant extracts, and they have the ability to be placed on QDs via complete physical interactions along with hydrogen bonding, as well as van der Waals interactions. This approach can reduce the deployment of N1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) chemistry, as well as chemistry involving glycidyl methacrylate (GMA)-based compounds and modifiers. The ensuing by-products from EDC/NHS and GMA chemistry can lead to considerable cytotoxicity; therefore, replacing them with organic, cost-effective and fully biocompatible natural components would be a suitable sustainable alternative. From another perspective, the possible relationship between the precursors and the final products should be investigated before any synthesis methods by designing experiments. In this regard, by using the greener synthesis methods for the QDs, the relative cell viability of the final product increases considerably, which leads to more bioactive QDs. Also, the application of these QDs would not be limited to the general parameters; but they are fully dependent on the synthesis methods, which are based on using different kinds of reducing agents, capping agents as well as stabilizing agents. All of these components could be replaced with more environmentally-friendly and green components, which enables new features in the synthesized QDs.

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic illustration of cyanobacteria-derived CQDs and (b) possible synthesis route of the CQDs from cyanobacteria. Reproduced with permission from ref. 173.	 

 	Fig. 5  Microstructural and surface compositional analyses conducted on CdSe QDs obtained from by R. mucilaginosa PA-1 with 0.6 mM CdCl2 and 0.1 mM Na2SeO3. TEM micrographs serve to directly observe and quantify the cells once CdSe is synthesized (a and b). Ultrathin microtomed cross-sectional surfaces are also analyzed using TEM (c) and EDS (d). HR-TEM micrographs are also provided from the purified samples (e) and particle size distribution is determined (f). Reproduced with permission from ref. 185.	 

 	Fig. 6  TEM (a) and HRTEM (b) micrographs of CdTe QDs synthesized extracellularly. The close-ups of the size distribution pattern and crystalline zone of the developed structure are available at the top and bottom of part (b), respectively. Moreover, circles in the HR-TEM image show lattice planes with crystalline d-spacing of 0.32 nm, which are of the order of that of the (1 1 1) plane in the cubic zinc blende structure of the bulk CdTe crystals. XRD scans are provided from the synthesized QDs (c), and profiles of hydrodynamic size (d), ζ potential (e) and FTIR spectra of hydrothermal and extracellularly biosynthesized CdTe QDs (f) are also compared.
