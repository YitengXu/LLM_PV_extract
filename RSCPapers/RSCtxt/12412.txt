, Accepted 21st September 2016First published on 22nd September 2016AbstractTwo simple biphenyl or carbazole derivatives with four di(anisyl)amino substituents were synthesized and used as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry perovskite solar cells. The best power conversion efficiencies of 13.6% and 11.5% were achieved, respectively. The simple structures, easy synthesis, and good photovoltaic performances of these HTMs make them promising for practical applications.
Over the past few years, much advance has been made in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 20% has now been achieved.1–5 A typical PSC is composed of an electron-transporting layer (typically a mesoporous TiO2 layer), a light-harvesting perovskite layer, a hole-transporting layer, and two electrodes. The importance of the hole-transporting material (HTM) is not limited to the charge-transport dynamics, but also plays a significant role in stabilizing the perovskite layer and thus affecting the long-term performance.6–8
To date, several classes of efficient HTMs have been developed for PSCs, including inorganic HTMs,9–11 polymeric HTMs12–14 and small molecular HTMs.15–18 Inorganic HTMs (e.g., CuI, CuSCN and NiO) have attracted much attention due to their high mobility, low price, and good chemical stability.9–11 Polymeric HTMs, including poly(TPD), PCPDTBT, PTAA, and P3HT etc., have been applied in PSCs, which showed PCEs in the range of 4.2–20%.12–14 In comparison, more attention has been focused on small molecule HTMs due to their high purity, easy availability, easy structural modification, and high PCEs achieved. Recently, impressive photovoltaic performance has been achieved using small molecular HTMs including 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9-9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and other multi-triarylamine derivatives with pyrene, carbazole, or thiophene backbones.15–18
Spiro-OMeTAD is the classical material commonly employed as the HTM for PSCs.19 The major drawback of spiro-OMeTAD is the laborious and expensive synthetic route that requires at least four steps with low overall yields (<30%).20 The complicated synthetic and purification procedures make it inherently expensive and limit its potential application in large scale production. In this context, recent efforts in the development of new HTMs moved to compounds with very simple structures that could be prepared by one- or two-step reactions from low-cost and readily available starting materials.15–18,21–24
Herein, we present two new multiamine compounds, TDAB and TDAC as efficient HTMs for PSCs (Scheme 1). These two materials have very simple molecular structures, composed of a biphenyl or carbazole backbone with four di(anisyl)amino substituents. Devices using TDAB and TDAC afford the best power conversion efficiency of 13.6% and 11.5%, respectively. The reference HTM (spiro-OMeTAD), under the same testing conditions, displayed a power conversion efficiency of 17.8%.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to TDAB and TDAC. 
The synthesis of TDAB and TDAC only needs one step C–N cross-coupling reaction from the commercially available starting materials 3,3′,5,5′-tetrabromo-1,1′-biphenyl or 1,3,6,8-tetrabromo-9-butyl-9-H-carbazole with di(anisyl)amine (Scheme 1). These two starting materials could alternatively be readily prepared from cheap chemicals, 1,3,5-tribromobenzene or 9-butyl-9-H-carbazole in high yields.25,26 Both TDAB and TDAC have good solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobenzene, and toluene. In addition, the single-crystal X-ray structure of TDAB has been determined (Fig. 1), which shows a twisted three-dimensional structure.

HOMO levels of TDAB and TDAC were determined by electrochemical data. Multiple anodic redox waves are observed in the cyclic voltammogram (CV) and differential pulsed voltammogram (DPV) of TDAB and TDAC (Fig. 2). The redox potentials (Eox) of the first oxidation peak are 0.67 and 0.45 V vs. Ag/AgCl for TDAB and TDAC, respectively. Under the same conditions, the Eox value of spiro-OMeTAD are 0.56 V. Assuming that the energy level of Ag/AgCl is 4.70 eV below the vacuum level,27 the HOMO levels of TDAB, TDAC, and spiro-OMeTAD were determined to be −5.37, −5.15, and −5.26 eV, respectively (Table 1). The HOMO level of spiro-OMeTAD has a comparable value in the literature.15 The HOMO levels of TDAB and TDAC are between the HOMO of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV) and the Fermi energy level of Au electrode (−5.10 eV), indicating that they have appropriate energy levels in mediating the hole transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to the Au electrode.28

Fig. 3 shows the absorption and fluorescence spectra of TDAB, TDAC, and spiro-OMeTAD. The absorption maximum of TDAB and TDAC are around 300 nm and some shoulder absorptions are present between 350 and 450 nm. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations show that the low-energy absorptions are dominated by intramolecular charge transfer transitions and the major absorption band in the UV region are associated with π–π* transitions (Table S2, Fig. S2 and S3†). The emission maximum of TDAB and TDAC are located at 479 nm and 489 nm, respectively. The transition energy E0–0 and frontier energy gap of TDAB and TDAC are thus determined to be 3.10 and 2.87 eV, respectively, from the intersection of the emission and absorption spectra.29 The LUMO levels of TDAB (−2.27 eV) and TDAC (−2.28 eV) are higher with respect to the conduction band edge of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.93 eV), which means that the electron transportation from CH3NH3PbI3 to the Au electrode can be effectively blocked.30,31

DFT calculations of TDAB and TDAC show that the LUMO is mainly localized on the biphenyl or carbazole core (Fig. 4). The HOMOs of two compounds are delocalized in the whole molecule including the dianisylamino groups and the biphenyl or carbazole core. The HOMO and LUMO positions of both molecules have substantial overlapping on the biphenyl and carbazole core. Such an orbital composition is expected to be beneficial for the fast formation of neutral excitons and intermolecular hole hopping processes.15i,j

The photovoltaic performance of the FTO/TiO2/FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry/HTM/Au PSCs under AM 1.5G conditions based on TDAB and TDAC were evaluated (FA stands for formamidinium cations and MA stands for methylammonium cations, see details in ESI†). Similar devices with spiro-OMeTAD as HTM were also fabricated for a comparative study. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows the formation of a well-defined hybrid structure with clear interfaces (Fig. S4†). Typical photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 5 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. By using TDAC as the HTM, the PSC show a best PCE of 11.5% with a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 16.0 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 0.97 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.74. In comparison, a better photovoltaic performance has been achieved with TDAB, which yields a PCE of 13.6% with JSC of 19.5 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.01 V and FF of 0.69, respectively. A total of fifteen devices with each HTM are measured, with an average PCE of 12.4% for the TDAB-based PSCs and 10.5% for the TDAC-based PSCs (Fig. S5†). Under the same condition, the device with spiro-OMeTAD shows a PCE of 17.8%. The top views of the SEM images of TDAB and TDAC films show that both are amorphous (Fig. S6†). The relatively low VOC of the device with TDAC is possibly caused by its relatively high HOMO level, since the VOC is largely determined by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the HOMO of the HTM.6,24

In order to further understand the charge separation and collection processes in the PSCs, time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements of TDAB and TDAC at the Al2O3/FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry/HTMs interfaces were carried out (Fig. 6). The use of the low-conducting Al2O3 layer is to avoid the electron dissipation through the high-conducting TiO2 and FTO layers. The Al2O3/FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry film without any HTM exhibits a lifetime of 1.013 μs. The introduction of the HTM as a quenching layer remarkably facilitated the photoluminescence decay, which is due to the diffusion of the photo-generated excitons to the FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry/HTM interface where they are quenched. It is thus suggested that the existence of the FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry/HTM interface is beneficial to the hole transfer. Generally speaking, by using the same device fabrication method, the quenching dynamics of the perovskite emission implies the hole extraction capability of HTMs.32–35 The faster the photo-induced holes in the perovskite film are transferred to the HTM layer, the shorter the emission time is. The photoluminescence decay of the Al2O3/FAxMA1−xPbI3−yBry/HTMs interfaces can be fitted with a bi-exponential decay function (Table S3†). The average decay lifetime of the interface with spiro-OMeTAD, TDAB and TDAC is 22.1, 26.41, and 32.03 ns, respectively. In comparison, the longest quenching lifetime is observed for the film with TDAC, indicating its poorer hole extraction capacity with respect to other two HTMs. This is possibly one reason for explaining the lower short-circuit photocurrent and fill factor when TDAC was used as the HTM in the above device measurement.

In order to gain insights into the carrier recombination dynamics of the PSCs with different HTMs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis of the device with TDAB or TDAC in the dark at different forward biases were performed. Fig. 7(a) presents Nyquist plots of the devices with TDAB or TDAC with a potential bias of 900 mV in the dark. Nyquist plots of the device with TDAB under different forward biases are also given in the inset of Fig. 7(a). An equivalent circuit is employed to fit the Nyquist plot (Fig. 7(b)). Generally, the high frequency response of the arc plot is associated with the Au/HTM interface. Meanwhile, the low-frequency response is mainly related to the recombination of the electrons from the mesoporous TiO2 layer with the holes from the HTM layer.36,37 According to the simplified transmission line model, the main arc is supposed to be caused by the recombination resistance (Rct) and the chemical capacitance of the film. By fitting the Nyquist plots, the relationship between the Rct and the bias voltage could be obtained.35,38 The Rct value of the TDAB-based PSC is higher than that of the TDAC-based PSC in the applied bias voltage range, indicating that the interface with TDAC has a more serious recombination issue.

Conclusions
In summary, we present two efficient HTMs for PSCs in this work. These two compounds have very simple chemical structures and could be prepared via one-step reaction from commercially available starting materials. PSCs with these two HTMs show good photovoltaic performance. In particular, a power conversion efficiency of 13.6% under AM 1.5G solar illumination has been achieved for the HTM with a biphenyl core. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals that TDAB with a biphenyl core has a better hole extraction capacity with respect to TDAC with a carbazole core. In addition, the PSC device with TDAB has a slower charge recombination dynamics that that with TDAC. These features make TDAB a promising HTM for efficient PSCs.
