    , Accepted 16th July 2011First published on 6th September 2011AbstractTrack-etched polycarbonate (PC) membranes were used as a soft template to synthesize mesoporous TiO2 for use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The Ti precursor infiltrated into the cylindrical confined spaces of PC membranes. Upon calcination at 500 °C, TiO2 nanowires (15TNW) were obtained from PC with a 15 nm pore diameter, whereas TiO2 nanotubes (50TNT and 100TNT) were generated from PC with 50 and 100 nm diameter pores, respectively. TNW and TNT were used as photoelectrodes in DSSCs employing a polymer electrolyte. The ranking of the cell efficiencies of the 200 nm thick TiO2 films was 50TNT (1.1%) > 15TNW (0.8%) ≅ 100TNT (0.7%), which was mostly attributed to different amounts of dye adsorption due to different surface areas. These TNW and TNT films were further coated with the graft copolymer-directed mesoporous TiO2 and were used as interfacial layers between the FTO glass and the 4 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 film. As a result, the order of energy conversion efficiency was 15TNW (5.0%) ≅ 50TNT (4.8%) > 100TNT (4.1%). The improved performance of 15TNW was due to a higher transmittance through the electrode and a longer electron lifetime for recombination. The DSSC performance was systematically investigated in terms of interfacial resistance and charge recombination using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
1. Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received significant attention since their inception by O'Regan and Gratzel in 1991 as a means to address global warming and the demand for cost-effective sources of renewable energy. DSSCs are of great interest as a cost-effective alternative to conventional silicon-based photovoltaics1,2 and consist of a sensitizing dye, a transparent conducting oxide (TCO), a nanocrystalline titanium oxide (TiO2) porous film, an electrolyte containing an I−/I3−redox couple and a platinum-coated counter electrode. The preparation of nanostructured TiO2 photoelectrodes3–6 and the control of electrode/electrolyte interface7–10 are of pivotal importance for improving the efficiencies of DSSC.
The advantage of the nanoparticulate TiO2 porous film is the large surface area for dye adsorption; however, the trap-limited diffusion of electron transport often limits the efficiency. To improve the efficiency of charge collection by promoting rapid electron transport and slow charge recombination, nanostructured TiO2 including nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires, nanosheets and hollow fibers can be used as alternative photoelectrodes.11–23 Such nanostructured materials have been synthesized via chemical or physical methods including hydrothermal reaction,17–19electrospinning,20 anodic oxidation of titanium plates,21,22 and the natural cellulose fiber template method.23
Another common and effective method for preparing nanostructures is a template-based synthesis technique. In this method, a porous template, such as block copolymer, track-etched polycarbonate (PC) or anodic alumina, is used as a template for growing the desired materials.24–30 When the pores of the template are filled with the target material, a nanostructure can be easily generated, and its size can be controlled based on the template pore sizes. Uniform pores in the template provide a high yield of uniform nanostructures. This technique has been widely used to prepare numerous materials, including metal or inorganic nanostructures27,28 and polymer nanorods.30 However, there has been no report on DSSC applications of such nanostructured materials using a PC membrane template. In this work, TiO2 nanowires (TNW) and nanotubes (TNT) with different sizes were synthesized via a template-based synthesis technique using a track-etched PC membrane for DSSC applications. Fabricated TNW and TNT thin films were used as photoelectrodes and interfacial layers in the DSSCs, and the influence of the material structure on the photovoltaic performance was systematically investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials

Polycarbonate (PC, diameter = 15, 50 and 100 nm) membranes were purchased from Whatman Co. Titanium n-butoxide (TNB), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, 97%), hydrogen chloride solution (HCl, 37 wt%), acetylacetone, fumed silica nanoparticles (SiO2, 14 nm), poly(ethylene glycol dimethyl ether) (PEGDME, Mn = 500 g mol−1) and iodine (I2) were purchased from Aldrich. 1-Methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (MPII, C7H13N2I) and ruthenium dye (535-bisTBA, N719) were purchased from Solaronix. Ethanol and n-butanol were obtained from J.T. Baker. All solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade and were used as received.
2.2 Preparation of TiO2 nanowires (TNW) and nanotubes (TNT)

          TNW and TNT were prepared directly on a transparent SnO2/F-layered, conductive glass (FTO, Pilkington Co. Ltd., 8 Ω cm−2). First, 4.41 g of acetylacetone (0.044 mol) was added to 30 ml of butanol, followed by the slow addition of 5 g of TNB (0.0147 mol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min, after which a yellow color change was observed. Hydrolysis of the mixture was performed through the drop-wise addition of 0.284 g of an aqueous acidic solution (HCl, 37 wt%) and 2.471 g of H2O. The solution was then heated overnight at 60 °C, producing transparent sols that remained stable for several months. The TNB solution was diluted with 130 ml of butanol. Separately, TTIP solution was prepared through the slow addition of 1.5 g of HCl (37 wt%), 1.5 g of H2O and 3 g of TTIP under vigorous stirring. The solution was aged via stirring at ambient temperature for 1 h and then diluted with 100 ml of ethanol. TNB and TTIP solutions were mixed at a 1:1 volumetric ratio. The PC membranes were immersed in the TNB/TTIP solution for 30 min and then placed on an FTO glass and dried for 24 hours. Finally, the samples were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h and cooled to room temperature.
2.3 Fabrication of DSSCs
DSSCs with an active area of 0.4 cm2 were prepared via drop-casting of the electrolyte solution onto the photoelectrode and covering with the counter electrode according to our previously reported procedure.31–33 First, the clean conducting surface of the FTO glass was blocked with a layer of titanium(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato)diisopropoxide using spin coating, followed by heating at 450 °C for 30 min. The TNW- and TNT-covered FTO glasses were directly used as either photoelectrodes or interfacial layers. For the interfacial layer, the graft copolymer directed sol–gel solution32 was first coated onto the TNW- and TNT-covered FTO glasses, followed by casting of commercialized TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide D20, Solaronix) using a doctor-blade technique and successive sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. The photoelectrodes were immersed into a solution of ruthenium dye (Ruthenium 35-bisTBA, Solaronix SA as referred to N-719) in absolute ethanol for 2 hours at 50 °C. Quasi-solid state polymer electrolyte solutions consisting of PEGDME, SiO2, MPII and I2 dissolved in THF were dropped on the dye-absorbed TiO2 photoelectrodes. The molar ratio of ether oxygen to iodide salt was fixed at 20, and the iodine content was fixed at 10 wt% with respect to the salt. The Pt-coated counter electrodes were prepared viaspin coating of a 7 mM H2PtCl6 solution in isopropyl alcohol and calcination at 450 °C for 30 min. The cells were placed in a vacuum oven for one day to allow for complete evaporation of the solvent and were then sealed with an epoxy resin.
Photoelectrochemical performance characteristics including short-circuit current (Jsc, mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage (Voc, V), fill factor (FF), and overall energy conversion efficiency (η) were measured using a Keithley Model 2400 and a 1000 W xenon lamp (Oriel, 91193). The light was homogeneous up to an area of 8 × 8 in2, and its intensity was calibrated with a Si solar cell (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy System, Mono-Si + KG filter, Certificate No. C-ISE269) at a sunlight intensity of 1 (100 mW cm−2). This calibration was confirmed with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell (PV Measurements Inc.). The photoelectrochemical performances were calculated using the following equations: (1) (2)where Pin is the incident light power and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage in the J–V curve, respectively, at the maximum power output.
2.4 Characterization
The morphologies of the TNW or TNT films were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, SUPRA 55VP, Germany, Carl Zeiss). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a Rigaku RINT2000 wide-angle goniometer with a Cu cathode operated at 40 kV and 300 mA. The amount of the adsorbed dye was determined by desorbing the dye from the titania surface into a mixed solution of 0.01 M NaOH and ethanol (in a 1:1 volume ratio) and then measuring the absorbance. The concentration of the absorbed dye was analyzed using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) in the range of 200 to 1100 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation of TNW and TNT and their DSSC performances
The schematic diagram for the formation of TNW and TNT using track-etched PC membranes as templates is illustrated in Scheme 1. Track-etched PC membranes possess well-defined vertically aligned pores, through which a TiO2 precursor, i.e., the TNB/TTIP mixture, was infiltrated via capillary force. Fig. 1 shows the FE-SEM surface images of the resultant TNW and TNT with different diameters and lengths on PC membrane templates. The diameters of the TNW and TNT generated with PC membranes approximately matched the pore diameters of pristine PC, indicating precise control via the infiltration method. The solidly packed nanowires were generated from PC with smaller pores of 15 nm, while the hollow nanotubes were synthesized from the PC with larger pores of 50 and 100 nm. This difference was due to the incomplete filling of the TiO2 precursor into the large pores of the PC. For all three systems, the lengths of the nanowires and nanotubes were shorter than the thickness of the pristine PC membranes (6 μm for 15 and 50 nm PC, and 9 μm for 100 nm PC), implying some disruption of nanostructures during the calcination process. Interestingly, the lengths of the 15TNWs (approximately 1–2 μm) were relatively longer than those of the 50TNTs (approximately 300 nm–1 μm), even in the same thickness (6 μm) of pristine PC membranes. It indicates the higher mechanical stability of solidly packed nanowires compared to that of hollow nanotubes. The length of the 100TNT was the greatest, illustrating its applicability for facile electron transport.

The crystal structure of TNT was investigated by XRD analysis in the 2θ range of 10° to 60°, as shown in Fig. 2a. Several sharp peaks appeared, centered at 2θ = 25.5, 38.0, 48.2, 54.3, and 55.2°, corresponding, respectively, to (101), (004), (200), (105) and (211) reflections in the anatase TiO2 phase. The TNW and TNT samples were not perfectly vertical but were 200 nm in thickness parallel to the surface of the FTO glass, as can be seen in the cross-sectional FE-SEM image in Fig. 2b, and the surface profiler. The transmittances of the TNW- and TNT-coated FTO glasses were always less than that of the pristine FTO glass due to scattering effects, as shown in Fig. 2c. The 15TNW-coated FTO glass showed higher transmittance than did the 50TNT-coated FTO glass due to the smaller size of the former, and that of the 100TNT-coated FTO glass was intermediate between the other two.

The DSSCs employing a PEGDME/SiO2/MPII/I2polymer electrolyte were fabricated using 200 nm thick TNW and TNT photoelectrodes. The J–V curves measured at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 3, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. All three DSSCs exhibited identical Voc values of 0.77 V and different Jsc values, resulting in different energy conversion efficiencies. The DSSC fabricated with 50TNT showed the highest efficiency of 1.1%, due to its greatest amount of dye adsorption (4.4 nmol cm−2). However, the efficiency of the 15TNW cell was slightly greater than that of the 100TNT cell, although the amount of dye adsorption in the former was less than that in the latter due to the lower surface area of the wire structure. This difference might be due to the lower FTO/TiO2 interfacial resistance of the 15TNW cell resulting from better contact with the smaller TNW compared to that with the larger TNT. Thus, the order of the DSSC efficiencies of the 200 nm thick TiO2 films was 50TNT (1.1%) > 15TNW (0.8%) ≅ 100TNT (0.7%).

3.2 Effect of graft copolymer templated TiO2
In general, TiCl4 treatment is applied to increase the efficiency of TNW or TNT.34–36 However, TiCl4 might not be effective in connecting each TNW or TNT due to the formation of dense structures. If TNW is treated with large amounts of TiCl4, the pores might be filled with dense TiO2, which will consequently reduce the dye adsorption and reduce the conversion efficiency. In this work, graft copolymer-directed mesoporous TiO2 films were introduced to improve the interconnectivity of TNW and TNT.31,32 The PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer consists of a poly(vinyl chloride) backbone and poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) side chains, synthesized via atomic transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer was combined with TTIPvia a sol–gel process to generate mesoporous structures. The surface and cross-sectional SEM images of TNW and TNT films coated with PVC-g-POEM/TTIP and followed by calcination at 450 °C are presented in Fig. 4. Upon introduction of PVC-g-POEM/TTIP, the film thickness was slightly increased from 200 to 350 nm for all three TNW and TNT films. The surface SEM images indicate the improved interconnectivity between TNW or TNT, leading to enhanced electron transport and reduced interfacial resistance in the photoelectrode. In addition, the roughness decreased and the electrode surface became flat upon introduction of PVC-g-POEM/TTIP, which decreased the interfacial resistance of the FTO/TiO2.

The J–V curves measured at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 5 and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Upon introduction of the graft copolymer templated TiO2 film, the efficiencies of all three systems improved, mostly due to the improved Jsc values due to increased dye adsorption. However, all three DSSCs exhibited identical Voc values of 0.79 V, indicating no influence of the nanostructural TiO2 change on the Voc value. Thus, the DSSC efficiency order of the TiO2 films modified with PVC-g-POEM/TTIP sol–gel solution was s50TNT (1.6%) > s15TNW (1.4%) ≅ s100TNT (1.3%).

3.3 Performances of double layer DSSCs
DSSCs with double layer structures were fabricated using TNW and TNT as interfacial layers in order to increase the energy conversion efficiency. Nanocrystalline mesoporous particulate TiO2 (mpTiO2) films with a 4 μm thickness were deposited onto the TNW and TNT films modified with PVC-POEM/TTIP. Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves of DSSCs with such a double layer structure at 100 mW cm−2, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The DSSCs fabricated with TNW and TNT films modified with PVC-g-POEM/TTIP showed efficiencies higher than that of the DSSC with only the mpTiO2 film, indicating the effectiveness of the double layer structure in improving cell performance. The efficiency improvement is mostly due to the increases in both Voc and Jsc. Interestingly, the DSSC with an s15TNW/mpTiO2 double layer (5.0%) slightly outperformed the DSSC with an s50TNT/mpTiO2 film (4.8%), although the efficiencies of single 15TNW-based cells were always lower than those of single 50TNT-based cells (Tables 1 and 2). The efficiency of DSSC with an s15TNW/mpTiO2 double layer was approximately 1.0% greater than that with an s100TNT/mpTiO2 film, despite similar efficiencies in the single layer DSSCs. Furthermore, the DSSC with a s15TNW/mpTiO2 or s50TNT/mpTiO2 double layer exhibited higher efficiency than that with denseTiO2/mpTiO2 where titanium bis(ethyl acetoacetate) was used for the formation of a dense TiO2 film.

The efficiency of DSSC is strongly dependent on the amount of dye adsorption, which is related to the surface area and porosity of the TiO2 photoelectrode. The dye adsorptions in single TNW and TNT films were in the order of s50TNT > s15TNW > s100TNT, as shown in Table 2. However, the dye adsorptions were not greatly different among the double layer films (∼100 nmol cm−2), indicating the reduced importance of dye adsorption in the double layer structure. However, the transmittance was significantly different among the samples, as shown in Fig. 2c, with the transmittance of the 15TNW film being the highest. Thus, the improved efficiency of the s15TNW/mpTiO2-based cell was partially due to the enhanced transmittance of visible light through the FTO glass, resulting in an increase in Jsc.

Fig. 7 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs with double layer structures. The IPCE values of the DSSCs with s15TNW/mpTiO2 and s50TNT/mpTiO2 double layers were greater than that of the DSSC with only mpTiO2, indicating that nanowires or nanotubes are more efficient for electron collection. However, the DSSC with the s100TNT/mpTiO2 double layer exhibited a lower IPCE value than did that with only an mpTiO2 film, mostly due to the lower transmittance and thus the lower Jsc value of the s100TNT film.

Another possible reason for the efficiency enhancement can be explained in terms of the interfacial properties between the FTO glass and the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer. Fig. 8 shows the Nyquist plots, Bode phase plots and equivalent circuit of DSSCs with double layer structures at 100 mW cm−2. Electrochemical parameters determined from EIS analysis, i.e., resistance values (Rs, R1, R2, and R3), minimum angular frequency (ωmin) and electron recombination lifetimes (τr), are summarized in Table 4. The impedance spectra can be interpreted and modeled using equivalent circuits, with each component explained below.37,38 Each equivalent circuit consisted of several components, including ohmic resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte (R1), charge transfer resistance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte (R2), resistance at the Warburg diffusion of the redox I−/I3− couple in an electrolyte (R3), the constant phase element of capacitance corresponding to R1 (CPE1), and the constant phase element of capacitance corresponding to R2 (CPE2).

In Fig. 8a, the Nyquist spectra of the DSSCs showed three semicircles: the first semicircle, in the high-frequency region, represents R1; the second semicircle, in the middle-frequency region, represents R2; the third semicircle, in the low-frequency region, represents R3, and the curve from the origin to the first semicircle starting point on the left represents Rs. These four internal impedances have a direct effect on the electron transport mechanism in DSSCs. As a consequence, the cell performances of the DSSCs improved when the sum of the resistance components (Rs, R1, R2, and R3) was small. The total resistances of the DSSCs with a double layer structure were less than that of the DSSC with only an mpTiO2 film, indicating the importance of a double layer structure. In particular, the DSSC with an s15TNW/mpTiO2 film showed the lowest resistance, i.e., R2 of 54.7 Ω and R3 of 74.7 Ω, illustrating that the s15TNW film decreases the charge transfer resistance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte and the resistance related to Warburg diffusion of the I−/I3−redox couple in the electrolyte.
In the EIS model, the electron recombination lifetime (τr) in the TiO2 photoelectrode can be estimated from the minimum angular frequency (ωmin) value of the impedance semicircle at middle frequencies in the Bode spectrum, according to the relationship: τr = 1/ωmin, and is an average time constant before recombination. In the Bode phase plots of Fig. 8b, the characteristic frequency peak shifted to lower frequency upon introduction of TNW or TNT films, indicating that these films modified with PVC-g-POEM/TTIP increased the electron lifetime and decreased the recombination and transport resistance. In particular, the DSSC with an s15TNW/mpTiO2 film showed the highest τr value of 53.5 ms, which was more than two times greater than the value of the DSSC with only an mpTiO2 film.
4. Conclusions
Mesoporous TiO2 nanowires and nanotubes were prepared using track-etched PC membranes with different diameters. The PC membrane with 15 nm pore diameters formed a solid TiO2 nanowire structure, whereas those having 50 nm and 100 nm pores produced nanotube structures. When comparing the performance of DSSCs with 200 nm TNW and TNT, the following efficiency relationship resulted: 50TNT (1.1%) > 15TNW (0.8%) ≅ 100TNT (0.7%), which was mostly due to the different amounts of dye adsorption. For example, the 50TNW film showed the highest dye adsorption value of 4.4 nmol cm−2 and thus yielded the highest cell efficiency (1.1%). When the TNW and TNT films were additionally coated with a PVC-g-POEM/TTIP film, the cell efficiency increased for all systems; however, the order of the cell efficiencies was unchanged, i.e., s50TNT (1.6%) > s15TNW (1.4%) ≅ s100TNT (1.3%). This cell enhancement was due to improved interconnectivity between TNW or TNT, leading to enhanced electron transport and reduced interfacial resistance in the photoelectrode. Furthermore, the DSSCs with a double layer structure were fabricated with TNW or TNT films as the bottom layer and a 4 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 film as the top layer. Interestingly, the order of cell conversion efficiency in the double layer DSSCs was 15TNW (5.0%) ≅ 50TNT (4.8%) > 100TNT (4.1%), which was attributed to the higher transmittance of the 15TNW film through the electrode, the lower interfacial resistance and the longer electron recombination lifetime, as confirmed by transmittance data and EIS analysis.
