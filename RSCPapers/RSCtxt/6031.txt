Dr Faure opened the discussion of the paper by Professor Miller: In your non-LTE calculations, did you include the contribution of electron-impact excitation?

Professor Miller responded: Kokoouline et al.1 have calculated the vibrational excitation rate of H3+ by electrons at ~10−13 m3 s−1, comparable with the rate for dissociative recombination. This value is roughly two orders of magnitude greater than the vibrational excitation rate for collisions with molecular hydrogen, which Oka and Epp (2004) set to the Langevin rate of 2 × 10−15 m3 s−1. But the electron density would be 1% of the H2 density in only the most highly ionised astrophysical environments. Indeed, under conditions that would produce such high electron densities, H2 would almost certainly have been dissociated. So it is unlikely that electron impact excitation will ever be competitive with H2 excitation.
More usual upper end values of [e−]/[H2] are between 10−7 to 10−5, which would mean that electron excitation of H3+ would be less than 0.1% of the excitation by H2. Given the other simplifications in our technique for calculating non-LTE effects, it is probably not worth putting in electron impact excitation if it is not going to contribute more than (an optimistic) 0.1% of the total effect.

Dr Yelle addressed Dr Miller: Considering their importance for the cooling rate from H3+ in the non-LTE regime, would you comment on the accuracy of the VT rates used in your calculations?

Professor Miller answered: In our original contribution to Faraday Discussions volume 147, we concentrated on corrections to the H3+ partition function, and what effect they might have on calculating the total emission of this ion in various situations. Dr Yelle is perfectly correct to highlight the importance of the (ro-)vibration-translation (VT) rate for collisional excitation and de-excitation between H3+ and H2 for determining to what extent H3+ emission is in local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE), however, and therefore to what extent this ion can act as a coolant in the atmospheres of giant planets, and under what conditions. But it is far from being the only important factor. So it is worthwhile outlining the steps we take in our H3Pcool programme to calculate the total cooling due to H3+ (which has been used, mutans mutandis, in ref. 22, 29 and 35, cited in our paper).
We have used the technique proposed by Oka and Epp (ref. 36 in our original paper) to do this. This approach was originally applied to rotational transitions in H3+ in order to understand some of the spectral features observed in the interstellar medium. The Oka–Epp approach provides an elegant and symmetric way of carrying out a detailed balance calculation under conditions in which LTE no longer pertains. Central to their calculations, rather than their overall approach, is that they assume that the collisional population and depopulation of H3+ ro-vibrational states is due to the proton hopping reaction: H3+(rv = n, t = x) + H2(rv = m, t = y) → H2(rv = n′, t = x′) + H3+(rv = m′, t = y′)(1)with the obvious proviso that the energy in the various rv = RV, t = T vibration–translation states is conserved. This reaction is assumed to occur without an energy barrier at the Langevin rate of 2 × 10−15 m3 s−1. Clearly this is an assumption. In the absence of a better assumption or of detailed VT rate measurements, it is not an improbable working assumption, however. If collisional excitation and de-excitation of the relevant H3+ vibrational states is faster than this rate, the H3+ cooling efficiency per molecule is greater as the gas density decreases, and vice versa.
We now come to a second approximation to our calculations, that Oka and Epp do not have to make, since they are interested in the population of rotational sub-levels within the vibrational ground state: we assume that one can decouple the vibrational states of H3+ from the rotational sub-states. The decoupling between vibrational levels and their rotational sub-levels is not, strictly speaking, allowed, as the only good quantum numbers for H3+ are the angular momentum, J, the parity of the level, p, the nuclear spin state—ortho or para—and the level number in the J,p set. Indeed, one of the major advances in the calculation of the ro-vibrational levels of H3+ by the first-principles method was that it did not require any a priori allocation of vibrational “quantum numbers”, but instead deduced them a posteriori (ref. 27). (Note the translational states of the ion do not enter further into our calculations.)
The resulting rotation-only radiative transitions have very small Einstein Aif coefficients, since the molecule has no permanent dipole moment, compared with the ro-vibrational transitions (see ref. 33). So we can assume that the rotational sub-levels within a vibrational manifold remain in LTE. Our calculations, then, concentrate on the extent to which the vibrational level populations depart from LTE. To do this, we carry out a detailed balance calculation making use of the first 17 vibrational levels and their associated vibration-only Aif values given in ref. 26 of our original paper.
Regions of a planetary atmosphere for which H3+ cooling is in any way significant have >90% of the gas as H2; we assume that this is the only gas that takes part in collisional (de- and) excitation of H3+. The H2 gas density, N(H2) is an input to our calculation. In our calculation of level populations, we start with an LTE distribution at a given temperature, T, which is also an input to the calculation. The method of Oka and Epp enables us to calculate the rate of change of a (fractional) level population—df(v)/dt—as a function of timestep. We have found that a timestep of Δt = 10−10 × (1020/N(H2))1/2 s ensures that the calculation is not subject to numerical instability, and that 5 × 105 timesteps ensure convergence.
In Table 1 we have given the outputs for three quite typical N(H2)/T values – 1012 m−3/400 K, 1018 m−3/700 K, 1020 m−3/1600 K – that demonstrate the results we get. After printing out N(H2), T and the timestep, the programme gives five columns—the level number, df(v)/dt, the fractional population of the levels, f(v), calculated after 5 × 105 timesteps, the value of f(v) assuming LTE at the given temperature, and r(v) given by f(v)/fLTE(v). (Note that level 1 is the ground vibrational state.) It is clear the calculation is well converged. For example, if we take level 2 for the 1012 m−3/400 K calculation, df(v)/dt is just −3.12 × 10−8 which, when multiplied by Δt = 1.0 × 10−6 s, produces a change of just −3.12 × 10−14 in f(2), a mere −1.46 × 10−7 of its final value of just 2.13 × 10−6. And so on.

In Melin’s work (ref. 22, 34 and 35 of our original paper), we found it was sufficiently accurate to use r(2) to calculate the scaling required on the H3+ LTE cooling rate to account for sub-thermal populations of all the vibrational levels. This is because, for temperatures of interest for that work, almost all of the cooling came from ro-vibrational transitions in the ν2 band. At higher temperatures, however, of significance in hot(tish) Jupiters, such as that modeled by Koskinen and coworkers (ref. 29), we now take the scaling factor calculated from an LTE-weighted average of the level populations of levels 2, 4, 5 and 6 given by: R = [r(2) × fLTE(2) + r(4) × fLTE(4) + r(5) × fLTE(5) + r(6) × fLTE(6)] / [fLTE(2) + fLTE(4) + fLTE(5) + fLTE(6)](2)
In Tables 2 and 3 we give the values of r(2) and the resulting H3+ cooling, E(H3+) for various values of N(H2) and T.

Dr Sittler commented: Andrew Coates briefly touched on the subject of heavy negative ions and fullerenes. Up till now most of the discussions have been focused on the aromatics and PAHs, while fullerenes are unsaturated (no hydrogen) versions forming from long carbon chains and polycyclic rings. The fullerene subject has very exciting possibilities when it comes to pre-biological chemistry at Titan. There is an interesting synergy between Enceladus, also discussed by Andrew, which is dumping large quantities of water vapor into Saturn’s magnetosphere where it gets ionized, picked up by Saturn’s rotating magnetosphere to energies ~50–100 eV, charge transfers with the neutral water products and then gets ejected to Saturn’s outer magnetosphere as fast neutrals to Titan’s orbit. Some will leave the system while some will be on highly elliptical orbits and become ionized again, picking up with keV energies out by Titan’s orbit. The water group ions (H2O+, OH+, O+) were initially observed during Cassini’s TA encounter where they can bombard Titan’s upper atmosphere as originally reported by Hartle et al..1,2 The heavy negative ions as reported by Coates et al.3 and shown in Fig. 1 are observed above 950 km and as shown in Sittler et al.,4 could also be fullerenes which are hollow shells of 60 or 70 carbon atoms as shown in Fig. 2. Experiments have shown that noble gases colliding with fullerenes at center-of-mass energies ~100 eV can become trapped within fullerenes5–7 and same was done for nitrogen trapping within fullerenes.8,9 The keV oxygen ions can penetrate below 950 km so they can reach the fullerenes and become trapped within them (see Cravens et al.10). The fullerenes, which protect the oxygen from Titan’s reducing atmosphere (which otherwise would form CO and CO2), can then condense into larger clusters11 and/or combine with PAHs and those with nitrogen additions to form aerosols that now have oxygen trapped within them. As discussed in ref. 4 it can take 100–1000 years for these aerosols to reach the surface and during this time, including the time on surface, GCRs and their secondaries are irradiating the aerosols and it is known from laboratory measurements such irradiated mixtures can form amino acids which are the building blocks of life as we know it (Reggie Hudson, private communication). Since aerosols are globally distributed around Titan, these processes must be global on a planetary scale including the surface (veneer of tholins covering the surface). More recently, fullerenes have been identified as the carbon constituent found in carbonaceous chondritic meteorites that traps such noble gases as neon, argon, krypton and xenon.12 So, these processes must be going on.
 Fig. 1  Detection of negative ions at Titan. 
 Fig. 2  Fullerenes. 
In Table 4 we show reaction rates of interest that should be studied in the laboratory at temperature T ~ 100–200 K and pressures on the order of nanobars that may play an important role in both the formation of PAHs and long carbon chains from which fullerenes may form. The first reaction shows dissociative electron attachment which can make CN−. This ion radical and others such as C3N− and C5N− are discussed in ref. 13. Here, we note in Fig. 1, that ions C2H−, C4H− and C6H− could also apply. So, the formation of these ions, as shown in Table 4 for radiative electron attachment rates can lead to the formation of long carbon chains and thus fullerenes. We also show possible proton transfer reaction between ion CN− and HC2n+1N to make C2n+1N− ions and CN− interaction with acetylene to make C2nH− ions. Since, the electron affinity of C2H is less than CN the reaction for C2H− is not likely to be important but the others could occur. The ions C4H−, C6H− and C8H− have been detected in molecular clouds,14–17 so must be going on. The same can be said for the radiative electron attachment reactions. Finally, the last set of reactions show radical neutral–neutral collisions that can make PAHs from the aromatics phenyl and benzene and carbon chains from C2H and acetylene polymers HC2nH. Many of the reactions in ref. 13 are based on calculations and have not been measured at the temperatures of Titan’s upper atmosphere or that for molecular clouds. An example is the radiative attachment rate for C2H− is ~10−15 cm3 s−1 for Te ~1000 K, while C4H− ~10−8 cm3 s−1 or 7 orders of magnitude larger and both are based on calculations. So, we feel all these reactions should be measured, although some are more important than others. These measurements involving smaller molecules and ions are the building blocks for constructing the large polymers and will allow for more progress in this area of research. Making tholins in the laboratory is important, but it is very difficult to understand what is happening in detail due to their complexity and large number of atomic species, but by measuring the more basic reactions then one can better understand aerosol formation.

Note that O− would also act as strong base similar to CN− and would lead to fast acid–base type reactions with polyynes and cyanopolyynes, as shown above, by forming OH radicals. The measured rate coefficients using CRESU apparatus at RENNES FRANCE for the reaction of C2H with C2H2 at 150 K were >1.08 × 1010 cm3 s−1

In Fig. 3 we show the CRESU experiment at the University of Rennes which has the ability to measure many of these reactions at temperatures more characteristic of Titan’s atmosphere, although at higher pressures so corrections will be required to make estimates more applicable to Titan’s upper atmosphere. In the lower part of Fig. 3 we show the experimental setup that we would use at the Goddard Space Flight Center using an already-available facility to study high energy collisions between fullerenes and oxygen ions. To the best of our knowledge this has not yet been done. The experiments of nitrogen trapping do indicate that oxygen trapping should also occur and will also be investigated by the Goddard facility. The basic idea is that one has a calibrated O+ ion source of known energy ~400 eV which then passes through a fullerene collision chamber. This is then followed by a gated time-of-flight (TOF) section. If O+ ions strike fullerene and are trapped, the (C60 + O)+ product ion has roughly same energy as the incident O+ ion and thus TOF gives us the mass of the ion product.

Professor Mitchell asked: It is interesting to learn of the role of H3+ in cooling the atmospheres of planets. In the new ITER reactor, cooling by formation of molecular ions is essential to prevent destruction of surfaces with which the hot plasma will come into contact as in the divertor region. Recombination of the ions in the volume will avoid the recombination energy being released in the material of the surface and also molecular species can easily lose energy by radiation. Indeed heavier species are deliberately injected into divertor regions of Tokamaks in order to favor energy loss by radiation.

Professor Miller replied: This is an interesting comment. As we say in our paper, there is already a line list for H2D+ and an accompanying cooling function. It looks as if there is a case for the UCL Group putting together a line list and cooling function for T3+.

Dr Sittler responded: I agree that the formation of C2H− by radiative electron attachment is a process not likely to occur and the auto-detachment rate of C2H− is exceedingly fast from the transient complex of C2H−. Therefore the first peak of CAPS-ELS cannot be ascribed to C2H− as first indicated. But, C2H can be present. However, C4H−, C6H−, most likely would be formed. See Table 5 of Vuitton et al. in the Planet. Space Sci. paper; the negative ion/radical density ratio. The experimental values of radiative attachment rate coefficients are not yet measured. In Lavvas et al. (2008, paper I) on page 51 they discuss the importance of polyyne radicals C2H, C4H and C6H, but from reading the text clearly biased against unsaturated polymer formation and larger aerosols. They also point out that reaction rates for higher order polyyne radicals have not been measured at low temperatures. Furthermore, one does not expect radicals to accumulate since they can react very fast but rather one must compare the rates of production and loss for such radicals to determine their importance. Coming back to the measurement issue, for example Table 6, most rates are estimates or measured at high temperatures T > 300 K. Looking at Table 5 of Lavvas et al. (2008. paper I) many of the reaction rates are either estimated or measured at T > 300 K. The best solution to this debate is to measure the electron attachment reaction rates for the polymer precursors such as the ethynyl radicals C2H and CN radicals as prime examples. Finally, if molecular clouds, where polyyne radical negative ions have been observed, are analogs of Titan’s upper atmosphere then one may expect the same at Titan.

Professor Mason noted: I would like to draw to the author's attention a recent paper1 in which we operated a coronal discharge in a chemical mixture that simulated Titan's upper atmosphere (also presented in a poster at this meeting) and detected the anions produced. We only observed nitrile ions that were CN−-based; we did not see any anions that were CH based (e.g., no CnH−).
Electron-induced anion formation (at least for light anions) is most likely by the process of dissociative electron attachment, for which the database is poor, with few absolute cross sections (rate constants) being known but the most common process for a hydrocarbon containing CN (M) is the lowest of the H with resultant anion (M less H), e.g. HCCCN forms CCCN−. The cross sections will, however, be very strongly dependent on the internal (vibrational) energy of the target molecule and if the electron interaction occurs within as cluster (aerosol) new chemistry can occur that makes it difficult to predict the final anions. see ref. 2. However there is an active research community in the EU able to study these processes, and methods for making absolute cross sections have now been developed. So if you could indicate what you would like measured, it can be arranged (at least in the gaseous phase)!

Professor Coates responded: Thank you, we will consider this.

Professor Plane commented: Are you able to give even rough estimates of the number densities of these ions?

Professor Coates responded: We presented density per bin in the Geophys. Res. Lett. (2007) paper. Conversion of course depends on our best guess for assumptions on efficiency. My student Anne Wellbrock presented the Figure below at the meeting.

Miss Wellbrock continued: We are currently studying the effect of solar radiation on the negative ion densities in order to help constrain the chemical formation and destruction processes. We started by looking at an altitude range of 950–1050 km. At this range, solar radiation can reach the ions at solar zenith angles (SZA) of up to 135°, as can be seen in Fig. 4. However, at such high angles the amount of solar radiation may be very small. We use two sets of data. The first (left hand panel in Fig. 4) is from 22 Titan encounters where negative ions were observed. The second data set (right hand panel) is from one encounter only (T57) which took place at a SZA of ~135°. The actuator was fixed during this flyby which means that the data obtained is a continuous set of measurements. We study two different mass groups: light ions (10–30 amu) and heavier ions (110–200 amu). The density measurements shown have large uncertainties and should currently only be treated as relative densities.
 Fig. 4  Negative ions measured by Cassini CAPS electron spectrometer: Effects of solar zenith angle (SZA) on relative densities (horizontal axes). 
The results show that the densities of the light ions are highest at low SZAs (i.e. large amount of solar radiation), whereas the densities of the heavier ions are highest at high SZAs (i.e. no solar radiation). Therefore, nightside reactions seem to yield the highest densities for higher masses and photochemical reactions yield the highest densities for the lower mass negative ions. Both mass groups have a density minimum in the terminator region where only a small amount of solar radiation reaches the ions. In addition, the data from T57 show that there is a sudden decrease in density from being in complete darkness (marked as ‘in shadow', SZA just over 135°) to being exposed to a small amount of solar radiation (marked as ‘not in shadow', SZA just under 135°), especially for the heavier mass group.

Professor Plane asked: I am struck by your observation of large negative ions close to 1000 km altitude. A comparison with the Earth's atmosphere is instructive. Meteoric ablation gives rise to meteoric smoke particles in the aerobraking region around 90 km. If these particles, which are mostly negatively-charged through electron attachment, grow larger than about 5 nm in radius, they sediment rapidly out of the upper atmosphere. Even the smaller particles around 1 nm, which can be observed by high-power large aperture radars such as the Arecibo radar or by particle detectors on rockets, do not get much above 100 km.
The equivalent aerobraking region on Titan is around 500 km. Even though sedimentation on Titan is much slower because of the small gravitational force, the negative ions reported in this paper above 900 km must form in situ and then sediment to lower altitudes.

Professor Coates answered: Thanks for this useful comment which adds an interesting argument to our assumptions in the Planet. Space. Sci. (2009) paper.

Professor Schram asked: Regarding the negative ions differences in daylight and in shadow, could the following mechanism not be operationable: In sunlight the electron and positive ion densities become larger; if negative ions are produced they lead to a further enhancement of ion densities, as the transport is slower (negative ions tend to concentrate in the positive potential regions). Then, probably, mutual recombination could be a fast process therewith counteracting agglomoration to larger ions. In the dark part charges are less abundant (and electrons smaller in density?): and is there more time to grow in size?

Professor Coates responded: Thank you, we will consider this. There is some indication in the Wellbrock et al. poster (and Fig. 4, above, in reply to another comment) that this may be mass-dependent.

Professor Schram then opened the discussion of the paper by Dr Huestis, asking: Are there signs of non-equilibrium excitation in the observed spectra? This could be electronic (N 2D versus N 4S: the ratio is far above equilibrium) but also in vibration and rotation. Regarding rotational excitation: does this not reflect a dissociating or associating reaction to excite rotational non-equilibrium? And if so, does such a non-equilibrium influence the kinetics (e.g. by enhancing the rate of dissociative attachment)?

Dr Huestis replied: We have no direct evidence for vibrational or rotational excitation in CO2. The manuscript describes the role of vibrationally excited O2+(v) dissociative recombination, the high altitude source of O(1S). However, the CO(A–X) dayglow emission bands suggest a rotational temperature of roughly 1600 K for low-J levels and 10000 K for high-J levels, as a result of energy released in the UV photodissociation of CO2 [Conway, J. Geophys. Res., 1981, 86, 4767].

Professor Mitchell replied: Dissociative recombination rates and dissociative electron attachment rates are often strongly affected by the internal energy of the molecular ions or molecules. In one experiment, (Mostefaoui et al., J. Phys. B, 1999, 32, 5247) where we were able to study the recombination of NO+ ions with 14 vibrational states populated, we measured a rate that was a factor of three lower than rates measured for NO+ ions in the ground vibrational state.

Professor Schram concurred: I fully agree, that the internal excitation of molecular ion is an interesting aspect also in the context of plasma. In addition to vibration, rotational excitation may be important and may be stable enough to be important. Also in the dissociative recombination rotationally excited fragments can result as is measured e.g. for OH in emission A–X in an atmospheric water plasma (cf. P. Bruggeman et al., Plasma Process. Polym., 2009, 6, 751–762).

Professor Miller opened the first general discussion of the papers by noting: There have been several suggestions that H3+ is formed with over-populations of excited ~(ro-)vibrational states in planetary atmospheres. Extensive studies of Jupiter, however, have failed to find any spectroscopic evidence to support this. On the contrary, where hot band transitions have been found, they are generally less intense than one might expect from LTE calculations—a sign that non-LTE conditions are prevailing on those regions of the atmosphere where the higher vibrational levels are being populated.

Professor Schram continued: A second line of research (besides flames), which may be of interest to the planetary chemistry is that of low pressure plasma chemistry.1 The motivation in this field is to understand the processes active in plasma deposition, e.g. for solar cells. Fast deposition and thin layers of good quality are needed and there is a massive search for new materials and methods. Among others, carbon and silicon based materials have been analyzed thoroughly, also in view of other applications. This field is thus presently more-and-more directed to understanding volume and surface chemistry. The densities are so low that three-particle formation reactions are absent and the plasma medium is primarily dissociating. Formation of molecules takes place at the surface, where also deposition and etching occur. Despite the low pressure cluster, particle growth is observed and has been analyzed; dust may add new surfaces and will thus enhance molecule formation and deposition.2 The surface is modified by a strong absorption of radicals, as the conditions ensure that the radical flow is large and the LH desorption is low, because of the low temperature of the substrate.3 When the radical fluxes are large, excited molecules come from the surface, also with (besides vibrational or electronic) rotational excitation. For a recombining plasma hydrogen molecule formation at the surface H + H → H2(r,v) has been measured in detail showing high non-equilibrium rotational (and vibrational) excitation up to the dissociation limit, see for recent results on H2(r,v), HD(r,v) and D2(r,v).4 Other evidence for excited molecule formation is at the surface is observed for N2* and NO2*.5 Excited molecules may facilitate negative ion formation and thus open a new route to association of molecules and cluster formation.
There is more-and-more evidence that significant molecule formation takes place at the surface by association of adsorbed fragments, leading to preferred new molecules as H2, CO, H2O, HCN, CnHm, NH3, etc., depending on conditions.6 It proved that the resulting molecular content is quite similar, irrespective of the primary molecules used, as long as the atomic abundances in the dissociated molecules is the same.
It would be very interesting to investigate further interaction of the plasma chemistry with planetary science and to test models.

Professor Miller asked: The charge exchange reaction H+ + H2(v ≥4) → H + H2+ is thought to be extremely important in planetary atmospheres. We do not know this rate experimentally, however, and it would be very useful to have it. Are there any prospects of getting such measurements?

Professor Schram answered: I can quote a paper [Astrophys. J., 2004, 606, L167–L170] by Savin et al. with relevant references and names: Janev, from the fusion side, and Kristc. A serious discussion point refers to the possibility of vibrational excitation and even more important of rotational excitation of the H2(r,v) molecule. In experiments on recombining plasmas in Eindhoven and in Nieuwegein (a fusion lab) it appears that ions from the source, which are mainly H+, are very efficiently lost by what is called molecular assisted recombination. This process requires that first the atomic ions are converted to molecular ions by charge transfer with molecules. This has been first described by de Graaf et al. in 1993 (Phys. Rev. E, 48, 1993, 2098–2102): this was so efficient that an overall rate of in the order of 10−15 m3 s−1 was needed to explain the ion loss. Later it was found that at least partly this may be due to strong rotational (and vibrational) excitation; the rotational excitation is more important as it involves a much larger statistical weight as, e.g., described in a recent paper by Gabriel et al. (J. Chem. Phys., 2010, 132, 104305) The work in Nieuwegein also needs high rates to explain the observed ion loss in the expansion from the source (see, e.g., Shumack et al., Phys. Rev. E, 2008, 78(4), 046405). There is still discussion about the rates: recent experiments in Nieuwegein seem to require higher rates than quoted and the matter is under investigation. My personal guess is that it is probably due to a difference in rotational excitation: in highly recycling plasmas as these expanding plasmas are with molecules formed at surfaces in an excited state there is a strong non thermal r,v excitation of molecules. In this view one also needs information on the state of excitation of hydrogen molecules. Is there information on the r,v state of hydrogen molecules in planetary conditions?

Professor Ashfold continued: Pursuing the question about possible sources, and consequences, of rotational excitation in atmospheric species it is worth noting that long wavelength photolysis of NH3 (considered to be the major route for forming H atoms in the atmosphere of Titan) is known to produce NH2 fragments with high levels of rotational excitation, largely concentrated about the a-inertial axis.1 Similarly, and of possible relevance when considering the atmosphere of Enceladus, some of the OH fragments formed by Lyman-α photolysis of H2O carry extremely high levels of rotational (Erot > 4 eV) excitation, while others are formed in highly vibrationally excited (v ≤ 9) levels.2,3

Professor Suits spoke: These remarkable observations of negative ions bring to mind several questions. Of course photodetachment and its possible wavelength dependence is one issue. What role do you see for photodetachment as a loss process? Another is the question of multiply charged species. It is worthwhile to note that a species going from a higher charge state to a lower one (through photodetachment or loss of a small charged fragment) would exhibit an apparent increase in mass. Have you ever seen trends that might be consistent with this?

Professor Coates responded: According to the Vuittton et al. paper (Planet. Space Sci., 2009), photodetachment is not dominant. We will have a look back in the light of the second part of your comment.

Dr Sittler addressed Dr Yelle: Roger, what about the formation of C2H− from radiative attachment?

Dr Yelle replied: We did include these processes in the Vuitton et al. (2009) paper and calculated that the nitrile species (CN−, C3N−, C5N−) had significantly higher densities than the C2nH− species near the ionospheric peak near 1100 km. However, if you look at Fig. 9 in Vuitton et al. (2009) you will see that C2H− is very nearly the most abundant negative ion near 800 km (equal to C3N− and the second most abundant ion, after CN−, at 1200 km. This is undoubtedly for the reason that you point out, which is included in our calculations. It is certainly true that many of our rates are based on estimates rather than measurements, and we need to bear this in mind, but at the present time there does not appear to be any reason to favor C2nH− species over C2n+1N− species near the ionospheric peak. I would also point out that the new information presented at this conference by Coates et al. on the variations of negative ion densities with latitude and local time suggest that we should examine a wider range of conditions than considered in Vuitton et al. (2009), and perhaps the composition could vary with location.

Dr Vuitton said: Radiative attachment to C2nH (n = 1,2,3) is considered in the Vuitton et al. (2009) model. However, the process is slow for C2H according to calculations from Herbst and Osamura (2008). Although the calculations indicate that the rate is faster for C4H and C6H, the mole fraction of these radicals is small according to photochemical models (see for example Lavvas et al. 2008). As a consequence, radiative attachment is inefficient to produce C2nH− ions.

Dr Sittler replied: You state that the C2H forms in the lower atmosphere and is known to be of low abundance in Titan’s upper atmosphere, but that is based on a model calculation? What about the dissociative attachment for C2H2 to make C2H−? I would also like to respond to Dr Vuitton’s earlier comment: you state that the radiative reaction rate for C2H− is very slow, but it is relatively fast for C4H− and C6H−. All these are based on estimations and not measurements. Yes, the reaction rates for these radicals are expected to be fast, which will tend to make them less abundant, but they may also be forming rapidly too, from referring to Table 2 in Vuitton et al. (2009) paper.

Professor Mitchell stated: With regard to the dissociative attachment of electrons to molecules, size is not an important factor. What is critical is the position of the curve crossing between the initial and attaching negative ion states. For example, the difference in the attachment rate for 2 eV electrons to molecular hydrogen in the v = 0 and v = 6 vibrational states is six orders of magnitude (Wadehra, Phys. Rev. A, 1984, 29, 106) because the curve crossing occurs at this latter level (Bardsley and Wadehra, Phys. Rev. A, 1979, 2, 1398). For C2H, therefore, the rate will be determined by the ro-vibrational state and the position of the curve crossing.

Dr Sittler asked: What about the dissociative attachment for C2H2 to make C2H− (C2H2 + e− → C2H− + H)?

Dr Yelle replied: This is included in the calculations and is responsible for the relatively large abundance of C2H−.

Professor Mitchell returned to the discussion of the paper by Professor Coates: In your presentation, you mentioned that you had observed ions with 13800 amu q−1 so the units are in Thomsons rather than Daltons. The question is what is q? In flames, soot particles are predominantly electrically charged, either positively by thermionic emission of electrons or negatively by electron attachment. These are large structures and it is known that they can carry many charges. This is an intriguing question, I believe, in the present context.

Professor Coates responded: We had a brief look at this in the Geophys. Res. Lett. paper (2007) in order to examine charging in the ionospheric plasma environment, and made a simple calculation which limits the possible number of charges to a few (up to 5). If the charge were that large it would indeed affect our mass results making the molecules/aerosols even bigger. So I agree charge should certainly be taken into account and measured in the next mission—but for now we must use the data we have.

Professor Ashfold returned to the discussion of the paper by Dr Huestis: Huestis and colleagues present convincing evidence that, contrary to previous assumptions, solar photolysis of CO2 is not the principal source of the O(1S–3P) Mars day glow emission. This begs the following questions: Is it possible to put an upper limit on the possible contribution that CO2 photolysis could make to the day glow emission (relative to that from the e− + O2(v) reaction) without revealing itself in plots like that shown in Fig. 4? If so, does this upper limit encourage a reduction in the O(1S) quantum yield from CO2 photolysis at 110–115 nm (which has traditionally been assumed to be unity)?

Dr Huestis replied: The shortness of the oral presentation prevented detailed discussion and interpretation of multiple possible production mechanisms of O(1S). Pages 10–12 of the manuscript (Interpretation and Modeling) cover this topic, including a Figure illustrating the current incomplete knowledge of the wavelength dependence of the quantum yield for O(1S) from photodissociation of CO2. While we still believe that the yield is high, between 110 and 120 nm, we think that the overall yield integrated over the solar spectrum and the CO2 absorption spectrum, may be substantially lower than previously estimated, largely because the absorption cross section is so highly structured. Our overall conclusion is that vibrationally excited O2+(v) dissociative recombination is the primary source of O(1S) above 120 km, while 121.6 nm (Lyman α) photodissociation of CO2 dominates between 80 and 120 nm. If one connects these two mechanisms in Fig. 12 from Fox and Dalgarno [J. Geophys. Res., 1979, 84, 7315], one obtains a reasonably straight line on log paper from 80 to 180 km, as in the data shown in the Fig. 5 in the manuscript. See also Fox and Hac [Icarus, 2010, 208, 176] and Fig. 1 in Fox and Yeager [Icarus, 2009, 200, 468].

Professor Mitchell asked: Could you comment on the role of dissociative recombination on isotope loss in planetary atmospheres?

Dr Huestis answered: Fox and Hac have recently reported a comprehensive investigation titled ‘Isotope fractionation in photochemical escape of O from Mars’ [Icarus, 2010, 208, 176], following dissociative recombination. They model the altitude dependence of vibrational excitation in normal and isotopic O2+(v). The lighter atomic isotope, 16O, escapes preferentially, consistent with its lower mass.

Mr Thissen addressed Professor Coates: The z parameter of the m/z ratio is very difficult to evaluate in the heavy ions detected in the m/z range around 1000. As these objects might be close to the macroscopic scale, some signals might have been recorded by the CDA instrument on board Cassini. This detector is based on the ballistic impact of dusts and subsequent ionization by the resulting plasma. It is most probably sensitive to the mass, and not the m/z of the particles. If no signal was detected, even in the altitude range where CAPS detects heavy ions, this might put an upper limit to the possible mass of the negatively charged ions, and therefore also an upper limit on the z parameter.

Professor Coates answered: That is an interesting comment, many thanks—we will check with the CDA team.

Professor Plane opened the discussion of the paper by Dr Adams: Another source of negative ions in the upper atmospheres of solar system bodies is meteoric ablation, which produces iron, magnesium and silicon vapours in roughly equal quantities [T. Vondrak, J. M. C. Plane, S. L. Broadley and D. Janches, A chemical model of meteoric ablation, Atmos. Chem. Phys., 2008, 8, 7015–7031]. These elements should undergo oxidation and eventually form metal silicates, MgSiO3 and FeSiO3. I have used ab initio quantum calculations to show that these molecules have very large dipole moments—12.2 and 9.5 Debye, respectively—and electron affinities of 2.6 eV. The metal carbonates have similar properties. So these metal-containing molecules should polymerise readily into larger particles (known in the terrestrial atmosphere as “meteoric smoke”) and attach electrons to form quite stable heavy negative ions.

Dr Sittler asked: All your association and proton transfer reaction rates using the SIFT apparatus were measured at 298 K and at high pressures so three-body collisions dominated. You note that condensation in the flow tube limits your measurements to T > 180 K. As shown by Morales et al. (this volume) using the CRESU techniques for temperature range between 23 K to 300 K one cannot reliably extrapolate measurements at 300 K to T ~ 150 K for Titan’s upper atmosphere and ionosphere. All the Cassini INMS (m/q ≤ 100 amu for neutral and positive ions), CAPS-IBS (m/q < 350 amu for positive ions) and CAPS-ELS (m/q < 13000 amu) for negative ions are all measured for heights ≥950 km where ion/neutral temperatures T ~ 150 K, electron temperatures Te ~ 1000 K and pressures are very low (on the order of nanobars) so two-body collisions dominate. Even the CRESU observations are made under high pressure conditions. Will it ever be possible to make such measurements in the future that are more characteristic of Titan’s upper atmosphere where all this complex chemistry is occurring or can one make reliable corrections to such measurements? You also note that the recombination reactions are more likely dominated by the electron temperature, and in this case one has the inverse condition where your electron temperatures are <550 K (collisional equilibrium with Helium carrier gas), while electron temperatures within Titan’s upper atmosphere Te ~ 1000 K. Like the question for association reactions, will it be possible to increase your measurements to T ~ 1000 K or make reliable corrections without using simple extrapolations?

Dr Adams answered: One of the main points of this work has been to show that association can compete with facile processes such as proton and charge transfer. Thus, large species can be rapidly produced and this warrants further study. Pressure dependence studies will show if association is pressure saturated. If so then association can be important at low pressures, especially with the longer lifetimes of the intermediate complex at the lower temperatures appropriate to the Titan atmosphere. On the second point, dissociative electron–ion recombination is difficult to study especially with the differing ion and electron temperatures. Both theoretical studies and, I agree, higher temperature measurements need to be made to understand this process and permit meaningful extrapolations to Titan conditions.

Dr Vuitton asked: Your experiments show that several reaction channels are association. Can you tell if these are collisionally stabilized or radiatively stabilized? This is a fundamental information for modelers. In the former case, these channels can be ignored in Titan's models (in the upper atmosphere, the pressure is too low for 3-body reactions to occur) but in the later case, they have to be included.

Dr Adams answered: The association channels are competitive with processes such as proton and charge transfer. That the latter processes usually occur at the gas kinetic rate, implies that association is occurring with high efficiency and thus is a saturated collisionally stabilized reaction. To confirm this, would require a study as a function of third body pressure; a saturated reaction would have a pressure independent binary rate constant. As the pressure is reduced, the association would eventually become an unsaturated ternary reaction. If the temperature is reduced, then the lifetime of the intermediate complex would increase and the reaction would remain saturated down to lower pressures. To be certain of the temperatures and pressures at which the changeover from saturated to unsaturated kinetics occurs would require detailed experimental studies. The main purpose of the present study is to make the community aware of these effects on their chemical models.

Professor Sims noted: The size of the ion–molecule reactive systems studied by Adams et al.1 means that radiative association could be significant pathway to form association products, at least under the relatively low pressure conditions prevailing in Titan’s ionosphere. Ryzhov et al.2 show for example that the rate coefficient for formation of protonated acetone (a relatively small system in comparison to some of those studied here) by radiative association reaches a value of 8.4 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at 245 K, with a strong negative temperature dependence. Radiative association should therefore be taken into account as a pathway for the growth of larger ionic species in models of planetary ionospheres.

Dr Sittler asked: So, one can correct the high pressure measurements by considering their radiative relaxation to lower energy states after a 2-body collision, and that these radiative time scales are shorter than mean time between collisions? With three-body collision is some of the excess energy carried away by the none reactive component? Is that what you're trying to say?

Professor Sims replied: In general, radiative association is very difficult to observe experimentally, in particular for neutral–neutral associations, as it is hard to attain conditions where the time for stabilisation of the initial excited adduct by a third-body collision (which indeed does carry away some of the excess energy, by analogy with the Lindemann mechanism1 for unimolecular reactions) is longer than the radiative lifetime. We have in the past used measurements on collisionally-assisted association at low temperatures coupled with simple calculations on deactivation by infrared emission to provide an estimate of the radiative association rate coefficient for the CH + H2 ⇌ CH3 reaction.

Dr Ellinger asked: C3H3+ is known to exist under two structures, one linear, one cyclic. Could the different products of the reaction of C3H3+ with pyridine be related to the two different isomers ?

Dr Adams answered: The reaction of C3H3+ with toluene (Fig. 2 in the paper) shows that two isomers, linear and cyclic, are indeed present and react at different rates. Thus, in the reaction with pyridine, where both isomers react at the gas kinetic rate, the product distribution will be a combination of those for the two isomer reactions.

Professor Mitchell commented: Your Fig. 5 is surprising, as you show a positive temperature dependence for the recombination rates. I have only seen this previously in the work of Alan Hayhurst on flame studies of H3O+. Is this dependence due to ro-vibrational excitation of the recombining ions at higher temperatures?

Dr Adams replied: Positive temperature dependencies are unusual and prior to this study, temperature dependencies for proton bound dimer species had not been made. Thus, there has been no previous data for direct comparison.

Dr Biennier said: Dr Wolf Geppert from Stockholm University presented recently the measurement of the dissociative recombination of protonated benzene C6H7+ performed with the CRYRING magnetic storage ring. The rate constant he derived, about 2 × 10−6 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at room temperature, is much higher than your results obtained in a flow tube. How do you explain this discrepancy?

Dr Adams responded: There are several points to consider. Geppert’s measurement in the Storage Ring (SR) was for C6D7+ whereas we studied C6H7+ recombination in the Flowing Afterglow (FA) and hydrogenated species are known to recombine somewhat more rapidly. In addition, the SR measures cross sections and rate constants are derived by integrating over a Maxwell–Boltzmann energy distribution. Thus, the internal energy of the ions is not changed and this SR value is not a truly thermal rate constant, as is obtained in the FA. The rate constant of this reaction has previously been measured in a FA (J. L. McLain, V. Poterya, C. D. Molek, L. M. Babcock and N. G. Adams, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2004, 108, 6704) with a value at room temperature close to Geppert’s but with a different temperature dependence. From a consideration of the present study, this previous value may have been contaminated by proton bound dimers, (C6H6)2H+

Professor Mitchell commented: Storage ring experiments measure cross sections as a function of electron energy. They are really collision experiments rather than experiments that measure reactions under chemical conditions. When one measures a cross section at 1 eV but the ion is in its vibrational ground state, one cannot speculate on the rate of reaction of that ion at 11000 K even if at that temperature the ion would still exist! This is an exaggeration and in fact one measures cross sections over a wide energy range to determine the effect of the Maxwellian distribution of electron energies on the ion being studied, usually in a cold state. Rate coefficients measured in flames yield rates that are very different from those measured in cooler experiments for the ions are ro-vibrationally excited and this aspect is not taken into account in storage ring experiments. A beautiful example of this is shown in the work of LeGarrec et al. who studied the dramatic effects of ro-vibrational excitation on the complementary process of dissociative electron attachment to neutral molecules (LeGarrec et al., J. Chem. Phys., 1997, 107, 54).

Professor Schram said: My question concerns the possibility of the formation of negative ions during the flow time by dissociative attachment to fragments resulting from dissociative recombination? Radical fragments from the latter process could be (e.g. rotational) excited, as there is substantial energy available in the dissociative recombination. Could such processes influence your results?

Dr Adams replied: In the flowing afterglow, fragmentation products from dissociative electron–ion recombination will have a number density less than or equal to the ionization number density of 4 × 1010 cm−3. Thus, unless the fragments have an attachment rate constant at the gas kinetic limit (about 4 × 10−7 cm3 s−1 as is obtained for SF6 and CCl4) there will be no significant electron attachment. In addition, the variation of electron density with distance along the flow tube will be very different for the two processes. Indeed to study electron attachment, the electron density has to be reduced to about 109 cm−3 to inhibit recombination; but it is an interesting question.

Dr Loison opened the discussion of the paper by Alexandre Faure: Why do you choose to fit the experimental data between 10 K and 300 K and not between 1 K and 300 K?

Dr Faure replied: The choice of ∼10 K is indeed rather arbitrary and it could be actually optimized to each system (when low temperature data are available) in the typical range 1–100 K. The current choice of ∼10 K provides however a good compromise for all the available data presented in our paper.

Dr Pernot noted: You said that we should reach the 10 percent uncertainty limit to get good predictions. I hope that this is not the message that has been retained from my earlier presentation. Otherwise, we had better stop working right now! My message is rather: “If you know that this interpolation method provides rate coefficients within a factor of two, please make use of this uncertainty information in model predictions, by all means!”

Dr Faure responded: I fully agree with this comment. Our hope is that the inclusion of our results in chemical models will improve the current predictions, even with a factor of two of uncertainty.

Dr Pernot asked: In the conclusion of your paper, you state that “a sensitivity analysis should be done”. Do you have any project in this direction, or is this a bottle in the sea?

Dr Faure responded: We have currently no project on sensitivity analysis but we are interested in a possible collaboration with your group.

Professor Plane asked: While agreement is generally good (within a factor of 2) between your semi-empirical approach and measurements at low temperatures, in some cases illustrated in Fig. 2 and 4, the agreement is very poor (more than a factor of 10 difference). Could you discuss why this might be the case?

Dr Faure replied: As recognized in our paper, deviations larger than a factor of 2 (up to a factor of 10) are indeed found with ion trap measurements below 50 K, both for cations (CH4+ and C3H+) and an anion (NH2−). It is not clear why the measured rates are only a small fraction of the Langevin value at very low temperature. Possible explanations include dynamical bottlenecks caused by the influence of the rotation of H2 and/or nuclear-spin effects, the competition between the abstraction and the radiative association channels but also uncertainties in the experimental temperature of the ions. Some of these effects are discussed in Savic and Gerlich, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2005, 7, 1026.

Professor Mason asked: Do you have an explanation of why the rate constant for some ions appears to plateau (remain constant) for low temperatures?

Dr Faure replied: Rate constants for (fast and exothermic) ion–non polar molecule reactions are expected to “saturate” at about the Langevin value when the temperature is decreased. The Langevin value, or capture limit, is indeed the upper limit of the reaction rate, when all collisions lead to reaction. This saturation effect has been observed for numerous reactions in the past and it is clearly illustrated in Fig. 2 of our paper for C3+ + H2 where the rate remains constant, at the Langevin value, below ∼50 K. Now for C4+ + H2, C3+ + H2 (Fig. 2) and NH2− + H2 (Fig. 4), the rates are found to plateau at about the same temperature but with only a small fraction of the Langevin value. As discussed by Savic and Gerlich ( Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2005, 7, 1026), this “low” saturation can be only partly explained by the radiative association channel which becomes dominant at very low temperature. Nuclear spin effects and rotational bottlenecks probably play an important role, as discussed in our paper. Thus, the appearance of a plateau is expected from simple capture arguments but the saturation value depends on the nuclear rearrangement dynamics which is driven by the whole potential energy surface and is ignored in the capture approach.

Dr Moses opened the discussion of the paper by Ms Whalley: The maximum Mg+ density in your model is smaller than the electron densities observed for the low-altitude layers in the Martian radio-occultation profiles. Is that of any concern to you?

Ms Whalley replied: The sporadic third layers on Mars are formed by atmospheric forces acting to concentrate some of the background layer of ions into a small (1–2 km thick), highly concentrated layer. The model output shows the concentration of the Mg+ background layer in the Martian upper atmosphere. The purpose of the model was to see if the background layer of Mg+ had a sufficient concentration, so that if formed into a sporadic E layer, it could create the concentrations (of the sporadic layers) observed by the radio occultation measurements.

Professor Atreya asked: This is a neat result for the specific set of data chosen in your study, but can you say whether the derived rate constant would be valid for other sets of data? As you may know, there are wide variations in the magnitude and the altitude of sporadic E layer seen in the MGS and MEX radio occultations data.

Ms Whalley replied: I think the derived rate coefficient would be applicable to other sets of data. The major constraint is knowing the atomic O concentration at different altitudes in the Martian atmosphere.

Professor Mason enquired: Your experiments on MgO+ with ozone are interesting but are they relevant to Mars, where ozone concentrations are so much lower than on Earth?

Professor Plane answered: No, the O3 reactions with Mg+ and MgO+ are not important in the Martian atmosphere. Recombination of Mg+ with CO2 is the most rapid reaction below 100 km. The resulting Mg+·CO2 cluster ion then undergoes slow ligand-switching with O2. The reactions of Mg+·CO2 and Mg+·O2 with atomic O, followed by reaction of MgO+ with O, then recycle the molecular ions to the atomic Mg+.

Mr Thissen commented: Do you plan to study Mg2+ ions and what chemistry do you expect from these?

Ms Whalley responded: I personally don't intend to study Mg2+ ions so I'm not sure what behaviour to expect.

Professor Mitchell: You refer to magnesium on Mars and it is interesting because people are studying the combustion of magnesium in carbon dioxide as this could be used as a solid rocket fuel there. Aluminium which is usually used for this purpose on Earth does not burn in carbon dioxide, but magnesium does. My question, however, concerns the emission of electrons from magnesium oxide particles. Experiments in flames have shown that the work function of magnesium oxide particles seems to be about 0.75 eV and thus they should release lots of electrons by thermionic emission or photoemission. Can these effects be incorporated into your model?

Ms Whalley answered: We have briefly looked at these effects, so with further study they could be incorporated.

Professor Plane continued: We do not include MgO particle formation in our model of magnesium in the Martian atmosphere. The reason is that MgO recombines very rapidly with CO2 to form MgCO3 [R. J. Rollason and J. M. C. Plane, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2001, 3, 4733–4740], so that the concentration of MgO in the Martian atmosphere will be extremely low. Thus, MgO particles will not form by the direct condensation of MgO, but could form indirectly from the polymerization and subsequent rearrangement of species such as MgCO3.

Dr Sittler remarked: Borucki and Whitten1 had modeled nanoparticles or embryo aerosols in Titan’s lower atmosphere. Their modeling had shown that they actually reduced the ionization within Titan’s lower atmosphere since they tended to acquire negative charges, thus reduce electron densities and thus reduce electron conductivities in agreement with Huygens probe measurements as reported by Fulchignoni et al.2 and Hamelin et al.3 So, the nanoparticles could reduce electron densities and not form ionization layers as suggested by Brian Mitchell.

Professor Mason addressed the meeting: In discussing the question of the role of light producing (or removing) electrons from dust (and meteorite dust) I would draw attention to the work of Rapp in the University of Rostock, e.g. M. Rapp, Charging of mesospheric aerosol particles; the role of photodetachment and photoionization from meteoretic smoke and ice particles , Geophysics, 2009, 27, 2417–2422.

Professor Schram remarked: The general experience for plasma processing plasmas is that clusters are negatively charged. The charge for a spherical cluster would be in the order of 1 charge per nanometer radius if the electron temperature Te is around 1 eV (proportional to r in nm and Te in eV). The negative charging is a consequence of the large mobility of electrons, leading to fast charging of any surface in a plasma and an ambipolar field, causing an acceleration of the ions and deceleration of the electrons. The initial negative charging will be determined by the arrival of the first electrons and will depend on electron density ne and electron velocity and though considerably limited by orbital restraints, will be fast.
For small clusters in the nanometer range it is believed that the charge is not stable and changes from 1 positive to 1 negative and neutral. If, with strong photon fluxes, clusters become positively charged, then the attraction of electrons becomes even of Coulomb character, with very large cross sections in particular for low electron temperatures. At the other hand the plasma negative charge will linearly depend on Te and if Te is small (100 K = 0.01 eV) then one charge (on average) is expected for a 100 nm cluster. It is not clear to me whether in that situation compensated charges would occur on the relatively large clusters in particular if it is made up by isolating material. It is, however, evident that in the situation of low Te (small charge), low ne (long charging time) and large photon fluxes (photoelectron emission) the possibility of positive clusters will be substantially higher. Based on these considerations a positive charge would be expected when the cluster comes just out of the shadow (low Te and ne) in the light.
One aspect that can also influence this discussion is that, in a plasma, positively charged clusters can be more easily observed than negatively charged ones, because of the above mentioned ambipolar fields: if one applies a positive potential to extract negative ions then first the electrons will be attracted leaving the heavy negative ions behind. This changes only if all electrons get lost in charging clusters. It could be of interest to compare experience in plasma chemistry and planetary science. In ref. 2–3 also various ion mass spectra can be found from work in groups of Winter and of Hollenstein.

Professor Mitchell continued: This is an important point, for the fact that particles are charged will greatly influence their aggregation. In combustion, the great proportion of soot particles are charged. They can become positively charged by thermionic emission and ion attachment and negatively charged by electron attachment. When electronegative materials such as halons are added to a flame, the amount of negative charging increases and it is observed that soot particles are much bigger. Positive charging by photoemission will undoubtedly be important as will the attachment processes mentioned by Professor Schram. It is intriguing to think of what might happen in the case of the hot atmospheres of some Jupiter-like exoplanets where the temperatures can reach 1500 K or more, similar to that of a flame. Thermionic charging of graphite-like particles if they exist, might then be important.
Another charging mechanism for exoplanets near hot stars would be particle charging by X-ray absorption which can lead to very intense electron emission [J. B. A. Mitchell et al., Astron. Astrophys., 2002, 386, 743].

Professor Plane asked: Although aerosols (ice particles and meteoric smoke particles) are generally negatively charged—at least in the earth's upper mesosphere—rocket flights occasionally measure layers of positively-charged aerosols. One explanation for this is that the particles attach metallic atoms which lower their work function. These metallic atoms are produced by the ablation of meteoroids in the planetary aerobraking region. We showed that this is the case for Na atoms attached to amorphous ice, where the work function dropped to about 2.3 eV and the photo-ionization cross section increased enormously [T. Vondrak, J. M. C. Plane and S. R. Meech, Photoemission from sodium on ice: A mechanism for positive and negative charge coexistence in the mesosphere, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2006, 110, 3860–3863].

Professor Schram answered: Please refer to my remarks above.

Dr Sittler asked: I must clarify my earlier comment so I don’t quote Borucki and Whitten (2008) incorrectly. Nanoparticles tend to have low ionization potentials <7 eV and even with Titan’s thick atmosphere and aerosols at higher altitudes, which tend to extinct the solar UV that produce photoemission from the nanoparticles, they still found photoemissions too high and thus electron conductivities too high. Therefore, they speculated that the aerosols were composed of a tholin core with a liquid methane–ethane outer layer. This was based on the Huygens ACP measurements reported by Israel et al.1 which are considered somewhat contentious. With this model, methane and ethane in their gas phase for altitudes >150 km would absorb the UV that would otherwise produce photoemission from the nanoparticles or aerosols. In the case of Mars, where there is no extinction of the UV from higher altitudes, the nanoparticles should have significant photoemission rates and as the modeling of Borucki and Whitten2 for Titan show, the nanoparticles should produce significant ionization layers within Mars atmosphere as reported here by Whalley et al. in this volume.

Professor Plane opened the second general discussion of the papers, stating: Recombination reactions involving ions often occur in the “fall-off” region where the kinetics are changing from third- to second-order (becoming independent of pressure). Extrapolation of the rate coefficient over a range of pressures then requires knowledge of the high-pressure limiting rate coefficient. Often this is set equal to the ion–neutral capture rate, which can be estimated using Langevin theory (with a modification if the neutral reactant has a significant dipole moment). However, recent work has shown that ion–molecule recombination reactions sometimes have high pressure-limiting rate coefficients which can be more than an order of magnitude smaller than the capture rate. Explanations for this include the effect of an anisotropic potential surface, and collision-induced dissociation. We recently carried out a study of Mg+ recombining with H2O, where this was the case [E. Martinez-Nunez, C. L. Whalley, D. Shalashilin and J. M. C. Plane, Dynamics of Mg+ + H2O + He: capture, collisional stabilization and collision-induced dissociation, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2010, 114, 6472–6479].

Dr Pernot noted: Dissociative recombination (DR) is a key process in the ionospheric chemistry of Titan. Experimental measurements of branching ratios of DR have shown a formidable variety of fragmentation patterns, often with bond breaking between heavy atoms [Florescu-Mitchell and Mitchell, Phys. Rep., 2006, 430, 277–374]. It is therefore striking that most modern ionospheric chemistry models implement a very impoverished representation of DR, mostly through a single H-loss channel. The introduction of three channels for the DR of CH2NH2+ by Yelle et al. in Paper 2 is a remarkable exception. As many important ions in Titan's ionosphere are protonated neutrals, the reduction of DR to “H-loss” can be expected to bias significantly the production of stable/heavy neutrals over the production of reactive/energetic radicals. We (S. Plessis, N. Carrasco and P. Pernot) recently submitted a paper entitled “Knowledge-based probabilistic representations of branching ratios in chemical networks: the case of dissociative recombinations” [J. Chem. Phys., 2010, 133, 134110] addressing specifically this issue (see also poster P05). Our analysis is that the systematic implementation of the H-loss scenario is due to the incapacity of modelers to implement available data in their models. The main problem is that the measured DR branching ratios often correspond to incompletely determined products: for CxHyNz+ ions of high relevance to Titan, the number of H atoms within each fragment is not experimentally resolved, leaving the chemical identity of the products unspecified. For instance, the DR of acrylonitrile, CH2CHCNH+, leads to about 50% of C3NHx + yH + wH2, and 50% of C2Hx + CNHy + zH + wH2, with the constraint x + y + z + 2w = 4 [Vigren et al., Astrophys. J., 2009, 695, 317–324]. Considering all the exoergic products, one is left with 15 channels (6 in the first group and 7 in the second), if one ignores the possible HCN/HNC isomers. The probability distribution within each group is totally unknown, which prevents a deterministic modeling of this complex process. As a solution, we suggest a probabilistic representation of uncertain data. We use nested Dirichlet distributions to represent the probabilistic tree imposed by the structured uncertainty in the branching ratios data. This enables us to implement for the first time all available DR branching ratios data within a ionospheric chemistry model. We compared the production rates of neutral species and radicals obtained through our representation to the production rates of a “H-loss”-based scenario representative of existing models. We observe a spectacular enhancement of the production rates for reactive radicals, such as C3H and NH2 (a factor of 10000), NH and C3N (a factor of 1000), etc. At the opposite, the production rate of stable neutrals such as C3H4, HC3N or CH3CN is reduced by a factor of about 10 .
This study confirms that the present ionospheric models based on the H-loss paradigm unduly boost the production of stable neutrals at the expense of reactive radicals, depriving the radical chemistry of a rich chemodiversity. It appears also that DR can be a significant source of radical chemistry during the night-time. Implementation of our full RD scheme in a coupled ion–neutral ionospheric model is in progress.

Professor Mitchell enquired: The products of recombination are released with large energies and this can go into either kinetic energy or internal energy (ro-vibrational or even sometimes electronic excitation). Is thought ever given to the effect of this excitation on the subsequent reactivity of these radicals?

Dr Pernot answered: I have not made an exhaustive bibliographic search, but I know of two papers related to this kind of issue: “Photochemical sources of non-thermal neutrals for the exosphere of Titan”, by T. E. Cravens et al. [Planet. Space Sci., 1997, 45, 889–896] and the more recent “Titan's corona: The contribution of exothermic chemistry” by V. de la Haye et al. [Icarus, 2007, 191, 236–250]. Both papers treat of the escape of molecules and of suprathermal neutrals, but do not consider the effect of internal energy on reactivity. In both papers, DR is treated with a single dissociation channel for each ions, generally the most exothermic one, with all excess energy released into kinetic energy. In one of our papers “Sensitivity of a Titan ionospheric model to the ion–molecule reaction parameters” [N. Carrasco et al., Planet. Space Sci., 2008, 56, 1644–1657], we have considered the effect of the different reactivity of excited N+(1D) on the ionospheric composition, and observed only minor effects. We are clearly in need of more comprehensive studies, which will not be facilitated by the lack of accurate data.

Dr Adams continued: In some of the recombination product distributions which you showed, the products were not fully separated and your statistical analysis seems reasonable. When the product distribution is fully resolved, I assume that a statistical analysis is not required?

Dr Pernot replied: I would rather say that in most cases of interest for Titan's atmosphere the products are not fully separated and require a statistical treatment. In those few cases where all products are resolved, the statistical modeling is indeed much simpler, but we still account for measurement uncertainty (which is not always negligible) and use the Dirichlet representation to ensure a unit sum of all branching ratios.

Professor Coates remarked: We would be interested to find out more about the processes at work in Titan's upper atmosphere which result in an interesting chemical mix between neutrals, heavy positive ions and even heavier negative ions, as seen in our observations. It would be good to learn more about the possible processes from people working in lab experiments and theory (see paper 13 in this volume by Coates et al.).
In addition, we use microchannel plates in the Cassini instruments, and it would be useful to understand the microchannel plate efficiency for very heavy negative ions (up to 13800 amu q−1) in particular better than we do at present. Our electron spectrometer was designed for electrons and has a post-acceleration of only ~+200 V. Experience from people working with high mass ions in the lab would be appreciated. This would help us make better density estimations.

Professor Plane said: Earlier in the discussion I referred to the formation of metal silicate molecules in the aerobraking regions of solar system bodies, and the fact that these molecules have unusually high electron affinities and should therefore form stable negative ions. Meteoric ablation on Titan should be a comparatively gentle affair, because of the very large atmospheric scale height—incoming meteoroids will not hit a “brick wall” of air, as they do with the terrestrial planets. Nevertheless, Fe, Mg and Si should be able to form metal silicates. Is it possible that any of the negative ions measured by the CAPS instrument are anions such as MgSiO3−?

Professor Coates replied: As I understand it this may be an effect lower in the Titan atmosphere than where we see the particles, but we will have a look at it.

Dr Moses asked: Regarding the production of negative ions on Titan, I think that the plan for the end of the extended Cassini mission is to pass the spacecraft through Saturn's upper atmosphere a time or two before plunging the spacecraft into Saturn to end the mission. It will be interesting to see whether high-molecular-weight negative ions are present in Saturn's upper atmosphere as they are on Titan; their presence or absence on Saturn should provide clues to the formation mechanism(s).

Professor Coates answered: Agreed—we had assumed that this was related to the Titan mix of atmospheric neutrals, but we will certainly look at that time.

Professor Mitchell noted: A good source of information on the efficiency of microchannel plates for detecting heavy ions is the following: G. W. Fraser, The ion detection efficiency of microchannel plates, Int. J. Mass Spectrom., 2002, 215, 13. Fig. 19 in this paper gives efficiency curves for heavy molecular ions as a function of impact energy on the detector. (Note that the reference to the review of Frank from which this Figure is derived should have the page number 375, and not 275 as in the text.)

Professor Coates answered: Thanks, we will look at this again and at information on proteins mentioned at the meeting.
