    , Accepted 16th February 2015First published on 16th February 2015AbstractA series of donor–acceptor type of π-conjugated oligomers based on dithieno[3,2-b;2′,3′-d]silole as the electron donor and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as the electron acceptor were designed and synthesized. It was found that the elongation of the molecular lengths of the chromophores can significantly influence the thermal properties, UV-vis absorption, electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic performances of fabricated organic solar cells. The higher molecular weight chromophore exhibited a narrower band gap compared to lower molecular weight counterparts. Solution processed bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated with the inverted device structure of ITO/PFN-OX/oligomer:PCBM/MoO3/Al, in which the best device performance was achieved with a power conversion efficiency of 1.12%. These results indicated that the elongation of the molecular length of π-conjugated small-molecules can be an effective strategy for improving the organic photovoltaic performance of narrow band-gap chromophores.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable attention because of their great potential for the fabrication of low-cost, light weight and flexible devices.1–3 Recently, remarkable progress by virtue of relatively high power conversion efficiency of more than 10% has been reached on the basis of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) architectures in the photoactive layer.4–7 In general, the BHJ architectures comprised fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), as electron-accepting materials, and various narrow band-gap π-conjugated small-molecules or polymers as the electron-donating materials. With respect to the polymeric counterparts, π-conjugated small-molecules have attracted particular interests not singly due to the easily tailoring of their molecular structures, which can lead to competitive device performances, but also because of their specific advantages of precise synthesis and purification, which can avoid batch-to-batch variations.8–11 Despite the well-extended absorbance, appropriate energy levels, high charge-carrier mobility and desirable phase separation can be achieved based on these conjugated small molecules,12–14 the device performance in terms of power conversion efficiencies are still lag behind those based on conjugated polymers.15–17 These issues lead to the necessity of systematically elucidating the structure–property relationships of such chromophores, which is critically important and can provide the guideline for future molecular design.18–23
It is well-established that the dithieno[3,2-b;2′,3′-d]silole (DTS) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) moieties can act as promising building blocks for the construction of high-performance π-conjugated small-molecules and polymers.11,22 For example, Liu et al. developed a series of narrow band gap conjugated chromophores comprised of DTS, BT and various electron-deficient moieties in the molecular backbone, and systematically examined the influence of the molecular architectures on the thermal resistance, self-organization, and charge carrier mobility and optoelectronic properties.24 Liu et al. also developed several DTS/BT based conjugated chromophores by incorporating fluorine substitutions to examine the effects of molecular fluorination on the bulk thermal properties relevant to optoelectronic device applications.25 While a wide range of conjugated small molecules comprising DTS and BT units have been developed, less effort has been devoted to examining the influence of extended π-conjugation on the electronic properties and device performance of molecules basically consisting of DTS and BT unit.
This paper reports the synthesis, characterization and photovoltaic application of a series of donor–acceptor (D–A) type of π-conjugated oligomers on the basis of DTS as the electron-donating unit (D) and BT as the electron-accepting unit (A), which is briefly denoted as DA, ADA, DAD, DADAD. The molecular framework of the DTS-based oligomers varied with the conjugation length and end groups. The elongation of the molecular length can have great impact on the UV-vis absorption, molecular orbital energy levels, film morphologies, as well as the performance of the fabricated organic solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1. Measurement and characterization
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AV-300 (300 MHz) in a deuterated chloroform solution with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were recorded with a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MODLI-TOF analyzer. The UV-vis spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a Netzsch TG 209 under N2 flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The surface roughness and morphology of the thin films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on an Agilent 5400. For cyclic voltammetry (scan rate 50 mV cm−1), the electrochemical apparatus consisted of a CHI660B electrochemical workstation, platinum working electrodes, counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE).
2.2. Device fabrication and characterization
The organic photovoltaic cells were constructed in the form of the inverted structure of glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/PFN-OX/oligomer:PCBM/MoO3/Al.26 The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and dried in a nitrogen stream, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment. To fabricate the photovoltaic devices, a thin layer (∼40 nm) of poly[9,9-bis(6,6′-(N,N-diethylamino)hexyl)fluorene-alt-9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)hexyl)fluorene] (PFN-OX) was spin-coated on the pre-cleaned glass substrates at 5000 rpm and baked at 140 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions.27 The substrates were then transferred to an argon-filled glove box. A blended solution of the oligomers and PC61BM or PC71BM with different weight ratios were prepared in a mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and chloroform. Subsequently, the solutions were spin-coated onto the PFN-OX coated ITO substrate to form an active layer of about 100 nm. To complete device fabrication, a 3 nm MoO3 layer and an 80 nm Al were evaporated thermally onto the active layer through shadow masks. The effective area was measured to be 0.15 cm2.
2.3. Synthesis of intermediates and target oligomers
All chemicals and reagents were purchased from either Aldrich or Alfa-Aesar, and the reactions and manipulations were carried out under a dry argon atmosphere.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization
The detailed synthetic routes of all intermediates and target oligomers are shown in Scheme 1. The oligomer DA could be prepared facilely from the starting materials of 4-bromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (1) and 4,4′-bis(n-octyl)-5-trimethytin-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (3)28 on the basis of a palladium-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reaction. The target oligomer ADA was synthesized in a moderate yield using compound 1 and 4,4′-bis(n-octyl)-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (4)28 as the starting materials. The analogues synthetic procedure using compound 328 and 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (2)29 as the starting materials gave the target oligomer DAD. The higher molecular weight oligomer, DADAD, was synthesized in moderate yield based on the Stille cross-coupling reaction of compound 3 with the intermediate 7,7′-(4,4-dioctyl-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(4-bromo-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (dBr-ADA).
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the oligomers. 
All resulting oligomers could be dissolved readily in common organic solvents, including dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, and chlorobenzene. The molecular structures of all the target oligomers were confirmed by high-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy (Fig. 1) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that all oligomers have excellent thermal stability, with 5% weight loss temperature (Td5%) higher than 340 °C (Table 1).

3.2. Optical properties

Fig. 2 illustrates the UV-vis absorption spectra of oligomers in a dichloromethane solution with a concentration of 2 × 10−5 mol L−1 and as thin films. The absorption spectra of these oligomers exhibited dual-band characteristics as typical D–A-type of conjugated chromophores, where the less intense high-energy band with a maximum absorbance (λmax) of 350–380 nm corresponded to the characteristic π–π* transition and the featureless low-energy absorbance attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition.12,22,30 The low-energy absorbance gradually shifted from 451 nm for DA to 596 nm for DADAD (Fig. 2a), indicating the greatly extended π-conjugation with the increased molecular size. A comparison of the absorption profiles of ADA and DAD in Fig. 2a demonstrated a 46 nm bathochromic shift for the DAD chromophore, and the molar absorptivity also increased from 18800 cm−1 M−1 of ADA to 23900 cm−1 M−1 of DAD, illustrating the higher delocalization of π-conjugation in the DAD chromophore. The highest molar absorptivity of 30800 cm−1 M−1 was realized for DADAD, which had the longest π-conjugation.
 Fig. 2  UV-vis spectra of oligomers in a dichloromethane solution (2 × 10−5 mol L−1) (a) and as thin films (b). 
The absorption profiles as thin films in Fig. 2b were normalized due to the variation of film thickness. One can observe the slight red-shift of ∼10 nm along with the broadening of the absorbance at long-wavelength band. It was also recognized that the absorption profile of ADA exhibited a much more pronounced bathochromic shift with the emergence of the fine structures at 559 nm, which can be attributed to aggregation in solid state due to the strong intermolecular interaction of the electron-withdrawing BT units. The optical band gaps, which was estimated from the absorption onset of the thin films, were in the range of 2.05–2.40 eV. Detailed optical properties data are summarized in Table 1.
3.3. Electrochemical properties and theoretical calculations
The electrochemical properties of the oligomers were investigated to elucidate the frontier molecular orbital energy levels. The measurements were carried out in a dichloromethane solution using 0.1 M n-tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.31 The CV characteristics of these oligomers are illustrated in Fig. 3 and the relevant data is summarized in Table 2. With respect to the reference, ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), the onsets of the oxidation potential (Eox) and reduction potential (Ered) of the oligomers were determined to be in the range, 0.17–0.51 V and −1.64 to −1.82 V, respectively. Assuming the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ to be −4.80 eV relative to the vacuum level, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (ELUMO) energy levels can be calculated using the equation of EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.80) eV and ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.80) eV, respectively.32 Accordingly, the calculated EHOMO and ELUMO of these oligomers were in the range, −5.31 to −4.97 eV and −3.16 to −2.98 eV, respectively. Note that with the elongation of the conjugated length, both EHOMO and ELUMO gradually converged to the conjugated DTS-BT based polymer.22,33 A similar situation also exists in other π-conjugated small molecule systems.18 The calculated electrochemical band gap was in the range, 1.80–2.33 eV.

To further understand the molecular orbital geometry and electrical properties of these small molecules, density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations were carried on the basis of the restricted B3LYP/6-311G(d) function using the Gaussian 09 package.34 To simplify the calculation, the alkyl side chains were replaced with methyl groups for all oligomers. Fig. 3b illustrates the calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of the resulting oligomers. It was realized that for all oligomers, the HOMO is delocalized along the π-conjugated architectures, while the LUMO is located mainly at the electron-deficient BT units. As anticipated, the calculated HOMO levels increased gradually while the LUMO levels decreased progressively with the elongation of the π-conjugation. The combination of these factors leads to gradually narrowed band gaps with the extension of π-conjugation, which is in good agreement with the measured optical and electrochemical results. The detailed calculated parameters are summarized in Table 2.
3.4. Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the resulting oligomers were investigated by fabricating solar cells with an inverted device structure of ITO/PFN-OX/oligomer:PCBM/MoO3/Al. The photoactive layer comprised oligomer:PCBM with an optimized weight ratio of 1:2. Here, a thin layer of poly[9,9-bis(6,6′-(N,N-diethylamino)hexyl)fluorene-alt-9,9-bis(3-ethyl(oxetane-3-ethyloxy)hexyl)-fluorene] (PFN-OX) was spin-casted on top of the ITO substrate, which can effectively decrease the work-function of ITO and facilitate electron-collection.26 The photovoltaic performances of the copolymers were measured under a simulated AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 4, and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3.

The initial organic solar cells measurements using PC61BM as the electron acceptor showed comparatively low performance, which exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the range of 0.31–0.63%. The replacement of PC61BM by PC71BM leads to slightly improved device performance in terms of the increased short circuit current (JSC). This can be attributed to the much stronger absorption of PC71BM in the visible region than PC61BM, which can compensate for the absorption valley of the polymers and is beneficial for improved efficiency.35 The best device performance was achieved based on DADAD:PC71BM as the photoactive layer, which showed a moderate PCE = 1.12% (VOC = 0.81 V, JSC = 4.70 mA cm−2, and FF = 30.1%). To confirm the photo-response and the accuracy of the JSC measurements, the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) were recorded, as shown in Fig. 4b. All devices exhibited a moderate EQE in the range, 400–750 nm, where the device based on DADAD showed a much higher EQE than the others. The integrals of the EQEs of all oligomers were in accordance with the JSC values.
3.5. Film morphology
To obtain insight into the influence of film morphology on the device performance, the surface topography of the oligomers:PC71BM films were measured by atomic force microscopy. The bulk heterojunction films were fabricated by spin-casting the oligomer:PC71BM on the top of the ITO/PFN-OX substrate, which followed exactly the same conditions as those for device measurements. Fig. 5 shows the surface topography of the oligomers:PC71BM films. From Fig. 5a one can clearly observe the rough morphology of DA:PC71BM with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.53 nm, where serious phase separation can be attributed to the relatively poor miscibility of the DA and PC71BM. As the film morphology plays a critical role in charge transport cross the bulk heterojunction films, the serious phase separation along with the coarse-grained features of DA:PC71BM are detrimental to the photovoltaic performance. In contrast, a much smoother topography was realized for the BHJ films of ADA:PC71BM (Fig. 5b) and DAD:PC71BM (Fig. 5c), which exhibited a comparable RMS of 0.41 and 0.61 nm, respectively. The improved surface morphology indicated better miscibility with PC71BM, which was positive for charge carrier transportation in the relevant photovoltaic devices. The blend film of DADAD:PC71BM also exhibited a relatively smooth surface along with the emergence of percolating fibrous features across the whole film, which was favorable for charge transportation and could effectively reduce charge recombination and traps. Note that the performance of these resulting devices is relatively low, but these AFM images showed that the film morphology can be optimized by the molecular architecture, which can provide an effective hint for future molecular design.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a series of donor–acceptor type of conjugated oligomers comprising dithienosilole as the donor unit and benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit were synthesized via a Stille coupling reaction. Despite these oligomers containing the same donor and acceptor moieties along the conjugated architectures, they were structurally different in terms of the ratio of the donor or acceptor segments, resulting in significantly different absorption spectra, frontier molecular orbitals, and phase separation of the bulk-heterojunction films. Organic solar cells fabricated on the basis of these chromophores exhibited moderate power conversion efficiencies, in which the device based on the higher molecular weight oligomer exhibited superior performance to its lower molecular weight counterparts. The results showed that the extending π-conjugation of chromophores can be an effective molecular design strategy for achieving improved photovoltaic performance.
