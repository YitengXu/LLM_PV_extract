    , Accepted 28th July 2016First published on 1st August 2016AbstractFor the first time a ZnO nanorod-based Z-scheme heterostructure system was proposed and realized for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting. The samples were prepared by depositing a thin layer of SnO2 on the Au surface of Au particle-decorated ZnO nanorods. For ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods, the embedded Au can mediate interfacial charge transfer by promoting electron transfer from the conduction band of SnO2 to the valence band of ZnO. This vectorial charge transfer resulted in the situation that the photoexcited electrons accumulated at ZnO while the photogenerated holes concentrated at SnO2, giving ZnO–Au–SnO2 substantially high redox powers. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra suggested that the interfacial charge transfer across the ZnO/Au/SnO2 interface was significantly improved as a result of the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. With the substantially high redox powers and significantly improved interfacial charge transfer, ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods performed much better as a photoanode in photoelectrochemical water splitting than pristine ZnO, plasmonic Au-decorated ZnO and type-II SnO2-coated ZnO nanorods did. The present study has provided a viable approach to exploit Z-scheme photoanodes in the design of efficient artificial photosynthesis systems for solar energy conversion.
Introduction
Because of the limited supply of fossil fuels on Earth, considerable research efforts have been devoted to exploiting renewable, sustainable energy sources.1 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting using semiconductor electrodes is one of the most attractive renewable energy technologies, which could provide an inexhaustible, cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to address the issues of fossil fuel shortage. The concept of PEC water splitting for hydrogen production was first demonstrated in 1972 by Fujishima and Honda.2 Up to now, various types of semiconductor photoelectrodes have been proposed for conducting PEC water splitting. Metal oxides such as TiO2,3–5 ZnO,6–8 Cu2O,9,10 Fe2O3,11,12 and WO313,14 are particularly appealing by virtue of their favourable attributes including appropriate band structure, high chemical stability, low cost as well as natural abundance. However, it is difficult for metal oxides alone to satisfy all the requirements for achieving efficient PEC water splitting. Recent efforts have been directed toward the development of photoelectrodes based on semiconductor heterostructures.15–20 Owing to the inherently high degree of complexity, heterostructures may exhibit superior synergistic properties that are improbable to acquire from their individual constituents. Since the merits of each component can be incorporated, semiconductor heterostructures offer an optimal configuration for constructing a practical PEC system.
As inspired by the natural photosynthesis,21–24 semiconductor heterostructures with the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism have been regarded as the ideal photocatalyst platform for realizing overall water splitting. The Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism involves a two-step photoexcitation process, in which two individual semiconductors respectively perform the reduction and oxidation reactions with the aid of an electron shuttle. As a representative example, an all-solid-state Z-scheme CdS–Au–TiO2 nanojunction demonstrated a high photocatalytic activity far exceeding the individual constituents and binary counterparts.25 For a CdS–Au–TiO2 nanojunction, the embedded Au acted as a carrier transfer mediator to promote electron transfer from TiO2, through Au and then to CdS. Such a vectorial charge transfer led to a superior charge separation that the photogenerated holes concentrated at TiO2 while the photoexcited electrons accumulated at CdS, providing the nanojunction with strong oxidation and reduction powers for boosting photocatalytic efficiency. In addition to Au, reduced graphene oxide may also function as a solid-state electron shuttle to mediate vectorial charge transfer, which was utilized to cooperate with BiVO4 and Ru/SrTiO3:Rh to achieve Z-scheme overall solar water splitting.26 Note that most of the previously reported Z-scheme heterostructure photocatalysts were prepared in powder form, which conducted either photocatalytic water splitting26–31 or pollutant photodegradation.17,32–38 Regarding the realization of PEC water splitting, there were however very few attempts at employing Z-scheme semiconductor heterostructures as photoelectrodes. In fact, the Z-scheme charge transfer scenario is preferable to perform PEC water splitting since the charge transfer kinetics can be effectively improved as a result of the substantially high redox powers. Hence, the development of Z-scheme heterostructure photoelectrodes is practically essential.
For PEC water splitting, ZnO possesses favourable band structure with the conduction band edge (ECB = −0.2 V vs. NHE) being more negative than the hydrogen evolution potential and the valence band edge (EVB = +3.0 V vs. NHE) being more positive than the oxygen evolution potential.39 However, the large bandgap of ZnO (Eg = 3.2 eV) restricts its utility to the UV region alone. How to enable visible light absorption as well as enhance carrier utilization is therefore the research focus for pushing forward the advancement of ZnO. Decoration of plasmonic metal nanoparticles, such as Au, Ag and Cu, has been demonstrated to be an efficient approach to enhance the PEC performance of ZnO.40–44 Because of the unique features of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), generation of additional charge carriers as well as magnification of localized electric field could be acquired, both of which are beneficial for enhancing the photoactivity of ZnO electrodes. On the other hand, significant performance enhancement of ZnO photoelectrodes can also be achieved by introducing another semiconductor with appropriate band alignment. Typical examples included CuO–ZnO p–n heterostructures45 and ZnO–CdS core–shell nanowires,46 in which the introduced low-bandgap semiconductor could sensitize ZnO to visible light and meanwhile promote effective charge separation, consequently leading to the superior PEC performance. These developments have witnessed an intense demand for structurally and electronically modifying ZnO photoelectrodes in order to reach the criteria of conducting PEC solar water splitting.
Here we demonstrated the use of ZnO–Au–SnO2 heterostructure nanorods as the Z-scheme photoanode for efficient PEC water splitting, which is the first example of employing Z-scheme heterostructure photoelectrodes in the PEC system. The samples were prepared by depositing a thin layer of SnO2 on the Au surface of Au particle-decorated ZnO nanorods. For ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods, the embedded Au can serve as a carrier transfer mediator to promote electron transfer from the conduction band of SnO2 to the valence band of ZnO. This vectorial charge transfer resulted in hole accumulation at the valence band of SnO2 and electron concentration at the conduction band of ZnO. The accumulated holes at SnO2 possess high oxidation power (EVB = +4.3 V vs. NHE)39 and can readily perform the oxygen evolution reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface. On the other hand, the concentrated electrons at ZnO are highly reductive (ECB = −0.2 V vs. NHE), which can transfer to the counter electrode and effectively drive hydrogen production. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out to explore the interfacial charge dynamics for the as-prepared ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods. The PEC properties for relevant samples including pristine ZnO, plasmonic Au-decorated ZnO, type-II SnO2-coated ZnO and Z-scheme ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods were compared and interpreted in terms of the distinct charge transfer scenarios.
Experimental
Preparation of ZnO nanorod arrays
To prepare ZnO nanorods, a 90 nm-thick seed layer was first deposited on the indium–tin-oxide (ITO) glass substrates by sputtering the ZnO target. The growth of ZnO nanorods was then performed by using the hydrothermal method.47 In the typical procedure, Zn(NO3)2 (30 mL, 0.05 M) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) (30 mL, 0.05 M) aqueous solutions were thoroughly mixed and transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave (100 mL capacity), where the ZnO-seeded ITO substrates (1 cm × 1 cm) were vertically placed. The sealed autoclave was heated at 95 °C for 2 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature. This process resulted in the uniform growth of ZnO nanorods on the ITO substrate. The ZnO nanorod arrays were then rinsed with deionized water and ethanol to remove the remaining reactants and impurities.
Preparation of ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods
The decoration of Au particles on ZnO nanorods was carried out using a chemical reduction method.48 Firstly, the ITO substrate grown with ZnO nanorod arrays was immersed in the reaction solution containing 60 mL of deionized water and 30 mL of ethanol. Afterwards, 35 μL of HAuCl4 solution (10 mM) was injected into the reaction solution, followed by the addition of 80 μL of NaOH solution (0.5 M). After being stirred at 50 °C for 3 h, the substrate with Au-decorated ZnO nanorods (denoted as ZnO–Au) was taken out, washed and then dried under vacuum for later use. Further deposition of SnO2 was achieved using a photodeposition approach. Briefly, the substrate grown with ZnO–Au was vertically immersed in the SnCl2 alcoholic solution (40 mL, 0.1 mM) under vigorous stirring at 60 °C. After adding NaOH solution (50 μL, 0.5 M), the reaction solution was irradiated with a xenon lamp (500 W, with a light intensity of 1 W cm−2), which was normally incident upon the substrate surface, for 3 h. Upon reaction completion, the substrate grown with ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods was washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 80 °C in air for later characterization. In this work, various concentrations of SnCl2 alcoholic solution (0.05, 0.1, 0.2 mM) were employed to produce ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods with different SnO2 contents. The thus-obtained samples were respectively denoted as ZnO–Au–SnO2-1, ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 and ZnO–Au–SnO2-3. From the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis, the content of SnO2 for the three Z-scheme samples was determined to be 8.00, 9.10 and 10.00 wt%, respectively. The content of Au was measured to be 3.70 wt%. For comparison purpose, type-II SnO2-coated ZnO nanorods (denoted as ZnO–SnO2) and a pure SnO2 electrode were also prepared by conducting the photodeposition of SnO2 on pristine ZnO nanorods and a bare ITO substrate, respectively.
Site-selective deposition of PbO2 and Pd
The photodeposition of PbO2 and Pd on the selective sites of ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods was carried out according to a previous report with slight modifications.38 To deposit PbO2 on the SnO2 surface of ZnO–Au–SnO2, the ITO substrate with ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 was vertically immersed in 10 mL of deionized water, followed by the addition of a Pb(NO3)2 (400 μL, 0.01 M) solution in the dark. The reaction solution was then irradiated with a xenon lamp (500 W, with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2) normally incident upon the substrate surface at room temperature for 5 h. For the deposition of Pd on the ZnO surface, H2PdCl4 (60 μL, 0.037 M) was used as the Pd source and the same procedure as that mentioned above was applied.
PL lifetime measurements
Time-resolved PL spectra were recorded using a home-built single photon counting system. A picosecond pulsed diode laser (λ = 375 nm, PicoQuant, LDH-P-C-375) with the pulse FWHM of less than 40 ps was used as the excitation source. The signals collected at the excitonic emission of eosin Y (denoted as EY) (λem = 516 nm) were dispersed with a grating spectrometer, detected by a high-speed photomultiplier tube, and then correlated using a single photon counting card. Here, EY was used as an indicator dye to monitor the interfacial charge dynamics of ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods. Upon laser excitation, the photoexcited electrons of EY were injected into ZnO nanorods due to the higher lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) potential of EY than the conduction band potential of ZnO,49 which led to a significant quenching on the PL of EY. By comparing the emission decay profile between EY and ZnO nanorod-containing EY (denoted as EY/ZnO), the electron transfer from EY to ZnO nanorods can be quantitatively determined. Further spectral comparison of EY/ZnO, EY/Au, and EY/ZnO–Au samples may reveal the electron transfer event between ZnO and Au for ZnO–Au nanorods. The emission decay data were analysed with a biexponential model to generate two lifetime values, τ1 and τ2, and the corresponding amplitudes, A1 and A2. The intensity-average lifetime, <τ>, was then determined to make an overall comparison. All the fitting results are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
Characterization
The morphology and dimensions of the samples were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-6500) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, JEM-3000). The elemental analysis was conducted with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS, an accessory of JEM-3000) and ICP-MS (Agilent, 7500ce). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a VG Scientific Microlab 350 using Al Kα radiation under high vacuum conditions. For steady-state PL spectroscopy, a Hitachi F-4500 equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp was used. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi U-3900H spectrophotometer. Both emission and absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature under an ambient atmosphere. The PEC measurements were conducted using a three-electrode cell, which consists of a Pt counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and the 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The as-deposited samples on the ITO substrate were used as the working electrode within the PEC cell. The data were obtained using an electrochemical station under white light illumination (xenon lamp, 100 mW cm−2). The photocurrent action spectra were collected under the illumination of a xenon lamp coupled with a monochromator. The actual hydrogen production experiment was performed in the PEC cell under white light illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a constant bias of +0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. During the measurement, the electrolyte was constantly purged with argon gas to expel the dissolved oxygen. The hydrogen evolution on the counter Pt electrode was monitored by collecting the evolved gas with water displacement. The collected gas was then analysed with gas chromatography (GC; Bruker SCION, 463-MS) to quantify the hydrogen amount.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(A) presents the SEM image of the pristine ZnO nanorods on the ITO substrate. The partially aligned nanorods had a typical diameter of 50–80 nm and a length of up to 1 μm. After being reacted with HAuCl4 in the chemical reduction process, the ZnO nanorods were decorated with a large quantity of Au particles. As shown in Fig. 1(B), the decorated Au particles had a size of 5–10 nm and were uniformly distributed on the nanorod surface with a density of around 5.9 × 1014 particles per μm2. Further deposition of SnO2 on the Au surface of ZnO–Au nanorods was achieved with a delicate photodeposition approach. For ZnO–Au nanorods, the band offset between ZnO and Au effectuated preferential electron transfer from ZnO to Au. The electron-charged state of Au for ZnO–Au nanorods under light illumination can facilitate the approach of Sn2+ ions toward the Au surface through the electrostatic interaction. The growth of SnO2 was achieved in a typical hydrolysis–precipitation process.50,51 With the addition of NaOH, the Sn2+ was hydrolysed to Sn(OH)2. Upon reacting with the dissolved O2, the intermediate hydroxides can be further dehydrated to produce SnO2. Since the electron-charged Au surface of ZnO–Au nanorods may provide active sites for Sn2+ binding, the subsequent growth of SnO2 could mostly occur at the Au surface, resulting in the formation of ZnO–Au–SnO2 Z-scheme heterostructures. Fig. 1(C)–(E) show the SEM images of ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods with three different SnO2 contents, 8.00, 9.10 and 10.00 wt%. The nanorod surface of the three samples was characterized by noticeable particle decoration, but nonetheless their microstructural features were indistinguishable due to the resolution limitation of SEM.

The detailed microstructures and compositional information of ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods were then analysed by TEM and TEM-EDS. Fig. 2 displays the TEM observations on ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods with increasing SnO2 contents. Evidently, a hemi-spherical layer with a considerably tiny thickness was deposited on the Au surface. The HRTEM image taken at the Au surface clearly revealed two distinct sets of lattice fringes, which can be respectively assigned to fcc Au and tetragonal SnO2. The TEM-EDS analysis showed that the deposited layer was composed of Sn and O. The XPS analysis of Fig. 3 further confirmed the formation of SnO2 in the photodeposition process. In Fig. 3, the Sn 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 peaks at 494.7 and 486.3 eV acquired before photodeposition can be identified as the Sn2+ state of SnCl2. After the photodeposition reaction, the two peaks shifted to 495.3 and 486.9 eV, which is ascribed to the formation of SnO2 in the product. This result, together with the findings from TEM and TEM-EDS, confirmed the successful deposition of SnO2 on the Au surface of ZnO–Au nanorods by using the photodeposition method. Note that the structural feature that SnO2 was selectively deposited on the Au surface of ZnO–Au was vital for realizing the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. For ZnO–Au–SnO2-1 and ZnO–Au–SnO2-2, exclusive growth of SnO2 on the Au surface was achieved, although the grown SnO2 appeared non-uniform and did not fully cover the whole Au surface in ZnO–Au–SnO2-1. Special attention should be paid to the ZnO–Au–SnO2-3 sample, in which SnO2 was not only deposited on the Au surface but also grown on the ZnO nanorods. As Fig. 2(C) reveals, such a structural variance may, to some extent, change the charge transfer kinetics and thereby affect the PEC performance, as will be discussed later.

UV-visible absorption and PL spectroscopy were utilized to determine the optical properties of the samples. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4(A) that the five relevant samples exhibited a steep absorption onset at around 375 nm, which was attributed to the bandgap absorption of ZnO. Besides, a noticeable absorption shoulder at 400–480 nm was present, ascribable to the scattering effect of the nanorod structure.45 For ZnO–Au and ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods, an additional absorption band at 500–550 nm was recorded. This visible absorption was assigned to the SPR effect of the decorated Au particles.52,53 In Fig. 4(B), the steady-state PL spectra displayed a major emission peak at 375 nm, a typical radiative band-to-band emission of ZnO, and a minor emission band at 550 nm, which derived from the defect-associated electronic transitions.52,54 Compared with pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au nanorods exhibited substantially depressed PL at both excitonic UV and defect-related green emissions. The enhanced charge separation rendered by the Au decoration may account for the observed UV emission depression.52,55 On the other hand, the quenching of green emission can be traced to the passivation effect,52 in which the decorated Au could passivate the surface states or structural defects for ZnO to inhibit the defect-related electronic transitions. For the three ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods, a much more significant decay of PL emission was noticed, suggesting increasingly pronounced charge separation for ZnO–Au–SnO2 as is demonstrated for the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism.

To further depict the charge transfer events within the samples, time-resolved PL measurements were carried out. Here, an indicator dye of EY was used to explore the charge carrier dynamics of the ZnO nanorod-based samples. As a core of the dye-sensitized solar cell system, EY/ZnO hybrid films have been widely studied and performed as a sensitized photoelectrode.56–58 Upon light absorption, the EY molecules can be promoted into an excited state, from where an ultrafast electron injection into the conduction band of ZnO takes place. Since the LUMO potential of EY (−0.92 V vs. NHE)59 is higher than the conduction potential of ZnO (−0.2 V vs. NHE), the photoexcited electrons of EY would preferentially transfer to ZnO, leading to the depletion of free electrons for EY, accompanied by a significant PL quenching. The variation of the PL decay kinetics of EY can thus provide insightful information for depicting the fate of charge carriers as well as interpreting the mechanism of charge transfer. Fig. 4(C) shows the time-resolved PL spectra of EY in the presence of different samples. When pristine ZnO nanorods were dispersed in EY solution (the sample was denoted as EY/ZnO), the PL decay kinetics of EY became faster, which was a clear sign of electron transfer from EY to ZnO. The emission decay profiles were fitted with a biexponential model to derive two decay components and an intensity-average lifetime. As summarized in Table S1 (ESI†), EY/ZnO exhibited a reduced PL emission lifetime of 10.01 ns relative to pure EY (<τ> = 11.27 ns). Assuming that electron transfer from EY to ZnO dominated the PL lifetime shortening of EY, we could calculate the charge transfer rate constant by using the expression kct (EY → ZnO) = 1/<τ> (EY/ZnO) − 1/<τ> (EY), approximately 0.11 × 108 s−1. For the EY solution that contained ZnO–Au nanorods (the sample was denoted as EY/ZnO–Au), the average lifetime (<τ> = 8.31 ns) was found to be shorter than the value of EY/ZnO. This outcome was mainly attributed to the further electron transfer from ZnO to Au. When Au was present on the ZnO surface, the photoexcited electrons of EY may further transfer to Au through the ZnO/Au interface since Au has a much lower Fermi level (+0.60 V vs. NHE).60 This phenomenon caused a higher extent of free electron depletion for EY, which was responsible for the more significant PL lifetime shortening of EY. By comparing the average lifetime of EY between EY/ZnO–Au and EY/ZnO and deducting the contribution of charge transfer from EY to Au, we obtained kct (ZnO → Au) to be 0.20 × 108 s−1. When ZnO–Au–SnO2-1 nanorods were tested, the shortening of EY emission lifetime became more noticeable (<τ> = 3.52 ns), inferring that the charge transfer across the ZnO/Au/SnO2 interface was more pronounced. By using a similar calculation method, kct (ZnO → Au → SnO2-1) was determined to be 1.78 × 108 s−1. Note that this value was one order of magnitude higher than kct (ZnO → Au), signifying that the charge transfer across the ZnO/Au/SnO2 interface was more efficient than the charge transfer from ZnO to Au, as is expected for the Z-scheme mechanism.38,61 It is important to stress that the charge transfer mechanism across the ZnO/Au/SnO2 interface contrasted with the charge transfer model of ZnO–Au in terms of the carrier transfer pathway. For ZnO–Au–SnO2, the embedded Au may function as a carrier transfer mediator to encourage charge transfer from SnO2, through Au and finally to ZnO, whereas a unidirectional charge transfer pathway from ZnO to Au was considered for ZnO–Au. Such a vectorial charge transfer scenario for ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods can be validated by performing site-selective photodeposition experiments.25,38,62 Under light illumination, the nanorod body of ZnO–Au–SnO2 was charged with photoexcited electrons, while the SnO2 layer was enriched with photogenerated holes. The holes concentrated at SnO2 were highly oxidative and could drive an oxidation reaction, which can be examined by carrying out the photooxidation of Pb2+ ions. As revealed in Fig. 5(A), PbO2 particles were solely grown on the SnO2 surface upon the photooxidation of Pb2+. This observation showed that Pb2+ ions could be selectively oxidized on the SnO2 surface of ZnO–Au–SnO2 as a result of the Z-scheme charge transfer. On the other hand, the electrons accumulated at ZnO were readily available for a reduction reaction, which can participate in the photoreduction of Pd2+. As shown in Fig. 5(B), Pd particles were mostly deposited on the ZnO surface. This illustration, together with the result of PbO2 photodeposition, provided solid evidence for the Z-scheme mechanism.

Another conspicuous feature of Fig. 4(C) was that the three ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods behaved differently during the charge dynamics course of EY. As noted in Table S1 (ESI†), when ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 was examined, the emission lifetime of EY further decreased to 2.26 ns, corresponding to a kct value of 3.36 × 108 s−1. The increase of kct for ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 can be understood from the fact that the grown SnO2 fully covered the whole Au surface, which ensured high structural integrity to adequately actualize the Z-scheme mechanism. As to the ZnO–Au–SnO2-3 sample, the probe EY showed instead a lengthened emission lifetime of 4.48 ns, suggesting that charge transfer across the ZnO/Au/SnO2 interface became decreasingly effective. The corresponding kct was estimated to be 1.12 × 108 s−1. The decrease of kct for ZnO–Au–SnO2-3 can be traced to the structural variance that SnO2 was not only deposited on the Au surface but also grown on the ZnO nanorods. The direct growth of SnO2 on ZnO may give rise to a typical type-II band alignment, which could compete with the Z-scheme mechanism and thereby moderate the effectiveness of interfacial charge transfer.
To demonstrate the promise for practical use, the present ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods were employed as the photoanode to perform electrolytic water splitting. Particularly, the Z-scheme mechanism in which the photogenerated holes were accumulated at SnO2 with considerably high oxidation power (+4.30 V vs. NHE) was propitious for promoting the water splitting efficiency. Fig. 6(A) shows a set of linear sweep voltammograms recorded on pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au and the three ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods in the dark and under white light illumination. For comparison purpose, two-component ZnO–SnO2 nanorods were also prepared and tested. The dark scans exhibited a fairly low current density (about 10−7 A cm−2), suggesting that these ZnO nanorod-based electrodes were quite stable as immersed in the electrolyte. Significantly, all the heterostructure samples displayed larger photocurrent densities than pristine ZnO, reaffirming the indispensable structural engineering strategy for developing efficient photoelectrodes toward PEC applications. Furthermore, a more negative onset potential of water oxidation was noticed for the heterostructure samples, implying that less energy was required to drive the water splitting reaction on account of the improved charge transfer kinetics. Fig. 6(B) further presents the corresponding chronoamperometric I–t curves recorded under chopped light illumination at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. All the electrodes were prompt in generating photocurrents with a reproducible response over repeated on/off cycles of light illumination, revealing the high stability of the samples during the water splitting process. Among the different samples tested, ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 displayed the highest photocurrent generation of water oxidation, substantially higher than the performance of ZnO–Au and ZnO–SnO2. Note that ZnO–Au and ZnO–SnO2 nanorods respectively represented the plasmonic63 and type-II17 semiconductor heterostructure systems that have been widely adopted in PEC processes. The superiority of ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 over these two-component heterostructure counterparts illustrated the advantageous feature of the Z-scheme mechanism in PEC water splitting. However, it should be mentioned that ZnO–Au–SnO2-3 exhibited dramatically depressed photocurrent generation as compared to ZnO–Au–SnO2-2. This performance decrease was believed to be a consequence of the structural variance that SnO2 was not only deposited on the Au surface but also grown on the ZnO nanorods, as revealed in the TEM observations. The deposition of SnO2 on ZnO may give rise to a typical type-II band alignment which is also conducive to charge carrier separation. Although the ZnO–SnO2 electrode still showed notably enhanced photocurrent over pristine ZnO, it did not perform as well as the Z-scheme ZnO–Au–SnO2 did. In practice, the band alignment between ZnO and SnO2 did not favour electrolytic water splitting much in the current PEC configuration. For ZnO–SnO2 nanorods, a portion of the photoexcited electrons of ZnO would transfer to SnO2 due to the higher conduction band potential of ZnO (−0.2 V vs. NHE) than that of SnO2 (+0.5 V vs. NHE).39 Since the coated SnO2 was not in direct contact with the ITO substrate, the delocalized electrons at SnO2, despite being in a limited amount, could not transfer to the counter electrode for performing water reduction. As a result of this electron trapping issue, a mediocre water splitting efficiency was expected for ZnO–SnO2, which could account for the deteriorated PEC performance observed on ZnO–Au–SnO2-3. Furthermore, the photoconversion efficiency (η) of the three representative samples was evaluated according to the equation η = [I × (1.23 − V)]/Plight,64 where I is the photocurrent density at the measured potential, V is the applied potential vs. RHE, and Plight is the power density of incident light (100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 6(C), the ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 electrode exhibited a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 0.55%, substantially higher than pristine ZnO (0.10%) and ZnO–Au (0.47%).

To further elucidate the role of Z-scheme charge transfer in enhancing the photoactivity of ZnO, the photocurrent values at different illumination wavelengths were measured. Fig. 7(A) presents the photocurrent action spectra of three representative samples, pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au and ZnO–Au–SnO2-2. In comparison with pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au and ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 displayed increased photocurrent values across the 300–700 nm range, with ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 having a substantially larger increment, which was consistent with the results of PEC measurements. The incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) was also determined by dividing the measured photocurrent by the incident photon flux. At the incident light of 370 nm, the IPCE values of pristine ZnO, ZnO–Au and ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 were 0.37, 6.48 and 12.50%, respectively. Notably, the photocurrent enhancement of ZnO–Au and ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 was predominant in the UV region, suggesting that the introduction of Au and SnO2 mainly affected the charge carrier transfer of ZnO. The enhanced photoactivity of ZnO–Au could be attributed to two possible aspects. Firstly, the effective charge separation rendered by Au decoration improved the carrier utilization efficiency of ZnO, thus boosting the water oxidation performance. The significant PL emission quenching observed for ZnO–Au nanorods manifested the prevalence of effective charge separation. Secondly, the decorated Au may promote charge carrier generation of ZnO via the plasmonic effect. It has been believed that the SPR absorption can induce the magnification of electromagnetic field as well as the generation of hot electrons,63 both of which were beneficial to the photoactivity enhancement of ZnO. As shown in the inset of Fig. 7(a), both ZnO–Au and ZnO–Au–SnO2 exhibited notable visible photoactivity with the spectral feature matching with the SPR absorption of Au. This spectral accordance validated the effectiveness of the plasmonic effect and its involvement in enhancing the photoactivity of ZnO. On the other hand, for ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 nanorods, the remarkably enhanced photoactivity in the UV region was closely associated with the effectiveness of the Z-scheme mechanism. Under this vectorial charge transfer scenario, the photogenerated holes were accumulated at SnO2 with high oxidation power, which can readily drive the water oxidation reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Along with the significantly improved interfacial charge transfer as revealed in the carrier dynamics results, ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 surpassed plasmonic ZnO–Au and type-II ZnO–SnO2 in performing PEC water splitting. To evaluate the contribution from SnO2, a pure SnO2 electrode was also tested in the PEC cell. As Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows, a pure SnO2 electrode displayed a considerably low photocurrent density of a few nanoamperes, about three orders of magnitude smaller than the values of pristine ZnO and ZnO–Au. Since the contribution from SnO2 was negligible, the photocurrent enhancement of ZnO–Au–SnO2 in the UV region can be ascribed to the Z-scheme mechanism, which mainly improved the charge carrier transfer of ZnO. Based on the above interpretation, we proposed a plausible mechanism for the enhanced photoactivity of the Z-scheme ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods in Fig. 7(B). Under light illumination, both ZnO and SnO2 were excited to generate electron–hole pairs. The photoexcited electrons of SnO2 would transfer to Au and then to ZnO, recombining with the photogenerated holes of ZnO. The accumulated holes at SnO2 were highly oxidative and can readily perform oxygen evolution reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Meanwhile, the concentrated electrons at ZnO were highly reductive, which then transferred to the counter electrode to efficiently drive hydrogen production. Furthermore, the embedded Au may function as a plasmonic light harvester to give ZnO noticeable visible photoactivity, which is conducive to promoting the water splitting efficiency as well. To estimate the realistic applicability of ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods, we monitored the hydrogen evolution on the counter Pt electrode. As shown in Fig. S2(A) (ESI†), vigorous hydrogen evolution at the Pt surface could be recognized with the naked eye. The hydrogen production rate obtained at ZnO–Au–SnO2-2 was 1.20 μmol h−1, substantially higher than the 0.33 μmol h−1 from pristine ZnO. This illustration revealed that the present ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods can practically perform PEC water splitting to realize solar hydrogen production. The sustained chemical stability was another important attribute which needed to be considered for practical photoelectrodes. To evaluate the long-term stability, the sample was characterized with XPS before and after the hydrogen production operation. As is evident from Fig. S2(C) (ESI†), no appreciable change in the binding energy of Zn 2p was observed upon 6 h of operation, suggesting the high chemical stability of ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods.

Conclusions
In conclusion, ZnO–Au–SnO2 nanorods as the Z-scheme photoanode for PEC water splitting have been demonstrated. Time-resolved PL data suggested that the interfacial charge transfer across the ZnO/Au/SnO2 interface was significantly improved as a result of the Z-scheme mechanism. As compared to pristine ZnO, plasmonic ZnO–Au and type-II ZnO–SnO2, the Z-scheme ZnO–Au–SnO2 photoanodes exhibited superior performance toward PEC water oxidation. The origin of this superiority lies in the effective function of vectorial Z-scheme charge transfer at the interface of ZnO–Au–SnO2 with Au as the mediator. The demonstrations from this work may facilitate the use of Z-scheme photoanodes in various PEC applications, e.g. the PEC sensors65 and PEC fuel cells,66 in which the high redox powers and efficient interfacial charge dynamics of the Z-scheme mechanism can be well employed.
