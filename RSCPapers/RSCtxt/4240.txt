    , Accepted 26th March 2020First published on 27th March 2020AbstractThe oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in the water splitting process and a high energy conversion efficiency is essential for the definitive advance of hydrogen-based technologies. Unfortunately, the green and sustainable development of electrocatalysts for water oxidation is nowadays a real challenge. Herein, a successful mechanochemical method is proposed for the synthesis of a novel hemoglobin (Hb) modified Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite nanomaterial. The controlled incorporation of cobalt entities as well as Hb functionalization, without affecting the g-C3N4 nanoarchitecture, was evaluated using different physicochemical techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, N2-physisorption, scanning electron microscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The beneficial effect of the resulting ternary bioconjugate together with the influence of the temperature and light irradiation was investigated by electrochemical analysis. At 60 °C and under light exposition, this electrocatalyst requires an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA·cm−2, showing a Tafel slope of 66 mV·dec−1 and outstanding long-term stability for 600 OER cycles. This work paves a way for the controlled fabrication of multidimensional and multifunctional bio-electrocatalysts.
1. Introduction
The anthropogenic climate change together with the depletion of fossil fuels has motivated the rapid progress of hydrogen-based technologies, such as fuel cells and as carrier energy storage for harnessing renewable sources.1–3 However, the future global application of these green and sustainable energy technologies requires the development of low-cost, efficient and durable electrocatalysts for electrochemical processes. For instance, the simplest method for solar to chemical energy conversion is water splitting, which involves the chemical breakdown of water into oxygen and hydrogen. These anodic and cathodic processes are known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Although both need electrocatalysis, the OER requires a higher theoretical overpotential of 1.23 V to provide a suitable current.4–7
Recently, transition-metal based electrocatalysts have emerged as an interesting alternative to the classical noble metals (e.g. Pt for the HER and RuO2/IrO2 for the OER).8–11 Among all these chemical elements, cobalt-based materials have been extensively investigated for water oxidation through different approaches, including oxides,12,13 hydroxides,14,15 chalcogenides,16 carbides,17 nitrides,18 silicates,19 phosphides,20,21 alloys,22,23etc., to name only a few. Another interesting strategy is focused on cobalt-supported onto conducting carbonaceous composite materials, such as graphene,24 carbon nanotubes,25,26 and their nitrogen-derivatives.27,28 The latter approximations provide not only an enhanced OER electrocatalytic performance but also a substantial reduction of the total cobalt content.
Inspired by all these approaches and considering that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a well-known metal-free electrocatalyst for the HER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),29–32 Wang et al.33 and Zhu et al.34 have recently reported two different Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite materials (i.e. Co3O4/g-C3N4 supported on N-doped graphene-42.9%Co3O4@g-C3N4/NG- and Co3O4 supported on phosphorus-doped g-C3N4-60%Co3O4/P-C3N4-, respectively) as efficient electrocatalysts for the OER, demonstrating the enormous potential of this type of inorganic–organic hybrid combination. In the same direction, herein we propose a mechanochemical-assisted method to fabricate a novel multifunctional inorganic–organic biocomposite, which uses hemoglobin (Hb) as an alternative material for reducing to 10% the amount of Co3O4 in the Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite. Hb is a tetrameric redox protein formed by four polypeptide chains in which each polypeptide domain encloses at least one iron active redox centre that provides both a hierarchical structure and porous framework to the whole. This redox protein has been previously reported by Compton et al.35 and Franco et al.36 as an outstanding electrocatalytic biomaterial for the ORR. Our characterization results demonstrate the beneficial effect between three components (i.e. g-C3N4, Co and Hb acting as a porous network, catalytic transition-metal and tertiary structure, respectively) and provide insights into the influence of the temperature and light irradiation on its electrocatalytic performance, paving a way for the rational design and easy fabrication of multidimensional and multifunctional electrocatalysts with desired performances for hydrogen-based technologies.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of materials
The graphitic carbon nitride material (g-C3N4) was obtained using a previously optimized protocol.37,38 g-C3N4 (Fig. 1A) was obtained by calcination of melamine (Sigma-Aldrich) in a semi-closed crucible at 580 °C for 2 hours and using a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The obtained g-C3N4 was subsequently modified following a mechanochemical protocol to obtain ternary catalytic systems with minor amounts of Co3O4 and hemoglobin (Hb). The preparation of Co3O4 species (pure reference and composites) was accomplished following a mechanochemical procedure at 350 rpm for 10 min. The binary samples (Co3O4/g-C3N4) were prepared employing the previously synthesized g-C3N4 and [Co(NO3)2·6H2O] as the cobalt precursor. Four materials, containing different Co concentrations (1, 2.5, 5 and 10 wt%), were prepared. The syntheses were performed in a Retsch PM100 ball mill, using a 125 mL reaction chamber and eighteen 10 mm stainless steel balls and the solid precursor was oven-dried at 100 °C for 24 h, and finally calcined at 400 °C for 2 h (5 °C min−1). As well-demonstrated before, this protocol allows one to obtain a dominant Co3O4 phase.39 The final deposition of the Hb (Horse hemoglobin) was carried out using also a mechanochemical protocol at 200 rpm for 10 min (Retsch PM100 ball mill, 50 mL reaction chamber and eight 10 mm stainless steel balls).
 Fig. 1  Images of the different synthesized materials: (A) g-C3N4, (B) X%Co/g-C3N4 and (C) 10%Co/g-C3N4-Hb. 
The bioconjugate was prepared using 500 mg of the active support (Co3O4/g-C3N4) and 50 mg of Hb in 300 μL of NaH2PO4 buffer (pH = 7).40 Both binary and ternary systems are displayed in Fig. 1. Sample names are X%Co/g-C3N4 for Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite materials and 10%Co/g-C3N4-Hb for the ternary systems modified with hemoglobin.
2.2. Characterization of materials
X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with a LynxEye detector and acquired in a 2θ scan range from 10° to 70°. Phase identification was accomplished with Bruker Diffrac-plus Eva software. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and porosity parameters were analyzed by N2 physisorption measurements (Micromeritics ASAP 2000 equipment). The morphology and elemental composition of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/X-ray energy dispersive spectra (EDX) analysis acquired with a JEOL-SEM JSM-7800 LV scanning microscope. XPS experiments were performed on 4 × 4 mm2 pellets in an ultrahigh vacuum multipurpose surface analysis instrument SpecsTM. The samples were outgassed overnight in a pre-chamber under vacuum (10−6 Torr) and the measurements were accomplished at room temperature using a conventional X-ray source with a Phoibos 150-MCD energy detector. XPS results were analyzed employing the XPS CASA software (version 2.3.15) and C 1s contribution was utilized as the energy calibration reference (284.6 eV). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy experiments were carried out using a LAMBDA 365 UV/Vis spectrophotometer and the data were processed employing the UV-Express software.
2.3. Electrochemical methods
Linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were recorded in a three-electrode electrochemical cell using a potentiostat/galvanostat instrument (AUTOLAB PGSTAT30). An aqueous solution of KOH 0.5 M was employed as the electrolyte. Ag/AgCl and Pt foil were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A glassy carbon (GC) disc of 5 mm in diameter (Pine Instruments Company) with a two-dimensional geometry was used as the working electrode, which was modified by drop-casting with 15 μL of an isopropanol:water 1:3 v/v dispersion of the different composite materials (4 mg mL−1). All electrochemical experiments were scanned in the potential range between 0.00 V and 0.80 V vs. Ag/AgCl, at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 and a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. All potentials were referenced to the RHE by adding a value of (0.205 + 0.059 × pH) V.41,42 Illumination experiments were performed with an ORIEL LSH-7320 Alba Led Solar Simulator lamp using an output power of 1.0 mW cm−2. The light source was placed 10 cm from the working electrode. 10%Co/g-C3N4-Hb and 10%Co/g-C3N4 based electrodes were characterized before and after the electrochemical OER by XPS analysis.
3. Results and discussion
Materials were prepared using a solvent-free (calcination/mechanochemistry) protocol (Scheme 1). Mechanochemical methods have broadly demonstrated their great applicability for nanomaterial design.43 A milling-assisted deposition of cobalt oxide nanoparticles (Co3O4 NPs) on the surface of the g-C3N4 material was successfully achieved. Fig. 2 shows representative TEM images of the 10%Co/g-C3N4 composite sample and its pure constituents (i.e. Co3O4 NPs and g-C3N4). Further modification of the obtained materials with hemoglobin was also efficiently performed by a mechanochemical protocol.

Operating conditions described in detail in the Experimental section allow us to obtain a dominant Co3O4 phase as well as the stable deposition of the bio-entity hemoglobin, both with potential in electro-catalytic applications.36 It is worth highlighting that solvent-free protocols and in particular mechanochemistry possess an inherent sustainable character, avoiding the use of solvents and additional reagents in the synthesis of the materials. As well, the aforementioned methodology is highly reproducible, versatile and simple, as well as allowing the preparation of a wide range of materials in short reaction times. Such advantages could motivate the scientific community to investigate the scalability and possible industrial applications of mechanochemistry.
The crystalline structures of the synthesized carbon nitrile material and post-modified samples have been studied by X-ray diffraction analysis as shown in Fig. 3. Pure g-C3N4 as well as binary (XCo/g-C3N4) and ternary (Co/g-C3N4-Hb) composite samples showed as dominant contributions the two characteristic peaks of g-C3N4 that appear at 13.1° and 27.4°, associated with the crystallographic planes (100) and (002), respectively.44–46 These data suggest that the crystalline structure of the g-C3N4 material has not been modified after the mechanochemical treatment or after the incorporation of Co and Hb species. As well, a small peak at 36.85° can be observed, associated with the crystallographic plane (311), which was not found in the g-C3N4 sample. Such a characteristic peak could be associated with Co3O4,47 therefore confirming the successful formation of Co3O4 species and the effective deposition of the cobalt counterpart on the g-C3N4 material. The textural properties of the samples were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption measurements and are shown in Table 1. The surface area of the g-C3N4 material was found to be in good accordance with the reported values in the literature.38,48–51 In addition, a decreasing trend of this property with the increment of the cobalt concentration was observed. Even if such a variation was small, it could indicate that cobalt oxide particles were partially blocking the pores of the g-C3N4 structure. On the other hand, it was observed that the incorporation of Hb had a negligible influence on the surface of the materials. In any case, the small differences detected after functionalization with Co and Hb strongly suggested that the textural properties are given by the main component (g-C3N4). The same conclusion can be deduced from the pore volume and the pore size data.

The optical properties of the synthesized materials were studied by UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4. The pure g-C3N4 presented the expected profile with absorption from UV to visible light and a bandgap value of 2.7 eV, which is in accordance with the expected profile for graphitic carbon nitride materials.50,51 Although some variation in the absorption edge of the composite samples (Co/g-C3N4) can be observed, the profile below 450 nm is dominated by the major g-C3N4 component, leading to band gap values in a range of 2.7–2.9 eV. Incorporation of the Co entities on the surface of the g-C3N4 caused an enhancement of the absorption above 450 nm. The broad contribution situated at ∼580 nm (inset) has been previously detected and associated with direct transitions at 1.45 eV, corresponding to O2− to Co3+ excitation charge transfer.52 The final modification with Hb resulted in small differences in comparison with the composite support (10%Co3O4/g-C3N4), with negligible variations of the bandgap and a decrease of the absorption band generated by the Co3O4 counterpart. Such a finding motivated the use of these materials as photo-electro-catalysts using a sunlight-type illumination source.

The chemical properties of the samples were also studied by XPS measurements. The XPS regions of carbon 1s (C 1s), nitrogen 1s (N 1s), oxygen 1s (O 1s) and cobalt 2p (Co 2p) of 10% Co/g-C3N4 and 10% Co/g-C3N4-Hb samples were acquired, as shown in Fig. S2.† It is important to note that very marked differences were detected in the C 1s region before and after the incorporation of Hb (Fig. S2A and S2E†). In both samples, the C 1s XPS region showed three contributions corresponding to C–C, C–N and C–O, located around 284.6, 287.2 and 288.9 eV, respectively. The enhancement of the intensity of the C–C and C–O contributions in the 10% Co/g-C3N4-Hb sample can be exclusively attributed to the incorporation of the protein on the surface of the material.53 In turn, in the sample 10% Co/g-C3N4-Hb, the peak located at 287.2 eV can be attributed to C–N bonds from structural moieties of g-C3N4,37,45 as well as from peptide bonds in the protein chains. The incorporation of Hb modified the final XPS spectra of C 1s, by overlapping contributions, without considerable structural distortion of the g-C3N4 sample.37,45 The deconvolution of the N 1s XPS region in both materials showed the presence of three bands around 398.7, 399.5 and 400.8 eV, which were attributed to C–N–C bonds, NH residues and π excitation in g-C3N4 based materials, respectively (Fig. S2B and S2F†). In particular, for the protein modified material, the peak located at 398.7 eV can also be associated with nitrogen from Hb peptide bonds.53 On the other hand, the XPS region of O 1s exhibited two contributions at 530.9 and 532.0 eV, which can be assigned to O–Co/O–O and O–C bonds, respectively (Fig. S2C and S2G†).53,54 The increased intensity of the O–C band (Fig. S2G†) may be related to the incorporation of the protein on the surface of the 10% Co/g-C3N4 material. Fig. S2D† and S2H show the Co 2p XPS region. Because of the relatively low variations of the binding energies from Co2+ to Co3+, it is difficult to precisely identify cobalt chemical environments in cobalt oxide materials.39,54 However, a dominant presence of Co3O4 is suggested based on the peak shapes of the spectra and the relatively low intensity of satellite peaks, characteristic of Co2+ in CoO species.39,54,55
The samples with the highest Co concentration were analysed by SEM mapping. The obtained micrographs are shown in Fig. S3A–K.† The presence of uniformly distributed carbon and nitrogen atoms could be observed. On the other hand, although some agglomerated areas are perceived in the oxygen and cobalt mapping images, it can be affirmed that cobalt oxide nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed over the surface of the g-C3N4 material. The 10%Co/g-C3N4-Hb sample was also analysed by SEM-mapping. The obtained results are shown in Fig. S3F–K.† In this case, the analysis revealed the presence of sulphur in the sample, most likely from the polypeptide chains of hemoglobin, particularly in methionine and cysteine amino acids.56
The electrocatalytic OER activity of the different synthesized composite materials and their constituent components was measured at room temperature according to the detailed conditions in the Experimental section. Fig. 5A shows their LSV plots, where a progressive increase of the OER activity of the different Co/g-C3N4 composites can be observed with the percentage of cobalt. Surprisingly, the 10%Co/g-C3N4 composite exhibits only a slightly lower OER activity than the 100%Co3O4 and RuO2 NP samples, indicating a favourable effect of the Co3O4 nanoparticles on the Co/g-C3N4 composite. In addition, the introduction of Hb into the 10%Co/g-C3N4 composite enhances significantly the resulting OER performance, which is even better than the one obtained for the 100%Co3O4 sample. This improvement can be attributed to the tertiary architecture of Hb with a hierarchical structure and its iron active redox centre. Table 2 summarises some of the most important OER electrocatalytic parameters, which further confirm the observations above.

Next, in order to improve the OER electrocatalytic performance of this tricomponent composite (i.e. 10%Co/g-C3N4-Hb), LSV measurements were carried out under light irradiation and at 60 °C (Fig. 5C). The finding shows that the temperature increase combined with the visible light-mediated photoexcitation improves significantly the OER electrocatalytic response, providing both the cathodic shift of the onset potential (from 1.54 to 1.51 V) and increase of the maximum current density (from 50 to 80 mA cm−2), while the Tafel slopes remained almost invariable as it can be observed in Fig. 5D. These results agree with the study reported by Zhang et al., who demonstrated an optimization of the HER activity of g-C3N4 through visible light irradiation.29 They also suggested that g-C3N4 was a stable semiconductor, whose band-gap covered both the water reduction and water oxidation potentials. On the other hand, compared to other Co-based electrocatalysts reported in the literature,7,57 our tricomponent composite material shows excellent properties as an OER electrocatalyst, requiring an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA·cm−2, and with a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec−1. The latter values are quite similar to the ones reported recently for a 60%Co3O4/g-C3N4 modified GC electrode,34 despite using a 50% higher amount of Co3O. In order to investigate the number of active sites (experimental details in the ESI†), the differences of anodic and cathodic current densities were plotted against several scan rates (Fig. S4†),58,59 obtaining slopes (areal capacitance) proportional to the number of active sites as well as to the electrochemical surface area of each sample. Our findings show that the 10%Co/g-C3N4 + Hb composite provides the highest areal capacitance of 2.54 mF cm−2, suggesting that the combination of graphitic carbon nitride networks and nanostructured cobalt oxide together with Hb tertiary architecture enables abundant active sites and thus significantly promotes the electrocatalytic activity of cobalt oxide. The latter effect could be attributed to the high degree of dispersion of active sites, promoting mass transport during electrocatalytic processes. According to the literature,60 the conventional mechanism for OER processes in alkaline medium is called the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), which consists of 5 steps with multiple adsorbed intermediates. Considering M our composite material, the proposed reaction mechanism could be:
(1) M + OH− ↔ M-OH* + e−
(2) M–OH* + OH− ↔ M–O* + H2O + e−
(3) M–O* + OH− ↔ M–OOH* + e−
(4) M–OOH* + OH− ↔ M-OO* + H2O + e−
(5) M–OO* ↔ M + O2
Finally, a durability test was carried out in order to assess the deterioration of its electrocatalytic performance after 600 chronoamperometric OER cycles. Fig. 5E shows that the percentage of the initial current density practically did not change after all these cycles. Fig. 5F shows the LSV curves obtained before and after the long-term stability study with the tricomponent composite material, further confirming the outstanding electrocatalytic behaviour for the OER. Post-characterization analysis of the 10%Co/g-C3N4 and 10%Co/g-C3N4-Hb based electrodes has been performed. XPS analysis of 10%Co/g-C3N4 and 10%Co/g-C3N4-Hb based electrodes, before and after the electrochemical reaction, was performed (Fig. S5, ESI†). The N1s XPS region is displayed in Fig. S5A† and in the four cases, the nitrogen signal could be deconvoluted into three main contributions around 398.5 eV, 399.7 eV and 400.8 eV, associated with C–N–C bonds, NH residues and π excitation in g-C3N4. Such results demonstrated that after the electrochemical reaction, no considerable changes occur either in the graphitic carbon nitride structure or in the protein network. Moreover, the O1s XPS region (Fig. S5B†) showed the presence of two main signals, which, as previously described, could be attributed to O–Co/O–O and O–C bonds, respectively. In this case, some changes could be observed after the electrochemical reaction, which could be associated with modifications in the cobalt oxide environments. These results were in agreement with the observed Co2p XPS region spectra (Fig. S5C†). In particular, the distance between Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 signals for the 10%Co/g-C3N4 sample was found to be 15.7 eV and 15.2 eV, before and after the reaction respectively, suggesting certain formation of metallic cobalt. A similar, but less marked behaviour was found for the 10%Co/g-C3N4-Hb based electrode, which could be most likely associated with the coverage of the cobalt oxide nanoparticle surface with protein entities.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated the excellent features provided by the mechanochemical method for the synthesis of a novel multidimensional and multifunctional bionanomaterial. The incorporation of small amounts of cobalt, as well as the functionalization with hemoglobin, was evaluated using different techniques such as XRD, N2-physisorption, SEM, UV-vis and XPS. As it was revealed by XRD and N2 adsorption–desorption, neither the incorporation of Co3O4 nor Hb altered the nanoarchitecture of the g-C3N4. Similarly, XPS analysis confirmed the maintenance of the native-like structure of this redox protein in the biocomposite. Finally, electrochemical analysis confirmed the outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the OER of the tricomponent bionanomaterial at 60 °C under light irradiation. This work opens a route for the development of novel composite biomaterials for diverse technological applications.
