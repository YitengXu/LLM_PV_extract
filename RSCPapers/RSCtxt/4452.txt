    , Accepted 8th December 2015First published on 10th December 2015AbstractFully conjugated donor–acceptor (D–A) block copolymers, P3HT-b-PBIT2, containing p-type poly(3-hexylthiophene) and n-type poly(pyrene bisimide) segments are synthesized in a one-pot reaction via Stille coupling polycondensation. Various D–A block copolymers with low polydispersities (1.17–1.54) are obtained through further separation by preparative GPC. The structural and molecular features of block copolymers are verified by 1H NMR, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-Vis absorption, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). It is found that optical and electrochemical properties of D–A block copolymers are strongly dependent on the combination ratio of the donor P3HT and acceptor PBIT2 segments. When the PBIT2 weight content increases, the absorption intensity of PBIT2 in D–A block copolymer fractions is enhanced simultaneously. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the block copolymers increase gradually with decreasing acceptor block lengths and are located between P3HT and PBIT2. All-polymer solar cells using the preparative GPC separated P3HT-b-PBIT2 (BCP1-1) as a single-component active layer, which shows mono-modal GPC curves and a comparatively balanced hole and electron mobility of 2.36 × 10−4 and 1.15 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, achieve a power conversion efficiency of 1.0% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.43 V, a short-current of 5.29 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.43.
Introduction
All-polymer solar cells continue to attract considerable attention in recent years because of their potential to supplant polymer/fullerene devices1–5 and because the polymer/polymer blends allow for covering the complementary parts of the solar spectrum by tuning the energy levels of each component.6 However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the all-polymer solar cells are generally lagging far behind those of the fullerene-based organic solar cells. One of the critical issues accounting for the poor efficiency is undesirable morphological characteristics of the polymer blends, such as poor crystallinity,7 inhomogeneous internal phase composition,8–10 and a large-scale phase separation.11–13 Controlling the phase separation is a key issue in all-polymer solar cells which limits the generation of free charge carriers and subsequently influences the device performance.14 The nanoscale phase-separated active layer with interpenetrating networks in solar cell devices may provide high interfaces which ensure efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.15–17 Diverse methods have been used to optimize nanoscale phase separation, including thermal annealing, solvent vapor annealing, and the use of processing additives.18–21 However, limited success has been achieved in all-polymer solar cells.22
Block copolymers consisting of covalently linked donor and acceptor blocks constitutionally prefer composition-dependent nanoscale phase separation.6,14,23–25 Phase-separated donor and acceptor block copolymers are expected to address current challenges in morphology manipulation.26 For example, our group previously reported that the all-conjugated block copolymer P3HT-b-PNDT films show significant fine structures and much smoother film morphologies than P3HT/PNDIT homopolymer blends.27 Hawker et al. also proposed a strategy for the synthesis of fully conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers P3HT-b-DPP, which provided a rich self-assembly behaviour with two separate crystalline domains.28 A power conversion efficiency of up to 3% was realized by using the P3HT-b-PFTBT block copolymer as an active layer, demonstrating efficient photo conversion well beyond devices composed of P3HT/PFTBT homopolymer blends.29 To date, research on the fully conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers has been rarely reported.27–36 A critical component in the execution of this approach is the choice of architecture for the D–A block copolymer. Ideally, the individual blocks of the D–A block copolymer should contain chromophoric units with appropriately aligned HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels to make it possible to elicit a photovoltaic response when the two materials are combined.37 Starting from these facts, several studies of D–A non-conjugated block copolymers comprising regioregular P3HT donor blocks and pyrene bisimide (PBI) acceptor blocks have been reported in which PBI is functionalized as a side chain hanging in the non-conjugated polyethylene backbone.37–44 P3HT is one of the most effective p-type materials used in solar cells; PBI is an n-type electron compound with an excellent electron mobility of up to 101–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1,45–50 and it also displays a favourable energy level offset with respect to that of P3HT, ensuring that photoinduced electron transfer can take place from the donor block to the acceptor block.51 Devices based on rrP3HT-b-poly(perylene bisimide acrylate) copolymers as single-component active layers in OPVs exhibited a PCE of 0.49%,38 while devices based on P3HT-b-PPerAcr which comprised of a P3HT donor block coupled to a poly(perylene bisimide acrylate) gave a PCE of 0.35%.42 Nevertheless, there has not been report on fully conjugated block copolymers with P3HT as donor blocks and PBI as acceptor blocks in which a conjugated linkage is connected through P3HT and PBI.
Herein, we present the synthesis, purification and characterization of all-conjugated block copolymers, comprising the P3HT donor and the PBIT2 acceptor block. After careful purification with preparative GPC, the structure, optical and electrochemical properties, and film morphologies of the newly purified fully conjugated copolymers have been investigated in detail. All-polymer solar cells using the purified P3HT-b-PBIT2 as a single-component active layer achieved a power conversion efficiency of 1.0% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.43 V, a short-current of 5.29 mA cm−2, and a fill factor of 0.43.
Experimental section
Materials
All reagents were purchased from Energy Chemical, Suna Tech Inc., Stream, Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. Reagent grade solvents used in this study were freshly dried using standard distillation methods, except N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) which was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Characterization

1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer. Elemental analyses of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen were performed on a Vario EL III microanalyzer. Number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) of all polymers were determined by Agilent Technologies 1200 series GPC running in chlorobenzene at 80 °C, using two PL mixed B columns in series, and calibrated against narrow polydispersity polystyrene standards. Preparative GPC utilized a Shimadzu recycling GPC system running in chlorobenzene at 80 °C, using an Agilent PL gel MIXED-D column, a DGU-20A3 Degasser, a LC-20A Pump, a CTO-20A Column Oven and a SPD-20A UV Detector. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2500 recording spectrophotometer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were performed on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a MCT detector. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with a solution of 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile, and the polymer film on a Pt plate as a working electrode, a platinum wire as an auxiliary electrode, and an Ag wire as a pseudo-reference electrode with ferrocenium–ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) as the internal standard. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted on SPA300HV in tapping mode using an SPI3800 controller, Seiko Instruments Industry, Co., Ltd. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) study of the samples is carried out on a Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer operating at 30 kV and 20 mA with a copper target (l = 1.54 Å) and at a scanning rate of 1° min−1.
Device fabrication and measurements
The polymer solar cells have a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS/actively layer/Ca/Al. Poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron P4083) was firstly spin-coated on the pre-cleaned ITO substrate to produce a 35 nm-thick anode buffer layer. The 85 nm thick active layer with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene solution was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The samples were then transferred into a vacuum evaporator and a cathode including 5 nm of Ca and 100 nm Al was thermally deposited on top of the active layer to produce an active area of 0.12 cm2 for each device. Devices with thermal annealing were carried out in a glove box at 150 °C for 10 min. The thicknesses of the polymer blend films were determined using a DEKTAK 6M Stylus profile meter (Bruker, Germany). The illuminated J–V characteristics of the solar cells were measured under a nitrogen atmosphere using a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source meter (Keithley Instruments Inc., USA) under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G simulated solar-light illumination. The light intensity was determined by a calibrated silicon diode with a KG-5 visible color filter. External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were determined at room temperature using a 75 W Xe lamp source as excitation light and a 150 W quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp (QE-R, Enli Technology Co. Ltd, Taiwan, China) for background illumination. Hole-only or electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au for holes and Al/active layer/Al for electrons. Mobilities were extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space charge limited current).

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
As outlined in Scheme 1, P3HT-Br was synthesized and purified following our previous report.27 The two new copolymers BCP1 and BCP2 were synthesized by Stille coupling polymerization of P3HT-Br, PBIBr2 and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene in good yields, using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst. After the reaction, the crude products were purified via Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, and chloroform in succession. The molecular weight and polydispersity of all polymers were measured by GPC with chlorobenzene as an eluent and calibrated against polystyrene standards. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of BCP1 and BCP2 were obtained to be 11.2 and 13.4 kg mol−1, with PDIs of 1.55 and 1.58, respectively. Both polymers were fully soluble in common chlorinated organic solvents at room temperature, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of block copolymer P3HT-b-PBIT2 in a one-pot reaction step. BCP1 and BCP2 were further purified via preparative GPC to obtain various D–A block copolymers with different Mn. 
However, this method is not flawless, contamination with P3HT homopolymers is feasible, and hence tedious purification is necessary. In order to obtain the low polydispersity block copolymers, BCP1 and BCP2 were further purified via preparative GPC with chlorobenzene as an eluent at 80 °C. Both block copolymers were separated into six to seven parts, and only the three effective segments (BCP1-1, BCP1-2, BCP1-3, BCP2-1, BCP2-2 and BCP2-3) for each BCP were chosen for further investigation, the detailed purification method can be found in previous report by Sommer et al.30 The molecular weight and polydispersity of all polymers are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 1 shows the GPC curves of all selected block copolymers obtained from BCP1 and BCP2. It is obvious that GPC curves of all fractions with low polydispersities are different from P3HT-1 in Fig. 1a and P3HT-2 in Fig. 1b. It should be noted that block copolymers were not purified effectively via preparative GPC. However, BCP1-1 and BCP2-1 show a sharp and monomodal profile, which is clearly shifted to shorter elution times compared to P3HT.

 Fig. 1  GPC analysis of various block copolymer fractions purified by preparative GPC, with P3HT chain lengths of (a) 16.9 and (b) 21.2 kg mol−1. 
According to the 1H NMR spectra of P3HT-Br and BCP1-1 (Fig. 2), two specific peaks matching the aromatic rings of PBIT2 were observed at 8.40 and 8.73 ppm. 1H NMR spectroscopy shows distinct resonances for both the P3HT and PBI units, and the disappearance of peaks at about 2.50 ppm results from the linkage between the bromo-chain end of the P3HT block and the PBIT2 segment.28,33 The P3HT weight ratio was determined by comparing the integral area of the branched chain peak (4.13 ppm) from the PBI and the branched chain peak (2.80 ppm) of P3HT, and could also be calculated from the integration of the aromatic rings of the PBIT2 and P3HT segment (i.e., δ 8.73 and 6.98). The weight ratio of P3HT was basically averaged by the branched chain and aromatic ring peak integral area. Thus various block copolymers with different P3HT weight ratios were investigated and summarized in Table 1, and further confirmed by FTIR spectra.

To access the structural and molecular characteristics of the block copolymers, and to further verify the weight ratio of P3HT in block copolymers calculated from 1H NMR spectra, FTIR was carried out. As shown in Fig. 3, the spectra of block copolymers P3HT-b-PBIT2 and P3HT/PBIT2 polymer blends are almost identical, with exactly similar absorption peaks and intensities because of the same chemical bonding component. From the fingerprint region for the two groups of block copolymers and polymer blends, it is found that their spectra overlap very well, indicating that the weight ratio of P3HT in block copolymers is similar to those in P3HT/PBIT2 polymer blends, respectively. The 1700 and 1663 cm−1 bands correspond to the CO symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching bands of PBI,52 and the ∼1510 cm−1 band corresponds to the CC stretching band of the main chain of polythiophene.53

Optical properties
UV-Vis absorption spectra of the synthesized block copolymers, P3HT and PBIT2 homopolymers in chloroform solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. 4 and related data are summarized in Table 2. In the dilute solution, all block copolymers exhibited similar absorption behaviour with a broad absorption in the visible regions. The absorption spectra of bock copolymers have demonstrated both of the P3HT and PBIT2 absorption features and are almost the overlap of the two component, indicating the deficit of ground state electronic interactions as expected.54 Obviously, the absorption intensity depends on the chain length of the donor P3HT and the acceptor PBIT2 segment. When the PBIT2 weight content increases, the absorption intensity of PBIT2 in D–A block copolymer fractions is gradually enhanced simultaneously.

In the film state, all bock copolymers exhibit similar absorption profiles with broad absorption peaks from 300 to 800 nm, as well as a significant red-shift for the longer wavelength absorption compared to that in solution, suggesting that there might be certain molecular self-organization and highly ordered structures in the film which could facilitate charge transfer for photovoltaic applications.55–57 The optical band gaps of each bock copolymer calculated from the onset of the film absorption spectra are 1.6–1.8 eV, which are located in between the homopolymer P3HT and PBIT2 (Fig. 5).
Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical properties of different block copolymers, donor and acceptor polymers were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). In the measurement, the polymer films were prepared by dispensing polymer chloroform solutions onto the working electrode at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere, and ferrocene was used as the internal reference. Relevant cyclic voltammograms of polymers are shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. The covalently linked block copolymers exhibited quasi-reversible oxidation potentials. Their HOMO levels were calculated from the onset of oxidation curves, while the LUMO is calculated from the difference between the HOMO and the optical bandgap. As shown from the energy diagram of Fig. 5c, it is interesting that both the HOMO and LUMO levels of the block copolymers are located in between P3HT and PBIT2. By sequentially decreasing the donor or increasing the acceptor block weight content, gradual lowering of the HOMO and the LUMO from P3HT, BCP1-1, 1-2, 1-3 (or 2-1, 2-2, 2-3) and PBIT2 can be observed, which was regularly influenced by the conjugation and the D–A interaction between the donor and accepter chain.

All-polymer solar cells
The potential application of block copolymers as single-component active layers in all-polymer solar cells was investigated. Among all the as separated block copolymers, BCP1-1 with the most monomodal GPC curves, nearly the narrowest PDI of 1.23 and a suitable P3HT weight ratio of 47 wt%, was selected as the representative. The device architecture is as follows: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BCP1-1/Ca/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the fabricated all-polymer solar cells under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G solar illuminations are shown in Fig. 6. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCEs are summarized in Table 3. In general, the thermally annealed devices displayed a drastic improvement of Jsc, FF and PCE which may be attributed to thermally induced crystallization and enhanced phase-separated nano-structures of the active component resulted in enhancing charge generation and improving charge transport.58 For example, the as-spun BCP1-1 gave a rather low PCE of 0.06% with a Voc of 0.25 V, a Jsc of 0.83 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.27. Thermal annealing resulted in an increase of Voc and a dramatic improvement of the Jsc, and finally the optimized PCE of 1.0% with a Voc of 0.43 V, a Jsc of 5.29 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.43 were achieved when the simple active layer was thermally annealed at 150 °C. In addition to the thermal annealing conditions, other factors relating to device fabrication (e.g., solvents, additives, and thickness of layers) might also affect the photovoltaic performance,59–63 and thus, we believe that further improvement of the PCEs of the BCP1-1 could be achieved by optimizing device fabrication conditions via the above mentioned factors.

In order to study the charge transport properties of the block copolymers, the hole and electron mobility of the thermal annealed active film of BCP1-1 was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 7) according to literature reported procedures.64–66 Hole-only and electron-only diodes using the architectures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BCP1-1/Au for holes and Al/BCP1-1/Al for electrons were fabricated. The hole and electron mobility for BCP1-1 was measured to be 2.36 × 10−4 and 1.15 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with the hole-mobility one-order slightly higher than the electron-mobility. It should be mentioned that the charge transport properties of block copolymers have never been reported. The good and comparatively balanced charge transport characteristics of the block copolymers ensured efficient charge transport and charge collection in the single-component solar cell device, and thus to afford moderate device performance, which also provides the guidance of the promising future for fully-conjugated donor–acceptor block copolymers in the application of single-component solar cells.

Film morphologies
The effect of surface morphology on the photovoltaic performance of the BCP1-1 films was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Fig. 8 shows the AFM images of the BCP1-1 film before and after thermal annealing. The root-mean square roughness of the as-cast and thermal annealing film was 3.69 and 5.40 nm, respectively. It can also be observed from Fig. 8c and d that the thermally annealed block copolymer film exhibited coarsening and a large domain size, which amplified the phase-separated bicontinuous interpenetrated network (Fig. 8d), thus significantly increased the device photovoltaic performance.

Further evidence for the enhanced phase separation of solid-state molecular organization of the block copolymers was provided by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The sample of BCP1-1 thin films was prepared by drop-casting from chlorobenzene solution onto a glass substrate at ambient temperature or by thermally annealing at 150 °C for 10 minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere. The XRD spectra of the block copolymers are shown in Fig. 9. The diffraction pattern of both films exhibited two reflection sharp peaks which were attributed to P3HT and PBIT2 homopolyer, respectively, indicating that the intrinsic crystalline characteristics of both blocks as well as distinct phase-separation between the donor P3HT and acceptor PPBIT2 in block copolymers were retained. The prominent peak appeared at a low angle of 2θ = 5.4° corresponding to a d-spacing of 16.4 Å of the well-organized lamellar structure of p-type P3HT.67 And a high angle was exhibited at 2θ = 21.4°, corresponding to the π–π stacking between the n-type PBIT units with a d-spacing of 4.1 Å, respectively.37 It should be noted that the diffraction intensity attributing to the crystallization of P3HT was significantly enhanced after thermal annealing, suggesting amplified phase-separation between the donor and the acceptor block and the well-ordered molecular arrangement in polymer films.

Conclusion
In conclusion, fully conjugated D–A block copolymers P3HT-b-PBIT2 have been successfully synthesized through Stille coupling polycondensation in a one-pot reaction. Careful purification with preparative GPC was carried out to obtain various block copolymers with different P3HT donor and PBIT2 acceptor block lengths. It has been found that optical and electrochemical properties of D–A block copolymers are strongly dependent on the combination ratio of the donor P3HT and acceptor PBIT2 segments. All-polymer solar cells with a simple single-component active layer of P3HT-b-PBIT2 achieved a power conversion efficiency of 1.0%. These results demonstrated that fully conjugated D–A block copolymers are potentially applicable as single-component active materials, and more efficient photovoltaic performance can be achieved by the optimization of chemical structures and the device fabrication conditions.
