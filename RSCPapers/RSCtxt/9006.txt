				2) electrode with tetrasulfonated porphyrins (MTsPP; M=Zn, H
				2) is reported. Cosensitization greatly enhances the photocurrent response at the Q band of H
				2TsPP, with tenfold improvement of the quantum efficiency at 690 nm, and markedly decreases the photocurrent response in the Soret band of ZnTsPP with six-fold drop of the quantum efficiency at 430 nm. The maximum of the quantum efficiency at 690 nm reaches 14.5% on monochromatic illumination at 16.0 µW cm
				-2 when the TiO
				2 electrode is cosensitized with H
				2TsPP (0.40) and ZnTsPP (0.60). The photoelectric behavior of the cosensitized TiO
				2 electrode is attributed to the formation of heteroaggregates between H
				2TsPP and ZnTsPP molecules during the cosensitization of the TiO
				2 electrode, resulting in a decrease of the surface concentration of H
				2TsPP dimers and the presence of a low-lying charge-transfer state.
