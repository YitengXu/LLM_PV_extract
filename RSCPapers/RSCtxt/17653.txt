However, the CdS (CdS-CBD) interlayer is generally synthesized by the chemical bath deposition method (CBD) and suffers from excessive Cd2+ due to the poor controllability of interfacial chemical reactions. Here, we employed a sol–gel method to prepare a CdS interlayer (CdS-SG) with a stoichiometric ratio of Cd2+ to S2− on a TiO2 mesoporous photoanode and then fabricated CdSe QDSCs. A power conversion efficiency of 3.37% was obtained in the CdS-SG QDSCs (Cell-SG), which is higher than that of 2.64% in the CdS-CBD QDSCs (Cell-CBD) under AM 1.5G solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Charge extraction measurements showed that the Cell-SG contained fewer trap states than the Cell-CBD. A comprehensive study of the electron dynamics based on open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), intensity-modulated voltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements revealed that the stoichiometric CdS-SG interlayer significantly reduced the charge recombination and prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated electrons in contrast to the CdS-CBD interlayer in the QDSCs.
Introduction
CdSe quantum-dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted growing attention because of their tailored light-harvesting range,1–4 solution-deposition processing,5–7 and low cost.8–11 Nevertheless, CdSe has a large lattice mismatch of 11% with TiO2, the conventional photoanode material for QDSCs.12 As a result, it is difficult to directly fabricate a uniform CdSe light-harvesting layer on TiO2 using a solution-deposition method.13 To resolve this lattice mismatch issue, researchers introduced a CdS ultrathin layer on the surface of TiO2 as the seed layer for the growth of CdSe, considering a smaller lattice match between CdS and TiO2 (7%) and a similar crystal structure for CdS and CdSe.14,15 In addition, CdS with a large band gap could act as an energy barrier to suppress the back interfacial charge recombination at the CdSe/TiO2 interface.16
Several methods have been developed to synthesize a CdS interlayer for CdSe QDSCs, such as chemical bath deposition (CBD), successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), and electrodeposition.2 A CdS interlayer formed by the CBD method (CdS-CBD) is generally used in the CdSe QDSCs due to its convenience, low cost, and large-area deposition. It can enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CdSe QDSCs by 70% versus untreated ones.10 However, the CdS-CBD still suffers from some drawbacks. For instance, uncontrollable nucleation of CdS at the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles (heterogeneous) and the solution bath (homogeneous) causes diffusion difficulties for precursors inside the TiO2 mesoporous film while generating significant waste. More importantly, the formation mechanism of a CdS-CBD interlayer from the ammonia–thiourea system is assumed to start from the adsorption of cadmium hydroxide (Cd(OH)2), followed by an interfacial reaction between Cd(OH)2 and adsorbed thiourea.17–24 The incomplete interfacial conversion of Cd(OH)2 may lead to a non-stoichiometric CdS-CBD interlayer with excessive Cd2+, and these excessive Cd2+ ions acted as structural defects in the CdSe layer to increase the charge recombination risk. Thus, developing convenient and effective strategies to construct a stoichiometric CdS interlayer is important for the performance enhancement of CdSe QDSCs.
In this work, we tackle the nonstoichiometric problem of CdS-CBD by employing a novel sol–gel method to prepare a CdS interlayer (CdS-SG) on a TiO2 mesoporous photoanode. By careful modulation of the solution composition, mainly the molar ratio of the cadmium source to the sulfur source, we prepared a thin CdS-SG interlayer with a stoichiometric ratio. The QDSSCs fabricated with CdS-SG (Cell-SG) show a power conversion efficiency of 3.37% versus 2.64% for CdS-CBD QDSCs (Cell-CBD). The charge extraction demonstrated fewer trap states in the CdS-SG photoanode. Furthermore, the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), intensity-modulated voltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements showed that the Cell-SG exhibited a lower charge recombination and longer photogenerated electron lifetime than the Cell-CBD. This work emphasizes the importance of a stoichiometric CdS interlayer on the performance enhancement of CdSe QDSCs. The application of CdS-SG might be extended to other solar energy conversion systems in which a high quality CdS interlayer is needed.
Results and discussion
We employed a novel sol–gel method to successfully prepare a CdS interlayer with a stoichiometric ratio. The precursor solution contained thiourea as the sulfur source and cadmium nitrate as the cadmium source (Cd/S = 1/4, molar ratio). The precursor solution was then spin-coated on the TiO2 mesoporous film followed by heat treatment. The introduction of excess thiourea (easy thermolysis) into the precursor solution facilitated sufficient reaction of Cd2+and S2− during heat treatment. We denoted this spin-coated sample as CdS-SG and also fabricated a CdS interlayer via the general CBD method (CdS-CBD) for comparison. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data of CdS-SG and CdS-CBD samples showed Cd3d5/2 peaks at 405.54 eV, Cd3d3/2 peaks at 412.28 eV, and S2p peaks at 168.87 eV (Fig. 1a and b),25,26 suggesting that CdS was successfully synthesized.

We further analyzed the atomic ratio of both CdS interlayers from XPS data. The atomic ratio between Cd and S decreased from 5/1 for CdS-CBD to 1/1 for CdS-SG (Table 1); thus, the sol–gel method successfully eliminated excessive Cd2+ and synthesized a CdS interlayer with a stoichiometric ratio. The stoichiometric ratio of CdS-SG could be further proved by the absorbance variation of CdS/TiO2 films when the films were immersed in Na2SeSO3 solution. The absorbance of the CdS-CBD/TiO2 film obviously increased because the excessive Cd2+ could be converted to CdSe (Fig. 1c). However, negligible change in absorbance was observed in the CdS-SG/TiO2 films. When N(CH2COONa)3 (complexing agent of Cd2+ and Se2− in the CBD CdSe process) was introduced into Na2SeSO3 solution, the excessive Cd2+ in CdS-CBD does not transform to CdSe from the unchanged absorbance in Fig. 1c, suggesting the presence of excessive Cd2+ in CdSe/CdS-CBD films.

We used a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer to verify the morphology and elemental distribution of CdS-SG along the depth of the TiO2 films. The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 2a and b) revealed that the CdS-SG layer did not change the morphology of the TiO2 mesoporous films, suggesting that CdS-SG is very thin and uniform. The as-obtained CdS-SG/CdSe films were uniform without large aggregations (Fig. 2d and e). Fig. 2c and f shows the EDX line scan profile which shows well-distributed Ti, Cd, and S (Se) along the TiO2 mesoporous films, confirming the uniform deposition of CdS-SG (CdSe) along the depth of the TiO2 films.

The photovoltaic properties of Cell-SG and Cell-CBD were measured under AM 1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). In Fig. 3a and Table 2, Cell-SG exhibited a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 13.03 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 560 mV, and a FF of 0.46. The Cell-CBD showed a JSC of 10.74 mA cm−2, a VOC of 540 mV, and a FF of 0.45. As a result, Cell-SG generated a higher PCE of 3.37%, versus 2.64% for the reference Cell-CBD. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum in Fig. 3b indicates that the Cell-SG has a noticeable IPCE enhancement from 350–650 nm. Fig. 3b shows that the IPCE of Cell-SG has a smaller tail below Eg and thus the Urbach energy (EU) was estimated (Fig. S1, ESI†).27–29 The relatively low EU for the CdS-SG photoanode indicates a lower degree of energetic disorder compared to the CdS-CBD photoanode (Fig. S1, ESI†). Therefore, the enhanced performance of Cell-SG should be related to the variation of carrier transport and recombination processes of solar cells.

 Fig. 3  (a) J–V curves measured under AM 1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) and (b) IPCE spectra of the Cell-SG and Cell-CBD. 
We measured J–V curves at various light intensities to investigate the influence of the CdS-SG interlayer on cell performance enhancement. Fig. 4a displays JSC as a function of light intensity I in a double-logarithmic scale. JSC follows the power-law dependence JSC ∝ Iα with scaling exponents α of 0.90 and 0.88 for Cell-SG and Cell-CBD, respectively. This is the result of improved carrier collection and suppressed carrier recombination of Cell-SG.30 Moreover, the diode ideality factor n and reverse saturation current density J0 are other important indicators in the carrier recombination mechanism of solar cells. We calculated the n and J0 values of two solar cells from the light intensity dependence of JSC and VOC according to eqn (1): (1)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge.31–34 Cell-SG exhibits a n of 1.01 and a J0 of 1.12 × 10−7 mA cm−2; and Cell-CBD showed a n of 1.16 and a J0 of 3.07 × 10−6 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b). The n value of Cell-SG is close to 1 and indicates that the charge carrier losses of cells with CdS-SG are dominated by monomolecular recombination; however, the n value of Cell-CBD over 1 suggests that other carrier recombination paths, such as trap-assisted recombination (n = 2), are turned on due to excessive Cd2+ in the CdS-CBD interlayer. J0 is a result of charge recombination across the interface and has an inverse relationship with VOC in the solar cells. The use of CdS-SG, which has a stoichiometric ratio, suppresses the J0 and improves the VOC from 540 to 560 mV. The extracted electrons in Cell-SG and Cell-CBD are depicted in Fig. 4c. Two types of cells display different extracted electrons at the same potential bias. This is indicative of different trap states in the two kinds of photoanode.35 The fewer trap states of CdS-SG are supported by the next photoelectrical measurements.

We carried out OCVD measurements to investigate the carrier recombination process of two solar cells. Fig. 5a shows that the VOC of two solar cells decay to nearly 0 V in the dark after the same stabilization time under illumination. The Cell-SG exhibited a considerably longer decay time than Cell-CBD, and the electron lifetime (τn) of the two solar cells can be calculated from the VOC decay rate using eqn (2):36 (2)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge. Fig. 5b shows that the τn of the Cell-SG was longer than that of Cell-CBD at the same VOC.

Several electrochemical measurements investigated this variation in interfacial carrier recombination dynamics related to the CdS interlayer, including EIS, IMVS, and IMPS. The Nyquist curves obtained from EIS were recorded at different forward biases, ranging from 0.35 V to 0.60 V under dark conditions; the corresponding recombination resistance (Rrec) values were estimated by fitting the Nyquist curves through the equivalent circuit model (Fig. S2, ESI†). The Rrec of the Cell-SG was relatively larger under the same forward bias (Fig. 5c). This confirms the suppressed carrier recombination of Cell-SG.37,38
IMVS and IMPS were performed to research the electron recombination and transport process of QDSCs under illumination of a LED light source (470 nm) with light intensities ranging from 3 to 23 mW cm−2. The electron lifetime (τn) can be calculated via the relationship τn = 1/2fr, where fr is the frequency minimum of the IMVS imaginary component.39 The increased τn of the Cell-SG at different light intensities proved that the interfacial carrier recombination is decelerated at the TiO2/CdS-SG/electrolyte interface (Fig. 5d). This is quite consistent with the decreased n and increased Rrec of Cell-SG. Combining the results obtained from OCVD, EIS, and IMVS, we confirmed that the CdS-SG interlayer could efficiently suppress the interfacial carrier recombination in the CdSe QDSCs and increase the electron lifetimes. In contrast to the stoichiometric CdS-SG, the excessive Cd2+ in the CdS-CBD may be a recombination center to accelerate the interfacial carrier recombination.
Furthermore, the electron transport time (τd) can be derived from the IMPS curves according to the relation τd = 1/2fd, where fd is the frequency minimum of IMPS.40,41 For Cell-SG and Cell-CBD, the τd obviously decreased with increasing light intensity (Fig. 5d), which is well rationalized by the fact that the traps of the TiO2 electron transport layer are filled by the photo-generated electrons at higher light intensity. However, the τd of Cell-SG is smaller than that of Cell-CBD at the same light intensity. The faster electron transport rate of the former might have resulted from the more efficient filling of traps in the TiO2 electron transport layer due to more photo-injected electrons in the Cell-SG; this was seen by the higher IPCE (Fig. 3b).
Conclusions
In summary, we developed a sol–gel method to fabricate a CdS interlayer on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles as the seed interfacial layer for CdSe QDSCs. This CdS-SG presented a stoichiometric ratio of 1/1 (Cd/S, atomic ratio), which successfully solved the problem of the excessive Cd2+ in the CdS-CBD interlayer. The OCVD, EIS, and IMVS measurements confirm that the Cell-SG exhibited a larger interfacial recombination resistance and a longer electron lifetime than the reference Cell-CBD. This proves that the CdS-SG interlayer efficiently suppressed the interfacial carrier recombination of QDSCs. In addition, the Cell-SG presented faster electron transport than the Cell-CBD at the same light intensity. As a result, the suppressed interfacial carrier recombination and improved electron transport boosted the PCE from 2.64% to 3.37%. This work not only emphasizes the importance of modifying the chemical constituents of the QDSC interfacial layer, but also provides a convenient method to construct a stoichiometric CdS film to replace the general CBD method in different solar energy conversion systems, such as solar cells, photocatalysis, and water splitting.
