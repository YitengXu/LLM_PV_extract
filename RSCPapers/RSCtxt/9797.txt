    , Accepted 23rd March 2011First published on 1st August 2011AbstractA new type of shell-in-shell TiO2 hollow spheres (S@S-TiO2) featuring excellent light scattering properties were synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method followed by calcination. Various characterizations revealed that the ratio of sucrose to TiF4 in the reagents plays a key role in controlling the hollow architecture and shell thickness of the resultant S@S-TiO2 structure. The excellent light scattering property of S@S-TiO2 makes it a promising candidate for use as the scattering layer in dye-sensitized solar cells. A bilayer structured photoelectrode consisting of the S@S-TiO2 film as a scattering layer on top of the benchmark TiO2 P25 thin film exhibited an overall conversion efficiency of 9.10% under AM-1.5G one sun light intensity, in comparison with the 7.65% efficiency for a pristine P25 photoanode.

Broader context
The dye-sensitized solar cell has been intensively investigated as a promising photovoltaic system in utilizing the clean and infinite solar energy due to its high efficiency, non-toxic, and low cost nature. Light scattering structures such as hollow spheres are proposed to increase the efficiency of DSSCs by improving light harvesting. This paper presents a facile one-pot synthesis method for a new type of shell-in-shell TiO2 hollow spheres featuring excellent light scattering properties and its application in DSSCs. A 19% enhancement in DSSC efficiency is observed after introducing the shell-in-shell TiO2 hollow spheres as a scattering layer in the solar cell.

Introduction
Hollow metal oxides with well-defined architectures have recently drawn growing attention in many research areas including catalysis, adsorption, microreactors and drug delivery1–3 due to their low density, high surface area, good surface permeability as well as high light-harvesting efficiency. TiO2 is one of the most important metal oxides because of its specific functional characteristics and significance in photocatalysis, and solar energy conversion.4–6 There are a vast array of morphologies and textures of TiO2 materials reported to date, including single crystals,7,8 one-dimensional nanotube/wire,9–11 ordered mesoporous thin films,12 porous network13 and spherical particles.14TiO2 hollow spheres have been considered as the potential candidates for photocatalysis1,2 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).15–17
Since the breakthrough work into DSSCs in 1991,18 various attempts have been made to improve the efficiency of DSSC in the past decades.19–21 Apart from the search for more efficient and stable dyes, improving the efficiency by improving the photoanode materials has also seen many efforts. One of major drawbacks of the conventional TiO2 nanoparticle photoanodes in DSSCs is the negligible light scattering of the films due to the small particle size of TiO2 (20–30 nm), resulting in low light-harvesting efficiency. The bilayer structure concept with a light-scattering film has recently been proposed as it could enhance the light harvest by confining the incident light within the photoanode.22 By introducing micrometre-sized TiO2 hollow spheres as the scattering layer in the bilayer structure of DSSCs, the drawback of commonly used light-scattering particles such as large TiO2 particles (flat surfaces with insufficient surface area for dye adsorption) can be avoided.23 With the size of the TiO2 hollow spheres comparable to the wavelengths of the visible and near-infrared lights, they are expected to improve the light-harvesting yield of the TiO2 photoelectrode due to the diffractions on the hollow spheres and the reflections on the shell structure.
The most employed method for the synthesis of hollow metal oxides is by far the templating of larger colloidal particles, in which hard (e.g., silica,24polymer,25,26carbon particles27), soft sacrificial templates (e.g., vesicles,28 emulsions,29 micelles30), and even gas bubbles31 or self-template32 are used to achieve the hollow structure. Several methods have been reported to prepare TiO2 hollow spheres by employing above-mentioned template approaches. For instance Liet al. reported the fabrication of TiO2 and other metal oxide hollow spheres by using carbonaceous polysaccharide spheres as templates and subsequently removing the templates viacalcination.33 Later, a simplified and generalized approach by adding metal salts directly to the carbohydrate solutions in water and followed by a hydrothermal treatment has been reported by Titirici et al.34 To our knowledge, only single-shelled metal oxide hollow spheres could be obtained by the above-mentioned methods. On the other hand, Luet al. reported TiO2 spheres with tunable chamber structure prepared by a template-free method under 2–14 days reaction and they claimed the superior photocatalytic activity of the “semi-hollow” structured TiO2 over “full-hollow” structured TiO2 was raised from the unique sphere-in-sphere structure, suggesting the multiple reflections of the incident light within the interior cavity of the multi-shelled hollow structure result in an enhanced light harvesting efficiency.2
In this work, we report a novel shell-in-shell TiO2 hollow spheres (designated as S@S-TiO2) synthesized by a simple one-pot hydrothermal method followed by calcination. To form the S@S-TiO2, the aqueous solution of TiF4 was directly added in the aqueous solution of sucrose and then hydrothermally treated at 190 °C. The hydrothermal reaction produced a spherical TiO2-Carbon composite through the condensation, polymerization and carbonization of sucrose and simultaneous hydrolysis of TiF4 precursor. The subsequent calcination at elevated temperature led to the removal of carbon and the formation of pure TiO2 hollow spheres with a unique “shell-in-shell” architecture. The resultant microsized S@S-TiO2 were used as a scattering layer over the benchmark Degussa TiO2 P25 thin film and exhibited an overall conversion efficiency of 9.10% under AM-1.5G one sun light intensity.
Experimental
Preparation of S@S-TiO2
The S@S-TiO2 were prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The solution composition of TiF4:sucrose:H2O (molar ratio) was varied in the range of (0.33–1):(0.5–15):438.5. In a typical synthetic procedure, 6.42 g of sucrose (AR, Chem-Supply) and 0.47 g of titanium tetra-fluoride (TiF4, AR, Aldrich) was dissolved in Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm) to obtain 30 mL of mixture (sucrose: TiF4 = 5). The mixture was then transferred into a 45 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, which was heated in oven at 190 °C for 24 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was cooled naturally to room temperature. The resulting black precipitate was collected and washed with deionized water and ethanol for several times, and finally dried in oven at 50 °C overnight. The product as collected was named the titanium oxide-carbon (TiO2-Carbon) composite and was subsequently calcined in air at 550 °C for 4 h to remove the carbonaceous species, leaving the white S@S-TiO2 samples. Various samples prepared by adjusting the concentration of sucrose or TiF4 to vary the ratio of sucrose to TiF4 were conducted using similar procedures as above mentioned.
Characterizations of S@S-TiO2
The morphology of the S@S-TiO2 was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 6610) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 1010 at 100 kV, TEM, JEOL 2100 at 200 kV). X-Ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Miniflex with cobalt-Kα radiation) was used to determine the crystalline phase and estimate the crystal size of the samples. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas (SBET) were determined by the nitrogen sorption isotherms apparatus (Autosorb). All the samples were degassed at 200 °C overnight before the measurements. The chemical composition was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS with Mg-Kα radiation), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, on Philips XL30) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Mettler Toledo) was conducted under air flow at a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1 from room temperature to 800 °C. The light absorption and scattering properties of the samples were investigated by UV-visible light absorption/diffused reflectance spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2450). The dye uptake capability was obtained by soaking TiO2 powders or TiO2 electrode into 0.5 mM N719 solution at room temperature for 24 h and measuring the concentration of the residual dye in solution by UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2450).
Fabrication and measurements of DSSCs
To prepare the DSSC working electrodes, the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (2.3 mm thickness, 8 Ω/sq, Dyesol Glass) as current collector was first cleaned with a 2-propanol using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and then thoroughly rinsed with water. Both pastes of TiO2 P25 (Degussa) and S@S-TiO2 particles were prepared following.35P25 films were deposited on the FTO glass plates by doctor-blade method, which was gradually heated at 100 °C for 6 min and 550 °C for 30 min. For the bilayer structure, the S@S-TiO2 layer was deposited on annealed P25 films and heated over the same heating profile as previously. The resulting TiO2 films were immersed into a 0.5 mM N719 (Dyesol) dye solution in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile (HPLC, Lab-scan) and tert-butanol (LR, Ajax Chemicals) and kept for 24 h. Subsequently, the dye-covered TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode (Dyesol) were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a spacer of 30 μm thickness (Surlyn, DuPont) with a drop of the I−/I3− organic solvent based electrolyte solution (EL-HPE, Dyesol) introduced via vacuum back-filling.35
The photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) curve measurements employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator (Oriel) equipped with a 150 W xenon light source and an AM-1.5G type filter (Newport, 81094). The light intensity of the solar simulator was adjusted by using an optical power meter (Newport, 1918-c) with a detector (818P-040-25). J-V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measurements were recorded by a Keithley model 2420 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of photocurrent were 10 mV and 10 ms, respectively. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Newport 1918-c power meter under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon light source (Oriel) with an Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator in DC mode. A reference scan with the Si detector was taken prior to the sample measurement where the background can be subtracted. The yields reported are uncorrected for the absorption and scattering of incident light by the glass. The IPCE and J-V curves of the DSSC composed of Dyesol paste (Dyesol Pty Ltd, Australia) were also measured for comparison (S-Figure 3b and S-Table 2†).
Results and discussion
Characterization of TiO2-Carbon composite and S@S-TiO2

Fig. 1 and S-Figure 1 (ESI†) show the morphologies of the TiO2-Carbon composite particles and hollow spheres prepared under various synthesis conditions. It was clear that the resultant TiO2 particles were nearly in spherical shape under all synthesis conditions. TEM image (Fig. 1e) revealed that the TiO2 samples obtained with low sucrose: TiF4 ratio (1:1) in the reactants were solid particles. Similar results were also observed for the sucrose: TiF4 ratio of 1:0.5 and 1:2 (S-Figure 1b and 1c†). Interestingly, when the sucrose ratio was increased to 5, the TEM image (Fig. 1f) shows noticeable hollow structures with a distinguishable smaller shell inside the outer shell for each particle, a so-called “shell-in-shell” (S@S) structure, which has been rare in one-pot synthesis process. Further increase in the sucrose amount (Sucrose: TiF4, 10, and 15) led to similar final products of S@S-TiO2 structures (Fig. 1g and h). Likewise, simply decreasing the Ti concentration in the solution while fixing the concentration of sucrose, S@S structure can also be obtained (S-Figure 1d and 1e†). This indicates that sucrose: TiF4 ratio (≥5) plays a critical role for the formation of such unique hollow structures. Subsequent characterizations have been focused on the selected S@S-TiO2 structures (Designated as S1, S2 and S3 for Sucrose: TiF4 ratio of 5, 10, and 15 respectively). As shown in Fig. 1b, c and d, the S@S-TiO2 spheres exhibited quite uniform spherical shapes with diameters in the range of 1–2 μm for S1 and S2 and 1.5–2.5 μm for S3, which are distinctly smaller than those of parenting TiO2-Carbon composite spheres (S-Figure 1a†) due to the shrinkage upon the removal of carbon in the composite spheres by calcination. The diameters of the inner shells under three synthetic conditions were similar, in the range of ∼0.5 μm. Comparing Fig. 1b and d, the broken hollow spheres with thinner shell can be easily found in S3. The rough thickness of the outer TiO2 shells observed in TEM images is around 140 nm for S1, 110 nm for S2 and 50 nm for S3, respectively. This suggests that the higher sucrose: TiF4 ratio lead to a loose packing of the TiO2 nanoparticles and a thinner shell, whereas an increase in the TiF4 ratio yields a more robust and thicker shell.

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (S-Figure 2a†) of the as-prepared product indicates a mixed composite of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No. 21-1272) and amorphous carbon (JCPDS No. 46-0945) in the material. Upon calcination, the broad XRD peak of amorphous carbon was removed and the resultant S@S-TiO2 samples indicates diffraction peaks of a mixture of anatase (JCPDS No. 21-1272) and rutile (JCPDS No. 21-1276) phases of TiO2. The phase content of the S@S-TiO2 samples and the average crystallite sizes of anatase and rutile which were calculated from the integrated intensities and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the anatase (101) peak and rutile (110) peak according to the Scherrer equation36 are summarized in S-Table 1.† With the increase of sucrose ratio in the reactant precursors, the rutile content in the S@S-TiO2 samples increased. The magnified image (Fig. 1h inset) of the sample S3 indicates the hollow spheres are composed of crystalline TiO2 nanoparticles of ca. 30 nm diameter, which is in consistent with the data calculated from the XRD patterns. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas (SBET) of the S@S-TiO2 samples S1, S2 and S3 (S-Table 1†) indicated a slightly increased trend with the decreasing ratio of TiF4 in the reactant precursors, which might be associated with the deceased outer-shell thickness observed in SEM and TEM images.
From the above results, it can be reasonably concluded that the ratio of sucrose to TiF4 in the reactants plays a key role in controlling the hollow architecture of the TiO2 spheres. When the ratio of sucrose is relatively low, hollow structure hardly formed. By increasing the ratio of sucrose to five folds or more of TiF4, the “shell-in-shell” hollow architecture formed. Moreover, by varying the sucrose to TiF4 ratio or by tuning the Ti concentration in the solution, the shell thickness of the hollow structured spheres can be easily tailored.

          TGA curves of TiO2-Carbon composites (S-Figure 2b†) revealed the amounts of carbon in the TiO2-Carbon composites were quite predominated, around 90 wt% for the samples. The S@S-TiO2 residue was estimated to be ca. 5 wt% in the composite upon calcination. The chemical composition analysis performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (S-Figure 2c†) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (S-Figure 2d†) indicates that the S@S-TiO2 samples are composed of Ti and O without impurities, where the adventitious carbon37 exhibits an instantaneous presence in all air exposed materials. It is also clear that there was no fluoride residue in the sample after washing and calcination process. This is particularly favorable for our application as the presence of fluorine in the TiO2 films in DSSCs may form charge trapping sites resulting in photocurrent and photovoltage losses for kinetic reasons.38,39 The Raman shift (S-Figure 2e†) indicates the complete removal of carbon in the TiO2 hollow microspheres as the existence of the carbon G peak and D peak40 which lie at around 1560 and 1360 cm−1 in the TiO2-Carbon composites disappeared after calcination. The Raman lines at 151, 409, 515 and 633 cm−1 can be assigned as the Eg, B1g, A1g or B1g, and Eg modes of the anatase phase, respectively.41 The absence of rutile signal in the Raman spectra may be due to the low content of this phase in the samples or the insensitivity of the instrument to rutile. The UV-visible spectra of the S@S-TiO2 samples in comparison with P25 were measured to investigate the absorption properties (S-Figure 2f†). The estimated band gap of S@S-TiO2 S1, S2, S3 and P25 is 3.14, 3.13, 3.08 and 3.14 eV respectively according to Tauc plot.42 The slight decrease in the band gap energy of the S@S-TiO2 samples might be due to the increased ratio of rutile content. The absorption spectra of all the S@S-TiO2 samples exhibit a stronger absorption in the range of 350–700 nm than that of P25, which might be attributed to the superior light scattering properties of S@S-TiO2. As illustrated in Scheme 1a, the S@S hollow structure with an appropriate inner sphere diameter should allow multiple reflections of UV-visible light within the interior cavities, thus enhancing the light harvesting and offering an improved absorption property than P25, for which more light are transmitting through the smaller particles.

Proposed formation mechanism of the S@S-TiO2 structures
The mechanism of the formation of the single shelled hollow spheres using carbon-precursor based templates has been investigated extensively,33,43 which generally involves the formation of the carbon spheres as the cores by polymerization and carbonization reaction in the initial reaction step and subsequently the dehydration of hydrolyzed metal hydrates to form the hydrophilic shells on the carbon cores. In our case, the unique S@S structure implies that its reaction mechanism could be quite different from the previously reported mechanisms for single shell spheres. We here propose a multi-step process to elucidate the possible formation mechanism of the S@S hollow structure (Scheme 1b). The dehydration, polymerization and carbonization of the sucrose under hydrothermal conditions can lead to the formation of primary carbonaceous spheres,44 while the surface of the thus-formed carbonaceous spheres in aqueous solution can be hydrophilic and have a distribution of –OH and –CO groups formed from non- or partially dehydrated sucrose.45,46 On the other hand, the hydrolysis process of TiF4 is highly dependent upon the solution conditions such as pH value and the presence of other chemical species with the hydrolysis product of Ti(OH)x.47,48 In our experiments, the ratio of sucrose to TiF4 significantly affected the product structure. When the ratio of sucrose to TiF4 was relatively low (0.5, 1, 2), the dehydration, polymerization and carbonization process of the sucrose might be comparable with the hydrolysis process of TiF4 (ca. pH 2.0 when reactants were mixed with water), thus the formation of Ti(OH)x-Carbon composites can be in a relatively random manner, leading to the formation of solid final products without well-defined hollow structure. Whereas the ratio of sucrose to TiF4 was increased to 5 or above, the dehydration, polymerization and carbonization process could become predominant in the initial step (step I) of the reaction and lead to the formation of the carbonaceous sphere as cores. Importantly, the hydrophilic groups on the surfaces of the newly formed carbonaceous primary spheres may act as the “nuclei sites” for gradually hydrated Ti species to anchor, leading to the condensation and formation of a shell of Ti(OH)x on the outside wall of the carbon spheres (step III). The thus-formed Ti(OH)x shell on the surface of the carbonaceous spheres may further react with the –OH groups of oligosaccharides formed via the dehydration and polymerization of the sucrose, which forms the secondary carbon shell outside the Ti(OH)x layers49 (step IV). Further hydrolysis of TiF4 will provide additional titanium source to form the outer TiO2 shell (step V) upon further condensation of Ti(OH)x species and eventually, leading to the formation of TiO2-Carbon composites under hydrothermal treatment process. As a consequence, the S@S hollow spheres can be obtained by calcination (step VI). Since the reaction mechanisms of many wet-chemical processes remain very challenging, our one-pot hydrothermal process in forming such complicate S@S shells is of particular interest. Further detailed study on the formation mechanism of these structures is now ongoing, whilst the primary goal of this study is to design better photoanode for DSSCs, as discussed as follows.
Application in dye-sensitised solar cells

Photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) characteristics. 
In order to investigate the anticipated light scattering effect of the S@S-TiO2 on the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs, a bilayer photoelectrode was designed by covering a layer of S@S-TiO2 on top of a layer of an under-layer of P25 film (Fig. 2). Table 1 compares the photovoltaic and dye adsorption characteristics of P25 photoanodes of 7.4 μm (1L) and 14.6 μm (2L) in thickness with that of the bilayer photoelectrode consisted of S@S-TiO2 S1 and P25 having thickness of ca. 15.0 μm (1L-S@S-TiO2). The saturated dye adsorption capacity results (S-Table 1†) revealed that dye loading for S@S-TiO2 samples was lower than that of P25, which may be attributable to the considerably lower surface areas of the S@S samples. Nevertheless, it was more than 3 times higher than that of a commonly used 400 nm-diameter scattering particles with flat surfaces (CCIC Japan).15 The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 1L photoanode is around 13.0 mA cm−2 while there is a considerable increase in Jsc (16.8 mA cm−2) for the 2L photoanode by simply increasing the thickness of the P25 layer (7.4 μm vs. 14.6 μm). This increase can be attributed to the larger quantity of dye adsorption as a result of the doubled thickness of 1L in the photoelectrode; however, the photocurrent of the 2L was less than twice of the 1L due to the increased electrolyte diffusion distance and the film resistance. As a result, the overall conversion efficiency (η) of the 2L photoanodes was improved to 7.65% in comparison with that of its 1L counterpart (5.49%). Encouragingly, in comparison with 2L, 1L-S@S-TiO2 exhibited a remarkable increase in the Jsc from 16.8 to 19.4 mA cm−2, which results in an even higher efficiency, 8.27% compared to 7.65% for 2L, corresponding to an 8.1% increase. Considering the lower dye loading for 1L-S@S-TiO2 compared to 2L photoanode containing P25 nanoparticles (Table 1), it can be reasonably argued that the presence of top S@S-TiO2 layer plays a very important role in increasing the overall conversion efficiency.

Measurements were performed under AM-1.5G one sun (light intensity: 100 mW cm−2) and the active areas were ca. 0.16 cm2 for all of the cells

Dark current potential scans. 
We then further investigated the origin and evidence for the increased Jsc and η of the S@S-TiO2 coated photoanodes by performing the dark current potential scans as shown in Fig. 3. The dark current arises from the reduction of I3− ion by the electrons on the FTO substrate, and causes electron recombination and results in the loss of photocurrent.50 Although the dark current cannot be related directly to the back electron transfer process since the electrolyte concentration in the films and the potential distribution across the nanoporous electrode in dark are different to those under illumination,51 it has been considered as a qualitative technique to describe the extent of the back electron transfer. Compared with the 2L, the dark current onset of the 1L-S@S-TiO2 shifted to a higher potential and produced a smaller dark current at the same potential above 0.6 V. The observations reflected a lower recombination rate between transferred electrons and I3− ions for the 1L-S@S-TiO2. Since the bilayer structured photoelectrode containing TiO2 hollow spheres has lower density than that made of P25 nanoparticles for the same thickness, as a result of less recombination, increased Jsc and η are obtained.

Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) performance. 
The IPCE spectra for the three DSSC cells provide further evidence on the scattering effect of the bi-layer structures. The IPCE spectra (S-Figure 3a†) of the 1L-S@S-TiO2 showed a considerable increase in IPCE over the entire range of light in which the dye absorbs more effectively compared with 2L. When each IPCE maximun is normalized to 100% (Fig. 4), it provides more evidence of the superior optical characteristic of the bilayer structures. We can then clearly visualize the impact of this new S@S-TiO2 structure on the light conversion efficiency of the lower energy photons in the long wavelength range. An enhancement in light conversion efficiency from 580 nm until far in the absorption tail (up to 750 nm) can be observed, which may be attributed to the superior light scattering properties of micrometre-sized S@S-TiO2, especially in the long wavelength region.

Diffused reflectivity. 
To further investigate the scattering efficiency of the S@S- TiO2 material and P25, the reflectivity of each film was studied. Fig. 5 shows the UV-Vis reflectance spectra of S@S-TiO2 film and P25 film with and without dye loading. Before the dye adsorption, both S@S-TiO2 and P25 films had high reflectivity in the wavelength range of 400–500 nm. However, the reflectivity of P25 film decreased rapidly over 500 nm while the S@S-TiO2 film still kept quite high reflectivity in the same range, indicating the particles in the S@S-TiO2 film have a better light-scattering ability than those in the P25 film due to the comparable sphere size to the wavelength of visible light.23 After dye adsorption, the reflectance of the S@S-TiO2 film decreases drastically from ca 0.50% to ca. 20% in the short wavelength ranging from 400 to 600 nm (Fig. 5b), which is mainly attributed to light absorption by the dye molecules. In the long wavelength region, the dye-absorbed S@S-TiO2 film still remained a substantially higher reflectance than the dye-absorbed P25 film, which further supports our argument that the higher Jsc for the 1L-S@S-TiO2 film compared to 2L film is a consequence of better light scattering property of the S@S hollow structure. However, the difference of the two samples in light scattering efficiency may not be proportional to the difference in IPCE since the IPCE can be affected by a number of parameters.52

DSSCs performance based on pure S@S-TiO2
The conversion efficiency of DSSCs assembled with pure S@S-TiO2 have also been investigated and a Jsc of 13.0 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.733 V, FF of 0.593, and an overall conversion efficiency of 5.65% were obtained under AM-1.5G one sun intensity (S-Table 3†). The cell area is 0.16 cm2 and the thickness is ca. 11 μm. The main reason for the low performance of the pure S@S-TiO2 samples can be attributed to the low Jsc for which can be illustrated in two aspects: (1) the relatively lower dye loading in sample S@S-TiO2 than that of P25. Since the number of photon-generated electrons is tightly related to the number of dye molecules attached to the TiO2 surface, lower dye loading will lead to less electrons being excited by the incident photons and result in the decreased Jsc; (2) poor attachment of the S@S-TiO2 film to the FTO glass (the film can be easily wiped off with minor external force) due to the loose packing of the large particle S@S-TiO2 samples (ca. 1.5 μm), which may result in substantial uncovered bare sites of the FTO glass and thus the recombination rate in such area is greatly increased. The poor connection between the particles and also the particles to substrate will also lead to increased recombination rate and finally the lower Jsc and lower efficiency. Based on these results we chose the bilayer structure as it would maximize the advantage of the S@S-TiO2 in DSSC.
Optimised DSSC efficiency
By employing the S@S-TiO2 as the light scattering layer over the P25 film and tuning the thickness of each layer, we were able to further improve the overall conversion efficiency of our system. Fig. 6 shows the J-V curve of a DSSC based on a P25 (ca. 11 μm)/S@S-TiO2 (ca. 5 μm) bilayer structure, where a Jsc of 22.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.736 V, FF of 0.538, and an overall conversion efficiency of 9.10% were obtained under AM-1.5G one sun intensity.

Conclusions
A new type of “shell-in-shell” TiO2 hollow spheres with tunable outer shell thickness (from ca. 50 to 140 nm) have been successfully prepared by a simple one-pot hydrothermal method followed by calcination. Even though the detailed formation mechanism is still not fully understood, it is experimentally evidenced that the ratio of reactants plays a key role in controlling the hollow architecture and shell thickness of the S@S-TiO2. UV-Vis demonstrated that the light-harvesting efficiency of the S@S-TiO2 was better than that of the benchmark P25 due to the effectively light-scattering hollow structure. The DSSCs prepared with the S@S-TiO2 exhibited superior light scattering performance and an improved η of 9.10% under AM-1.5G one sun light intensity, in comparison with the pristine P25 photoanode. The use of S@S-TiO2 hollow spheres may offer new opportunities for the development of high-efficiency DSSCs.

Broader context
The dye-sensitized solar cell has been intensively investigated as a promising photovoltaic system in utilizing the clean and infinite solar energy due to its high efficiency, non-toxic, and low cost nature. Light scattering structures such as hollow spheres are proposed to increase the efficiency of DSSCs by improving light harvesting. This paper presents a facile one-pot synthesis method for a new type of shell-in-shell TiO2 hollow spheres featuring excellent light scattering properties and its application in DSSCs. A 19% enhancement in DSSC efficiency is observed after introducing the shell-in-shell TiO2 hollow spheres as a scattering layer in the solar cell.
