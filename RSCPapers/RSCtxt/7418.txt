    , Accepted 24th August 2018First published on 31st August 2018AbstractThis theoretical study on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) includes design strategies for dye donor units to improve the efficiency of DSSCs, and further illuminates the organic dye regeneration mechanism. We have designed a series of new organic sensitizers based on a D–D–π–A architecture to exhibit easy electron transfer and to have remarkable light harvesting properties in the visible region by density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD)-DFT calculations. Furthermore, the interaction of the organic sensitizers with the conventional redox electrolyte using the triiodide/iodide couple (I3−/I−) is investigated. Our calculations indicate that incorporation of strong electron-donating groups remarkably improves the charge transfer characteristics, optoelectronic properties and rapid dye regeneration as compared to less electron donating substituents. In addition, our study demonstrates the possibility of second electron injection from the oxidized dye complex to the semiconductor surface, which further confirms our recently proposed dye regeneration mechanism.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been and still are attracting much attention of scientists working in different fields due to the fact that they have emerged as the next generation of solar-cell technology, characterized by numerous features including low cost, easy fabrication procedures, and environmental friendliness.1 In the DSSC scheme, the photosensitizer is a key component in the determination of the light absorption efficiency, electron injection, dye regeneration and subsequent electron transfer process.2–5 In this context, many attempts have been made in recent years to design high performance sensitizers for DSSCs applications. Dye sensitizers based on, among others, ruthenium complexes,6–9 metal-free organic dyes4,10–15 and porphyrins16–20 were thus reported. The ruthenium-based sensitizers were found to enhance photovoltaic properties and achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 11%.21 Subsequently, metal-free organic dyes have been considered as alternatives to ruthenium sensitizers, in part due to their several advantages such as higher molar extinction coefficient, low cost and environmental friendliness. Recently, Kakiage et al. demonstrated the most efficient organic sensitizer in combination with a cobalt-based electrolyte, which yields the highest efficiency of 14.3%.22 Thus, studies of the key factors and elementary processes involved in DSSCs with the aim to overcome the fundamental limits in each energy conversion step are still of crucial importance.
Design strategies for improvement of the light harvesting and overall efficiency of DSSCs are of great interest. More importantly, chemical structure modification of sensitizer units appears to be an effective way of tuning the electronic and absorption properties. Recently, exciting progress in the construction of new sensitizers with different types of donors, π-linkers and acceptors (D–π–A) has been made improving the DSSC performance.13,15,23,24 However, dyes with two co-donor groups, having a D–D–π–A configuration, proved to exhibit significant advantages as compared to the conventional D–π–A system, including longer wavelength absorption in the visible region by tuning the bandgap, and evading dye aggregation and the impediment of charge recombination of the injected electron from the surface with I3− in the electrolyte.3,14,25,26 Thus, the choice of a suitable pair of electron-donor units in the design of efficient organic sensitizers is highly desirable for DSSCs.10,23 Previously, much research has been focused on selection and optimization of potential organic dye structures with varying π-linker and acceptors groups.13,23,27,28 However, despite all extensive studies, few studies on the systematic modifications of donor groups have been carried out to enhance the DSSC performances. Therefore, it is important at this stage to design new sensitizers by incorporating additional donor substituents on the D–π–A dye.
Moreover, of the components of the DSSC scheme, the regeneration of the dye is a critical factor in determining the applicability of a DSSC. The recovery of the dye and the regeneration of the triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox couple itself during operation is significant for high-performance DSSCs, yielding PCEs of around 10–13% for Ru-based and organic-based sensitizers.5,6,11,29 Even though the reduction of photo-oxidized sensitizers has been the subject of several studies, the inherent regeneration mechanisms still remain a matter of much debate.
Previous studies7,30–32 reported that the dye regeneration proceeds according to the following scheme: dye˙+ + I− → [dyeI]˙(R1) [dyeI]˙ + I− → [dyeI2]˙−(R2) [dyeI2]˙− → dye + I2˙−(R3)In their regeneration mechanism, the first step is a reaction which proceeds via a transient intermediate [dyeI]˙ complex. Then, the second iodide subsequently attacks the intermediate [dyeI]˙ to form an I–I bond upon transferring an electron to the dye, and thus yielding the radical anion I2˙−via the [dyeI2]˙− intermediate.7 However, we presumed that the higher stability of the intermediate [dyeI2]˙−-complex can help it to absorb the second photon instead of leading it to dissociation. Previously, there has also been a large variation between the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum and the UV-vis absorption spectra of dyes.33–36 Indeed, it is highly desirable to investigate the influence of the electron-donating substituents in the dye–iodide intermediate complexes for a deeper understanding of the fundamental process in dye regeneration and the light absorption processes in DSSCs.
In this context, we report here a theoretical study on a new set of the D–D–π–A framework to probe the influence of the terminal donor unit on the DSSC performance by systematically evaluating the donor strength and spectral properties. In a recent study, we proposed a new regeneration mechanism for the reduction of oxidized organic sensitizer, and its implications for the DSSC performance have been discussed by considering the organic dye structure.37 The purpose of the present study is to further illuminate the dye regeneration mechanism within DSSCs by considering different electron-donating units in the D–D–π–A configuration. Thus, we investigate the effects of the terminal donor unit on the electronic structure, and optoelectronic properties of the intermediate complexes with the aim to more deeply understand the dye regeneration mechanism by investigating triphenylamine-based organic dyes using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD)-DFT calculations.
2. Computational details
The ground-state geometry optimizations of the organic sensitizers and their dye–iodide complexes in both neutral and cationic states were performed using density functional theory (DFT)38 methodology with the long range correlated hybrid ωB97XD39 functional in the gas phase. The LANL2DZ40 basis set and the corresponding Los Alamos relativistic effective core potential (RECP) were employed to account for scalar relativistic effects for the iodine atom and the 6-311G(d,p)41 basis set was used for other atoms. Harmonic frequency calculations were also performed for the optimized structures at the same level of theory to confirm each stationary point to be a true energy minimum. Vertical excitation energies have been computed with the time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) method using the ωB97XD functional in conjunction with the LANL2DZ-RECP basis set for the iodine atom, and the diffuse plus polarized split-valence 6-311+G(d,p) basis set for other atoms. Solvent effects were also included using the conductive-like polarizable continuum model (P-CPM) within self-consistent reaction field (SRF) theory.42 Here we used the ωB97XD functional, which has been employed in our previous studies (Table S1, ESI†).13,37
Natural bond orbital (NBO)43 analysis was carried out at the same computational level with the aim of exploring the electrophilic sites by employing the Fukui functions. The Fukui functions (fαk) were calculated to predict the most reactive sites of a molecule at the atom k as described in eqn (1) and (2),44,45 fk+ = qk(N + 1) − qk(N) (for nucleophilic attack)(1) fk− = qk(N) − qk(N − 1) (for electrophilic attack)(2)where qk(N + 1), qk(N) and qk(N − 1) are the charges at atom k of the anionic, neutral and cationic species, respectively. Moreover, the reaction free energies (ΔGrxn) were calculated for the dye–iodide complexes by subtracting the sum of the total energy of the monomers from the total energy of the complex, as described in eqn (3) and (4). The interaction free energies (ΔGint) were also determined in a similar way: ΔGrxn([dyeI]˙) = G°([dyeI]˙) − G°(dye˙+) − G°(I−)(3) ΔGrxn([dyeI2]˙−) = G°([dyeI2]˙−) − G°([dyeI]˙) − G°(I−)(4)Furthermore, the time-dependent (TD)-DFT calculations were used to simulate the 20 lowest singlet-singlet excitations of the dyes and dye-iodide complexes. The calculated absorption energies were transformed into the absorption spectrum in the AOMix program, using the Gaussian broadening with bandwidths at half-height of 3000 cm−1, as shown in the following eqn (5):13,15,37 (5)where ε is the molar extinction coefficient, ω is the energy of all the allowed transitions, f1 is the oscillator strength and Δ1/2 is the half-bandwidth. All electronic structure calculations in this work were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package.46
3. Results and discussion
For a deeper understanding of the substituent effects on the dye regeneration mechanism, we carried out extensive DFT calculations for designing different organic sensitizers. For this purpose, a series of five metal-free organic dyes having a D–D–π–A architecture named as dye1, dye2, dye3, dye4 and dye5, were designed and investigated (Scheme 1). Further, the donor-free dye (dyeH) has been considered as reference sensitizer. The regeneration reaction proceeds through the first and second electron injection into the semiconductor surface by employing transient elementary steps, as shown in Scheme S1 of the ESI† file. In the following sections, the Table(s) Sx and Fig. Sx refer to those given in the ESI† file.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of the designed dyes with a D–D–π–A configuration framework. Five different types of donor substituent groups were studied: (a) dimethylamino, (b) methylphenylamino, (c) diphenylamino, (d) diindoline, and (e) dicarbazole. 
3.1 Structural and optoelectronic properties of isolated dyes
Chemical structures of the organic sensitizers designed are shown in Scheme 1. We started considering a potential triphenylamine-based D–π–A organic sensitizer which consists of triphenyalamine (TPA) as a donor, thiophene (T) as a π-linker, thienopyrazine (TP) as an acceptor and COOH as an anchoring group;13,23,37 incorporating different donor substituents at the terminal position forms the D–D–π–A architecture, but the same π-linker and anchoring groups are shared. The main difference between the sensitizers lies in terminal donor groups subjected to different modifications. For this, we selected five electron-donating substituents including dimethylamino, methylphenylamino, diphenylamino, diindolineamino and dicarbazoleamino for dye1, dye2, dye3, dye4 and dye5, respectively. We aimed for a detailed investigation of the influence of the donor substituents on the structure and optoelectronic properties of the isolated dyes.

(a) Structure with a different electron-donating substituent. 
Selected bond lengths (Å) and dihedral angles (°) of the optimized structures of sensitizers are given in Fig. S1 and Table S2 (ESI†). As can be seen in Fig. S1 and Table S2 (ESI†), r1, r2, r3 and r4 represent the bond lengths between the sp2 nitrogen and phenyl carbon in the TPA unit, donor and π-linker, π-linker and accepter, and accepter and anchoring parts, respectively. Compared to the dyeH, the bond lengths r1, r2, r3 and r4 in dye1–dye3 are shorter while dye4–dye5 are longer, in particular r1. Incorporation of the electron-donating unit tends to lengthen the π-conjugation, in accordance with previous reports.47,48 Further, the calculated dihedral angle ϕ1 (in the TPA moiety) and ϕ2 (between donor and π-linker) is decreased in the sequence dye1 < dye2 < dye3 < dyeH < dye4 < dye5. This reveals that the former sensitizers have better coplanarity and extended π-conjugation. In addition, the calculated dihedral angles ϕ3 (between π-linker and accepter) and ϕ4 (between accepter and anchoring parts) are almost close to 0° for dye1–dye3, indicating the better coplanarity between the anchoring and π-linker moieties.
To better quantify the influence of the electron-donating substituent strength, we considered the HOMO energies and ionization potentials (IP) along the newly designed sensitizers. Previous studies23,49 demonstrated that a linear correlation is established between the calculated HOMO energies and IP values. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows again a correlation between calculated IP and HOMO energies. From Fig. S2 (ESI†), the ordering of the donor strength is classified from strong to weak donors as dye1 > dye2 > dye3 > dyeH > dye4 > dye5. Compared to dyeH, the donor strength in dye1–dye3 is stronger, while dye4 and dye5 show weak donor strength. Thus, the upward shift in the EHOMO of the dye1–dye3 sensitizers relative to dyeH is attributed to the introduction of strong electron donating substituents.


(b) UV-vis absorption spectra of sensitizers. 

Fig. 1 shows the simulated UV-vis absorption spectra of the sensitizers considered in CH3CN solvent. Calculated absorption energies, oscillator strengths and MO transition assignments are summarized in Table 1. Each absorption spectrum exhibits two distinct bands, namely a band at the shorter wavelength (∼300–350 nm) which is attributed to a π–π* transition, and a band at the longer wavelength (∼480–550 nm) assigned to an intra-molecular donor to acceptor charge transfer (ICT) transition with π–π* characteristics. As for an index of the influence of donor substituents on absorption spectra, the values of the band at longer wavelength vary in the sequence dye1 > dye2 > dye3 > dye4 > dye5. The absorption spectra of dye1–dye3 are red-shifted by ∼6–20 nm compared to that of dyeH (∼506 nm). On the other hand, the incorporation of a carbazole substituent (dye5) as an additional electron-donating unit on the TPA moiety induces a slight blue shift of ∼3 nm relative to dyeH. These slight differences in absorption spectra attributed to the torsion angle in dye5, which inhibit good delocalization of the π-electron of the TPA moiety (Table S2, ESI†), in agreement with the previous experimental study.50

It is known that strong light harvesting efficiency needs good overlap with the solar spectrum to be to attained to produce a large photocurrent conversion.13,23,47 For all the sensitizers considered here, the UV-vis absorption spectra are red-shifted as compared to those of previously reported highly efficient organic dyes.11,14,51,52 A significant bathochromic shift in the absorption spectra values can be attributed to the electron-donating ability of the substituent groups (see Fig. S2, ESI†), in agreement with previous studies.11,14,23,33,51,52


(c) Energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals. 
Appropriate energy levels and shapes of the HOMO and LUMO of the dye sensitizer are crucial to match the iodine/iodide redox potential and the CB edge of the TiO2.12,22,23,53Fig. 2 shows the calculated HOMO–LUMO energy levels and the corresponding energy gaps of the sensitizers in the CH3CN solvent. Introduction of strong electron-donating substituents (for instance in dye1) reduces the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, and thereby leads to a red shifting of the UV-vis absorption spectra.
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of MO energy levels and band gaps of the dyes along with TiO2 and the I3−/I− redox couple. 
As seen from Fig. 2, the donor ability significantly affects the HOMO levels, whereas the LUMO energies remain similar to each other. For dye1–dye3, the HOMO energies are shifted upward as compared to other dyes, which is due to a contribution of strong electron-donor substituents. Besides, it has been observed that the HOMO energy level of dye1–dye3 sensitizers is closer to the redox potential of the I3−/I− mediator, which ensures rapid dye regeneration. Earlier studies18,54 showed that sensitizers with small HOMO–LUMO gaps bring enhanced light harvesting efficiency. Of the designed dyes, therefore, dye1–dye3 satisfy the conditions as good candidates for efficient DSSCs.
To further gain more insight into optoelectronic properties, isodensity contours of selected frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) are shown in Fig. 3. In previous studies,18,55,56 it has been reported that for efficient dyes, a reasonable charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor should be present and to the anchoring part through the π-linker. Electron density plots of the HOMO, HOMO−1, LUMO and LUMO−1, whose transition is the main contribution to the maximum absorption peak, indicate the intra-molecular charge transfer/π–π* characters. The HOMOs of dye1–dye3 are mainly localized on the TPA-donor parts, while the orbitals are more or less delocalized over the entire molecule for both dye4 and dye5. The difference in the HOMO isodensity contours is due to the different strengths of electron-donating substituents groups. Whereas, the LUMOs of all these dyes are very similar and mainly localized on the acceptor parts of the molecule, subsequently favoring the electron injection into the TiO2 surface.

(d) Ionization energies, electron affinities and reorganization energies. 
In general, for an efficient DSSC device, there should be a balance between the electron and hole-transport. Previous studies57,58 demonstrated that compounds having smaller IP values are preferred as they release more easily electrons and facilitate hole injections. Also, a small EA value is required for the sensitizer to efficiently transfer electrons into the CB of the semiconductor surface.57 The IP and EA are calculated by eqn (6) and (7) as described:57,58 IPv = E+ − E0(6) EA = E0 − E−(7)The calculated IPv, EA, and reorganization energies λh and λe data of all the sensitizers are listed in Table 2. IPv values of the designed dyes decrease as the strength of the electron donating ability of the donor substituent increases, indicating that dye regeneration is highly favored for strong donor-based sensitizers, consistent with experimental studies. Besides, the trend of IPv values is also consistent with the HOMO energy values. Further, among the sensitizers, dye1 exhibits the smallest EA value showing that the electron injection to the CB of the semiconductor is greatly favored.

Moreover, all the designed dyes are tested based on the standard electron transfer Marcus–Hush theory (eqn (8)),59–61 by calculation of the electron transfer rate constant (kET) expressed as follows: (8)where λ is the reorganization energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T denotes the temperature, and V is the electronic coupling matrix element between the two species. In eqn (8), all the parameters on the right-hand side are constant except for the reorganization energy, λ. Thus, the electron transfer rate constant (kET) depends only on λ which contains both inter- and intra-molecular reorganization energies.61 Nevertheless, the intermolecular reorganization energy has no significant effect on the electron transfer;62 hence, intramolecular reorganization energies for the hole and electron are only considered in the present work, whose values can be calculated using eqn (9) and (10), respectively:24,57,60,63 λh = λ0 + λ+ = [E0* − E0] + [E+* − E+](9) λe = λ0 + λ− = [E0* − E0] + [E−* − E−](10)where λh and λe represent the reorganization energy for the hole and the electron, respectively. E±* are the energies of the charged species (cation/anion) calculated at the optimized geometries of the neutral molecule, E0* is the energy of the neutral with the optimized cation/anion geometrical structure, and E0 and E± represent the energies of the neutral molecule and the cation/anion derivatives at the neutral geometries, respectively, as displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
The reorganization energy (λ) is thus a key quantity to probe the electron/hole transport of the designed dyes.24,57,60 Accordingly, a smaller value of the reorganization energy favors efficient hole-charge separation, which significantly influences the efficiency of DSSCs.24,43,57,60 Calculated reorganization energy values listed in Table 2 for both λh and λe are found to be smaller for sensitizers with incorporation of strong donor groups, revealing better charge transfer properties. Reorganization energies for hole injection λh of sensitizers dye1–dye3 are much smaller than those of dyeH, and dye4–dye5, which indicate that the hole injection ability of strong donor-based dyes is larger. Nevertheless, no significant difference emerges for the electron injection λe. Further, according to Marcus theory (eqn (8)), it can be found that a smaller λ value induces a rapid charge transport process. Results listed in Table 2 point out that dye1 has the smallest reorganization energy, followed by dye2 and dye3, which thus confirms that these sensitizers have efficient charge separation and probably slower recombination processes.


(e) DSSC efficiency. 
The IPCE in DSSCs can be expressed by eqn (11):20,64 IPCE = LHE × Φinj × ηreg × ηcoll(11)where LHE (λ) denotes the light harvesting efficiency at a given wavelength, Φinj shows the electron injection efficiency, ηreg is the regeneration efficiency and ηcoll is the charge collection efficiency. The LHE (λ) is related to the oscillator strength (f) of the dye at maximum wavelength and is defined as (eqn (12)):23,37,55,57 LHE = 1 − 10−f(12)The oscillator strength values of all five dyes considered are larger (Table 1) and change as the electron donor ability is varied, and so does the LHE. For dye1–dye5, it was found that the f values are larger than that of dyeH, indicating that they have better LHE. In addition, the E0-0 excitation energy of dye1–dye5 calculated by TD-DFT was 2.36–2.46 eV, which is in good agreement with the experimental studies.52,65,66 Furthermore, the electron injection efficiency (Φinj) is closely associated with the short-circuit current density (Jsc), which can be also related to the driving force ΔGinj of electron injection from the excited states of the dye to the CB of the semiconductor. Rapid and efficient electron injection from the excited dye into the CB of the surface is highly desirable for improvement of DSSC performance.8,57 In this regard, to quantify the electron injection into the surface, ΔGinj can be expressed as in eqn (13):8,24,55,67 ΔGinj = Edye* − ECB = Edye + E0-0 − ECB(13)where Edye* denotes the oxidation potential of the excited dye, Edye represents the dye ground-state oxidation potential of the system, E0-0 is the lowest excited state energy (obtained from TD-DFT calculations), and ECB is the conduction band edge of the semiconductor (for instance the energy of the CB of TiO2 is −4.0 eV).28,56
Calculated ΔGinj values using this scheme are listed in Table 2, and it is found that all of the dyes have positive ΔGinj values (in the range of 1.1–1.6 eV), indicating that the designed dyes have sufficient driving force to favor injection of electron from the excited state dye to the CB edge of the TiO2 surface.55,67–69 The ΔGinj value increases in the order of dye5 < dye4 < dyeH < dye3 < dye2 < dye1 (Table 2), and further satisfies the requirements of electron injection. Thus, among the dyes, dye1–dye3 sensitizers have the larger LHE and ΔGinj, which would result in a high Jsc response. Moreover, the regeneration efficiency of the dye (ηreg) can be given by the driving force of regeneration ΔGreg described by eqn (14):69–71 ΔGreg = Eredox − EdyeGSOP(14)in which Eredox is the ground state oxidation potential of the triiodide/iodide redox couple (−4.6 eV)28,72 which was adopted to determine the ΔGreg values. EdyeGSOP is the dye ground-state oxidation potential (GSOP), as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The calculated driving force for dye regeneration (ΔGreg) values are listed in Table 2. Regeneration of the oxidized dye can significantly influence the efficiency of DSSCs. The ΔGreg values are found to be 0.12, 0.18, 0.30, 0.62, 0.63 and 0.70 eV for dye1, dye2, dye3, dyeH, dye4, and dye5, respectively. To achieve efficient dye regeneration, ΔGreg should be in the range of ∼0.10–0.30 eV.70,73,74 Considering the driving force of dye regeneration features, dye4 and dye5 sensitizers are inefficient for dye regeneration meanwhile dye1–dye3 sensitizers lead to fast dye regeneration and tend to impede the charge recombination between the oxidized dye and the injected electrons in the semiconductor surface.
In summary, five new organic dyes have now been designed with a D–D–π–A configuration by modification of their donor unit in the TPA moiety. The ground and excited state properties of the isolated dyes have been computed systematically by using DFT and TD-DFT methods. Analysis of the terminal dye donor strength in dye1–dye3 demonstrates that these are strong electron-donating groups, while those in dye4 and dye5 are weak donor units as compared to the reference dye.
The key parameters related to the DSSC efficiency including the light harvesting efficiency (LHE), driving force of electron injection (ΔGinject), driving force of dye regeneration (ΔGreg) and charge transfer process were explored. Based on calculated results for the isolated dyes, dye1–dye3 exhibit better light absorption owing to their minimum band gaps, which reveal broadened and red-shifted optical absorption in the visible region. Of the series of designed dyes, incorporation of electron-rich groups induces a larger JSC response, a better electron transfer response, and an improved dye regeneration efficiency. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the designed dyes dye1–dye3 are potential candidates for DSSC applications.

3.2 Influence of the donor unit on the dye regeneration mechanism
To understand the influence of the donor unit, we considered the sensitizers using our previously proposed mechanism for the reduction of photo-oxidized dyes.37 Here, we employed D–D–π–A organic dye interactions with the most favored triiodide/iodide redox couple. The dye regeneration mechanism proceeds through several elementary steps as emphasized in our recent study.37 As seen in Scheme S1 (ESI†), the reaction proceeds via the first and second electron injection into the semiconductor surface. The electronic structure, energetics and optoelectronic properties of the intermediate complexes were investigated by extensive first-principle calculations.

3.2.1 Structural properties of intermediate complexes. 
(a) [DyeI]− complexes. 
As previous studies6,31,32,37 revealed the way in which the iodide ion approaches dyes, we proposed the formation of the [dyeI]− intermediate (Scheme S1, ESI†) by taking electrostatic and steric hindrance into consideration. To find the possible interaction sites, calculated NBO charges were used for Fukui functions, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†). Besides, the spin densities on the TPA moiety of the sensitizers are analyzed. To further impede the charge recombination between the surface and electrolyte, earlier experimental studies have considered the alkyl side-chain substituent in the π-spacer.32,37 Therefore, the TPA donor moieties were only taken into consideration for the attack of the I− ion. Accordingly, three different stable interaction sites for formation of the [dyeI]− complexes were selected in the TPA-donor moiety as illustrated in Fig. 4(a) (see also Fig. S5(a)–S8(a), ESI†), which is in accordance with our previous study.37
 Fig. 4  Optimized molecular geometries (A) [dyeI]− (B) [dyeI]˙ and (C) [dyeI2]˙− of the three most stable dye–iodide complexes of model dye1 sensitizers. The color scheme adopted is gray, white, blue, red, yellow and purple for C, H, N, O, S, and I atoms, respectively. The dashed line represents the interaction distances. 
The optimized structures and main interaction distances of dye1 intermediate complexes are given in Fig. 4(a) as a model and others are illustrated in Fig. S5(a)–S8(a) (ESI†). From natural bond orbital (NBO) charge analysis, the I− ion favorably approaches the π-system of the phenyl ring in the TPA via C and H atoms. It has been observed that the main interaction for this complex is between the H atom and I− with a short distance of ∼3.0 Å, indicating hydrogen bonding (I⋯H) between them (see Fig. 4a). The optimized structures of other sensitizer ([dye2I]−–[dye5I]−) intermediate complexes are given in Fig. S5(a)–S8(a) (ESI†) with the corresponding dye–iodide interaction sites, and the data indicate relatively similar quantitative features.
Moreover, the relative stability ordering based on Gibbs free energies for the dye1 sensitizer is as follows: [dyeI]A1− > [dyeI]A2− > [dyeI]A3− (Table S4, ESI†). For dye2 and dye5 sensitizers, the [dyeI]A2− complex is found to be the most stable interaction site while for dye3 and dye4 the [dyeI]A3− complex is the stable adsorption site. Thus, we notice that the relative stability trend of the [dyeI]− complexes is altered among the sensitizers as the electron donor substituent varies. The NBO charges of the I− ion for the different [dyeI]− complexes of the designed sensitizers are found to be ∼−0.95 e− (Table S4, ESI†) indicating that only a slight amount of charge is transferred from the iodide ion to the neutral dyes.
(b) [DyeI]˙ complex. 
Optimized structures of the different reaction sites of [dyeI]˙ complexes are given in Fig. 4(b) for model dye1 as [dye1I]˙ and for other dyes, in Fig. S5(b)—S8(b) (ESI†). As seen in Fig. 4(b), the interaction distance between the adjacent phenyl carbon and iodide (C⋯I) is found to be ∼3.2 Å, which is smaller than the sum of the vdW distance between carbon and iodide atoms (3.8 Å).75 This indicates a strong interaction between them, which is consistent with the calculated results reported by Nyhlen et al.32 Further, the relative stability ordering is listed in Table S4 (ESI†). As seen from Table S4 (ESI†), the [dyeI]B1˙ and [dyeI]B2˙ reaction sites are found to be the most stable structures for dye1 and dye3, respectively, while [dyeI]B3˙ appears as the most stable geometry for other sensitizers.
Looking at the atomic charge values of the iodide atom, introduction of strong donating groups in the [dye1I]˙ and [dye2I]˙ complexes results in values of ∼−0.5 e−, whereas for other complexes [dye3I]˙, [dye4I]˙ and [dye5I]˙ the atomic charge values are lower ∼−0.2 e− (Table S4, ESI†). NBO charge analysis points out that a significant amount of charge is transferred from I− to the oxidized dye for [dye4I]˙ and [dye5I]˙ complexes, which corresponds to a strong interaction between the I− ion and the oxidized sensitizers. It seems that the strong terminal donor could reduce the amount of electron transfer from the I− ion to the oxidized dye. To provide support for the values of atomic charges in those complexes, we considered isodensity plots of spin density distribution as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) and found that electron densities are localized in a small area for dye4˙+ and dye5˙+ radicals, compared to those of other dyes, indicating the transfer of a significant amount of charge via the I− ion attack. Despite the fact that a large amount of charge is transferred from the iodide ion, the [dyeI]˙ intermediate further needs another iodide ion for complete reduction of the organic dyes, in agreement with previous studies.7,32,37,76
(c) [DyeI2]˙− complex. 
Optimized structures of the designed [dyeI2]˙− complexes are given in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5(c)–S8(c) (ESI†). Similarly, calculated I–I bond lengths in [dyeI2]˙− complexes for all sensitizers are illustrated in Fig. 4(c) for model dye1, and Fig. S5(c)–S8(c) (ESI†) for other sensitizers. In conjunction with previous DFT calculations,31,32,40 the I–I coupling interatomic bond distances for [dyeI2]˙− complexes are about 3.37 Å, indicating that the I–I bond length in the optimized configuration is close to the isolated I2˙− (Fig. S10(c), ESI†).
In the NBO analysis, atomic charge values show significant charge transfer from the first I− into the I˙ in the [dyeI2]˙− complexes, mainly for dye4 and dye5 sensitizers, as compared to other dyes. The sum of NBO charge values of the I2 in [dyeI2]˙− is about ∼−1 e− (mono-negative charge) for each [dyeI2]˙− complex, consistent with the earlier DFT study,77 confirming favorable formation of the I2˙− ion in the [dyeI2]˙− intermediate. Interestingly, our result showed that the reaction site [dyeI2]C1˙− is found to be the most stable geometric configuration for the designed sensitizers. Moreover, slightly different geometric structures of the [dyeI2]˙− intermediate complexes, with almost comparable atomic charges and iodide interaction bond distances, are found (Fig. S5(c)–S8(c) and Table S4, ESI†).
(d) [DyeI2] complex. 
As described in Scheme S1 (ESI†), the complex [dyeI2] is formed mainly after the stable [dyeI2]˙− intermediate complex absorbs a photon, and subsequent to light excitation, the second electron is injected into the surface, thereby yielding the unstable [dyeI2] complex. As illustrated in Table S4 (ESI†), the NBO charges of dyes in the [dyeI2] complexes are about zero, revealing that the oxidized dye is completely regenerated. Additionally, the calculated I–I distance is altered from ∼3.36 Å to 2.81 Å, which is almost close to that of the iodine molecule, revealing a nearly complete formation of the I2 molecule from the intermediate complex. From this, the oxidized dye is confirmed to be reduced completely after the injection of the second electron onto the TiO2 surface.


3.2.2 Regeneration energetics. 
(a) Energetics. 
The calculated reaction energetics for organic dye regeneration processes are summarized in Table 3. For the intermediate complexes of [dyeI]˙ and [dyeI2]˙−, the reaction energies are negative, which indicate the tendency of thermodynamically favorable reactions. As seen in Table 3, the calculated reaction free energies (ΔGrxn) for the [dyeI]˙ and [dyeI2]˙− complexes tend to be more negative as the electron donating ability of the substituents decreases, indicating that dye4 and dye5 intermediate complexes are highly exergonic. These differences can be explained upon careful examination of the isodensity plots of spin density distributions (Fig. S9, ESI†), which shows that the spin density distributions of dye˙+ and [dyeI]˙ complexes are highly localized for dye4 and dye5 sensitizers compared to those of dye1–dye3, suggesting that the I− anion strongly reacts with the radicaloid complexes. Hence, dye4 and dye5 exhibit remarkably higher reaction energies than those of the strong electron-donating sensitizers.

Calculated interaction Gibbs energies of the dye–iodide complexes are listed in Table 4. For both dye4 and dye5 interactions with I− and I2− ions show that, the intermediate complexes exhibited stronger interaction when compared to those of strong donating substituents. From this, it is interesting to note that the contribution of weak electron donor units could be more significant for the two-electron injections with respect to those of the strong donor-based sensitizers. More importantly, the ΔGint values for the [dyeI2] complexes are slightly positive, corresponding to endergonic reactions, revealing that further dissociations of all the [dyeI2] complexes into dye and I2 are expected.

(b) Kinetics. 
To further understand the formation of the [dyeI2]˙− complex, we considered the reaction of the second iodide with the [dyeI]˙ complex and the recombination reaction [dye˙+⋯I−⋯I−] with the two I− ions is studied. Previous study7,78 has shown that the reaction between the intermediate [dye˙+⋯I−] complex and the second iodide is the rate determining step of the regeneration reaction. For this, the energy barriers were calculated by considering the reaction site [dyeI2]C1˙− of the different donor-based sensitizers, which is the configuration of the more stable complex (Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5(c)–S8(c) in ESI†).
The energy barriers associated with the transition structures for the reactions are illustrated in Table 5 and Fig. S10 (ESI†). As shown in Table 5, the recombination reaction of the two-iodide ions was favored strongly with a barrier-free pathway. Our results indicate that the second I− ion is attracted strongly to the [dye˙+⋯I−] complex. The relative values of the recombination barrier are calculated and it is found that a strong donor unit induces a faster process. Furthermore, the reaction energy for the formation of the complex ([dyeI2]−) is exergonic by ∼−0.5 eV for dye1, confirming a remarkable thermodynamic stability. It has been further found that the reaction energies are highly exergonic for the weak donor-based sensitizers. It can thus be predicted that the recombination reaction was favored both kinetically and thermodynamically for the designed dyes.

3.2.3 UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye–iodide complexes. 
The absorption spectra and the isodensity plots of the FMOs of the [dyeI]−, [dyeI]˙ and [dyeI2]− intermediate complexes are systematically shown in Fig. 5, 6 and 7, respectively.
 Fig. 5  Simulated UV-vis absorption spectrum for the three different interaction sites of [dyeI]− complexes along the designed sensitizers.

 Fig. 7  Simulated UV-vis absorption spectrum for the three different reaction sites of [dyeI2]˙− complexes along the designed sensizers. 
(a) [DyeI]− UV-vis spectra. 
Simulated absorption spectra of all [dyeI]− complexes show a significant red-shift and broadening trend in the entire visible region as compared to those of the isolated dyes (Fig. 5 and Table 6). The [dye1I]−, [dye2I]− and [dye3I]− complexes exhibit each a large broadened red-shifted absorption spectrum. The influence of strong donating substituents is thus significant, which results in a great red shift by ∼50–100 nm in the absorption spectra with respect to the isolated dyes. Only one absorption band features in all complexes considered. Also, incorporation of a strong electron-donating group in a D–π–A dye greatly influences the incident light-to-electricity conversion efficiency. Hence, the red-shifted absorption spectra of all the designed [dyeI]− complexes can be matched better with IPCE spectra.

The isodensity FMOs for different complexes are shown systematically in Fig. 8(a) for dye1 complexes as a model illustration, and Fig. S11(a)–S14(a) (ESI†) for other donor groups. The HOMO is mainly localized over the donor-parts of the TPA unit and adjacent iodide ion, whereas the LUMO is mostly spread over the π-bridge and anchoring parts of the dye–iodide complexes. A remarkable charge separation state occurs between the donor and acceptor moieties for strong donor substituents, which finally favors higher solar absorption properties. Also, the maximum absorption peaks of all the [dye1I]−–[dye5I]− complexes have main contributions arising from electronic transitions of the HOMO and HOMO−3 to the LUMO. These spectral features are thus favorable for sensitizers to be used in the harvesting of light for energy conversion for DSSC applications.
 Fig. 8  Calculated isodensity plots of selected frontier MOs of (A) [dyeI]−, (B) [dyeI]˙ and (C) [dyeI2]˙− complexes of the designed model dye1 sensitizers at different iodide interaction sites (the isovalue is 0.02 a.u.). 
(b) [DyeI]˙ UV-vis spectra. 

Fig. 6 shows the plots of absorption spectra for all [dyeI]˙ complexes. In comparison to all [dyeI]˙ intermediates, the absorption spectra of the [dye1I]˙–[dye3I]˙ complexes are characterized by dual absorption peaks in the visible region: the short band corresponds to the maximum peak centered at ∼500 nm, while the longer peaks are centered at around ∼600 nm (see Table S5, ESI†). Whereas, for the [dye4I]˙ and [dye5I]˙ complexes, only one characteristic absorption band appears. We also notice that the absorption spectra of the [dye1I]˙–[dye3I]˙ complexes are blue/red shifted compared to those of the isolated dyes, which indicates the contribution of these intermediates to the IPCE response.
Representation plots of the FMOs are illustrated in Fig. 8(b) for the model dye1 complexes and in Fig. S11(b)–S14(b) (ESI†) for other complexes. As seen from Fig. 8(b), the isodensity of HOMOs of [dye1I]˙ complexes is mainly delocalized over the triphenylamine moiety, and the iodide ion, while the LUMOs are delocalized through the acceptor moiety and the adjacent π-spacer unit, which could lead to good charge separation. Compared to [dye1I]˙ complexes, it has been observed a significant alteration in the charge separation state (for instance β spin) of all other dyes of [dyeI]˙ complexes (Fig. 8b and Fig. S11(b)–S14(b) in the ESI†), which would lead to a significant contribution for the light harvesting efficiency.
(c) [DyeI2]˙− UV-vis spectra. 
Calculated absorption bands of these complexes are significantly broadened and blue/red-shifted as shown in Fig. 7 and Table S6 (ESI†). The absorption spectra of all the designed dyes of the [dyeI2]˙− complexes have dual absorption peaks. A broad and strong absorption lies in the longer wavelength region of ∼550–620 nm for [dye1I2]˙−–[dye3I2]˙− complexes, which corresponds to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between electron-donor moieties and acceptor units through the π-bridge. Meanwhile, [dye4I2]˙− and [dye5I2]˙− complexes exhibit a maximum absorption peak centered at ∼520–540 nm. Even though all the [dyeI2]˙− complexes are characterized by red-shifted absorption spectra, with regard to those of isolated dyes, the absorption ranges in the visible region are considerably different for donor substituents. Here the absorption differences can be attributed to the donor ability in the TPA moiety of the organic dyes. Absorption bands also appeared in the shorter UV-vis region ∼440–460 nm, which are assigned to π–π* transitions.
In earlier studies, we noticed that the broad IPCE plateau is not consistent with the absorption measurement.14,36,79,80 However, our theoretical investigation of the designed dye–iodide complexes reveals that the blue/red-shifted absorption spectra of [dyeI2]˙− complexes could efficiently match with the IPCE spectra, which provides further evidence to confirm the second electron injection mechanism.37

Fig. 7 shows electron density plots of FMOs of all the [dyeI2]˙− complexes and the corresponding plots for other complexes are given in Fig. S11(c)–S14(c) (ESI†). It is evident that all dye complexes have good charge separation. More importantly, the major contribution to the longer wavelength can mainly be attributed to a charge transfer (CT) transition mostly from HOMO, HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 to LUMO. With the exception of [dye4I2]˙− and [dye5I2]˙− complexes, the electron density of the HOMO for each of those complexes is primarily delocalized on the triphenylamine moiety and the two-iodide ions, while the LUMO is mostly localized on the acceptor groups with some contribution at the π-spacer. Previous studies confirmed that the contributions of the anchoring groups for the LUMOs are of primordial importance to inject electrons into the surface.13,23 The LUMOs of all the [dyeI2]˙− complexes examined are mainly localized on the acceptor and anchoring parts, which thus facilitates the second electron injection from the dye into the surface.
The light harvesting efficiency (LHE) is a crucial factor for improvement of the performance of DSSCs, and the LHE can be determined by LHE = 1 − 10−f,23,37,55 where f represents the oscillator strength of dye–iodide complexes associated with the maximum absorption band of the dye–iodide complexes. The oscillator strength values of all [dyeI]− and [dyeI2]˙− complexes formed from the five dyes considered are larger, and tend to increase with the donor ability; so does the LHE. Furthermore, the intermediates [dyeI]− and [dyeI2]˙− have the largest oscillator strengths and LHEs and exhibit thereby strong light harvesting abilities. Thus, we expect that not only the isolated dyes, but the [dyeI]− and [dyeI2]˙− complexes also are the key factors governing significantly the IPCE response.
Overall, in the present theoretical study the influences of the terminal electron-donating unit of the designed organic dyes have been explored to understand the dye regeneration mechanism. For this purpose, three different interaction sites of iodide species have been considered, and the structural, energetic, spectral, and thermodynamic stability of the intermediate complexes in each elementary step have been evaluated. The stability of the intermediate complexes confirms the possibility of a second electron injection into the semiconductor oxide. Furthermore, we have found that the role of intermediate [dyeI]− and [dyeI2]˙− complexes of dye1–dye3 sensitizers is very significant because of their remarkably broadened and blue/red-shifted absorption properties in the visible region, which can substantially improve the light absorption properties.
Our results suggest that the blue shift in absorption spectra of the [dyeI2]˙− complexes is more sensitive to the strong donor unit, which is also a validation for a second electron injection in the regeneration process. As a result, the contribution of the strong donor group is significant for the light harvesting efficiency and it can evidently clarify the mismatch between the UV-vis absorption spectra and IPCE spectra.

4. Concluding remarks
In this theoretical study, we performed a systematic investigation to design a series of five novel organic sensitizers based on the D–D–π–A structure and probed the effects of the donor unit in dyes with the aim to further elucidate the dye regeneration mechanism. Their implications for optoelectronic properties and dye regeneration reactions were determined using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent (TD)-DFT. Additionally, the effects of different electron-donating groups on the electronic structure, charge-transfer, energetics, and spectral properties of the sensitizers were evaluated. Compared to the reference dye, the EHOMO values of dye1–dye3 are shifted upward upon introduction of electron-rich substituents, leading to efficient regeneration of the dye. Calculated results are in good agreement with experimental studies. Interestingly, dye1–dye3 sensitizers exhibit broad and red-shifted UV-vis absorption, with a minimum H–L gap and higher values of LHE, which reflect the larger IPCE response, rendering these three promising DSSC dye candidates.
DFT calculations further revealed that all the dye regeneration reaction complexes are stable based on thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. Our calculated results demonstrated that regeneration of the oxidized dye, in particular for strong electron donating groups, is favored by two-electron reduction over the more conventional single electron reduction. Moreover, strong electron-rich substituents of the intermediate [dyeI]− and [dyeI2]˙− complexes bring significantly broadened and blue/red-shifted UV-vis absorption that can improve significantly the light absorption properties, and match well with the IPCE spectrum, which lends further evidence for the second electron injection mechanism. As a result, the role of iodide electrolytes contributes not only to the reduction of oxidized dyes but also to the light absorption in the visible region of DSSCs.
Overall, sensitizers bearing strong electron donating substituents and their iodide intermediate complexes constitute promising candidates for efficient DSSC applications. This theoretical study highlights on the one hand the design of highly efficient dyes, and provides on the other hand a clear understanding of the dye regeneration mechanism. We hope that both aspects contribute to a practical strategy for enhancement of the DSSC efficiency.
