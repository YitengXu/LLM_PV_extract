    , Accepted 16th March 2021First published on 17th March 2021AbstractWe report a facile solution-phase sonochemical route for the glucose-template mediated synthesis of Cu2O nanocrystals with well-defined sizes and shapes. This approach offers a superficial and cost-effective route for the synthesis of Cu2O nanocrystals. The formation of different nanostructures (i.e., stars, cubes, and octahedra) was tuned by varying the reaction conditions as well as the concentration of template. The morphology-controlled Cu2O nanocrystals show high activity for the external base-free Ullmann homocoupling reactions of aryl halides. 61.6% conversion of chlorobenzene was achieved over octagonal Cu2O nanocrystals with a turn-over-frequency (TOF) as high as 1696 h−1. This result demonstrates that the size and shape-dependent properties of Cu2O nanocrystals are critical to the activity of aryl halide and highlights the importance of shape engineering in the design and development of an efficient catalyst for the Ullmann reaction.
Introduction
Controlling the size and shape can be crucial for tuning the properties of materials. To study these properties, specific routes are required to synthesize the homologous series of monodispersed nanometer-size crystals, better known as nanocrystals.1 The synthesis of these size-dependent metal nanocrystals and their unique properties have attracted considerable attention for their shape-dependent physical properties and diverse applications.2,3 Several synthetic routes are available, e.g., controlled reduction of metal precursors in the presence of appropriate organic templates,4 electrochemical spinning techniques,5,6 decomposition of organometallic salts,7 surfactant-mediated hydrothermal route8 and vapour deposition methods.9 Most often, nanoparticles with a size of 1 to 100 nm are obtained. Larger structures (i.e., size beyond 100 nm) have been designated as “mesoscopic nanoparticles”. The shape and size-selective syntheses of “mesoscopic” nanoparticles are rather facile when compared to nanomaterials with a size below 100 nm. Thus, they draw considerable attention due to their potential applications such as functional surfaces, catalysts, adsorbents and much more.10
Cu2O, a p-type semiconductor material with a band gap of 2.17 eV, has been developed as the potential material for various applications such as sensing, catalysis and energy conversion.11 It has shown great potential in developing photoelectrical devices, e.g. visible light photodiodes,12 enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for ZnO/Cu2O solar cells,13 light-controlled conductive switchings,14 and many more. In all the cases, Cu2O crystals have been shown to exhibit a well-defined size and shape like spheres, octahedra, stars, and cubes. Despite being an intriguing material, the success rate is low to synthesize the shape-selective Cu2O nanocrystals in a controllable manner.15 It has been primarily speculated, that on the nanometer regime, metals undergo nucleation and grow into twinned and repeatedly twinned particles. They grow mostly into face-centered cubic (fcc) crystals with large exposed surfaces confined by the lowest-energy (111) planes.16 Other morphologies with less stable planes exist as metastable phases. They have only been achieved kinetically by adding chemical capping reagents during synthesis.17 Although in recent times, scientists over the world have come up with the advancement in the material synthesis of the hollow metal architectures with desired material shapes, still it is challenging to adopt a widely acceptable synthesis procedure that is simplistic, controllable and cost-effective to produce metal-impregnated meso and/or nanostructures. In this work, we describe a facile synthesis of cuprous oxide nanocrystals by a glucose-template mediated sonochemical route. The current template route is competent to produce Cu2O nanocrystals with various shapes and sizes. Uniform cuprous oxide nanocrystals with the cubic, octahedral, and star shapes were synthesized by reacting the copper precursor with different homologues of glucose under mild alkaline conditions.
On the other hand, significant achievements have already been made in metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions for the formation of C–heteroatom and C–C bonds. This has led to more efficient synthetic protocols for numerous compounds that have importance in biological applications, pharmaceutical industries, and material manufacturing.18–20 Conventionally, these reactions involve nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction and are limited to electron-deficient aryl halides and diazonium reactions. Palladium (Pd0)-catalysed cross-coupling reactions, namely, Heck coupling, Sonogashira coupling, Suzuki–Miyaura coupling and Hartwig–Buchwald coupling, have been widely explored; however, they do not address the cross-coupling of aryl halides.
Before the discovery of the palladium (Pd0)-catalysed cross-coupling reactions, copper catalysed reactions such as the Ullmann reaction were used for C–heteroatom and C–C bond formation reactions taking aryl halide as a reactant (Scheme 1).21,22 Various considerable drawbacks are associated with the reactions mentioned above, like the poor selection of copper salt in terms of solubility, harsh reaction temperatures (>200 °C), inconsistency in the reproducibility of the reaction, a high stoichiometric amount of copper and the low tolerance towards functional groups.23 Despite these drawbacks in industrial-scale reactions, due to failure of palladium-based coupling in some cases, the only choice that remained is the copper-based cross-coupling, which is executed successfully.24 If these drawbacks of the copper-based coupling can be addressed, then these reactions may be more feasible and economical at the industrial scale to provide alternative pathways to the current palladium (Pd0) chemistry.

Experimental
Materials
Copper(II) acetate (Cu(CH3COO)2) and 2-(ethylamino)ethanol (C4H11NO) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich Co., NaOH pellets were procured from Merck GA, Darmstadt, Germany, and glucose and its homologues were procured from HiMedia BioSciences, India. All the chemicals were used without further purification. Double distilled water was prepared using a BOROSIL® water distillation unit.
Preparation of copper nanostructures
Cu2O nanostructures were prepared by dissolving 1 g copper(II) acetate (5.5 mmol) in 100 ml distilled water containing 0.2 g of glucose (1.11 mmol). After making it homogeneous, 3.5 mmol NaOH was added, and the solution was kept for aging for 10 min. Pulse mode sonication (PS) was carried out at the frequency of 20 kHz ± 50 Hz and the power of the sonicator was maintained at 112.5 W. PS generates ultra-sonic waves at an interval of one second, and the entire process took 1 hour to obtain precipitates. The precipitate was filtered out and washed several times with deionised water and acetone. Finally, the resulting sample was dried at 80 °C overnight at atmospheric pressure to obtain a red colour dry powder.
Catalyst characterization
Powder XRD measurements were performed on a Proto AXRD Benchtop X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray source in the 2θ range of 10–80°. The microstructures of the catalyst surface were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2010, JEOL) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (FEI Quanta 200 F). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) coupled with SEM was used for the elemental mapping. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FT-IR spectrometer. Before analysis, the samples were finely crushed and mixed with KBr to obtain a 1 wt.% sample mixture to make pellets. The surface area analysis and the nitrogen adsorption–desorption were carried out using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Plus (Micromeritics Corp., USA) to observe the pore properties of the samples. Before N2 adsorption–desorption measurements and BET surface analysis, the samples were degassed at 200 °C under vacuum.
The elemental composition and oxidation state analysis of the samples were carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (K-alpha, Thermo Scientific Corp.). The monochromatised X-ray using a Mg Kα radiation source (1253.6 eV) was used to irradiate the samples. The core levels were calibrated with reference to the first component of the C 1s core level peak (unfunctionalised hydrocarbons) at 284.6 eV. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out using a Micromeritics, Auto Chem II 2920 instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Before TPR, the catalysts were also heated at 650 °C for 2 h in helium to remove other impurities and moisture content and then placed in 10% H2/Ar with a flow rate of 40 mL min−1 in the temperature range of 40–1000 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1.
Ullmann reaction
The Ullmann coupling reaction was carried out in the liquid phase using a 50 ml round bottom flask containing 0.5 ml substrate in 10 ml 2-(ethylamino)ethanol and 0.1 g catalyst. The reaction mixture was kept at 120 °C and the reaction time was varied from 3 to 20 h. The reaction products were identified by GC-MS (HP 5890 GC coupled with 5972 MSD). The identified product was analysed on an Agilent 7890, installed with the MXT-WAX (30 m × 0.28 nm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) capillary column and the FID detector. The activity of the catalyst was calculated as:  
DFT calculations
To study the reaction mechanism of chlorobenzene molecules adsorbed on the Cu2O (111) surfaces, DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) under the plane-wave basis sets.25,26 The exchange–correlation energies were described using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) via the projector augmented wave method.27,28 The convergence criteria and the kinetic energy cut-off were set to 10–5 eV and 500 eV, respectively. The structural relaxation was performed until the convergence threshold was reached to 0.01 eV Å−1. The empirical correction (DFT+D3) proposed by Grimme et al. was utilized.29 The nudged elastic band (NEB) method is employed to describe the reaction coordinate. For both the Cu2O (111) surface and adsorption calculations, a Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid of 2 × 2 × 1 was used to sample the Brillouin zone in a reciprocal space.30 The Cu2O (111) surface with a 2 × 2 supercell composed of three O–Cu–O tri-layers was simulated by the periodic slab model. The slab was separated by a vacuum region of 15 Å to avoid the interactions between two periodic units. During the geometric optimization, the atoms were allowed to relax freely except the bottom tri-layer, which was fixed in the crystalline bulk position.
Results and discussion
Influence of sugar concentration
The amount of added glucose was found to have a strong influence on the final hybrid structures of the Cu2O nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), when the glucose amount exceeded 0.2 g, the uniform octahedral-like structure started to disappear, forming a highly agglomerated octahedron with an irregular shape. However, when the amount of glucose was beyond 0.5 g, the obtained products appeared as numerous Cu2O nano-sheets coiled up in flower-like structures (Fig. 1). A new type of porous oval-like structure appeared, instead of the cubes, when the glucose was replaced with lactose (lactose to copper(II) acetate ratio was 2:5), and looked like a 0.5 μm CeO2–Co3O4 core–shell microsphere as reported by Qu et al.31 A new type of star-like structure appeared, along with highly agglomerated octahedra, when galactose was used instead of glucose. However, the introduction of NaOH showed the diverse effect on the formation of the octahedral structure, and the increase in the addition of NaOH resulted in the complete collapse of the structure, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

It is worthy to note that, with the change in the copper precursor from copper(II) acetate to copper(II) nitrate and so on, an irregular lump type morphology is observed. The reduction of Cu salt by glucose to form Cu2O has been studied and reported by several groups.32 In the present study, the reduction of copper(II) acetate took place very slowly with the help of glucose and a small amount of NaOH (as the color of the solution changes gradually). The Cu2O nucleation cluster formed during the reduction rapidly grew up to nano-scaled particles. Due to the presence of their high-index planes, aggregation took place to minimize the surface energy and resulted in the octahedral morphology.33
Structural characterization of the Cu2O nanocrystals
The XRD pattern of the as-synthesised materials was found to be in alignment with pure Cu2O, with strong intense (111) phases at 2θ values of 36.4° as shown in Fig. 2, whereas, the 2θ values at 29.6°, 42.3°, 61.4°, 73.5° and 77.1° correspond to the (110), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes of the distorted face-centred-cubic (fcc) Cu2O nanocrystals (JCPDS card no. 05-0667). The surface area of the different Cu2O nanocrystals is tabulated in Table 1. The porous pebble-like morphology appears to have the highest surface area (87 m2 g−1) among the different morphologies, whereas, the crystallite size of the Cu2O nanostructures increases in the order porous pebble < octagonal < 3D stars. During the synthesis along with the presence of excess amount of NaOH, Cu2O showed loss of crystallinity and colour (pale brown colour appeared). The sonochemical reaction between Cu acetate and NaOH solution was performed until the solution changed colour. The solution colour changed from pale blue to red, indicating that the Cu ions were reduced quickly. The temperature was maintained at 40 °C to make the octahedron more unbreakable and homogeneous. Higher temperature improved the reduction time but the sample also suffered from molecular aggregation and sintering of the attached nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). After the reaction, the surface of the resulting nanostructure acquired an octahedral shape (Fig. 3a–e). From Fig. 3, it could be visualized that the formation of Cu2O mesocages with an average particle size of 0.7–0.9 μm with regular octahedral morphologies is inherited from the copper acetate (Fig. 3a–d). The different facets of the octahedral geometry could be visualized by HRTEM, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The synthesis method has been reported and the SEM images of the sample recovered in each synthesis has been shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).

 Fig. 3  (a–e) SEM and (f–i) TEM images of the Cu2O mesocages prepared via pulse mode sonication of the copper(II) acetate solution. 
As shown in the SEM images, a similar morphology pattern is observed in each of the batches. The method was found to be reproducible when lactose was used in place of glucose during the synthesis of the Cu2O nanocrystals. From the BET data, it can be emphasized that the average pore size of the synthesized material falls in the mesoporous range. The same pattern can be observed in the SEM and TEM images. There are some structural cracks which can be referred to the pores within the mesoporous range, i.e. 3–40 nm, which can be attributed to the mesocages (Fig. 3f–i and S6†). The identical Cu2O octahedra with the homogeneous presence of Cu and O (Fig. S7, ESI†) are visible for the Cu2O mesocages sample. On the spent catalyst, the atomic dispersion state of Cu and the morphology in terms of the single units of the porous pebbles were well retained (Fig. S8†). This is attributed to the strong interaction of Cu–Cu and Cu–O, while, the lattice fringes of the spent catalyst show fringes related to CuO, and the same has also been observed by XP spectroscopy, as detailed below.
The XP spectra of Cu2O are shown in Fig. 2c. The BE value of 932.3 eV indicates the presence of either Cu+ or Cu0, as there is no difference in the binding energy for Cu+ and Cu0.34 The presence of Cu+ can be observed from the X-ray induced Auger spectroscopy spectrum (XAES). The Cu-LMM peak at 916.5 eV confirms that there is a single valance copper (Cu+) present in the material (Fig. S9†).34 The strong satellite peak at 943 eV (Fig. 2c) clearly indicates the presence of Cu2+ oxide in the spent catalyst which shouldered with Cu+ at the binding energy of 932.35 eV. The CuO or Cu2O species that existed on the surface of the used catalyst were formed either through oxidation in the presence of 2-(ethylamino)ethanol or during washing and drying of the used catalyst with ethanol and air. In addition, the lattice fringes shown in the HR-TEM image of the used catalyst also proved the presence of the CuO species along with Cu2O (Fig. S8†).
Fig. S10† shows the FTIR spectra of the Cu2O octahedral catalyst recorded before and during the reaction. In the FTIR spectrum of Cu2O (Fig. S10a†), the peak obtained at 3342 cm−1 may be attributed to the Cu–OH groups and the bands in the range of 500–800 cm−1 are designated as the O–Cu–O and Cu–O–Cu lattice vibrations.35 The FTIR spectrum of Cu2O collected in between the reaction by centrifuge (Fig. S10b†) shows a new sharp peak at 463 cm−1 similar to the stretching vibration of Cu–Cl.36 These observations suggest the addition of nucleophilic –Cl (or –X) on the Cu(I) surface during the reaction.
Reduction profile of the Cu2O nanocrystals
Fig. S11† shows the H2-TPR profiles of the Cu2O nanocrystals. For the Cu2O mesocage samples, a sharp peak at maximum reduction Tm (221 °C) with a shoulder peak centred at about 242 °C is observed, whereas, the porous egg-shaped Cu2O network shows Tm at around 209 °C along with the shoulder peak centred at 216 °C (Fig. S12, ESI†). The two hydrogen consumption peaks of the copper species in the latter sample are lower. They can be correlated with the smaller size of Cu2O particles in the egg-shaped porous network of Cu2O compared to Cu2O nanocrystals, hence easy to reduce. In general, because of the higher activation energy requirement for the reduction of Cu2O (27.4 kcal mol−1) it is very hard to reduce them in comparison with CuO.37 Since the two-step reduction of the Cu2O (Cu+) nanocrystal to Cu0 indicates the availability of Cu2O in two different (edge and bulk) environments, it is anticipated that the surface Cu2O residing on the edges got reduced at a lower temperature, while the bulk Cu2O got reduced at a higher temperature. In general, Tm is dependent on the particle sizes, i.e. the lower temperature is required to reduce the smaller particles. Reduction temperature of 209 °C for smaller Cu2O and 221 °C for large Cu2O can be justified with the preference of two hydrogen consumption peaks which are considerably low compared to those of the findings by Manohar et al. in their recent work.38,39
Catalytic activity in the Ullmann coupling
Homocoupling of halobenzene is known to be much more effective in non-polar solvents such as toluene but requires an external base like carbonate or hydroxide of sodium, potassium, cesium, etc. The feasibility of homocoupling of iodobenzene in different solvents has been verified in the present work and shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). No conversion was observed with acetonitrile as a solvent. The addition of external bases like KOH and NaOH increased the conversion to 8.9 and 18.9, respectively. It is observed that the addition of the external bases complicated the separation and purification process of the product; hence, the need was arisen to have a basic solvent with a high boiling point for the homocoupling reaction. Several solvents were tried and 2-(ethylamino)ethanol worked best and achieved 41.5% iodobenzene conversion at 90 °C. It should be noted that the reaction in a 50% mixture of acetonitrile and 2-(ethylamino)ethanol ended up with 19.8% conversion with 100% bi-phenyl selectivity.
The catalytic activity for the cross-coupling of different halobenzene substrates has been performed without the addition of external bases and the results are tabulated in Table 2. The 1H NMR data of the reaction product are also shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). Cu2O with an octahedral geometry showed 87.7% conversion when the substrate was iodobenzene (entry 1) after 20 h of reaction; with bromobenzene, the conversion was 75.6% with 100% biphenyl selectivity (entry 2). The activity drops down in the case of chlorobenzene and 61.6% conversion was noted. The different morphologies of the Cu2O nanocrystals led to the variable conversion with the different halobenzene substrates during the reaction (Fig. S15†) and it was found that the octahedral crystals performed well. It is worthy to note that activation of C–Cl bond is more complicated than C–Br and C–I bonds, and in general, it requires rigorous reaction conditions than other C–X bonds.40–43 This is also in agreement with the observation made by other researchers who have reported the use of Pd-based mono- and bimetallic catalysts with the addition of external base to initiate the homocoupling of chlorobenzene.44–46 Herein, we have employed one-pot homocoupling of chlorobenzene in 2-(ethylamino)ethanol medium; to the best of our knowledge, it is for the first time that the homocoupling of chlorobenzene has been reported with a novel metal-free catalyst. In morphology-dependent catalysis, the adsorption followed by reactant activation and desorption of product is assisted by the surface atomic arrangement of the most exposed faces of the catalyst or high surface atomic density.47–49 To establish the effect of morphology on the Cu2O-catalysed Ullmann reaction, several Cu2O catalysts with different morphologies were investigated. Among them, octagonal shaped nanoparticles showed (Table 2) the best catalytic activity for the cross-coupling of halo-benzene. Other morphological entities suffer from the synergistic effect to offer maximum surface exposure towards the reactant irrespective of their low surface area than the octagonal Cu2O (entry 3–5). For the atom efficiency (%) of the reaction after 20 h using Cu2O as a catalyst, we observed that the catalyst gives a very high atom efficiency compared to the standard atom efficiency for every variety. The standard atom efficiency of the reaction is 37.8, 49.1 and 68.5 for the coupling of iodo, bromo and chlorobenzene, respectively. The TOF values are shown for the direct cross-coupling of halobenzene. The TOF for chlorobenzene was calculated at 1696 (h−1).

Postulated reaction pathway and DFT calculations
Among the most popular mechanisms for the Ullmann reaction, the radical mechanism initiates with single electron transfer from the copper metal to the alkyl halide to form an aryl radical. To verify this, the influence of radical scavenger (ascorbic acid) during the reaction has been studied and the result (Table 2, entry 8) strongly suggests the absence of a free radical path for the Ullmann coupling over shape-selective Cu2O. It is firmly believed that (as suggested by FT-IR) the reaction undergoes oxidative addition from the copper to the aryl halide and then single electron transfer takes place to form an organocuprate species (Cu–Ph). The presence of an IR peak at 463 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the Cu–Cl complex;36 this observation supports the involvement of the organocuprate intermediate formed during the reaction. In the next step, this Cu–Ph species undergoes another oxidative addition on an aryl halide. Finally, reductive elimination results in the bi-aryl product.
To better understand the detailed reaction of the complete catalytic cycle, including the oxidative addition and reductive elimination process, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used via plane-wave basis sets. Initially, an aryl chloride agent has been selected to explore the reaction mechanism that will lead to the experimentally observed biphenyl product. The computed free energy diagram to illuminate the reaction pathway on the catalytic Cu2O (111) surface is shown in Fig. 4. The reaction initiation (RI) takes place with the adsorption of the chlorobenzene molecule on the Cu2O (111) surface. At the oxidative addition transition state (TS1), the Cl atom binds to the Cu atom via a moderate Cl–Cu configuration with a distance of 2.38 Å. The bond length of C–Cl is elongated to 2.24 Å, which is longer than the value in a vacuum and probably indicates easier breaking of the C–Cl bond. The formation of this configuration is attributed to the transfer of a single electron from the copper metal to the aryl halide to form a phenyl radical and the process is endothermic with a free energy change of 0.67 eV, leading to intermediate IM1. The bond lengths of C–Cu and Cl–Cu in IM1 are found to be 1.99 Å and 2.05 Å, respectively. After that, the system undergoes another oxidative addition of aryl halide forming intermediate IM2 where the Cl atom of newly added chlorobenzene interacts with the Cl– anion with a free energy change of 0.14 eV. The transition state TS2 is more complex, as the Cu atom binds weakly with the chlorine atom (Cu–Cl distance = 2.21 Å), promising more facile dissociation to “pass it along” to the Cl– anion (Cl–Cl distance = 2.26 Å).
 Fig. 4  The calculated free energy profile to illuminate the reaction pathway on the catalytic Cu2O (111) surface. 
Moreover, the oxidative addition transition state TS2 corresponds to the rate-determining step with an energy barrier of about 0.35 eV with respect to IM2. The release of Cl2 leads to IM3 and proceeds further to the final coupling product where the two phenyl radicals react with each other. IM3 is a stable intermediate with a low free energy of −1.36 eV when compared to the initial reactants. The C–C bond linking two phenyl groups is nearly fully formed when the reaction reaches the transition state TS3 as the distance between them is reduced to 1.65 Å with a free energy change of −0.64 eV. Thereby, the reductive elimination results in the final bi-aryl product formation with a C–C bond length of 1.50 Å, realizing the completion of this catalytic cycle.
Reaction parameter and reusability
The effect of temperature as a function of the chlorobenzene conversion has been evaluated and shown in Fig. 5. A linear rise in conversion has been noted while 61.6% conversion has been observed at 120 °C, which reaches 98.2% at 180 °C. The conversion prolonging the time on stream (TOS) at 120 °C has also been examined and it is found that chlorobenzene conversion in 2-(ethylamino)ethanol increased with the increase of the reaction time, while the rate of increment was observed to remain constant.
 Fig. 5  Effect of temperature and time-on-stream (TOS) as a function of chlorobenzene conversion. Reaction conditions: 0.5 ml substrate; 10 ml 2-(ethylamino) ethanol; 0.1 g catalyst; 120 °C temperature for TOS; 20 h of reaction time for effect of reaction temperature study. 
Furthermore, Sheldon's hot filtration test,50,51 which involves removal of the catalyst during the reaction, followed by a continuation of the reaction in the absence of the catalyst, has also been carried out. The result shows no further reaction in the absence of the catalyst after filtration. Additionally, the hot filtrate was analysed by ICP to test the heterogeneity of the catalyst. The test shows negligible presence of Cu (in ppb level) which indicates the heterogeneity of the working catalyst.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a simple method for the fabrication of Cu2O nanostructures as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst system for the external base-free Ullmann homocoupling reactions of aryl halide. The catalyst is found to be stable, effortlessly regenerated, and maintains high catalytic activities over several cycles. The material with an octagonal architecture shows 87.7 and 75.6% conversion for iodo- and bromobenzene, respectively. Likewise, 61.6% conversion of chlorobenzene was also achieved with a turn-over-frequency (TOF) as high as 1696 h−1. Hence, the use of ultrasonic waves for the synthesis of Cu2O nanostructures may bring new opportunities in the development of highly active heterogeneous copper catalysts for C–C coupling or a replacement for palladium catalyst in the near future.
