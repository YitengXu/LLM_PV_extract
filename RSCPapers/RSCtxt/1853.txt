    , Accepted 29th May 2017First published on 30th May 2017AbstractHerein, a new asymmetric n-type semiconducting molecule (PhITBD) with an indenothiophene core was designed, synthesized using tethering 2-(benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazol-4-ylmethylene)-malononitrile (BM) as terminal groups, and applied to polymer solar cells (PSCs). The PSCs with asymmetric PhITBD displayed improved power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 6.57% as compared to those with the symmetric molecule IDT-2BM. The higher PCE value of the PhITBD-based PSC was mainly attributed to the enhanced photovoltaic properties, the Voc, Jsc, FF induced by complementary light absorption (550–600 nm range), morphological improvement, and balanced charge carrier transport in the active layer. Due to the effective morphological control and absorption enhancement, asymmetric structured n-type-conjugated molecules are potential candidates for improving the performance of bulk heterojunction non-fullerene type PSCs.
1. Introduction
In recent times, non-fullerene-type acceptors have gained popularity as alternatives to fullerene derivatives by overcoming the main disadvantages such as weak absorption in the visible region, limited structural modification, infeasibility of energy level tuning, and difficulty in purification.1–6 To date, various non-fullerene acceptors have been designed, which have displayed good performance in polymer solar cells (PSCs).7–11 Strategies for the design of non-fullerene acceptor molecules include the selection of perylene diimide12 or naphthalene diimide moieties13 and attachment of electron-withdrawing moieties to the end group of the conjugative core unit.14–16 Furthermore, small molecules with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) backbone have often been reported to have greater potential for high performance PSCs.17–19
The A–D–A type small molecules were constructed to include a combination of various central donor blocks, such as oligothiophenes, benzodithiophene, fluorenes, carbazoles, indacenothiophene, and indacenothienothiophenes, and terminal acceptor units such as dicyanovinylene, (indenone)malononitrile, (benzothiadiazole)malononitrile, and (benzotriazole)ethylrhodanine.20–24 While designing the structure of the A–D–A type molecules, main structure and side chain engineering could also be adopted to promote their performance. Main structure engineering includes employment of a selenophene or thienothiophene unit25 and π-extension of the aromatic rings26 to achieve the desired intrinsic properties by promoting the charge transport ability and tuning the band gap. Side chain engineering can alter the crystallinity, miscibility, and intermolecular interactions via modification of the side chain length, attachment position, and bifurcation point of the branched alkyl chains.27–30
Among the various main structure engineering methods, the simplest approach is to design an asymmetric core unit based on a symmetric analogue. Thus, asymmetric-structured acceptor compounds are frequently employed in the field of PSCs, with representatives including the well-known PTB7-Th and PBDT-3MT donors.31,32
Indenothiophene (IT), which is the asymmetric counterpart of indacenothiophene (IDT) in the A–D–A core unit, was polymerized, and the resulting polymer was utilized in PSCs; these PSCs were found to exhibit a high PCE of 9.14%.33 However, in the field of bulk heterojunction-type PSCs with n-type small organic molecules, asymmetric n-type-conjugated molecules have rarely been studied. Therefore, we adopted an asymmetric structure to design an A–D–A type small molecule; this asymmetric structure could cause nanophase segregation by impeding high degree of crystallinity and formation of large crystallites in the film states. In particular, an asymmetric conjugative donor core moiety was selected.
In this study, we investigated the effect of the asymmetric structure applied to the conjugated small molecules on the performance of the PSCs as acceptor materials. A new n-type semiconducting small molecule (PhITBD) based on indenothiophene (IT) was successfully synthesized, as shown in Fig. 1. The corresponding structure of PhITBD, which is based on both the main chain and side chain engineering, displayed an asymmetric core and a lower number of alkyl chains. In particular, a geometrically higher degree of rotational freedom between the central benzene and the linearly tethered thiophene was expected to induce a distorted structure that would yield the appropriate nanophase morphology for non-fullerene-type PSCs by alleviating the intermolecular self-aggregation. The effect of asymmetry in the molecular structure on the optical and electrochemical properties, internal blend morphology, and the eventual PSC performance was investigated, and the results have been reported herein.

2. Experimental
The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of all the compounds were obtained via a Bruker 500 MHz and 125 MHz spectrometer using deuterated chloroform (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). The content of C, H, and N was determined using a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 elemental analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass of the compounds was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (LRF20, Bruker Daltonics). The UV-vis NIR absorption spectra were obtained using an HP 8453 photodiode array UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrometer. The samples were fabricated via spin coating a diluted chloroform solution (1.0 wt%) on washed glass substrates. Cyclic voltammograms (eDAQ EA161 potentiostat, scan rate = 5.0 mV s−1, electrochemical workstation model) were obtained using a three-electrode system in a dichloromethane solution of 0.1 M Bu4NPF6. A Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. The samples were prepared by dissolving in a dichloromethane solution (0.1 wt%) using ferrocene as the standard. Atomic force microscopy (AFM; advanced scanning probe microscope, XE-100, PSIA) was used to characterize the surface morphology of the film. A silicon cantilever was used in the tapping mode for all the scans. Small molecules and poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) blend films were prepared using the same methods employed for the fabrication of the corresponding PSC device.
Fabrication of the inverted polymer solar cells
Indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass (150 nm thick, AMG Corp., resistance 15.0 Ω cm−2) was cleaned via sonication for 10 min each in acetone, deionized water, and isopropanol. The ITO glass was subjected to UV-ozone treatment for 20 min, followed by ZnO spin-coating and finally thermal annealing at 200 °C for 1 h. The blending solutions of PTB7-Th and small molecules (IDT-2BM and PhITBD) dissolved in chlorobenzene-bearing diphenyl ether (DPE) as an additive were spin-coated on top of the previous layer. Finally, MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were deposited onto the photoactive layer through a shadow mask using a thermal evaporator to produce an active area of 0.04 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter in the dark and under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 supplied by a solar simulator (Oriel, 1000 W). A calibrated broadband optical power meter (Spectra Physics, Model 404) was used to measure the incident light intensity.
Space-charge limited current (SCLC) method for the charge carrier mobility measurement
The configuration of the hole-only device (HOD) was glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au (100 nm), whereas the electron-only device (EOD) was fabricated with the configuration of glass/ITO/ZnO/active layer/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm), where PEDOT:PSS was poly(styrenesulfonate)-doped poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene). The ITO-coated glass substrates were washed in the same manner as that used for the inverted photovoltaic cells. The solutions of small molecules blended with PTB7-Th under the optimized conditions were spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 40 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thermal evaporation technique was employed for the deposition of Au (100 nm) and LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) through a shadow mask onto the active layer. The device performance was estimated utilizing a Keithley 2400 source emitter with the measurement of current–voltage curve in the range of 0–10 V. Their charge carrier mobilities were calculated using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model34via a modified Mott–Gurney equation:  where J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, μ is the electron/hole mobility, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer (thickness of active layer: 110 and 120 nm for HOD and EOD, respectively). εr was taken as 3.1 for HOD and the EODs, which was a typical value for organic materials reported in the literature.35 The effective voltage was obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (VBI) and the voltage drop (VRS) using the series resistance of the substrate from the applied voltage (VAPPL).

All commercially available starting materials and solvents including methyl 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzoate (compound 1) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co., Alfa Aesar Co. or Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. and generally used as-received. For specific reactions, the chemicals were purified when necessary. PTB7-Th was purchased from Nano-C. As a reference acceptor, IDT-2BM was synthesized via the reported method.36

3. Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The reference acceptor material IDT-2BM was synthesized via the procedure reported in the literature.36 The representative synthesis of PhITBD is illustrated in Scheme 1. Compound 2 was synthesized in a one-pot reaction via a ring-closure reaction to attach a phenyl alkyl chain to compound 1 that was induced by detaching the aromatic hydrogen to create a reactive site. Compound 3 was synthesized in 90% yield using a standard reaction to attach the stannyl group. To attach electron-withdrawing groups as terminal moieties, benzothiadiazole (BTD) was bridged to compound 3via a Suzuki coupling reaction using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. PhITBD was synthesized via a Knoevenagel condensation of compound 4 with malononitrile to obtain a cobalt blue solid after purification via silica-gel column chromatography. The compounds were found to be readily soluble in organic solvents, including dichloromethane, chloroform, and o-dichlorobenzene, at room temperature. The structure of the novel asymmetric acceptor PhITBD was confirmed via NMR analysis.

Optical properties
The optical properties of the new molecules and PTB7-Th were investigated using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The absorption spectra of IDT-2BM and PhITBD were obtained in chloroform solution and as thin films to investigate the effect of the asymmetric structure on their electronic properties; the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The chloroform solution of PhITBD exhibited a strong absorption in the 430–700 nm region that was blue-shifted as compared to that of IDT-2BM in the 480–740 nm region. The observed blue-shift was ascribed to the reduced conjugative effect in the asymmetric structure.

In addition, the maximum extinction coefficient ε of PhITBD was determined to be 6.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1, which was higher than 5.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1 found for IDT-2BM. The thin film of PhITBD also exhibited a blue-shift, with a maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of 656 nm as compared to λmax = 690 nm found for IDT-2BM. While the absorption region of the PTB7-Th donor is known to be highly superimposed with that of IDT-2BM, the blue-shifted PhITBD displays a relatively more complementary absorption due to the lower overlap of its absorption spectrum with that of PTB7-Th, thus enhancing the light harvesting ability.
The broader absorption region for PhITBD in the thin film, presented by the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) length (Table 1), was formed by the overlap of various excited structures of the asymmetric small molecules, whereas the narrower absorption region observed for the symmetric molecules was formed due to lower number of excited structures. Since symmetric molecules are expected to show strong intermolecular interactions, only a limited number of excited structures exist that result in the narrow absorption band observed for IDT-2BM. However, the PhITBD molecules may have weak intermolecular interactions. Therefore, the various excited structures can generate a relatively broad absorption band for PhITBD (Fig. 2).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to investigate the electrochemical properties of IDT-2BM and PhITBD, as shown in Fig. 3, and the obtained data are listed in Table 1. The electron affinities and ionization potentials of IDT-2BM and PhITBD were estimated from the cyclic voltammograms. The data were obtained from the oxidation and reduction waves in the CV spectra with the reference energy level of Fc/Fc+ (−4.8 eV below vacuum). The 1st oxidation potentials of IDT-2BM and PhITBD were measured to be 1.08 and 1.18 V, respectively.

The reduction potentials were −0.55 V for IDT-2BM and −0.54 V for PhITBD. Using the oxidation and reduction potentials, electron affinities (EEA), ionization potentials (EIP), and electrochemical band gaps (Eg) were determined. Thus, it was found that the Eg (1.63 eV) of IDT-2BM was smaller than that (Eg = 1.72 eV) of PhITBD.
Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level using Spartan‘10. To simplify the calculation, the hexyl groups of IDT-2BM and PhITBD were replaced by methyl groups. A comparison of the structural geometries of IDT-2BM and PhITBD revealed a torsional angle of 22° between the linearly connected thiophene and the terminal group in PhITBD (Fig. 4). Thus, PhITBD was found to have a twisted structure, whereas IDT-2BM had a ladder-type structure. The π-conjugative effect in PhITBD was reduced by opening a ring bridged to the adjacent indenothiophene with the thiophene units, and the reduced co-planarity was expected to result in a larger band gap.37 The calculated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of IDT-2BM and PhITBD are −3.65 and −3.69 eV, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies were determined to be −5.56 eV for IDT-2BM and −5.74 eV for PhITBD. It was found that PhITBD has a lower lying HOMO level and larger calculated band gap energy than IDT-2BM. The calculated energy levels displayed the same tendency as of those obtained from the CV measurements. As depicted in Fig. 1, the asymmetric structure possesses two alkyl chains resulting from the opening of one side of the fused ring. As a consequence of the asymmetry, the structural geometries and internal torsion of PhITBD also implied that the differences between IDT-2BM and PhITBD could originate from intermolecular relationships rather than from intramolecular interactions.

Photovoltaic properties
PSCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:n-type small molecule/MoO3/Ag utilizing PTB7-Th as a donor and the new n-type small molecule as the acceptor to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the inverted structured devices (Fig. 5(a)). The weight ratio of PTB7-Th and the n-type small molecule (1:1.5) in the blended film was optimized (Tables S1–S3, ESI†) to find the best combination for a feasible balance between the absorption capability and charge transportation properties (Fig. 5 and Table 2). To modulate the internal morphology of the blended film, a small amount of solvent additive (2 vol% DPE in chlorobenzene) was added. Fig. 5(b) displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves under simulated illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), and the performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. The PTB7-Th:PhITBD-based PSC exhibited the highest PCE of 6.57% with the Jsc = 14.07 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.757 V, and FF = 0.62, whereas IDT-2BM-based PSC displayed a PCE of 3.97% with the Jsc = 9.29 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.826 V, and FF = 0.52.

To investigate the photoresponsivity of the PSCs with the wavelength of incident light, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves were obtained (Fig. 5(c)). In the broad wavelength range (300–900 nm), the PTB7-Th:PhITBD blend showed a relatively high efficiency between 450 and 600 nm, supported by the complementary absorption of PhITBD, which obviously contributed to improve the PCE with a maximum EQE value of 67% at 600 nm. Thus, a higher PCE was confirmed by the high Jsc value, which could be obtained from the EQE values. In other words, the difference between the absorption spectra of the symmetric and asymmetric molecules induced by the conjugative effect and higher molar absorptivity showed a significant influence on the Jsc value for the higher PCE. Moreover, the PTB7-Th:IDT-2BM blend did not show any conclusive evidence for the influence of IDT-2BM on the PCE, which might be due to the significant absorption spectral overlap with PTB7-Th. Furthermore, the light intensity-dependent Jsc value was evaluated to show that the charge recombination in the PSCs induce decreasing non-geminate recombination losses for achieving higher FF of the PhITBD-based PSC (62%) than that of the IDT-2BM-based PSC (52%) in terms of the α values of 0.988 and 0.827, respectively (Fig. 5(d)). Fig. S2(a) and (b) (ESI†) depict the J–V characteristics of the PTB7-Th:IDT-2BM- and PTB7-Th:PhITBD-based PSCs, respectively, and the device stability was evaluated as a function of the storage time in terms of the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, viz., PCE, Jsc, Voc, and FF. The initial PCE of the PTB7-Th:IDT-2BM-based device was sustained for up to 108 h. In the case of the PTB7-Th:PhITBD-based device, no significant change in the parameters (e.g., Jsc, Voc, and FF) was observed during the measuring period. The PCE of the PTB7-Th:PhITBD-based device maintained ∼92% of its initial value after 108 h of elapsed time.
To observe the surface morphologies of the active layers in the PTB7-Th-based PSC devices including IDT-2BM and PhITBD, AFM was employed to obtain the height and phase images (Fig. 6 and Fig. S1, ESI†) In addition, the effect of solvent additives on the surface morphology was also investigated. The blend film of PTB7-Th:PhITBD showed a smoother surface than that of PTB7-Th:IDT-2BM, as displayed in Fig. 6 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values obtained for PTB7-Th:IDT-2BM and PTB7-Th:PhITBD were measured as 2.84 nm and 1.10 nm, respectively, after the addition of DPE, whereas those without additives showed 3.28 nm and 2.45 nm, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). The phase images shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S1 (ESI†) revealed the same tendency in different active layers. This morphological difference could be attributed to the suppressed aggregation behavior of PhITBD, which might result from the asymmetric structure limiting compact molecular packing. This possibly leads to better miscibility with the PTB7-Th polymer (Fig. 6). The addition of DPE was also found to improve the surface smoothness and induce efficient donor–acceptor interpenetration within the film.38 In brief, the devices showing higher PCE values were found to have a finer surface morphology of active layer. Therefore, the PSC device performance was confirmed to be affected by the surface roughness, as obtained from AFM.

To investigate the charge transport properties through the active layer, the electron and hole mobilities were measured for the blend films of PTB7-Th:IDT-2BM and PTB7-Th:PhITBD utilizing the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the configuration [ITO/PEDOT-PSS/PTB7-Th:n-type small molecule/Au] and [ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:n-type small molecule/LiF/Al], respectively, and their properties were characterized in the dark (Fig. 7). The applied voltage dependence of the current-density curves obtained for the PTB7-Th:IDT-2BM and PTB7-Th:PhITBD blends was estimated to obtain the hole mobilities of 2.83 × 10−3 and 2.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The EODs yielded the electron mobilities of 6.83 × 10−5 and 1.53 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PTB7-Th:IDT-2BM and PTB7-Th:PhITBD blends, respectively (see Fig. 7). The mobility data revealed that the PhITBD blend displayed a much lower ratio of hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 15), showing a better mobility balance than the IDT-2BM blend (μh/μe = 42). Therefore, the relatively high FF value for the PhITBD-based PSC could be explained by the better charge balance between the holes and electrons, which indicated that PTB7-Th:PhITBD blend could have appropriate multidimensional interconnectivity between the donor and acceptor units due to its nanophase segregation behavior.

4. Conclusions

PhITBD, a novel n-type high-performing asymmetric molecule based on indenothiophene and benzodithiazole, was synthesized. An asymmetric structure was employed to enhance the internal morphology and efficient tuning of the energy levels. Therefore, the cyclopentane ring between the central benzene and thiophene moiety was replaced with a linear linkage. Under the optimized conditions, the PhITBD blend exhibited a high PCE of 6.57% with a Jsc of 14.07 mA cm−2, whereas the IDT-2BM blend showed a PCE of 3.97% and a Jsc of 9.29 mA cm−2. This improved performance was ascribed to the intriguing complementary absorption, higher molar absorptivity, and well-defined nanophase segregation of the asymmetric-structured PhITBD. Therefore, engineering of the main chain to obtain an asymmetric molecule was recognized as an effective strategy to further improve the photovoltaic properties of the organic solar cells.
