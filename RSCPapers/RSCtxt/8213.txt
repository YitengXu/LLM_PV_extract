    , Accepted 22nd March 2011First published on 15th April 2011AbstractA high efficiency of 3.1% was obtained for poly(3-hexylthiophene) based monolithic solid state dye-sensitized solar cells using graphite/carbon black counter electrodes under simulated AM 1.5 solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2.

Broader context

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted high attention in the past decades for their low cost, simple manufacturing process and high efficiency. So far, the highest certificated energy conversion efficiency of a DSSC has reached 11.5%. Unfortunately, such efficiency is based on a liquid electrolyte, which imposes many hurdles for its application, such as instability and complicated technological fabrication. Replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid state medium seems to be an effective road for DSSCs' commercialization. However, the counter electrode of most solid-state DSSCs based on hole-transporting materials (HTMs) is fabricated by evaporating a noble metal. Obviously, this counter electrode, with its high-cost metals, is still an issue for widescale application. Here, we demonstrate firstly a simple method to assemble a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based monolithic DSSC with a carbon counter electrode. It is gratifying to find that with a graphite/carbon black counter electrode, a high efficiency of 3.1% was obtained under illumination of 100 mW cm−2, which is even higher than that of corresponding devices with Au counter electrodes. Impedance spectra revealed that carbon black could enhance electron injection from the counter electrode to P3HT, and lead to a decreased recombination rate between injected electrons and holes in P3HT. This monolithic DSSC with a carbon counter electrode presents a promising commercial vision.

Renewable energy sources have received increasing attention during the past decades due to the energy crisis and their environmental impact. As one of the most promising alternative energy sources, solar power is in urgent demand in the near future. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which are easy to fabricate and low in cost, have been considered as one of the most cost-effective photovoltaic (PV) devices.1 A high efficiency of up to 11.5% has been achieved with a liquid electrolyte associated with I3−/I−redox coupling,1c but DSSCs based on liquid electrolytes have many practical problems such as the leakage of the solvent and the erosion of electrodes, which block their rapid commercial application. Replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid-state medium seems to be a solution to these problems. Recently, great efforts have been devoted to all-solid-state DSSCs based on hole-transporting materials (HTMs), including organic small-molecules HTM,2conjugated polymers,3 and inorganic semiconductors.4
Although an efficiency of over 5% has been achieved with HTMs, the counter electrodes (CEs) of most HTM based all-solid-state DSSCs are made by thermally evaporating noble metals such as Au or Ag.2d Obviously, the fact that this CE uses high-cost metals is still an issue for its widescale application, and the vacuum deposition process is also highly energy consumptive. Therefore, the question of how to fabricate CEs for HTM-based DSSCs with low-cost materials and simple processes is still a big challenge.

        Carbon is an abundantly available and low-cost material, and could be deposited via simple processes such as the screen-printing method. Graphite and carbon black are the most common carbon materials that have been used in DSSCs. In 1996, Kay and Grätzel5 firstly reported a monolithic liquid DSSC with a carbon CE, in which graphite was used to increase the lateral conductivity and carbon black acted as a catalyzer. Recently, a monolithic solid-state DSSC based on a platinized carbon CE was developed by Han et al.6 Unfortunately, these works are still based on an iodine system, which connotes the possibility of unstabilization.

        P3HT, one of the iodine-free HTMs, is of particular interest in solid-state DSSCs for its high hole-mobility, amorphous property and good solubility. D102 is a metal free dye and has a high extinction coefficient. The chemical structures of D102 dye and P3HT are shown in Fig. 1a. After treatment with Li(CF3SO2)2N, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (3.4 eV) of D102 is lower than that of P3HT (3.1 eV).3f This facilitates the electron injection from P3HT to D102. Fortunately, the work function of carbon (5.0 eV)7 is close to the HOMO of P3HT (5.1 eV). These advantages prompted us to assemble a monolithic solid-state DSSC with P3HT, D102 and carbon CE.

Fig. 1b shows a schematic structure of P3HT-based monolithic devices, where a nanoporous TiO2 layer, a ZrO2 insulating layer and a carbon CE layer were screen-printed onto one FTO glass substrate layer by layer. P3HT was deposited on the graphite/carbon black layer by drop casting. Dramatically, a high efficiency of 3.1% was obtained for the P3HT based monolithic solid state DSSCs using graphite/carbon black CEs under simulated AM 1.5 solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2, which is even higher than that of corresponding devices using vacuum deposited Au CE.3f The fluorine-doped SnO2 substrates were etched with a laser to form two detached electrode patterns before being cleaned ultrasonically with detergent, deionized water and ethanol. After that, the patterned substrates were coated with a 100 nm compact TiO2 layer by aerosol spray pyrolysis, and then a 2 μm nanoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by screen printing with a TiO2 slurry. After being sintered at 450 °C for 30 min, the films were soaked in an aqueous solution of TiCl4 (0.05 M) for 30 min at 70 °C.8 The samples were sintered again at 450 °C for 15 min after rinsing with deionized water and ethanol. Then, a 4 μm insulating ZrO2 layer was printed on the top of the nanoporous TiO2 layer using a ZrO2 paste, which also acts as a light-reflecting spacer layer. Finally, the carbon CE was coated on the top of ZrO2 layer by printing a carbon slurry and sintering at 400 °C for 30 min. The thickness of the carbon film was around 25 μm. After dying with D102 solution (0.5 mM in CH3CN:t-BuOH (1:1)) at room temperature for 24 h, the samples were rinsed in dry ethanol 3 times and dried under a flow of air. Then, the samples were immersed in an acetonitrile solution containing Li(CF3SO2)2N (Aldrich, 20 mg ml−1) for 5 min, and dried under a flow of air. A 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution containing P3HT (Synwitech. CO, LTD. 40 mg ml−1) was dropped onto the carbon layer. After being dried gradually at 65 °C for 40 min, the P3HT based monolithic solid-state DSSCs were prepared successfully.

Figs 2a and b show the SEM cross section of a P3HT-based monolithic solid-state DSSC and its high magnification dye-sensitized TiO2/P3HT layer, respectively. In Fig. 2a, it is clear that 2.3 μm TiO2 layer, 1.6 μm ZrO2 layer and around 25 μm carbon layer are ordinally deposited on the surface of FTO glass. The film in Fig. 2b shows a sheet structure with very soft features and low contrast within various small areas, indicating homogeneity and effective pore filling. This indicates that such a monolithic device could be successfully filled with P3HT, although the total thickness of the device is more than 28 μm.

The characteristic parameters of the current–voltage curves of TiO2/D102/Li+/P3HT/C solar devices with different ZrO2 thicknesses were obtained under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are presented in Table 1. There, the thickness of TiO2 film is 1.6 μm and the thickness of carbon CE is around 25 μm. Generally, the thickness of HTM layer between the dye-sensitized TiO2 film and the vacuum deposited noble metal CE layer is controlled to be around 100–200 nm.3c It is well known that a thinner HTM layer between the TiO2 film and the CE layer corresponds to a smaller series resistance; moreover, it also means that more light could be reflected by the CE. As a result, the HTM layer should be as thin as possible, if that does not lead to a short circuit. Herein, the optimized ZrO2 film thickness, which determines the distance between the TiO2 film and the carbon layer, is controlled within 1–6 μm. Compared with devices with ZrO2 insulating layers, devices without a ZrO2 layer show a lower open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.53 V and a lower short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.43 mA cm−2. This was assumed to be due to the insulating ZrO2 layer preventing the transfer of electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 to the carbon counter electrode. The highest fill factor (FF) of 0.7 was obtained for devices without a ZrO2 layer. This may be attributed to better filling of P3HT and a lower series resistance for devices without a ZrO2 layer. However, when the thickness of the ZrO2 film is increased from 1.1 μm to 6.3 μm, all the parameters of these devices show approximative values, which present as 0.63–0.67 V for Voc, 6.1–6.6 mA cm−2 for Jsc, and 2.5–2.7% for the efficiency. In fact, when the thickness of the ZrO2 film is further increased to 9.5 μm, the Jsc decreased to 4.5 mA cm−2, the FF decreased to 0.48 and the efficiency decreased to 1.5%. This could be attributed to the fact that a ZrO2 film with a thickness above 6 μm leads to poor pore-filling and a high series resistance. As a result, the optimized ZrO2 film thickness was in the range 1–6 μm for P3HT based monolithic solid-state DSSCs when the thickness of TiO2 was 1.6 μm.

For further optimization of P3HT-based monolithic DSSCs with carbon CEs, the characteristic parameters of the current–voltage curves of TiO2/D102/Li+/P3HT/C solar devices with different TiO2 thicknesses were obtained under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are presented in Table 2, where the thickness of the ZrO2 insulating layer and the carbon CE were kept at the same values of 4 μm and 25 μm, respectively. It indicated that with the increase of of the TiO2 film thickness, the Voc remains around 0.63 V, the Jsc increases from 6.1 mA cm−2 for the device with a 0.9 μm TiO2 layer to 7.6 mA cm−2 for that with a 2.0 μm TiO2 layer. This could be attributed to the fact that a thicker TiO2 film could absorb more dye and then higher photocurrent density would be obtained. However, when the thickness of the TiO2 film was further increased to 5.4 μm, the Jsc decreased to 6.1 mA cm−2. This could be attributed to the fact that a thicker TiO2 film could lead to worse pore filling and a higher series resistance. Clearly, the highest Jsc could be obtained when the thickness of TiO2 film is 2 μm. However, the FF of these devices decreased gradually from 0.67 to 0.41 when the thickness of the TiO2 film was increased from 0.9 μm to 5.4 μm. When the thicknesses of the TiO2 layer and the ZrO2 layer were 1.6 μm and 9.5 μm respectively, the FF value of the DSSC was 0.48, which was higher than the 0.41 achieved for the device with 5.4 μm TiO2 and 4 μm ZrO2 layers. This could be attributed to the better filling of P3HT in the ZrO2 layer than in the TiO2 film, since the size of the ZrO2 particles (90 nm) was much larger than that of the TiO2 particles (18 nm). As a result, the overall energy conversion efficiency increased from 2.65% for the devices with 0.9 μm TiO2 films to 3.11% for those with 2 μm TiO2 films, and then decreased to 2.7% for 3.3 μm and 1.45% for 5.4 μm when the thickness of the TiO2 film was further increased. Therefore, the highest efficiency of 3.11% of P3HT based monolithic solid-state DSSCs was obtained with a 2 μm TiO2 film thickness.

In order to investigate the effect of carbon black on the performance of P3HT-based monolithic DSSCs with graphite/carbon black counter electrodes (GCCEs), devices with blank graphite counter electrodes (GCEs) were fabricated. The current density–voltage curves of GCCE based and GCE based DSSCs were measured under irradiation by 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 simulated sunlight and are presented in Fig. 3, where the thicknesses of the TiO2 nanocrystallite layer and the ZrO2 layer were optimized at 2.0 μm and 4.0 μm, respectively. The GCCE based devices showed a higher performance (Jsc = 7.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.62 V, and η = 3.1%) than that of the GCE based devices (Jsc = 5.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.52 V, η = 1.8%). Fig. 4 shows the corresponding incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the devices used in Fig. 3. The IPCE is defined as the ratio of collected electrons to incident photons, which reflects the light response of devices and is directly related to the Jsc. Obviously, the IPCE value of the GCCE based devices is higher than that of the GCE based devices in the full-scale visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The highest values of these devices are obtained at 470 nm, where the IPCE value of the GCCE based devices is 50%, which is a factor of 31% more than that of the GCE based devices (38%). These data indicate that the GCCE based devices collect electrons more efficiently relative to the GCE based devices. As a result, the Jsc of the GCCE based devices is higher than that of the GCE based devices.

Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are widely used to investigate charge transfer rates at the interface of either dye sensitized TiO2/HTM or HTM/CE.9 Herein, the EIS of the GCCE based and GCE based DSSCs were tested at −0.6 V with a PARSTAT2273 advanced electrochemical system under dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 5. The high frequency arc (ranging from 1 MHz to 1 kHz) is assigned to the charge exchange process at the P3HT/CE interface. The low frequency arc (ranging from 500 Hz to 0.4 Hz) corresponds to the recombination between the electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and the holes in the P3HT. The results indicate that the high frequency arc radius of the GCE based devices is larger than that of the GCCE based devices, but the low frequency arc radius of the GCE based devices is smaller than that of the GCCE based devices. This means that the charge transfer resistance (R1) between GCE and P3HT is larger than between GCCE and P3HT, while the recombination resistance (R2) at the TiO2/HTM interface of the GCE based devices is smaller than that of the GCCE based devices.
 Fig. 5  Electrochemical impedance spectra of P3HT-based monolithic DSSCs with different CEs: graphite CE (circle), graphite and carbon black CE (square). 
The photovoltaic performances and related parameters obtained by analogizing the impedance spectra10 of the GCE based devices and the GCCE based devices are summarized in Table 3. Since R1 of the GCCE based devices (9.7 Ω cm2) is smaller than that of the GCE based devices (27.6 Ω cm2), electron injection at the P3HT/CE interface is more efficient for the GCCE based devices than for the GCE based devices, and as a result, a higher Jsc is obtained for the GCCE based devices than for the GCE based devices. On the other hand, since electron transfer from the CE to P3HT is more difficult for GCE based devices than for GCCE based devices, the hole density in P3HT for the GCE based devices should be higher than that for the GCCE based devices. This facilitates the recombination between electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and holes in P3HT. The recombination between holes in P3HT and electrons in TiO2 results in a downward shift of the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2. This explains why a lower Voc is obtained for the GCE based devices than for the GCCE based devices, since the Voc is decided by the difference between the quasi-Fermi level in TiO2 and the quasi-Fermi level in P3HT.12 Moreover, the recombination resistance (R2) of the GCE based devices (56.0 Ω cm2) is smaller than that of the GCCE based devices (203.6 Ω cm2). Because a small recombination resistance means a high recombination rate, the GCE based devices have higher recombination rates than the GCCE based devices. The recombination lifetime (τ) is also used to investigate the TiO2/P3HT interface, and can be obtained using the equation τ = 1/2πfmid;11 here the fmid is defined as the midfrequency peak of the bode-phase plots in impedance spectra.10b,12 The GCE based devices and the GCCE based devices exhibit fmid values of 97 Hz and 45 Hz, respectively. This represents the fact that the GCCE based devices have a longer recombination lifetime (3.5 ms) than the GCE based devices (1.6 ms). These results demonstrate that the use of carbon black in the CE decreases the charge recombination between the injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and the holes in P3HT. This could explain why a larger Voc is obtained for the GCCE based devices than for the GCE based devices. Therefore, CEs composed of graphite and carbon black exhibited better performance for the P3HT based monolithic solid-state DSSCs than those composed of pure graphite CE.

In conclusion, we have developed highly efficient P3HT based monolithic DSSCs with low-cost carbon CEs. Compared with blank graphite CE based devices, the devices with graphite and carbon black CEs shows a higher efficiency of 3.1%. Impedance spectra revealed that carbon black could enhance the electron injection from the CE to P3HT and lead to a decreased recombination rate between injected electrons and holes in P3HT. This design of HTM-based monolithic DSSCs with carbon CEs presents a promising substitute for conventional HTM-based DSSCs with vacuum-deposited metal CEs, and offers a path to the commercial development of DSSCs with low cost CEs. Further improvement could be expected from interface engineering or sensitizer design.

Broader context

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted high attention in the past decades for their low cost, simple manufacturing process and high efficiency. So far, the highest certificated energy conversion efficiency of a DSSC has reached 11.5%. Unfortunately, such efficiency is based on a liquid electrolyte, which imposes many hurdles for its application, such as instability and complicated technological fabrication. Replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid state medium seems to be an effective road for DSSCs' commercialization. However, the counter electrode of most solid-state DSSCs based on hole-transporting materials (HTMs) is fabricated by evaporating a noble metal. Obviously, this counter electrode, with its high-cost metals, is still an issue for widescale application. Here, we demonstrate firstly a simple method to assemble a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)-based monolithic DSSC with a carbon counter electrode. It is gratifying to find that with a graphite/carbon black counter electrode, a high efficiency of 3.1% was obtained under illumination of 100 mW cm−2, which is even higher than that of corresponding devices with Au counter electrodes. Impedance spectra revealed that carbon black could enhance electron injection from the counter electrode to P3HT, and lead to a decreased recombination rate between injected electrons and holes in P3HT. This monolithic DSSC with a carbon counter electrode presents a promising commercial vision.
