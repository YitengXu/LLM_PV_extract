    , Accepted 17th June 2020First published on 18th June 2020AbstractFor the first time, we demonstrated successful post-synthesis incorporation of metal dopants at elevated temperature into a host structure of Sn2P2S6, known as the grandfather of dichalcogenide ferroelectrics with a formula M2P2X6 (M = metal and X = chalcogen). With the example of Cu, we show that the integration of dopant atoms into the bulk of an already grown crystal could be easily tuned up to 0.5 at% affecting the structural, optical, vibrational, electrical, and ferroelectric properties. Thermally diffused copper atoms in Sn2P2S6 bulk are in the metallic state, inducing a multiaxial expansion of the Sn2P2S6 unit cell for 2–3.4%. The energy reduction between indirect and direct optical transitions was observed, combined by small hardening for acoustic and soft optical vibrational modes originating in the partial substitution of Sn by Cu in the Sn2P2S6 crystal lattice. Similar to hydrostatic pressure, the structurally bonded copper initiates a small downward shift in the critical temperature Tc. The presence of copper has a substantial impact on the shape smearing of the ferroelectric domains as well as on the behaviour of the dielectric permittivity. The real part of the dielectric constant ε′ reaches its maximal value at intermediate concentrations of Cu 0% < x < 0.5%, showing an ∼20% increase with respect to the parent structure. The incorporated metal atoms provoke a monotonous expansion of the ferroelectric P–E loops along the increased dopant content direction. An increase in the electrical conductivity at higher Cu concentration reveals a trend for inducing a metal-like behaviour.
Introduction
Recent improvements in nanomaterial functionality revealed increased research interest in the customization of the optical, electronic, or magnetic properties of metal dichalcogenides by thermally induced post-growth doping.1–4 Multifunctional 3D and 2D metal thio- and selenophosphate semiconductors with a general chemical formula M2P2X6, where M = Sn, Pb, Cu, In, and X = S, Se, possess some unique features and properties.5,6 These compounds form a stable solid solution series with several high-order multicritical points on the concentration-temperature phase diagram, such as the tricritical (TP),7 Lifshitz (LP)8 or even tricritical Lifshitz (TLP)9 point, which present an opportunity for structural change investigations across I-order and II-order phase transitions. The coexistence of native metallicity and ferroelectricity in solid bulk crystals has been theoretically predicted over a half-century ago by Anderson,10 but was experimentally confirmed only in few materials.11–14 However, the real practical importance of the family of these single crystals is attributed to the structural changes of a crystalline lattice, in particular breaking the center of symmetry gives an origin to ferroelectric,15 piezoelectric,16 and pyroelectric17 properties. Also, Sn2P2S6 ferroelectric films reveal promising photovoltaic and photoelectric features.18
The listed physical parameters are essential for designing a new generation of electronic devices with significantly improved sensitivity and time response. For instance, the high piezoelectric activity of near room temperature ferroelectrics Sn2P2S6, whose Tc ≈ 337 K,19 can compete with well-known BiFeO3, currently one of the top choices for switchable ferroelectric diodes.20,21 Near room temperature spontaneous polarization of Sn2P2S6 can serve as a base for non-volatile ferroelectric random-access memory (FERAM) elements, at the same time significantly miniaturizing the designed systems.22 The first steps of such practical exploits have been recently observed for layered room-temperature ferroelectric CuInP2S6, demonstrating that reversible polarization switchability with an on/off ratio of about ∼100 can be achieved for ferroelectric flakes with the thickness reaching an impressive limit of ∼4 nm.23 Due to locally controlled ion conductivity and giant negative electrostrictive coefficients, CuInP2S6 is also considered as a solid electrolyte for boosting sodium and lithium battery performance.24 Similarly, 2D superparaelectric Sn2P2S6 with a large dielectric constant was also proposed for the same purpose.25,26 The high photoelectric conversion efficiency of Sn2P2S6 allowed exploration of the ultrafast shift-current behaviour,27 comparable only to the performance of SbSI,28 CdSe, and CdS.29 These properties can be utilised for the novel design of the band edge shift current based photovoltaic devices, pushing the solar cell energy harvesting towards their theoretical limit.18,30,31 Additionally, Sn2P2S6 ferroelectrics have prominent photorefractive properties in the near-infrared spectral region,32 which makes them suitable for highly efficient acousto-optic33 and holographic34,35 devices.
Many of the listed properties and uses of Sn2P2S6-like crystals can be further tailored by introducing defects in their crystal structure, such as distortions, atom vacancies, or isovalent dopants in anion and cation sublattices. For instance, the photorefractivity could be optimized via introducing Te,36 Sb,37 or Bi38 dopants or employing Sn vacancies, which act as hole traps.39 The rare large negative thermal expansion that originates from highly stereo-active lone-pair electrons of Sn2+ cations40 can be tailored through substitution of Sn(II) with Ge(II)/Pb(II) atoms.41 Similarly, the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity can be either favoured (Sn → Ge substitution) or suppressed (Sn → Pb substitution) in a long temperature interval due to the electron–phonon anharmonicity.42 Ferroelectricity, dielectric susceptibility, and pyroelectricity can be controllably altered as well in a similar manner.43,44 Finally, a chemically stable solid solution Sn2P2(SeyS1−y)6, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 is an indirect band gap semiconductor and a unique starting material for mild optical bandgap engineering via increasing Se doping, simultaneously improving light absorption in the near-infrared region.45
The above stated structural modifications were achieved by introducing a finite amount of dopant species already during the synthesis process. In contrast, in the current report, we present a set of comprehensive experimental evidence regarding the influence of post-growth chemical tailoring of Sn2P2S6, the most extensively studied ferroelectric within a family of M2P2X6 double-chalcogen crystals starting from nanolevel structural changes toward to macroscale property alterations.
Results and discussion
Incorporation and quantification of the Cu dopant in Sn2P2S6
The starting Sn2P2S6 single crystals were obtained by vapour-transport synthesis (Fig. 1a). First, the orientation of the crystal planes was determined using single-crystal X-ray scattering. In the next step, the single crystals were prepared for post-synthesis treatment (annealing). For Cu indiffusion, a pure Sn2P2S6 crystal was cut into a parallelepiped-shaped sample, with 5 × 5 mm2 faces. A Cu metal layer was deposited on one of the faces perpendicular to the [100] axis (top face), and the length of the crystal along the [100] direction was 8 mm. The Cu layer was achieved by a chemical deposition reaction (1), utilizing both a CuSO4 water solution and a “painted” metallic indium layer. CuSO4 + In = InSO4 + Cu↓(1)The sample with deposited Cu is shown in Fig. 1b. After surface metallization, the samples were thermally annealed under vacuum using a computer-controlled furnace. After several experiments with varied duration and temperature of sintering, the optimal conditions were found as T = 350 °C for 48 hours. After annealing, the surface of the sample prior to polishing appears grey and opaque, as shown in Fig. 1c. In the next step, the sample was polished to an optical quality (Fig. 1d). After removing the surface layer, it was possible to observe the difference in colour along the [100] direction, suggesting the presence of impurities within the side of interest (Fig. 1d); the darker parts of the crystal are considered to be Cu enriched, while the reddish transparent part corresponds to the nominally pure crystal region.

The physical dimensions are 8 mm, 5 mm, and 5 mm along [100], [010] and [001] directions, respectively; (e) XPS spectra of the Cu doped Sn2P2S6 acquired from opposite sides of the sample. The inset shows a dominant contribution of the Cu 2p3/2 peak; and (f) ToF-SIMS analysis of Cu+ ions revealing the distribution of copper in the depth of the crystal corresponding to the [010] direction. 
Since the copper concentration throughout the bulk is expected to be very low, a lot of attention was paid to the accurate quantification of Cu dopants in the Sn2P2S6 crystal, especially when considering a possible concentration gradient along the [100] direction. XPS is a technique-of-choice for trace-element analysis, and is applied here for the quantitative analysis of the dopant concentration. Before the XPS examination, the crystal was first sonicated in ethanol and further etched by Ar+ ions to remove approximately 5 nm of the surface layer. XPS spectra from opposite sides of the Sn2P2S6 crystal reveal that the visually darker section of the sample contains slightly higher copper content than the transparent region, with values of ≈0.5 at% and 0.1 at%, respectively (Fig. 1e). A similar amount of incorporated dopants has been achieved earlier by Grigas et al. for Ge, Te, and In impurities.46 However, in their study the dopants were incorporated directly during crystal growth. In our case, Cu atoms were indiffused by thermal post-processing of an already grown pristine Sn2P2S6 crystal. The time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profiles of Cu+ ions also unanimously confirm the presence of a concentration gradient of Cu dopants along the [100] direction (Fig. 1f). At the same time, the distribution of thermally diffused Cu atoms is fairly homogeneous. Note that on the undoped side of the sample, ToF-SIMS signals of copper were comparable to the noise level and thus do not appear (Fig. 1f).
It is reasonable to monitor the influence of Cu atoms on the local chemistry by checking possible binding energy shifts of dominating Sn 4d, P 2p, and S 2p peaks in the XPS spectra. Surprisingly, neither peak position shifts nor curve shape changes were observed, suggesting that the Cu atoms at such low concentrations have virtually no influence on the electronic orbitals of parent Sn, P, and S atoms. Quite the opposite has been previously observed for Ge dopants, which are supposed to act as cations in Sn2P2S6 crystal lattices. At similar concentrations, Ge can provoke an upward binding energy shift of Sn 4d and P 2p core levels of approximately 1–2 eV, as well as a downshift of the S 2p core level for a similar magnitude.46
By analysis of the high-resolution XPS spectra in more detail, it is possible to establish an oxidation state of the Sn and Cu in the crystal by comparing the positions of peak maxima with their theoretically predicted values. The most intensive peak corresponding to Sn 3d5/2 is at a binding energy of 486.0 eV, confirming that Sn is present as a cation with an oxidation state of 2+. Note that for the metallic state of Sn the line position is 485.0 eV. A typical spin–orbit splitting is observed as well with an energy distance of 8.5 eV. A similar finding was reported previously.47 In contrast, Cu found to be in its metallic state as the experimentally obtained value of 932.7 eV for Cu 2p3/2, which coincides with the theoretical value.48 There is no trace of any strong Cu2+ satellites near 943.0 eV and 963.0 eV as one would expect, which supports the above-stated conclusion.
The influence of copper thermal diffusion on possible structural modifications has been investigated at the nanoscale by utilizing high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) TEM experiments combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS) measurements of undoped and Cu-doped parts of the Sn2P2S6 ferroelectric crystal. To mitigate the sample preparation artefacts, the samples for TEM analysis were crushed in EtOH(abs) and the solution was transferred onto commercial Ni-supported amorphous carbon grids.49 The samples are highly beam sensitive and tend to decompose immediately upon exposure to the high-energy primary electron beam; therefore, a coherent illumination mode in combination with the smallest condenser aperture and a large spot size were used to minimize the beam radiation while obtaining atomically resolved micrographs.
The undoped part of the crystal exhibits an undisturbed crystal lattice, without any exsolutions or secondary phases, even at the nanolevel (Fig. 2). As expected, the chemical composition analysis by EDXS confirms the presence of only tin (Sn), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S); the quantitative estimation of the chemical composition using the Cliff–Lorimer thin-film approximation corresponds to stoichiometric 2–2–6 ratio. The crystal structure parameters calculated from SAED patterns correspond well with previously reported data for the monoclinic Pc phase, space group no. 7.50

Similarly, the TEM investigation of the Cu-doped crystal shows large regions of perfect crystal arrangement (Fig. 3a1 and a2). In contrast to undoped Sn2P2S6, the analysis of the SAED patterns showed relative expansion of the unit cell on the order of 2–3.4%, depending on the crystal axis direction. Local EDXS spot analysis (Fig. 3b) confirms the presence of Cu even in these coherently crystalline regions, and in combination with SAED results, we can conclude that the Cu is structurally bound. On the other hand, in several thin regions, we were able to detect small, up to 10 nm large precipitates (Fig. 3c), identified as CuS (covellite). Apparently, during the cooling of the crystal, the excessive Cu in the structure is not stable, leading to the break-down of the solid-solution and the precipitation of the CuS nanoexsolutions. Nevertheless, a significant amount of the Cu remains structurally bound, and only excessive Cu precipitated until the crystal structure became stable under ambient conditions. TEM observations, together with the results from XPS analysis, suggest that a majority of copper atoms are positioned interstitially in the crystal lattice at the most doped part of the sample. However, a partial Cu–Sn substitution or vacancy occupation might also occur, which could be reflected as changes in soft optical modes corresponding to the cation vibrations (see transient reflectivity measurements).

Optical bandgap control and Raman spectroscopy
A controllable bandgap tuning of lead-free ferroelectrics by means of metal dopants in the visible spectral range was the target of many researchers, where it could improve optical functionality, especially the photon-capture efficiency of the material.51–54 We aim to monitor the possibility of bandgap fine-tuning in our sample by post-treatment Cu incorporation (Fig. 4). The sample was virtually divided into three regions. Namely, the side without any sign of indiffusion (“undoped” – 0% Cu), the side with max doping (“doped” – 0.5% Cu), and the “central” part which lies somewhere between 0 and 0.5% Cu. The absorbance curve follows a general semiconductor behaviour showing strong absorption in the short wavelength region (<520 nm) (Fig. 4A). Curve shouldering appears as a result of an increase in the copper content. The bandgap energies were extracted by following a method described in the report.55 In contrast to a typical Tauc-plot evaluation, which is based on a linear extrapolation on the energy axis, the proposed method uses derivatives operating with curve maxima. Thus, the definition of direct and indirect bandgap energies is much more accurate. The extracted values are found to be similar to those published elsewhere.56,57 Cu atoms provoke a small energy reduction of the direct gap from 2.355 ± 0.001 eV down to 2.337 ± 0.001 eV (Fig. 4B). At the same time, the positions of indirect bandgap maxima reveal virtually no energy shift. Thus, an energy distance shrinkage between the two energy gaps is observed. This finding can be used for the possible tuning of Sn2P2S6 to a direct optical band semiconductor with improved absorption in the visible range of a spectrum, as well as improving or fine-tuning the photovoltaic properties of the material. The smaller interband distance implies that photons with slightly lesser energy will also be involved during electron–hole recombination processes, thus leading to better photovoltaic performance. After a more detailed inspection of Fig. 4B (see inset) two small humps can be observed for doped and central curves with a position of maxima located at ∼2.23 eV, which might correlate with the contribution of Cu atoms. Surprisingly, after dividing doped and central curves by the undoped curve, two asymmetrically shaped absorption peaks were found with a maximum at ∼556 nm corresponding to 2.23 eV (Fig. 4C). The increased area under the red curve signals a stronger contribution of metal impurities into an overall spectrum. Recently performed calculations applying the DFT and DFT + U methods suggest the formation of new electronic states between the conduction and valence bands in the paraelectric state of non-stoichiometric Sn2P2S6 with vacancies of Sn, P, and S.58 The observed absorption peak in the central and doped parts of the crystal suggest the formation of such defect (vacancies) electronic states inside the forbidden optical gap, caused by the presence of copper impurities.

The vibrational spectra of the doped sample collected at a liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) reveal neither major peak position shifts nor significant shape changes with respect to the undoped part of a crystal. This situation is expected for such a small concentration of impurities, and the results obtained are in good agreement with TEM and XPS data confirming no structural changes or strong influences on the chemical bonds of Sn2P2S6. However, a minor feature appears in the low-temperature Raman spectrum for the copper enriched part of a sample, where a small hump rises near 115 cm−1 (Fig. 4D, see the inset). The additional weak mode might be a result of local “polarization leakage”59,60 induced by the influence of copper on the intrinsic optical vibrations. Unfortunately, the lowest modes at frequencies (∼40 cm−1 and below) are inaccessible to the Raman setup employed in the current study, preventing the monitoring of possible mode changes of the cation sublattice. A separate pump–probe technique was required for such investigations.
Room-temperature transient reflectivity
Using femtosecond optical pump–probe measurements can excite and observe not only the soft modes, but also much lower energy acoustic phonons.61 In particular, coherent oscillations of the transient reflectivity due to acoustic phonons and the rotation of the plane of polarization of transient reflected light at the soft mode frequency have previously been reported in Sn2P2S6.61,62
Using a similar experimental setup and excitation parameters, we compare the transient reflectivity of the nominally pure and most concentrated Cu-doped Sn2P2S6 regions of our crystal. The results are presented in Fig. 5a and b. The soft-mode response of the undoped part of the crystal (Fig. 5b, top) is generally similar to the data reported in the literature, and it fits with a coherently excited oscillator with damping63 which yields 0.89 THz frequency of the soft mode.61,62 Remarkably, the Cu-doped part demonstrates much faster and initially more intense reflectivity oscillations followed by a negative long-lived component, in contrast to the positive long-lived component for the undoped region of Sn2P2S6. The change in sign could arise due to the changes in the band structure that affect the probe matrix elements, while the long-lived component may be due to the appearance of a non-equilibrium domain structure following the quenching by the pump pulse.64 Note that the change in the domain structure with doping is observed by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), see the following section. A similar fit now produces a frequency of 0.94 ± 0.01 THz and is very sensitive to the phase of the oscillation with respect to zero delay. Although a precise determination of the mechanism in low-symmetry crystals can be difficult as already noted,65 the best fit yields a phase of 0, suggesting impulsive excitation.66 We also note that the apparent oscillation of the doped region appears faster due to the different signs of the exponential and oscillatory components shown in Fig. 5b. One could suggest that the reason for such mode hardening in the case of Cu doping could be ascribed to the partial replacement of the Sn atoms by Cu with a smaller mass.

Spectra are shifted along the y-axis for clarity. (b) The angle of rotation of the polarization plane of the reflected probe beam vs. the time after the pump pulse excitation in pure Sn2P2S6 (top, blue open circles) and Cu-doped Sn2P2S6 (bottom, red open circles) with the corresponding theoretical fits. Measurements were conducted at room temperature (25 °C). 
The acoustic-frequency response arises due to the so-called moving-mirror effect (a reflection of the probe beam from the acoustic wave generated by a pump beam).67,68 The acoustic-frequency response of the undoped side of Sn2P2S6 (Fig. 5a) demonstrates the presence of multiple frequencies, seen as beats in the time-domain and resolved as peaks at 11.8 GHz and 28 GHz in the Fourier-transform. The larger frequency seems to be in the same range as 20 GHz reported for the longitudinal acoustic mode,61 with a difference that could be explained by the different speeds of sound: the 28 GHz frequency would correspond to 3.9 × 103 m s−1, the value that was reported earlier.69,70 Note that assigning 11.8 GHz to the acoustic longitudinal mode would imply a sound velocity of 2 × 103 m s−1 which is well below the values reported in the literature.69,70 The 11.8 GHz mode could correspond to another acoustic phonon, perhaps a transverse one (see dispersion in ref. 71). Usually, only longitudinal coherent acoustic phonons are expected to be excited by a pump pulse in a bulk crystal, however, recent studies demonstrate the possibility of transverse acoustic mode excitation.72 Interestingly, this very mode experiences ∼1.5 GHz hardening in the Cu-doped sample and also acquires a polarization-dependence (Fig. 5a, bottom), which brings us to the discussion of the 28 GHz mode behaviour as a function of doping, which also becomes polarization-dependent. For the undoped sample, the frequencies of coherent acoustic phonons do not depend at all on polarization, and the intensity dependence is very weak. In contrast, in the Cu-doped sample, it looks like splitting of the 28 GHz mode occurs with resulting modes having a slightly different polarization dependence as shown in Fig. 5a (bottom). This may correspond to a change in the strain tensor of the doped crystal.
Ferroelectric domain structures of undoped and doped Sn2P2S6
Possible changes in the ferroelectric domain structure have been investigated by PFM73 in undoped and Cu-doped portions of the Sn2P2S6 sample (Fig. 6). On the microscale, no significant difference in the ferroelectric domain structure was found in Fig. 6c and h, while on the nanometer scale, a difference in the shape of ferroelectric domains was observed (Fig. 6d, e and i, j). In both cases large ferroelectric domains (a few hundred nanometers) are present, however, in the undoped part, the domains are more rhombus-like with sharp edges in comparison to the ones in the Cu-doped part that are more irregular in shape. The PFM amplitude and phase hysteresis loops are shown in Fig. 6i and m, indicating a good domain-switching ability of both parts and, therefore, the ferroelectric nature of undoped and Cu-doped Sn2P2S6. The observed domain wall configurations of the nominally undoped region of the Sn2P2S6 crystal aligns well with previously reported results.74

Insets: Enlarged region showing the PFM out-of-plane amplitude and phase images of ferroelectric domains in the undoped (d and e) and Cu-doped (i and j) Sn2P2S6. (k) Schematic of the experimental set-up. (l and m) Local amplitude and phase hysteresis loops (2nd cycle) measured in the spot marked by a box in the PFM amplitude images (c and h). All measurements were performed at room temperature (25 °C). 
Typically, the domain wall configurations of the investigated uniaxial ferroelectrics consist of two types of flat domains. The neutral walls that are parallel to the mirror plane and the charged walls that are inclined with respect to the polarization vector deviate at an angle of about 14° from the [100] crystallographic direction of Sn2P2S6.74 In our case, we observe the areas with contours that are formed as a result of domain intersection with a plane perpendicular to the [100] direction. In the copper enriched part of the crystal, the investigated domain contour smearing is expected due to a non-homogeneous distribution of thermally diffused copper impurities within the tested area of the sample.
Dielectric properties and P–E loops
The local effect of incorporated metal atoms apart from the domain structure shape alteration is the influence of the dielectric properties of the material. We observed that copper provokes a phase transition smearing and a small reduction in critical temperature (Fig. 7a); this effect is similar to that reported for Pb atoms,7,19 which pushes Sn2P2S6 into the paraelectric regime. In contrast, incorporation of Ge cations into the structure moves a phase transition temperature towards higher values,43 which results in better ferroelectric activity of its electron lone pair and a smaller energy distance between Ge 4s and S 3p electronic orbitals. The interesting point here is that copper also has a free electron in the outer 4s shell; however, a downward temperature shift occurs for Tc. Such a behaviour can be explained as follows: despite having a free electron in the outer shell, copper does not improve the crystal's ferroelectricity. Thus, there is no reason for an upward temperature shift of Tc. On the other hand, copper atoms that have penetrated into the matrix interstitially provoke an effect, which is similar to that obtained from hydrostatic pressure,75,76 reducing the temperature of the phase transition. It is well established that a pressure of about 0.6 GPa induces a structural first-order transition in Sn2P2S6, while starting from above 1.5 GPa the stable paraelectric phase can be achieved.75,77 A further pressure increase gives rise to a semiconductor to polar metal transition at values above 38 GPa, evidenced from electrical and Raman measurements.78 Such a phenomenon in this crystal can be explained in terms of a Holstein–Hubbard like model while taking into consideration Jahn–Teller distortion and electron correlations.79 The isostructural chemical analogous with more covalent P–Se bonding, the transition to a metallic phase was found at pressure p > 20 GPa, whereas for the paraelectric crystal Pb2P2S6 metallization occurs exceeding 50 GPa.80 At elevated temperatures and ambient pressure, the increase of electrical conductivity in Sn2P2S6 indicates the transition to a polar metal phase above 850 K.58 The rapidly increased electrical conductivity in Fig. 7b might give a hint that the metallic-like behaviour can be achieved in a heavily doped crystal at lower temperatures if the introduction of copper into a structure of Sn2P2S6 significantly increases the number of free electrons.
 Fig. 7  (a) Dielectric permittivity in the vicinity of the second-order phase transition of the copper doped Sn2P2S6 ferroelectric measured at 10 kHz; (b) left axis: peak values of dielectric permittivity indicating the optimal concentration of Cu in the middle region of the crystal; right axis: electrical conductivity calculated from dielectric losses; and (c) room temperature hysteresis loops collected from the corresponding sections at a frequency of 10 Hz. Note that position “1” corresponds to the copper enriched part of the crystal, while position “6” corresponds to the undoped pure region of the crystal, which is considered to be equal to the parent pure crystal. Due to partial sample damage of the sample, (c) does not include a P–E loop of the corresponding part marked as “1”. 
The introduction of copper influences the electrical conductivity σ of the sample along the direction of a concentration gradient. Conductivity shows a parabolic behaviour that is mirror-like to the dielectric permittivity curve (Fig. 7b). The maximum for ε′ and minimum for σ lie in the “middle” of the crystal (sections “4” and “5”, Fig. 7b), where the concentration of copper is intermediate and falls within the range of 0% < x < 0.5% (given in atomic percentage, where x = Cu). It was found that the maximum value of ε′ observed is about 20% higher compared to the value obtained in the undoped part of the sample. This behaviour might be attributed to the following reason. Typically, freshly grown Sn2P2S6 crystals contain non-controlled defects mainly cation vacancies, which correlates with a deviation from an ideal stoichiometry; therefore, thermally incorporated Cu atoms can occupy some vacancies that may lead to partial charge compensation. Evidently, the “optimal” compensation occurs at the Cu concentration in the middle part of the sample corresponding to regions 4–5 (see Fig. 7b). After exceeding a certain saturation level, copper starts to penetrate interstitially acting as a charged point defect, simultaneously distorting/expanding the initial crystalline cell of Sn2P2S6 as was demonstrated from TEM measurements. The cell volume is slightly larger for the copper-enriched part of the sample. An increased number of structural defects together with covellite nano-exolutions that appear as a consequence of the interaction between chemically unbonded Cu and S atoms provoke a permittivity reduction, especially at the part of the crystal where the amount of copper is the highest.
The copper atoms also influence the ferroelectric properties: the well-saturated hysteresis loops are evidence of ferroelectric behaviour, while the sharp P–E loops are a characteristic feature for monocrystalline samples. The value of spontaneous polarization obtained for the undoped part of the Sn2P2S6 crystal is about 2 μC cm−2, which corresponds well with the previously reported values in the literature.81–83 However, some variation of this parameter is expected: following the report,84 the polarization has an orientational dependence where the largest value, ps = 14 μC cm−1, is obtained along the [101] direction. For the Cu-doped region, the polarization rises, reaching a maximum value of 10 μC cm−2 (Fig. 7c) observed along the [100] direction. The effect of copper is different from the one observed by Zamaraite et al.44 for Pb atoms, where the polarization drops with an increased Pb content due to the presence of lattice defects. However, the most surprising finding comes from a detailed examination of Fig. 7b and c, from which it is seen that the polarization loops do not follow a trend exactly in the same manner as the dielectric permittivity. To explain this situation, first bear in mind that the P–E loops represent only the reversible parts of the polarization, and one should take into account that the field-induced repolarization process depends on the defects in two ways: (i) the electric conductivity, which influences the screening effects; and (ii) pinning of the domain walls on the various intrinsic defects. From the observed P–E loops one can suppose that the indiffused Cu suppresses the pinning effects, which has a greater influence (on the field-induced repolarization) than the increased conductivity alone (i.e. namely screening). The difference between the P–E loops for samples 4 and 5 is rather small; besides, in the samples with a smaller Cu concentration other intrinsic defects, which can vary in different parts of the crystals, become more influencing. The observed sequence in the decrease of the reversible polarization (5–4–6) is considered as an artefact connected with the combination of all these factors. Note that the area enclosed within the loop gradually increases with an increasing dopant concentration showing a ratio of about ∼50. A coercive field for the copper enriched part is Ec ≈ 450 V cm−1, while for the undoped region this number is approximately 3-times lower. These values are somewhat smaller compared to those published in the pioneering article84 and might be related to the orientation of the sample as well as to crystal quality improvement.83
Conclusions
The post-synthesis fine-tuning through the incorporation of copper atoms and their influence on the structural, dielectric, vibrational, ferroelectric, and electric properties of the ferroelectric crystal Sn2P2S6 are presented. XPS and SIMS analyses confirm the gradient distribution of the copper content with the highest amount of 0.5% at the most concentrated part of the crystal. No shifts of Sn 4d, P 2p, and S 2p core levels were observed, confirming chemical inertness of Cu towards the parent atoms. In contrast to Sn, which has an oxidation state of 2+, copper is in the metallic state. However, the dopants have an impact on the optical, vibrational, and ferroelectric domain structure. In the first case, they provoke a slight reduction of a direct bandgap value, simultaneously shrinking the energy distance between the indirect and direct optical transitions. By penetrating into the crystal matrix interstitially, copper atoms provoke 2–3.4% structure expansion resulting in a small downward temperature drift of Tc, which is similar to the effect of hydrostatic pressure. Once Cu atoms are present within the crystal lattice, slight hardening for acoustic and optical phonon modes is observed. The ferroelectric domain shape smearing together with P–E loop expansion along the direction of the concentration gradient was detected. The dielectric permittivity reaches its maximum at the intermediate concentrations of dopants 0% < x < 0.5%, as stated earlier, where the crystalline structure is still not oversaturated with Cu atoms. The increase of electrical conductivity is observed at a higher copper content revealing the potential of possible crystal metallization.
Experimental
Synthesis and crystal growth
A simplified scheme of crystal synthesis is presented in Fig. 1a. The single-crystal materials were synthesized from high-purity elements Sn (99.99%), P (99.999%), and S (99.99%), employing the chemical vapour transport (CVT) method using a two-temperature zone furnace.85 After placing the starting reagents into an evacuated quartz tube, the homogenization process was started by keeping the ampoule at a temperature of 650 °C for one week. The next step was recrystallization of the obtained compound by vapour transport due to a temperature gradient created on the opposite sides of the ampoule, where the hot zone was 650 °C and the cold zone was 630 °C. The mass transport of elements was ensured by utilizing iodine gas. Furthermore, the cold zone was cooled down to 615 °C and held at that temperature until nucleation occurred. From that moment, the monocrystal growth took one month. At the end of the synthesis process, the hot part of the ampoule was empty, signalling complete mass transport and successful growth of the crystals.
XPS and ToF-SIMS analysis
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out on an XPS (PHI-TFA, Physical Electronics Inc., Chanhassen MN, USA) equipped with an Al-monochromatic source emitting photons at an energy of 1486.6 eV. The analyzed area was 0.4 mm in diameter. The high-energy resolution spectra were acquired with an energy analyzer operating at a resolution of 0.6 eV and a pass energy of 29 eV. The accuracy of binding energies was about ±0.3 eV. Quantification of surface composition was performed from XPS peak intensities, taking into consideration relative sensitivity factors provided by the instrument manufacturer.
Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry analyses were performed using a ToF-SIMS 5 instrument (IONTOF GmbH, Münster, Germany). The analyses were performed in an ultra-high vacuum of 1 × 10−8 mbar. The SIMS spectra of positive secondary ions emitted from the surface were measured by scanning a Bi+ ion beam with an energy of 30 keV over an area of 100 × 100 μm2 in size. Depth profiling was performed combining spectra acquisition and sputtering cycles using a 1.0 keV Cs+ ion beam over a 500 × 500 μm2 area. A penetration rate into the depth of the crystal under a surface ion bombardment was estimated to be 0.066 nm s−1.
TEM imaging
The crystal structure, chemistry, and phase composition of the samples were investigated using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100, Jeol Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) with a LaB6 electron source operating at 200 kV and additionally equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDXS, EX-24063JGT, Jeol Ltd) with 30 mm2 detection area and an energy resolution of 138 eV. High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) experiments were conducted using a double-tilt beryllium holder for tilting the sample into the appropriate zone axis, and micrographs were recorded with a slow-scan CCD camera (Orius SC1000, Gatan Inc., Pleasanton CA, USA).
Optical properties
A double beam UV-Vis spectrophotometer Perkin Lambda 1050 UV/Vis, (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham MA, USA) with an integrating sphere module was utilized to investigate absorbance over the spectral range of 400–800 nm with a resolution of 0.5 nm.
Raman spectroscopy
Inelastic photon scattering measurements were conducted by means of a confocal micro-Raman spectrometer (NTegra Spectra II, NT-MDT Spectrum Instruments, Moscow, Russia) equipped with a He–Ne laser operating at 633 nm wavelength. The system was equipped with a Peltier cooled CCD detector. The laser spot was focused via a 20× objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.40. Spectra were collected propagating along the [010] crystallographic axis of the doped and undoped parts of the same crystal using a back-scattering geometry and (HH) polarization configuration for excitation and detection.
Transient reflectivity
The undoped and Cu-doped polished surfaces to the [010] crystallographic direction of the same Sn2P2S6 crystal were studied in a standard pump–probe setup using a 50 fs linearly polarized laser pulse with a repetition rate of 250 kHz, similar to the one used in ref. 61. The 800 nm central emission wavelength was used for the probe beam (near-normal incidence), while the second harmonic at 400 nm was used for the pump beam (normal incidence); the size of the beams at the sample surface were ∼50 and 100 μm, respectively. The corresponding powers were 100 μW (probe) and 1.5 mW (probe). The change in the intensity of the reflected probe beam in the presence of the pump beam ΔR/R = (RP − R0)/R0, where RP and R0 correspond to the intensities in the presence and absence of the pump, respectively, was measured using a lock-in detection scheme with the pump beam intensity, modulated using an acousto-optic modulator at 2.7 kHz. The balanced photodetector also allowed for the determination of the rotation of the probe plane of polarization.
Atomic force microscopy—piezoresponse force microscopy (AFM–PFM) measurements
The ferroelectric domain structures of the undoped and Cu-doped parts of Sn2P2S6 were investigated using an atomic force microscope MFP-3D (AFM; Asylum Research, Molecular Force Probe 3D, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) equipped with a Piezoresponse Force Microscope (PFM) module. A Ti/Ir-coated Si tip with a radius of curvature of ∼20 nm was used (Asyelec-01, AtomicForce F&E GmbH, Germany). The spring constant and the resonance frequency of the cantilevers were 2 N m−1 and 70 kHz, respectively. The topography-high and deflection images and out-of-plane amplitude and phase PFM images were simultaneously obtained in the dual AC resonance-tracking mode. The frequency of AC electric field was ∼330 kHz. The local hysteresis loops were measured in the switching-spectroscopy mode73 with the following waveform parameters: the sequence of the increasing DC step signal was 20 Hz with a maximum amplitude of 200 V, and the sequence of the triangle envelope was 0.2 Hz and an overlapping AC signal of 5 V and 350 kHz. Three cycles were measured in the off-loop mode. Before measurements both regions of the undoped and Cu-doped parts of Sn2P2S6 were polished under the same conditions.
Dielectric properties
The investigated samples were prepared as plates with 2 × 3 × 1 mm3 dimensions with silver paste electrodes on the largest faces perpendicular to the [100] axis, which were nearly normal to the spontaneous polarization direction. The ferroelectric hysteresis (P–E) loops were measured using a standard Sawyer–Tower circuit equipped with a Burr-Brown 3584 high voltage, high-speed hybrid operational amplifier. The bipolar triangular voltage waveform was applied to the sample for the measurement of polarization. The frequency of the signal was varied in the range of 10–100 Hz. Dielectric characterization was performed with a Goodwill LCR-815 precision LCR-meter at temperatures from 332 to 340 K during the cooling cycle at a rate of about 0.1 K min−1 and frequencies ranging from 12 Hz to 100 kHz.

CuSO4 + In = InSO4 + Cu↓	(1)

 	Fig. 1  (a) Simplified scheme of the vapour-transport method used for crystal growth; (b) X-ray oriented non-polished Sn2P2S6 sample with deposited Cu layers before sintering; (c) the same non-polished crystal after thermal annealing (Cu, 48 hours, 350 °C); (d) the sample polished after thermal treatment with a concentration gradient of copper along the [100] direction (the darker part is doped and the lighter part is nominally pure). The physical dimensions are 8 mm, 5 mm, and 5 mm along [100], [010] and [001] directions, respectively; (e) XPS spectra of the Cu doped Sn2P2S6 acquired from opposite sides of the sample. The inset shows a dominant contribution of the Cu 2p3/2 peak; and (f) ToF-SIMS analysis of Cu+ ions revealing the distribution of copper in the depth of the crystal corresponding to the [010] direction.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Overview TEM micrograph of an undoped Sn2P2S6 crystal, showing a coherent structure in the [001] zone axis, without any exsolutions or precipitates; (a1) HR-TEM inset with (a2) the corresponding FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) pattern, indexed for the monoclinic structure; and (b) EDXS spot analysis spectra recorded on the central part of the crystal, confirming the presence of only the main constituents: P, S, and Sn, with minor carbon presence due to surface contamination.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) TEM micrograph of the Cu-doped crystal region, with (a1) HR-TEM and (a2) FFT inset showing the coherent crystal structure; and (b) EDXS spot analysis recorded over the same region showing the characteristic Cu energy lines. (c) Nanoexsolutions in a very thin part of the crystal, identified via the corresponding FFT patterns as CuS – covellite.	 

 	Fig. 4  (A) Absorbance spectra of Cu-doped Sn2P2S6 in the visible region; (B) calculated indirect and direct optical band gaps; (C) absorption peaks of copper impurities, shown by dividing “doped” and “central” curves by the spectrum of the nominally pure part of the sample; and (D) low-temperature normalised Raman spectra collected under back-scattering geometry irradiating along the [010] direction (b-axis) for the doped (red trace) and undoped (black trace) parts of Sn2P2S6 (polarization of the incident and collected photons was parallel to [100] (a-axis)).	 

 	Fig. 5  Influence of copper atoms on the vibrational properties of Sn2P2S6: (a) coherent oscillations of transient reflectivity in the undoped and Cu-enriched parts of Sn2P2S6 in the time domain (top) and the corresponding fast Fourier transforms (bottom). Spectra are shifted along the y-axis for clarity. (b) The angle of rotation of the polarization plane of the reflected probe beam vs. the time after the pump pulse excitation in pure Sn2P2S6 (top, blue open circles) and Cu-doped Sn2P2S6 (bottom, red open circles) with the corresponding theoretical fits. Measurements were conducted at room temperature (25 °C).	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Topography height (a and f), deflection images (b and g), and PFM (Piezoresponse Force Microscopy) out-of-plane amplitude images (c and h) correspond to the undoped and Cu-doped Sn2P2S6 regions, respectively. Insets: Enlarged region showing the PFM out-of-plane amplitude and phase images of ferroelectric domains in the undoped (d and e) and Cu-doped (i and j) Sn2P2S6. (k) Schematic of the experimental set-up. (l and m) Local amplitude and phase hysteresis loops (2nd cycle) measured in the spot marked by a box in the PFM amplitude images (c and h). All measurements were performed at room temperature (25 °C).	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Dielectric permittivity in the vicinity of the second-order phase transition of the copper doped Sn2P2S6 ferroelectric measured at 10 kHz; (b) left axis: peak values of dielectric permittivity indicating the optimal concentration of Cu in the middle region of the crystal; right axis: electrical conductivity calculated from dielectric losses; and (c) room temperature hysteresis loops collected from the corresponding sections at a frequency of 10 Hz. Note that position “1” corresponds to the copper enriched part of the crystal, while position “6” corresponds to the undoped pure region of the crystal, which is considered to be equal to the parent pure crystal. Due to partial sample damage of the sample, (c) does not include a P–E loop of the corresponding part marked as “1”.
