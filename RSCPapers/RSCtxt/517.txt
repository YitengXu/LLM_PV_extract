Introduction
Growing environmental concerns and an increasing energy demand drive the search for new, sustainable sources of energy. In 2001, the global energy consumption rate was 13.5 TW, of which more than 85% originated from fossil fuels.1 To meet future demands, which are estimated to reach 27 TW in 2050, new sustainable energy sources have to be found. While no single source will be able to meet all our energy needs, solar energy may go a long way to meet this formidable challenge.2 With 120000 TW of solar energy striking the surface of the earth at any given moment, it is by far the most abundant clean energy source available. Most energy sources that are currently being scrutinized (fossil fuels, wind, tide, hydropower, biomass) originate from solar energy. However, direct use of solar energy by e.g. solar thermal power or photo-voltaic solar cells is still limited, and only 0.04% of all energy is generated by photo-voltaics. By covering 0.16% of the surface of the earth with 10% efficient solar cells, 20 TWpeak of power could be generated.2 While 0.16% appears to be a small number, it should be realized that this corresponds to the surface areas of France and Germany combined. Covering such a large area with solar cells presents a daunting task, even when this is undertaken on a (de-centralized) global scale. Interestingly, the solar cell market is currently growing by 35–40% per year, and is one of today's fastest growing markets. With a total produced capacity of 1200 MWpeak reported for 2004,2 a sustained 35% annual growth rate would lead to a total installed capacity of 20 TWpeak in 2036.
One of the challenges with solar cells is that they only generate electricity during daytime. Hence, large-scale use of solar energy requires an efficient energy storage solution. So far, the only practical way to store such large amounts of energy is in the form of a chemical energy carrier, i.e., a fuel. Hydrogen is one of the prime candidates as a future energy carrier. It can be made by electrolysis of water, and upon combustion in a fuel cell it returns to its original form (water) without generating any harmful by-products. The future prospect of a so-called Hydrogen Economy has attracted much interest, and many research efforts are currently underway to develop new technologies for the production, storage, utilization, and transport of hydrogen.
The most straightforward method to produce hydrogen from water and sunlight is by coupling an electrolyzer to a solar cell array. The current generation of commercially available electrolyzers have electricity-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of up to 85%, which seems to make this an attractive route. However, to achieve a current density of ∼1 A cm−2 that is normally used in electrolyzers, a cell voltage of 1.9 V is required. Since the thermodynamic potential required for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen is 1.23 eV, the overall energy conversion efficiency has an upper limit of 65% (1.23/1.9). When combining the electrolyzer with a 12% solar cell, the overall conversion efficiency is limited to ∼8%.3
A potentially more attractive route is the use of photo-electrochemical cells. Here, the photo-active semiconductor is immersed in water and the photo-generated electrons and electron-holes are directly used to reduce and oxidize water, respectively. Since the photo-active area is the same as the electrochemically active area, much smaller current densities are allowed (10–30 mA cm−2). This results in lower overpotentials and higher overall energy conversion efficiencies.3 Moreover, the functions of solar cell and electrolyser are now combined in a single device, which is favourable in terms of packaging and overall systems costs.
This paper will start by describing the operating principles of photo-electrochemical devices for water splitting. The requirements on the materials properties will be discussed in detail, and we will outline how different device concepts, materials combinations, and purpose-built nano-architectures can be used to overcome some of the limitations imposed by conventional materials.
Photo-electrochemical water splitting
The principle of operation for a photo-electrochemical cell (PEC) for water splitting is presented in the energy diagram of Fig. 1. When the material is illuminated with photons that have an energy that is equal to or larger than the bandgap, electrons are excited from the valence band into the conduction band. In an n-type semiconductor, the electrons travel to the back contact and are transported to the counter electrode where they reduce water to form hydrogen gas. The electron-holes that remain in the valence band migrate to the surface, where they oxidize water to form oxygen gas.

The recombination of electrons and holes is prevented by the presence of an electric field close to the surface of the semiconductor. This field, indicated by a ‘bending’ of the energy bands in Fig. 1, is formed during the formation of a Schottky-type contact between the semiconductor and the aqueous electrolyte.4 During the formation of the Schottky contact, free electrons from the bulk are trapped into surface states at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. This sheet of negative charge is compensated by the remaining positive charges in the bulk, i.e., the ionized (shallow) donors.
Assuming that all the current that flows through the outer circuit corresponds to the water splitting reaction (i.e., absence of any competing side reactions), the overall solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of the device can be determined from the following expression: (1)Here, j is the photo-current density (A m−2), Plight is the incident light intensity in W m−2, Vredox is the potential required for water splitting, and VB is the bias voltage that can be added in series with the two electrodes in order to assist the water splitting reaction (Fig. 1). Vredox is usually taken to be 1.23 eV (at room temperature) based on a Gibbs free energy change for water splitting of 237 kJ mol−1. Alternatively, the enthalpy change (286 kJ mol−1) is sometimes used, which corresponds to a redox potential of 1.48 eV. There is some debate on which of these values is the more appropriate one for photo-electrolysis. Usually, the Gibbs free energy value is used which results in more conservative efficiency numbers.
Suitable photo-electrode materials for efficient solar hydrogen generation have to fulfil the following requirements:
1. Strong (visible) light absorption
2. High chemical stability in the dark and under illumination
3. Suitable band edge positions to enable reduction/oxidation of water
4. Efficient charge transport in the semiconductor
5. Low overpotentials for the reduction/oxidation reactions
6. Low cost
The spectral region in which the semiconductor absorbs light is determined by the bandgap of the material. The minimum bandgap is determined by the energy required to split water (1.23 eV) plus the thermodynamic losses (∼0.4 eV)5 and the overpotentials that are required at various points in the system to ensure sufficiently fast reaction kinetics (∼0.3–0.4 eV).6,7 As a result, the bandgap should be at least 1.9 eV, which corresponds to an absorption onset at ∼650 nm. The maximum value of the bandgap is determined by the solar spectrum shown in Fig. 2. Below 400 nm the intensity of sunlight drops rapidly, imposing an upper limit of ∼3.1 eV on the bandgap. Hence, the optimum value of the bandgap should be somewhere between 1.9 and 3.1 eV, which is within the visible range of the solar spectrum.
 Fig. 2  Intensity of sunlight versus wavelength for AM1.5 conditions. The grey area represents the part of the spectrum that can be absorbed by a hypothetically ideal bandgap of 2.03 eV.7 
Several authors have made predictions for the maximum attainable efficiency based on the bandgap of the material, the solar spectrum, and estimated values for the thermodynamic losses, overpotentials, optical reflection losses, etc.5–7 Most recently, Murphy et al. predicted a maximum efficiency of 16.8% for a hypothetically ideal material with a bandgap of 2.03 eV.7 Higher efficiencies can be obtained by using a multiple-bandgap system (see section on tandem cells below).
The second requirement, the stability against (photo-)corrosion, is a severe one that limits the usefulness of many photo-active materials. Most non-oxide semiconductors, such as Si, GaAs, GaP, CdS, etc. either dissolve or form a thin oxide film which prevents electron transfer across the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Almost all metal oxide photo-anodes are thermodynamically unstable, which means that the photo-generated holes are able to oxidize the semiconductor.4 However, if the kinetics of charge transfer across the interface (oxidation of water) are faster than the anodic decomposition reaction, photo-corrosion is avoided. For example, TiO2 and SnO2 show excellent stability over a wide range of pH values and applied potentials, while ZnO always decomposes in aqueous environments upon illumination. Fe2O3 represents an intermediate case, for which the stability appears to depend on the presence of dopants, pH, and oxygen stoichiometry.8,9 The general trend is that wide-bandgap metal oxide semiconductors are stable against photo-corrosion, while small bandgap semiconductors are not. While this is in obvious conflict with the requirement of visible-light absorption, it does not represent a fundamental limitation.
The third requirement implies that the conduction and valence band edges should ‘straddle’ the reduction and oxidation potentials of water. Specifically, EC should be above Ered(H2/H+) and EV should be below Eox(OH−/O2). Fig. 3 shows the band-edge positions of various semiconductors, along with the reduction and oxidation potentials of water. It should be noted that the data in Fig. 3 are drawn for a pH of 14, and that the reduction and oxidation potentials of water vary with −59 mV per pH unit. Most metal oxides (and even several non-oxide semiconductors) also show a −59 mV pH−1 variation in the flatband potential.17 For these materials, the band positions do not move with respect to Ered(H2/H+) and Eox(OH−/O2) and the diagram can also be used at different pH values. Fig. 3 indicates that most non-oxide semiconductors are able to reduce, but not oxidize water. Conversely, most oxide semiconductors are able to oxidize, but not reduce water. Since the stability criterion favors oxide semiconductors, the reduction of water appears to be challenging. In most cases, an externally applied voltage or a separate electrode compartment with a different pH is necessary to assist the reduction reaction.18 Indeed, only a few metal oxides have been demonstrated to be able to evolve both oxygen and hydrogen, and only SrTiO3 has been shown to photo-cleave water in a two-electrode system without any assistance.19 The efficiency was, however, less than 1% due to the large bandgap of the material (3.2 eV).
 Fig. 3  Energy band positions for various semiconductors at pH 14.4,10–16 When no experimental data were available for this pH, the band positions were extrapolated using −59 mV per pH unit. It should be noted that values reported in the literature show significant scatter, up to a few tenths of a volt. Most values shown here are for polycrystalline films, obtained using capacitance (Mott–Schottky) measurements and corrected for the difference between the flatband potential and the conduction band. 
The fourth requirement, that of efficient charge transport, is easily fulfilled by some materials, while in others it is the main cause of poor overall conversion efficiencies. The intrinsic electron and hole mobilities are determined by the electronic structure of the material.20 The conduction and valence band of most (but not all) metal oxides are primarily composed of metal 3d orbitals and oxygen 2 p orbitals, respectively.21 Hence, extensive overlap of the metal 3d orbitals will lead to high electron mobilities, while the amount of overlap between the O-2p orbitals determines the hole mobility. While orbital overlap arguments may provide some initial guidelines for evaluating the charge transport properties of a material, extrinsic factors such as the presence of defects often play a much more important role. Shallow donors or acceptors enhance the conductivity of a semiconductor, whereas defects with deeper lying energy levels usually act as recombination centers.
The fifth requirement implies that hole transfer across the n-type semiconductor/electrolyte interface should be sufficiently fast in order to compete with the anodic decomposition reaction. Furthermore, it should also be fast enough to avoid the accumulation of holes at the surface, as this would lead to a decrease of the electric field and a concomitant increase in electron–hole recombination. To improve the kinetics of hole transfer, catalytically active surface species can be added. Perhaps the best known example of an effective oxygen evolution catalyst is RuO2, whereas Pt is usually employed as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution.4,22
Photo-anode materials
In the above, we have outlined the basic working principles of photo-electrochemical cells and identified the main material's requirements. Despite extensive research efforts, mainly in the 1970s and early 1980s, no photo-active material has yet been found that fulfils all these requirements. However, the exciting progress made in the field of nanostructured materials during the last decade offers new opportunities for solar water splitting. We will illustrate this by discussing recent developments for two widely studied photo-anode materials, TiO2 and Fe2O3.
TiO2 has been the most extensively investigated material for photo-electrochemical and photo-catalytic applications. The main reason for its popularity is its excellent chemical stability, its low cost, and the fact that it is widely available. It is by far the most popular material for photo-catalytic oxidation of organic compounds in e.g.water purification. Efforts to use this material in a photo-electrochemical device date back to 1972, with the publication of Fujishima and Honda's landmark paper in which they first demonstrated the possibility to split water by shining light on a semiconducting photo-anode.18 Since TiO2 only absorbs UV light due to its bandgap of 3.2 eV, most research efforts were aimed at shifting the optical absorption towards the visible part of the spectrum. Some success has been achieved by doping the material with various transition metal ions, such as Fe and Cr.23,24 These dopants introduce additional energy levels in the bandgap, and excitation from these levels to the conduction band requires less energy than excitation of valence band electrons.
Although cation doping indeed results in a visible-light response, the absorption coefficient is usually very small due to low dopant concentrations (limited solubility) and small absorption cross-sections. To address this, work in our laboratory has focused on developing highly structured TiO2 photo-electrodes.25 The SEM image in Fig. 4a shows an example of a Cr and Fe co-doped TiO2 film made by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Extensive light scattering in such a morphology enhances the absorption coefficient, while the high aspect ratio of these fractal-like structures ensures that the photo-generated holes have to travel only short distances before reaching the surface. This minimizes the chance for charge trapping and recombination. The first fractal-shaped TiO2electrodes did not generate any photo-current under visible light, although sensitisation with Ru-based dye molecules resulted in a solar cell with an efficiency of 2.7%.25 Recently, however, we showed that fractal-shaped TiO2 can also generate photo-currents under visible light illumination by co-doping with Fe and Cr.26Fig. 5 reveals that fractal-shaped TiO2 films have a remarkably enhanced visible light response compared to undoped, dense TiO2. This enhancement is many times higher than observed for dense, smooth TiO2 films doped with Fe and Cr, indicating that the nanostructured morphology plays a crucial role. Fig. 5 also shows that the enhanced absorption of visible light comes at the cost of lower absorption at wavelengths below 350 nm. This is attributed to the shorter penetration depth of the light at these wavelengths, which leads to longer distances that the electrons have to travel before reaching the back contact and a higher chance of recombination at defect sites. An interesting (though unfavourable) phenomenon observed for these fractal-shaped films is that extensive degradation occurs during simultaneous exposure to light and to H2O or O2. Under these conditions the color changes from the original cinnamon-brown to white, and the optical absorption reverts back to that of undoped TiO2. While these films are of limited use for photo-electrochemical water splitting, it does illustrate that one can tune the material's properties by adopting suitable nanostructured morphologies.

 Fig. 5  Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of a fractal-shaped TiO2 photo-anode doped with Cr and Fe and deposited by CVD, compared to an undoped dense TiO2 film. The data for dense TiO2 were recorded at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in an aqueous 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (pH 13). Since the fractal-shaped TiO2 was unstable in water, its (short-circuit) photo-current was measured in a two-electrode cell using 0.5 M KI + 0.05 M I2 in propylene carbonate as the electrolyte. The optical absorption of the nano-TiO2 film shows a similar spectral shape as its IPCE. 
Although substitutional doping with metal ions can indeed be used to sensitize wide-bandgap semiconductors to visible light, it does not significantly improve the overall efficiency of photo-electrodes. This is because the dopants introduce defect states deep in the bandgap which act as recombination centers. In 2001, research interest in the sensitization of wide-bandgap metal oxides by doping returned after a paper by Asahi et al. on anion-doped TiO2.27 Quantum-chemical calculations indicated that the wave functions of anion dopants, such as nitrogen and carbon, show significant overlap with the valence band wavefunctions. The sub-bandgap defect levels are, therefore, less localized than for cation dopants, and recombination should be less severe. Nitrogen- and carbon-doping of TiO2 particles have indeed been shown to result in higher photo-catalytic activities.28–30
Attempts to incorporate carbon or nitrogen into thin film TiO2 photo-anodes have met with limited success. Spray pyrolysis of TiO2 under a CO2 atmosphere31 or a high-temperature treatment of TiO2 in a hexane-containing environment32 result in carbon concentrations that are too low for a significant change in the absorption spectrum. Interestingly, even a low concentration of carbon shifts the anatase-to-rutile phase transformation temperature from 600 °C to beyond 800 °C. This can be useful in the synthesis of TiO2-based photo-catalysts, since the anatase phase is the more active one. To increase the concentration of carbon in TiO2, the oxidative annealing of TiC films may be a more promising route.33 Sputter-deposition in a CO2 containing atmosphere may also lead to enhanced carbon concentrations. Lindgren et al. published some interesting work on nitrogen-doped TiO2 films deposited by reactive DC magnetron sputtering.34,35 An optimal concentration of nitrogen improved the white-light response by a factor of 200 compared to undoped TiO2. However, nitrogen doping also decreases the UV response,34 in a similar manner as observed for the metal-doped TiO2 films in Fig. 5. This suggests that recombination centers are difficult (if not impossible) to avoid when doping wide-bandgap semiconductors, regardless of whether anion or cation dopants are used.
An alternative approach is to start with a material that has an intrinsically small bandgap, such as α-Fe2O3 (hematite). This material has an orange-brown color and with a bandgap of 2.1–2.2 eV it readily absorbs light with wavelengths below ∼600 nm. Moreover, it is stable against photo-corrosion in aqueous solutions. Older work on Fe2O3 has already shown high photo-conversion efficiencies for polycrystalline Fe2O3 pellets9 and single crystalline Fe2O3 samples.36 For practical applications, however, thin films are preferred in order to avoid electrical conductivity limitations and to reduce the cost for fabrication. Several authors have reported the beneficial effects of dopants, especially Ti and Si, on the photo-electrochemical properties of α-Fe2O3.37–40 Recently, an exceptionally high photo-current of 2.7 mA cm−2 was reported at a bias of 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen (RHE) under simulated AM1.5 sunlight for Si-doped porous films synthesized using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD).41,42 The key ingredients for the high performance of these films seem to be i) Si doping, which is thought to induce a favorable morphology during film growth, ii) the presence of an ultra-thin (∼1 nm) SiO2 interfacial layer between the Fe2O3 and the transparent conducting substrate, and iii) the addition of a cobalt catalyst.
To investigate the effects of Si doping in more detail, we have deposited Si-doped Fe2O3 films by spray pyrolysis of an ethanolic solution of Fe(AcAc)3.43 First, the effect of a 5 nm SnO2 interfacial layer between the transparent conducting substrate and the Fe2O3 was investigated. Although this layer is significantly thicker than the 1 nm SiO2 interfacial film mentioned above42 (and non-insulating), a similar beneficial effect was observed. The current–voltage characteristics shown in Fig. 6 (left) reveal that the SnO2 layer shifts the photo-current onset potential to ∼0.2 V more negative values. This results in a photo-current increase from 0.04 to 0.33 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The right-hand side of Fig. 6 shows that the optimal Si concentration in the spray solution is ∼0.2% and ∼1% for films with and without the interfacial layer, respectively. Another effect of the interfacial layer is a significant improvement of the reproducibility of the photo-response, especially for undoped samples. Without the interfacial layer, photo-current variations of up to a factor of ∼5 or more are observed between samples made under the same conditions. With the interfacial layer, these variations are within a factor of 2.
 Fig. 6  Left: I–V curves in the dark and under simulated 80 mW cm−2 AM1.5 sunlight for Fe2O3 doped with 0.2% Si with (A) and without (B) a 5 nm SnO2 interfacial layer. Right: dependence of the photo-current on the Si doping concentration at 0.23 VAg/AgCl for Fe2O3 films with and without the interfacial layer. In both cases, an aqueous solution of 1 M KOH (pH 14) was used as an electrolyte. 
The fact that these films were dense (i.e., non-porous) allowed us to study the electrical properties by quantitative impedance spectroscopy. A donor density of 1 × 1020 cm−3 was found for films deposited from a spray solution containing 0.9% of Si, which is three orders of magnitude higher than for undoped Fe2O3 films (∼1 × 1017 cm−3).43 This shows that in addition to the structure-directing effect reported by Cesar et al.,41Si also acts as a donor-type dopant in Fe2O3. This is consistent with front- and back-side illumination experiments, which reveal that electron transport is rate limiting for undoped Fe2O3 films, whereas hole transport limits the photo-current in Si-doped films.43
Poor hole transport is one of the main factors that limit the photo-response of Fe2O3 photo-anodes. An elegant solution for this is to use high aspect-ratio nanowire electrodes, as illustrated in Fig. 7. By ensuring that the wires have a radius that is less than the hole diffusion length of Fe2O3 (2–4 nm38 or 20 nm),44 hole transport limitations can be avoided. The large specific surface area of a nanowire electrode addresses the intrinsically slow water oxidation kinetics by valence band holes.44 Since recombination at grain boundaries was found to limit the photo-response in particle-based photo-anodes,45 each wire should consist of a single crystallite.46 When the nanowires are sufficiently narrow, one-dimensional quantum confinement can occur. Vayssieres et al. have reported a significant blue-shift for α-Fe2O3nanorod arrays with a primary rod diameter of 4–5 nm.47 If the blue-shift manifests itself in an upward shift of the conduction band, direct reduction of water may become feasible without the need for an additional bias (cf.Fig. 3).47 Thus far, however, no one has succeeded to split water using α-Fe2O3 photo-anodes without assistance of a bias voltage.
 Fig. 7  Optimized morphology for an α-Fe2O3 photo-anode for water splitting. The small diameter of the nanowires ensures short hole diffusion path lengths. 
In addition to hydrothermal methods for Fe2O3nanowire growth on conducting substrates,47,48 thermal oxidation of metallic Fe can also result in high aspect-ratio morphologies.49–54Oxidation of iron foil in air at 800 °C leads to the nanowires with a diameter of 50–100 nm, as shown in Fig. 4B. At 450 °C, a similar treatment results in the formation of high aspect-ratio nanoflakes (Fig. 4C and D). These features have been observed at different labs, and can be readily reproduced. Photo-electrochemical measurements on thermally oxidized Fe foil show very high background currents and a photo-response of a few tens of μA cm−2 under AM1.5 illumination.55 This is due to exposure of the underlying metallic Fe/Fe3O4 substrate to the electrolyte, and can be avoided by using thin films of Fe that can be fully oxidized. However, for such films the thermal growth of nanowires seems to be less straightforward than for Fe foil. While sputter-deposited films have been reported to form nanowires upon oxidation,50,54 we have found different morphologies after oxidation of electrodeposited metallic Fe films, as can be seen in Fig. 4E and F.55 The 100 nm Fe2O3 film in Fig. 4E shows porous micron-sized features. When the thickness is doubled (Fig. 4F), the feature size becomes significantly smaller and some high aspect-ratio outcroppings are observed. The latter may be interpreted as the onset of nanoflake growth, and suggests a required minimum film thickness for nanowire growth by thermal oxidation. Clearly, further progress in this area requires a more detailed understanding of the growth mechanism during thermal oxidation.
Tandem cells
A closer look at Fig. 2 and 3 reveals that metal oxide semiconductors absorb only a small portion of the solar spectrum. By using a tandem cell approach, the remaining part of the spectrum can be used to provide the additional bias voltage required for the reduction reaction (i.e., to satisfy the criterion of suitable band edge positions). Augustynski and Grätzel used a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) to provide a bias voltage to a WO3 or Fe2O3 photo-anode. An efficiency of 4.5% has been published for the WO3-based photo-anodes,56 which is close to the theoretical efficiency that has been reported for this material.7 By using highly efficient dendritic α-Fe2O3 photo-anodes, overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies of 2.2% are within reach.42
Although biasing with a separate solar cell is attractive from an efficiency point of view, the fact that it involves two separate devices, each with its own electrodes and electrolyte (in the case of a DSSC), complicates the system and increases the cost. Several efforts have been made to design and fabricate a monolithic tandem cell, where multiple functional layers are combined into a single plate. When this plate is immersed in a solution and illuminated, hydrogen should evolve from one side while oxygen is formed on the other side. Turner et al. have successfully fabricated a monolithic tandem cell based on a p-type GaInP2 photo-cathode biased by a GaAs p–n junction solar cell.57 The solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency is 12.4% (based on the Gibbs free energy change of water splitting) under an illumination intensity of ∼11 suns. As pointed out by the authors, the use of concentrated sunlight is necessary due to the high cost of the device. The main problem, however, is that the lifetime of the tandem device is measured in hours instead of years due to severe photo-corrosion.
Licht et al. addressed the photo-corrosion problem by using efficient co-catalysts for H2 and O2 evolution (Pt and RuO2, respectively).22,58 They used a complex multiple bandgap system based on AlxGa1−xAs and Si p–n junctions to achieve a record 18.3% efficiency for water splitting. However, it should be noted that this system is composed of a small area tandem cell coupled to a large-area electrode for electrolysis. As this state-of-the-art device is composed of about 10 layers of high-quality thin film semiconductors, the main challenges for this approach are scale-up and cost reduction.56 It is not a priori clear whether such a system will be cost effective in a solar concentrator system. Practical design issues and light scattering by evolving gas bubbles limit the illumination intensity to an estimated 10–20 suns.57 For comparison, photo-voltaic concentrator systems based on these materials usually operate at light intensities exceeding 100 suns.59
Miller et al. used a triple-junction amorphous silicon photo-voltaic cell in combination with efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts.60 Amorphous silicon (a-Si) is much cheaper than GaAs-based materials and requires less energy to process. Sputter-deposited NiMo and Fe:NiOx were used as hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts, respectively. These materials are pure electrocatalysts, i.e., they are not photo-active. A solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 7.8% was achieved for a small-area prototype device (<1 cm2). Both catalysts showed excellent resistance against (photo-)corrosion. It should be noted that the photo-active area is not the same as the electrochemically active area, since the catalysts are not transparent for visible light. To address this, one of the a-Si junctions is replaced by Fe2O3 or WO3.61 So far, the a-Si/WO3 hybrid photo-electrodes show solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies of 1% in outdoor tests.62 A particular challenge for these systems is to deposit the metal oxides at sufficiently low temperatures (<300 °C) in order to avoid degradation of the underlying a-Si junctions. Aerosol spray pyrolysis requires a temperature of ∼400 °C and cannot be used. With reactive sputtering the substrate temperature could be kept below 200 °C at the cost of being a more expensive technique.
Photo-catalyst particles in suspensions
From the previous sections it becomes clear that the search for suitable photo-anodes for water splitting is severely hampered by the many requirements that the materials have to fulfil. An alternative approach is to simply disperse a photo-catalyst powder in water. This eliminates the need for a conducting substrate so that conventional high-temperature solid-state synthesis routes can be used, allowing complex, single-phase compounds to be made with relative ease. Co-catalysts (see below) can be easily added in the desired quantities by simple mixing and firing. Scale-up is readily accomplished and allows accurate chemical analysis of the evolved gasses, even at very low efficiencies. As such, these systems also provide a convenient screening method for selecting suitable photo-anode materials.
For particulate systems, the reduction and oxidation reactions both have to take place at the surface of a single particle, as illustrated in Fig. 8. To enhance the kinetics and to avoid chemical recombination of H2 and O2, small amounts of co-catalysts, such as Pt, NiOx or RuO2 are deposited onto the photo-catalyst's surface to ensure that H2 and O2 evolve at spatially separated sites. Typical loadings are 1–3 g of catalyst powder per 1000 ml H2O, and co-catalyst loadings of 0.5–1% vs. the amount of photo-catalyst. The aqueous slurry is contained in a closed pyrex glass cell which is illuminated using fluorescent tubes (‘black-light’), or high-power xenon or high-pressure mercury lamps. By connecting the cell to a closed gas circulation system, the amounts of evolved hydrogen and oxygen can be determined on-line with gas chromatography.
 Fig. 8  Left: one-pot system containing a suspension of photo-catalyst particles in water. Illumination occurs either from the side or from the top of the reaction vessel. The hydrogen and oxygen need to be separated to avoid explosive mixtures. Right: energy diagram for a particle-based photo-catalyst for water splitting. For very small particles (<100 nm), the electric field inside the particles is negligible. To avoid electron–hole recombination, co-catalysts (here shown only for the reduction reaction) are added to enhance the surface reaction rates. 
In many cases, the photo-catalyst is only able to evolve either hydrogen or oxygen gas, not both at the same time. If only hydrogen (oxygen) evolves, a sacrificial electron donor (acceptor) must be present to ensure the stoichiometric consumption of electrons and holes. While sacrificial systems are of considerable technical interest as they permit the study of electrode reactions, they cannot be used as a commercial hydrogen source due to the consumption of high-value (in terms of energy and cost) compounds, such as methanol, EDTA, formic acid, etc. Examples of oxygen evolution photo-catalysts are BiVO463,64 and WO3.65 AgNO3 or Ce4+(aq) are often used as electron acceptors (or electron scavengers) in these systems. Oxygen gas is sometimes used as an electron scavenger in other photo-oxidation reactions. Hydrogen evolution photo-catalysts appear to be more common, examples include InVO4,66 Bi2RNbO7 (R = Y, rare earth),67 and BaCr2O4.68Methanol is almost always used as a sacrificial electron donor (hole scavenger), but other hole scavengers such as EDTA and formic acid may also work.

Table 1 presents an overview of recently reported suspension-based photo-catalyst systems that are able to split water in a H2 : O2 ratio of 2 : 1 without the need for any sacrificial agents. Co-catalysts are required in all cases and the reported efficiencies are low, especially in the visible-light region. In addition to the straightforward single component systems, several other systems have been studied. In all cases, the main goals are to i) spatially separate hydrogen from oxygen to prevent chemical recombination and ii) provide different surfaces with different catalytic activities for hydrogen and oxygen evolution. In the layered perovskite compounds (Table 1), water molecules are able to diffuse spontaneously into the crystal structure of the material where photo-oxidation takes place. The oxygen diffuses back to the surface through the interlayers, while photo-reduction takes place at the surface of the co-catalyst.69 In the composite particles, an n–n heterojunction forms between two different particles. Due to the different energetic positions of the conduction and valence band edges, the electrons are transported to one particle, while the holes move to the other particle. In the mixed-particle system, this concept is taken a step further by performing the oxidation and reduction of water on two different particles that are not in direct contact with each other. To ensure a complete redox reaction at each individual particle, an I−/IO3−redox mediator is used to transport electrons from the oxygen evolving particles to their hydrogen evolving counterparts.70

There are also some disadvantages of using powder photo-catalysts. It is often difficult to determine the actual number of photons that is absorbed by the suspension, which prohibits accurate efficiency measurements. When reactivation of the catalyst is necessary, the filtration process needed to separate the catalyst from the water is not very convenient. Furthermore, hydrogen and oxygen are produced in the same reactor volume, forming an explosive mixture, and need to be separated immediately afterwards. This not only represents a safety issue, the separation also costs energy and lowers the overall efficiency of the process. Ritterskamp et al.76 recently published some interesting work on TiSi2 photo-catalysts for which the mixing of H2 and O2 is no longer a problem. Upon irradiation only hydrogen evolves, while oxygen remains adsorbed at the TiSi2 surface. It can be released by heating the catalyst to 100 °C, allowing easy separation. A conversion efficiency of ∼4% has been reported for this system, which does not take into account the amount of energy needed to heat the suspension.
Finally, it should be realized that the efficiencies for powder photo-catalysts are significantly lower than for photo-anodes in a photo-electrochemical cell. A very good powder photo-catalyst for visible light water splitting generates perhaps 200 μmol H2 per gram of catalyst per hour,71 although much smaller values are also considered promising.66 In contrast, a 1 μm thick Fe2O3 film that shows a photo-current of 2 mA cm−2 (ref. 42) produces hydrogen at a rate of ∼70 mmol g−1 h−1, i.e. 350 times more.
Conclusions
The operating principles of photo-electrochemical cells for solar water splitting have been described. The severe requirement of stability against (photo-)corrosion in an aqueous environment limits the choice of the photo-anode material to metal oxides. TiO2 photo-anodes show excellent chemical stability and charge transport properties, but the large bandgap limits the efficiency. Doping may enhance the optical absorption, but not the photo-electrochemical performance since it appears impossible to avoid the presence of deep defects that act as recombination centers. α-Fe2O3 has a nearly ideal bandgap, absorbs visible light and shows good chemical stability under the right conditions. Its performance can be enhanced by moderate use of (shallow) dopants to improve the electronic conductivity, and by introducing a thin interfacial layer that presumably improves the alignment of the band edges. High aspect-ratio morphologies, such as nanowires, can be used to overcome the poor hole transport properties and the slow surface reaction kinetics. A growing interest in complex oxides is expected to lead to a much broader choice in photo-active materials, and current research efforts on powder photo-catalysts offer a convenient route towards the selection of suitable photo-anode materials. Further improvements in the field of solar hydrogen production can be expected as new, low-cost and low-temperature techniques for the controlled synthesis of metal oxides are developed.

The data for dense TiO2 were recorded at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in an aqueous 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (pH 13). Since the fractal-shaped TiO2 was unstable in water, its (short-circuit) photo-current was measured in a two-electrode cell using 0.5 M KI + 0.05 M I2 in propylene carbonate as the electrolyte. The optical absorption of the nano-TiO2 film shows a similar spectral shape as its IPCE.	 

 	Fig. 6  Left: I–V curves in the dark and under simulated 80 mW cm−2 AM1.5 sunlight for Fe2O3 doped with 0.2% Si with (A) and without (B) a 5 nm SnO2 interfacial layer. Right: dependence of the photo-current on the Si doping concentration at 0.23 VAg/AgCl for Fe2O3 films with and without the interfacial layer. In both cases, an aqueous solution of 1 M KOH (pH 14) was used as an electrolyte.	 

 	Fig. 7  Optimized morphology for an α-Fe2O3 photo-anode for water splitting. The small diameter of the nanowires ensures short hole diffusion path lengths.	 

 	Fig. 8  Left: one-pot system containing a suspension of photo-catalyst particles in water. Illumination occurs either from the side or from the top of the reaction vessel. The hydrogen and oxygen need to be separated to avoid explosive mixtures. Right: energy diagram for a particle-based photo-catalyst for water splitting. For very small particles (<100 nm), the electric field inside the particles is negligible. To avoid electron–hole recombination, co-catalysts (here shown only for the reduction reaction) are added to enhance the surface reaction rates.
