    , Accepted 14th May 2017First published on 15th May 2017AbstractAn electrocatalytic and stable nickel oxide (NiOx) thin layer was successfully deposited on an n-Si (100) substrate by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), acting as a photoanode for efficient photo-oxidation of water under solar illumination. It was revealed that the formed n-Si/NiOx heterojunction with good Schottky contact could improve photogenerated charge separation, and thus n-Si photoanodes deposited with a 105 nm-thick NiOx electrocatalytic layer exhibited a photovoltage of ∼350 mV, leading to greatly improved photoelectrochemical performances for water oxidation. The stability of the photoanode was significantly enhanced with the increasing thickness of NiOx protective layers. This study demonstrates a simple and effective method to enable the use of planar n-Si (100) substrates as efficient and durable photoanodes for practical solar water oxidation.
Introduction
Solar energy is considered to be an ideal sustainable and clean-energy alternative to fossil fuels, eliminating negative and irreversible environmental issues.1–3 However, because of its inherent intermittency, it is necessary to store solar energy in the form of H2 or other chemical fuels.4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been believed to be a viable solar energy storage approach by providing photoexcited charge carriers for solar fuel synthesis,5–7 since a PEC cell was firstly demonstrated in 1972 by Fujishima and Honda, using Pt and TiO2 as the counter electrode and the photoanode, respectively, for solar water splitting.8
Silicon (Si) has been considered as one of the most promising candidates for solar cells and PEC devices owing to its earth abundance and narrow bandgap (Eg = 1.1 eV). Compared with wide bandgap semiconductors, Si, with an optical absorption profile which matched relatively well with the solar spectrum, can absorb visible and near infrared light. However, due to inherent Fermi level pinning (FLP) at the surface states, the slow charge-transfer kinetics greatly limit the photoconversion efficiency of Si-based photoelectrodes for solar water splitting. Furthermore, Si (either n-Si or p-Si) is very easily corroded or passivated when directly interfacing with electrolytes.9 To protect and activate Si photoelectrodes for stable and efficient water splitting, overlayers of different materials including transition metals (e.g., Ni (ref. 10) and Co (ref. 11)) and their oxides (e.g., MnOx,12 Fe2O3,13,14 CoOx (ref. 15 and 16) and NiOx (ref. 17 and 18)), metallic phosphides,19 wide band gap semiconductors (e.g., TiO2,20–22 WO3 (ref. 23 and 24) and ZnO (ref. 25 and 26)), transparent conducting oxides,27–29 organic polymers,30–33etc. have been deposited or coated onto the surface of bare Si electrodes. The obtained heterojunction structures showed greatly enhanced stability by preventing Si from corroding and/or provided a stable Schottky barrier to assist photogenerated charge separation.26,34 Instead of the troublesome Si/electrolyte interface, the overlayer/electrolyte interface could improve the charge carrier migration kinetics by eliminating the effect of FLP.
Especially for n-Si used as a photoanode in strong alkaline electrolytes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it is really important to prevent surface oxidation of n-Si by photoinduced holes to achieve prolonged PEC stability.16,22 Thus, a couple of stable metal oxides have been investigated for coating onto the surface of n-Si photoanodes as protective layers, including CoO,16 NiO,18 TiO2,22etc. Typically, as an effective OER electrocatalyst in aqueous alkaline solutions,35,36 NiOx could also serve as a good protective layer for n-Si photoanodes against corrosion.17,18,37 Sun et al. demonstrated that a reactively sputtered NiOx layer deposited on an n-Si substrate could simultaneously protect n-Si against corrosion for 686 hours of continuous PEC operation as well as catalyse the water oxidation reaction at a photocurrent-onset potential of +150 ± 20 mV relative to the water oxidation potential (E0′(O2/H2O) = 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at pH = 14).18,38 So far, the electrocatalytic and protective NiOx layer has been coated onto the n-Si substrate by atomic-layer deposition (ALD), magnetron sputtering deposition and spin-casting.16,18,27 In comparison to other methods, PLD has several unique features: 1) fabricates the film in a wide range of pressures of oxygen or other gases, 2) has a high deposition rate, and especially 3) maintains the stoichiometry of the target material in the film and even grows oriented crystalline films at room temperature due to the high kinetic energies of the ionized and ejected species in the laser plumes.39–41 To our best knowledge, there is still no report on n-Si/NiOx photoanodes prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) for stabilized and enhanced PEC performance for water splitting.
In this study, we report the successful fabrication of an inexpensive NiOx thin layer-deposited n-Si photoanode by PLD for the first time, which is used for water oxidation in 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte. Expected to be a protective layer to prevent surface corrosion or passivation of n-Si photoanodes, the NiOx thin layer also serves as an effective OER catalyst which assists in the improvement of surface kinetics. Furthermore, the formed n-Si/NiOx heterojunction provides a photovoltage to reduce the oxygen evolution overpotential. In this system, after optimizing the layer thickness and electrochemically activating the NiOx catalytic layer, an average photovoltage of ∼350 mV was achieved for the as-deposited n-Si/NiOx photoanodes relative to the p+-Si/NiOx anode. This study demonstrates that the PLD approach could be effective and flexible for designing efficient and stable n-Si-based heterojunction photoanodes for solar water splitting, and different materials could, in principle, be optimized by the PLD process as protective and catalytic layers for other semiconductor photoelectrodes.
Experimental
Fabrication of NiOx-deposited n-Si photoanodes
Moderately phosphorus-doped (100) n-type silicon (n-Si) wafers with a thickness of 400 μm (ρ = 0.1–1 Ω cm) used for NiOx deposition were cleaned with acetone (10 min), ethanol (10 min), and deionized (DI) water (18.25 MΩ cm, 10 min), respectively, and then immersed in 5 wt% HF solution (5 min) to remove the native oxide layer. The HF-etched n-Si wafers were rinsed in DI water, dried gently with N2 and immediately transferred to the PLD deposition chamber to minimize oxidation. The NiOx thin film was deposited on the n-Si substrates by PLD (Pioneer 180, Neocera Co., Ltd) using a NiO target (99.99%, Hefei Ke Jing Materials Technology Co., Ltd). During deposition, the O2 pressure in the chamber was maintained at 30 millitorr (mT) and the temperature was controlled at room temperature. By changing the laser pulse number from 1000 to 5000 shoots, NiOx layers of different thicknesses were deposited on n-Si substrates, and the obtained NiOx-deposited n-Si films were labelled n-Si/NiOx (m), m = 1000 s, 3000 s and 5000 s, where m is the laser pulse number. Heavily boron-doped (100) p+-type silicon wafers with a thickness of 515 μm (ρ < 0.005 Ω cm) were used as the corresponding dark electrodes for illustrating the photovoltage in cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. For the preparation of electrodes, a Ga–In eutectic alloy was scratched into the back of the n-Si/NiOx and p+-Si/NiOx wafers to form ohmic contact,23 and in the ohmic contact area, copper wires were connected to the Si wafers using conductive silver glue.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7800F) operated at 3.0 kV. The chemical compositions of the samples were recorded by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Axis UltraDLD, Kratos) with monochromated aluminum Kα radiation. Charge calibration was performed by correcting the C 1s line of adventitious carbon set to 284.8 eV to compensate for the charge effect. The fabricated photoanodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a PANalytical X'pert MPD Pro diffractometer (Netherlands) equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation source operated at 40 kV and 40 mA.
PEC and electrochemical measurements
CV measurements were carried out on a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm) in a three-electrode cell system. The as-prepared photoanode, a platinum plate and an Ag/AgCl electrode were employed as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The PEC measurements of the n-Si/NiOx photoanodes were conducted under light illumination in 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte (pH = 13.6). A 300 W xenon lamp (100 mW cm−2) with adjustable power settings through an AM 1.5 G filter (Oriel) was utilized as the light source. The corresponding CV measurements of the p+-Si/NiOx anodes and the homologous dark current density measurements of the n-Si/NiOx photoanodes were conducted in 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte in the dark.
Results and discussion
A NiOx thin layer was deposited on the surface of an n-Si substrate by PLD at room temperature, and the obtained n-Si/NiOx heterojunction was used for PEC water oxidation in 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution (aq) (Fig. 1a). The as-deposited n-Si/NiOx electrodes were characterized by XPS, to investigate the elemental chemical states of Ni in the NiOx thin layer. As shown in Fig. 1b, three main peaks for Ni 2p3/2 were observed at binding energies of 853.1, 855.3, and 860.9 eV for all these three NiOx/n-Si electrodes, indicating that the Ni element mainly existed in the +2 state.36,42 The XRD patterns of the n-Si substrate and n-Si/NiOx electrodes are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). One can only observe the characteristic peaks originating from the n-Si (100) substrates,36 rather than the crystallized NiOx, which indicates that the PLD-deposited NiOx thin layers were amorphous.

Fig. 1c, e and g show the cross-sectional SEM images of the NiOx thin layers deposited on n-Si wafers. It is clear that the thickness of the NiOx layers varied from 65 nm to 105 nm, greatly depending on the laser pulse number increasing from 1000 s to 5000 s. One can observe that the surface of the n-Si/NiOx (1000 s) photoanode was full of pinholes (Fig. 1d), which may be the main reason for the corrosion of the n-Si substrate when interfacing with the alkaline electrolyte. With the laser pulse number increased from 3000 to 5000 s, all the pinholes were gradually refilled (Fig. 1d, f and h), indicating that the n-Si substrate could be effectively protected by the thickened and dense NiOx thin layer.
As previously reported, NiOx as an OER catalyst undergoes an electrochemical activation process during CV scans.27,36,43 Therefore, before the PEC measurements, the n-Si/NiOx photoanodes were activated by 25 cycles of CV scans under simulated solar illumination, with PEC behaviours shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The n-Si/NiOx (1000 s) photoanode showed a rapid decrease in photocurrent density during the initial 3 CV cycles under anodic conditions (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The poor stability of the n-Si/NiOx (1000 s) photoanode should be related to the pinholed and thin NiOx layer that can hardly protect the photoanode from serious surface oxidation even during the initial activation process. An insulative SiO2 layer formed between the NiOx thin layer and the n-Si substrate would then block the photogenerated holes transporting from the n-Si substrate to the NiOx layer, ending the OER at the surface of the photoanode. The n-Si/NiOx (3000 s) photoanode underwent a slight electrochemical activation process from the 1st scan to the 25th scan (Fig. S2b, ESI†). In this process, the onset potential and the overpotential were slightly improved during the cycled CV scans. However, the photocurrent density of the n-Si/NiOx photoanode (3000 s) also decreased after 30 cycles of CV scans, owing to the growth of the native oxide on the Si substrate. These observations reveal that with the NiOx layer being deposited and electrochemically activated, the n-Si photoanode had improved surface kinetics and then the formed n-Si/NiOx heterojunction assisted photogenerated charge separation; however, the NiOx thin layers with pinholes could not effectively protect the n-Si photoelectrodes from surface oxidation. For the n-Si/NiOx photoanode (5000 s), an electrochemical activation process could be clearly observed during the cycled CV scans as well as in the corresponding Tafel plots (Fig. S2c and d, ESI†). In the 1st CV scan, the OER photocurrent density reached 1.0 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 177 mV relative to E0(O2/H2O), and the Tafel slope was 72.2 mV dec−1 at 1.0 mA cm−2. In comparison, at the 20th scan, a reduced overpotential of 163 mV was required to achieve the same photocurrent density and the corresponding Tafel slope dropped to 63.1 mV dec−1. To verify the electrochemical activation of the NiOx layer, Ni 2p XPS spectroscopy was conducted with the n-Si/NiOx photoanode (5000 s) before and after the 25th CV cycle (Fig. S2e, ESI†). As compared to the as-deposited n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanode, two additional peaks at 856.9 and 862.9 eV were observed for the activated photoanode,36 which indicates a transformation from NiOx to Ni(OH)2/NiOOH.44,45 As previously reported, when the as-prepared n-Si/NiOx photoanode was immersed in alkaline solution, an α-Ni(OH)2 thin film would be spontaneously formed on the surface of the NiOx layer. With charging, the α-Ni(OH)2 could be oxidized to form γ-NiOOH. Meanwhile, the γ-NiOOH would be converted back to α-Ni(OH)2 through discharging, which creates an α-Ni(OH)2 ↔ γ-NiOOH (α ↔ γ) cycle. In the continuous electrochemical activation scans, α-Ni(OH)2 was aged and then transformed to β-Ni(OH)2 owing to dehydration and recrystallization. Similar to the α ↔ γ cycle, the homologous generated β-Ni(OH)2 ↔ β-NiOOH (β ↔ β) cycle was also in progress. Furthermore, with aging, the α ↔ γ cycle gradually became a β ↔ β cycle.46–50 As seen in Fig. S2c and d,† the continuously reduced overpotential and Tafel slope indicate that the mixed β-Ni(OH)2 and β-NiOOH thin layer had superior catalytic activity as an effective OER catalyst.46,47 The aged β-NiOOH catalyst could turn back to γ-NiOOH at high anodic potentials owing to overcharging.46–50

Fig. 2a shows the effect of the different NiOx thicknesses on the PEC behaviour of the n-Si/NiOx photoanodes towards the OER under 1 Sun of simulated solar illumination, after electrochemical activation. Due to the small thickness (∼65 nm) of the NiOx layer with pinholes on the surface, the PEC activity and stability of the n-Si/NiOx (1000 s) photoanode were really poor, as it suffered from surface self-oxidation of n-Si. In comparison, when the NiOx thickness increased to 85 nm and 105 nm, the n-Si/NiOx (3000 s) and n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanodes exhibited considerable PEC performances for water oxidation with saturation photocurrent density reaching as high as ∼26 mA cm−2. Fig. 2b shows the typical CV curves of the n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanode under 1 Sun of simulated solar illumination, in comparison to the p+-Si/NiOx (5000 s) anode in the dark. With the external bias reaching 1.60 V vs. RHE, the p+-Si/NiOx (5000 s) anode began to drive the water oxidation reaction, whereas only an external bias of 1.30 V vs. RHE was required by the n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanode. This means that a photovoltage of ∼300 mV was generated from the n-Si/NiOx Schottky junction, giving rise to the improved PEC performance of the n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanode for solar water oxidation. That is to say, for these NiOx-deposited n-Si photoanodes, a lower external bias was required to maintain the same current density or a higher current density was obtained under the same external bias. For example, to achieve a water oxidation current density of 10 mA cm−2, overpotentials of 267 ± 20 mV and 623 ± 77 mV relative to E0(O2/H2O) were required by the n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanode and p+-Si/NiOx (5000 s) anode, respectively, indicating that the overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2 OER current density dropped by ∼350 mV for PEC water oxidation. The Tafel plots extracted from the CV scans in Fig. 2b show that the Tafel slopes at the current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 were 87.8 mV dec−1 and 62.4 mV dec−1 for the p+-Si/NiOx (5000 s) and n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) anodes, respectively (Fig. 2c), which again confirms that a considerable photovoltage was provided to effectively reduce the anodic overpotential by the n-Si/NiOx Schottky junction for water oxidation. The PEC stability of the electrochemically activated n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanode was tested by cycled CV measurements. As seen in Fig. 2d, after the activation process, the photocurrent density was well maintained and only very slight decay was observed with the 33rd CV scan relative to the 1st scan, during measurement for more than 1 hour. The reason will be discussed in the following section. Furthermore, the long-term stability of the n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanode was assessed via chronoamperometry at 2 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M NaOH (aq) under simulated solar illumination (Fig. S3, ESI†). Over 6 h of continuous operation, a constant photocurrent of ∼26 mA cm−2 was maintained, which suggested that the n-Si substrate was well protected by the NiOx film under alkaline conditions. Therefore, the PLD-deposited NiOx layer could effectively stabilize n-Si in aqueous alkaline electrolytes for PEC water oxidation.

Based on the above discussion, the NiOx protective layer can efficiently stabilize the Si photoanodes in strong alkaline electrolytes. Moreover, as an OER catalyst, when NiOx is deposited on the n-Si substrate, the NiOx/electrolyte interface replaces the n-Si/electrolyte interface, leading to the improvement of the charge carrier migration kinetics owing to the eliminated FLP of the n-Si surface, and the formed n-Si/NiOx junction promotes photogenerated charge separation to generate a photovoltage for driving water oxidation. Scheme 1 illustrates the energy band diagram, charge transfer process in the formed n-Si/NiOx heterojunction and surface catalysis process at the NiOx/electrolyte interface. As a p-type semiconductor, NiOx has a large band gap of 3.7 eV.37,50–53 When n-Si came into contact with p-NiOx, due to the more negative Fermi level (Ef) of n-Si relative to p-NiOx, the electrons in the n-Si substrate would transfer to p-NiOx, creating a space charge region and thus leading to the upward band bending of n-Si, and to the interface of the n-Si/p-NiOx heterojunction, which generated a driving force for holes to transfer from the n-Si substrate to the p-NiOx layer. Upon solar light illumination, the photogenerated electrons and holes in the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of n-Si were separated by the energy barrier at the n-Si/p-NiOx heterojunction and then transferred to the back contact and the p-NiOx thin layer, respectively, to provide a considerable photovoltage for PEC water splitting. In the electrochemical activation process, the NiOx thin layer underwent a chemical conversion from NiO to the complex Ni(OH)2/NiOOH compound, during a series of charging and discharging cycles.44–50 When the ultrathin Ni(OH)2/NiOOH layer was formed, the photogenerated holes would transfer from p-NiOx to the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH layer on which the water oxidation reaction was catalysed. Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons, accumulated in the CB of the n-Si substrate, transferred to the Pt electrode through the external circuit for water reduction. As a result, the deposited NiOx thin layer significantly enhanced the PEC activity of the n-Si photoanode.

It has been generally observed that during the PEC reaction and CV measurements, O2 bubbles were generated, accumulated and covered onto the photoanode surface, which decreased the effective area, increased the interfacial electrical resistance and then hindered the interfacial PEC reaction. As shown in Fig. 3a, there were many bubbles covering the photoanode surface during CV scans, which may be a reason that the overpotential of the 33rd scan slightly increased relative to the 1st scan as shown in Fig. 2d. Thus, to determine the slight change in photocurrent originated from the oxidation of n-Si or the coverage of O2 bubbles onto the photoanode surface, different CV scans were explored with and without the bubbles. As shown in Fig. 3b, when the bubbles were removed, the onset potential of the 30th scan cathodically shifted by ∼40 mV relative to the 29th scan, which suggests that the generated O2 bubbles covering the photoanode surface increased the interfacial electrical resistance between the NiOx and the electrolyte; however, with continuous CV scans, the O2 bubbles rapidly formed and accumulated, and then again covered the photoanode surface, and as a result, the onset potential of the 33rd CV scan shifted to a higher potential relative to the 30th scan. The Tafel plots extracted from the CV scans in Fig. 3b across the water oxidation current density of 1.0–10 mA cm−2 again confirmed the effect of the O2 bubbles (Fig. 3c). When the bubbles were removed from the photoanode surface, the overpotential of the 30th scan decreased by ∼35 mV at a current density of 3.0–5.0 mA cm−2, as compared to those of the 29th and 33rd scans, which reveals again that the interfacial electrical resistance of the NiOx/electrolyte interface increased when the photoanodes were covered with bubbles, and then an extra bias potential was necessary to overcome the interfacial electrical resistance for water splitting. However, the Tafel slopes of the 29th and 33rd scans did not obviously change relative to the 30th scan, which evidences that the catalytic activity of the NiOx thin layer was not inhibited by the bubbles and the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH species atop the NiOx layer could be a stable OER catalyst. Therefore, this phenomenon demonstrates that the generated bubbles during PEC reactions should be removed as soon as possible for superior PEC performance of the photoanodes.

Conclusions
A heterojunction of n-Si/NiOx was successfully prepared by the pulsed laser deposition method. When used as a photoanode, the obtained n-Si/NiOx heterojunction assists the photo-generated charge separation to produce a considerable photovoltage for efficient solar water oxidation. The NiOx layer was evidenced to function as an effective electrocatalyst for water oxidation as well as a protective layer to prevent surface corrosion or passivation of n-Si for stable PEC water splitting. This work demonstrates that by the convenient and effective pulsed laser deposition method, multifarious catalytic and protective thin layers could be optimally deposited on different photoelectrodes to create heterojunction structures for stable and highly efficient PEC water splitting.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of the n-Si/NiOx heterojunction fabricated by PLD for PEC water splitting. (b) Ni 2p XPS spectra of the as-deposited n-Si/NiOx heterojunctions. (c, e and g) Cross-sectional view and (d, f and h) top view SEM images of the as-deposited n-Si/NiOx with different NiOx thicknesses: (c and d) n-Si/NiOx (1000 s), (e and f) n-Si/NiOx (3000 s), and (g and h) n-Si/NiOx (5000 s).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Cyclic voltammetry (CV) characteristics of Si photoelectrodes with different thicknesses of the NiOx layer (n-Si/NiOx (m), m = 1000 s, 3000 s and 5000 s). (b) CV curves of the n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanode and the p+-Si/NiOx (5000 s) electrode and (c) Tafel plots of the electrodes across the water oxidation current density of 1.0 mA cm−2. (d) Stable performance of the n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanode. All the CV measurements were scanned at 20 mV s−1 at room temperature.	 

 	Scheme 1  Schematics of the energy band diagram, charge transfer process in the formed n-Si/NiOx heterojunction and surface catalysis process at the NiOx/electrolyte interface.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Optical image of the photoanode: O2 gas evolution under illumination. (b) CV curves and (c) Tafel plots of the n-Si/NiOx (5000 s) photoanode across the water oxidation current density of 1.0–10 mA cm−2 with different scan cycles (the bubbles were cleared out in the 30th scan, while lots of bubbles covered the photoanode surface in the 29th and 33rd scans).
