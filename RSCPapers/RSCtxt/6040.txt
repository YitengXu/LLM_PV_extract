    , Accepted 3rd June 2011First published on 16th June 2011AbstractWe report a universal strategy for doping hematite photoanode materials. Si-doped hematite nanosheets with a superlattice structure were first synthesised by hydrothermal treatment of a mixture of FeCl3 agent and liquid phase laser ablation-derived-silicon colloids. The dopant site in Si-doped hematite was clarified at the atomic scale.

Water splitting on a semiconductor photocatalyst under solar irradiation is potentially a significant method of utilizing the abundant sunlight to solve the current energy problems.1 Since the pioneering work on TiO2 films by Fujishima and Honda in 1972,2 considerable efforts have been exerted to discover appropriate photoanode materials, particularly oxide semiconductors, that use less energetic, but more abundant, visible light.3Hematite (α-Fe2O3) can utilize a larger fraction of visible light (ca. 40%) due to its nearly ideal band gap of 2.1–2.2 eV.4 In addition, α-Fe2O3 possesses several advantages, such as abundance, low cost, chemical stability in aqueous solution (at pH > 3), non-toxicity and low environmental impact. However, the notoriously low electrical conductivity and short hole diffusion length are the main challenges encountered in the use of α-Fe2O3.5 To overcome these drawbacks, α-Fe2O3 is doped with higher- or lower-valent metal atoms, and its morphology is modulated to a size comparable to the hole diffusion distance to significantly increase the light-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency.

Hematite doped with tetravalent ions or divalent ions has been used to produce a mixed valence state and increase the charge carrier density.6 Several synthetic methods have also been designed to obtain the optimal morphology and particle size of α-Fe2O3.7 However, certain critical characteristics of the doped α-Fe2O3 structure are still unknown and this impedes further improvements of α-Fe2O3 for practical application as a photocatalyst. For instance, the actual locations of dopants in the structure, i.e., whether they prefer to deposit on the crystal surface, grain boundary, or inside the α-Fe2O3 lattice, has not been determined. If the answer is inside the lattice, it is similarly uncertain whether these dopants occur as a solid solution in the ordered superlattice or are disordered. Additionally, the dopants could significantly affect the growth behavior of the α-Fe2O3 nanostructure; this provides another route to control the morphology of α-Fe2O3 crystals. The development of a universal method for simultaneous efficient doping and nanostructuring of α-Fe2O3 photoanode materials is therefore desirable.
Here, we present the first report of the formation of Si-doped α-Fe2O3 ultra-thin nanosheets with a superlattice structure. The Si dopants have an ordered distribution in the α-Fe2O3 lattice and the actual dopant sites can be observed at the atomic scale using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). In contrast to the previous doping method, which employs chemical agents (such as tetraethoxysilane) as the Si precursor, we used Si colloids generated by pulse laser ablation of a Si target in deionized water. The technique of laser ablation in a liquid (LAL) is a powerful approach to obtain clean, well-dispersed, ultra-small and highly reactive colloidal solutions without introducing impurities or additional chemical agents.8 The present study demonstrated the utility of LAL-derived highly reactive colloids as reaction precursors in doping semiconductors and in preparing ordered superlattices and/or homogeneous solid solution nanostructures.
According to the synthetic procedure (Scheme 1), the Si-doped α-Fe2O3 nanostructure was easily obtained by hydrothermal treatment of a mixture of LAL-generated Si colloids and FeCl3 solution. Fig. 1a shows a typical image obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the synthesized product. The large-scale uniform and well-dispersed nanosheets are round and have a diameter of 80–90 nm. The thickness of the nanosheets is approximately <10 nm, based on the lateral view TEM image in Fig. 1b. This size is comparable to the short diffusion path of the charge carriers in α-Fe2O3, in the order of a few to tens of nanometres.4

Several typical types of superlattice structures have been widely investigated, namely, the long-range ordered stacking of alternating close-packed layers (polytypic structure),9 intrinsic defect ordering in lattices,10 and the orderly arrangement of dopant atoms in the normal solid solution lattice.11 The formation of a superlattice structure by doping of one-dimensional materials has also been reported.12 However, doped superlattice structures along three crystalline orientations in a two-dimensional sheet-like structure are rarely reported. Fig. 2a shows a typical HRTEM image observed along the c axis of a Si-doped α-Fe2O3 nanosheet, which clearly illustrates the superlattice structure. The three rectangular regions marked in the image are the frequently observed superlattice structures along the [210], [120], and [−110] zone axes. Moreover, the marked triangular region (Fig. 2b) includes all of the aforementioned superlattices along the [210] and [−110] zone axes. Due to the difference in the bonding electrons and Pauling radii of the Si and Fe atoms, the lattice distortion of Fe2O3 occurs in the sites of the dopant Si atoms. Therefore, nine (110) planes of α-Fe2O3 interposed in two adjacent superlattice planes (p1) along the [110] zone axis can be clearly distinguished in Fig. 2b. The superlattices are also apparent from the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2c), which further shows that 14 α-Fe2O3 (300) planes are interposed in two adjacent superlattice planes (p2) along the [210] zone axis. However, the interplanar distance of (300) is too small (1.45 Å) to be directly observed in the HRTEM images. The interplanar distance of the superlattice planes of p1 and p2 is 2.51 nm (d1) and 2.17 nm (d2), respectively. Fig. 2d is the corresponding structural model of the Si-doped lattice of α-Fe2O3 (projected along the c axis), which shows the dopant types in the aforementioned superlattice structures. Si atoms (green spheres) substitute the Fe atoms (white spheres) in α-Fe2O3 and form a larger lattice that is highly consistent with the SAED pattern. In addition, the geometrical relationship of d1 and d2 in the diagram corresponds well with the distance depicted in Fig. 3b. According to the symmetry of the α-Fe2O3 unit cell in the rhombohedral system, one superlattice plane and 14 (030) or (−330) planes are alternately arranged along the [210] and [−110] zone axes in the α-Fe2O3 lattice.

The corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (Fig. S1, see ESI†) of the Si-doped α-Fe2O3 nanosheets demonstrates the presence of Si without impurities and an Si:Fe atomic ratio of ca. 1:9.88. As a reference, a sample of pure α-Fe2O3 was prepared through the same hydrothermal conditions (Fig. S2, see ESI†). This sample consists of irregular polyhedra with a narrow size distribution (ca. 40 nm). Compared with the Si-doped α-Fe2O3 ultra-thin nanosheets, the dopants may have a significant impact on the morphology of the organized structures. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pure and Si-doped α-Fe2O3 (Fig. S3, see ESI†) show the absence of the Si phase peaks and a slight shift in the peak of the doped α-Fe2O3. For instance, the distortion of certain crystalline planes after doping, Δd(104) (Δd(104) = Δddoped − Δdpure) is 0.00304 Å, and Δd(110) is −0.00172 Å, according to software analyses (Philips X'Pert HighScore). To further characterize the Si-doped α-Fe2O3, micro-Raman spectra of the pure and Si-doped α-Fe2O3 were obtained (Fig. 3). The Raman vibration modes are sensitive to slight bond changes and distortions of the local lattice. The typical bands of the A1g mode (225 and 477 cm−1) and Eg mode (247, 295, 410 and 610 cm−1) are present in the spectra of the two samples. There is no evident Raman shift in these bands. The bands at 1318 cm−1 can be ascribed to magnon scattering.13 The band at 658.9 cm−1 is due to the substitution of Fe by the dopant Si.4 Notably, the band at 518.7 cm−1 can be observed in the Si-doped superlattice spectrum; this peak is close to the normally observed 520 cm−1 Raman line of Si. To the best of our knowledge, this peak has never been observed in previous studies on the Si-doped α-Fe2O3 structure. Therefore, this could be a unique Raman spectral feature of Si-doped α-Fe2O3 superlattice structures and could be correlated to the Si–O bond formed in the α-Fe2O3 lattice.14
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) optical absorption spectrum of the Si-doped α-Fe2O3 nanosheets dispersed in water (Fig. S4, see ESI†) shows an obvious red shift of the absorption band relative to that of pure α-Fe2O3. This may have been induced by the quantum size effect and formation of shallow energy levels by the dopants. The formed shallow levels not only supply major carriers, but also decrease the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. Absorption of sunlight of longer wavelengths enhances the light-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. Measurements of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of the synthesized Si-doped α-Fe2O3 superlattice structures are in progress.
In conclusion, we have synthesized Si-doped α-Fe2O3 ultra-thin nanosheets with superlattice structures using LAL-derived highly reactive Si colloids. The results give direct evidence of the dopant types of Si in α-Fe2O3, and may contribute to the development of theoretical models to elucidate the influence of dopants on the PEC of doped α-Fe2O3. We also established a novel application of LAL technology in the synthesis of doped nanostructures. Oxide semiconductors could be doped with various elements, such as Ge, Ti, Sn, and Mn, by adopting a similar approach used in doping α-Fe2O3.
