Integration of highly efficient solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) to convert CO2 and H2O to syngas – a mixture of H2 and CO at a molar ratio of 0.7, with a high-performance process for converting syngas to liquid feedstock for fuels and chemicals is described in this article. A novel configuration of SOECs provides a low-cost solution to produce high syngas production rates at low cell degradation. Integration of natural gas in the process directly to the anode further improves the economics and energy management. In the fuel synthesis reactor, CO conversion was 82% while C5+ selectivity of the combined CO conversion and oligomerization processes was 79%. Stable operation for 4000 h was demonstrated. The overall energy efficiency was 67%. The economics of the process depends mainly on the cost of energy and the size of the plant.
1. Introduction
The continuous increase in CO2 emissions,1 the main greenhouse gas (GHG), from 20.8 Gt in 1990 to 33.2 Gt in 2018 is a major factor in global warming. Coal use accounts for about 40% and 44% of the total CO2 emissions in 1990 and 2018, respectively. Interestingly, CO2 emitted in coal-fired power generation increased from 25% to 30% of the total in 1990 and 2018, in spite of a significant increase in the use of renewable energy and natural gas (NG). Over the same period, the gross world product (GWP) increased from 50 trillion USD to 120 trillion USD, indicating2 that the GWP increase outpaced significantly the reduction in CO2 emissions because of higher energy efficiency and a shift to more environmentally friendly sources. This translates into an increase, over this period, in the global atmospheric CO2 concentration from 360 ppm to 410 ppm, measured by Scripps Institution of Oceanography3 at UC San Diego. The Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal4 (LTTG) is to hold global warming to levels well below 2 °C, setting a target to limit it to 1.5 °C. Scientists have devised various scenarios4,5 for the implementation of LTTG. This includes limitations on CO2 emissions as well as so-called CO2 negative emission, possibly by carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) carbon capture and utilization (CCU) or bioenergy.
CCU is a viable option,6 implementing the so-called circular carbon cycle, to produce fuels, chemicals, materials and plastics. The paths of CCU are further divided7 into non-reductive (plastics and materials) and reductive (chemicals and fuels) that require low-cost renewable electricity. Potential advantages of the reductive paths7 are reduction of the carbon intensity of the products and stabilization of the electric grid during transitional periods. A recent publication8 has reviewed the catalytic processes and the related life cycle analysis for converting CO2 to a variety of chemicals. A critical review9 analyzed the competitiveness of processes to produce renewable fuels (hydrogen, syngas, methanol and diesel) from CO2 and H2O using renewable energy via four different pathways: thermo-conversion (concentrated solar), electro-conversion (renewable electricity), biomass conversion (natural photosynthesis) and photo-conversion (artificial photosynthesis). A detailed analysis of the status of each one of the pathways and the techno-economic outlook indicated that the most viable technology is electrolysis. The renewable fuel production costs calculated by using a techno-economic analysis based on 2015 prices yielded significantly higher values than production from fossil feedstock. For example, syngas (H2 to CO molar ratio of 2) produced by solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) of CO2 and H2O was evaluated to cost $1.3 per kg compared with $0.19 per kg by a thermal process from NG.
Co-electrolysis by using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) of H2O and CO2 operating at high temperatures10,11 emerged as a very promising technology for the production of syngas at high yield, over a wide range of H2 to CO molar ratio from 0.1 to 3 required for the production of fuels, chemicals and storage. Since the rate of reactions at the electrodes is much faster, no noble metals are needed. As the temperature increases, the difference between the Gibbs energy change and the enthalpy change increases so a larger part of the energy demand for the reaction can be supplied in the form of heat. This is a major advantage since waste heat or associated NG can be utilized. The aging rate (i.e. decrease in cell potential) under constant load operation and hydrogen as fuel typically lies below 0.3% per 1000 h.
Syngas is the feedstock for the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis12,17 (FTS). FTS was invented, developed and commercialized about a century ago. Since then, it has been widely investigated and implemented in the production of a variety of fuels and chemicals.12–17 The main catalysts for FTS are based on cobalt or iron. They include12–17 a wide range of promoters, co-catalysts and stabilizers to improve their performance defined by activity (high rates of reaction), selectivity to desired products and stability (long time-on-stream). Products of FTS are paraffins, olefins and oxygenates, depicted in reaction (1). The carbon distribution depends on chain-growth probability factor α defined by the Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) polymerization model.12–17 The higher the value of α, the heavier the product. Methanation (reaction (2)) is detrimental to the selectivity to desired products. Iron catalysts display a significant water gas shift (WGS, reaction (3)) activity, shifting some of the CO to production of H2 and CO2. Therefore, iron catalysts are normally used for reacting syngas consisting of H2 to CO molar ratio ≪2, producing mostly olefins and oxygenates in the middle-distillate range while cobalt-based catalysts produce primarily heavy paraffins.12,17 (1)where β + γ + δ = 1 CO + 3H2 ⇌ CH4 + H2O methanation(2) CO + H2O ⇌ CO2 + H2 WGS(3)
FTS can produce a range of organic products ranging from light C2–C4 olefins to heavy wax paraffins and from paraffins and olefins to oxygenates,12–17 depending on the type, formulation, structure and composition of the catalyst and its activation,15,16 the syngas composition and the operating conditions. Although FTS does not produce selectively specific products, like in the case of methanol, its products can readily be converted to liquid chemicals and fuels. SASOL12,17,20 is an excellent example of implementation of FTS in the production of a broad variety of products. While in the past, more emphasis was put on the production of fuels, major changes in the market are expected to shift the emphasis mainly to chemicals.15,16
FTS has been commercialized18–20 in South Africa (Sasol Sasolburg/Secunda), Malaysia (Shell Bintulu) and Qatar (Sasol Oryx, Shell Pearl) for production of 12000–140000 barrels per day. Although the economy of scale dictated construction of very large plants that are more cost effective, small-scale plants (500–2000 barrels per day) that are close to the local source of CO2 and potential markets are expected to ultimately be a more viable proposition. Specifically, this would be suitable for SOEC co-electrolysis possibly coupled with associated NG.
Methane is another detrimental GHG. Its global warming potential is 28–36 times stronger than CO2. One of the methane sources is NG emitted as a by-product of crude oil extraction21,22 called associated gas. Flaring this gas is a widely used practice to dispose of associated gas.21 About 140 billion cubic meters (bcm) of NG annually are estimated to be flared,21 resulting in nearly 300 million tons of CO2 to be emitted to the atmosphere. NG in general and associated gas can potentially be used directly at the anode or as heat sources in the operation of SOE co-electrolysis.
Here we report the performance of a system that converts CO2 and H2O to organic liquid stock for chemicals and blend for fuels consisting of a novel high-temperature co-electrolysis reactor to produce syngas and a novel catalytic process that converts it to organic liquids with high productivity, selectivity to olefins and oxygenates and stable operation for about 4000 h on stream. The system is designed to optimize the performance, operability and economics of both processes. This was accomplished by converting the CO2 and steam mixture to oxygen and lean-hydrogen syngas (H2/CO = 0.7) and adding the feed to a FTS reactor followed by an oligomerization reactor, both operating under optimal conditions. An organic liquid and oxygen are the only products of this system. The gaseous by-products are combusted to provide the heat for various units in process, mainly the co-electrolyzer, and CO2 and water are recycled to the co-electrolyzer.
The conversion of the lean-hydrogen syngas is based on a novel catalyst, the iron spinel catalyst. This fundamental aspects23–26 of this catalyst as well as its application in CO2 hydrogenation27–29 to organic liquids were studied extensively at the Blechner Center. Over the past two decades, CO2 hydrogenation through FTS was studied comprehensively.30 A techno-economic analysis of processes using CO2 and either water, biogas or NG, as feedstock for production of hydrogen, was conducted.26 As expected, the production of eco-friendly, renewable fuels based on CO2 is not competitive with fuels based on crude oil because of the high cost of production of hydrogen, the limited selectivity to organic liquids and the relatively high amount of water produced in the process. Therefore, a different approach was taken, feeding lean-hydrogen syngas31 to a process that consists of CO conversion to organic liquids and oligomerization of light olefins.
2. Experimental and methods
2.1 Cell fabrication
The electrolyte-supported yttria-stabilised zirconia tubes were fabricated using cold isostatic pressing. This method allows pressing of complex shapes directly from the ceramic powder.32 The preparation method was adapted from previously developed methods at CSIRO.33,34 Briefly, 8 mol% Y2O3-ZrO2 (YSZ, Tosoh Corporation, Japan) powder was placed within a polyurethane mold with a centrally located metallic mandrel. The average particle size of the powder (D50) was 0.040 μm with a surface area of 16 m2 g−1. The components were then isostatically pressed at 25000 psi for 30 s in a cold isostatic press (Avure Technologies, USA) to form a green state electrolyte tube, after which the tube was sintered at 1500 °C for 2 h in static air using a heating and cooling rate of 300 °C h−1. The average thickness of the sintered electrolyte-supported tube was about 0.5 mm. The electrode material was prepared with Ce0.9Gd0.1O2 (GDC) (Fuel Cell Materials, USA) and Ag (Alfa Aesar, Australia) powders in a ratio of 50:50 (by volume) with an ink vehicle (Fuel Cell Materials, OH, and USA) and zirconia milling media (MTI, USA). GDC had a median particle size of 0.18 μm and a surface area of 10.9 m2 g−1. Ag had a median particle size of 4–7 μm and a surface area of 0.1–0.4 m2 g−1. A planetary ball mill was used for 2 h to combine the materials into a homogeneous mixture for electrode coating. Symmetrical electrodes were coated onto the electrolyte-supported tube with a paintbrush, dried at 80 °C for 1 h and subsequently placed in an oven at 825 °C for 2 h. The electrode active area was calculated to be about 30 cm2. Silver wires (A&E Metals) of 1 mm diameter were attached to electrodes for electrical connections.
2.2 Cell materials characterization
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was performed on electrodes using a Bruker D8 Advance A25 X-ray Diffractometer. XRD spectra were measured in the 2θ range, 20–120° with a step size of 0.02° and a count time of 1.6 s per step. Bruker XRD search match program EVA™v5 was used to analyse the spectra and crystalline phases identified using the ICDD-JCPDS powder diffraction database. Images of the electrode surface were analysed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Phenom-World, Netherlands).
2.3 Cell testing
To evaluate the performance of the electrolyte-supported tubular cell, an in-house designed tubular reactor placed in a split tube furnace (ECE, Australia) was used. A schematic for the tube test setup is shown in the ESI Fig. 1.† The temperature of the tube was measured across the length with three thermocouples, and the electrochemical experiments were performed when all three thermocouples were at exactly the same temperature of 800 °C. A programmable DC power supply (Fuseco, Australia) was used to carry out the electrolysis experiments. The power supply was calibrated with test circuits (Princeton Applied Energy, USA) and an ultra-sensitive Current Source (Keithley Series 6200) before and after use. All gases used were high purity bottled gases sourced from BOC, Australia along with a certificate of analysis. The cell was first heated to the target temperature of 800 °C and left under open circuit voltage (OCV) overnight for about 14 h. The following day, the cell was loaded at 1.4 V for 6 h using a steam/CO2 mixture. The steam and CO2 mixing was achieved by using an in-house made gas mixer flow circuit consisting of flowmeters, actuators and sensors, and adjusted until the desired output ratio of H2 to CO was achieved. The exit gas composition was measured continually using a Claurus (PerkinElmer, USA) online GC with a safe glass moisture trap. The anode side (oxygen evolution electrode) was purged with house air. For methane assisted electrolysis (MAE), air on the anode side was replaced with methane gas and helium was used as a sweep gas when switching between air and methane.
2.4 CO conversion experimental units
The bench-scale experiments were performed in a rig schematically depicted in the ESI Fig. 2.† Mixtures of CO, CO2 and H2 at a flowrate controlled by using Brooks flowmeters flowed through a tubular reactor (16 mm ID, 250 mm long) packed with 6 g of catalyst in the form of 1.6 mm ID extrudates and diluted with 75–180 μm quartz particles as needed. The reactor was heated electrically. The products were cooled, and the heavy fraction was condensed and separated in a high temperature separator (140 °C). Then the gaseous mixture was further cooled to 30 °C and the C5+ fraction was condensed and separated in a low temperature separator. The gaseous stream flowed through the oligomerization reactor packed with 6 g of a commercial catalyst. The products of the oligomerization reaction were cooled down to 2 °C to condense the light organic liquid. The pressure in the rig was controlled by using a backpressure regulator.
The run performance (rate and composition of non-condensable flow, temperature profile in the reactor, draining of liquid products) was normally measured every 24 to 48 h. Gaseous products were analyzed using an online Agilent 7890A Series Gas Chromatograph equipped with 7 columns and 5 automatic valves using helium as a carrier gas. The liquid organic and aqueous products were analyzed by GC-MS (Agilent Technologies 6890N network GC system equipped with 5973 Network mass-selective detector).
Catalyst activation was done by in situ reduction in hydrogen at 30 cm3 min−1 g−1 at 450 °C and atmospheric pressure for 3 h.
The mini-pilot rig had a similar configuration to the bench scale rig. The tubular reactor (16 mm ID, 500 mm long) was packed with 20 g of extrudates. The oligomerization reactor was packed with 20 g of a commercial catalyst.
The CO conversion and the ratio of CO conversion in FTS to that in WGS are calculated as: (4) (5)where XCO is CO conversion and Fi-in and Fi-out are the molar flow rate of component i at the inlet and outlet, respectively.
The mass selectivity to production of organic compounds is calculated based on the mass of CO converted in the FTS reaction and mass of carbon in organic compounds (6)where Mi is the molecular weight of component i and Yi is the carbon mass fraction in component i.
2.5 Process modelling
The process simulation was carried out with the CHEMCAD 7.1.1 computer aided process simulation program. Paraffins and olefins in the range of C1 to C28 were chosen to represent the hydrocarbon liquid phase, while ethanol, acetone and propanol were chosen to represent the oxygenate phase according to the results obtained in the mini-pilot unit. Natural gas is represented only by methane. The PSRK equation of state is used to describe the phase behaviour in the process. The liquid product of the different separation stages was brought to atmospheric pressure in the flash drum. The gases were combusted to discharge carbon dioxide. Heat loss in the piping system was neglected. Each equipment unit induced a pressure loss of 0.2 bar. Cooling water and an air cooler are used to remove excess of heat in the process.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O

Fig. 1 shows the completed tubular cells with electrodes after coating and firing as described in the Experimental and Methods section. A simple tubular design along with simultaneous one step fabrication of anode and cathode can allow substantial cost reduction as compared to state-of-the-art solid oxide cell fabrication. Moreover, the electrolyte supported tubular cells presents several advantages over alternative designs (planar, metal supported cells) such as requirements for sealing are less stringent and the ability to cope with thermal cycling is shown to be better.35 Furthermore, tube cells can be bundled together, and reactant and product gas manifolding can be easily achieved externally outside the hot zone as opposed to planar cell stacking which requires complex internal manifolding. However, limitations of a tubular geometry include a lower volumetric current density leading to a larger footprint of the system and issues with designing and fabrication of current collectors for the tube interior.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the GDC-Ag cathode after firing at 825 °C for 2 h. The spectrum corresponds well with phases of cerium oxide and silver respectively. Other associated minor phases may exist but may not be evident using a lab scale XRD. SEM was also used to evaluate the pristine surface of the electrode prior to testing (Fig. 2b). As can be seen, the surface is littered with pores of varying size, this is due to the low sintering temperature for electrodes. A highly porous structure is essential for a good SOEC cathode to increase the active sites for reactions to take place and electronic pathways through the framework.

Fig. 3 shows the current–voltage (I–V) polarization curves of the SOEC at 800 °C. In the co-electrolysis mode, a mixture of CO2 and steam was fed to the cell with house air flowing on the anode side. The feed of steam and CO2 was adjusted to yield a H2/CO ratio of about 0.7. Other required syngas compositions can be produced by adjusting the steam to CO2 ratio under constant current and temperature settings before the I–V curve is recorded. Maximum current densities over 500 mA cm−2 were obtained. The operating voltage of 1.4 V is in the exothermic regime for SOEC operation, allowing the actual system to operate in the thermally self-sustaining mode. In the endothermic mode, where heat from the downstream process can be used, the cell can be operated at voltages between 1.1 and 1.2 V which translates to an electrical energy input between 59 and 64 W h mol−1 of syngas. From the I–V curve (Fig. 3), current densities at 1.1 V and 1.2 V are about 262 mA cm−2 and 350 mA cm−2.
 Fig. 3  Current–voltage response of the single SOEC at 800 °C in co-electrolysis mode with CO2/H2O (steam) as cathode gas feed and air on the anode side (open circles) and in methane powered electrolysis (MPE) mode with CO2/H2O (steam) as cathode gas feed and humidified methane on the anode side (open triangles). 
After recording the I–V curve, the cell was loaded at 1.4 V for 500 h for testing the performance stability. Even after about 500 h of continual SOEC operation at a current density of 500 mA cm−2, the cell voltage only increased from 1.30 to 1.32 V. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of the cell to produce syngas calculated using Faraday's law and GC data was almost >99% which is typical for SOECs with YSZ electrolyte. Based on the FE, at current densities of 500 mA cm−2, syngas production of about 22 L h−1 can be projected for a cell with an active area of 100 cm2 which equates to 64 W h mol−1 of syngas or 3.7 kW h per kg of syngas for a H2/CO ratio of 0.7.
These current densities and efficiencies are remarkable considering the relatively larger area cell used with a thick electrolyte which provides mechanical robustness. Further, such tubular design allows the control of the cell process (applied voltage and feed gas) for individual cells which is not possible using typical planar cell design. So, at a stack level, where several cells are bundled together, the parameters such as the CO/H2 ratio and cell operating mode (endothermic or exothermic) can be controlled flexibly. It is also worth noting that the non-nickel-based cathode used in this work does not need a recirculation of product feed gas to keep nickel in the reduced state which is typically required with state of the art SOECs.
The single SOEC was further tested in the methane (natural gas) powered electrolysis (MPE) mode. In this mode, a mixture of CO2 and steam was fed to the cathode as in the case of co-electrolysis and on the anode side humidified methane was supplied in lieu of air. Fig. 3 shows an I–V curve for MPE mode in comparison with co-electrolysis mode.
The overall reaction for MPE can be written as follows: CH4 + CO2 ⇌ 2H2 + 2CO MPE(7)
As expected, the current densities were significantly higher at all voltages as compared to co-electrolysis (Fig. 4a). A current density of almost 300 mA cm−2 was obtained at 0.2 V (10.7 W h mol−1) with a CO2/steam conversion of 91%. After 50 h of continuous operation at a current density of 500 mA cm−2, at 0.5 V the degradation was below 0.1% after initial cell conditioning. These results are comparable to those reported elsewhere with smaller area cells or electrode (cathode) supported tubular cells which will involve more complex cell fabrication and challenges with redox stability and carbon deposition due to usage of Ni in the cathode.36,37 In general, electrode supported cells are expensive to manufacture, and are susceptible to degradation during thermal cycling or cathode gas switching. Although the short-term performance of the tubular cells is impressive, a long-term evaluation for several thousand hours will be required, in particular, for MPE mode to confirm the suitability of the materials. Further, the scale of the SOEC technology needs to be increased substantially to match with scales of the downstream fuel synthesis process. While progression in scale of SOECs is limited by market drivers and materials challenges, significant R&D is being carried out for the past few years for scaling up the technology. One of the unique advantages of proposed tubular cells is simpler manifolding and scalability as compared to planar cells. The length of the electrolyte tubes and electrode areas can be increased significantly only with minor modification to fabrication processes used in the current work. Several such tubes can be bundled into the stacks and modules of several stacks can be used together without a significant loss in capital or efficiency.

Integration of natural gas (NG) in the process is beneficial not only for significant improvement in current densities but also provides a reliable approach to smoothen the cell response to the fluctuations in renewable energy.38,39 Further, based on the energy content of fuel gases in reaction (7), the MPE results show over a 25% increase in the energy content of the product gas (syngas) for stoichiometric reactions. Fig. 4b shows a cell response when the anode gas composition was switched alternatively between methane and air. The cell was operated alternatively in co-electrolysis mode and MPE mode. The cell response is rather remarkable for such cell operation with a fast ramp up to operating voltage within the time of gas switch (about 15 min) between air and methane at the anode. There have been several reports on methane powered electrolysis in SOE, however, this is the first time the cell response with cyclic switching of anode gas is recorded.
The mechanism of oxidation of methane in SOECs has been debated for some time. It is not yet clear whether it is a complete oxidation of methane to water and CO2 (reaction (8)) or partial oxidation to CO and H2 (reaction (9)) or a mixed reaction mechanism.36 The fact that no methane cracking catalyst was used in this work and the SOEC area was relatively large with a tubular geometry, suggests that either a partial oxidation of methane or a mixed mechanism with reaction ((8) or (9)) is operating in tandem. More studies with continuous exit gas analysis will be required to elucidate the fundamental reaction mechanism. CH4 + 2O2 ⇌ 2H2O + CO2, ΔH = −800 kJ mol−1(8) CH4 + 1/2O2 ⇌ 2H2 + CO, ΔH = −35.6 kJ mol−1(9)
3.2 Lean-hydrogen syngas conversion to organic liquids
The performance of the reactors for lean-hydrogen syngas conversion and oligomerization to organic liquids was measured in bench-scale and mini-pilot units. A novel iron-based, spinel catalyst was prepared in the form of powder and extrudates and characterized extensively.23–25 A potassium promoter determines the balance between FTS and WGS with a dominant effect on performance.25 Its effect depends on the operating conditions, mainly the syngas composition. The optimum K content for lean-hydrogen syngas (0.6 < H2/CO < 0.9), measured in the bench-scale reactor, was determined to be 5.5 wt%. Increasing the K content to 8 wt% or decreasing it to 4 wt%, decreased or increased significantly the WGS activity, respectively. A catalyst containing 8 wt% K with a low WGS activity produced relatively little hydrogen thus decreasing the H2/CO in the reactor, which yielded a very heavy organic product and caused rapid deactivation. In contrast, a catalyst containing 4 wt% K decreased selectivity, converting CO to produce more hydrogen and light hydrocarbons rather than organic liquids.
The syngas composition had a major effect on the performance of CO conversion. Data measured at 250 h on-stream in the bench-scale reactor and listed in Table 1 indicate that the optimal feed H2/CO (FHCR) is 0.7. Increased FHCR from 0.6 to 1.5, increased the H2/CO at the reactor outlet from 0.8 to >3 at about 74–85% CO conversion. The ratio of CO conversion in FTS to that in WGS also increased from 1 to 1.6. As expected, the amount of water produced in the process increased significantly, reflected in the ratio between the mass of water to the mass of organic liquids. The selectivity to organic liquids decreased considerably with increasing FHCR.

Oligomerization of the gaseous fraction (44.8 mol% CO2, 23.8 mol% CO, 22.5 mol% H2, 0.7 mol% C2H4, 1.3 mol% C3H6, 1.3 mol% C4H8, 0.2 mol% C5H10, 1.1 mol% C2H6, 0.4 mol% C3H8, 0.2 mol% C4H10, 0.2 mol% C5H12 and 3.5 mol% methane) from the CO conversion reactor was carried out on a commercial catalyst40 at 40 bar, WHSV = 0.8 h−1 and a range of temperatures (225–260 °C). As the temperature increased, the olefin conversion increased from 53% to 97% and the selectivity to organic liquids decreased from 92% to 45%. At the optimal temperature of 245 °C, the conversion was 70% and the selectivity 80%.
Catalyst life is a key factor in the commercial implementation of a process. Most catalytic processes display a relatively rapid decline in performance over initial tens to hundreds of hours on stream. The stability of our selected catalyst (5.5 wt% K) was determined in the bench-scale reactor at 275 °C, WHSVCO = 0.9 gCO h−1 gcat−1 and feed H2/CO of 0.7. Over the initial 1000 h on stream at 30 bar, CO conversion decreased from 92% to 80% and C5+ selectivity decreased from 72% to 67%, as displayed in Fig. 5. Then, the pressure was increased to 40 bar and oligomerization of the gas was also conducted for almost 3000 h. The CO conversion increased to 82% while the C5+ selectivity of the combined CO conversion and oligomerization processes increased to 79%. The rate of deactivation was very mild, CO conversion and C5+ selectivity decreasing to 76% and 74%, respectively, for about 4000 h on stream.
 Fig. 5  Catalysts display very good stability in the bench-scale reactors. 
The stability of the catalyst was also tested in the mini-pilot for 2000 h on stream at 275 °C, 50 bar, WHSVCO = 1.1 gCO h−1 gcat−1 and feed H2/CO of 0.7. The results indicate that both catalysts are very stable (CO conversion decreased from 83% to 78% and C5+ selectivity decreased from 82% to 76%) as shown in the ESI Fig. 3.† The olefin conversion and selectivity to organic liquids in the oligomerization reactor at WHSV = 0.9 h−1 and 250 °C were 78% and 88%, respectively. Little change in the composition of the produced organic liquid was observed throughout the run. The distribution of hydrocarbon products is generally broad, following ASF distribution with an α value of 0.80 and liquid density of 750 kg m−3. The composition of the organic liquid is shown in Table 2. The distillation curve and carbon number distribution of the organic fraction are listed in Fig. 4 and 5 in the ESI.† The product is a versatile feedstock for production of chemicals and fuel blends. The high content of olefins, particularly α olefins, in the product renders it suitable for production of chemicals. Distillation of the product in two fractions, at 170 °C cut-off (about 50% each fraction as depicted ESI Fig. 5†) yields gasoline (<170 °C) and diesel (>170 °C) blending stocks. Those blending stocks can be used with no further treatment.

3.3 Techno-economic analysis

3.3.1 Process modeling. 
A 500 barrels per day (BPD) plant based on the integration of the SOEC and lean-hydrogen syngas conversion was simulated with CHEMCAD 7.1.1 to estimate material balances, energy and utility requirements as the inputs for the techno-economic analysis. Fig. 6 and 7 show the simplified plant layouts, while Table 3 shows the summary of the mass balance for the two modes of operation (one using renewable electricity (RE) and the other one combined with natural gas (NG)). Detailed mass flow rates and flow sheets, including a heat exchanger network, are given in the ESI Tables 2–4 and Fig. 6–7.†

 Fig. 7  A simplified schematic diagram of the integrated process powered by NG. 
The performance of the SOEC unit and lean hydrogen conversion process was calculated based on the results listed in the ESI Table 1.† The syngas mixture (H2/CO molar ratio of 0.7) produced in the SOEC flows to the CO hydrogenation reactor (R-01), conducted at 270–280 °C and 60 bar in a multi-tubular fixed bed reactor. Organic and aqueous liquids are separated (S-02 & 03) by cooling the effluent to 200 °C then to 55 °C. The gaseous stream flows to the oligomerization reactor (R-02) to convert the light olefins to a liquid organic product. The light organic fraction is cooled by expansion (E-01) to 5 °C and separated (S-05). The relatively high CO2 permeability and good selectivity over light hydrocarbons were the determining factors for choosing the low-cost polymeric type membrane (M-01) for the separation of CO2 from the oligomerization gas effluent stream. Its performance was estimated based on results reported in the literature.41–43 The permeate stream is recycled back to the SOEC unit (ER-01), while the retentate is partially recycled back to the CO conversion reactor to increase the productivity and thermal efficiency of the process. The recycle ratio (recycle stream to a tail gas stream) is limited to 1.5, keeping the CO2 concentration below 15% mol in the CO hydrogenation inlet stream. The tail gas stream is combusted (FH-01) with pure oxygen from the SOEC to generate CO2 and water. A vent stream from the liquid product flash drum is discharged through combustion. Oxygenates in the aqueous solution are separated by distillation to reach a concentrated oxygenate mixture product (96% wt). The low H2/CO molar ratio in the CO hydrogenation reactor eliminates the need for extensive water removal and recycling from the product stream. NG reduces power requirements in the high temperature electrolysis during the periods renewable electricity is not available. Both partial and complete oxidation products can be recycled back from the anode outlet stream to the cathode side to further reduce electricity demand. Given the fact that oxygen is consumed in the anode side, an external oxygen stream is supplied for the combustion of the tail gas. Most of the produced CO2 (∼95%) is recycled back to the SOEC unit to reduce costs related to CO2 capture and separation from flue gas.


3.3.2 Energy efficiency analysis. 

Table 4 depicts the energy consumption and efficiency of the overall process. The exothermic reaction (110 kJ mol−1) in the CO hydrogenation reactor produces high-pressure steam (28 ton per h) at 50 bar in the shell-side of the reactor, which is heated further (330 °C) and used to provide heat for the SOEC unit and power to the two-stage compressor driven by a single stage backpressure steam turbine. The exhaust steam stream (21 ton per h at 6 bara and 159 °C) is reheated by the combustion product stream. The tail gas stream, containing light hydrocarbons (20% mol) and unreacted syngas (48% mol), has high heat content (4.4 kW h Nm−3), which can be combusted with the available oxygen, and provides sufficient heat to maintain the high operating temperature (800 °C) of the electrochemical reactor and partly cover internal power demand for compressors and the SOEC unit. The plant is fully integrated by efficient heat exchanger design to utilize excess heat from tail gas combustion and the exothermic reaction, as shown in Fig. 8 in the ESI.†

Overall energy efficiency of 67% was calculated for the integrated process powered by RE and NG. The energy flow diagrams are depicted in ESI Fig. 9–10.†


3.3.3 Capital cost. 
Investment data for the main equipment components are summarized in Tables 5 and 6 in the ESI,† where the actual equipment size is extracted from the process simulation via CHEMCAD. The cost of a few of the main equipment units was obtained from commercial manufacturers. The six-tenths factor rule47 was applied to estimate variations in the equipment size. In order to account for inflation and temporal cost variations of equipment, the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI) is used to update old data with respect to the chosen reference year (2019). Based on the purchase cost of the main equipment components, the total capital investment (TCI) can be estimated using ratio factors for direct and indirect capital investment,47–49 as presented in eqn (11). (11)where PCE is the purchase cost of main equipment units, fdi is the ratio factor for direct and fidi is the indirect factor for the capital investment.
Since the plant has to be located in close proximity to a carbon source, the indirect costs were estimated for the case of the extension of an existing plant. Table 5 shows the assumed ratio factors and breakdown of the total capital investment. Fig. 8 shows the share of main items in the total fixed capital cost. The total investment cost for the process was estimated to be 60.3$M, which translates to 115000$/bpd. The coupling of MPE into the process requires some modifications to enable flexible and efficient operation. The additional equipment units which accounted for the modification of the system increase the total capital investment from 60.3$M to 67.3$M. It should be noted that this costing methodology results in an estimated accuracy of ±30%.

3.3.4 Operational expenditures. 
The operational expenses (Opex) comprise variable costs (materials and utilities), fixed costs (maintenance, labour costs and rates), indirect costs (sales expense, overheads and contingency) and energy cost (power requirement for SOEC), which is the dominant factor in the PTL processes. For the base case study, it was assumed that the SOEC is powered only by electricity, which is supplied continuously (multiple renewable technologies) at a constant price of 0.05$ per kW h.52Fig. 9 shows the breakdown of the annual Opex, estimated as 30.4$M per year. Further data regarding the economic assumptions and cost of utilities and materials for both modes of operation can be found in Tables 7 and 8 in the ESI.†
 Fig. 9  Operational cost breakdown for the integrated process powered by RE. 


3.3.5 Economic evaluation of the integrated process powered by RE. 
The economic analysis in this paper focuses on estimating the costs of renewable fuels or chemicals from the perspective of private investors and excludes taxes on profits and the impact of government incentives or subsidies. The levelized cost of product (LCOP) results from comparison of all costs throughout the lifetime of the plant for the construction and operating of the plant with the sum of the generated amount of liquid product throughout the life cycle. The assumptions used for this economic study are given in the ESI Table 9.† The levelized cost of product (LCOP) is expressed as: (12)where CIt is the capital investment, Ft and Vt are the fixed and variable annual expenses in the year t, Et is the energy expenditures in the year t, Lt is the organic liquid product generation in the year t, r is the discount rate and n is the economic life of the plant.
The levelized cost of liquid product (1.29$ per liter or 0.15$ per kW h) breakdown is presented in Fig. 10 for the base case (RE is available continuously). The highest contribution (50%) to LCOP is electricity since CO2 and water splitting is a highly energy-intensive process. The second highest cost share of the levelized cost is the fixed expenses (25%), which are derived from the small scale of the plant, followed by capital investment (18%) and variable and indirect costs (7%).
 Fig. 10  Levelized cost breakdown of the integrated process powered by RE. 


3.3.6 Sensitivity analysis. 
In this section, a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify which parameters have the highest impact on the levelized costs of liquid products. For this purpose, several economic parameters were varied over their plausible range. The results indicate (Fig. 11) that electricity price has the highest impact on the levelized cost depending on location and its source. The levelized cost is also very sensitive to the initial capital investment because of the relatively small output of the plant, although errors of ±30% for capital investment estimated are typical. The price of oxygen and CO2 can vary LCOP by only 5%. LCOP is also slightly sensitive to possible improvement in SOEC power requirements, being reduced to 1.24$ per liter for power consumption of 59 W h mol−1 syngas. Despite the uncertainty associated with the economic parameters (plant life, discount rate and operation time) in the model, the LCOP is less sensitive to their variation, changing only by ±5%.
 Fig. 11  Sensitivity of levelized production costs to variations of selected technical and economic parameters. 


3.3.7 Effect of the CO2 recycle ratio. 
The integrated process consists of several recycle streams, optimized to adjust the FHCR and to limit the accumulation of CO2 and light hydrocarbons in the process streams. The first one contains mainly CO2 and 20% unreacted syngas at 9 bar and recycled back to the SOEC unit to reduce demand for electricity and costs related to CO2 capture and compression. The second recycle stream, contains about 50% unreacted syngas, CO2 and light hydrocarbons at 20 bar. It is recycled back to the CO hydrogenation reactor to increase the plant output and efficiency. In addition, the tail gas is combusted to recycle pure CO2 into the SOEC. Overall, 95% of the available carbon is recycled in the process. Table 6 presents a comparison of three different carbon recycle (Rc) ratios (0, 0.5, and 0.95) to investigate the influences of different recycle ratios on the performance for a given size of SOEC unit (49.3 MW h). Further data regarding the Opex and utilities required of all cases can be found in Tables 10 and 11 in the ESI.† The LCOP is increased dramatically with decreasing the carbon recycle ratio, mainly because the unreacted syngas is combusted and not recycled together with CO2; thus, the production rate is reduced significantly. The energy demand is higher for the case of Rc = 0.95, due to the lower electricity rate produced by combustion of tail gas and higher power requirements for compression of unreacted syngas and light hydrocarbons. However, the costs related to CO2 capture and compression are much lower (four and two times lower than in the case of carbon recycle ratios of 0 and 0.5, respectively). The capital investment is only slightly lower for the cases of Rc = 0 and Rc = 0.5 since a larger compressor is needed for compressing the higher flow rate of fresh CO2. Furthermore, the higher carbon recycle ratio emits lower tail gas output; thus, a smaller combustion gas turbine for extracting energy and converting it into electricity is required. The more efficient utilization of tail gas to produce organic liquids instead of producing electricity increases the energy efficiency from 60% to 67%.

3.3.8 Impact of plant scale. 
The plant capacity has vital effects on the plant economy, which is known as the ‘scale benefit’. Four plants are evaluated, ranging from 200bpd (20 MW) to 5000bpd (0.5 GW), corresponding to a small-scale gas-to-liquid plant (Sasol, South Africa).53 A scaling exponent of 0.6 has been applied for down or upscaling. Fig. 12 shows the effect of scale on the LCOP and its components. Further data regarding the Capex and Opex of all cases can be found in Table 12 in the ESI.† The high LCOP variation to plant scale re-emphasises the importance of the economy of scale, which greatly benefits commercial plants. The significant reduction in LCOP derived mainly from the lower fixed expenses (maintenance and labour) and capital investments per production unit, while electricity expenses contribute about 0.65$ per liter of organic liquids to the LCOP in all cases. The levelized cost for 1500bpd and 5000bpd plants drops to 1.06$ per liter and 0.91$ per liter, respectively, provided utilization of low-cost renewable electricity is available at a large scale. Implementing sufficient large-scale energy storage technologies is critically important to achieve a rapid increase in renewable electricity generation.54 A more economic and practical option to assure energy availability might be combining multiple energy sources with relatively low carbon footprints at high efficiency towards decarbonized energy economy.
 Fig. 12  Effect of plant scale on LCOP. 


3.3.9 Economic evaluation of the hybrid process. 
RE is intermittent, with periods of excess generation followed by periods of little or no generation. Storing electric energy in batteries is one of the most efficient options, but their high cost (Tables 13 and 14 in the ESI†) increases LCOP by about two-fold (2.8$ per liter for 500bpd plant). This means that any plan to make the plant economically competitive must involve minimizing energy storage costs without affecting the scale of the plant. Therefore, a hybrid process combining NG with available renewable electricity may optimize operation and increase plant output, improving the techno-economic performance. Furthermore, utilization of associated gas reduces emission of a very detrimental GHG while improving the viability of the process. An economic evaluation was performed for systems operating on locally available renewable power in surplus time, provided it meets the electric power demand (>48MWel). Otherwise (<48MWel), it is operated on NG. It is assumed that a small battery storage unit accumulates a part of the excess of surplus energy and provides the minimum load requirement (2.2MWel) when RE is not available throughout the day. The results are presented as a function of the availability factor (AF). An AF of 1 means only RE is used. (13)

Fig. 13 shows the LCOP analysis for various electricity prices, as well as the CO2 consumption as a function of the AF. As expected, using NG benefits considerably when the electricity prices are high. The LCOP drops by 26% for an electricity price of 0.06$ per kW h and by 17% for an electricity price of 0.045$ per kW h as AF decreases towards 0.12. If the electricity price is 0.03$ per kW h, LCOP is only slightly affected since the electricity price is competitive to the NG price (3.9$/MMBTU) and larger battery capacity is needed. If AF is <0.12, CO2 is produced in the process, eliminating the environmental benefits of the hybrid process.

4. Conclusions
The integration of highly efficient co-electrolysis, using SOECs to convert CO2 and H2O to syngas, with a high-performance catalytic syngas conversion process has been demonstrated for the production of fuels and chemicals. The optimal H2/CO molar ratio of 0.7 yielded high conversion, selectivity and stable operation at a minimum cost. A novel configuration of SOECs provides high syngas production rates at very low degradation of the cell and at low cost. Integration of NG in the process improves syngas production significantly and provides a reliable method to smoothen the cell response to the fluctuations in RE. Furthermore, it reduces the cost of the product and energy storage, thus improving the process economic viability considerably. The fuel synthesis reactor demonstrated 4000 h of stable operation with a CO conversion of 82% and C5+ selectivity of the combined CO conversion and oligomerization processes of 79%.
The overall energy efficiency, defined as the ratio of the product energy content to the energy consumed by the process was 67%, independent of the energy source (RE or NG). The economics of the process depends mainly on the cost of RE and the size of the plant. Since RE is intermittent, storing electric energy in batteries is an efficient option, but their high cost and low energy storage capacity do not justify the economics. A hybrid process combining NG with RE may optimize operation and increase plant output, improving the techno-economic performance.
