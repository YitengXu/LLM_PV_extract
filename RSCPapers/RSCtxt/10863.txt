    , Accepted 5th September 2018First published on 5th September 2018AbstractThe ternary blending strategy has been a widely used method to achieve high performance in organic photovoltaics. However, the impact of the third component on the donor–acceptor interface geometries is still unclear, especially with regard to the microscopic structures in the mixed regions. In this study, we have investigated the donor–acceptor molecular packing structures in the mixed region as well as the exciton dissociation and charge recombination properties in all-small-molecule ternary solar cells based on the new DR3TBDTT:DR3TBDTT-E:PC71BM system by means of molecular dynamics simulations combined with electronic-structure calculations. The simulated results reveal that the incorporation of 10% DR3TBDTT-E in the ternary blend can lead to a decrease in the probability of finding PC71BM close to the central electron-donating benzodithiophene moiety, and thus this can reduce the binding energy of the lowest charge-transfer state and the electronic coupling of charge recombination. However, with a further increase of the doping ratio, PC71BM aggregation becomes weak, which is harmful to electron transport. Therefore, superior performance can be only obtained with a proper amount of the third component for ternary blend solar cells.
1. Introduction
Compared with tandem and binary organic solar cells (OSCs), ternary blend OSCs have some advantages of complementary light absorption,1–4 enhanced efficient charge and energy transfer,5–7 better morphology,8–11 tunable open-circuit voltage (VOC),12–14 and easy fabrication associated with their simple structures.15 Due to the great efforts of researchers, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 14% have been achieved for polymer:fullerene:nonfullerene ternary OSCs,16,17 demonstrating great potential for ternary OSCs.
Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the phenomena in ternary systems, such as the cascade charge transfer mechanism or energy transfer mechanism in combination with parallel-like or alloy morphology.18–22 In previous studies, researchers have focused on the modulation of mesoscopic phase structures between two donors (D) or two acceptors (A). However, the impact of the third component on the D–A interface is still unclear, especially with regard to the microscopic intermolecular structures in the mixed regions. Thus, it is highly desirable to investigate the role of the third component in tuning the molecular packing in the mixed regions and in turn to investigate how the interface structures impact the electronic properties such as the exciton dissociation (ED), charge separation, and charge recombination (CR) processes.
At present, it is a formidable task to experimentally access the molecular packing details in the mixed regions. On the theoretical side, most studies have focused on the interfacial structures and molecular aggregation of the binary systems whereas the ternary systems have remained almost unexplored.23–26 For instance, by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, Long et al. investigated the micromorphology of the intermixed regions of two different small molecular donors with the 6,6-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) acceptor and the results show that PC71BM may aggregate differently in different binary systems.27 Meanwhile, Wang et al. investigated the impact of the nature and location of the polymer side-chains on the polymer–fullerene packing in mixed regions and the electronic couplings relevant for ED and CR processes.26 Recently, we studied the importance of side-chain anchoring atoms on tuning the donor–fullerene interface geometries, and we proved that the effective suppression of charge recombination can be achieved by choosing a proper anchoring atom to provide big steric hindrance.28
Very recently, we reported all-small-molecule ternary solar cells using PC71BM as the acceptor and a new donor, DR3TBDTT-E (M2), as the third component that is compatible with the main absorber, DR3TBDTT (M1) (see the chemical structures in Fig. 1).29 The performance of the M2:PC71BM binary system (6.99%) is lower than that of the M1:PC71BM binary system (8.90%); interestingly, when doping 10% M2 into the M1:PC71BM system, the PCE increased from 8.90% to 10.26%. The enhanced performance was ascribed to the morphology transforming from alloy-like to a cascade morphology, which would facilitate charge transfer. Nonetheless, it is very useful to figure out how the third component impacts the intermolecular positions and the ED and CR processes at the D–A interface. Here, we reveal the D–A molecular packing structures in the mixed regions by means of atomistic MD simulations. Moreover, to uncover the influence of interface geometries on charge generation, we further calculated the binding energy (Eb) for the lowest charge transfer (CT) state as well as the electronic couplings for exciton dissociation (VED) and charge recombination (VCR). In addition, the effect of different doping ratios of M2 was also investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical work to study the interfacial structures and electronic processes in ternary organic solar cells.

2. Theoretical methodology
2.1 MD simulations
All atomistic MD simulations were carried out using the Gromacs-4.6.7 package.30 The modified general AMBER force field28,31 was used to generate the atom types and intra- and inter-molecular interaction parameters for three small molecules of M1, M2 and PC71BM as well as the solvent molecule of chloroform. The atomic types of M1 and M2 can be found in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Partial charges for these four molecules were obtained by the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting method.32,33 The MD simulations were performed under three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and the NPT ensemble using a leap-frog integrator with a time step of 1 fs. Temperature and pressure were controlled by using a velocity rescaling thermostat and a Berendsen barostat, respectively, with a relaxation time of 1 ps. A spherical cut-off of 1.2 nm for the summation of van der Waals interactions and short-range Coulomb interactions and the particle-mesh Ewald for long-range Coulomb interactions were used throughout.
In the four blending systems with M1:M2 weight ratios of 1:0, 0.9:0.1, 0.6:0.4 and 0:1, the numbers of M1:M2 molecules are 138:0, 124:13, 83:55, and 0:132, respectively. To keep the total D:A weight ratio at 1:0.8, 200 PC71BM molecules were used for each blend. To elucidate the influence of solvents on the local interface morphology, we simulated the solution processing of the blend films via non-equilibrium MD simulations, as we did previously.34,35 After building the boxes containing donor molecules and acceptor molecules, 50000 chloroform molecules were added into these four boxes (with a box size of 20.75 nm in three dimensions) using the genbox utility of the Gromacs package, respectively. Then, the MD simulations were carried out in the following steps. Firstly, energy minimization and a 10 ns NPT equilibration were conducted to lower the system energies at 298 K and 1 bar and bring molecules close together. Secondly, a quasi-equilibrium method was employed by randomly removing 100 chloroform molecules from boxes at every 100 ps. The solvent-extracting processes are illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†). To remove 50000 solvent molecules, a total of 50 ns of simulation was undertaken for each system at 298 K and 1 bar. Lastly, the solution-processed samples were further equilibrated for 35 ns and then 5 ns for data collection at 298 K and 1 bar. The original size of the four boxes was 20.75 nm in three dimensions, and over 300 thousand atoms were involved for each box. After solvent extraction and equilibration, the box size becomes 8.51, 8.48, 8.53, and 8.47 nm for the systems of M1:M2:PC71BM = 1:0:0.8, 0.9:0.1:0.8, 0.6:0.4:0.8, and 0:1:0.8, respectively. To extract the D–A complex for the electronic-structure calculations, the last 500 ps of equilibration was sampled every 5 ps to produce 100 snapshots for consideration of the thermal fluctuation effect.
2.2 Electronic-structure calculations
To gain insight into the ED and CR processes in the D–A complexes, the electronic coupling (Vab) between the local excited state and CT states was computed by a diabatic-state approach developed by Yi et al.,36 (1)where ΨLEa denotes the wave function of the ground or local excited state, and ΨCTb represents the wave function of the CT state. They are constructed as spin-adapted antisymmetrized products of the isolated D and A wave functions (2) (3)where S and M are the total spin and spin projection of the diabatic states for the D/A complex, ΨD/Ai denotes the ith excited state of the isolated neutral D or A with spin Si, and spin projection Mi and  represents the positively-charged state of D or negatively-charged state of A. The Clebsch–Gordan coefficient (C) ensures that the linear combination of the products of the isolated wave functions is an eigenfunction of the total spin. The isolated excited and charged states for D and A were obtained using the intermediate neglect of differential overlap (INDO) Hamiltonian37 coupled to a multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) scheme. All the π-type molecular orbitals were considered to build the CI active space. The coulomb repulsion term was described by the Mataga–Nishimoto potential.38,39 This approach has been proved to be efficient and accurate to deal with calculations on a large number of molecular pairs.40 The binding energy of the lowest CT state was estimated as the Columbic interaction between the donor cation and the acceptor anion with the dielectric constant set to 4.0 and the atomic partial charges obtained via an INDO Mulliken population analysis.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Molecular packing of electron donors
As underlined in the Introduction, understanding the molecular packing at the donor–acceptor interfaces and among the donors and acceptors is essential for evaluating the charge generation and transport processes of the investigated system. Here, two binary blending systems and two typical ternary blending systems including the optimal ternary blend (M1:M2:PC71BM = 0.9:0.1:0.8) and another blend (M1:M2:PC71BM = 0.6:0.4:0.8) were chosen for simulations. The representative snapshots of molecular packing morphologies for these four systems are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The molecular packing between the donor molecules was first analyzed and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a illustrates the center-of-mass (COM) distance of BDT–BDT (BDT = benzodithiophene) and Fig. 2c displays the COM radial distribution functions (RDFs) of BDT–BDT for the four investigated systems. We recall that in a system of particles, the RDF describes how the particle density varies as a function of distance from a reference particle. The first-neighbour peaks indicate the most-likely nearest COM distance of BDT–BDT (r). For these four systems, the distances are 3.9, 5.3, 4.2, and 4.4 Å, respectively. This means that the donor molecules pack with a preferred small r in the M1:PC71BM mixed region, while r is larger in the M2:PC71BM mixed region owing to the ester-anchored side chains with a bigger steric effect. The shortest r in the ternary blend (M1:M2:PC71BM = 0.6:0.4:0.8) is somehow the average value of that in the two binary blends. However, the optimal ternary blend exhibits the biggest r. We believe that in the ternary blend (M1:M2:PC71BM = 0.6:0.4:0.8), M1 and M2 can aggregate separately because of the compatible molecular number. In the optimal ternary blend mixed region, the existence of a minor number of M2 impacts the aggregation of M1, leading to a large M1–M1 packing distance. This is consistent with what we can see in the equilibrated snapshots displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†).
 Fig. 2  (a) Illustration of the center-of-mass (COM) distance (r) of BDT–BDT, (b) illustration of the torsion angle ψ between the thienyl groups and the BDT unit, (c) COM radial distribution functions of BDT–BDT and (d) distribution of ψ for the four blending systems with the ratios of M1:M2:PC71BM = 1:0:0.8, 0.9:0.1:0.8, 0.6:0.4:0.8, and 0:1:0.8, respectively. 
The distribution of the torsion angle ψ between the thienyl side groups and the central BDT unit was counted over 500 equilibrated snapshots for each sample (see Fig. 2b and d). For all four kinds of mixed regions, the distribution of ψ seems to be similar and is mainly concentrated in the range of 40°–60°, which means the torsion angle ψ is not affected by the different substituted chains (R) on the thienyl groups. Thus, the difference in molecular packing of the donors mainly comes from the different steric hindrance effects and interactions of the side chains.
3.2 Aggregation of PC71BM
According to the experimental results, the performance of M2:PC71BM binary solar cells (6.99%) is poorer than that of the M1:PC71BM binary ones (8.99%).29 To figure out the reasons for this, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) data were analyzed to probe the PC71BM molecular stacking in the active layers (see the experimental details in the ESI†). As can be seen from the in-plane 1D cuts of the scattering data (Fig. 3a), all the four systems show distinguished PC71BM aggregation peaks, indicating proper phase separation between the donors and PC71BM in the blending films. The M1:PC71BM binary system exhibits the strongest packing peak and the optimal ternary system with the ratio of M1:M2:PC71BM = 0.9:0.1:0.8 shows a slightly lower packing peak, which is appreciably higher than the M2:PC71BM binary system and the other ternary system with the ratio of M1:M2:PC71BM = 0.6:0.4:0.8.
 Fig. 3  (a) One-dimensional profiles along the in-plane direction of GIWAXS data. (b) COM radial distribution functions of PC71BM–PC71BM in the simulated mixed regions. 
The packing modes for PC71BM in the simulated blends are also depicted by the COM RDFs, as shown in Fig. 3b. The evolution trends of the nearest neighbour RDF peaks of PC71BM–PC71BM are very consistent with the experimental measurements. Both GIWAXS data and MD simulation results highlight that the M1:PC71BM binary blend has the strongest PC71BM aggregation. In contrast, the aggregation is relatively weak in the M2:PC71BM blend. The existence of M2 in the ternary systems would impact PC71BM packing and in the case of M1:M2:PC71BM = 0.6:0.4:0.8, the molecular packing is even worse than the M2:PC71BM blend. The poor PC71BM aggregation will result in low electron mobility. Therefore, even though M2 may exhibit a function of tuning the D–A interfacial arrangements in the ternary blend, a proper amount and a subtle balance are required.
3.3 Donor–acceptor interfacial arrangements
Now, we turn to discussing the interface geometries between the donor and acceptor molecules. To characterize the packing details, the donor molecule is divided into nine main fragments, i.e., one electron-donating central unit of BDT, six π-bridge units of T1, T2, and T3, and two electron-withdrawing end groups of rhodanine (RHD), as shown in Fig. 1. The molecular complexes are divided into face-on orientations (the PC71BM molecules locate on the top of the M1/M2 backbone) and other edge-on or slipped orientations (the PC71BM molecules lie on the side of the M1/M2 backbone or in slipped modes), see Fig. S4 (ESI†) for details. The calculated results are shown in Fig. 4 and the details are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). We find that the number of face-on configurations is much more than that of the edge-on or slipped configurations no matter which moiety of the donor docks with PC71BM. Moreover, the probability of docking PC71BM with BDT and RHD is higher than that with the π-bridge moieties of T1, T2 and T3. In the case of the face-on orientations, with increasing numbers of M2 molecules, the proportion of PC71BM interacting with BDT decreased from the binary system (17.37%) to the ternary systems (15.16% and 16.95%), while the fraction of PC71BM interacting with RHD slightly increased from 16.40% to 16.46% and 16.77%. This implies that the incorporation of M2 into the M1:PC71BM blend can reduce the contact between BDT and PC71BM but enhance the contact between RHD and PC71BM. To further confirm this point, the COM RDFs were also used to analyze the D–A interfacial arrangements. As can be seen in Fig. S5 (ESI†), consistent with the above results, the RDFs indicate that when introducing 10% M2 into the M1:PC71BM blend, the contact probability between BDT and PC71BM was significantly decreased.

3.4 Binding energy of the lowest CT state
It is known that a small binding energy is beneficial for the separation of the CT excitons into free charge carriers. Based on the M1/M2–PC71BM complexes extracted from the MD simulations, we calculated the average binding energies of the lowest CT state for the different types of intermolecular arrangements; the results are shown in Fig. 5 and the details are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). It was found that in each orientation, the average binding energy of the lowest CT state is the largest when PC71BM docks with BDT and decreases as PC71BM moves from the central unit to the end-capped RHD for all the blends. This indicates a larger probability of creating free charges when PC71BM docks with the terminal RHD moieties.

3.5 Electronic coupling for exciton dissociation and charge recombination
In order to obtain better performance of OSCs, the electronic coupling should be maximized for exciton dissociation (VED) and minimized for charge recombination (VCR). The calculated couplings are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S6 (ESI†) and summarized in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†). Considering that most of the donor–fullerene interfacial configurations in the four blends adopt face-on orientations, the role of edge-on or slipped orientations can be assumed to be negligible in the ED and CR processes. In the following, we will focus on the results of the face-on orientations. Interestingly, no matter which moiety of the donor molecule is close to PC71BM, the VED can always maintain a considerable value from 6 to 14 meV, ensuring efficient ED for all the blends. However, the situation is different for the CR process. VCR is more dependent on the intermolecular positions and decreases significantly when PC71BM moves from BDT to RHD (e.g., from 12.8 to 3 meV in the optimal ternary blend). This result suggests weaker charge recombination when PC71BM is close to the end-capped electron-withdrawing moieties.
 Fig. 6  Average electronic coupling for exciton dissociation (VED) and charge recombination (VCR) as a function of intermolecular arrangements for complexes with face-on orientations. 
It should be noted that with the addition of M2, VCR becomes smaller in the ternary system with respect to the binary system, especially in the cases of PC71BM docking with BDT, T2 and T3 moieties. This implies that in the optimal ternary blend, M2 can not only tune the PC71BM aggregation, but also modulate the D–A interfacial arrangements to suppress charge recombination. The calculated results fully demonstrate our previous experimental findings that the bimolecular recombination in the optimal ternary blend is the weakest.29
Combining the results from Fig. 4–6, we note that for the complexes where PC71BM docks with BDT, VCR and Eb are strong, which is unfavorable to charge generation. However, for the complexes where PC71BM docks with RHD, VCR and Eb become weak, leading to efficient charge generation owing to the large proportion of this type of complex. Moreover, upon introduction of M2 into the M1:PC71BM blend, there occurs an increase in the probability of finding PC71BM close to RHD and a decrease in the probability of finding PC71BM close to BDT, thus higher performance can be obtained for the optimal ternary blend solar cells.
4. Conclusions
In this contribution, molecular packing structures in the mixed region and electronic-structure properties based on DR3TBDTT (M1):DR3TBDTT-E (M2):PC71BM ternary solar cells have been investigated via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in combination with electronic-structure calculations. The simulated results indicate that (i) the existence of a certain amount of M2 molecules can decrease [increase] the probability of docking the PC71BM molecules with the central electron-donating BDT moiety [end-capped electron-withdrawing RHD moiety]. However, with a further increase of the doping ratio of M2, PC71BM aggregation will be reduced, which is not beneficial for electron transport. (ii) Our calculations imply that in the optimal ternary blends, exciton dissociation should be very efficient for the complexes in which PC71BM docks with all the conjugated moieties of donors; however, charge recombination is very dependent on the intermolecular positions and decreases significantly when PC71BM moves from the central BDT to the terminal RHD moiety. (iii) Owing to both the large proportion of complexes for PC71BM docking with the RHD moiety and relatively low binding energies of the CT states, superior performance can be obtained for the optimal ternary blend solar cells. To get a balance between low recombination and high charge carrier mobility, a proper amount of the third component is needed in the ternary blends.
These findings are very consistent with the experimental evolution of the device performance as a function of the doping ratio. Our work provides the first molecular insight into the structure–property relationships for ternary organic solar cells and will be helpful for the rational design of ternary systems toward high-performance organic solar cells.
