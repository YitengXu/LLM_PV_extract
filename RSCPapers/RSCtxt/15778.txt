    , Accepted 26th April 2012First published on 26th April 2012AbstractIncessant interest has been shown in the synthesis of graphene (GR)–semiconductor nanocomposites as photocatalysts aiming to utilize the excellent electron conductivity of GR to lengthen the lifetime of photoexcited charge carriers in the semiconductor and, hence, improve the photoactivity. However, research works focused on investigating how to make sufficient use of the unique electron conductivity of GR to design a more efficient GR–semiconductor photocatalyst have been quite lacking. Here, we show a proof-of-concept study on improving the photocatalytic performance of GR–TiO2 nanocomposites via a combined strategy of decreasing defects of GR and improving the interfacial contact between GR and the semiconductor TiO2. The GR–TiO2 nanocomposite fabricated by this approach is able to make more sufficient use of the electron conductivity of GR, by which the lifetime and transfer of photoexcited charge carriers of GR–TiO2 upon visible light irradiation will be improved more efficiently. This in turn leads to the enhancement of visible-light-driven photoactivity of GR–TiO2 toward selective transformation of alcohols to corresponding aldehydes using molecular oxygen as a benign oxidant under ambient conditions. It is anticipated that our current work would inform ongoing efforts to exploit the rational design of smart, more efficient GR–semiconductor photocatalysts for conversion of solar to chemical energy by heterogeneous photocatalysis.
Introduction
Waltzing with graphene (GR) in the synthesis of graphene-based nanoassemblies for potential applications continues to be a very popular subject in numerous fields of current nanoscience and nanotechnology.1–15 In particular, the unique structural and electronic properties of GR, including the giant 2D structure, theoretically high surface area and excellent electron conductivity, have spurred immense interest in the fabrication of GR–semiconductor nanocomposites as photocatalysts for a wide range of applications, ranging from degradation of organic pollutants, water splitting to clean H2, reduction of CO2 for solar fuel production, and selective organic transformation to fine chemicals.16–31 Notably, most research works reported so far are inclined to simply attribute the enhanced photoactivity of GR–semiconductor nanocomposites to the excellent electron conductivity of GR or the role of GR as a reservoir in electron capture/transport, which can boost the lifetime of photoexcited electron–hole pairs from the semiconductor upon light irradiation.16,17,19–31 However, very little is known about how to make sufficient use of the well-known electron conductivity of GR to rationally synthesize more efficient GR–semiconductor nanocomposites with improved photoactivity for specific reactions.
Recently, we have shown that increasing the interfacial contact between GR and the semiconductor TiO2 is a viable approach to improve the photoactivity of GR–TiO2 nanocomposites.32 In order to achieve a more efficient GR-based photocatalyst, the superior and easily accessible “structure-directing” role of graphene oxide (the precursor of GR) in a solution phase should be harnessed sufficiently,32–34 by which the interfacial contact between GR and TiO2 can be maximized, therefore resulting in sufficient utilization of electron conductivity of GR, improvement of the lifetime of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and enhanced photocatalytic activity.32 The abundance of oxygen moieties spread throughout the graphene oxide (GO) surface signifies the versatile richness of wet chemistry of GO, which can potentially be utilized as a fertile playground for designing smart GR-based composites as photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.4,5,12,32–34 However, it should be pointed out that the preparation of GO is generally performed by a modified Hummers method,16–31,35,36 which involves an extremely strong oxidation process to exfoliate graphite in a solution phase; this inevitably introduces a significant amount of defects in the platform of GO and GR–semiconductor nanocomposites followed by the reduction of GO to GR.18
Hersam's group recently has reported that, as compared to GR obtained by reduction of GO using a modified Hummers method, the solvent exfoliated GR (SEG) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) has much lower defects density, which endows SEG with the improved electrical mobility and a longer electronic mean free path, thereby decreasing the likelihood of the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the SEG–P25 nanocomposite upon light irradiation.18 This consequently contributes to the enhancement of photocatalytic performance of SEG–P25 nanocomposites for selective reduction of CO2 and oxidation of CH3CHO. Their results suggest that a promising way to improve GR–TiO2 photocatalysts may benefit from careful consideration of the electrical properties of the graphene component. However, a “solid” integration of P25 nanoparticles with SEG is not an ideal choice to reach a sufficient interfacial contact between P25 and the SEG surface.32
These pioneering works promote us to envision that, if the GR–TiO2 nanocomposite is fabricated via a combined strategy of decreasing defects of GR and strengthening the interfacial contact between the TiO2 ingredient and the GR surface, a much more efficient GR–TiO2 photocatalyst with improved activity could be obtained. To verify whether such an inferred idea is feasible or not, we now embark on a proof-of-concept investigation on rationally synthesizing the GR–TiO2 nanocomposites via such a proposed combined strategy. By the slight modification of synthesis procedures, the water-soluble precursor of TiO2, i.e. TiF4, can be well spread onto the 2D platform of SEG to realize an intimate interfacial contact, while the utilization of SEG instead of GO as the precursor of GR decreases the defects density of the graphene matrix. The photocatalytic activity test for selective oxidation of alcohols under visible light irradiation demonstrates that the as-synthesized SEG–TiO2 nanocomposites have the enhanced photoactivity as compared to GR–TiO2 with higher defects density. In addition, the photoactivity of SEG–TiO2 is also much higher than SEG–P25 prepared by a “solid” integration of SEG and P25 nanoparticles. Our current work significantly highlights the importance of rational “design” of more efficient graphene–semiconductor nanocomposites, therefore enabling the improved photocatalytic performance for target applications in the field of conversion of solar to chemical energy.
Experimental
Catalyst preparation
Solvent exfoliated graphene (SEG) with lower defects density was synthesized from natural graphite powder by an exfoliation method in the organic solvent.18 Typically, 1 g of graphite powder (supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) was put into 100 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and sufficiently subjected to ultrasonication 10 times for 3 h consecutively. After that, the as-obtained homogeneous solution was separated by centrifugation and washed with anhydrous ethanol, HCl aqueous solution (vHCl∶vH2O = 1∶10), and deionized water, respectively. Subsequently, the product was fully dried at room temperature to get the final SEG sample. Graphene oxide (GO) with higher defects density was synthesized by a modified Hummers method (ESI†),35,36 which was used in our previous research work.16,32
The synthesis of SEG–TiO2 nanocomposites was performed as follows. Typically, SEG was ultrasonicated in 200 mL of deionized water to disperse it evenly. Then, 0.062 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (average MW: 40000) was added to this solution, and the mixture was stirred magnetically for 24 h to get a homogeneous solution. After that, 4.0 g of TiF4 was added to the given amount of the above PVP–SEG solution to prepare SEG–TiO2 nanocomposites with different weight addition ratios of SEG. This mixture solution was ultrasonicated for 1 h and then heated to 333 K in an open oil-bath kept with magnetic stirring for 24 h. The mixture was then filtered, washed until the pH of rinse water became neutral, and fully dried at 333 K in an oven. The as-obtained SEG–TiO2 was then dispersed in 26 mL of deionized water and 13 mL of anhydrous ethanol solution with vigorous stirring for 0.5 h to obtain a homogeneous suspension. After that, it was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-sealed autoclave and maintained at 393 K for 12 h. The products were cooled to room temperature and recovered by filtration, washed with water, and fully dried at 333 K in an oven to get the final SEG–TiO2 nanocomposites with different weight addition ratios of SEG, namely 1, 5, 10, 30, and 50% SEG–TiO2. For comparison, the synthesis of GR–TiO2 nanocomposites using GO as the precursor of GR was reported previously,32 which is similar to that of SEG–TiO2 reported herein except that the addition of PVP was absent.
The synthesis of SEG–P25 nanocomposites was performed as follows. Typically, SEG was dispersed into 60 mL of deionized water and 30 mL of anhydrous ethanol solution completely by ultrasonication, and then 0.6 g of P25 was added to the given amount of the above SEG solution to prepare 1, 5, 10, 30, 50% SEG–P25 nanocomposites. The mixture solution was aged with vigorous stirring for 2 h to obtain a homogenous suspension. After that, it was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-sealed autoclave and maintained at 393 K for 24 h. The resulting composite was recovered by filtration, washed with water, and fully dried at 333 K in an oven to get the final P25–SEG nanocomposite with different weight addition ratios of SEG. For comparison, the GR–P25 nanocomposites were also synthesized using the similar approach except that GO instead of SEG was used as the precursor of GR, which was already reported previously.16
Characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The optical properties of the samples were analyzed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary-500, Varian Co. Ltd), in which BaSO4 was used as the background. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of the samples was analyzed by nitrogen (N2) adsorption in a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by a field emission SEM on a FEI Nova NANOSEM 230 spectrophotometer. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a Renishaw inVia Raman System 1000 with a 532 nm Nd:YAG excitation source at room temperature. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using an Edinburgh Analytical Instrument PLS920 system. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab250 spectrometer which consists of a monochromatic Al Kα as the X-ray source, a hemispherical analyzer and a sample stage with multi-axial adjustability to obtain the composition on the surface of samples.
The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a home-made three electrode quartz cell with a PAR VMP3 Multi Potentiostat apparatus. A Pt plate was used as a counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as a reference electrode, while the working electrode was prepared on fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) conductor glass. The sample powder (10 mg) was ultrasonicated in 1 mL of anhydrous ethanol to disperse it evenly to get the slurry. The slurry was spread onto FTO glass whose side part was previously protected using a Scotch tape. The working electrode was dried overnight under ambient conditions. A copper wire was connected to the side part of the working electrode using a conductive tape. Uncoated parts of the electrode were isolated with epoxy resin. The electrolyte was 0.2 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution without an additive (pH = 6.8). The visible light irradiation source was a 300 W Xe arc lamp system equipped with a UV cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm). The mass density of the composite loaded on the FTO electrode is 8 mg cm−2. The power density on the sample loaded FTO electrode was the area of 0.25 cm2 irradiated with the light intensity of 300 mW, which was measured by a light intensity photometer.
Photoactivity test
Photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols was performed under ambient conditions, i.e., room temperature and atmospheric pressure.32,48–52 Typically, alcohol (0.1 mmol) and 8 mg of the catalyst were dissolved in the benzotrifluoride (BTF) solvent (1.5 mL) saturated with pure molecular oxygen. BTF solvent was chosen because of its inertness to oxidation, high solubility for molecular oxygen and the stability of graphene upon visible light irradiation in the BTF medium.32 This mixture was transferred into a 10 mL Pyrex glass bottle filled with molecular oxygen at a pressure of 0.1 MPa. The suspensions were irradiated by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd.) with a UV-cutoff filter (λ > 400 nm). For the photocatalytic reaction, the light intensity was 300 mW with an irradiation area of 0.75 cm2. After the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged to completely remove the catalyst particles. The remaining solution was analyzed with an Agilent Gas Chromatograph (GC-7820 fitted with a capillary FFAP analysis column). The assignment of products was confirmed by a Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph–Mass Spectrometer (HP-5973GC/MS). Conversion of alcohol, yield of aldehyde and selectivity for aldehyde were defined as follows:Conversion (%) = [(C0 − Cr)/C0] × 100Yield (%) = Cp/C0 × 100Selectivity (%) = [Cp/(C0 − Cr)] × 100where C0 is the initial concentration of alcohol, Cr and Cp are the concentrations of the alcohol substrate and the corresponding target product, aldehyde, respectively, after the photocatalytic reaction.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1A shows the typical Raman spectra of the solvent exfoliated graphene (SEG) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and graphene oxide (GO) prepared by a modified Hummers method,16,32,35,36 using the same graphite source material. Of particular note is the intensity ratio of the D and G bands, ID/IG, which is a measure of the relative concentration of local defects or disorders (particularly the sp3 hybridized defects) compared to the sp2 hybridized graphene domains.18,32 As can be seen clearly, the ID/IG ratio is 0.18 for SEG, which is remarkably lower than 1.01 for GO. This indicates the much lower defects density of SEG as compared to GO, thus suggesting the successful synthesis of graphene with lower defects density, which is also in agreement with the previous report.18 The other structural feature is that, for SEG, the amount of surface oxygen-containing functional groups is significantly lower than that for GO, which can be reflected by the direct comparison of C 1s spectra between GO and SEG as displayed in Fig. 1C and D. In addition, from the photograph as shown in Fig. 1B, we can see that the colour of GO and SEG dispersions in water is remarkably different. In particular, the GO dispersion in water exhibits a brilliant yellow color, which indicates the richness of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of GO.16,32

The abundance of hydrophilic functional groups on the GO surface makes it act as “a big macromolecular surfactant” well dispersed in an aqueous phase and, meanwhile, offers numerous reactive sites to sufficiently interact with the water-soluble precursor of TiO2, i.e. TiF4.32 Followed by hydrothermal reduction of GO to GR,16,17 the TiO2–GR nanocomposites with intimate interfacial contact can be easily obtained.32 However, when SEG was used instead of GO dispersed in water, the same synthesis approach cannot lead to such a sufficient interfacial contact because the significant shortage of hydrophilic functional groups on the SEG surface causes the outcome that, in an aqueous phase, SEG is not able to behave as a “GO-like” macromolecular surfactant promoting the TiO2 ingredient to sufficiently spread onto its giant 2D surface. In order to resolve this deficiency, a moderate amount of a polymer, i.e., polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), is introduced as an interface linker to functionalize the surface of SEG.11 This slight modification endows the SEG surface with additional hydrophilic functional groups, thus making SEG well dispersed and stable in an aqueous phase, which can be regarded as being “roughly” similar to the abundant functional groups of GO prepared by a strong oxidation Hummers method. However, the different key point is that the mild functionalization of SEG with PVP at room temperature will not introduce a significant amount of defects into the SEG surface. Importantly, this PVP-modified SEG well dispersed in water is able to promote the TiF4 precursor to sufficiently interact with the SEG surface. Consequently, we can achieve a TiO2–SEG nanocomposite featuring both intimate interfacial contact and much lower defects density as compared to the previous TiO2–GR obtained by the similar preparation approach,32 as will be discussed later.

Fig. 2A shows the typical XRD patterns of the as-prepared TiO2–SEG nanocomposites with different weight addition ratios of SEG, respectively. The peaks at 2θ values of about 25.3°, 37.8°, 48.0°, 53.9°, 55.0°, 62.7°, 68.8°, 70.3°, and 75.0° can be indexed to (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), and (215) crystal planes of anatase TiO2. Similar to the previous TiO2–GR nanocomposites using GO as the precursor of graphene,32 no typical diffraction peaks of the separate SEG are detected, which could be ascribed to the two probable reasons. One is that the relatively low diffraction intensity of graphene at ca. 25.0° might be overlapped with the (101) peak of anatase TiO2. The other is probably due to the disappearance of the layer-stacking regularity after redox of graphite.37Fig. 2B displays the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the TiO2–SEG nanocomposites. In line with the previous TiO2–GR nanocomposites, the addition of SEG induces the improved light absorption intensity in the visible light region as compared to the bare P25 nanoparticles.16,17,32 A qualitative red shift to a higher wavelength is observed in the absorption edge of TiO2–SEG nanocomposites. Therefore, the introduction of SEG is able to effectively promote the visible light response of the TiO2–SEG nanocomposites. Such an extended optical absorption has also been observed in previous research works with regard to the semiconductor–carbon (graphene or carbon nanotubes) photocatalysts, which can be ascribed to electronic interactions between TiO2 and carbon (graphene or carbon nanotubes).16–31,38–43

Fig. 3A shows the photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde over the as-prepared TiO2–SEG nanocomposites under visible light irradiation. For comparison, the results over TiO2–GR prepared by using GO as the precursor of graphene are also shown in Fig. 3B.32 It can be seen that, among those TiO2–SEG nanocomposites, the TiO2–5% SEG nanocomposite exhibits the best photocatalytic performance. Upon visible light irradiation for 4 h, we can get ca. 51% conversion of benzyl alcohol and ca. 100% selectivity to the target product, benzaldehyde. That is, 51% yield of the target product is obtained which is much higher than the 30% yield using the previous TiO2–5% GR nanocomposite under identical reaction conditions.32 Obviously, the use of SEG with lower defects density instead of GO with higher defects density contributes to the photoactivity enhancement of TiO2–graphene nanocomposites. In addition, it should be noted that, when SEG was used instead of GO, the optimum addition ratio of graphene in the TiO2–graphene nanocomposites is unchanged, i.e., the optimum addition ratio of SEG or GR is 5%. This also indicates the importance of controlling the addition ratios of graphene in order to achieve an optimal synergistic interaction between graphene and TiO2 for achievement of the best photoactivity of TiO2–graphene nanocomposites.16,18,32 Excessive addition of GR in TiO2–graphene nanocomposites means the significant amount decrease of primary photoactive ingredient TiO2 and meanwhile lowers the light intensity through the depth of reaction solution.32

Also, the excessive addition of graphene in TiO2–graphene nanocomposites will lead to a decrease of selectivity. In addition to benzaldehyde, other by-products such as benzoic acid and CO2 are produced. We have also tested the photocatalytic performance of P25–SEG nanocomposites prepared by a simple random integration of solid TiO2 nanoparticles (taking P25 as an example) with SEG. Based on the data in Fig. S1 (ESI†), it can be seen that, when SEG was used instead of GO as the precursor of GR to prepare P25–SEG nanocomposites, the yield of benzaldehyde is ca. 32% over the optimum photocatalyst P25–1% SEG. In contrast, over the optimum photocatalyst P25–1% GR, the yield is only ca. 13%.32 Therefore, it is clear that the TiO2–5% SEG shows the best photocatalytic performance under identical reaction conditions.
To investigate the possible effect of PVP modification on the photocatalytic performance, we have also prepared the TiO2–5% GR nanocomposite using the PVP-modified GO as the precursor of GR, which is similar to that of PVP-modified SEG as mentioned above. The photoactivity test as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) clearly suggests that the PVP modification has a negligible effect on the photocatalytic performance of the graphene and TiO2 nanocomposites. In addition, it should be mentioned that no obvious degradation of SEG is observed for TiO2–5% SEG during the photocatalytic reaction because there is no significant change of the ID/IG ratio for the used TiO2–5% SEG as compared to the fresh one.32,44,45 This is faithfully evidenced by the Raman spectra in Fig. 4. The stability or integrity of graphene subject to visible light irradiation in the BTF solvent is in agreement with the previous observation.32 Blank experiments performed in the absence of catalysts and/or visible light show that no conversion of alcohols is observed, confirming that the reaction is really driven by a photocatalytic process. A controlled experiment in the presence of nitrogen shows trace conversion of alcohols, proving that oxygen is the primary oxidant that selectively oxidizes alcohols to corresponding aldehydes.
 Fig. 4  Raman spectra of the fresh and used photocatalysts TiO2–5% SEG and TiO2–5% GR after visible light irradiation in the reaction system. 
To ensure if this photoactivity enhancement is general, we have also performed the selective oxidation of other substituted benzylic alcohols and allylic alcohols over these optimum photocatalysts including TiO2–5% SEG, TiO2–5% GR, P25–1% SEG and P25–1% GR. The data, as shown in Fig. 5, clearly suggest that TiO2–5% SEG shows the best photocatalytic performance toward selective oxidation of alcohols to corresponding aldehydes. Fig. 6 displays the typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of bare SEG and the optimum TiO2–5% SEG nanocomposite. It can be seen that, similar to the previous TiO2–5% GR nanocomposite using GO as the precursor of graphene,32 the intimate interfacial contact between TiO2 and the SEG sheet has been successfully achieved. Along with the Raman spectra for TiO2–5% SEG in Fig. 5, it can be concluded that, as mentioned above, the TiO2–graphene nanocomposite featuring both the intimate interfacial contact and lower defects density has been successfully obtained by our preparation approach. The above photoactivity test demonstrates that the photocatalytic performance of TiO2–graphene nanocomposites can be rationally improved by optimizing the preparation methods and sufficiently harnessing the electron conductivity of graphene. Significantly, our current results obviously suggest that the combined strategy of decreasing defects of graphene and increasing the interfacial contact between TiO2 ingredient and graphene is a viable and promising way that allows us to make more sufficient use of the electron conductivity of graphene to lengthen the lifetime and promote the transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs from the semiconductor TiO2 upon visible light irradiation. To better understand this standpoint, we have then used the photoelectrochemical and the photoluminescence spectra to characterize these TiO2 and graphene nanocomposites.

Fig. 7 shows the photocurrent transient response for the nanocomposites TiO2–5% SEG, TiO2–5% GR, P25–1% SEG and P25–1% GR upon visible light irradiation. As is clearly seen, the TiO2–5% SEG sample shows the stable and highest photocurrent density under visible light irradiation as compared to the other samples. Once the light is switched off, the photocurrent is rapidly decreased to zero. Furthermore, it should be noted that the use of SEG instead of GO as the precursor of graphene is beneficial for improving the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers, which can be reflected by the higher photocurrent density of TiO2–5% SEG than TiO2–5% GR. Similarly, the photocurrent density of P25–1% SEG is also higher than P25–1% GR. These suggest that the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers is able to be remarkably boosted by the combined strategy of decreasing defects of graphene and increasing the interfacial contact between TiO2 and the graphene surface.

Fig. 8 shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots of the electrode samples TiO2–5% SEG, TiO2–5% GR, P25–1% SEG and P25–1% GR upon visible light irradiation, all of which show depressed semicircles at high frequencies. Because the preparation methods of the electrodes and electrolyte used are alike, the high frequency semicircle is related to the resistance of the electrodes.46 The high-frequency arc corresponds to the charge transfer limiting process and can be attributed to the double-layer capacitance in parallel with the charge transfer resistance at the contact interface between the electrode and electrolyte solution.47 It is clear that the photocatalyst TiO2–5% SEG has the smallest arc as compared to other photocatalysts, thus suggesting the most efficient interfacial charge transfer over TiO2–5% SEG, which is in line with its highest photocurrent transient response under visible light irradiation (Fig. 7).

The improved efficiency in inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers of TiO2 by the use of SEG with lower defects density can be further supported by the photoluminescence (PL) spectra analysis. The PL spectra are often employed to study surface processes involving the electron–hole fate of the semiconductor TiO2.18,40,41 With the electron–hole pairs recombination after a photocatalyst is irradiated, photons are emitted, which results in photoluminescence. This behavior is due to the reverse radiative deactivation from the excited state of the Ti species. As shown in Fig. 9, the addition of graphene will lead to the PL quenching. In particular, the PL intensity of TiO2–5% SEG is lower than TiO2–5% GR, while that of P25–1% SEG is lower than P25–1% GR. Notably, the TiO2–5% SEG shows the most significantly diminished PL intensity as compared to the bare P25 nanoparticles and other samples, thus indicating the most efficient inhibition of charge carriers recombination, which seems to be well consistent with its highest photoactivity toward selective oxidation of alcohols.
 Fig. 9  Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples TiO2–5% SEG, TiO2–5% GR, P25–1% SEG, P25–1% GR and bare P25 nanoparticles. 
The above characterizations of photoelectrochemical and PL spectra suggest that the electron conductivity of graphene can be more efficiently utilized in the preparation of TiO2–graphene nanocomposites via a combined strategy of decreasing defects of graphene and increasing interfacial contact between TiO2 and the graphene surface. As a result, the fate and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers are able to be remarkably enhanced, which in turn results in a more efficient TiO2–graphene photocatalyst, i.e., TiO2–5% SEG, with improved visible-light-driven photocatalytic performance toward selective oxidation of alcohols under ambient conditions.
To further ensure that the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers is the most predominant factor determining the overall photocatalytic performance of TiO2–graphene toward selective oxidation of alcohols, we have performed the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area analysis of these samples. Fig. 10 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution. The surface area of TiO2–5% SEG, TiO2–5% GR, P25–1% SEG and P25–1% GR is ca. 70 m2 g−1, 69 m2 g−1, 64 m2 g−1 and 65 m2 g−1, respectively. In addition, it can be seen that there is no significant difference in their total pore volume and porosity. These indicate that the surface area and porosity difference are unlikely the major factors leading to the large discrepancy in their photoactivities. A similar issue has also been observed for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 and oxidation of CH3CHO over P25–graphene nanocomposites.18 In addition, the very similar XRD patterns and morphology of TiO2–5% SEG and TiO2–5% GR32 suggest that the particle size, crystal phase and morphology of TiO2 in these two samples are almost the same. Therefore, these factors are also not the primary reason leading to the large photoactivity difference between TiO2–5% SEG and TiO2–5% GR.
 Fig. 10  The adsorption–desorption isotherms of the samples TiO2–5% SEG, TiO2–5% GR, P25–1% SEG and P25–1% GR; inset is the corresponding pore size distribution. 
Thus, it can be concluded that the lifetime of photogenerated electron–hole pairs is the key and predominant factor that determines the overall photocatalytic activity order of TiO2–graphene nanocomposites toward selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. The utilization of SEG instead of GO as the precursor of graphene along with strengthening interfacial contact between TiO2 and the graphene surface is a feasible approach to improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2–graphene because it enables us to sufficiently harness the electron conductivity of graphene to achieve a more efficient TiO2–graphene nanocomposite with enhanced photoactivity for synthesis of fine chemicals by selective oxidation under ambient conditions.
Conclusions
In summary, we have for the first time reported a proof-of-concept study of improving the photocatalytic performance of TiO2–graphene nanocomposites via a combined strategy of decreasing defects of GR and improving interfacial contact between TiO2 and the graphene surface. This approach can allow us to make more efficient use of the electron conductivity of graphene, thereby increasing the fate and promoting transfer of photogenerated charge carriers over TiO2–graphene upon visible light irradiation. This consequently results in the photoactivity enhancement of TiO2–graphene toward selective transformation of alcohols to aldehydes under ambient conditions. This proposed strategy could be extended to prepare other semiconductor–graphene nanocomposites with improved photocatalytic performance for target applications. Our work highlights the key importance of rational fabrication of semiconductor–graphene nanocomposites with improved photocatalytic performance toward specific applications. Research efforts in this respect would significantly advance us to sufficiently harness the electron conductivity and the unique 2D structure feature of graphene to design a more efficient semiconductor–graphene nanocomposite for conversion of solar to chemical energy by heterogeneous photocatalysis.
