    , Accepted 23rd February 2019First published on 25th February 2019AbstractOxygen defects play a crucial role in a variety of functional transition metal oxides, ranging from photocatalytic materials to photoelectric devices. Tungsten oxide (WO3−x) is a type of transition metal oxide that has rich substoichiometric compositions and possesses oxygen defects. These oxygen defects determine the photon–electron interactions in the WO3−x structures. Therein, WO3−x quantum dots (QDs) exhibit fast carrier-transport for photon–electron interactions due to their strong quantum-size effects. Here, we report the use of non-stoichiometric WO3−x QDs, as a model material, in combination with silver nanowires (Ag NWs) to study photon–electron interactions on the nanoscale. We demonstrate that the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency can be increased by 8.5% and that the dye photodegradation performance was improved by 40% in a WO2.72 QD@Ag NW (WO2.72 QDs supported on AgNWs) composite compared to those of individual WO2.72 QDs under simulated AM 1.5G light. Furthermore, the WO3−x QD@Ag NW composite exhibits both photocatalytic activity and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) features, and the WO3−x QDs can be switched between a “photocatalytic state” and a “SERS state” by changing the stoichiometric ratio. The synergistic effects are ascribed to the “plasmonic state” of WO2.72 QDs upon light irradiation. This work provides new insight into the design of highly efficient transition metal oxide/plasmonic metal nanocomposites for photoelectric devices.
1. Introduction
Tungsten oxide (WO3−x), a transition metal oxide, has been reported for use in applications such as electrochromic devices,1 solar cells,2 gas sensors3 and photocatalysis.4 In comparison to bulk materials, WO3−x nanostructures possess strong quantum-size (Q-size) effects and a high surface-to-volume ratio, resulting in efficient photoelectric interactions.5 In particular, WO3−x quantum dots (QDs) often exhibit larger surface-to-volume ratios than other WO3−x structures,6 thereby facilitating intimate contact between the WO3−x QDs and adsorbed molecules, which provides the preconditions for hot-carrier generation and transport. Nevertheless, visible light is the source of energy for photocatalysis and photovoltaic conversion. The wide energy bandgap of 2.9–4.2 eV of WO3−x QDs exceeds the visible wavelength range (1.6–3.3 eV), which limits their visible light-responsive solar-energy conversion.6–8 Meanwhile, the low conduction band (CB) level of pure WO3 not only increases the recombination rate of photo-induced electron–hole pairs but also limits its ability to react with electron acceptors, such as oxygen, which significantly reduces its photocatalytic activities.9,10 Among the numerous methods for tuning the electronic structure characteristics of WO3, introducing oxygen vacancies represents one of the main strategies for achieving high photocatalytic activity. Earlier studies have shown that WO3−x with various substoichiometric compositions, such as WO2.72, WO2.83 and WO2.92, can be obtained by the reduction and formation of various types of defect structures.11–14 WO3−x is an n-type semiconductor, and the electron concentration in WO3−x depends mainly on the stoichiometric defect concentration.15,16 In recent years, a variety of defect-induced photoelectric performance variations in WO3−x have been proposed. Cong6 suggested that the presence of oxygen deficiencies in WO2.72 could help amplify the spectroscopic signatures in stimulated Raman scattering. Cheng2 reported that the oxygen vacancies in WO2.83 played a critical role in generating exceptional plasmon resonance and contributed to its dramatically enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity relative to that of meso-WO3. Wang found that oxygen-deficient WO2.92 nanoflakes showed excellent photostability for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting.16 However, the mechanism by which the defects on the surface of WO3−x affects the photon–electron interactions is not sufficiently understood and ambiguity remains in the current criteria. Therefore, obtaining rigorous experimental proof that defect structures are the primary cause of the photoelectric activity differences in WO3−x nanostructures is challenging.
In particular, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) arising on the surface of noble metal nanostructures can induce sharp spectral absorption and scattering peaks as well as strong electromagnetic near-field enhancements.17–19 Therefore, the SPR of metallic nanostructures is now widely used to enhance light absorption, known as plasmon-induced charge transfer (PICT), either by improving the efficiency of photocatalysis or the photovoltaics.20–22 Especially for localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which is the confinement of SPR within a nanostructure of a size comparable to the wavelength of light, obvious enhancement of the localized electromagnetic (EM) field coupling is exhibited at the interfaces of plasmonic nanostructures within an extremely confined area. Plasmonic photocatalysis refers mainly to the LSPR and the corresponding synergistic effects. Therefore, combining a wide bandgap semiconductor with plasmonic metals provides three benefits: first, plasmonic metal nanostructures on the surface of the semiconductor can play a role as electron traps and form Schottky junctions, thereby possibly decreasing the recombination rate of photoinduced electron–hole pairs in the semiconductor.23,24 Second, as a co-catalyst, some noble metal nanostructures can lower the overpotentials of various redox reactions.25 Third, the LSPR in plasmonic metal nanostructures suffers from significant decay, with most of the plasmonic energy loss (Landau damping) leading to a high number of hot electron–hole pairs, which can provide “hot electrons” for wide bandgap semiconductors to enable the conversion of visible light into chemical energy.26–28 That is, upon resonant illumination by an external electric field, the conduction electrons in the plasmonic metal are driven to generate LSPR. The LSPR can then decay non-radiatively by transferring photon energy to hot electrons that transiently populate electronic states above the Fermi level of the metal.29 When plasmonic metal nanomaterials are proximal to a semiconductor with a dense manifold of conduction band (CB) states, the hot electrons can be directly injected into the energetically accessible CB levels of the semiconductor.30 These hot carriers are capable of inducing a chemical reaction. In addition, the LSPR can decay radiatively via re-emitted photons, consequently generating surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).31,32 Thus, the synergetic effects of WO3−x QD/plasmonic metal composite nanostructures with different dimensional levels often lead to significant improvements in the photoelectric performance. Based on these properties, by combining the WO3−x QDs with noble metal nanostructures, the series of synergetic effects induced by photon–electron interactions can be investigated further.
In this study, we argue that these donor-specific sites (oxygen defects) play a crucial role in and may dictate the ensuing photon–electron interactions, such as providing “hot electrons” for photocatalysis and SERS (Scheme 1a–c). This work is composed of three parts. First, we report that Ag NWs were chosen as a support for WO3−x QDs to generate LSPR uniformly, while the plasmonic metal served as an electron donor for hot-electron transport. Unusually, we have not loaded metal nanoclusters onto this wide-bandgap WO3−x nanostructure but rather attached the WO3−x QDs to a plasmonic-metal network composed of Ag NW structures. This design is favourable for SERS generation, which offers a pathway to observe the radiative decay of the LSPR at the WO3−x QD/Ag NW interface. Second, combined with the SERS analyses and the photocatalysis experiments, we found a curious anomaly in two kinds of WO3−x with different stoichiometric compositions. Specifically, by employing a series of electrochemical tests and finite-difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, we demonstrated that the anomaly is caused by a synergistic effect between SERS and the LSPR-mediated enhancement of photocatalysis, and oxygen deficiencies played a pivotal role in this photon–electron interaction. These results could be beneficial for researchers attempting to design efficient photoelectric devices.
 Scheme 1  (a) LSPR occurs on the surface of the WO3−x QD@Ag NW structure. (b) LSPR can decay via non-radiative Landau damping, resulting in the excitation of hot electrons and holes. Hot electrons with high energies can overcome the Schottky barrier, φSB = φM − χs, thereby being injected into the conduction band of an adjacent WO3−x QD, where φM is the work function of the Ag NWs and χs is the electron affinity of the WO3−x QDs. (c) LSPR can decay radiatively via the re-emission of photons, thereby inducing SERS. Irradiation-time-dependent Raman measurements can observe the synergistic effects of LSPR-induced enhancement of photocatalysis and SERS. (d) The formation mechanism of the as-prepared WO3 QDs (Sample 1) and WO3−x QDs (Sample 2). In a typical preparation process, the anhydrous environment plays a significant role in determining the amount of oxygen defects in WO3−x QDs, which lead to the formation of hexagonal channels. (e) The XRD patterns of WO3 QDs and WO3−x QDs, the result confirmed the formation of monoclinic WO3 QDs and WO2.72 QDs. The obvious broadening of diffraction peaks is attributed to ultrasmall crystalline sizes for WO3 QDs and WO2.72 QDs. 
2. Results and discussion
High annealing temperatures are required to obtain well crystalline WO3−x; however, they lead to a considerable decrease in the number of photoelectric active sites and the specific surface area.33,34 Given this, we introduce a mild solvothermal method to synthesize WO3−x QDs (Scheme 1d). This method was based on a previously published literature (detailed in the Experimental section).8 In a typical preparation process, the formation of monodisperse WO3−x QDs involved the polymerization of a tungsten–glycerin complex and a dissolution process. Instead of employing ethylene glycol, glycerin was used as a strong size-limiting capping agent, resulting in the isotropic growth of the WO3−x QDs. Meanwhile, the anhydrous glycerin environment limits the tungsten-ion motion in the system, which leads to the formation of oxygen deficiencies in the WO3−x QDs. Conversely, trace amounts of water in glycerin facilitate tungsten-ion migration, resulting in the perfect crystallization of the WO3 QDs. As shown in Scheme 1e, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed the formation of monoclinic WO3 QDs (JCPDS card 83-0951) and WO2.72 QDs (JCPDS card 73-2177), which are analogous to another study.12 Here, the obvious broadening of diffraction peaks is attributed to ultrasmall crystalline sizes for the WO3 QDs and WO2.72 QDs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the WO3−x QD@Ag NWs (WO3−x QDs supported on AgNWs) are shown in Fig. 1a and b; these WO3−x QDs are relatively evenly distributed across the Ag NW networks. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to verify the valence states and composition of tungsten in the as-synthesized WO3−x QD samples. Fig. 1c and d show the high-resolution W 4f XPS spectra and the corresponding deconvolution results for the two kinds of WO3−x samples synthesized in this work. A doublet with a spin-orbital interval of 2.1 eV at 37.7 eV (W6+ 4f5/2) and 35.6 eV (W6+ 4f7/2) is observed in both sample 1 and sample 2. The doublet peaks centred at 37.1 eV and 35.0 eV are ascribed to the spin–orbit splitting of W5+ 4f5/2 and W5+ 4f7/2, respectively, revealing the existence of oxygen defects in sample 2.12,35 Additionally, the oxygen defects in sample 2 can be confirmed by the O 1s peak for adsorbed oxygen species at the defect sites (Fig. S1†).36 The tungsten components in sample 2 are fit to the W6+ and W5+ oxidation states (46% and 54%), confirming that the stoichiometric ratios of the as-prepared samples are WO3 and WO2.72 (W18O49), which are in accordance with XRD results.

Fig. 2a and b depict the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of the obtained WO3−x QD@Ag NW. The HAADF-STEM images show a brighter contrast on the edges of the Ag NW, revealing a local enrichment of the heavier silver atoms. The hybrid structural feature is confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 2a1–a3 and b1–b3). Whereas silver (blue colour) is mainly located in the central region, tungsten (red colour) and oxygen (green colour) are evenly distributed over the nanowire surface. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Fig. 2e and f) are collected in the region of the red rectangle in Fig. 2c and d. The distances between adjacent lattice fringes in the WO3−x QD@Ag NW interface are measured to be 0.36 nm, 0.37 nm and 0.38 nm for both samples, in agreement with the lattice spacings of the WO3 (200), (020), and (002) planes, respectively, and suggesting a relatively stable distribution of the WO3−x QDs. Meanwhile, the as-prepared WO3 QD@Ag NW and WO2.72 QD@Ag NW indicated no obvious differences in elemental content and morphology (Fig. S2 and S3†).

To investigate the photon–electron interactions in the WO3−x QDs, time-independent SERS analysis with continuous light irradiation was carried out in order to observe the LSPR-enhanced catalytic activity. In practice, the SERS method can magnify the EM field on the surface of the WO3−x QD@Ag NW, thereby enhancing the optical signal. On the other hand, the LSPR-induced enhancement can be determined from the intensity of Raman spectra indirectly. Hence, we used SERS analysis to evaluate the photoelectric properties in WO3−x QD@Ag NW composites preliminarily. Changes in the stoichiometric ratio resulting from oxygen deficiencies can significantly impact the chemical and physical properties of WO3−x.37,38 The non-stoichiometric WO2.72 QDs are chosen as a model system for photoelectric investigations because they contain a large number of oxygen deficiencies in the lattice, and the WO3 QDs are selected as a comparison group. Herein, ten microlitres of methylene blue (MB) with a fixed concentration (1 × 10−6 M) was added dropwise onto the surface of the as-prepared WO3−x QD@Ag NWs on a bare SiO2/Si substrate and then measured at an excitation wavelength of 633 nm. Consequently, the WO3 QDs and WO2.72 QDs without Ag NW samples in our study did not exhibit SERS performance (Fig. S4†). However, as shown in Fig. 3, characteristic Raman peaks at 445, 1392, and 1623 cm−1 are observed, which are attributed to the C–N–C skeletal bending mode, the C–N symmetric vibration, and the C–C stretching vibration of MB, respectively.18,39 Neither an obvious peak shift nor a new peak was observed, indicating that no formation of a chemical bond occurred between the surface of the WO3 QD@Ag NW substrates and MB. As the WO3 QD content increases, an apparent attenuation of the Raman intensity is observed. The results reveal that WO3 QDs surrounding the Ag NWs block the generation of LSPR along the Ag NWs, resulting in a reduced SERS efficiency. Notably, the Raman scattering intensities of MB decreased after irradiating the surface of the substrates. Nevertheless, for the Ag NW substrate without WO3 QDs, the Raman scattering intensity of MB did not change significantly after irradiation. It seems that the presence of WO3 QDs in the composites, either surrounding the Ag NWs or on the surface of the Ag NWs, could bring about a significant enhancement of the photodecomposition of MB. As shown in Fig. 4, the same experiment was replicated using the WO2.72 QD@Ag NW composites as SERS substrates. Similarly, all the characteristic Raman peaks of MB decrease as the WO2.72 QD content increases. Conversely, an obvious enhancement of the Raman intensities is observed after irradiation, which is contrary to the results seen for the WO3 QD@Ag NW composites. Note that as a representative sample, 0.5 WO2.72 QDs + 2 AgNWs (0.5 mL WO2.72 QD dispersion + 2 mL AgNW dispersion) were screened. For this sample, the characteristic Raman peak at 1623 cm−1 increased in intensity three times after 10 minutes of irradiation and five times after 20 minutes compared to the non-irradiated spectrum.

Why are the irradiation-time-dependent SERS spectra of the WO3 QD@Ag NW composites significantly different from those of the WO2.72 QD@Ag NW composites? Previous research has shown that the presence of oxygen vacancies in the WO2.72 structure contributes to the greatly enhanced SERS sensitivity and catalytic activity.12,13,40 These studies suggest that the existence of rich oxygen vacancies in the WO2.72 QDs leaves unpaired electrons on the surface, which play a significant role in the radiative decay (SERS) and non-radiative decay (enhanced optical absorption) of the LSPR.
We further carried out calculations of the energy bandgap structure to determine the effects of the oxygen vacancies in WO3−x QDs. Previous research indicates that the bandgap (Eg) of WO3 nanocrystals increases when their size decreases to below that of the exciton Bohr radius, which is 3 nm for WO3.5,6,41 Meanwhile, an increase of oxygen defects in the metal oxide semiconductor can lead to variations in the optical bandgap.42,43 First, to verify the relationship between the bandgap and the oxygen defects in nonstoichiometric WO3−x samples, we recorded the UV-Vis absorption spectra of WO3−x QD samples (Fig. 5a). Because WO3 is an indirect bandgap semiconductor, the Eg values can be calculated from the intercept of their Tauc plots,44 which are the photon energy (hv) dependences of (αhv)1/2 as converted from the absorption spectra. The optical bandgap of stoichiometric WO3 QDs is 3.25 eV, which is larger than the reported bulk bandgap value for stoichiometric WO3 and approximates that of other reported WO3 QDs (2.93–3.69 eV).7,45 In sharp contrast, an increase of the bandgap to 3.50 eV is observed in the WO2.72 QDs, indicating the presence of oxygen vacancies. Broadening of the optical bandgap is observed in highly reduced substoichiometric WO3−x, which is attributed to the self-doping of W5+ and W4+, resulting in oxygen vacancies. This result is confirmed by the increased concentration of reduced W5+ found by XPS shown in Fig. 1d. Second, the energy band structures of the WO3−x QDs are determined by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) with a photon energy of 21.20 eV. As shown in Fig. 5b, the valence band (VB) spectra show that the valence band maxima (VBM) of theWO3 QDs and WO2.72 QDs are 3.15 eV and 3.63 eV below EF, respectively. The conduction band minima (CBM) are subsequently obtained by adding the value of Eg from VBM. A sample bias of −5 V was applied to observe the secondary electron cutoff (SEC). The work function (ϕ) can be determined from the difference between the photon energy and the binding energy of the secondary cutoff edge (Fig. 5d). Therefore, the Fermi level (Ef) of WO3 QDs and WO2.72 QDs can be determined to be −4.45 eV and −4.30 eV relative to the vacuum level (Evac), respectively. Based on these data given above, the energy band structures versus Evac of the WO2.72 QDs are illustrated in Fig. 5f, compared with those of the WO3 QDs. The WO2.72 QD structures exhibit a bandgap expansion with a slight shift of the CBM and VBM positions. Meanwhile, a sublevel centred at 0.98 eV versus Ef appears. According to previous reports, the defect level of WO3−x can be observed in the range of −0.5 to 2.5 eV and is attributed to the localized electrons in the d-orbitals of reduced W5+ or W4+ species with oxygen defects.35 As shown in Fig. 5e, the PL spectra exhibit three characteristic peaks for the WO2.72 QDs and only one peak for the WO3 QDs. The peak centred at 358 nm arises from the recombination of the electrons in the CB and holes in the VB, corresponding to 3.46 eV of energy, which closely approximates the determined Eg = 3.50 eV for WO2.72 QDs. The characteristic peaks located at 402 nm and 426 nm can be ascribed to the recombination of electrons in the defect band maximum and minimum with holes in the VB, respectively. However, the PL spectra for Ag NW dispersions with contents of 0, 66, 80, and 88 vol% (Fig. S5†) show that the PL intensity decreases with an increase in the Ag NW concentration, suggesting that increasing the amount of Ag NWs in the composite structures can decrease the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs.24 Similarly, the PL peak located at 380 nm for the WO3 QDs can be attributed to the recombination of the electrons and holes in the CBM and VBM, respectively. Notably, the electronic band structure of WO2.72 QDs has been confirmed by the measurements above. The presence of abundant oxygen vacancies could yield a large number of W5+ states with 5d electrons in the WO2.72 QDs; these W 5d electrons are delocalized at a high energy level and integrate with the CB level, leading to the Fermi level falling into an energy state above the CBM. Nevertheless, lacking excessive oxygen vacancies, the Fermi level of the WO3 QDs is located below the CBM as always. This observation is in agreement with previous reports.2 From the energy band structures in Fig. 5f, the energy level of the oxygen vacancy centres in WO2.72 QDs is 0.85 eV below the CBM, in agreement with that of previous reports (0.7–1.0 eV below the CBM).38

Upon recognizing the influence of oxygen defects on the energy band structure, the question naturally arises as to why the oxygen defects in substoichiometric WO2.72 QDs produce the opposite effect relative to that of the stoichiometric WO3 QDs during the irradiation-time-dependent SERS analysis. A study of the photocatalytic activity is a practical solution to investigate the photon–electron interactions in WO3−x QDs. To assess the photocatalytic activities of WO3−x QD@Ag NW composites, the samples were studied for their photodegradation of MB and thiram under simulated solar light illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). Fig. 6a shows the relative concentration (C/C0) change of MB under simulated light illumination with various combinations of WO3−x QDs and Ag NWs as the photocatalysts. The concentration changes of MB and thiram were detected by measuring the absorption at 665 nm and 300 nm of the suspension with five minute intervals. For the photodegradation of MB, the degradations are 25%, 40%, 48% and 80% in the presence of WO3 QDs, WO2.72 QDs, WO3 QD@Ag NW and WO2.72 QD@Ag NW under light illumination, respectively. In the case of the pesticide, thiram, the degradations are 67% and 95% in the presence of WO3 QD@Ag NW and WO2.72 QD@Ag NW, respectively, under light illumination (Fig. 6c). The photocatalytic efficiency towards the degradation of MB in aqueous solutions in the presence of the WO3−x QD@Ag NWs is relatively higher than that for thiram. This distinction might be due to the differences in the adsorptive performance of the WO3−x QD@Ag NW hybrid structures for the dye molecules and is also dependent upon the energy level positions of dyes relative to those of the WO3−x QDs and Ag NWs.23,46 The substoichiometric WO2.72 QDs exhibit superior photocatalytic performance than did the stoichiometric WO3 QDs, which is consistent with the trends of oxygen vacancy concentration. Thus, the surface oxygen vacancies in WO3−x QDs play a decisive role in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. In addition, the WO2.72 QD@Ag NW hybrid nanostructures possess a high capacity to generate electron–hole pairs for photodegradation, suggesting that WO3−x QDs that surround the Ag NWs lead to energetic PICT from the plasmonic metal to the semiconductor. The photodegradation activity of the catalyst towards MB and thiram was retained after five repeated trials, with no clear downward trend, demonstrating that the photocatalyst is relatively stable during the photodegradation reaction (Fig. 6b and d). This may be due to the uniform distribution of the WO2.72 QDs on the surface of the Ag NWs. Furthermore, additional photodegradation experiments indicate that the prepared WO3−x QD@Ag NW nanostructures can be easily separated from the aqueous solution and re-used after the photocatalytic reaction. Therefore, the prepared WO3−x QD@Ag NW nanostructures are advantageous in comparison to the WO3−x QD photocatalysts used in practice.

The results show that the order of ability of photodegradation is WO3 QDs < WO2.72 QDs < WO3 QD@Ag NW < WO2.72 QD@Ag NW. During the cycling runs of photodegradation, the catalyst does not exhibit any noticeable loss of activity, revealing the uniform and stable distribution of WO2.72 QDs on the surface of the Ag NWs. 

Fig. 7a shows the absorption spectra (280–850 nm) of WO3 QDs, WO2.72 QDs, WO3 QD@Ag NWs and WO2.72 QD@Ag NWs dispersed in ethyl alcohol. For WO3 QDs and WO2.72 QDs, the maximum absorption peaks appear below 280 nm. However, the main absorbances of the WO3−x QD@Ag NW hybrid structures are located at 400 nm and 360 nm, which is attributed to the transverse plasmon resonance of the Ag NWs and the quadrupole resonance excitation of the long-axis of the Ag NWs, respectively.47–49 Meanwhile, the global AM 1.5 solar irradiance spectrum has a high irradiance at 400 nm, and the WO3−x QD@Ag NW hybrid structures can utilize their significant absorption at this wavelength for this amount of power. These results demonstrate that the LSPR of the Ag NW structures leads to an increase in the absorbance in the visible region. To better evaluate the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of the as-prepared samples at different wavelengths, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) is measured at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl over incident light wavelengths ranging from 300 to 650 nm. In general, the wide bandgap (3.5 eV) of WO2.72 QDs means that these QDs generate a photocurrent only when irradiated by ultraviolet light. However, Fig. 7b shows that the WO3−x QD@Ag NWs have the highest IPCE profile of the various combinations of the as-prepared samples, which is in accordance with their corresponding absorption peaks in the visible region. This phenomenon is ascribed to the LSPR-induced closed-circuit current, including the processes of hot-electron generation, injection and regeneration. Fig. 7c reveals the ON/OFF photocurrent responses of WO3−x QDs and WO3−x QD@Ag NWs on an FTO substrate. Similarly, the order of the recorded photocurrent densities is consistent with the IPCE values.

Upon confirming the existence of oxygen defects in the WO2.72 QDs, and the synergistic effects of oxygen defects and LSPR in IPCE, we further performed electron–spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy to demonstrate the presence of unpaired electrons in the lattice. Thus, ESR spectroscopy can reveal the chemical environments of the unpaired electrons. As demonstrated in Fig. 7d–f, the ESR spectra of WO3 QDs, WO2.72 QDs and WO2.72 QD@Ag NWs exhibit a hyperfine structure with a symmetric signal located at approximately g = 2.003. Past studies have suggested that the presence of a signal at g = 2.003 can be ascribed to the free electron signal derived from oxygen vacancies in the WO3−x nanostructure.50–52 However, in this study, WO3 QDs are perfect crystals with no oxygen defects, and the symmetric signal still appears for this structure. This led us to suspect that a high number of surface dangling bonds may result from the preparation of WO3 QDs, resulting in the generation of unpaired electrons. Thus, these results reveal that the ESR signal at g = 2.003 is not fundamentally determined by the oxygen defect. However, the ESR spectra show that the order of the peak intensities is WO3 QDs < WO2.72 QDs < WO2.72 QD@Ag NW, which implies that more oxygen defects existing in the WO2.73 QDs do improve the concentrations of unpaired electrons. This, combined with the Feynman figure (Fig. S6†), can demonstrate that the SERS of the irradiated WO2.72 QDs derives from the high number of oxygen defects in the WO2.72 QDs.
To explain the somewhat puzzling dependences in Fig. 3 and 4, we should stress the difference between the WO3 QDs and the WO2.72 QDs. Fig. 8a and b show photographs of the WO3 QDs and the WO2.72 QDs dispersed in ethylene glycol before and after simulated solar light irradiation for ten minutes. There is no visible change in the irradiated WO3 QD dispersion, whereas a dramatic colour change from pale yellow to dark blue occurs in the irradiated WO2.72 QD dispersion. Moreover, we use the FDTD method to predict the local electric field distributions of WO2.72 QD@Ag NWs before and after light irradiation (Fig. S7†). Here, the optically irradiated WO2.72 QDs that are evenly distributed over the Ag NW network can not only generate more LSPR hot spots but also improve the homogeneity of the EM coupling. The absorption peaks are located at approximately 650 and 970 nm, which are attributed to the LSPR excitation of the irradiated WO2.72 QDs, see Fig. 7e. Therefore, we suggest that the WO2.72 QDs are translated into a “plasmonic state” after irradiation. The preceding discussion shows that two kinds of plasmonic decay mechanisms occur in plasmonic materials. These results demonstrate that both of the plasmonic decay mechanisms coincide in the WO2.72 QD structure, resulting in the LSPR-induced enhancement of photocatalysis and the SERS generated at the WO2.72 QD@Ag NW interface. The changes in the optical constant results have provided persuasive evidence that the LSPR excitation is responsible for SERS at the irradiated WO2.72 QD@Ag NW interface (Fig. S8 and S9†).

The color changes are because of photochromism or light-controlled LSPR response of WO2.72 QDs, which is a characteristic of tungsten oxides. The most important and interesting point is this color change behavior is reversible and has almost no negative effects on the photocatalytic properties. As shown in Fig. 9, after solar-light irradiation for 10–20 seconds, the canary yellow suspension turned blue, and a reversible process was seen when the blue suspension was kept in the dark for 2 hours. To further investigate the photostability of WO2.72 QDs in the reversible process, XPS was used to characterize the sample. The W5+/W6+ ratios in the sample present a significant difference between light and dark treatment (see in Fig. 9a and b). As compared with WO2.72 QDs in an initial state, the irradiated WO2.72 QD sample exhibits a high W5+/W6+ ratio. Additionally, after dark treatment for 2 hours, the W5+/W6+ ratio in WO2.72 QDs returns to its initial state (see in Fig. 9c). Meanwhile, Raman spectra and photocatalysis results in this study suggest that the irradiated WO2.72 QDs are an active component in the WO3−x QD@Ag NW structure, and the irradiated WO2.72 QD sample has a suitable photostability during photocatalysis or Raman tests.

The corresponding photographs of (a1) WO2.72 QDs before light irradiation, (b1) WO2.72 QDs after light irradiation, (c1) irradiated WO2.72 QDs after dark treatment for 2 hours. 
Here, the small polaron hopping model helps us to explain this phenomenon. The plots of the resistance (R) dependence on the temperature (T) for the WO2.72 QDs and the irradiated WO2.72 QDs are shown in Fig. 8f, and the R–T relation of the as-prepared samples obeys the small polaron hopping model given by the following equation:53,54 R = CTexp(Ea/kBT)(1)where T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, kB is the Boltzmann constant and Ea can be described as the activation energy for electron transport between W5+ and W6+. According to Fig. 8g, Ea is calculated by: Ea = (1/R) (dR/dT)(2)
Hence, the values of Ea are 0.041 eV and 0.037 eV for WO2.72 QDs and irradiated WO2.72 QDs, respectively, which indicates that light irradiation of the WO2.72 QDs benefits the electron hopping between the W5+ and W6+ sites (Fig. 8h), thereby increasing the conductivity of WO2.72 and generating “hot spots” in the as-prepared SERS substrate (Fig. 8i). Meanwhile, the small polaron hopping model suggests that the activation energy, Ea, decreases with increasing optical absorption,55,56 which is reasonable given that the corresponding optical absorption bands appear in irradiated WO2.72 QDs, thereby generating LSPR.
3. Conclusions
We have demonstrated WO3−x QD@Ag NW composite structures as functional materials that are characterized by their controlled transitions between the “photocatalytic state” and the “SERS state”. The composite structures feature high photocatalytic activity, SERS performance and acceptable stability. In addition, this study has experimentally demonstrated the two decay mechanisms of LSPR in WO3−x QDs. After simulated solar light illumination, the substoichiometric WO2.72 QDs were translated from a semiconductor state to a “plasmonic state”. The radiative decay rates are much stronger than the nonradiative decay rates in the WO2.72 QD@Ag NWs. Hence, SERS predominates during irradiation-time-dependent SERS measurements. In contrast, photocatalysis is dominant in the stoichiometric WO3 QD@Ag NWs. These results provide convincing evidence that oxygen deficiencies play a critical role in the decay of LSPR. The presented explanations will guide the design of highly efficient photocatalytic and SERS devices composed of transition metal oxide/plasmonic metal composites.
4. Experimental details
Synthesis of WO3−x QD@Ag NW composites
The preparation of Ag NWs was based on a polyalcohol reduction method according to our published work.18 AgNWs were prepared by a polyalcohol reduction method in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a surfactant. 0.16 g of PVP (MW ∼ 130000) and 0.16 g of PVP (MW ∼ 58000) were mixed and dissolved in 44 mL of EG to form a colorless and transparent solution. Then 5 mL of FeCl3 solution (600 μM in EG) and 6 mL of AgNO3 solution (0.35 M in EG) were added rapidly to the above solution within two minutes. Subsequently, the mixed solution was transferred into a flask and heated at 140 °C for 2 hours. After the reaction was finished, the precipitate was naturally cooled to room temperature. The obtained solution was centrifuged and washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water three times and redispersed in 50 mL ethanol. A final AgNW-alcohol dispersion was obtained. In a typical synthesis of WO3−x QDs, glycerol was heated at 130 °C for 30 minutes to remove water. Then, 0.5 g WCl6 was dissolved in 50 mL of glycerol to form a colorless and transparent solution. Subsequently, 1 wt% of deionized water (0.5 mL) was added to the above solution. In a control group, the colorless and transparent solution was used without adding water. The resulting solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor with a volume of 100 mL and heated at 180 °C for 4 hours. The solvothermal product was obtained after cooling down the reaction system to room temperature. The solvothermal product was then transferred into a dialysis membrane (Spectra/POR6, MWCO = 3500). This was rinsed with deionized water to remove the remaining organics and rinsed with ethanol to remove water from the membrane, respectively. Finally, the WO3−x QDs were prepared by dispersing the product into 50 mL of absolute ethanol for further use.
For the preparation of WO3−x QD@Ag NW composites, the specified amount (0.05–0.5 mL) of WO3−x QD dispersion (5 mg mL−1 in absolute ethanol) was added to 2 mL of the as-prepared Ag NW dispersion (8 mg mL−1 in absolute ethanol), and the mixed dispersion was vibrated using a Thermo Forma orbital shaker at 75 °C for 2 hours. A final WO3−x QD @Ag NW dispersion was obtained.
Characterization
The crystal structures of the WO3−x QDs samples were determined by using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. The absorption spectra were collected using a Hitachi UH-4150 spectrophotometer. In Fig. 7a, the absorption spectra were collected by adding 50 μL WO3−x QDs or WO3−x QD@Ag NW suspension into ethanol. In Fig. 8e, WO2.72 QDs and irradiated WO2.72 QD suspension were spay-painted on optics quartz glass, and then their absorption spectra were recorded. The FESEM images were characterized by using a Hitachi S4800 microscope. The HRTEM, HAADF-STEM, and EDS mapping images were characterized using an FEI Tecnai G2 F20. The XPS data were obtained with a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI. The UPS data were obtained with a monochromatic He I light source (21.2 eV) and a VG Scienta R4000 analyzer. The optical constants (the refractive index n and the extinction coefficient k) of WO3−x QDs and irradiated WO3−x QDs were determined by using a SE850 spectroscopic ellipsometer. The incident angle of the light source was 70°, and the incident light wavelength region was 320–850 nm for measurement. The resistance–temperature data of samples were collected in the temperature range of 293–373 K using a HiSOL HSP-100 semiconductor automatic probe station with a temperature control system.
FDTD simulation
A 3-D finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method was used to simulate local electric field distributions in WO3−x QD@Ag NW structures. This simulation was performed using commercial FDTD simulation software (Lumerical Solutions, Inc.). In this work, the simulation unit cell was set as a 0.25 nm × 0.25 nm rectangular grid. The periodic boundary condition was applied to the x-axis and y-axis, and a perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary condition was applied to the z-axis. A plane wave source (633 nm wavelength) with a wave vector ky and a polarization Ex was incident on the WO3−x QD@Ag NW structures. Dielectric dispersion of Ag and WO2.72 was performed using plasma and a Drude approximation of experimental dependencies from the literature.39,57
Irradiation-time-dependent Raman measurements
Raman spectra were collected using a Reflex Confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy system (inVia, Renishaw, UK) equipped with a 50 objective. Laser wavelengths of 633 nm (0.17 mW on the sample) were applied as the excitation source in various Raman spectra. All Raman spectra were recorded with an acquisition time of 10 s by integrating three times. The relative humidity of air was maintained at 75% (±5%) across all Raman spectra collection. The as-prepared Raman substrates were irradiated using a 300 W Xe lamp, and the light intensity was 100 mW cm−2.
Photocatalytic activity test
The photocatalytic degradation experiments were performed in 100 mL quartz beaker with an aqueous suspension of MB and thiram (60 mL, 20 mg L−1) containing 100 mg photocatalyst (WO3−x). The light source was a 300 W Xe lamp, and the light intensity was kept as 100 mW cm−2. The system was illuminated after stirring in the dark for 45 min to reach an equilibrium of complete adsorption–desorption. In the cycling runs of photodegradation, the photocatalysts were filtered and washed with deionized water before being redispersed in the MB or thiram solution for further cycles. The system was illuminated after stirring in the dark for 1.5 h to ensure that the irradiated WO2.72 QDs have enough time to revert to the initial state. The concentration of MB and thiram during degradation was monitored by the absorbance study using a Hitachi UH-4150 spectrophotometer. For the study of MB photodegradation, the maximum UV–vis absorption peak at 665 nm was selected for concentration monitoring. Similarly, for thiram, the absorption peak at 300 nm was chosen.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The I–t curves of the as-prepared samples were performed by using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation with a typical three-electrode cell. WO3−x QDs, Ag NWs and WO3−x QDs@Ag NWs were coated onto the bare FTO substrates as photoanodes. The working electrode area is 2 cm2 (1.42 cm × 1.42 cm). The Ag/AgCl and Pt sheet were used as the reference and counter electrodes, under simulated sunlight with a 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5 global filter (Newport 81094). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded by using a solar simulator (Newport 66984) coupled with a filter (Newport 71260) and an aligned monochromator (Newport 1-800-222-6440).

 	Scheme 1  (a) LSPR occurs on the surface of the WO3−x QD@Ag NW structure. (b) LSPR can decay via non-radiative Landau damping, resulting in the excitation of hot electrons and holes. Hot electrons with high energies can overcome the Schottky barrier, φSB = φM − χs, thereby being injected into the conduction band of an adjacent WO3−x QD, where φM is the work function of the Ag NWs and χs is the electron affinity of the WO3−x QDs. (c) LSPR can decay radiatively via the re-emission of photons, thereby inducing SERS. Irradiation-time-dependent Raman measurements can observe the synergistic effects of LSPR-induced enhancement of photocatalysis and SERS. (d) The formation mechanism of the as-prepared WO3 QDs (Sample 1) and WO3−x QDs (Sample 2). In a typical preparation process, the anhydrous environment plays a significant role in determining the amount of oxygen defects in WO3−x QDs, which lead to the formation of hexagonal channels. (e) The XRD patterns of WO3 QDs and WO3−x QDs, the result confirmed the formation of monoclinic WO3 QDs and WO2.72 QDs. The obvious broadening of diffraction peaks is attributed to ultrasmall crystalline sizes for WO3 QDs and WO2.72 QDs.

 	Fig. 2  HAADF-STEM images of the (a) WO3 QD@Ag NW structure and (b) WO2.72 QD@Ag NW structure. (a1–a3) The corresponding EDS mapping images of the WO3 QD@Ag NW structure and (b1–b3) WO2.72 QD@Ag NW structure. In the EDS maps, the blue colour represents Ag, red colour represents W and green colour represents O. TEM images of the (c) WO3 QD@Ag NW structure and (d) WO2.72 QD@Ag NW structure. (e, f) Red rectangular areas represent the locations of the corresponding HRTEM images. The lattice distances are measured to be 0.36 nm, 0.37 nm, 0.38 nm, 0.21 nm, 0.24 nm, agreeing well with the WO3 (200), (020), (002) or WO2.72 (010), Ag (200), (111) lattice spacings, respectively.

 	Fig. 6  The temporal course of photodegradation of (a) MB and (c) thiram. Cycling runs in the photodegradation of (b) MB and (d) thiram. The results show that the order of ability of photodegradation is WO3 QDs < WO2.72 QDs < WO3 QD@Ag NW < WO2.72 QD@Ag NW. During the cycling runs of photodegradation, the catalyst does not exhibit any noticeable loss of activity, revealing the uniform and stable distribution of WO2.72 QDs on the surface of the Ag NWs.
