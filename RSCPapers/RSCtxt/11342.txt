    , Accepted 16th May 2019First published on 17th May 2019AbstractThe intramolecular S–O interaction was first adopted for designing conjugated polymer HTMs in perovskites solar cells. It could lock the flat conformation of polymer backbones, which enabled the polymer molecules to pack closely in the solid state, facilitating hole transportation. The solubility of the conjugated polymers could be improved by introducing alkyloxy side chains, whereas their planarity in the solid state was not affected. Furthermore, high hole mobility of 1.72 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a suitable HOMO energy level of −5.43 eV could be achieved by side chain engineering. Finally, PCE of 18.30% was obtained for P1-based dopant-free devices, which most importantly showed much better long-term ambient stability than those based on traditional spiro-MeOTAD.
Since 2009, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been studied intensively along with the boosted power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from initial 3.8% to certified 23%.1–7 Planar heterojunction PSCs are relatively easy to fabricate and can be implemented in either conventional (n–i–p) or inverted (p–i–n) structures. Most high-performance PSCs adopt the typical conventional architecture, which consists of layered perovskite and a hole-transporting layer (HTL) on the top; both are sandwiched between the electrodes. HTL apparently works as a barrier to prevent electrons and moisture from travelling between the underlying perovskite layer and the metal electrode. Significantly it takes effects in the processes of hole extraction from perovskite and transportation to electrode, which both can be greatly facilitated by optimizing hole-transporting materials (HTMs). In general, a potential HTM candidate should essentially possess reasonably high hole mobility and a suitable energy level. So far, the most widely used HTM is 2,2′,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), which has enabled state-of-the-art PSCs with PCEs over 22%.7,8 However, these high PCE values were only achieved by its combination with the integrated additives of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP). These dopants readily induce the degradation of organic HTL as well as the perovskite film, declining the long-term stability of PCEs. This also occurs in the presence of other common additives such as cobalt complexes or 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquino-dimethane (F4-TCNQ).9–11 Such stability issues can be avoided by using dopant-free HTMs, especially conjugated polymers. Compared to small-molecular organic HTMs, conjugated polymers usually exhibit much better film-forming ability, which can avoid the formation of pinholes. Additionally, the chemical structure and the energy level of conjugated polymers can be precisely tailored. A large number of polymeric HTMs have been used in PSCs; however, only very few of them possess both suitable HOMO levels and high hole mobility.12–15
In our previous work, we demonstrated that the introduction of intramolecular non-covalent S–O interactions can endow the molecules with flat conformation and better conjugation.16,17 Herein, we demonstrated a novel strategy for designing ladder-like conjugated polymers and we used them as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs. Benzodithiophene and bis(alkyloxy)benzene were selected as the building blocks to construct these polymers. Intramolecular S–O interactions were adopted to lock the flat conformation of polymer backbones to form ladder-like structures.18–23 Therefore, the introduction of alkyloxy side chains on the phenylene repeat units could enhance the solubility of conjugated polymers without affecting their planarity in the solid state. Such ladder-like polymers should have high hole mobility since they can closely pack in the solid state due to their locked planar conformation. As expected, P2 comprising 4,8-bis(alkyloxy)benzodithiophene and 2,5-bis(alkyloxy)phenylene demonstrated hole mobility of 3.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 but with a much deeper HOMO level. The introduction of two alkylthienyl side chains on the benzodithiophene unit could simultaneously tune the HOMO energy level and hole mobility. Considerably high hole mobility of 1.72 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an appropriate HOMO level of −5.43 eV were achieved for P1. When the mixed-perovskite (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 was used as the active layer, PCE of 18.30% was achieved for P1-based dopant-free devices. Most importantly, the devices based on these new HTMs showed much better long-term ambient stability than those based on traditional spiro-OMeTAD.
The chemical structures and the proposed supramolecular assemblies of P1, P2, and P3 are outlined in Chart 1. Their synthetic routes are shown in Scheme S1.† Detailed synthesis and purification procedures as well as characterizations are provided in ESI.† As shown in Chart 1, the intramolecular S–O interaction can force the polymer backbone to adopt planar conformation, which favours the close packing of polymer chains in the solid state. These polymers show good solution processability. P1 and P2 are soluble in nonpolar solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at room temperature, whereas P3 can be dissolved in the above-mentioned solvents at a slightly elevated temperature. They also exhibit good thermal stability, as indicated by the curves of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) shown in Fig. S1.† Their thermal decomposition temperatures (Tdec) were all above 300 °C; their glass transition temperatures (Tg) were in the range from 171 to 177 °C, which were much higher than 124 °C for spiro-OMeTAD, as listed in Table 1.

The UV-vis absorption properties of P1, P2, and P3 were investigated both in chlorobenzene solution and as a thin film; their spectra are shown in Fig. 1. In the chlorobenzene solution at room temperature, P1 displayed broad absorption in the range from 350 to 570 nm with the main peak located at 549 nm and one shoulder at 504 nm. P2 showed slightly narrower absorption with the main absorption peak at 525 nm; P3 showed slightly redshifted absorption with two absorption peaks at 484 and 550 nm. After heating the chlorobenzene solution to an elevated temperature, all polymers displayed narrower and blue-shifted spectra, indicating that the aggregated polymer chains in the chlorobenzene solution can be dissociated at an elevated temperature. In comparison with their solution absorption spectra at room temperature, broader and redshifted absorptions were displayed by all polymers due to the aggregation of polymer chains in the solid state. The optical bandgaps were calculated by the equation Eg,opt = 1240/λonset, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1.

The electrochemical behaviours of P1, P2, and P3 were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the curves are shown in Fig. S2.† The onsets of oxidation and reduction potentials were determined with Fc/Fc+ as the internal standard. According to the equations EHOMO = −e[Eox + 4.80 − E(Fc/Fc+)] and ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg, both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels could be determined. As exhibited in Table 1, P1 possesses a moderate HOMO level of −5.43 eV, P2 exhibits a much deeper HOMO level of −5.76 eV, and P3 shows a slightly lifted HOMO level of −5.30 eV. The above results indicate that we can readily adjust the energy levels of polymers by tuning their chemical structures.
To study the photovoltaic performance of these polymers as HTMs, we fabricated PSCs with the configuration of FTO/c-TiO2 (130 nm)/PCBA/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15(230 nm)/HTM/Au (Fig. 1d), where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide, and PCBA is [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid.24,25 Control devices were also prepared with commercial spiro-OMeTAD. Except PCBA, each functional layer was distinguishable from the other, as indicated by the scanning electron microscopy images (Fig.S3 and S4†). The detailed fabrication process can be referred to the Experimental section in ESI† together with the optimization of a range of conditions such as the concentrations of HTMs, solvents, spin-coating rates, and annealing temperatures. All the devices mentioned in the context were optimized. An energy level diagram of PSCs is depicted in Fig. 2a. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs with P1, P2, and P3 as the HTLs are shown in Fig. 2b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. In comparison with P2 and P3, P1 possessed a more suitable HOMO energy level of −5.43 eV, matching well with that of −5.48 eV of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15. Such a slightly higher HOMO energy level is quite beneficial for hole injection and transfer from perovskite to HTL. As a result, a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.06 eV was achieved for devices with P1 as the HTL. Comparatively, P1-based devices afforded slightly higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.39 mA cm−2 compared to the devices with other HTLs including spiro-OMeTAD. A typical hysteresis phenomenon is also observed in the J–V curves, which commonly occurs in the J–V curves of other planar perovskite solar cells.26–28 Hence, Jsc was further verified by integrating the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves, as shown in Fig. 2c. More importantly, P1-based devices exhibited decided advantages in terms of the fill factor (FF, 75.0%) over others (42.9% and 63.3%), resulting in the best PCE of 18.30% among those of the devices with these polymeric HTMs. Steady-state output PCEs at a given constant bias related to the maximal power point are displayed in Fig. 2d. It indicates that the devices with these polymeric HTMs can maintain constant current density over 200 s. For the heavily doped spiro-OMeTAD devices, the best PCE of 19.35% was achieved, which was on par with those reported previously.29,30 However, it is indispensable to add Li-TFSI and TBP as dopants in order to increase the conductivity and hole mobility of spiro-MeOTAD, which can result in the instability of devices because of the deliquescent and hygroscopic nature of these additives.31,32 It is worth noting that PCE of 18.30% was obtained without any dopants and consequently, the devices should possess superior long-term ambient stability to spiro-OMeTAD-based devices (vide infra).

To elucidate improved Jsc, we measured the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the perovskite films with and without HTMs. As shown in Fig. 3a, all the emissions of the perovskite films are significantly quenched by HTMs, especially by P1 and spiro-OMeTAD, indicating that P1 and spiro-OMeTAD possess strong capability to extract holes from the perovskite layer. This can also be further verified by the TRPL spectra shown in Fig. 3b. The exciton lifetime for the perovskite films with different HTMs was determined by fitting the curves using an exponential diffusion model. The fast decay time constant (τ1) was 3.29 ns for P1 and 2.83 ns for spiro-OMeTAD, as summarized in Table S1,† which indicated that P1 can extract holes more efficiently than other HTMs.

To explain the inspiring FF, we utilized the space charge limitation of current (SCLC) method to determine the hole-transporting ability of these HTMs. Devices were constructed in the hole-only structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/HTM/Au and the measured curves were fitted by the Mott–Gurney law (Fig. 3c). As depicted in Table 1, the hole mobilities of P2 and P3 are calculated to be 3.78 × 10−4 and 2.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are comparable to the hole mobility values of dopant-free polymeric HTMs used in state-of-the-art PSCs.16,33 For P1, the hole mobility was as high as 1.72 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which has seldom been reported for dopant-free PSCs. Such high hole mobility for P1 was probably due to the following reasons: the intramolecular S–O interaction can lock the flat conformation of the polymer backbone; planar polymers can pack closely in the solid state; and the alkylthienyl conjugated side chains can enhance the hole-transporting ability of polymer films. Thus, the high hole mobility accounts for enhanced FF in the P1-based PSCs.
Hydrophobic polymeric HTLs can act as an effective moisture barrier for protecting perovskite films from direct contact with moisture.34 To investigate the moisture resistance of these polymeric HTMs, we measured the water droplet contact angles (α) of different HTL surfaces (Fig. S5†). For all these polymeric HTMs (P1, P2, and P3), the contact angles were measured to be over 96°, demonstrating that these polymeric HTMs are more hydrophobic than spiro-OMeTAD. As a result, the fabricated devices exhibited greater stability at 20 °C and 80% humidity than spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. As shown in Fig. 3d, the efficiency of spiro-OMeTAD-based devices degrades rapidly and only 51.3% of the initial efficiency remains after 96 h, whereas all the devices based on polymeric HTMs still maintain the efficiency over 89%.
Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized a series of planar conjugated polymers P1, P2, and P3, which mainly consisted of benzodithiophene and/or bis(alkyloxy)benzene units. Ladder-like structures could be formed by intramolecular S–O interactions, which enhanced the planarity of polymer backbones. P1 with planar polymer backbones and alkylthienyl conjugated side chains demonstrated the highest hole mobility of 1.72 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 among these three polymers. Additionally, P1 also possessed an appropriate HOMO energy level of −5.43 eV, which matched well with the perovskite layer. Finally, PCE of 18.30% was achieved for P1-based devices with Voc of 1.06 eV, Jsc of 22.39 mA cm−2, and FF of 75.0%. Compared to spiro-OMeTAD, the devices with these dopant-free HTMs exhibited improved long-term ambient stability due to stronger hydrophobicity.
