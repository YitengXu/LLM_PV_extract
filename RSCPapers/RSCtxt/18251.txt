    , Accepted 12th May 2015First published on 13th May 2015AbstractA novel series of heteroatom-substituted naphthodithiophene and dithienylbenzothiadiazole alternating copolymers namely PNTP, PNBO, PNfTB, and PNffTB were designed and synthesized in which heteroatoms including fluorine, oxygen or nitrogen were incorporated into electron-deficient benzothiadiazole units of the resulting copolymers. In general, with the incorporation of heteroatoms into the acceptor units of the polymer backbone, the absorption spectra would shift to a longer wavelength, indicating a decrease in the optical band gap. In addition, fluorine substitution can effectively lower both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the resulting copolymers; on the other hand, the incorporation of nitrogen or oxygen atoms into the copolymer backbone can only stabilize the LUMO energy level of copolymers. The effect of heteroatoms on the photovoltaic and charge mobility properties of organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) was also investigated. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs fabricated from the blend of heteroatom-substituted copolymers and PC71BM using diiodooctane as a solvent additive with ZnO/Al as a double interlayer in an inverted device structure afforded a power conversion efficiency up to 5.05%. In addition, the solution-processed bottom gate bottom contact based OFETs fabricated from PNfTB exhibited an enhanced hole mobility of 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off current ratio of 107. Our results suggested that incorporation of heteroatoms into the donor–acceptor polymer backbone would be a useful strategy to enhance the functional properties for applications in OSCs and OFETs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on organic/polymers have attracted much attention from both academia and industry in the past few decades due to their advantages of low-cost, flexibility, lightweight, as well as a large area device fabricated through solution processes at low cost.1 With the successful development of new low band-gap copolymers,2 the effective device fabrication technologies such as addition of additives,3 thermal annealing,4 and solvent annealing,5 as well as the optimized device structure such as the incorporation of an interlayer,6 the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on p-type copolymers and n-type fullerene derivatives have recently reached up to 10–11% for single and tandem OSCs.7 Meanwhile, factors including weak sunlight harvesting efficiency8 and low charge carrier mobility of organic semiconductors9 still limit the further efficiency enhancement of OSCs. Therefore, the development of new p-type semiconducting materials to achieve a higher PCE of a solar cell still remains a great challenge for the scientific community.
The donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating copolymer approach has proven to be a successful strategy to develop and tune semiconducting polymers with the desirable molecular and functional properties including the optical energy band-gap, energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels (LUMO), and the charge transporting properties by means of properly controlling the intramolecular charge transfer from the donor (electron-rich) unit to the acceptor (electron-deficient) unit in a copolymer.10 It is also well known that the alkyl side chains attached onto the conjugated backbone of the D–A polymer not only facilitate the solubility and solution-processability but also assist to adjust inter- and intramolecular interactions of the polymer, which would have a tremendous effect on the morphology of the active thin film in the devices, thus directly affecting the ultimate charge transport properties and solar power conversion efficiency of the resulting polymer.11 Furthermore, the incorporation of heteroatom(s) onto the conjugated polymer backbone could be an alternative means or tool to further improve and tune the optical and electronic and physical properties of a potential D–A polymer as well as to adjust the morphological properties of the active layer for efficient OSCs.12 It has been shown that the incorporation of an electronegative atom into the acceptor moiety would lower the low-lying HOMO energy level of the resulting D–A polymer, which would benefit better air stability and larger open-circuit voltage (Voc) for OSC applications.1b,2a,13
Because of the strong electron-withdrawing strength of the fluorine atom, the use of fluorinated benzothiadiazole as an acceptor unit enables the reduction of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the resulting D–A polymer as compared to the one with unsubstituted benzothiadiazole, thereby improving the OSC performance.7d,14 In addition, as pyridine is more π-electron deficient than the benzene ring, the replacement of benzene with the pyridine ring in the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole moiety would give rise to a stronger acceptor unit, with which the derived polymer has shown to exhibit a lowering of the frontier molecular orbitals and a red shift in the absorption spectrum.2a,15 Substitution of sulfur atoms with electronegative oxygen atoms in the benzothiadiazole units of the copolymer has also been employed as a useful tool to lower the HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the optical energy gap of the polymer.15
We have previously shown that low bandgap 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and 4,7-bis(3-(2-ethylhexylthiophen)-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, PNB-C2,6 alternating copolymers showed a strong and broad absorption and promising photovoltaic performance in OSCs.11a,16 According to the theoretical calculations carried out by Gaussian 09 using Density Functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP and 6-31G basis set, the heteroatom-substituted dithienylbenzothiadiazoles including dithienylthiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine, dithienylbenzooxadiazole, and dithienylfluoro-benzothiadiazole exhibit different extents of stabilization of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels relative to the unsubstituted counterparts (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). This would be useful as a strong acceptor moiety to further enhance the functional properties of the resulting naphthodithiophene-based copolymers for optoelectronic applications. To further explore and investigate the functional properties, and optimize the device performance of the PNB-based copolymers, a novel series of PNB-based copolymers incorporated with different heteroatom(s) including fluorine, nitrogen or oxygen atoms onto the benzothiadiazole acceptor unit of the polymer backbone were designed and synthesized. The molecular structures of these copolymers including PNTP, PNBO, PNfTB, and PNffTB are shown in Fig. 1.

The synthetic routes to the key electron-deficient heteroatom substituted dithienylbenzothiadiazole moieties, compounds 9a–d, and the electron-rich unit, 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,9-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)naphthodithiophene, 14, are outlined in Scheme 1. All the intermediates were synthesized according to the literature protocols under the optimized reaction conditions.14a,15,16 The detailed procedures are given in the ESI.† The alternating copolymers namely PNTP, PNBO, PNfTB, and PNffTB were synthesized by the Stille polycondensation reaction of 5,6-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-2,9-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)naphthodithiophene, 14 with the corresponding dibromide, 9a–d using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in DMF at 120 °C for 48 h under N2 (Scheme 1). All the copolymers showed relatively good solubility in chloroform, THF and chlorobenzene except for PNffTB.

To a 50 mL round-bottom flask containing 4,7-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (68 mg, 0.1 mmol) and 5,6-bis(2′-ethylhexyl-oxy)-2,5-bis(tri-n-butylstannyl)naphtha[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene (108 mg, 0.10 mmol) was added Pd(PPh3)4 (10 mg). After three successive deoxygenation–refilling with N2 cycles, DMF (30 mL) was added via a syringe. The polymerization was carried out at 120 °C for 48 h under N2. The polymer was precipitated in MeOH and collected by filtration. Low-molecular-weight oligomers were removed by Soxhlet extraction with MeOH, hexane and DCM, respectively. The remaining high molecular-weight solid was extracted with chloroform. The desired polymer was precipitated from methanol, collected and dried under vacuum for 12 h affording the product as a black solid (73 mg, 72%), Mn (53 kDa), PDI (2.01).

Results and discussion
Physical and thermal stability properties
The number average molecular weights (Mns) of the copolymers were 53, 71, 6 and 46 kDa for PNTP, PNBO, PNfTB and PNffTB with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.01, 2.49, 1.60 and 2.07, respectively. This was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent. Due to the poor solubility of PNfTB, only the low-molecular-weight copolymer could be isolated. All the copolymers exhibited very high thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures (Td) in the range of 359–404 °C as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Furthermore, the glass transition state was not found in this series of the copolymers as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The physical and thermal stability data of the copolymers are summarized in Table 1.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of heteroatom substituted PNB-based copolymers and the parent polymer recorded in THF and thin films are shown in Fig. 2. Similar to the unsubstituted polymer, PNB-C2,6, heteroatom substituted PNB-based copolymers exhibit two major absorption bands. The weak absorption at around 425 nm corresponds to the π–π* transitions, which is typically found in the dithienylbenzothiadiazole-based polymers.17 The strong, broad, and overlapped absorption that peaked from 592 to 680 nm is assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer between electron-rich and electron-deficient units. The heteroatom substituted PNB-based copolymers generally exhibited a red shift in the absorption spectra relative to the unsubstituted counterparts except for PNfTB, which could be due to the relatively low molecular weight of the polymer.18 Because of the intermolecular interaction in the solid state, there was also a red shift in the absorption spectra in thin films as compared to that in THF. The absorption edges of these copolymer films were at 715, 723, 756, and 784 nm corresponding to the optical bandgaps of 1.73, 1.71, 1.64, and 1.58 for PNfTB, PNffTB, PNBO and PNTP, respectively.

To investigate the redox potentials of these newly synthesized copolymers, cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed in dry CH3CN (with 0.1 M (n-Bu)4NPF6) using Ag/AgNO3 as a reference electrode. All the copolymers showed one irreversible oxidation and one irreversible reduction wave. The HOMO energy levels were calculated from the onset oxidation potentials with ferrocene as an external standard, and the LUMO energy levels were determined from the measured HOMO energy level and the optical band-gap energy. The electrochemical data of the heteroatom substituted PNB-based copolymers are shown in Table 2. It is important to find that fluorine substitution on the benzothiazole units can effectively lower both HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the resulting copolymers (≥−0.12 eV) relative to that of the unsubstituted one, PNB-C2,6; on the other hand, the incorporation of nitrogen and oxygen atoms into the copolymer backbone can only stabilize the LUMO energy level of the resulting copolymer significantly (−0.12 eV–−0.16 eV) in spite of the decrease in the optical bandgap. Thus, fluorine substitution is anticipated to be beneficial to achieve a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs as the Voc is correlated with the difference between the LUMO energy level of the acceptor and the HOMO energy level of the polymer.

Photovoltaic properties
BHJ OSCs were fabricated using the newly synthesized heteroatom substituted PNB-based copolymers as a donor material and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor material with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/Al (1.2 nm)/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag and an active cell area of 9 mm2. The active layer of devices was spin-coated from 6 mg mL−1 solutions of copolymers with 3% DIO as an additive and PC71BM in chlorobenzene at 110 °C. The device performance measured under AM 1.5 simulated solar illumination at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 is greatly influenced by the device structure parameters such as the use of ZnO/Al as a double interlayer and the blend ratio of polymer to PC71BM (D/A ratio) in the active layer. It is important to note that by changing the blend ratio of polymer to PC71BM from 1:2 to 1:1, there is a significant improvement in the photovoltaic performance of devices fabricated from PNTP and PNfTB in which the fill factors (FF), short circuit current densities (Jsc) and Voc of the PNTP- and PNfTB-based devices increase substantially resulting in a large enhancement of PCE from 3.84% and 2.80% to 4.40% and 3.60%, respectively. On the other hand, PNBO- and PNffTB-based devices show superior device performance with PCE up to 4.05% and 2.68%, respectively when the D/A blend ratio is kept at 1:2. A summary of their photovoltaic properties with different weight ratios is shown in Table 3.

To further enhance the device efficiency, an aluminium interlayer (1.2 nm) was added between ZnO and the active layer in order to remove the unfavourable interfacial exciton dissociation.6Fig. 3a and c show the J–V characteristics of heteroatom substituted copolymer based OSC devices fabricated without and with the Al interlayer. Table 4 summarizes the photovoltaic performance of devices fabricated from the newly synthesized copolymers under the optimized conditions. It is worth mentioning that an addition of an Al interlayer between ZnO and the active layer would effectively enhance the photovoltaic performance of the OSC device, in particular the Jsc value. For PNTP-based devices, the enhancement of the Jsc value from 11.56 to 12.30 mA−1 cm−2 upon Al interlayer insertion leads to an increase in PCE from 4.58 to 5.05%, despite a modest improvement in the FF and Voc values. Similarly, the PNfTB-based device shows a substantial enhancement of Jsc from 11.12 to 12.15 mA−1 cm−2 and hence photovoltaic performance in the presence of an Al interlayer affording a PCE up to 4.76%. For PNBO- and PNffTB-based OSCs, the Al interlayer is also effective in enhancing the device efficiency with which all the photovoltaic properties including Jsc, FF and Voc values are improved to different extents resulting in an increase in the PCE. It is important to note that among the OSCs fabricated from these heteroatom substituted PNB-based copolymers, the PNfTB-based device affords the largest Voc value of 0.76 V, which is attributed to the lowest HOMO energy level induced by the fluorine substitution onto the acceptor units of benzothiadiazole, highlighting the advantage of the fluorine incorporation. These devices also exhibit a broad and strong photoresponse in the spectral range of 350 nm to 750 nm for PNfTB- and PNBO-based devices and of 350 nm to 800 nm for the PNTP-based device (Fig. 3b and d) which correlate well with the corresponding absorption spectrum.

Field-effect transistor mobility
The field-effect transistor properties of these copolymers were investigated by a bottom-gate bottom-contact configuration (BGBC). The gold (Au) source–drain electrodes were prepared by a photolithography technique to control the channel length (L = 3, 8, 18, 28, 38 and 48 μm, adjusted by an optical microscope) and channel width (W = 1400 μm). The active layer was spin-cast onto the octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified SiO2/Si substrates from a chlorobenzene solution with a concentration of 2.5–5 mg mL−1 at 1500–2000 rpm for 60 seconds. The performance of OFETs was optimized with different channel lengths and annealing temperatures. The mobility values were obtained from the source–drain current–gate voltage curves (IDS versus VG) in well-resolved saturation regions. A summary of the device parameters measured for PNTP, PNBO, PNfTB and PNffTB based OFETs is listed in Table 5. All the transistors derived from these heteroatom substituted copolymers show typical p-type transporting behaviour. Fig. 4 shows representative output and transfer characteristics of PNBO, PNTP, PNfTB and PNffTB-based OFETs. The performance of OFET made with all these copolymers greatly relies on the annealing temperature. After the thermal annealing process, the hole mobility of PNfTB is dramatically increased reaching 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a current on/off ratio up to 107. Such a large charge mobility enhancement upon thermal annealing suggests that the crystallinity of the polymer thin films and the ordered lamellar structure of π–π close packing for the polymer backbone are greatly improved at high annealing temperatures.

AFM images of polymer thin films were investigated at various annealing temperatures to understand the hole mobility enhancement after high temperature annealing (see Fig. 5 and S3†). The selected AFM height images of PNTP and PNBO thin films annealed (a and c) at room temperature and (b and d) at 220 °C are shown in Fig. 5, and AFM height images of PNfTB and PNffTB thin films annealed (a and c) at room temperature and (b and d) at 220 °C are shown in Fig. S3.† Pristine and annealed films of PNTP, PNBO and PNffTB showed a disordered structure, which is consistent with their relatively poor performance. In contrast, AFM images of thin films of PNfTB show larger polycrystalline grains, which would favour the charge carrier transport leading to an increase in the FET performance.

Conclusions
A novel series of naphthodithiophene and dithienylbenzothiadiazole alternating copolymers namely PNTP, PNBO, PNfTB and PNffTB bearing various heteroatoms including fluorine, oxygen or nitrogen incorporated into electron-deficient benzothiadiazole units was designed and synthesized. The heteroatom effect on photovoltaic and charge carrier mobility properties was investigated. These heteroatom-substituted copolymers generally exhibited a narrower optical band gap relative to their unsubstituted counterparts. Because of the enhanced electron-withdrawing ability of heteroatom-substituted benzothiadiazole units, the LUMO energy levels of these copolymers were substantially stabilized. In addition, the strongly electronegative fluorine atom can effectively lower the HOMO energy level of the resulting copolymers giving rise to a higher open circuit voltage of OSCs. The BHJ OSCs fabricated from the blend of these copolymers with incorporation of different heteroatoms and PC71BM with ZnO/Al as a double interlayer in an inverted device structure exhibited comparable Voc, FF and Jsc values with PCE in the range of 4.76–5.05%. Furthermore, among the OFETs fabricated from these copolymers, PNfTB, bearing fluorinated benzothiadiazole units, based devices afforded an increased hole mobility up to 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an on/off current ratio exceeding 107, which was attributed to the enhanced intermolecular/interchain interactions induced by fluorine substitution. Therefore, in conclusion, our results demonstrated that heteroatom-substituted PNB-based copolymers are promising candidates for further exploration in various high-performance organic electronic devices.
