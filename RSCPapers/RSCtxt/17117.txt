Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using the synthesized polymers as electron donors with fullerene derivatives where the best power conversion efficiencies were found to be 2.03% for P1:PC71BM (1:3, w:w), 2.22% for P2:PC71BM (1:4, w:w) and 1.52% for P3:PC71BM (1:2, w:w) with methanol treatment.
Introduction
In today's world, based upon the depletion of resources and increase in demand for energy due to industrialization, development of technology and population growth, the search for new energy sources has gained momentum. Renewable energy sources are the solution for both addressing the energy needs and the elimination of environmental concerns. Solar power is the cleanest and the most abundant type of renewable energy. Due to this, over the past few decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained great popularity as renewable energy sources due to their low cost, flexibility, facile processing and portability1–3 Still, PSCs are not suitable for commercialization because of their low power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to their inorganic counterparts.4 Obtaining high PCE necessitates a low band gap, suitable HOMO and LUMO levels in order to increase the short-circuit current (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) and high carrier mobility to make hole transportation easier.5 A bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is one of the remedies to increase the PCE of PSCs, which is composed of a p-type polymer as a donor and n-type fullerene derivatives as acceptor materials in a photoactive layer.6,7 The working principle of an organic solar cell can be divided into five main steps which include light absorption, generation of a bound electron–hole pair (exciton), exciton diffusion from the donor to the donor–acceptor interface, charge separation and charge extraction towards the respective electrodes.8,9 A BHJ provides effective exciton dissociation without recombination by extending the interfacial area between the donor and acceptor material.10 By this means, the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs can be enhanced by a bicontinuous interpenetrating network. Undoubtedly, the donor–acceptor approach is another remarkable way to achieve high PCE by lowering the band gap. Based on this approach, electron rich donor and electron deficient acceptor units are combined in the polymer backbone and create a new narrow band gap energy that leads to the absorption of longer wavelengths in the solar spectrum, enhancement of optical and electrochemical properties and also improvement of exciton charge separation and charge mobility.11,12 With its strongly electronegative imine groups, relatively stable quinoid form and high solubility properties the quinoxaline unit is one of the most popular acceptor moieties to achieve low band gap conjugated polymers.6,13,14 Furthermore, quinoxaline units offer the possibility of tuning the electron withdrawing character by introducing substituent groups either on the benzene or on the pyrazine rings.15,16 Moreover, they can be combined with different electron rich donor groups such as benzodithiophene (BDT), carbazole and fluorene to obtain solar cells with a high PCE.17–19 Among these donor units, BDT demonstrates an excellent electron donor property due to its planar conjugated structure and the ability to generate π–π stacking easily.20 Its benzene coherent thiophene structure provides a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level for the relevant polymer. Besides, alkyl or alkoxy substituents assigned to BDT derivatives increase the solubility of the polymer in different organic solvents.21 When combined with BDT derivatives, quinoxaline based polymers achieve a high PCE as a result of the high VOC.17,22,23
Another widely used acceptor moiety is benzotriazole (BTz), which plays an important role in photovoltaic studies due to its ascendant electrochromic and photovoltaic properties.24 Many BTz derivatives are suitable for single layer electrochemical devices due to their switching ability between multicolored and transmissive states.25,26 In addition to their usage in electrochemical devices, BTz units have a high demand in photovoltaic applications since placing a benzotriazole in the polymer chain results in a low-lying LUMO level.7,27,28 They demonstrate a strong electron transporting ability thanks to the electron withdrawing nature of the imine bond. In addition, the solubility of the final polymer product can be enhanced by long alkyl chain substitution on the nitrogen position of the BTz.29 The solubility of a polymer is a crucial parameter not only to make the purification steps easier but also for producing high quality thin films for device applications.30 Finally, easy modification of the N–H bond of the BTz unit provides an improvement of the structural and electronic properties for the good processing ability of the BTz containing polymers.31
In this study, three quinoxaline moieties with different substituents were chosen to combine with BTz and BDT units to achieve broad visible light absorption. Broad light absorption can be achieved by covering a considerable part of the visible spectrum. In the literature, benzodithiophene and quinoxaline based copolymers demonstrate maximum absorption values of around 600–730 nm.32–35 Also, copolymers including benzotriazole and benzodithiophene derivatives reveal a maximum absorption at around 500 nm.36,37 Addition of the benzotriazole unit to the quinoxaline-benzodithiophene containing polymer backbone makes up for the lack of absorption at the green part of the visible region. Herein, 4,7-dibromo-2-(2-octyldodecyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene were randomly polymerized with 5,8-dibromo-2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline, 5,8-dibromo-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline and 10,13-dibromodibenzo[a,c]phenazine to provide broad visible light absorption and enhance the power conversion efficiency of the PSCs.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals and reagents used in the syntheses of the monomers and the polymerization processes were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co. Ltd. Metallic sodium and benzophenone were used for drying tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene. Besides these, solvents were used without any purification or drying steps. PC71BM was purchased from Solenne for solar cell application. Moisture and air sensitive procedures were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere and the others were carried out under air. Column chromatography was used for purification of materials by using Merck Silica Gel 60.
Measurements
The nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy technique was used to confirm the chemical structures of both the monomers and polymers. 1H and 13C NMR shifts were taken using a Bruker Spectrospin Avance DPX-400 Spectrometer according to the trimethylsilane (TMS) internal reference in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3). For the polymers, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to estimate average molecular weights by taking the polystyrene standard as the internal standard in chloroform (CHCl3). Spectroelectrochemical studies of the synthesized polymers were performed by using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis Spectrometer. For cyclic voltammetry studies, polymers dissolved in CHCl3 were sprayed onto indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass and studies were performed by using a Gamry 600 potentiostat in a three electrode cell consisting of an ITO-coated glass slide as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag wire as the reference electrode. Measurements were collected in a solution of 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6)/acetonitrile (ACN) solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.
Syntheses
9-(Bromomethyl)nonadecane, 4,7-dibromo-1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole, 4,7-dibromo-2-(2-octyldodecyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole, 5,8-dibromo-2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline, 5,8-dibromo-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline, and 10,13-dibromodibenzo[a,c]phenazine were synthesized according to literature reports with some modifications.38,39

Synthesis of P1. 
For the synthesis of P1 the Stille coupling reaction procedure was followed by placing together 4,7-dibromo-2-(2-octyldodecyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (4) (0.246 g, 0.442 mmol), 5,8-dibromo-2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline (5) (0.200 g, 0.442 mmol) and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (0.653 g, 0.884 mmol). After exposing the monomer blend to argon gas, the reactants were dissolved in 10 mL dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) under an argon atmosphere. The reaction solution was bubbled with argon for 40 minutes to remove air. Afterwards, a catalytic amount of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (0.040 g, 0.044 mmol) (5% of benzodithiophene unit) and tris(o-tolyl)phosphine (0.027 g, 0.088 mmol) as the co-catalyst (10% of benzodithiophene unit) were added to the medium and the reaction was refluxed at 70 °C for 39 hours. Before the addition of bromothiophene (0.216 g, 1.327 mmol), the catalyst tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (0.020 g, 0.022 mmol) and the co-catalyst tris(o-tolyl)phosphine (0.013 g, 0.044 mmol) were placed into the solution and then the reaction was stirred for 6 hours. Later, trimethyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane (0.990 g, 2.654 mmol) was added with the same amount of extra catalyst mentioned previously. Another 6 hours were spent before the reaction was stopped and cooled to room temperature. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the reaction was precipitated in cold methanol. Afterwards, the solid residue was filtered by vacuum and purification was performed by Soxhlet apparatus. Acetone, hexane and chloroform were used to discard oligomers, small molecules, catalysts and other reactants, respectively. The polymer was collected by using chloroform. After evaporation of the solvent, the polymer was precipitated in cold methanol again and vacuum filtration was used to obtain the pure product (0.520 g, 74% yield).

Synthesis of P2. 
The same procedure as with P1 was pursued for the synthetic pathway of P2. Thus, 4,7-dibromo-2-(2-octyldodecyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (5) (0.126 g, 0.227 mmol), 5,8-dibromo-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (6) (0.100 g, 0.227 mmol) and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (0.351 g, 0.454 mmol) were mixed in the reaction medium and kept under argon before addition of 8 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF). The reaction solution was bubbled with argon for 40 minutes to remove air. Afterwards, a catalytic amount of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (0.021 g, 0.022 mmol) and tris(o-tolyl)phosphine (0.014 g, 0.045 mmol) as the co-catalyst were added to the medium and the reaction was refluxed at 70 °C for 34 hours under an argon atmosphere. Before the addition of bromothiophene (0.111 g, 0.682 mmol), a catalytic amount of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) and the co-catalyst tris(o-tolyl)phosphine were placed into the solution. Then, the reaction was stirred for 6 hours. Later, trimethyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane (0.508 g, 1.362 mmol) was added with extra catalyst. Another 6 hours were consumed before the reaction was stopped and cooled to room temperature. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the reaction was precipitated in cold methanol. Afterwards, the solid residue was filtered by vacuum and purification was performed by Soxhlet apparatus. The polymer was collected with chloroform. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was precipitated in cold methanol again and the pure polymer was achieved by filtration (0.296 g, 85% yield).
(GPC: Mn: 49.6 kDa, Mw: 149.5 kDa, PDI: 3.0).


Synthesis of P3. 
The same procedure as for P1 and P2 was applied for the synthetic pathway of P3. Thus, 4,7-dibromo-2-(2-octyldodecyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (4) (0.127 g, 0.228 mmol), 10,13-dibromodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (7) (0.100 g, 0.228 mmol) and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (0.352 g, 0.456 mmol) were mixed in the reaction medium in 8 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF). The reaction solution was bubbled with argon for 40 minutes to remove air. Afterwards, a catalytic amount of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (0.021 g, 0.022 mmol) and tris(o-tolyl)phosphine (0.014 g, 0.045 mmol) as the co-catalyst were added to the medium and the reaction was refluxed at 70 °C for 44 hours under an argon atmosphere. Before the addition of bromothiophene (0.111 g, 0.682 mmol), a catalytic amount of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) and the co-catalyst tris(o-tolyl)phosphine were placed into the solution. Then, the reaction was stirred for 6 hours. Afterwards, trimethyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane (0.508 g, 1.362 mmol) was added with extra catalyst. Another 6 hours were consumed before the reaction was stopped and cooled to room temperature. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the reaction was precipitated in cold methanol. Afterwards, the solid residue was filtered by vacuum and purification was performed by Soxhlet apparatus. The polymer was collected with chloroform. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was precipitated in cold methanol again and the pure polymer was achieved by filtration (0.311 g, 86% yield).

Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
Basically a BHJ polymer solar cell includes the layers of ITO, PEDOT:PSS, polymer:PC71BM, LiF and Al. ITO glass substrates that were purchased from Visiontek Systems were etched by acid solution and cleaned with toluene, Hellmanex as the detergent, water and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. After drying with N2, the oxygen plasma cleaning step was performed with a Harrick Plasma Cleaner to remove residual organic impurities on the ITO. Then, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Heraus V P Al 4083) was coated on the clean ITO surface via the spin coating technique. The substrates were heated to 135 °C for 15 min to remove residual water. Polymer-PC71BM blends with different weight ratios were prepared and coated by using spin coating under a N2 atmosphere. Then, LiF and Al were thermally evaporated on the active layer as the electron transport layer and the cathode respectively. A Keithley 2400 source meter was used in order to record J–V curves under AM 1.5 G illumination.
Results and discussion
Optical studies
Absorption spectra of all three polymers in both thin film and chloroform solution are illustrated in Fig. 1 and the results are summarized in Table 1. P1, P2 and P3 demonstrated broad visible light absorption as expected. Copolymers P1, P2 and P3 showed two absorption maxima that include one in a short wavelength zone due to the π–π* transition of the conjugated polymer backbone and the other in the long wavelength zone due to the intramolecular charge transfer from donor to acceptor units.40 The maximum absorption values of P1, P2 and P3 thin films were recorded as 374/539, 493/535 and 488/532 nm respectively.

All polymers have similar donor and acceptor groups but they were synthesized via random copolymerization. Thus, all have different molecular weights and also the number and order of the repeating units are different. Actually P2 also has a peak at around 400 nm but the peak height is smaller compared to that of P3 (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic procedure of the monomers and polymers. 
Although all polymers have absorption peaks at 400, 500 and 550 nm the intensity of these are different. The colors of the polymers also support the explanation. Also, the λmax values of P1, P2 and P3 in solution were observed as 369/530, 491/534, and 486/529 nm correspondingly. The maximum absorption peaks of P1, P2 and P3 in thin films were nearly identical to the peaks in the solution state and they were red shifted by only 9, 1 and 3 nm respectively. Intermolecular stacking and conformational alterations cause such shifts in the spectra.41 The red shift in the thin film form can be explained by the decrease in conformational freedom, aggregation or the interaction between solvent and polymer chains.42 Such low differences between the thin film and solution state indicate the shortage of aggregation and weak solvent–polymer interaction. Apparently, the polymers were reunited in the thin film state and showed pre-aggregates in solution because of the strong inter chain interactions.
Electrochemical studies
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were performed in order to examine the redox potentials and HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the three random polymers. For measurements, the copolymers were dissolved in CHCl3 (5 mg mL−1) and spray coated onto ITO coated glass substrates. CV studies were carried out in a three electrode system. The recorded electrochemical data of all polymers were obtained from cyclic voltammograms as indicated in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 2. All the polymers have an ambipolar character as shown in the figure. Oxidation potentials of the polymers (p-doping) were recorded at 1.10 V, 1.08 V and 1.00 V for P1, P2 and P3 respectively. n-Type doping, and the potentials of P1, P2, and P3 were recorded at −1.50 V/−1.95 V, −1.43 V/−1.93 V and −1.48 V/−1.91 V in return. When comparing all three polymers in terms of their oxidation–reduction potentials, as expected P3 demonstrated a lower oxidation potential due to the high electron density of its fused phenyl structure compared to P2. Although the thiophene unit has more electron donating ability and P1 is expected to perform oxidation and reduction processes easier than the benzene substituted P2, the oxidation potential of P1 is nearly the same as that of P2. This result can be attributed to the low conjugation length of P1 when compared to its counterparts.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated by taking the normal hydrogen electrode value as −4.75 eV. The HOMO–LUMO energy levels were calculated using the equations of HOMO = −(4.75 + Eonsetox) and LUMO = −(4.75 + Eonsetred). The HOMO energy levels of the random copolymers were calculated as −5.15 eV, −5.52 eV and −5.35 eV for P1, P2 and P3 correspondingly. The HOMO energy levels are crucial parameters for solar cell application. To achieve a successful hole transfer in solar cell application, the HOMO level of the donor unit should be higher than that of the acceptor. All polymers show higher HOMO levels when compared with that of PC71BM which has a −6.10 eV HOMO energy level.43 As seen, P1 has the highest lying HOMO level that may lead to lower power conversion efficiency via lowering the VOC value. With the replacement of the thiophene substituent by benzene, a lower HOMO level than P1 was obtained with P2. P2 has the lowest lying HOMO level which can provide a high VOC. Also, the LUMO level of the polymer is another crucial criterion for polymers in order to perform good charge separation. For effective charge separation, the energy difference between the LUMO level of the donor unit and the LUMO level of the acceptor should be around 0.3 eV.44 According to CV studies, the LUMO levels of the polymers were found to be −3.45, −3.47 and −3.63 eV for P1, P2 and P3. All of the polymers will show effective charge transfer to PCBM.
The electronic band gap of the random copolymers was calculated as the difference between the HOMO and LUMO levels. From the HOMO–LUMO equation, the electronic band gaps of the polymers were calculated as 1.70, 2.05, and 1.72 eV, respectively. It is a common result that the Eelg of a conjugated polymer is higher than Eopg since charge species such as polarons can locate on the polymer chain and some energy barriers may occur at electrodes during charge transfer. Although P2 and P3 follow this usual trend, P1 demonstrates a higher optical band gap value compared with its electronic band gap. Such an unusual result can be explained by the uncompleted oxidation of the polymer during the doping procedure. P3 shows a lower electronic band gap than P2 due to its fused phenyl ring structure that enhances planarity and makes the electron transportation easier with its two connected benzene rings. P1 with the thiophene bearing quinoxaline unit has a lower band gap than P2.
The band gap of a polymer is decreased with the quinoid resonance stabilization.3 The thiophene unit can generate the quinoid form easier than the benzene ring due to the low aromatic resonance stabilization which results in the low band gap of P1.45
A conductivity value of 0.01 S cm−1 is measured for a free standing film of 30 micron thickness. However this value does not refer to that of the component used in device construction. The differences between the HOMO, LUMO and electronic band gap values of the polymers are mainly because of the change in electron density and donating abilities of the side groups. It can be concluded that the conjugated substituent groups certainly affect the electronic properties of the polymers.
Spectroelectrochemical studies
For spectroelectrochemical studies, an external potential was applied to the polymer film stepwise and the spectra are obtained by using UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy as illustrated in Fig. 3. The potential was applied between 0.0 V and 1.2 V for P1 and P2, and 0.0 V and 1.1 V for P3 steadily. In order to obtain accurate neutral state absorption, the polymer thin films were exposed to a constant potential to remove any trapped charge or ions before the measurements. Dual maximum absorption wavelengths were recorded for all polymers at 374/539, 493/535 and 488/532 for P1, P2 and P3 respectively. During the p type doping process, while the absorption in the visible zone started to reduce due to the formation of polarons and bipolarons which are the charge carriers on the polymer chain, new absorption bands at high wavelengths arose. Peaks around 1600 nm in Fig. 3c appeared due to the instrumental noise, unfortunately common for these wavelengths. The optical band gap (Eopg) values of P1, P2 and P3 were calculated from the onsets of lowest π–π* transitions according to Eopg = 1241/λonset and found to be 1.74 eV, 1.87 eV and 1.70 eV correspondingly as illustrated in Table 3. The relatively low band gap of the thiophene based polymer provides an opportunity to provide high absorption at the high wavelength region of the solar spectrum.32 The aim of having a broad visible absorption was successfully achieved by covering the red, blue and green regions of the spectrum.

On the other hand, the donor group on the polymer backbone affects the absorption spectra, band gap value and all the optical properties of the polymers. In the literature, the random copolymers of CoP1, CoP2 and CoP3 published by our group, including a thiophene unit as the donor and the same quinoxaline and benzotriazole units as the acceptor demonstrate lower optical band gap values compared to P1, P2 and P3.38
The benzodithophene unit has more electron donor character with its benzene fused thiophene structure and also offers a longer conjugation length, thus the polymers synthesized in this study are expected to show a lower band gap compared to those of CoP1, CoP2 and CoP3. The underlying reason behind this unexpected result can be the stronger π stacking ability of the small thiophene unit, which reduces the steric hindrance and enhances the interchain π–π stacking for effective charge carrier mobility.46 Also, because of the differences during the polymerization processes, P1, P2 and P3 could have a lower solubility than their counterparts and the low solubility of the polymers may cause the low conjugation length that results in lower band gaps.
For the scientific expression of colors, colorimetric measurements of the thin film state polymers were performed at all stages of the oxidation process and the colors of the polymers were identified using CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) coordinates. The CIE coordinate system comprises three components including luminance (L), hue (a), and saturation (b). The colors of the natural and the oxidized-reduced state of the polymers are demonstrated in Fig. 3 and the colorimetric study results including L, a, and b values are summarized in Table 4.

As seen in Fig. 3, all the polymers exhibit different tones of purple color in the neutral state, and they turn to gray in their oxidized state with different intermediates. While P1 and P2 have darker purple and gray in the corresponding states, both tones are lighter for P2 which can be explained by the higher molecular weight and lower solubility of P2. All polymers show ambipolar behaviour and show a grayish blue color in their reduced states.
Kinetic studies
Kinetic studies were performed in order to investigate the switching times and the optical contrast for the copolymers. Optical contrast basically is the percent transmittance change at a given wavelength and switching time is the time required for switching between neutral and oxidized states (Fig. 4). For kinetic studies, polymer coated ITO glass was exposed to a sweeping potential between the two extreme states with 5 s time intervals in 0.1 M TBAPF6/ACN (Table 5).

Photovoltaic studies
The photovoltaic properties of the synthesized polymers were investigated using the conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. Polymers P1, P2 and P3 were used as the donor materials and blended with PC71BM which was used as the acceptor material. Solvent optimizations were carried out and the 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) processed PCSs showed a superior performance compared to the ones with chlorobenzene. In all the optimizations, the polymer concentration was fixed to 15 mg mL−1. The current density–voltage characteristics of the devices were tested under an illumination of AM 1.5 G with a power of 100 mW cm−2. The J–V curves of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 5. In addition, the polymer:PC71BM weight ratio optimizations were carried out.

As depicted in Table 6, the 1:3, 1:4 and 1:2 polymer:PC71BM weight ratios were found to be optimum weight ratios for the P1, P2 and P3 based PSCs, respectively. Due to its HOMO energy level being the deepest the P2 incorporated PSCs showed the highest VOC values which depend on the energy difference between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the PC71BM.47,48 With MeOH treatment, the PCE of the PSCs was improved from 1.80% to 2.03%, 1.49% to 2.22% and 1.37% to 1.52% for P1, P2 and P3 incorporated PSCs, respectively. In addition to these optimization studies, thermal annealing and the addition of DIO were carried out, however no improvement was observed.

Although the exact mechanism of the enhancement with MeOH treatment cannot be explained yet, many different approaches were developed to clarify this phenomenon. One of them states that with MeOH treatment interface dipoles are generated which reduce the injection barriers by increasing the vacuum level of the cathode and this situation improves the contact between the active layer and the cathode material. Then, PCE is improved by enhancing the charge transportations and also extractions.49,50 Also, the reason behind this increment could be due to the optimization of the phase separation and the improvement of the interface between the active layer and PEDOT:PSS.51 Another explanation states that the solvent treatment causes enhancement of the surface charge density and the built in voltage by eliminating the traps on the surface of the solar cell devices.52
Although P2 has the highest band gap value among them, its photovoltaic device has the highest PCE value of 2.22% which could be due to the molecular weight that enhances the intermolecular charge hopping process by increasing the polymer chain length.53 This phenomenon could also be the reason for the low PCE of P3 which has a lower molecular weight compared to P1 and P2. For P1, the best PCE result was calculated as 2.03% for P1:PC71BM (1:3, w:w) with a VOC value of 0.70 V and a JSC value of 7.85 mA cm−2via applying methanol treatment. The fill factor value for the best device is 37% for P1.
For P2, the best PCE result was obtained as 2.22% from the device P2:PC71BM (1:4, w:w) with MeOH treatment. The VOC value is 0.78 V, JSC is 4.74 mA cm−2 and FF is 0.60 for this device configuration. For P3 the highest device performance was recorded with P3:PC71BM (1:2, w:w) with MeOH treatment as 1.52%. The VOC, JSC and FF values were estimated as 0.76 V, 4.08 mA cm−2 and 49% respectively. A previous study in 2016 shows that benzotriazole, thiophene and benzene containing quinoxaline bearing a random copolymer (CoP2) based PSCs achieved the highest PCE value of 1.72%. The PCE was improved from 1.72% to 2.22% due to enhancement of the VOC value. The reason behind this increment could be the BDT unit that provides the low-lying HOMO level, which enhances the VOC and also PCE.54,55
Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out for the best performance solar cells. 43.72%, 21.60% and 19.51% IPCE values were obtained for P1, P2 and P3 incorporated solar cells. The corresponding IPCE curves are depicted in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  IPCE curves of P1, P2 and P3 based solar cells. 
It is a well known fact that the morphology of the polymer–fullerene blend affects the PCE of solar cell devices.56 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized in order to get information on the morphology of the devices. For this purpose, AFM and TEM analyses of active layers showing the best performance were conducted and the images are shown in Fig. 7. The root mean square roughness (Rms) of the active layers was measured from the active layers of P1:PC71BM (1:3, w:w), P2:PC71BM (1:4, w:w) and P3:PC71BM (1:2, w:w) as 1.54 nm, 5.42 nm and 2.15 nm, respectively. Also, the thicknesses of the best performance active layers were estimated as 138 nm for P1:PC71BM (1:3, w:w), 123 nm for P2:PC71BM (1:4, w:w) and 124 nm for P3:PC71BM (1:2, w:w). The darker areas in the TEM images correspond to the PCBM rich areas while the lighter ones are the contributions of the polymer rich areas.

FF is the degree of rectangularity of the current density vs. voltage curve. It mainly depends on the morphology of the active layer. For a high fill factor device, an interpenetrated bicontinuous nanoscale network active layer morphology is required. As seen in the TEM and AFM images the absence of the interpenetrated donor acceptor morphology may be the reason for the low fill factor values obtained in P1, P2 and P3 based solar cells.
Conclusions
In this study, quinoxaline, benzotriazole and benzodithiophene containing random copolymers were successfully synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction to be used for photovoltaic device studies. This study aimed to produce polymers with a broad visible light absorption by combining benzodithiophene and quinoxaline moieties on the polymer backbone. This approach demonstrates a maximum absorption value of around 600–730 nm in the literature. Also the benzotriazole and benzodithiophene units show a maximum light absorption at around 500 nm in the literature. Broad visible light absorption was achieved for P1, P2 and P3 where they demonstrate maximum absorption peaks at 374/539, 493/535 and 488/532 respectively. Optical band gap values of the polymers were calculated from the onsets of the lowest π–π* transitions as 1.74 eV, 1.87 eV and 1.70 eV for P1, P2 and P3. The highest optical contrast value was recorded for P1 as 52% at 760 nm. Also, the best switching time value was estimated as 0.7 s for P3 at 1700 nm. From the electrochemical studies, the HOMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated to be −5.15, −5.52 and −5.35 eV while their LUMO levels were −3.45, −3.47 and 3.63 eV respectively. The electronic band gaps were calculated as 1.70, 2.05, and 1.72 eV for P1, P2 and P3. In light of this information, bulk heterojunction type solar cells were successfully constructed and due to the broad visible light absorption character of the copolymers, the best results were recorded as 2.03% for P1 with P1:PC71BM (1:3, w:w), 2.22% for P2:PC71BM (1:4, w:w) and 1.52% for P3 with P3:PC71BM (1:2, w:w). Compared with the literature examples, P1, P2 and P3 demonstrate high VOC values for locating the BDT unit on the polymer backbone. Among them, the highest PCE was achieved for benzene substituted quinoxaline based P2 with high VOC and FF values which makes this quinoxaline unit a good candidate for incorporation with different donors in further studies.
