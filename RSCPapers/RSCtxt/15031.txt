    , Accepted 8th October 2016First published on 10th October 2016AbstractThe morphological characteristics of metal play a pivotal role in affecting the activity of metal–semiconductor composite photocatalysts for solar energy conversion. In this article, geometry- and size-controlled sub-20 nm Pd nanocubes (NCs) have been fabricated and hybridized with 2D TiO2 nanosheets (TNS) to explore how the geometry and size of Pd influences the photocatalytic efficiency of Pd-based semiconductor composites. The photoactivity results evaluated by the dual-function photocatalytic system for simultaneous H2 evolution and 1,1-diethoxyethane (DEE) production suggest that Pd NCs endow TNS with a greatly enhanced photoactivity compared to Pd nanoparticles (NPs) supported on 2D TNS. The activation energy for H2 generation and the adsorption affinity between Pd and hydrogen molecules can be modulated by the geometry differences between Pd NCs and Pd NPs. Meanwhile, the activity of TNS–Pd NCs composites can be increased by decreasing the size of the Pd NCs from 17 to 7 nm, which is predominantly attributed to the more efficient capability of small Pd NCs to boost the separation and transportation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. Our work not only fundamentally elucidates the relationship between the morphological characteristics of metal Pd and the photoactivity of Pd-based semiconductor composites, but also supplies a dual-purpose sustainable way for simultaneous H2 evolution and organic synthesis of fine chemicals.
1. Introduction
The conversion of solar energy into sustainable hydrogen (H2) fuel, achieved by photocatalytic water splitting that mimics photosynthesis, has been perceived as a promising solution to tackle energy and environmental issues and has thus attracted intense attention during recent decades.1–17 However, in most studies, the requirement of sacrificial reagents (e.g., methanol and ethanol) for speeding up the consumption of photogenerated holes during H2 evolution not only greatly increases the system cost but also wastes the energy of the holes,2–4,7,9,11,15,18–28 thus making these established reaction systems unfavorable for the practical application of photocatalytic H2 production. A logical way to solve the problems mentioned above is to construct a dual-function photocatalytic reaction system composed of a water-splitting reaction and an organic oxidation reaction, in which the photoexcited electrons and holes are simultaneously utilized for H2 generation and a selective organic transformation, respectively, offering us a promising avenue to fully make use of the photogenerated charge carriers29–31 and reducing the overall cost of water spitting by simultaneously recovering H2 gas and high-value chemicals products. Consequently, such a dual-purpose photocatalytic approach could be more practical and feasible compared to water splitting with sacrificial reagents from the perspective of economic and social sustainability.
The deposition of noble metals (such as Au, Ag and Pd etc.) as co-catalysts on the host semiconductor to spatially separate the photogenerated charge carriers and serve as active sites is an effective way to construct dual-function photocatalysts with high catalytic efficiency.32–35 Among these noble metals, metal Pd has attracted considerable research attention because the nanosized Pd loaded semiconductor photocatalyst is a highly active catalyst used in various kinds of photocatalytic reactions,36–40 such as H2 generation, selective organic transformations and environmental remediation. As with many other catalysts, the photoactivity of Pd-based semiconductor composites can be controlled through the use of size- and shape-controlled nanocrystalline Pd, which provides a means to manipulate its electronic parameters to govern the efficiency of the charge transfer and, thus, its photocatalytic performance.33,41,42 For instance, Luo and co-workers39 have shown that Pd nanocubes (NCs) loaded onto a CdS photocatalyst exhibit better visible light activity for H2 generation than Pd nanoparticles (NPs) decorated onto a CdS photocatalyst; the higher Pd atom density of the (100) facets of the Pd NCs is regarded as the main factor for enhanced photoactivity. Nevertheless, the influence of different sizes of Pd NCs and Pd NPs on the activity of the Pd–CdS composites has not been taken into consideration in the previous work.39 Until now, a systematic study on the effect of morphological characteristics (i.e., geometry and size) of Pd on the photocatalytic efficiency of Pd-based semiconductor composites, especially for dual-purpose photocatalysis applications, has not been available.
Herein, we report the incorporation of geometry- and size-controlled sub-20 nm Pd NCs with 2D TiO2 nanosheets (TNS) in an attempt to fundamentally elucidate the geometry- and size-effects of metal Pd on the photoactivity of Pd–semiconductor composites. Besides the high charge density (100) facets of the Pd NCs which affect the activation energy of H2 evolution,39 the other main reason why we selected Pd NCs smaller than 20 nm is to rule out the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) induced photocatalysis of Pd which occurs with larger nanocubes43–45 and thus construct a reasonable framework for independently revealing the intrinsic morphological characteristics – photoactivity correlation between Pd and the semiconductor. The photocatalytic performance of the TNS–Pd composites has been evaluated by a dual-function photocatalytic system for simultaneous H2 evolution and 1,1-diethoxyethane (DEE) production in ethanol media under UV-vis light irradiation (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm). The results have shown that both the activation energy of H2 generation and the adsorption affinity between the Pd and hydrogen molecules can be modulated by the geometry effect of metal Pd, resulting in a higher photocatalytic efficiency for TNS–Pd NCs composites than that of TNS–Pd NPs composites. Meanwhile, by decreasing the size of the Pd NCs from 17 to 7 nm, the photoactivity of the TNS–Pd NCs composites (denoted as TCs-x, where x represents the size of Pd NCs) is improved. Specifically, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (51.5 mmol g−1 h−1) and the DEE production rate (7.7 mmol g−1 h−1) over the TCs-7 sample are higher than the H2 evolution rate (33.1 mmol g−1 h−1) and DEE production (5.2 mmol g−1 h−1) over the TCs-17 composites. Characterizations of the samples show that the photoactivity enhancement can be ascribed to two factors: (i) the small Pd NCs with abundant corner and edge atoms can efficiently facilitate the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and elongate the lifetime of the charge carriers; (ii) the smaller Pd NCs possess a larger number of surface Pd atoms, which could provide more active Pd sites to take part in the photocatalytic reactions.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, M.W. ≈ 55000) and potassium palladium(II) chloride (K2PdCl4) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(OBu)4, 98%), hydrofluoric acid (47%), potassium bromide (KBr), potassium chloride (KCl), L-ascorbic acid (C6H8O6), lysine (C6H14N2O2), palladium chloride (PdCl2), ethanol (C2H6O) were all obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All of the reagents were used as received without further purification. Deionized (DI) water was supplied by local sources.
2.2. Catalyst preparation

2.2.1 Preparation of TiO2 nanosheets (TNS). 
Anatase TiO2 nanosheets (denoted as TNS) were synthesized by our previously reported method.46 Typically, 5 mL of Ti(OBu)4 and 1 mL of hydrofluoric acid solution were mixed in a dried Teflon autoclave with a capacity of 50 mL, and then kept at 453 K for 24 h. Caution! Hydrofluoric acid is extremely corrosive and toxic, and should be handled with extreme care. After being cooled to room temperature, the white powder was separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol and deionized water for several times.


2.2.2 Synthesis of palladium nanocubes (Pd NCs) with different sizes. 
In a typical synthesis of Pd NCs with different sizes, 8.0 mL of an aqueous solution containing PVP (105 mg), L-ascorbic acid (60 mg), and different amounts of KBr and/or KCl were placed in a 25 mL vial, and pre-heated under magnetic stirring at 353 K for 10 min. Subsequently, 3.0 mL of an aqueous solution containing K2PdCl4 (63 mg) was then added into the flask, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 353 K for 3 h. The product was collected by centrifugation, and washed with water several times to remove excessive PVP. The as-obtained Pd NCs were re-dispersed in water with the determined Pd concentration (1 mg mL−1).


2.2.3 Fabrication of TNS–Pd composites. 
The composites of TNS–Pd NCs with different-sized Pd NCs were prepared by wet impregnation. Typical, 100 mg TNS were dispersed in water by sonication. Then, 10 mL of an aqueous solution containing Pd NCs in different sizes with a desirable concentration (0.1 mg mL−1) was added using a pipette under vigorous magnetic stirring. After being kept at room temperature for 24 h, the TNS–Pd NC photocatalysts with Pd NCs of different sizes were isolated by filtration, washed with water and dried in an oven overnight at 333 K for 12 h. The TNS–Pd nanoparticles were prepared by the impregnation–reduction method. Typically, TNS (100 mg) and lysine (15 mg) were dissolved in 100 mL deionized water with in an ice bath followed by adding the desired amount of H2PdCl4 solution (0.01 M) into the abovementioned solution. After 60 min under magnetic stirring, 10 mL of freshly prepared NaBH4 (40 mg) aqueous solution was added dropwise. The mixture was aged for 3 h at 273 K. The precipitate was then separated by filtration, washed with water and dried at 333 K for 12 h.

2.3. Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were analyzed using a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ ranging from 10 to 80° at a scan rate of 0.02° s−1. The Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Renishaw inVia Raman System 1000 with a 532 nm Nd:YAG excitation source. The laser power incident on the samples was 10 mW. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was operated on a Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab 250 spectrometer, which is made of a monochromatic Al Kα as the X-ray source, a hemispherical analyzer, and sample stage with multiaxial adjustability to obtain the surface composition of the products. All the binding energies were calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. The Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed on a Nicolet Nexus 670 FT-IR spectrophotometer at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The optical properties of the samples were characterized by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) using UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary 500, Varian Co.) in which BaSO4 was employed as a reference. The photoluminescence spectra (PL) for powder samples were analyzed on an Edinburgh Analytical Instrument F900 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. To ensure the comparability of the PL spectra, the experimental parameters, including the excitation wavelength, slit width, and the amount of the samples, were identical. The electrochemical analysis was conducted in a conventional three electrode cell, which uses a Pt plate as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass that was cleaned by sonication in ethanol and dried at 353 K for 2 h. The boundary of FTO glass was protected using Scotch tape. The 5 mg sample was fully dispersed in 0.5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, supplied from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) by sonication to get slurry. The slurry was spread onto the pre-treated FTO glass. After air drying, the working electrode was further dried at 393 K for 2 h to improve adhesion. Then, the Scotch tape was unstuck, and the uncoated part of the electrode was isolated with epoxy resin. The exposed area of the working electrode was 0.25 cm2. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (Autolab, PGSTAT204) in the electrolyte of 0.5 M KCl aqueous solution containing 0.01 M K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] (1:1) by applying an AC voltage with 5 mV amplitude in a frequency range from 1 Hz to 85 kHz with the open circuit potential of 0.2 V under UV-vis light (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm) irradiation. The cyclic voltammograms were measured in the same solution in the three electrode cell as that of the EIS measurement. The cathodic polarization curves were obtained using the linear sweep voltammetry technique with a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) has been performed between 320 K and 673 K on an Autochem II 2920 analyser (Micromeritics) with a heating rate of 10 K min−1 and under a 30 mL min−1 flow for 5 vol% H2/He.
2.4. Photocatalytic activity
The photocatalytic reaction was performed in a quartz reactor (Fig. S1, ESI†). For each reaction, 15 mg of photocatalyst was added in 2 mL neat ethanol with an H+ ion concentration of 1 × 10−3 mol L−1 (externally fed with HCl). The reaction solution was evacuated by a mechanical pump several times to remove air completely prior to irradiation. A 300 W commercial Xe lamp (PLSSXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co., Ltd.), emitting UV-vis light (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm) with an energy output of 0.8 W cm−2 measured by a Thorlabs PM100 optical power and energy meter, was placed at a distance of approximate 7 cm from the reactor. The temperature of the reactor was kept at 298 K with an electronic fan. The photocatalytic reaction was typically performed for 12 h, and 1 mL of reactive gas was taken from the reactor with a syringe for analysis via gas chromatography (Shanghai Precision Scientific Instrument Co, Ltd, GC112A, TCD, N2 carrier). The remaining solution was analyzed using an Agilent 7820 Gas Chromatograph system comprising of an HP-FFAP analysis column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) and a flame-ionization detector. The chemical structures of the products were confirmed by comparison with standard chemicals using GC-MS (Agilent Technologies, GC6890N, MS 5973).
The conversion of alcohol and selectivity for 1,1-diethoxyethane were defined as follows:Conversion (%) = [(C0 − Cr)/C0] × 100Selectivity (%) = [Cp/(C0 − Cr)] × 100where C0 is the initial concentration of alcohol, Cr and Cp are the concentrations of the substrate alcohol and the corresponding product 1,1-diethoxyethane, respectively, at a certain time after the photocatalytic reaction. The experimental errors of conversion and selectivity are less than 2%. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for hydrogen generation is calculated according to following equation:  
The recycling test of the photocatalytic activity on the used catalyst was done as follows. The used photocatalyst was washed with ethanol three times and fully dried at 333 K in an oven after the reaction. Then, fresh reaction solution of 2 mL fresh ethanol with an H+ ion concentration of 1 × 10−3 mol L−1 (externally fed with HCl) was mixed with the used catalyst and a second photoactivity test was performed. This approach was extended to test the recyclability 7 times.
3. Results and discussion
Pd nanocubes (NCs) with sizes in the range of 7–17 nm were prepared via a facile, aqueous approach according to a literature procedure,47 and can be obtained by reducing K2PdCl4 in an aqueous environment at 353 K using ascorbic acid (AA) as a reductant, with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) serving as a stabilizer and halide species (Br− and/or Cl−) acting as capping agents. It is well known that the formation of Pd nanocrystals generally involves two stages:48 nucleation and growth (Fig. S2, ESI†). In a typical reaction, [PdCl4]2− ions are reduced to zero-valent Pd atoms, which subsequently aggregate to form nuclei (i.e., clusters). The reduction rate of the precursor plays a significant role in controlling the nucleation events which will affect the following growth process of the nanocrystals. Obviously, a high reduction rate will form more seeds in the nucleation stage, and therefore lead to the formation of nanocrystals with relatively small sizes when the amount of the precursor is kept the same. In this recipe, various amounts of halide species have been introduced into the reaction mixture to form complexes of [PdBr4]2− and [PdCl4]2−, through which the reduction rate of the Pd precursor can be well controlled, thus resulting in the formation of Pd NCs with desired sizes. Besides controlling the reduction rate of the Pd precursor, the introduced halide species can also serve as capping agents to preferentially and selectively adsorb on the (100) facets of the Pd nanocrystals, and thus favor the formation of (100) enclosed Pd NCs.48,49 Table S1 (ESI†) details the addition of different reactants and amounts for the preparation of various sized Pd NCs.

Fig. 1 shows typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the differently-size Pd NCs. When 600 mg of KBr is added into the reaction system, the size of the Pd NCs ranges from 16 to 18 nm as measured by the width (Fig. 1A). The size distribution histogram derived from the TEM image is plotted in Fig. 1B, suggesting that the mean size of the Pd NCs is ∼17 nm (width = 17 ± 0.58 nm). By reducing the amount of KBr (400 mg) added, Pd NCs of ∼14 nm (width = 14 ± 1.47 nm) in size can be synthesized, as exemplified in Fig. 1C and D. It is worthwhile to note that during the preparation of 14 and 17 nm Pd NCs, a color change of the reaction solution from reddish brown to black can be easily perceived, which suggests the formation of Pd NCs. The reaction rate can be roughly estimated from color change. For instance, the color change is detected at t = 3.5 min for the fabrication of 14 nm Pd NCs with 400 mg KBr added. Further increasing the amount of KBr to 600 mg will retard the color change and the color of the solution remains unchanged for 5 min. This can be attributed to the fact that the increase of KBr will slow down the reduction rate of the precursor due to the formation of complexes of [PdBr4]2−. Nevertheless, one cannot obtain sub-10 nm Pd NCs by simply decreasing the amount of KBr added, since there are not enough shape-directing ions (i.e., Br− ions) to cap the (100) facets of Pd.47 For the synthesis of sub-10 nm Pd NCs, the halide species of Cl− has been introduced into the reaction mixture because Cl− can also act as a capping agent for Pd nanocrystals while showing weak coordination ability for Pd2+.47Fig. 1E shows the TEM image of the product obtained with the addition of 5 mg of KBr and 185 mg of KCl, in which the average size of the Pd NCs is calculated to 7 nm (width = 7 ± 0.79 nm) (Fig. 1F). The UV-vis absorption spectra of Pd NCs with various sizes in Fig. S3 (ESI†) suggest that the three different sized Pd NCs smaller than 20 nm exhibit similar optical properties in the spectral range from 300 to 800 nm and no distinct surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Pd NCs can be detected due to the small imaginary part in their dielectric constants.43,44

Fig. 1 shows Pd NCs with sizes ranging from 7–17 nm which have been designed by introducing different amounts of halide ions into the reaction mixtures. The different-sized Pd NCs have then been immobilized onto TiO2 nanosheets (TNS) by an impregnation method. Fig. S4 (ESI†) illustrates the UV-vis absorption spectra of Pd NCs aqueous solution before and after dipping with TNS. It is clearly observed that the absorbance of the Pd NCs disappears after absorption, which suggests that the Pd NCs have completely assembled onto TNS, resulting in TNS–Pd NCs composites (denoted as TCs-x, where x represents the size of Pd NCs). The morphology information and microscopic structure of the TNS and TNS–Pd composites are examined by TEM. The TEM images of TNS in Fig. S5 (ESI†) show that TNS with well-defined sheet-shaped structures have been successfully synthesized and the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm confirms the anatase phase of TNS. Fig. S6 (ESI†) displays the typical TEM and HRTEM images of TNS–Pd nanoparticles composites (TPs), in which the Pd nanoparticles (NPs) of ca. 7 nm have been well decorated onto the anatase TNS. The clear lattice fringes of 0.35 nm and 0.2 nm in Fig. S6B (ESI†) correspond to the TiO2 (101) and Pd (002) crystal facets, respectively. The TEM images in Fig. 2A–C confirm the immobilization of different-sized Pd NCs onto the TNS. The sizes of the Pd NCs in the composites of TCs-7, TCs-14 and TCs-17 are measured to be ca. 7 nm, 14 nm and 17 nm, respectively, which agrees with the sizes calculated in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the HRTEM images of the TCs-x composites in Fig. 2D–F display the unique lattice fringes of the components. Fringes with lattice spacing of 0.35 nm exhibited in Fig. 2D and G correspond to the (101) planes of TNS, as modeled in Fig. 2J. In addition, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of the selected area (marked by the green frame) shown in the inset of Fig. 2D further authenticates the anatase TiO2. The enlarged inset in Fig. 2D displays the lattice fringes of the Pd NCs and the spacing of which is measured to be 0.2 nm, corresponding to the (200) crystal planes of metallic Pd (Fig. 2H and I).

Inset in (D) is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of the area marked by the green rectangular box. 

Fig. 3A displays the XRD patterns of the TNS, TPs and TCs-x composites with various sized Pd NCs. All of the identified peaks of the samples are perfectly in accordance with anatase TiO2 (JCPDS Card no. 21-1272). The average crystallite sizes of TiO2 in different samples estimated from the Debye–Scherrer formula are similar, as presented in Table S2 (ESI†). Moreover, no typical diffraction peaks assigned to Pd NCs have been detected, which could be ascribed to the low number of Pd NCs (i.e., 1%) which are evenly distributed in the TCs-x composites. Raman spectroscopy, with the capability of elucidating the structural complexity as peaks from each material that are clearly separated in frequency, has been employed to further distinguish the phase composition of those photocatalysts, as illustrated in Fig. 3B. It is observed that the vibration peaks located at 144 (Eg), 199 (Eg), 394 (B1g), 514 (A1g), and 636 cm−1 (Eg) correspond to the anatase TiO2 vibration mode,50–52 which suggests that the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles are the predominant species, in agreement with the XRD results. Notably, compared with the lowest frequency peak at 146 cm−1 of the sample TNS, a shift of the Raman peak towards a high wavenumber for the TPs and TCs-x composites can be clearly seen, implying that the symmetric stretching vibration of O–Ti–O in TiO2 has been destroyed to some extent due to the deposition of Pd NPs and Pd NCs.50 This peak shift can be attributed to the introduction of metal Pd which shows a strong interaction with oxygen in TiO2.53 The influence of metal Pd on the structure of TiO2 can be further evidenced by the Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The FT-IR spectra of the samples, as presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†), reveal that the characteristic peak at approximately 732 cm−1, resulting from the characteristic stretching vibration of the Ti–O–Ti network in TiO2,54 gradually moves to the location of 709 cm−1 for the TNS–Pd composites, demonstrating the interaction between metal Pd and the TiO2 structure. To precisely confirm the surface valence state of the elements in the samples of TNS and TCs-7 composites, XPS analysis has been performed. As observed in Fig. 3D, for the sample of TNS, two typical peaks of Ti 2p located at approximately 458.9 and 464.5 eV are assigned to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively.55,56 Interestingly, after the decoration of the Pd NCs, the peaks of Ti 2p over the TCs-7 composites slightly shift toward a higher binding energy (459.2 eV for the Ti 2p3/2 and 464.8 eV for the Ti 2p1/2) compared to blank TNS. A similar phenomenon can be observed in the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3E), among which the binding energies of 529.9 and 531.8 eV for the O 1s of TCs-7 (ref. 57 and 58) are higher than that of TNS. Additionally, in the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Pd 3d (Fig. 3F), two strong peaks with binding energies of 334.7 and 339.9 eV correspond to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 in metallic Pd.59,60 Compared to the binding energy of bulk Pd (335.1 eV for Pd 3d5/2 and 340.3 eV for Pd 3d3/2), a slightly negative change of 0.4 eV is observed, which would be attributed to the fact that the oxygen in TiO2 with high local electron density can donate lone pair electrons to the empty d orbitals of the Pd atoms, thereby inducing alterations of the chemical state or coordinated environment in these elements. The above-mentioned XPS results further convince the successful incorporation of metallic Pd and TNS, and the presence of the interaction between the TNS and Pd crystals, which is in agreement with the Raman and FT-IR analyses.

To investigate the optical properties of the samples, a comparison of the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of TNS and TNS–Pd composites is illustrated in Fig. 3C. With regard to all the samples, an analogous light absorption fingerprint appears around 400 nm, which can be accounted for by the intrinsic band gap absorption of pure anatase TiO2 and is primarily assigned to the electron promotion of TiO2 from the valence band (mainly formed by 2p orbitals of the oxide anions) to the conduction band (mainly formed by 3d t2g orbitals of the Ti4+ cations).34,61 Notably, the increased light absorption intensity in the visible light region for the TNS–Pd composites, as validated by the color changing from white to dark grey (Fig. S8, ESI†), mainly originated from the light scattering of the introduced Pd nanocrystals.62 It is also interesting to observe that in both the UV and visible region, the optical property of the as prepared TNS–Pd composites is similar even though different kinds of Pd, including Pd NPs and Pd NCs with various sizes, have been introduced into the composites. Additionally, the plots obtained via the transformation based on the Kubelka–Munk function versus the energy of light in Fig. S9 (ESI†) illustrate that the estimated band gap value of the TNS–Pd composites is the same as that of TNS (3.2 eV). The similarity in DRS results indicates that there is no significant difference in the light absorption properties for the TNS–Pd composites prepared with different-sized Pd NCs and Pd NPs.
The photocatalytic performance of TiO2 nanosheets (TNS) and TNS–Pd composites has been evaluated by the dual-function photocatalytic system toward H2 evolution along with the simultaneous conversion of ethanol into value-added acetals (i.e., 1,1-diethoxyethane, DEE) in ethanol media under UV-vis light irradiation (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm) (Fig. 4A). Different amounts of 7 nm Pd nanocubes (Pd NCs-7) have been introduced into TNS to investigate the optimum weight of Pd to improve the photoactivity of TNS, as exemplified in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The photocatalytic H2 production shows a tendency to increase with increasing Pd NCs-7 content and achieves a maximum value at the weight content of 1%, suggesting that a synergistic interaction between TNS and Pd NCs is required to optimally enhance the photoactivity of TNS. Fig. 4B displays the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate over TNS, TNS–1% Pd nanoparticles (TPs) and TNS–1% Pd NCs composites (denoted as TCs-x, where x represents the size of Pd NCs). The H2 evolution rate of 0.1 mmol g−1 h−1 indicates the low activity for the bare TNS photocatalyst. The catalytic activity for H2 generation can be significantly enhanced by decorating Pd NCs as co-catalyst. For instance, the H2 evolution rate of the TCs-7 composites is demonstrated to be 51.5 mmol g−1 h−1, around 515 times higher than that of blank TNS. In addition, it is noteworthy that the size of Pd NCs plays a pivotal role in tuning the photocatalytic H2 generation over the TCs-x composites. As delineated in Fig. 4B, the H2 evolution rates over TCs-14 and TCs-17 are demonstrated to be 46.2 mmol g−1 h−1 and 33.1 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively, which are lower than that of TCs-7 composites, revealing that the Pd NCs with smaller size are more favorable for H2 generation than the Pd NCs with larger particle size. A moderate apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 5.3% has been obtained for the TCs-7 composites (Fig. S11, ESI†) under UV light (λ = 365 ± 15 nm) irradiation. Moreover, the rate of H2 generation over the TPs composites has also been tested under identical reaction conditions. The results show that the H2 generation rate over TCs-x samples is higher than that of TPs composites (15.3 mmol g−1 h−1) with the same amount of Pd (i.e., 1%), which implies that the geometry of Pd can clearly affect the catalytic efficiency of the TNS–Pd composites and that Pd NCs are more beneficial than Pd NPs for enhancing the photoactivity of TNS toward H2 generation under light illumination.

Reaction conditions: 15 mg sample in 2 mL ethanol with H+ ion concentration of 1 × 10−3 mol L−1, UV-vis light (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm), reaction time: 12 h, reaction temperature, 298 K. 
During the H2 evolution process, the ethanol acts as both solvent and reactant can be converted into value-added 1,1-diethoxyethane (DEE) by photoinduced holes. The chemical structures of the liquid products have been identified by comparison with standard chemicals using GC-MS, as shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), which reveals that the main products in the liquid phase are DEE and acetaldehyde. Fig. 4C and D reveal that the DEE formation rate over bare TNS is 0.8 mmol g−1 h−1 with an ethanol conversion of 0.1%, suggesting relatively poor activity of the TNS photocatalyst. Notably, the loading of Pd NCs as co-catalyst onto TNS obviously improves the activity for DEE production. For example, the production rate of DEE over TCs-17 composites can reach up to 5.2 mmol g−1 h−1 with an ethanol conversion of 8.4%. Furthermore, the activity of the TCs-x composites shows a tendency to increase as the size of Pd NCs decreases, and the DEE formation rate of 7.7 mmol g−1 h−1 with 12.5% ethanol conversion over the TCs-7 composites can be monitored. The tendency for photocatalytic DEE generation over the TCs-x composites is in accordance with that of H2 evolution as mentioned above (Fig. 4B). It is clear that all of the TCs-x samples show better photoactivity towards DEE formation than the TPs composites (2.7 mmol g−1 h−1), which confirms the geometry effect of Pd on the photocatalytic efficiency of Pd-based semiconductor composites. The turnover number (TON), defined as the number of the reactant molecules which are converted into products while the weight content of the catalyst is 1 g, has been estimated to evaluate the catalytic efficiency. As depicted in Fig. 4E, the TON of TCs-7 composites is estimated to be 1.7 × 1023 molecules g−1, which is obviously higher than that of TNS (1.8 × 1022 molecules g−1), confirming that the decoration of Pd NCs-7 could boost the photoactivity of TNS towards DEE formation. More significantly, the primary product for ethanol oxidization over these TNS and TNS–Pd composite photocatalysts is proven to be DEE with a high selectivity (>92%), as displayed in Fig. 4C.
To understand the origin of the photoactivity enhancement of the TCs-x composites towards merging H2 evolution and DEE production compared to that of bare TNS and TPs, we probe the possible reasons on the basis of theoretical and experimental analyses. It has been well documented that the Schottky barrier caused by the direct contact of a noble metal with a semiconductor photocatalyst can act as a sink for the photoinduced electrons and inhibit the back-flow of electrons from metal to semiconductor, thus preventing the recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs.33,63–65 In our case, the TNS–Pd composites exhibit significantly higher photoactivity than blank TNS, which can be ascribed to the formation of an appropriate height of Schottky barrier (1.32 eV) between metal Pd and semiconductor TiO2,66,67 as depicted in Fig. S13 (ESI†). Since the majority of photoexcited electrons can be blocked by the Schottky barrier, the photoinduced electron–hole pairs in TiO2 can survive and then contribute to photoredox reactions, thus leading to high photoactivity towards simultaneous H2 evolution and DEE formation over the TNS–Pd composites. Notably, the photocatalytic activity of H2 evolution observed for the TCs-x composites is much better than that of TPs composites, which may be attributed to the geometry effect of metal Pd, thus affecting the activation energy for H2 production.39 Moreover, size-controlled photocatalytic efficiency over TCs-x composites has also been observed, in which the TCs-7 samples with 7 nm Pd NCs exhibit the best photocatalytic performance among these three TCs-x composites. The enhanced photoactivity can be explained by the following factors: (i) small Pd NCs with abundant corner and edge atoms could facilitate the separation of charge carriers and elongate the lifetime of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs efficiently;68 (ii) Pd NCs with smaller sizes possess a larger number of surface Pd atoms, as calculated in Table S3 (ESI†), which can provide more active sites to participate in the photocatalytic reactions.68,69 The following comparative analyses of the photo-electrochemical and photoluminescence spectra over the TNS, TPs and TCs-x composites have experimentally testified the above theoretical analyses.

Fig. 5A shows the cyclic voltammograms (CV) of TNS and TNS–Pd composites with obvious anodic and cathodic peaks for each sample. Since the preparation of the electrodes and electrolyte are identical for the CV curve measurement, the current density of the electrodes is related to the electron transfer rate of the electrode materials.70–72 The fact that the current density obtained over the TCs-x composite electrodes is larger than over TPs and bare TNS indicates the important acceleration effect of Pd NCs on promoting the separation of electron–hole pairs generated from the band gap photoexcitation of TNS under light irradiation. In addition, TCs-7 electrode shows a higher current density than the TCs-14 and TCs-17 composites, suggesting the effective transport of charge carriers in the TCs-7 sample. To gain insight into the charge transfer process on the electrode and at the contact interface between electrode and electrolyte, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots of different samples have been measured,73–82 and displayed in Fig. 5B. It can be evidently seen that the five electrodes all show semicircles at high frequencies. The Nyquist diagram of TCs-7 composite electrode possesses the most depressed semicircle at high frequency among these TCs-x composites electrodes, which reveals a more efficient charge transfer between the electrode and electrolyte solution over TCs-7 than for the TCs-x composites with large Pd NCs (i.e., 14 nm and 17 nm).62,73 Furthermore, the arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plots over TCs-x composites being smaller than the TPs electrode implies the shape-dependent ability of charge carrier transfer over metal Pd, which is consistent with the observation in CV measurements. Fig. 5C displays the polarization curves of the pure TNS and TNS–Pd composites, from which it can be seen that the decoration of Pd onto the TNS obviously enhances the current density at a similar potential range, suggesting that metal Pd can efficiently promote the reduction of water to H2.25 A current density improvement can be observed for TCs-x electrodes as compared to the TPs electrode, which is ascribed to the high electronic conductivity of Pd NCs to efficiently increase the electrical conductivity of those systems. Moreover, the size-dependent current density over the TCs-x composites, in which the current density gradually increases with the decreasing size of Pd NCs, shows that smaller Pd NCs can provide more active sites for catalytic redox reactions.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, which is often employed to study the recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs and the fate of charge carriers,62,74,83,84 has been performed. As depicted in Fig. 5D, all of the samples show PL signals with similar curves. Notably, after the decoration of metal Pd, the PL intensity of the TNS–Pd composites diminishes compared to that of pure TNS, which is attributed to the fact that metal Pd can act as a sink to trap or shuttle the photogenerated electrons from TNS, thus retarding the undesirable recombination process of the electron–hole pairs,34 as depicted in Fig. S14 (ESI†). Among the prepared samples, the TCs-7 composite has the highest quenching of PL intensity, corresponding to the most efficiently suppressed recombination of electron–hole pairs. The time-resolved PL spectroscopy has been employed to reveal the lifetime of charge carriers in the samples. As shown in Fig. S15 and Table S4 (ESI†), the average lifetime of the samples increases in the order of TNS < TPs < TCs-7, which can be explained by the geometry effect of Pd NCs to efficiently expedite the migration of charge carriers and hinder the electron–hole recombination, thus elongating the lifetime of charge carriers (Fig. 5E). The photo-electrochemical and PL experiments together confirm that the Pd NCs with high electronic conductivity can boost the separation and transfer of the photogenerated electrons and eventually result in the higher photocatalytic efficiency of TCs-x than TNS and TPs toward simultaneous H2 evolution and DEE formation under UV-vis light illumination.
The Sabatier principle85 suggests that excellent catalytic performance can be achieved when the catalyst can bind the reaction intermediates strongly and allow for product desorption smoothly. Since metal Pd generally shows strong hydrogen adsorption which may hinder the release of H2 from the catalyst,86–88 we move to use temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to elucidate the desorption of the generated H2 from the TPs and TCs-x photocatalysts (Fig. S16, ESI†). For the TCs-x composites, all of the distinct desorption peaks are observed below 553 K and the hydrogen desorption temperature for the TCs-x composites increases as the size of Pd NCs increase. More specifically, the position of the major peak is 522 K for the TCs-7 sample, while the peak is found to be located at 543 K and 553 K for the TCs-14 and TCs-17 composites, respectively. The desorption peak at high temperature indicates the strong hydrogen adsorption ability, which may hamper the release the hydrogen from the active sites of the catalyst.87 The TPD profile shows a broadened hydrogen desorption peak for the sample of TPs and an obvious desorption peak located at above 614 K can be also observed, which elucidates the strongest adsorption affinity between Pd NPs and the hydrogen molecules among those photocatalysts, corresponding to the relatively poor H2 production activity over the TPs compared to the TCs-x samples. Our observation is consistent with the previous work reported by Kumacheva and co-workers,87 who have experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the (100) planes enclosed Pd NCs have a lower hydrogen desorption activation energy than Pd NPs, which is beneficial for the desorption of hydrogen from the surface of Pd NCs. Thus, we can conclude that the 7 nm Pd NCs not only facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons (Fig. 5), but also favor the desorption of H2 from the surface of the TCs-7 photocatalysts (Fig. S16, ESI†), which synergistically promotes the catalytic efficiency toward H2 evolution under light illumination.
The photocatalytic stability and reusability of TCs-7 have been investigated via recycling experiments. As displayed in Fig. 6A–C, the TCs-7 photocatalysts show no apparent activity loss for up to 84 h over seven successive cycles, indicating that the TCs-7 composites are able to serve as stable photocatalysts under the present reaction conditions. To learn whether there is a change in the composition of the sample after reactions, the fresh and used TCs-7 catalysts have been characterized by XRD (Fig. 6D). The used TCs-7 sample has identical XRD patterns compared to the fresh TCs-7 photocatalyst, suggesting that no significant changes occurred in the bulk phase composition and confirming the photostability of the TCs-7 sample. Aiming to explore the underlying photocatalytic mechanism of H2 production and DEE formation over the TCs-7 composites in-depth, we have performed a series of blank or controlled experiments with the addition of various amounts of concentrated HCl into the reaction system. The initial blank experiments show that no H2 gas and DEE can be detected without catalysts and/or light, demonstrating that the reaction is really driven by a photocatalytic process. In addition, light irradiation intensity control experiments have also been performed, as illustrated in Fig. 6E and F. Obviously, the photoactivity for H2 evolution and DEE production obtained over TCs-7 is linearly dependent on the light intensity. By reducing the irradiation intensity from 0.8 to 0.36 and 0.23 W cm−2, the conversion of ethanol decreases from 12.5% to 9.7% and 7.5%, respectively, which further confirms that the reaction is photocatalytically driven by light irradiation. Controlled experiments by varying the addition of HCl to investigate the effect of the concentration of H+ ions on the photocatalytic efficiency of TCs-7 composites have been conducted and are presented in Fig. S17 and Table S5 (ESI†). The externally fed H+ ion shows significant influence on the photoactivity of the TCs-7 composites. The reaction system achieves a 6-fold improvement of the yield of DEE with the introduction of an H+ ion concentration of 0.5 × 10−3 mol L−1, compared to a system without HCl. It is noteworthy that the selectivity of DEE can be significantly enhanced from 22.5% to 94.7% by introducing HCl, validating the decisive role of the H+ ion for DEE production. The photocatalytic H2 production and conversion of ethanol over TCs-7 composites shows a tendency to increase with the increase in H+ ion concentration and achieves a maximum value at an H+ ion concentration of 1 × 10−3 mol L−1. However, it should be noted that a further increase in the concentration of H+ ions in the reaction system leads to deterioration of the photoactivity performance, which may be due to the fact that a high concentration of H+ ions could retard the dehydrogenation process of ethanol and impede the formation of the intermediate acetaldehyde, thus leading to the low photocatalytic activity toward H2 evolution and DEE production. Such acid-dependent catalytic performance can be explained by the acid-catalyzed acetalation reaction.29 According to previous reports,29,30 the photocatalytic production of DEE from ethanol generally involves two steps, i.e., the photogenerated hole induced dehydrogenation process of ethanol to form the intermediate acetaldehyde in situ and the acid-catalytic acetalation reaction between acetaldehyde and the unreacted ethanol. The introduction of H+ ions can accelerate the condensation of the acetaldehydes and alcohols into DEE, thus resulting in the high yield and selectivity of DEE.

Reaction conditions: 15 mg sample in 2 mL ethanol with H+ ion concentration of 1 × 10−3 mol L−1, UV-Vis light (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm), reaction time: 12 h, reaction temperature, 298 K. 
On the basis of the above theoretical and experimental analyses, a tentative reaction mechanism for merging of H2 evolution and conversion of ethanol into value-added 1,1-diethoxyethane (DEE) over TCs-x composites can be proposed as follows (Fig. 7). Upon light illumination (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm), the electron–hole pairs are generated from TNS and the electrons are localized from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to the deposited Pd NCs, leaving holes in the valence band (VB) of TiO2. The adsorbed ethanol is deprotonated to form alkoxide anions (A), and then interacts with holes (B), affording the corresponding carbon radicals and H+ ions. The carbon radicals further react with the photogenerated holes to produce acetaldehydes (C). Subsequently, the as-formed acetaldehydes could condense with the remaining alcohols into acetals (i.e., DEE) via an acid-catalytic acetalation reaction (D).30 At the same time, the photogenerated electrons accumulated in the Pd NCs due to the presence of Schottky barrier will react with the H+ ions and convert into useful H2 gas (E), as illustrated in Fig. 7.

4. Conclusions
To sum up, geometry- and size-controlled sub-20 nm Pd NCs have been decorated onto 2D TNS to fundamentally elucidate the morphological characteristics of metal Pd on the photocatalytic efficiency of Pd-based semiconductor composites. The photoactivity results evaluated by the dual-function photocatalytic system for simultaneous H2 evolution and DEE production suggest that the activation energy for H2 generation and adsorption affinity between Pd and hydrogen molecule can be modulated by the geometry difference between Pd NCs and Pd NPs, thereby resulting in higher activity for TCs-x composites compared to the TPs photocatalysts. Additionally, the size-sensitive photocatalytic performance over the TCs-x composites has also been identified and the activity of the samples increases with decreasing size of Pd NCs from 17 to 7 nm, which is predominantly attributed to more efficient capability of small Pd NCs to boost the separation and transportation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. This work not only fundamentally elucidates the relationship between the morphological characteristics of metal Pd and photoactivity of Pd-based semiconductor composites, but also supplies a dual-purpose sustainable approach for simultaneous H2 evolution and organic synthesis of fine chemicals.

 	Fig. 1  TEM images of Pd NCs with sizes of 17 nm (A), 14 nm (C) and 7 nm (E); the corresponding histograms of particle size distribution (B, D and F). Note: the scale bar in (C) is 50 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  TEM and HRTEM images of TCs-7 (A and D), TCs-14 (B and E) and TCs-17 (C and F) (the insets of A–C are the corresponding model illustrations of the TCs-x composites with different-sized Pd NCs); intensity profiles (G and H) along the yellow lines in (D); the crystal model of Pd (200) (I) and TiO2 (101) (J). Inset in (D) is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of the area marked by the green rectangular box.	 

 	Fig. 3  XRD patterns (A), Raman spectra (B) and DRS spectra (C) of the TNS and TNS–Pd composites; typical high-resolution XPS spectra of the core levels of Ti 2p (D), O 1s (E) and Pd 3d (F) in the TCs-7 composites.	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of simultaneous H2 evolution and DEE production (A); photocatalytic H2 evolution (B); ethanol conversion and DEE selectivity (C); yield of DEE and acetaldehyde (D) over TNS and TNS–Pd composites and calculated TON (E) over TNS and TCs-7 composites. Reaction conditions: 15 mg sample in 2 mL ethanol with H+ ion concentration of 1 × 10−3 mol L−1, UV-vis light (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm), reaction time: 12 h, reaction temperature, 298 K.	 

 	Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammograms (A), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots (B), polarization curves (C) and PL emission spectra (D) of the samples of TNS and TNS–Pd composites; scheme illustrating the photogenerated electron transport pathways between TiO2 and metal Pd (including NPs and NCs) (E).	 

 	Fig. 6  Recycling photocatalytic H2 evolution (A); ethanol conversion and DEE selectivity (B); yield of DEE and acetaldehyde (C) over the TCs-7 composites; XRD patterns of fresh and used TCs-7 composites (D); the H2 evolution (E) and ethanol conversion (F) obtained over TCs-7 composites as a function of light intensity. Reaction conditions: 15 mg sample in 2 mL ethanol with H+ ion concentration of 1 × 10−3 mol L−1, UV-Vis light (300 nm ≤ λ ≤ 800 nm), reaction time: 12 h, reaction temperature, 298 K.
