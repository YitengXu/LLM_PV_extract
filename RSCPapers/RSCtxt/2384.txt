    , Accepted 4th January 2023First published on 6th January 2023AbstractNon-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) not only bring rapid efficiency progress to organic solar cells (OSCs) but have also generated scientific interest in re-evaluating the photocharge generation route via spontaneous or heterojunction-assisted charge separation. Herein, we propose the addition of n-dopants as a strategy to optimize the utilization of spontaneously formed photocharges in NFAs and construct ultralow donor-content dilute bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices to validate the dopant's roles. N-dopants enhance the transport length of spontaneously formed photocharges over twofold and alleviate the bimolecular recombination with balanced carrier mobility during charge extraction. This improves the photocurrent of ultralow donor-content dilute BHJ devices by over 2.4 times. Moreover, these benefits are successfully conducted to the BHJ devices, and enhancement of conversion efficiencies is observed in both the 100 nm and 400 nm thick OSCs. Our results provide a feasible way to optimize the intrinsic photocharges in NFAs and renew the possibility of efficient single-component OSCs as inorganic photovoltaic techniques.

Broader context
The photo-excited states of organic semiconductors can be categorized into exciton, excimer, and intramolecular/intermolecular polaron pair. Theoretically, the polaron pair transforms into free carriers more efficiently than the exciton due to the larger extent of delocalization, which potentially produces higher power conversion efficiency in organic solar cells. Though the polaron pairs have been widely observed in conjugated polymers and small molecules, the low yield and short lifetime limit their contribution to the photovoltaic performance. During the past years, the emergence of non-fullerene small molecular acceptors brings a rapid conversion efficiency progress with varying photocharge generation routes. Taking the state-of-the-art Y6 as an example, the photocharges spontaneously form in neat Y6 at high yield without the assistance of the donor/acceptor heterojunction. The spontaneous photocharges then separate at the heterojunction without passing by the intermediate charge-transfer state. The alternative route avoids the extra energy loss and loosens the fine requirement on the hierarchical morphology of the active layer, which potentially overcomes the intrinsic limits on organic solar cells comparing with other photovoltaic techniques. However, to efficiently utilize the spontaneous photocharges, severe bimolecular recombination has to be alleviated before their spatial separation in distinct transporting pathways and in the following extraction process. Herein, we propose the addition of n-dopants as a solution to the above problem. Calculation predicts that n-dopant addition can reduce the exciton binding energy and form type II heterogeneity in Y6, which facilitate the spontaneous photocharge formation and suppress the occurrence of bimolecular recombination. The roles of n-dopant on the spontaneous photocharge in Y6 are systematically examined in the dilute heterojunction device with an ultralow donor content and neat Y6 devices. Step further, we investigated if the n-dopant is beneficial to a high-efficiency device with a 400 nm thick active layer, an average 10% enhancement of conversion efficiency promises it a feasible strategy on the development of commercial organic solar cells with printing manufacture procedure. Besides performance improvement, our findings open up the potential to think beyond the recognized heterojunction concept in organic photovoltaics and design one-component devices as other photovoltaic techniques. Our findings also provide a new mechanism view for the working principle of electric dopant-included organic solar cells.

Introduction
OSCs promise renewable energy harvesting applications in wearable electronics and power-generating windows at a low cost. Organic semiconductors in these devices are molecular solids, which give rise to strong electron–phonon coupling due to the weak joint interactions and low dielectric permittivity. Therefore, the excited states after irradiation in organic semiconductors are Coulomb-bounded electron–hole pairs named Frenkel excitons (EXs). As a result, OSCs are a type of excitonic photovoltaic devices that produce photocharges at the electron-donor/-acceptor (D/A) heterojunction driven by local electric potential offset. For efficient utilization of the Frenkel exciton, its diffusion length has to be taken into consideration, which restricts the component domain size of several tens of nanometers to form the BHJ structure. The requirements for a D/A heterojunction with fine BHJ morphology bring extra energy loss and fabricating complexity to OSCs compared with other photovoltaic techniques.1–4 Apparently, developing organic photovoltaic materials with the ability for the spontaneous production of photocharges is a promising strategy to overcome the intrinsic limit in OSCs and make it competitive in commercial applications.
During the past decade, ultrafast exciton delocalization and splitting in neat materials have been observed in conjugated polymers and organic molecules.5,6 Fundamentally, the uncertainty associated with the photon absorption process leads to initial exciton delocalization with a size of λ/4π.7 In addition, the excess energy of the photon is able to produce hot charge-transfer (CT) exciton, which undergoes activationless separation within 100 fs.8 The push–pull monomers of copolymers and small molecules stabilize the intramolecular exciton delocalization to form the polaron pair.9 Further inserting the π-conjugated spacers between them can enhance the yield of exciton splitting by reducing the intramolecular polaron pair recombination.10 The semi-crystalline structure with well-defined interfaces between the amorphous and crystalline domains facilitates intermolecular exciton splitting and polaron pair formation.11 Although it has been confirmed that these short-lived hot excitons in neat materials help overcome the large EX binding energy and set the time limit for charge separation at the D/A heterojunction,12 the low yield (<30%) compared with the total excited states restricts their contribution to the overall photocharges in OSCs.13
The rapid development of NFAs not only refreshes the power conversion efficiency (PCE) record of OSCs but also brings new photo-physical properties to the photovoltaic process. The state-of-the-art 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6, Fig. S1, ESI†) has remarkably small EX binding energy of −0.11 to 0.15 eV due to strong charge polarization effects,14 which leads to 60–90% of intrinsic photocharges in neat films following spatial separation at the D/A heterojunction without passing by the traditional CT state.15 For clarity, the altered route for photocharges in Y6-based OSCs is visualized in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The EX directly transforms to a charge-separation (CS) state in Y6 and then it spatially splits into free carriers (FC) in D and A phases (Route 2 in Fig. 1(b)), as compared to the traditional EX diffusion and splitting via an intermediate CT state (Route 1 in Fig. 1(a)). Although the revolution of photocharge generation route indicates that the D/A heterojunction might be no longer be necessary for efficient OSC just like its inorganic counterparts, severe bimolecular recombination due to the lack of respective extraction pathways is a major obstacle for achieving considerable PCE value in single-component OSC devices.15,16

(i) The ground state (GS) Y6 molecular transforms to EX when it absorbs photons; (ii) the EX then forms CT exciton and (iii) splits into FC at D/A heterojunction.

The Y6 EX (i) spontaneously forms CS (ii), which then spatially splits into FC via direct charge transfer in D and A phases (iii). 
Results and discussion
Since the bimolecular recombination coefficient in OSCs is related to the probability of opposite photocharges encounters, constructing the spatial isolation of holes and electrons by type II heterogeneity and balanced carrier mobility during extraction are key points to alleviate the photocharge loss. Many efforts have been devoted to proving that the addition of molecular dopants is a powerful tool to optimize the electronic structure and electrical properties of organic semiconductors.17–23 Considering the lower electron mobility compared to the hole mobility in Y6,18,24 herein, we adopt n-dopants to alleviate the bimolecular recombination in a neat film. We ran density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the energy-level shift of Y6 dimers after the addition of 4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine (N-DMBI, Fig. S1, ESI†), where the computational details are given in the ESI.† According to recent findings, we assume that N-DMBI reacts with Y6 via the initial hydride transfer,25–27 which may further transform to [Y6]˙− + [Y6-H]˙ to complete the doping process.27 In simplicity, we calculated the possible reaction on the Y6 dimer by merely considering the first reaction step with products of Y6–Y6, [Y6-Y6H]− and N-DMBI+ (Fig. 2(a)). The optimized three-dimensional structure demonstrates that the N-DMBI+ is located above the π–π stacked Y6 dimer (Fig. 2(b)). Under the optimal conformation, the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) of the Y6 dimer separately shift from 6.81 eV to 4.80 eV, and from 2.71 eV to 2.27 eV after the addition of N-DMBI. As a result, the energy-level offsets between the pristine and N-DMBI-added regimes enable the formation of type II heterogeneity in the Y6 film, which potentially alleviates the photocharge recombination (Fig. 2(c)). The obstacle for photocharge generation was evaluated by calculating the exciton binding energy (Eb), which is derived from the energy difference between the optical gap (Eog) and transport gap (Etg).28Eog is the excitation energy of the first singlet excited state and the Etg is the energy difference between IP and EA. The Eb of the Y6 dimer reduces from 1.79 eV to 1.01 eV after N-DMBI addition (Table S1, ESI†). Apparently, the lower Eb with type II heterogeneity formation is good for the utilization of spontaneous photocharges in neat Y6, and it is urgently required to figure it out in real devices.

To examine the n-dopant‘s benefits on the CS route in Y6, we adopt ultralow donor-content dilute BHJ structure at 1% concentration of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PM6, Fig. S1, ESI†) as a study model. Compared with the BHJ structure, we chose this model for three reasons: first, PM6 disperses uniformly in the Y6 matrix at ultralow content,29 which inhibits the n-dopant incorrectly located in PM6 aggregates; second, the dilute PM6 concentration in the blend film reduces the net contribution of electron-transfer to short-circuit current density (Jsc), which simplifies the photocharge generation process for mechanism study; finally, the products and dynamics of the excited states in ultralow donor content dilute BHJ film are similar to those in the neat Y6 film, which makes it an ideal test bed for the Route 2 contribution to device performance.15 We compared the morphologies of the pristine and N-DMBI added PM6:Y6 (0.01:1) films using grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements (Fig. 3(a), Fig. S2 and Table S2, ESI†) before looking into the n-dopant's influence on photovoltaic performance. The Y6 adopts a predominantly face-on orientation to the substrate in both the pristine and N-DMBI-added films. Fitting the diffraction peaks at 1.76 Å−1 to 1.77 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction separately provides the π–π stacking information before and after N-DMBI addition. The corresponding π–π distances of 3.56 Å and 3.55 Å with similar coherence lengths of 2.85 nm and 2.83 nm, demonstrate little influence of N-DMBI on the morphology of the dilute film. The coexistence of Routes 1 and 2 in the dilute BHJ film was confirmed from the temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectrum measurement,14,30,31 since CS in the neat Y6 domain and PM6/Y6 heterojunction shows distinct intensity-varying trends when cooling from room temperature (Fig. S3, ESI†). The enhanced integrated PL intensity with increased temperature demonstrates the spontaneous CS formation in the neat Y6 film (Fig. 3(b)). Whereas the integrated PL intensity starts decreasing at 220 K with high residual intensity at room temperature, indicating that besides a part of EXs quench at the PM6/Y6 heterojunction, the rest EXs undergo spontaneous CS in the Y6 domains of the ultralow PM6-content dilute BHJ film (Fig. 3(b)).15,32 As a result, we were able to evaluate the n-dopant‘s effects on the photocharge generation process of Y6 in the ultralow donor-content dilute BHJ samples (Fig. 3(c)).

(b) Plots of PL intensities of neat Y6 film and dilute PM6:Y6 (0.01:1) film as a function of temperature from 80 K to room temperature excited at 750 nm. (c) The scheme of the two routes of charge generation in 1% PM6-content dilutes BHJ film. Route 1: the EX diffuses to the D/A interface to form a CT state, and then splits into FC. Route 2: the EX spontaneously forms CS in Y6, and then moves towards the D/A interface to realize spatial isolation of electron and hole. The CS that fails to reach the D/A interface recombines in bimolecular mode. (d) The J–V curves of the control and 0.1 wt% N-DMBI added PM6:Y6 (0.01:1) devices. (e) The J–V curves of the control and 2 wt% N-DMBI added Y6 devices. (f) The EQEEL measurement of the control and 0.1 wt% N-DMBI added PM6:Y6 (0.01:1) devices. (g) Histograms of Jsc and PCE values in PM6:NFA (0.01:1) devices with optimum N-DMBI content. (h) Histograms of Jsc and PCE values in PM6:Y6 (0.01:1) devices with various n-dopants at the optimum content. 
We then fabricated photovoltaic devices to test the n-dopant‘s effects on photocharge generation. It is impressive that N-DMBI, on average, enhanced the Jsc by 2.4 times in 1% PM6-content dilute BHJ devices, from 2.02 mA cm−2 to 4.82 mA cm−2, with slight open-circuit voltage (Voc) increment from 0.844 V to 0.856 V (Fig. 3(d) and Table S3, ESI†). The significant Jsc variation is well supported by the integrated current densities from external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, where it increases from 2.09 mA cm−2 to 4.99 mA cm−2 (Fig. S4, ESI†). We also fabricated the single component (Y6) devices to verify this phenomenon, where we observed that all three photovoltaic parameters were improved when 0.5 wt% N-DMBI was added (Table S4, ESI†). The PCE, on average, increased from 0.07% to 0.11%, along with the improved Voc (from 0.841 V to 0.868 V), Jsc (from 0.25 mA cm−2 to 0.30 mA cm−2), and FF (from 32.3% to 34.4%). Further increasing the n-dopant content led to much higher Jsc but sacrificed Voc and FF. The winning PCE of 0.13% was obtained with the addition of 2 wt% N-DMBI, accompanied by 2.5 times higher Jsc of 0.62 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3(e) and Table S4, ESI†). Leaving the Jsc enhancement for later discussion, we estimated the energy loss to explain the slight Voc raise of the ultralow donor-content dilute BHJ device after doping. Noticing that the photovoltaic performance contribution in Route 2 did not pass via the CT state, we calculated EPVg (photovoltaic band-gap energy), VSQoc (the maximum voltage deduced by the Shockley–Queisser theory), and Vradoc (the Voc when only radiative recombination occurs) to evaluate the energy loss (Fig. S5, ESI†).33,34 We give a detailed description of the calculation of EPVg, VSQoc, and Vradoc in the ESI,† and the non-radiative voltage loss (ΔVnrad) is obtained from the electroluminescence EQE (EQEEL) (Fig. 3(f)). Based on the analysis of each value in Table S5 (ESI†), we conclude that the reduced ΔVnrad is responsible for the Voc raise. We emphasize that even the photocharges spontaneously form without the aid of the CT state at the D/A heterojunction; reducing the ΔVnrad is still crucial for device optimization.
We further extended our observations to other acceptor materials, such as L8-BO, BTP-eC9, ITIC, and IEICO (see their full names and chemical structures in Fig. S1, ESI†). The addition of N-DMBI is good for all material combinations in dilute BHJ devices with a PM6:NFA ratio of 0.01:1 (Fig. 3(g)). The L8-BO and BTP-eC9-based dilute devices exhibit relatively higher original Jsc and PCE than the ITIC and IEICO-based devices probably due to their higher FC yield.14 Addition of 0.05 wt% N-DMBI content largely increased the Jsc from 1.49 mA cm−2 to 2.22 mA cm−2, and from 2.10 mA cm−2 to 3.61 mA cm−2 in L8-BO and BTP-eC9-based dilute devices. Together with slightly higher Voc, the PCE values increase by 1.3 (from 0.70% to 0.91% for L8-BO) and 1.8 times (from 0.64% to 1.15% for BTP-eC9) correspondingly (Fig. S6a, b and Tables S6, S7, ESI†). As for ITIC-based 1% PM6-content dilute blend devices, 1.8 times higher average PCE (from 0.09% to 0.16%) mainly originating from the Jsc increment (from 0.38 mA cm−2 to 0.60 mA cm−2) was observed with the addition of 0.05 wt% N-DMBI (Fig. S6c and Table S8, ESI†). The most impressive PCE enhancement comes from IEICO-based dilute BHJ devices with the lowest initial performance. The large addition of 0.5 wt% N-DMBI synergistically helps Jsc increase from 0.14 mA cm−2 to 1.17 mA cm−2, and Voc increase from 0.526 V to 0.732 V, producing an overall PCE enhancement by 11.5 times from merely 0.02% to 0.23% (Fig. S6d and Table S9, ESI†).
The alteration of n-dopants retains the performance enhancement in the PM6 diluted devices, DMBI-BCZC (see the full name and chemical structure in Fig. S1, ESI†), which is a simple electron donor with sufficient strength to reduce Y6, and TBAI (see the full name and chemical structure in Fig. S1, ESI†), which may react through nucleophilic attack by iodine with follow-on reactions. Using a bulky dopant DMBI-BCZC, the PCE improves to 1.34% mainly due to the 2.1 times Jsc enhancement of 4.28 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3(h), Fig. S7 and Table S10, ESI†). The organic salt TBAI also exhibited a good Jsc (4.41 mA cm−2) enhancement by 2.2 times (Fig. 3(h), Fig. S7, and Table S10, ESI†). Based on the above studies, we are confident that the n-dopants generally boost photovoltaic performance by optimizing the non-fullerene acceptors.
Before discussing the fundamentals of Jsc enhancement, we have to confirm that it occurs in the photogeneration process. To exclude the effects of dopant on higher background charge density, we compared the dark J–V curves with and without N-DMBI added devices (Fig. S8, ESI†). The lower dark current demonstrates that it is the photocurrent rather than the dark current responsible for the Jsc enhancement. To further understand the n-dopant‘s effect on raised photogenerated Jsc, it is priority to clarify which of the photocharge generation routes contribute to its enhancement after n-dopant addition. Considering the high EX splitting efficiency at the PM6/Y6 heterojunction, scientists have attributed the success of this material pair to long exciton diffusion length (LEX).35,36 Therefore, we first extract the LEX by film thickness varying PL measurements.37–39 As shown in Fig. 4(a), the PL method detects the signals from emitted EXs that fail to arrive at the Y6/copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) heterojunction, and it was fitted by the following equation according to a previous report:  where PLY6/CuSCN is the integrated PL intensity of the Y6/CuSCN bilayer film, PLY6 is the integrated PL intensity of the neat Y6 film, and x0 is the film thickness of the Y6 layer (see details in the ESI†). We found that the LEX of Y6 maintained a constant of 11 nm after 0.1 wt% N-DMBI addition (Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S9, ESI†). The unchanged LEX implies that the photocharge generation via Route 1 is not responsible for the enhanced Jsc in the n-dopant addition case. To examine the photocharge generation via Route 2, we extracted the sum of the EX and CS states transport length (LEX+CS) by film thickness varying EQE measurements.40–42 As shown in Fig. 4(a), the EQE method detected the signals from the EX and CS states that successfully reached the Y6/CuSCN heterojunction, and it was extracted by the one-dimensional diffusion equation in the device structure of ITO/CuSCN/Y6/(2-(1,10-phenanthrolin-3-yl)naphth-6-yl)diphenylphosphine oxide (Phen-NaDPO)/Al (see details in ESI†):  where n(x) is the exciton density n at position x in the Y6 film, D is the diffusion coefficient, G(x) is the exciton generation profile at position x calculated by the transfer-matrix model (parameters for calculation are listed in Fig. S10 in the ESI† according to the previous report). With the boundary conditions of the complete exciton quenching at the Y6/CuSCN interface (n = 0) and the complete exciton reflection at the Y6/Phen-DPO interface (∂n/∂x = 0), we can obtain the general solution of D·n(x) with the unknown parameter LEX+CS, which is related to the photovoltaic EQE spectra according to:  where Jinc is the incident light current density, ηc is the exciton splitting and extraction efficiency at the electrode. The shapes of EQE spectra at various film thicknesses are influenced only by the value of LEX+CS, therefore the LEX+CS can be extracted by fitting the experimentally obtained normalized EQE spectra. Based on the EQE plots in Fig. S11 (ESI†), we obtained the LEX+CS at different exciting wavelengths from 600 nm to 800 nm (Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S12, ESI†). At all exciting wavelengths, the LEX+CS increases from 35 nm to 80 nm after the N-DMBI addition, which indicates that the enhanced utilization of CS states is the reason for better Jsc.

The PL measurement quantifies the EXs that are unable to diffuse to the Y6/CuSCN interface, which reflects the EX diffusion length. The EQE measurement quantifies the EXs and CS states that are able to arrive at the Y6/CuSCN interface, reflecting the total contribution of EXs and CS to transport length.

According to recent progress from Hodgkiss and Liu et al., severe bimolecular recombination dominates the performance loss in neat Y6 and ultralow donor-content dilute PM6/Y6 films.15,43 We next looked into the role of n-dopant on spontaneous photocharge bimolecular recombination in the framework of 1% PM6-content dilute BHJ devices. We assumed that the asymmetric composition of the dilute BHJ film leads to unbalanced carrier extraction ability, and severe bimolecular recombination occurs due to the formation of the space-charge region. The assumption is supported by exponentially fitting the Jsc ∝ Pβ (P represents the light-intensity) relationship on the double-logarithm scale. The coefficient β is 0.78 for the undoped dilute film, which is close to the value of 0.75 when the charge extraction is limited by the space-charge region.44 After the n-dopant addition, β increases to 0.84, suggesting that the space-charge region is partially compensated (Fig. 4(d)). Accompanying this, we find that the average hole mobility decreased from 2.67 ± 1.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.50 ± 0.59 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the average electron mobility increased from 0.87 ± 0.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.42 ± 0.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 4(e) and (f) and Table S11, ESI†). We ascribe the balanced mobility as the reason for n-dopant leading to the minimized space-charge region and suppressed bimolecular recombination. According to the hopping model, energy disorder (σ) plays a vital role in charge transport in organic semiconductors. This can be estimated from the slope of 0–0 peak (∼970 nm) vs. 1/T.45,46 In accordance with the activated diffusion model,45 two temperature regimes are observed. We find that the σ of Y6 was reduced in both regimes (Fig. S13, ESI†). The lower σ can be explained by the n-doping-induced electron transfer from N-DMBI to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of Y6. Since the LUMO of Y6 provides a transport energy level for electrons, we ascribe the lower σ of Y6 as the reason for better electron mobility.
To further correlate the enhanced CS state transport distance with the reduced photocharge recombination, we calculate the drift (LDr,CS) and diffusion (LDif,CS) lengths of the CS state in the ultralow donor-content dilute BHJ device. The LDr,CS can be deduced from the figure of merit (FoM) θ according to the following equation:47,48  where θ represents the ratio of recombination to extraction rates, q is the elemental charge, Vint is the internal voltage, μn and μp are the electron and hole mobilities, γ is the bimolecular recombination coefficient, and Jsat is the saturated photocurrent at a sufficient negative bias (Fig. S14, ESI†). Based on the measurements of the above parameters, the FOM θ decreases from 3.3 × 10−2 to 1.7 × 10−2 after N-DMBI addition, which produces longer LDr,CS from 358 nm to 596 nm (Fig. 4(g)). We further calculated the LDif,CS according to the FoM α by using the following equation:47,49  where α reflects the balance between photocharge recombination and extraction in transport-limited solar cells, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. The FOM α decreases from 3.0 to 2.2 after N-DMBI addition, and the LDif,CS correspondingly increases from 15.6 nm to 25.3 nm (Fig. 4(h)). Since the LEX+CS lies between LDr,CS and LDif,CS, and its over twofold increment is larger than any improvement of LDr,CS and LDif,CS; we believe that both factors contribute to the optimized photocharge extraction after the n-dopant addition. We argue that the significantly increased LDr,CS and LDif,CS cannot be solely explained by the charge mobility variation, and the formation of type II heterogeneity should play a vital role. The n-dopant bound Y6 possesses up-shifted IP and EA, forming a temporary reservoir for holes. The shallow hole reservoir isolates holes from electrons in the neat Y6 domains (Fig. 4(e) and (f)), thereby slowing down the bimolecular recombination rate.15,43
Having identified the roles of n-dopant in spontaneous photocharge generation and recombination in the model of an ultralow donor-content dilute BHJ device, we then explored its potential in high-efficiency BHJ devices. To guarantee the correct N-DMBI doping sites in Y6, the BHJ devices are fabricated via a sequential fabrication procedure, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The combination of N-DMBI and Y6 occurs in chloroform solution as per our previous finding.18 At normal BHJ film thickness of 100 nm, the addition of N-DMBI leads to the average PCE value increasing from 16.09% to 16.70%, deriving from the simultaneous improvements in Jsc from 25.62 mA cm−2 to 26.43 mA cm−2, and Voc from 0.823 V to 0.829 V (Fig. 5(b), Table 1 and Table S12, ESI†). The Jsc improvement is consistent with the integrated current density from the EQE curves in Fig. 5(c), where it increases from 24.37 mA cm−2 to 25.20 mA cm−2. We also fabricated the BHJ devices by coating the dopant-containing blend solution. The similar performance improvement shows the good applicability of the dopant addition method in the conventional single-step deposition process (Fig. S15 and Table S13, ESI†) To extend the significance of the n-dopant, we further investigated its effectiveness in thick-film devices. The thick film usually undergoes a longer morphology evolution time, which results in larger phase separation with higher crystallinity.50 This phenomenon is manifested as higher film roughness from 0.89 nm to 1.00 nm, as shown in the insets of Fig. 5(b) and (d), respectively, and a larger average surface height in Fig. S16 (ESI†). In addition, N-DMBI addition affects neither the values of surface roughness nor the average height of the blend film, demonstrating that the performance improvement is not from the morphology optimization. Beyond the 100 nm thin film, the addition of n-dopant works even better in thick films, which are vital for printing fabrication. In the 300 nm active layer devices, the PCE value increases from 13.31% to 14.19%, along with simultaneously improved Jsc (from 27.28 mA cm−2 to 27.90 mA cm−2) and Voc (from 0.796 V to 0.804 V) (Fig. S17 and Table S14, ESI†). With further increasing the active layer thickness to 400 nm, N-DMBI enhances the PCE value to a larger extent from 11.88% to 13.03% with thickness insensitive Jsc of 27.91 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5(d), Table 1 and Table S15, ESI†). The integrated current density from the EQE plot agrees well with the Jsc within a 5% deviation, where it increases from 25.26 mA cm−2 to 26.51 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5(e)). The promising results in thick devices demonstrate the inclusion of n-dopants as an applicable strategy in future commercial OSC manufacture.

Besides the PCE value, it is also important to evaluate the stability of the device. The strong quadrupole moment and long alkyl side chains promote the close packing of Y6 molecules.51 This confines the conformational change due to the photoisomerization of vinyl groups,52 therefore, Y6 demonstrates good photo-stability compared to other non-fullerene acceptors, such as ITIC. We measured the dark storage- and photo-stability of the photovoltaic cells. Since the pristine devices demonstrated poor stability in the conventional structure in comparison with that in the inverted structure (Fig. S18, ESI†), we adopted the latter form to evaluate the photovoltaic stability in the n-dopant added cells. After 300 h of dark storage in air, the PCE and Jsc of n-dopant-added devices retained over 95% of their initial values (Fig. S18a and b, ESI†). Meanwhile, the performances were still higher than those of the pristine cells. After soaking in one sunlight, the devices still showed good stability, where 90% of the initial PCE and Jsc were conserved after 300 h aging (Fig. S18c and d, ESI†). In accordance with our theoretical analysis, the addition of the n-dopant does not accelerate the performance decay in doped devices (Fig. S19, ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, we propose the addition of n-dopant as a powerful tool to optimize the utilization of spontaneously formed photocharges in NFA. The DFT calculations predict the dopant's roles as reduced Eb and alleviated bimolecular recombination via the formation of type II heterogeneity in the neat Y6 film. In order to validate the assumptions on n-dopant, we adopted ultralow donor-content dilute BHJ film with a low concentration of PM6 as a test bed. The transport length analysis on the thickness-varying PL and EQE spectra confirmed that the n-dopant actually favored the spontaneous photocharge in Y6 rather than the bound EX. Combining the prolonged LDr,CS and LDif,CS led to better charge extraction ability, the n-dopant addition produces an impressive Jsc increment over twofold in dilute BHJ devices. This phenomenon was also extended to other acceptor materials and n-dopants. With all these benefits, the n-dopant successfully improved the photovoltaic performance in the lab-used 100 nm thick and manufacture-applicable 400 nm thick BHJ devices without destroying the stability. This work clarifies the controversial role of molecular dopants in high-performed NFA OSC and invokes attention to rethinking the long-time accepted photo-physics in the organic photovoltaic process. The knowledge opens new space for PCE enhancement and inspires record-breaking cells when bringing it into the existing superior devices.3,4 The findings open up the potential to think beyond the recognized BHJ concept and guide the designing of efficient single-component OSC without excitonic limitations.

Broader context
The photo-excited states of organic semiconductors can be categorized into exciton, excimer, and intramolecular/intermolecular polaron pair. Theoretically, the polaron pair transforms into free carriers more efficiently than the exciton due to the larger extent of delocalization, which potentially produces higher power conversion efficiency in organic solar cells. Though the polaron pairs have been widely observed in conjugated polymers and small molecules, the low yield and short lifetime limit their contribution to the photovoltaic performance. During the past years, the emergence of non-fullerene small molecular acceptors brings a rapid conversion efficiency progress with varying photocharge generation routes. Taking the state-of-the-art Y6 as an example, the photocharges spontaneously form in neat Y6 at high yield without the assistance of the donor/acceptor heterojunction. The spontaneous photocharges then separate at the heterojunction without passing by the intermediate charge-transfer state. The alternative route avoids the extra energy loss and loosens the fine requirement on the hierarchical morphology of the active layer, which potentially overcomes the intrinsic limits on organic solar cells comparing with other photovoltaic techniques. However, to efficiently utilize the spontaneous photocharges, severe bimolecular recombination has to be alleviated before their spatial separation in distinct transporting pathways and in the following extraction process. Herein, we propose the addition of n-dopants as a solution to the above problem. Calculation predicts that n-dopant addition can reduce the exciton binding energy and form type II heterogeneity in Y6, which facilitate the spontaneous photocharge formation and suppress the occurrence of bimolecular recombination. The roles of n-dopant on the spontaneous photocharge in Y6 are systematically examined in the dilute heterojunction device with an ultralow donor content and neat Y6 devices. Step further, we investigated if the n-dopant is beneficial to a high-efficiency device with a 400 nm thick active layer, an average 10% enhancement of conversion efficiency promises it a feasible strategy on the development of commercial organic solar cells with printing manufacture procedure. Besides performance improvement, our findings open up the potential to think beyond the recognized heterojunction concept in organic photovoltaics and design one-component devices as other photovoltaic techniques. Our findings also provide a new mechanism view for the working principle of electric dopant-included organic solar cells.

 	Fig. 4  (a) Scheme of different signals obtained by PL and EQE measurements to evaluate the EX and CS transport lengths. The PL measurement quantifies the EXs that are unable to diffuse to the Y6/CuSCN interface, which reflects the EX diffusion length. The EQE measurement quantifies the EXs and CS states that are able to arrive at the Y6/CuSCN interface, reflecting the total contribution of EXs and CS to transport length. (b) LEX values from the thickness varying PL measurements of the pristine and 0.1 wt% N-DMBI added CuSCN/Y6 bilayer films. The excitation wavelength keeps at 785 nm. The experimental data (diamonds and circles) are fitted (solid lines) for all Y6 thicknesses. The inset is the sample structure of the bilayer films. (c) LEX+CS values from the thickness varying EQE measurements of the pristine and 0.1 wt% N-DMBI added CuSCN/Y6 bilayer devices. The excitation wavelength keeps at 700 nm. The experimental data (diamonds and circles) are fitted (solid lines) for all Y6 thicknesses. The inset is the device architecture of the bilayer devices. (d) Dependence of Jsc on the light intensity for the pristine and 0.1 wt% N-DMBI added PM6:Y6 (0.01:1) devices. (e) Hole-only current density and electron-only current density versus voltage curves of the pristine PM6:Y6 (0.01:1) devices. Inset is the average hole and electron mobility values. (f) Hole-only current density and electron-only current density versus voltage curves of 0.1 wt% N-DMBI added PM6:Y6 (0.01:1) devices. Inset is the average hole and electron mobility values. (g) Values of FoM θ and LDr,CS for the pristine and 0.1 wt% N-DMBI added PM6:Y6 (0.01:1) devices. (h) Values of FoM α and LDif,CS for the pristine and 0.1 wt% N-DMBI added PM6:Y6 (0.01:1) devices.	 

 		 

 		 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Scheme of the sequential fabrication procedure for OSCs. The PM6 is firstly deposited onto the substrate, then the N-DMBI/Y6 blend solution in chloroform was spin-coated.
