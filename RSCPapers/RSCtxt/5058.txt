    , Accepted 13th May 2011First published on 22nd June 2011AbstractA new and original method for the electrochemical growth of ZnO nanocrystalline porous layers and multiscale hierarchical structures is described. The structures are designed by simply playing with the growth conditions and without any use of template or additive in the aqueous deposition bath. Two types of hierarchical structures are described combining electrodeposited ZnO nanowire arrays and a nanoporous layer: nanowire arrays covered by a conformal nanoporous layer and nanowire arrays embedded in a nanoporous layer. The global performances of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated using the hierarchical structures are higher than those found for nanoparticulate sol–gel ZnO films and for the two basic electrodeposited structures. Films made of nanowires embedded in a nanocrystalline matrix show a maximum energy conversion efficiency of ∼4.1%. The wires play several important beneficial roles in the presented structures since they permit the electrodeposition of thick nanoporous ZnO films which immobilize a large amount of dye, they act as preferential electron pathways for efficient charge collection and, due to their size, they enhance the light trapping in the photoanode and hence increase the light diffusion length before its harvesting by the dye. Another interest of the proposed ZnO hierarchical structures is a synthesis as well as an applied post-growth thermal treatment performed below 150 °C in soft environments which are then perfectly compatible with lightweight plastic flexible and other fragile substrates.

Broader context

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are among the most promising environmentally friendly energy-conversion devices. The possibility of being fabricated by low-cost and easy-scalable solution processing techniques has driven the technology to the marketplace. The nanostructured wide bandgap film of oxide semiconductor is a key component of the devices. ZnO has promising opto-electronic properties to be used in the photoanodes of DSSCs. Advantages over the other semiconductors include an impressive variety of nanostructures varying from 1D-single-crystalline crystallites to complex designed hierarchical structures. ZnO can be also synthesized and processed at low temperature, especially by using electrochemical growth techniques which are then perfectly compatible with lightweight plastic flexible substrates. The use of hierarchical ZnO structures in the devices is an innovative concept that should permit the optimizing of the electronic transfer in the photoanode and the solar light harvesting by increasing the light pathway by scattering.

1. Introduction
Interest in the study of dye-sensitized nanocrystalline metal oxide solar cells (DSSCs) has grown considerably in recent years from both fundamental and applied viewpoints.1,2 Due to their simple fabrication and potential low production costs they can be regarded as attractive photovoltaic devices for mass production.3,4 To date, the most successful DSSCs have been produced using porous nanoparticulate TiO2 films combined with ruthenium polypyridine complex dyes.5,6 However, zinc oxide has recently emerged as a promising alternative semiconductor material to TiO2 with marked performance improvements of ZnO-based DSSCs achieved during the last few years.7–16ZnO is an n-type semiconductor combining a large bandgap of 3.37 eV at room temperature and an electron affinity similar to that of TiO2.17 The dynamic of the electron transfer process between the classical dyes and ZnO has been found in the subpicosecond range, a value comparable to the dye–TiO2 systems.18 Moreover, single-crystalline ZnO exhibits a good electron transport collection and a fast charge transfer due to its electron mobility higher by 2–3 orders of magnitude compared to TiO2.7,19 Such a fast electron transport should reduce recombination phenomena upon the charge transport process. Among the specific advantages of ZnO, one can also cite the facile growth of elongated and single-crystalline 1D hexagonal ZnO crystals for the facile direct electron transfer between the photoexcited dye and the back contact with reduced recombination losses.20,21 During the last decade an impressive variety of ZnO nanostructures have been synthesized and assembled as thin films by various growth methods. Among them, electrochemical deposition is simple and low-cost for the preparation of high quality ZnO.22,23 Conformal films can be easily produced by electrodeposition on substrates with a complicated shape and the technique allows the design of complex nanostructures by combining and adjusting the growth conditions.22–30

        ZnO single crystalline nanowires (NWs) are highly relevant 1D-nanostructures for efficient charge collection in DSSCs.15,20,21 However, even for dense arrays of very long wires, the global surface area developed by these structures is insufficient to permit a very high solar light collection by the sensitizer.31 Therefore, the growth of multiscale hierarchical structures has been proposed to increase significantly the quantity of dye immobilized in the photoanode and to ensure a fast charge collection.32–37 Interesting approaches have consisted in combining nanowires and nanoparticles32,37 or nanorods and nanoporous layers.35 Recently, dense nanoforest of hierarchical ZnO nanowires has been grown and a maximum conversion efficiency of 2.6% was achieved.36
In the present paper we describe a new and original method for the electrochemical growth of nanocrystalline porous layers and hierarchical structures. The synthesis is very simple, performed at room temperature in aqueous solutions and is additive-free and template-free. Consequently, the tricky final step consisting in the removal of a structure directing agent (SDA) co-deposited with ZnO such as a dye,10,11,27,35 a surfactant,38–40 a polymer41,42 and so on is avoided and no contamination by these components occurs upon the oxide matrix preparation. Because electrical charges are exchanged upon the oxide synthesis, the layer is well-conducting compared to sintered nanoparticulate films and is very well-contacted to the transparent oxide substrate. We show that hierarchical structures obtained by combining electrodeposited ZnO nanowires and the nanoporous layer are very interesting and give high efficiency solar cells. The global performances are higher than those reached with nanoparticulate ZnO films. In the presented structures, the wires play several beneficial roles: (i) they permit the growth of thick nanoporous ZnO films which immobilize a large quantity of dye (in the absence of wire, the electrodeposited film thickness remains below 800 nm); (ii) they act as preferential electron pathways for efficient charge collection and (iii), due to their size, they enhance the light trapping in the photoanode and hence increase the light diffusion length before its harvesting by the dye. We can also note that the proposed synthesis of the hierarchical structures as well as their post-growth thermal treatment are performed below 150 °C, in soft environments and are then perfectly compatible with lightweight plastic flexible and other fragile substrates.43 The hierarchical structure giving the highest conversion efficiency was made of electrodeposited ZnO wires embedded in a nanocrystalline porous ZnO matrix grown at room temperature.
2. Experimental section
2.1. 
          ZnO layer preparations and characterizations
The ZnO layers were prepared on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) coated glass (TEC-10). The substrates were carefully cleaned with soap, rinsed with deionized water prior to being sonicated for 5 min in ethanol and 5 min in acetone. The reference nanoparticulate films (hereafter designated as np-ZnO) were prepared by the doctor-blade technique as described in a previous reference.11Electrodeposition was carried out in a three-electrode cell. The counter-electrode was a platinum or a zinc wire44,45 and the reference electrode was a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) (with a potential at +0.25 V vs.NHE) placed in a separate compartment maintained at room temperature. The applied potential was −1.0 V vs.SCE. To ensure a deposition as homogeneous as possible, the substrate was fixed to a rotating electrode and the deposition was performed at a constant rotation speed of 300 rotations per minute (rpm).46 The deposition medium was prepared with MilliQ quality water (18.2 MΩ cm). 0.1 M KCl was used as the supporting salt. The bath was bubbled for 40 min with molecular oxygen prior to start the deposition and the bubbling was maintained upon the deposition process. The ZnO nanowire arrays were prepared at 85 °C using a bath containing ZnCl2 at a low concentration of 0.2 mM.44 The growth time was fixed at 150 min and the mean wire length was about 3 μm. The global charge exchanged upon the process was about 14C cm−2. The nanocrystalline films were prepared in similar conditions but at room temperature (25 °C), the ZnCl2 concentration being 5 mM.45 The substrates were either bare FTO or FTO covered with the array of ZnO NWs as described previously. The growth time was varied in a large extent, between 5 and 360 min.
The film thicknesses were measured with a Dektak 6M stylus profiler. The sample morphologies were examined with a high resolution Ultra 55 Zeiss FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. X-Ray diffraction spectra were recorded with a Siemens D5000 apparatus operated at 40 kV and 45 mA using the CuKα radiation with λ = 1.5406 Å and a rotating sample holder. The Raman spectra of the layers were measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRam IR system in a backscattering configuration. The 632.8 nm line of a He–Ne laser was used for off-resonance excitation with less than 4 mW power at the sample. The total transmission and total reflection of the layers were recorded with a Carry 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere.
2.2. Solar cells fabrication and characterization
The various ZnO films were dried at 150 °C for 1 h. Upon cooling, they were immersed for 1 hour in a solution containing 0.5 mM D149 dye (Chemicrea, Inc) and 1 mM of cholic acid in a mixture of 1:1 acetonitrile/tert-butanol.11,47 The counter electrode was a platinum plate. The liquid electrolyte composition was 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl,3-propylimidazolium iodide in acetonitrile. The sensitized ZnO electrode and the Pt-counter electrode were assembled as a sandwich-type cell and separated by a polymer foil. A drop of the electrolyte was introduced between the two electrodes by capillarity. The total active area was delineated by a dark mask of 0.126 cm2. The device was illuminated with a solar simulator (Abet Technology Sun 2000) equipped with an AM 1.5 global air mass filter. The power density was calibrated at 100 mW cm−2 by using a silicon solar cell reference. The J–V curves were recorded by a Keithley 2400 digital sourcemeter, using a 0.01 V s−1 voltage sweep rate. The IPCE curves were recorded with a home-made system using a Jobin Yvon monochromator and a calibrated powermeter. The action spectra were not corrected by the glass substrate reflectance/absorbance. The impedance spectra were measured at the open circuit voltage under 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination by a Solartron FRA1255 coupled with a PAR283 potentiostat. The AC signal was 10 mV and the frequency range was 100 kHz–0.1 Hz.
3. Results and discussion

Electrodeposition of ZnO is a versatile growth method and many various nanostructures can be easily designed by the technique. In the present work, two different basic nanostructures have focused our attention which are schematically presented as (A) and (B) in Fig. 1. Both are grown without use of any bath additive such as a dye, a surfactant, a polymer and so on, but they are designed by playing on the growth condition (precursor concentration and bath temperature). The (A) structure is a nanocrystalline film (hereafter noted nc-ZnO) prepared at room temperature and at a rather high Zn(II) concentration of 5 mM. On SEM views of Fig. 2a and b and after 120 min of growth the film is made of assembled platelets with a fine porosity separated by large voids. It has been shown previously45 that on FTO substrate the crystallization of such films is delayed and that, in a first step, an amorphous veil of zinc hydroxide is formed. This compound is subsequently progressively dehydrated upon deposition to form a nanocrystalline ZnO film. The growth of these films is slow and difficult since the layer thickness is only 600–700 nm after 120 min of deposition time. As shown in the following, these films cannot be directly used to prepare efficient DSSCs because they are too thin to immobilize a sufficient amount of dye. The (B) structure is an array of ZnO nanowires (hereafter noted nw-ZnO) on which electrodeposition is performed at a rather high temperature (85 °C) and in a solution containing a low concentration of Zn(II) precursor. The nanowire formation has been explained as due to the combined depletion of zinc precursor and to the pH increase that rapidly occurs once all the zinc ions available near the electrode are consumed.48,49 In ref. 44, it has been observed a self-alignment process with a preferential growth of the best vertically oriented initial wires whereas the other ones are rapidly blocked (Fig.2e).

Hierarchical structures have been designed by combining the two previously described growth regimes. Firstly, arrays of vertically aligned ZnO nanowires were deposited on the FTO electrode during 150 min. The aspect of these structures is presented in Fig. 2c–e. The mean wire length was about 3 μm and their density 11 μm−2. In a second step, the bath was changed and the growth conditions of nc-ZnO were used. The growth time was varied in a large extent, namely from 5 min to 360 min. Depending on the deposition time two different architectures have been found which are schematically presented in Fig. 1. For 5 and 10 min, the backbone wires were entirely covered by a uniform and conformal layer of nc-ZnO as shown on the SEM views of Fig. 3a–c. The thickness of this layer increased with the deposition time (Fig. 3b and c). One can clearly observe that the additional layer is porous and looks crystallized. No veil-like film was found at short deposition time as on FTO because the deposition on crystallized ZnO favors the layer crystallization. A scheme of the observed structure is displayed as (C) in Fig. 1. The resulting hierarchical structure will be noted h1-ZnO hereafter.

(a–c) ZnO nanowires decorated with an uniform, conformal porous nc-ZnO layer deposited for 5 min (a and b) or for 10 min (c) at room temperature (hierarchical structures noted h1-ZnO); (d and e) ZnO nanowires embedded in a porous nc-ZnO layer deposited during 180 min at room temperature (hierarchical structure noted h2-ZnO). In (d) the white arrows point out the top of embedded wires. 
By pursuing the secondary growth, the surface layer thickness was increased uniformly along the various wires until the space between the wires was filled. On the SEM views of Fig. 3d and e the space filling by nc-ZnO layer is completed. In that case, the porous layer on the surface of a wire enters in contact and merges more or less with the porous layers grown conformally on neighboring backbone wires. Zoom views clearly show the porosity of the secondary material (Fig.3e). The hybrid structure obtained is schematically presented as (D) in Fig. 1. Hereafter it will be noted h2-ZnO. After complete space filling, occurring above 120 min, the total thickness of h2-ZnO ranged between 3.2 and 3.7 μm. For longer deposition time, the thickness did not significantly increase, confirming that the growth of ZnO at room temperature on a flat surface is difficult. However, in the present case, confinement effects between the ZnO-NWs permitted us to grow a film which thickness was mainly fixed by the wire length. Indeed, on the micrographs of Fig. 3d we can see some tops of the longest backbone wires (pointed out by white arrows) that are covered by the nc-ZnO secondary layer and which slightly emerge from the porous layer.

Fig. 4 are the current transients recorded upon ZnO electrodeposition. The a-curve was for the nc-ZnO on FTO with a very low current density. The growth of ZnO was difficult, notably because the deposited layer contained poorly conducting zinc hydroxide. The current increase with time was assigned to the progressive dehydration of zinc hydroxide and formation of a more conducting ZnO phase.45 The b-curve was recorded upon the wire growth on FTO and is characterized by a continuous current density increase. The c-curve was obtained for the secondary growth of nc-ZnO on nw-ZnO. a- and c-curves have a very different shape. Indeed, the current density measured at room temperature on the wires is much higher than the one recorded on FTO substrate. It is in agreement with SEM views and it can be expected that, due to the contact of the deposited layer with the ZnO wires, crystallization is favored and that Zn(OH)2 is formed in a much less extent. The deposit is then more conducting. We can observe a maximum of cathodic current and then a slow decrease. After more than 140 min, the measured current is constant and reaches low values similar to those recorded on flat substrates (curve a). The three parts can be explained by the following mechanism: first, the total surface of the electrode increases upon the deposition and the current increases. Hence, after 30 min, a maximum is reached and the merging of the nc-ZnO layers grown on different wires starts. The external surface of the deposit then decreases until it becomes almost flat because the nanocrystalline layer fills the spaces between the wires and attains the top of the wire. Then a third growth regime occurs and the electrode behaves like a flat electrode. Upon the third stage, the layer thickness growth is very slow. We can note that according to Fig. 4, the j values are governed by the external surface of the deposit and that the electrochemical reaction, namely, the molecular oxygen reduction 0.5O2 + H2O + 2e− → 2OH−, does not significantly happen inside the pores of nc-ZnO.

The layers were thermally treated at 150 °C for 1 h prior to their structural and optical characterizations. The XRD patterns are presented in Fig. 5A and are indexed with the FTO substrate (noted with stars) and the wurtzite hexagonal structure of ZnO. The nw-ZnO pattern is dominated by the (002) reflection peak of ZnO and confirms that the wires grow along their c-axis and are vertically well-aligned. The XRDs of the h1-ZnO structures (patterns c- and d-) are similar to that of nw-ZnO (pattern b-) and suggest that the deposited secondary phase, the volume fraction of which is low, is crystallographically oriented identically to the supporting wires.

(B) Raman spectra of (a) nc-ZnO; (b) nw-ZnO and (c) h2-ZnO. The stars point out the substrate contributions. 
The XRDs are significantly changed after one hour of deposition of nc-ZnO (patterns e- to i-). Indeed, the (002) diffraction is split into two, with a component on both sides of the initial (002) line recorded for the wires. We can observe on the patterns that the substrate (FTO) diffraction lines have an unchanged position and that the shift is not an artifact. The observed phenomenon is surprising and to the best of our knowledge has not been reported before for ZnO hierarchical structures. The same effect is observed for the (100) and (101) reflection lines with the presence of a shoulder on the side of a main peak at lower angles. The patterns suggest the presence of two hexagonal compounds with different lattice parameters. We can suppose that the peaks at lower angles are the nc-ZnO material contributions since they have a higher FWHM as expected for nanocrystalline ZnO. The diffraction peaks have been deconvolved to discriminate the two components. From the peak positions, the a and c crystallographic parameters of the hexagonal phases have been determined.50 The results are summarized in Table 1 and compared to bulk ZnO data. The two lattice parameters are significantly different for the two materials present in the h2-ZnO hierarchical structures. It is known that the ZnO crystal lattice constants are sensitive to the strain51,52 and we have assigned the shift of the nanowire (002) peak after 60 min of nc-ZnO deposition time to this phenomenon. The strain along the c-axis is defined by:ε = (cnw − cbulk)/cbulk

The stress is then defined as: σ = −233 × 109ε
We have reported in Table 2 the values calculated from our experimental XRD data. We can note that the stress is maximum after 120 min and that some relaxation occurs for longer nc-ZnO deposition time. In the same table, we have reported the nanocrystallite size of nc-ZnO in h2-ZnO structures calculated from the XRD FWHM data by using the Scherrer formula.53 The values along the three main crystallographic directions appearing in the XRD patterns have been calculated and averaged. They range between 17 and 19 nm, in good agreement with SEM views.

The formation of crystallized ZnO was confirmed by micro-Raman spectroscopy in Fig. 5B. The E2 optical modes, which are commonly detected in the wurtzite hexagonal ZnO, are observed as dominant peaks at 100 and 438 cm−1. The spectra of nw-ZnO and h2-ZnO were dominated by the low-E2 and the high-E2 modes as expected for a preferential orientation along the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate. The low-E2 mode in ZnO is associated with the vibration of heavy Zn sub-lattice and the high-E2 mode involves only the oxygen atoms. The E2H − E2L emission could be also observed especially for the h2-ZnO sample. Interestingly the peak split into two was found again for the micro-Raman of the h2-ZnO sample, whereas it was absent in the nw-ZnO spectrum. This confirms the presence of two different ZnO materials in h2-ZnO layers with different lattice parameters as calculated from XRD patterns (Table 1).
The total transmission and total reflectance of the various nanostructures are presented in Fig. 6. The absorption edge is due to the semiconducting properties of ZnO. The T-curves of nw-ZnO, h1-ZnO and h2-ZnO are similar. We can note that the transmission edge of nc-ZnO is shifted to shorter wavelength values and the bandgap energy of the deposited material is slightly higher in that case. It may be due to the presence of zinc hydroxide in the layer.45 The reflectance of the hierarchical structure h1-ZnO and h2-ZnO is higher than that of the nc-ZnO by about 30%. The nanowire array in nw-ZnO, h1-ZnO and h2-ZnO plays the role of a light scatterer. The effect is interesting for DSSC application for which light trapping is searched out. Light scattering increases the sunlight pathway, and then the absorbance of the layer once sensitized, especially in the near-infrared region where the dye absorption is less efficient.

The ZnO nanostructured films were sensitized with the D149 indoline dye.17Sensitization is a crucial step for DSSC fabrication because the dye acts as the solar light absorber in the device and the dye loading of the ZnO layers must be optimized to absorb a maximum of the solar light. This parameter was measured by desorption of D149 sensitized layers in 1 mL of dimethyl formamide (DMF). The dye titration was then done by UV-Vis absorption measurements at 540 nm, the absorption maximum of the dye. The layer thickness and volume were measured precisely by profilometry and the dye loading was calculated as a density (Fig.7a) and as a concentration (Fig.7b). In Fig.7a, the dye density in the hierarchical structures has been reported as a function of nc-ZnO deposition time. An increase was observed with the deposition time up to 180 min, whereas for longer times it was almost constant. As shown in Fig.7b, and explained above, the film thickness of h2-ZnO did not significantly change after 180 min of nc-ZnO deposition time and the maximum of effective surface area was reached then. The dye loading titration is a means to roughly estimate the effective surface area of the ZnO layers, so if we suppose that the area of a D149 dye molecule is about 2.2 nm2 (calculated from the projected ellipsoid), the effective surface area of the best layer is found higher than 280. In Fig.7b, the variation of the dye concentration in the films has been reported and found constant above 120 min of nc-ZnO deposition time at about 50 mmol L−1.

        DSSC sandwich type cells were constructed with the sensitized ZnO nanostructures and their performances were evaluated by recording J–V curves under normalized illumination. Some characteristics are presented in Fig.8A and the parameters for the best cells prepared from five different ZnO nanostructures are reported in Table 3. The energy conversion efficiency, η, of the electrodeposited nw-ZnO was low at about 0.5% due to a low FF and Jsc. The low roughness of the layer yields a poor sensitization: the light harvesting was not optimized and Jsc was low. The efficiency of nc-ZnO directly grown on FTO was only 1.1%. In that case the ZnO layer thickness was limited at about 600 nm with the presence of voids giving rise to a low dye loading. More interesting efficiencies were found with the hierarchical structures. The decorated nanowires (h1-ZnO), with a nc-ZnO deposition time of 10 min reached an overall conversion efficiency of 2.03%. The best cells were fabricated with the h2-ZnO layers (nc-ZnO deposition time of 240 min). In Fig. 8B, the efficiencies of cells with the hierarchical structures have been plotted as a function of the nc-ZnO deposition time, td. A continuous increase is found with a maximum for 240 min, whereas for longer td, η slightly decreased. The maximum of efficiency is due to a high photocurrent.

In Table 3, we have also reported the characteristics of a reference nanoparticulate cell prepared by the classical doctor-blading technique (schematically presented as E) in Fig. 1. We have studied in detail np-ZnO cells in ref. 11 and the reported data are for an optimized cell with a ZnO film thickness of 12 μm. It is remarkable that the performance of the best h2-ZnO cells was markedly higher (3.62%) than that of the reference nanoparticulate cell (2.84%). This has been obtained with much thinner ZnO films (3.5 μm instead of 12 μm). The Jsc of np-ZnO and h2-ZnO cells are close, whereas the Voc is significantly higher in the case of the h2-ZnO cells. In Table 3, we can see that when nc-ZnO is present in the layer, the Voc is rather high. A possible explanation could be a higher conduction band energy due to the surface properties of this type of electrodeposited ZnO.17
The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) action spectra of the films are presented in Fig.9. The IPCE maximum was found at 535 nm. The IPCE markedly increased with the thickness of the nc-ZnO secondary layer due to a better light harvesting. To better understand the functioning of the cells, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements under AM 1.5G, 1 sun illumination were conducted at the open circuit voltage of the cells. The spectra are displayed in Fig.10. The Nyquist plots are typical two-arc-of-circle or three-arc-of-circle spectra (Fig. 10A and B). The high frequency relaxation is classically assigned to the redox reaction at the charged counter-electrode and the intermediate frequency relaxation is due to the injection/recombination reactions and electron diffusion in the photoanode. A third loop could be observed at low frequency for h2-ZnO cells and for nc-ZnO cell which is due to the diffusion of tri-iodide in the organic electrolyte. This part increased with the nc-ZnO deposition time. It means that diffusion limitation of I3− occurred in the finely porous nc-ZnO phase of the h2-ZnO structures. From the impedance imaginary part maximum of the photoanode loop at intermediate/low-frequency, the electron lifetimes in the various photoanodes were calculated according to the procedure described elsewhere.11 The values are reported in Table 3. They are in the tens of milliseconds range. It can be seen that this parameter is rather low when nanocrystalline ZnO is present in the structure. So we can suppose that recombination occurs in a higher rate in these structures. However, if the photocurrent is high, especially in h2-ZnO cell, it is because the transfer time is short due to the presence of the nanowires that are presumed to act as a preferential electron pathway (inset cartoon in Fig. 1).

The EIS spectra in Fig. 10A and B show that the global resistance (measured at the intersection of the real axis at low frequency) is very large in the case of the nw-ZnO because the quantity of dye and then the photocurrent are low. This parameter is significantly reduced with the nc-ZnO deposition time on the nanowire arrays due to an increasing dye loading (see Fig.10B). Above 240 min of tp, the low frequency tri-iodide diffusion loop increased in magnitude and then the cell global resistance increased again. We can suppose that the porous phase became more closed and that the diffusion of the redox species in the photoanode pores was more difficult in that case. Consequently the global conversion efficiency of the DSSC reached a maximum and then decreased slightly for a nc-ZnO deposition time of 360 min (Fig.8B).
In order to optimize the system, longer nanowires were grown electrochemically for 300 min instead of 150 min and the nc-ZnO was grown subsequently during 4 h. The global layer thickness was then increased at ∼5 μm. The cell performances were significantly improved. The J–V characteristics are given in Table 3: η = 4.08%, Jsc = 12.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.57 V and FF = 0.58. The Jsc was increased due to a higher effective surface area and dye loading. The presented nanostructured layers prepared by electrodeposition are thus very promising and open the gate to the design of ZnO nanoarchitectures with optimized dye loading, electronic transport and sunlight entrapping.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have described a new and original method for the electrochemical growth of ZnO nanocrystalline porous layers and hierarchical structures. The structures have been designed by just playing on the growth conditions and without any use of template or additive in the aqueous deposition bath. By combining ZnO nanowire arrays and nanoporous layers two types of ZnO hierarchical architectures have been designed. The layers have been sensitized with the D149 organic dye and DSSCs have been constructed. A promising maximum overall conversion efficiency of 4.08% has been reached in the case of ZnO nanowires embedded in a nanoporous crystallized layer. The nanowires play an important role from the growth and opto-electronic viewpoints. They permitted to growth thick ZnO layers, they increased the sunlight trapping by the photoanode and were presumed to act as preferential electron pathway for a fast charge transfer from the photoexcited dye to the back contact.

Broader context

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are among the most promising environmentally friendly energy-conversion devices. The possibility of being fabricated by low-cost and easy-scalable solution processing techniques has driven the technology to the marketplace. The nanostructured wide bandgap film of oxide semiconductor is a key component of the devices. ZnO has promising opto-electronic properties to be used in the photoanodes of DSSCs. Advantages over the other semiconductors include an impressive variety of nanostructures varying from 1D-single-crystalline crystallites to complex designed hierarchical structures. ZnO can be also synthesized and processed at low temperature, especially by using electrochemical growth techniques which are then perfectly compatible with lightweight plastic flexible substrates. The use of hierarchical ZnO structures in the devices is an innovative concept that should permit the optimizing of the electronic transfer in the photoanode and the solar light harvesting by increasing the light pathway by scattering.
