    , Accepted 19th August 2020First published on 19th August 2020AbstractThe rational design of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts remains a challenge for large scale hydrogen production. Regulating the heterointerface between two catalyst components could effectively modulate the electronic structure and tune the electrocatalytic activity. Herein, a hybrid RuO2–NiO electrocatalyst on nickel foam was prepared via a simple and easy industrial scale-up approach, which affords a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of 18 mV for HER and 187 mV for OER, respectively. The electrolyzer assembled by the RuO2–NiO bifunctional electrode needs a cell voltage of only 1.43 V to reach 10 mA cm−2 for the overall water splitting. Moreover, the electrolyzer achieved an outstanding activity and stability at high current densities, which needed a cell voltage of only 1.66 V to reach 500 mA cm−2, and could perform continuous electrolysis for 2000 hours at 1000 mA cm−2, thereby demonstrating a great potential for practical applications. Theoretical calculations revealed that the coupling of RuO2 and NiO could greatly accelerate water dissociation and modulate the chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates on the catalyst, and consequently enhance the intrinsic activity towards both HER and OER.
Introduction
Hydrogen energy has been hailed as one of the most important sustainable energy, as well as the best carrier of new energy economy.1–3 Water electrolysis is an ideal strategy for hydrogen production using intermittent renewable sources, such as wind or solar power that is sometimes hard to integrate into the power grid.4–6 Therefore, there is urgent need to develop a water electrolysis system with high efficiency, practicality, and reliability.
Electrocatalysts are required to accelerate the sluggish reaction kinetics for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).7,8 However, the rational design of a highly efficient and stable catalyst for the industrial-scale electrolysis system is still a challenge.9,10 Platinum and iridium oxide are currently the most active catalysts towards HER and OER, respectively.11–13 The obvious disadvantages of such materials are their high cost that severely obstructs their industrial applications.14–16 Although non-noble metal catalysts, such as sulfides,17 selenides,18 carbides,19 and phosphides,20–22 have been extensively studied over the past years, the relatively inferior activity, poor durability, as well as the complicated and high-cost synthesis, even with poisonous and noxious reagents, is still the main barrier for such catalysts in realizing the commercialization of hydrogen production.23–25 A widely acceptable compromise formula is to greatly reduce the consumption of noble metals and improve their utilization efficiency to the best extent possible, which could accomplish the low-cost hydrogen production.26,27 Thanks to the catalytic activity and chemical stability of Ru-based catalysts,28,29 especially RuO2,30–32 which is similar to that of Ir and Pt, as well as the low price among noble metals ($8.037, $31.893, and $47.583 per g for Ru, Pt, and Ir in 2020, respectively)33 that it is considered to be the most promising water electrochemical splitting catalyst instead of Ir and Pt. However, according to the Nørskov volcano theory, RuO2 still suffers from a non-neglectable distance from the peak of the 2D volcano plot in the OER.34,35 Meanwhile, a large number of experimental results have also shown that the best among the current RuO2-based catalysts still need hundreds of millivolts of overpotentials for OER to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2.24,30,32,36 Beyond this, the report of RuO2 for HER catalysis is seldom due to the sluggish kinetics.24 However, a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and OER with the same electrolyte has the advantages of simple operation and low cost.37–40 Hence it is quite necessary and urgent to greatly improve both OER and HER catalytic activities of RuO2.
Many strategies, including elemental doping and shape or/and size control, have been developed to enhance the catalytic activity.32,41 Interfacial engineering can effectively tune the electronic states of the catalysts; thus, constructing a heterointerface structure is an effective way to improve the catalytic activity of electrode materials.42,43 The heterointerface structure with a strong coupling between the two components could induce definite synergies, which not only remains their inherent properties but also generate some new effects.44,45 The electronic structure of the catalyst could be well-tuned to match a moderate binding strength between the intermediates and the catalyst surfaces, and thus accelerate the reaction kinetics in HER and/or OER.42,43,46–48 Moreover, the heterostructured catalyst with abundant interfaces provides plentiful catalytic active sites, thus favoring the catalytic performance. In particular, the MoSe2–NiSe2–CoSe2 multiple heterointerfaces lead to an increased Fermi level and optimized ΔGH*, and an enhanced HER performance was experimentally achieved.49 In some typical cases, with the help of the synergy effect, the heterostructure catalysts fabricated by loading a tiny amount of noble metal on the active supports, such as N/P doped graphene and transition metal or metal oxide/phosphide/sulfide/nitride, have even achieved a performance in water electrochemical splitting superior to that of the noble metal based catalysts such as Pt, Ir, Ru, IrO2, RuO2, IrP, and RuP.50–55 In addition, the active noble metal sites could be well anchored on the support through the strong interaction, which could achieve an excellent catalytic stability and the uniform dispersion of noble metals,50,56 thus increasing its utilization efficiency. Thereby, the most effective and viable option to obtain an excellent water splitting electrocatalyst is to construct a large number of heterointerfaces between the noble metal and the active support. Owing to the high activity, earth abundance, and anticorrosion property in alkaline solution, transition metal oxides are generally regarded as promising catalysts for OER.47,48 Meanwhile, it is believed that transition metal oxides could promote water dissociation, which facilitates the production of the H intermediates, and thus favors alkaline HER kinetics. For example, Wan et al. reported that NiO accelerated the Volmer step, while metallic Ni facilitated the Heyrovsky/Tafel step; thus, the alkaline HER activity of the Ni-based catalyst could be significantly enhanced by tuning the Ni/NiO ratio.57 Dai et al. reported a NiO/Ni heterostructure attached to a CNT network, which exhibited high HER catalytic activity close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts,58 and Cr2O3 could impart high stability to the Ni@NiO/Cr2O3 catalyst.59 With this consideration, transition metal oxides could be ideal candidates to couple with RuO2 in order to achieve better water splitting performance. However, most transition metal oxides suffer from poor conductivity, which greatly impedes the improvement of their activity efficiency.60 This issue is expected to be resolved by engineering a heterointerface structure that can effectively accelerate electron transfer.42,46,61,62
In the current work, NiO was selected as a model component to construct the heterointerface structure with RuO2 since it is facile to in situ fabricate the RuO2–NiO catalyst on nickel foam, which could efficiently increase the electrocatalytic stability. The hybrid RuO2–NiO complex catalyst on nickel foam (RuO2–NiO/NF) was prepared using a simple and easy scale-up dip and heating method. The RuO2–NiO/NF catalyst with abundant hybrid interfaces is capable of catalyzing both OER and HER at very low overpotentials. The corresponding dual-electrode electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of 1.43 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting, and 1.66 V to reach a commercially practical 500 mA cm−2, which exceeds most of the reported water-splitting catalysts. Furthermore, the RuO2–NiO/NF catalyst presents high stability, which could perform continuous electrolysis for 2000 hours at 1000 mA cm−2 with a slight decrease in the activity (≈10%). The interface-induced synergy was systematically investigated by theoretical calculations, which illustrate that the RuO2–NiO interface can effectively tune the electronic structure, increase the electrical conductivity, optimize the intermediate bindings, and promote H2O dissociation, thus favoring the OER and HER processes.
Experimental
Preparation of RuO2–NiO/NF
RuO2–NiO/NF was prepared via a simple method. First, commercial nickel foam (NF, 2 × 3 cm2) was ultrasonically cleaned with 3 m HCl, ethanol, and ultrapure water. Second, the NF was directly immersed in 25 mL aqueous solution of RuCl3 with different concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80, and 120 mM) for 5 min. The sample was then dried in an oven at 60 °C and labeled as pre-RuO2–NiO/NF. Finally, Ru pre-RuO2–NiO/NF was annealed in air at 300 °C for 30 min with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The final product was labeled as RuO2–NiO/NF.
Preparation of NiO/NF
NiO/NF was prepared in the same way as that for RuO2–NiO/NF except for using NiCl2 solution instead of the RuCl3 solution. The NF was directly immersed into 120 mL aqueous solution of NiCl2 for 5 min and dried in an oven. Finally, the sample was annealed in air to obtain NiO/NF.
Preparation of O–NF
The blank NF was directly annealed in air to obtain the oxidized NF (O–NF).
Preparation of RuO2 and Pt/C on NFs
For comparison, 5 mg of Pt/C or RuO2 was dispersed in 660 μL ultrapure water, 300 μL ethanol, and 40 μL 5% Nafion, then the suspension was dip-coated on NF and dried under ambient conditions to prepare Pt/C/NF and RuO2/NF with a desired catalyst mass loading. The mass loading of the Pt/C for Pt/C/NF sample was 0.19 mg cm−2 and the mass loadings of RuO2 for the RuO2/NF samples were 0.83 and 0.19 mg cm−2, respectively.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical investigations were performed at room temperature on a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (CHI Instruments, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Corporation, China) using a carbon rod and a Hg/HgO electrode as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The prepared samples were used as the working electrodes and the electrolyte was a 1 M KOH aqueous solution. All the potentials reported in this work were referenced to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the following equation: E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Hg/HgO) + 0.098 + 0.059 × pH. All the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were reported with iR correction and the scan rate was 1 mV s−1 to minimize the effect of the capacitive current. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under a fixed bias of 100 mV in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. Doule-layer capacitance (Cdl) data were collected by measuring the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at various scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV s−1). For faradaic efficiency (FE) determination, the theoretical amount of H2 and O2 was calculated based on the Faraday law; the actual H2 and O2 amounts were tested via a Hoffman apparatus setup in a two-electrode system. During long-term electrolysis, fresh 1 M KOH electrolyte was charged into the electrolytic cell to replace all of the former electrolyte every 100 h to maintain continuous operation.
Results and discussion
The RuO2–NiO heterostructure with hybrid interfaces was prepared by a simple approach as described in Fig. 1a, which permitted the convenient synthesis of the electrocatalyst at a large scale. The blank NF was firstly immersed in an aqueous solution of RuCl3 and then dried to obtain the pre-sample. After annealing in air, the RuO2–NiO/NF sample was obtained (Fig. S1†). Obviously, this simple and easy preparation process is very suitable for large scale production (Fig. S2†). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed that Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS no. 03-0177, Fig. S3†) was generated in the pre-sample (labeled as the pre-RuO2–NiO/NF catalyst), and no characteristic peaks can be ascribed to the Ru species due to the low crystallinity. After annealing, the XRD pattern (Fig. 1b) verified the formation of NiO (JCPDS no. 04-0835) and RuO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1172). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to characterize the morphology of the as-prepared catalyst. Fig. S4† displays that blank NF has a smooth surface, while a large number of nanocrystals can be observed in the pre-RuO2–NiO/NF catalyst (Fig. S5†). For RuO2–NiO/NF, the as-formed hybrid nanocrystals are distributed uniformly on the surface of NF (Fig. 1c). Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping images show a uniform distribution of the Ni, O, and Ru elements on the NF (Fig. 1d). The nanocrystals were peeled off by ultrasonic treatment and then characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 1e shows that the catalyst is composed of a large number of nanoparticles (NPs). The corresponding high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image shows the lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.208 and 0.241 nm (Fig. 1f), which is consistent with the (200) and (111) planes of fcc NiO, respectively. The interplanar spacing of 0.255 nm corresponds to the (101) plane of tetragonal RuO2. The (200) and (111) facets of NiO and the neighboring (101) facet of RuO2 constitute the interface of the heterostructured catalyst. EDX elemental mappings demonstrate the uniform distribution of Ni, O, and Ru elements within the NPs (Fig. 1g). The EDX spectrum of RuO2–NiO NPs reveals that the ratio of Ni to Ru is 20:1 (Fig. S6†). All these results confirmed the formation of the heterostructured catalyst.

The chemical states of RuO2–NiO were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS survey scan in Fig. 2a illustrates the existence of Ru, Ni, and O elements in the catalyst. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Ru 3d region can be deconvoluted into Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2 at 281.2 and 285.0 eV, respectively, and the satellite peaks located at 282.5 and 286.1 eV were simulated out (Fig. 2b).32,36 The peak located at 284.8 eV is assigned to C 1s.63 In the Ru 3p core-level XPS spectrum (Fig. 2c), the peaks located at 463.2 and 485.6 eV can be ascribed to Ru 3p3/2 and Ru 3p1/2, respectively. It is noticeable that the binding energy of Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3p3/2 is higher than that of pure RuO2 (Ru 3d5/2 280.8 and Ru 3p3/2 462.7 eV, respectively),24,32,64,65 implying that the electrons of Ru in the RuO2–NiO complex are transferred to the neighboring hybrid atoms, such as Ni and O. In the Ni 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d), two core-level peaks located at 855.6 and 872.8 eV can be identified as Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, which has no obvious difference from the pure NiO sample.66,67

To investigate the catalytic activity of the catalysts, the OER properties of RuO2–NiO/NF were examined in 1.0 M KOH using a standard three-electrode system. The optimal loading mass of RuO2 for OER was determined by testing the performance of the catalyst prepared in RuCl3 solution with different concentrations. As illustrated in Fig. S7,† there was no obvious improvement in the OER activity when the RuCl3 concentration exceeds 20 mM. Thus, we chose the sample prepared in 20 mM RuCl3 solution for further OER study, and the actual loading mass of Ru measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was 0.146 mg cm−2. The OER performance of blank NF, O–NF (Fig. S8†), NiO/NF (Fig. S9†), and commercial RuO2 were also investigated as the references, and the result is presented in Fig. 3a. As expected, blank NF, O–NF, and NiO/NF show poor OER activity, while RuO2–NiO/NF only needs an overpotential of about 187 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that of the commercial RuO2 catalyst (271 mV). Note that the peak centered at about 1.38 V in Fig. 4a was caused by the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ prior to water oxidation.68 Moreover, RuO2–NiO/NF also possesses a promising activity at high current densities. It achieves a current density of up to 482 mA cm−2 at 1.55 V, which is much higher than that of pure RuO2 (20 mA cm−2) and most reported catalysts (Fig. 3g and Table S1†). Fig. 3b shows that the Tafel slope of RuO2–NiO/NF is 36 mV dec−1, which is much lower than that of RuO2 (68 mV dec−1) and NiO/NF (77 mV dec−1), suggesting good reaction kinetics of the RuO2–NiO/NF catalyst for OER. The OER activity of the RuO2–NiO/NF catalyst prepared with a large area was also investigated. The sample cut out from areas a, b, and c was tested, and the result shows that different parts of the sample maintain consistently high electroactivity, which further proved the potential of RuO2–NiO/NF for mass production (Fig. S10†). Electrochemical durability is another important criterion for catalysts. The linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) curve of RuO2–NiO/NF was measured after 5000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry scanning. Fig. 3c shows that there was no obvious decline in the OER performance after the stability test. The long-term electrochemical stability of RuO2–NiO/NF at 100 mA cm−2 was also tested and is shown in Fig. 3c. The inset presents that the current density remained almost constant for 20 h. The SEM image of RuO2–NiO/NF after the OER test shows that there is no distinct variation in the morphology of the sample (Fig. S11†). XPS measurement was also performed for the post-OER samples, as shown in Fig. S12;† no obvious change in the chemical states after the OER stability test were observed, indicating the high stability of RuO2–NiO/NF towards OER in alkaline media.

The HER activity of RuO2–NiO/NF was also measured in 1 M KOH. As presented in Fig. S13,† RuO2–NiO/NF prepared in RuCl3 solution with a concentration of 80 mM possesses an optimal HER activity, which was selected for further HER study, and the actual loading mass of Ru measured by ICP-MS was 0.632 mg cm−2. The HER activity of blank NF, O–NF, NiO/NF, commercial RuO2, and Pt/C were also measured for comparison and the result is shown in Fig. 3d. It can be observed that NF, O–NF, and NiO/NF show negligible HER activity, and as expected, RuO2 is not an ideal HER catalyst as it needs a large overpotential of 69 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Distinctly, RuO2–NiO/NF only needs an overpotential of 18 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is much lower than that of Pt/C (36 mV). Similarly, RuO2–NiO/NF also possesses an outstanding activity at high current densities. The catalyst achieves a current density of 452 mA cm−2 at −100 mV, which is much higher than that of Pt/C (104 mA cm−2) and most reported catalysts (Fig. 3h and Table S2†). The Tafel slope of RuO2–NiO/NF is 27 mV dec−1, which is similar to that of Pt/C (30 mV dec−1) and is much smaller than that of RuO2 (54 mV dec−1), indicating the superior reaction kinetics of RuO2–NiO/NF for HER. The HER activity of RuO2–NiO/NF prepared with a large area was also investigated; the result shows that different parts of the sample maintained the same activity (Fig. S14†). Moreover, RuO2–NiO/NF possesses excellent durability for HER, which was verified by a cycling test and long-term electrolysis for 20 h at 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3f). There was no obvious change in the morphology (Fig. S15†) and the chemical states (Fig. S16†) of the post-HER sample, which also indicates the remarkable stability of RuO2–NiO/NF for HER.
To gain more insight into the improvement of the catalytic activity, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) investigations of RuO2–NiO/NF were performed. ECSA was evaluated by the calculation of double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and the Cdl of RuO2–NiO/NF with different loading masses of RuO2, which is presented in Fig. S17.† The result shows that the Cdl enlarged with increasing loading amount of RuO2, indicating that the increase in RuO2 effectively enhanced the electrochemical active surface area. The EIS was measured to estimate the electron transfer rate of the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3i, the charge-transfer resistance of RuO2–NiO/NF obviously decreased with the increasing amount of RuO2, suggesting that the as-formed RuO2–NiO interfaces significantly lowered the charge-transfer resistance, which is in agreement with the theoretical result and consequentially accelerated the catalytic reaction kinetics.69
To elucidate the effect of the interfaces that exists in the RuO2–NiO heterostructure on its catalytic performance, an atomic model was constructed to simulate the hybrid catalyst and first-principle calculations were performed based on DFT (Fig. 4a).32,50 The HER process in alkaline electrolyte specifically involves two elementary steps, namely, the dissociation of H2O and the subsequent associative desorption of H2. Fig. 4b shows the calculated free energy diagram of H2O dissociation on RuO2, which is an endothermic process with a large energy barrier of 0.36 eV. In contrast, the dissociation barrier of H2O at the RuO2–NiO interface is drastically reduced to 0.09 eV, indicating the significant effect of NiO in promoting H2O dissociation and substantially accelerating the production of H*. ΔGH* is generally used as an important feature to evaluate the activity for HER. An ideal catalyst should possess a moderate H adsorption energy near zero, leading to optimal HER performance due to the equilibrium between the adsorption/desorption steps.70,71 The optimized structures with the adsorption of H on the catalysts and the computed HER free energy plots are presented in Fig. 4c, S18, and S19.† The RuO2–NiO hybrid shows a lower ΔGH* than NiO and RuO2, suggesting that the generated interface could significantly improve its HER activity. Typically, OER undergoes a four-electron step process.70,72 The optimized structures of NiO, RuO2, and the RuO2–NiO hybrid with the adsorption of OOH, OH, and O intermediates are presented in Fig. 4d, S20, and S21, respectively.†Fig. 4e presents the calculated free energy profiles of the above catalysts with different applied potentials. At the potential of 0 V, the rate-determining step (RDS) for NiO is the conversion of OH* to O* due to its largest reaction free energy (ΔG) of 2.26 eV, corresponding to a theoretical overpotential (η) of 1.03 V. While the RDS for RuO2 is the conversion of O* to OOH* (ΔG = 2.06 eV, η = 0.83 V), which agree well with the reported calculation results.32,36,73,74 Notably, the value of reaction free energy dropped to 1.89 eV for RuO2–NiO, thus reducing the theoretical overpotential to 0.66 V. RuO2–NiO needs a lower potential than that of RuO2 and NiO to make all the steps become downhill. The decrease in the required potential demonstrates that the RuO2–NiO heterostructure facilitates the oxygen evolution process. The differential charge density of the interfacial model is illustrated in Fig. 4f, which shows that there is a redistribution of the charge density near the RuO2–NiO interface. Electron depletion on the Ru sites while accumulation near the O atoms would weaken H adsorption in O and thus be beneficial to the HER process.75Fig. 4g presents the projected density of states (PDOS) of NiO, RuO2, and RuO2–NiO. Unlike NiO with a wide band-gap, RuO2–NiO is intrinsically metallic, indicating an enhanced electrical conductivity.74 Compared with RuO2, the d-band centers (εd) of the Ru d orbital in RuO2–NiO shifts to a low-energy level, suggesting weakened interaction between the adsorbed oxygen species and the Ru site, thus favoring the OER process.14,36,62,76,77 Overall, it could be expected that constructing the RuO2–NiO hybrid interface could modulate the electronic structure, thus optimizing the adsorption energy of the intermediates in the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps for HER and accelerating the whole kinetic process for OER, which is conducive for the water-splitting process.
Eventually, the application of RuO2–NiO/NF as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting was investigated in a two-electrode configuration in 1 M KOH (RuO2–NiO/NF‖RuO2–NiO/NF). As references, the couples of Pt/C‖RuO2 and RuO2‖RuO2 were also measured. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the RuO2–NiO/NF‖RuO2–NiO/NF electrolyzer could generate 10 mA cm−2 at a low cell voltage of 1.43 V, which is much lower than those of Pt/C‖RuO2 (1.52 V) and RuO2‖RuO2 (1.55 V). The low onset potential was also proved well by the experiment that water electrolysis could be powered by an AA-size battery (Fig. 5c and Video S1†). Moreover, RuO2–NiO/NF‖RuO2–NiO/NF also possesses a high activity at high current densities. The catalyst achieves a current density of up to 631 mA cm−2 at 1.7 V, which is much higher than that of Pt/C‖RuO2 (88 mA cm−2), RuO2‖RuO2 (61 mA cm−2), and most reported bifunctional catalysts (Fig. 5d and Table S3†). Commercial alkaline water electrolysis generally needs cell voltage in the range of 1.8–2.4 V in order to achieve a current density in the range of 200–400 mA cm−2.78,79 Impressively, RuO2–NiO‖RuO2–NiO only requires about 1.66 V to reach 500 mA cm−2. In addition, the faradaic efficiency (FE) of RuO2–NiO/NF‖RuO2–NiO/NF for water splitting was close to 100% (Fig. 5e and S22†). Moreover, the durability of RuO2–NiO/NF was measured at 100 mA cm−2; it is surprising that the catalyst maintained stable electrolysis for as long as 2000 h (Fig. 5f). Extremely high-current operation of the electrolyzer for overall water splitting at 1000 mA cm−2 was also continuously measured for 2000 h; the result shows that the catalytic activity remained almost 90% after such a long period and ICP-OES analysis suggests that the concentration of Ru and Ni dissolved in the electrolyte is quite low (Table. S4†), which is a significant progress towards practical industrial application. According to the experiment and theoretical analysis, the outstanding electrocatalytic performance of RuO2–NiO/NF could be attributed to the following: (i) the coupling effect of RuO2–NiO significantly improved the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. As illustrated in Fig. 5g, the RuO2–NiO interface could effectively promote H2O dissociation and optimize the ΔGH*, which greatly improved the HER performance. The d-band center of the Ru d orbital in the RuO2–NiO heterostructure shifted to a low-energy level compared to that of RuO2, which weakened the interaction between the adsorbed oxygen species and the Ru site, thus favoring the OER process. (ii) Constructing the heterointerface of RuO2–NiO could effectively modulate the conductivity so as to achieve a lower electrochemical impedance, and could also provide abundant catalytic active sites to increase the catalytic area. (iii) The homogeneous distribution of tiny RuO2 on NiO increased its utilization efficiency and the in situ fabrication process of RuO2–NiO/NF using NiO extracted from the support led to its superior stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a facile strategy that could scale-up the synthesis of bifunctional RuO2–NiO/NF catalysts with outstanding performance for both OER and HER in alkaline media. The corresponding electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of 1.43 and 1.66 V to achieve a current density of 10 and 500 mA cm−2 for full water splitting, respectively. RuO2–NiO/NF also presents excellent durability for long-term electrolysis at high current densities. Moreover, DFT calculations revealed that the d-band centers of the Ru d orbital in the RuO2–NiO heterostructure shifted to a low-energy level compared to that of RuO2, which weakened the interaction between the adsorbed oxygen species and the Ru site, thus favoring the OER process. In addition, the RuO2–NiO interface promoted H2O dissociation and optimized the ΔGH*, which greatly improved its HER performance. Overall, we reported a simple but potent strategy towards the electrocatalyst for practical hydrogen production.
