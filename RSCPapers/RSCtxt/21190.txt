    , Accepted 8th January 2021First published on 28th January 2021AbstractThe development of effective and low cost-efficient strategies for energy storage and conversions as well as an eco-friendly environment to sustain is an important current issue. Over past few years, the concept of graphene has triggered research on various 2D materials, especially single as well as few-layered transition metal dichalcogenides. Owing to its extraordinary physicochemical properties and outstanding electronic features, MoS2 is a promising and benchmark material. In comparison to semiconducting 2H-MoS2 exhibiting active sites only on edges, the metallic 1T MoS2 possesses more electrochemically active sites (both on edges and basal surfaces), enlarged interlayer distance, high electronic conductivity, and chemical activity but has stabilization issues. In the 1T/2H-MoS2 mixed-phase heterostructure, where partial transformation occurs from the 2H to 1T phase, the kinetic barrier decreases and more electron transfer occurs, providing an increased number of active sites. In this case, the metastable 1T phase is stabilized due to the interaction of the 2H phase, thereby greatly boosting its catalytic activity. This review gives a comprehensive overview on the structure and various approaches for the fabrication of 1T/2H-MoS2. It also summarizes applications for energy conversion, storage, and pollutant abatement including hydrogen evolution via electro/photocatalysis, supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, as well as organic and inorganic pollutant degradation.

1. Introduction
The development of materials with required properties and characteristics related to energy and environmental issues has been a great challenge since decades.1,2 By tuning various chemical as well as optoelectronic properties, the material has shown major aspects of applications in the mechanical, thermal conductivity, and optoelectronics fields.1,3 In these findings, nanoscience and nanotechnology has provided a wide approach for customizing the structure and shape of the material at nanolevels to achieve a huge range of different advanced properties.1 After the discovery of graphene, significant progress has been obtained by two-dimensional (2D) layered materials owing to their extraordinary physicochemical properties, thus exhibiting wide potential applications in energy production, catalysis, electronics, and energy storage.4–7 Graphene is well known for its excellent electrical property8 but the absence of a direct bandgap restricts its application in logical circuits.9,10 Amongst all beyond-graphene 2D-materials, one particular transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDs), MoS2, has revealed new opportunities towards energy-related technologies and environmental benefits because of its extraordinary physical properties along with chemical properties, outstanding electronic features, and tunable charge carrier behavior.2 MoS2 is most promising due to its chemical stability and carrier mobility, and is a benchmark material as it provides highly impactful sensors and energy storage systems because of its effective, significant electrochemical properties and large surface area.11,12
MoS2 is a tri-layered material composed of a layer of molybdenum packed between two sulphide layers in the S–Mo–S fashion with strong covalent bonds existing between atoms within the crystal and weak van der Waals forces existing among layers.13,14 Based on the order of atomic stacking, MoS2 has been found to be with more than one polytypes and out of all polymorphs, the 2H semiconducting phase and the 1T metallic phase of MoS2 have been studied most frequently.1,15,16 2H-MoS2 in its bulk form is a most stable earth-abundant material and found in nature as its mineral molybdenite, whereas 1T-MoS2 can be synthetically prepared through various methods.15 Bulk 2H-MoS2 is known to be a semiconductor with indirect bandgap (1.29 eV) but when it comes to 2D-MoS2 monolayer it has a direct bandgap (1.9 eV), which makes 2H-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2-based materials suitable for various purposes such as hydrogen evolution, pollutant degradation, energy storage, and biosensors.11,17–22 However, with increasing reports on 2H-MoS2 regarding various performances such as energy conversion and storage, it has been suggested that in 2H-MoS2, only edges were confirmed to be active sites but not basal planes as they were chemically inert, which make this material not competitive with other semiconducting materials.16 In contrast, 1T-MoS2 is a metastable phase possessing hydrophilic and metallic characteristics and can be derived from its thermally stable semiconducting 2H-MoS2 directly or indirectly.15,23 It has been noted that during the transformation process from 2H to 1T, the injection of 4 electrons takes place to each unit of 2H-MoS2, which decreases the kinetic barrier and increases the electron concentration. As a result, the electronic conductivity of the 1T phase MoS2 is increased 107 folds as compared to 2H-MoS2, which enhances its catalytic application in energy conversion and energy storage by reducing the charge transfer resistance.24,25 In 1T-MoS2, both the edges and basal surfaces are the active sites for photocatalytic as well as electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The metallic 1T phase shows high chemical activity, enlarged interlayer distance, and distinct metallic electronic properties compared to the semiconducting 2H phase.26,27 Generally, chemical exfoliation followed by the intercalation of 2H-MoS2 with various alkali metal ions28 can change the phase structure from 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 but this intercalation process is somewhat complicated. Besides, it has also been noted that the 1T-MoS2 produced is highly unstable over 95 °C and gets restacked into its most stable 2H-phase due to S–S van der Waals interactions.23 Therefore, an easier and effective strategy is required to overcome the stabilization issue for 1T-MoS2 and for this purpose, the mixed-phase structurally-stable 1T/2H-MoS2 system has been integrated through phase engineering, in which the 1T-MoS2 phase is stabilized by the incorporation of the 2H phase of MoS2 in a single-phase reaction.23,28,29 Literature studies have revealed that by shifting one of the S-layers in the 〈2100〉 direction by a/√3, both the 2H and 1T phases of MoS2 can be converted into each other. It has also been seen that 2D-MoS2 in its mixed phase exhibited homogeneous characteristics with the matching lattice of both the 1T and 2H phases.30 Indeed, in the mixed-phase of MoS2 (including both 1T and 2H), the 1T phase provides better conductivity as it has more active sites in it and the interaction of the 2H phase in it helps the metastable 1T phase to stabilize, thus avoid restacking and getting transformed into the 2H phase.23 The combination of both types of semi-metallic as well as metallic phases provides more electron transfer from the edge- and basal plane-induced active sites for photo-electrocatalytic performances. Moreover, the involvement of the metallic 1T-phase into the semiconducting 2H-phase increases the synergistic effect between these two phases, which could enhance the potential efficiency of the mixed-phase 2D-MoS2 in various fields.24,31 In terms of photocatalysis, 2H-MoS2 serves as a good photosensitizer due to the semiconducting nature of MoS2 with a suitable bandgap while due to its metallic nature, 1T-MoS2 could act as an excellent co-catalytic center.32 Inspired by the advantageous individual properties of the 1T and 2H phases and the combined properties of the two phases till now, a large number of studies regarding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, pollutant abatement, and energy storage over mixed-phase 2D-MoS2 have been reported.29,31,33–35
At present, although a large number of a comprehensive review articles on 2H-MoS2 and 1T-MoS2 including synthesis and various application towards energy and environmental applications have been reported, still, there is no particular review describing the development of mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 in an environment-friendly way with a wide range of application. In this light, herein, we represent a state-of-the-art idea that covers the areas from synthesis to application. In the first section of the review, we have discussed the various synthetic procedures for the synthesis of mixed-phase 1T/2H MoS2. Then, we have focused on several applications such as energy conversion, energy storage, and pollutant abatement. Diverse studies mainly focused on hydrogen evolution by both photocatalysis as well as electrocatalysis, supercapacitor, batteries such as lithium-ion battery and lithium–sulphur battery, organic as well as inorganic pollutant degradation. Finally, herein, we have put forward our perspectives on the recent opportunities and challenges in the research and development of the 1T/2H MoS2 system towards a wide-ranging performance.
2. Structural and electronic properties of 1T and 2H-MoS2
In accordance with the filling of electrons in the d orbitals of Mo atoms, followed by the coordination between sulphur and the central molybdenum atoms and the order of atomic stacking, there are three natural or synthetic polytypes of MoS2, namely, 1T, 2H, and 3R.36–38 The number (1, 2, 3) signifies the layers present in a single crystallographic unit cell and the alphabet reveals about the structure of the crystal, where H, T, and R stand for hexagonal, trigonal, and rhombohedral, respectively (Fig. 1a).36,39 2H and 3R are semiconducting phases with trigonal prismatic co-ordination around the Mo atom with two S–Mo–S and three S–Mo–S units per elemental cell, respectively. In other words, 1T is a metallic phase, in which the molybdenum atoms are octahedrally coordinated by the sulphur and molybdenum atoms to form a unit cell.

Copyright 2019 Elsevier). 
Briefly, as shown in Fig. 1b, 2H-MoS2 is hexagonally stacked with the AbA BaB AbA (upper case is used for S atoms whereas lower case represents the Mo atoms) order of stacking and so on through trigonal prismatic coordination in between molybdenum and sulphur atoms, in which six sulphur atoms surround each molybdenum atom.39 From the figure, it has also been noted that there are strong chemical bond that exists between the atoms and weak van der Waals forces between the layers.40 Also, the interlayer spacing in 2H-MoS2 is 0.615 nm, which makes the intercalation of guest ions or species easier.16,27 In contrast, 1T-MoS2 is metastable and quite different from the 2H-phase of MoS2. As depicted in Fig. 1b, 1T-MoS2 has the stacking order of AbC AbC AbC (Mo and S atoms are represented by lower and upper cases, respectively) and so on. The undistorted single layer of 1T-MoS2 is also a hexagonal molybdenum lattice that lies in between two layers of sulphur atoms in an octahedral fashion and are offset from each other, and the sulphur atoms are uniformly distributed in an octahedral fashion around the molybdenum atoms, making strong contrast between the molybdenum and sulphur sites.16,36
From the electron filling concept derived from crystal filled theory (CFT), it should be noted that the 2H phase of MoS2 is a semiconductor having 1.2 eV as the indirect bandgap, possessing diamagnetic behavior.39 According to CFT, the 4d orbitals of the Mo atom for 2H-MoS2 are split into three sets by occupying two electrons at the lowest 4dz2 orbital under the influence of a trigonal prismatic ligand, leading to diamagnetism characteristics. The conduction band (CB) is derived when the degenerate dx2−y2 and dxy orbitals of Mo atoms overlap with the empty antibonding sp orbitals of the sulphur atoms, whereas the valence band (VB) of 2H-MoS2 is originated from the overlapping of the filled dz2 of the Mo atom with the filled sp orbitals of the sulphur atoms (Fig. 1c).40 Noteworthily, the wide gap between the dz2 (VB) and dxy, dx2−y2 (CB) orbitals make it a semiconducting material after mixing with the s orbitals.41 In contrast, due to the octahedral co-coordination, 1T-MoS2 exhibits metallic and paramagnetic behavior. Similar to 2H-MoS2, under the influence of an octahedral field, 1T-MoS2 is split into two sets of degenerate orbitals, i.e., t2g (dxy, dxz, dzx) and eg (dx2−y2, dz2), resulting in the filling of two electrons in the t2g set by leaving one vacant orbital (Fig. 1c). The presence of a vacant orbital makes 1T-MoS2 metallic. Studies have predicted that 1T-MoS2 has a similar electronic structure as that of the metal, possessing no bandgap in it. However, it has been found that during the synthetic process of 1T/2H MoS2, the extra electron provided from the intercalating agent may stabilize the octahedral coordination of 1T-MoS2, followed by the destabilization of 2H-MoS2 and due to the destabilization, 2H-MoS2 is partly converted into 1T-MoS2, resulting in 1T/2H-MoS2 (Fig. 1d).39 As shown in Fig. 1e, near the Γ point, the CB and VB were found to be a linear combination of d and pz orbitals of molybdenum atoms and sulphur atoms, respectively. Generally, both VB and CB bands are composed of d-orbitals of Mo only at the K point and are located in the middle of the S–Mo–S units. Sulphur atoms have stronger interlayer coupling in comparison to molybdenum atoms and lead to a direct bandgap structure at the K point when the thickness of the layer decreases.41 In other words, the indirect bandgap properties develop from the top of the valence band situated at the Γ point to the bottom of the conduction band situated midway between the Γ and K points. Due to the quantum confinement effect, the indirect bandgap increases with the decrease in the number of layers (Fig. 1e). As seen in the figure for single-layer MoS2, the indirect bandgap becomes larger than the direct bandgap at the K point. As the number of layers decreases, the MoS2 changes from a bulk indirect bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.2 eV to a 2D direct bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.9 eV. Liu et al. predicted that the mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 acts as a cocatalyst, exhibiting conductor characteristics as during the intercalation process, newly introduced energy bands derived from 1T-MoS2 are located near the pristine gap of 2H-MoS2 (Fig. 1f).33
3. Synthesis and characterization approach for 1T/2H MoS2
3.1 Characterization of mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2
In order to exemplify the change in the properties during phase transformation from 2H to 1T-MoS2 along with the detection of the contents of 1T-MoS2 in the mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2, it is inevitable to incorporate the characterization strategies of mixed-phase MoS2. For this purpose, out of various methods, the widely-used powerful characterization techniques include X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and Raman spectroscopy.
XRD gives us information regarding the crystal structure and crystal size along with crystalline phase and phase purity. Phase transformation from the semiconducting (2H) phase to the metallic (1T) phase has a great effect on the crystal structure of the host materials as the intercalation as well as the heat treatment during the exfoliation method enlarge the interlayer spacing between the layers of the material, which is exploited by the XRD pattern. However, the XRD spectra of mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 can only be estimated with a comparison to that of bulk 2H-MoS2.15 In particular, in this case, the (002) peak at 14.4° of 2H-MoS2 exhibited peak splitting, thus resulting in two new XRD peaks at lower and higher 2θ angles, suggesting the expansion of the interlayer spacing, which is a sign of the formation of 1T/2H-MoS2.27 Zhang et al.34 developed ultrafine monolayer 1T/2H-MoS2 and its successful implantation in the 1T phase was checked by the XRD pattern given in Fig. 2a. As seen in Fig. 2a, the XRD peaks were found at 31.9°, 43.3°, and 56.8°, which are associated with the (100), (103), and (110) planes of MoS2, respectively. For the (002) plane of 2H-MoS2, the characteristic peak was not found at ∼14.4°, rather the peak was observed at 10.2°, possessing an expansion in between the layers. As calculated, the interlayer spacing of the as-prepared MoS2 was about 0.87 nm, which is much greater than that of 2H-MoS2 with 0.62 nm spacing. Also, the larger interlayer spacing of 0.87 nm comes from 1T-MoS2, which reveals the presence of both 1T and 2H phases in the as-synthesized MoS2 sample.

(d) HRTEM image of 1T/2H-MoS2 and (e) the Raman spectrum of 1T/2H-MoS2 (Reproduced with permission from ref. 42. Copyright©2020, American Chemical Society). 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface technique employed to measure the empirical formula, chemical state, elemental composition, as well as the electronic state of the elements contained in the given material. Since the mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 contains both the trigonal prismatic (2H-MoS2) and octahedral (1T-MoS2) co-ordination structure, it possesses different atomic states for Mo and S, having different binding energies.15,16 It should be pointed out that about ∼0.5–0.9 eV binding energy difference is observed between the atomic state of 2H-MoS2 and 1T-MoS2.15 In addition, it has also been confirmed that XPS is a suitable strategy for the estimation of the concentration of 1T and 2H in the mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2. Qi and his co-workers,30 as reported above, have synthesized 1T@2H-MoS2 and were further verified for determining the formation of the 1T phase and its relative content in heterogenous MoS2 nanosheets through the XPS technique. According to the XPS spectra for 2H-MoS2, the peaks were observed at about 220 and 233 eV, corresponding to the binding energies of Mo4+ 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 electrons being shifted towards the lower energy side by 0.5 eV (Fig. 2b). Similarly, new peaks were also observed in addition to the known doublet peaks for the S 2p region of 2H-MoS2 at 163.8 and 162.7 eV corresponding to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2, respectively (Fig. 2c). The deconvolution of XPS peaks for Mo and S proves the presence of additional peaks along with initial peaks of 2H-MoS2 and these changes in the peaks reveal the formation of the 1T phase.
HRTEM provides the direct crystallographic structural image of the materials at an atomic scale. The HRTEM image formation relies on phase contrast. Both kinds of co-ordination environments present in the 1T/2H-MoS2 can be easily illustrated from the HRTEM fringes. Zong et al.42 designed monolayer 1T@2H-MoS2 (ML-MoS2) by incorporating the 1T phase into 2H-MoS2 by lithium-ion intercalation–exfoliation method. To verify the success of this strategy, many characterizations along with HRTEM and Raman spectroscopy were conducted. The HRTEM image depicted by Fig. 2d displays two distinct lattice regions, i.e., trigonal lattice area with octahedral coordination in the 1T phase (area under yellow square) and honeycomb lattice area for trigonal prismatic coordination of the 2H phase (area under green squares) with blue and yellow dots, representing the Mo and S atoms, respectively.
Raman spectroscopy involves the interaction of light with the chemical bonds present in a material and it behaves as a tool to identify the formation of the phases of the crystal by the lattice vibrations. It deals with the interaction between light and chemical bonds within the material. The generation of the 1T-phase along with 2H-MoS2 in mixed-phase MoS2 can be easily identified by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra for the sample monolayer 1T@2H-MoS2 (ML-MoS2) also verified the successful partial implantation of the 1T phase in 2H-MoS2.42 The Raman measurements shown in Fig. 2e reveal three signals in the lower frequency region, i.e., 160 cm−1, 238 cm−1, and 336 cm−1 for J1, J2, and J3 vibrational modes, respectively, corresponding to the 1T-MoS2, whereas the peaks at 306 cm−1 and 405 cm−1 corresponding to E1g and A1g are observed for 2H-MoS2 in the heterostructure ML-MoS2, thereby indicating the presence of both 1T and 2H phases in the as-prepared sample.
3.2 Synthetic methods of 1T/2H-MoS2
Keeping in mind the intriguing properties of the 1T phase MoS2 along with its contrasting unstable nature, different strategies have been introduced to fabricate 1T-incorporated 2H-MoS2, resulting in mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2, in which the 1T phase is automatically stabilized throughout the reaction. Generally, the synthetic procedures of 1T/2H-MoS2 mainly involve the partial transformation of 2H-MoS2 into 1T-MoS2 under mild conditions, adopting various reaction techniques. However, there are two distinct categories under which the different synthetic procedures for 1T/2H-MoS2 are mainly classified, i.e., top-down and bottom-up approaches, which are elaborately discussed in the following section. Scheme 1 given below illustrates the reported methods for the synthesis of 1T/2H-MoS2.
 Scheme 1  Different reported top-down and bottom-up approaches resulting in the formation of 1T/2H-MoS2. 

3.2.1 Top-down approach towards 1T/2H-MoS2. 
The most widely used top-down techniques for the synthesis of 1T/2H-MoS2 are the chemical intercalation process, electrochemical intercalation process, supercritical CO2-assisted exfoliation, mechanical ball milling, and the introduction of sulphur vacancies through gas treatment. In most of the cases, MoS2 heterostructured with both the 1T and 2H phases is obtained from the direct exfoliation of bulk 2H MoS2. Because of the weak van der Waals interaction between the MoS2 layers, different guest species such as ions or molecules intercalate into the MoS2 layers and permit interlayer expansion, thereby improving the performance. Moreover, the intercalation of MoS2 with metal ion or electron donor molecules can partially change the phase structure from 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 by the ejection of numerous electrons during the reaction.
3.2.1.1 Chemical intercalation. 
Amidst the different top-down methodologies, exfoliation by chemical intercalation of alkali metals in order to achieve MoS2 heterostructures with both the 1T and 2H phases has been a widely used and is a remarkable technique.43,44 Since MoS2 is a layered material, it provides ease of intercalation of the intercalants into the MoS2 lattice and facilitates phase transformation of MoS2 from the 2H to the 1T phase by electron transfer. Two steps are involved in this method: the first is the intercalation of alkali metal ions in between the layers of MoS2, thereby extending and weakening the gap between the layers. In the second step, the ions present in the intercalated MoS2 releases hydrogen gas when subjected to reaction with water, resulting in layer separation, forming single sheet layers.1,15 The exfoliation process by alkali metal intercalation must be done in an inert gas secured atmosphere because of the high pyrophoric nature of the intercalants in air.
Li et al.45 successfully fabricated interlayer expanded 1T/2H-MoS2 nanospheres by the hydrothermal method with the intercalation of sodium ion at different temperatures. Among these, the Na+-intercalated 1T/2H-MoS2 at 160 °C exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic efficiency. The SEM images in Fig. 3a–c exhibit the flower-like nanospheres of the MoS2 samples (i.e., Na-M/S-160, Na-M/S-180 and Na-M/S-200), showing that the size of the nanospheres increases with an increase in the reaction temperature (160 °C to 180 °C) in the range of 1–2 μm, thereby indicating an increase in the growth of the MoS2 nanospheres due to high temperature. Fig. 3d–f shows the HRTEM image of Na-M/S-160, Na-M/S-180, and Na-M/S-200, respectively. The trigonal lattice structure of octahedral co-ordination is due to the 1T phase of, as shown in Fig. 2d, and its inset on the top right corner reveals the interlayer spacing of ∼0.95 nm, indicating the presence of Na+. Fig. 2e displays two distinct lattice regions, i.e., a trigonal lattice and honeycomb lattice attributed to the 1T and 2H phases, respectively. A honeycomb lattice structure is seen in Fig. 3f and its top right inset shows a lattice spacing of ∼0.64 nm, which is attributed to the 2H phase of MoS2. From the above given data, it is concluded that the phase in MoS2 gets transformed to 2H from the 1T phase with the increase in temperature from 160 °C to 200 °C.

Eda et al.46 synthesized lithium-intercalated heterogeneous MoS2 using butyl lithium solution in hexane in the presence of Ar gas for 2 days. In particular, due to the intercalation of lithium ion, the metallic phase of MoS2 appears, thereby showing partial disappearance of the semiconducting phase. Fig. 3a shows the XPS spectra of S 2s, S 2p, and Mo 3d regions of the samples at different temperatures. Two peaks at about 229 and 232 eV of the Mo 3d spectrum, along with the shifting of the additional peaks to lower binding energies by ∼0.9 eV, are observed corresponding to 2H-MoS2. Besides the known doublet peaks for 2H-MoS2, two additional peaks are also revealed by the S 2p region appearing at 163 and 161.9 eV. The additional peaks shift parallelly, suggesting their origin from the 1T phase. As seen in Fig. 4a, after a certain temperature, i.e., above 100 °C, the peaks corresponding to the 1T phase are gradually quenched. No peak is observed at about 236 eV, which shows the less oxidation of Mo, and the absence of peaks between 168 and 170 eV indicates the unoxidized S atoms. Fig. 4b shows the extracted phase compositions, indicating that nearly equal amounts of both the phases are present in the as-prepared samples. It is also noticeable that the 2H phase increases with an increase in the temperature and reaches 0.95 at 300 °C.

Going through so many literature studies, undoubtedly, it has been deduced that the partial phase transformation from the 2H to 1T phase takes place by alkali metal ions (Li+, K+, Na+) through chemical intercalation processes. But still, it has also been proved recently that the intercalation process with alkali metals is complicated and quite risky to handle as the organo-alkali metals used are highly explosive towards moisture and oxygen at room temperature; also, in a few cases, it causes the full transformation of the 2H phase to the 1T phase.15,16 Thus, the chemical intercalation process should proceed through a technique that is very effective, less time-consuming, and cost-effective.
3.2.1.2 Electrochemical intercalation exfoliation. 
Chemical intercalation exfoliation with extra electric driving force leads to electrochemical intercalation exfoliation. Electrochemical exfoliation is a modified technique for alkali metal ion intercalation in the MoS2 layers, followed by exfoliation in water for the synthesis of mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2. By using MoS2 and alkali metal foil as the cathode and the anode, respectively, a voltaic cell is prepared, which acts as a galvanic cell. The electrochemical intercalation exfoliation method has advantages such as its controllability and efficiency.1 Ejigu et al.47 reported a very simple, time-saving, and cost-effective experimental strategy to generate electrochemically lithium-intercalated exfoliated mixed-phase MoS2 nanosheets within two hours using a Pt mesh and an Li salt such as LiClO4 as the counter electrode and the lithium source, respectively, with no need for a glove box. Fig. 5a and b depicts the Raman spectra making a comparison between the raw bulk 2H-MoS2 and electrochemically Li+-intercalated exfoliated MoS2. Two prominent peaks were observed at 381.9 and 407.4 cm−1 for in-plane (E12g) and out-of-plane (A1g) of bulk 2H-MoS2, respectively, and a sequence of Raman peaks were observed at 155 cm−1 (J1), 227 cm−1 (J2), and 330.5 cm−1 (J3) along with E12g (382.2 cm−1) and A1g (405 cm−1) for the exfoliated material, indicating the formation of the 1T phase. According to the calibration data as reported in the literature, the Raman spectra of the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets for the monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer possess a peak separation of ∼20, ∼22, and ∼23 cm−1, respectively, thereby demonstrating that the as-prepared sample is trilayer since the separation of the peaks occurring between E12g and A1g deteriorated from bulk MoS2 (26 cm−1) to the exfoliated material (23.1 cm−1). The XPS spectra for the bulk and exfoliated MoS2 is given in Fig. 5c–f. Doublet peaks were observed at 229.2 eV and 232.4 eV for the Mo 3d spectra of bulk 2H-MoS2 with respect to Mo4+ 3d5/2 and Mo4+ 3d3/2, respectively, and along with the doublet peaks, two new peaks emerged that were shifted by ∼0.8 eV towards lower binding energies for 2H-MoS2. Similarly, a new pair of peaks was noticed for the S 2p spectra at lower binding energies of 161.5 eV (S 2p3/2) and 162.7 eV (S 2p1/2). The origin of the new pair of peaks in the XPS spectrum proves the formation of the 1T phase with 60% concentration of the 1T phase. Electron transfer from lithium ion into the unoccupied 4d orbitals in the CB of the Mo cations occurs with ease due to intercalation, resulting in partial structural change from semiconducting to metallic nature.

3.2.1.3 Supercritical CO2-assisted exfoliation. 
For the preparation of 1T/2H-MoS2, some hydrothermal methods also come under the top-down approach, in which the reaction proceeds through a two-step hydrothermal method. In this case, the 2H MoS2 is firstly prepared from its precursor (Mo and S) elements, followed by exfoliation, causing phase transformation under suitable reaction treatment. Qi and his co-workers30 developed a methodology for preparing a two-dimensional heterostructure of mixed-phase MoS2 nanosheets with the assistance of supercritical CO2 (SC CO2)-induced phase engineering method by passing CO2 to the desired pressure under stirring. According to the results of the experiment, the partial conversion of 2H-MoS2 lattices into the 1T phase is initiated by the introduction of CO2 in 2H-MoS2. The electrical coupling and synergistic effects between the 1T and 2H phases enhance the transfer of an electron from the active sites of 2H-MoS2 to the 1T phase in the heterostructure and efficiently decreases the recombination of photogenerated charges, thereby improving its photocatalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 6a, the overall synthetic mechanism involves the exfoliation of the bulk MoS2 into the monolayers and few layered MoS2 nanosheets, followed by the impregnation of CO2 in between the layers of MoS2. The adsorbed CO2 in the interlayer of the MoS2 nanosheets partially converts the 2H phase into the 1T phase, resulting in the formation of 1T/2H-MoS2 heterostructures with a matching lattice. By using DFT calculation, one can deduce stronger adsorption energy of CO2 on the monolayer 1T-MoS2 in comparison to that on single-layer 2H-MoS2, indicating the stability of 1T-MoS2 nanosheets due to CO2 adsorption. The effect of SC CO2 on the formation of the in-plane 1T@2H-MoS2 nanosheets proceeds through strained sulphur vacancies on the basal plane, as observed in Fig. 6c. The HRTEM image in Fig. 6d represents the lateral heterostructure 1T@2H-MoS2 with two kinds of co-ordination, i.e., octahedral coordination for the IT phase with a tetragonal lattice and trigonal prismatic coordination for the 2H phase with a common honeycomb lattice. After the incorporation of CO2, the color of dispersed 1T/2H MoS2 is dark blue as compared to that of 2H-MoS2 (yellow-green); thus, the 1T/2H MoS2 nanosheet can effectively absorb photons in the full spectral range of visible light, resulting in superior catalytic activity (Fig. 6e). Fig. 6f displays the Raman spectra of the 1T/2H MoS2 nanosheet, showing peaks at 283, 379, and 404 cm−1 for 2H-MoS2 along with additional peaks observed at 149, 218, and 327 cm−1 concerning the phonon modes of 1T-MoS2, revealing the presence of the 1T phase in the heterostructure.

3.2.1.4 Microwave-assisted exfoliation. 
Similar to SC-CO2 induced phase engineering, some experimental studies regarding mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 have manifested that instead of using facile hydrothermal treatment, microwave-treated hydrothermal technique has also a great effect in increasing the 1T concentration in the hybrid mixed phase. In this regard, ammonium molybdate [(NH4)6Mo7O24·H2O] is taken as the Mo source instead of using other precursors since this precursor provides the NH4+ ion itself by decomposition under hydrothermal treatment. It should be noted that as compared to conventional hydrothermal method, microwave-assisted hydrothermal method has emerged as the most convenient and time-consuming method, producing high-quality mixed-phase MoS2 with a high content of the 1T-MoS2 phase. Liu et al.24 developed 1T@2H-MoS2 nanospheres, adopting microwave-assisted hydrothermal method using ammonium molybdate, thiourea, and deionized water as the solvent; for comparison, simple hydrothermal method has also been implemented with the same proportion of the Mo and S precursor. Both kinds of treatment follow a two-step hydrothermal method and are regulated at the same temperature, i.e., 220 °C with varying reaction time. The microwave-assisted method required very less time, i.e., about 10 min and 4 min, for the first and second step, respectively, whereas, it is 24 h and 10 h for the simple hydrothermal method. The proposed synthetic route depicted in Fig. 7a predicted that microwave irradiation has two effects on the synthesis of 1T/2H-MoS2. Firstly, because of the microwave dipole rotation, the weak van der Waals forces existing among the layers of MoS2 get destroyed and their interlayer spacing is increased to 9.78 Å. Secondly, the ammonium ions enter into the MoS2 interlayers non-uniformly, making the lattice unstable for phase transformation from 2H to 1T (Fig. 7b). As we have already discussed that there are three groups (dxz, dyz), (dxy, dx2y2), and (dz2) of electrons in the 4d orbital of Mo in the 2H phase, among which the (dz2) orbital is filled with electrons, leaving other orbitals empty and leading to the stability of the phase structure (Fig. 7c). After exposure to microwave radiation, the ammonium ions entering in the matrix cause an electron to occupy the (dxy, dx2y2) orbital partially, thereby reducing its stability and facilitating phase conversion from the 2H phase to the 1T phase. Among the two groups (dx2y2, dz2) and (dxy, dxz, dyz) of the 1T phase, the electrons of Mo get occupied in two out of the three degenerate orbitals (dxy, dxz, dyz). As a result, the addition of an electron causes an increase in the phase stability since the three degenerate orbitals are filled. The interaction between MoS2 and ammonium ions results in the weakening of the top Mo–S bond, leading to phase conversion from the 2H to 1T phase because of lattice instability. The XRD data, as reported in the paper for the 1T@2H-MoS2 sample, shows an interlayer spacing of 9.78 Å, which is 3.45 Å larger than that of the standard sample and also confirms that the microwave treated method is beneficial for the production of high-quality 1T/2H-MoS2 with high crystallinity because of the quick heating and cooling of microwave treatment. Liu et al.31 in his previously reported work also prepared 1T/2H-MoS2 by adopting the microwave hydrothermal method with the same reaction conditions and found a high-quality spherical flower-like MoS2. According to the HRTEM data produced by Liu et al. for 1T@2H-MoS2, two distinct lattice regions are observed: one is the common honeycomb structure with trigonal prismatic coordination for the 2H phase and the other is octahedral coordination of the 1T phase with a zigzag chain-like structure.

3.2.1.5 Inducing sulfur vacancies. 
Apart from alkali metal ion intercalation and assisted exfoliation, mixed vapor technique is another strategy to produce mixed-phase MoS2 through S-vacancy, which produces local strain engineering that partially converts the 1T phase. In this instance, Wang et al.48 synthesized the in-plane 1T@2H-MoS2 heterostructure through the simple one-pot annealing treatment of bulk 2H-MoS2 using a mixture of Ar gas and phosphorous vapor. Phosphorus not only enters into the interlayer of the bulk 2H-MoS2, causing the expansion of MoS2, but also gets attached to the lattice of MoS2, thus initiating partial phase conversion from 2H phase MoS2 to 1T phase MoS2. The as-prepared in-plane 1T–2H MoS2 heterostructure possesses better electrical conductivity and rich active sites along with the hydrophilic nature, which are beneficial for the high-speed transmission of an electron as well as an ion. The two procedures for the synthesis of in-plane 1T–2H MoS2 are represented in Fig. 8a. The first step involves the use of red phosphorous vapor under the protection of Ar atmosphere for the annealing of bulk 2H-MoS2 at a high temperature of 1000 °C, which increases the interlayer spacing between the MoS2 layers in the bulk. Secondly, the expanded MoS2 was exfoliated into the atomic planes via the ultrasonication method in isopropyl alcohol. The HRTEM images (Fig. 8b) demonstrated the presence of two distinct lattice regions, i.e., hexagonal region with two crystal planes (100 and 010) for 2H-MoS2 and trigonal lattice with (101) planes suggested for 1T-MoS2. The presence of variable lattice plane indicates the partial transformation of 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 during annealing treatment. The area under red circles and rectangles in Fig. 8c manifested some defects and crystalline deformations, respectively, which possibly occur due to high-temperature annealing and phosphorus doping. From further studies, Yang et al.49 in their work implemented Ar treatment by the depletion of sulphur from the MoS2 flake, leading to phase conversion from the 2H phase (low spin) to the partial 1T phase (high spin) and alternatively used oxygen treatment, in which phase transition was driven by the desorption of S atoms at the edge of MoS2. In the treatment of argon, the conversion of phase mainly occurred due to the formation of the ferromagnetic phase, whereas phase transformation governed by O2 leads to the development of vacancies under the physical relaxation mechanism. The temperature maintained for the reaction was 200 °C for 30 min for both Ar and O2 treatment on MoS2. Fig. 8d schematically represents the 1T-/2H phase engineering of pristine MoS2 by Ar and O2 treatment concerning ferromagnetism and sulphur vacancy mechanism.

Copyright©2015, American Chemical Society). 
The advantage of S-vacancy has been extensively used in other reported work. Cai et al.50 proposed a two-step hydrothermal synthetic procedure to introduce sulphur vacancies (Vs) into the 2H-MoS2 nanosheet for the successful incorporation of the 1T phase into the matrix of 2H-MoS2, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 8e. Getting control over the formation of the sulphur vacancies in the 2H-MoS2 nanosheets is an important step in this synthesis. Here, the part played by the sulphur vacancies is identical to that of Li+ in lithiated MoS2, which undergoes phase transition from 2H to 1T. The HRTEM image in Fig. 8f verified the successful implantation of metallic 1T-MoS2 in 2H phase MoS2, leading to the formation of 1T/2H-MoS2. The reaction conditions were maintained at 220 °C for 8 h. The HRTEM image suggested two distinct lattice regions with 0.27 nm as the lattice fringes and the trigonal lattice area (octahedral coordination) of the 1T phase and the honeycomb lattice area (trigonal prismatic coordination) of the 2H phase.
3.2.1.6 Electron injection. 
Apart from these preparations, Cai et al.51 fabricated the 1T/2H-MoS2 electrocatalyst via the two-step hydrothermal synthetic strategy with a high concentration of the 1T phase of 50% using graphene oxide template, which impressively increases the charge concentration and triples the active surface sites, showing successful hydrogen evolution reaction. They also synthesized 1T/2H-MoS2 nanosheets with less concentration of the 1T phase without the use of graphene oxide template in the same method of preparation. The reaction conditions maintained for both the above processes is 220 °C for 6 h. For comparison, they also prepared 2H-MoS2 nanosheets from the bulk MoS2 and labelled it as ex-MoS2 using liquid ultrasonic exfoliation. RGO is chosen as a template as it efficiently donates electrons to initiate phase transformation from the 2H to 1T phase in MoS2.
3.2.1.7 Mechanical ball milling. 
Mechanical ball milling is a kind of grinding strategies that is used as a preliminary treatment of the bulk MoS2 to obtain small-sized MoS2, followed by lithiation–exfoliation method, resulting in the formation of QDs. However, Cheng et al.52 reported the mechanically-induced partial phase transformation of MoS2 from the semiconducting stable 2H to the metallic metastable 1T phase by the ball milling method for several hours (2 h, 5 h, and 10 h) at room temperature without any additives. With the increase in the ball milling time, the size of MoS2 decreases. Fig. 9a displays the HAADF-STEM image of the 5 h ball-milled MoS2 to evaluate the successful implantation of the 1T phase. This image provides evidence regarding the formation of mixed-phase MoS2, thereby demonstrating the presence of two distinct lattice regions, i.e., honeycomb and hexagonal lattice structure for the 2H and 1T phase, respectively. The XPS spectrum given in Fig. 9b shows the binding energies of 228.25, 231.45, 161.0, and 162.2 eV for Mo 3d5/2, Mo 3d3/2, S 2p3/2, and S 2p1/2 of the 1T phase and 229.05, 232.25, 161.8, and 163.0 eV for the 2H phase, respectively, identifying the 1T and 2H phase contents in the ball-milled MoS2. Here, 1T-MoS2 is downshifted by 0.8 eV in comparsion to 2H-MoS2. The calculated percentage of the 1T phase from the XPS data (0%, 8%, 16%, and 20% for bulk MoS2, MoS2-bm-2 h, MoS2-bm-5 h, and MoS2-bm-10 h, respectively) reveals an increase in the content of the 1T phase with an increase in the ball milling time. The features of 1T/2H-MoS2 prepared by Li+ intercalation exfoliation are quite different from mechanically-induced mixed MoS2. With regards to the thickness, exfoliated MoS2 forms few layers while mechanically-induced MoS2 forms 23–35 layers. As a result, in the Raman spectra, the distance between the E12g and A1g peaks for exfoliated MoS2 is 24 cm−1 but for MoS2-bm-10 h, it is 25.8 cm−1.

3.2.2 Bottom-up approach. 
The bottom-up approach is a one-step synthetic route, in which the mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 is directly prepared from the Mo and S molecular precursor via the low-temperature solvo/hydrothermal technique under the influence of various solvents or other additive reagents. Throughout the different literature studies, instead of metal intercalation, e.g., alkali metal, other intercalating agents that have a pivotal role towards 1T/2H MoS2 are mainly propanoic acid, NH3, NH4CO3, and NH4OH, which are taken into consideration.23,27,29 However, the experimental conditions suggested that the partial phase conversion from the 2H phase to the 1T phase via the introduction of ammonia-like materials other than alkali metals involves the bottom-up approach since the process is a single-phase reaction. Hence, such type of synthetic procedures are elaborately explained in this section.
In this regard, the choice of solvents is from water, ethanol, DMF, etc., and various additive reagents such as propanoic acid, NH3, NH4OH, NH4CO3, etc. Generally, during reaction, NH4+ ion, CO2, etc., are produced from the additive reagents and the interlayer stacking of 2H-MoS2 is expanded, resulting in a distorted structure of 2H-MoS2. As a result, the driving energy develops from the distortion energy that initiates the formation of the 1T phase, thus resulting in mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 in a one-step reaction.
3.2.2.1 Hydrothermal method. 
Hydrothermal method is the most commonly used method for the synthesis of both semiconducting MoS2 as well as mixed-phase MoS2 and few examples of this method are given here. Wang et al.27 prepared a swollen ammoniated IT/2H-MoS2 (MoS2-A), i.e., a hybrid phase with a high yield of ca. 60% via ammonium-assisted hydrothermal method using ammonia as an intercalating agent. The reaction condition was maintained at 200 °C for only 13 h. Because of the inclusion of high concentration of the 1T phase, the as-prepared hybrid sample exhibits higher activity, better electrical conductivity, and greater ability to introduce the ions of the electrolyte, forming an excellent electrode material for supercapacitor devices. The composition as well as the increase in the interlayer distance by the introduction of NH4+ ion was confirmed from the XRD pattern. As shown in Fig. 10a, the splitting of the (002) reflection peak, which is the characteristic peak of 2H-MoS2 at 14.4°, into two diffraction peaks, i.e., (001)* and (002)* located at 8.9° and 18.0°, respectively, suggested the formation of the interlayer spacing and 1T/2H mixed-phase MoS2. As calculated from Scherrer equation (Fig. 10b), the interlayer spacing of MoS2-A is found to be 0.99 nm, which is larger in comparison to that of 2H-MoS2 (0.615 nm). An additional interlayer distance of 0.375 nm was obtained, which is closer to the size of the NH4+ ion (0.35 nm), thereby indicating the successful preparation of ammoniated MoS2. The swollen lamellar structure of ammoniated MoS2 allows the ions of the electrolyte to get to the redox-active sites with ease, leading to an increase in the electrochemical capacity. Besides, the presence of NH4+ ion was confirmed from the DSC and TGA results, as shown in Fig. 10c. From the results, two remarkable mass loss endothermic peaks were confined to the release of water, NH3, and NH4+ ion along with one distinct exothermic peak, which are ascribed to the structure conversion from 1T/2H-MoS2 to 2H-MoS2 under high-temperature annealing. It should be pointed out that the introduction of the 1T phase changes the electronic structure of 2H-MoS2, thus resulting in 1T/2H-MoS2 and which can be remarkably elucidated from the XPS spectra (Fig. 10d and e). The XPS measurement of 1T/2H-MoS2 predicted the presence of two sets of spin-splitting spectra for both Mo 3d and S 2p, which suggested the presence of both the 2H and 1T phases; it has also been seen that the peak obtained for 1T-MoS2 was downshifted as compared to that of the 2H-MoS2 phase. The N XPS spectra from Fig. 10f confirms the presence of the intercalating agent, i.e., NH4+, and the concentration of the 1T phase was calculated to be 60% for this condition, which is higher than that for the lithium intercalation process.

In addition, Liu and co-workers29 also fabricated 1T/2H MoS2 nanosheets through the one-step hydrothermal reaction, followed by propionic acid as the intercalating agent. The reaction condition is maintained to be 180 °C under a very short period, i.e., for only 4 h. The schematic representation of the overall reaction, as compared to 2H MoS2, is illustrated in Fig. 11a; from the experimental condition, it has been concluded that mixed-phase MoS2 preparation is time consuming as compared to 2H-MoS2 since it takes 24 h for formation. As expected, these 1T/2H MoS2 heterogenous nanosheets showed outstanding catalytic performance and also the inclusion of the 1T phase in this nanostructure increases the reaction rate. Along with the high catalytic behavior, the mixed-phase MoS2, i.e., 1T/2H-MoS2, also shows greater stability due to the presence of a multi-layered structure with defects and amorphous regions. This synthetic path is cost-efficient, gives high yield, and is quite scalable. Here, the raw materials used are of less cost and the hydrothermal method is easy to be carried out. The above-mentioned fact proves that the as-prepared mixed-phase nanosheets (i.e., 1T/2H-MoS2 nanosheets) are competitive earth-abundant electrocatalysts. Fig. 11c provides the TEM image, indicating that the 1T/2H-MoS2 sample contains ultrathin nanosheets having a width and thickness of about 100–200 nm and 10 nm, respectively. Liu et al.29 proposed a possible reduction strategy to explain the mechanism behind the synthesis of the 1T phase, which includes the reduction of Mo(VI) to Mo(IV), followed by sulfurization. Typically, the precursors of Mo and S, i.e., Na2MoO4·2H2O and CS(NH2)2, respectively, were dissolved in a mixed solvent of water and propionic acid, maintaining the ratio of 2:1 at room temperature. Propionic acid acts as an important element in the hydrothermal system as it provides an acidic environment, which is responsible for the reduction of thiourea, leading to the formation of Mo(IV) from Mo(VI) in accordance with eqn (1). SC(NH2)2 + 8H+ + MoO42− → Mo4+ + S↓ + 2H2O + 2NH4+ + CO2↑(1)During the course of the reaction, octahedrally-coordinated MoO6 intermediate species are formed, which are closely related to the occurrence of 1T MoS2. During the subsequent sulfurization process, the S2− ligands were replaced to substitute O2− in MoO6, retaining the same structure, i.e., octahedral coordination, resulting in the formation of 1T-phase MoS2 (Fig. 11b). It should be noted that the change in the ratio of the solvent, i.e., propionic acid to water, has a great effect on the concentration of 1T phase MoS2. It has been seen that when the ratio between H2O:propanoic acid is 2:1, 1:2, and 5:1, the concentration of the 1T phase is 72%, 70%, and 43%, respectively, as calculated from the XPS spectra (Fig. 11d), which indicates that propionic acid is the only parameter that regulates the concentration of 1T-MoS2 in the 1T/2H-MoS2 heterostructure.

Wang et al.23 prepared the 1T/2H-MoS2 catalyst by a simple hydrothermal method using a certain quantity of NH4HCO3. The 1T phase was introduced by the insertion of guest ions and molecules, including NH4+, CO2, and H2O, into the lamellar structure of MoS2, resulting in the formation of multiphasic 1T/2H-MoS2. The 1T phase concentration can be checked by adjusting the synthesis temperature and the effect required a temperature of 200 °C, resulting in a high concentration of the 1T phase. The presence of the 1T phase increases the conductivity, thereby activating more surfaces, resulting in excellent HER performances. 1T/2H-MoS2 was annealed at 400 °C for 2 h under Ar to eliminate the inserted species as well as an expansion of the lamellar structures to verify the role of the NH4+ ion. As shown in the XRD pattern in Fig. 11e, a sharp diffraction peak was observed at 14.4°, which is similar to that of standard 2H-MoS2 and also the interlayer distance is reduced to 6.2 Å, which is nearer to that of crystalline 2H-MoS2 (6.15 Å).
According to the study of Shi et al.,53 1T phase-induced 2H-MoS2 nanosheets were obtained by a two-step hydrothermal treatment. Sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4) and thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2) were taken as the molybdenum and sulphur sources, respectively, for the synthesis of the 2H-MoS2 samples. Then, the obtained product, i.e., 2H-MoS2 nanosheets, were subjected to further autoclaved treatment at various time periods, i.e., for 4 h or 8 h for the transition of the local lattice of the 2H phase of MoS2 into the 1T-MoS2 phase, thereby leading to the synthesis of the 1T@2H-MoS2 nanosheets (called 1T@2H MoS2-4 h and 1T@2H-MoS2-8 h). The above process is a double-step procedure. The first step was the synthesis of 2H-MoS2 nanosheets with sulphur vacancies. Then, the second step involved ultrasonication in an ethanol solution of the defect-related 2H-MoS2 and was heated in an autoclave at 220 °C. As a result, the local lattice of 2H-MoS2 surrounding the sulphur vacancies transformed into the 1T phase. Finally, the result was the formation of the 1T@2H-MoS2 nanosheets. The concentration of the 1T phase increases gradually with the increase in the hydrothermal time, i.e., the sample of 1T@2H-MoS2-8 h contains the maximum concentration of the 1T metallic phase. As a result, the catalyst 1T@2H-MoS2-8 h possesses rich effective active edge sites and overall high conductivity, which leads to its superior HER activity.
3.2.2.2 High temperature annealing. 
So far, we have studied the synthesis of many 1T/2H-MoS2 samples by the hydrothermal method using different reagents but there are few other reported bottom-up approaches for the successful fabrication of mixed MoS2. By using high-temperature annealing method, Chang et al.54 were successful in the transformation of the coordination of Mo from trigonal prismatic to octahedral by the intercalation of Li+ in between the layers of MoS2. (NH4)2MoS4 and LiOH are used as the starting materials, which were then calcined in Ar atmosphere over 1000 °C. Here, different phases of MoS2 were generated at different temperatures, i.e., 2H phase below 600 °C, 3R phase over 700 °C, and 1T MoS2 over 1000 °C (Fig. 12a). This method is quite similar to the chemical intercalation exfoliation technique but we have included it in the bottom-up approach since (NH4)2MoS4 is used as an Mo precursor. The XPS spectra obtained were used to evaluate the contents of the 1T and 2H phases. According to Fig. 12b, deconvolution of peaks occurs for the 1T phase and additional peaks arise, which were shifted to lower binding energies by 1.0 eV in accordance to the position of the peaks for the 2H phase. Similarly, in Fig. 12c, new peaks were observed at 161 and 162.1 eV in the S 2p region, in addition to known doublet peaks of 2H-MoS2, i.e., S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2. The partial formation of the 1T phase (nearly 80%) was confirmed by the parallel shift of the additional peaks towards lower binding energy.

3.2.2.3 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD). 
The CVD method of synthesis is employed to gain high quality and high purity of the nanomaterials at a large scale.55 In this method, a tubular furnace is used with a substrate and materials at high and low temperatures. While working, the materials at high temperature get deposited on the substrate first, followed by the material at low temperature, resulting in the formation of thin-layered Mo on the substrate and over it, the sulphur vapor is allowed to flow, yielding 2D-MoS2 films. Friedman et al.56 devised phase change in the monolayer MoS2 films by the chemical vapor deposition method by using the Si substrate and was further verified by the Raman peaks observed at J1, J2, and J3 for the 1T phase. Fig. 13a and b displays the Raman spectra of the monolayer MoS2 films. The Raman peaks displayed in Fig. 13a is for the 2H-MoS2 film and the inset present in its left top corner shows the optical image of Raman spectra. Followed by the exposure of the film to TPA (tripropylamine), the Raman peaks were observed at 156 cm−1, 226 cm−1, and 300 cm−1 for the J1, J2, and J3 peaks (Fig. 13b), which is attributed to the presence of the 1T phase, which are absent in the 2H-phase, as shown in Fig. 13a, indicating the coexistence of both the 1T and 2H phases.

4. Application of 1T/2H MoS2
Owing to the unique electronic features, high charge carrier mobility, appropriate bandgap, and chemical stability, 1T/2H-MoS2 provides a broad variety of applications in various fields such as energy production via hydrogen evolution reaction, energy storage, and photocatalytic pollutant degradation. However, the information given below provides an overview of the applications of 1T/2H-MoS2 and 1T/2H-MoS2-based heterostructures.
4.1 1T/2H MoS2 as a hydrogen evolution catalyst
As is known to all, hydrogen is regarded as one of the most effective and promising energy alternatives to traditional fossil fuels and has drawn immense attention in recent decades.57–59 On account of several literature studies, it has been deduced that similar to 2H and 1T MoS2, the mixed-phase 1T/2H MoS2 can also be regarded as both a photocatalytic and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution catalyst. In 1T/2H-MoS2, the octahedral metallic 1T phase MoS2 is 107 times more conductive and provides a greater number of rich active sites for H2 formation compared to that of the semiconducting 2H-phase. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a half-reaction of water splitting that involves only water reduction reaction and the mechanism follows a different pathway for electrocatalytic as well as photocatalytic reaction,14,60 which are briefly discussed in the following section.

4.1.1 Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution with 1T/2H MoS2. 
The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has been regarded as a feasible strategy for producing hydrogen efficiently and has drawn great attention because of its environment-friendly nature and low cost. The unsaturated co-ordinated edges and dangling bonds contained by the MoS2 nanosheets put forward a major contribution in electrolysis, which adsorbs the reacting molecules on the edges as well as the corners on the Mo atom. Therefore, by increasing the number of active edge sites in MoS2, it can be modified into a highly efficient electrocatalyst and in 1T/2H-MoS2, the presence of the 1T metallic phase provides more active edge sites for better conductivity, which proves itself as an efficient electrocatalyst for HER. Generally, there are two widely accepted mechanisms in the HER process for the both acidic and alkaline environments (i.e., Volmer–Heyrovsky and Volmer Tafel mechanisms).61 According to eqn (2)–(9), both the mechanisms in the first step involves the transfer of electron along with proton adsorption on an active site of the surface of the electrode (Volmer step). In the second step, either the two hydrogen atoms obtained from proton adsorption on the surface gets coupled (Tafel step) or the direct combination of a hydrated proton with adsorbed hydrogen atom and gets associated with an electron transfer from the surface of the electrode (Heyrovsky step).61 For alkaline medium, the Volmer step for the dissociation of water is necessary and the reaction is generally two to three times lesser in magnitude than in acidic medium.
Mechanisms of HER in acidic as well as in alkaline solutions.
Acidic medium 2H(aq)+ + 2e− → H2(g)(2) H+ + e− → Hads (Volmer step)(3) 2Hads → H2(g) (Tafel step)(4) H+ + Hads + e− → H2(g) (Heyrovsky step)(5)
Alkaline medium 2H2O + 2e− → H2(g) + 2OH(aq)−(6) 2H2O + 2e− → 2Hads + 2OH− (Water dissociation in Volmer step)(7) 2Hads → H2(g) (Tafel step)(8) Hads + e− → H2 + OH− (Heyrovsky step)(9)However, a crucial step in the HER process is H+ adsorption and H2 desorption, and the overall mechanism is governed through a number of parameters such as low Gibbs free energy value, high photocurrent density with low overpotential, low Tafel slope, which determines the type of HER mechanism (Volmer–Heyrovsky or Volmer–Tafel mechanisms), effective surface area, turn over frequency (TOF), and faradaic efficiency. In these findings, mixed-phase 1T/2H MoS2 has a vital role as compared to 2H-MoS2 due to the presence of metallic 1T-MoS2. An effective 1T/2H-MoS2 electrocatalyst was prepared by Liu et al.29via the implantation of the metallic phase, i.e., the 1T phase in 2H-MoS2 nanosheets, exhibiting an exceptional behavior with less overpotential and facile kinetics for HER. The electrocatalyst exhibited a small onset potential along with a lower overpotential of 220 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, whereas 2H-MoS2 possesses a high overpotential of 320 mV to achieve substantial hydrogen evolution (current density = 10 mA cm−2) (Fig. 14a). As shown in Fig. 14b, the derived Tafel slope for 1T/2H-MoS2 is 61 mV dec−1, which is less than 155 mV dec−1 for 2H-MoS2. The Tafel slope gives a positive effect of the heterogenous MoS2 nanostructures containing the 1T phase by increasing the reaction rate. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) value was observed to identify the effective surface area of the catalyst. According to Fig. 14c, 1T/2H-MoS2 shows a Cdl value that is 25.3 times greater in comparison to that of 2H-MoS2, which gives a larger active surface area. As shown in Fig. 14d, the Rct for 1T/2H-MoS2 heterogenous nanosheets is approximately 30 Ω, which is much smaller than that of 2H-MoS2 (approximately 2000 Ω), indicating the enhanced conductivity because of the involvement of metallic 1T phase, leading to excellent HER activity.

Copyright©2017, Royal Society of Chemistry). 
Some findings provide prospective insights into the design of 1T/2H MoS2 with rich concentration of the 1T phase content since it greatly enriches the effective active sites for superior electrocatalytic HER activity. For instance, Wang et al.23 firstly prepared 1T/2H-MoS2 catalysts with a high concentration of the 1T phase, which is calculated to be 61.5% by adding a certain amount of ammonium bicarbonate by a simple hydrothermal method. Since the 1T/2H-MoS2 catalyst so formed contains a greater concentration of the 1T metallic phase, it exhibits more active edge sites along with higher conductivity, which demands excellent HER performances. For comparison, the 1T/2H-MoS2 catalyst further underwent an annealing treatment at 400 °C for 2 h but the performance over HER is very poor and the low efficiency is may be due to the complete interconversion of the 1T phase into the 2H phase, which decreases the 1T concentration in the mixed-phase of MoS2 under the action of heating at high temperature. From Fig. 14e, it has been illustrated that 1T/2H-MoS2 shows a remarkable increase in the charge transfer resistance (Rct) from 39 Ω to 482 Ω after annealing, which shows a decreased concentration of the metallic 1T phase. A catalyst with small Rct exhibits superior electron transport and more favorable electrode kinetics, leading to improved hydrogen evolution reaction activity. Again, the HER activity has also been investigated by varying the preparation temperature and it has been concluded that the as-fabricated MoS2 was composed of both the 1T and 2H phases and the 1T phase was absent for the temperature of 240 °C. As shown in Fig. 14f, the 1T phase concentration gradually increases with the temperature, which was maximum at the optimum temperature (200 °C). In a similar trend, 1T/2H-MoS2 exhibited high current density and low Tafel slope (Fig. 14g and h) at an optimized temperature, i.e., 200 °C, again demonstrating the superior HER activity due to the existence of a greater amount of the 1T phase. Like the temperature, with the increase in the hydrothermal time, the concentration of the 1T phase also increases. Shi and co-workers49 found that the sample 1T/2H-MoS2 treated for 8 h contains the maximum amount of the 1T metallic phase, indicating the high conductivity and high HER performance along with a low Tafel slope value than that obtained for 4 h and 2H-MoS2/C nanosheets.
Moreover, the incorporation of the RGO template can also modulate the concentration of the 1T phase in the 2H-MoS2 nanosheets and the as-obtained 1T/2H MoS2 with 50% metallic 1T could significantly improve the electron carrier concentration and the active sites on the surfaces by an order of magnitude compared to that of 2H-MoS2.51 In comparison, the HER efficiency was also tested towards 1T/2H MoS2, containing 15% 1T phase content. However, 1T/2H-MoS2 with 50% concentration shows small onset potential with high cathodic current at quite a low overpotential, whereas much larger overpotential is exhibited by the ex-2H-MoS2 nanosheets. Furthermore, the 1T/2H-MoS2 nanosheets give a small Tafel slope, thereby exhibiting outstanding HER activity. The high HER performance was due to the high 1T content, which arose from the electron transfer from RGO to 2H-MoS2, which shifted the valence band maximum upwards by increasing the electron density at the Fermi level and an in-depth understanding was acquired from ultraviolet electron spectroscopy (UPS) and electrochemical characterization. From UPS, as shown in Fig. 15a, one can say that the VBM of 1T–2H MoS2 is upshifted by 0.36 eV toward the Fermi level for 50% 1T content, which suggests firm electron coupling after the incorporation of the 1T-MoS2 phase occurs. Mott–Schottky plot exhibited the high charge carrier concentration for 50% 1T/2H MoS2 as the slope, which is much smaller (Fig. 15b) as compared to that of 15% 1T and 2H-MoS2, which is beneficial for electron transfer and catalytic performance of the surface reductive sites. For instance, electrochemical Cdl, as shown in Fig. 15c, demonstrates an increased number of active sites for 50% 1T/2H-MoS2 with high capacitance value, which confirms the high activity towards HER. However, such a type of dispersion of the electron density close to the Fermi level, as shown in Fig. 15d, suppresses the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate by promoting charge transfer across the 50% 1T–2H MoS2 interface and the transfer process follows Volmer–Tafel mechanism, in accordance with the Tafel slope.

Apart from all the conditions regarding high HER activity, Wang et al.48 developed ultra-stable in-plane 1T/2H-MoS2 heterostructure through a simple one-pot annealing treatment of bulk 2H-MoS2 by a mixture of gas, including Ar and phosphorus vapor. Here, phosphorous occupies the interspace of the bulk MoS2, leading to the expansion of MoS2, which also induces partial phase conversion from the 2H phase to the 1T-MoS2 phase, which thus enhances the HER performance. Fig. 15e shows that the in-plane 1T/2H-MoS2 heterostructures possess high electrical conductivity of 8620 S m−1, which is 500 times much greater than those of the bulk 2H-MoS2 nanosheets (16.1 and 15.2 S m−1). The angle of contact between the in-plane mixed 1T/2H-MoS2 heterostructure and water is 82°, which is much lower than those of bulk 2H-MoS2 (128°) and nanosheets (126°) because of the high hydrophilicity of 1T-MoS2 (Fig. 15f–h). Afterwards, keeping it for 500 days at room temperature, the in-plane 1T/2H-MoS2 heterostructures show an ultra-stable property. The as-obtained in-plane 1T/2H-MoS2 heterostructure shows high turnover frequency along with high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of 60.3 cmECSA−2, which is three or four times higher than those of the 2H-MoS2 nanosheets (21.5 cmECSA−2) and bulk 2H-MoS2 (15.5 cmECSA−2) (Fig. 15j) indicating that the in-plane 1T/2H-MoS2 heterostructures provide numerous active sites, which leads to efficient HER mechanism. The comparison of HER performance of mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 with that of 2H-MoS2 and 1T-MoS2 are precisely summarized in Table 1 along with their heterostructures.

4.1.2 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with 1T/2H MoS2. 
1T/2H-MoS2 nanosheets are also one of the most promising photocatalysts in the energy and environmental fields and show outstanding photocatalytic activities. Photocatalytic hydrogen production via the water splitting reaction is environmentally benign and cost-effective due to the utilization of clean renewable energy sources, especially solar energy. Generally, the overall water splitting mechanism is alternatively known as water redox reaction under visible light illumination and consists of two half reaction, i.e., water reduction and water oxidation, as presented in eqn (10)–(12). The procedure of overall photocatalytic water splitting is represented in Scheme 2a and b, which predicted that four major processes are involved in the photocatalytic water splitting mechanism56 and these are (i) light-radiation (stage 1), (ii) excitation of charge along with separation with the shifting of charges (e− and h+) (stage 2), and (iii–iv) catalytic reaction on the surface of the catalyst, i.e., reduction and oxidation reaction (stage 3 and 4). According to the basic principle, in water the splitting reaction, the semiconducting photocatalyst consists of a valence band (VB) and a conduction band (CB), which undergoes an excitation process when it absorbs photon energy greater or equal to its bandgap energy. As a result, the electrons in valence band get excited and move on to the conduction band, leaving behind holes at the VB. The accumulation of holes and electrons at the CB and VB is involved in the oxidation and reduction reaction, respectively, with water to give the respective products. The water oxidation reaction includes the dissipation of water into O2, while in the water reduction reaction, H+ couples with an electron to generate H2. It should be noted that water redox reaction takes place only when the CB level lies at a more negative potential than the H2O reduction potential (H+/H2 = 0 eV vs. NHE, pH = 0) and the VB is located at a more positive potential than the H2O oxidation potentials (H2O/H2 = 1.23 eV vs. NHE, pH = 0), which are above and below than CB and VB levels, respectively, on the surface of the photocatalyst. Thus, to be a good hydrogen generation system, the photocatalyst should possess suitable bandgap as well as band edge potential, light-harvesting capacity, superior charge separation efficiency, and sufficient active sites for photocatalytic reaction. Recently, 1T/2H-MoS2 served as an efficient co-catalyst in the photocatalytic water splitting reaction due to its greater conductivity and excellent behavior, particularly towards hydrogen production. Moreover, the presence of both types of polymorphs, i.e., semiconducting (2H) as well as metallic (1T), with different reaction mechanism is another crucial parameter for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Due to the semiconducting behavior, the 2H phase has the ability of compositing with other semiconductors, whereas the metallic part of 1T/2H MoS2 acts as a co-catalyst due to the presence of more active edge sites for H2 generation under visible light illumination. However, 1T/2H-MoS2 provides sufficient active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen production and can behave as efficient electro-transfer channels, thereby improving the transfer of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. Photocatalyst → Photocatalyst (e− + h−)(10) H2O + h+ → 1/2O2 + 2H+(11) 2e− + 2H+ → H2(g)(12)However, so far, Liu et al.33 have clearly described the transfer of an electron between the TiO2 and mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 and high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. For instance, mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 nanosheets in vertical and few-layer forms were coated controllably on the TiO2 nanorod supported by FTO, which were fabricated through a simple hydrothermal strategy and Pt@TiO2 as a referential sample by the simple photodeposition method. The increase in the hydrothermal time also increases the loading amount of MoS2, which results in an increase in the absorption spectra in the visible light region (400–700 nm). The experimental result illustrated that mixed-phase MoS2/TiO2 exhibited high current density compared to TiO2 NR and Pt/TiO2 with very low overpotential, as observed in the polarization curve (Fig. 16a), which can be attributed to the more active edge sites as well superior conductivity of mixed-phase MoS2. According to Fig. 16b, in comparison to Pt@TiO2 NRs, the hydrogen production rate of MoS2@TiO2 is almost twice, indicating the efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by the highly active MoS2 as the co-catalyst in place of platinum. From the above results, it has been illustrated that 1T/2H-MoS2 exhibits similar characteristics as that of Pt as it easily reacts with H+ to generate H2. The UPS spectrum confirms the photogenerated electron transfer process from TiO2 to 1T/2H-MoS2 since TiO2 exhibited a large work function value, thus possessing a more negative Fermi level than MoS2. Such type of results indicates that under UV light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons get easily transferred from the CB of TiO2 to 1T/2H-MoS2, which acts as active sites for hydrogen production due to the close contact created between the 1T phase MoS2 and TiO2. The possible photocatalytic H2 evolution via electron transfer mechanism is predicted in Fig. 16c, which suggests that in mixed-phase MoS2, metallic 1T-MoS2 behaves as the active site for H2 evolution.

Copyright 2017 Wiley-VCH). 
Taking advantages of mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2, Ren et al.78 synthesized the complex heterostructures of WS2–WO3·H2O/1T–2H MoS2 in the selective stacking assembly with the assistance of supercritical CO2 (SC CO2). As shown in Fig. 16d, on exposure to visible irradiation, the photocurrent response of quaternary heterostructures is about 10.6 × 10−5 A cm−2, which is three and 1.7 times larger in comparison to that of 1T–2H MoS2 (∼3.5 × 10−5 A cm−2) and WS2–WO3·H2O (∼6.4 × 10−5 A cm−2), indicating a positive impact on the effective separation of the photogenerated charges. Fig. 16e shows the band potential levels and redox potentials of the electron acceptors of the quaternary heterostructures. Under the irradiation of solar light, the photogenerated electrons get excited from the VB to the CB. Here, the transfer of photogenerated electrons occurs from the conduction band of 2H-WS2 to the CB of 2H-MoS2 and the transfer of photogenerated holes occurs from the valence band of 2H-MoS2 to the VB of 2H-WS2 because of their identical energy structure and contact between 2H-WS2 and 2H-MoS2.79 The presence of 1T metallic phase enhances the conductivity and provides a greater number of active sites over the basal and edge sites for hydrogen production. The involvement of WO3·H2O absorbs protons in the acidic medium so that the hydrogen atoms intercalated will spread over to the active edge sites of WS2, thereby improving the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. These studies again reveal that in the mixed 1T/2H-MoS2 phase, 2H act as a semiconductor in the electron–hole separation process after excitation under light illumination, while 1T-MoS2 behaves as a metal center with a good electron receiver and active sites for the H2 evolution reaction.

4.2 Energy storage behavior with 1T/2H MoS2
Since the consumption of fossil fuels and environmental pollution has accelerated, it has become urgent to maintain a balance between the energy and environment by designing energy conversion and energy storage devices. Keeping in mind the rapid expansion in the use of suitable energy storage device in the field of electronics as well as electric vehicles, nowadays, it is an urgent issue to develop advanced electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems possessing high energy density. In this regard, several efforts have been devoted. MoS2 is a typical transition metal sulphide that has been applied to energy storage devices due to its distinct features, eco-friendly nature, long cycle lifetime, and tunable interlayer distances. More importantly, the lamellar structure and weak van der Waals interaction between the stacked layers of MoS2 facilitates the easy intercalation of the guest species; thus, MoS2 is considered as an outstanding electrode material for various energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries. Moreover, the presence of several oxidation states on the Mo atom in MoS2 promotes faradaic charge transfer in the storage device to a great extent. However, due to the fast capacity deterioration, followed by the poor electrical conductivity, the bulk MoS2 does not satisfy the required electrochemical properties for the storage device. However, it has been seen that MoS2 with its few-layers semiconducting, i.e., 2H and metallic 1T phase, serves as a highly conductive material and has been employed as an efficient energy storage device. It has been found that 1T-MoS2 exhibited 107 times higher conductivity than 2H-MoS2 due to the highly exposed basal as well as edge planes, which provides more active sites but the difficult synthetic procedure and instability, somewhat limited its wide ranging applications such as the performance of electrochemical storage devices. In this respect, highly promising hybrid 1T/2H mixed-phase MoS2 prepared through the phase engineering process is regarded as a promising energy storage device, in which both the semiconducting and metallic phase enhances the electrochemical properties regarding energy storage. 1T/2H MoS2 is widely applicable in both supercapacitors and batteries, depending upon the reaction condition.
Nowadays, Li-ion batteries are the most widely-used technology for mobile power supplies. Owing to its amazing electronic features, MoS2 has attracted great attention towards itself for fabricating a flexible battery with excellent energy storage performances and this is because of the presence of the metallic 1T phase. Since the intercalation chemistry plays a vital role in the storage device, indeed, MoS2 with weak van der Waals force existing among the layers permits the deintercalation and intercalation of lithium ion in between the layers without any expansion in the volume, thus satisfying the stability of quick storage of lithium and a shorter open path for lithium ion intercalation and deintercalation. For instance, Wang and co-workers27 developed swollen ammoniated MoS2 with 1T/2H mixed-phase MoS2, in which the NH4+ ions expanded the lamellar structure from 0.615 to 0.99 nm, thus increasing the 1T phase concentration. The as-fabricated ammoniated 1T/2H-MoS2 electrode material possesses superior charge storage performance towards Li-ion battery with distinct surface redox reaction. Fig. 17a depicted the super high-rate capability as the specific capacitance was found to be 207 F g−1 when the scan speed was increased 100-fold, which is 58.5% of the capacitance at 1 mV s−1 and the excellent rate capability is due to the strong ionic diffusive ability of the transition metal chalcogenides and the presence of ammoniated MoS2, which facilitate the fast diffusion of ions. In addition, as shown in Fig. 17b, ammoniated 1T/2H-MoS2 was evaluated for 2000 charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g−1 with a retention of 95.4%, demonstrating excellent cycling stability.

Copyright 2018 Wiley-VCH). 
Taking advantages of the NH4+ ion and the semiconducting 2H-phase since it provides a platform to couple with other materials, Lin et al.35 synthesized 1T/2H-MoS2 nanosheets by the insertion of NH4+ as the guest ions. In this case, the 1T/2H-MoS2 nanosheets were developed on carbon fibre cloth (CFC) with uniform placement of ultrathin small SnS2 nanoparticles on the surface of the MoS2 nanosheets by the hydrothermal method and then by the water bath process. Here, the NH4+ ion produced during the reaction stabilizes the 1T phase MoS2. Fig. 17c shows the voltage sketch of the SnS2/MoS2/CFC electrode. In the first curve, the discharge plateau appears at 0.6 V and the charge plateau appears at 1.7 V. From the 2nd to 120th cycle, almost all the curves overlap, indicating excellent cycling stability of the SnS2/MoS2/CFC electrode. As is observed in Fig. 17d and e, the as-obtained electrode holds a capacity of 1294 mA h g−1 even after 120 cycles, which is much higher in comparison to that of 2H-MoS2/CFC. In the first cycle, 1T/2H-MoS2/CFC gives 1546 mA h g−1 discharge capacity and 1421 mA h g−1 charge capacity with a Coulombic efficiency of about 94.1%. The capacity of the 1T/2H-MoS2/CFC electrode gets stability at 1100 mA h g−1 before the 60th cycle and after the 60th cycle; however, the capacity falls sharply and is finally maintained at 580 mA h g−1 after 120 cycles. The data reveals that 1T/2H-MoS2 shows better activity than the semiconducting 2H phase MoS2 and the uniform development of the SnS2 nanoparticles on 1T/2H-MoS2 will reduce the transport channel of the electrons, leading to an improvement in the charge transfer process. Evenly distributed SnS2 nanoparticles prevent the deterioration of the electrode during the cycle, thereby enhancing its cycling properties.
Similar to Li-ion batteries, the recent research trend also focuses on lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries as the next-generation rechargeable batteries due to their low cost, high energy density, and high theoretical specific capacity of about 1680 mA h g−1. In the point of commercial success, Li–S batteries are greatly impeded due to polysulfide shuttling, which decays the capacity of storage. In these findings, Zhang et al.80 synthesized MXene/1T–2H MoS2–C nanohybrids by inducing MXene into the 1T–2H MoS2–nitrogen-doped carbon composites for improving the activity of the Li–S batteries concerning the capacity, charge, discharge rate, and stability. S-vacancy defects created on MXene/1T–2H MoS2-C serve as powerful adsorption and activation sites as well as accelerate the redox reactions. The larger electrical conductivity of 1T-MoS2, MXene, and nitrogen-doped carbon, having a greater number of conductive paths, improves the process of charge transfer, resulting in enhanced rate performance. The porous structure provides a large active surface, thereby improving the electrochemical kinetics. As a consequence, the prepared novel MXene/1T/2H MoS2–C–S electrode exhibited a high initial capacity of 1194.7 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, holding a higher capacity of 799.3 mA h g−1 at 0.5C after 300 cycles. The visual observation, as seen in Fig. 17f, evaluated the absorptive nature of the MXene/1T/2H MoS2–C–S electrode towards polysulfides in the discharge process. As shown in Fig. 10f, for the MXene/1T/2H MoS2–C–S electrode, there was no change in the color of the electrolyte after 12 h of discharge, while there is a color change from colorless to pale yellow for the MXene/2H MoS2–C–S electrode, which suggested that the MXene/1T/2H MoS2–C–S electrode can impactfully restrain polysulfide from the cathode to the lithium anode during the discharge process.
Since the concept of an energy storage system is rapidly increasing, supercapacitors have attracted extensive interests owing to their high power density, outstanding cycling stability, eco-friendly nature, fast charge/discharge process, and low-cost preparation.81 Niu et al.26 designed structurally stable in-plane ultrathin 1T/2H-MoS2 heterostructures coaxially aligned on 3D-carbon nanofibres (MoS2/CF) via a simple hydrothermal method. The presence of the 1T phase boosts the electrochemical performances by increasing the electrical conductivity and the number of active sites. The involvement of the 2H phase prevents the restacking of the 1T phase and hence improves the structural stability. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves, as shown in Fig. 18a, suggested that the MoS2/CF composite has the greatest cyclic voltammetric curve among all, demonstrating an increase in the specific capacitance, better capacitive behavior, and good rate capability, which are attributed to positive synergistic effects between ultrathin 1T/2H in-plane heterostructure and three-dimensional CF. The electrode shows enhanced capacitive behavior, high Coulombic efficiency, and improved electrochemical reversibility during the charge and discharge processes since all the curves are shown (Fig. 18b) to exhibit nearly linear and isosceles triangular shapes. The MoS2/CF composite achieved a higher specific capacitance value, i.e., 310 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 (Fig. 18c), which is larger than that of pure MoS2 (206 F g−1) and pure CF (50 F g−1) electrodes. Fig. 18d shows smaller internal resistance of the MoS2/CF composite (i.e., 0.42 Ω) in comparison to the internal resistance of pure MoS2 (0.59 Ω) at higher frequency as well as smaller charge transfer resistance since no semicircle is observed for the MoS2/CF composite in comparison to that of pure MoS2 at the high-frequency region. A decrease in the Rct implies superior electrical conductivity. Again, the as-obtained 1T/2H-MoS2 on carbon nanofibers represents excellent cycling stability with a specific capacitance of about 87.1% of its original value after 10000 cycles at 200 mV s−1 (Fig. 18e). The enhanced energy storage capability of mixed-phase MoS2 is mainly attributed to the ultrathin in-plane 1T–2H-MoS2 heterostructures, which effectively reduces the diffusion path length of the electrolyte ions by exposing more electrochemically active sites.

It should again be noted that the intercalation of various ions in the course of the synthetic procedure for mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 has also attracted great attention in the study of supercapacitors. As reported in their work, Wu et al.82 successfully synthesized dual ion-intercalated MoS2 with the insertion of Na+ and NH4+ through a simple and easy hydrothermal process and obtained a high rate of performance due to the presence of high 1T phase content. The higher content of the 1T phase with increased conductivity and more active sites as well as expanded lamellar structures contributed to the enhancement of the specific capacitance, resulting in better capacitive storage ability.
4.3 Photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 1T/2H-MoS2
Environmental pollution due to rapid urbanization and industrialization is a huge problem and has been a global issue in recent decades, especially for those pollutants that are difficult to degrade into harmless matter. Generally, organic, as well as inorganic pollutants discharged from the industrial and agricultural sectors, greatly harm the ecosystem; this problem should be mitigated by developing nanostructured solar energy-driven semiconductors. In this regard, the photocatalysis technique has received immense attention in the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater through the photocatalytic degradation mechanism. As a result, the most critical problems regarding energy and environmental issues can be solved by producing a highly effective and visible light active photocatalyst, which should possess efficient charge separation properties. To date, many photocatalytic semiconductors such as metal oxides, metal sulphides, nitrides, and metal hydroxides with remarkable photocatalytic degradation capacity have been generated83–89 for toxic pollutant degradation in water. Among all, the use of 2H-MoS2 in its semiconducting phase has attracted significant attention towards itself because of its non-toxicity and environmentally benign nature; however, its low photocatalytic performance limits its wide range applicability. However, the hybridized 1T/2H MoS2 is a promising one and can be used as a co-catalyst, which provides adequate catalytic sites for pollutant degradation because of the presence of the 1T metallic phase. Furthermore, mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 facilitates the generation of reactive species such as O2˙−, OH˙, and H2O2, which are the key parameters in the photodegradation process.
Zhang and co-workers90 synthesized hybrid heterojunction photocatalyst by coupling 1T/2H-MoS2 mixed-phase with SiC through a simple hydrothermal method, followed by the self-assembling method and implemented it as a visible light-driven photocatalyst for the degradation of a well-known organic pollutant, i.e., 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). The photodegradation reaction was mainly based on the presence of the defect sites in 1T/2H-MoS2, which act as the active sites and also allow the hybrid photocatalyst to complete the photodegradation reaction via the different photocatalytic pathway. The as-fabricated heterojunction photocatalyst predicted enhanced photocatalytic performance compared to 2H-MoS2 along with superior photoinduced charge separation efficiency. However, a possible mechanism regarding photogenerated charge migration and separation over 1T/2H-MoS2/SiC is proposed in Fig. 19a. Overall 4-NP photoreduction reaction occurs at the 1T site of 1T/2H-MoS2 and the mechanism is mainly governed by electron and active hydrogen intermediates provided from the hole scavenging unit (NH3BH3). 1T-MoS2 could assist in the modification of 4-NP to its less toxic product, i.e., 4-hydroxylaminophenol under light irradiation.

Copyright 2020 Wiley-VCH). 
However, in some cases, the photocatalytic experimental studies revealed that the microwave-treated hybrid sample manifested superior photodegradation performance as compared to the hydrothermal strategy, which is attributed to the larger concentration of the 1T phase since microwave treatment increases the layer spacing, which provides an efficient electron transfer platform. The microwave-treated 1T/2H-MoS2 with good conductivity and high density of electrons in the 1T phase is beneficial for the generation of more reactive active species for the participation in the photoredox reaction. Liu et al.24 developed hybrid 1T/2H-MoS2 nanospheres by adopting the hydrothermal (H) and microwave (M) techniques; the photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst was demonstrated towards the degradation of methyl orange (MO) and the photoreduction of Cr(VI). As displayed in Fig. 19b, H–1T@2H-MoS2 shows MO-degradation ability of 32%, whereas M-1T@2H-MoS2 exhibits degradation ability up to 91% after 70 min light illumination, thereby displaying the best catalytic activity, and the increased efficiency is because of the high concentration of the 1T phase. MO photodegradation over M-1T@2H-MoS2 was also evaluated in the presence of various scavengers. As seen in Fig. 19c, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of M-1T@2H-MoS2 is decreased after the addition of 5 mM BQ and the Kapp value reduces from 0.034 to 0.015, suggesting that ˙O2− is an important species that plays a vital role in the degradation mechanism. The photoreduction of Cr(VI) occurs due to the electrons included in the Cr(VI) to Cr(III) redox reaction. According to Fig. 19d, for potassium dichromate, the photoreduction rate reaches 88% in 120 min whereas no degradation is seen for 2H-MoS2. In comparison to 2H-MoS2, M-1T@2H-MoS2 displays excellent photoreduction rate due to the metallic 1T phase, resulting in more electrons and more efficient electron transfer. The mixed-phase MoS2 with a larger specific surface area improves the photocatalytic efficiency by making the contact of Cr(VI) with M-1T@2H-MoS2 easier. As demonstrated in Fig. 19e, the bandgap of M-1T/2H-MoS2 was narrowed due to the introduction of the 1T phase and in the mixed-phase MoS2, 1T-MoS2 tends to form a trap state so that quick transfer of electrons takes place from the CB of 2H-MoS2 to the 1T site. As a result, the 1T site with high electron density undergoes redox reaction to facilitate the photodegradation of the organic dye, whereas the easy conversion of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) occurs due to the excellent channelization of the photogenerated electrons of 2H-MoS2 on the 1T-MoS2 surface (Fig. 19f).
Apart from this, Liu et al.31 improved the photocatalytic efficiency of mixed-phase 1T/2H-MoS2 towards methylene blue and Cr(VI) by coupling microwave hydrothermal treatment with surface plasmon resonance by the addition of Ag nanoparticles. Noteworthily, the as-fabricated hybrid photocatalyst with high absorbance properties exhibited superior photocatalytic efficiency for Cr(VI) and MB, which was improved by 81% and 41% as compared to that of 2H-MoS2, respectively. Generally, the photoreduction performance is closely related to the electron concentration and in this case, the presence of both the 1T phase as well as the Ag QDs promotes the metallic characteristics, thus transporting more electrons to the system. In other words, the MB photodegradation process was enhanced by the LSPR resonance effect on 1T/2H-MoS2, which increases the exciton generation rate and suppresses the charge recombination properties. However, the two photocatalytic processes are mainly governed by the presence of a synergistic effect between 2H-MoS2, 1T-MoS2 and Ag QDs and the various reaction paths for this mechanism followed by different reactive species are depicted in the following eqn (13)–(20). 1T@2H-MoS2 + hν → h+ + e−(13) h+ + H2O → ˙OH + H+(14) 3e− + Cr6+ → Cr3+(15) e− + O2 → ˙O2−(16) ˙O2− + H2O → HO2˙ + OH−(17) HO2˙ + H2O → H2O2 + ˙OH(18) H2O2 → 2˙OH(19) ˙OH/OH−/h+ + MB → CO2 + H2O/by-products(20)Zhang et al.34 prepared ultrathin 1T/2H-MoS2 nanosheets to show their photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of potassium hexyldithiocarbonate (PHDTC), which is an organic pollutant found in mine wastewater and is very difficult to degrade into harmless matter normally. Fig. 20a depicts the overall photodegradation mechanism with the generation of various reactive species such as O2˙− and OH˙, which facilitates PHDTC degradation to its photodegraded products. As shown in Fig. 20b, over 99% of PHDTC is degraded by 1T/2H-MoS2 under exposure of visible light for 3.5 h while bulk MoS2 decomposes only 6% PHDTC. Fig. 20c displays that the degradation ratio of PHDTC increases with the increase in the dosage of 1T/2H-MoS2 and over 99% of PHDTC was degraded when the mass proportion of 1T/2H-MoS2 to PHDTC reached 0.18, which indicates that 5.945 g of PHDTC is photocatalytically degraded by 1 g of an ultrathin 1T/2H-MoS2 monolayer. However, the as-prepared MoS2 was composed of 1T and 2H phases with monolayer structures and rich active edge sites, exhibiting outstanding photocatalytic performance.

5. Conclusion and future perspective
This review offers a summarized idea, extending from the structural properties, various methods of synthesis, to few characterizations and a wide range of applications of 1T/2H-MoS2. The 1T/2H-MoS2 discussed in this review is a mixed-phase heterostructure including two phases, i.e., 2H and 1T, among the four polymorphs. The synthesis of the mixed-phase structurally stable 1T/2H-MoS2 system is a solution to the stabilization issue of the 1T-MoS2 phase as the involvement of the 2H phase avoids the restacking of the 1T phase. Under top-down approaches, different strategies such as chemical and electrochemical intercalation exfoliation by alkali metal ion, microwave-assisted exfoliation, SC CO2-assisted exfoliation, inducing sulphur vacancies, mechanical ball milling, and electron injection, have been developed. The SC CO2-assisted exfoliation and microwave-assisted method gives a high concentration of the 1T phase contained 1T/2H-MoS2 and the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method is more convenient and less time-consuming in comparison to the conventional hydrothermal method. The introduction of sulphur vacancies also causes partial phase transition from 2H to 1T, giving 1T/2H-MoS2, where the role of sulphur vacancies is identical to that of Li+ in lithiated MoS2. For tuning the 1T phase in monolayer 1T/2H-MoS2, electron injection method (using RGO template), electrochemical intercalation with alkali metal ion, as well as mechanical ball milling are also helpful. The chemical intercalation process with alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+) should be handled with care because of the toxic nature of alkali metals. 1T/2H-MoS2 is also obtained by bottom-up approaches, which involve one-step synthetic hydrothermal route using the precursors of Mo and S at low temperature under various solvents or additive reagents. In this review, other different intercalating agents such as NH3, propionic acid, and ammonium bicarbonate, are taken into consideration and are included under bottom-up approaches since they are prepared by one-step hydrothermal treatment from Mo and S precursors. By the use of the hydrothermal method, 1T/2H-MoS2 with different 1T ratios can be synthesized by adjusting the reaction parameters including the hydrothermal temperature, time, and solvents, and is cost-effective, time-saving, and easy to handle. High temperature annealing and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods, which are categorized under bottom-up approaches, are also implemented for the successful formation of 1T/2H-MoS2. In 1T/2H-MoS2, the incorporation of the metallic 1T phase into the semi-metallic 2H phase increases the synergistic effect existing between the two phases and enhances its various applications towards energy and environment. The combination of the metallic, metastable 1T phase and the semiconducting, stable 2H phase provides more electron transfer since 1T-MoS2 is 107 times more conductive and has increased number of active sites, thereby improving its catalytic activity towards electro/photocatalytic hydrogen generation and pollutant abatement (both organic and inorganic pollutants). Because of its distinct features, eco-friendly nature, long cycle life, and tunable interlayer distances, it can also be used in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors as well as lithium-ion and lithium–sulfur batteries, etc.
1T/2H-MoS2 has proved its efficiency by showing improved behavior in different fields. The performance of 1T/2H-MoS2 can be further enhanced by various alterations such as the intercalation process, doping, combining with different organic compounds, and making composites with conductive materials. The successful use of other intercalating agents in place of alkali metal ions paves the path for further research on the intercalation process using different other intercalating agents for the synthesis of 1T/2H-MoS2. Various applications are discussed in this review but all the applications are still at the initial phase, which leads to further development for the enhanced performance of the material. We hope that various synthetic strategies, stabilization, properties, and different fields of applications of 1T/2H-MoS2 could be successfully attained in the near future.
