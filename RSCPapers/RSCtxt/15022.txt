1. Introduction
The fossil fuel crisis and environmental issues are regarded as the two most challenging problems faced by mankind in this century. Directed by the idea of converting and storing renewable energy efficiently, energy materials and devices have been research hotspots for several decades.1,2 Batteries, as the most widely used energy storage devices, although having high energy densities, suffer from low power densities and limited operation lifetimes due to their working principles compared with capacitors (Fig. 1a).3,4 Supercapacitors (SCs), also known as electrochemical capacitors or ultracapacitors, have emerged as the bridge between batteries and traditional capacitors. Different from the widely used lithium-ion batteries, SCs realize their energy storage abilities via surface electrostatic ion adsorption known as electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), or redox reactions known as faradic pseudocapacitors,5 leading to superb cyclic lifetimes, ultrafast charge–discharge capabilities, and high power densities. Such attractive properties enable SCs to be one of the most promising candidates for energy sources in vehicles, electronic devices, and other applications.6

The emergence of flexible electronic devices in recent years (e.g. wearable electronic devices and flexible displays) has been revolutionizing power sources including solar cells, batteries, and SCs.7 While designed with much higher efficiencies (for solar cells) and energy and power densities (for batteries and SCs), energy devices have to achieve high flexibility to catch up with the increasing demand for flexible electronic devices.8,9 Thus, substantial effort has been invested in the fabrication of flexible SCs with excellent electrochemical performances for flexible electronic devices.10–13
Flexible SCs generally consist of flexible electrodes and solid-state electrolytes wrapped in elastic packages (Fig. 1b).14 The employment of this configuration endows SCs with lightweight, high flexibility, and reliable safety. To date, gel electrolytes such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) supported ionic compounds (e.g. H3PO4, LiCl, or KOH)15–17 are widely used in flexible SCs and have satisfactory flexibility benefitting from their polymeric networks. They also exhibit high ionic conductivities ranging from 10−4 to 10−2 S cm−1 without leakage problems.14 As the current commercial SCs are based on rigid electrodes, the key issue of the research on flexible SCs is the development of flexible electrodes, precisely high conductive substrates with outstanding flexibility for stretching, bending, folding or even rolling, and active materials with superior cyclic stability, energy and power densities.18–20 Thus, the rational choice of materials is essential for the fabrication and performance of SCs. A large variety of materials with various nanostructures have been studied as flexible electrodes in recent years, and among them, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured materials, including carbon,21 polymers,22 metals,23 metal oxides (hydroxides),24 chalcogenides and nitrides,25,26 display some attractive advantages, such as high specific area, efficient 1D electron transport, and excellent mechanical strength, enabling them to be a promising alternative for flexible conductive substrates or active materials.27
In addition, to meet the demands of different applications, flexible SCs are designed in diverse formats, such as sandwich-type,10 wire-shaped,13 and chip-type structures.28 The architectural design is a new branch of the exploration of flexible SCs, aiming at better manifestation of their performances under different conditions. The combination of 1D–1D nanostructures forms a new high dimensional assembly with further improved surface areas and electron pathways, allowing these materials to have sufficient contact with the electrolyte and fitting the needs of flexible SCs with different structures.29,30
Herein, we review the recent progress of research on flexible SCs consisting of 1D nanostructured materials. In Section 2, different 1D nanomaterials are categorized by their main functions in flexible SCs and summarized as conductive frameworks and active materials, respectively. For each function, materials are further classified by their components, such as carbon, metal oxides (hydroxides), chalcogenides, nitrides, and polymers, to make detailed summaries, emphasizing the advantages of 1D nanomaterials employed as electrodes for flexible SCs. In Section 3, different types of flexible, 1D nanomaterial-based SCs focusing on sandwich-type, wire-shaped, and chip-type SCs are described. Unsettled problems and prospects of the development of flexible SCs are also discussed finally.
2. 1D nanomaterials for flexible SCs
The first step to fabricate flexible SCs is to make flexible electrodes, which includes two parts: manufacture of flexible conductive substrates and deposition of active materials. Metal current collectors, such as Ni foams,31 stainless steel foils32 and Ti foils,33 are still the most widely used conductive substrates in SCs to date. Although metal substrates exhibit high conductivities, their low deformation capabilities and high weights can adversely affect the flexibilities, energy and power densities of SCs. On the other hand, the energy densities of EDLCs based on active and mesoporous carbon are still not sufficient enough to meet the demands of high energy devices.34 Therefore, exploration of new materials for flexible conductive frameworks and active materials with high energy densities need to be carried out at the same time.
2.1. 1D nanomaterials as flexible conductive frameworks
The rigid current collector is one of the biggest obstacles for flexible SCs, and thus obtaining flexible, conductive frameworks is the key to this challenge. Carbon-based 1D nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nanofibers (CNFs) have been widely used to fabricate flexible conductive frameworks for flexible electrodes (Fig. 2a–f). CNTs made by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method usually exhibit high electron conductivities, low electrical double-layer capacitances, and are easily processed into films,35 yarns,30 and even three-dimensional (3D) architectures combined with graphene foams.36 The mechanical strengths of these frameworks are often well demonstrated, e.g. 15.7 GPa of Young's modulus for a single-wall CNT made thin film,37 and 4 times strain with a negligible effect on the electrochemical performances of the aligned CNT film.38 However, 1D CNT yarns and two-dimensional (2D) films are often limited by their low surface areas, thus leading to a restricted loading mass of active materials and low contact areas with electrolytes. A way to overcome this drawback is to fabricate 3D frameworks. The 2D graphene foam supported CNT film fabricated via two steps of CVD methods exhibits a good electrical conductivity of 178 S cm−1, a large surface area of 98 m2 g−1, and tunable low areal densities ranging from 0.9 to 2.0 mg cm−2.36 Besides CNTs, the conductive framework of CNFs is another option for flexible SCs.39 Unlike CNTs which need catalyst-assisted growth processes, CNFs can be formed via simple carbonization of electrospun polymeric nanofibers,40 or even natural substances.41,42 CNFs can also be nitrogen-doped with nitrogen-containing precursors (e.g. proteins), or by post-growth doping of nitrogen,43 leading to improved capacitances.

Besides carbon-based frameworks, some nanostructured transition metal oxides (TMOs) are good options for flexible SCs. TMOs can be easily tailored to different nanostructures, including 1D nanowires and nanotubes.44 While considering their semiconductor characteristics, some post-growth treatments are needed to improve electrical conductivities. Annealing TMOs in reducing atmospheres can improve their carrier densities over several magnitudes via the formation of oxygen vacancies. For example, the carrier density of hydrogenated ZnO nanowires (Fig. 2g and h) is calculated to be 2.65 × 1020 cm−3, much higher than the counterpart of pure ZnO (7.04 × 1017 cm−3).45 For hydrogen treated TiO2 nanotubes, this value is 1.4 × 1023 cm−3 due to the formation of Ti3+ sites.46 Nitridation is another way to enhance the electrical conductivities of TMOs by transforming them into nitrogen-doped TMOs or even metal nitrides.47,48 As a widely used electrode material for SCs, TiN attracts a lot of attention due to its superior electrical conductivity (4000–55500 S cm−1),49,50 while the fatal shortcoming of TiN is its low specific capacitance (generally smaller than 150 F g−1). To fabricate a SC with high energy density, TiN nanowires or nanotubes can be used as a conductive scaffold to grow other materials with pseudocapacitive properties (Fig. 2i and j), e.g. Ni(OH)2,51 NixCo2x(OH)6x,52 MnO2,53 and polyaniline,54 as the main component of energy storage. Nonetheless, these series of 1D nanostructures are usually not freestanding. Thus, when working as flexible conductive frameworks for flexible SCs, they have to be deposited on other soft substrates such as carbon textiles45 and metal gauzes.52
2.2. 1D nanomaterials as active materials
High electrochemical performance is the major objective for SC research no matter the format is flexible or rigid. 1D nanostructured materials have proved their superior performances for energy storage,55,56 as the 1D high electron pathways and large specific areas make them one of the best alternatives for high energy and power density SCs.27 In this part, different 1D nanomaterials categorized by components with their electrochemical performances are briefly reviewed.
2.3. 1D nanostructured carbon-based active materials
Although carbon-based 1D nanomaterials such as CNTs and CNFs usually exhibit low electrical double-layer capacitances, they are still reliable options for SCs because of their superior cyclic stabilities. Additionally, introducing a porous structure can improve the surface area of carbon, leading to enhanced energy densities. In 2003, Kim and co-workers developed poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN)-derived CNFs,57 while the best sample obtained by calcination at 800 °C in N2 just exhibited a moderate reversible capacitance of 120 F g−1 at a current rate of 1 A g−1. In 2007, a kind of porous carbon CNF was reported by carbonization of ZnCl2-containing PAN nanofibers, which exhibited an enhanced reversible capacitance of 140 F g−1.58 By controlling the temperature of calcination or the additive amount of ZnCl2, the surface area and percentage of mesopores were tuned to appropriate values,59–61 resulting in optimized electrochemical performances. For further improvement of the capacitances of PAN-based CNFs, Nafion/PAN co-electrospun nanofibers were synthesized.62 After carbonization at 800 °C in Ar, the obtained CNFs achieved a high reversible capacitance of 210 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and an energy density of 4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 20 kW kg−1. In addition to PAN-based CNFs, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) can also be employed as a precursor for CNFs. PVA/phenolic resin based CNFs exhibited a high capacitance of 200 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.63 Adding KOH to the spinning solution can adjust the pore distribution to 0.7–1.2 nm, the ideal size for optimum capacitance according to the literature,64 giving rise to a capacitance of 250 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. CNFs can also be synthesized through two steps of Te nanowire-assisted hydrothermal processes.65 After being coated with polypyrrole and carbonized to form an N-doped structure, the CNF was activated and exhibited a capacitance of 202 F g−1.66 Furthermore, all the precursors in this method can be fabricated on an industrial scale, making this process suitable for commercial production.
In addition, using some natural substances as raw materials to fabricate carbon-based 1D nanostructures is also an attractive way for SCs.41–43,67 As an abundant natural product, bacterial cellulose (BC) exhibits a fine 1D nanostructure and can be produced via a simple microbial fermentation process. Further carbonization transforms BC to a CNF nanostructure, which can be used as a flexible electrode for SCs (Fig. 3a and b). This kind of CNF exhibits a specific capacitance of 77.76 F g−1, referred to the weight of a single electrode, at a current rate of 1 A g−1 (Fig. 3c and d).42 Nitrogen doping hydrothermally can increase the capacitance to 186.6 F g−1 at the same current rate (Fig. 3e and f).43 For a further improved performance, N, P hetero-atom doped CNFs derived from BC were synthesized and delivered a capacitance of 204.9 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a high energy density of 7.76 W h kg−1 (Fig. 3h and f).67 In addition to element doping, depositing pseudocapacitive MnO2 is another means to enhance capacitance.42 The specific capacitances can be tuned from 139.78 to 256.74 F g−1 based on the deposition time (Fig. 3d).

2.4. 1D nanostructured metal oxides and hydroxides
Transition metal oxides and hydroxides are two of the most widely used materials researched as electrodes for SCs, as their pseudocapacitive properties provide much higher energy density than carbon. In most cases, transition metal oxides and hydroxides such as MnO2,68 V2O5,69 NiCo2O4,70 Ni(OH)2,71etc. are exploited as cathodes, while Fe2O3 (ref. 72) and MoO3−x (ref. 73) are studied as anodes.
MnO2 is an attractive material for SCs for its high theoretical capacitance (over 1400 F g−1), wide operating voltage range (0–1.0 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode in a neutral electrolyte), and earth abundance, while its poor electrical conductivity severely hinders the actual performance of MnO2.74 Designing MnO2 as 1D nanostructures and further combining it with other conductive materials have been proved to be a rational approach for improved performances.74–77 As carbon-based materials usually function as good conductive scaffolds for SCs, 1D nanostructured MnO2/carbon composites are generated as electrode materials for SCs. CNT film supported electrodeposited MnO2 nanowires exhibit a capacitance of 300 F g−1 at a current rate of 0.77 A g−1.75 MnO2 nanowires/graphene nanocomposites fabricated through several simple solution processes show an energy density of 7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 5000 W kg−1, when assembled with graphene anodes to 2 V asymmetric SCs.76 Yuan et al. reported a kind of MnO2 nanorod electrodeposited on carbon textiles, and the specific capacitance can reach 302 F g−1 at an extremely low mass loading of 0.072 mg cm−2.77 Increasing the mass loading to 0.562 mg cm−2 results in a much lower capacitance of 165 F g−1 but 20 times enhanced areal specific capacitance (109 mF cm−2), compared to the values reported for carbon-based SCs. Conductive polymers are also good options to improve the specific capacitance of MnO2. MnO2/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coaxial nanowires synthesized via a one-step co-electrodeposition method exhibit a capacitance of 210 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−1, and good capacitance retention as the current rate increases from 5–25 mA cm−1.78 Core–shell structured 1D nanocomposites, such as Fe2O3/MnO2,79 Zn2SnO4/MnO2,80 CuO/MnO2,81 Co3O4@MnO2,56 Co3O4@Pt@MnO2,82 WO3−x@Au@MnO2,68 hydrogenated ZnO/MnO2,45 and hydrogenated TiO2/MnO2 core–shell nanowires,74 also exhibit effective improvements on the performances of MnO2. Apart from forming nanocomposites with high conductive materials, controllable tailoring of the 1D morphology of MnO2 is also considered as a rational way to an enhanced performance. The specific capacitance of worm-like MnO2 nanowires grown on carbon textiles is 334.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1,83 which is nearly 2 times higher than the cotton-like nanostructured counterpart. Hierarchical MnO2/MnO2 nanofibrils/nanowires, consisting of a conformal layer of MnO2 nanofibrils evenly coated on the MnO2 nanowires, exhibit a high capacitance of 298 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1 and 174 F g−1 at 250 mV s−1, and a good retention of 85.2% after 1000 cycles of operation as the nanofibril enhances the electric double-layer process.84 Recently, Li et al. reported a sandwich-structured nanotube array consisting of MnO2/Mn/MnO2 synthesized via ZnO nanorod template-assisted electrochemical deposition and subsequent low-temperature annealing processes (Fig. 4a and b).85 As a comprehensive route to improve the electrochemical performance of MnO2, the interlayer Mn metal provides an electron highway and the nanotube structure relaxes the transport of ions, thus leading to a superb specific capacitance of 955 F g−1 (over 2 times higher than the capacitance of MnO2 nanotubes) at a current rate of 1.5 A g−1 (Fig. 4c and d), a high specific energy density of 45 W h kg−1 (Fig. 4e), and an excellent cyclic retention of 95% after 3000 cycles (Fig. 4f). With the current density increasing from 1.5 to 24 A g−1, the capacitance loss of MnO2/Mn/MnO2 nanotube arrays is only ∼30% (Fig. 4d).

(c–f) Comparison of electrochemical performances, including specific capacitances, energy densities, power densities, and cyclic stabilities of MnO2/Mn/MnO2 sandwich-structured nanotube arrays (1) and MnO2 nanotube arrays (2). 
Metal oxides and hydroxides containing Co or Ni are usually operated in an alkaline electrolyte, as their energy storage mechanism involves the reversible reaction between M(OH)2 and MOOH (M = Co or Ni).86,87 Dong et al. developed a wire-shaped supercapacitor using Ni(OH)2 nanowires grown on Ni wires as a cathode.71 The Ni(OH)2 exhibits a specific capacitance of 270 F g−1 at a current rate of 7.5 A g−1, with a maximum voltage of 1.5 V. Cobalt oxides such as CoO and Co3O4 also exhibit high specific areal and high specific capacitances, due to the formation of mesoporous nanowire structures.88–90 Nonetheless, their low conductivities still impose big obstacles. Improving nickel and cobalt oxides with high conductive materials, or compositing them with each other, has been developed and displayed great enhancement on their specific capacitance and cyclic stabilities.88,91,92 For example, by replacing some Co atoms by Ni and forming NiCo2O4 and CoNiO2 nanowires,47,93 a conductivity enhancement of over 2 orders of magnitude, and much better electrochemical activity than both nickel and cobalt oxides are achieved.94 Nickel–cobalt hydroxide nanosheet-coated NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays grown on carbon textiles exhibit an outstanding areal specific capacitance of 1.64 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2.95 The capacitance retention is higher than 67% when the current density is increased from 2 to 90 A cm−2, offering an excellent specific energy density of ∼33 W h kg−1 and a power density of ∼41.24 W kg−1 at high cyclic rates (>150 mA cm−2).
Different from nickel and cobalt oxides, the fast redox of Fe3+/Fe2+ occurs below the normal hydrogen potential, making Fe2O3 usually studied as anodes for SCs.16,72 The amorphous Fe2O3 nanotubes grown on carbon textiles as anodes for flexible SCs exhibit a specific capacitance of 257.8 F g−1 at 1.4 A g−1 (corresponding to 180.4 mF cm−2 at 1 A cm−2) in a LiCl electrolyte.16 Lu et al. reported oxygen-deficient α-Fe2O3 nanorods synthesized via annealing hydrothermally grown FeOOH nanorods in a N2 atmosphere.72 The highest areal specific capacitance obtained is 277.3 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1 in the LiCl electrolyte. Fe2O3 nanorods grown on hybrid graphene/CNT films exhibit a large reversible capacity of 278 mA h g−1 (corresponding to over 800 F g−1) at 1 A g−1.29 Operating Fe2O3 electrodes in an alkaline electrolyte and forming Ni/Fe-like batteries have also been reported to improve the electrochemical performances of Fe2O3.29,96
Vanadium24,69 and molybdenum oxides73 are the two other kinds of promising materials for SCs serving as anodes, respectively. An asymmetric SC based on the CNT/V2O5 nanowire composite anode and commercial carbon cathode with an organic electrolyte exhibits an energy density of 40 W h kg−1 at a power density of 210 W kg−1 and a maximum power density of 20 kW kg−1.24 The SC retains ∼80% of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles with a power density of 820 W kg−1. Xiao et al. developed an asymmetric PANI//WO3−x@MoO3−x SC.73 This device can be operated reversibly between 0 and 1.9 V, with a high areal capacitance of 216 mF cm−2, and an energy density of 0.0019 W h cm−3 at 2 mA cm−2.

2.4.1. 1D nanostructured metal chalcogenides and nitrides. 
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are a series of materials that have lower band gaps and higher electrical conductivities than TMOs. For example, NiCo2S4 has been reported to have an electrical conductivity ∼100 times higher than NiCo2O4.97 The energy storage capabilities of TMCs are realized via the redox reactions of metal ions, similar to the mechanisms of TMOs. 1D hierarchical Ni3S2/CNT exhibits a specific capacitance of 514 F g−1 at 4 A g−1 and 362 F g−1 at 13.3 A g−1.98 Co9S8 nanorod arrays grown on carbon textiles can deliver a high areal capacitance of 2.35 F cm−2 (783.3 F g−1 for the mass of Co9S8, and 113.5 F g−1 for the overall mass of electrode) at 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 5a and b).25 When assembled into a flexible SC format with Co3O4@RuO2 nanosheet arrays as anodes (Fig. 5c), the device exhibits a high areal capacitance of 4.28 F cm−2 at 2.5 mA cm−2 with an output voltage of 1.6 V (Fig. 5d). The capacitance is delivered at ∼1.5 F cm−2, with 90.2% retention after 2000 cycles at 50 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5e). A high energy density of 1.44 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 0.89 W cm−3 is reached (Fig. 5f). Similar to binary metal oxides, binary metal sulfides can offer higher capacitances than single metal sulfides. Ni–Co sulfide nanowires grown on Ni foam with a Ni:Co molar ratio of 1:1 exhibit a specific capacitance of 2415 and 1176 F g−1 at 2.5 and 30 mA cm−2, respectively.99 NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays can deliver an areal capacitance of 0.87 F cm−2 at 4 mA cm−2. Further decorating the nanotubes with CoxNi1−x(OH)2 enables a remarkable shift of the areal capacitance to 2.86 F cm−2 at the same current density.100 Besides oxides and sulfides, 1D transition metal selenides also exhibit great potential for SC applications.101,102

(d–f) Rate capabilities, cycling performances, and Ragone plots of the flexible SCs and SCs in aqueous electrolytes. 
Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) are viewed as good alternatives for carbon-based electrodes for SCs because of their outstanding electrical conductivities. The specific capacitances of TiN and VN nanowires were reported as 123 and 298.5 F g−1, at 10 mV s−1 in an aqueous electrolyte, respectively.48,103 Nonetheless, as TiN and VN are unstable in the aqueous electrolyte, neither of them exhibits satisfactory cyclic stabilities. Employing flexible SC formats with polymer electrolytes can improve the cycling life of TiN and VN nanowire electrodes, in which the electrochemical oxidation and structural pulverization are sufficiently suppressed by the limited amount of water.104,105 For example, symmetric flexible SCs using TiN nanowire electrodes and PVA/KOH electrolytes exhibit a remarkable enhancement on the cyclic stability (Fig. 6). Different bending angles have negligible influence on the shapes of the CV curves (Fig. 6b). The capacitance is preserved at 82% after 15000 cycles of operation (Fig. 6c).47 In contrast, in an aqueous KOH electrolyte, TiN nanowires lose 90% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles. Excellent volumetric capacitance and energy densities of 0.33 F cm−3 and 0.05 mW h cm−3 are achieved at the same time (Fig. 6d and e).

2.4.2. 1D conductive polymeric materials. 
Conductive polymers, including polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and their derivatives, can be synthesized by simple oxidations of the relevant monomers.106 Reversible doping/de-doping of anions is the mechanism of energy storage for conductive polymers, making them exhibit large pseudocapacitances.107 The mechanical instability due to the volumetric change during doping/de-doping results in poor cyclic stabilities of conductive polymers.108 Therefore, 1D nanostructures are rational options for high electrochemical performance conductive polymers.
PANI nanowire arrays on graphene oxide sheets exhibited a high specific capacitance of 227 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and a good capacitance retention of 92% after 2000 cycles.22 3D porous reduced graphene oxide film-supported PANI nanowires can deliver a specific capacitance of 362 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a two-electrode flexible format.109 In addition, the bending angle does not affect the shape of the CV curve. A chip-type micro-supercapacitor fabricated via in situ electrodeposition of PANI nanorods on the surface of reduced graphene oxide patterns possesses a capacitance as high as 970 F g−1 at 2.5 A g−1 and a good stability of 90% after 1700 cycles.110 Symmetric flexible SCs using PANI nanowires grown on carbon textiles as electrodes were reported to have an areal capacitance of ∼1.88 F cm−2.111
1D nanostructured PANI/CNT composites are also widely researched as high performance electrodes for SCs.112–114 Meng et al. developed a flexible paper-like SC assembled by PANI-coated CNT networks (Fig. 7a–d).113 The specific capacitance of this flexible SC is 332 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 7e and f). As an advantage of the polymer-based structure, the density of the total device is only 1.18 g cm−3, resulting in the device mass only 2.79 times of the electrode. A high specific capacitance of 31.4 F g−1 is obtained based on the weight of the entire device, more than 6 times the counterpart of a high-level commercial SC (Fig. 7g and h). Furthermore, the thickness of the device is comparable to a piece of A4 print paper with an outstanding flexibility, making it surpass the current commercial SCs and exhibiting great potential for power sources of wearable electronic devices (Fig. 7b).23 Carbonaceous shell-coated PANI (PANI@C) and PPy (PPy@C) nanowires have exhibited excellent capacitance retentions of 95% and 85% after 10000 cycles.115 TiO2@PPy nanowires also possess a good capacitance retention of 92.7% after 3000 cycles when assembled into a flexible SC format and tested under normal, bent and twisted conditions.44

In addition to carbon, TMO, TMC, TMN and polymer-based 1D nanostructured active materials, 1D pure metals23 and inorganic nonmetal116 compounds also reveal their great potential for flexible SCs. The electrochemical performances of all the materials mentioned in this section are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). In short, the development of high performance 1D nanostructured materials opens a new avenue to next generation flexible SCs with much improved energy and superior power densities.

3. Different structured flexible SCs
Traditionally, SCs are categorized into two types, symmetric and asymmetric SCs, based on whether their electrodes are identical. While for flexible SCs, being symmetric or asymmetric is irrelevant to their flexibilities. Therefore, varieties of flexible SCs are divided into three types, sandwich-type, wire-shaped, and chip-type flexible SCs according to their detailed formats and applications. Their detailed performances are also summarized in a tabular form (Table S2 in ESI†).
3.1. Sandwich-type flexible SCs
Sandwich-type is the most common structure for flexible SCs as they are easy to assemble. Typically, a sandwich-type flexible SC consists of two layers of planar flexible electrodes with a gel electrolyte layer between them. To reveal the flexibilities of sandwich-type flexible SCs, excellent electrochemical performances under bent, folded, and twisted conditions are required.
As the most widely used format, many sandwich-type flexible SCs have been studied in recent years, including CNTs//CNTs,12 carbon nanoparticles//MnO2 nanorods,77 TiO2@MnO2//TiO2@C,74 and PANI//WO3−x@MoO3−x,73 and so on. Recently, sandwich-type flexible VOx//VN SCs (Fig. 9) have achieved a high volumetric capacitance of 1.35 F cm−3, based on the volume of the entire device (or 60.1 F g−1 based on the total mass of the active materials) at 0.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8c).103 The device exhibits an operation voltage of 2.2 V and a stable voltage of 1.8 V, due to the different redox potentials of VN and VOx (Fig. 8a). The flexible VOx//VN SC also demonstrates an excellent rate cyclic capability of 74.7% of the capacitance at 0.5 mA cm−2 retained at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 8c). The maximum energy density of 0.61 mW h cm−3 and a power density of 0.85 W cm−3 are achieved at a current density of 0.5 and 5 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 8b). Moreover, folding and twisting the device do not affect its capacitance, ensuring great potential as a power source for flexible electronic devices (Fig. 8d).

3.2. Wire-shaped flexible SCs
The rise of wearable electronic devices makes the development of wire-shaped SCs necessary. Various wire-shaped structures, including Kevlar fibers,13 metal fibers,71 carbon fibers,15 graphene fibers117 and CNT fibers,118 have been exploited as electrodes for these energy storage devices. Among them, CNT fibers are considered as the best alternative to wire-shaped SCs because of their low weights, high conductivities and remarkable flexibilities.118–120 Ren et al. introduced CNT fibers into the wire-shaped SC format.117 The obtained micro-supercapacitors consisting two twisted CNT fibers exhibit a specific capacitance of 13.31 F g−1, an areal capacitance of 3.01 mF cm−2 and a length capacitance of 0.0015 mF cm−1 at 0.002 mA (1.67 A g−1). Lee and coworkers developed a biscrolled yarn SC using a novel gradient biscrolling technology.119 Hundred layers of PEDOT infiltrated CNT films were scrolled into a 20 μm diameter yarn. When woven into a glove, the SC shows a high volumetric capacitance of ∼179 mF cm−3 and excellent cyclic stability (99% after 10000 cycles). Post-growth deposition of other pseudocapacitive materials, e.g. PANI nanowires, can also improve the energy densities of wire-shaped SCs.30
Differing from sandwich-type SCs, the electrochemical performances and flexible properties of SCs are greatly affected by the arrangements of two CNT fibers. Co-axial structured EDLC fibers exhibit a maximum capacitance of 59 F g−1, due to the much decreased contact resistance between two CNT fibers compared with the simply twisted structures.121 For further improvement of flexibility, however, both of the above two structures are limited by being not stretchable. Stretchability is a critical parameter for wearable electronic devices and their power sources. The first stretchable SC consisting of a rubber fiber as the elastic substrate and CNT sheets as electrodes was reported by Peng and coworkers.122 This stretchable SC was fabricated via 5 steps (Fig. 9a), and possessed an excellent flexibility that can be twisted onto different substrates in different shapes, with outstanding stretchability of easily being 100% stretched without any obvious negative effect on the integrity (Fig. 9b–d). The stretchable SC exhibits a capacitance of ∼18 F g−1 after being stretched by 75% for 100 cycles. The specific capacitance can be retained above 90% after 1000 cycles with a strain of 75%. By coating PANI on this stretchable SC, a electrochromic wire-shaped SC was developed to display three different colors, light yellow, blue and green, at different voltages.123 SCs made by wrapping continuous CNT films on pre-stretched elastic fibers (64% polyester and 36% polyurethane) exhibit an extremely high stretchability of being 350% strained with a capacitance of more than 30.7 F g−1, which is twice of the state-of-the-art stretchable SCs under 100% strain.124 PANI coating has also been proved to be effective to improve the energy density of this super-elastic SC.125

3.3. Chip-type flexible SCs
For some implantable medical devices and active radio frequency identification tags, it is important that microscale energy devices can be integrated with them.126 Thus, flexible SCs on chips, or chip-type SCs, are studied as the power sources of these devices.28,110,127–132 The fabrication of chip-type flexible SCs often involves lithographical techniques. A mask designed with a specific circuit pattern is covered on the flexible substrates pre-coated with photoresist films.127 Combined with in situ deposition of active materials and electrolytes, a flexible SC on a chip is made. Benefited from the shortened ionic diffusion length, chip-type flexible SCs typically exhibit a high ratio of energy deliveries at high current rates.128
In 2010, chip-type SCs on Si wafer using a monolithic carbide-derived carbon film were reported to exhibit a high volumetric capacitance of ∼80 F cm−3 for a film thicker than ∼100 μm in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte.127 Later, chip-type flexible SCs based on reduced graphene oxides show the delivery of a high specific capacitance of 285 F g−1, corresponding to the volumetric capacitance of 359 F cm−3.129 For MnO2 nanowire based chip-type SCs, a maximum volumetric capacitance of 15 F cm−2 was achieved at 0.01 mA cm−2 with a loading mass of 5 μg cm−2.130 Even for CVD-grown 3D graphene/CNT micro-SCs on chips, high volumetric capacitances of 1.08 F cm−3 in 1 M Na2SO4 and 1.96 F cm−3 in the BMIM-BF4 electrolyte were exhibited.131 Recently, Wang et al. reported a chip-type flexible SC using PANI nanowire arrays as active materials (Fig. 10a and b).132 All of the three SCs with different line widths of finger of 100, 400, and 800 μm (Fig. 10c and d) exhibit high volumetric capacitances of 588, 487 and 407 F cm−3 at 0.1 mA cm−2 in a voltage window of −0.2 to 0.8 V (Fig. 10e and f). Their capacitances remained higher than 80% when the current density is increased from 0.1 to 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 10f), indicating excellent rate capabilities. Moreover, the voltage window and current can be further improved via connecting several chip-type SCs in a tandem or parallel format (Fig. 10g and h).

Chip-type SCs can also be fabricated through arranging wire-shaped electrodes in specific sequences (in tandem or parallel).15,133 Xiao et al. reported a MnO2-coated carbon fiber based wire-shaped SC.15 A chip-type flexible SC formed by 3 SCs connected in tandem shows a voltage window of 0 to 2.4 V. A maximum capacitance of ∼75 μF has been achieved by connecting 50 fibers in parallel. Another chip-type SC based on ZnCo2O4 nanowire arrays grown on carbon fibers exhibits a specific capacitance of ∼2.25 F g−1 in the voltage range of 0 to 1.5 V when 30 fibers are connected in parallel.133
4. Conclusion and perspective
In this review, we summarize the recent progress on 1D nanostructured materials for flexible SCs. To date, great advances have been achieved in developing electrodes based on 1D nanomaterials with high flexibilities and extraordinary electrochemical performances. 1D nanostructured materials exhibit several extraordinary features, such as high specific area, efficient 1D electron transport, and excellent mechanical strength, enabling them to be the best alternatives as flexible conductive substrates and active materials. When working as conductive frameworks for SCs, CNTs, CNFs and non-carbon 1D nanomaterials as well as their composites display low weights, satisfactory flexibilities and high conductivities. For the pursuit of materials with excellent electrochemical performances, including high energy densities, super power densities and excellent cyclic stabilities, various 1D nanostructured carbon, TMOs, TMCs, TMNs and polymers have been fabricated. Engineering nanocomposites with specific structures and tailoring 1D nanomaterials are also proved as effective ways to make flexible SCs become more energetic and high-power.
To fulfill different applications, flexible SCs are designed mainly into three structures, sandwich-type SCs, wire-shaped SCs, and SCs on chips. Sandwich-type SCs are easy to be fabricated. Wire-shaped SCs are suitable for wearable energy textiles and can be designed with stretchabilities. Chip-type SCs are of high volumetric capacitances and considered as promising power sources for future implantable medical devices and active radio frequency identification tags. Nonetheless, the development of materials of higher energy densities is still widely needed, which is essential to develop super energetic flexible SCs. On the other hand, most flexible SCs are currently handmade in laboratories. Their manufacture on an industrial scale is another critical challenge for the development of flexible SCs.
