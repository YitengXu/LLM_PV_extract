It is desirable to capture outdoor thermal energy and convert it into electrical energy. Energy harvesting experiments based on the thermoelectric behavior of carbon fiber reinforced cement composites (CFRC) have been performed for the first time under simulated solar irradiation. The thermoelectric figure of merit (1.334 × 10−7) was determined at room temperature for CFRC with a carbon fiber content of 1.0 weight percent. A slab sample was used to estimate the energy harvesting quality of CFRC at a temperature difference of about 60 °C. 4–5 μw of power was obtained from a one square meter CFRC slab with a thickness of 20 mm. The harvested energy of this one square meter CFRC slab reached a maximum of 8.4 × 10−6 J over 420 minutes of irradiation, while its surface temperature increased quickly.
1 Introduction
Energy harvesting technology allows the capture of unused ambient energy, such as vibration, strain, light, temperature gradients, and energy of gas and liquid flows, and turns it into usable electrical energy, which can provide cost-effective and more environmentally friendly solutions.1–4 The excellent thermoelectric capability of carbon fiber reinforced cement composites (CFRC) permits fascinating potential future applications in ambient energy harvesting. In big cities, intensive solar radiation in summers increases the surface temperature of pavements and building roofs to up to 60 °C. The heated surfaces can cause the ambient temperature to further increase.5–8 Therefore, it is desirable to capture the outdoor thermal energy existing in cities using the CFRC thermoelectric behavior, which converts heat into electrical current and stores it. If a sufficient thermoelectric conversion efficiency of CFRC can be tailored by composite engineering, the surface temperature of the pavements and roofs can be decreased and more electrical energy can be collected in the summer. The cooling of outdoor temperature would allow a reduction in the urban heat-island effect in cities and reduce energy use in the summer.
In the past decade, the thermoelectric behavior of CFRC has attracted considerable attention. Wen and Chung reported the Seebeck effect of CFRC resulting from the directional movement of hole carriers, which act as p-type thermoelectric materials.9 Moreover, they observed a percolation threshold of carbon fiber content when the absolute Seebeck coefficient of CFRC changed from positive to negative. Wen and Chung also demonstrated that the CFRC Seebeck coefficient is dominated by the mobility and scattering of carriers and can be improved by using bromine-intercalated carbon fiber.10–12 The addition of carbon fiber and graphite powder could enhance the linearity and reversibility of the Seebeck effect in CFRC.13,14 Cao and Sun indicated that ambient moisture has no effect on CFRC thermoelectric power,15,16 which is favorable for its practical applications. CFRC-based thermocouples with sensitivity of up to 70 μV per °C have also been achieved by using junctions made with steel fiber cement paste and CFRC, side by side.17 Recently, Demirel and Yazicioglu investigated the thermoelectric features of carbon fiber reinforced lightweight concrete.18 Thermoelectric behavior of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/carbon fiber-cement based composites was studied by Yao and co-workers.19 Their work showed that the CNTs have considerable influence on the thermoelectric behavior by contributing hole conduction, which is similar to carbon fiber. Although considerable work has been done on the CFRC thermoelectric behavior so far, research has not focused on the thermoelectric transformation efficiency of CFRC yet. The thermal conductivity, electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient of CFRC have not been studied simultaneously. However, these studies are essential for the practical application of CFRC for energy harvesting in the future.
Energy harvesting technology based on the thermoelectric behavior of CFRC, which will be hopefully applied to concrete pavement and building roofs, has aroused unusual attention. The latest literature reports a simulation process of CFRC energy harvesting based on the data of dielectric constants.2,20 The simulation results indicated that CFRC is a good and effective energy harvesting material to capture outdoor thermal energy during the summer.
In this work, CFRC thermoelectric performance is characterized by the thermoelectric figure of merit and maximum thermoelectric power output on the basis of the measurements of thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of CFRC. A set-up for simulating solar irradiation was also established to study the energy harvesting process of CFRC. The harvested energy was stored using a harvesting circuit consisting of a full bridge diode rectifier.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
The carbon fiber was based on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and obtained from Jiyan Carbon Co., Ltd (Jilin, China). Its diameter was seven micrometers. Its length was approximately five to seven millimeters and the electrical resistivity was 16–25 × 10−3 Ω cm. Its tensile strength and modulus were 2.6–2.9 GPa and 210–230 GPa, respectively. PAN-based carbon fiber has relatively more graphite crystallite structure and larger electrical conductivity than pitch-based carbon fiber, which benefits the mechanical properties of CFRC. Carbon fiber was used in the amounts of 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 wt% by mass of cement in the composites. No aggregate was used. The cement used was sulphate–aluminate cement (P.O.42.5R) obtained from the Qinling Cement Plant of China. The water/cement ratio was maintained at 0.34, 0.40 and 0.44 for obtaining the same rheological behavior of pastes, corresponding to each specimen with carbon fiber contents of 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 wt%. Moreover, identical amounts of polyocarboxy acid super-plasticizer, 0.50 wt% by mass of cement, and 0.05 wt% defoamer (tributyl phosphate) were employed in the composites. Carboxymethyl cellulose was employed as the fiber dispersant in the amounts of 0.08–0.16 wt% by mass of cement for all the specimens, and sodium citrate was used as a set retarder in an amount of 0.10 wt% by mass of cement. The variant weight ratio of dispersant could avoid poor fiber dispersion in specimens with higher fiber content or redundant dispersant in specimens with low fiber content. Detailed mixture proportions of the four specimens are shown in Table 1.

2.2 Specimen fabrication
An aqueous dispersive process was used to make carbon fiber homogenous in the CFRC. Carboxymethyl cellulose and carbon fiber were first added to water. Defoamer was then added into this mixture, which was further treated by ultrasonic wave for several minutes until a uniform dispersion state of carbon fiber was accomplished. The obtained mixture, cement, polyocarboxy acid super-plasticizer and sodium citrate were subsequently placed in a bowl of JJ-5 mortar mixer in order and mixed for several minutes to achieve good workability. The final mixture was poured into an oiled mould to form the test specimens, and then compacted by a GZ-85 electric vibrator to diminish air bubbles. In the end, the as-received specimens were demoulded after 24 h and cured in air at room temperature and a relative humidity of about 95% for three days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) was employed to characterize the microstructure and dispersion of carbon fibers on the fractured surface of the specimens.
2.3 Testing methods
2.3.1 Electrical conductivity measurement. DC electrical conductivity was measured by the four-probe method using a Fluke B15 multimeter. Copper gauze with a mesh size of 2.0 × 2.0 mm2 was used as the electrode, which was first polished with sandpaper, then cut into four square electrodes and fixed on the oiled cuboid moulds (160 × 40 × 40 mm3). The abovementioned paste mixture was then poured into the moulds to form specimens. Four electrodes were distributed symmetrically along the length of the specimen, where the two outer electrodes for current measurement were 140 mm apart and the inner electrodes for voltage measurement were 120 mm apart. A portion of copper gauze from each electrode was extended approximately two millimeters high on one side of the specimen for convenient electrical contact between the electrodes and conduct wires.
2.3.2 Thermal conductivity measurement. Thermal conductivity was measured with a thermal conductometer (PBD-12-4P, Luoyang ATLIRR Instrument Co., Ltd.) using the principle of one-dimensional steady-state conduction. The abovementioned paste mixture was poured into an oiled disc-shaped mould to form specimens with a diameter of 180 mm and a height of 20 mm. The obtained disc-shaped specimens were placed in the thermal conductometer. Both the circular surfaces of the disc-shaped specimens were heated separately and reached the heat steady state gradually, while a stable temperature difference was maintained between the hot and cool circular surfaces in the experiments. Heat flow was perpendicular to the two circular surfaces and absorbed by a central calorimeter. Finally, the thermal conductivity of CFRC was automatically calculated by the thermal conductometer.
2.3.3 Seebeck coefficient measurement. Seebeck coefficient was measured according to the previously reported method14,15,21 using our homemade experimental apparatus. The two opposite ends (40 × 40 mm2) of rectangular specimens with a size of 160 × 40 × 40 mm3 were first polished with sandpaper and then used to carry out the measurements. Heat was applied to one of the square opposite surfaces of the specimen using a platelet resistance heater, while the opposing surface was kept at room temperature. The ambient room temperature was actively controlled by the air conditioning system to maintain a constant of 25 °C. The resistance heater was controlled automatically by a thermostat (Shimaden FP93, Shimaden Co., Ltd) and heated from room temperature to 90 °C at a rate of 0.01 °C s−1. The thermal contact between the heater and specimen was enhanced by a copper plate with a thickness of 8 mm, which possessed a hole to place the T-type thermocouple for measuring the hot end temperature. Another identically sized copper plate and thermocouple were arranged at the opposite end to capture the room temperature. Refined copper powders were spread between the copper plates and the specimen surface to further enhance the thermal and electrical contact. Two copper wires were also applied between the copper plates and the specimen surface at two opposite ends for thermoelectric power measurement by a Fluke B15 multimeter through a voltage amplifier. The entire experimental apparatus was fixed by a steel frame to ensure close contact. The apparent Seebeck coefficient can be obtained from the plot of the relationship between the thermoelectric power and the temperature difference of the two opposing ends. The absolute thermoelectric coefficient of the specimens was then determined using the apparent Seebeck coefficient and the absolute thermoelectric power of copper (2.34 μV per °C).22
2.4 Energy harvesting experiment
An experimental apparatus was set up to investigate the energy harvesting behavior of CFRC under simulated solar irradiation (as shown in Fig. 1). The thick rectangular slab-shaped specimen (300 × 165 × 30 mm3), prepared by pouring the wet paste mixture into a mould, was placed on two foam ceramics-based sides. A 500 W halogen lamp was used to simulate solar irradiation and increase the concrete surface temperature to over 60 °C. The lamp was positioned directly at a height of 38 cm above the specimen and fixed at an angle of 45° with respect to the horizontal plane. A halogen lamp was suitable for simulating solar irradiation because it typically transmits a similar spectral range of 300–2500 nm as that of sun.6,23–25
 Fig. 1  Experimental set-up for investigating the energy harvesting behavior of CFRC under solar irradiation simulated by a 500 W halogen lamp. 
Two sheets of rectangle copper gauze (320 × 185 mm2) with a mesh size of 2.0 × 2.0 mm2 were first polished with sandpaper and then embedded in the slab-shaped specimen as the electrodes. Two gauze electrodes were distributed symmetrically along the height of the specimen and 20 mm apart. Reserved 10 mm copper gauze on the fringe of the specimens was used as a connector lug to the energy harvesting circuit. A full bridge diode rectifier circuit was utilized to store the charges based on four parallel 477 μF external storage capacitors. Four diodes were used to cause the charge to flow in one direction to the external storage capacitors. The charge provided by the thermoelectric behavior of CFRC flowed in one direction in the energy harvesting circuit and caused the increase in the voltage of the external storage capacitor, which was measured by Victor VC9801A+ multimeter.
3 Results and discussion
Fig. 2 shows a typical SEM image of the prepared CFRC specimens. It can be seen that the carbon fiber was dispersed homogeneously in the cement matrix, and no bundling fiber was observed in the entire material. Table 2 shows the electrical conductivity of CFRC containing different amounts of carbon fiber. It can be observed that the electrical conductivity increases with increasing carbon fiber content from 0.6 to 1.0 wt% by mass of cement, which is a significant increase (∼100 to ∼1000 times) than that observed in a specimen with no carbon fiber incorporation (∼1.0–5.0 × 10−4 S m−1).26 A sudden growth occurs at the highest carbon fiber weight fraction of 1.0 wt%, which is consistent with the result of the ref. 13. Carbon fiber is an electronic conductor with hole carriers.27 The sharp rise in CFRC electronic conduction was due to the formation of a carbon fiber network in the matrix. When the carbon fiber content is further increased, the electrical conductivity of CFRC remains at an even level and does not noticeably increase.28 The thermal conductivity of CFRC is also indicated in Table 2. Although the carbon weight fraction increased considerably from 0.6 to 1.0 wt%, the thermal conductivity of the CFRC was relatively stable and varied slightly. The intensive phonon scattering by high density microscopic defects existing in CFRC leads to the steady thermal conductivity.

Fig. 3 shows the relationship of the Seebeck voltage (relative to copper) versus the temperature difference for the CFRC specimens. The fine linearity and positive slope of the curves suggest that the specimens have excellent thermoelectric properties and exhibit p-type conductivity.19,29 The slopes of the curves in Fig. 3 yield the apparent Seebeck coefficients. The detailed apparent and absolute Seebeck coefficients (with copper as the reference) are illustrated in Table 3. The absolute Seebeck coefficient is obtained by the apparent Seebeck coefficient along with the absolute Seebeck coefficient of copper (2.34 μV per °C)22 because of the different temperatures of the copper plates and wires used at the two opposite ends during the test.

Positive absolute Seebeck coefficients are given in Table 3, and they increase with the weight fraction of carbon fiber content. Because holes are the majority of carriers which dominate the thermoelectric behavior of CFRC, more hole carriers could emerge from high carbon fiber content specimens. The increasing concentration of hole carriers in CFRC might cause this enhancement, which is evidently dissimilar from the behavior of crystalline thermoelectric materials. The largest absolute Seebeck coefficient of +22.07 μV per °C was also obtained from the specimen with 1.0 wt% carbon fiber, which is as large as that of CFRC reinforced by intercalated carbon fibers.10 Sulphate–aluminate cement used in the prepared specimens might enhance the absolute Seebeck coefficient more positively than Portland cement. The larger absolute Seebeck coefficient is beneficial for obtaining a higher thermoelectric figure of merit and a greater energy harvesting efficiency for CFRC.
The dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) was employed to characterize the thermoelectric performance of CFRC, which is usually determined by the equation, ZT = S2σT/κ, where S, σ, T, and κ are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, temperature and thermal conductivity, respectively.30–33 The preparation of high ZT thermoelectric materials requires the achievement of simultaneous high electrical conductivity, high Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity in the same solid.30 The calculated ZT value of the prepared CFRC at 27 and 89 °C is shown in Table 4. CFRC with a higher carbon fiber weight fraction generally has a larger ZT value. The obtained maximum ZT value is 1.334 × 10−7 at 27 °C and 1.609 × 10−7 at 89 °C for the specimen with 1.0 wt% carbon fiber. These values are smaller than those of crystalline thermoelectrics by seven orders of magnitude because of the significantly low electrical conductivity of these materials. For increasing the ZT value of CFRC, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient should be greatly improved while maintaining a low thermal conductivity. The corresponding work was performed initially by us. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of CFRC can be enhanced simultaneously using metallic oxides and composite engineering.34,35 Because of the large areas of CFRC used in pavements and building roofs, considerable thermal energy of solar radiation could be harvested from the urban environment in the summer.

Maximum electrical power output, Pmax, at matching load conditions could be calculated according to eqn (1), 
(1)where l and s are the length and electrode surface of the specimen, respectively. The S and σ values are assumed to be constant for each specimen in the narrow temperature range of the experiment. Maximum power output of the prepared CFRC specimens with an electrode surface of one square metre as a function of temperature difference is shown in Fig. 4. This figure indicates that the maximum power output increases with increasing temperature difference and carbon fiber content. Cement-based pavements and roofs would possess 4–5 μw of power per square meter under a temperature difference of about 62 °C using only a p-type CFRC with a thickness of 20 mm. A large increase in total output power might be obtained to join CFRC and n-type cement-based materials, which could noticeably improve the Seebeck coefficient.

The CFRC specimen with 1.0 wt% carbon fiber by mass of cement was employed to carry out the energy harvesting experiment because it has the highest ZT value and power output. Fig. 5 shows the normalized harvested energy from a one square meter specimen across the external storage capacitor under simulated solar irradiation. It could be observed that energy can be harvested directly by CFRC. The harvested energy is calculated by the following equation: E = 0.5CU2, where C and U are the capacitance (477 μF) and voltage of the four parallel external storage capacitors, respectively. The harvested energy reached up to 8.4 × 10−6 J over 420 minutes of irradiation, while the surface temperature of the specimen achieved 68 °C quickly.

The simulated harvested energy by CFRC power output is shown in Fig. 6 for CFRC with 1.0 wt% carbon fiber and is compared with the actual harvested energy by external storage capacitors. The absolute power generation harvested from the external storage capacitors in the experiment was much smaller compared with the maximum simulated value. During the experiment, stronger forced convection and heat conduction remove more energy from the hot surface of the CFRC and cause the cold surface temperature to increase. This ultimately reduces power generation.

Improving the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity and maintaining low thermal conductivity can enhance CFRC power generation. Combing phase change materials (PMC) into thermoelectric cell of CFRC is an alternative approach because PMC increases temperature stability on the surface of the thermoelectric cell and provides better performance. Through composite engineering in our laboratory, the Seebeck coefficient of CFRC was increased to 100 μV per °C; the electrical conductivity was also increased.34 Significant efforts would make the thermoelectric cement-based pavements and building roofs viable for reducing the urban heat-island effect in summer and for harvesting more energy.
4 Conclusion
The Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of CFRC were measured to obtain the thermoelectric figure of merit and maximum power output. The CFRC specimen with 1.0 wt% carbon fiber possesses the maximum figure of merit of 1.334 × 10−7 at 27 °C. Energy harvesting experiments under a simulated solar irradiation indicate that CFRC can be employed directly to harvest urban outdoor heat during the summer. The harvested energy per square meter of CFRC reached up to 8.4 × 10−6 J over 420 minutes of irradiation, while its surface temperature remained at 68 °C. 4–5 μw power could be achieved by a one square meter CFRC slab with a thickness of 20 mm under a temperature difference of about 62 °C. Significant efforts would make the CFRC-based pavements and building roofs viable for reducing the urban heat-island effect in summer and for harvesting more energy.
