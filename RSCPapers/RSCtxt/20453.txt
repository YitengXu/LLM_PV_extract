, Accepted 8th May 2023First published on 6th June 2023AbstractPhotoelectrochemical sensors have outstanding advantages including high sensitivity and miniaturization for outdoor use. Recently, perovskite quantum dots have attracted significant attention due to their high photoluminescence quantum yield. Nonetheless, there is still a strong need to improve their performance in challenging aqueous biological applications. In this paper, based on the molecularly imprinted polymer encapsulation of CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dot/TiO2 inverse opal heterojunction structures, linear photoelectrochemical detection of cholesterol in aqueous solution was obtained without the involvement of an enzyme. The attenuation of photocurrent intensity under intermittent irradiation within 900 s (45 on/off cycles) was only 8.6%, demonstrating the superior stability of CsPbBr3 based sensor here. At the same time, the minimum detection limit of 1.22 × 10−9 mol L−1 in buffer conditions was lower than that reported for cholesterol photoelectric sensors. It has also been shown that the photoelectrochemical sensor of CsPbBr3 here outperformed that of CH3NH3PbBr3, which is another important member of the perovskite family. Finally, the proposed photoelectrochemical sensor platform was successfully applied in the determination of cholesterol in challenging serum with satisfactory recovery. The synergism among CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots, TiO2 inverse opal structure and imprinted polymer has led to greatly improved water stability, super selectivity and sensitivity, thus promoting the development of perovskite-based biological sensors.
1. Introduction
Cholesterol (CHOL) is a kind of sterol that is an essential structural component of cell membranes.1 CHOL is also a precursor of steroid hormone, bile acid and vitamin D biosynthesis.2,3 At the same time, CHOL is a routine clinical test item because of its association with cardiovascular and brain disorders.4 Various methods including enzyme colorimetry,5 liquid chromatography,6 spectrophotometry,7–10 electrochemistry11,12 and electrophoresis13 are available for CHOL determination. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) assays, as newly developed techniques, have attracted great attention in recent years. Compared with the above methods, PEC biosensors exhibit characteristics of fast response, high sensitivity, low cost and portable miniaturization.14,15 Due to their reduced background signals, PEC sensors are also considered as substitutes for traditional electrochemical sensors.16 The separation of the excitation light source from the photocurrent generated as a detection signal also contributes to the higher sensitivity in PEC sensors.17
Photoelectrically active materials produce photocurrents under light irradiation, and their performance has a crucial impact on PEC performance. Lead halide perovskite (LHP) semiconductors exhibit exceptional optoelectronic properties.18 Due to their prominent characteristics, including high emission efficiencies, effortlessly adjustable optical bandgaps, outstanding charge-transport characteristics and facile processing, hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have attracted substantial interest and shown great potential in various applications, such as light-emitting devices, solar cells and sensors.19–26 Despite these excellent properties, it is worth noting that there are only a few perovskites reported with sensing probes, such as those detecting antibodies when applied in the analysis of complex biological samples. Their high sensitivity to moisture and oxygen hinders their wider sensing applications in polar phase systems, which are common in the biological field.
Recently, all-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (PQDs, CsPbX3, X = I, Br, Cl) have emerged as promising candidates for photodetection with a maximum certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.7%, which is comparable to that of silicon and thin-film solar cells.27 With higher moisture stability than hybrid inorganic/organic perovskites, inorganic halide perovskites have been explored for sensing various ions,28 hydrogen sulfide,29 pesticides,30,31 ampicillin,32,33 dopamine,34 melamine,35 salicylic acid (SA),36 tetracycline,37 alpha-fetoprotein,38 etc. However, their instability in polar solvents remains completely unresolved. It continues to be an urgent task to enhance their water resistance stability, especially for the biochemical applications of these quantum dots (QDs). In the past few years, different methods including exchange of ligands, capping and heterostructure formation have been investigated to enhance the stability of perovskites, for example, the introduction of ytterbium acetate into CsPbCl3 nanocrystals;39 Cr3+, Yb3+ and Ce3+ tri-doping of CsPbCl3;30 incorporation of perovskite into metal–organic frameworks,31 polymer fibres32 and nanogels;33,34 coating with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide/mineral oil35 and polymer surface ligand/silica;37 and the liquid-phase sintering of lead halide perovskites with metal–organic framework glasses.18 In differing from the above strategies, it has been found that TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals are able to enhance not only the stability but also the photochemical response of perovskites. The three-dimensional (3D) porous structure of TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals (IOPCs) with their high specific surface area is beneficial for the stability of PQDs immobilized on IOPCs. It promoted electron transfer between the FTO substrate and QDs within a short electron diffusion distance.37,38 In addition, the photonic stop band in IOPCs could increase the effective optical path length and the interaction between the excitation light and QDs. All these properties contributed to enhancing the photochemical response of the PEC sensor.40 Thus, the integrated use of IOPCs and PQDs has been applied in the PEC detection of alpha-fetoprotein,38 aflatoxin B-141 and dopamine.42 However, without the conjugation of bio-affinity components, it is almost unable to carry out selective detection in complex biological samples.
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are known as artificial antibodies with high specificity and affinity. Their distinct advantages, such as high stability and low-budget production, make MIPs an attractive alternative to natural receptors43,44 because the MIP matrix-encapsulated QDs can not only assemble the recognition sites onto the surface of the perovskite-based PEC sensor, but they can also enhance the stability of the perovskite materials. MIP-capped CsPbX3 perovskite-based fluorescence sensors,45,46 luminescence sensors,47 electrochemiluminescence sensors,48–50 photoluminescence sensors51 and photochemical sensors52–56 have been reported. However, except for one of our studies,54 in relevant studies conducted thus far, there have been no other perovskite/MIP-based sensors applied to serum or blood samples. The perovskite PEC sensor for salicylic acid52 and CHOL53 was used in serum sample treated by organic solvents. There was no evidence of water stability, which is a basic requirement in clinical field applications.
Due to their outstanding emission efficiencies, metal halide perovskites have shown great potential in the photoelectric sensor field. In this paper, based on our previous work,54 after incorporating CsPbBr3 into TiO2 IOPCs, MIP was used to functionalize and further encapsulate CsPbBr3. Another novel lead halide perovskite PEC sensor was then successfully fabricated herein, showing superior stability, high detection sensitivity and selectivity in an aqueous serum sample. It also turned out that, with higher stability and lower detection limit, the performance of the CsPbBr3 PEC sensor outperformed that of CH3NH3PbBr3.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Mechanism of the PEC principle of MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3-based photoelectronic detection
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the working process of MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 sensor preparation and its detection of CHOL includes the following steps: (1) the self-assembly of TiO2 IOPCs on an ITO glass substrate; (2) the formation of TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD heterogeneous structures; (3) the MIP polymerization and encapsulation of TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD heterogeneous structures; (4) the template elution from the MIP layer, leaving the imprinted cavity on the surface of the MIP; and (5) the application of the MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD PEC sensor for CHOL detection.

(7) A diagram of photoelectrochemical detection in the three-electrode system and the binding of CHOL into the imprinted polymer. 
The working principle of the established PEC sensor is that under visible light irradiation from a 500 W fibre source, a photocurrent is generated from the MIP-encapsulated TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD heterogeneous structure (Fig. 2). Both TiO2 and CsPbBr3 QDs were excited with the photogeneration of electrons and holes. The band gaps of CsPbBr3 QDs and TiO2 are about 2.19 eV and 3.2 eV, respectively. The conduction band edge of TiO2 is slightly lower than that of CsPbBr3 PQDs. This transition match between the energy levels of CsPbBr3 QDs and TiO2 made it easier for the photogenerated electrons to transfer from the conduction band of CsPbBr3 QDs to the ITO surface through TiO2 IOPCs. In addition, due to the presence of holes and channels in the TiO2 IOPCs and MIP layer, the transfer of electrons in these holes and channels was helpful in reducing charge transfer resistance and electron-hole recombination, thus increasing the photocurrent and thereby greatly reducing the direct charge recombination in CsPbBr3 itself whereupon sensitivity of the PEC sensor was improved (Fig. 2).

Afterwards, the template-eluted MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 PQD sensor was applied to the detection of CHOL. Driven by the fitting of shape and chemical interactions between the CHOL and the imprinted recognition cavity in the MIP layer, the imprinted cavity selectively captured CHOL molecules in the sample. The CHOL molecules that were captured and entrapped in the imprinted cavity of the MIP layer blocked electron transfer between the electrode and electrolyte, resulting in a decrease in photocurrent (Fig. 2B). Quantitative PEC analysis of CHOL was performed according to the relationship between the change in photoelectron current and the target concentration.
3.2 Experimental optimization in the preparation of MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3
3.2.1 Optimization of the MIP preparation. A suitable porogen for MIPs was investigated to avoid the decomposition of CsPbBr3 QDs during the preparation of MIPs. Based on the study of organic solvents including n-hexane, toluene, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, acetic acid, ethanol and N,N-dimethylformamide, a mixed solution of toluene and chloroform was chosen as the solvent for the preparation of MIPs (details are given in the ESI†).The ratio of functional monomer to template during the preparation of the MIP affects the construction of the imprinted recognition cavity and the transport of photogenerated electrons in the MIP layer. In this paper, different molar ratios of templates and functional monomers (from 1:10, 1:8, 1:6, 1:4 to 1:2) were compared. Under an optimized bias potential (details are given in the ESI†), there was a distinct increase in the photocurrent observed for MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 photoelectrodes when the molar ratio increased from 1:2 to 1:6 (Fig. 3). After reaching the maximum, the photocurrent decreased when the concentration of functional monomer was further increased. Therefore, the optimal molar ratio of template to functional monomer was 1:6, in which there were a large number of recognition sites for CHOL molecules in the MIP@TiO2 IOPCS/CsPbBr3 QD electrode, simultaneously presenting numerous electron transmission channels. In contrast, when the molar ratio was greater than 1:6, the photocurrent decreased significantly. The blocking effect of charge transfer caused by the excessive concentration of functional monomers was dominant. Additionally, the proper elution time during MIP preparation was also shown to be 15 minutes (details are given in the ESI†).

The PEC measurements of the modified electrode were carried out under visible light irradiation in a pH = 7.0 phosphate buffer containing 0.5M Na2SO4 solution and 0.1M CsBr at a bias potential of 0.6 V (500 mW cm−2). 

3.2.2 Study of the optimal amount of CsPbBr3 QDs. The amount of CsPbBr3 QDs introduced in the establishment of the PEC sensor was optimized. As can be observed in Fig. 4A, when 30 μL of CsPbBr3 QD solution was added during the preparation of the MIP@CsPbBr3 QD electrode, the photocurrent was at its highest, approximately equal to the system with 45 μL of CsPbBr3 QDs. However, it was also found that 30 μL of CsPbBr3 QDs used in the preparation of the MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD electrode presented markedly higher photocurrents than the other two photoelectrodes prepared with 45 μL and 60 μL of QDs (Fig. 4B). The photocurrent decreased instead if the volume of CsPbBr3 QDs was further increased. The photocurrent in the 60 μL CsPbBr3 system was only one-fifth of that in the 30 μL CsPbBr3 QD system. Enough CsPbBr3 is a prerequisite for photocurrent. When the amount of QDs exceeded the optimum, CsPbBr3 QDs gradually agglomerated. There were also more crystal defects leading to nonradiative recombination of electrons and holes, thus reducing the probability of electrons reaching the electrode surface. At the same time, more holes in TiO2 IOPCs were blocked by the higher amount of CsPbBr3 QDs. This was detrimental to the channel of electron transmission necessary for photocurrent. Therefore, the optimal volume of CsPbBr3 QDs here was 30 μL.

3.2.3 Optimization of inverse opal structure assembly. The experimental conditions that influenced the inverse opal structure assembly were optimized (as shown in the ESI†). Fig. S1A† shows the SEM data of inverse opal. Fig. S1B† displays the assembled PMMA inverse opal with bright green structural colour.
3.3 Characterization of TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QDs
3.3.1 Characterization of CsPbBr3 QDs. The prepared CsPbBr3 QD solution was colloidal with a bright green color. In the UV-Vis spectrum of CsPbBr3 QDs, there is a band at 505 nm (Fig. 5A, red line) and a narrow emission peak at 515 nm, whose full width at half maximum (FWHM) peak is only 17.65 nm, can be observed (Fig. 5A, blue line). According to measurements, the average photoluminescence quantum yield of this material turned out to be about 89.64% under 369.54 nm irradiation (Table S1 in the ESI†). In addition, CsPbBr3 QDs with typical cubic structures were revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Fig. 5B). The average size of the CsPbBr3 QDs was more than 5 nm.

3.3.2 SEM characterization of electrodes. The surface topography of the differently modified electrodes was studied by SEM. TiO2 IOPCs exhibited a hexagonal IOPC structure (Fig. 6A). In the image of TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3, the loading of QDs can be observed (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6C shows the SEM image of MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3. The MIP layer with its morphology of thick branches offered an excellent protective layer for the inner TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3. The dendritic structure in MIPs also led to larger surface areas and more recognition cavities advantageous for selective combination with targets. In comparison, such branch morphology was almost not observed on the surfaces of the NIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QDs (Fig. 6D). Since the only difference between the preparation of MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 and NIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 lay in the involvement of CHOL or not, it is deduced that besides becoming involved in 3D imprinted cavity building, CHOL molecules also affected the formation of the composite membrane.

3.3.3 X-ray diffraction characterization. In the X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra (Fig. 7A), curve a represents the XRD pattern of bare ITO. A strong diffraction peak at 25.37° in the XRD curve of TiO2 (curve b) was observed, corresponding to the (101) crystal plane of TiO2 with a typical anatase structure. The XRD patterns of TiO2 IOPCs matched well with the standard card of TiO2 (No. 99-0008). Curve c represents the XRD pattern of CsPbBr3 QDs prepared by ligand-assisted precipitation. Perovskite QDs feature a typical cubic structure. Strong diffraction peaks correspond to the (100), (200) and (300) crystal planes of perovskite QDs, which matched well with the standard card of CsPbCl3 PQDs (No. 18-0366). The typical diffraction peaks of TiO2 and CsPbBr3 QDs are all found in the XRD pattern of TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QDs (curve d), manifesting the effective loading of perovskite QDs on TiO2 IOPCs. The characteristic peaks of the anatase CsPbBr3 PQDs became weak in MIPs/CsPbBr3 QDs /TiO2 IOPCs/ITO due to MIP encapsulation. As a result, XRD analysis supports the construction of the TiO2/perovskite photoelectric heterojunction structure.

3.3.4 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterization. To further confirm the successful fabrication of the MIP outer layer, the MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 film was analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy. Fig. 7B shows the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3. The bands at 2866 cm−1 and 2932 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of NH in polyacrylamide MIP. At 3422 cm−1, there is a characteristic band of the free NH2. The small band at 1637 cm−1 is derived from the bending vibration of NH. The band at 1734 cm−1 is attributed to the CO stretching vibration. The bands at 1092 cm−1 and 1160 cm−1 originate from the stretching vibrations of C–O and C–N, respectively. The band at 1466 cm−1 corresponds to the C–H deformation vibration. Therefore, the chemical composition analysis using FT-IR spectroscopy supports the presence of a layer of polyacrylamide MIP wrapped on the surface of TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3.
3.3.5 Photoluminescence quenching analysis. The formation of a heterojunction between CsPbBr3 QDs and TiO2 was confirmed by the PL quenching experiment.57,58 As shown in Fig. 8A, CsPbBr3 QDs deposited on an ITO substrate showed an average lifetime of 14.0 ns, while CsPbBr3 deposited on TiO2 showed a significantly reduced lifetime of 3.5 ns. The photoluminescence (PL) quenching of CsPbBr3 QDs can be explained by the formation of the TiO2/CsPbBr3 heterojunction, where electrons are extracted by the TiO2 layer (Fig. 8B).

3.3.6 I–T characterization of different electrodes. The photochemical responses of differently modified electrodes under intermittent light irradiation (chopping time: 15 s) were probed by chronoamperometry (I–T test). CsBr was introduced into the electrolyte solution to reduce the degradation of CsPbBr3 QDs and enhance their stability. As shown in Fig. 9A, the photocurrent of the CsPbBr3 QD electrode (curve a) and the TiO2 IOPC electrode (curve b) were only about 2.5 μA cm−2 and 14.5 μA cm−2, respectively. The integration of CsPbBr3 QDs and TiO2 IOPCs increased the photocurrent of the TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD electrode to 20 μA cm−2 (curve c), approximately five times that of the pure CsPbBr3 QD electrode. The synergistic effect of CsPbBr3 QDs and TiO2 IOPCs on boosting the photocurrent was striking. After eluting the templates in MIPs, the photocurrent of the electrode increased significantly to approximately 42 μA cm−2 (curve d). The porosity in TiO2 IOPCs brought by the imprinted cavities promoted the transfer of electrons to the electrode surface, reducing the re-combination of electrons and holes. Furthermore, the more remarkable change of photoelectric current in the MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 electrode (curve d) than in the NIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 electrode (curve g) also supported the critical role of imprinted cavities in electron transfer. In addition, the photocurrent of MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 (42 μA cm−2, curve d) was not equal to the simple sum of the photocurrent of MIP@CsPbBr3 and TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 alone, indicating the electron transfer enhancement brought by the synergism of TiO2 IOPCs and MIPs.

(B) The EIS spectrum of (a) MIPs@CsPbBr3 QDs/TiO2 IOPCs/ITO (before elution); (b) MIPs@CsPbBr3 QDs/TiO2 IOPCs/ITO (after elution); (c) TiO2 IOPCs/ITO; and (d) ITO. 
When the template-eluted MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD electrode was dipped into the electrolyte solution containing CHOL, the photocurrent value was about 36.5 μA cm−2 (curve e). Compared with the non-binding of CHOL (curve d), the decrease in the photocurrent was attributed to the blocking of photoelectric transfer by CHOL occupying the imprinted cavities after selective CHOL binding. For the NIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD electrode, there was only a minor change in photocurrent before and after template binding (curves f and g) due to nonspecific adsorption. This once again supported the successful assembly of selective CHOL MIP cavities on the surface of the MIPs@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD electrode. Consequently, CHOL was photoelectrically detected according to the change in photocurrent in this way.

3.3.7 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. The analysis using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was probed to examine electron transfer kinetics on the electrode surface. EIS typically includes a linear part at lower frequencies and a semi-circular part at higher frequencies, corresponding to the diffusion process and the electron-transfer-limited process. The diameter of the semicircle reflects the resistance of charge transfer (RCT). It is revealed (Fig. 9B) that the EIS curve of the bare ITO electrode was almost straight (curve d), indicating faster electron-transfer kinetics. Its value of RCT was the smallest, at nearly 25 Ω. When TiO2 IOPCs were assembled on the ITO, the diameter of the semicircle increased (curve c). The semiconductor property of TiO2 hindered the electron transfer of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− and increased RCT (to nearly 150 Ω). When CsPbBr3 and MIPs were further fixed onto the matrix of TiO2 IOPCs, the electrode impedance was at its highest (curve a), suggesting that the insulated polymeric MIPs affected the electron transfer. After the elution of the template with CHOL, the impedance of the TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD electrode decreased (curve b). The imprinted cavities fabricated in the MIP films may facilitate the diffusion of the redox probe and the electron transfer.
3.4 Detection of CHOL with TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD-based PEC sensors
3.4.1 Stability study of the photochemical sensor. Stability in aqueous systems is one of the key challenges faced by perovskites, especially in the biological field. One of the main strategies that has been recently developed to improve the stability of perovskite materials is through polymer or silica encapsulation. In this paper, on the surface of TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QDs, a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was prepared by polymerizing functional monomers, a cross-linker and the target molecules. The 3D selective recognition cavities were obtained after the elution of the target templates from the MIPs. To characterize the stability of the PEC sensor constructed here, the time-dependent photocurrent of the MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD electrode was explored in an electrolyte solution (containing 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 and 0.1 mol L−1 CsBr). As shown in Fig. 10A, after 900 s of intermittent light irradiation (45 on/off cycles), only 8.6% of the initial photocurrent decayed. Before our work, the maximum duration of stability was 200 s, which was achieved with TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD-based PEC detection of alpha fetoprotein.38 With the introduction of MIPs here, the stability of this CsPbX3 QD sensor in aqueous solution was much better than that reported in the literature thus far, demonstrating the synergistic effect existing in CsPbBr3 QDs, TiO2 IOPCs and MIPs. Besides, the sensor's long-term storage stability was studied. After being wrapped and preserved at 4 °C in a refrigerator for 15 days, the photocurrent response of the sensor was maintained at more than 90% of the initial value (Fig. 10B). Overall, the stability of MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QDs in water was outstanding here. Therefore, beside one kind of polymer, MIPs were also employed as recognition elements to construct sensors due to their good stability. The inner heterogeneous structure of TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 was then protected by the outer polymer layer of the MIP.

3.4.2 Study of the linearity between PEC current and CHOL concentration. Under the optimized conditions, the MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD sensor was employed in the detection of CHOL at different concentrations. The upper right corner in Fig. 10C clearly shows the linearity between the change in photocurrent (ΔI) and the logarithm of CHOL concentration when the concentration (C) was in the range of 1.0 × 10−8 mol L−1–1.0 × 10−4 mol L−1. The linear regression equation was ΔI (μA cm−2) = 12.1517 + 1.3635lgC (R2 = 0.9976). According to the standard deviation of the PEC response and the slope, the detection limit (LOD) of the PEC sensor was 1.22 × 10−9 mol L−1, lower than that for the previously reported PEC CHOL sensor (6 μM).59 At the same time, as listed in Table 1, there was no pre-treatment with organic solvent as previously reported.60,61 The direct detection of targets in aqueous solution is greatly convenient for practical clinical applications. The photoelectric response of NIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QDs to different concentrations of CHOL was also studied. With an increase in the concentrations of CHOL, little change in photocurrent reflected the successful formation of CHOL-imprinted cavities on the surface of MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QDs.

3.4.3 Investigation of selectivity in the detection of CHOL. The selectivity of the established PEC sensor in the detection of CHOL was evaluated using triglyceride (TG), albumin (ALB), glucose (Glu) and ascorbic acid (Vc) as interferents. TG is a structural analogue of CHOL. ALB is a highly abundant protein in serum that often interferes with the bioanalysis of biological fluid samples. Glu is the most analyzed target in sweat.62,63 The analysis of Vc can be used to guide personalized nutrition solutions.64 The experimental results indicated that specific CHOL recognition sites have been successfully constructed in the MIP membrane wrapping the matrix of TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QDs.In order to further verify the feasibility of practical applications, the detection of CHOL in serum with the established MIP@TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 QD PEC sensor was investigated. The serum was diluted 1000 times with PBS buffer. It was revealed (Table 2) that in the determination of CHOL with different volumes added to the serum, the analytical recovery ranged from 101.6% to 105.5%. Accordingly, the PEC sensor herein exhibited excellent selectivity and powerful interference immunity. It is also worth mentioning that concerning the MIP-based analysis of CHOL, serum samples were diluted with ethyl acetate,51 or were treated with protein pre-removal and ethanol dilution.55,65 Dilution with an organic solvent or pre-removal of proteins prevents other simultaneous biological assays, which is not advantageous for practical applications. Instead, the sensor constructed here can directly analyze CHOL in direct buffer-diluted serum at a concentration lower than other PEC CHOL sensors.

4. Conclusion
Perovskites have received extensive attention due to their outstanding photoelectrical characteristics. In perovskites, lead halide perovskite (LHP) semiconductors show excellent optoelectronic properties. However, degradation over time, even in moisture, is the Achilles’ heel of lead halide perovskites, which may be the main reason for their limited bio-application. It is challenging to detect targets in serum in the same way as the reported direct detection of dopamine with TiO2/CsPbBr1.5I1.5.41 The advantages of PQDs and TiO2 IOPCs, together with the introduction of antibodies, have been combined in the PEC detection of alpha fetoprotein38 and aflatoxin B-1.41 However, the above-mentioned antibody-integrated TiO2/CsPbX3 PEC sensors were not applied in real serum sample analysis without considering the availability and stability associated with enzyme or antibody-based sensors.38,66 Molecular imprinting technology has been introduced into lead halide perovskite sensors. Notably, the reported MIP@CsPbX3-based fluorescent or electroluminescent sensors are not clinical targets. This paper develops a novel MIP@TiO2 IOPC/CsPbBr3-based biosensor with the highest water stability, selectivity and sensitivity to date for CsPbX3-based PEC sensors in aqueous solutions. First, the integration of MIPs with the TiO2 IOPC/CsPbBr3 heterogeneous structure remarkably improves the stability of perovskite OD. Under continuous irradiation, the sensor's photocurrent is maintained at 91.4% of its initial value after immersing it in an aqueous solution for 900 s. Meanwhile, the outer layer functionalization with MIPs endows the CsPbBr3-based sensor with excellent selectivity for serum samples. Compared with the TiO2 IOPCs/CsPbBr3 heterogeneous structure alone, the synergistic influences in photoelectronic transfer promoted by the TiO2 IOPC porous structure and imprinted cavity are also noticeable. Sensitive and linear detection of CHOL in an aqueous solution is accomplished with a LOD value of 1.22 × 10−9 mol L−1, lower than that of other reported CHOL PEC sensors.
This work presents a MIP-integrated CsPbBr3 PEC platform with prominent stability, and superior selectivity and sensitivity, which can be applied to detect other biological targets in aqueous samples. The strategy described here also promises to promote the application of perovskite-based PEC biosensors in biological and clinical fields.
