    , Accepted 4th December 2013First published on 16th December 2013AbstractThe performance of organic semiconductors as electronic materials is very sensitive to impurity incorporation and reactions. Here we show using first-principles calculations that hydrogen and oxygen impurities introduce distinct changes in the electronic properties of metal phthalocyanines (MPc), a family of organic semiconductors renowned for their light conversion efficiency. Selective adsorption of hydrogen atoms on pyridinic nitrogen atoms of MPc molecules, namely zinc and copper phthalocyanines, modifies the magnetic state of the latter and generates carrier trap states deep in the band gap of MPc crystals. Reactions with O atoms have a lesser effect on MPc electronic properties, while intercalated oxygen molecules give rise to traps below the conduction band minimum. The results identify H and O impurities as important degradation culprits for MPc-based systems, in agreement with pertinent experiments.
1 Introduction
Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic semiconductors have a number of advantageous properties for various electronic applications, such as flexible and mobile devices. However, organic materials also show an enhanced tendency to degrade when exposed to typical ambient molecules, for example hydrogen, oxygen, or water.1–3 Particularly acute points of concern are the modification of the energy band gap when molecular crystals react with extrinsic species and the introduction of levels within the gap. The latter may trap charge carriers, thus limiting carrier mobility in electronic transistors, or acting as recombination centers in solar cells. These effects seem to be ubiquitous and have been detailed through experimental and theoretical studies on several different organic semiconductors, including acenes,4–9 fullerenes,10–14 and carbon-based nano-materials.15–17
Metal phthalocyanines (MPcs) belong to a special class of organic materials.18–20 The co-existence of carbon, nitrogen, and metal atoms in a MPc molecule is responsible for distinct structural and electronic properties21–23 that make metal phthalocyanines well-suited as components of light-conversion systems and electronic transistors. Furthermore, certain MPcs can be employed in spintronics, since they bear magnetic moments that may be manipulated through interactions with external magnetic fields or with suitable substrates.24–33 Clearly, detailed knowledge of processes that affect the electronic and magnetic properties of metal phthalocyanines is fundamental to their use in various applications.
The fact that MPc molecules contain a variety of atom types suggests that, in principle, there are several possible ways through which impurities may react with the molecules and affect their characteristics. Indeed, experimental studies34–36 have shown that reactions of oxygen-related impurities with copper (CuPc) and cobalt phthalocyanines (CoPc) introduce discrete energy levels within the energy band gap of the host system. Other experimental studies37–39 have also demonstrated the importance of exposure to oxygen, hydrogen,40 and hydrogen peroxide41 to the performance of MPc-based devices, but the results are ambivalent, either beneficial or detrimental. This ambivalence relates to the fact that a comprehensive knowledge of the atomic-scale details of impurity insertion within MPc samples is largely missing.
In this article we use extensive first-principles calculations to describe the interactions of oxygen and hydrogen impurities with CuPc and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules and crystals. The results show that the pyridinic nitrogen site of the metal phthalocyanines are the most susceptible to capture a hydrogen or oxygen atom, a selectivity feature that persists even when several H and O impurities are adsorbed. In the case of ZnPc and CuPc crystals, we find that hydrogen adatoms generate deep states within the energy band gap. Likewise, we identify O2 molecules as an important degradation agent for ZnPc and CuPc crystals, as they are associated with states below the conduction band of the host system.
2 Method
The results were obtained using spin-unrestricted density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, using projector-augmented waves42,43 and either a local-density approximation (LDA),44 or a generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) exchange–correlation functional,45 as implemented in the VASP code.46 Unless stated otherwise, the results we report below are based on LDA calculations. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis was set at 350 eV and the convergence criteria for ionic (electronic) relaxation was set at 10−4 eV (10−5 eV). Sampling of reciprocal space employed the Monkhorst–Pack scheme47 and the tetrahedron method48 in total-energy and electronic density of states (DOS) calculations, respectively. Activation energies of adsorption reactions and transformations were obtained using the elastic band method,49 which has been used in previous studies with satisfactory results in different types of materials.50–52
Super cells were used in order to approximate the effects related to individual impurities. In the case of impurity adsorption on a single molecule, the cell contained only one MPc entity with at least 10 Å of vacuum between its periodic images. For calculations of the stability of impurities in MPc crystals we used the so-called β-polymorph.53–55 We have examined two levels of impurity concentrations by using either the primitive unit cell with two molecules or a supercell with four molecules. In this way we could test the convergence of relative stability of impurity configurations with respect to the supercell size. In the following we present results only for the high concentration of one individual impurity or the impurity complex in each primitive unit cell. Total-energy calculations used a 1 × 3 × 1 k-grid, where the y-axis corresponds to the small dimensions of the unit cell.
Due to a well-known limitation of DFT, the calculated LDA energy band gaps (Eg) are significantly lower than experimental values. This band gap problem can be remedied, at least partially, by using post-DFT corrections, for example, in the form of hybrid functionals56 or the so-called GW57 approximation to the self-energy. Another modified DFT approach that is particularly suited for the description of strong on-site Coulomb interactions is the LDA + U method.54 In this work we have used the PBE0 hybrid functional58,59 to analyze the effect of impurities on the electronic properties of the host system through DOS calculations on the unit cell of the β-polymorph with a 2 × 8 × 2 k-mesh. It should be noted that total-energy and DOS calculations with different k-grids confirmed that the results are well-converged with respect to the number of points in reciprocal space.
3 Results
In this section we describe the results of the interaction of hydrogen and oxygen impurities with zinc and copper phthalocyanines. In each case, we first examine the adsorption of impurities on isolated MPc molecules and then investigate the insertion of extrinsic species in MPc crystals. Electronic density of states results are presented in order to assess the effect of impurities on the electronic properties of the materials.
3.1 Hydrogen-related effects
Hydrogen is an ubiquitous impurity in electronic devices and has a complex role with respect to degradation and reliability.60,61Fig. 1 shows a number of possible structures that may result from adsorption of a H atom on a CuPc molecule. These configurations include the case of adsorption on the Cu site [Fig. 1(a) and (b)], on the pyridinic N site [Fig. 1(c)], and on one of the end carbon rings [Fig. 1(d)]. The most stable geometry is shown in Fig. 1(c). Compared to this structure, configurations of Fig. 1(a), (b) and (d) are less stable by 2.00 eV, 0.89 eV, and 0.45 eV, respectively. The pyridinic geometry of Fig. 1(c) is spin-polarized with a magnetic moment of about 2.0 μB (while an impurity-free CuPc molecule has a spin polarization of 1.0 μB) (Table 1).

Similar results are obtained for chemisorption of H atoms on ZnPc molecules, except that the geometry of the type of Fig. 1(a) is not stable and relaxes spontaneously to a configuration similar to the one shown in Fig. 1(b). Adsorption on a pyridinic N site of a ZnPc entity is more energetically favorable than attachment in geometries of the types of Fig. 1(b) and (d) by 1.00 eV and 0.97 eV. Addition of one H impurity introduced spin-polarization in the ZnPc molecule with a total magnetic moment of 1.00 μB. These results for the CuPc and ZnPc cases (as well as similar results on CoPc) reveal an unambiguous site-selectivity trend for the adsorption of H atoms on metal phthalocyanines.
Hydrogen impurities may react with phthalocyanines either in atomic or molecular form. In the latter case, the source of hydrogen is an H2 molecule that dissociates from a MPc molecule. Fig. 2 shows the starting configuration with an H2 species [Fig. 2(a)] over a ZnPc molecule, as well as the direct product of the dissociation, a NH2 complex on a ZnPc pyridinic molecule [Fig. 2(b)]. The high value of 2.2 eV for the dissociation barrier indicates that the process is activated only at elevated temperatures (about 400–500 K). At such high temperatures, the NH2 complex may eventually transform into the most stable dissociation product shown in Fig. 2(c) following steps wherein the H adatom hops over C–N bonds. The energy variation during this multi-part dissociation reaction is shown in Fig. 3.

In fact, the most stable structure, depicted in Fig. 2(d), for a pair of H atoms on a ZnPc molecule has these impurities located on opposite pyridinic sites. The energy of this geometry is lower than that of Fig. 2(c) by 0.16 eV for the ZnPc case. The corresponding energy differences for the case of a H–H pair on a CuPc molecule is 0.29 eV. The magnetic moments for the structures of the type of Fig. 2(d) are 1.0 μB for the case of CuPc and 0.0 μB for ZnPc. Further loading with three or four H atoms at pyridinic sites is energetically favorable over free H2 molecules. The associated gains in energy per attached H impurity are larger than 0.3 eV for the MPc species considered.
Based on the above, an individual H impurity that enters a ZnPc crystal is expected to become trapped at a pyridinic N site. Fig. 4 shows the effect of this isolated impurity on the electronic properties of the system. It compares the electronic density of states of the pristine (impurity-free) ZnPc crystal to the DOS of a ZnPc sample with a H impurity of the type shown in Fig. 1(c). As mentioned above, all DOS results discussed in this work were obtained using calculations based on the hybrid PBE0 functional. Because this approach is very demanding in terms of computational power, we used it only for the case of high impurity concentration wherein one impurity (or set of impurities) appears in each primitive unit cell of the ZnPc (or CuPc) crystal. We will see below that, for such large numbers of extrinsic species, impurity-related levels which lie close to the energy bands of the host system hybridize with the latter. It then becomes unclear whether an impurity creates levels that fall within a host band or gives rise to shallow traps close to the edges of the valence (VB) and conduction (CB) bands.

The arrow points to a H-related deep carrier trap state. The concentration of impurity-laden molecules is 50%. VB (CB) is the valence (conduction) band of the system. 
The calculated PBE0 value for the energy band gap of the pristine ZnPc crystal is 2.13 eV, consistent with the measured optical ZnPc gap of 1.97 eV.62 Similar DOS results (not shown here) for the CuPc crystal give an Eg of 2.18 eV, in very good agreement with the experimental 2.3 eV value.63 The DOS data for Fig. 4 clearly show that the H impurity generates a state that lies deep within the ZnPc energy band gap, about 0.75 eV above the VB maximum. Likewise, an isolated H impurity in a CuPc crystal creates a state with an energy of about 0.80 eV higher than the upper edge of the valence band. The results also show significant impurity-induced modifications in the energy range of the ZnPc valence band. As noted above, this strong hybridization obscures the precise H-related effects in the vicinity of the valence band. Calculations with larger super cells (and thus lower impurity concentrations) could clarify whether the impurities generate shallow traps, but these calculations are prohibitively intensive at present.
We have seen in the above that metal phthalocyanine molecules can be loaded with up to four H atoms at their pyridinic sites. Fig. 5 shows the DOS for the cases of one ZnPc molecule within the β-crystal primitive unit cell with two or four H atoms. As in the single H impurity case, a hydrogen pair generates states close to the center of the band gap of the crystal, about 1.0 eV above the VB maximum. Likewise a quadruple of H adatoms gives rise to two proximal traps that lie 1.1–1.3 eV above the VB maximum. These gap states may, of course, be occupied or empty of electrons depending on the position of the Fermi level, which in turn depends on the operating conditions of a MPc-based electronic device.

The shaded area corresponds to the DOS of the impurity-free crystal. The arrows point to impurity-related deep trap states. VB (CB) is the valence (conduction) band. 
3.2 Oxygen-related effects
We now turn our attention to the interaction of oxygen impurities with MPc molecules and crystals. The adsorption of an oxygen atom on CuPc and ZnPc molecules has certain similarities with that of a hydrogen atom. In particular, for both types of MPcs, the most stable atomic O configuration is similar to the one depicted in Fig. 1(c), albeit with an O atom instead of the H impurity at the pyridinic site. The associated N–O bond has a length of 1.28 Å. Using as reference states O-free ZnPc (CuPc) and oxygen molecules, the pyridinic O-ZnPc (O-CuPc) structure is more stable by 1.0 eV (0.9 eV) per O atom. In other words, O2 dissociation and formation of the O-MPc configuration is an exothermic process, similar to hydrogenation reactions discussed above.
Other metastable configurations resemble the geometries of Fig. 1(a), (b) and (d), again with an O atom in place of the H adsorbate (Table 2). However, the energies of these structures are higher than that of the O adsorbate at the pyridinic site by 3.00 eV, 0.80 eV, and 0.30 eV, respectively, for the CuPc case. The corresponding energy differences for O adsorption on ZnPc are 2.90 eV, 0.54 eV, and 0.35 eV. As in the case of H attachment, atomic O species show an unambiguous selectivity trend for adsorption on the pyridinic sites of metal phthalocyanines.

Oxygen impurities that are attached at pyridinic N positions within a ZnPc β-crystal modify, to a certain extent, the electronic properties of the material. Based on DOS results (not shown here), such O species cause a reduction of the energy band gap of the system by 0.16 eV, when the concentration of defective molecules is 50%. In contrast to the hydrogen case, however, atomic oxygen impurities do not generate deep carrier trap states. In other words, the adsorption of atomic O species has a less pronounced effect on the physical characteristics of ZnPc samples than hydrogen insertion.
Given that atomic O impurities do not appear to degrade (at least for the concentrations considered here) the properties of MPc crystals, other O-related species ought to be the culprits for pertinent observations about carrier trap formation in O-exposed MPc samples.37–39 Oxygen atoms typically enter electronic systems from a molecular ambient. We thus examined the effect non-dissociated O2 molecules have on the electronic properties of ZnPc and CuPc crystals. Specifically, we considered the case of an O2 species between the layers of a crystal. For both ZnPc and CuPc crystals, the insertion of an O2 molecule in the interlayer space is accompanied by an energy increase of 0.3–0.4 eV. This small energy penalty suggests that a low number of oxygen molecules may indeed exist in-between the layers of ZnPc and CuPc crystalline samples.

Fig. 6 shows the electronic density of states of a zinc phthalocyanine crystal with one O2 impurity per two ZnPc molecules. Comparison with the DOS of the pristine ZnPc system reveals that the impurity hybridizes and modifies the conduction and the valence band of the material. In addition, the O2 molecule generates a state in the energy band gap of the material, about 0.6 eV below the CB minimum. The results are essentially the same in the case of O2 intercalation within a CuPc crystal. Specifically, there is an O2-related gap state about 0.5 eV below the CuPc conduction band. These O2-induced gap states are likely the cause (or one of the causes) of deep trap appearance in experiments on metal phthalocyanine crystals.34–36

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have used extensive density-functional theory calculations to address the role of prototype impurities in the degradation of metal phthalocyanines. We have found that pyridinic N atoms of zinc phthalocyanine and copper phthalocyanine molecules are the preferred sites of adsorption for hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Moreover, the results have shown that hydrogen adatoms and oxygen molecules within zinc and copper phthalocyanine crystals introduce complex changes in the electronic properties of the host system. Most notably, these impurities create energy levels deep within the band gap of the crystal and can thus act, depending on operating conditions, as carrier traps in ZnPc and CuPc-based photovoltaic and electronic systems. Finally, certain hydrogen and oxygen-related impurity configurations modify the magnetic state of the host molecule, by either introducing spin-polarization in the non-magnetic ZnPc species, or by changing the magnetic moment of CuPc entities.
