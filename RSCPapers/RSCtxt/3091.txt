    , Accepted 30th May 2018First published on 1st June 2018AbstractAlthough the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors have been increasing rapidly over the last couple of years, little is known about the correlations between molecular structures and blend morphologies. In this work, we design and synthesize three acceptor–donor–core–donor–acceptor (A–D–C–D–A) type non-fullerene acceptors, HF–PCIC, HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC, which possess the same electron-donating parts (D) and electron-accepting terminals (A), but different benzene-based cores (C). We observe that such minor chemical variations can lead to distinct differences in their photovoltaic properties. The resulting PSCs based on HF–PCIC with a 2,5-difluorobenzene core yield a good PCE of 10.97%, which is higher than those of HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC based PSCs (8.36% and 9.09%). If the processing solvent is changed from chlorobenzene to chloroform, a further improved PCE of 11.49% is obtained for HF–PCIC-based PSCs due to the formation of finer phase separation domains. This is the highest value among the PSCs with non-fullerene acceptors possessing unfused cores. Through a series of characterization techniques, we disclose that the diverse benzene-based cores influence the molecular geometries of the three non-fullerene acceptors, resulting in varied molecular packing modes and film morphologies. The results suggest that the tuning of non-fullerene acceptors' geometries is an effective method to optimize the film morphology and thus the photovoltaic properties. The unfused-core in A–D–C–D–A small molecules provides a good building block to construct high-performance non-fullerene acceptors.
1. Introduction
Aiming at developing the next generation of photovoltaic technology with the features of light weight, mechanical flexibility and low-cost production, much effort has been devoted to material design and device engineering to boost the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells.1–10 Benefitting from the advantages of strong absorption and highly tunable energy levels, non-fullerene acceptors could deliver a higher PCE compared to their fullerene counterparts.11–22 At present, record PCEs over 13% are achieved in polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on a polymer donor and a small-molecule non-fullerene acceptor.23–26 Among the factors that affect the PCEs, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology of the donor and acceptor blend should be the one of the primary issues.27–29 The preferred BHJ morphology for high-performance PSCs should have bicontinuous interpenetrating networks with nanoscaled phase separation,30 which could not only maintain efficient charge transport, but also ensure efficient exciton dissociation. These BHJ morphology prerequisites could be determined by the molecular optimization of donor and acceptor materials.31
In this regard, understanding the relationships between the molecular structures of non-fullerene acceptors and their blend morphology, as well as photovoltaic performances is highly necessary, so as to find out the guidance for the future molecular design of acceptors with a better morphology and performances.32–35 At present, the molecular optimization of non-fullerene acceptors mainly focuses on the tuning of energy levels and absorption,36–39 and less attention has been paid to the molecular packing effects on the blend morphology and device performances.40 Recently, we reported a new type of unfused-core-based non-fullerene acceptor with the structure of acceptor–donor–core–donor–acceptor (A–D–C–D–A).41 After optimization, a PCE as high as 10.14% can also be achieved for this type of acceptor. The introduced core can provide flexibility in chemical modification and the D–C–D part can be obtained via facile Stille coupling reactions. Therefore, the A–D–C–D–A type non-fullerene acceptors can be a good option to examine the structure–performance relationships by modifying the core or A terminals.
Besides molecular structure optimization, the thin film processing conditions are also important for the formation of a desired BHJ morphology. Thermal annealing,42 adding additives,43,44 and choosing suitable processing solvents25 are the common methods to optimize the film morphology. The change of processing solvents would affect the time scale of film-forming and the molecular packing behaviours, thus influencing the morphology and the performances. The common solvents for device fabrication are chlorobenzene and chloroform, and the comparison of these two solvents in non-fullerene PSCs is also worth studying.45,46
In this article, we introduce three different benzene-based cores to connect cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) units, as well as fluorine atoms on the terminals using the accepting unit of 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2F),47 which enhance intermolecular interactions and increase electron mobilities through F⋯H, F⋯S or F⋯π noncovalent interactions,48–50 resulting in three different non-fullerene acceptors of HF–PCIC, HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC (Fig. 1). The change of substituents (H, O, and F) on the cores systematically modifies their basic properties, including absorption spectra, energy levels and geometries. A fluorinated polymer, PBDB–TF (Fig. 1), is used as the donor to pair with these acceptors to make solar cells.51 After optimization, PCEs of 10.98%, 8.36% and 9.09% are obtained for HF–PCIC-based, HFO–PCIC-based and OF–PCIC-based PSCs using chlorobenzene as the processing solvent. The PSCs based on PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC blends are further optimized using chloroform as the processing solvent and a higher PCE of 11.49% is achieved. A relationship between the molecular structures and the device performances is established, which helps guide the future molecular design for non-fullerene acceptors with better photovoltaic performances.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of HF–PCIC, HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC compounds are displayed in Scheme 1. HF–PCIC is obtained through Knoevenagel condensation between compound 1 and IC-2F, while compound 1 is synthesized according to our previously reported work.41 The synthesis of HFO–PCIC requires four steps, involving the bromination of compound 2, Stille coupling between compounds 3 and 4, lithiation of compound 5 with n-butyllithium and quenching with dimethylformamide (DMF), and Knoevenagel condensation of compound 6 with IC-2F. OF–PCIC is obtained in a similar way to HFO–PCIC. All these non-fullerene acceptors are fully characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 19F NMR and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry. These three compounds have good solubility in common solvents, like dichloromethane, chloroform and chlorobenzene. More information about the synthetic details can be found in the ESI.†

To examine the thermal properties of these three non-fullerene acceptors, we perform thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Fig. S1†). We found that the three compounds show good thermal stability with the decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 341 °C, 347 °C and 348 °C for HF–PCIC, HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC, respectively. From DSC curves, one melting peak and one crystallization peak are observed for all three compounds, indicating good crystalline properties. Among them, HF–PCIC shows the highest melting temperature (Tm) of 294 °C and the lowest crystallization temperature (Tc) of 199 °C, while HFO–PCIC shows the lowest Tm of 277 °C and the highest Tc of 218 °C. As for OF–PCIC, Tm and Tc are found to be 282 °C and 212 °C, respectively.
The absorption of these three molecules is measured and compared both in chloroform solutions and thin films (Fig. 2). As expected, OF–PCIC shows the most blue-shifted absorption with the highest peak centered at 660 nm in chloroform solution, relative to those centered at 682 nm and 686 nm for HF–PCIC and HFO–PCIC, respectively. This result is caused by the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. The extra two fluorine atoms on OF–PCIC will weaken the ICT effect from the electron-donating part to the electron-withdrawing part, while the extra oxygen atoms on HFO–PCIC will strengthen the ICT effect. Meanwhile, we can also see that the impact of fluorine atoms on the ICT effect is larger than that of oxygen atoms. As for extinction coefficients, HF–PCIC shows the highest value of 2.03 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at the highest peak, while HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC possess similar values of 1.91 × 105 and 1.90 × 105 M−1 cm−1. Therefore, HF–PCIC can absorb more photons, which is beneficial for achieving a higher short-circuit current (Jsc) in PSCs. After being converted into solid films, the absorptions of these three molecules become broader and red-shifted, indicating effective packing behaviours in the films. The relative relationships among the film absorptions are similar to those in the solutions. Another similar property observed in the film absorptions is that nearly equal intensities of 0–0 and 0–1 peaks are presented, which means that H-aggregation (face-to-face arrangement) may also be as abundant as J-aggregation (end-to-end arrangement).52–54 Through the film absorption edges, the optical bandgaps are calculated to be 1.50 eV, 1.48 eV and 1.59 eV for HF–PCIC, HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC. Relevant data are also summarized in Table 1.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements are applied to check the energy levels of these three molecules (Fig. S2†). As listed in Table 1, HFO–PCIC shows the highest-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of −3.81 eV and −5.50 eV, and OF–PCIC shows the lowest-lying LUMO and HOMO levels of −3.86 eV and −5.66 eV, while HF–PCIC possesses the in-between LUMO and HOMO levels of −3.83 eV and −5.53 eV. The variation in the energy levels among these three molecules also conforms to the conventional rule, namely introducing electron-donating (oxygen atoms, here) moieties will lift the energy levels and introducing electron-withdrawing (fluorine atoms, here) moieties will pull down the energy levels. However, it should be noted that HOMO levels vary greater than LUMO levels, since the benzene-based cores in the center belong to the electron-donating parts and the HOMO levels are mainly influenced by the electron-donating parts in the molecules. Therefore, by changing the substituents on the center cores, absorptions and energy levels can be easily modified for A–D–C–D–A type non-fullerene acceptors, which provides more imaginary space in designing various high-performance acceptors.
2.2. Geometry analysis by DFT calculations and single crystal X-ray diffraction study
To explore how the atom changing on the benzene-based core affects the molecular configurations, we firstly perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the results are presented in Fig. 3 (as well as in Fig. S3–S5†). Overall, three different geometries are obtained for these three molecules. To explain them more clearly, we call the fused part of CPDT and IC-2F moieties “the wing”. For HF–PCIC, two wings reversely rotate around the benzene-based core, resulting in a dihedral angle of 14.20° between the wing and the benzene-based core. For HFO–PCIC, two wings keep still at the same level, while the benzene-based core rotates along one direction, leading to a dihedral angle of 12.36° between the wing and the benzene-based core. As for OF–PCIC, the whole backbone is locked as a planar structure with a negligible dihedral angle of 0.05° between the wing and the benzene-based core. Such small changes on the molecules lead to totally different geometries, which may influence the device performances. Besides, in our previous work, we observe that a hydrogen bond exists between the 2,5-difluorobenzene and CPDT units, and thus a trans structure with the F⋯H noncovalent interaction is preferred.41,55 For the combination of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene and CPDT units, it's also reported that a trans structure will be more feasible,56 whereas, for the combination of 2,5-difluoro-3,6-dimethoxybenzene and CPDT units, the situation is more complex since both fluorine and oxygen atoms can form hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen atoms. To confirm the real configuration, we cultivate a single crystal of a model compound, 2,2′-(2,5-difluoro-3,6-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene)dithiophene (FPT-O) and perform a single crystal X-ray diffraction study. The results are also displayed in Fig. 3. It turns out that fluorine atoms choose to approach the hydrogen atoms while oxygen atoms choose to approach the sulfur atoms, and thus a trans structure with the F⋯H noncovalent interaction becomes the chosen one. Similar to the result from DFT calculation, in the model compound FPT-O, two thiophene rings keep still at the same level while the benzene-based core rotates along one direction, but the dihedral angle is larger with the value of 32.51°. Anyway, for these three molecules, trans structures with the F⋯H noncovalent interaction are all the preferred choices, but different rotation configurations are presented. Of course, cis structures may also exist simultaneously for HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC due to the existence of four noncovalent interactions between the benzene-based cores and CPDT units. This coexistence of cis and trans structures may influence the molecular packing ordering, and thus the device performances.

2.3. Photovoltaic properties
Since fluorine atoms are also introduced at the ends of these three molecules, lowered LUMO levels are obtained. To achieve a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), a donor possessing a deep HOMO should be chosen. Here, we use a polymer donor named PBDB–TF, which is also fluorinated on the side-chain thiophene and possesses a deep HOMO of −5.48 eV. The basic properties of PBDB–TF, including absorption and energy levels, can be found in Fig. S6 and S7.† The absorption of PBDB–TF is mainly located in the range of 500–700 nm, which is complementary to those of our designed non-fullerene acceptors. Thus, a high Jsc can be expected. We fabricate devices with the inverted structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. After proper optimization with chlorobenzene (CB) as the solvent (Table S1†), the optimized conditions are found to be a donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio of 1:1.2 with the addition of 1.0% (v/v) 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 min for PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC-based PSCs. The devices based on PBDB–TF:HFO–PCIC and PBDB–TF:OF–PCIC blends are also fabricated under the same conditions as above. The J–V curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are displayed in Fig. 4, and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.

Firstly, high Voc values are measured to be 0.92 V, 0.93 V and 0.91 V for HF–PCIC-based, HFO–PCIC-based and OF–PCIC-based PSCs, respectively, which are in accordance with the relative relationships of LUMO levels of non-fullerene acceptors. Secondly, high fill factor (FF) values are found to be 72.42%, 70.99% and 73.37% for HF–PCIC-based, HFO–PCIC-based and OF–PCIC-based PSCs, respectively. Obviously, both high Voc and FF are achieved for these three non-fullerene acceptors and no big differences are observed among the Voc and FF. However, in Jsc, big differences appear. HF–PCIC-based PSCs show the highest Jsc of 16.01 mA cm−2, and HFO–PCIC-based PSCs show the lowest Jsc of 12.62 mA cm−2, while OF–PCIC-based PSCs show an in-between Jsc of 13.76 mA cm−2. Therefore, the PCE is as high as 10.97% for HF–PCIC-based PSCs, but only 8.36% and 9.09% for HFO–PCIC-based and OF–PCIC-based PSCs. As for the EQE spectra, the photoresponse ranges are consistent with the absorption ranges of the blends (Fig. S8†), and the photoresponse intensities are also in accordance with the relative relationships of Jsc values.
We further optimize the PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC-based PSCs by changing the processing solvent from chlorobenzene (CB) to chloroform (CF) and 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) is used as the additive instead of CN. The thermal annealing temperature is modulated to 100 °C for 10 min. The other conditions are the same as above. An improved PCE of 11.49% is obtained with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 17.81 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.77%. Notably, such a high efficiency is achieved with small driving forces (ΔLUMO = 0.19 eV and ΔHOMO = 0.05 eV). To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency is the highest value for unfused-core-based non-fullerene acceptors. Obviously, the improvement of PCE is mainly benefitted from the increase of Jsc. And we can also observe from EQE spectra (Fig. 4f) that photoresponse intensity is enhanced nearly in the whole range of 300–800 nm, which means that both photocurrents from the donor and acceptor are enhanced. This EQE enhancement is reasonable because PBDB–TF shows strong aggregation behavior in the CB solution but better solubility and dispersity in the CF solution.57 Thus, the change of the processing solvent from CB to CF can obtain an optimized morphology for the active layer, including much finer domain sizes, higher crystallinity, and improved charge transport properties,25,58,59 which are proved by the enhanced absorptions of the D:A blend (Fig. S9†) and the characterizations as follows. The results reveal that HF–PCIC is the best choice among these three non-fullerene acceptors and the processing solvent will also have an impact on the performances of PSCs.
2.4. Mobility analysis
The space charge limited current (SCLC) method is used to examine the charge carrier mobilities (Fig. S10 and S11†) and the relevant results are summarized in Table S2.† The structure of hole-only and electron-only devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN–Br/Al, wherein PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). For pure acceptors, all three molecules exhibit high electron mobilities (μe) (6.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for HF–PCIC, 5.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for HFO–PCIC, and 5.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for OF–PCIC). But the mobilities of blends vary largely. The PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC blend shows the highest and most balanced hole/electron mobilities (hole mobility (μh) = 1.68 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 1.35 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μh/μe = 1.24). The PBDB–TF:OF–PCIC blend possesses higher hole/electron mobilities (μh = 1.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 0.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μh/μe = 4.03) than the PBDB–TF:HFO–PCIC blend (μh = 0.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 0.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μh/μe = 3.44). By using CF as the processing solvent, both hole and electron mobilities of the PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC blend can be enhanced (μh = 3.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 1.67 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μh/μe = 1.96). Higher mobilities are beneficial for achieving higher Jsc and the measured mobilities show similar variation rules to the measured Jsc in PSCs.
2.5. Morphology characterization
The morphologies of pure materials and blended films are firstly examined by grazing-incidence wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS/GISAXS) characterization.60,61Fig. 5 shows the 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) intensity profiles. The neat PBDB–TF film shows a strong (100) lamellar peak at 0.315 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a relatively weaker lamellar peak at 0.290 Å−1 in the IP direction. Obviously, PBDB–TF is a highly crystalline polymer with a preferential edge-on orientation. For neat non-fullerene acceptor films, both HF–PCIC and OF–PCIC show a lamellar diffraction peak at 0.490 Å−1 and a (010) π–π stacking peak at 1.73 Å−1 (d = 3.63 Å) in the OOP direction. However, for HFO–PCIC, the lamellar peak appears at 0.490 Å−1 (d = 12.8 Å) in the IP direction and at 0.650 Å−1 (d = 9.66 Å) in the OOP direction, indicating a much tighter lamellar stacking in the OOP direction, which might be beneficial for the electron transport. Besides, another strong π–π stacking diffraction peak at 1.69 Å−1 (d = 3.72 Å) in the OOP direction is presented for HFO–PCIC, demonstrating good crystallinity and strong face-on ordering. All the blended films with CB exhibit strong scattering peaks originated from PBDB–TF but much weaker scattering of acceptors except for those of HFO–PCIC, consistent with its higher crystallinity. However, PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC with CF also exhibits strong lamellar peaks, suggesting that CF could enhance the crystallinity of the film. 2D GISAXS patterns and the corresponding IP intensity profiles are shown in Fig. 6 to estimate the sizes of the acceptor phases. Here, the scattering contribution from the pure acceptor phase is fitted by the fractal-like network model. The Debye–Anderson–Brumberger (DAB) model is used to account for the scattering due to the amorphous intermixing region. The intermixing region of PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC, PBDB–TF:OF–PCIC and PBDB–TF:HFO–PCIC is 46.6 nm, 52.8 nm, and 52.9 nm respectively, while their pure acceptor phases Rg (the radius of gyration) are 44.9 nm, 39.5 nm and 43.8 nm. Despite the similar intermixing size (47.0 nm), PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC (CF) has much smaller acceptor phases (Rg = 29.6 nm), leading to more efficient exciton dissociation and therefore the highest Jsc among all the devices.

The thin film morphology is also studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the results are presented in Fig. S12.† The different rotation configurations of these three molecules lead to totally different aggregation behaviours. The HFO–PCIC-based blend shows severe aggregation with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 5.372 nm, while HF–PCIC-based and OF–PCIC-based blends show more smooth and homogeneous surfaces with a RMS roughness of 2.951 nm and 1.780 nm, respectively. For the CF processed film, a more uniform surface is obtained and the RMS roughness is also reduced to 1.977 nm, when compared with the CB processed film. The optimized morphology should be responsible for the improvement in Jsc, and thus a higher PCE for PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC (CF)-based PSCs.
2.6. Structure–performance relationship analysis
Overall, the divergent PCEs of PSCs based on the three acceptors are mainly originated from the different Jscs. The above GIWAXS, GISAXS and AFM results suggest that the morphology could be responsible for the huge differences in Jscs in our case. The change of substituents on the benzene-based cores leads to different rotation geometries (see Fig. 3) and then different molecular packing modes, and thus different domain sizes and morphologies are formed. GIWAXS and AFM indicate that HFO–PCIC is the easiest one to aggregate, while HF–PCIC and OF–PCIC take the second and third places. For non-fullerene acceptors with strong accepting terminals at the ends, an end-to-end arrangement (J-aggregation) is more efficient to transport electrons than a face-to-face arrangement (H-aggregation). In our case, the face-to-face arrangement is also abundant (see Fig. 2b), and thus face-to-face molecular packing could be one of the main limits that influence the device performances.
Among these three non-fullerene acceptors, HFO–PCIC is the easiest one to form a face-to-face arrangement, due to the existence of strong noncovalent interactions between the benzene-based cores of two HFO–PCIC molecules. Such noncovalent interactions can be proved from the molecular packing of the model compound FPT-O extracted from single crystal data (Fig. S13†) as well as the 1H NMR and 19F NMR spectra of HFO–PCIC at different temperatures (Fig. S14 and S15†). In the absorptions of A–D–A type acceptor thin films, the 0–0 peak stands for the end-to-end arrangement, while the 0–1 peak stands for the face-to-face arrangement. To further check the face-to-face arrangement tendency, we compare the absorptions of the annealed films (Fig. S16†) with those of the as-cast ones (Fig. 2b). It's found that the HFO–PCIC film shows an obvious blue-shift behavior, especially for the 0–1 peak, indicating that the face-to-face arrangement is increasing and the end-to-end arrangement is decreasing. Such a blue-shift phenomenon is also observed in the EQE curve of PBDB–TF:HFO–PCIC-based PSCs (Fig. 4d). Therefore, the lowest electron mobility is observed in the PBDB–TF:HFO–PCIC blend (see Fig. S11 and Table S2†), since electrons are transported via π–π stacking of the electron-accepting end-groups (end-to-end arrangement).40 Besides, the face-to-face molecular packing of HFO–PCIC also induces both large pure acceptor phase and large intermixing sizes (see Fig. 6), which is not beneficial for exciton dissociation and will cause severe charge recombination. This may lead to the lowest Jsc, and thus the lowest PCE for PBDB–TF:HFO–PCIC-based PSCs. As for OF–PCIC, face-to-face molecular packing is not as severe as that of HFO–PCIC, and therefore smaller pure acceptor phase size and higher electron mobility are observed in the PBDB–TF:OF–PCIC blend than the PBDB–TF:HFO–PCIC blend. However, the larger packing space (see the lamellar diffraction peak at 0.490 Å−1 in Fig. 5i) than that of HFO–PCIC existing between two OF–PCIC acceptors will allow polymer chains to intermix and the small alkyl chains on OF–PCIC are not strong enough to reject the polymer chains, and thus a large intermixing size is formed for the PBDB–TF:OF–PCIC blend. This will strengthen charge recombination and lead to unbalanced hole/electron mobilities. Therefore, PBDB–TF:OF–PCIC-based PSCs show in-between Jsc and PCE. As for HF–PCIC, the twisted wings not only maintain efficient molecular contact for charge transport, but also restrain the over intermixing with polymer chains, and thus the highest electron mobility and the smallest intermixing size are observed in the PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC blend. Therefore, PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC-based PSCs exhibit the highest Jsc and PCE. These results can also enlighten us that strengthening the end-to-end arrangement by modifying the end groups could be promising to further improve the performances of A–D–C–D–A type non-fullerene acceptors and overly strong face-to-face molecular packing should be avoided if modifying the cores of non-fullerene acceptors. Besides, these three non-fullerene acceptors have big differences in crystallinity which are indicated by GIWAXS. HFO–PCIC possesses really high crystallinity, while OF–PCIC and HF–PCIC possess moderate crystallinity. As a highly crystalline material, HFO–PCIC may compete with the polymer donor PBDB–TF in the blend and disturb the interpenetrating networks constructed from PBDB–TF, and thus the worst performances are presented for the PBDB–TF:HFO–PCIC blend among these three different blends. Therefore, the crystallinity matching of the donor and acceptor is also important and mixing two materials both with high crystallinity may not be a preferred choice.62
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we present herein a systematic study on A–D–C–D–A type non-fullerene acceptors with tunable properties via the change of substituents on the unfused benzene-based cores. Through employing a fluorinated polymer, PBDB–TF, as the donor to pair with the three new fluorinated acceptors, respectively, various PCEs of 10.97%, 8.36% and 9.09% are achieved for HF–PCIC-based, HFO–PCIC-based and OF–PCIC-based PSCs, respectively. A higher PCE of 11.49% can be obtained for PBDB–TF:HF–PCIC-based PSCs by changing the processing solvent from chlorobenzene to chloroform. The modification of the benzene-based cores of the three non-fullerene acceptors leads to three different geometries, thus influencing the ratios of face-to-face and end-to-end arrangements. Consequently, the distinctions in molecular packing largely affect the domain sizes and charge transport properties, and thus the photovoltaic performances. HF–PCIC with two noncovalent interactions in the benzene-based core and a little twisted geometry shows better performances than those (HFO–PCIC and OF–PCIC) with four noncovalent interactions in the benzene-based cores. These results indicate that the tuning of molecular packing is an effective strategy to improve the device performance. Our work helps understand the relationships between the molecular structures and the blend morphology and guide the future molecular design for non-fullerene acceptors with better photovoltaic performances.
