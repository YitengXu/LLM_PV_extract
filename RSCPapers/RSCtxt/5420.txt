    , Accepted 23rd February 2022First published on 24th February 2022AbstractWe investigated the electron transfer processes in methylene blue-CdTe and methylene blue-CdTe/CdSe complexes by steady state and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy by selective excitation of the quantum dot (QD) moiety. The ultrafast electron transfer is accelerated by the shell growth due to the separation of the charge carriers and the resulting increase of electron density in the shell. Transmission electron microscope images show that the successive addition of shell material deforms the spherical QDs until they adopt a tetrapodal shape. The increased donor–acceptor distance in the tetrapodal CdTe/CdSe QDs leads to a slower electron transfer. Photon flux dependent transient absorption measurements indicate the separation of two electrons for the QDs with a thin shell and thus demonstrate that charge carrier multiplication can be directly utilized for increased charge transfer in this type of QD hybrid system.
Introduction
The utilization of renewable energy sources is becoming increasingly relevant given the recent acceleration of global climate changes. Amongst those energy sources, solar energy is considered to have the greatest potential.1 However, the photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies of a single junction solar cell is restricted by the Shockley–Queisser limit to ∼31%.2 This limit is set by the large loss of energy conversion caused by inefficient utilization of low- (hν < band gap energy (Eg)) and high-energy photons (hν > Eg).3 The low-energy photons cannot be absorbed and therefore cannot be converted. The latter generate hot charge carriers, which cool down before they can be extracted for further processes and thus the excess energy is dissipated as heat through electron–photon scattering and subsequent phonon emission resulting from carrier relaxation to the conduction band edges.4 For this reason, carrier multiplication (CM) has been intensively studied as a promising direction to enhance solar energy conversion.5–7 CM is a process where more than one electron–hole pair can be generated upon optical excitation with a high-energy photon. This results in utilization of the excess photon energy and leads to an increase in the thermodynamically allowed power conversion efficiencies.8 Such an increase to 44% efficiency has been reported.9
The CM phenomenon has already been intensively studied for bulk semiconductors.10–12 However, the efficiency enhancement did not result into a significant improvement of the energy conversion and occurs at a high threshold photon energy.8,13 Nevertheless, it was suggested that an enhanced CM could occur in quantum dots (QDs) due to the quantum confinement effect which slows the cooling of hot excitons and lowers the energy threshold for this process.4,14 While CM is otherwise known as impact ionization for bulk semiconductors,15 it is referred to as multiple exciton generation (MEG) for QDs.16,17 MEG has been reported for various QDs such as CdSe,18,19 CdTe,20 CdHgTe21 and CdTe/CdSe22 core/shell QDs. However, the energy utilization of multiexcitons proves to be challenging, due to their very short lifetime caused by the Auger recombination occurring in multiexcited QDs. Auger recombination is a non-radiative process in which the energy released during electron and hole recombination is transferred to a third charge carrier (either electron or hole) which is then excited to a higher energy state.23–25
Alternatively, it has been shown that multiple electrons can be transferred from photoexcited QDs to different molecular acceptors, e.g. methylene blue (MB).26–28 To occur efficiently, this charge separation must be able to compete with the Auger recombination.16 Recently, we showed that a thin shell of CdSe can accelerate the electron transfer (ET) from CdTe/CdSe to MB, at a rate fast enough to potentially compete with Auger recombination.29
In this report, we study the ET from CdTe and various CdTe/CdSe QDs to MB via steady state and transient absorption (TA) measurements. We observed that the higher electron probability density in the shell leads to an improved ET. However, a decelerated ET was detected for a high shell thickness, where the morphology of the nanostructures changed from a previously round to a tetrapodal shape detected in TEM images. The calculations show the confinement of the electron wave function to the arms. Importantly, photon flux dependent TA measurements demonstrated that the accelerated ET leads to two separated electrons instead of just one.
Experimental
Materials
Oleic acid (OA; tech. 90%), 1-octadecene (ODE; tech. 90%), trioctylphosphine (TOP; tech. 90%), tellurium (99.8%), cadmium oxide (99.5%), selenium (100 mesh, 99.99%), acetone (99%), toluene (99.95%) and ethanol (99.8%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. 1-Tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA; 98%) were purchased from Carl Roth. Methanol (100%) was obtained from Acros Organics.
Synthesis of CdTe cores
The QDs were prepared using the synthesis protocol described by Dworak et al.29 with the exception that the injection temperature was set to 290 °C.
Synthesis of CdTe/CdSe core/shell QDs
The CdTe/CdSe QDs were prepared using a one-stage approach.29 In this synthesis, the shell-precursors are added directly to the solution without further purification of the core. The core and shell growth are separated by a significant temperature drop.30 However, a certain amount of interfacial alloying cannot be excluded. The CdTe diameter was determined using the empiric formula of Yu et al.31 and then used for the calculation of the required amount of shell-precursors for a certain number of monolayers (MLs).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
For TEM imaging, copper grids with continuous carbon films of 10 mm thickness (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield Pennsylvania, PA, USA) were glow-discharged and the QDs were adsorbed to the grid at room temperature for 1 min. The transmission images were collected with a Tecnai F30 G2 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Falcon 3EC camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated in linear mode at a nominal magnification of 200k×. The images were subsequently binned to 2k, at a pixel size of 0.57 Å. The total electron dose per image was 372710 e− nm−2.
Preparation of MB-QD complexes
The complexes were prepared from stock solutions of MB (2.0 × 10−3 M in methanol), CdTe (3.1 × 10−5 M in toluene), 1 ML (2.6 × 10−5 M in toluene), 2 ML (1.9 × 10−5 M in toluene) and 3 ML (1.7 × 10−5 M in toluene). The concentration of the QDs was calculated with the extinction coefficients estimated from the empirical formula of Yu et al.31 (CdTe: ε515 = 92200 M−1 cm−1, 1 ML: ε560 = 130000 M−1 cm−1, 2 ML: ε607 = 163000 M−1 cm−1, 3 ML: ε640 = 203000 M−1 cm−1). However, it must be noted here, that the size-dependent extinction coefficient for CdTe/CdSe is unknown as the formula is only valid for CdTe. Nevertheless, the calculated values provide a good approximation, since the lowest excitonic peak of CdTe is well preserved for all heterostructures.
For the preparation of the MB-QD complexes specific volumes of the MB stock solution were evaporated. The resulting solid was mixed with 300 μL of the respective QD solution for 1 h in an ultrasonic bath and stored in the fridge afterwards. The final MB to QD ratios of the different complexes were calculated (extinction coefficient of MB on QD surface:29ε668 = 36600 M−1 cm−1) from the absorption spectra of the QD and the complex samples 2.1:1 (CdTe), 2.3:1 (1 ML), 2.4:1 (2 ML), 2.4:1 (3 ML). Consequently, it is assumed that on average 2.1–2.4 MB molecules are electrostatically bound to one QD. It is known that electron and energy transfer times are accelerated with increasing acceptor concentration29,32–34 but due to the similarity of these ratios, we assume that the small concentration differences only play a minor role for the modulation of the electron transfer rates.
Steady-state spectroscopy
Absorption spectra were recorded in quartz cuvettes of 1 cm optical path length with an S100 spectrometer (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany).
Photoluminescence (PL) was measured in 4 × 10 mm quartz cuvettes with a FP-8500 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Groß-Umstadt, Germany). The baseline and the wavelength-dependent instrument sensitivity were corrected routinely. Bandwidths of 5 nm for excitation and emission were adjusted and the PMT voltage was set to 370 V. The excitation wavelength was set to 388 nm.
Time-resolved spectroscopy
UV/vis-pump–probe spectroscopy to obtain transient absorption signals was performed using a home-built setup.35 A laser-amplifier system (Clark, MXR-CPA iSeries) provides femtosecond pulses (150 fs) with a laser fundamental wavelength of 775 nm. The laser system operates at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. The pump pulses (with a diameter of 165 μm) are generated by frequency doubling (388 nm) of the laser fundamental. The white light continuum (425–700 nm) probe pulses are generated by focusing the laser fundamental into a CaF2 crystal of 5 mm thickness. The white light is detected in reference mode by two spectrometers (AMKO Multimode). All shown experiments were performed under magic angle conditions (54.7° angle difference of pump–probe polarization) to eliminate anisotropic contributions. A fused silica cuvette with an optical path length of 1 mm was used. The samples were moved continuously to prevent photodegradation.
Transient absorption data analysis
The transient absorption data were analyzed via global lifetime analysis (GLA) with the OPTIMUS program.36 In GLA all transients are simultaneously analyzed with a single set of exponential functions. The results from GLA are presented as decay-associated spectra (DAS). In DAS, positive amplitudes result from either the decay of a positive or the rise of a negative absorption change, while negative amplitudes describe the decay of a negative or the rise of a positive absorption change.
Results and discussion
Morphology
Different core–shell particles were produced, where the amount of the shell precursor leads to the equivalent formation of 1, 2, and 2.86 monolayers (ML). In the following, these QDs are referred to as 1 ML, 2 ML, and 3 ML, respectively.
The collected TEM images (Fig. 1) show that the morphology of the QDs changes with the increased addition of shell material. The spherical CdTe cores (2.6 nm, Fig. S1†) retain a round shape when a thin layer (0.4 nm) of CdSe is added (1 ML, Fig. S1†), but with increasing amounts of shell material the morphology changes until the particles adopt a tetrapodal shape (3 ML).

Steady state measurements

Quantum dots. 
The steady state studies show a large redshift of the absorption and the photoluminescence maxima with the increasing number of ML (Fig. 2a and Table 1). This result is in agreement with the data for type II or quasi-type II CdTe/CdSe QDs, where a similar shell thickness dependent spectral shift was observed.37 For these types, the core–shell system consists of a shell material whose conduction (CB) and valence band (VB) are both energetically lower than the respective bands of the core. Thus, the electron can pass from the core to the shell. As a result, the hole and the electron are spatially separated from each other.

However, since the energy difference between the CBs is too small in quasi-type II QDs, the electron cannot be enclosed in the shell. Due to the small energy difference the wave function of the electron is delocalized over the whole structure, whereas the wave function of the hole is confined to the core (Fig. 2b). The lowest excitonic absorption involves the hole from the core VB and the electron contribution from the shell CB. The reduced energy gap results in the observed red shift of the absorption.
All QDs show a relatively clear absorption peak for the lowest excitonic transition at long wavelengths. Normally, for the transition to type II QDs the absorption typically broadens and is featureless.37,38 Even though this is not the case for 3 ML, the calculated electron wave function (Fig. S2†) using the split operator method39 shows the confinement of the electron in the CdSe arms. Therefore, we classify all core–shell QDs except for 3 ML in the quasi-type II category. Due to the spatial separation of hole and electron 3 ML can be assigned as type II.
For pure CdTe, the sharp absorption peak at 515 nm (Fig. 1) can be assigned to the lowest excitonic transition 1S(e)–1S3/2(h), for CdTe/CdSe it also corresponds to the lowest CdTe transition.40 Since the electron is delocalized over the whole structure, in CdTe/CdSe the band is termed as a 1S(e)hetero–1S3/2(h) transition (absorption maxima in Table 1).41 This transition shifts with increasing shell thickness. The small half width at half maximum (hwhm) (∼18 nm) for all samples speaks for a narrow distribution suggesting homogenous growth of the QDs.
The absorption spectra show another distinct band in the shorter wavelength range for the core/shell particles (1 ML: ∼510 nm, 2 ML: ∼550 nm, 3 ML: ∼570 nm). This band becomes more pronounced and shifts with increasing shell amount. This effect has been observed previously and assigned to the lowest CdSe transition.40 Alternatively, the band was assigned to the transition from the 2S3/2(h) level of the CdTe core to the 1S(e)hetero level.41 Currently, we cannot make an unambiguous assignment of the absorption band. The homogenous growth of the QDs is further supported by the narrow width of the PL band. Furthermore, the absence of trap state emission suggests that the nanocrystals have few defects.42


Complexes. 
To study the ET mechanism, complexes of MB (molecular structure as well as absorbance and emission spectra are shown in Fig. S3 and S4†) and the respective QD were prepared (Fig. 3). For CdTe and 1 ML there was a clear separation between the absorption of the MB and the PL of the QDs. However, the PL shifts to longer wavelengths with shell growth, thus the overlap between the PL of the QDs and the absorption of MB increases with higher shell thickness. This implies that Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) could also occur as QDs are also known as excellent FRET-donors.43–45 In fact, our PL measurements (Fig. S5†) show that significant quenching of QD PL occurs when MB is attached. Furthermore, no MB PL was detectable, which typically suggests an ET.46 However, the binding of MB to the QD surface might result in a quenching of the MB PL. To rule this out, a control experiment was performed with CdSe/ZnS (Fig. S6†). The PL measurements confirm FRET for CdSe/ZnS. As a result, FRET can be excluded as a possible quenching mechanism for CdTe, 1 ML, 2 ML and 3 ML. This supports the assumption that only the ET contributes to the quenching of the QD PL. This was further substantiated with time resolved spectroscopy.

Transient absorption measurements

QD-to-MB electron transfer. 
The TA experiments were conducted at an excitation wavelength of 388 nm, where the absorption of MB is minimal, and thus direct excitation of MB can be neglected. We used a pump pulse energy (6 nJ per pulse) in the single-exciton regime (N0 < 0.1) to prevent multiexciton generation in the measurements.
The excitation at 388 nm leads to characteristic signals for QDs (Fig. 4, see Fig. S7† for the TA maps of the complete set of samples). The ground state bleach (GSB) signal is located at the wavelength range of the lowest exciton transition due to the state filling effect.47,48
 Fig. 4  Spectra at fixed delay times from 0.5 ps (blue) to 1 ns (red) of CdTe, 1 ML, 2 ML, 3 ML and the respective complexes. 
The short-lived positive signal which is red-shifted to the GSB is caused by the carrier-induced Stark effect.49–51 The GSB as well as the carrier-induced Stark effect are red shifted for every additional ML, in agreement with the steady-state data of the various QDs. The features in the transient maps of the QD-MB complexes are very similar to those of the pure QDs with the exception that the decay of GSB is accelerated (Fig. S8†).
The faster decay of the GSB signal indicates the absence of the electron in the 1S(e) state, which can be the result of either the relaxation to the ground state or an ET to the MB acceptor. In fact, the MB absorption spectral range (at ∼675 nm) shows the formation of a negative absorbance difference band. The single transients at 677 nm (Fig. S9,† the single transient of pure MB is depicted in Fig. S10†) show a clear formation of the MB bleach. Additionally a positive absorption change at ∼420 nm can be observed (Fig. S11†) which was assigned to the MB radical signal.27,52–54 Consequently, all investigated samples show the transfer of an electron to MB.
Four lifetime components were sufficient to fit all transient absorption datasets using global lifetime analysis (GLA) (Fig. 5). It was possible to assign the various lifetimes to the processes observed in the previously studied QDs.29 Accordingly, the different lifetimes reflect the decay of the Stark effect, electron transfer to MB, intrinsic relaxation processes and recombination.
 Fig. 5  Decay associated spectra derived from GLA of the transient absorption data of QD-MB complexes. The second lifetime (red solid line) describes the ET reaction from the QD to the MB acceptor. 
The largest DAS amplitudes are associated with the second lifetime, they describe the ET reaction from the QD to MB. Since this lifetime reports charge separation, it is of enormous relevance for the application of QDs in solar cells. The lifetimes for the ET reaction do not only differ between core and core/shell particles, but also between the core/shell particles with various shell thicknesses (CdTe: 4.9 ps, 1 ML: 2.6 ps, 2 ML: 2.4 ps, 3ML: 4.7 ps). The ET reaction between CdTe and MB can be identified as the slowest transfer process of the considered samples. By growing one or two MLs, the rate of charge separation nearly doubles. It is assumed that the coupling strength increases in the core/shell QDs. This is a result of the improved overlap of the electron wave functions of the QD and the adsorbed MB.29 Thus, the probability density of the 1S electron is increased in the CdSe shell, explaining the accelerated ET reaction. However, the growth of another ML (from 1 ML to 2 ML) does not seem to further accelerate the ET reaction significantly, as both complexes show very similar ET lifetimes. For the complex with 3 ML the ET lifetime increases considerably and is comparable to the lifetime for the pure CdTe QD. The calculated electron wave functions (Fig. S2†) show a delocalization of the electron over the entire surface of 1 ML and 2 ML. However, with 3 ML, the electron wave function is confined to the arms. For this particle, the binding location of the acceptor is far more impactful on the ET. Since the ET at 3 ML considerably slowed down, we conclude that the MB molecules did not attach to the arms but preferentially to the spherical body. As a result the donor–acceptor distance is increased and the ET decelerated. Another explanation for the reduced ET efficiency would be that the spatial separation of the charge carriers results in a decreased overlap of the electron wave function with the accepting MB orbital.
However, the 1 ML and 2 ML complexes significantly accelerate the ET reaction, even to an extent that it may efficiently compete with Auger recombination and allow for utilization of multiexcitons in QDs for solar cell applications.


Separation of multiexcitons. 
Photon flux dependent measurements at 388 nm excitation were performed to explore the possibility of multiexciton separation.26 In QDs the process of sequential multi-photon absorption can occur, which is dependent on various factors. The average number of photons absorbed per QD can be calculated using the expression:55 (1)
Here, J(0) is the photon flux at the cuvette's entrance. The exponential decrease of the photon flux within the sample is considered. OD is the optical density of the sample at the excitation wavelength, c is the concentration of the QD and L describes the optical path length of the cuvette. If the average number of photons absorbed per QD is 〈N0〉, the probability P〈N0〉(N) that N excitons are created within a QD, can be determined using the Poisson distribution:55,56 P〈N0〉(N) = 〈N0〉Nexp(−〈N0〉)/N!(2)
Recombination of multiexcitons (due to Auger recombination) occurs in sequential steps. Consequently, assuming (i) a Poisson distribution of electron–hole pairs per QD and (ii) that only Auger recombination and ET contribute to the relaxation of multiexcitons, the average number of reduced electron acceptors per QD can be calculated with the expression:26 (3)
It is assumed that the ET can start from states that have no more than nmax electron–hole pairs and only nmax electrons can be transferred, regardless of whether more electron–hole pairs are generated. In the case of nmax = 1, all excited QDs can transfer only one electron. For nmax = 2, singly excited QDs can transfer one electron and all multiexcited QDs can transfer two electrons each. Using eqn (3), the theoretical curves were calculated for the signals of MB, at nmax = 1 and 2. Since the signal from the MB radical itself overlaps strongly with the QD signals (Fig. S9†), the mean values of the amplitudes were obtained from the data of the single transients of the MB bleach (677 nm for CdTe, 1 ML, 2 ML and 691 nm for 3 ML, Fig. S12 and S13†) between 10 and 12 ps delay time, as the ET should already have occured then. Subsequently, the TA signals of the lowest 〈N0〉 for each sample were set to one. In order to ensure comparability with the experimental data, the calculated curves (eqn (3)) were also normalized to one at the lowest 〈N0〉 for the respective sample. The size of the MB signal in dependence of the average number of absorbed photons per QD is depicted in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Comparison of the predicted dependence (lines) of the TA signal for the MB˙ radical with the data obtained from the experiments after excitation at 388 nm (pink squares). For the comparison with the experimental results all calculated curves were normalized to 1 at the lowest 〈N0〉. The solid lines indicate the curves most suited to the corresponding experimental data. 
It is noticeable that for CdTe, as well as for 3 ML the data are best approximated by the nmax = 1 curves. In contrast, the data points of 1 and 2 ML are best represented by the curves for nmax = 2. This implies that, unlike to CdTe and 3 ML, the 1 ML and 2 ML samples were able to separate two electrons. Therefore, it can be concluded that the acceleration of ET through the core/thin shell constructs have indeed enabled a kinetic bypass for the Auger recombination of biexcitons.

Conclusions
For CdTe/CdSe nanoparticles with different shell sizes we could show via steady state measurements and transient absorption measurements (λpump = 388 nm) that in donor/acceptor hybrid systems (QD/MB) a fast ET occurs for all investigated samples. The shell growth significantly influences the ET reaction, decreasing the ET time by about a factor of two for 1 ML and 2 ML compared to the pure core hybrid system. TEM images show a changed morphology for 3 ML (tetrapods) and calculations demonstrate the confinement of the electron wave function to the arms. As a result, for 3 ML the ET time becomes slower again.
To investigate the possibility of multiexciton separation for the fastest ET constructs, we performed photon flux dependent measurements. Due to the accelerated ET, it was indeed possible to separate two electrons for 1 ML and 2 ML. Therefore, we could show that in these cases the separation of the charge carriers is sufficiently fast to effectively compete with the Auger recombination. In the future, theoretical considerations57,58 will be helpful to obtain a complete description of the observed charge transfer dynamics.
Several attributes such as the very broad absorption in the visible region, the accelerated ET, and the resulting separation of more than just one charge carrier certainly qualify spherical CdTe/CdSe particles for further research efforts in solar energy conversion.
