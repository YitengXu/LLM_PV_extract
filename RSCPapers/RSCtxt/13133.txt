    , Accepted 5th September 2017First published on 5th September 2017AbstractTwo donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers with alkylthiophene as side chains, i.e., poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-(2-decyltetradecyl)thiophene-5-yl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene-5,5′′′-diyl)] (P-2T) and poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(2,5-bis(3-(2-decyltetradecyl)thiophene-5-yl)thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (P-TT), are designed and synthesized. Both polymers exhibit temperature-sensitive aggregation in solution. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on them are fabricated with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor material. The devices based on P-TT deliver power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 9.96% while no additive is used. Moreover, the photovoltaic performance of P-TT is insensitive to the polymer:PC71BM ratio and active layer thickness, and PCEs are all above 9% with the donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio of 1:1–1:1.8 (wt/wt) and film thickness of 200–360 nm. The high photovoltaic performance of P-TT is ascribed to its high and balanced charge carrier mobilities (4.51 × 10−3 and 3.44 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes and electrons, respectively), owing to the favorable face-on packing of the conjugated backbones as well as the desired morphology of the blend films. Our study demonstrates that alkylthiophenes are one kind of promising synthon of oligothiophene based D–A conjugated polymers, which can serve as side chains for tuning the aggregation of the polymer in solution and the packing mode of the conjugated backbones in the film state.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on the blend films of an electron-donor material and an electron-acceptor material, which form three-dimensional nanoscale interpenetrating networks, are promising devices for converting solar energy to electricity.1–9 Owing to the development of new donor and acceptor materials and the advances of device engineering, the performance of PSCs has been dramatically improved in the past few years. Several polymers for PSCs with power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 10% have been reported when fullerene derivatives were used as acceptor materials.10–22 However, accessible polymer donor materials with wide processing windows are still highly desirable considering future commercialization.
Of the high performance donor polymers reported to date, D–A conjugated polymers with oligothiophenes and 5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (ffBT) as building blocks are very attractive due to their structural amenability and accessibility.11,13,20,23–29 In general, this type of polymer carries bulky or branched alkyl side chains at the β-positions of thiophene rings that not only endow the polymers with good solubility but also allow controlling of the main-chain configuration in solution by temperature. For example, Yan et al. reported a 2-octyldodecyl-substituted poly(quaterthiophene-alt-difluorobenzothiadiazole) (PffBT4T-2OD) for PSCs.11 Due to its temperature-dependent aggregation properties in solution, using fullerene derivatives as the acceptor materials, blend films with high crystallinity, ideal film morphology and appropriate domain sizes were successfully prepared by optimizing the processing temperature of the active layer. Consequently, ca. 300 nm thick PSCs with PCE up to 10.8% were fabricated. Via further optimizing the side chains and processing conditions (e.g., solvents and additives), the PCE of the PSCs was enhanced to 11.7%.20
On the other hand, introducing aromatic side chains into polycyclic D-units was proved to be a practical way to tune the packing behavior of D–A conjugated polymers in the blend films. The resulting two-dimensional (2D) rigid structures encourage face-on alignment of conjugated backbones and enlarge the intermolecular overlapping of π-orbitals, which favor exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport in the PSC device geometry.30–33 For example, Hou et al. found that using alkylthiophene instead of alkyl as a substituent in the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene D-unit afforded D–A polymers with a more favorable morphology and enhanced hole mobility, and thereby a higher PCE of PSC devices was achieved.34,35 Several groups also reported polythiophenes with alkylthiophene side chains. These polymers exhibited lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels than poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and favored face-on alignment on the substrates.31,36–38 Though their PSC device performance was not superior to P3HT, these studies imply that using alkylthiophene as side chains might be a promising way to tune aggregation behavior in solution and packing structures in thin films of D–A conjugated polymers.
With this idea in mind, in the current paper, we synthesized two oligothiophene and ffBT based D–A conjugated polymers, i.e., poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-(2-decyltetradecyl)thiophene-5-yl)-2,2′; 5′,2′′; 5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene-5,5′′′-diyl)] (P-2T) and poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(2,5-bis(3-(2-decyltetradecyl)thiophene-5-yl)thiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (P-TT), as shown in Scheme 1, by using alkylthiophene instead of alkyl as the side chains. Like PffBT4T-2OD, both P-2T and P-TT displayed temperature-sensitive aggregation in solution. Conventional PSCs were fabricated with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor material, and PCEs up to 7.91% and 9.96% were achieved for P-2T and P-TT, respectively. P-TT delivered superior device performance due to the formation of blend films characterized by interpenetrating networks with appropriate domain sizes and face-on packing of P-TT conjugated backbones, which enable more effective exciton separation as well as charge transport. Besides, no additive was necessary, and the device performance of P-TT was also insensitive to the donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio and active layer thickness. When the active layer thickness was varied within 200–360 nm and the D:A ratio was altered from 1:1 to 1:1.8, the PCEs of the devices were all above 9%. High efficiency and wide processing windows qualify P-TT as a promising polymer donor material for PSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis of the polymers
The synthesis of P-2T and P-TT is depicted in Scheme 1. 2-(2-Decyltetradecyl)thiophene (2) was prepared following the procedure for the synthesis of 2-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophene as reported in the literature.31 The Stille coupling of 3-bromothiophene and tributyl(5-(2-decyltetradecyl)thiophen-2-yl) stannane (3) afforded 5-(2-decyltetradecyl)-2,3′-bithiophene (4) in a yield of 84%. Deprotonation of 4 with lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-ide followed by treatment with Bu3SnCl gave the organotin reagent 5 in high yield. Microwave-assisted Stille coupling of compound 5 and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole followed by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) gave monomer 7 in a two-step yield over 70%. The polymers P-2T and P-TT were synthesized by using typical Stille cross-coupling polycondensation. The structures of intermediates and final polymers were verified by NMR spectra (Fig. S1–S16†) and elemental analysis.
The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (Đ) of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene as the standard and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the solvent at 150 °C. As listed in Table 1, Mn and Đ values were 45.7 kDa and 2.38 for P-2T, and 58.0 kDa and 2.16 for P-TT, respectively. The two polymers showed good solubility in hot halogenated aromatic solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Both polymers exhibited good thermal stability with 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) of 423 and 417 °C, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S17†). An endothermic transition at 102 °C was found in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) second heating curves (Fig. S18†) for both polymers, with an enthalpy of 0.64 J g−1 for P-2T and 1.13 J g−1 for P-TT, which likely corresponds to the transition to a mesophase.

2.2 Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The thin film and solution UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of P-2T and P-TT are illustrated in Fig. 1, and relevant data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, two polymers showed similar film absorption spectra, with two absorption bands at 300–500 and 500–800 nm derived from π–π* and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions, respectively. Vibronic structures were also observed for the ICT band. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) calculated from the absorption onsets are 1.63 and 1.62 eV for P-2T and P-TT, respectively. Clearly, the film optical properties of P-2T and P-TT are similar to those of PffBT4T-2OD.11 This indicates that P-2T and P-TT adopted a rigid backbone configuration in films, and using alkylthiophene as the side chains did not cause noticeable twisting of the conjugated backbones in solid, although alkylthiophene moieties are more bulky than alkyl counterparts in PffBT4T-2OD. The P-TT film exhibited a slightly higher maximum absorption coefficient (∼8 × 104 cm−1) compared to the P-2T film (∼7 × 104 cm−1), which is favorable for the efficient utilization of solar energy. In solution, both polymers exhibited temperature-dependent absorption spectra (Fig. 1b and c). When the temperature was elevated from 20 to 120 °C, the absorption at 600–750 nm gradually decreased, and the absorption at ∼550 nm increased. This phenomenon is attributed to the decreased conjugation length caused by the twisting of the conjugated backbones in the disaggregation state of the polymers at high temperature. Yan et al. studied the effect of bulkiness of the alkyl chains on the aggregation properties of poly(dialkylquaterthiophene-alt-difluorobenzothiadiazole)s.11 Increasing the bulkiness of the alkyl chains by moving the branching position from the second carbon atom to the first one caused too much steric hindrance, leading to the polymer having very weak aggregation in solution and low crystallinity in films. Alkylthiophene used in the current work is more bulky than the alkyl side chains in PffBT4T-2OD. However, P-2T and P-TT still exhibited strong aggregation in solution. This may be attributed to the enlarged aromatic framework caused by using alkylthiophene side chains which enhanced intermolecular interaction, and suggests that alkylthiophenes are also the promising motifs to control the main-chain configuration in solution by temperature, similar to the bulky or branched alkyl side chains in the ffBT-based polymers reported in the literature.23–26,39–45 The disaggregation temperature, at which the absorption peaks caused by aggregation disappear, is 110 °C for P-TT, which is 30 °C higher than that of P-2T, indicating the stronger aggregation ability of P-TT. This can be ascribed to the more rigid nature of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) compared to 2,2′-bithiophene (2T). Compared to their alkyl counterparts such as PffBT4T-2OD,11P-2T and P-TT exhibited higher disaggregation temperature, implying that the introduction of the alkylthiophene side chain induces stronger aggregation for oligothiophene- and ffBT-based polymers. Thin film electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to study the electrochemical properties of P-2T and P-TT. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymers were calculated from the redox onset potentials. As shown in Fig. S19† and Table 1, compared with P-2T (HOMO = −5.27 eV and LUMO = −3.10 eV), P-TT possesses slightly deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.30 and −3.13 eV, respectively.

2.3 Photovoltaic properties
PSC devices with a configuration of ITO (indium tin oxide)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, ∼40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN, ∼5 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated and characterized. Before spin-coating, the active layer solutions and ITO substrates were preheated (for details please see the ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized PSCs based on the two polymers are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. Without any additive or post-treatment, P-TT based PSCs achieved a high PCE of 9.96% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.80 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.15 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 68.6% at the active layer thickness of 272 nm, while P-2T based PSCs showed a PCE of 7.91%, a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 17.48 mA cm−2 and a FF of 59.5% with an active layer thickness of 255 nm. The higher Voc of the P-TT based device is consistent with its lower HOMO energy level (−5.30 eV) than that (−5.27 eV) of P-2T. Moreover, as summarized in Tables 2 and S2,† the photovoltaic performance of P-TT based devices was insensitive to the polymer:PC71BM (D:A) ratio and the active layer thickness. As the D:A ratio varied from 1:1 to 1:1.8, the PCEs of the devices fluctuated in the range of 9.22–9.96% at the optimized active layer thickness (∼260 nm). When the D:A ratio was fixed at the optimized value of 1:1.2, PCEs exceeding 9% were achieved with a large range of active layer thicknesses (215–358 nm). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the best performing devices based on P-2T and P-TT are shown in Fig. 2b. For both polymers, EQEs exceeding 70% were obtained in a broad wavelength range from 430 to 720 nm. The calculated Jsc values obtained from EQE curves were 17.47 and 17.88 mA cm−2 for P-2T and P-TT based devices, respectively, which were in accordance with those extracted from J–V curves within an acceptable deviation of ∼3%. The slightly higher EQE for the P-TT based device may partly be derived from the higher film absorption coefficient, as shown in Fig. 1a. Based on the above discussion, P-TT based PSCs are characterized by high PSC efficiency and wide processing windows while no additive is required. These features are crucial for the donor materials suitable for future commercial applications.

To further investigate the photovoltaic performance of P-2T and P-TT based devices, the effective voltage (Veff) dependent photocurrent density (Jph) was measured and is displayed in Fig. 2c. With increasing Veff, the saturation photocurrent (Jsat) in the PSC based on P-TT was reached earlier than that in the PSC based on P-2T. The ratios of Jph/Jsat are 72.8% and 84.9% for P-2T and P-TT based devices, respectively, under the maximal power output conditions. These results suggest that for PSCs based on P-TT, both processes of exciton dissociation and charge collection were more efficient than those for P-2T based PSCs.46,47 The hole (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) of the blend films measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method were 1.24 × 10−3 and 2.28 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P-2T:PC71BM, and 4.51 × 10−3 and 3.44 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P-TT:PC71BM, respectively (see Fig. S22 and Table S3†). Compared with the P-2T blend (μh/μe = 0.54), the P-TT blend showed higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 1.31) and thus a much higher FF in PSCs, which is related to the film morphology and molecular packing as discussed below. As shown in Table 2, P-2T based devices exhibited a much lower PCE than P-TT based devices mainly due to the lower FF. This is different from alkyl substituted polymer counterparts as reported by Hou et al.25 They found that, when alkyls were used as side chains, the polymers based on bithiophene and thienothiophene displayed slightly different photovoltaic properties.
2.4 Film microstructures and morphology
To obtain insights into the different device performances of P-2T and P-TT, their neat and blend films were characterized by two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD), as shown in Fig. 3 and Table S4.† For the P-2T neat film, the (100) diffraction peak at qz = 2.38 nm−1 and the (010) or (020) diffraction peak at qxy = 17.62 nm−1, corresponding to d-spacings of 26.40 and 3.57 Å, respectively, were observed. The π–π stacking diffraction for conjugated polymers was generally indexed as (010). Recently, a study regarding the packing structure of quaterthiophene- and ffBT-based conjugated polymers with alkyl side chains on thiophene rings revealed that the π–π stacking diffraction could be indexed as (020) since two chains were needed to construct a unit cell.48 High order diffraction peaks up to (300) were also found along qz. This indicates that P-2T backbones adopted highly-ordered edge-on alignment on the substrate. In contrast, the P-TT neat film presented solely face-on orientation as revealed by the (100) peak and the (010) or (020) peak showing up in qxy and qz directions with d-spacings of 30.80 and 3.61 Å, respectively. Compared to P-2T, P-TT exhibited a weaker tendency to crystallize and a larger lamellar d-spacing. This can be attributed to its relatively shorter repeating unit and therefore smaller space for the interdigitation of side chains. In the P-2T:PC71BM blend film, both edge-on and face-on orientations of the conjugated backbones existed as revealed by the presence of (h00) and (010) or (020) diffraction peaks along qz and the (100) peak along qxy, which is similar to the ffBT-based polymers with the branched alkyl side chains.11,23P-TT in the blend film predominantly adopted preferred face-on orientation, which is highly desirable for photovoltaic devices. These results are consistent with the higher SCLC mobility and device performance of the P-TT:PC71BM blend film. In the blend films, both the polymers presented closer intermolecular packing as revealed by the shortened (100) and (010) or (020) d-spacings compared to those in the neat films (Table S4†), which is beneficial to the charge transport in PSCs.

The morphology of the blend films of P-2T and P-TT was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The blend films of both P-2T and P-TT were smooth and uniform (Fig. 4a and d), with a root-mean-square surface roughness of 1.82 nm for P-2T:PC71BM and 1.98 nm for P-TT:PC71BM. In AFM phase images (Fig. 4b and e), both blends showed desired nanoscale phase separation, and more obvious fibril-like structures were observed in the P-TT:PC71BM blend film. In accordance with AFM images, the TEM images of both blend films (Fig. 4c and f) exhibited continuous nanoscale networks. The light fibrils and dark regions represented polymer-rich and fullerene-rich domains, respectively.49–51 The polymer-rich fibrils in the P-2T:PC71BM blend film were ∼100 nm in length and several nanometers in width, and fullerene-rich domains were about a dozen nanometers. In the P-TT:PC71BM blend film, there existed more obvious phase separation with polymer-rich fibrils of hundreds of nanometers in length and dozens of nanometers in width close to the exciton diffusion length in organic materials. These observations are also consistent with the higher device performance of P-TT. The larger fibrils of P-TT could be attributed to its stronger aggregation ability than P-2T. The suitable aggregation and crystallization properties of P-TT may also play an important role in forming the continuous interpenetrating networks with crystalline polymer fibrils and reasonable domain sizes without any additive and post-treatment.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, two polymers based on ffBT and oligothiophenes with alkylthiophene as side chains, i.e.P-2T and P-TT, were synthesized and characterized. Both polymers exhibited similar energy levels and optical bandgaps. Using alkylthiophene as side chains allows tuning the aggregation state of the polymers in solution via temperature. P-TT exhibited stronger aggregation in solution than P-2T possibly due to the more rigid nature of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene compared to 2,2′-bithiophene. Owing to the preferable film morphology and face-on packing, which resulted in higher and more balanced charge carrier transport properties, the PSCs based on P-TT displayed device performance superior to those based on P-2T. A PCE as high as 9.96% has been demonstrated with an active layer thickness of ∼270 nm while no additive was used. The device performance of P-TT was also insensitive to the thickness and D/A ratio. PCEs were all above 9% when the active layer thickness and D/A weight ratio were varied from 200 to 360 nm and 1:1 to 1:1.8, respectively. All these qualify P-TT as a promising PSC donor polymer. Our work provided a new side chain engineering method toward high performance donor materials for PSCs.
