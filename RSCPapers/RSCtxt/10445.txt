    , Accepted 11th December 2018First published on 13th December 2018AbstractHigh quality and uniform dense perovskite films are essential to exciton dissociation and charge transportation in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although MA1−xFAxPbI3 planar films can be fabricated by a solution process with chlorobenzene anti-solvent, the fabrication still suffers from problems such as environmental pollution, high cost and low reproducibility. In this work, we present a HI and MACl assisted 2D–3D conversion mechanism (HI-MACl ACM), defined as an anti-solvent-free method, to fabricate pure phase MA1−xFAxPbI3 and enhance the quality of perovskite films. The intermediate 2D HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl derived from HI-MACl ACM eventually transforms to 3D MA1−xFAxPbI3 perovskite. This 2D structure also has an impact on retarding nucleation. The obtained films were composed of highly crystallized and large grains (over 1000 nm), which minimized grain boundaries and trap sites, giving a power conversion efficiency above 18.86% in PSCs.
Introduction
Recently, creative hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have caught researchers' eyes and emerged as promising candidates for next-generation solar cells in the photovoltaic community. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs recently has dramatically increased to over 22%.1–4
Formamidinium-based (FA-based) perovskite materials used in PSCs have many advantages, such as a broad light absorption spectra,5,6 low hysteresis and good thermal stability.4,7 Moreover, uniform and full surface covered FA-based perovskite films are of great significance in the optical absorption, charge carrier transporting and device photovoltaic performance of PSCs.8,9 During solar cell operation, increasing the grain size is expected to depress the defect density of the bulk and suppress charge trapping.10 It is definitely difficult to fabricate high quality and pure phase FA-based perovskite films. Previous studies usually use an anti-solvent such as chlorobenzene (CB) to obtain high quality films.11 However, the fabrication with anti-solvent still suffers from problems, such as environmental pollution, high cost and low reproducibility.12 Some efforts have been made to improve the quality of films without anti-solvent in FA perovskites. For instance, Snaith et al. found that a precursor with methylammonium chloride (MACl) is good for the film morphology and prolongs the carrier's lifetime.13 Zhao et al. used a new precursor HPbI3, which improved the quality and morphology of films compared to the pure FAI–PbI2.14 However, there are still some voids in films and the fabrication of HPbI3 also increases the complexity of device fabrication. These additive methods usually ignore the nucleation process, which leads to limited improvement in crystallinity and grain growth. It is necessary to propose a facile solution without anti-solvent to prepare highly uniform and large-grained perovskite films.
In this work, we introduce an HI and MACl assisted 2D–3D conversion mechanism (HI-MACl ACM) for preparing high quality perovskite films, involving a reduced nucleation rate and nucleation number. This anti-solvent-free method can reduce fabrication costs and is good for environmental protection. We mixed HI and MACl together in a precursor solution adopting a 2D–3D conversion15 to assist transformation of the compact 2D mixed composition HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl precursor structure into 3D MA1−xFAxPbI3. This 2D structure also has an impact on retarding nucleation. Employing HI-MACl ACM, a uniform and highly compact phase-pure black MA1−xFAxPbI3 film without non-perovskite δ-phase was obtained. The largest grain size was obtained from MA1−xFAxPbI3 perovskite film, which was even increased to over 1000 nm by using the HI-MACl ACM. As a result, the FA-based PSCs prepared via HI-MACl ACM (18.86%) exhibit higher photon-to-current conversion efficiency (PCE) than that of pure FAI–PbI2 prepared using anti-solvent treatment (13.76%).
Experimental
Solar cell fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses (Pilkington, TEC15) were prepared with aqueous HCl and zinc powder. Then distilled water and ethanol were used to clean the glasses. The blocking TiO2 (ref. 16 and 17) and layers TiO2 (bl-TiO2) were both deposited by using spray pyrolysis on the as-prepared FTO, which was heated at 430 °C for 30 min. At room temperature, we deposited the mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) film by spin-coating. The prepared films were calcined at 510 °C for 20 min.
172 mg of FAI and 462 mg of PbI2 were dissolved in 1 mL of DMF, which included different ratios (10%, 15% and 25% (molar ratio with respect to FAI)) of MACl and MABr, then 60 μL of HI (45 wt% in H2O) was added into the solution. Before being put into operation, the precursor solution was stirred with a magnetic agitator for 1 h. The prepared dissolved solution (50 μL) was spin-coated onto the mp-TiO2 layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 20 minutes to obtain dense structure films. Then, spiro-OMeTAD18 solution (30 μL) was spin-coated upon the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 20 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution mentioned above consisted of spiro-OMeTAD (73 mg), 4-tert-butyl pyridine (28 μL) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (17.5 μL) (520 mg of Li-TSFI dissolved in 1 mL of acetonitrile) dissolved in 1 mL CB. Eventually, a 60 nm thickness Au electrode was made by vacuum thermal evaporation method.
Characterization
The morphology was determined by field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Sirion 200). The crystallinity and intensity of the perovskite grains were determined by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Rigaku, Smartlab, Japan). We measured the photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) curves using a solar simulator (94042A, USA). The measuring of J–V curves was controlled under the condition of 1 sun illumination. This solar simulator was equipped with a Keithley 2400 source meter. During the measuring process, a square mask of 0.09 cm2 area was used. We used this solution to avoid light scattering and determine the effective area of the device. The spectral data of various intermediates was collected by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher IS51R, USA). The statistical particle size was analyzed by “ImageJ” software. We drew two lines in a particle domain to ascertain the grain size. The two lines were drawn at two constant angles: 0° and −90°. For the values measured at these two angles, we took the mean value as the particle size. For each sample film, we selected 100 grains to measure in SEM images. Steady-state fluorescence PL spectra were measured and recorded by a spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International). The excitation light wavelength was 473 nm from a standard 450 W xenon CW lamp.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) illustrates the detailed process used for the preparation of high quality perovskite films via HI-MACl ACM. A mixed FAI/PbI2/HI/MACl precursor dissolved in DMF was spin-coated on the prepared FTO glass substrate. During spinning, a yellow film was quickly produced at room temperature. When annealed on a hot plate at 150 °C, the yellow film converted to a black film. Additionally, FAI/PbI2/HI/MABr (Br-hybrid) precursor DMF solution and FAI/PbI2 precursor DMF solution with chlorobenzene treatment (I-pure) were also investigated. As we can see from Fig. 1(b–d), with 10, 15, and 25% (molecular ratio) MABr treatment, the films become denser but they are still not ideal perovskite morphology. Fig. 1(e–g) show the SEM images of perovskite films obtained from the Cl-hybrid solution using HI-MACl ACM. After treatment with 10% MACl additive, there are less voids in the films. When the MACl content increased to 15%, FA-based perovskite exhibited highly compact and uniform layers, as shown in Fig. 1(f). By using this HI-MACl ACM without anti-solvent, we obtain high quality morphology. This result can be attributed to retarding nucleation during the 2D to 3D structure conversion. In contrast, pure FAI/PbI2 films with anti-solvent treatment revealed poor morphology (Fig. S1†). More importantly, the size of the particles derived from the optimal content increased to micron size. Increasing the grain size is expected to minimize the defect density of the overall bulk layer and mitigate hysteresis through suppressing charge trapping during solar cell operation.10 The particle size distribution is exhibited in Fig. 4. According to the 2D–3D conversion,15 the transformation of the 2D HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl composite phase into 3D MA1−xFAxPbI3 involves an ion/cation exchange reaction. With further increases of MACl content up to 25%, the morphology of the HI-MACl ACM perovskite film becomes worse compared to the former films.

The XRD patterns of these perovskite films that came from different halide additives are presented in Fig. 2. For the conventional method involving the anti-solvent, it is difficult to fabricate films without δ-phase FAPbI3. Fig. 2(a) shows the crystallinity of the perovskite films prepared from I-pure, Br-hybrid and HI-MACl ACM. When HI-MACl ACM was used, we obtained pure black α-phase films without δ-phase. In the film sample prepared from HI-MACl ACM, the intensity of the (110) is much stronger than in the other two films. Significantly, the diffraction intensity of the MACl doped film prepared from HI-MACl ACM was almost tenfold higher than the Br-hybrid film's diffraction intensity under the same conditions. This implied that the HI-MACl ACM perovskite film exhibits a denser packing structure and better grain crystallinity. The full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the Br-hybrid was better than that of the I-pure. It is consistent with the SEM images in Fig. 1. Fig. 2(c and d) give the (110) and (220) peaks of the antecedent films. These (110) diffraction peaks of three perovskite films are obviously different. The (110) diffraction peak derived from the I-pure films was located at 13.90° and was consistent with previous reports of FAPbI3.19,20 Interestingly, the (110) peak of the perovskite originated from the Br-hybrid was right shifted to 13.98°, which indicated that the MA+ and Br− ions were incorporated into the final perovskite structure since the (110) peaks of MAPbI3 and FAPbBr3 were located at 14.20°and 14.83°.21 This result agrees with that from EDS in Fig. S2† because Br element was remaining. On the basis of previous reports,6 MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are located at 14.2° and 13.9°. The diffraction peak of (110) made by HI-MACl ACM was located at 14.02°. EDS (Fig. S2†) shows that Cl element has been removed from the film. This result suggests that FA+ and MA+ are both incorporated in the perovskite. The diffraction (220) peaks are shown in Fig. 2(d). The FWHM of the (110) and (200) peaks shown in Fig. 2(b) gives the particle size. We could obtain the particle size via the Debye–Scherrer formula (see formula (S1)†). With FWHM decreasing, the grain size increases. The perovskite grain size from HI-MACl ACM shows the maximum dimension of up to micron size.

The XRD patterns of these intermediate are shown in Fig. 3(a). Among these intermediate phases, the XRD pattern from HI-MACl ACM has a characteristic peak at around 8.5°. This XRD peak of sub-10 degrees is similar to the 2D perovskite structure or HPbI3 layer structure according to previous reports. The about 1.0 nm interlayer space came from the circa 8.5° peak. The 8.5° peak could be revealed as (001) peaks since the circa 1 nm spacing distance was logical for the (001) layer thickness. The 1 nm layer thickness can be obtained by the circa 0.2 nm size of FA/MA cations inserting on each side of the approximately 0.6 nm layer spacing [PbX6]. This suggested that the layer thickness of 2D HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl perovskite was reasonable.22 The XRD results revealed that the intermediate phase obtained from HI-MACl ACM had a very similar structure to that of 2D HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl. As listed in Fig. 3(b), the stretch vibration of CO in the IR spectrum obtained in DMF solvent appeared at 1663 cm−1. On adding the solution with additives MABr, MACl and HI, the hydrogen halide will combine with the precursor component and be converted to intermediate FAI–PbI2–DMF, FAI–PbI2–MABr–DMF–HI and 2D HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl. The stretch vibration of CO shifts to a lower wavenumber.

The polarizing microscope images are shown in Fig. 3(c–e). Fig. 3(c–e) exhibit the nucleation progress of I-pure, Br-hybrid and MACl doping HI-MACl ACM, respectively. The films were annealed on the hotplate of the polarizing microscope and pictures were taken at different annealing times. The timing started when the film was put on the hot plate of the microscope. From the end of the spin-coating to being put on the hot plate of the microscope, the three samples go through the same time (about 20 seconds). t = 0 s is actually not the start of the nucleation. When t = 0 s, the HI-MACl ACM image showed no spots on the surface while the other two had some black spots on the surface, which could be considered as primary nucleated particles. When t = 20 s, the HI-MACl ACM image exhibited a few black spots (about 30 spots). When t = 150 s, the nucleation was found to be coming to an end by comparing the particle densities of two time points (t = 100 s, t = 150 s). The number of spots that appeared for the three kinds of perovskite films at different appealing times are listed in Table S1.† The phenomenon suggests that the nucleation process of HI-MACl ACM was suppressed. If the average particle density of the final nucleation is the lowest, the final particle size is the largest. Based on our work, the inhibited nucleation process of HI-MACl ACM is consistent with the large particle size results presented by SEM images.
Perovskite made from HI-MACl ACM performs better than the Br-hybrid perovskite because of the larger particle size.23 This may be attributed to HI and MACl assisting the structure transformation from 2D mixed composition HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl to 3D MA1−xFAxPbI3 perovskites. The 2D–3D structure transformation leads to retarding the nucleation process. Fig. 3(f) shows the HI-MACl ACM process. Previous research has suggested that I is more likely to combine with Pb compared to Cl and MA(FA) tends to cation exchange with H in the HPbI3 frame.24,25 In the HI-MACl ACM intercalation process, the 2D layer-structure HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl phase is converted to 3D MA1−xFAxPbI3. By this concept of transformation, the 2D HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl switches into 3D MA1−xFAxPbI3 structure involving I/Cl and FA(MA)/H ion exchange and then results in evaporation of HCl. The disappearance of Cl element was proven by EDS, as shown in Fig. S2.† It is suggested that the nucleation was supressed during the 2D–3D structure conversion process. This HI-MACl ACM contributes to the formation of highly uniform and large-grained perovskite films.
Perovskite films made from I-pure intermediate, Br-hybrid intermediate, and HI-MACl ACM HMA1−xFAxPbI3Cl intermediate demonstrate different crystallinity qualities and particle sizes. Fig. 4(a–c) display the SEM images of I-pure, Br-hybrid and HI-MACl ACM perovskite films. Obviously, the perovskite layer made by HI-MACl ACM has the most compact and largest particle. We compared the layer from I-pure perovskite to the layers from Br-hybrid and HI-MACl ACM with optimal concentrations of MABr (15%) and MACl (15%). The particle size statistical distributions of the three perovskite films are shown in Fig. 4(d–f). The perovskite particle size from I-pure perovskite (800 nm) is slightly larger than that (700 nm) of Br-hybrid perovskite. The average grain size of the perovskite film made by HI-MACl ACM reaches over 1000 nm, and even increases to 1200 nm. These results indicate that using HI-MACl ACM not only can obtain high quality perovskite films but also larger grain size.

We also investigated the photovoltaic properties of the perovskite films derived from HI-MACl ACM. To compare with I-pure and Br-hybrid perovskite solar cells, three kinds of solar cells with the traditional structure of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au were made under the same conditions. Fig. 5(a) display the J–V curves of the experimental devices. The device parameters (averaged over 20 individual devices), such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), filling factor (FF) and PCE, are listed in Table 1. The I-pure perovskite cell gave a PCE of 13.74%, with a Voc of 0.99 V, a Jsc of 20.83 mA cm−2, and an FF of 66.53%. For Br-hybrid PerSCs, the parameters are 0.98 V, 22.17 mA cm−2, 74.71%, and 16.36%, respectively. Owing to our improved method, the PerSCs made from HI-MACl ACM shows a Voc of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 23.25 mA cm−2, an FF of 76.69% and a PCE of 18.86%. Among these three kinds of devices, the PerSCs made from HI-MACl ACM gave the best photovoltaic performance, obviously. This result suggests that the devices made by HI-MACl ACM have an evident improvement. The superior device performance for HI-MACl ACM perovskite should be ascribed to the larger grain size and the high quality of the films, which could minimize the overall bulk defect density during device fabrication. These can be confirmed by SEM images (Fig. 1(f)) and XRD patterns (Fig. 2(a)). Fig. 5(b) displays the incident photo-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for devices based on I-pure, Br-hybrid, and HI-MACl ACM. The IPCE of PCSs without HI-MACl ACM treatment is below 90%, whereas, the IPCE spectrum of the device made from HI-MACl ACM exhibits a high photo to current conversion efficiency of over 90%. The statistical PCE of the 30 solar cells along with the Gaussian fitting are also displayed in Fig. 5(c). In Fig. 5(d), the Br-hybrid absorption exhibited a slight blue-shift. The Br− remaining in the perovskite film leads to a wider bandgap. The film prepared from HI-MACl ACM showed evidently stronger absorption than the other two samples. This can be attributed to the larger grain size, higher crystallinity and lower reflection.26,27Fig. 5(e) shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra from the three kinds of perovskite films on FTO glass substrates. The full PL spectra of the films are shown in Fig. S3.† Test details are shown in the experimental section. HI-MACl ACM perovskite and I-pure perovskite have the same emission peak at 830 nm. The emission peak of the Br-hybrid perovskite film is located at 810 nm. The intensities of the PL peaks are different. The HI-MACl perovskite has higher PL emission. The three sample perovskite films have different morphologies and different crystallinities. The morphology, smoothness and crystallinity of the film can affect the intensity. From the above data, it can be seen that the morphology and crystallinity of the HI-MACl sample are the best, so the PL intensity is the highest. This result is consistent with the previous literature.23,28,29

It is generally believed that the photovoltaic performance can be influenced by the carrier lifetime.30–32Fig. 5(f) shows the TRPL decay of different perovskite films. The I-pure perovskite film's PL lifetime is only 188 ns, while films originated from Br-hybrid and HI-MACl ACM perovskite increase to 276 ns and 470 ns, respectively. The y-axis of TRPL is on a logarithmic scale, which indicates that the intensity has an exponential function with time.33 Our test results show that the carrier lifetime of the film based on HI-MACl ACM is much longer than those of the other two samples. A longer lifetime reflects more free charge carrier transportation, which is vital to the improvement of device performance. In addition, the fitting equation is a linear equation (see Fig. S4†). We selected 450 nm as the excitation wavelength. The light source is a nitrogen-excited dye laser.
Conclusions
In summary, highly uniform, dense perovskite film and a larger particle size were successfully obtained by taking advantage of the HI-MACl ACM strategy. This anti-solvent-free strategy provided us with another way to improve the quality of perovskite films and device performance, and showed the mechanism of slow crystallization. All kinds of PSC parameters derived from three different samples are obtained. PSCs made by the HI-MACl ACM mechanism demonstrate the best photovoltaic performance owing to the best morphology and highest crystallinity. This work gives us a new option to obtain MA1−xFAxPbI3 film with enhanced grain size and crystallinity for efficient PSCs.
