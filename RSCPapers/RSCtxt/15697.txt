In addition, 50 nm thick silver was sputtered on an FTO substrate as a reflective layer to enhance photon utilization efficiency, while n-TiO2 forms a semiconductor heterojunction to effectively separate photo-generated carriers. After depositing Pt as a hydrogen evolution catalyst, a photocurrent density of −5.5 mA cm−2 was finally obtained, and retained 98% photo-stability after 6 hours, and the IPCE summit reached 68.3% at 415 nm.
Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells have been developed for more than half a century, and greatly complement the current energy supply.1,2 However, the production process of PV cells is complicated and the cost is high.3 Another solar energy utilization strategy is to directly convert solar energy into chemical energy; ever since its first demonstration, there have been numerous efforts to split water into H2 and O2,4,5 followed by hydrogen storage and application with high conversion efficiency.6,7 Cuprous oxide, i.e. Cu2O, is a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting due to a lot of advantages, such as a narrow band gap (∼2 eV), low cost, controllable facets and nontoxicity.8 Nonetheless, the cuprous oxide photocathode suffers from fast photo-induced corrosion, due to the spontaneous self-deactivation.9,10 The redox potential of Cu2O lies between its conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), it can either be self-reduced (Cu2O to Cu) or self-oxidised (Cu2O to CuO) by the photogenerated electrons or holes, respectively, upon light illumination.11 It is not difficult to find that the inactivation of cuprous oxide is closely related to protons. Therefore, isolating protons and proton donors is the first step to achieving high stability.12 In previous studies, scientists tried to coat cuprous oxide with various semiconductor films to isolate electrolyte solutions; however the results are usually unsatisfactory. Typically, Paracchino et al.11 deposited 11 nm TiO2, and the stability was 0% after 20 min illumination. Lin et al.13 modified Cu2O with an ultra-thin film (10 nm) of NiOx, 70% of the initial photocurrent density remained after 20 min irradiation. In addition, coatings such as WO3 and carbon have also proven to lose nearly half of the stability in tens of minutes.14,15 Although oxides can delay the deactivation of Cu2O, they cannot solve the problem fundamentally, and it is difficult for the level of stability to meet the application requirements of several hours, days or even weeks. Therefore, questions inevitably arise about why Cu2O is still super unstable with the protection of various of overlayers, and how to completely stabilize Cu2O by a universal and effective means.
After hundreds of attempts, the authors also found that oxide semiconductors are inefficient for protecting Cu2O from aqueous environments; we even constructed 1 μm thick TiO2 through various preparation means, such as sol–gel, sputtering and hydrothermal synthesis. We attribute the inefficiency of the protection to the “penetration effect”, which means the formation of protective layers is mostly under island growth, making the semiconductors partially unprotected, thus leading to poor stability.16,17 Even if a macroscopically dense oxide film is formed to separate cuprous oxide from electrolyte solutions, liquid molecules can easily pass through grain boundaries and micro-pores through the “capillary effect” until they reach the surface of the cuprous oxide, see Fig. 1a.18 Furthermore, the surfaces of polycrystalline or amorphous oxides, such as TiO2, are relatively hydrophilic, enhancing the “capillary effect”.19 In order to prevent the “penetration effect” of electrolytes and protons, we need a material that is microscopically dense and surface hydrophobic as a protective layer. Herein, for the first time, in situ polymerization of hydrophobic monomers onto a Cu2O surface was applied for modifying the surface properties. In detail, a viscous urethane acrylate (UA) monomer was adopted to cover the Cu2O nanocrystal surface by a high-speed spin coating (>10000 rpm) to guarantee the film is as thin as possible and avoid excessive growth of resistance. Afterwards, the organic monomer was polymerized using ultraviolet light to form a solid polyurethane acrylate (PUA) film. In the macromolecular compound, molecules were tightly bound to each other and resulted in a cross linked structure to avoid grain boundaries and pores unlike oxide semiconductors, whose sketch map is also shown in Fig. 1a. In addition, we can obviously find from the image in Fig. 1b that the surface was changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic after adding a PUA film, which provided a good foundation for the isolation of the underlying Cu2O active component from aqueous electrolytes. Moreover, the SEM images in Fig. 1c further corroborate our inference. The XRD pattern (Fig. S1a†) and the Auger-electron spectrum (Fig. S1b†) verify the crystal form and the copper chemical state of the as-prepared Cu2O nanocubes, consistent with our previous work.20 The Cu2O films synthesized in this work had an average thickness of 800 nm (the cross-sectional SEM image can be found in Fig. S1e†), which grew in a predominant {111} orientation with exposed {100} facets; in previous work, we had proved that the {100} facets are the most active crystal planes compared to the other facets, such as {111} and {110}.20 The partial amplification in the cubic nanocrystals showed a dense and smooth surface morphology. After coating with inorganic oxide films represented by TiO2 prepared by sol–gel synthesis (sg-TiO2) and magnetron sputtering (ms-TiO2), respectively, we found that the obtained films could not effectively cover the surface of the p-Cu2O crystals at the nanometer scale. The sol–gel TiO2 film exhibited numerous grain boundaries and gaps when enlarged to the 100 nm scale, because the bonding between inorganic oxide molecules is weak, resulting in low flexibility and mechanical strength of the overlayer.21 On the other hand, the TiO2 film obtained by magnetron sputtering is basically stacked with TiO2 particles after argon ion bombardment; therefore we can see numerous voids with an average diameter of <10 nm.22 Similarly, cracks and disintegration inevitably appeared due to the fracture of other inorganic films, such as carbon and silicon, in our other studies.23 Summing up the above exploration, we can assume that protons and electrolyte solution molecules can easily pass through these cracks, grain boundaries, gaps and voids to cause the deactivation of cuprous oxide. In contrast, the polymer protective layer conformally coated the sample surface in a uniform fashion, and the cross-linked network formed a satisfactorily thin and compact protective layer; the TEM image in Fig. S2a† shows the PUA film with an average thickness around 50 nm. The tensile strength of the PUA film was measured to be as high as 5.39 MPa, and the excellent mechanical strength means that the PUA is curable even under harsh conditions such as cold shrinkage and thermal expansion, indicating effective protection of the Cu2O active layer from another side.24

(c) The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the sol–gel TiO2, the magnetron sputtered TiO2 and the PUA coated Cu2O nanocrystals. 
The isolation effect of the PUA membrane was supported by a “penetration test”. In the experiment, 500 nm thick methyl red (MR) was deposited on FTO glass by thermal evaporation at 150 °C, and deep red organic layers were then grown on the substrates. Next, 50 nm thick TiO2 and PUA protective layers were deposited by magnetron sputtering and polymerization, respectively. Finally, MR substrates coated with different protective layers were immersed in the Na2SO4 electrolyte. Over time, we found that the MR layer coated with TiO2 gradually turned yellow (methyl red is a pH indicator; it is red at pH under 4.4 and yellow at pH over 6.2) and partially dissolved. After 24 hours, the methyl red layer completely dissolved and disappeared from the FTO substrate. In sharp contrast, the MR layer protected by the PUA film showed no color change and no dissolution was observed after 24 hours, shown in Fig. 2a. This experimental phenomenon once again proves that the PUA polymer is not only dense and hydrophobic but also has good stability in aqueous environments, which can strongly isolate the underlying material from external interference.
 Fig. 2  (a) The isolation effects of the TiO2 and PUA overlayers on methyl red. (b) The absorption enhancement of the 50 nm back silver layer. Insets: the digital images of the Cu2O electrodes with and without the back silver layer. 
The Cu2O synthesized in this work has a band gap around 2 eV, indicating that the photons could be utilized when the wavelength was shorter than 620 nm.20,25 Cu2O has strong absorption for photons having wavelengths shorter than 500 nm; therefore, we can see that the transmittance is almost zero in the wavelength range of 400 to 500 nm. Furthermore, when photon energies approach the band gap, the absorptivity gradually drops, causing the low-energy photons to pass through Cu2O without being absorbed. Increasing the thickness of copper oxide can enhance the absorption of incident light; however, we have also found that the thickened Cu2O bulk increases the distance of carrier migration (the minority-carrier diffusion length in electrodeposited Cu2O is 20–100 nm) and the volume resistance.26 In order to make full use of the incident photons without degrading the physical properties of cuprous oxide, a 50 nm thick silver film was sputtered on the FTO substrate as a reflective layer allowing the unused photons to be re-reflected into the bulk Cu2O to cause secondary absorption. From the transmission spectra shown in Fig. 2b, we can clearly find that the back silver film significantly reduced the transmittance of visible light when the wavelengths are longer than 500 nm, which creates conditions for further improvement of quantum efficiency.
The UV-VIS-NIR spectrum showed extremely high transparency of the PUA film, whose transmittance is maintained above 95% over the entire wavelength range (200–800 nm), shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†). The high transparency allows as much photon energy as possible to reach the underlying semiconductor, indicating that the PUA film is an ideal protective layer material. Intrinsic polymers typically have a resistivity from 102 to 1010 Ω cm, which can be basically classified as semiconductors (102 to 1010 Ω cm) or insulators (>1010 Ω cm).27 The current–voltage (I–V) curve is presented in Fig. S2c and d,† and the electrical resistivity of the obtained transparent PUA polymer layer was detected as <3.8 × 108 Ω cm, indicating that its physical properties are probably close to those of semiconductors.
In photoelectrochemical linear scanning, the PUA coated Cu2O produced a photocurrent of −1.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an argon-purged 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte buffered at a pH of 7. The inset in Fig. 3a compares the photocurrent stability measurements on the Cu2O electrodes with and without PUA protection. The bare Cu2O photocathode yielded a quick decrease in photocurrent from −1.5 to −0.18 mA cm−2 after 1000 s of light illumination when biasing at 0 VRHE, namely 90% of the initial photocurrent is lost, as reported elsewhere.28,29 In contrast, it can be clearly seen that the PUA stabilized the photocurrent of Cu2O between −1.5 and −1.6, and there is no significant decrease for 1000 s except for some noise peaks that can be observed in the photocurrent curve. We speculate that the fluctuation of the photocurrent curve is due to the hydrophobic organic surface not being conducive to hydrogen production. Increasing the PUA thickness would increase the film resistance and extend the carrier migration distance, which results in a decrease of the activity, but the stability is not affected. Therefore, the thinner the PUA layer the better. As the UA monomer is a viscous liquid, the ideal thickness obtained by spin-coating in this work is around 50 nm. As described above, the back silver layer was used to enhance photon absorption, and showed an increase of the photoresponse from −1.6 to −2.2 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE, shown in Fig. 3b. In order to eliminate the unfavourable factors affecting the organic surface for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a 50 nm thick n-TiO2 layer was sputtered on the PUA film to form a semiconductor heterojunction accelerating charge separation. Depositing n-TiO2 greatly increased the photocurrent in the whole potential range from 0 to 0.6 VRHE, and an activity of −2.8 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE was obtained. Finally, we electrodeposited a layer of Pt catalyst on the surface as a HER active site, and we depict the electrode structure in Fig. 4a. The Pt was deposited at a constant current density of −10 μA cm−2 (galvanostatic mode) for a certain time using a source meter. The amount of catalyst deposited is calculated from the amount of electricity; 0.005 μmol cm−2 of Pt atoms were deposited on the surface of cuprous oxide for 5 minutes. Fig. 4b shows the J–V characteristics of the composite Cu2O photocathode. We observed an onset potential higher than +0.6 VRHE, and a photocurrent density of nearly −5.5 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE. The stability performance was studied in detail by chronoamperometry. The photocurrent was maintained for 6 hours and we did not observe an obvious decrease under illumination. We have listed the stability data of some important references for comparison (Table 1), and we found that at present the performance obtained by this experimental strategy is better than those obtained by only using inorganic protective layers. As chopped light illumination time is used in some of the literature, we converted it into continuous illumination time in advance to facilitate the data comparison.

We carried out cyclic voltammetry on bare Cu2O and PUA coated Cu2O in the dark and under light, respectively. In the dark, two oxidation peaks can be easily found when E > 0.6 VRHE (Fig. S3a†), whereas photooxidation and photoreduction occur simultaneously under illumination (Fig. S3b†). In contrast, the protected electrode showed only one feature corresponding to photoreduction of water and no corrosion peaks both in the dark and under light. Moreover, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were performed in the dark and under illumination, respectively, to detect kinetic properties and mechanisms. Since electronic processes in the bulk are normally faster than charge transfer processes or the diffusion of ions in solution, the high frequency response is assigned to events occurring in the semiconductor. A Randles circuit model (inset of Fig. S3†) was used to fit the impedance data; in the equivalent circuit, RS, RCT, QSC and W refer to the series resistance of the cell, the charge transfer resistance, the space-charge constant phase element (CPE) and Warburg diffusion element, respectively.30 After extracting the space-charge capacitance (CSC) from QSC and plotting CSC−2vs. potential (E), we calculated the carrier concentrations (NC) as 3.3 × 1018 cm−3 (in the dark) and 7.5 × 1019 cm−3 (under illumination), respectively. Besides, the fitting parameters indicate that the PUA and TiO2 overlayers increased the RS from 28.2 to 41.3 Ω, while the Ag back layer sharply decreased the RS to 11.02 Ω, which means that the Ag film not only enhances the light utilization, but also reduces the system resistance. Furthermore, the RCT is significantly reduced under illumination compared to that without light in all the systems, which is because photogenerated electrons are in the excited state (higher energy state) and more conducive to migration.
The incident-photon-to-current-efficiency (IPCE) of the composite Cu2O photocathode was analyzed at 0 VRHE (Fig. 5a). The IPCE values show an obvious bulge from 395 to 480 nm, and in a broad region between 380 and 480 nm, we observe IPCE values in excess of 60%. As the photon energy decreases, the IPCE values decrease from the apex 68.3% at 415 nm to 0% after 650 nm. The unproductive absorption of the 50 nm TiO2 overlayer causes a slight decrease of the IPCE values in the UV region.10 Importantly, the integration of the IPCE values with the solar AM 1.5 spectrum yields ∼5.6 mA cm−2, validating our light source for true AM 1.5 solar simulation. We performed Faraday efficiency measurements in a gas-tight reactor, which is connected to a gas chromatography (GC) for on-line analysis. The system was pre-vacuumed so that the gas molecules (H2 and O2) generated on the composite Cu2O photocathode and the Pt counter electrode, respectively, can be released as soon as possible without affecting the accuracy of the test. The evolved gas was continuously circulated in the whole system to ensure the uniformity of the gas concentration. The Faraday efficiency was calculated between 94% and 97% in a 1 hour gas production reaction, presented in Fig. 5b. The loss of 3–6% of faraday efficiency is probably due to the gas circulation inefficiency and the detection error caused by the surface adsorption.

Conclusions
A continuous and compact PUA film of 50 nm thickness was polymerized on a Cu2O photocathode as a hydrophobic protective layer to isolate proton donors in aqueous environments. Furthermore, 50 nm silver was sputtered on a FTO substrate for reusing the unabsorbed photons, while an n-TiO2 layer was found to be indispensable to form a heterojunction accelerating the charge separation. Finally, 0.005 μmol cm−2 of Pt active sites were deposited to catalyze the water reduction reaction and the composite Cu2O photocathode in this work obtained an enhanced photocurrent density of −5.5 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE, accompanied by a photo-stability above 98% after 6 hours, and an IPCE summit of 68.3% at 415 nm.
