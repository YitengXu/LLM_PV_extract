    , Accepted 23rd July 2019First published on 23rd July 2019AbstractThe solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of mesoscopic solar cells is highly dependent on electron extraction under solar irradiation and determines the charge recombination processes within devices. Boosting charge transfer via building energy level alignment has been proved to be a promising method to enhance the output power of solar cells. In the current work, we present the successful fabrication of functional biomass-converted carbon quantum dots with graded energy levels by doping nitrogen or sulphur atoms from lotus root powder. When employed as light absorbers for mesoscopic solar cells, light harvesting and electron extraction can be markedly increased arising from the band alignment of graded carbon quantum dots, yielding maximal power conversion efficiencies of 0.158% and 0.208% for bi- and tri-cascaded photovoltaics, respectively. The primary results demonstrate that the employment of an energy-graded architecture is a promising strategy to optimize the device output. Following this line of thought, we further fabricate a co-sensitized device by integrating graded carbon quantum dots with N719 dyes to enhance the electron extraction capability. The final device yields an efficiency as high as 9.04%, showing the potential application of carbon quantum dots in high-performance solar cells.
Introduction
The development of high-efficiency quantum dots (QDs) is a persistent project for modern electronic and optoelectronic devices. Great research efforts have been devoted to the architectural design of QDs as light harvesters in sensitized solar cells due to their unique advantages such as high extinction coefficients, tunable bandgaps, broad absorption ranges, and high resistance against photo-bleaching behavior compared to the state-of-the-art organic chromophores.1–3 Generally, metal sulfide QDs with various architectures are preferred sensitizers in mesoscopic solar cells with a recorded power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to as high as 12.75%.4 However, the toxicity (Cd or Pb) and serious charge recombination reactions are two great challenges for further development of QD sensitized solar cells (QDSCs).5,6 A preferred solution to break through this impasse is to establish green QDs including In- or Cu-based species passivated with insulating long-chain ligands which must be removed upon assembling into solar cells.7,8 Therefore, how to simultaneously resolve the above-mentioned issues is crucial in QDSCs. Following this line of thought, carbon quantum dots (CQDs), a new group of carbonaceous materials with size <10 nm, have been regarded as promising light activators for photovoltaic application owing to their tunable energy bandgap that covers the matching bandgap range for solar cells.9,10 Until now, enormous efforts have been devoted to incorporating CQDs into photoelectric devices, however, with an efficiency lower than 1% owing to the inevitable charge loss. For example, Ozin et al. presented a preliminary exploration of the utilization of CQDs as sensitizers in nanocrystalline TiO2-based solar cells which achieved a PCE of 0.13%.10 Therefore, the charge recombination has still been the major limitation for high power conversion efficiencies.
According to previous reports, the photovoltaic behaviors of solar cells upon solar illumination can be significantly enhanced via employing CQDs as co-photosensitizers in the corresponding mesoscopic-structured solar cells arising from the accelerated charge extraction, demonstrating the importance to realize graded architecture.11–13 There is a fact that the impurity atom can induce a series of positive effects on the intrinsic electronic construction as well as on energy levels of CQDs compared to pristine materials, showing promise in tuning band alignment. Therefore, in the current work, sulphur- and nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (S-CQDs and N-CQDs) with graded bandgaps have been successfully fabricated by a simple hydrothermal process, avoiding the utilization of insulating long-chain ligands. After systematically characterizing their energy bands and absorption behaviors, we have further designed a graded CQD multi-layer by sequential deposition of N-CQDs, CQDs and S-CQDs. When applied in QDSCs, the photo-generated electrons are effectively extracted owing to the band alignment of these graded CQDs, leading to enhanced PCEs up to 0.158% and 0.208% for bi- and tri-cascaded photovoltaics, which are much higher than those of individual CQD-based devices. The preliminary results demonstrate that it is a promising strategy of building graded CQD multi-layers for high-efficiency mesoscopic solar cells. Considering the effective electron extraction capability of this graded CQD, a novel dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with the architecture of an N-CQD/N719/CQD/S-CQD multilayer is further assembled and an efficiency as high as 9.04% is achieved, showing the potential application of this novel graded CQDs in photovoltaics.
Experimental section
Materials
Unless stated otherwise, all materials and reagents were purchased from Aladdin and used without further purification.
Synthesis of pristine and doped CQDs
The pristine and S- or N-doped CQDs were synthesized using lotus root powder as carbon sources by a hydrothermal method. In detail, 1 g of lotus root powder was dispersed in 40 mL of deionized water under vigorous agitation. Subsequently, the reagent solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. After the hydrothermal reaction at 170 °C for 6 h, the as-synthesized solution was dialyzed using a 3500D membrane for purification. 50 μL of sulphuric acid (18.4 mol L−1) or 500 mL of ammonium hydroxide (14.79 mol L−1) was used before the hydrothermal reaction to prepare S-CQDs or N-CQDs, respectively. Finally, three CQD aqueous solutions were stored at 5 °C for usage.
Preparation of photoanodes
Colloidal TiO2 films with a thickness of 10 μm and an active area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 were prepared by coating TiO2 colloid onto freshly cleaned FTO glass substrates (12 ohm per square) by a doctor-blade method.14 These FTO glass-supported TiO2 films were calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min in air to obtain m-TiO2 electrodes, which were subsequently sensitized by concentrated pristine or doped CQD aqueous solution for 12 h to obtain a one-fold CQD layer. Alternatively, the m-TiO2 electrodes were sequentially immersed in different CQD aqueous solutions or 0.25 mM N719 ethanol solution for 6 h, 4 h and 3 h to obtain multi-layered photoanodes, respectively.
Photovoltaic assembly and measurements
Each device was built by sandwiching an I−/I3− redox electrolyte between a pyrolyzed Pt counter electrode and a CQD sensitized m-TiO2 photoanode and sealed with a Surlyn film (30 μm in thickness). A liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.1 M tetraethylammonium iodide, 0.1 M tetramethylammonium iodide, 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium iodide, 0.1 M NaI, 0.1 M KI, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.05 M 4-tert-butyl-pyridine in acetonitrile. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells with an active area of 0.25 cm2 were recorded using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation under irradiation of simulated solar light from a 100 W xenon arc lamp under an ambient atmosphere. The incident light intensity was controlled at 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell). A black mask was applied on the surface to avoid stray light.
Characterization studies
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations were carried out using a Tecnai G2 F20S-TWIN 200KV electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed using a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Metash UV-8000 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using an FLS920P Edinburgh Analytical Instrument apparatus. The interfacial charge transfer resistances of the devices were measured employing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technology from 0.01 Hz to 106 Hz at an ac amplitude of 10 mV and subsequently fitted using Z-view software.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the biomass-converted CQDs
The successful synthesis of bandgap-controllable CQDs is crucial to design graded CQD multi-layers. Generally, the corresponding products are micrometer-sized sheets produced via traditional synthesis techniques, including chemical vapor deposition,15 arc-discharge,16 solvothermal,17 and post-treatment of graphene or graphene oxide,18 and are unfavorable for use as sensitizers in photovoltaic devices. In the current work, taking lotus root powder as a raw material, CQDs can be successfully fabricated via simple hydrothermal treatment under 170 °C for 6 h, which can be verified by the optical image of the resultant yellow solution, as shown in Fig. 1a. A reasonable reaction mechanism behind this phenomenon can be explained according to the hydrolyzation of the raw material at elevated temperature. It is well known that starch is the main composition of lotus root powder and it can be hydrolyzed to glucose easily during the hydrothermal process. Upon complicated dehydration reactions under a high-pressure atmosphere, glucose molecules can be converted into CQDs and the corresponding schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 1a.19 In this fashion, it can be deduced that the reaction condition plays a crucial role in determining the final properties of the as-prepared CQDs. When adding sulphuric acid or ammonium hydroxide as catalysts into the solution, the optical properties of CQDs can be well-tuned with changing emission wavelengths and intensities under ultraviolet (UV) light excitation, which is mainly attributed to the replacement of the initial carbon atoms by S or N atoms in hexagon-conjugated construction at the surfaces (or edges), leading to the formation of functional groups.20 In order to characterize the morphology and size distribution of the as-prepared CQDs, the TEM image has been obtained, as shown in Fig. 1b, revealing that the CQDs are homogeneously distributed with an average size ranging from 4 to 5 nm. The HRTEM image (Fig. 1c) shows a well-defined crystalline structure with a lattice fringe distance of 0.204 nm, which is attributable to the (101) diffraction plane of the graphitic structure. The SAED pattern reveals a polycrystalline structure of biomass-converted CQDs. Until now, it can be concluded that the CQDs have been successfully fabricated.

According to the aforementioned results, it can be seen that the S and N dopants from sulphuric acid and ammonium hydroxide have significant impacts on the optical behaviors of CQDs. Various light-emitting properties are mainly attributed to the deviation of bandgaps, which will finally affect the performances of mesoscopic solar cells. Compared to theoretical concepts and experimental achievements, the intrinsic mechanism between dopants and properties of CQDs can be discovered.21 The chemical compositions of various CQDs without or with dopants (S-CQDs and N-CQDs) are studied by XPS characterization, as shown in Fig. 2a, c and f. Both CQDs, S-CQDs and N-CQDs, have similar characteristic peaks located at ∼286 eV and ∼534 eV, corresponding to C1s and O1s, respectively, demonstrating that the as-prepared CQDs are composed of a partially oxidic carbon framework under elevated temperature. According to typical fittings for graphite oxide, the chemical bond of C1s from CQDs (Fig. 2b) and N-CQDs (Fig. 2g) can be split into three carbon moieties: CC (284.4 eV), C–O (286.5 eV) and CO (288.0 eV). Intriguingly, the C1s peak of S-CQDs as shown in Fig. 2d can be fitted to four different carbon moieties centered at CC (284.4 eV), C–O (286.5 eV), CO (287.7 eV) and O–CO (289.1 eV), which may be attributed to the stronger oxidizing capability of sulfuric acid.22 Owing to the decoration by these oxygenic groups, CQDs can tightly integrate with the functional groups on the surface of m-TiO2, facilitating charge transfer between those interfaces.

By doping CQDs with S dopants, an additional two peaks centered at ∼ 168 eV and ∼ 233 eV, attributed to S2p and S2s are detected in comparison with pristine CQDs.23 The high-resolution S2p XPS spectrum in Fig. 2e includes four peaks. The peaks at 168.6 eV and 169.7 eV are responsible for the C–S(O)x–C bond, while the peaks centered at 163.1 eV and 164.3 eV represent S2p 3/2 and S2p 1/2 of thiophene, respectively. The N-CQDs have a sharp peak at ca. 400 eV, which corresponds to N1s. The high-resolution N1s spectrum of the CQDs in Fig. 2h reveals the presence of both pyridine-like (398.5 eV) and pyrrolic-like (401 eV) N atoms,24 indicating that S and N have been doped into the carbon structure and formed thiophene units. The incorporation of impurity atoms into the crystal lattice of the regular carbon framework has a great impact on the crystal structure of CQDs and the electron distribution on the surface, which can be verified by the changed characteristic peak intensity of the CC band. In this fashion, the energy levels of CQDs can be tuned, leading to different optical properties, which will be discussed as follows. Upon optimizing the band alignment, the interfacial electron extraction can be boosted when assembling into the corresponding photovoltaic devices.
The as-synthesized CQD, S-CQD and N-CQD solutions are yellowish-brown under ambient atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 3a, whereas they are green, orange and blue colors upon irradiation under an excitation wavelength of 365 nm, suggesting that all biomass-converted CQDs show similar behavior to emit photofluorescent light. Two characteristic absorption peaks centered at 225 and 280 nm are detected from all CQD aqueous solutions (see Fig. 3b), which are similar to those of the CQDs prepared from reduced graphene oxide.25,26 In detail, the absorption peak at 225 nm is ascribed to the π → π* transitions of the aromatic CC sp2 domains, while the peak at 280 nm refers to the n → π* transition of the CO bond. Meanwhile, the absorption peaks centered at 450 nm for S-CQDs and 305 nm for N-CQDs result from the trapping of excited-state energy of the surface states.27,28 Compared to the CQDs synthesized from other methods,29 the CQDs of our work have obvious advantages to extend the spectral absorption to 600 nm from 400 nm by doping S or N species. In order to study the effects of dopants on CQDs, their PL emission spectra recorded under various excitation wavelengths ranged from 330 to 510 nm, as shown in Fig. 3c. It is well known that the excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescent properties of different CQDs demonstrate that there are many different exciton recombination paths because the fluorescence generally results from the radiation recombination of excitons at the surface sites of CQDs.30 The pure CQDs show nearly excitation-independent PL properties with the emission wavelength of 540 nm under various excitation wavelengths, which can be explained by the uniform size and surface state of those sp2 clusters. S-CQDs have similar characteristics to those of pure CQDs which also show nearly excitation-independent PL properties under various excitation wavelengths. However, there is a shoulder located at around 480 and 500 nm for S-CQDs excited with 430 and 410 nm, respectively. This emission shoulder may be attributed to the intermediate transition before the occurrence of radiative recombination, such as the n → π* transition of the C–S–C functional group. The precise reason still needs to be explored in the future. The fluorescent emission peaks of N-CQDs are broad and have a redshift along with the increase in the excitation wavelength from 330 to 510 nm. The understanding of the optical properties induced by N doping remains an open question. According to previous reports, the potential mechanism behind this phenomenon may be attributed to the optical selection of differently sized nanoparticles (the quantum effect) or different emissive traps on the surface of S-CQDs or N-CQDs.31 Until now, we have concluded that doping foreign atoms can regulate the optical properties of CQDs, realizing the widened solar spectrum absorption and promising applications in photovoltaics in spite of the unclear mechanism of atom doping.

Photovoltaic performances of tandem solar cells
PL spectra of CQDs can be regarded as transitions from σ and π orbitals, i.e. from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). To estimate their HOMO and LUMO energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) has been carried out on a standard three-electrode system and the corresponding CV curves of various CQDs on the platinum electrode are shown in Fig. S1† and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The values of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels as well as the electrochemical energy gap (Eg) of various QD samples are calculated according to ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.4) V and EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.4) V,32 where Eox and Ered are the onset potentials of oxidation and reduction, respectively. Obviously, the presence of the dopant has a significant effect on the bandgap of CQDs. The HOMO and LUMO levels are increased to −5.23 eV and −3.80 eV for S-CQDs compared to −5.27 eV and −3.83 eV for pure CQDs, respectively. Diametrically, the incorporation of N into CQDs results in the reduced HOMO and LUMO levels with an increased Eg value of 1.48 eV. Owing to the above-mentioned photoelectric behavior and energy-level structures, these CQDs have great potential applications in solar cells as green sensitizers to substitute traditional chalcogenide quantum dots.

Upon incorporation of these CQDs into photoanodes as light-harvesters and combination with the I−/I3− redox electrolyte and Pt counter electrode, as shown in Fig. 4a, the so-called graded solar cell operates according to the charge transportation paths in Fig. 4b. UV-vis absorption spectra of the m-TiO2/N-CQDs as a function of sensitization time are used to estimate the absorption process of CQDs on the surface of m-TiO2, whose porosity and roughness are 86.2% and 91.24 m2 g−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. S2a.† The increase in the absorption intensity at 450 nm demonstrates an increased N-CQD loading amount at the m-TiO2 electrode, which is in good accordance with the absorption spectra of CQDs, as shown in Fig. 3. By plotting the absorbance at 450 nm versus absorption time, as shown in Fig. S2b,† the N-CQDs show an equilibrium absorption at 12 h. Due to similar physical performances of N-CQDs, CQDs and S-CQDs, the total immersion time of the photosensitizer layer is confirmed at 12 h. Fig. 4c shows the J–V curves of various CQD-tailored solar cells and the corresponding parameters such as power conversion efficiency (η), open-circuit potential (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 2. It can be found that the highest η values are 0.0336%, 0.050% and 0.076% for the solar cell devices sensitized by S-CQDs, pure CQDs and N-CQDs, respectively. Compared to pure CQDs and S-CQDs, N-CQD-containing devices have the highest η value, arising from their broader absorption range in UV-vis absorption spectra and better matching LUMO level with the conduction band (CB) of m-TiO2. The outstanding power conversion efficiency may be attributed to the large number of functional groups on the surface of N-CQDs, increasing the interaction between TiO2 and CQDs, and therefore boosting the charge transfer from N-CQDs to TiO2.

However, the solar-to-electric conversion efficiency is relatively lower in comparison with state-of-the-art dye-sensitized solar cells owing to the deficient incident light absorption, the large band offset between the CB of TiO2 and single CQDs as well as the non-negligible backward recombination reactions at CQD/TiO2 interfaces stemming from the presence of surface defect states of CQDs. Herein, we propose the graded CQD multi-layered structure by combining various CQDs into photovoltaics according to the energy-matching principle. The graded photoanodes (with bi- or tri-cascaded layers) are sequentially deposited onto m-TiO2 film with various architectures, including S-CQDs/CQDs, S-CQDs/N-CQDs, CQDs/S-CQDs, CQDs/N-CQDs, N-CQDs/CQDs, N-CQDs/S-CQDs and N-CQDs/CQDs/S-CQDs. The schematic diagram depicting the possible arrangement of the N-CQD/CQD/S-CQD cell is shown in Fig. 4b. Among cascaded devices, the highest η value is 0.208% for the N-CQD/CQD/S-CQD tailored solar cell with Voc of 0.538 V, Jsc of 0.543 mA cm−2 and FF of 71.1% (see Table 2), which is much higher than other graded CQD devices. The potential reasons can be attributed to the improved photon absorption and boosted electron transfer owing to the matchable energy levels. This conclusion can be also verified by the Nyquist EIS plots in Fig. 4d, confirming the sluggish transfer processes. In order to further prove this phenomenon, high-resolution time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPL) of S-CQDs, CQDs/S-CQDs and N-CQD/CQD/S-CQD-based photoanodes are performed under 385 nm excitation, as shown in Fig. 4e. It can be seen that the electron lifetime has significantly decreased for the graded CQD-sensitized photoanode compared to the individual S-CQD-sensitized photoanode, following the order of N-CQDs/CQDs/S-CQDs < CQDs/S-CQDs < S-CQDs, directly proving that recombination is avoided by an ultra-fast charge transfer. These results highlight the importance of sequential arrangement of different CQDs within the m-TiO2 network to maximize the photon capture and participate in the charge injection process.
The band positions of the CQDs within the m-TiO2 are type-II band alignment which may improve the charge separation by creating a favorable energy cascade, thus promoting the directionality of electron transfer from larger bandgap CQDs to smaller bandgap CQDs.33 Such band alignment will increase the depletion region and electron accumulation. Therefore, the backward recombination losses are markedly reduced compared to individual CQD-sensitized photovoltaics. In conclusion, this extraordinarily graded structure has promoting effects on increased depletion regions and carrier collection and therefore provides more opportunities for designing high-performance solar cells.
Photovoltaic performances of co-sensitized solar cells
Generally, the low coverage of CQDs at TiO2 surface results in more contact sites between TiO2 and electrolyte, leading to electron leakage with the redox species in the electrolyte. To address this issue, N719 dyes having a matching bandgap with graded CQDs are introduced to realize co-sensitization, as shown in Fig. 5a. The electron transportation processes at four-cascaded TiO2/N-CQD/N719/CQD/S-CQD interfaces are demonstrated in Fig. 5b. The energy-level structure of the N719 dye makes it as an ideal interlayer between N-CQDs and CQDs, enabling electron transfer according to S-CQDs → CQDs → N719 → N-CQDs → TiO2. Fig. 5c shows IPCE spectra of solar cells sensitized by N719-only and graded N-CQD/N719/CQD/S-CQD multi-layers. Apparently, the combination of a graded CQD multi-layer with N719 increases spectral response in visible-light regions. Fig. 5d compares their J–V curves under simulated sunlight illumination. A maximized efficiency of 9.04% is obtained for a graded solar cell in comparison with 6.90% for N719-only devices, yielding a 30.1% enhancement. A significant improvement in Jsc (∼ 26%) output is caused by the electron accumulation at a multi-cascaded light-absorber layer, while the increased Voc value is mainly contributed to efficient electron extraction and therefore reduced recombination reactions. Meanwhile, the FF value which depends on the recombination processes also increases from 69.6% to 70.4%, further demonstrating lower recombination loss in graded N-CQD/N719/CQD/S-CQD solar cells.

The advanced charge-transfer processes of the graded structure are verified by charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and electron lifetime (τ = 1/2πf) at the photocathode/electrolyte interface, as shown in Fig. 6a and b. The graded solar cell has a smaller Rct value of 39 ohm cm2 and a larger τ value of 4.08 ms. In view of the photo-generated electron transfer capacity, we utilize the relationships between photoelectric parameters and light intensity to estimate the recombination reactions within devices. Fig. 6c represents the dependence of Jsc plots as a function of light intensity. According to Jsc ∝ Iα (α ≤ 1), where I and α are the light intensity and an exponential factor, respectively, the bi-molecular recombination ought to be minimum (α ≈ 1) for maximum carrier sweep out at the short circuit.34 In comparison with the fitted results of the traditional N719 sensitized device with α = 0.82, the α value of the graded device is promoted to 0.977, indicating that the bi-molecular recombination is close to minimum. This result demonstrates that the charge recombination by designing a graded light absorption layer can be markedly reduced due to electron accumulation and charge extraction. Fig. 6d shows the plots of Voc as a function of the light intensity. The fitted curves give a slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of the light intensity with a slope of∼ KT/e, where K, T, and e are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and elementary charge, respectively.35,36 The Voc output of the N719-only device has a slope of 2.41 KT/e in comparison with 2.21 KT/e for the tandem solar cell, implying that lower trap-assisted recombination is determined on this physical proof-of-concept photovoltaics.

Conclusions
In summary, we present here the controllable synthesis of biomass-converted CQDs by doping S and N atoms. Due to the matchable energy-level structures and increased electron extraction at graded CQD multi-layers, the photovoltaic performances of corresponding solar cells are markedly enhanced in comparison with the pristine device. By co-sensitizing mesoscopic TiO2 with N719 and graded CQD layers, the final four-cascaded solar cell yields a maximized power conversion efficiency of 9.04% compared with 6.90% for N719-only photovoltaics. However, compared to traditional QDSCs, the efficiency of the CQD-based device is still lower. How to optimize the fabrication strategy is crucial to obtain defect-free absorbers and therefore enhance the power conversion efficiency in the future. According to the current results, the concept of designing a graded light-absorber structure has provided many opportunities in increasing electron injection, and charge extraction and reducing backward recombination to guide us to explore high-performance photovoltaic devices.
