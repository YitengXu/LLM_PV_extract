    , Accepted 15th July 2009First published on 10th August 2009AbstractThree conjugated dendrimers containing electron-accepting sulfonyldibenzene (SDB) cores and electron-donating triphenylamine dendrons have been synthesized through a convergent synthetic strategy without any protection/deprotection chemistry. The dendrimers were highly soluble in common organic solvents, and could form good quality optical films by spin coating. Their thermal, optical and electrical properties are manipulated by attaching different peripheral dendrons. Using these dendrimers as donors and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor, the bulk heterojunction solar cells with a structure of ITO–PEDOT–dendrimers:PCBM–LiF–Al were fabricated. The cell based on dendrimer G0 shows a relatively high power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.34% under AM 1.5 illumination of 100 mW cm−2.
Introduction
In the past decade, organic solar cells (OSCs) have been extensively investigated because of their advantages of low-cost, light weight, and easy fabrication.1–7 Since the 1%-efficient thin-film OSCs based on a single donor–acceptor (D–A) heterojunction was reported by Tang,8 the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has steadily improved through the design and synthesis of new materials and the optimization of the cell structures. Among the new active materials, small-molecules have advantages such as well-defined molecule structure, relatively simple and reproducible synthesis and purification, its monodisperse nature, ability to be vacuum deposited in multi-layer stacks, and so on. For the purpose of practical applications, nevertheless, small molecules have to be processed by expensive techniques, for example, vacuum sublimation and vapor deposition, which are not well suited to the manufacture of large size devices. Polymers are generally of lower purity than small molecules but can achieve larger size films at much lower costs using solution-based deposition techniques such as spin coating, inkjet, and roll-to-roll printing. Thus, the ideal materials should have advantages of both small molecules and polymers.

        Dendrimers with molecular weights in the favorable range between 1000–10000 g mol−1 can be purified to a high degree using chromatographic techniques, and deposited into a thin film from solution by a simple spin-coating process.9
Meanwhile, triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives have shown excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, electron donating ability, and isotropic optical and charge-transport properties as well as a three-dimensional propeller structure.10,11
On the other hand, molecules with D–π–A structure have many advantages, such as lower bandgap due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor and easily controlled energy levels by introducing acceptor and donor moieties with different pull–push electron abilities into the molecules.12 So considerable research efforts have led to much progress in the synthesis of new molecules which mainly consist of a TPA moiety linked to different acceptor moieties, including dicyanovinyl, perylene, benzothiadiazole, or 2-pyran-4-ylidenemalononitrile.13,14
Therefore, dendrimers containing triphenylamine dendrons and the D–π–A structure could be expected to be one of the ideal active molecules for the application of thin-film OSCs.
In this paper, we designed and synthesized three novel dendrimers with symmetrical donor–π-bridge–acceptor–π-bridge–donor (D–π–A–π–D) structure with sulfonyldibenzene as the core and triphenylamines as dendrons. These conjugated dendrimers have good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and THFetc. They also exhibit good film forming properties which is of great importance for their application in photovoltaic devices. We investigated the photovoltaic properties of the three dendrimers by fabricating the bulk heterojunction solar cells with a structure of ITO–PEDOT–dendrimers:PCBM–LiF–Al, and the PCEs of the solar cells based on the three dendrimers are 0.34%, 0.19% and 0.06%, respectively.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of materials
The synthetic routes to the core and dendrons as well as the dendrimer are shown in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2. Compound 1 was synthesized by a Friedel–Crafts acylation from 4-methylbenzene-1-sulfonyl chloride and toluene with a yield of 68%. The bromination of compound 1 by employing N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in benzene successfully afforded the desired compound 2. Compound 3 can be easily prepared from compound 2 through the reaction with the triethyl phosphate under the protection of N2. The strategy as reported by our group15 for the synthesis of the aldehyde-focused dendron is illustrated in Scheme 1. Firstly, 4-(diphenylamino)-benzaldehyde, which is the first generation aldehyde-focused dendron G0–CHO,16,17 was readily obtained from TPA through a Vilsmeier reaction in a yield of 90%. Then, iodination of G0–CHO with KI–KIO3 in AcOH at 85 °C provided compound 418 with a good yield of 95%, and the compound 5 was prepared in a 76% yield from the reaction of G0–CHO with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide. After that, the second generation aldehyde-focused dendron G1–CHO was prepared in a 55% yield via the coupling of compound 4 and compound 5 through the Heck reaction.19 The third generation aldehyde-focused dendron G2–CHO can be obtained from compound 4 and compound 6 through the Heck reaction, while compound 6 can be synthesized by the Wittig reaction20 of G1–CHO and methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide. The first-generation of dendrimer G0 was synthesized via a typical Wittig–Horner reaction between aldehyde G0-CHO and compound 3 in dry THF, using potassium tert-butoxide as base in a yield of 78%. The second and third generation G1 and G2 were obtained through the same synthetic method in yields of 61% and 45%, respectively. Dendrons and dendrimers were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR, elemental analysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. G0, G1 and G2 exhibit an IR absorption band around 960 cm−1 arising from the wagging vibration of the trans-double bond.21,22 Additional definitive evidence for the molecular structures of the dendrimers was obtained from MALDI-TOF mass spectra. And the deviation between the calculated and experimentally measured m/z values was no more than one mass unit.

Thermal properties
The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) second heating thermograms of G0, G1 and G2 recorded at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen protection indicated that the Tg of G0, G1 and G2 (81 °C, 138 °C and 175 °C) increases gradually, due to the reduced segmental motions and enhanced intermolecular dipolar interaction to a certain extent (see Fig. S1, ESI†).
Absorption

Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the dendrimers in films coated on quartz substrate. G0 displays two absorption peaks at 304 nm and 410 nm, which are ascribed to the absorption of the n–π* transition of the SDB moiety and the intramolecular charge transfer between the TPA donor and the SDB acceptor, respectively. It was also observed that G1 displayed two absorption peaks at 307 nm and 416 nm, and G2 at 311 nm and 419 nm. Comparing with G0, the ICT transitions of G1 and G2 red-shift 6 nm and 9 nm, respectively. This explains that the increase of TPA units with the increasing generations of dendrimers results in the extension of the conjugated length and a stronger electron-donating ability of the donor parts in G1 and G2. It also indicates that the conjugated length in the dendrimers could be increased by the introduction of TPA units,23 but the increasing degree might be saturated when the conjugated chain was enlarged to a certain extent by such large size and non-coplanar TPA dendrons.

UV-vis absorption-coefficient (α) spectra of G0, G1 and G2 in the films. All films were measured on a glass–ITO–PEDOT:PSS substrate and corrected for substrate absorption. 
It is noted that the Y-axis in Fig. 1 represents the extinction coefficient (α) of the three dendrimer films with the same thickness. The decrease of the extinction coefficient from G0 to G2 films is due to the large size of TPA dendrons which occupy a large space in the dendrimer films. When the thickness of the films of G0, G1 and G2 is the same (70 nm), the molecule number of G2 in the film is less than those of G0 and G1, resulting in less ICT transition and ultimately the decrease of the absorption from G0 to G2 films. The UV and PL spectra of G0, G1 and G2 in solution can be seen in the ESI.†
Electrochemistry

Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) diagrams of the three dendrimers in CH2Cl2 in the presence of TBAPF6 as the supporting electrolyte with platinum button working electrodes, a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgNO3reference electrode under an N2 atmosphere. The redox potential of Fc/Fc+, which has an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV relative to the vacuum level for calibration, is located at 0.20 V in TBAPF6 (0.1 M)–CH2Cl2 solution at a scan rate of 100 mV S−1. The CV curve of G0 shows a pair of reversible redox peaks in the negative region because of the high electrical activity of the SDB core, but there are no redox peaks in the negative region for G1 and G2 due to the surrounding effect of TPA flock. In the positive region, the oxidation peaks of G0, G1 and G2 can be attributed to TPA donating groups. The onset oxidation potentials (EonsetOx) are observed at +0.67 V, +0.63 to +0.45 V for G0, G1 and G2. The evaluation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels can be done according to the following equations:24 HOMO (eV) = −(eEonsetOx + 4.60 eV)(1) LUMO (eV) = −(eEonsetRed + 4.60 eV)(2)where EonsetOx and EonsetRed are the onset redox potentials relative to Ag/Ag+.25 The electrochemical properties as well as the energy levels of G0, G1 and G2 are summarized in Table 1.

The HOMO energy levels of G0, G1 and G2 is −5.27 eV, −5.23 eV and −5.05 eV, respectively, which means that with the increase of the number of TPAs in the external group, the electron-donating ability of the external groupis enhanced. The LUMO energy level of G0 is obtained from eqn (2), while those of G1 and G2 were estimated from the HOMO energy level and the optical band gap (Egopt).26 The LUMO energy levels of the three dendrimers are similar due to their containing the same acceptor group SDB.
Quantum-chemical calculations
In order to investigate the electron distribution of the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the dendrimers, quantum-chemical calculations were carried out through the Gaussian 03 program at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.27Fig. 3 shows the electron distribution of the LUMO and HOMO in the optimized ground-state structure of G0. Comparison of the electron distribution in the frontier on the molecular orbitals reveals that the HOMO is localized on the triphenylamine donor moiety, while the LUMO is localized on the sulfonyldibenzene acceptor moiety, which is generally an indication of a HOMO → LUMO absorption transition bearing a significant charge-transfer character.28,29

Photovoltaic properties
In order to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the three dendrimers, bulk heterojunction solar cells (cell 1, cell 2 and cell 3) with G0, G1 and G2 as donors and PCBM as an acceptor were fabricated. Devices based on compound–PCBM blend films with varied ratios (2 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3, 1 : 4) were prepared, and the active layer thickness was optimized. We found that when the blend ratio reaches 1 : 2, the device performance is the best and 65–70 nm is the best active layer thickness for all kinds of devices. Detailed information is listed in Table S1 ESI.† The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the three cells under monochromatic irradiation are shown in Fig. 4, which coincide well with the absorption spectra of the three active layers. The photoresponse in the range of 300–360 nm is from the absorption of n–π* and PCBM and that in the visible region 370–550 nm is mainly from the absorption of ICT from the donor to the acceptor. The different IPCEs of the three cells originated from the different PCEs.

Fig. 5 shows the current density–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the solar cells with the thickness of an active layer of 70 nm under AM 1.5 (AM: air mass) illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Cell 1 has the best PCE of 0.34% compared with cell 2 and cell 3, with a relatively high short circuit current (Isc) of 1.6 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.28, which is relatively lower than the PCE of solar cells based on donor–acceptor molecules reported in other papers.14,30Cell 2 reveals Isc of 0.74 mA cm−2, so despite the equal Voc and higher FF (0.32), the PCE is about half of that of cell 1. For cell 3, the Voc decreases slightly to 0.77, with an FF equal to 0.28, and a PCE of 0.06%. The photovoltaic parameters of the solar cells are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the drop of PCE from G0 to G2 mainly results from the drop of Isc. As we know, Isc is firstly determined by the absorption of the active layer. Comparing the absorptions of G0, G1 and G2 in Fig. 1, G1 and G2 absorb larger-wavelength photons, which is beneficial to Isc. But the extinction coefficients of G1 and G2 are lower than that of G0, which means G0 absorbs more photons than G1 and G2 in a film with the same thickness. Meanwhile, the low Isc of G2 is caused by the aggregated configuration in a G2–PCBM blend film. The AFM images of blend films of G0–PCBM and G2–PCBM, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), reveal a roughness with root mean square (RMS) 0.45 nm and 2.23 nm, respectively, which reveals that G0 has better film-forming properties compared with G2. The poor solubility due to the huge molecular weight of G2 may lead to the bad film-forming ability. The better photovoltaic behavior obtained with G0 as a donor should be ascribed to the synergistic effects of its enhanced absorption of incident light, high quality uniform spin-cast film.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have synthesized three conjugated dendrimers bearing electron-accepting sulfonyldibenzene groups as the cores, and TPA moieties as electron-donating dendrons, through a convergent synthetic strategy without any protection/deprotection chemistry. The dendrimers are highly soluble in common organic solvents, and could form excellent-quality optical films by spin coating. Their thermal, optical and electrical properties are manipulated by attaching different peripheral dendrons. Quantum-chemical calculations of electronic structure show that the HOMO and LUMO of G0 are highly localized on the donor and acceptor moieties, respectively. Using G0, G1 and G2 as donors and PCBM as an acceptor, bulk heterojunction solar cells with a structure of ITO–PEDOT–dendrimers:PCBM–LiF–Al were fabricated. The cell based on G0 shows a relatively high PCE of 0.34%.
Experimental
General
All chemicals, reagents, and solvents were used as received from commercial sources without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was refluxed with sodium and benzophenone, and distilled. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on an AVANCE 500 spectrometer and a Varian Mercury-300 NMR, with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the standard. The FT-IR spectra were recorded via the KBr pellet method by using a Nicolet Impact 410 FT-IR spectrophotometer. The mass spectra were recorded on a Kratos MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, and the spectra were recorded in the reflection mode with anthracene-1,8,9-triol as the matrix. The synthetic routes to the core and dendrons as well as the dendrimer are shown in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2. Dendrons and dendrimers were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR, elemental analysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopies. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrophotometer. Film thickness was recorded on a Veeco Dektak 150 Surface Profiler. AFM images were obtained using a Nanoscope IIIa Dimension 3100. The OSCs were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and metal cathode. A thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron, PVP 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, the active layer was prepared by spin coating the composite chloroform solution of dendrimer : PCBM (1 : 2, w/w) on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The cathode, a bilayer of a thin (1 nm) LiF layer covered with 100 nm Al, was thermally evaporated through a mask at a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the cell was 5 mm2. Cell characterization was performed under AM 1.5 G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 on an Oriel Xenon solar simulator. Current–voltage characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2400.
