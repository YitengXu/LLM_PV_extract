    , Accepted 29th July 2015First published on 30th July 2015AbstractIn this study we explore the substituent effects of a class of Ru(II)-based sensitizers bearing a 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine anchor, a functional pyridinyl azolate and a single thiocyanate ligand. Three sensitizers, i.e.PRT-tBu, ND-1 and ND-2, with t-butyl, 5-[4-[bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)amino]phenyl]-2-thienyl and 5-[7-[4-[bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)amino]phenyl]-4-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazolyl)]-2-thienyl substituents are designed and synthesized. Their photophysical and redox properties are probed using UV/vis absorption and cyclic voltammetry studies. The DSC cell performances (JSC, VOC and PCE) were also examined and analyzed in order to elucidate the structure–property relationships. It is notable that all sensitizers showed superior spectral responses in the region up to 830 nm, among which the PRT-tBu and ND-1 showed prolonged electron lifetimes, suppressed electron recombination and higher power conversion efficiencies (PCE) compared to the third sensitizer PRT-ND2 with a benzothiadiazolyl linker at the ancillary chelate. In particular, the optimized DSC device using the PRT-tBu sensitizer gives a JSC of 16.29 mA cm−2, a VOC of 787 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.75, corresponding to an overall PCE of 9.68% under standard global AM 1.5 solar irradiation. Its adequate performance plus simplified synthetic procedures warrant its application in larger sized DSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are considered an important research endeavor aimed at solving the future demands for clean, reusable and affordable electricity.1–4 They represent a class of multidisciplinary technology that covers a wide arena of physics, chemistry, and material science and engineering.5,6 In terms of device design, DSCs are composed of three functional compartments: (i) a light-harvesting dye deposited on a thin film of nanocrystalline TiO2 enabling injection of photoelectrons,7 (ii) an electrolyte system with a suitable redox couple (most commonly I3−/I−) for regeneration of the oxidized dye,8 and (iii) an effective counter electrode (or cathode) to complete the carrier flux.9
In the last two decades, continuous efforts have been devoted to improve all aspects of DSC sensitizers. Thus far, Ru(II)-based complexes,10–13 zinc porphyrins,14,15 and even organic dyes16–18 with push–pull charge transfer character have shown power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over double digits under simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination. Remarkably, zinc porphyrin sensitizers featuring a donor–π-bridge–acceptor structure19 and metal-free N-annulated perylene sensitizers,20 when coupled to the cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle, have both attained the highest PCEs of up to ∼13% and 12%, respectively.
Amid various developments of DSCs, Ru(II) metal complexes are probably the sensitizers that have shown the best compromise between device efficiency and stability.21 They are prepared using environmentally benign materials, and have achieved a reasonable PCE of 12.0% with the employment of N749 and organic co-sensitizers; the latter is essential for offsetting the strong competitive absorption of the I−/I3− couple of the electrolyte.22 Importantly, as shown in Scheme 1, N749 belongs to a class of Ru(II) sensitizers which employ the 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (i.e. tctpy) anchor.23 Due to the possession of three linked pyridyl units and three carboxy functional groups, this class of Ru(II) sensitizers tends to display a further red-shifted absorption onsets versus those of the 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine (i.e. dcbpy)-based sensitizers, namely: N719, Z907, C101, C106, etc. Notably, DSCs fabricated with these dcbpy-based Ru(II) sensitizers are capable of exhibiting high performances, i.e. PCEs of ∼11.1%,24 but are still inferior to tctpy-based N749 due to the higher onset for light absorption.

Furthermore, it is known that the cell performances of DSCs depend strongly on the photosensitizing ability of the sensitizers, which can be increased by introducing extended π-conjugation and/or a push–pull structure in the sensitizing molecules.25–28 In fact, similar strategies of molecular engineering have proved successful in the design of metal-free, pure organic sensitizers.16–18 In view of this, we started the preparation of three PRT-based Ru(II) sensitizers, namely: PRT-tBu, PRT-ND1 and PRT-ND2, for which the differences are located at the functional groups (R) of the pyridyl azolate ancillary. The PRT-tBu sensitizer serves as the reference, for which the t-Bu substituent can reduce dye aggregation.29–31 Hence, their absorptions are solely derived from chelates (i.e. both the tctpy and azolate ancillary) without the interference from various intermolecular interactions. In contrast, PRT-ND1 and PRT-ND2 are the functionalized sensitizers, on which the triarylamine has been employed for assembling organic push–pull dyes,32,33 while the electron deficient 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole group17,34–38 is notable for its capability to induce charge transfer transitions. Hence, we can use the differences in their absorption spectra, as well as the device efficiencies, to examine the substituent effects of this series of PRT sensitizers. The gained knowledge should be useful for further improvement of sensitizers and the associated DSC devices.
2. Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization
Three distinctive pyridyl azolate ancillaries, i.e. L1H, R = t-butyl, L2H, R = 5-[4-[bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)amino]phenyl]-2-thienyl and L3H, R = 5-[7-[4-[bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)amino]phenyl]-4-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazolyl)]-2-thienyl, were synthesized to fine-tune the UV-vis absorption spectral profile and physical and photovoltaic properties. Chelate L1H was obtained using a literature method,39 while chelates L2H and L3H were synthesized using the multi-steps protocols given in the ESI.† Syntheses of the respective Ru(II) sensitizers were next executed using the established procedures shown in Scheme 2. They consist of the sequential reaction of RuCl3·3H2O with 4,4′,4′′-triethoxycarbonyl-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine (tectpy), with 2-pyridyl azoles L1H, L2H and L3H, and finally with KSCN, giving the ethoxycarbonyl substituted Ru(II) complexes Ru1T, Ru2T and Ru3T. These products were purified by column chromatography, while hydrolysis in mixed acetone and 2 M NaOH(aq) afforded the Ru(II) sensitizers PRT-tBu, PRT-ND1 and PRT-ND2, which were collected as fine powders from the aqueous solution by adjusting to pH = 3.

Photophysical behaviors
The absorption spectra of PRT-tBu, PRT-ND1 and PRT-ND2 were recorded in DMF at a concentration of 1 × 10−5 M, and are depicted in Fig. 1, while their numerical spectral and electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. These PRT sensitizers all display a broadened, lower intensity metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption extending to ∼760 nm. In addition, the PRT-tBu, ND1 and ND2 sensitizers showed another higher energy absorption band at 518, 517 and 529 nm with sequentially increasing extinction coefficients (ε) of 0.85, 2.7 and 4.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively. Without doubt, the higher extinction coefficients for PRT-ND1 and ND2 are due to the attached organic appendages, while the most red-shifted peak maximum and the greatest extinction coefficient for ND2 are due to the electron withdrawing benzothiadiazolyl fragment.

Upon anchoring to the TiO2 surface, all three sensitizers showed slightly broadened peak profiles versus the solution spectra of each individual sample. Of particular interest is the lowest energy absorption peak, for which the onset is notably red-shifted beyond 800 nm. We attributed this to the absorption of carboxy anchors on the surface of TiO2, for which the higher Lewis acidity of the Ti4+ metal center is expected to exert greater stabilization towards the π*-orbital of the tctpy chelate and, hence, induce the further red-shift of the MLCT absorption band. Notably, the deposition of ethoxycarbonyl Ru(II) intermediates Ru1T, Ru2T and Ru3T on the TiO2 thin film has failed to induce any notable red-shift of the lowest energy MLCT band, which served as unambiguous evidence for this deduction. On the other hand, this observation is in contrast to the blue-shifting of absorption for the related Ru(II) sensitizers upon dilution or increase of pH by basification in solution.40,41 Proton dissociation from carboxyl anchors progressively destabilizes the π*-orbital of polypyridine and, hence, increases the energy gap of the MLCT transitions.
Theoretical examination
Molecular orbital calculations of the Ru(II) sensitizers were next investigated using the B3LYP/6-31G* package to gain understanding about their photophysical performances. Fig. 2 presents the isodensity plots of four frontier molecular orbitals, HOMO−1 ∼ LUMO+1. The HOMO−1 and HOMO of PRT-tBu are mainly populated over the Ru(II) metal dπ orbitals, thiocyanate and pyrazolate fragments, while both the HOMO−1 of PRT-ND1 and ND2 have similar character versus the HOMO of PRT-tBu, but their HOMOs showed significant contribution from the attached organic appendage that has the electron donating triphenylamine fragment. This observation highlights the advantage of this strategy for designing DSC sensitizers using an electron donating substituent. On the other hand, as for all sensitizers, the LUMO is solely delocalized over the unique tctpy chelate, which is consistent with the observation of the lowest energy MLCT transition located in the longer wavelength region, i.e. 679–688 nm. Furthermore, the LUMO+1 of PRT-ND2 is found to be significantly different from that of both PRT-tBu and ND1, showing a large contribution from the organic appendage, meaning that the electron deficient benzothiadiazolyl fragment of PRT-ND2 may serve as the sink to retard the electron injection to the TiO2 electrode (vide infra).

Nevertheless, this theoretical analysis indicates that HOMO–LUMO excitation is fully capable of moving the electron density from the Ru(II) metal center, thiocyanate and pyridyl pyrazolate ancillary to the tctpy anchor. Hence, the photoinduced electron transfer from the Ru(II) sensitizers to the TiO2 electrode can occur facilely upon HOMO → LUMO excitation.
Electrochemical properties
The ground and excited-state oxidation potentials (E0′ and E0′*) of these PRT sensitizers are next estimated using cyclic voltammetry and spectroscopic measurements. As shown in Table 1, all of the ground-state oxidation potentials 0.93–0.95 V (vs. NHE) are more positive than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (ca. 0.4 V vs. NHE), despite various organic appendages being attached at the ancillary chelate. This observation confirms the existence of an adequate driving force for dye regeneration.42–44 Moreover, the excited-state oxidation potentials of −0.85 to −0.87 V, which were estimated from the difference between E0′ and the optical band gap (i.e. at 5% intensity of the lowest energy absorption), are also notably more negative than the CB potential (ca. −0.5 V vs. NHE) of nanocrystalline TiO2, confirming the occurrence of effective electron injection.
Device performance characteristics
Sensitizers PRT-tBu, ND1 and ND2 were next employed in the fabrication of DSCs. Three distinctive anodes, consisting of 5, 10 and 15 μm of a 20 nm TiO2 layer plus a 5 μm thick of scattering layer with 400 nm TiO2 particles, were deposited using the screen-printing technique. The dye solution contained 0.3 mM of each sensitizer in mixed ethanol and t-butanol (v/v, 1:1), along with 0.6 mM of tetra-butylammonium deoxycholate [TBA][DOC] and 1 mM deoxycholic acid (DCA) as co-adsorbate. The counter electrodes were prepared from FTO glass (7 Ω/TEC7, 2.2 mm thick, Pilkington) with treatment by PVP capped platinum nanoclusters (PVP–Pt) via a so-called “two-step dip-coating” process, followed by post heating at 325 °C for 10 min.45 The cells were assembled using a hot-melt Surlyn film (Meltonix 1170–25, 25 mm, Solaronix), and heated at 130 °C. The electrolyte was prepared using 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS), and 0.5 M t-butylpyridine (tBP) in acetonitrile. It was then injected into the cell through a pre-drilled hole at the counter electrode.
The respective device parameters are listed in Table 2, in which all reported data are averages taken from three distinctive cells, with the estimated standard deviations (esd) shown in parentheses. As expected, PRT-tBu showed the highest degree of dye loading for a 5 + 5 μm TiO2 thickness as it has the smallest molecular volume among the three sensitizers. The overall loading increases with increasing TiO2 thickness, but the ratio is far less than the expected increase of thickness. This means that the sensitizers would be less efficient in penetrating into the void of the thicker TiO2 layer. Eventually, these sensitizers showed a dye loading of 2.37–1.63 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for a DSC with a 15 + 5 μm TiO2 layer.

As for the device efficiencies, PRT-ND1 showed the highest short circuit current (JSC) and the highest PCE of 8.39% for cells with a 5 + 5 μm TiO2 thickness. Its higher absorptivity induced by the donor appendage and the π-linker is beneficial for the light harvesting. This observation is consistent with the literature report that the addition of a triphenylamine appendage to bpy-based Ru(II) sensitizers gave new sensitizers, i.e. KW1 and KW2, that displayed a 20% increase in PCE versus the reference compound Z907.46 Apparently, the increased absorptivity is responsible for the improved short circuit current, as well as the overall device efficiency. On the other hand, PRT-ND2, which has an equally intensive peak absorptivity, produces the lowest PCE of 7.09%. This contrast must be caused by the electron accepting benzothiadiazolyl fragment, and implicated that intense absorption cannot guarantee a higher conversion efficiency. Moreover, upon further increase of the TiO2 layer thickness to 10 + 5 μm and finally to 15 + 5 μm, due to improved light harvesting, both the PRT-tBu and PRT-ND1 sensitizers showed increased PCEs of 9.68% and 9.48%, versus an inferior PCE of 8.31% for PRT-ND2 under identical conditions. For comparison, the commercial Z907 sensitizer exhibited a PCE of 9.06% for cells with 15 + 5 μm TiO2 and optimized electrolyte, and this PCE is identical to the best PCE of 9.05% reported for DSCs with 10 + 5 μm TiO2 and the same kind of electrolyte solution.47
The IPCEs of the as-fabricated cells are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c), for which the action spectra can be separated into two sections according to the absorption wavelengths. For the DSCs with 5 + 5 μm TiO2 and with either PRT-tBu or ND1, the IPCE action spectra started at ∼830 nm and rapidly increased to 55% at 750 nm and remained unchanged in the region up to 620 nm. Then, the IPCEs increased to ∼70% at 550 nm, showing better light harvesting upon moving to shorter wavelength, which reflects the higher absorptivity of the sensitizers in this region. In contrast, the IPCE of PRT-ND2 only goes up to ∼50% at 730 nm, increases to a maximum of 64% at 610 nm and drops slightly to ∼60% at shorter wavelength, displaying a consistently lower IPCE versusPRT-tBu and ND1 over most of the regions.
 Fig. 3  Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) action spectra, integrated current density, I–V characteristics of DSCs with different TiO2 thicknesses of 5 + 5, 10 + 5 and 15 + 5 μm and with sensitizers PRT-tBu, ND1 and ND2. 
Upon increasing the TiO2 thickness to 15 + 5 μm, the IPCE of all devices showed a notable improvement from ∼55% to ∼70% in the longer wavelength region. This observation could be understood in terms of the better light harvesting caused by the increased dye loading. Moreover, the IPCEs of PRT-ND2 are consistently lower than those recorded for PRT-tBu and ND1 in all regions, showing the deteriorating effect of the electron deficient benzothiadiazolyl unit of the ancillary chelate versus the pure electron donating t-butyl and thienyl fragments.
The calculated JSC was obtained by integration of the IPCE response for all DSC devices. The graphical representations are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c), while numerical data are summarized in Table 2 to provide an intimate comparison with the experimental values. As can be seen, for most DSC cells, the integrated JSC values are slightly larger than the experimental data, with the difference being attributed to the shadow mask installed in the cells. Hence, both the total incident light and the JSC data will be slightly reduced.
The corresponding I–V characteristics are depicted in Fig. 3(d)–(f). As can be seen, the PRT-tBu and ND1 sensitized solar cells gave JSC = 13.04 and 14.24 mA cm−2 and VOC = 806 and 803 mV, respectively, for DSCs with 5 + 5 μm TiO2. Upon increasing the thickness to 15 + 5 μm, the DSCs revealed significantly improved current densities of 16.29 and 16.32 mA cm−2 and slightly lowered photovoltages of 787 and 777 mV, which are consistent with better light harvesting and a slightly reduced photovoltage; the latter is caused by the deteriorated coverage of the sensitizer that leads to faster electron recombination.29 Furthermore, for PRT-ND2, both the JSC and VOC of the fabricated devices are systematically lower than those of the PRT-tBu and ND1 devices. These observations are in sharp contrast with the increased efficiency observed for both organic D-A-D sensitizers48–50 and zinc porphyrin sensitizers51,52 with the benzothiadiazolyl unit located near the carboxy anchor. Hence, its existence could not only increase the light harvesting, but also the electron injection into the TiO2 acceptor. This situation is unlike the case of the benzothiadiazolyl unit in PRT-ND2, which is expected to induce an opposite transition dipole in the excited states and will deteriorate the electron injection into the TiO2 electrode.
Photophysical measurements of DSC devices
Charge extraction (CE) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements were employed to study the variation of the quasi-Fermi level of the TiO2 electrode,53 and differences in electron lifetimes in response to the electron recombination reaction.54 These data are of value for gauging the conducting band edge (CB) of the TiO2 electrode,55 and the interfacial energetic and dynamic origins of the VOC variation.56,57

Fig. 4(a) shows the extracted charge density at various recorded VOC's for DSC devices fabricated using the sensitizers PRT-tBu, PRT-ND1, and PRT-ND2. It appears that, for the same amount of extracted charge density, the VOC values obtained from the three dyes follow the trend PRT-tBu > PRT-ND1 > PRT-ND2. This variation in the VOC value can be explained qualitatively by a shift in the conduction band edge (ECB). Hence, the results of the CE experiment indicated that the TiO2 conduction band potential showed an upward shift in the order PRT-ND2 < PRT-ND1 < PRT-tBu, consistent with the variation of their VOC's.
 Fig. 4  (a) TiO2 electron density versus voltage deduced from CE measurements and (b) electron lifetime versus TiO2 electron density deduced from IMVS measurements for DSC devices containing PRT-tBu and ND1 and ND2. The cell voltage is controlled by tuning the illumination from a halogen lamp. 

Fig. 4(b) shows a plot of the recombination lifetime versus VOC for the studied devices, as measured by IMVS experiments. It is notable that at any given VOC, the PRT-tBu sensitizer showed the longest lifetime versus all other sensitizers. This result indicated that the charge recombination was the slowest for PRT-tBu, followed by PRT-ND1, while PRT-ND2 had the fastest recombination. Apparently, the electron deficient 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole unit, although it is not located in the close vicinity of the TiO2 surface, as shown in the recently reported zinc porphyrin sensitizers,51,52 still showed a substantial increase in charge recombination, causing a shorter electron lifetime and lower VOC than those of the other sensitizers. Overall, these combined results indicated that different donors in this class of Ru(II) sensitizers would substantially influence both the CB edge of TiO2 and the charge recombination at the same time.
Stability measurements and fabrication of large sized modules
For evaluation of the long-term stability of the as-fabricated DSCs, the electrolyte was switched to a mixture of 1 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.1 M sodium iodide, 0.15 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS), and 0.5 M N-butyl benzimidazole (NBB) dissolved in butyronitrile.58 The performance evolution of all three DSC cells is summarized in Fig. 5. Over the entire period of 1000 h at 60 °C under accelerated visible-light soaking, the photovoltaic parameters JSC, VOC, and FF of PRT-tBu and ND1-based cells showed consistently higher values versus those of the PRT-ND2 cells, despite the random fluctuation of the performance parameters. Of particular interest is the data recorded for PRT-tBu, for which the final PCE of 9.01%, is almost identical to its maxima PCE of 9.27% recorded after only 300 h. This excellent stability indicates the advantage of PRT-tBu for fabrication of both thermally stable and larger sized solar cell modules.

As shown in Fig. 6, the larger sized DSC cell consists of four parallel TiO2 strips, each with 15 + 5 μm of the absorbing (20 nm) plus light scattering (400 nm) TiO2 layer and with an active area of 4 × 0.98 × 5.7 cm2 (e.g. 22.3 cm2). The cell was fabricated using the routine assembly protocol established for the aforementioned small sized DSCs, except that a grid of silver wires was printed on the TiO2 photoanode and the counter electrode using commercial silver paste to better collect the photocurrent. The grid on the counter electrode was next covered by glass cement to protect against corrosion induced by the electrolyte and, next, the cell was carefully assembled using Surlyn for ensuring good insulation around the silver grid. This type of DSC cell with the PRT-tBu sensitizer shows a JSC of 16.25 mA cm−2, a VOC of 690 mV, and an FF of 0.57 under the standard AM 1.5 G solar irradiation and without a shadow mask. It is notable that both the observed JSC and VOC are similar to those of the smaller sized DSCs, while the large decrease in FF is due to the inefficient collection of photocurrent at the electrodes and the increased diffusion resistivity of the redox electrolyte. An active-area PCE of 6.32% can be calculated using this set of data. However, the calculated PCE drops to 5.96% upon using a shadow mask with an aperture area of 4.8 × 5.92 (or 28.4) cm2, for which the non-active area of ∼21% (i.e. 28.4 − 22.3 = 6.1 cm2) is attributed to the area required to apply Surlyn that glues together the front and back panels. As a reference, a similar large-sized DSC cell based on the commercial Z907 sensitizer was also fabricated using identical architecture and the corresponding optimized electrolyte system. The obtained device characteristics, i.e. JSC of 13.28 mA cm−2, VOC of 740 mV, FF of 0.50 and overall PCE of 4.91%, are significant lower, which unambiguously assures the superiority of our current design of sensitizer.

3. Conclusion
Three 4,4′,4′′-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine-based Ru(II) sensitizers, i.e.PRT-tBu, ND-1 an ND-2, with t-butyl, 5-[4-[bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)amino]phenyl]-2-thienyl and 5-[7-[4-[bis(4-hexyloxyphenyl)amino]phenyl]-4-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazolyl)]-2-thienyl substituents on the pyridyl azolate ancillary are synthesized and tested for the fabrication of DSC devices. Disregarding the lower absorptivity of PRT-tBuversus the functionalized PRT-ND1 and ND2, the sensitizers PRT-tBu and ND1 displayed comparable PCEs (9.68 and 9.48%), and both were superior to the third sensitizer PRT-ND2 (PCE = 8.31%) which possessed an electron withdrawing benzothiadiazolyl bridge to induce the occurrence of charge transfer absorption. However, as shown by the CE and IMVS measurements, this benzothiadiazolyl group unfortunately induces a downward shift of the CB edge of TiO2 and relatively increased electron recombination, giving systematically inferior device efficiencies. Moreover, due to an ample supply of its ancillary chelate, PRT-tBu was obtained in larger quantity to allow the fabrication of larger-sized DSC devices and modules. The enlarged device has an active-area of 22.3 cm2 and displays performances: JSC = 13.01 mA cm−2, VOC = 680 mV, FF = 0.57 and active-area PCE = 5.96%. Hence, the gained experience should be of value to the future design of larger sized commercial DSCs and modules.
4. Experimental section
General procedures
All reactions were performed under nitrogen and were monitored by TLC with pre-coated silica gel plates (Merck, 0.20 mm with UV254 indicator). Column chromatography was carried out using silica gel obtained from Merck (230–400 mesh). Mass spectra were obtained on a JEOL SX-102A instrument. 1H and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury-400 instrument. Elemental analysis was carried out using a Heraeus CHN–O Rapid Elementary Analyzer. Photophysical data were obtained using an Edinburgh Fluorescence spectrometer FLS928P.
Synthesis of ethoxycarbonyl derivatives Ru1T–Ru3T
Synthetic procedures are similar to those employed for the other PRT series of sensitizers.59,60 A solution of (tectpy)RuCl3 (723 mg, 1.1 mmol), L1H (269 mg, 1.0 mmol) and KOAc (196 mg, 2.0 mmol) in toluene was heated under reflux for 4 h. After cooling to RT, the solvent was removed and the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2, washed with water, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated to dryness. The crude product was purified using column chromatography to give Ru1Cl as a black solid (570 mg, 67%). The other Ru(II) complexes Ru2Cl (400 mg, 73%) and Ru3Cl (103 mg, 60%) were synthesized using chelates L2H and L3H under similar conditions.
Next, a DMF solution of Ru1Cl (415 mg, 0.46 mmol) and KSCN (236 mg, 2.43 mg) was heated under reflux overnight. After cooling to RT, the solvent was removed and the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2. This solution was extracted with water, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated to dryness. The obtained product was purified using column chromatography to give compound Ru1T as a black solid (300 mg, 70%). Complexes Ru2T (125 mg, 57%) and Ru3T (102 mg, 60%) were synthesized in a similar manner.

Synthesis of PRT-tBu, PRT-ND1 and PRT-ND2
To an acetone (150 mL) solution of Ru1T (193 mg, 0.22 mmol) was added an aqueous solution of NaOH (2 M, 10 mL). The mixture was stirred at RT overnight. It was then concentrated to approx. 30 mL and the pH was adjusted to 3 by the addition of 2 M HCl solution. The precipitate was collected, and washed with water, acetone and ether in sequence to obtain PRT-tBu as a brown solid (162 mg, 93%). Sensitizers PRT-ND1 (72 mg, 66%) and PRT-ND2 (102 mg, 69%) were synthesized in a similar manner.

Device fabrication
Pre-cleaned FTO glasses (4 mm thickness, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Japan) were immersed in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by washing with water and ethanol. They were then deposited with 5, 10, 15 μm of 20 nm TiO2 particles, followed by a 5 μm scattering layer containing 400 nm TiO2 particles (PST-400, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals, Japan). The TiO2 electrodes were heated in air at 325 °C for 30 min, followed by heating at 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 30 min. They were next treated with 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, followed by heating at 500 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, these TiO2 films were immersed in a dye solution for 18 h at 25 °C, and were prepared using absolute ethanol and t-butanol (v/v, 1:1).
