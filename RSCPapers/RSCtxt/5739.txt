    , Accepted 15th May 2015First published on 18th May 2015AbstractWe report the design and characteristics of a novel CdSe quantum dot sensitized SrTiO3 as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting with strong absorption in the UV and visible light regions up to 607 nm and an enhanced photocatalytic water splitting activity. Our results demonstrate an increase of photocurrent density with a decrease of the band gap of CdSe QDs for the sensitized SrTiO3 electrodes. Combinations of CdSe QDs of different band gaps produce a current density of up to ∼5 mA cm−2 at 0 V and ∼18 mA cm−2 at 0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In comparison to the bare SrTiO3 electrode, a two-time increase in the current density is noted for the CdSe QD sensitized SrTiO3 electrodes at 0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Our results demonstrate for the first time the use of SrTiO3 perovskite sensitized with tuned band gap CdSe QD heterostructures as a photoelectrocatalyst for enhanced solar water splitting.
Introduction
Improvements in solar light harvesting using efficient energy conversion materials are quite essential to solve global energy problems. In this regard, the photocatalytic water splitting reaction to produce hydrogen is one of the promising processes, owing to the benefit of hydrogen as an eco-friendly and renewable energy source.1,2 Since the first photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) for solar water splitting was reported in 1972 by Fujishima and Honda,3 numerous research efforts have been made to develop efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen production. Mostly, noble metals (Pt and Rh) and semiconductor metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO, WO3, and SnO2) were investigated as electro- and photocatalysts in water electrolysis.4–7 However, noble metals are expensive and metal oxide semiconductors have a lower absorption of visible light and also the conduction band (CB) is not as negative as that required for H2 evolution that limits the photoelectrochemical splitting of water. As the solar spectrum consists of almost 50% visible light (400 < λ < 800 nm), to achieve higher photocatalytic water splitting efficiency, quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as promising candidates as they have comparatively high absorption coefficients in visible light.8 QD sensitized semiconductors have also been developed as photoelectrocatalyst materials in which narrow band gap QDs are linked either chemically or physically onto the surface of wide band gap host semiconducting materials.9–12 Among the reported QDs of metal chalcogenide photocatalysts, CdSe has been proven to be a good candidate because of its excellent water splitting properties due to its tunable band gap of 1.8 to 3.0 eV that matches well with the spectrum of sunlight; it has a high absorption cross-section and can move the conduction band edge of semiconductors more negative, so as to improve the possibilities to favour H2O/H2 redox reactions.13,14 In this regard, several heterostructures have been developed using CdSe QDs such as CdSe/TiO2,15 CdSe/CdS/ZnO,16 CdSe/CdS/TiO2,17 CdS/CdSe/ZnO,18 CdSe/ZnS/ZnO,19 CdS/CdSe/ZnO/TiO2,20 and CdSe/SiNWs,21 emphasizing the role of band gap alignment in efficient water splitting.
In recent years, ternary perovskite structured strontium titanate (SrTiO3 and STO) has been identified as one of the most suitable materials in energy conversion devices due to its unique electronic band structure and unidirectional charge transfer properties. The more negative conduction band (CB) edge of STO provides overall water splitting.22,23 However, due to its wide band gap (3.4 eV), STO absorbs only the UV region of the solar spectrum (i.e. ∼4%), resulting in low H2 gas evolution efficiency.24 To enhance visible light absorption, the STO band gap is also tuned by doping various noble metals like Pt, Rh, Ru, and Ir and transition metals like Cr and Mn, which extends the absorbance window to a certain extent in the visible range.25 Alternatively, there are very few reports on heterostructure based STO photoanodes for solar water splitting. Townsend et al. reported that NiO–STO photoelectrodes generated photocurrents of 10 μA cm−2 and 28 μmol H2 g−1 h−1 in KCl electrolyte.26 The authors also proposed that the bulk STO activity was found to be higher than the nanosized STO activity due to a quantum size effect. Wang et al. reported a photocurrent density of 0.5 mA cm−2 using carbon QD sensitized STO. The low currents produced were due to the limitation that carbon QD sensitized STO absorbs solar light in the UV and IR regions only.27 In this aspect, it would be interesting to investigate the photoelectrochemical water splitting behaviour of STO heterostructures utilizing low band gap semiconductor QDs that absorb light in the visible region.
The present work describes the preparation of an efficient photoelectrode comprising of STO sensitized with CdSe quantum dots. The band gap tuned CdSe quantum dots absorb most of the visible light and transfer the photo-generated electrons to STO, which is involved in the water splitting mechanism. The tuned band gap CdSe QD sensitized STO electrodes produced a photocurrent of 1 mA cm−2 at 0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Due to the improved photocurrent density and the synergetic effect of various sized CdSe QDs, our photoanodes showed substantially enhanced water splitting efficiency. To our knowledge, CdSe QD sensitized STO heterostructures as photoelectrodes for solar water splitting have not been explored.
Experimental
Synthesis of SrTiO3
SrTiO3 was synthesized via a hydrothermal route. Ten mmol of each sarcosine hydrochloride (99%, Alfa Aesar) and lithium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide (TFSI) (98+%, Alfa Aesar) were dissolved separately in 10 mL of de-ionised water, and mixed together under stirring at room temperature for 30 min. A clear, transparent lithiated sarcosine solution was obtained. Further, an equimolar amount (0.65 M) of Sr(OH)2·6H2O and TiCl4 were separately dissolved in 10 mL of ionic solution and mixed together. Then, 10 M NaOH solution was added to the above mixture and continuously stirred for 30 min. The above solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, maintained at 170 °C for 16 h and then cooled to room temperature. The obtained product was washed several times using de-ionised water by centrifugation and finally dried at 80 °C in air for 5 h. The obtained product was calcinated at 800 °C for 24 h.
Synthesis of CdSe QDs
Various sized CdSe QDs were synthesized by following our previous reported work.28 Cadmium oxide (CdO, 99%), 1-hexadecylamine (HDA, 99%), tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP, 90%), tri-n-octylphosphineoxide (TOPO, 99%), oleic acid and selenium powder (Se, 99.99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. In a typical synthesis using a three-neck flask, 0.2 mmol of CdO and 0.5 g of oleic acid (OA) were heated to 180 °C until the mixture became clear and then cooled down to room temperature. Three mL of HDA and 6 mL of TOPO were added to the mixture and degassed again at 100 °C for 15 minutes. The mixture was then heated to 280 °C under vigorous stirring and 1 mL of 1 M TOPSe was swiftly injected. The temperature was lowered to 260 °C for nanocrystal growth. To obtain the desired green, yellow and red fluorescent QDs, the reaction solution was suddenly cooled to room temperature for 1 min, 2 min and 4 min, respectively, by placing a water bath below the flask. Then the QDs were washed with the toluene/methanol solvent by centrifugation at 3000 rpm and then stored in toluene. In order to exchange the OA with MPA, 1 mL of the toluene solution containing 50 mg of OA capped CdSe were mixed with 1 mL of acetone and 1 mL of MPA. The resulting precipitate containing MPA capped CdSe QDs was dissolved and stored in de-ionized water.
Sensitization of CdSe QDs on SrTiO3
Ten mg of MPA capped CdSe in de-ionised water was mixed with 20 mg of SrTiO3 powder (1:2 weight ratios) and continuously stirred for 4 h. The linking mechanism is shown in Scheme S1 (see the ESI†), which is supported by FTIR data (Fig. S1, see the ESI†). For the mixed QD system, a 1:1 wt ratio i.e. 5 mg from each of the two types of QDs were mixed together and then added to 20 mg of SrTiO3 powder so as to maintain the 1:2 weight ratio with SrTiO3. The final product was washed using ethanol and collected as CdSe QD sensitized SrTiO3 (CdSe QDs/STO). All photoelectrodes were prepared on indium tin oxide coated glass films by a simple squeegee method for photoelectrochemical studies.29
Structural and optical characterization
The chemical bonding between QD and STO through MPA was studied by using Infra-red spectroscopy (Brucker-Tensor 27, 400–2000 cm−1). The phase and crystallinity of SrTiO3 and CdSe QDs were analysed using X-ray diffraction (Bruker-Advanced D8, 2θ range of 20–70°). Optical characterization was carried out using UV-Vis Spectroscopy (Speccord 200 Plus, 200–800 nm). Morphological analysis was performed using Transition Electron Microscopy (TEM, Technai G2 20). The photoelectrochemical water splitting performance was recorded using a typical three electrode potentiostat system (Bio-Logic, Model: VMP3 and EC-Lab software, version 10.31) with a Pt counter electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode and photocatalyst material coated ITO plate as the working electrode (with 1 cm2 exposure area). The exposure area of the working electrode was illuminated with a solar-simulated light source (power intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a 300 W Xe lamp passing through an AM 1.5 G filter Model-SS80AA). Linear sweep voltammograms were obtained at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The electrolyte used was an aqueous solution of 1 M Na2S (pH = 13), which is a sacrificial electrolyte that inhibits the photocorrosion of CdSe QDs. The electrolyte was bubbled with nitrogen stream before the commencement of photoelectrochemical studies. The incident photoelectric conversion efficiency was measured using an IPCE measurement kit, where a monochromator (300 W Xe lamp) was used to obtain monochromatic light. The IPCE was defined as the following equation:IPCE (%) = {(1240 × Iph))/(λ (nm) × Jlight)} × 100where, Iph is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), λ is the wavelength (nm) of incident light and Jlight is the incident light power density (mW cm−2). The amount of hydrogen evolved was determined using a gas chromatograph (CP-4900 Micro-GC). Argon gas was purged through the reaction cell for 30 min before the reaction to remove air. The experiments were conducted in 1 M Na2S electrolyte with zero bias voltage.
Results and discussion
We synthesized both STO and CdSe QDs, and explored their optical and photocatalytic characteristics. Fig. 1a is a digital image of the CdSe QDs fluorescing under UV illumination and exhibiting green, yellow and red colouration. The three different colours essentially resulted from particle size differences in the CdSe QDs. Fig. 1b presents the absorption spectra of the above CdSe QDs. Particle sizes of the CdSe QDs were determined as 2.2, 3.4 and 4.2 nm from the absorbance peaks noticed at 503, 560 and 607 nm, respectively. The relationship between the maximum in the 1Se–1Sh transition position (λAbs,max) and the CdSe nanoparticle size and the extinction coefficient is taken from the work of Peng et al.30 The band gaps were calculated from the first excitonic peak (Fig. 1b) and found to be 2.5, 2.2 and 2.0 eV for G-, Y-, and R-CdSe QDs, respectively. The photoluminescence spectra of the CdSe QDs (Fig. 1c) indicate the highly luminescent QDs originating from band edge emissions.

It is important for a photoanode to have maximum light absorption ranging from the blue to red region of the solar spectrum for efficient water splitting. In this regard, CdSe QDs such as green (G), yellow (Y) and red (R), either individually or in combination (GR and YR), were sensitized on STO and their absorption behaviour was studied. Fig. 2 depicts the absorption spectra of bare STO and CdSe QD-sensitized STO in the UV and visible regions, respectively. The spectrum of bare STO reveals absorption only in the UV region (358 nm) corresponding to a band gap of 3.46 eV (see the ESI, Fig. S3†). With CdSe sensitization, absorption peaks are noted in both UV as well as the respective visible regions. Further, as shown in Fig. 2, the combination GR-STO shows high absorption in green (530 nm) as well as red (610 nm) regions. Similarly, YR-STO shows absorbance in both yellow (570 nm) and red (610 nm) regions.

The XRD spectra of bare R-CdSe, STO and CdSe-sensitized STO are shown in Fig. 3a–c, respectively. The representative spectrum of R-CdSe QDs exhibits three major peaks corresponding to the (111), (220) and (311) planes, confirming the cubic phase (JCPDS #19-0191). The broadened peaks for all the planes indicate the nanostructure of the CdSe QDs. The crystallite size of the red QD calculated from the (111) plane by using the Debye–Scherrer equation is ∼4.7 nm corresponding to the d-spacing value of 3.53 Å. The diffraction peaks of STO (Fig. 3b) are identical to the cubic phase (JCPDS #79-0176), while the crystallite size calculated from the (110) plane of STO is ∼53.3 nm corresponding to the d-spacing value of 2.75 Å. The XRD spectrum in Fig. 3c of CdSe sensitized STO shows the major peaks corresponding to both STO and CdSe QDs. The peaks corresponding to CdSe QDs and STO are marked as * and #, respectively. As the STO peak intensities are very high, a zoomed spectrum is given (Fig. 3c), which clearly demonstrates the presence of broadened CdSe peaks along with the STO peaks.

The HRTEM images of bare CdSe (Fig. 4a–c) clearly indicate that the CdSe QDs are highly crystalline in nature, showing well defined lattice fringes. The particle size estimated is 2.2, 3.5 and 4.3 nm for G, Y and R-CdSe QDs, respectively, which corroborates with the particle size calculation from UV absorbance data. The TEM image of STO (Fig. 4d) shows that the STO is highly crystalline and has a cubic shaped morphology. The size was found to be between 70 and 110 nm, with an average of 85 ± 15 nm. The porosity of the particles is internal rather than surface active sites, which is explained in our earlier work.31 The internal porosity formed is due to the insufficient diffusion of Sr ions into the already formed TiO2 crystallites. The TEM images of R-CdSe QD sensitized STO are shown in Fig. 4e & f. From the figure, the attachment of R-CdSe QDs on the surface of STO is evidenced by the increase in the surface roughness. The SAED pattern of bare R-CdSe in Fig. 4g shows bright circles that correspond to (111), (220) and (311) planes, indicating the polycrystalline nature of the R-CdSe QDs. Fig. 4h shows the SAED pattern of pristine STO, confirming its single crystalline nature. The SAED pattern of CdSe-sensitized STO (Fig. 4i) shows rings for the CdSe as well as dots for the STO, thus confirming the presence of both materials. Surface morphological features (FESEM images) of the electrodes are also supported by the presence of QDs on the STO surface (Fig. S2, see the ESI†).

When the CdSe–STO photoanode is irradiated by UV-visible light, both CdSe and STO are excited and the generated electrons in CdSe are transferred to the CB of STO, and then further transferred to the Pt foil (counter electrode) where protons are reduced and H2 generation occurs. Simultaneously, the holes move to the photoanode/electrolyte interface and are collected by the hole scavengers (S2−). Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out with bare QDs, bare STO and CdSe–STO, and the effect of sensitization was examined towards photoresponse in water splitting. The prepared photoanodes (G-STO, Y-STO, R-STO, GR-STO and YR-STO) were used as working electrodes in an aqueous solution of 1 M Na2S. Linear sweep voltammograms (I–V curves) were recorded on various photoanodes under dark and illuminated conditions with a constant light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 5a illustrates the action spectra of bare QDs where a maximum photocurrent density of ∼3.9 mA cm−2 was obtained for red QDs at 0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Fig. 5b shows the set of LSVs recorded for the bare STO and CdSe QD sensitized STO photoanodes. Bare STO showed current densities of 0.5 mA cm−2 and 0.8 mA cm−2 under dark and illuminated conditions, respectively, at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, pointing to a photocurrent density of 0.3 mA cm−2. More significantly, sensitization with CdSe QDs (various band gaps) resulted in substantially enhanced photocurrent density as compared to bare STO photoanodes. The maximum photocurrent density recorded in this work was ∼1 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for the sample YR-STO. This is about three times higher than that of the bare STO sample. According to Townsend et al.,26 the bulk STO particles are observed to be beneficial for water splitting application, hence our synthesized 85 ± 15 nm STO particles are also shown to possess higher photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. Further, the photocurrent of CdSe QD sensitized STO is substantially enhanced due to the increase in the visible light absorption range. In this study, the generated photocurrents were considerably higher than those already reported in the literature for STO based photoelectrodes for water splitting.26,27Fig. 5c shows the extended LSV data recorded for the bare STO and various band gap CdSe QD sensitized STO photoanodes up to 0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl (∼1.7 V vs. RHE). A maximum current density of ∼18 mA cm−2 was obtained for the YR-STO photoanode, nearly two times higher than that of bare STO under illumination.

The effectiveness of CdSe QDs as a co-catalyst with STO in photoelectrochemical water splitting was assessed by IPCE measurements as a function of the wavelength (Fig. 5d). The IPCE spectra of STO and QDs–STO are in good agreement with the corresponding UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2). The single band gap QD sensitized STO photoanodes (G-STO (15.2%), Y-STO (8.3%) and R-STO (20.3%)) exhibited a significantly higher IPCE at different wavelengths (510 nm, 540 nm and 590 nm, respectively) than that of bare STO (8.8%) at 360 nm. This indicates that the IPCE response of QDs–STO reflects the synergy arising from the excited interaction between CdSe and STO. Interestingly, when two different band gap QD sensitized STO photoanodes (GR-STO (26.2%) and YR-STO (30.5%)) were used, high IPCE values can be achieved in the wavelength ranges of 540–620 nm and 580–640 nm, respectively. This result indicates that the number of excited electrons can increase compared to those in single band gap CdSe QD and effectively injected into STO and thus can be collected by the electrode.
From Fig. 5 it can be clearly observed that the photocurrent density follows a trend as shown below:Bare STO < G-STO < Y-STO < R-STO < GR-STO < YR-STOwhere the photocurrent increased when the band gap of the CdSe decreased from 2.5 eV to 2.0 eV, in other words from green to red. This may be due to the reason that a decrease in the band gap of the QDs also results in a lowering of the distance between the CB of the CdSe QDs and STO. This can facilitate higher electron transfer rate from the CdSe QDs to STO and consequently enhance the efficiency. This demonstrates that the absorption of solar light can be maximized by tuning the band gap of the CdSe QDs and also by mixing QDs of various band gaps. Our results also clearly exemplify the unique advantage in employing varied band gaps of CdSe QDs for sensitization on perovskite STO photoanodes, resulting in enhanced photocurrents and enhanced efficiency in water splitting.

Fig. 6 shows the reaction time dependent photoelectrocatalytic H2 evolution plots of different samples in 1 M sacrificial electrolyte (Na2S) under solar light irradiation with an applied potential of 0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl.32,33 All photoanodes exhibited a steady performance for an experimental period of 4 h (see the ESI for i–t curves, Fig S4†). In comparison to the bare STO (41 μmol g−1), all co-catalyst (QDs) sensitized STO photoanodes exhibit higher H2 evolution due to the visible light absorption of the co-catalyst. Among them, more than 100 μmol g−1 of H2 was evolved for mixed QD sensitized STO (YR-STO – 120.9 μmol g−1 and GR-STO – 112.3 μmol g−1) in a prolonged experiment (4 h). The single QD sensitized STO also exhibited enhanced H2 evolution, which exceeded 50 μmol g−1 (G-STO – 57.3.g−1 μmol, Y-STO – 78.7 μmol g−1 and R-STO – 89.9 μmol g−1).

Conclusions
We have reported a CdSe QD sensitized STO photoelectrocatalyst material with an enhanced water splitting performance. A significantly high photocurrent density of ∼1 mA cm−2 was drawn from the CdSe/STO photoelectrocatalyst in a sacrificial 1 M Na2S aqueous solution at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The highest current density of 18 mA cm−2 was obtained at 0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl for mixed band gap QD sensitized STO anodes. This work has demonstrated the advantages of tuned band gap CdSe QD sensitization on STO towards water splitting. This protocol may be further optimized to achieve higher IPCE. We expect that our new approach for the fabrication of CdSe/STO will be applicable to the synthesis of various novel heterostructures using various QDs for high efficiency perovskite solar energy conversion and hydrogen generation devices.
