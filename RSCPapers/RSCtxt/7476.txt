Broader context
Presently, a major energy source is still based on limiting fossil fuels and nuclear power which are environmentally harmful. Increasing efforts have been paid in finding suitable environmentally friendly and renewable replacements. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) that can be fabricated by solution processing techniques are under intense investigation in both academic institutions and industrial companies because of their potential to enable mass production of flexible and cost-effective alternatives to silicon-based solar cells. A combination of novel polymer development, nanoscale morphology control and processing optimization has led to over 8% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for BHJ PSCs with a conventional device structure. Attempts to develop PSCs with an inverted device structure as required for achieving high PECs and good stability have, however, met with limited success. Here, we report that a high PCE of 8.4% under AM 1.5G irradiation was achieved for BHJ PSCs with an inverted device structure. This high efficiency was obtained through interfacial engineering of a solution-processed electron extraction layer, leading to facilitate electron transport and suppress bimolecular recombination. These results provided an important progress for solution-processed PSCs, and demonstrated that PSCs with an inverted device structure are comparable with PSCs with a conventional device structure.

1. Introduction
Despite over 8% power conversion efficiency (PCE) being reported for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ composite/Ba(Al), where ITO is indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS is poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulphonate, Ba is barium and Al is aluminium,1−4 one finds that PEDOT:PSS on ITO are unstable with indium contaminating the polymer and thus degrading the performance of PSCs;5,6 meanwhile, Ba–Al is inherently flawed with lower long-term stability.7,8 In contrast, inverted PSCs were developed, in which air-stable high-work-function metals, typically, Ag or Au, are used as the anode and ITO is used as the cathode. Therefore, the elimination of the PEDOT:PSS layer improves PSC stability.9−14 Moreover, in the inverted PSCs, the anode, such as Ag (or Au), can be formed using coating or printing technology from Ag (or Au) pastes to simplify and lower the cost of manufacturing.15 In the inverted PSCs, n-type metal oxides such as titanium oxide (TiOx), zinc oxide (ZnO), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) and others are used to modify the cathode electrode, leading to inverted PSCs with PCEs ranging from 3% to 7%.16−21 However, the PCEs observed from PSCs with the inverted device structure are still not comparable to those obtained from PSCs with the conventional device configuration.22,23
Here, we report high performance BHJ PSCs with an inverted structure. By casting a thin conjugated polyelectrolyte layer onto the solution-processed ZnO thin film, the interface between ZnO electron extraction layer and BHJ active layer is re-engineered. As a result, a record PCE of 8.4% under AM 1.5G irradiation is achieved for BHJ PSCs with the inverted structure. This finding can potentially enable interfacial engineering for obtaining high performance BHJ PSCs.
2. Experimental
Materials
The BHJ materials under this study are a D–A conjugated polymer, PBDT-DTNT24 and PC71BM. The molecular structures of PBDT-DTNT, PC71BM and PFN-Br25 are shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis and characterization of PBDT-DTNT and PFN-Br in detail were reported elsewhere.24,25 The PC71BM was purchased from One-Material Inc. and used without further purification.

ZnO thin film
ZnO thin films coated on the top of ITO glass were obtained from ZnO precursor solution by sol–gel method.12 ZnO thin films of approximately 40 nm thickness were obtained by spin-coating ZnO precursor, following annealing at 200 °C for 10 minutes. The thin films were then continuously annealed in air at 200 °C for 1 hour. The thin films were ultrasonicated in isopropyl alcohol and subsequently dried in an oven for further characterization and used to fabricate inverted PSCs.
Absorption spectra of thin films
The absorption spectra of PBDT-DTNT, PC71BM, BHJ composite of PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM and ZnO/PFN-Br solid thin films were measured by a HP 8453 UV-vis spectrophotometer.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS)
ZnO thin film was prepared by the method described above. The ZnO/PFN-Br thin film was prepared by deposition of ∼5 nm thick PFN-Br from PFN-Br water–alcohol (1:1 by volume) solution on the top of ZnO thin film. The UPS measurements were carried out in a Thermo Fisher Scientific Ultra Spectrometer (ESCALAB 250) using a He I (21.22 eV) discharge lamp. A bias of −5.0 V was applied to the samples for separation of the sample and the secondary edge for the analyzer.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images
The tapping-mode AFM images were obtained by using a NanoScope NS3A system (Digital Instrument) to observe the surface morphologies of ZnO, ZnO/PFN-Br and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM BHJ composite.
Electronic conductivities of ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br thin films
The electronic conductivities of ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br thin films were conducted on Bruker Dimension Icon system with Peak Force Tapping Tunneling AFM (PFTUNA) module. The probe was the PFTUNA probe with spring constant of ∼0.5 N m−1 with 20 nm Pt/Ir coating on both front and back side. The spring was constantly measured using the thermal tune method. The peak currents were measured with bias voltage applied to the sample. The ramp rate of 0.4 Hz and the force setpoint of ∼60 nN were used for both thin films.
Inverted PSC fabrication
Two types of inverted PSCs were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates. For the inverted PSCs with ZnO thin layer as an electron extraction layer, an approximately 40 nm ZnO thin film was deposited on the top of ITO glass using the method described above.12 For the inverted PSCs with ZnO/PFN-Br as an electron extraction layer, an approximately 5 nm thick PFN-Br layer was cast on top of ∼40 nm thick ZnO which was coated on the ITO glass. The photoactive layer PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM BHJ composite with an approximately 250 nm thick was then spin coated on either ZnO or ZnO/PFN-Br layer from 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution composed of PBDT-DTNT and PC71BM (PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM = 1:1.5, by weight). The photoactive layer was then thermally annealed at 110 °C for 10 minutes. After that, about 8 nm molybdenum oxide (MoO3) was thermally deposited on top of the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM layer with an evaporation rate of 0.1 Å s−1 under a vacuum of ∼3 × 10−4 Pa. Ultimately, about 60 nm Ag film was deposited on top of the MoO3 layer through a shade mask. The device area was 0.16 cm2. All the devices were encapsulated with resin and exposed to ultraviolet light for 5 minutes in a glove-box with nitrogen atmosphere before testing in air.
Inverted PSC measurements
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. The solar cells were characterized using a Newport Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) full spectrum solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 95 mW cm−2.
Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra
The IPCE spectra of inverted PSCs were measured using a Solar Cell Quantum Efficiency Measurement System (QEX10) from PV Measurements, Inc.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of PBDT-DTNT, PC71BM, BHJ composite of PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM and ZnO/PFN-Br thin films. The bandgap of PBDT-DTNT is 1.48 eV, which is closer to the ideal bandgap for PSCs donor materials.26 PBDT-DTNT shows absorption from 400 nm to 800 nm and PC71BM shows absorption from 400 nm to 700 nm. The absorption spectrum of the PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM BHJ composite is the superposition of PBDT-DTNT and PC71BM which implies that both PBDT-DTNT and PC71BM will contribute photocurrent for PSCs fabricated by PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM. The ZnO/PFN-Br thin film only absorbs UV light and is transparent from 400 nm to 1000 nm. This indicates that visible light is allowed to pass through the ZnO/PFN-Br thin layer into the BHJ composite active layer. Therefore, the photodegradation of polymer active layer is reduced; as a result, good stability from inverted PSCs is anticipated.12

In order to verify the effect of PFN-Br on ZnO thin layer, UPS was carried out to study the energy levels of ZnO thin layer and ZnO/PFN-Br thin layer. The low kinetic energy cutoff (Ecutoff) of ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br thin layers were shown in Fig. 2a. Ecutoff was estimated by linear extrapolation of the low secondary electron portion of the spectrum and finding the intersect with the background signal.27 From Fig. 2a, the Ecutoff of ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br were −8.83 eV and −8.57 eV, respectively. There was about −0.26 eV energy difference between ZnO/PFN-Br thin layer and ZnO thin layer. This difference indicated that a dipole was formed28,29 between PFN-Br layer and ZnO layer.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels for ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br thin layers were shown in Fig. 2b. The HOMO energies (Scheme 2) are determined by EHOMO = hν − (EHOMOonset − Ecutoff)27(1)where hν is the incident photon energy, hν = 21.22 eV; Ecutoff is defined as the lowest kinetic energy of the measured electrons which can be obtained from Fig. 2a; EHOMOonset is the HOMO energy onset, generally referred to as the high kinetic energy onset. From Fig. 2b, the EHOMOonset for ZnO was 22.4 eV, and the EHOMOonset for ZnO/PFN-Br was 22.9 eV. Thus, the HOMO energies for ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br are −7.65 eV and −6.89 eV, respectively. Based on these HOMO energies and optical gaps obtained from the onset of absorption spectra (Fig. 1), the estimated LUMO energy levels were −4.46 eV for ZnO thin layer and −4.08 eV for ZnO/PFN-Br thin layer, respectively. The difference in LUMO energy levels between ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br indicated that the LUMO energy levels of ZnO was tuned by PFN-Br thin layer. More importantly, this energy difference implied that the band alignment in the inverted PSCs with and without PFN-Br interfacial layer are different.30−32 Therefore, a large Voc from the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer is anticipated.

Photovoltaic characteristics were investigated for the inverted PSCs with device architectures of ITO/ZnO/PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/PFN-Br/PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. J–V characteristics were shown in Fig. 3a. Without the PFN-Br interfacial layer, inverted PSCs showed a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 15.2 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.69 V, a fill factor (FF) of 55% and a corresponding PCE of 6.1%. After depositing a thin conjugated polyelectrolyte layer, PFN-Br, onto ZnO thin film to reengineer the interface between ZnO electron extraction layer and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM, inverted PSCs showed a Jsc of 17.4 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.75 V, a FF of 61% and a corresponding PCE of 8.4%. Over 37% enhanced PCEs were observed. Device performance optimization were performed involving over 500 identical devices fabricated from over 100 independent PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM, and ZnO/PFN-Br thin films; PCEs between 8.2% and 8.6% were obtained. The average device yields PCE of 8.4%, with Jsc of 17.4 mA cm−2 (the calculated Jsc value from the IPCE spectrum was 17.2 mA cm−2). This high efficiency is the highest values reported from inverted BHJ PSCs so far.

J versus V characteristics of inverted PSCs with device architectures of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/PFN-Br/active layer/MoO3/Ag (a) under illumination and (b) in the dark. 
The Voc of 0.75 V from the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer was larger than the Voc of 0.69 V from the inverted PSCs without PFN-Br interfacial layer. This difference was due to the different band alignments in the inverted PSCs with and without PFN-Br interfacial layer. This observation is in good agreement with the band alignment obtained in Fig. 2a and b.

Fig. 3b shows the J–V characteristics of inverted PSCs with and without PFN-Br interfacial layer measured in the dark. It was found that the dark current densities under the reverse bias from the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer are approximately 10 times smaller than those from the inverted PSCs without PFN-Br interfacial layer. The low dark current densities observed from the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer indicated that the biomolecular recombination was suppressed by PFN-Br interfacial layer.33−35 Thus, high photocurrent is expected.
More importantly, the low dark current densities observed from the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer implied that the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer possess larger Voc than those without PFN-Br interfacial layer.33 Towards the end, we modeled the J–V characteristics of PSCs with an equivalent circuit, consisting of a single diode with series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH). The addition of a parallel photocurrent source, Jph, leads to the well-known equation33 (2)where q is the electron charge, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and Jph is the voltage-dependent photocurrent produced by the cell. By rearranging eqn (1) under open circuit condition (J = 0) and Jph = Jsc, Voc can be described as (3)where J0 is reverse dark current density. According to eqn (3), the lower the J0, the higher the Voc. Therefore, inverted PSCs with a PFN-Br interfacial layer possess higher Voc than that PSCs without PFN-Br interfacial layer.
Device performance parameters were summarized in Table 1. The enhanced Jsc and FF in the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer implied that RS in the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer was smaller than that without PFN-Br interfacial layer, and RSH in the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer is larger than that without PFN-Br interfacial layer. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we have calculated RS and RSH based on the J–V curves shown in Fig. 3a. The RS for the inverted PSCs with and without PFN-Br interfacial layer are 6.1 Ω cm2 and 10.3 Ω cm2, respectively. The RSH for the inverted PSCs with and without PFN-Br interfacial layer are 757.6 Ω cm2 and 490.2 Ω cm2, respectively. It is indeed that the RS in the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer is smaller than that without PFN-Br interfacial layer, and the RSH in the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer is larger than that without PFN-Br interfacial layer.

In order to further analyse the cause of the large Jsc from the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer, electronic conductivities of ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br thin layers were investigated by PFTUNA measurement. An AFM tip coated with 20 nm Pt/Ir on both the front and back side was contacted with the surface of ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br thin films coated onto ITO glass. The PFTUNA module was used to measure the peak currents with bias voltage applied to the ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br thin layers.9 The peak currents were shown in Fig. 4a and b. The maximum peak current observed from pristine ZnO thin layer is about 5 pA within a 7 μm zoom. However, the maximum peak current observed from ZnO/PFN-Br thin layer is about 25 pA within a 4 μm zoom. These qualitative studies indicated that the electronic conductivity of ZnO/PFN-Br thin layer is much higher than that of ZnO thin layer. This high electronic conductivity will facilitate electron transport from BHJ composite to the corresponding electrode.23,33 Therefore, higher Jsc was observed from the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer rather than that without PFN-Br interfacial layer.

Fig. 5 compared the IPCE spectra of the inverted PSCs with and without PFN-Br interfacial layer. Inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer exhibited a substantially enhanced response from 400 nm to 800 nm as compared with that without PFN-Br interfacial layer. The inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer showed a high IPCE response over 64% from 400 nm to 750 nm, with a maximum value of 76% at 550 nm. Compared with the inverted PSCs without PFN-Br interfacial layer, the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer also exhibited a small difference in the spectrum from 490 nm to 720 nm. This difference probably originated from different internal optical electric field distributions due to the complex index of refraction and layer thickness of ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br.36,37 As shown in Fig. 3b, a large forward current is observed in the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer rather than that without PFN-Br interfacial layer.35,37 This indicated that the contact between PFN-Br interfacial layer and BHJ composite active layer is better than that between ZnO layer and BHJ composite active layer. Therefore, an enhanced IPCE response was observed from the inverted PSCs with PFN-Br interfacial layer.

AFM was carried out to further investigate the influence of PFN-Br interfacial layer on the device performance. Fig. 6a and b compared the surface morphologies of pristine ZnO and ZnO/PFN-Br thin films. With a scale of 10 μm × 10 μm, the root mean square (RMS) for ZnO/PFN-Br is 2.335 nm, and RMS for ZnO is 1.375 nm. The rough surface offers a better interaction between PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM BHJ composite layer and ZnO electron extraction layer whereas the smooth surface indicated that interfacial adhesion between PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM BHJ composite layer and ZnO electron extraction layer was weak.38,39Fig. 6c and d displays the surface morphologies of PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM on the pristine ZnO thin film and on the ZnO/PFN-Br thin film, respectively. The RMS for PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM on the pristine ZnO thin film and on the ZnO/PFN-Br thin film are 3.353 nm and 5.858 nm, respectively. Different roughness surfaces implied that the interfacial adhesion between MoO3 hole extraction layer and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM layer are different. The rougher the surface, the better the interfacial adhesion.38,39 Consequently, a better charge transport is expected from a good interfacial adhesion between MoO3 hole extraction layer and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM BHJ layer.

4. Conclusions
Through a conventional active-layer processing methodology, efficient BHJ PSCs with the inverted device structure based on PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM composites have been fabricated. A power conversion efficiency of 8.4% under AM 1.5G illumination was achieved from the inverted PSCs by using a PFN-Br interfacial layer to engineer the ZnO electron extraction layer. Without the PFN-Br interfacial layer, the inverted PSCs only showed an efficiency of 6.1% under the same condition. The overall enhanced short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, fill factor and corresponding high efficiency in the inverted PSCs with a thin conjugated polyelectrolyte interfacial layer were attributed to the good contact between ZnO electron extraction layer and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM BHJ active layer, good interface adhesion between the electron extraction layer and PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM BHJ active layer, and enhanced charge transport via suppressed bimolecular recombination. These results provided an important progress for solution-processed PSCs, and demonstrated that PSCs with an inverted device structure are comparable with PSCs with the conventional device structure.

Broader context
Presently, a major energy source is still based on limiting fossil fuels and nuclear power which are environmentally harmful. Increasing efforts have been paid in finding suitable environmentally friendly and renewable replacements. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) that can be fabricated by solution processing techniques are under intense investigation in both academic institutions and industrial companies because of their potential to enable mass production of flexible and cost-effective alternatives to silicon-based solar cells. A combination of novel polymer development, nanoscale morphology control and processing optimization has led to over 8% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for BHJ PSCs with a conventional device structure. Attempts to develop PSCs with an inverted device structure as required for achieving high PECs and good stability have, however, met with limited success. Here, we report that a high PCE of 8.4% under AM 1.5G irradiation was achieved for BHJ PSCs with an inverted device structure. This high efficiency was obtained through interfacial engineering of a solution-processed electron extraction layer, leading to facilitate electron transport and suppress bimolecular recombination. These results provided an important progress for solution-processed PSCs, and demonstrated that PSCs with an inverted device structure are comparable with PSCs with a conventional device structure.
