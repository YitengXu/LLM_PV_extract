    , Accepted 18th February 2019First published on 19th February 2019AbstractThe operational stability of organic solar cells (OSCs) is the essential barrier to commercialization. Compared to thermally-induced degradation, photo-stability of OSCs is far away from being resolved. Here, we demonstrate that the thermal- and photo-degradation of metastable bulk-heterojunction OSCs are governed by the same mechanism. Understanding the fundamental principles behind this mechanism is of significant importance to fully address the instability issues. Structural incompatibilities between the donor and acceptor molecules are identified as the main origin of the instability. Further, we introduce a top-down approach mainly based on their melting temperature and interaction parameters to rationally screen molecular phase stabilizers from a database with more than 10000 small molecules. Eventually, five chemicals were selected to validate our concept and tested in unstable organic solar cells. 1,4-Piperazine, which possesses a high melting point, good miscibility with polymers and the capability of forming inter-molecular hydrogen bonding, can indeed stabilize the mixed amorphous phases, leading to significantly improved stability of otherwise metastable OSCs.

Broader context
The attractive advantages of organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology are the high absorption coefficient and flexibility of organic semiconducting materials, allowing the freedom of form, and the light-weight and non-toxic properties of organic solar cells, granting applications in portable appliances and residential areas. The power conversion efficiency of OPV modules has achieved 9.7%, which leaves the operational lifetime of devices one of the most urgent issues for OPV towards large-scale commercial application. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to investigate and address the lifetime limitation. There are four essential factors causing degradation of OPV devices, namely, light, heat, oxygen and humidity. While by proper encapsulation the effects of oxygen and humidity can be tremendously suppressed, accumulated heat from illumination and white light are inherently unavoidable and must be addressed with the highest priority. To import a novel concept in tackling microstructure meta-stability and device long-term life issues, advance OPV technology towards photovoltaic markets, and boost the field of green energy, this work demonstrates that light and heat induced degradation possess the same fundamental origin. Moreover, molecular phase stabilizers are introduced to successfully overcome the instability issues of the high-performance PCE11:PC71BM organic solar cells without compromising the device performance.

Introduction
Tremendous progress has been achieved in the field of solution-processed organic photovoltaics (OPV) in the past two decades,1–6 with the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 17% in tandem devices7 and attaining 9.7% in modules.8 The unique advantages of OPV are the high absorption coefficient, flexibility, and the light-weight and non-toxic properties of organic semiconducting materials,9–11 providing the freedom of form required for portable and integrated applications.12–14 On the downside, the stability of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been one of the biggest barriers preventing OPV from entering the photovoltaic market.15–17 Increased research interest and efforts have been devoted to investigating and addressing the nature of these lifetime limitations.18–24 Excluding oxygen and humidity by proper packaging, light and temperature remain the central driving forces for degradation. This contribution provides the insight that light and temperature induced degradation mechanisms can have the same fundamental origin: a demixing phenomenon in the metastable amorphous state.
As the working temperature of solar cells is typically far below the melting or decomposition temperature of most photovoltaic materials, heat induced degradation is dominantly affecting microscopic morphology changes.21,25 More recent evidence implies that poor miscibility between the donor and acceptor phase results in a meta-stable amorphous phase, which, upon external stress, can cause burn-in type degradation behavior.24,26,27 There are two fundamentally different strategies to tackle phase separation between the donor and acceptor: (1) introducing chemical locking or crosslinking between the two phases, or (2) employing organic semiconductors with proper miscibility.28,29 Cross-linking has been regarded as an easy implementation strategy for the last decade, but is facing challenges to reach state-of-the-art time zero performances due to the complexity of the starting microstructure.21,30 These reports introduce compatibilizers to overcome microstructural instabilities. Different to traditional processing additives, these compatibilizers are designed to remain inside the composite matrix after processing.
Light induced burn-in loss mechanisms are even more difficult to rationalize due to the plurality of possible mechanisms.18 Adachi et al. demonstrated that accumulating charge carriers in the trap sites at the interfacial region leads to a deteriorated open-circuit voltage (VOC).31 Heumueller et al. observed that a redistribution of charge carriers in a broader density of states caused photo-induced VOC losses, while semi-crystalline materials turned out to be more stable against VOC burn-in losses during white light illumination.32,33 Fullerene dimerization in the amorphous region has been proven to be one origin for a JSC burn-in loss behavior in C60-based fullerene solar cells.34–36 We recently reported JSC burn-in behavior in various high performance BHJ composites which could not be explained by fullerene dimerization.24,26 Instead, microstructural instabilities arising from a too large interaction parameter between the polymer and the fullerene were identified as a further dominant degradation mechanism.
In this work, we investigate the degradation behavior of polymer:fullerene BHJ solar cells based on two state-of-the-art polymer donors – a semi-crystalline and an amorphous polymer donor – under thermal and illumination stress. In both BHJ systems, burn-in degradation exclusively affects JSC and is equivalently induced by either thermal- or photo-aging. A detailed analysis of the energy and intensity dependence of light-induced burn-in degradation suggests that photo-excited carriers do stress amorphous polymer segments in a similar way to thermal stress. Furthermore, we introduce a top-down approach to rationally screen molecular phase stabilizers according to their interaction parameters/miscibility with the donor and acceptor. 1,4-Piperazine is identified from a database with more than 10000 molecules as a vitrifying molecule which does not influence the initial photovoltaic performance. Only small amounts of piperazine (5 wt%) are required to stabilize the amorphous mixed phase against thermally and light-induced stress, leading to significantly improved device stability.
Results and discussion
Phenomena of heat- and light-induced degradation
The chemical structures of photoactive materials investigated in this work are illustrated in Fig. 1a. PC71BM instead of PC61BM was used for this study to maximally exclude dimerization.36 The device architecture of organic solar cells is depicted in Fig. 1b. ZnO nanoparticles and thermally evaporated MoOx were employed as electron and hole transporting materials in organic BHJ solar cells, respectively. The PCE11:PC71BM blend solution was spin-coated in a nitrogen atmosphere from a chlorobenzene:1,2-dichlorobenzene mixed solution. Fig. 1c shows the J–V characteristics of PCE11:PC71BM solar cells with and without aging. The fresh devices exhibited a JSC of 18.0 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 9.2%. Solar cells were aged by thermal annealing at 85 °C or illumination provided by white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a spectral emission from 400 nm to 800 nm. Both thermal and light aging were performed in electronically controlled degradation chambers in a nitrogen atmosphere. The J–V characteristics were probed periodically inline. After 2 hours’ annealing at 85 °C, the photovoltaic performances dropped by over 40% compared to the reference, as depicted in Fig. S1a and S2 (ESI†). The PCE, mainly due to the strong JSC burn-in degradation, dropped sharply in the first hour and then remained almost unchanged. During degradation, both the FF and VOC retained almost 100% of their original values. Most interestingly, we observed a significantly slower but otherwise identical degradation behavior under one-sun illumination with white light LEDs (Fig. S1b, ESI†); JSC burn-in loss dominated the total performance loss while the voltage and FF of the solar cell remained high.

To acquire deeper insights into the degradation behavior caused by thermal annealing and light illumination, we aged the solar cells under different stress levels by varying the degradation temperature, the light intensity and the photon energy. Fig. 1d reveals that the degree of burn-in degradation after finding equilibrium is directly related to the applied temperature. Solar cells aged at 35 °C found equilibrium after about 100 h at 90% of their initial performance. Increasing the aging temperature for the same sample to 60 °C triggered another exponential-type JSC burn-in loss, reducing the performance to about 80% in less than 100 hours. Finally, increasing the temperature to 85 °C caused a quick JSC drop to about 70% of the initial performance within a few hours only. After that, JSC remained constant. The FF and VOC of the solar cells remained almost unchanged through the whole aging process. The PCE basically evolved following the JSC trend (Fig. S3, ESI†). Next, the light-intensity dependence of burn-in degradation was investigated and summarized in Fig. 1e. JSC is diminished significantly faster when aging under stronger illumination, with a weak, sublinear slope (Fig. S4, ESI†). The FF and VOC again were not affected (Fig. S5, ESI†). Although we are not able to model the weak light intensity dependence, such small scaling exponents are more characteristic of indirect mechanisms like thermal dissipation.
Furthermore, it is of utmost importance to clarify the possible role of the photon's excess energy on microstructure induced burn-in degradation. First, six solar cells were aged under light with a wavelength higher than ∼650 nm by using long-wave pass filters; the light intensity was adjusted so that the JSC of the solar cells was identical to that measured under the simulated AM 1.5G solar spectrum. The wavelength window was chosen such that the photon energy of the light above 650 nm (Eh ≤ 1.9 eV) is slightly above resonance with the bandgap of PCE11 (1.65 eV).37 As illustrated in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the JSC was lost exponentially while the FF and VOC were preserved. After around 160 hours, the filters were replaced by a 400 nm cut-on long pass filter transmitting light with wavelengths higher than 400 nm (Eh ≤ 3.1 eV); the light intensity was adjusted so that the JSC of the solar cells was the same as before changing filters. To our surprise, Fig. S6 (ESI†) reveals that highly energetic light with a wavelength >400 nm is resulting in JSC burn-in losses of a similar magnitude as low energy light with a wavelength >650 nm, indicating a wavelength independence of the JSC burn-in loss. For the moment we state a wavelength independence of the JSC burn-in loss for this particular material system and turn our attention to exploring the degradation mechanism, in particular the origin of these generic burn-in phenomena.
Equivalence of heat- and light-induced degradation
Firstly, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was carried out on fresh and aged BHJ films. The FTIR spectra in Fig. S7 (ESI†) reveal that the features of both the polymer and PC71BM in the three samples are identical. Neither heat nor light has chemically damaged the semiconductors in our experiments, or the damage was too negligible to be detected. Secondly, 2D Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed (Fig. S8, ESI†); the corresponding linecut profiles collected from out-of-plane and in-plane cuts are depicted in Fig. 2a. The polymer lamella peak (100) and stacking (010) are well defined and in good agreement with the literature.37 The perfectly overlapped GIWAXS profiles demonstrate that the crystalline phases of PCE11 and PC71BM remained unchanged after thermal annealing or light illumination. Thus, charge transport and non-geminate recombination in these samples remained almost unaffected, which is in good agreement with the high FF retained for the aged samples.

Normalized JSC evolution of PCE11:PC71BM solar cells (c) first under thermal aging at 85 °C then exposed to one-sun white-light illumination, and (d) first under white-light illumination then aged at 85 °C. While under illumination, the temperature of the chambers/solar cells was about ∼35 °C. 
Then, the morphological properties concerning the intimately mixed amorphous regions were investigated by Grazing-Incidence Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) techniques.38,39 The 2D GISAXS patterns and in-plane GISAXS profiles of the films with and without aging are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) and Fig. 2b, respectively, and clearly indicate distinct differences for the degraded samples. The form factor scattering of the pure PC71BM domains/clusters contributes mostly to the shape of the shoulder in the linecuts. The correlation length of each sample derived from the DAB model is summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Both thermally and light-aged samples have increased correlation lengths as compared to the reference, representing the diffusion of fullerene molecules and the formation of domains with a stronger separation between the polymer donor and the fullerene acceptor. In line with previous studies,24 we suggest that the poor miscibility between PCE11 and PC71BM is the driving force behind the donor/acceptor demixing in the amorphous phase.
Finally, and to uniquely prove the equivalence of thermal and light aging for this bulk heterojunction composite, solar cells fabricated in the same run were subsequently aged under heat and light. As illustrated in Fig. 2c and d, there was no further JSC loss under illumination when the solar cells were first thermally aged at 85 °C; similarly, no further JSC loss was observed upon thermal aging when the solar cells were subject to photo-degradation beforehand. The FF and VOC again were insensitive to this procedure and remained at a high level (Fig. S10, ESI†). This is strong proof that thermal-annealing and photo-degradation cause identical changes to the metastable microstructures of PCE11:PC71BM.
We believe that this equivalence is quite generic to bulk heterojunction composites with metastable microstructures. Therefore, we carried out further investigation on a model amorphous polymer, PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 (DSC data is shown in Fig. S11, ESI†). PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PC71BM solar cells are known to be sensitive to burn-in degradation as a function of processing and molecular weight distribution.30,40 The PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PC71BM solar cells showed the same characteristic light–temperature burn-in equivalence as PCE11:PC71BM blends (Fig. S12 and S13, ESI†). We are aware that two observations for different polymer systems are, strictly speaking, not unique proof but a strong admissible hypothesis for the generic equivalence of temperature/light-intensity burn-in degradation in metastable microstructures. Here, the combination of the above characterization and analysis allows us to affirmatively conclude that light- and thermal-aging indeed induce the same type of microstructural changes in the finely mixed amorphous regions, which primarily accounts for the burn-in degradation in these types of BHJ solar cells.
Suppression of the burn-in losses with additives
It has been previously found that the BHJ microstructure of PCE11-based solar cells could be frozen at low temperature (220 K)24 and that material systems with good miscibility could fully maintain their finely optimized microstructure upon 140 °C thermal stress.28 To overcome the meta-stability of the BHJ microstructure, we introduce a simple but elegant top-down concept to select proper molecules as solid additives to stabilize the finely-mixed amorphous domains. The selection of solid additives, which is based on the database from Hansen Solubility Parameter in Practice (HSPiP)41 containing more than 10000 molecules, was made in only five steps, as described in Fig. 3a. A melting point higher than 100 °C was the very first criterion, since the molecular stabilizers have to be stable during solar cell operation. Moreover, the molecular stabilizers are expected to be localized mainly in the finely-mixed amorphous region, so that their miscibility with PC71BM should be comparable to the miscibility between PC71BM and PCE11 (step 3). The relative miscibility between two compounds is represented by x12RT/v0 where x12 is the dimensionless Flory–Huggins interaction parameter, which can be employed to evaluate polymer:small molecule miscibility.3,28,42–44 Furthermore, the molecular stabilizers should be small and chemically stable in order not to diminish the initial photovoltaic performance or original stability. Eventually, 21 chemicals with symmetric structure were of the highest interest (Table S2, ESI†). The relative miscibility of additives with PC71BM was plotted as a function of the relative miscibility of additives with PCE11 (Fig. 3a bottom). We chose three additives with distinct miscibility with PCE11 (Table 1) to validate our concept, as depicted in Fig. 3b, 1,4-piperazine (pip), 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene (DMN), and 1,4-dithiane (DT).
 Fig. 3  (a) Scheme of the 5-step pre-selection of additives from software Hansen Solubility Parameter in Practice (HSPiP); in step 1, melting points of the chemicals were found from online websites45 with a Python program; in step 3, 372 chemicals were found possessing miscibility with PC71BM similar to that between PCE11 and PC71BM; in step 4, alkanes with more than four non-hydrogen atoms, cycloalkanes with substitutes longer than two non-hydrogen atoms, and aromatics with substitutes longer than two non-hydrogen atoms or with more than two fused aromatics are considered big; olefins and alkynes are considered unstable.

As indicated in Fig. 3c, there was no visual stabilization of JSC with 5 wt% addition of DT or DMN, while solar cells with 5 wt% piperazine basically preserve 100% initial JSC under thermal aging or 1000 hours’ light aging (Fig. 3d and Fig. S14, ESI†). As summarized in Fig. S15 (ESI†), with increasing amounts of DMN (20 wt% and 25 wt%), PCE11:PC71BM solar cells did experience less JSC burn-in loss, but nevertheless suffered from a significant loss in FF. The initial performance of OSCs was also negatively affected by adding such a high amount of DMN, indicating that DMN cannot be a good phase stabilizer for PCE11:PC71BM. As summarized in Fig. 3e and f, PCE11:PC71BM solar cells were stabilized even with 1.8 wt% piperazine and their initial photovoltaic performance was not influenced with up to 10 wt% piperazine. There are no detectable effects on the amorphous domains as indicated by the perfect overlap of the GISAXS linecuts (Fig. 3g, corresponding 2D patterns in Fig. S16, ESI†), which is also well supported by the electroluminescence (EL) spectra in Fig. S17 (ESI†). As depicted in the absorption spectra (Fig. 3h), the 0–0 transition peak shows a slight decrease (without red shift) with 5 wt% piperazine, indicating that the crystallinity/aggregation of PCE11 lightly declines,37 which is well explained by the GIWAXS data in Fig. S18 (ESI†).
Although piperazine has the best miscibility with PCE11 among the three selected molecules, the notable stabilizing effect by adding only 1.8 wt% of piperazine is still unclear. The possibility of a chemical reaction between piperazine and PC71BM was excluded by characterization of mass spectrometry and solution absorption (more details are in Fig. S19 and S20, ESI†). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out on PCE11:PC71BM with and without piperazine. As shown in the snapshots of molecular dynamics (Fig. 4a and b), PCE11 and PC71BM tend to demix and form large aggregates; in the presence of piperazine, PCE11 and PC71BM remain finely mixed after relaxation. The differences are more apparent with an analysis of the intermolecular contacts. Fig. 4c displays the radial distribution function between PCE11 backbones and PC71BM centers of mass; this parameter gives information about the number of intermolecular contacts between the two components as a function of distance. The features of both profiles are similar to those reported in previous work.46 Notably, the profile is clearly larger for the system with piperazine, indicating that piperazine promotes contacts between PCE11 and PC71BM, while it reduces interaction contacts within PC71BM molecules (Fig. S21, ESI†).
 Fig. 4  Snapshots of the molecular dynamics for the PCE11:PC71BM system (a) and PCE11:PC71BM:piperazine system (b), PCE11 carbon atoms are represented with grey sticks, PC71BM molecules with blue sticks and purple sheets, and piperazine carbon atoms with green sticks; (c) radical distribution function between PCE11 backbones and the PC71BM centers of mass; (d) radial distribution function between the heteroatoms of PCE11/PC71BM and the nitrogen atoms of piperazine; (e) time evolution of the hydrogen bonding for one of the MD trajectories of the PCE11:PC71BM:piperazine system; (f) schematic diagram of hydrogen bonds between piperazine and PCE11/PC71BM (one of the examples of piperazine molecules linking a PCE11 chain and a PC71BM molecule). 
In addition, the role of piperazine has been analyzed in terms of interactions between specific atoms of different components, in particular, the radial distribution function between the hydrogen-bonding donor nitrogen atoms of piperazine and the potential acceptor atoms of both PCE11 and PC71BM. The plots in Fig. 4d reveal strong localization of piperazine nitrogen atoms close to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of PC71BM, most probably related to the formation of hydrogen bonds. Regarding the PCE11 heteroatoms, the piperazine N atoms are also located at close distances, but to a lesser degree. Further, the formation of hydrogen bonds was investigated; for this analysis, a criterion of a donor–acceptor distance shorter than 3.5 Å and N–H⋯X angles greater than 180° was applied. As shown in Fig. 4e, piperazine indeed does form hydrogen bonds with itself but also, although to a lower extent, with PCE11 or PC71BM. From the MD simulation, we also observed that piperazine molecules link PCE11 chains and PC71BM molecules through hydrogen bonds; Fig. 4f shows one of the examples of hydrogen bonds connecting PCE11, PC71BM, and piperazine.
To validate the unique advantage of our top-down concept, two more additives, bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)sebacate (BTPS) and 4,4′-biphenol (BPO) (chemical structure in Fig. S22a, ESI†), were tested in PCE11:PC71BM solar cells. Both BTPS and BPO possess functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds. However, BTPS has a relatively low melting point of 82 °C, while BPO has poor miscibility with PCE11 (Table S3, ESI†). As depicted in Fig. S22b (ESI†), solar cells with BTPS degraded more quickly and more severely than the control devices under 65 °C thermal aging, owing to the unstable microstructure morphology induced by BTPS and further interaction with the interface and metal electrode. As show in Fig. S22c (ESI†), the addition of BPO has almost no effect on the stability of PCE11:PC71BM solar cells under illumination conditions, due to its low miscibility with both PCE11 and PC71BM.
We applied the top-down concept again to select the molecular phase stabilizers for the PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PCBM system. It is notable that 1,4-piperazine was again selected as one of the final candidates, owing to its good miscibility with PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 as summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S23 (ESI†), the photo-stability of PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PCBM was also tremendously enhanced by adding only 1.8 wt% piperazine, indicating the general applicability of the top-down selection concept. To stabilize the metastable BHJ solar cell, we specify the selection criteria as follows (Table 2): (1) a melting point higher than 100 °C and chemically stable to avoid morphological change during solar cell operation; (2) very good miscibility with both the polymer and PCBM enabling positive interactions in the finely-mixed amorphous region; and (3) hydrogen bonds formed between molecules, which reduces the amount of molecular phase stabilizers required.

Conclusion
In this work, we investigated the heat- and light-induced degradation behavior of BHJ organic solar cells based on a semi-crystalline polymer PCE11 and an amorphous polymer PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8. Degradation upon either heat or light stress induced the same microstructural changes, i.e. polymer–fullerene demixing in the amorphous region, leading to strong burn-in degradation in JSC in both BHJ systems. This finding would be validated in other similar BHJ systems which suffer from JSC burn-in degradation due to a metastable BHJ morphology, and provides a unique way to extend the standard photo-stability test (typically >1000 hrs under one-sun illumination) by combining with thermal-aging at elevated temperatures. Further, we developed a simple but elegant approach to identify molecular phase stabilizers from a database containing more than 10000 molecules. The instability issues of metastable BHJ OSCs were successfully overcome by adding small amounts of a solid additive – 1,4-piperazine – without compromising the device performance. The findings in this study would substantially promote progress in scalable composites for stable and efficient thin film photovoltaics.
Methods
Materials
A ZnO-nanoparticle dispersion in isopropyl alcohol was received from Avantama. PCE11 (batch: YY10128CH) and PC71BM (99%) were purchased from One Material and Solenne BV, respectively. PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8 was received from Merck.
Device fabrication
All solar cells were fabricated in an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoOx/Al. The pre-structured ITO coated glass substrates were subsequently cleaned in toluene, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each. Then 30 nm ZnO (Avantama, N10) was doctor bladed at 30 °C on the ITO substrate and annealed at 85 °C in ambient air. The PCE11 based active layer from chlorobenzene:1,2-dichlorobenzene:diphenylether (58.5:38.5:3) solution and PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PC71BM from chlorobenzene:diphenylether (97:3) were spin coated on top of ZnO in a nitrogen atmosphere. 15 nm MoOx and 100 nm Al were deposited subsequently under 6 × 10−6 Torr by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask to form an active area of 10.4 mm2.
General device characterization
The current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured with a Keithley 2400 under AM 1.5G irradiation from an OrielSollA Solar simulator (100 mW cm−2). The light source was calibrated by using a silicon reference cell. All cells were tested in ambient air. Film absorption was characterized with a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer Lambda 950 from PerkinElmer. Thin film photoluminescence measurements were conducted under excitation with a 375 nm diode laser. The spectra were recorded with a Si-CCD attached to an iHR320 monochromator (Horiba).
White light LED degradation characteristics
The solar cells were loaded into a sealed chamber which can contain nine substrates of solar cells. This chamber was then continuously purged with nitrogen. The water and oxygen levels were kept below 0.5 ppm. For white light illumination, the aging light sources are eight white light LEDs with an emission spectrum between 400 nm and 800 nm. For thermal aging, the light sources for inline J–V characteristics are eight white light LEDs and one UV-LED with a wavelength of 365 nm. The neutral-density filters are the FS-ND series from Newport. Different neutral-density filters were employed to investigate the light intensity dependence of microstructure related burn-in degradation between 0.3 and 1.6 suns. The light intensity of the highly accelerated lifetime setup was calibrated with a standard Si-diode by Newport.
High power illumination degradation setup
This is a homemade, highly-accelerated lifetime setup which has precise temperature control and a variable light intensity ranging from 0.75 suns to about 16 suns. The light source is a xenon short arc lamp (OSRAM XBO 1600W/XL OFR). To increase illumination densities, the light is focused by a mirror and homogenized by a beam homogenizer onto the samples. To control sample temperatures and to keep the solar cell at a constant temperature value, the devices under test were mounted on an actively cooled copper heat sink which removes the heat impact of the light. The heat sink is also equipped with electrical contacts to perform inline measurements of the cell parameters. Furthermore, the samples were mounted in a box and kept in a nitrogen atmosphere during illumination. The 500 nm and 650 nm cut-on long-wave pass filters are UV grade fused silica from Edmund Optics. The 400 nm cut-on longpass filter is GG400 from SCHOTT AG.
FTIR measurements
The FTIR spectra were measured with a Vertex 70 from Bruker optics. A PCE11:PC71BM blended solution was drop cast on zinc sulfide based substrates and dried under a vacuum overnight. The light-aged sample was illuminated in the degradation chamber for 100 hours, while the other samples were kept in the dark and in a nitrogen atmosphere. The thermally aged sample was aged at 85 °C for 2 hours on a hotplate inside a glovebox prior to FTIR characterization.
GIWAXS and GISAXS measurements
The GIWAXS/GISAXS patterns were collected with the highly customized Versatile Advanced X-ray Scattering instrumenT ERlangen (VAXSTER) at the chair for Crystallography and Structural Physics, FAU, Germany. The system is equipped with a MetalJet D2 70 kV X-ray source from EXCILLUM, Sweden. The beam was shaped by a 150 mm Montel optic (INCOATEC, Geesthacht) and two of the available four double-slit systems with the last slit system equipped with low scattering blades (JJXray/SAXSLAB). Aperture sizes were (0.7 × 0.7 mm2, 0.462 × 0.462 mm2) for GIWAXS and (0.15 × 0.06 mm2, 0.12 × 0.048 mm2) for GISAXS. The sample position was located within the fully evacuated detector tube. The hybrid-pixel 2D Pilatus 300K detector (Dectris Ltd, Baden, Switzerland) was used to collect the scattered radiation. The measurements were carried out at energy of 9.24 keV. The samples were mounted on a yz-theta goniometer allowing one to adjust grazing incidence angles which maximize the scattering volume and enhance the scattered intensity. The incidence angle for GIWAXS measurements was 0.17°. The grazing incidence geometry of the incident X-ray with respect to the sample surface is used here to enhance the scattered intensity, to maximize the scattering volume, and to access the three dimensional (3D) structure of the studied thin films (lateral and normal direction). The sample-to-detector distance (SDD) was calibrated with a silver behenate standard to 179 mm for GIWAXS and 1590 mm for GISAXS. An incidence angle of around 0.25° was chosen to obtain a clear separation between the Yoneda peaks of the involved materials and the specular peak in GISAXS. Data were reduced with dpdak software.47 The structural model for the reduced GISAXS data was fitted using the program SASfit.48 The PCE11:PC71BM blend films were spin coated on silicon substrates. The light-aged film was aged for 140 hours and the thermally aged film was thermally annealed for 1 hour under a nitrogen atmosphere. Both GIWAXS and GISAXS were performed on the same sample.
MD simulations
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been carried out on the PCE11:PC71BM and PCE11:PC71BM:piperazine systems. The OPLS-AA force-field49 has been used to represent all the atoms in the systems; parameters for PCE11 and PC71BM have been taken from ref. 46 and 50, while atomic charges for piperazine were obtained from DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory with the RESP fitting procedure. PCE11:PC71BM consisted of 30 PCE11 chains (each one with 12 repeat units) and 555 PC71BM molecules, corresponding to a weight ratio of about 1:1.5; while the systems with piperazine have the same polymer and fullerene molecules plus 555 piperazine molecules (a weight ratio of about 1:1.5:0.125). The computational procedure was the following: firstly, a set of initial configurations (2 different configurations for each system) has been generated by placing the molecules randomly within a large simulation box (avoiding steric clashes). Then, the box dimensions are progressively reduced in a series of short molecular dynamics prior to the production run. The MD simulations have been carried out with the LAMMPS software51 and the starting configurations have been generated with PACKMOL,52 while the input files have been obtained with the moltemplate tool.53 The DFT calculations were performed with the GAMESS package,54 and the Red online tool55 has been used to compute the atomic charges.

Broader context
The attractive advantages of organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology are the high absorption coefficient and flexibility of organic semiconducting materials, allowing the freedom of form, and the light-weight and non-toxic properties of organic solar cells, granting applications in portable appliances and residential areas. The power conversion efficiency of OPV modules has achieved 9.7%, which leaves the operational lifetime of devices one of the most urgent issues for OPV towards large-scale commercial application. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to investigate and address the lifetime limitation. There are four essential factors causing degradation of OPV devices, namely, light, heat, oxygen and humidity. While by proper encapsulation the effects of oxygen and humidity can be tremendously suppressed, accumulated heat from illumination and white light are inherently unavoidable and must be addressed with the highest priority. To import a novel concept in tackling microstructure meta-stability and device long-term life issues, advance OPV technology towards photovoltaic markets, and boost the field of green energy, this work demonstrates that light and heat induced degradation possess the same fundamental origin. Moreover, molecular phase stabilizers are introduced to successfully overcome the instability issues of the high-performance PCE11:PC71BM organic solar cells without compromising the device performance.
