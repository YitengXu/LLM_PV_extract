    , Accepted 15th July 2016First published on 15th July 2016AbstractA homogeneous cap-mediated crystallization concept with face-to-face configuration is proposed here to modulate the crystallization kinetics of organolead triiodide perovskite (OTP) films in a controlled way. The introduced OTP caps, especially those with low surface roughness, play a dramatically positive role in retarding the nucleation rate, promoting the growth, and preventing the composition loss of OTP grains, fully facilitating the formation of pinhole-free OTP films with numerous desirable characteristics, such as greatly enlarged grains, vertically aligned grain boundaries, preferred (110) orientation, significantly improved crystallinity, and proper stoichiometry. As a consequence, planar-heterojunction solar cells incorporating these high-quality films deliver a promising average efficiency of 17.87%, showing a remarkable enhancement of approximately 30% compared with control samples. In particular, large fill factors can be routinely achieved in these high efficiency cells. This excellent performance mainly originates from greatly suppressed non-radiative recombination as well as from the greatly enhanced diffusion and transfer properties of charge carriers in the cells as a result of the improved quality of the OTP films. Our work presents an effective and useful strategy to fabricate high-performance planar heterojunction solar cells based on OTP materials.
Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) devices with organolead triiodide perovskite (OTP) films, namely perovskite solar cells, have shown enormous potential for promising applications in the past few years owing to their very high power conversion efficiencies (PCE),1–3 low cost,4 easy fabrication,2 and even their feasible use in tandem with state-of-the-art PV technologies.5 These desirable benefits primarily rely on the extraordinary features of OTP films, such as their high absorption coefficients,1,2 tunable bandgaps,6 long and balanced carrier diffusions,7 ambipolar transport of charge carriers,4 and tolerance of defects, in addition to their self-assembly properties.8 To exploit these excellent properties in perovskite solar cells, tremendous efforts have been devoted towards synthesizing high-quality OTP films with expected merits, including full surface coverage, large grain size, excellent crystallinity, low defect density and proper stoichiometry, via a solution-chemistry strategy.9–15 Typically, the simplest one-step spin-coating method is widely used, with a premixed PbI2/PbCl2 and CH3NH3I precursor solution.1,7 Due to the greatly different solubilities of the precursor components in commonly used solvents, the one-step spin-coating route generally leads to the growth of needle-shaped OTP crystals in the resulting films, forming shunting paths in the devices.12,16–19 This undesirable situation is a more serious drawback for perovskite solar cells with planar structures.11,20 Solvent engineering, where a mixed solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or γ-butyrolactone (GBL) is used followed by a nonpolar solvent washing step, has been proved to be extremely effective to overcome this problem.3,19,21 Additionally, an intermediate complex film composed of CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO generally forms after the spin-coating process.19,21,22 This solid film can be crystallized into OTP film by subsequent thermal annealing. Thus, the key to realizing the expected OTP films is the precise kinetic control of this solid-phase crystallization process. For example, microwave irradiation,23 laser-assisted annealing,24 incorporation of additives,25 and optimized solvent annealing26 strategies to establish this control have resulted in increased quality OTP films and, thus, in devices with increased performance.
The cap-mediated crystallization strategy, where a hetero-/homogeneous capping film is deposited or placed face-to-face on the precursor film during solid-phase crystallization, was firstly proposed for GaAs materials to minimize their surface degradation;27 it was then extended to various inorganic functional materials, such as polycrystalline silicon,28 ZnO,29 Mg0.25Zn0.75O,30 and SrBi2Ta2O9.31 In particular, it has been proved to be highly feasible in crystallization kinetic control to tailor the grain uniformity, crystallinity, composition and defect density of thin films. Of course, this level of control is also extremely desirable for realizing high-quality OTP films.
Herein, homogeneous cap-mediated (HCM) crystallization with a face-to-face placed OTP cap is successfully introduced to tailor the crystallization kinetics of OTP films during the solid-phase transformation from the precursor films produced by the solvent engineering assisted one-step spin-coating method. It is found that homogeneous OTP caps, especially those with low surface roughness, play a critical role in retarding the nucleation rate, promoting the growth, and reducing the composition loss of OTP grains, thus inducing the formation of pinhole-free OTP films with greatly enlarged grains, vertically aligned grain boundaries, preferred (110) orientation, significantly improved crystallinity, and proper stoichiometry. Planar-heterojunction solar cells incorporating these high-quality films yield a promising average PCE of 17.87%, showing an enhancement of approximately 30% compared with devices incorporating control samples. This amazing enhancement can be mainly attributed to the greatly reduced defect sites in the high-quality OTP films along with suppressed non-radiative recombination of the charge carriers. In particular, high fill factors (FFs) can be reproducibly achieved as a result of the improved diffusion and transfer properties of the charge carriers along the direction perpendicular to the substrate in the cells.
Results and discussion
For the HCM crystallization protocol proposed here, the precursor OTP film was firstly synthesized via the solvent engineering assisted one-step spin-coating route reported by Park et al.,19 which is also schematically described in Fig. S1.† Then, the film was thermally annealed at 100 °C for about 15 min with the configuration illustrated in Fig. 1(a), where the transparent precursor OTP sample was placed face-to-face with a black crystallized OTP cap during this annealing process. After cooling to room temperature, the cap was removed and the HCM crystallized OTP film was obtained. An OTP film crystallized without the cap, namely conventional crystallization, as shown in Fig. 1(b), was also prepared as a control sample. More details are provided in the Experimental section.

(c and d) Top-view SEM images of (c) the HCM crystallized OTP film and (d) the control sample prepared by conventional crystallization. (e and f) Cross-sectional SEM images of the HCM crystallized OTP film (e) and the control sample (f), respectively. 

Fig. 1(c) shows a top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the HCM crystallized OTP sample. As can be seen, the sample possesses full and uniform surface coverage. Moreover, the entire film consists of flat, well-crystallized polygonal OTP grains. These grains exhibit the microstructural character of triple junctions of grain boundaries with a predominant equal vertex angle of 120°, which means that most of the grain boundaries are in the equilibrium state with low internal stress. These grain features can also be partially observed in the control sample with similar coverage, as exhibited in Fig. 1(d). However, there is an obvious difference in grain size between these two films. Fig. S2(c)† provides the corresponding histograms of statistic grain size distribution within the areas given in Fig. S2(a) and (b),† which were estimated using the equivalent area method with the assumption of cylindrical grains. The average grain size is calculated to be 1.10 μm for the HCM crystallized OTP film and 0.17 μm for the control sample. That is to say, HCM crystallization can enable the realization of an OTP film with greatly enlarged grains. Generally, enlarged grains readily induce variation in the surface roughness of thin films; therefore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were also conducted. As revealed in Fig. S2(d) and (e),† the surface roughness is slightly increased in the HCM crystallized OTP film, with a calculated root-mean-square value (RMS) of 17.1 nm compared with the control sample, which has an RMS of 6.8 nm. However, this value is still relatively low, which is critical for highly efficient planar devices.11,20 It should be noted that the enlarged grains are accompanied by the reduction of grain boundaries as well as a change in the grain-boundary orientation, especially along the direction perpendicular to the substrate, as revealed in Fig. 1(e) and (f). For HCM crystallized OTP film, nearly all the individual grains can cross the entire film and form vertically oriented grain boundaries. Meanwhile, for the control sample, numerous horizontal grain boundaries exist because the small grains cannot span the thickness of the film.32
The crystalline structures of the studied OTP films and the precursor film were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), the precursor film possesses an amorphous nature; this slightly differs from the previous result, partially because the measurement was conducted immediately after diethyl ether dropping.19,21 Also, clear diffraction peaks at 14.0°, 28.3° and 31.8° were detected for both the HCM crystallized OTP film and the control sample, which can be indexed to the (110), (220) and (310) planes of tetragonal OTP.16,18 By comparison, the intensity of each peak for the HCM crystallized OTP film is stronger than that of the control sample, which indicates its higher crystallinity with less scattering of grain boundaries and fewer intragranular defects.33,34 The mean coherent scattering domain size estimated from the half width of the (110) diffraction peak according to the Debye–Scherrer formula is around 137 nm for the HCM crystallized OTP film and 65 nm for the control sample, which further verifies the larger grains of the HCM crystallized sample.32 In addition, the relative intensities of the peaks are different between the two samples, which indicate a difference in their grain orientations. To distinguish this difference, we normalized each XRD spectrum to the corresponding peak intensity of the (110) plane and the results are shown in Fig. S3.† It can be seen that the peak intensity ratios of both the (110) to (310) planes and the (220) to (310) planes for the HCM crystallized OTP film are much higher than those for the control sample, which signifies that the grains of the HCM crystallized OTP film possess the preferable (110) orientation.15,20,32,34

We further examined the elemental composition of each film via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the obtained results are given in Fig. S4† and 2(b); these were calibrated using C 1s (284.5 eV) as the reference.35 As identified in Fig. S4,† except for the sharp peaks corresponding to Pb, I, N, and C elements, no other element was detected in either OTP film, indicating their pure composition and full coverage. The atomic concentrations of I and Pb were estimated by integrating the areas under the Pb 4f and I 3d peaks in the XPS core spectra, as given in Fig. 2(b). The calculated atomic ratios of I/Pb are 2.79 and 2.31 for the HCM crystallized OTP film and the control sample, respectively. They are both less than 3.00, which was frequently observed in previous works and is mainly attributed to the partial sublimation of I during the XPS measurement as well as the different instrumental atomic sensitivities.35,36 However, the comparison of the relative differences is acceptable. Therefore, the OTP powder was prepared via an anti-solvent method at room temperature to dispel the annealing induced composition variation, and the corresponding ratio was determined to be 2.82. Clearly, the atomic ratio of I/Pb for the HCM crystallized OTP film is extremely close to that for the synthesized powder, whereas the value for the control sample is much less than that for the synthesized powder. These results suggest that the HCM crystallized OTP film has a more stoichiometric composition, namely, a lower iodide deficiency.37,38
It should be emphasized that due to the inferior thermostability of the OTP materials, the processing window (thermal treatment temperature and time) for conventional crystallization is inherently restricted, thus resulting in grain coarsening of OTP films.18,39 Therefore, OTP films with both features of large grains and proper stoichiometry are difficult to achieve via conventional crystallization. Therefore, post-deposition modification to boost the film quality is usually needed.39 Here, OTP films with both of the above two characteristics can be easily realized without any post-treatments, which is one of the special advantages of HCM crystallization. Meanwhile, as revealed in Fig. S5,† there were no characteristic peaks of PbI2 in the XRD spectrum of the HCM crystallized OTP film when the thermal annealing temperature was increased to 150 °C and the time was prolonged to 40 min, while a clear PbI2 signal can be detected for the control sample with the same thermal annealing conditions.16 That is to say, the processing window for the HCM crystallization strategy can be extended, which suggests the feasibility of further improving the film quality based on the well-established sintering theory. Moreover, HCM crystallization is a top-surface modification strategy. As a consequence, it is not affected by the substrate material or its microstructure. Also, this strategy is principally applicable for other perovskite films such as CH3NH3PbBr3, CH3NH3PbI2Br, and HC(NH2)2PbI3. Namely, it possesses wide applicability. To summarize, HCM crystallization has numerous unique merits and can be used to realize high-quality OTP films with large grains along with vertically aligned grain boundaries, preferred (110) orientation, high crystallinity, and proper stoichiometry. These properties meet the requirements of high efficiency perovskite solar cells.3,15
To provide further insight into the HCM crystallization process, we used different caps and monitored the morphology of the resulting films. In detail, Fig. S6(a)–(c)† give top-view SEM images of the homogeneous caps with different surface roughnesses. Fig. S6(d)† shows a top-view SEM image of the heterogeneous TiO2 cap. Fig. 3(a)–(d) show the corresponding AFM topographical images as well as the determined RMS of the surface roughnesses. Fig. 3(e)–(h) show top-view SEM images of the resulting OTP films. The histograms of the statistic grain size distributions within the given area and the corresponding average grain sizes are shown in Fig. S7.† We can draw the following two conclusions from the above results. First, a homogeneous OTP cap is a prerequisite to achieve a pinhole-free OTP film. Second, a smoother cap surface is imperative to form an OTP film with a larger average grain size, as plotted in Fig. 3(i). The microstructure of an OTP film is theoretically determined by the nucleation and growth of grains during the solid crystallization process.39,40 A larger average grain size indicates a smaller nucleation density during crystallization for OTP films employing caps with smoother surfaces. Given this fact, a possible mechanism accounting for the improved quality of OTP films by HCM crystallization is primarily proposed. Normally, there are some residual DMSO molecules in the precursor OTP film, as revealed by the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) given in Fig. 3(j) and S8.† These DMSO molecules will evaporate simultaneously when the substrate temperature is elevated from room temperature to the thermal annealing temperature. For conventional crystallization, the evaporation of residual DMSO molecules is very fast; this induces fast nucleation and high nucleation density,20,26,34,37,40 resulting in OTP films with small grain sizes, as shown schematically in the upper portion of Fig. 3(k). When the cap is introduced, namely HCM crystallization, the evaporation rate of DMSO molecules is significantly slowed; this can suppress the number of nucleation sites, resulting in the formation of large grains, as illustrated in the bottom portion of Fig. 3(k).20,40 Considering that a smoother cap surface can reduce the evaporation rate of DMSO molecules, an OTP film with a larger average grain size can be controllably obtained with a smoother cap. In addition, it should be noted that the evaporated DMSO molecules can be absorbed by the homogeneous cap. During the subsequent thermal annealing, they re-evaporate slowly from the cap and condense on the surface of the OTP sample, in which a simple dynamic near-equilibrium may exist.26 This situation is similar to liquid phase sintering,41 which has been proved to be important to not only reduce the density of grain boundaries but also to avoid non-stoichiometric compositions in thin films.26,33 Meanwhile, DMSO droplets form locally at the interface gap between the cap and OTP film when a heterogeneous cap such as compact TiO2 is used, partially due to its super-wetting properties with DMSO (Fig. S9†). The formed DMSO droplets hinder the nucleation in these local sites, leading to the growth of pinholes in the film, as revealed in Fig. 3(h).

The optical properties of the HCM crystallized OTP film and the control sample deposited on insulating glass substrates were further investigated. Fig. 4(a) shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra from the measured transmission and reflection spectra provided in Fig. S10.† Obviously, similar to the control sample, the HCM crystallized OTP film exhibits wide absorption of light, with spectra extended over the whole UV-Vis-NIR range. Slightly higher absorption can be identified for the HCM crystallized OTP sample in the wavelengths of 600 nm to the absorption onset, which is primarily due to its better film quality due to the similar thickness of about 350 nm for the two films, as shown in Fig. 1(e) and (f).14,33 Moreover, lower reflectance in the wavelengths around 800 nm can be observed for the HCM crystallized OTP sample, as presented in Fig. S10(b).† This is a typical feature of light scattering by large micrometersized OTP particles and further verifies the enlarged grains in the film. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the studied samples are given in Fig. 4(b). A clear emission peak at ∼770 nm originating from the interband radiative recombination of photo-induced charge carriers can be detected for both samples, which is in agreement with the bandgap of the OTP material.1 In comparison, the PL intensity of the HCM crystallized OTP film is stronger than that of the control sample, which indicates that there are fewer defect sites in the film.18,37,42 To recognize this difference, we performed confocal laser scanning microscopy measurements, which can reveal the spatial distribution of PL emission sites in the film.42,43 As shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d), the emission site density is uniform for both films, which further indicates their excellent morphology homogeneity. In contrast, the emission site density for HCM crystallized OTP film is obviously higher than that of the control sample, revealing that there are fewer defects across the entire HCM crystallized OTP film.37,43 The fewer defects are mainly due to the fact that the HCM crystallized OTP film possesses larger grains coupled with a smaller grain boundary density, higher crystallinity, and lower iodide deficiency.
 Fig. 4  (a) Normalized UV-vis absorption spectra and (b) room-temperature steady-state PL spectra of the HCM crystallized OTP film and the control sample prepared by conventional crystallization on insulating substrates, respectively. For the PL measurements, the sample was excited from the side of the insulating substrate. (c and d) Confocal scanning PL images of (c) the HCM crystallized OTP film and (d) the control sample on insulating glass substrates. The scanning step was 200 nm, and the dwell time at each pixel is 100 ms. (e and f) Normalized transient PL spectra of the corresponding samples (e) on insulating glass substrates and (f) sandwiched within carrier selective transport layers of compact TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD (HTM). The inset shows the possible consumption path of the photo-induced charge carriers. 
Transient PL decay measurement was utilized to investigate the diffusion properties of photo-induced charge carriers in the OTP films, as given in Fig. 4(e). The decay spectrum was fitted with a double-exponential function of time t: F(t) = Aiet/ti; i = 1, 2, where Ai is a prefactor and ti is the time constant.44 The average minority carrier lifetime (tave) was derived to be 62.7 ns for the HCM crystallized OTP film and 46.7 ns for the control sample with Ai and ti according to the equation tave = Aiti2/Aiti; i = 1, 2. This result further verifies the reduced defect density in the HCM crystallized OTP film. Moreover, a longer charge carrier lifetime means a larger charge carrier diffusion length due to the similar thickness of the films.45,46 Combined with the reduced defects in the HCM crystallized OTP film, it can thus be concluded that this film possesses better transport properties for charge carriers in contrast to the control sample.45–47 The interfacial transfer property of the charge carriers can be probed by means of PL quenching measurements. As illustrated in Fig. 4(f), the PL decay process was dramatically accelerated for both samples when the OTP film was sandwiched within the selective charge transport layers of compact TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD. The decay lifetime was calculated to be 0.9 ns for the HCM crystallized OTP film and 2.3 ns for the control sample. The obviously shorter lifetime for the HCM crystallized OTP film indicates a more efficient transfer of charge carriers across the TiO2/OTP and OTP/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces.20,44,45 The better transport and interfacial transfer of charge carriers in the HCM crystallized OTP film may be related to the vertically aligned grain boundaries and the preferred (110) orientation of grains in the film. This is because the [110] facet normal is along the direction perpendicular to the substrate for the OTP film.20 Namely, most of the charge carriers can be efficiently transported and transferred across the OTP film in the single crystal grains and are not required to cross any grain boundaries before being collected by selective contacts.17,20,32–34,48
To evaluate the influence of the improved film quality on the device performance, two groups of planar-heterojunction solar cells were fabricated based on the HCM crystallized OTP film and the control sample with the most common cell configuration of FTO/TiO2/OTP/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). To rule out the possibility of experimental error for evaluation of the cell performance, 20 cells for each group were fabricated. Fig. 5(b) presents the corresponding PCE distributions of the cells under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 recorded at reverse scan with a scan rate of 158 mV s−1. It can be seen that the PCE values for all the cells with HCM crystallized OTP films are higher than those of the cells with control samples. The statistical average PCE value is 17.87% for the cells with HCM crystallized OTP films and 13.84% for the cells with control samples, which indicates an almost 30% enhancement in PCE for the cells with HCM crystallized OTP films. This great enhancement is mainly due to the significantly suppressed non-radiative recombination in the devices as a result of the reduced defects in the HCM crystallized OTP films.33,47–49 This is because an increasing number of experimental and theoretical results indicate that, as with other thin-film PV devices,18,50 the primary energy loss in perovskite solar cells originates from the non-radiative recombination of photon-generated charge carriers at the formed trap states by crystal defects in the polycrystalline OTP films.48,49,51

(e) Representative scan-rate-dependent J–V curves of the cell with HCM crystallized OTP film under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2. (f) Steady-state photocurrent and PCE outputs of the cell with the HCM crystallized OTP sample. 
To further distinguish the improvement of the PCEs, the typical J–V curves for each group of cells were recorded at forward scan and reverse scan under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and are given in Fig. 5(c) and (d). The detailed summary of PV performance parameters, including short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE, are given in Table 1. In addition to the PCE, all other performance parameters are enhanced to varying degrees for the device with HCM crystallized OTP film. The enhancement of FF is especially prominent. Therefore, we further counted the FF of all the concerned devices, as given in Fig. S11.† It can be seen that high FF can be reproducibly achieved in the devices with HCM crystallized OTP films, which is mainly attributed to the increased transport and transfer of charge carriers along the direction perpendicular to the substrate in the devices.20,52 In addition, the device with HCM crystallized OTP film shows less pronounced photocurrent hysteresis as well as a low dependence of PCE on the scan rate (Fig. 5(e)). So far, the mechanism underlying the photocurrent hysteresis is still under debate. Even so, a general phenomenon observed by many groups is that lower photocurrent hysteresis is associated with better quality OTP film which contains fewer trap states originating from either inherent defects in the bulk or from grain boundaries.53,54 In particular, Huang et al.55 recently found that the grain boundaries dominate the ion migration process in polycrystalline OTP films and account for the unique photocurrent hysteresis behaviour of perovskite solar cells. It is thus inferred that the reduced hysteresis in the device with HCM crystallized OTP film is likely to result from the lower number of defects, such as grain boundaries. It should be noted that further investigation concerning the photocurrent hysteresis should be undertaken because the significantly reduced defects in the OTP film in the present case do not appear to fully eliminate the hysteresis phenomenon. To examine the realistic PCE of the device with HCM crystallized OTP film, the photocurrent values were recorded as a function of time at a forward bias near its maximum output power point. As given in Fig. 5(f), the photocurrent density stabilized within seconds to approximately 20.04 mA cm−2 at 0.862 V, yielding a stabilized PCE of around 17.27%. All the above results indicate that the HCM crystallization strategy for realizing high-quality OTP films with enlarged grains as well as vertically aligned grain boundaries, preferred (110) orientation, high crystallinity, and proper stoichiometry can be a facile and useful method to fabricate high efficiency planar-heterojunction solar cells.

Conclusions
We have presented a facile and effective HCM crystallization strategy to manipulate the nucleation and growth dynamics of polycrystalline OTP films. With this strategy, which features a relatively wide processing window for OTP materials and wide applicability, high-quality OTP films with large grains, vertically aligned grain boundaries, preferred (110) orientation, excellent crystallinity, and proper stoichiometry can be successfully obtained by controlling the surface roughness of the cap. Planar-heterojunction solar cells incorporating these desired OTP films yield a promising average PCE of 17.87%, showing a dramatic enhancement of approximately 30% compared with the devices with control samples. In particular, large FFs can be routinely achieved in these high efficiency devices. This superior performance can be mainly assigned to the low non-radiative recombination as well as the excellent transport and transfer characters of the charge carriers in the devices as a result of the improved quality of the OTP films.
Experimental
Unless otherwise mentioned, all of the reagents and materials were commercially available and were used without any purification. A detailed description can be found in our previous work.18,44 To prepare the precursor OTP film, a compact TiO2 layer was firstly coated on a pre-cleaned FTO substrate via the commonly used spin-coating route. Then, the precursor OTP film was coated on the TiO2 layer via a solvent engineering assisted one-step spin-coating route. In detail, 50 μL premixed solution containing 160 mg CH3NH3I, 461 mg PbI2, 78 mg DMSO and 600 mg DMF were dropped on the substrate and the substrate was then spun at 4500 rpm for 20 s. Within the first 6 s of spinning, 0.5 mL anhydrous diethyl ether was dropped continuously on the substrate. Thus, the precursor OTP film was obtained. To prepare the homogeneous OTP cap, this precursor OTP film was transferred to a hot plate with a pre-heated temperature of 100 °C. After being heated for 10 min, the film was cooled to room temperature and the crystallized OTP cap was obtained. For HCM crystallization, the precursor OTP film was transferred to a hot plate with a pre-heated temperature of 40 °C, where the pre-synthesized crystallized OTP cap was placed face-to-face with the film simultaneously. Then, the temperature of the hot plate was increased to 100 °C. After being heated for 15 min, the cap was removed. The sample was then removed from the hot plate. Thus, the HCM crystallized OTP film was obtained. An OTP film crystallized with the same heat treatment process but without the use of the homogeneous OTP cap, namely by conventional crystallization, was also prepared as a control sample.
To prepare the OTP cap by the two-step spin-coating method, a mesoporous TiO2 layer was firstly deposited on the compact TiO2 coated FTO glass substrate by spin-coating of the TiO2 paste diluted with ethanol at 1:4 by weight at 5000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 40 min in air. Then, 50 μL of 1 M PbI2 solution in DMF was dropped on the mesoporous TiO2 layer with a pre-heated temperature of 50 °C and the substrate was spun at 6000 rpm for 30 s. After drying at 95 °C for 15 min, 0.5 mL CH3NH3I solution in isopropanol (IPA) with a concentration of 7.5 mg mL−1 or 10.0 mg mL−1 was loaded on the sample for 25 s (loading time), followed by spinning at 4000 rpm for 40 s and drying at 95 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was washed with IPA and re-dried at 100 °C for 2 min. Thus, the two-step spin-coating deposited cap was obtained. The compact TiO2 cap sample was prepared by spin-coating of 30 μL TiO2 sol on a pre-cleaned FTO glass substrate at 3000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 480 °C for 60 min in air.
For the solar cell fabrication, the HTM layer was deposited on the OTP film by spin-coating of 100 μL premixed precursor solution of 40 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 14 mL 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 9 μL Li-bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1) in 0.5 mL chlorobenzene at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the Ag contact electrode with an active area of 0.09 cm2 was deposited by the thermal evaporation method. A detailed description of the performance measurement of the cells can be found in our previous work.24
