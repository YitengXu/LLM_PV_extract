    , Accepted 31st May 2022First published on 1st June 2022AbstractOn the basis of first-principles calculations, we constructed a two-dimensional (2D) α-As/α-AsP van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) to study the structural stability, and electronic and optical properties. Our results show that the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH displays indirect semiconductor characteristics with a band gap of 0.86 eV. Furthermore, it exhibits anisotropic properties and a high light absorption coefficient of up to 106 cm−1 in the ultraviolet region. Our predicted photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH reaches 21.30%, which is higher than those of blue-AsP/CdSe (13%), GeSe/AsP (16%), and As/tetracyanonaphtho-quinodimethane (TCNNQ) (20%). By applying an in-plane strain in the range from −6% to 6%, the band structure of the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH can be effectively tuned. In particular, under a uniaxial strain of −2% along the x-axis (2% along the y-axis), a transition from indirect to direct in the band structure occurs, while when applying a biaxial strain of −4% a transition from a semiconductor to a metal can be realized. These results indicate that the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH has potential applications in optoelectronic devices and solar cells.
I. Introduction
As an exceptional example of 2D materials, graphene has attracted much attention due to its high mobility and outstanding mechanical, thermal and optical properties.1–3 Nevertheless, lacking an intrinsic band gap4,5 limits its further applications in the semiconductor industry. Inspired by the discovery of graphene, other 2D new materials have been explored, such as transition metal dichalcogenides,6,7 silicene,8 phosphorene,9,10 arsenene11 and so on. It was reported that phosphorene possesses a puckered structure with high mobility,10 which can be used in field-effect transistors.12 However, one drawback of phosphorene is that it is easily oxidized when exposed to air.13 For this reason, many techniques were used to improve the properties of materials, such as adsorption adatoms, doping, adding an electric field, applying strain, constructing a heterostructure, etc.14 Among the abovementioned techniques, heterostructure construction can overcome the shortcomings of its component material while retaining the advantages of its components. This provides a new way to explore high-performance electronic devices15,16 or optoelectronic devices.17
2D α-arsenene (α-As) has an ideal stability under ambient conditions.18 It was reported that 2D α-As experienced an indirect-to-direct transition of the band gap under strain,19 which has prospects to be applied in light-emitting diodes and solar cells. Moreover, it was proved that 2D α-As exhibits high carrier mobility11 and tunable optical properties.20 Using a plasma assisted method, multi-layer buckled arsenene nanoribbons can be synthesized on the InAs substrate.21 The arsenene monolayers can be obtained by reducing the layer of buckled arsenene22 or fabricated on the Ag(111) surface.23 For the same V group compound, the α-AsP monolayer possesses unique properties such as high carrier mobility and good mechanical flexibility.24–28 It was reported that α-AsP has a suitable band gap that can be used in solar cells,27 detectors of the infrared spectrum at room temperature29,30 and field effect transistors.31
For the van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH), much progress has been achieved based on arsenene32,33 and AsP.34–36 For example, previous studies indicated that As/MoS2, As/tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), and As/tetracyanonaphtho-quinodimethane (TCNNQ) vdWHs show an excellent photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 20%.33 The reported PCE of the blue-AsP/CdSe vdWH is 13%.34 Zeng's team designed a monolayer AsP-based exciton solar cell with a PCE of 22.1%.27 It was also reported that the PCE of the GeSe/AsP heterostructure can be increased by applying strains.36 Motivated by the above mentioned progress on V group elements and good lattice matching between the α-As monolayer and α-AsP monolayer, in this paper we proposed the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH based on first-principles calculations. We found that the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH possesses anisotropic optical properties and a high PCE. We also found that applying an in-plane strain can tune the band structure of the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH.
II. Computational method
In this work, VASP37,38 was chosen to carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For the exchange–correlation interaction, the PBE method of the GGA39 was employed. Projector-augmented-wave (PAW)40,41 potentials are selected to describe the electron–ion interaction. The plane wave is described by an cutoff energy of 500 eV in all calculations. After the structural optimization, the total energy on each atom should reach 10−6 eV. At the same time, the force on each atom is converged to 0.01 eV Å−1. The 2D Brillouin-zone region was sampled by a grid of 13 × 13 × 1. A vacuum layer is vital to neglect the interaction between the atoms in neighbouring supercells. We set a vacuum layer along the z-direction larger than 20 Å. The DFT-D3 functional42 approach was applied to represent the vdW interaction. Because the band gap calculated by the PBE method is usually underestimated, the HSE06 hybrid functional43 method was applied to the band structure calculations. The computing formula of the formation energy (Ef) can be expressed as follows:Ef = EAB − EA − EBwhere EAB, EA and EB represent the total energies of the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH, 2D α-As and 2D α-AsP, respectively.
The work function can be evaluated by the following equation:Φ = Evac − EFwhere Evac represents the energy level that is the stationary electron in a vacuum close surface, while the Fermi energy is denoted by EF.
The plane-averaged charge density is calculated by using the following formula:  where ρAB, ρA and ρB are the charge densities at the (x, y, z) point of the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH, 2D α-As and 2D α-AsP, respectively.
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) was evaluated using the Scharber method,44 where the PCE can be obtained from following formula:  where Edg is the value of the donor band gap and ΔEC represents the CBO (conduction band offset). P(ħω) expresses the AM 1.5 solar energy flux.
According to the deformation potential theory, which was first developed by Bardeen and Shockley,45 the calculation of the carrier mobility of the 2D materials is expressed as follows:46  
The effective mass along the direction of transmission is denoted by m*. T and kB are the temperature (300 K) and Boltzmann constant, respectively. E1 denotes the deformation potential constant, and md is defined as . C2D represents the flexible modulus, which can be obtained from C2D = 2[∂2E/∂(Δl/l0)2]/S0.
III. Results and discussion
Both 2D α-As and 2D α-AsP have a puckered orthorhombic lattice. After optimization, the lattice constants of 2D α-As and 2D α-AsP are a = 3.68 Å, b = 4.75 Å and a = 3.50 Å, b = 4.69 Å. Our obtained lattice constants are consistent with previous reported results.19,20,27 After the construction of the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH, the lattice mismatch along zigzag directions and that along armchair directions are 5.01% and 1.27%, respectively. An analogous puckered shape and a tiny lattice mismatch assured the feasibility of the proposed 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH. In the heterostructure, previous experimental47–49 and theoretical50–52 studies have proved that a lattice mismatch less than 10% was acceptable. Therefore, we construct the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH by stacking 2D α-AsP on 2D α-As.
We built four different high-symmetry stacking configurations to explore the possible structures of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. The different stacking patterns can be obtained by rotating angles or slipping along the lattice.53,54 Four types of stacking structures are named AA, AB, AC and AD stacking, which are indicated in Fig. 1. AA, i.e. α-AsP covers the top of α-As. The AB staggered stacking is on the basis of AA-stacking, and α-AsP shifts 1/2 unit-cell along the x direction. AC is a type of mirror-symmetric stacking, assuming that the mirror is placed between the two layers, which can be regarded as rotating α-AsP 180° along the y-axis on the basis of AA-stacking. Similar to that in AC stacking, AD stacking is the rotation of 180° along the y-axis of α-AsP on the basis of AB stacking. The formation energy (Ef) is used to examine the energetic stability of the proposed stacking configurations. The calculated formation energy values of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH are listed in Table 1. The geometric parameters and the lattice constant are also listed in Table 1. From the data in Table 1, we can find that all the stacking configurations are stable with a negative Ef and the difference in energy is minor. The AB-stacking structure possesses the lowest negative Ef of −1.24 eV. Therefore, only the most stable pattern of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH structure (i.e. AB-stacking) is discussed in the subsequent discussions. In this AB-stacking configuration, the obtained interfacial distance between α-As and α-AsP at equilibrium is 3.09 Å. In addition, the optimized lattice constants a and b in this geometry are 3.61 Å and 4.61 Å, respectively.

A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to verify the thermodynamic stability of the AB-stacking configuration of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the energy is preferred to be converged with small oscillates, and no significant change of the atomic positions and lattice at 300 K. It implies that the AB-stacking of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH is thermodynamically stable. Meanwhile, further validation on the stability is the phonon dispersion without an imaginary frequency, which is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† To investigate the electronic properties of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH, we further calculated the band structure of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH using the HSE06 functional. For comparison, the band structures of α-As and α-AsP are also shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. By our calculation, 2D α-As exhibits an indirect band gap of 1.36 eV, while 2D α-AsP possesses a direct band gap of 1.56 eV. Our obtained band gap is agreed well with previous reports.27,55 For the α-As/α-AsP vdWH, we calculated its energy band and processed it using the post-processing tool VASPKIT56 to obtain the projected energy band. As shown in Fig. 2(c), it exhibits semiconducting properties with an indirect band gap of 0.86 eV, which is smaller than those of 2D α-As and 2D α-AsP. Detailed analysis indicates that the VBM (valence band maximum) is originated from the α-As layer (blue line), while the CBM (conduction band minimum) is localized on α-As and α-AsP monolayers (blue and red lines), respectively. Our further analysis indicates that 96% of the VBM is from the contribution of α-As, while the remaining 4% comes from α-AsP. In the CBM, the difference between the proportions of the two materials is minor, in which α-As and α-AsP are 56% and 44%, respectively. Comparing Fig. 2(a)–(c), it can be concluded that owing to the interlayer interaction, the band of the monolayer has been reconstructed to form a new band of the heterostructure, while the electronic properties of the monolayer are well retained in the synthetic heterostructure.

The sky-blue arrow represents the path from the VBM to the CBM. (d) Total energy fluctuations in the MD simulations at 300 K. The insets show the snapshots of the structures after 10000 fs MD running. 
The impact of each monolayer on the electronic characteristics of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH can be analyzed through PDOS (partial density of states). Therefore, we calculate the PDOS of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The electronic states of α-As has domination in the VBM, while the CBM is contributed by both the α-As and α-AsP electronic states together. In addition, in order to clarify the change in the electronic structure of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH, it is necessary to calculate the charge density corresponding to the VBM and CBM, which are manifested in Fig. 3(b). It can be found that the electronic states of the VBM are almost completely contributed by α-As, whereas the electronic states of the CBM are formed by both α-As and α-AsP (the specific gravity of α-As is 56%).

The inset shows the corresponding 3D isosurface of the electron density difference (blue and yellow areas represent the electron depletions and electron accumulation, respectively). The isosurface is set to (e per bohr3). (d) Plane averaged potential drop along the z-direction of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. 
To explore the electronic states at the interface between α-As and α-AsP in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH, the plane-averaged charge density difference Δρ is plotted in Fig. 3(c). The illustration exhibits the homologous three-dimensional isosurface of the electron density difference (electron depletions and accumulation are indicated in blue and yellow, respectively). It can be found that the charge depletion appears near the side of the α-As monolayer and the accumulation appears on the side of the α-AsP monolayer. Further Bade charge analysis was performed to explore the charge transfer between α-As and α-AsP. Our analysis indicates that only 0.0064 electrons per unit cell is transferred from α-As to α-AsP. This means that the minor charge transfer occurred at the interface area. Similar charge transfers were also reported in the literature, such as in the vdWHs of GeSe/AsP,36 BP/β-AsP,57 GeSe/SnSe,58etc. This illustrates that the interlayer coupling effect results in a redistribution of the charge at the α-As/α-AsP vdWH interface. The charge redistribution causes the existence of a built-in electric-field in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. It is one of the keys to separate electrons and holes in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. In addition, the direction of the electron flow at equilibrium depends on the value of the work function. According to the definition, the work functions of the monolayer α-As, monolayer α-AsP and α-As/α-AsP vdWH are 5.05 eV, 5.20 eV and 4.75 eV, respectively. Because the value of α-AsP is larger than that of α-As, it is imposed that the electrons would flow from the α-As layer to the α-AsP layer. The charge transfer usually implies that the interaction between layers becomes stronger, which results in a smaller band gap. The potential decrease between the monolayer α-As and monolayer α-AsP in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH is 2.24 eV, which is indicated in Fig. 3(d). In other words, the electrostatic potential in the layer of α-As is higher than that in the α-AsP layer.
Optical absorption is usually utilized to describe the properties of photovoltaic materials. Previous research has shown that the monolayer α-As and the monolayer α-AsP possess superior optical properties, so it is essential to investigate the optical properties of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. The calculated results are indicated in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a) and (b) indicate the calculated optical absorption along the zigzag and the armchair directions, respectively. One can observe that the monolayer α-As and monolayer α-AsP show strong optical absorption from the visible region to the ultraviolet light region (UV region). It is noted that the absorption in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH is higher than that in its components both along the zigzag and the armchair directions. In particular, in the UV region, the optical absorption peaks in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH can reach an order of 106 cm−1. Meanwhile, compared with the optical absorption peak along the armchair direction, the absorption coefficient along the zigzag direction is relatively high. Moreover, the light absorption coefficient of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH is improved at a wavelength beyond 800 nm along the armchair direction, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b). These results indicate the anisotropic characteristic of optical absorption in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. Our result implies that the α-As/α-AsP vdWH has potential applications for ultra-sensitive photodetectors.
 Fig. 4  The optical absorption coefficient of the monolayer α-AsP, monolayer α-As and α-As/α-AsP vdWH is calculated along the (a) zigzag direction and (b) armchair direction. 
The band offset is usually a key parameter in material and device design. In Fig. 5(a), the band edges of the monolayers α-As and α-AsP with an absolute vacuum level as the reference are indicated. On the basis of the calculation, it is found that the VBM of 2D α-As is higher than that of α-AsP, while the CBM of 2D α-As is also higher than that of α-AsP, which implies that the band structure of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH exhibits a type-II band alignment. With this alignment, α-AsP acts as an acceptor in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH, while α-As acts as a donor. Meanwhile, the CBO and VBO (valence band offset) are expressed by ΔEC and ΔEV. The CBO is 0.105 eV and the VBO is 0.299 eV in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. Using the Scharber method,44 we obtained the calculated PCE, which is shown in Fig. 5(b). The PCE depends on the CBO and the donor's band gap. According to the equation of the PCE, the calculated results of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH has an estimated value of about 21.3%. The PCE in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH is higher than that in many other heterostructures, such as blue-AsP/CdSe (13%),34 GeSe/AsP (16%),36 and is comparable to the bilayer α-AsP/GaN (22.1%).27 It implies that our designed α-As/α-AsP vdWH is a promising candidate material to be used in photovoltaic cells.

IV. Carrier mobility
An important index for photovoltaic applications is the carrier mobility. The calculated carrier mobilities of α-As, α-AsP and α-As/α-AsP vdWH are listed in Table 2. According to the listed values in Table 2, it is found that the mobilities of α-As and α-AsP are anisotropic, which is identical with previous reports.27,59 By our calculations, we found that the electron mobility in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH is up to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the hole mobility is about 102 cm2 V−1 s−1, which exhibits a relatively low value when compared with the mobility in their monolayers. In general, the mobility in the α-As/α-AsP vdWH is isotropic. Interestingly, both the deformation potential and elastic modulus are enhanced. The high deformation potential may cause the low mobility of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. The in-plane stiffness C2D of the monolayer of α-As or α-AsP is smaller than that of the heterostructure. It implies that the heterostructure becomes difficult to be deformed.

V. Strain effect
External strain has been known as one of the effective strategies to modulate the photoelectrical properties of 2D materials. An in-plane biaxial strain (εxy) and uniaxial strain (εx orεy) from −6% to 6% are applied to tune the photoelectrical properties of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. The formula for the in-plane strain is , where a(b) is the geometry parameters after the strain is applied, while a0(b0) is the original lattice. As shown in Fig. 6, the band structure of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH (PBE method is used) can be tuned by applying in-plane strain. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the total energy of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH is increased under both tensile and compressive strains. This phenomena is similar to the energy changes of SnSe/SnTe and GeSe/SnS under applied strain.60,61 It can be also found that the relationship between the energy and strain is a consummate quadratic function, demonstrating that the structure has flexibility, and external strains are all amongst the elastic limit, so it has reversibility. We also found that uniaxial strain has less influence on energy than that under biaxial strain. The band gaps of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH under −6% to 6% in-plane biaxial and uniaxial strains are indicated in Fig. 6(b). Along the zigzag (x-axis) direction, when the strain reaches −2%, it exhibits a characteristic of the direct band-gap. As the strain is increased from 2% to 4% along the armchair (y-axis) direction, an indirect–direct transition is found. Under the biaxial strain, when the compressive strain is increased to 4%, the band gap gradually decreases until it reaches zero. As a result, a semiconductor–metal transition occurs.

(c) Projected band structures of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH under 2% biaxial tensile strain. 
To further analyze the variation of the CBM and VBM under the applied in-plane strain, band structures under some particular strains are plotted in Fig. 7. For the intrinsic α-As/α-AsP vdWH, its indirect band gap is shown in Fig. 2(c). If applying strain along the zigzag direction (see Fig. 7(a)), the CBM under compressive strain is always located at the Γ point while the VBM is changed from a point on the Y–Γ path to the Γ point. Therefore, under −2% strain, the indirect-to-direct transition in the band structure occurs. Simultaneously, there is a direct band gap within −2% to –6%. However, distinctive changes appear under tensile strain. In the tensile strain along the zigzag direction (see Fig. 7(a)), the VBM always situates at the Y–Γ path while the CBM is changed from the Γ point to the Y–Γ path. If we have applied strain along the armchair direction (see Fig. 7(b)), the CBM under compressive strain is changed from the Γ point to the X–Γ path while the VBM is located at the Y–Γ path. The variation of applying the tensile strain along the armchair direction is same as that applying the compressive strain along the zigzag direction. Therefore, we can find that the direct band gap is also maintained among 2–6%. Compared with uniaxial strain, the biaxial tensile strain has a larger influence on the VBM and CBM of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. As the compression strain increases, it can be found that the CBM is changed from the Γ point to the Γ–X path and continues to be decreased. When the applying strain reaches −4%, as shown in Fig. 7(c), it is found that the conduction band crosses over the Fermi level, while the valence band continues to be increased in energy and passes through the Fermi level. The CBM under tensile strain is changed from the Γ point to the Y–Γ path while the VBM is changed from the Y–Γ path to the Γ–X path. Interestingly, as the biaxial tensile strain reaches 2%, the transition from the quasi-II (I) to II band arrangement can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 6(c). Therefore, the electron–hole pair recombination is slowed down. Our results show that strains can significantly tune the band gap of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH.

VI. Conclusion
In this paper, based on first-principles calculations, we systematically examined the properties of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH, including its stability, electronic properties and optical properties. We found that the 2D α-As/α-AsP vdWH displays indirect semiconductor characteristics and its band gap value is 0.86 eV. It exhibits anisotropic properties and a high light absorption coefficient. The light absorption coefficient reaches 106 cm−1 in the ultraviolet region. The predicted photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH reaches 21.30%, which is higher than those of blue-AsP/CdSe (13%), GeSe/AsP (16%), and As/tetracyanonaphtho-quinodimethane (TCNNQ) (20%). By applying a strain from −6 to 6%, we study the tunable band structure of the α-As/α-AsP vdWH. It is found that under biaxial strain, a transition from a quasi type-II (I) to a type-II band arrangement can be realized, which facilitates the separation between electrons and holes. At the same time, a uniaxial strain of −2% in the x-axis (2% in the y-axis) can realize the band gap transition from indirect to direct, while a biaxial strain of −4% can realize a transition from a semiconductor to a metal. Our results show that the α-As/α-AsP vdWH has potential applications in optoelectronic devices and solar cells.
