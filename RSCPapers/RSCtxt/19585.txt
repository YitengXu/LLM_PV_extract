    , Accepted 4th April 2016First published on 6th April 2016AbstractMethylammonium lead-iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, hereafter referred to as MAPbI3) perovskite has emerged as a dazzling nova in the solar cell realm. To date, the surface physics of these materials is still puzzling, but in this work, we demonstrate that the optical dynamics in MAPbI3 is primarily determined by the surface states. Pb dangling bonds on the surface of MAPbI3 introduce shallow electronic states. The carrier localization effect for these electronic states is rather weak as the lifetimes of the carriers on the iodine-poor surface are comparative to those in the interior region of MAPbI3. In contrast, rich-iodine on the surface of MAPbI3 induces deep trap centers for the carriers, which are detrimental to long carrier diffusion lengths. It is further proved that the surface passivation, which surprisingly prolongs the carrier diffusion lengths, mainly works on the rich-iodine on the surface rather than the Pb dangling bonds. This better understanding of the surface physics could provide essential information for improving the performance of photoelectronic devices based on MAPbI3 perovskites.
Introduction
Methylammonium lead-iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, hereafter referred to as MAPbI3) represents a prototype system for photovoltaic applications and is attracting intense research efforts due to its impressive performance in solar cells (SCs).1–5 In order to realize increasingly efficient perovskite solar cells, it is of vital importance to identify the pivotal factors that determine the advanced photovoltaic properties of perovskite semiconductors. Although the carrier transport parameters, such as mobility and bulk carrier lifetime, show sufficient characteristics, few articles have been published focusing on the surface recombination, which can have a major impact on solar cell performances.6,7
Recent research has suggested that the diffusion length of the carriers in a polycrystalline MAPbI3 thin film can exceed 1 μm.8 The long diffusion length comes from the high mobility and long lifetime of the carriers,9,10 but could also be affected by other factors, such as (1) the special electronic structures,11 (2) the shallow defect levels,12 and (3) the low bimolecular recombination probabilities in MAPbI3.9,13 It is believed that surface charge trapping, which is rarely reported, could lead to an overestimation of the diffusion length.14 Recently, Buin, et al. reported that an iodine-poor growth environment is the key for high SC performance, since MAPbI3 films under iodine-rich conditions are prone to a high density of electronic traps.15 However, the use of CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, which are commonly fabricated in an I-rich environment, produces a significantly improved performance for the resulting SCs.8,16,17 Besides, some theoretical reports predicted that the defects in MAPbI3 might introduce no in-gap trap states,18,19 whereas more and more experimental results confirm the presence of in-gap traps in MAPbI3,20–25 making this issue controversial. In particular, it is believed that the hysteresis in perovskite SCs is partially related to surface trap states.25,26 Therefore, identifying and assigning these localized in-gap states, which may dramatically affect the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PV materials, are of great significance and urgency.
In this paper, we first use an improved sequential deposition method to fabricate I-poor and I-rich MAPbI3 samples, calling these #A and #B, respectively. Then, we used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the chemical composition on the surface of #A and #B, which accorded well with our expectations. Afterwards, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and wavelength-dependent TRPL were used to study the luminescent dynamics in the samples. To further elucidate the surface states of MAPbI3, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and Lewis base passivation4,25 were used to passivate the MAPbI3 surface. The passivation effect of PMMA was confirmed by temperature-variable PL measurement. Compared to the I-poor samples, surface passivation can produce a similar or even stronger luminescence from I-rich MAPbI3 samples. We did not find evidence that rich-iodine in the bulk induced deep in-gap states. It is believed that the surface characteristics of MAPbI3 play a leading role in the optical properties.
Samples and experimental setup
Up to now, there have been several representative fabrication methods for perovskite MAPbI3, such as spin-coating,2,4,14 sequential deposition,27 and vacuum vapor deposition.3 Although spin-coating is the most widely used in the photovoltaic field, MAPbI3 from this method gives a wide spread of photoelectronic performances in the resulting devices because of its inhomogeneous surface morphologies. To solve this problem, Burschka et al. developed the sequential deposition method, which has a better control over the perovskite morphology.27 The resulting devices showed comparative performance with respect to their counterparts fabricated by the spin-coating route. In sequential deposition, MAPbI3 crystals are built by the insertion of MAI molecules into the PbI2 templates of the layered structure. Realization of the perfect stoichiometric equivalence of the two precursors could be the biggest challenge. However, it is certainly possible to form I-rich and I-poor MAPbI3, i.e., Samples #A and #B, respectively.
A modified method from the sequential deposition route
First, a PbI2 film on the silicon wafer was formed by spin-coating a 462 mg ml−2 (1 M) solution (at 70 °C) of PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Then, the PbI2 film was immersed in CH3NH3I solution in dimethylcarbinol (DMC) for 3 min.

#A. 
As MAPbI3 was fabricated, we swiftly shifted the sample from MAI solution in DMC to excess DMC to wash away the un-bonded MAI in MAPbI3. The washing process was repeated several times. It was expected that the amount of bonded MAI molecules on the surface of MAPbI3 could be exfoliated by DMC washing, producing an I-poor surface of MAPbI3 due to its strong in-plane chemical bonding and weak out-of-plane bonding.28


#B. 
As MAPbI3 was fabricated in MAI solution in DMC, we directly moved the MAPbI3 to a spin-coater to remove the residual solvent by spinning. The as-fabricated #A and #B were subsequently annealed in air at 100 °C for 15 min to facilitate crystallization.


#C. 
Sample C was fabricated by spin-coating 10 mg ml−1 PMMA solution in acetone on the surface of #B at a speed of 4000 rpm. To exclude the influence induced by acetone, we also spin-coated acetone on the surface of MAPbI3 with the same spinning parameters. It was found that acetone could hardly harm the MAPbI3 samples due to its volatile nature.

Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of #A and #B, respectively. XRD peaks assigned to the (110) and (220) diffractions at 14.32° and 28.64°, respectively, confirm the formation of a tetragonal perovskite structure with the lattice parameters of a = c = 8.76 Å and b = 13.38 Å. Both #A and #B gave a good crystallization quality. The calculated crystal size (D) from the Debye–Scherrer equation, , is larger than 100 nm, where the parameter K is a constant equaling 0.89, λ is the X-ray wavelength, and B is the full width at half maximum (FWHW) of the XRD peak at the diffraction angle θB. However, the surface morphology of #A is quite different from #B, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1, where it can be seen that #A has a porous surface with micro-structures, whereas #B tends to form continuous flat films.16 This fact suggests that #A has more grain boundaries, which are thought to be detrimental to the fluorescence lifetime. However, in our case, #A gave a long lifetime, as measured by TRPL, which will be discussed in the following. We thus expect that the surface states of MAPbI3 should be a first-order parameter for the long carrier diffusion distance.

Fig. 2(a) shows the XPS spectra of the core levels (CL) of Pb 5d, which is divided naturally into two peaks, including 5d5/2 and 5d3/2 for both samples. The fabrication methods for #A and #B are described in the ESI,† where #A was fabricated with an I-poor surface and #B surface with an I-rich one. The main difference of the Pb 5d CLs between #A and #B is the two shoulders located at 17.98 and 20.58 eV, which are due to the Pb–O bonds, as discussed in our previous reports.29 The enhanced Pb–O bonds in #A suggest that there are more Pb dangling bonds on the surface of #A than on #B, because Pb dangling bonds can create favorable conditions for coordination, or for bond formation with electron-rich molecules.4
 Fig. 2  (a) XPS spectra of the CLs of Pb 5d. The XPS peaks of Pb 5d5/2 and 5d3/2 with respect to I are located at 19.58 and 22.18 eV, respectively. The shoulders at 17.98 and 20.58 eV are related to Pb–O bonds. (b) XPS spectra of VBMs for #A and #B. There is an obvious energy shift for the VBMs between #A and #B. 

Fig. 2(b) shows the XPS spectra of the valence band maximum (VBM) for #A and #B. The VBM was determined by linear extrapolation, as shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The VBM of #A is located at around 1.3 eV, in agreement with recent work.21 By contrast, the VBM of #B is present at ∼1.13 eV, which is 0.17 eV lower than #A. The energy difference between #A and #B agrees well with previous theoretical estimations and the experimental results involving the I-rich and I-poor surface of MAPbI3.28,30,31 The agreement further confirms #A possesses a I-poor surface, whereas #B has a I-rich surface. We used a semi-logarithmic coordinate system in Fig. 2(b) to make a clear comparison between the VBMs of #A and #B. It was observed that both #A and #B show the trap states above the VBM, the density of which was approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the valence bands.18,21
We elaborated the surface characters of #A and #B, and conclude that #A has an I-poor surface, whereas #B's surface is I-rich. The physical picture of the surface states is shown in Fig. 3(a). In the following, we will discuss the optical properties of these two samples and give an in-depth analysis of the luminescence dynamics. A 405 nm pulsed laser beam was used as the excitation source. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the integrated intensity of the PL from #A (IA) is three times higher than that from #B (IB). Fig. 3(c) shows the normalized PL spectra from #A and #B. It is observed that the spectrum of A shows a slight red-shift compared to spectrum B. By contrast, the PL dynamics of #A and #B are quite different. On the one hand, as shown in Fig. 3(d), spectrum A shows single-exponential decay kinetics with a slow decay rate, while spectrum B decays much faster with multi-exponents; on the other hand, the lifetime of #A increases with the wavelength from 57 to ∼80 ns, while the lifetime of #B is basically homogeneous. Since the 405 nm laser beam has a very short penetration depth into MAPbI3 and only excites carriers near the surface, the wavelength-dependent lifetime of #A could be due to the carrier diffusion from the surface toward the interior region of MAPbI3 and the strong photon self-absorption effect in MAPbI3.32 The average lifetime of #A is 66.48 ns, whereas the average lifetime of #B is 18.16 ns. It should be mentioned here that as we increased the concentration of MAI precursors in DMC, the PL decayed even faster for #B. It is well known that deep traps working as Shockley–Read–Hall non-radiative centers are fatal to long electron–hole diffusion lengths.33 In light of the PL and XPS results, we believe that the deep trap assisted Shockley–Read–Hall non-radiative centers are correlated with excessive I on the surface of MAPbI3 (∼0.17 eV deep in the band gap).

The deep trap centers of the carriers mainly exist on the surface of MAPbI3, which can be demonstrated by deposition of a thin layer of PMMA on the surface of MAPbI3. Fig. 4(a) shows the SEM image of the profile section of MAPbI3 (#C), covered by a layer of PMMA with a thickness of ∼400 nm. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the tetragonal–orthorhombic phase transitions of both #B and #C take place at around 160 K, which matches well with previous reports.37,38 This fact suggests that PMMA only modifies the surface of MAPbI3 without changing the bulk crystal. However, as temperature decreases to lower than 120 K, #C shows a smaller red-shift of Peak_OII compared to #B. In light of our previous report, Peak_OII is mainly attributed to trap states related to recombination when the temperature is lower than 120 K. The smaller red-shift of Peak_OII shown in Fig. 4(b) and the enhanced intensity of Peak_OI (excitons-related transition) as illustrated by Fig. 4(c and d) suggest that the PMMA passivation can effectively delocalize the carriers captured by the deep trap centers. The passivation effect of PMMA is quite similar to that of thiophene and pyridine on MAPbI3 or MAPbI3−xClx.4,25 It is noted that the PL band centered at around 700 nm does not change with temperature, thus it is from the interface between PMMA and MAPbI3 rather than from bulk MAPbI3 and thus should be carefully avoided when the PL dynamics is studied. More discussions are provided in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The PL intensities for #B and #C are not comparative, and only the line width and the relative intensity of Peak_I to Peak_II are considered in this work.

Although PMMA could erode MAPbI3 perovskite crystal, the erosion only happens on the top layer of MAPbI3. (b) Variations of the PL of MAPbI3 are in the temperature range of tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition. Peak_T is from the near-band-edge (NBE) transition of MAPbI3,34,35 (c and d) PL spectra from Samples A and B at two typical temperatures. Peaks OI and OII are, respectively, from the exciton and trap states related to the recombination of orthorhombic MAPbI3.36 
To further illustrate the passivation effect of PMMA, we investigated the carrier recombination dynamics in MAPbI3 using the PL decay spectra. To exclude the superposition of the broad band at around 700 nm from the MAPbI3/PMMA interface, as shown in Fig. 5(a), here we chose a 635 nm pulsed laser to pump the sample as it offered a much deeper penetration depth compared to the 405 nm laser.6 The PL signal excited by the 405 nm laser mainly came from the region close to the surface of MAPbI3, whereas the PL spectra excited by the 635 nm laser was mainly from the internal MAPbI3. As shown in Fig. 5(b), Sample C exhibits a pronounced enhancement in PL intensity by a magnitude of 6 compared to #B. #B with a smoother surface compared to #A was beneficial for increasing the PL intensity as the surface is passivated. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the excitation of the 405 nm laser induces a slower PL decay compared to that by the 635 nm laser with the same excitation density (5 nJ cm−2). Fig. 5(d) shows a comparison of the decay spectra for #B and #C excited by a 635 nm laser. We can see that the transient spectrum of #B starts with a fast bi-exponential decay, followed by a slow single-exponential decay. In light of the carrier diffusion effect in MAPbI3, which has been carefully studied by Yamada et al.,32 it is inferred that 635 nm laser excitation will induce a diffusion of photo-generated carriers toward the surface because of the fast depletion of carriers on the surface of #B. If this theory holds, we can expect that the transient spectrum of #C would show a single-exponential decay as the surface of MAPbI3 is passivated by PMMA. As shown in Fig. 5(d), the decay curve of #C basically accorded with a single-exponential-decay model, with a mean square error factor (MSEF) of 0.97. The lifetime of the Sample C was prolonged by >3 times compared to that of #B. Since the carrier diffusion length, , where D is the diffusion constant and τ is the lifetime of the carriers, the carrier diffusion length was thus prolonged by almost two times.
 Fig. 5  PL spectra of #B (red) and #C (magenta) excited by (a) a 405 and (b) 635 nm pulsed laser, respectively. The broad band centered at around 700 nm in (a) comes from the interface between PMMA and MAPbI3. PMMA passivation could induce a significant enhancement in the PL intensity by a factor of 6. “I” in (b) denotes the integrated PL intensity. (c) TRPL spectra of #B excited by a 405 and 635 nm pulsed laser, respectively. (d) PL decay spectra of #B (red) and #C (magenta) by excitation of a 635 nm pulsed laser. 
The single-exponential decays of #A and #C suggest that the decay rate at the surface region is comparative to that in the interior region. This means that the surface states induced by Pb dangling bonds on the surface of #A are very shallow in the bandgap (could be <0.05 eV above the VBM33). Shallow traps have small ionization energies, which locate in the bandgap. The carriers localized in these shallow energy levels can easily transit to the valence band or the conduction band by thermal-energy excitation, thus they have a negligible influence on the luminescence properties of MAPbI3. The efficient luminescence from #A is mainly attributed to the shallow traps on the surface of MAPbI3. As #A is passivated by PMMA, the decay curve of #A exhibits a negligible change, as shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI.† We hence conclude that the passivation effect mainly works on iodine terminations rather than Pb dangling bonds. It was reported that negligible Cl segregation into the iodine-rich grain boundaries of MAPbI3 could result in a significant increase in the carrier transportation, and thus in the cell efficiency too.8,9,18,39 Our results facilitate a greater in-depth understanding of such a novel phenomenon. The performance of perovskite solar cells could be further promoted with the realization of an iodine-poor surface of MAPbI3.
Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated MAPbI3 samples with different stoichiometric ratios of two precursors through a modified sequential deposition route. This helped us to precisely identify the pivotal factors that affect carrier kinetics in MAPbI3. It was demonstrated that the first-order parameter that determines the carrier kinetics of MAPbI3 was the surface environment of the chemistry, rather than the physical morphologies. Iodine vacancies, which can be spontaneously passivated by oxygen, induce shallow electronic states within the bandgap, while iodine terminations introduce deep trap centers on the surface of MAPbI3. These deep trap centers can be effectively inactivated by PMMA passivation, manifesting that the Lewis acid/base passivation mainly works on iodine terminations rather than Pb dangling bonds. We should mention here that our work was performed without an external electric field. In working LED or PV devices, the surface character could be different because of the electron and hole accumulations at the interface between MAPbI3 and the contacting HTL layers. Nevertheless, our results could provide essential information for improving device performance based on halide perovskite semiconductors.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  XRD patterns of #A and #B (blue and red, respectively). Inset: Top view of the SEM images of #A and #B.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) XPS spectra of the CLs of Pb 5d. The XPS peaks of Pb 5d5/2 and 5d3/2 with respect to I are located at 19.58 and 22.18 eV, respectively. The shoulders at 17.98 and 20.58 eV are related to Pb–O bonds. (b) XPS spectra of VBMs for #A and #B. There is an obvious energy shift for the VBMs between #A and #B.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Surface terminations on (001) oriented MAPbI3. The left and right structures represent #A and #B, respectively. Schematic HOMO level alignments at the interface between #A and #B are also depicted. (b) PL intensity comparison of #A and #B. “I” represents the integrated PL intensity. (c) Normalized PL from #A (blue) and #B (red). We also give the PL lifetimes of wavelength dependence obtained from the single-exponential decay function. (d) TRPL at peak wavelength (765 nm) of the PL bands from #A and #B under excitation of a 405 nm pulsed laser.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Lateral view of Sample C, i.e., Sample B (∼500 nm MAPbI3) covered by a ∼400 nm PMMA layer. Although PMMA could erode MAPbI3 perovskite crystal, the erosion only happens on the top layer of MAPbI3. (b) Variations of the PL of MAPbI3 are in the temperature range of tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition. Peak_T is from the near-band-edge (NBE) transition of MAPbI3,34,35 (c and d) PL spectra from Samples A and B at two typical temperatures. Peaks OI and OII are, respectively, from the exciton and trap states related to the recombination of orthorhombic MAPbI3.36	 

 	Fig. 5  PL spectra of #B (red) and #C (magenta) excited by (a) a 405 and (b) 635 nm pulsed laser, respectively. The broad band centered at around 700 nm in (a) comes from the interface between PMMA and MAPbI3. PMMA passivation could induce a significant enhancement in the PL intensity by a factor of 6. “I” in (b) denotes the integrated PL intensity. (c) TRPL spectra of #B excited by a 405 and 635 nm pulsed laser, respectively. (d) PL decay spectra of #B (red) and #C (magenta) by excitation of a 635 nm pulsed laser.
