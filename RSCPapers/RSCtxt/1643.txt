Introduction
The use of sunlight offers a path towards replacing fossil with renewable energy resources, and single integrated artificial systems are a promising approach for achieving the very large scale on which such systems need to be made in order to have a substantial impact on transportation fuel use.
				1,2 Closing the photosynthetic cycle under visible light illumination in a bias-free system has been established thus far for the reduction of protons to hydrogen (overall water splitting), primarily involving semiconductor components as light absorbers. Examples are visible light water splitting at triple junction amorphous silicon,
				3,4 III–V semiconducting materials,
				5 WO
				3 or Fe
				2O
				3 photoanode/dye sensitized
				6 or BiVO
				4/a-Si tandem cells,
				7 and 2-photon TiO
				2/Si nanowire or n-WO
				3/np
				+Si microwire arrays.
				8,9 GaN:ZnO materials functionalized with co-catalysts are an example of visible light induced overall water splitting using the semiconductor particle approach.
				10 For the direct photocatalytic CO
				2 reduction by H
				2O, existing systems are heterogeneous and based on wide bandgap semiconductor light absorbers like TiO
				2, SrTiO
				3, ZnO, SiC,
				11,12 or isolated Ti centers substituted in micro or mesoporous silicates.
				13,14 In contrast to H
				2 generating systems, light absorption for all these materials is restricted to the UV region. In the case of isolated Ti centers in mesoporous silica, CO and O
				2 were shown to be the initial single photon products.
				15 In addition, reports are emerging of UV-light-driven CO
				2 reduction by H
				2O with enhanced selectivity to specific products. Specifically, a 2-photon system, consisting of an InP photocathode functionalized by an organo Ru complex coupled to a TiO
				2 particle, yields formate as the predominant product.
				16 Also, MgO added to Pt loaded TiO
				2 was shown to enhance selectivity towards the methane product,
				17 or a thin Nafion layer on Pd-deposited TiO
				2 nanoparticles was found to promote methane and ethane production in aqueous suspension.
				18
While single integrated photosystems are attractive from the standpoint of minimizing the balance of system components, which is imperative for very large scale use, a challenging requirement is that all components, from light absorbers to catalysts to separating membranes operate efficiently under the same environmental conditions. To avoid harsh pH conditions, Nature's design of closing the photosynthetic redox cycle on the length scale of nanometers is particularly relevant because it obviates the need for large amounts of added buffer or supporting electrolyte, and minimizes side reactions. Critical unmet requirements for efficient light driven reduction of CO
				2 by H
				2O are the closing of the photosynthetic cycle on the nanoscale using robust inorganic components, and precisely (molecularly) defined charge transport contacts between the components. Moreover, separation of the reduction chemistry from water oxidation catalysis by a proton conducting, product impermeable membrane is an unmet challenge.
			
To address these challenges, we have developed all-inorganic, oxo-bridged heterobinuclear units as light absorbers. The units, covalently anchored on silica nanoparticle surfaces, possess metal-to-metal charge-transfer (MMCT) absorption that reaches deep into the visible region. A dozen different oxo-bridged chromophores featuring Ti or Zr as acceptor and a first or second row transition metal as donor have been developed in our lab
				19–30 and subsequently by the K. Hashimoto group.
				31–33 The flexibility in selecting metal centers allows us to match the redox potential of donor or acceptor to the potential of the catalyst, which is important for converting a maximum fraction of the absorbed photon energy to chemical energy of products. The ability of most binuclear units to drive MMCT induced redox reactions reflects an unusually long lifetime of the excited charge transfer state
				26 attributed to an ultrafast spin flip following optical excitation of the MMCT transition.
				29 For a TiOCr
				III moiety coupled to an Ir oxide nanocluster (2 nm) on the surface of mesoporous silica, efficient visible light driven water oxidation was demonstrated.
				23 Light absorbers featuring Zr as acceptor oxo-bridged to a Cu
				I or Co
				II donor center allowed the direct reduction of CO
				2 to CO upon MMCT excitation of the units in mesoporous silica loaded with 1 atm of CO
				2 gas.
				19,28 A recently developed photodeposition method for the spatially directed assembly of a water oxidation cluster coupled to the Co donor center of a ZrOCo
				II unit allowed us to reduce CO
				2 by oxidizing H
				2O at such a well defined inorganic polynuclear unit for the first time.
				30
In order to accomplish the photosynthetic cycle under separation of the oxidation and reduction chemistry by a proton conducting, product impermeable membrane, we are developing core–shell nanotube assemblies as shown in the cartoon of 
				Fig. 1. The core is a crystalline Co
				3O
				4 nanotube that acts as an efficient water oxidation catalyst, the shell is a dense phase oxide layer of a few nanometers depth that serves as a proton conducting, gas impermeable membrane. Its function is to separate the oxidation from the reduction chemistry, which is particularly important for the case of multistep CO
				2 reduction by H
				2O because of readily oxidized intermediates that are formed in the process, which otherwise would be consumed by side reactions. For tight control of electron transport across the insulating shell, hole conducting molecular wires are embedded into the separating layer. In this paper, we present crystalline Co
				3O
				4 nanotubes as efficient water oxidation catalysts, and nanometer-thin silica layers as proton conducting, O
				2 impermeable membranes. Furthermore, efficient charge transport from light absorber on one side of the silica membrane to Co
				3O
				4 on the other will be presented.

Methods
Synthesis of Co
					3O
					4 nanotubes
				
Co hydroxide was precipitated by adding 10 mL 0.1 M ammonia solution to 10 mL 0.025 M Co(NO
					3)
					2. The precipitate was centrifuged (4500 rpm, 5 min) and washed a half dozen times in deionized water. After dispersing the Co(OH)
					2 in water and adding 0.3 g NaNO
					3, solvothermal syntheses of nanotubes were conducted in Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves (Parr Instrument Company, acid digestion vessel) with a capacity of 23 mL. Typical duration of the synthesis was 10 days at 250 °C. Calcination was conducted at 500 °C. Transmission electron microscopy was conducted with a Phillips CM300 instrument. Phase identification and structural analysis of nanotube samples were carried out by XRD using a Siemens D500 diffractometer equipped with Ni-filtered Cu K
					α radiation (
					λ = 1.5406 Å). FT-IR spectra were acquired with a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer equipped with liquid N
					2 cooled MCT detector, and FT-Raman spectra were recorded with a Bruker IFS66V spectrometer with FRA106 FT-Raman module. Dried nanotube samples were mixed with KBr into fine powders and pressed into a pellet at 5000 psi. Optical spectra of sample solutions were collected with a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
				
Measurement of catalytic water oxidation activity
Photochemical water oxidation experiments were conducted using [Ru(bpy)
					3]
					2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) or its carboxylated derivatives as the visible light sensitizer. Persulfate (S
					2O
					82−) served as the sacrificial electron acceptor. This sensitizer system is widely used for driving multi-electron catalysts for water oxidation in the half reaction mode.
					34–36 An aqueous solution buffered at pH 7 (Na
					2SiF
					6–NaHCO
					3, 3.7–70 mM) containing 13.5 mM Na
					2S
					2O
					8 (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.5 mM [Ru(bpy)
					3]Cl
					2·6H
					2O (Aldrich), and ∼1 mM Co
					3O
					4 nanotubes was irradiated with the 476 nm emission line of an Ar ion laser (Coherent model Innova 90) at 21 °C.
				
Oxygen evolution during photochemical water oxidation in the aqueous phase was monitored by a Clark electrode equipped with a Pt cathode and an Ag/AgCl anode (Hansatech Oxygraph system). The electrode was assembled by adding a drop of 0.1 M KCl electrolyte on the tip of the Pt electrode and tightly covering it with a thin PTFE (Teflon) membrane, which is permeable to oxygen. Liquid phase two-point calibration was performed in which the current response was measured in an air-saturated sample solution (maximum) and in deoxygenated sample solution (minimum) at 21 °C. In a typical photochemical water oxidation experiment, 2 mL of the solution was irradiated with a 476 nm laser beam (24 mW power) which was expanded to 1 cm diameter. Prior to irradiation, the solution was purged with N
					2.
				
For gas phase O
					2 evolution experiments and mass spectrometric monitoring of the reaction, the catalyst suspension was first degassed under vacuum and filled with Ar before transfer into the reactor. The reactor, which is a 50 mL flask containing 40 mL of aqueous reactant solution, was irradiated with the 476 nm Ar laser beam (480 mW) expanded to 2 cm diameter. A 2.5 mL aliquot of gas was periodically captured from the headspace of the reactor, followed by direct injection into a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer model Oministar 422).
				
Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was conducted with an Edinburgh Instruments model LP920 spectrometer equipped with a pulsed Xe probe lamp or a CW halogen lamp (for measurements > 1 ms) and a Nd:YAG laser pumped tunable Optical Paramagnetic Oscillator (Continuum Lasers model Surelite II and Surelite OPO Plus) as excitation source. The laser pulse width was 8 ns and the repetition rate was 10 Hz.
Preparation of Pt/SiO
					2 electrode
				
Pt thin films deposited on silicon supported substrate were selected as the proton probing electrode. Briefly, a p-type Si (100) substrate (∼0.005 Ω cm, Siliconquest) was cleaned in acetone, methanol and isopropanol sequentially for 10 minutes each. A 10 nm Ti layer was deposited on the silicon substrate as an adhesion layer using an e-beam evaporation system (Semicore SC600) followed by deposition of a 100 nm Pt film. After e-beam evaporation, the sample was treated in a UV ozone cleaner for 3 minutes before the electrode preparation process.
Two to eight nm deep SiO
					2 films were prepared on Pt probing sample based on a modified recipe in a plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) system (Oxford FlexAl).
					37 The SiO
					2 deposition was carried out at 40 °C with bis(
					t-butylamino)silane (BTBAS, Air Products, ≥98.5%) as the silicon precursor and oxygen plasma as the oxidant. The precursor lines, carrier gas lines, and the reactor walls were all kept at 40 °C. The BTBAS precursor bubbler was also heated up to 35 °C and filled into the deposition chamber using the vapour draw method. Oxygen gas flow was held constant at 60 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm) throughout the deposition process. The silicon precursor exposure half cycle consisted of 2 s dosing and 10 s purging using 250 sccm high purity Ar gas. The oxygen plasma half cycle consisted of 2 s pre-plasma treatment, 3 s plasma exposure, and 5 s purging with 100 sccm N
					2 and 250 sccm Ar. The applied plasma power was 250 W and was applied for 3 s during the oxygen plasma half cycle. The deposition chamber pressure was held at 80 mTorr during the BTBAS dosing and purging steps and 15 mTorr during the oxygen plasma steps. The film thicknesses were checked using UVISEL spectroscopic ellipsometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) and confirmed with TEM measurements. The average growth rate was 1.4 Å per cycle.
				
The as-grown SiO
					2 films were characterized by FT-IR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD system at a takeoff angle of 0° relative to the surface normal using a monochromatized Al K
					α source (1486.6 eV)), atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Dimension Icon) using Bruker TAP150A probes (5 N m
					−1 spring constant; 150 kHz frequency), and TEM. After UV ozone treatment (Pt probing sample) or SiO
					2 PEALD deposition, the samples were used directly for electrode fabrication. The SiO
					2 coated samples were scratched at the edge to expose the Pt layer to make an electrical contact. Ohmic contact was made by fixing tinned copper wire (Conwire-811-5) with Ag epoxy (Circuitworks, CW2400) on the Pt (or SiO
					2 coated Pt) side. The entire sample was sealed with non-conductive Hysol epoxy (Loctite, Hysol 615), only leaving the Pt (or SiO
					2 coated Pt) surface exposed.
				
Electrochemical and impedance measurements
The electrochemical measurements were conducted using a CHI 609D Potentiostat/Galvanostat in a three-electrode configuration, with SiO
					2 coated Pt (or Pt) as working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl (BASi RE5B) as the reference electrode. The aqueous electrolyte solution consisted of 0.5 M sodium sulfate (≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) and the solution pH was adjusted to 3.88 using sulfuric acid (95.0–98%, Sigma-Aldrich). High purity argon (Grade 4.8, Praxair) or oxygen (Grade 4.3, Praxair) gases were bubbled through the solution continuously during the electrochemical measurements. All reagents were used as-received without further purification. The current density 
					vs. potential (
					J–
					V) measurements were conducted at a scan rate of 50 mV s
					−1. All the reported potentials were converted into the potential 
					vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following equation.
					ERHE = 
						Emeasure + 0.059pH + 
						E0Ag/AgClwhere 
					ERHE is the converted potential 
					vs. RHE, 
					Emeasure is the experimentally measured applied potential against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and 
					E0Ag/AgCl is the potential at 25 °C 
					vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).
				
Results and discussion
Cobalt oxide as earth abundant water oxidation catalyst in nanotube form
We have discovered recently that nanostructured Co
					3O
					4 clusters in mesoporous silica SBA-15 are orders of magnitude more efficient catalysts for water oxidation under close to neutral pH conditions compared to micron size particles.
					35 Driven by visible-light-generated [Ru(bpy)
					3]
					3+ at pH 5.8 (overpotential is 350 mV) and room temperature, the most active Co
					3O
					4 sample showed a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1140 O
					2 molecules per second per catalyst cluster.
					35 The rate was determined mass spectrometrically by probing oxygen gas that accumulated in the head space of the reaction vessel. Co
					3O
					4 clusters are parallel bundles of nanorods (8 nm diameter) forming a spheroidal cluster of 35 nm diameter and 50 nm length. The TOF of 1140 O
					2 s
					−1 corresponds to a 1 O
					2 s
					−1 nm
					−2 projected geometrical area of the catalyst cluster. For a 2-photon artificial photosystem, 150 O
					2 molecules per nm
					2 need to be generated at maximum solar intensity (1500 photons per s per nm
					2) in order for all photons to be utilized productively.
					38 Therefore, stacking of about 100 of these clusters in a silica scaffold, which is readily realized in a pressed wafer of 150 μm thickness of mesoporous silica particles at 4% Co
					3O
					4 loading, would be sufficient to keep up with the maximum solar flux.
					39 Based on the TOF of 1140 per nanocluster, a value of 0.01 O
					2 s
					−1 is calculated per surface Co center of the material (pH 5.8).
					35 With the same visible light sensitization method but conducting the water oxidation at pH 7, bare surfactant-free spherical Co
					3O
					4 nanocrystals (4 nm diameter) were determined to have a TOF per surface Co center of 0.015 s
					−1.
					40 Therefore, crystalline Co
					3O
					4 is promising as a nanotube material for the proposed Co oxide–silica core–shell assembly.
				
Co
					3O
					4 nanotubes have received considerable scientific and technological attention because of their potential for various applications such as solid-state gas sensors, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and heterogeneous catalysts.
					41–44 We sought to nanoengineer Co
					3O
					4 into high-aspect ratio nanotubes and assess the catalytic water oxidation activity. Several approaches have been developed to synthesize Co
					3O
					4 nanotubes such as template syntheses using chemical bath deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and atomic layer deposition and template-less synthesis using solvothermal methods, Kirkendall effect based transformation, or self-supported topotactic transformation.
					41–48
We have adopted a modified solvothermal synthesis method for preparing Co
					2+ containing oxide nanotubes first, followed by calcination to complete the transformation to Co
					3O
					4 nanotubes as shown in 
					Fig. 2a–e.
					45,49 The pure Co
					3O
					4 structure of the tubes was confirmed by characteristic XRD pattern and FT-IR bands presented in 
					Fig. 3a and b. The prepared Co
					3O
					4 nanotubes typically have mean outer and inner diameters of 12 nm and 6 nm, respectively, and a tube length in the range 100–150 nm. Using the [Ru(bpy)
					3]
					2+/S
					2O
					82− photosensitization system, a TOF of 0.018 s
					−1 per surface Co atom was measured (Na
					2SiF
					6–NaHCO
					3 buffer solution (pH 7)) by mass spectrometric analysis of O
					2 evolving in the head space (
					Fig. 4) combined with electrochemical probing of dissolved O
					2 (Clarke electrode). This TOF value is close to our previously reported values measured for 4 nm surfactant-free Co
					3O
					4 nanoparticles and other spinel cobalt based nanocrystalline materials.
					40 Given a footprint of 1.13 nm
					2 for a 12 nm diameter vertical nanotube, a tube of 700 nm length will be able to keep up with O
					2 production even at maximum solar intensity. Hence, the catalytic efficiency of the Co
					3O
					4 nanotube is in the proper range for use in an artificial photosynthetic assembly. It is important to note, however, that our discovery of fast and slow catalytic Co sites of Co
					3O
					4 by rapid-scan FT-IR spectroscopy (TOF ≥ 3 s
					−1 for the fast sites) shows that surface Co sites exist which have widely different catalytic efficiencies.

We note, however, that the solvothermal method for Co
					3O
					4 nanotube synthesis might not be suitable for subsequent asymmetrical functionalization of the nanotubes (different chemical treatment of the inside 
					versus outside of the tube), which is required for the design of our artificial photosystem. To enable asymmetrical functionalization of a nanotube array, we propose to adopt a sacrificial vertical silicon nanowire array template and deposit Co
					3O
					4 thin films by atomic layer deposition, as demonstrated previously.
					51 The silicon nanowire core serves as the blocker during the surface functionalization of molecular wires and silica shell coating, and it can subsequently be removed selectively to expose the active sites for water oxidation catalysis. The Co
					3O
					4 coating thickness and deposition parameters can be tuned to maximize the photocatalytic performance of the final system. We have successfully prepared vertical Co
					3O
					4 nanotube arrays using this approach, and deposition of the silica layers with embedded molecular wires (described below) is in progress in our lab.
				
Nanoscale silica layer as a proton-conducting, gas blocking membrane
Amorphous pore-free silica layers a few nanometer thick hold promise as robust materials for separating the visible light absorber and reductive chemistry from the metal oxide catalyst for water oxidation (
					Fig. 1). Silica is known to transmit protons across thin layers
					52–54 while blocking methanol.
					54 We anticipate that such a thin SiO
					2 layer also blocks O
					2 efficiently. These are the critical permeability requirements of a membrane for a nanoscale photosystem for CO
					2 reduction by H
					2O. Other types of inorganic oxide layers of nanometer depth exhibit similar permeability properties. For example, Domen demonstrated that Cr
					2O
					3 or lanthanoid oxides transmit protons but block O
					2 when used as protective layers of a noble metal proton reduction catalyst.
					55,56 Hwang observed selectivity for proton 
					versus O
					2 permeability in the case of 1 nm NiO overlayers.
					57 Hundreds of nanometer thick films of silica have been demonstrated as proton exchange membranes in microfabricated fuel cells.
					54 Furthermore, derivatized silicate compounds that exhibit enhanced proton conduction property are proposed as promising candidate for the next generation intermediate temperature solid-state fuel cells.
					52
We have synthesized 2–4 nm silica thin films using plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition method and investigated both the proton conduction and gas blocking properties of these films by electrochemical measurements. Our approach consists of the preparation of nanometer thin SiO
					2 layers on a Pt probing electrode and monitoring of the proton adsorption/desorption and oxygen reduction reactions by cyclic voltammetry. When the SiO
					2 coated Pt working electrode was immersed in acidic, argon saturated solution (pH 4), we observed the reduction current of protons to Pt–H indicating that protons permeate through the silica layer and reach the Pt surface. When oxygen is introduced to the solution, we should measure minimal oxygen reduction current due to the silica barrier. Since we aim for CO
					2 reduction reaction, the hydrogen permeability is not considered here. Notably, all experiments were carried out at room temperature, which is different from proton conductivity measurements in fuel cell studies. Various thicknesses of SiO
					2 thin films were deposited on top of the Pt of the Pt/Si working electrode. The applied number of cycles allowed the growth of silica layers with precise depth. 
					Fig. 5a shows a cross sectional high resolution TEM of a 3.8 ± 0.3 nm thickness, and a root-mean-square surface roughness of 1.93 Å determined by AFM (
					Fig. 5b). All films with thickness equal or greater than 3.8 nm were shown to grow uniformly on the Pt surface without cracks, particles or pinholes.

						2 is the 100 nm Pt film prepared by e-beam evaporation. SiO
						2 film depth is 3.8 ± 0.3 nm. The surface roughness stems from the deposited Pt film. (b) AFM image of the SiO
						2 deposited on Si substrate.
					 
Before starting electrochemical measurements, all electrodes were cycled between 0.05 V to 1.15 V 
					vs. RHE at 0.1 V s
					−1 under argon atmosphere to remove any impurities and stabilize the electrode. The sweep potential was limited below 1.15 V to prevent alterations of the Pt surface, such as high potential induced oxidation and reconstruction.
					58,59 Cathodic sweeps in O
					2-free aqueous solution showed a broad peak due to proton to H (Pt–H) reduction centered at 0.23 V RHE (
					Fig. 6). Because of the polycrystalline nature of Pt prepared by e-beam evaporation, the proton adsorption/desorption wave measured here represents a combination of proton adsorption/desorption peaks corresponding to different Pt crystal planes, such as (110), (100), (111). Interestingly, the proton adsorption current densities were significantly increased on the 3.8 nm SiO
					2 coated Pt electrode, which suggests that the SiO
					2 coating activates the proton adsorption sites on the Pt surface. Control experiments confirmed that a simple plasma treatment (identical SiO
					2 growth conditions without using Si precursor) did not activate the Pt surface for proton adsorption.

						4 solution. The solution was adjusted to pH 4 using H
						2SO
						4 and Ar saturated solution. The scan rate was 50 mV s

The proton adsorption wave was reproducible over several hours of CV scans, confirming that there is sustained proton transport. At the same time, the 3.8 nm silica layer serves as a good O
					2 diffusion barrier since no O
					2 reduction current could be observed when conducting the CV scans for an O
					2 saturated solution (
					Fig. 7). Hence, silica layers of this thickness and larger are proton conducting, O
					2 impermeable membranes. Measurement of the SiO
					2 thickness dependence of the overpotential for proton reduction and proton conductivity measurements are our next steps to further evaluate the potential of using nanometer thin silica film for separation membrane in the artificial photosynthesis system.

Embedded molecular wires for controlled electron transport across the silica membrane
In addition to transmitting protons while separating photosynthetic products, a critical requirement for photosynthetic efficiency is tightly controlled transport of electrons (holes) from the light absorber to the Co
					3O
					4 catalyst across the membrane.
				
Our approach for controlled charge transfer is to embed organic molecular wires with appropriate electronic properties into the silica layer and covalently attach them to the catalyst surface on one side, and to a light absorber on the other. If proof of concept can be established, such a composite membrane could be used in Co
					3O
					4–SiO
					2 core–shell nanotubes, which have the proper geometry for CO
					2 reduction by H
					2O under product separation.
				
We have synthesized 
					p-oligo(phenylenevinylene) molecules with 3 aryl units (1,3-di((
					E)-styryl) benzene, abbrev. PV3). These molecules are well established hole conductors and have the potential of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) properly positioned between the potential of a Ru bipyridyl sensitizer and the upper valence band position of Co
					3O
					4 nanoparticles (
					Fig. 8c).
					60 The molecules were functionalized on one end with tridentate (HOCH
					2)
					3C-groups or carboxyl groups for covalent anchoring on the Co
					3O

					Fig. 8a).
					61 The tripodal anchors combined with the negative charge of the SO
					3− groups (surface repelling) were selected in order to impose vertical (radial) arrangement of the wire molecules
					62 on the Co oxide surface (
					Fig. 8b). Covalent anchoring of the wire molecules on the Co
					3O
					4 particle surface was conducted with a peptide coupling agent. The wire molecule has sufficient potential (
					Eo = 1.46 V 
					vs. NHE, 
					Fig. 8c) to drive a Co
					3O
					4 catalyst for water oxidation since even unfunctionalized [Ru(bpy)
					3]
					3+ with a potential of just 1.26 V has been shown to induce water oxidation at Co
					3O
					4 nanoparticles efficiently.

					2+ was used, which has a redox potential of 1.86 V (NHE). The LUMO of PV3 is situated close to 0.8 V above the reduction potential of the excited sensitizer (
					Fig. 8c), thus rendering electron flow in the undesired direction (towards Co
					3O
					4 catalyst) inefficient. For proof of concept of charge transport across silica embedded molecular wires, a simple spherical core–shell particles (4 nm) system was chosen rather than the more complex nanotube construct. The integrity of the PV3 structure, its electronic properties and level of surface loading (12 PV3 nm
					−2 surface of the Co
					3O
					4 particle) were established by UV-Vis, FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopy.

As a control, the supernatant was excited with a 450 nm laser pulse in a separate experiment to find out whether any dissolved PV3 wire molecules could have contributed to the observed decay. As can be seen from the grey trace of 
					Fig. 9a, the [Ru(bpy(CO
					2CH
					3)
					2)
					3]
					2+ bleach persists and no decay is observed on the microsecond time scale, indicating that such a process is not responsible for the observed recovery of the reduced sensitizer. Furthermore, the reduced [Ru(bpy(CO
					2CH
					3)
					2)
					3]
					2+ species is completely regenerated within tens of μs (
					Fig. 9a). Because direct hole transfer from the oxidized sensitizer to Co
					3O
					4 particles is several orders of magnitude slower process (
					Fig. 9b) with a time constant of 25 ms,
					63 holes are injected into Co
					3O
					4 catalyst particles exclusively 
					via anchored wire molecules. As shown in the electrochemical measurement of 
					Fig. 9c, evolution of O
					2 in the same Co
					3O
					4_PV3 suspension containing Ru sensitizer and Co acceptor is readily observed upon visible light illumination. Therefore, holes injected into the attached PV3 molecules are transferred to the Co
					3O
					4 particle where they induce catalytic water oxidation. The characteristic transient absorption of the hole residing on the PV3 at 600 nm is not observed (
					Fig. 9d), indicating that transfer of the charge to the Co
					3O
					4 catalyst is too fast. On the other hand, the PV3
					+ absorption at 600 nm is detected when the wire molecules are covalently attached to SiO
					2 nanoparticles, as shown in 
					Fig. 9e and f. Silica is an insulator and has no electronic states that could accept the charge. Comparison of the transient signal amplitude at 600 nm for PV3 on SiO
					2 particles and the noise of the kinetic trace for PV3 on Co
					3O
					4 allowed us to estimate an upper limit for the hole residence time in the case of Co
					3O
					4_PV3. The transfer rate from PV3 to Co
					3O
					4 is found to be 7 × 10
					5 s
					−1 or faster.
					61 Therefore, covalently anchored PV3 molecules offer an approach for tightly controlled, efficient charge transport between visible light absorber and Co
					3O
					4 catalyst.
				
In the next step, we developed a modified method based on the original solvothermal approach by Stoeber
					64 for casting a dense phase amorphous silica shell around the Co
					3O
					4 attached wire molecules.
					40 Conformal coating of 4 nm Co
					3O
					4 catalyst particles by a 2 nm silica shell was demonstrated by HR TEM imaging and EELS measurement (
					Fig. 10a and b). FT-Raman spectra revealed an intact casting procedure (
					Fig. 10c), which was further corroborated by FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy.
					40 Using the same photosensitization method for suspensions of the resulting Co oxide core–silica shell particles with embedded wires, as discussed above for Co
					3O
					4_PV3 particles, nanosecond transient absorption measurements of the bleach recovery of the reduced [Ru(bpy(CO
					2CH
					3)
					2)
					3]
					2+ sensitizer indicated diffusion controlled hole transfer from the light absorber across the silica shell to the Co
					3O
					4 core (
					Fig. 11). No fast recovery of the 470 nm band of [Ru(bpy(CO
					2CH
					3)
					2)
					3]
					2+ was observed when conducting the same experiments with Co
					3O
					4–SiO
					2 particles without embedded molecular wires, as shown by the grey trace of 
					Fig. 11b. Using the same method described above, an upper limit of a few microseconds was inferred for the transit time of the hole across the embedded PV3 molecule to the Co
					3O
					4 particle. The result was corroborated by monitoring of the Ru oxidation state of the sensitizer by the bpy ligand vibrational modes in light-on/light-off experiments using core–shell particles. The technique used was rapid-scan FT-IR spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflection mode, which allowed the direct observation of the reduction of the oxidized sensitizer [Ru(bpy(CO
					2CH
					3)
					2)
					3]
					3+ in the presence of core–shell particles with embedded PV3 wires. No reduction of [Ru(bpy(CO
					2CH
					3)
					2)
					3]
					3+ was observed for particles with no wire molecules in the shell.
					40 We conclude that the hole-conducting wire molecules cast into the dense phase silica shell provide a controlled, fast charge transfer path through the product-separating SiO
					2 nanolayer between the visible light sensitizer and the Co oxide catalyst. Furthermore, the silica minimizes oxidative damage of the organic material.

Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated Co
				3O
				4 nanotubes as efficient multi-electron catalysts for water oxidation and found that amorphous silica layers of a few nanometers depth function as proton conducting, O
				2 impermeable membranes. Combined with our recently established solvothermal method of casting hole conducting molecular wires into silica for controlled charge transport from light absorber on one side of the SiO
				2 barrier to the catalyst on the other, these results provide the basis for developing Co
				3O
				4–SiO
				2 core–shell nanotubes as units for closing the cycle of photocatalytic CO
				2 reduction by H
				2O on the nanometer scale. A large array of vertically arranged core–shell nanotubes, with CO
				2 conversion taking place in the space between the tubes, would accomplish separation of O
				2 evolution from carbon dioxide reduction on the macroscale.
			
Achieving this goal poses interesting challenges in terms of materials synthesis as well as functional characterization of the assembly. Specifically, methods need to be developed for the selective anchoring of charge conducting molecular wires (PV
				n, 
				n between 4 and 6 (
				n is the number of aryl units)) on the outside of the nanotube while keeping the inner surface of the Co
				3O
				4 tube free for water oxidation catalysis. An approach currently explored in our lab utilizes a silicon nanowire array as a sacrificial template for growing Co oxide nanotubes, with the silicon wires blocking access to PV
				n molecules during anchoring on the outer catalyst surface. Furthermore, tuning of the proton transport rates of the silica membrane in order to match the H
				+ generation rate during water oxidation catalysis might become important for maintaining photocatalytic efficiency. Transition metal or phosphorous doping is known to strongly affect the proton flux through silicate membranes of micro fuel cells, an approach that could be explored during casting of the silica around the Co oxide nanotubes by either solvothermal or plasma enhanced ALD methods. A further synthetic challenge is precise charge transport contact between the donor center of the heterobinuclear light absorbers
				19–33 and the embedded molecular wires when anchoring the units on the outer silica surface of the core–shell nanotube.
