    , Accepted 8th January 2018First published on 8th January 2018AbstractCe-Doped SiOxNy films are deposited by magnetron reactive sputtering from a CeO2 target under a nitrogen reactive gas atmosphere. Visible photoluminescence measurements regarding the nitrogen gas flow reveal a large emission band centered at 450 nm for a sample deposited under a 2 sccm flow. Special attention is paid to the origin of such an emission at high nitrogen concentration. Different emitting centers are suggested in Ce doped SiOxNy films (e.g. band tails, CeO2, Ce clusters, Ce3+ ions), with different activation scenarios to explain the luminescence. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals the exclusive presence of Ce3+ ions whatever the nitrogen or Ce concentrations, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows no clusters or silicates upon high temperature annealing. With the help of photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE), a wide excitation range from 250 nm up to 400 nm is revealed and various excitations of Ce3+ ions are proposed involving direct or indirect mechanisms. Nitrogen concentration plays an important role in Ce3+ emission by modifying Ce surroundings, reducing the Si phase volume in SiOxNy and causing a nephelauxetic effect. Taking into account the optimized nitrogen growth parameters, the Ce concentration is analyzed as a new parameter. Under UV excitation, a strong emission is visible to the naked eye with high Ce3+ concentration (6 at%). No saturation of the photoluminescence intensity is observed, confirming again the lack of Ce cluster or silicate phase formation due to the nitrogen presence.
Introduction
Rare earth (RE) doping of silicon host matrices has been widely studied as a method to add light emitting sources to integrated optoelectronic devices using RE inter-4f transitions that offer multiple wavelength emission. Typically, these transitions, forbidden in the case of a free ion, are partially allowed by the crystal field and result in a very low absorption cross section inducing a non-efficient excitation and thus limiting the applications.1 The Ce3+ ion is different due to a 5d–4f transition involved resulting in a large absorption cross section (10−19 cm−2) compared to the other RE ions (10−21 cm−2). An intense broad luminescence band from these Ce3+ ions is observed in a wide spectral range from 380 nm up to 600 nm under various excitations ranging from 300 nm to 400 nm due to the strong oscillator strengths2 and many energy levels of the 5d band involved.3 Furthermore, in the case of Ce3+ ions having only one electron within the 5d orbital, which participates in the formation of the chemical bonding, this 5d band is strongly dependent on the local environment, resulting in a large Stokes shift depending on the host matrix composition.2–4
Different major properties of Ce3+ ions (e.g. intense luminescence, broad absorption/emission band, dependence of the excitation/emission wavelength on the crystal structure, etc.) have been developed for many applications such as phosphors for cathodoluminescence light sources,5 scintillators for elementary particles,6 or detectors for ionizing radiation.7 Two other applications have been extensively explored, namely quantum cutting for solar cells and UV emitting devices.8,9 For the former, the quantum cutting effect is created with the help of Ce3+–Yb3+ co-doping in glasses,9,10 phosphors8,11 or bulk crystal matrices.12 Although much effort has been made on depositing such matrices on commercial silicon solar cells,11,13 their properties are still not silicon technology compatible. That is why recent researchers have turned to investigate host matrices easily integrable on silicon such as silicon oxide.14,15 Regarding the Ce doped devices devoted to light emitting devices on silicon, the feasibility of CeO2 and Ce2Si2O7 LEDs has been demonstrated,16,17 while a Ce-doped SiOx matrix shows a strong emission of the Ce3+ ion.18,19
Unfortunately, there exist some major drawbacks hampering such applications. In particular, Ce3+ and other RE3+ dopants have a low solubility limit. For instance, this leads to Ce clustering in SiOx after annealing at 900 °C.19 In addition, silica based LEDs present a short durability after several hot carrier injection cycles under high applied voltage because of its large 9 eV bandgap.20 To overcome the above mentioned drawbacks, silicon compatible Si3N4 host matrixes are also studied as an alternative approach. Indeed, Si3N4 has much higher RE ion solubility in comparison with the SiOx counterpart, thus inhibiting RE ion clustering.21,22 Moreover, its lower bandgap (4–5 eV)23 can improve both the electrical conductivity and the onset voltage for the electroluminescence signal.24,25 Since the presence of oxygen is crucial for Ce3+ emission,26 one possibility is to combine the advantages of SiO2 (i.e. the presence of oxygen) and Si3N4 (i.e. lower band gap and higher solubility). In this regard, the SiOxNy matrix retains the advantages of both matrices as it was demonstrated for a LED based on Ce3+-doped SiOxNy.20
In this context, it is interesting to investigate how the Ce element is incorporated into SiOxNy. In the past, Ce doping from a metallic target was reported.18,19,27 However, metal targets are very sensitive to surface oxidation due to the electronic affinity between Ce and O elements thus their use requires a very high temperature (∼1400 °C). Above all, the Ce metallic target contains more Ce element than the CeO2 target. Such high purity can result in inhomogeneous Ce dopant deposition and favor the growth of Ce clusters at high annealing temperature. Thus, an alternative solution is to sputter from a CeO2 target, with both benefits of a chemical stability and a much lower target temperature required during the deposition process. This approach can generate Ce4+ ions which are optically inactive due to their electronic configuration. Nevertheless, numerous studies have demonstrated the efficient emission of Ce3+ in samples deposited from CeO2 targets.15–17 Unfortunately, depositing from the CeO2 target requires a post-growth annealing step at high temperature to form optically active Ce3+ ions which could generate Ce clusters due to the high thermal budget. Considering the above mentioned arguments, we believe that doping the SiOxNy host matrix with Ce appears to be an interesting approach for achieving efficient cerium emission.
In this work, a CeO2 target was used to incorporate Ce3+ ions in a SiOxNy matrix by reactive magnetron sputtering which is easily compatible with Si processing technology. Despite the use of a CeO2 target which contains optically inactive Ce4+ ions, a specific Ce3+ ion emission is obtained with an annealing temperature (TA) of 700 °C. XPS, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) and spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements on Ce-doped SiOxNy show the influence of the nitrogen composition on the host matrix structure. Photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) experiments were carried out to study in the first step, the Ce3+ ion excitation mechanisms, specifically the link between the nitrogen content and the Ce excitation. A second part is focused on the Ce3+ emission as a function of the Ce concentration under a high nitrogen flow, in order to optimize the PL intensity.
Experimental section
Ce doped SiOxNy thin layers were deposited at room temperature by magnetron reactive sputtering on p-type doped 250 μm thick 2′′ (100 oriented) silicon wafer. The working pressure was fixed at 3 mTorr and the argon flow was set at 8 sccm. Two sets of samples have been deposited using CeO2 and Si targets. A set of four Ce doped samples was grown under a variable N2 flux and a second set of four samples with different cerium doping, including one undoped as the reference. In the case of this specific reference sample, the CeO2 target was replaced by a SiO2 target to ensure oxygen incorporation in the matrix. No study has been performed above 2 sccm N2 flux because the deposition chamber atmosphere was not enough plasmogenic, stopping the plasma and then the deposition process. The atomic compositions as well as the refractive index measurements have confirmed the same stoichiometry between undoped and doped layers. Films were then annealed at different temperatures (TA) from 600 °C to 1000 °C using the Classic Thermal Annealing (CTA) setup for 1 h under flowing N2.
Structural analysis was performed using a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR), Thermo Nicolet Nexus 750 II working in the 400–4000 cm−1 range with a 5 cm−1 resolution at the Brewster angle, while RBS measurements were carried out at the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory of Ohio University using a 4.5 MV tandem accelerator. The film thicknesses and refractive indexes were obtained with the help of a UVISEL VIS-FGMS Ellipsometer using an incident angle of 70°. The experimental data were recorded in the 1.5–6 eV range with a 0.01 eV resolution and fitted using DeltaPsi2 software in order to obtain the thickness and the refractive index values. Except if mentioned otherwise, the latter is given at 1.95 eV (636 nm).
For PL spectroscopy, a Lot-Oriel 1 kW Xenon lamp connected to an OMNI300 monochromator resulting in a 20 nm wavelength wide excitation band was used to excite the sample between 325 nm and 370 nm. The detection system consisted of a photomultiplier tube R5108, (Hamamatsu Photonics) attached to a 300 OMNI monochromator (Gilden Photonics) and a SR830 lock-in amplifier referenced at the excitation light beam chopped frequency. A ThermoFisher Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer was used for surface and in-depth XPS analysis. A monochromatic Al-Kα source (hν = 1486.6 eV) was used with a spot size of 200 μm in diameter. The spectra in full energy range (0–1150 eV) were obtained with a constant pass energy of 200 eV whereas high resolution spectra were obtained with a constant pass energy of 40 eV, respectively. Depth profile analysis was obtained through Ar+ sputtering using 500 eV low mode and 500 microns raster width. The estimated sputtering rate was 0.2 nm s−1 resulting in the etching time between 0 s and 960 s needed to reach the substrate. XPS measurements were performed at different depths; however only spectra collected at the film center are presented here. Note that carbon t was detected on the surface coming from natural pollution and was not taken into account. Electron microscopy analysis was performed with a JEOL 2010F electron transmission microscope (TEM) with a Field Emission Gun (FEG) electron source operated at 200 kV and whose resolution was 2 Å. The digitalized images were processed by the Gatan's DigitalMicrograph software. The TEM was equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX-EDAX setup) for chemical analyses. EDX profiles were performed using a 1 nm probe for 30 points over a distance of 100 nm. The cross sectional samples were prepared using a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) Helios DualBeam nanolab660 system. To protect the film surface from the gallium ion beam induced damage, a protective carbon layer and two platinum layers were deposited on the sample's surface.
Results and discussion
In order to study the behavior of the photoluminescence (PL) of Ce-doped SiOxNy films, a set of samples has been deposited with the same RF power density on silicon (4.3 W cm−2) and CeO2 (0.45 W cm−2) targets, under different nitrogen fluxes. The emission spectra as well as the structural analysis are presented and discussed below.
Photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy

Fig. 1a displays the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the four Ce-doped SiOxNy films grown with four different N2 flow rates (0.5, 0.75, 1 and 2 sccm) and using 325 nm excitation. Because no emission was observed (not shown) for the as-deposited layers, all the samples in Fig. 1a were annealed at 700 °C. A low intensity and broad PL band centered at ∼400 nm is observed for the samples grown with the three lowest N2 fluxes (0.5 sccm, 0.75 and 1 sccm). Such a broad emission band is the signature of band tails (BT) originating from localized states associated with defects such as dangling bonds in the host matrix.25,28–30 In the past, various studies have reported the role played by such localized states structuring the BT acting as sensitizers for RE emission.22 Indeed, this observed BT peak blue shifts greatly with the excitation wavelength decrease (λexc = 500 nm, the BT peak centered at 550 nm while for λexc = 300 nm, it is peaking at 400 nm).28 Detection of the almost same peaks for the three samples grown at low N2 fluxes shows that the Ce emission, or at least other emitter centers, is not efficient and only the BT emission appears.
 Fig. 1  (a) PL spectra of Ce-doped SiOxNy samples grown with different nitrogen fluxes and annealed at 700 °C under 325 nm excitation normalized by the film thicknesses, (b) PL (solid line) and PLE (dashed line) spectra of Ce-doped SiOxNy deposited with a 2 sccm nitrogen flux. 
For the N2 flow rate of 2 sccm a broad and intense PL band peak position red-shifted to 450 nm. The observed PL intensity is 90 times higher than that of BT from samples deposited at lower N2 flow rates. This PL emission could originate from different emitting centers including: (i) states localized in the BT, (ii) Ce3+ ions assisted by oxygen vacancies in CeO2 involving Ce4+ ions following the Kroger–Vink notation:  with Vo referring to oxygen vacancy,16,31 (iii) formation of Ce oxide single crystals (Ce6O11) when taking into consideration the post-growth low TA treatment (<800 °C),31 or (iv) “isolated” Ce3+ ions.
Concerning the case (i), the increase of the N2 flux could provide an increase of the localized states density leading to the rise of the PL intensity. However, the 90 nm red shift of the PL peak maximum, especially if the excitation wavelength is unchanged, excludes the origin of the BT emission. The emitter centers could appear in the CeO2 films (case (ii)) or in the Ce6O11 crystallized phase (case (iii)). These points will be discussed separately later. To investigate the Ce3+ emission possibility (case (iv)), the PLE spectra of the Ce-doped SiOxNy matrix deposited with a 2 sccm N2 flux was compared with its PL spectrum counterpart (Fig. 1b). The PLE spectrum shows a wide excitation peak (FWHM ∼ 75 nm) with a maximum at 370 nm. The observed PLE band is characteristic of the 5d level of Ce3+ ions due to the transition from the 2F5/2 ground level.19 In the present study, Ce3+ ions are directly excited from a 370 nm excitation wavelength what is consistent with previous studies. For example, for the Ce-doped phosphor, the PLE peak was centered at 357 nm and its FWHM was ∼75 nm,32 while for Ce-doped SiO1.5, a similar matrix to the one studied here, a PLE peak was centered at 300 nm with a FWHM of almost 50 nm.19 Moreover, an important Stokes shift of 97 nm (5600 cm−1) was found, which is similar to the one observed in Ce3+ ion doped inorganic matrices.33
Assuming that the increase of PL intensity is not due to an important rise in the Ce concentration (see below section RBS), the emitting centers are activated by a higher reactive N2 flux (between 1 sccm to 2 sccm) during growth. At this stage, we shall also consider the different plausible scenarios of an activation of such Ce emitting centers affected by the N incorporation as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of possible scenarios illustrating the formation of Ce optical centers in the SiOxNy matrix deposited with a reactive N2 flux at 2 sccm (a) α: cluster formation reducing the Ce3+ ion emission intensity (b) β: the Ce oxidation state depending on the nitrogen content (c) γ: the nitrogen effect on Ce surrounding media. 
Case (α): Nitrogen is known to reduce the RE clustering effect.34 The N incorporation should prevent the Ce cluster formation and favors the Ce3+ emission (see Fig. 2a).
Case (β): Particularly in the presence of an oxygen excess in the layer, oxide defects are known to favor the Ce4+ formation. Thermal treatment reduces the number of oxide defects, helping a valence conversion of Ce from (IV) to (III).35,36 The introduction of N could also change the local distribution of oxygen and facilitate the conversion from optically inactive Ce4+ ions to optically active Ce3+ ions as shown in Fig. 2b.36
Case (γ): The strong dependence of the Ce 5d band on the surrounding host structure could be involved. In this scenario, two indiscernible mechanisms could apply at the same time. First, the increase of the N content in the matrix changes the local environment of the Ce ion, inducing a broadening of the electronic cloud, also known as the nephelauxetic effect,37 which could lower the energy necessary for an optical activation. Second, it has been reported that the Ce ion emission could be stopped when surrounded by Si atoms.19 The higher N2 flux could reduce the number of Si neighbors around the Ce ion and create a favorable emission environment. These two last mechanisms resulting from the different surroundings of the Ce ion are schematized in Fig. 2c.
In the following, structural investigations are carried out to answer these different assumptions concerning the nature and the way how such emitting centers are excited in the Ce-doped SiOxNy sample produced under a 2 sccm N2 flow.
Microstructural analysis – TEM observations
TEM, HRTEM and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) images from Ce-doped SiOxNy samples deposited with 0.75 sccm and 2 sccm N2 fluxes and annealed at 700 °C and 900 °C are presented in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  TEM pictures of Ce-doped SiOxNy deposited with (a) 0.75 sccm N2 flux upon annealing at 700 °C. (b) and (c) 2 sccm N2 flux upon annealing at 900 °C and 700 °C, respectively. Panels (a), (b) and (c) contain HRTEM images with the corresponding FTT analysis (d) Ce ions profile distribution from (c) extracted from EDX measurement. The vertical line indicates the maximum EDX background signal not related to Ce ions. 
In each case, a bright field image is shown and an HRTEM image from a small region of the film is enlarged at the bottom left handside of the image. At the top left handside, FFT of the HRTEM image is depicted. Both 700 °C and 900 °C annealed films display amorphous and homogeneous films without phase separation whatever the N2 flux. Note that for the as-grown samples deposited with 0.75 sccm and 2 sccm, the same amorphous film structure has been found (not shown). Concerning the SiOx host matrices with 1 < x < 2, some previous studies have been reported with respect to different RE doping and post-growth TA. For example, in SiO2, Tb or Eu-oxide clusters have been identified in the middle of the film after annealing at 900 °C,38 while in Er-doped silicon rich silicon oxide (SRSO), Er-clusters appear after annealing at 800 °C, limiting for both cases the luminescence efficiency.39 Concerning the Ce doping, the same clustering effect has been observed at TA = 900 °C in SiO1.5.19,35,40 However, in the present study, all the HRTEM images do not show lattice fringes and very diffuse rings characteristic of amorphous materials are observed in the FFT images. In other words, no trace of the Ce clustering effect has been detected in any film annealed at 700 °C or 900 °C. This result confirms that the introduction of nitrogen in the silicon-based matrix prevents the formation of RE clusters,22 even at low N2 flow (0.75 sccm). Since no RE clustering has been detected for any N2 flow studied, the scenario of an activation of emitting centers (case (α)) can be excluded.
For deeper investigation, EDX analysis was performed as a function of depth on the 2 sscm sample for a 700 °C annealing (Fig. 3d). It was concluded that Ce ions are present across the whole film thickness with an increased signal intensity close to the substrate over a thickness of a few nanometres, meaning a diffusion of Ce ions towards the substrate–film interface upon annealing. The EDX signal detected in the substrate is the background and not related to the presence of Ce ions. This diffusion has already been seen in other systems for high TA (1200 °C) treatments where Ce silicate is formed at the substrate–film interface.35 But in our case, the analysis on the as-deposited layer shows the same Ce distribution profile indicating that this is not due to the thermal budget. This migration is due to the diffusion of Ce into the region near the interface as a way to lower the energy of the system.22,38 In addition, no Ce oxide (e.g. CeO2 or Ce6O11)16,27 or eventually Ce silicates (e.g. Ce2Si2O7 or Ce4.667 (SiO4)3O)27 have been detected in samples annealed at 900 °C (see Fig. 3b) eliminating such luminescence centers discussed previously. Thus, since the BT can be excluded as discussed above, the observed PL band intensity detected at 450 nm for the layer deposited under a N2 gas flow at 2 sccm seems to be related to the isolated Ce3+ ion luminescence centers.
XPS analysis
XPS was performed to investigate the nature of Ce ions involved, because cerium ions can exist both in trivalent (Ce3+) or tetravalent (Ce4+) forms. Indeed, since the target used was CeO2, one can expect that the potential presence of Ce4+ ions in the samples could be a barrier for any applications due to its non-optical activity. Thus, it is necessary to determine the Ce oxidation level in the samples which can be determined by XPS measurements. High resolution XPS spectra were fitted for a sputtering time of 240 s corresponding to the middle of the film thickness. The O, Si, N and Ce concentrations were 4.9, 62.5, 32.0, and 0.6 at% for the 0.75 sccm sample and 11.1, 45.6, 42.7, and 0.6 at% for the 2 sccm sample, respectively and are correlated with the RBS measurements (see the RBS section – Fig. 7).
XPS spectra of the as-deposited films with 0.75 sccm and 2 sccm N2 flow are displayed in Fig. 4a. The spectra are very similar for both films. Two large peaks emerge at about 880–890 eV and 900–910 eV fitted with four components given in Table 1 and typically attributed to a Ce3+ ion signature.

The energy separations of the film grown with 2 sccm are close to those observed in the Si3N4 matrix (see the Ellipsometry section) with v′ − vo = 4.2 eV and u′ − uo = 4.7 eV. Independently of the charge correction, Anandan et al. found, from CeO2 deposited on Si3N4 (annealed at 600 °C) the following characteristic differences in the peaks associated with Ce3+, v’ − vo = 4.0 eV and u′ − uo = 4.2 eV (Table 1).41 Taking into account that CeO2 on Si3N4 and Ce doped Si3N4 are different systems, the energy differences found by XPS are consistent. The XPS characteristic peak at 918 eV, usually attributed to Ce4+ ions, is not detectable in this study.41,42 This also indicates that the cerium electronic state is exclusively Ce3+. Fig. 4b shows the Ce3+ ion distribution in two selected films as a function of depth. In order to explain the obtained results, we have calibrated the experimental data using the relationship between the etching time and layer thickness. Three different zones were identified: the deposited film with a thickness ∼100 nm, the substrate and an interface region located between the substrate and film with an approximate thickness of 35 nm. Fig. 4b shows that in the as-deposited films, Ce3+ ions are detected for both films in similar concentrations of 0.5–0.6 at%. On the other hand, in the interface region at a N2 flux rate of 2 sccm, an increase of Ce3+ ion concentration is detected indicating the migration of the Ce element toward the substrate–film interface and confirming the conclusion of the TEM analysis presented in Fig. 3d (see TEM section). At the same time, the Ce3+ migration is less pronounced, and even does not seem to occur, for the sample deposited at a lower N2 flux rate of 0.75 sccm. Indeed, due to the lower incorporation, a less strain should be induced in the interface region resulting in a reduced Ce3+ ion migration.22 Note that Ce3+ ions appear to be detected in the substrate making us think of diffusion in the substrate. This is only due to the size of the X-ray spot (200 μm) and the lack of lateral resolution of the Ar+ sputtered crater and should not be taken into account.
In summary, the N2 flow seems not to play a role in the changing of the cerium ion oxidation state during the deposition, since Ce4+ ions are not present within the films. Thus, the possible emission as suggested by scenario β, involving Ce4+ ions correlated with oxygen vacancies in CeO2 to produce a Ce3+ emission, is highly unlikely. For both N2 flows, the oxidation state of Ce is fully (III), in which Ce3+ ions are optically active allowing a possible Ce activation and a PL signal in SiOxNy layers. Only the γ hypothesis is able to explain the observed PL emission under a high N2 flow which would influence the microstructural environment of the 5d band.

Fig. 5a shows the Si-2p fitted XPS spectra of the two annealed samples fabricated with 0.75 and 2 sccm N2 flows. No analysis on Ce–Si bonding could be done on the Si 2p spectra, because of the very low Ce concentration (i.e. 0.6 at%) with respect to Si (i.e. 32–46 at%). So only the Si chemical environments with O and N major elements can be discussed. Considering these two spectra, significant differences appear. For the 0.75 sccm spectrum, six components were required to obtain a fit, while only four are found for the sample produced with a 2 sccm N2 flow. For the latter, the major Si 2p3/2–Si 2p1/2 doublet located at 101.9 eV–102.5 eV is typical of a Si3N4 bonding state,41,43–45 and is dominant in the spectrum. The doublet peaking at lower energy (101.0 eV–101.6 eV) is attributed to a poorer nitrogen environment for the Si atoms, typically SiNx (x < 4/3) and has a minor contribution.44 Thus, reducing the N2 flow (0.75 sccm) favors the 101.0 eV–101.6 eV doublet while the 101.9 eV–102.5 eV Si3N4 one decreases compared to the sample grown with a 2 sccm flow. Note that the 99.7 eV–100.3 eV doublet typical of a Si0 environment from the elemental Si disappears for the highest N2 flow. No cerium silicate was observed by TEM and in addition, the Si4+ chemical state, generally observed in cerium silicate (e.g. Ce4.67Si3O13, Ce2SiO5, or Ce2Si2O7) at around 103–104 eV, has not been detected either confirming the absence of such Ce clusters.46,47

Considering the O 1s spectra, the major component is located at around 532.1 eV for both samples and is attributed to a SiOxNy environment as mentioned in the literature (Fig. 5b).48
N 1s XPS spectra are displayed in Fig. 6 for both N2 flows. The spectra exhibit a major component centered at around 397.8 eV which is typical of a nitride environment and logically attributed to a silicon nitride bonding with the formation of a SiNx (x < 4/3) phase.44,49,50 However, the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the 2 sccm sample is larger (1.63 eV) than that of the 0.75 sccm counterparts (1.21 eV). This enlargement could come from two components, but not enough spectrally split to be well fitted (not shown here). We can assume the presence of SiOxNy bondings in the 2 sccm sample because of the higher content of O (10 at% versus 4 at%).

To conclude, these XPS results show that the cerium element is in the Ce3+ valence state. A Si-rich SiNx (x < 4/3) matrix is achieved for low N2 flow (0.75 sccm) with free Si atoms, while for higher N2 flow (2 sccm), a matrix with both Si3N4 and SiOxNy bondings without free Si atoms is obtained. To get more information on the different layers, RBS measurements, spectroscopic ellipsometry and FTIR measurements have been carried out and the results are presented in the following sections.
Composition by RBS analysis

Fig. 7 displays the RBS measurements of the as-deposited samples with a N2 flow varied from 0.5 sccm to 2 sccm and deposited with a constant RF power density on Si and CeO2 targets fixed at 4.3 W cm−2 and 0.4 W cm−2, respectively.
 Fig. 7  Si, N, O and Ce atomic concentrations of the Ce-doped SiOxNy films as a function of N2 flow obtained by RBS analysis (● symbols) and XPS measurements (☆symbols). 
Low concentrations are measured from 8.9 to 12.8 at% for oxygen and 1.2 to 0.3 at% for cerium with respect to the N2 flow. This O amount is provided from the CeO2 target. The concentrations deduced from the XPS measurements are consistent with the RBS results. The low discrepancy in the Ce concentration values among XPS (0.6 at% Ce at 2 sccm) and RBS (0.3 at% Ce at 2 sccm) techniques can be explained by the use of different radiation sources and the fact that XPS is a surface sensitive technique. It appears that the N incorporation is done at the expense of the Si. Indeed, the significant concentration increase of N atoms occurs (∼16 to 46 at%) along with a decrease of Si (∼70 to 40 at%) to the same extent (30%). This same behavior was observed in previous studies in Er-doped silicon-rich oxynitrides (SRON) with the same experimental set up.51 This was also observed in the case of the PECVD technique for the N and O incorporations, which substitute to Si atoms in order to form SiOxNy.52 The compositions found with RBS measurements are in the same tendency as in the XPS analysis (see Fig. 7).
Ellipsometry analysis
The ellipsometry technique allows the determination of the optical parameters of the films such as the sub-layer thicknesses and the wavelength dependence of the optical index of each involved material. In this regard, we have conducted ellipsometry analysis for the as-deposited samples. The real part of the refractive index versus the wavelength is plotted in Fig. 8a for several as-deposited samples grown with different N2 fluxes (solid lines). These curves were compared with the optical index curves for the Si, Si3N4 and SiO2 phases (full lines). As expected, the Si peak centered at 375 nm is not observed for any of the as deposited layers, indicating that there is a mix of elements in the same phase instead of the highlighted phase separation (i.e. Si, Si3N4 and SiO2). The refractive index (left scale) and layer thickness (right scale) are displayed as a function of N2 flow (see Fig. 8b), with horizontal dashed lines depicting the Si, Si3N4 and SiO2 refractive indexes. For samples grown at low N2 flow (0.5 sccm), the refractive index is equal to 3.8 at 1.95 eV (636 nm) which corresponds to Si, confirming the low N2 incorporation in the layer. Increasing the N2 flow decreases the refractive index of the layers down to values corresponding to the refractive index of stoichiometric Si3N4 (nSi3N4 ≈ 2.0). For the samples grown under higher N2 flow (2 sccm), the refractive index is even slightly below 2.0 (n ≈ 1.9) which corresponds to the SiOxNy matrix with low oxygen concentration.53 Concerning the layer thicknesses, a decrease of almost 30% is observed, when the N2 flow changes. Indeed, the mean free path of particles in the plasma decreases with increasing N2 flow so that the deposition rate is reduced leading to a decrease of the thickness of the films.22,54

Bruggeman model
From the ellipsometry data, a modeling of the material taking into account 3 phases has been carried out by using the effective medium theory (EMT).53,55 The modeling took into account only the 500–700 nm part of the measured spectrum since the experimental data do not show the Si peak at 375 nm. The EMT theory is described by eqn (1): (1)where VSi, VSiO2, and VSi3N4 are the volume fractions of Si, SiO2 and Si3N4 phases respectively, and εSi, εSiO2 and εSi3N4 the dielectric permittivities of each phase, εh is the dielectric permittivity of the host matrix and ε is the one measured by ellipsometry. In the Bruggeman effective medium approximation, ε is taken equal to εh and the layer is considered as a random mixing of three phases (here Si, Si3N4 and SiO2). The sum of the three individual volume fractions is equal to 1. This approach results in the following eqn (2) and (3): VSi + VSi3N4 + VSiO2 = 1(2) (3)
The phase volume fractions have been deduced from the least squares method and are displayed in Table 2 with the εh deduced from the refractive index of Fig. 8a for each N2 flow, while εSi, εSiO2 and εSi3N4 were taken from the database.56 The O concentration was taken from RBS measurements to have an approximation of the VSiO2 phase and was injected into the equations passing from an equation with 3 unknowns to 2 unknowns. The data in Table 2 show that a low N2 flow (0.5 sccm) leads to a huge Si content, as expected, while for the intermediate N2 flows (0.75 sccm and 1 sccm) the volume fractions of the Si and Si3N4 phases reverse. Finally, the Si3N4 phase is predominant for a high N2 flow (2 sccm), with an increase of the SiO2 volume fraction linked to the important Si phase reduction that explains the achievement of a refractive index below Si3N4 one (see Fig. 8b).

As seen above (see the TEM section), although the microscopy analysis does not reveal a phase separation for any TA, the Bruggeman model can give the behavior of the atomic concentration through the phase proportion (eqn (3)). The atomic fractions (fi) of each species i (i = Si, Si3N4 and SiO2) are deduced from the phase volume fractions, with the help of eqn (4), (5) and (6), in order to obtain the atomic fraction of Si, N and O, respectively: (4) (5) fO = 1 − (fSi + fN)(6)where ρi and Mi are the density and the molar weight of the phase i, respectively.57

Fig. 9 shows a comparison of the atomic concentrations obtained by RBS measurements and by Bruggeman modeling. The N and Si atomic concentrations obtained by Bruggeman modeling are close to the ones deduced from the RBS experiments for the N2 flux going from 0.75 up to 2 sccm flux. For the 0.5 sccm flux, a larger difference is observed which can be explained by the uncertainty of the measured ε parameter. Indeed, for the low N flux, the layer is mainly composed of silicon deposited on a Si substrate. The ellipsometry measurements are not precise enough because of the weak index contrast between the Si substrate and the subsequent film. Finally, the modeling demonstrates that with a N2 flux below 2 sccm, a Si “phase” is present and likely kills the expected luminescence of Ce ions, as observed previously for enriched Ce-doped SiO1.5 films on Si.40 The γ scenario mentioned above in the optical analysis part, involving the surrounding media of Ce, is then confirmed. For 2 sccm, the samples contain mainly two phases (Si3N4 and SiO2) which exhibit a Ce PL signal since no free Si phase is detected.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
FTIR analysis was performed to characterize the influence of the N2 flux on the Si–N bonds, as well as the Si–O bonds resulting from the O atoms supplied by the sputtering of the CeO2 target. Fig. 10 displays the FTIR spectra obtained at the Brewster angle of the as-deposited samples with different N2 flows.
 Fig. 10  Infrared spectra (FTIR) of the Ce-doped SiOxNy films depending on the nitrogen flow. 
For the sample grown at the lowest N2 flow (0.5 sccm), an almost flat spectrum is observed without a sharp peak. The N2 flux favors the N incorporation as evidenced by the appearance of two vibration bands around 840 and 990 cm−1 for 0.75 sccm. These two peaks correspond to the TOSi–N transversal optical mode and LOSi–N longitudinal optical mode58 and shift towards high energies with increasing flux. The LOSi–N band blueshifts from 1000 cm−1 for 0.75 sccm to 1060 cm−1 for samples grown at 1 sccm and 1125 cm−1 for 2 sccm, respectively, while the TOSi–N band shifts to a lesser extent. These band shifts have already been observed in SiNx:H films and SiNx films. In SiNx:H films, the shift was attributed to the replacement of a N atom by a H atom in a Si–N bond.59 In SiNx films, Debieu et al.58 observed this same blueshift and noted also that the TOSi–N band position is less sensitive to the composition. The origin of this blueshift is attributed to a better organization of the layer. Indeed, the N incorporation tends to stabilize the Si3N4 phase as mentioned in Table 2.
Among the different N2 fluxes, a PL emission is only observed for the 2 sccm sample (Fig. 1a) which is then investigated hereafter. To identify the Si–N peaks in the 2 sccm sample, a SiNx reference sample with the same N2 flow rate at 2 sccm but without Ce and consequently without O doping has been deposited. A refractive index close to Si3N4 was found. Fig. 11a shows the FTIR spectrum along with the fit revealing three peaks centered at 848, 974 and 1121 cm−1. Such peaks were identified in previous studies on SiNx matrices22,23,60 and correspond to the TOSiN, Si–N–Si bond and LOSiN mode, respectively. With the help of this first identification step on Si–N bonds, the FTIR spectrum of the Ce and O doping sample grown with a 2 sccm N2 flow is displayed in Fig. 11b. Three new peaks are detected in the fitting process and attributed to the Si–O bonds in addition to the three Si–N bonds observed in the Si3N4 matrix. The Si–N bonds are centered at 856, 955 and 1140 cm−1, close to the Si3N4 peak positions mentioned above. Two peaks centered at 1065 and 1211 cm−1 are ascribed to the TO3Si–O transversal optical mode and LO3Si–O longitudinal optical modes respectively confirming the oxygen incorporation in the layer.61–65 The last peak at 1250 cm−1 corresponds to the Si–O TO4 modes.66

Therefore, the presented FTIR data and analysis confirm the existence of a phase similar to the expected Si3N4 phase, which support further the claim that the synthesized Ce-doped SiOxNy material has a good organization.
Excitation mechanism
The discussion presented in the PL and PLE section highlighted different assumptions and scenarios related to the nature of emitting centers and how they are respectively activated. Specifically, the (i) band tails, (ii) CeO2 and (iii) Ce clusters were excluded in favor of the (iv) presence of Ce3+ ions (see the XPS section) and their signature in the PLE spectrum (see the PL and PLE section). In the same way, different scenarios were proposed to explain the Ce3+ emission for only a high N2 flux (2 sccm). Namely, we have considered three cases: (α) the decrease of Ce cluster formation with the N2 flux was mentioned as a possible cause; however no cluster was observed for any N2 flux investigated, (β) a possible modification of the oxidation state from Ce(IV) to (III) was also cited, but rejected by cross-checking the PL and XPS results. (γ) Finally, the surrounding host structure of Ce was considered. In this scenario, two different mechanisms were proposed: the nephelauxetic effect and Si atoms surrounding Ce that annihilate the emission. These last two mechanisms are discussed in detail below.
Concerning the nephelauxetic effect, the Ce3+ ion emission had been reported at different emission wavelengths depending on the host matrices. Usually, this emission is located in the UV-blue spectral region but could be observed also in the green or red regions for Ce3+ doped YSixOyNz or Y2O2S matrices, respectively.67,68 For our SiOxNy matrix, a previous study showed a red shift of Ce3+ ion emission from 400 nm for N-free samples to 476 nm for high N content (40 at%).20 This PL shift, called the nephelauxetic effect, comes from the interaction between the 5d band and the local environment.69 Note that this effect is amplified by the fact that the N content is predominant compared to O as underlined by Y. Li et al.36 Such an effect is illustrated in Fig. 12a and b for the extreme limits of the N content, respectively.
 Fig. 12  Schematic representation of the nephelauxetic effect (scenario γ), the Si atoms surrounding Ce and the band gap variation for (a) low and (b) high nitrogen flux. 
In our study, for samples grown at low N2 flux (0.5 to 1 sccm), the 5d band could be localized at higher energy owing to the nephelauxetic effect (lower wavelength 325 nm) (see Fig. 12a). No Ce3+ ion emission was detected at 325 nm excitation wavelength (Fig. 1a) and only the BT emission centered at 400 nm is detectable. If the shift caused by the nephelauxetic effect is large then such excitation energy is not enough to excite the 5d band. Interestingly enough, even for higher excitation (275 nm) no emission is observed (not shown here), meaning that the nephelauxetic effect is not responsible for the Ce3+ ion optical activation. In this case, Si atoms surrounding Ce3+ ions block the Ce3+ ion emission. Indeed, the previous results showed that a higher Si concentration for a lower N2 flux allows Ce3+ ions to back transfer their energy to neighbor Si atoms. Hence, such an environment kills the Ce3+ ion emission.70
A last point needs more clarification. Even if using a RE like cerium is advantageous considering the Ce3+ ion direct excitation process present in our system as mentioned at the beginning of this study, the matrix absorption cannot be ignored nor the possible matrix-RE energy transfer. Due to the fact that N incorporation to the host matrix could be controlled, the matrix gap changes from a low value around 1.1 eV for the lowest N content (close to Si bulk) and tends to become similar to the Si3N4 bandgap of 3.3 eV for higher N2 flux. The bandgap increases even further (∼4.0 eV) for the samples grown with a N2 flux at 2 sccm corresponding to SiOxNy. Therefore, due to the simultaneous crossing of the increasing bandgap and the nephelauxetic effect (i.e. lower energetic position of the 5d level),71,72 one can expect an overlapping effect as schematically shown in Fig. 12b. To have a deeper understanding of this overlap, the PLE spectrum and the corresponding PL spectra at different excitation wavelengths of the 2 sccm sample are shown in Fig. 13a and b, respectively. The PLE spectrum is the same as Fig. 1b, which indicated a direct excitation of the Ce3+,19,32 but now in a larger excitation range from 250 nm to 400 nm. In this range, the PL spectra (Fig. 13b) have the same shape as the Ce3+ ion emission seen in Fig. 1a (excited at 325 nm), whatever the excitation wavelengths between 250 nm and 400 nm. This fact demonstrates that Ce3+ ions can effectively excite in a large spectral range.
 Fig. 13  (a) PLE spectrum of Ce-doped SiOxNy measured in the 250–400 nm spectral range and (b) the corresponding PL spectra of Ce3+ ions in SiOxNy samples deposited with a 2 sccm N2 flux annealed at 700 °C. The inset in panel (a) shows the PLE spectrum of the reference undoped SiOxNy sample. 
Then, either the 5d energy band is much enlarged at high N2 flux making direct excitation easy or the matrix comes into play and favors an indirect excitation mechanism. Indeed, the PL of the undoped SiOxNy, as the reference sample, at high N2 flux (inset of Fig. 13a), shows a maximum emission at 350 nm when excited at 275 nm. This emission wavelength corresponds to the maximum excitation range detected in the Ce3+ PLE spectrum (Fig. 13a). Such an overlap confirms indirect energy transfer from the matrix to the Ce3+ ion (Fig. 12b), for the shorter excitation wavelength (Fig. 13a). In conclusion, direct excitation of Ce3+ ions is predominant between 300 and 400 nm and indirect excitation, from 250 nm to 275 nm at least, is possible via the matrix with the high N2 flux sample (Fig. 13a), whereas such excitation mechanisms are not possible for samples grown with low N2 flux rates (0.5 to 1 sccm).
Evolution of the photoluminescence with higher Ce concentration
Taking into account all the growth parameters already discussed for achieving a good Ce3+ ion emission (i.e. 2 sccm N2 flux), a new set of Ce-doped samples deposited with higher RF power density applied on the CeO2 target (up to 2.1 W cm−2) has been deposited. Specifically, this set includes the undoped SiOxNy reference sample (see the inset of Fig. 13a), the best Ce3+ ion emitting thin film (see Fig. 1) containing 0.3 at% of Ce measured by RBS and two additional Ce3+ ion samples having 4 at% and 6 at% of Ce measured also by RBS. Fig. 14a displays the PL spectra and Fig. 14b shows the corresponding integrated PL intensity of these samples as a function of the RF power density applied and the Ce3+ concentration (integrated PL intensity was obtained by integrating the PL spectra between 400 and 675 nm).
 Fig. 14  (a) PL spectra of SiOxNy: Ce3+ films deposited with different power densities applied on the CeO2 target and (b) the corresponding integrated PL intensity. Insets show the optical images of the SiOxNy: Ce3+ samples under UV excitation at 340 nm and their corresponding RBS concentrations. 
The PL intensity increases nonlinearly with the RF power density up to 2.1 W cm−2 on the CeO2 target corresponding to 6 at%. This increasing of PL intensity attests a good incorporation of Ce3+ ions and an efficient optical activity even at high doping. Indeed, the PL intensity is almost 70 times higher at 6 at% compared to the 0.3 at% film, and this important Ce3+ concentration is 6 times higher compared to other studies.20
A similar PL intensity dependence on the dopant content was already observed in other matrices such as SiO2,35,73 but a PL intensity saturation effect is detected due the formation of Ce clusters or silicates. In the present study, the integrated PL intensity shows a monotonic increase with the rare earth doping level change, without saturation, confirming the lack of Ce cluster or silicate phase formation due to the presence of nitrogen. Furthermore, we have performed microscopy analysis (not shown here) which confirms that our films are amorphous without any evidence of crystallized precipitates even at the highest Ce content studied (6 at%). Finally, to demonstrate that the developed SiOxNy: Ce3+ thin films are efficient emitters, we took pictures of selected samples excited at 340 nm at room temperature (see Fig. 14(b) insets). It can be seen that bright blue emission was observed under the regular room ambient lighting conditions, attesting to a good quantum yield of SiOxNy: Ce3+ with 6 at% of Ce compared to 0.3 at%. Under the same excitation/detection conditions, the undoped sample does not show observable visual emission.
Conclusions
In this study, we investigated the influence of a reactive nitrogen flux during the deposition of Ce-doped SiOxNy films on the matrix structure and the emission behavior of highly doped films.
By increasing the N2 flux, four different matrices were deposited. The first one, at a low N2 flux, is composed mainly of bulk Si which is confirmed by the high Si concentration revealed by RBS. The fourth, under a high N2 flow (2 sccm), is a mixture of SiO2 and Si3N4 phases. The Si, SiO2, Si3N4 phase volume fractions have been deduced from the Bruggeman modeling. The FTIR data confirm the presence of Si3N4 phases and characteristic interatomic bonds (Si–N and Si–O) of the SiOxNy matrix. Above all, the N incorporation in the deposited film is well established during the process. The TEM images don't show clusters or silicates after high temperature annealing, demonstrating the N incorporation effect.
Photoluminescence measurements show a wide blue emission from 400 nm to 650 nm under UV excitation for samples grown at a high nitrogen flux (2 sccm) and no emission for a lower flux. After considering the possible luminescence centers including band tails, CeO2, Ce clusters, and Ce3+ ions, the Ce3+ ion is identified by XPS analysis and PLE spectroscopy as the origin of the observed emission. The different scenarios relevant to activate the Ce3+ emission, according to the N incorporation, are also investigated. All the results converge to indicate that the change of the Ce3+ ion environment explains the modification of the luminescence properties when free from the Si phase. It was concluded that a Si phase is present only in the matrix for materials grown at low N content where it interacts with Ce3+ ions causing non-radiative energy transfer between the Ce3+ ion and its surrounding host structure. Furthermore, nitrogen induces a red shift of the Ce3+ ion emission compared to Ce-doped SiOx due to the nephelauxetic effect. In addition, direct and indirect excitations have been highlighed for Ce3+ ions in the SiOxNy host matrix: a direct excitation under 300 to 400 nm wavelength excitation and an indirect excitation via matrix-RE energy transfer are possible for lower wavelength excitation.
Taking into account the optimized nitrogen growth parameters, the Ce concentration was increased in the films giving a strong blue emission visible to the naked eye. The integrated intensity of samples doped up to 6 at% shows no signs of quenching. Moreover heavily doped films are still amorphous and show no traces of Ce cluster or silicate formation. Ce doped silicon oxynitrides are promising donor materials in down-conversion (e.g. Ce3+–Yb3+) as well as light emitting devices for electroluminescence due to the bright photoluminescence from the Ce3+ ion and its high solubility in SiOxNy matrix. Such a material system is advantageous for such applications compared with other Si based matrices where clustering and phase separation are observed.
