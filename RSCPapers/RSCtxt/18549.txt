    , Accepted 1st May 2014First published on 2nd May 2014AbstractHighly efficient Cr3+- and Yb3+/Nd3+-co-activated YAl3(BO3)4 (YAB) phosphors have been developed as spectral convertors for improving silicon solar cell photovoltaic conversion efficiency. In the YAB lattice, Cr3+ ions act as broadband spectral sensitizers by absorbing UV-Vis (370–750 nm) photons, which are not absorbed by the silicon solar cell. After energy transfer, the Yb3+ acceptors then exhibit strong NIR emission centered at around 1000 nm, which is coupled well with the absorption band of the silicon solar cell. Efficient energy transfer is reflected by a sharp decrease in the excited state lifetime and red photoluminescence (PL) from Cr3+ with increasing Yb3+ concentration. Further evidence in favor of energy transfer is that PL-excitation spectra of NIR luminescence from Yb3+ are identical to those of deep red emission from Cr3+. Trivalent ions Gd3+, Bi3+ and La3+ have been introduced into YAl3(BO3)4:Cr3+,Yb3+ in this study for a stronger NIR PL intensity. Additionally, energy transfer from Cr3+ to Nd3+ is also observed. Yb3+,Nd3+-co-activated YAB shows much broader NIR emission. Due to the effective absorption of Cr3+ in the visible region in YAB and the efficient energy transfer to Yb3+/Nd3+, these materials can be developed as spectral convertors to improve silicon solar cell photovoltaic conversion efficiency.
1. Introduction
Sunlight is a free, green and abundant source of energy that can be captured by photovoltaic cells and transformed into electricity.1,2 If the tiniest fraction of that sunlight were to be captured by photovoltaic cells that turn it straight into electricity, there would be no need to emit any greenhouse gases from any power plant.3 Despite significant development of the photovoltaic (PV) industry over the past decades, the efficient conversion of solar energy into electricity through PV cells remains a daunting task.4 The main source of energy loss (over 70%) is related to the spectral mismatch of incident solar photon energies to the energy gap (Eg) of a solar cell.5,6 Solar cells generate a single electron–hole pair upon absorbing a photon above the band gap, which means that photons with energy higher than the band gap are absorbed, but the excess energy is not effectively used and released as heat.1
The rare earth (RE) ion doped luminescent materials that can convert the near-UV and visible absorption into near-infrared emission around 1000 nm have attracted intensive interest due to their promising application as spectral convertors to improve the photovoltaic conversion of c-Si solar cells. Among these research studies, the Yb3+ ion has been identified as an almost ideal acceptor species for this purpose, as it possesses only a single excited state, 2F2/5, which is located close to the maximum of the spectral efficiency of c-Si solar cells.6,7 Various trivalent RE ions, such as Pr3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Tb3+ and Tm3+, were firstly selected as the energy sensitizers for Yb3+ ions to realize the spectral conversion.6,8–12 However, only a small portion of the sunlight can be converted in these systems due to the nature of f–f transition. In order to make better use of the incident sunlight, the RE ions with f–d transition, such as such as Ce3+, Eu2+ and Yb2+,12–14 and the metal ions, such as Bi3+,15 were chosen as the energy donors for Yb3+ to realize the broadband spectral conversion.
The Cr3+ also has broad absorption bands in the visible region due to the spin allowed 4A2 → 4T2 and 4A2 → 4T1 transitions, and thus has been widely used as a luminescent sensitizer for RE ions, to obtain high excitation efficiency.16 For practical application, the spectral convertors need to be effectively activated by natural sunlight and also should be stable enough to survive the outside atmosphere. In this case, the selection of suitable energy absorbers with high pump efficiency and broadband absorption, and the choice of environmentally friendly hosts with excellent chemical, mechanical and thermal stabilities are of great importance.
On the other side, yttrium aluminum borate YAl3(BO3)4 (YAB) is one of the most desirable hosts for RE ions. One good example that combined the merits of Cr3+ broadband absorption and YAB excellent chemical and mechanical stability is the Cr3+-doped YAB single crystals. Due to the highly efficient absorption of Cr3+ ions in the YAB host, this material has been suggested to be used in solar-pumped lasers, in which the solar radiation was used as the pumping source.17,18
In this work we have studied the optical spectra of Cr3+–Yb3+, Cr3+–Nd3+ and Cr3+–Yb3+–Nd3+-doped YAB crystals. In our research, the YAB was chosen as the doping host for Cr3+ and Yb3+, in which the Cr3+ acts as the energy absorber to harvest the incident sunlight and meanwhile as the energy sensitizer for Yb3+/Nd3+. Trivalent ions Gd3+, Bi3+ and La3+ were introduced into YAB:Cr3+,Yb3+ in this study for stronger NIR PL intensity, and Nd3+ for broader NIR PL bandwidth. By taking advantage of the spin allowed 4A2 → 4T2 and 4A2 → 4T1 absorption of Cr3+ and the efficient energy transfer to Yb3+, the outstanding point of Cr3+–Yb3+ co-doped YAB compared with other phosphors is that YAB:Cr3+,Yb3+ can convert almost high-energy UV-Vis photons into low-energy NIR photons efficiently, which benefits the enhancement of silicon solar photovoltaic conversion efficiency.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis
The powder samples of YAl3(BO3)4 phosphors were prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction. The starting materials Y2O3 99.9%, Al2O3 99.9%, Cr2O3 99.9%, Yb2O3 99.9%, Nd2O3 99.9%, Lu2O3 99.9%, Gd2O3 99.9%, Bi2O3 99.9%, and La2O3 99.9% were weighed in stoichiometric amounts (an excess amount of H3BO3 99.9% was added to obtain a single phase) and subsequently mixed and ground together by grinding in an agate mortar. The powder mixtures were synthesized by sintering at 1200 °C for 5 h. The as-synthesized samples were then cooled to room temperature naturally. Finally, the samples were ground to powder for subsequent analysis.
2.2 Characterization
All measurements were made using finely ground powder. The structure of as-prepared samples was checked by using a Rigaku DMAX 2000 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) (40 kV, 40 mA). Rietveld refinements of the X-ray diffractograms were conducted using the MAUD (Materials Analysis Using Diffraction) program. And the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra and the luminescence decay in visible and infrared regions were recorded by using a FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 500 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer by using BaSO4 as a reference. An electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER Zennium, Germany) was used to obtain the current–voltage characteristics of the commercial c-Si solar cells before and after employing the luminescent down-shifting phosphor YAB:Cr3+,Yb3+. The total cell area measured is 9 cm2. The illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light during the measurements came from an Oriel Sol 3A solar simulator (Newport-69920) equipped with a Xe lamp (450 W) and an AM1.5G filter. EQE was measured by controlled intensity modulated photospectroscopy (CIMPS-2, Zahner Co., Germany) under ambient conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 XRD refinement and lattice parameters
The phase purities of the YAl2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4, Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 and Y0.88Yb0.07Bi0.05Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 compounds were confirmed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The Rietveld refinements from XRD patterns indicate that these three compounds exhibit the same crystalline trigonal crystal system. Additionally, the Rietveld refinement results demonstrate that the as-prepared phosphors were identified to be YAl3(BO3)4 (JCPDS Card no. 72-1978) and typically one impurity phase Al20B4O36 (JCPDF Card no. 80-2300) (Fig. 1). Huntite-type YAl3(BO3)4 belongs to the space group R32 with cell parameters of a = b = 9.295 Å, c = 7.243 Å, α = β = 90° and γ = 120°. The concentrations of the impurity phases Al20B4O36 in YAl2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4, Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 and Y0.88Yb0.07Bi0.05Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 were 2.29%, 3.47%, and 4.93% wt%, respectively. Notably, a small quantity of impurity phases negligibly affects the energy transfer.19–21 The detailed crystallographic data are listed in Table 1. Fractional coordinates of YAl2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4, Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4, and Y0.88Yb0.07Bi0.05 Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 are shown in Table 2. The crystal structures of YAl2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4, Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 and Y0.88Yb0.07Bi0.05Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 from the literature were used as the initial parameters for the Rietveld refinement of the prepared powders.

Wang et al.22 proposed that both trivalent rare-earth and transition metal ions (e.g. Cr3+) can be doped into the material, where rare-earth ions then occupy yttrium sites and transition metal ions replace Al3+ on sites of octahedral symmetry. Trivalent rare-earth ions unquestionably occupy yttrium sites,17,23 however, they did not give any reliable evidence for the occupancy behaviour of Cr3+.17,22,24
As an illustration, we tried to prepare two different Cr3+ doped YAB samples, Cr3+ ions occupying the Al3+ site and the Y3+ site, respectively. Results from experiments show that Cr3+ ion occupied Y3+ site samples presented more impurity phases than Cr3+ ion occupied Al3+ site samples. This may preliminarily indicate that Cr3+ ions occupy the Al3+ site. More conclusive evidence was given in the results of the refinement; cell parameters of YAB with substitution of Al3+ by Cr3+ did not increase but slightly decrease. Repetitive experiments show the same results and only substitution of Al3+ by Cr3+ can get better results of Rietveld refinement (see in Table 3). It gives an explanation to the slight decrease in the YAB lattice.

3.2 Typical features of YAB:Cr3+,Yb3+
To illustrate the advantage of our YAB:Cr3+,Yb3+, we demonstrate the characterization of the absorption spectra for the Cr3+/Yb3+-activated YAB (shown in Fig. 3(a)). Purely YAB and YAB:Yb3+ nearly show no absorption in the UV-Vis region. YAB:Cr3+ shows a wide absorption band from 370 to 750 nm, and is composed of two broad bands centered around 425 and 590 nm, which correspond to the spin-allowed (ΔS = 0) 4A2 → 4T1 and 4A2 → 4T2 transitions, respectively. The small pumps at 683 nm can be assigned to the spin-forbidden (ΔS = 1) Cr3+: 4A2 → 2T1 absorption in a slightly distorted octahedral site.25 The inset shows the apparent color of Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4. As we know that the c-Si based cell cannot make good use of the UV-Vis light, the broadband absorption bandwidth of YAB:Cr3+ is fabulous for efficient capture of the incident solar energy.
 Fig. 3  (a) Absorption spectra for different doped contents; the inset circle is the apparent color of YAl3 (BO3)4 and Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4. (b) PLE and PL spectra of Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4 (red line) and YVO4: Bi3+,Yb3+ (black line); the dashed line represents each visible part . 
Thus we introduced Yb3+ into YAB:Cr3+ for converting UV-Vis sunlight to intense NIR emission. As shown in Fig. 3(b), YVO4:Bi3+,Yb3+ was the best sample we had prepared before.7 Under the excitation of 4T1 and 4T2 energy levels at 425 and 590 nm, the PL spectra of Cr3+ were recorded (red dashed line). The sharp R-line emission at 683 nm assigned to Cr3+ 2E → 4A2 transition, and a broadband emission located around 705 nm due to the spin allowed observation of 4T2 → 4A2 emission. The near-infrared emission at 983 nm originating from Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition can also be clearly observed under the excitations of Cr3+:4T1 and 4T2 energy levels, which would not show in YAB:Yb3+. It exhibits nearly the same PLE peak shape when monitored at 983 nm (black solid line) and 683 nm (red dashed line), two intense broad bands centered at 425 and 590 nm attributed to the typical spin-allowed 4A2 → 4T1 and 4A2 → 4T2 transitions of Cr3+, also the same shape as the absorption spectra of YAB:Cr3+,Yb3+, indicates that the absorbed sunlight can be utilized, and the energy can be transferred from Cr3+ → Yb3+. Accordingly, we illustrate the simplified energy level diagrams of Cr3+ and Yb3+ in the YAB hosts (Fig. 3(c)). We compared our best sample Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4 with the well-known spectra convert phosphor YVO4: Bi3+,Yb3+;26,27 it is obvious that the excitation band of Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4 is broader than YVO4: Bi3+,Yb3+, and the NIR emission intensity of Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4 is stronger than YVO4: Bi3+,Yb3+.
3.3 Optical properties of Y1−nYbnAl2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 (n = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.07, 0.11, and 0.15)
This section describes the synthesis of the Cr3+–Yb3+ system with a donor having a broad band excitation to verify its feasibility. The concentration of the activator is kept at 7% for Cr3+,22 and that for Yb3+ is changed from 0 to 15%.

Fig. 4(a) shows the normalized Vis PL spectra for six Cr3+ and Yb3+-co-activated Y1−nYbnAl2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4 phosphors with different dopant contents n of 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.07, 0.11, and 0.15, respectively. Under 420 nm excitation, the Vis PL intensity decreased with increasing concentration of Yb3+. Fig. 4(b) plots the NIR emission spectra of the samples with different Yb3+ concentrations. As expected, no NIR PL is found in the studied spectral region from Y1−nYbnAl2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4 (n = 0). Only after co-doping with Yb3+, a sharp peak with a maximum at 983 nm arises. This emission can be excited via the entire UV-Vis band from 370–650 nm (date not shown). All observed NIR emissions are readily attributed to radiative decay from the lowest stark level of Yb3+,2F2/5, to the stark level of the ground state of Yb3+,2F2/7. The appearance of the characteristic NIR PL from Yb3+ centers is taken as direct evidence for the energy transfer from Cr3+ to Yb3+. In this case, Cr3+ acts as a sensitizer by absorbing UV-Vis photons and transferring the absorbed energy to Yb3+ centers. With increasing Yb3+ concentration, the emission intensity of Yb3+ increases, maximizing at about n = 0.07; it also happened when excited at 590 nm. Concentration quenching occurs, when n > 0.07 (the inset of Fig. 4(b)). Concentration quenching is mainly caused by the non radiative energy transfer among Yb3+ ions, which usually occurs as a result of an exchange interaction, radiation reabsorption or a multipole–multipole interaction.28,29

Normalized PL decay curves of Cr3+ in Y1−nYbnAl2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 were measured and are represented in Fig. 5.As described by Blasse and Grabmaier,30 it is well established that the decay behavior of Cr3+ can be expressed by I = I0exp(−t/τ)(1)where I and I0 are the luminescence intensities at time t and 0, and τ is the luminescence lifetime. On the basis of eqn (1) and decay curves, the lifetime values were determined to be 158.39, 125.49, 104.35, 76.94, 68.79, and 60.52 μs for Y1−nYbnAl2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 with n = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.07, 0.11, and 0.15, respectively. The decay lifetime for Cr3+ was found to decrease with increasing Yb3+ dopant content, which is strong evidence for the energy transfer from Cr3+ → Yb3+.

According to Dexter and Schulman, concentration quenching is in many cases due to energy transfer from one activator to another until an energy sink in the lattice is reached.22 As suggested by Blasse,30 the average separation RC can be expressed by (2)where N is the number of Z ions in the unit cell and V is the volume of the unit cell. For the YAl3(BO3)4 host, N = 6 and V = 540.4 Å3. x is the total concentration of Cr3+ and Yb3+. Thus, RC (in Å) is determined to be 25.8, 17.9, 13.5, 11.6, and 10.5 for n = 0.01, 0.03, 0.07, 0.11, and 0.15, respectively, in Y1−nYbnAl2–79Cr0.21(BO3)4. The critical concentration xc, at which the luminescence intensity of Cr3+ is half of that in the sample in the absence of Yb3+, is 0.07. Therefore, the critical distance (Rc) of energy transfer was calculated to be about 11.6 Å.
On the basis of Dexter's energy transfer formula of multipolar interaction and Reisfeld's approximation the following relation can be obtained by31,32 (3)where η0 and η are, respectively, the luminescence quantum efficiency of Cr3+ in the absence and presence of Yb3+; C is the sum of the content of Cr3+ and Yb3+; n = 6, 8, and 10, corresponding to dipole–dipole, dipole–quadrupole, and quadrupole–quadrupole interactions, respectively. The value η0/η is approximately calculated by the ratio of related luminescence intensities as31 (4)where IS0 is the intrinsic luminescence intensity of Cr3+ and IS is the luminescence intensity of Cr3+ in the presence of Yb3+. The IS0/IS–Cn/3 plot is presented in Fig. 6(a)–(c), and only when n = 6 does it show a linear relation. This clearly indicates that the energy transfer from Cr3+ to Yb3+ is the dipole–dipole mechanism.

3.4 Photoluminescence enhancement by introduction of Gd3+, Bi3+ and La3+
This section describes on how we enhance the NIR emission intensity. The concentration of Yb3+ and Cr3+ are both kept at 7% which is thought to be the best concentration. The dependence of the integrated NIR emission intensity of 983 nm under excitation of 420 nm radiation on the M3+ (M = Lu, Gd, Bi, or La) doped Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 phosphors is shown in Fig. 7. As the Gd3+ doping concentration increases, the NIR emitting intensity from Yb3+ first increases, reaching a maximum value when the Gd3+concentration is equal to that of Yb3+ (7%). Then it decreases, accompanying a further increase of Gd3+ concentration (Fig. 7(a)). It happened when Y3+ is replaced with Bi3+ (Fig. 7(b)) and La3+ (Fig. 7(c)), coming to a maximum value when the concentrations are 9% and 7%, respectively. We also substituted Lu3+ for Y3+ and found that the NIR emitting intensity did not increase but decreased (date not shown).

The ionic radii (Å) of cations for CN = 6 are shown in Table 4. The size order of the ionic radius is Lu3+ < Y3+ < Gd3+ < Bi3+ < La3+. We can draw such a conclusion that when the substituendum's radius is less than Y3+, it was useless for improving the emission intensity, but when the substituendum's radius is greater than Y3+, the emission intensity would strengthen effectively. This means that the replacement of Y3+ with Gd3+, Bi3+, and La3+ will result in better emission intensities of Yb3+.

We compared the relative emission intensity of different cations to Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 in different aspects, the relative integral area of discharge and relative height, and the results are shown in the form of a histogram in Fig. 7(d). Both the aspects show that when the substitute ionic radius exceeds Y3+, the closer the radius to Y3+, the better emission intensity we will get. Theoretical reasons for this phenomenon will be studied in our future studies.
3.5 Broadening of YAl3(BO3)4:Cr3+,Yb3+ NIR PL bandwidth by introduction of Nd3+
This section describes on how we broaden the NIR PL bandwidth. Cr3+–Nd3+ co-doped YAB was first studied to establish the Nd3+ doping content. The concentration of the activator is kept at 7% for Cr3+, and that for Nd3+ is changed from 0 to 15%. Fig. 8(a) shows the PL and PLE spectra for eight Cr3+ and Nd3+-coactivated Y1−mNdmAl2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4 phosphors with different dopant contents m of 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.13 and 0.15, respectively. They showed the same trend as Y1−nYbnAl2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4 phosphors. Fig. 8(b) plots the NIR emission spectra of the samples with different Nd3+ concentrations; the near-infrared emission originated from Nd3+: 4F9/2 → 4I11/2 transition can also be clearly observed under the excitation of Cr3+: 4T1 and 4T2 energy levels, which indicates the energy transfer from Cr3+ to Nd3+. Under 420 nm excitation, with increasing Nd3+ concentration, the emission intensity of Cr3+ decreases and the emission intensity of Nd3+ increases, maximizing at about n = 0.09. Concentration quenching occurs when n is higher than 0.07.

Then we chose the best doping amounts of both Yb3+ and Nd3+; the concentration of the activator Cr3+ is also kept at 7%. Cr3+, Yb3+, Nd3+-tri-doped YAB was synthesized. Fig. 8(b) shows the NIR PL spectra of Y0.86Nd0.07Yb0.07Al2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4. The near-infrared emission originated from Yb3+: 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 and Nd3+: 4F9/2 → 4I11/2 transition can be clearly observed under the excitation of Cr3+: 4T1 and 4T2 energy levels (red line in Fig. 9(a)), which indicates that the energy transfer occurs from Cr3+ to Yb3+ and Nd3+. According to Fig. 9(a), the NIR PL bandwidth is explained by means of the tri-doped method.

Fig. 9(b) displays the photoluminescence decay curves of Cr3+ in YAl2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4, Y0.93Yb0.07Al2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4, Y0.93Nd0.07Al2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4 and Y0.86Nd0.07Yb0.07Al2.71Cr0.21(BO3)4 phosphors; on the basis of eqn (1) and decay curves, the lifetime values were determined to be 158.39, 76.94, 46.57 and 39.74 μs, respectively. The decrease of lifetime values indicates that energy transfer occurs in both Cr3+ to Yb3+ and Cr3+ to Nd3+. The energy level diagram of Cr3+, Yb3+ and Nd3+ ions in YAl3(BO3)4 is shown in Fig. 9(c).
In order to check the influence of the phosphors on the c-Si solar cell, we have built a solar cell device equipped with a luminescent solar concentrator. The schematic image of this device is shown in Fig. 10(a). The solar concentrator consists of a flat transparent slab covering luminescent down-shifting phosphors YAB:Cr3+,Yb3+. The luminescent material absorbs incoming solar light and re-emits it at a longer wavelength isotropically. The emitted light, trapped in the slab via total internal reflection, is then guided to solar cells placed next to the edge of the slab.33,34

The performances of c-Si Solar cells are characterized by the J–V curves under the condition of AM1.5 illumination, as shown in Fig. 10(a). After employing the down-shifting phosphor YAB:Cr3+,Yb3+, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is enhanced by 14.3%, compared to the reference c-Si solar cell before employing the phosphor. The short-circuit current density is proportional to the conversion efficiency from incident photons to electrical current. The reason for the enhanced short-circuit current density may be found in the EQE spectra. In Fig. 10(b), the red curve states that the bare commercial c-Si solar cell shows very poor spectral response in the blue region. While, after the down-shifting phosphor is employed, YAB:Cr3+,Yb3+ converts high energetic photons (<500 nm) into low energetic ones (namely around 1000 nm) which are transferred into the silicon solar cell. Consequently, according to the black curve in Fig. 10(b), the spectral response in the blue-green region is obviously enhanced. We have to admit that the spectral response in the red region decreases because some useful red photons for this commercial Si solar cell are also transformed by the YAB:Cr3+,Yb3+ phosphor. But, we believe that this problem may be solved by choosing an appropriate Si solar cell whose response spectrum matches better with the converting phosphors.
4. Conclusion
Broadband excitation and strong NIR emission Cr3+ spectral converters, Y1−nYbnAl2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4, Y1−mNdmAl2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4 and Y0.86Yb0.07 Nd0.07Al2.79Cr0.21(BO3)4, have been prepared. In all the above solid solution phase sensitizers Cr3+ ions occupy Al3+ sites in the YAl3(BO3)4 lattice. The absorption of YAl3(BO3)4:Cr3+ spans the spectral range of 370–750 nm. This enables broadband sensitization of Yb3+. Energy transfer occurs from Cr3+: 4T2 to Yb3+: 2F5/2. The occurrence of this energy process is evidenced by reduced red PL from Cr3+, reduced corresponding PL lifetime and reduced external quantum efficiency with increasing Yb3+ concentration, and identical PLE spectra for monitoring PL from Cr3+ and NIR PL from Yb3+. The Dexter's energy transfer formula of multipolar interaction and Reisfeld's approximation model applied for the analysis of the decay curves have indicated the dipole–dipole interaction mechanism as mainly responsible for the transfer. The replacement of Y3+ with Gd3+, Bi3+, and La3+ could result in the better emission intensities of Yb3+. Also the introduction of Nd3+ acquires wider PL emission bandwidth. As the Cr3+ has not only broadband absorption in the visible region but also high pump efficiency, the Cr3+–Yb3+/Nd3+ doped YABs are expected to be developed as spectral convertors for silicon solar cells to enhance the photovoltaic conversion efficiency.
