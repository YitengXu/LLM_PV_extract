    , Accepted 12th April 2018First published on 12th April 2018AbstractSuper-flexible bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide (TFSA)-doped graphene transparent conducting electrode (GR TCE)-based FAPbI3 − xBrx perovskite solar cells with 18.9% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for a rigid device and 18.3% for a flexible one are demonstrated because the TFSA-doped GR TCE reveals high conductivity and high transmittance. The unencapsulated TFSA-doped GR TCE-based cell maintained ∼95% of its initial PCE under a continuous light soaking of 1 Sun at 60 °C/30% relative humidity for 1000 h. In addition, the TFSA-doped GR TCE-based flexible perovskite solar cells show excellent bending stabilities, maintaining PCEs of ∼85, ∼75, and ∼35% of their original values after 5000 bending cycles, at R = 12, 8, and 4 mm, respectively.
In the past several decades, electronic devices have usually focused on higher speed, larger capacity, and smaller size, but these days, people are looking for more comfortable electronic devices that are flexible, foldable, or even wearable. To operate such electronic devices, flexible power generation systems should be developed. From this aspect, perovskite solar cells are a promising candidate for flexible power generators because their certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) is over 22% due to their unique properties such as a high absorption coefficient, long charge carrier diffusion length, and small exciton binding energy and it has sufficient flexibility.1
Currently, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been used as a transparent conducting electrode (TCE) in various optoelectronic devices due to its small sheet resistance and good transmittance in the visible region (10–50 Ω cm−2 at ∼90% transmittance).2 However, ITO TCEs are inherently brittle, so their applications in flexible, foldable, and wearable optoelectronic devices are limited. Accordingly, it is strongly required to develop flexible TCEs for super flexible perovskite solar cells. For flexible TCEs, carbon-based conductors (carbon nanotubes and graphene),3 conducting polymers,4 metal-based conductors (nanowires and grids),5 and oxide–metal–oxide (OMO) conductors6 have been studied to date. Among them, the graphene (GR) conductor is a promising candidate for super-flexible TCEs because it has high transparency, good conductivity, super flexibility, chemical stability, and convenient adjustment of the Fermi level by chemical doping.
Recently, Sung et al. fabricated 17.1% GR TCE/rigid glass substrate-based perovskite solar cells by reducing the sheet resistance of a pristine single-layer GR TCE to ∼500 Ω cm−2 with p-type MoO3 modification and 16.8% GR TCE/PEN (polyethylene naphthalate) flexible substrate-based perovskite solar cells.7 We (Im et al.) also reduced the sheet resistance of a single-layer GR TCE to ∼70 Ω cm−2 by p-type chemical doping with AuCl3 and attained 17.9% GR TCE/rigid glass substrate-based CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite solar cells.8 Very recently, we reported 17.9% GR TCE/PET (polyethylene terephthalate) flexible substrate-based CH(NH2)2PbI3 − xBrx (FAPbI3 − xBrx) perovskite solar cells composed of PET substrate/3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane adhesion layer/AuCl3-doped single-layer GR TCE/PEDOT:PSS (poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid))/FAPbI3 − xBrx/PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester)/Al.9 Although the work function and the sheet resistance of a single-layer GR TCE could be modified by chemical doping with AuCl3, the optical loss by the absorption of AuCl3 cannot be avoided.8,9 Unlike MoO3 or AuCl3 chemical doping, Tongay et al. reported that the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide[((CF3SO2)2NH)] (TFSA) doped GR exhibited low-resistance, high transparency, and long-term stability.10 Since then, the TFSA doped GR has been used in field-effect transistors.11
Here, we firstly used the TFSA doped GR as a p-type TCE for perovskite solar cells. We fabricated TFSA-doped GR TCEs on a rigid glass and a flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate as model TCEs. We systematically checked the optical and electrical properties of TFSA-doped GR TCEs with respect to the doping concentration of TFSA and measured the photovoltaic properties of TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cells. In addition, we checked the photo-stability of TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cells and the bending stability of TFSA-doped GR TCE-based flexible perovskite solar cells.

Fig. 1(a)–(d) are the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showing the effects of TFSA doping concentration (nD) on the surface topologies of TFSA-doped GR TCEs. The root-mean-square roughness (rms, Rq) of the pristine GR TCE (nD = 0 mM) was ∼0.332 nm, which is consistent with a previous report.12 As the nD increased from 0 to 30 mM, the Rq was gradually increased to 0.378, 0.405, and 0.421 nm for nD = 10, 20, and 30 mM, respectively. Unlike the particulate dopants, the TFSA-doped GR TCEs had a very smooth and even surface. To confirm the TFSA doping on GR TCEs, we measured the Raman spectrum of each sample as shown in Fig. 1(e). Two distinctive Raman peaks at ∼1580 and ∼2700 cm−1 are the representative G and 2D bands of GR TCEs.13 With increasing nD, both G and 2D bands were blue-shifted by phonon softening due to the charge transfer from the TFSA dopant to the GR TCE as reported in previous literature.10,14 The intensity ratio of G to 2D peaks (I(G/2D)), another parameter to estimate the doping strength, increases gradually with the doping concentration (nD) as listed in Table 1 because the doped material changes the lattice parameter and thereby changes the total charge number in the GR TCE.15 The I(G/2D) of the pristine GR TCE was 0.48, which indicates that the graphitic structure is single-layer GR.13 The TFSA-doping on the GR TCE was further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Fig. 1(f) because the TFSA-doped sample (nD = 20 mM) showed a clear N 1s peak in the XPS spectrum.

To check the electrical properties of TFSA-doped GR TCEs with the doping concentration (nD), we measured the work function and hole mobility of each sample by Kelvin probe force microscopy and the van der Pauw method as shown in Fig. 1(g). The work functions of TFSA-doped GR TCEs are monotonically decreased from −4.52 ± 0.047 eV to −4.92 ± 0.026 eV with nD as summarized in Table 1. This indicates that the TFSA-doped GR TCEs are p-type, consistent with previous reports.11,14
The nD-dependent mobility of GR TCEs was estimated from Hall measurements in a dark room. The pristine GR TCE (nD = 0 mM) exhibited a mobility of 2650 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the 30 mM TFSA-doped one exhibited a slightly reduced mobility of 1894 cm2 V−1 s−1. The transmission spectra of TFSA-doped GR TCEs with various nD in Fig. 1(e) indicate that the optical transmission loss is only ∼1% by TFSA chemical doping unlike conventional chemical dopants such as MoO3 and AuCl3. In the 550 nm-wavelength region, the transmittance of TFSA-doped GR TCEs was 97.18, 96.96, 96.80, and 96.48% for nD = 0, 10, 20, and 30 mM, respectively. The sheet resistance (Rs) of pristine GR TCEs was 650 ± 51 Ω cm−2 and it sharply decreased to 108 ± 45 Ω cm−2 as nD was increased to 30 mM. In addition, we checked the long-term stability of the TFSA-doped GR TCEs by measuring the Rs as a function of storage time in an air atmosphere as shown in Fig. 1(i). All TFSA-doped GR TCEs maintained their initial Rs values for 20 days.
To check whether the doped GR is suitable for a TCE, it is essential to analyze the sheet resistance (Rs)/transmittance (T). The ratio of DC conductivity/optical conductivity (σDC/σop) is generally used as a parameter to evaluate the performance of a TCE. It can be calculated from the equation (T = {1 + (Zo/2Rs) (σop/σDC)}−2).16 Higher values of σDC/σop indicate better TCE properties with high T and low Rs. The σDC/σop values of the TFSA-doped GR TCEs were over ∼35 and reached a maximum (∼100) at nD = 20 mM, much larger than the minimum industry standard (σDC/σop = 35) for transparent conducting oxide (TCO) replacement materials.16 In our previous report, we obtained a maximum σDC/σop value of ∼39 for AuCl3 doped GR TCEs.8 Therefore, the TFSA-doped GR TCEs will be a very promising TCE for perovskite solar cells.

Fig. 2(a) is a schematic illustration of an inverted (p–i–n type) FAPbI3 − xBrx perovskite solar cell comprised of glass or PDMS substrate/TFSA-doped GR TCE/PEDOT:PSS/FAPbI3 − xBrx/PCBM/Al. It should be noted that the device is fabricated by a low temperature (<150 °C) solution process except Al metal electrodes which are deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum. Therefore, this device architecture is suitable to fabricate the perovskite solar cells of the rigid glass-based and the flexible PDMS-based TFSA-doped GR TCEs. Fig. 2(b) is the energy band diagram of the corresponding FAPbI3 − xBrx perovskite solar cell. Upon illumination of light, free charge carriers or loosely-coupled electron–hole pairs are generated in the FAPbI3 − xBrx perovskite layer. The electrons and holes are then transferred/transported to the PCBM ETL (electron transporting layer) and PEDOT:PSS HTL (hole transporting layer), respectively due to proper band alignment. The electrons and holes are then moved to Al and TFSA-doped GR TCEs, respectively. Fig. 2(c) is a cross-sectional SEM (scanning electron microscopy) image of a representative inverted planar type FAPbI3 − xBrx perovskite solar cell consisting of ∼70 nm Al, ∼40 nm PCBM, ∼390 nm FAPbI3 − xBrx, and ∼30 nm PEDOT:PSS on a TFSA-doped GR TCE/glass substrate.

Fig. 3 shows the photovoltaic properties of inverted planar type FAPbI3 − xBrx perovskite solar cells constructed on GR-TCEs with different concentrations (nD) of TFSA dopants. Fig. 3(a)–(d) are the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cells. The photovoltaic properties of TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cells are summarized in Table 2. All photovoltaic parameters are gradually improved as the nD increases to 20 mM and are then saturated over 20 mM. This is well matched with the electrical properties (work function, mobility, sheet resistance, ratio of DC conductivity and optical conductivity) of TFSA-doped GR TCEs as shown in Fig. 1. The pristine (nD = 0 mM) GR TCE-based perovskite solar cell exhibited 1.01/1.02 V open-circuit voltage (Voc), 20.9/21.0 mA cm−2 short-circuit current density (Jsc), 60.6/64.6% fill factor (FF), and 12.8/13.8% power conversion efficiency (PCE) under the forward/reverse scan conditions. The 20 mM sample exhibited 1.07/1.07 Voc, 22.6/22.7 mA cm−2Jsc, 75.6/77.7% FF, and 18.3/18.9% PCE for the forward/reverse scan direction. The statistics of photovoltaic parameters of 20 samples of TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cells are shown in Fig. 3(e)–(h). The pristine sample exhibited 0.98 ± 0.028 V average (Avg.) Voc, 20.24 ± 0.513 mA cm−2 Avg. Jsc, 59.7 ± 1.88% Avg. FF, and 11.9 ± 0.86% Avg. PCE and the 20 mM sample exhibited 1.05 ± 0.016 V Avg. Voc, 22.15 ± 0.601 mA cm−2 Avg. Jsc, 75.0 ± 1.16% Avg. FF, and 17.4 ± 0.81% Avg. PCE. Therefore, the Voc, Jsc, and FF of the 20 mM sample were further improved to ∼7, 9.4, and 25.6%, thereby the PCE was improved to ∼46% compared to the pristine (nD = 0 mM) sample. The major contribution of performance improvement was attributed to the improved FF by 20 mM doped TFSA on GR TCEs due to the reduced sheet resistance and enhanced ratio of DC conductivity and optical conductivity.

To check the correct measurement of Jsc, the EQE (external quantum efficiency) spectra of each sample were recorded as shown in Fig. 3(i). The EQE is significantly enhanced by the doping of TFSA on the GR TCE in the nD = 10 mM sample compared to the pristine sample (nD = 0 mM). Apparently, the EQE values are evenly improved over a broad wavelength in a range from 300 to 850 nm. The EQE is a product of light harvesting efficiency (ηlhe), charge separation efficiency (ηcs), and charge collection efficiency (ηcc), so the improvement of EQE values by TFSA doping originated from the improved ηcs and/or ηcc because the absorption spectra were similar in all samples. The EQE spectra for nD ≥ 20 mM were saturated similar to the Jsc variations with the nD.
To understand why the TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cells have enhanced performance, we measured the diffusion coefficient (Dn) and charge carrier life time (τn) of each device by the analysis of intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) spectra, respectively. Fig. 3(j) and (k) indicate that by TFSA doping on GR TCEs, the charge carriers generated in FAPbI3 − xBrx perovskite solar cells are more effectively extracted out and the recombination between charge carriers within the device is also more reduced than the pristine GR TCE-based device. From the measured data of Dn and τn, we calculated the diffusion length (Ln = (Dn × τn)0.5) of TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cells at nD = 0, 10, 20, and 30 mM as listed in Table 2. The Ln of the pristine (nD = 0 mM) sample (∼215 nm) was greatly enhanced to ∼355 nm in the nD = 20 mM sample by the TFSA chemical doping on GR TCEs and was saturated at over nD = 20 mM. From the above results, we can conclude that the significantly enhanced device performance is attributed to the improved series resistance and shut resistance in the TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cells due to the efficient charge extraction and the reduced recombination of charge carriers. Fig. 3(l) shows that the hysteresis with respect to the scan direction of perovskite solar cells is reduced with the increase of nD because the ΔPCE (PCE of the revere scan condition − PCE of the forward scan condition) was reduced with nD. The J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction can be reduced by balancing the electron and hole flux.17 Accordingly, the reduced hysteresis might be attributed to the improved hole conductivity of the TFSA-doped GR TCE/PEDOT:PSS layer because the electron conductivity of PCBM/Al is relatively high.
To check if the stability of TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cells can be improved compared to the AuCl3-doped GR TCE-based one, we tracked the PCEs of unencapsulated devices with a continuous light soaking time of 1000 h in 60 °C/30% relative humidity under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination as shown in Fig. 3(m). The initial (t = 0 h) and final (t = 1000 h) device performance of TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cells and AuCl3-doped GR TCE-based ones are shown in Fig. 3(n) and (o), respectively. Initially, the TFSA-doped and AuCl3-doped GR TCE-based devices exhibited 1.07 V Voc, 22.6 mA cm−2Jsc, 77.6% FF, and 18.8% PCE and 1.08 V Voc, 21.2 mA cm−2Jsc, 76.9% FF, and 17.6% PCE, respectively. After a stability test for 1000 h, the TFSA-doped and AuCl3-doped GR TCE-based samples exhibited 5.3 and 13.1% PCE degradation compared to their initial PCEs. We also checked the stability of TFSA-doped and AuCl3-doped GR TCEs under the same conditions by tracking the sheet resistance with the light soaking time as shown in Fig. S1.† This indicates that the sheet resistance of AuCl3-doped GR TCEs is significantly increased after the stability test for 1000 h, whereas the sheet resistance of TFSA-doped GR TCEs is not. This confirms that the degradation of device performance is mainly attributed to the doping materials and the TFSA-doped GR TCE-based inverted planar type FAPbI3 − xBrx perovskite solar cells have excellent photo-stability.
Finally, we fabricated flexible perovskite solar cells by using TFSA-doped GR TCE/PDMS at nD = 20 mM. Fig. 4(a) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the flexible perovskite solar cells. The measured photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) are summarized in Table 3.

The flexible perovskite solar cell shows 1.07/1.07 V Voc, 21.7/21.7 mA cm−2Jsc, 75.1/77.0% FF, and 17.8/18.2% PCE under the forward/reverse scan conditions, respectively. Fig. S2† shows the box plots of 20 samples indicating that the Avg. Voc, Avg. Jsc, Avg. FF, and Avg. PCE is 1.05 ± 0.014 V, 21.45 ± 0.682 mA cm−2, 74.7 ± 1.31%, and 16.9 ± 0.96%, respectively. Fig. 4(b) is the EQE spectrum of the TFSA-doped GR TCE/PDMS-based FAPbI3 − xBrx inverted (p–i–n type) flexible perovskite solar cell indicating that the calculated Jsc values from the integration of the EQE spectrum is 21.91 mA cm−2. The high Jsc value could be achieved by minimizing the loss of light in the TFSA-doped GR TCE/PDMS substrate. To check the practical availability of the perovskite solar cell for a flexible power source, its operational stabilities against repeated bending tests at various curvature radii (R) were evaluated. The PCEs of the TFSA-doped GR TCE/PDMS-based perovskite solar cells after bending tests at R = ∞, 12, 8, 6, 4, and 2 mm are shown in Fig. 4(c). The PCEs exhibited slightly decreased values according to the bending radius. To further confirm the bending stability of flexible devices, we conducted up to 5000 bending tests as shown in Fig. 4(d). The PCEs of the flexible devices were maintained at ∼85% and ∼75% of the original values after 5000 repeated bending tests at R = 12 and 8 mm, respectively. On the other hand, the PCE was dramatically degraded to ∼35% of their original value at R = 4 mm (the change of photovoltaic parameters during 5000 bending tests and J–V curves of the initial and final cycles are shown in Fig. S3† and photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table S2†). Also, we checked the light stability of flexible devices before and after 5000 bending tests as shown in Fig. S4.† The flexible device with and without the bending test initially exhibited 1.07 V Voc, 21.6 mA cm−2Jsc, 75.6% FF, and 17.5% PCE and 1.04 V Voc, 20.5 mA cm−2Jsc, 70.5% FF, and 15.0% PCE, respectively. After the light stability test for 1000 h, the PCE of the flexible device with the bending test degraded more than that of the flexible device without the bending test. Further studies on the failure of the TCEs during bending were done by measuring the changes in the relative sheet resistance (ΔRs/Rs) of the TFSA-doped GR TCEs on PDMS substrates as functions of bending cycles for various R, as shown in Fig. 4(e). The initial sheet resistance of the TFSA-doped GR TCEs is 116 ± 42 Ω cm−2. Although the ΔRs/Rs was slightly higher than their initial values by ∼1.1 and 1.5 times after 5000 bending cycles at R = 12 and 8 mm, the ΔRs/Rs is dramatically increased to ∼1.4 times at R = 4 mm. These results are very much consistent with those of PCEs, as shown in Fig. 4. To improve the flexibility of the device, we fabricated the devices using APTES treated TFSA-doped GR TCEs as shown in Fig. S5.†9 The APTES treated TFSA-doped GR TCE-based device exhibited more improved flexibility than the TFSA-doped GR TCE without APTES treatment. These results suggest that graphene-TCE-based perovskite solar cells are promising as an effectively-flexible power source for advanced portable and wearable electronic/photonic appliances.
Conclusions
We successfully fabricated highly efficient TCO-free FAPbI3 − xBrx perovskite solar cells with excellent photo-stability by the introduction of TFSA-doped GR TCEs with high transmittance and low Rs. The Rs of TFSA-doped GR TCEs was greatly decreased from 650 ± 51 to 108 ± 45 Ω cm−2 when nD increased from 0 to 30 mM, but their transmittance was not significantly reduced. For the nD = 20 mM sample, the TFSA-doped GR TCE exhibited the optimized/saturated Rs = 116 ± 49 Ω cm−2 and transmittance = 96.80%, resulting in a maximum σDC/σop = 99 ± 7. As a result, the TFSA-doped GR TCE/glass-based inverted planar type rigid FAPbI3 − xBrx perovskite solar cells exhibited the highest PCE of 18.3% under forward scan and 18.9% under reverse scan conditions and an average PCE of 17.4 ± 0.81%. When the PCE of the unencapsulated rigid device was tracked with a continuous light soaking time of 1000 h in 60 °C/30% relative humidity under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination, the TFSA-doped GR TCE-based perovskite solar cell exhibited 5.3% degradation of PCE compared to its initial value, whereas the AuCl3-doped GR TCE-based one exhibited 13.1% degradation. Similarly, the TFSA-doped GR TCE/PDMS-based flexible solar cells exhibited the best PCE of 17.8% under forward scan and 18.2% under reverse scan conditions for the nD = 20 mM sample. PCEs of ∼85, ∼75, and ∼35% of the original values were maintained after 5000 bending cycles, at R = 12, 8, and 4 mm, respectively. In addition, to improve the flexibility of the device, we treated the APTES coupling agent with TFSI-doped graphene and fabricated flexible perovskite solar cells by using APTES treated TFSI-doped graphene TCEs. The APTES treated TFSA-doped GR TCE/PDMS-based flexible solar cells exhibited the best PCE of 18.0% under forward scan and 18.3% under reverse scan conditions. Although the PCE was similar to that before APTES treatment, flexibility was significantly improved compared to that before APTES treatment. APTES treated devices maintained PCEs of ∼89.5, ∼82.2, and ∼50.2% of their original values after 5000 bending cycles, at R = 12, 8, and 4 mm, respectively.
