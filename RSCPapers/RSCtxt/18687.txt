1 Introduction
Nanostructural titanium oxide-based materials (e.g., nanowires, nanotube or nanoporous structures) have received intense attention due to their unique chemical and physical properties.1 Such advanced nanostructures have been used on dye-sensitized solar cells,2 quantum-dot solar cells,3 photoelectrochemical water splitting,4 gas sensors5 and batteries.6 Compared to nanoparticles, one-dimensional nanorod/nanowire/nanotube arrays provide uninterrupted electrical pathways and promote the accessibility of openings to the electrolyte, thereby improving the electron transfer rate7 and efficiency in energy harvest systems. Numerous semiconductor materials in one-dimensional form have been investigated for energy conversion.8
TiO2 is the first semiconductor material identified for solar fuel conversion and remains one of the most important candidates because of its excellent chemical stability, photocorrosion resistance, and low cost.9 Before the reported hydrothermal synthesized TiO2 nanowire arrays in 2008,10,11 most one-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures were synthesized in the form of disoriented nanowires/nanotubes or oriented arrays on nontransparent or nonconductive substrates using various synthesis techniques. Disoriented nanowires/nanotubes were synthesized via hydrothermal treatment of TiO2 nanoparticles in NaOH solution,12 electrospun,13 biotemplating14 AAO (anodic alumina oxide)15 and ZnO nanorod template.16
TiO2 nanowire arrays on diverse substrates were also reported such as Ti foil treated in concentrated NaOH aqueous solution17 or annealed in oxygen flow18 or an argon stream with acetone.19 Oriented needle-like titanium dioxide (TiO2)20 and TiO2 nanorod arrays21 were grown on glass substrate with TiCl3 and NaCl aqueous solution. Short TiO2 nanorod arrays on transparent conductive substrates were synthesized via the hydrolysis of TiCl4 under the co-existence of amino acid catalysts.22 Some methods such as DC reactive magnetron sputtering,23 pulsed laser deposition (PLD),24 and CVD25 were also adopted to deposited TiO2 nanorods. Hierarchical TiO2 nanoarrays were synthesized by acid vapor oxidation of metallic Ti film.26 Another type of hierarchical TiO2 was reported by Chen,27 who grew TiO2 nanowires on electrospun titania fiber by hydrothermal treatment in Ti(OBu)4–HCl–H2O solution.
In 2008 high-quality, oriented single-crystalline TiO2 nanowires on substrates of transparent conducting (TCO) glass were reported by Feng10 and Liu11 via the hydrothermal method. Their techniques were then used by many groups to grow TiO2 nanowire/nanorod for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC),28 quantum dot29 and perovskite30 solar cells. Most reports use the same synthesis strategy without optimization. Tuning the nanorod structures such as nanorod thickness, length, and density are very good candidates for further improving efficiency. For example, hierarchical TiO2 with enhanced photovoltaic performance has been reported.31,32 Decreasing the diameter and increasing the length remain promising to further improve light harvesting and conversion performance of TiO2 nanowires/nanorods. The TiO2 nanorod reported by Liu11 possesses a relatively large diameter of 100 nm and short length. The diameter of TiO2 nanowires reported by Feng10 is thinner but compactly packed as nanowire bundles. Comparing these TiO2 nanorods, discrete nanorods with longer length and thinner diameter can provide better infiltration of both the light absorber and the hole transport material.
In this paper we report growth of well-aligned discrete nanowire arrays on FTO substrate with a modified method based on Feng's technique. The nanowire arrays can be grown up to 7 μm, while avoiding growth into compact bundles. The influence of different composition and growth mechanism is discussed. To demonstrate their application in solar water splitting, the TiO2 nanowires with different lengths were used as photoanodes. The knowledge gained from this work will enhance understanding of the growth mechanism and provide strategies to tailor the nanowire morphology. This study demonstrate synthesis of TiO2 nanowire arrays with a long length and thin diameter, which are promising for applications in photoelectrochemical water splitting, DSSC and quantum-dot solar cells.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of TiO2 nanowire arrays
Synthesis of the TiO2 nanowire arrays was performed by the hydrothermal method. In a typical procedure, an anatase TiO2 seed layer was initially deposited on FTO-coated glass (TEC 8, 8 Ω per square) by spin-coating using a solution prepared by dissolving 1.7 ml Ti butoxide and 0.2 g poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in 5 ml deionized water and 5 ml acetic acid, followed by 500 °C annealing for 2 h in air. The seed layer-coated substrate was then placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave (23 ml), containing 2 ml of titanium tetrachloride (1 M in toluene) and 8 ml of hydrochloric acid (37 wt%). The concentration of TiCl4 was further adjusted by adding TiCl4 (Sigma, 99%) to the precursor. The autoclave was then sealed and placed in an oven at 170 °C for 48 h. The substrate was then rinsed with ethanol and dried in a nitrogen stream. All the TiO2 nanowire arrays were annealed at 500 °C for 0.5 h in air.
2.2 Structural and photoelectrochemical characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a PANalytical X'pert MPD Pro X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα irradiation (wavelength 1.5406 Å) to determine the structure and phase of samples. The sample morphology was observed via a JEOL JSM-6700FE scanning electron microscope and a JEOL JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM). To prepare samples for TEM measurement, the nanorods were scratched off the substrate and dispersed in ethanol assisted by ultrasonication. A drop of the dispersion was put on a holey carbon film on a copper TEM grid and dried with an infrared lamp. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained using a Kratos Axis-Ultra DLD instrument with a monochromatized Al Kα line source (150 W). All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. Photoluminescence emission spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (QM-4, PTI). Linear sweep voltammetry and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were conducted using a two-electrode setup, platinum foil as the counter-electrode and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. A scanning potentiostat (CH Instruments, model CHI 600C) was used to measure photocurrents at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 and impedance spectra at 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl. The light source was a 150-W xenon lamp (Spectra Physics) with AM 1.5 filter (Oriel). The light intensity was set equivalent to global AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using an NREL-calibrated crystalline silicon solar cell. IPCE measurements were performed using a 300-W xenon lamp (Spectra Physics) integrated with a parabolic reflector, passing through an AM 1.5 filter and computer-controlled monochromator with an Oriel-calibrated silicon photodiode used for detection.
3 Results and discussion
Well-aligned TiO2 nanowires were grown vertically on FTO substrate by modified hydrothermal deposition based on Feng's report,10 as described in the experimental section. Instead of a densely packed nanowire array, discrete nanowire arrays were grown by adjusting the composition of the hydrothermal precursor. Fig. 1(a)–(d) shows the nanowire arrays grown with 0 ml, 0.22 ml, 0.44 ml and 0.66 ml TiCl4 (99 wt%) added, respectively. While the amount of TiCl4 toluene solution (1 M) added to the precursor, temperature and reaction time were kept as described in the experimental section. The left-sided insets are top views and enlarged images. It was found that the wire length could be well controlled by varying the amount of TiCl4 in the precursor. Nanowire lengths were measured at about 0.7 μm, 2.9 μm, 7.2 μm and 26 μm, respectively. As shown in the insets in Fig. 1(a)–(d), when the TiCl4 amount in the precursor increased, the diameters did not change much until 0.66 ml TiCl4 were added. For the samples without addition of TiCl4, the diameters ranged from 21 nm to 65 nm with the diameter of most wires at 42 nm. With the volume of TiCl4 precursor increased to 0.22 ml and 0.44 ml, the diameter increased slightly to values ranged from 23 nm to 101 nm. While with 0.66 ml TiCl4 added, wire diameters increased to values between 43 nm and 220 nm. In addition, a dense, packed nanorod layer (basal region, with thickness of 16 μm) was grown before growth of the discrete nanowires (top region, 10 μm) as shown in Fig. 1(d). To the best of our knowledge, the nanowire arrays as long as 7.2 μm and diameter less than 100 nm possessed the highest aspect ratio among the reported TiO2 wire arrays. The longest discrete TiO2 wire grown was 10 μm; additional increase in TiCl4 led to formation of undesired compact layer. Digital pictures of nanowires of different lengths are shown in Fig. S1.†

Upper insets show top view of samples and lower insets show enlarged images of the cross-section. Note: there is a base amount of TiCl4 added via 2 ml of TiCl4 toluene solution (1 M). 
To identify the structure of the as-grown array, XRD measurements were conducted in powder mode. Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of the TiO2 nanowire arrays grown with different amount of TiCl4 added to the precursor. With the exception of the reflection from the substrate (FTO, marked with asterisks), the characteristic peaks in XRD can be well indexed as rutile TiO2 (JCPDS: 004-0551). In addition, the intensity of (002) peaks increases significantly with respect to increasing film thickness, revealing a nanowire growth direction along [001].

More detail about microstructures of the as-prepared nanowires was obtained by TEM analysis, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The TEM analysis reveals that the as-synthesized nanowires had high aspect ratios with diameters from a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers. Fig. 3(b) shows the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of TiO2 nanowires. Lattice planes are distinctly visible. The lattice spacing of 3.23 Å can be readily assigned to the (110) crystal plane of rutile TiO2. The nanowire is confirmed to be a single crystalline with growth direction of [001]. XPS spectra of Ti 2p and O1s for the nanowire grown with 0.22 ml TiCl4 added are shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). A curve-fitting analysis was performed for the O1s spectra via the Levenberg–Marquardt curve-fitting method, assuming the superposition of two components' peaks (dashed lines), which can be assigned to the lattice oxygen (529.5 eV) and the surface-bridging oxygen (531.2 eV).33 The atom ratio between the surface-bridging oxygen and the lattice oxygen was calculated at 0.85. The high ratio of surface-bridging oxygen could be a result of the nanowire structure's high surface area.33 As shown in Fig. S2,† only Ti, O and C (for calibration) were found in the XPS survey scan, which indicated that impurity-free TiO2 nanowires were grown.

Photoluminescence emission spectra of TiO2 nanowires with different lengths were measured with 337 nm excitation wavelength at room temperature. As shown in Fig. S3,† emission bands at 425 nm, bands in the region of 300–430 nm and at 556 nm were observed for all four samples, which can be assigned to three kinds of physical origins: self-trapped excitons localized on TiO6 octahedra, oxygen vacancies and surface states, respectively.34,35 Oxygen vacancies and surface states existed in the nanowires. The 400 nm band for the samples with 0 ml and 0.22 ml TiCl4 added could be from FTO substrate due to their thin TiO2 layer. The intensities of the observed PL bands increased as the amount of TiCl4 added increased from 0 ml to 0.44 ml and then decreased at 0.66 ml. The first increase can be attributed to increase in nanowire array length and surface area, while for the sample of 0.66 ml, the decreased emission intensity can be ascribed to less surface area with increased diameter of the nanowire (see Fig. 1(d)).
To get a comprehensive understanding of photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 nanowires with a high aspect ratio and discrete bundle, current–voltage curves and IPCE measurements were performed for samples with different nanowire lengths under back illumination (from the substrate side) as shown in Fig. 4. The photocurrent increased with nanowire length until 7.2 μm, likely the result of electrons being generated close to the rear contact of the electrode where electron collection efficiency is high, and thus the longer nanowire length gave more photogenerated electrons to transport to the contact. But when the wire length reached 26 μm, with which a compact base was formed, the photocurrent decreased significantly. This can be interpreted as the compact base layer that significantly increased the hole transport path to the electrolyte as well as the electron transport path to the back contact. The base layer should then be avoided in an efficient photoelectrochemical application. IPCE dependence on wire length was similar for all four samples. For the sample possessing the longest wire at 7.2 μm without the compact layer, maximum IPCE values of 47% at 365 nm were observed under potential at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl.
 Fig. 4  (a) I–V photoelectrochemical response and (b) incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) for TiO2 nanowire arrays with different lengths. The IPCE measurements were performed under potential at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl. The electrolyte for both I–V and IPCE tests was 0.5 M Na2SO4. 
In order to illustrate the charge transport properties of the TiO2 nanowires, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the dark under a bias of 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl. Fig. S4† shows Nyquist plots of nanowires with different lengths. The larger curves for the longer wires in the plots are ascribed to greater charge-transfer resistance related to recombination of electrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.36 Moreover, the sample with 0.44 ml TiCl4 added had a much longer wire than that with 0.22 ml but exhibited a close charge-transfer resistance, which is in agreement with the highest photocurrent achieved in the sample with 0.44 ml TiCl4 added and possibly due to fewer grain boundaries and surface defects in the sample with 0.44 ml TiCl4 added.31
To achieve better growth control and greater understanding of the growth mechanism, diverse growth parameters in a strong acid medium to growing TiO2 nanowire/nanorod with various morphologies were investigated.
3.1 Effect of Ti source quantity
When using Feng's method,10 TiO2 thin nanowire with diameter of 10–35 nm and length up to 5 μm were grown in toluene medium with both Ti butoxide and TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) as Ti source. To prepare the precursor, 1 ml hydrochloric acid (37 wt%) and quantities of both Ti butoxide and TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) were added, and a corresponding amount of toluene was added to keep the total volume of precursor at 15 ml. It was found that the concentration of Ti source determined the thickness in a linear manner. We used the same volume for both Ti butoxide and TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) added and adjusted to 0.5 ml, 1 ml or 2 ml; TiO2 nanowire arrays with thickness of 1.4, 2.7 and 5.1 μm, respectively, were grown as shown in Fig. S5.† The basal regions of the nanowires grown by the method were found to bunch together, which may have prevented electrolyte penetration and dye molecule absorption for DSSC or quantum dot loading for quantum dot solar cells. That should be why, in Feng's research, the shortest nanowire exhibited the best performance for DSSC applications.10
As the concentration of the Ti source played an important role in wire growth, we further adjusted the amount ratio of Ti butoxide to TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) added while keeping the hydrochloric acid (37 wt%) unchanged and total volume at 15 ml by adding toluene. For rich TiCl4 precursor, with 4 ml of TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) and 1 ml of Ti butoxide added (1 ml hydrochloric acid (37 wt%) and quantities of toluene were added to keep the total volume of precursor at 15 ml), nanowire arrays with discrete wire tips was grown (Fig. S6(a)†). The tips of discrete TiO2 gathered together into a bunch; this apparent deformation was most probably introduced during air drying of the specimens.37 While using rich Ti butoxide precursor, with 4 ml of Ti butoxide and 1 ml of TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) added, a compact TiO2 layer instead of nanowire arrays was grown as shown in Fig. S6(b).†
It was believed that high concentrations of Ti source led to formation of dense-packed nanowire arrays. At the start of the reaction, Ti concentration was high in the precursor, and dense-packed nanowires were grown. As the reaction continued, the concentration of Ti dropped and discrete nanowires started to grow at the wire tips. Moreover, the Cl− ions contributed to the formation of discrete nanowires. That's why keeping Ti butoxide amount unchanged at 1 ml while adding 4 ml instead of 1 ml of TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) to the precursor, the tip region of the wires turned to discrete arrays (Fig. S6(a)†). Cl− was believed to be the structure director for TiO2 nanowire growth10,11 and can be selectively adsorbed onto the (110) crystal plane,38 suppressing further growth of this plane, and resulting in anisotropic growth in the [001] direction.
To further check the influence of the ratio of Ti butoxide to TiCl4 on the morphology of TiO2 nanorods, a controlled experiment was carried out by keeping the amount of TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) unchanged at 4 ml and decreasing the amount of Ti butoxide from 1 ml to 0.1 ml; results are illustrated in Fig. S7.† It was found that the thickness of dense-packed basal regions decreased while thickness of the discrete regions remained unchanged at approximately 600–800 nm.
3.2 Effect of growth medium
The growth medium was also important to the evolution of morphology. Nanowire can be grown in both toluene and HCl medium. When 2 ml TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) and 4 ml HCl (6 M) were added to 10 ml toluene, the toluene and the HCl aqueous solution separated and formed two layers as the two solutions are immiscible, that is, the lighter toluene in the upper layer and the heavier HCl aqueous solution in the lower layer. The TiCl4 is more soluble in HCl solution, so after ultrasonication the TiCl4 transferred from toluene to HCl solution and the upper layer turned from red to colorless. A substrate was vertically placed in the autoclave, with its upper part and lower part immersed in different media as shown in Fig. 5. After reaction at 170 °C for 4 h, nanowires with different morphologies were grown on these two different parts of the substrate. The nanowire grown in toluene was discrete nanowire with diameter of 40 nm and length of 700 nm, while the nanowire grown in HCl was also discrete nanowire with diameter of 100 nm and a longer length of 3600 nm.
 Fig. 5  Top and cross-section views, SEM images of TiO2 nanowires grown in toluene layer (a and b), and HCl aqueous solution layer (c and d). 
The reason why longer nanowires were grown in HCl aqueous solution is that Ti concentration was higher in this medium than that in toluene. When sonicating the mixture of 2 ml TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) and 4 ml HCl (6 M), the red-colored toluene turned colorless and HCl turned milky white because most of the Ti source transferred from toluene to the HCl solution.
When 37 wt% HCl (12 M) aqueous solution was the reaction medium and TiCl4 or Ti butoxide the Ti precursor, no hydrolysis occurred. But when the molarity of HCl solution was reduced to 6 M, TiO2 nanorod arrays could be grown directly in the FTO substrate; this is the case reported by Liu.11 When 2 ml TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) were added to 8 ml 37 wt% HCl (12 M) aqueous solution to be used as precursor, discrete nanowires were grown on the TiO2 seed layer coated substrate and the lengths increased with time. As shown in Fig. S8,† nanowires with lengths of about 100 nm, 930 nm and 2230 nm were grown for 24 h, 48 h and 36 h, respectively. It should be noted that no nanowire were grown on bare FTO substrate, which is different from cases in which HCl (6 M) or toluene10 was used as the precursor. We increased the concentration of TiCl4 by adding 0 ml, 0.22 ml, 0.44 ml or 0.66 ml pure TiCl4 (99%) instead of TiCl4 (1 M in toluene) and kept the volume of toluene at 2 ml, the length of deposited nanowire increased, This is the case discussed in the previous section and the optimal nanowire arrays 7.2 μm long were obtained with 0.44 ml TiCl4 (99%) added. It is interesting that without toluene, no TiO2 nanowires were grown in 37 wt% HCl. Thus, toluene should play an important role in TiCl4 hydrolysis in HCl with extremely low pH (to be discussed later). Note that with this highly concentrated HCl precursor, there was no precipitation in the autoclave, as only TiO2 nanowires grow on the substrate and the precursor can be reused for further growth of TiO2 nanowires. This method is highly efficient in Ti source usage and very suitable for industrial applications.
3.3 Growth mechanism
In rutile, TiO6 octahedrons linked with each other by sharing two edges along the c axis to construct chains, and then the chains were connected with corner-shared bonding.39 The anatase TiO2 framework was constructed by sharing four edges of the TiO6 octahedron (or face-shared connection). There were more edge-shared bondings in the anatase structure than in the rutile structure (Fig. 6). To form edge-shared bonds in the anatase structure, more dehydration reactions between titania complexes must occur simultaneously, which is less likely in highly acidic concentrations. Thus, highly acidic solutions appear to be preferable for synthesizing rutile and basic solutions for the anatase phase.40

According to Nicholls,41 the titanium(IV) ion was kept in solution as anionic complexes of type [Ti(OH)Cl5]2− and/or [TiCl6]2− in HCl aqueous solution where Cl− coordinated to the titanium. It was been asserted39,42 that the Ti(IV) complex ion has the formula [Ti(OH)nClm]2− (H2O could be a ligand too), where n + m = 6, and n and m are determined by the acidity and concentration of Cl− ion in the feedstock. Even though the ligand field strength of OH group is larger than that of the Cl− ion, a higher acidity or [Cl−] will give a bigger m. The linking between [TiO6] units during the TiO2 nanowire growth is carried out via dehydration reactions (i.e., oxolation) between OH ligands in [Ti(OH)nClm]2− complex ions. When acidity in the feedstock is higher, the number of OH ligands in [Ti(OH)nClm]2− is smaller and the growth of TiO2 nanowires is suppressed. In concentrated HCl (37 wt%, 12 M), the Ti(IV) complex is in the form of [TiCl6]2−, which is not favorable for TiO2 growth, as Cl− retards linking of [TiO6] units. When decreasing acidity, OH− concentration increased and [Ti(OH)nClm]2−(n > 0) was formed. Growth of TiO2 became favorable by dehydration of OH ligands in the [Ti(OH)nClm]2− complex. As mentioned above, toluene plays an important role in TiCl4 hydrolysis in HCl with extremely low pH. With the addition of toluene, hydrolysis of TiCl4 became possible in 37 wt% HCl (12 M) and TiO2 wires were grown on the seed layer-coated substrate. This can be explained as follows: arenes, such as C6(CH3)6 can react with Ti(IV) ions to produce piano-stool complexes [Ti(C6Me6)Cl3]+.43 Similar behavior was observed in the case of toluene—in extremely low-pH HCl, [TiCl6]2−— can react with toluene to form the complex [Ti(C6H5CH3)Cl5]−: 
(1)
Replacement of the Cl ion with C6H5CH3 may further transform to [Ti(OH)nClm]2− and as a result promote linking of [TiO6] units, making the growth of TiO2 become possible in highly concentrated HCl solution.
4 Conclusions
In summary, discrete vertically aligned TiO2 nanowire arrays as long as 7.2 μm and less than 100 nm diameter were successfully synthesized on FTO substrate via hydrothermal deposition. The TiO2 nanowires with different lengths were used as photoanodes to investigate their photoelectrochemical properties. Nanowire arrays 7.2 μm long that were synthesized in concentrated HCl (37 wt%) aqueous solution showed the best performance. The influence of hydrothermal precursor composition on morphologies of the grown wires was investigated in detail. Concentrated HCl was found to be essential for growth of long discrete nanowire arrays. Hydrothermal growth of TiO2 in concentrated HCl became possible with toluene in the precursor and seed layer on the substrate. Results provide an optimal structure for energy-harvesting applications as well as insights into growth mechanisms of high-aspect ratio TiO2 nanowires in concentrated HCl aqueous solution.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  SEM images of TiO2 nanowires grown on FTO substrate with different amounts of TiCl4 added: (a) 0 ml, (b) 0.22 ml, (c) 0.44 ml, (d) 0.66 ml. Upper insets show top view of samples and lower insets show enlarged images of the cross-section. Note: there is a base amount of TiCl4 added via 2 ml of TiCl4 toluene solution (1 M).	 

 	Fig. 2  XRD patterns of TiO2 nanowires grown on FTO substrate with different amounts of TiCl4 added: 0 ml, 0.22 ml, 0.44 ml, and 0.66 ml. Peaks marked with asterisks (*) are FTO peaks.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) SEM and (b) high-resolution TEM image and XPS spectra of (c) Ti 2p and (d) O1s for the TiO2 nanowire grown with 0.22 ml TiCl4 added.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) I–V photoelectrochemical response and (b) incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) for TiO2 nanowire arrays with different lengths. The IPCE measurements were performed under potential at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl. The electrolyte for both I–V and IPCE tests was 0.5 M Na2SO4.	 

 	Fig. 5  Top and cross-section views, SEM images of TiO2 nanowires grown in toluene layer (a and b), and HCl aqueous solution layer (c and d).	 

 	Fig. 6  Crystal structures of (a) rutile and (b) anatase TiO2. Bond edges (marked with black line) represent edge-shared bonding, the number of which is larger in the anatase structure than in the rutile structure.
