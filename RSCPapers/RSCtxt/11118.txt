We report on a synthetic way to increase the dielectric constant of fullerene derivatives. It is demonstrated that introducing triethylene glycol monoethyl ether (teg) side chains into fulleropyrrolidines increases the dielectric constant by ∼46 percent without devaluation of optical properties, electron mobility and the energy level of the compound.
The dielectric properties of molecular materials are crucial to a host of important phenomena, including enzyme function,1 electron transfer,2,3 chemical sensors4,5 and a variety of electronic applications6,7 such as in self-assembled nanoscale dielectric materials for gating thin-film transistors8–10 as well as in thin interfacial extraction/blocking layers for organic light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells.11–15 Yet, there are no common synthetic tools for tuning dielectric properties as there are, for example, for tuning band gaps, hydrophobicity, etc.
The dielectric constant, εr, expresses the quantity of electrical energy that can be stored in a material under an applied electric field and can be translated to the ability of a material to polarize in response to an applied field. Ceramics are traditionally known to be materials with high dielectric constants, however, their limitations such as fragility, heaviness and low breakdown strength have drawn attention towards their organic counterparts, which are more flexible with better large-scale processability. Thus, efforts have been made to increase the εr of organic materials by blending inorganic, conductive fillers or electron-rich organic dopants16,17 with polymers. However, this approach results in a high dielectric loss, and reduces breakdown field strength and glass transition temperature. Attempts have been made to increase εr by introducing cyano18 groups into polyimides, which increased εr from 3.16 to 3.73. Recently, a polyacrylate was reported in which polar terthiophene groups, via the formation of nano-crystalline domains, dramatically increased εr across a wide range of frequencies.19 If generalizable, this strategy could prove effective for non-conjugated polymers. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with the general strategy of installing polar pendant groups, a generalizable route to prepare high dielectric constant π-conjugated organic materials has proven to be elusive; e.g., what constitutes a polarizable pendant group and how strongly does it influence the properties of a conjugated material? Little focus has been devoted to improving dielectric constants of conjugated organic materials; there are only a few examples of εr greater than 3–4 for these materials. A poly(p-phenylenevinylene) derivative bearing polar oligoethylene oxide side-chains (PEO-PPV) gave εr = 4–5.520 and fluorine atoms have been used to increase εr from 4.2 to 5.5.21 We are particularly interested in conjugated organic materials with high values of εr for applications in organic photovoltaics (OPV). In a recent theoretical study, we showed that increasing εr reduces the exciton binding energy and recombination losses, making solar cells with power conversion efficiencies above 20% feasible.22
Although much research focuses on modifying the electronic, optical and solubility properties of fullerenes, increasing εr without sacrificing these properties is an important challenge in organic solar cells that has not yet been solved. This communication describes the improvement of the dielectric constant of fullerene derivatives by introducing polarizable side groups. We show that fulleropyrrolidines PTEG-1 and PTEG-2 (Fig. 1) with triethylene glycol monoethyl ether (TEG) side chains exhibit a considerable increase in εr and excellent solubility in organic solvents without any significant changes in electron mobility, UV-vis absorption, and electrochemical properties.

Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is the most widely used fullerene acceptor in OPV devices, but fullerenes in general are widely utilized as acceptors. Fulleropyrrolidines are easily prepared via the Prato method,23 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an azomethineylide, generated in situ from the corresponding aldehyde and N-methylglycine. This methodology has proven to be a powerful procedure for the functionalization of C60 due to its versatility and the ready availability of the starting materials, while synthesis of methano[60]fullerenes has some limitations in terms of molecular design and the method. For instance the preparation of ylides and, in particular, diazo compounds can be difficult.
The synthetic route to prepare PTEG-1, PTEG-2 and PP is shown in Scheme S1 and details of materials synthesis are given in the ESI.† For comparison, PP without TEG chains is also prepared (Fig. 1).
The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by analytical and spectroscopic data. The 1H NMR spectra of PTEG-1 and PTEG-2, recorded in CDCl3, exhibit the expected signals of a TEG moiety and the characteristic peaks of the pyrrolidine ring as two doublets (AB quartet) and one singlet as well as a singlet for the N-CH3 group. In fulleropyrrolidines the signals of the ortho-hydrogen atoms of the phenyl group directly attached to the pyrrolidine ring appear as a broad singlet at room temperature due to restricted rotation of the phenyl group.
A notable feature of the fulleropyrrolidine PTEG-1 is its improved solubility compared to PCBM in a wide range of organic solvents such as o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), PhCl, CHCl3, PhCH3, and THF. For example, PCBM is reasonably soluble in CHCl3 (∼25 mg ml−1), ODCB (∼30 mg ml−1) and PhCH3 (10 mg ml−1), but much less soluble in THF, while PTEG-1 is easily dissolved in ODCB (∼65 mg ml−1), CHCl3 (∼45 mg ml−1), PhCH3 (∼36 mg ml−1) and THF (∼15 mg ml−1). The enhancement of solubility is not only an important property for the fabrication of electronic devices, but also opens up the possibility of using sustainable and/or less harmful solvents. PTEG-2, with two TEG chains, shows even better solubility in organic solvents.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of compounds PTEG-1 and PTEG-2, together with that of reference compound PP, in 10−5 M CHCl3 are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† C60 derivatives generally display strong absorption in the UV region and broad, weak absorption in the visible region. The absorption of PTEG-1 and PTEG-2 is almost the same as PP, especially the characteristic peak of the fullerene moiety at 430 and 704 nm. This similarity indicates that TEG chains do not have any significant effect on the fulleropyrrolidine chromophore, in solution.
The electrochemistry of fullerenes is one of the most important properties as conjugated materials. Therefore, we investigated the electrochemical properties of PTEG-1 and PTEG-2 by cyclic voltammetry. We also studied PP and PCBM for comparison (ESI,† Fig. S2). The measured half-wave potentials of the reduction processes of all compounds are listed in Table 1. The first reduction potential, which approximates the LUMO energy level of these compounds, is almost the same for PTEG-1, PTEG-2, and the controls, PP and PCBM. This similarity implies that TEG chains do not affect the LUMO energy of fullerene derivatives (because they do not shift the reduction potentials). In addition, there is no significant change in the potential of the second reduction.

It is well known that, as polarizability increases, the dielectric constant increases, and the more available polarization mechanisms a material possesses, the larger the dielectric constant. We expected the addition of TEG chain(s) to fullerenes to increase the relative permittivity of the fullerene compound by increasing the mechanisms of polarization via the reorientation of the dipole moments of the ethers in TEG.
We investigated the dielectric properties of the fullerene derivatives presented in this paper by spectral impedance measurements. The average values obtained for the dielectric constant of PTEG-1, PTEG-2, PP and PCBM, upon equivalent circuit (ESI,† Fig. S4) fitting over the frequency range of 100 Hz–1 MHz, are shown in Table 1. Interestingly, the dielectric constant of both PTEG-1 and PTEG-2 increased significantly to 5.7 and 5.3, respectively, in comparison to PCBM (εr ∼ 3.9) and PP (εr ∼ 3.6). The determined dielectric constant for all three compounds is constant from 100 to 106 Hz (Fig. 2). The enhancement of the dielectric properties clearly shows the influence of the increased polarizability afforded by TEG side chains. The measured dielectric constants of PTEG-1 and PTEG-2 differ only by the sum of their standard deviations. This observation is counterintuitive, because one might expect that two TEG moieties per molecule would have a greater influence than one. We therefore tentatively conclude that the measured permittivity results from a complex interplay between the fullerene cages and their substituents and is not simply a result of increasing the volume fraction of glycol units in the film. This situation is quite different from that of the addition of macroscopic high-k fillers.

Having already determined that the optical HOMO/LUMO gap and the absolute position of these orbitals (from reduction potentials) are unaffected by the inclusion of TEG chains, we investigated the electron mobility of films of the fullerene derivatives by measuring the current–voltage characteristics of electron-only devices with the following architecture at room temperature: Au/fullerene derivative/LiF/Al. The experimental J–V curves show that current density quadratically depends on the voltage, which is a characteristic behavior of space-charge limited current (SCLC).24 The J–V curves of PTEG-1 and PTEG-2 are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) corrected for the built-in voltage of Vbi = 0.5 V and 0.05 V, respectively.
We found similar values for the electron mobility of the fullerenes with single and double TEG side chains (PTEG-1 and PTEG-2), PCBM of ∼2 × 10−7 m2 V−1 s−1 (Table 1). Thus, in addition to the electro-optical properties of the molecules being unaffected by inclusion of TEG chains, their bulk electron mobility did not change with respect to that of the benchmark fullerene derivative, PCBM.
In conclusion, we synthesized fullerene derivatives with dielectric constants significantly higher than C60 and PCBM, without negatively impacting molecular properties (optical absorption and reduction potentials) as well as bulk properties (electron mobility). Our strategy of increasing polarizability by including TEG chains also improved the solubility compared to PCBM in a wide range of organic solvents. This work is one of the first efforts unambiguously demonstrating a synthetic route for the orthogonal tuning of the dielectric constant (a bulk property) of a conjugated organic material. This orthogonality is critical to the tailoring of high-dielectric-constant materials because it precludes the need to balance the negative impacts of simpler strategies such as the inclusion of additives and the re-optimization of each combination of a material/additive. While there are scattered reports of small increases in the dielectric constant of conjugated polymers through the inclusion of polar pendant groups, the strategy presented in this paper opens up new opportunities to improve the power conversion efficiencies of heterojunction OPV devices without perturbing HOMO/LUMO energies or the electron mobility of fullerene acceptors. Ultimately this strategy of synthetically manipulating the dielectric properties of materials may lead to single-component, non-excitonic OPV devices.
