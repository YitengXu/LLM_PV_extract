    , Accepted 6th December 2019First published on 7th December 2019AbstractIn the past ten years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved tremendous success, with the efficiency rivalling that of conventional silicon-based devices. To promote commercialization, lowering the production cost and reducing the complexity of the process would make the devices more competitive and thus are highly required.

1. Introduction
Recently, hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite (HOIHP) materials (ABX3, A = MA+, FA+, Cs+; B = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−) have been extensively studied in photovoltaic devices owing to their excellent absorption coefficient,1 tunable direct band-gap,2 low exciton binding energies,3 high carrier mobility,4 long charge diffusion length,5,6 ambipolar charge transport,7 and so on. It is particularly noteworthy that solar cells based on HOIHP materials have undergone rapid development by leaps and bounds, from an initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% to 25.2% within only ten years,8,9 which is almost on a par with that of silicon-based solar cells.10 Generally, the hole transport materials (HTMs) in high-performance PSCs, such as 2,2,7,7-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and poly-triarylamine (PTAA), need additives (4-tert-butyl pyridine and lithium salts) to enhance their conductivity and/or improve their contact with perovskite.11 However, 4-tert-butyl pyridine can corrode perovskite and lead to decomposition of PSCs.12 Lithium salt is very sensitive to water which thus results in reduction of the device performance in humid environments.13 Besides, these organic HTMs are very expensive and not stable enough under long-term illumination. In this respect, HTL-free PSCs have been developed.14–16 On the one hand, HTL-free devices can greatly save the cost of materials. On the other hand, devices based on HTL-free configurations can reduce the complexity of processing because fewer layers are used.
The first HTL-free normal PSC with the configuration of FTO/compact-TiO2/TiO2 sheets/MAPbI3/Au was assembled by Etgar et al.,17 in which a gold anode was placed in direct contact with the perovskite layer and the PCE was as high as 5.5%. It was found that the gold could diffuse into the perovskite layer and degrade the device. Subsequently, the more stable carbon electrode was mostly employed. Han et al. constructed devices with the structure of FTO/dense-TiO2/meso-TiO2/ZrO2/carbon + MAPbI3, substituting the Au counter electrode with carbon, which is inexpensive, stable, hydrophobic, and inert to ion migration.18 Yang et al. introduced candle soot to make devices of FTO/compact-TiO2/meso-TiO2/MAPbI3/candle soot, and the PCE reached 11.2%.19 Meng et al. reported all-carbon counter electrode based HTL-free PSCs, with mesoscopic carbon enabling good contact with perovskite and flexible graphite as the conductive electrode.20 Though much effort has been made for the development of HTL-free normal PSCs with carbon as the anode, the open circuit voltage (Voc) is still a bottleneck and the PCEs are normally lower than 15%, which may result from the bad contact and/or the mis-matched energy levels between perovskite and the electrode. Besides, the commonly used TiO2 in these devices is always obtained by high-temperature (∼500 °C) sintering, which requires high energy consumption and thus increases the production cost and complexity. Therefore, the development of highly efficient, easy-fabrication and low-temperature-processed HTL-free PSCs is much more desirable.
In comparison with traditional metal electrodes, ITO or FTO transparent electrodes are metal oxides and they are stable enough to directly come into contact with the perovskite layer. Therefore, the inverted HTL-free solar cell construction is proposed to be more reasonable to enhance the stability of the PSCs. The first inverted HTL-free PSC was reported by Pang et al., with a device configuration of ITO/MAPbI3/C60/Ag and a PCE of 5.4%.21 Since then, HTL-free devices with inverted structures have attracted extensive attention and much progress has been made during the past few years as summarized in Table 1. On the whole, along with the improvement of film-making technology, the modification of the interface contact and the reduction of defect concentration of the perovskite film, the performance of the device is gradually improved. To date, including the as-reported patents,36,37 the highest PCE based on this kind of device has surpassed 20%,32 exhibiting its great application potential. In this mini-review, we first describe the working mechanism of HTL-free inverted PSCs and then summarize the development and progress in recent years. Finally, open questions on HTL-free inverted PSCs are raised, and the perspective on future research directions is also provided, which need to be focused on at this stage.

2. Working mechanism and interfacial properties
The working mechanism for a normal PSC is that after the perovskite layer absorbs incident light, electrons and holes are generated and extracted by the electron transport material (ETM) and HTM. Then, electrons flow through the external circuit to combine with the holes, generating a photo-induced photocurrent. The structure of an inverted HTL-free PSC is illustrated in Fig. 1a, where the perovskite layer is directly fabricated on top of the front electrode. The device is completed following fabrication of the ETM and rear electrode. The only difference from the normal PSCs is that the holes are extracted at the interface between perovskite and the transparent anode. Therefore, for inverted HTL-free PSCs, the holes move directly into the anode after being extracted from perovskite as shown in Fig. 1b. One key point is that the interfacial energetics and dynamics between perovskite and the anode should not be neglected. In fact, many issues of PSCs can be generalized as interface problems including electronic charge generation, extraction, injection and recombination.
 Fig. 1  (a) Configuration of HTM-free inverted PSCs. (b) The transport of carriers within devices. 
In a PSC, the density (n) of photogenerated free-charge carriers can be expressed as:38,39  where κ1, κ2, and κ3 are the rate constants of monomolecular (defect-mediated), bimolecular (band to band or interfacial), and Auger(-like) recombination, respectively. For a high-quality perovskite film, the defect-mediated recombination within the perovskite film can be negligible. In addition, the rate constant for Auger(-like) recombination at 1 sun is negligible due to the relatively wide bandgap of the perovskite material. Therefore, the dominant recombination within a PSC is interfacial recombination, which mainly results from surface defects of the different contact layers, the poor physical contact between different layers, unbalanced carrier transport within perovskite films and the energy difference between perovskite and selective contacts.40–43 Interfacial recombination as a primary restriction factor in HTL-free inverted PSCs should be paid more attention, especially at the interface between perovskite and the anode. There exists a large energy barrier (ΔEh) for hole injection from the perovskite layer to the anode (ITO) for inverted HTL-free PSCs. This ΔEh value depends on the valence band maximum (VBM) of perovskite and the Fermi-level of the anode.44 To decrease and/or eliminate the ΔEh is extremely important for the inverted HTL-free PSCs.
3. The progress of inverted HTL-free PSCs
For inverted HTL-free devices, the coverage of the uniform perovskite films is particularly important because any pinhole in a perovskite film will cause short circuit.45 It is known that recombination centers are easily formed at grain boundaries, which would lead to charge traps and thus is bad for device performance.46,47 Large perovskite grains could reduce the number of grain boundaries. Additionally, large grains may have high crystallinity, which can help in charge transport.48 Interfacial charge injection has a key influence on the device performance, especially at the interface of perovskite and ITO. Improving the energy alignment of adjacent layers is an efficient approach to reduce ΔEh, such as lowering the Fermi level of ITO and/or promoting the VBM of perovskite.44 Molecular doping is an efficient way to improve the electrical properties of semiconductors.49 It is expected that doping in perovskite would improve charge transport, enhance conductivity, obtain helpful interfacial band bending and so on. We can see more intuitively the performance evolution of inverted HTL-free devices in Fig. 2, which is based on data from Table 1. As Fig. 2 shows, the PCE was only around 5% when the first report was published in 2014, and the PCE increased to 16% in 2015. In 2017, the device performance improved to over 20%, and since then this level has been basically maintained. In the following, we generalized three aspects to expatiate on the development of inverted HTL-free PSCs, including fabrication of high-quality perovskite films, surface modification of ITO and adjustment of the molecular layer as shown in the inset of Fig. 2.

3.1 Fabrication of high-quality perovskite films
In the early stage of PSC development, a variety of film-fabrication techniques were developed to obtain full-coverage perovskite films to improve device performance.50–58 In the first report on inverted HTM-free PSCs,21 Pang et al. used the sequential-vapor-deposition approach to grow a highly uniform full coverage of MAPbI3 film directly on bare ITO. The schematic of the fabrication process is shown in Fig. 3a–d. A PbI2 film is evaporated onto the ITO surface, followed by MAI which is directly evaporated onto the PbI2 film. The MAI film reacts in situ with the PbI2 film to yield an MAPbI3 film. Fig. 3e–h show the evolution of perovskite films at different stages. Full-coverage of the perovskite film is obtained after further annealing of the as-prepared PbI2/MAI layers at 100 °C for 30 min to remove the excess MAI as shown in Fig. 3h, yielding a PCE of 5.4%.

The smaller roughness of the ITO surface makes the deposition of highly uniform perovskite films more difficult. It is confirmed that the underlying nanoparticles can act as nucleation sites of perovskite crystal nuclei and thus help to obtain a high-quality light absorber layer.59 Graphene oxide sheets (GOSs) were introduced between ITO and MAPbI3 thin films in HTM-free inverted PSCs.30 Due to their extremely low concentration, sporadic covering of the ITO, and high resistance, GOSs can act as the nucleation sites to mediate MAPbI3 crystal growth. Fig. 4a–d show SEM images of MAPbI3 thin films deposited on different substrates. There is no full-coverage and therefore some pin-holes are present in the MAPbI3 film obtained on bare ITO. However, the as-prepared MAPbI3 films on GOSs show compact and full-coverage morphology. In addition, the grain size of perovskite films on GOSs is larger. In consequence, the highest PCE of the device with the perovskite film on GOSs is 6.62% compared to the 4.78% of the reference device.

Xu et al. introduced Cu2O particles by the electro-deposition method onto bare ITO.27 They claimed that instead of a Cu2O film, Cu2O particles are formed on ITO, which shows that Cu2O is not the HTM in the device. A two-step sequential deposition technique was used to grow perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 4e–h, MAPbI3 thin films deposited on different substrates all exhibited uniform and full-coverage morphology. The grain size dramatically increased for the perovskite films deposited on Cu2O particles compared to that on bare ITO. The increased grain size leads to fewer grain boundaries within perovskite films, which is expected to result in high-performance PSCs.60–62 The inverted HTL-free PSCs based on MAPbI3 thin films deposited on Cu2O particles showed a higher PCE (9.64%) than those on bare ITO with a PCE lower than 1%.
Chang et al. took advantage of the ultra-high purity component (PbI2) to fabricate high-quality large MAPbI3 grains.33 High-purity PbI2 can enhance the precursor solubility, which is suitable for fabricating high-concentration solutions. They compared different quality PbI2 for the growth of perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 4i and j,63 both MAPbI3 films exhibited uniform and compact morphology. However, the grain size of the perovskite film based on high-purity PbI2 is larger than that of the perovskite film based on the low-purity one. The high-quality perovskite film also shows better crystallinity, which is confirmed by the XRD measurements shown in Fig. 4k. The HTL-free inverted PSC based on the high crystallinity perovskite film shows a high PCE of 13.5%.
3.2 Surface modification of ITO
As mentioned earlier, the ΔEh between perovskite (MAPbI3) and the anode (ITO) is around 0.7 eV, which is a huge loss for hole collection of ITO. Bian et al. used UV-Ozone to modify bare ITO to improve its work function (WF) and simultaneously remove the organic residue, which can help to obtain a high-quality perovskite layer.25 They claimed that the WF improved from 4.8 to 5.2 eV after UV-Ozone treatment. As a result, the optimized HTM-free inverted device shows a higher Voc of 0.96 V compared to the reference device of 0.92 V and corresponding PCEs of 15.2% and 11.7%, respectively.
Using organic monomolecular layer (ML) materials to improve the WF of ITO is another efficient method which has been widely exploited in organic electronics.64–66 Cheng et al. introduced 4,4′-cyclohexylidenebis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)benzenamine] (TAPC) as an organic ML to effectively modify ITO and improve its WF due to an interface dipole resulting from Sn–N bonds.34 As shown in Fig. 5a, a dipole layer is formed through Sn–N bonds, accompanied by band bending. Fig. 5b shows the change of WF of ITO resulting from the interface dipole, which originates from the interaction of ITO and the TAPC ML via Sn–N bonds. Fig. 5c and d exhibit downward energy band bending at the interface of ITO and the perovskite film. However, upward energy band bending is created between perovskite and the ML-ITO interface as shown in Fig. 5e and f, where ΔEh is observed to decrease from 1.08 to 0.05 eV and the electron transport barrier (ΔEe) increases from 0.52 to 1.55 eV. Both ΔEh and ΔEe at the interface of ML-ITO and perovskite can benefit the collection of holes for ITO and reduction of charge recombination and thus lead to higher device performance. Compared to the PCE of 10.26% for the reference device, the optimal HTM-free inverted PSC based on ML-ITO shows a PCE of 19.42%.

3.3 Adjustment of the molecular layer
It is well known that defects within perovskite films have a controlling influence on the performance of PSCs.67,68 Reducing and/or eliminating defects are attracting more and more research attention. Bian et al. introduced Cu(thiourea)I [Cu(Tu)I] and CuI into perovskite layers to effectively passivate the trap states via interacting with the under-coordinated Pb2+ and I− at the grain boundaries and surface of perovskite crystals.31 They also proposed the trap state passivation mechanism as shown in Fig. 6a. CuI and Cu(Tu)I were chosen as passivators to passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ and I− ions at the grain boundaries and surface of perovskite crystals. They claimed that the passivation would reduce the depth of potential wells resulting from the difference of the trap state energy level and valence band maximum (VBM) of perovskite and thus reduce the charge trapping, accumulation, and recombination. Due to the low VBM of Cu(Tu)I (−5.45 eV) compared to CuI (−5.21 eV), Cu(Tu)I exhibited better results than CuI. In addition, Cu(Tu)I doping can form a p–n heterojunction with perovskite, which greatly improves hole transport and reduces charge recombination. The optimized HTM-free inverted device with Cu(Tu)I doping shows a PCE of 19.9% due to the synergistic effects of passivation and the construction of a p–n heterojunction. In addition, Bian's group reported that CuSCN doping in the perovskite layer could also form a p–n heterojunction, while also increasing the hole mobility and decreasing the electron mobility of perovskite films as illustrated in Fig. 6b and c.29 As a result, the introduction of CuSCN could benefit hole transport to ITO, reduce charge recombination and thus improve the device performance.

Reproduced from ref. 35 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
The optimal HTL-free inverted PSC with CuSCN doping shows a PCE of 18.1% compared to the reference device exhibiting 8.7%.
A p-type organic small molecule semiconductor, fluorinated tetraarylbenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dipyrrol-1,5-yl-alkanediylbissulfonate (BDPSO), was reported to passivate unsaturated Pb2+ in the MAPbI3 film by coordination of the ionic side chains.35 Nakamura et al. reported that after doping BDPSO, the density of defects in the MAPbI3 film was calculated to decrease by one order of magnitude from 3.21 × 1016 cm−3 to 4.83 × 1015 cm−3 as shown in Fig. 6d and e. Additionally, due to its energetically similar ionization potential of −5.37 eV compared with the VBM of MAPbI3 (−5.4 eV), BDPSO can facilitate hole transport and reduce charge recombination. The PCE of the optimized inverted device with the HTL-free structure is as high as 17.1%.
Huang et al. introduced 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) into perovskite to increase its hole concentration and electrical conductivity.32 When F4TCNQ is doped into MAPbI3, the electrons in MAPbI3 can be thermally excited into the LUMO level of F4TCNQ, leaving holes in MAPbI3 and thus leading to a higher hole concentration. Fig. 7a shows the change of the perovskite film surface potential upon F4TCNQ doping, which can also support the fact that F4TCNQ doping would lead to favorable band bending to reduce ΔEh and help in the collection of holes by the ITO electrode. The illustration of interfacial band bending is shown in Fig. 7b. With methylammonium hypophosphite (MHP) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) as additives in the precursor solution, the HTL-free inverted PSCs with F4TCNQ doping show the highest PCE of 20.2%, while the PCE of the reference device is only 11%.

Hatton et al. reported the first inorganic CsSnI3-based HTL-free inverted PSCs.28 They introduced SnCl2 into the perovskite layer to minimize the pinhole density and improve the contact between perovskite and the ETM (PCBM). They claimed that SnCl2 diffuses into the PCBM, giving rise to an n-type doping effect, which could impede hole extraction to PCBM. UPS measurement was utilized to verify their hypothesis via measuring the energy level of PCBM on ITO with and without SnCl2. In addition, HRXPS results show that SnCl2 in PCBM exhibits a 0.4–0.5 eV increase of the binding energy for Sn 3d orbitals, which also supports n-type doping. The optimized CsSnI3-based HTL-free inverted device based on SnCl2 doping shows a PCE of 3.56%.
4. Flexible and semi-transparent devices
Flexible PSCs can be fabricated by roll-to-roll printing methods and show promise for application in wearable electronics.69 Chen et al. were the first to report inverted HTL-free PSCs on a flexible PET substrate with a configuration of PET/ITO/MAPbI3/PC61BM/Al.26 The optimized flexible device shows a highest PCE of 9.7% and a stabilized PCE of 9.1%. Chang et al. grew high-quality MAPbI3 thin films by using ultra-purity PbI2 crystals. The flexible inverted HTL-free device based on this high-quality perovskite film shows a high PCE of 10.4% (Table 2).33 Though a PCE >10% can be obtained, the PCE value is too low compared to that of HTL-based inverted PSCs, possibly due to the large resistance from the poor contact between the flexible substrates and electrodes. Therefore, more efforts should be made to improve the contact in flexible devices.
Semitransparent (ST) devices have great application potential in integrated photovoltaics, wearable electronics and coatings on vehicles for producing energy.70 The structure of the HTL-free device is intrinsically suitable for ST-PSCs due to the high transparency and low light loss resulting from the fewer number of layers. Nakamura et al. developed high-performance inverted HTL-free ST-PSCs by improving the quality of perovskite thin films via BDPSO doping.35 MAPbI3 films with 90 and 140 nm thickness were obtained to assemble ST-PSCs with a transparency of 30% and 22%, respectively. The optimized devices show respectable PCEs of 8.0 and 10.3% (Table 2).

5. Stability study of devices
The commercialization of PSCs depends largely on their long-term stability, which has been attracting great attention. The degradation mechanism of PSCs has been extensively studied and lots of engineering methods have been developed to improve the device stability.71 However, there are few reports about the long-term stability of inverted HTL-free PSCs. SnCl2 was introduced to improve the stability of a CsSnI3 thin film in air reported by Hatton et al.28 X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to check the stability of perovskite films with and without SnCl2 exposed to different environments, and the perovskite film with SnCl2 shows better stability. They explained that SnCl2 on the surface of CsSnI3 thin films can act as a desiccant to slow down the attack from water due to the pre-formation of SnCl2·2H2O. The HTL-free inverted device based on CsSnI3 with SnCl2 doping shows better air stability with the reduction of the PCE to 70% of its initial value taking 16 h compared with the reference device degradation to 70% taking only 7 h. Huang et al. introduced F4TCNQ into perovskite,32 and the device without the HTL shows better air stability than the device with the HTL (PTAA), as shown in Fig. 8a. This may be attributed to the reduction of trap density after F4TCNQ doping. Chen et al. fabricated HTL-free inverted devices with a configuration of ITO/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Al.26Fig. 8b shows that this kind of device exhibits better air stability than the reference device based on PEDOT:PSS with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Al. The improvement of the stability is attributed to the absence of PEDOT:PSS.

Reproduced from ref. 35 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
BDPSO (Fig. 8c) with two sulfonate ionic side chains was introduced into the perovskite films, where sulfonate groups would interact with unsaturated Pb2+ in MAPbI3.35 The doping with BDPSO makes the perovskite thin films more stable, possibly due to the interaction of the two side chains of BDPSO with two adjacent MAPbI3 crystal grains. The schematic of the interaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 8d. As a result, the sealed device based on the perovskite thin film with BDPSO doping shows a high light-soaking stability, retaining 93% of the initial PCE after continuous 1000 h illumination under 1 sun. Fig. 8e shows the comparison results from which it can be seen that the reference device retains only 20% of its original PCE.
6. Conclusions and outlook
In conclusion, HTL-free inverted PSCs have achieved great progress and exhibited extremely promising applications in photovoltaic devices. To further promote their commercialization, the following views are suggested to be took into account.
(1) The biggest barrier to obtaining high-performance HTL-free inverted PSCs is the mismatching energy level alignment between perovskite and the anode (ITO). Therefore, reducing the Fermi-level of the anode and/or making the VBM of perovskite shallower would be effective ways to improve the device performance. UV-Ozone treatment and monomolecular layer interfacial modification can help to reduce the Fermi-level of the anode. For the modification of the VBM of perovskite, molecular doping would be a good strategy. It is noted that for some doped insulator molecules there will be charge transfer between the insulator and perovskite, which may lead to upward band-bending at the interface of perovskite and the anode, thus facilitating hole extraction and transport to the anode. For semiconductor molecules, the doping generally enhances hole transport and reduces charge recombination within perovskite thin films.
(2) Fabrication of high-quality perovskite thin films will be another effective way to facilitate charge transport and reduce recombination, resulting in improved efficiency of devices. A variety of techniques, including additive engineering and post-treatment of the as-obtained perovskite thin films, have already been reported to improve the quality of perovskite thin films. Generally, the perovskite thin films of PSCs are polycrystalline and have relatively large defects and thus have adverse effects on the device performance. Therefore, reducing the defects can help to grow high-quality perovskite films. Substituting low-defect perovskite crystals for raw materials (e.g. PbI2 and MAI) is expected to lead to high-quality perovskite thin films. Besides, most HTL-free inverted devices are based on MAPbI3. Therefore, MA and FA mixed perovskite should exhibit a much higher potential in HTL-free inverted PSCs.
(3) It is widely accepted that there are many defects at the grain boundaries and perovskite surface. Reducing and/or eliminating these defects can facilitate charge transport and decrease recombination and thus improve device performance. Interfacial engineering or surface passivation at the interface of perovskite and the ETM will also be a promising approach.
(4) Though >90% of the initial PCE can be retained after 1000 h continuous illumination, there is far away from 20 years expectation for commercial application. There are two approaches that can be considered to improve the long-term stability. FA/MA/Cs mixed perovskite should be exploited due to its higher thermal stability compared with that of MAPbI3. All-inorganic perovskites, including CsPbI3 and CsPbI2Br, show higher thermal stability and should also be attempted. In addition, reducing the defects of perovskite thin films, by surface passivation and/or molecular doping, would be another effective tactic to improve stability.
(5) The graded junction is generally grown on top of the absorber and obtained by compositional engineering. The introduction of the graded junction within the perovskite film may passivate and/or screen defects and thus reduce charge recombination and, simultaneously, this double-layered perovskite architecture is good for stability. Though fabrication of potential graded junctions remains a challenge, it can be an optional approach.
Though the inverted HTL-free PSCs look simple with only a few layers, a lot of aspects require attention, including the perovskite layer, ETM layer, interfacial contacts and so on. We believe that in the near future the device performance and long-term stability will be further promoted by combining various techniques, making them competitive in the photovoltaic field.
