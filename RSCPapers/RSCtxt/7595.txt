    , Accepted 5th January 2021First published on 6th January 2021AbstractTwo FREAs, IUIC-O and IUIC-T, based on an undecacyclic core were developed. IUIC-T having a higher extinction coefficient affords aligned energy levels with PBDB-T, finer nanoscale morphology and more orderly molecular stacking, thus achieving more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Therefore, the PBDB-T:IUIC-T based OSC gains a higher PCE of 13.05%.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) show great potential to solve/relieve current energy crisis and have always attracted considerable attention due to the merits of low-cost, light-weight, mechanical flexibility, large-area fabrication and so on.1,2 The donor (D):acceptor (A) bulk heterojunction structure of the active layer of OSCs achieves great success, since it significantly increases the D/A interfacial area to circumvent the problem of a short exciton diffusion length for a limited exciton lifetime.3,4 Among acceptor materials, fullerene derivatives have dominated bulk heterojunction OSCs for almost two decades.5–9 However, this situation has changed since 2015 due to the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptors, especially fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs).10–13 To date, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of FREA based OSCs have reached 18%,14–16 which are much higher than those of the best fullerene based ones (∼12%).17 The quick development of FREAs benefits from their unique structural features, which consist of a fused ring donor moiety in the center, side chains hanging out of the molecular plane and two compact strong electron-withdrawing groups at both ends.18 Furthermore, these three components can be independently modified, providing greatly synthetic flexibility and thus easily tunable optical, electronic and morphological properties. The intense intramolecular charge transfer effect between the donor moiety and the electron-withdrawing groups makes FREAs exhibit strong absorption in the visible/near-infrared region, which contributes to sunlight harvesting for high short-circuit current density (JSC) in devices. In addition, FREA based OSCs can work efficiently with small energy loss (Eloss), which helps to achieve high open-circuit voltage (VOC) without sacrificing the JSC and fill factor (FF) of devices. As a result, numerous high performance FREAs were developed and the PCEs of FREA based OSCs increase continuously, which greatly boosts the advance of OSCs.
Extending the π-conjugation of the donor moiety in FREAs can efficiently reduce the bandgap for enhanced absorption, improve the electron-donating capability for uplifted energy levels and reinforce intermolecular interactions for higher electron mobility. Thus FREAs having a large π-conjugation donor moiety for high-efficiency OSCs can be expected.19,20 For instance, when extending the donor core from hexacyclic core-based IHIC2 to octacyclic core-based IOIC2 and even to decacyclic core-based IDCIC, their absorption onset shows a redshift from 745 nm to 801 nm and to 853 nm, and the JSC of the corresponding devices increases from 16.1 mA cm−2 to 19.7 mA cm−2 and to 21.98 mA cm−2, respectively.19,20 Simultaneously, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the FREAs also up-shifts when extending the donor core, which helps to achieve higher VOC. Therefore, the PCEs of OSCs based on IHIC2, IOIC2 and IDCIC increase from 7.31% to 12.3% and to 13.58%, respectively. However, there are only a handful of decacyclic or undecacyclic core-based FREAs (IDTIDT-IC, F10IC, DTPC-DFIC, IDCIC and IUIC) reported so far.20–23 Their chemical structures and the photovoltaic performance are summarized in Fig. 1. Therefore, more efforts should be taken to develop large donor moiety based FREAs and further improve the efficiencies of OSCs. In addition, by introducing conjugated side chains, intramolecular conjugation can be extended for enhanced light absorption and JSC. Furthermore, two-dimensional (2D) conjugation also facilitates charge transport due to the promoted π–π overlap and intermolecular interactions.24,25 This strategy has been widely applied in donor materials, but rarely reported in acceptors.26,27
 Fig. 1  The chemical structures and PCEs of decacyclic or undecacyclic core based FREAs. 
In this article, we combine the extending fused-ring donor core and the 2D conjugation strategy to design highly efficient FREAs. Based on a new undecacyclic core, two FREAs, IUIC-O and IUIC-T, were developed (Fig. 2). Both FREAs show strong absorption in the Vis-NIR region and good molecular stacking. The highly efficient polymer PBDB-T, which possesses complementary absorption, was chosen as the donor to fabricate OSCs with them. The exciton dissociation, charge transport and morphology of the devices were investigated. The PBDB-T:IUIC-T based OSC achieves a PCE of 13.05% which is much higher than that of the PBDB-T:IUIC-O based one (7.66%), mainly due to its stronger absorption, more efficient exciton dissociation, finer nanoscale phase separation and better molecular packing in blend films for higher mobility, and thus higher JSC in the PBDB-T:IUIC-T device.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of IUIC-O and IUIC-T are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†) and their synthetic details are presented in the ESI.† The solution and thin-film absorption spectra of IUIC-O and IUIC-T are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Fig. 3, respectively. The corresponding optical data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). In solution, both IUIC-O and IUIC-T demonstrate strong absorption in the range of 600–850 nm. The maximum absorption peak of IUIC-O is located at 768 nm, which is slightly redshifted compared to IUIC-T. This is ascribed to the stronger electron-donating capacity of alkoxy side chains than alkyl-thienyl substitutes. However, the maximum extinction coefficient of IUIC-T is higher than that of IUIC-O (2.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1vs. 1.8 × 105 M−1 cm−1), which results from the superior conjugation effect of alkyl-thienyl substitutes on the backbone. Compared with the absorption of their solutions, the maximum absorption peaks of IUIC-O and IUIC-T films show remarkable redshift from 768 to 812 nm and from 757 to 795 nm, respectively, which implies the compact molecular stacking in the solid state of IUIC-O and IUIC-T. The optical gaps of IUIC-O and IUIC-T, estimated from the absorption onset of the thin film, are 1.34 and 1.37 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the classic wide band-gap polymer PBDB-T was chosen as the donor, which possesses strong absorption in the range of 300–650 nm.28 The complementary absorption between the donor and acceptors, as shown in Fig. 3, would offer good opportunity for high JSC.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to evaluate the energy levels of IUIC-O, IUIC-T and PBDB-T (Fig. S4, ESI†). According to the empirical equation, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of IUIC-O, IUIC-T and PBDB-T were calculated to be −5.16 eV, −5.26 eV and −5.16 eV, respectively. The small HOMO offsets between the donor and acceptors would promise low Eloss. The LUMO energy levels of IUIC-O, IUIC-T and PBDB-T were calculated to be −3.93 eV, −3.92 eV and −3.02 eV, respectively. IUIC-O and IUIC-T present almost the same LUMO energy levels, indicating that the side chains on the donor moiety have a negligible influence on the LUMO energy level of FREAs. Because of the stronger electron-donating capacity of alkoxy than alkyl-thienyl, IUIC-O offers a shallower HOMO energy level and thus a narrower bandgap than IUIC-T, which is consistent with their optical bandgaps. We further conducted UPS, which is more reliable than the electrochemical method, to measure the HOMO energy levels of the donor and acceptors (Fig. S5, ESI†). According to Fig. S5 (ESI†), the HOMO energy levels of IUIC-O, IUIC-T and PBDB-T were calculated to be −4.87 eV, −5.16 eV and −4.86 eV, respectively, which shows the same tendency as the electrochemical results.
The inverted OSCs with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:FREA/MoO3/Ag were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic performance of IUIC-O and IUIC-T. The J–V curves and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. 4a and Table 1, respectively. The IUIC-T based OSC affords a PCE as high as 13.05%, while the PCE of the IUIC-O based OSC is only 7.66%. The higher PCE of the IUIC-T based OSC is mainly ascribed to its much higher JSC (22.2 mA cm−2vs. 13.7 mA cm−2). The higher JSC for the IUIC-T based OSC partially results from its higher extinction coefficient, even though its optical bandgap is slightly wider than that of IUIC-O. Both IUIC-O and IUIC-T based devices afford a decent FF around 0.70, indicating efficient charge transport and extraction in the devices. In addition, IUIC-O and IUIC-T have similar LUMO energy levels, but the VOC of the IUIC-O based OSC is 0.03 V lower than that of the IUIC-T based one. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of both IUIC-O and IUIC-T based OSCs are shown in Fig. 4b. The integral current densities for the IUIC-O and IUIC-T based devices are 13.1 mA cm−2 and 21.2 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the JSC values obtained from the J–V measurement with mismatch within 5%. It can be found that the EQE value of the IUIC-T based OSC is much higher than that of the IUIC-O based one in the whole region of 300–850 nm. For the IUIC-T based OSC, the highest EQE value of 75.7% is located at 730 nm, while the IUIC-O based OSC affords the highest EQE value of only 52.2% at 600 nm. Moreover, the IUIC-O based OSC obtains an EQE value of only about 35% in the range of 700–850 nm (corresponding to the strong absorption region of IUIC-O), which is remarkably lower than the response value in the short wavelength region (corresponding to the absorption of PBDB-T).

The exciton/charge dynamics of the IUIC-O and IUIC-T based devices were conducted to investigate the reasons for the difference in photovoltaic parameters. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the neat films and D/A blend films were measured to explore the exciton dissociation in the blends, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The selected excitation wavelength for PBDB-T is 622 nm. The neat film of PBDB-T exhibits strong PL in the range of 650–850 nm. For the blend films of PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T, the emission is almost completely quenched (by over 98%), indicating effective electron transfer from the donor to acceptors. For both acceptors, the selected excitation wavelength is 800 nm. For the neat films of IUIC-O and IUIC-T, the strong PL appears in the ranges of 900–1100 nm and 850–1050 nm, respectively. For the blend films of PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T, PL is quenched by 15% and 85%, respectively. This indicates that the hole transfer from IUIC-T to PBDB-T is efficient, while the hole transfer in the case of PBDB-T:IUIC-O is inefficient, which is due to the too small HOMO energy level off-set between IUIC-O and PBDB-T for an inadequate charge transfer driving force. As a result, the EQE response of PBDB-T:IUIC-O OSC in the range of 700–850 nm dramatically decreases.
We further investigated the electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of the OSCs. The EQEEL values of PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T OSCs are 9.0 × 10−6 and 2.3 × 10−5, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). According to the formula: ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL), the energy loss from non-radiative recombination, ΔE3, in PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T OSCs is 0.301 eV and 0.277 eV, respectively. The higher ΔE3 in the PBDB-T:IUIC-O OSC leads to its lower VOC.
The charge recombination was explored by studying the dependence of JSC and VOC on the incident light intensities (Plight).29 As for bimolecular recombination, their JSC as a function of Plight was described by fitting to the power law: JSC ∝ Plightα (Fig. 5a).30 The exponent α values for IUIC-O and IUIC-T based devices are 0.989 and 0.984, respectively. Both α values are close to 1, suggesting weak bimolecular recombination in both OSCs, which is beneficial for a high FF. In addition, we further studied monomolecular recombination in PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T OSCs by treating VOC as a function of Plight. The VOC data were plotted against lnPlight (Fig. 5b).31–33 The slopes for PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T based devices are 1.57kT/q and 1.17kT/q, respectively. The smaller slope indicates the less monomolecular recombination in the device.31 Thus, the PBDB-T:IUIC-O OSC suffers more severe monomolecular recombination, which is mainly ascribed to the inefficient exciton dissociation. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the electron mobility (Fig. S8, ESI†).34–36 The electron mobilities of PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T blend films are 1.25 × 10−4 and 1.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobilities of PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T blend films are 2.86 × 10−4 and 6.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher electron and hole mobilities of the PBDB-T:IUIC-T blend film contribute to charge transport for its higher JSC in OSCs.

The morphology of the active layers based on IUIC-O and IUIC-T was studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). In the AFM height images (Fig. S9, ESI†), the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T blend films are 8.19 nm and 7.58 nm, respectively. In the AFM phase images, both PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T blend films show obvious nanofibril structures, which facilitate charge transport and inhibit bimolecular recombination (Fig. 6a and d). Moreover, it can be found that the nanofibrils in the PBDB-T:IUIC-T blend are narrower and finer, which contribute to the exciton dissociation and higher mobility in devices. Furthermore, the TEM images of PBDB-T:IUIC-O and PBDB-T:IUIC-T blend films also exhibit similar nanofibril structures, which are in line with the AFM results (Fig. 6b and e).

The 2D GIWAXS patterns of the neat and blend films and the corresponding intensity profiles in the in-plane (qxy) and out-of-plane (qz) directions are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†) and Fig. 6. All the donor and acceptors in neat films prefer a face-on orientation relative to the substrate. The π–π stacking diffraction peak in the qz direction of IUIC-O is located at 1.76 Å−1, corresponding to the d-spacing of 3.56 Å, while the π–π stacking diffraction peak in the qz direction of the IUIC-T neat film locates at 1.75 Å−1, corresponding to the d-spacing of 3.60 Å. In terms of the Scherrer equation,37 the crystallinity coherence length (CL) values of two neat films can be identified: IUIC-O (2.81 nm) owns slightly longer-range π–π stacking than IUIC-T (2.41 nm). As for blend films, PBDB-T:IUIC-O presents a broad π–π stacking peak located at 1.76 Å−1 contributed from both the donor and acceptor. However, PBDB-T:IUIC-T shows (010) peak splitting, from which the π–π stacking peaks of PBDB-T (1.55 Å−1) and IUIC-T (1.72 Å−1) can be distinguished. It indicates a relatively immiscible nature of two materials. This is consistent with the AFM results as pure phase, but a smaller size, can be observed in the PBDB-T:IUIC-T blend film. The CL value of IUIC-T in the blend film increased to 2.59 nm, indicating the enhanced π–π stacking, while the CL value of PBDB-T is 4.92 nm in the blend film of PBDB-T:IUIC-T and its π–π stacking is better than that in the blend film of PBDB-T:IUIC-O. In addition, a diffraction peak at 0.40 Å−1 is observed in the in-plane direction of the PBDB-T:IUIC-T film, corresponding to the d-spacing of 15.85 Å, which is ascribed to the (001) stacking peak of IUIC-T. It demonstrates the orderly molecular packing along the conjugated backbone of IUIC-T in the blend film, facilitating the charge transport.38 Overall, the favorable molecular packing of the donor and acceptor in the PBDB-T:IUIC-T blend film facilitates charge transport for the higher JSC and PCE in OSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, two FREAs, IUIC-O and IUIC-T, based on a new undecacyclic donor core with different side chains were developed. IUIC-T having 2D conjugated side chains possesses a higher extinction coefficient than IUIC-O. Blended with the donor PBDB-T, the IUIC-T based OSC achieves a higher PCE of 13.05% with a much higher JSC, which is due to the aligned energy level with the donor for efficient exciton dissociation, finer nanoscale phase separation and more orderly molecular packing in the blend film for charge transport. However, the PBDB-T:IUIC-O OSC affords an inferior PCE of 7.66% due to the too small HOMO energy level off-set between IUIC-O and PBDB-T for inefficient charge dissociation, and the increased non-radiative recombination. Actually, IUIC-T is among the highest efficiency FREAs having such a large donor core. This work demonstrates that developing a large fused ring donor core is an efficient method to construct high performance FREAs and 2D conjugated side chains can improve the photovoltaic performance of FREAs efficiently.
