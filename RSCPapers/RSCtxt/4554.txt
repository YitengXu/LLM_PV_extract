    , Accepted 28th June 2013First published on 1st July 2013AbstractWe describe the preparation of a polymer composite containing a Mg-based metal–organic framework (MOF) through a rapid and environmentally friendly UV-induced free-radical process. The composite is used as an electrolyte for quasi-solid dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Notable solar energy conversion efficiencies were obtained (η = 4.8%), together with an outstanding long-term durability. Besides being an effective candidate for the enhancement of DSSC performance, this first ever MOF-based polymeric composite proves to be potentially exploitable for other applications, e.g. in the field of supported catalysis.
Dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention as a cost-effective alternative to conventional solar devices.1,2 In the past two years, scrupulous research in the field of dyes and redox couples allowed solar energy conversion efficiencies higher than 12% to be achieved.3 However, one of the main factors that hampers the widespread practical use of DSSCs is their poor long-term durability, mainly caused by the leakage and the volatilization of the organic solvents present in the liquid electrolyte. Thus, much attention has been given to modifying or replacing organic solvents, by employing gelling agents4 or ionic liquids,5 and introducing nanoparticles,6 p-type semiconductors,7 conductive organic materials,8 or perovskites.9 Among all of them, polymer membranes have been identified as a promising alternative to liquid electrolytes.10 The swelling of these membranes by a liquid electrolyte leads to polymer electrolytes characterized simultaneously by high ionic diffusion and by a cohesion nearly as good as a true solid system. Therefore these polymer electrolytes show good long-term stability, maintaining high ionic conductivity and interfacial contact properties.11
As discussed in our recent review article, UV-curing is a promising way for making novel polymer electrolyte-based DSSCs, as the polymerization is very rapid (not more than minutes), no solvent is used, and is usually carried out at room temperature, thus guaranteeing an energy saving process.12 The physicochemical and mechanical properties of the crosslinked polymers can be tuned by proper selection of reactive monomers and by modulating the functionality of the reactive systems (e.g. the crosslinking density of the obtained network). The performances of the polymers in DSSCs can be enhanced by varying these parameters as discussed in the literature.10,13 Furthermore, the mechanical properties of these membranes make them also suitable for use in the increasingly popular flexible devices.14–16
We think that an alternative strategy to tailor the properties of polymer electrolyte membranes could be the use of solid additives properly dispersed in the UV-cured network. In this respect, even if for other applications, very recently new interesting structures have been described in the literature as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).17,18 They consist of an infinite network of metal centers (or inorganic clusters) bridged by simple organic linkers through metal–ligand coordination bonds, and are widely used in catalysis,19 sensors,20 ion exchange,21 gas storage,22 purification,23 separation24 and sequestration.25 To the best of our knowledge, no reports are present in the literature concerning their use in polymer matrices for any application, while as regards DSSC application two studies are present concerning the electrode materials. Kundu et al. prepared a Zn-MOF, which – after calcination – led to ZnO microparticles, which replaced the traditional TiO2-based photoanode; however, the sunlight conversion efficiency of the assembled liquid cell was very low (0.15%).26 Li et al. prepared a Zn-MOF, which was used to coat the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode: an enhancement of the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the liquid-state DSSC was observed.27 In this case, an appreciable efficiency (5.34%) was obtained, and the increase in Voc was ascribed to retarded interfacial charge recombination.
In this communication, for the first time a new MOF is introduced in a polymer matrix for the preparation of an innovative polymer electrolyte membrane for quasi-solid DSSCs. The UV-curing of acrylic monomers in the presence of the ad hoc synthesized Mg-MOF, the physico-chemical characterization of the obtained macromolecular networks and the photovoltaic behavior of the assembled DSSCs are presented.
The MOF was synthesized by an electrolytic process, and its structure is represented in Scheme 1. Details of the preparation and characterization of the Mg-MOF powder are presented in the ESI.† UV-curable reactive mixtures were prepared by mixing poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) (80:20 weight ratio), and adding Mg-MOF powder in different amounts (0, 1, 2, 3 wt%). Under UV light, the propagation of PEGDA led to a three-dimensional crosslinked network, while the co-monomer PEGMA – being monofunctional – reduced the crosslinking density of the polymeric network, diminishing the glass transition temperature (Tg) and increasing the mobility of the redox mediator in the polymer matrix.28 As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 1, the resulting membranes were self-standing, soft, flexible and not sticky. All the UV-cured samples were transparent, which indicated the absence of any macroscopic Mg-MOF agglomeration, and were activated by soaking them into a liquid electrolyte swelling solution composed of 0.3 M NaI, 0.03 M I2, 0.2 M MPII, and 0.35 M TBP in CH3CN.

The kinetics of photopolymerization, investigated by real time FT-IR spectroscopy, are shown in Fig. 1. They show a typical profile of the polymerization processes of multifunctional systems, leading to the formation of crosslinked architectures: the reaction rate decreases while the polymer is formed, the concentration of the reactive species decreases and the viscosity increases; when the gel point is reached, the reactive species still present have poor mobility, their diffusion is hindered and the reaction rate is zero. Final conversions between 79% and 91% were obtained in a few minutes, demonstrating the rapidity of the photopolymerization reactions in comparison with the traditional processes. The initial rate and final conversion decreased as a function of the amount of Mg-MOF introduced in the reactive mixture. This fact can be explained by a UV absorption competition between the photoinitiator and the benzene tricarboxylic moieties of the Mg-MOF. Despite the fact that the conversion was never higher than 91%, all the composite films showed high gel content values (Table 1), indicating that very few extractable oligomers or monomers were present.

DSC measurements were performed on cured films in order to evaluate the Tg of the Mg-MOF/PEGMA/PEGDA membranes. As can be seen in Table 1 and Fig. S3,† it was found that the addition of Mg-MOF did not significantly alter the Tg of the cured samples, as expected: in fact the amount of MOF is limited and was unable to influence the mobility of the polymer chains. All Tg values are well below 0 °C, therefore all the materials are in the desired rubbery state at RT, and undesirable phase transitions during the functioning of the device are excluded. The thermal stability of the membranes was assessed by TGA and the results are shown in Fig. S4.† The temperature at which the thermal degradation starts can be assumed as the temperature at which the weight loss is 5% (T5, Table 1). It was always higher than 220 °C, therefore the thermal stability of the UV-cured membranes is very high when compared to the conventional operating temperature of DSSCs (always lower than 100 °C). Moreover, it was also observed that the increase in the Mg-MOF content led to a slight increase in the thermal stability of the samples.
Quasi-solid DSSCs were sealed by placing the soft polymer electrolyte membrane, after being swollen in the liquid solution containing the redox mediator, between the anode and cathode, as shown in Fig. 2. The photocurrent versus photovoltage characteristics of the cells are shown in Fig. S5,† and the values of photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1.

At first glance, it can be noted that the photovoltaic performance is strongly influenced by the amount of Mg-MOF present in the UV-cured polymer networks. In particular, it can be seen that the Voc, determined by the quasi Fermi level of TiO2 and the potential of redox couple, increases with the amount of Mg-MOF (Fig. S6B†). This rise may be ascribed to the changed conduction band edge of TiO2 due to its coordination with terminal carboxyl groups of the Mg-MOF particles present at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface. The establishment of interactions between carboxy-terminated species and TiO2 is well known in physical chemistry,29 and in our system this interaction can shield the trap states of the TiO2 electrode, thus reducing the rate of charge carriers recombination reactions.30 This observation is in good accordance with EIS measurements: as reported in Fig. S7,† EIS spectra evidence a decrease of the charge-transfer resistance related to electron recombination (central arc of the impedance spectra). Moreover, the fitted parameters reported in Table S1† show that the effective electron lifetime (τn) increases with the amount of Mg-MOF introduced in the polymer network: this fact leads to a reduction of the recombination at the interface between the TiO2 layer and the polymer electrolyte, confirming that the conduction band edge of TiO2 changes after its coordination with the terminal carboxyl groups of the Mg-MOF particles. As a further evidence of the correlation between Voc and Mg-MOF content, it can be noted that the resulting lower electron recombination is also reflected in the increased FF values (Table 1 and Fig. S6C†) for increasing amounts of Mg-MOF introduced in the polymer electrolyte.31 Lastly, in order to confirm that this beneficial effect was due to the organic frameworks around the central Mg atoms of the Mg-MOF, we prepared membranes containing common Mg(II) inorganic salts (MgO, MgCO3), but no positive effects were observed.
The only photovoltaic parameter that got worse in the presence of Mg-MOF was the Jsc (Table 1 and Fig. S6A†): this could be due to the fact that Mg-MOF particles in the bulk of the polymer membranes slightly hindered the ion transport in the electrolyte, leading to lower ionic conductivity values, which reflected in the lower Jsc observed. Anyway, this slight decrease was largely offset by the increase in Voc and FF: in fact, the increasing amount of Mg-MOF in the photopolymerized network resulted in an overall increase in the efficiency of sunlight conversion (Fig. S6D†).
Since the key objective of polymer electrolytes is that of increasing the durability of the devices, we set up aging tests on the four DSSCs reported in Table 1. As can be seen in Fig. 3, it is surprising to observe how, on increasing the amount of Mg-MOF encompassed within the polymer network, the durability of the device considerably increases. After 500 h, the membrane containing 3 wt% of Mg-MOF was able to maintain an efficiency equal to 96% of the initial value: this fact is awesome, especially if compared with the lower long-term performance usually reported for quasi-solid polymer electrolytes.32 The increased long-durability observed can be explained considering that the particles of Mg-MOF also act as a filler, thus improving the stability of the UV-cured polymer matrix against degradation under stress.

In conclusion, for the first time ever, a metal-organic framework (Mg-MOF) has been successfully dispersed in a polymer matrix, by a rapid UV-induced process. The kinetics of polymerization and the properties of the final membranes were characterized.
As a first application, the material was used as a polymer electrolyte for quasi-solid DSSCs. High sunlight conversion efficiencies were obtained, and the presence of Mg-MOF in the photocrosslinked networks increased the performance up to 4.8%, due to interactions between the organic shell of the Mg-MOF particles and surface groups of the TiO2 layer. Even more surprising was the long durability of the DSSCs made from the MOF-based polymer electrolyte, which shows itself as a candidate for solving the problems of rapid aging observed in traditional liquid DSSCs.
These excellent results added to the easy preparation method and the low processing costs make Mg-MOF polymer membranes a perfect candidate for the production of durable and efficient quasi-solid electrolytes for DSSCs, especially in the nascent industrial production plants of third generation photovoltaic cells.
In this respect, the presented findings motivate us to undertake extensive experimental investigations on this subject, starting with the study of the effect of different metal centers and the photopolymerization of the electrolyte directly on the photoanode, maybe following the UV-induced process recently proposed by MacFarlane et al.33 In addition, we expect that this material will be considered in the conventional fields of application of MOFs, especially in catalysis and gas adsorption/treatment processes.
