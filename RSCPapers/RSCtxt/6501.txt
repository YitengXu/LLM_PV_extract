    , Accepted 1st September 2016First published on 1st September 2016AbstractBecause of the high C–H bond energy as well as the non-polar feature of CH4 molecules, oxidation of methane under mild conditions remains a challenging task for both C1 utilization and atmospheric environmental cleansing. Here we report that by using a sol–gel method SrCO3 decorated SrTiO3 nanocatalysts (SrTiO3-S) with an average particle size of ∼25 nm can be readily prepared, which surprisingly show efficient performance for photocatalytic oxidation of methane with the activity close to fourfold of P25, a benchmark photocatalyst. Further investigation revealed a synergistic effect between SrCO3 and SrTiO3 when combined together into a composite material as both of which are totally inactive for methane oxidation if used alone. Gas adsorption characterization disclosed that the SrCO3 can adsorb methane and cannot adsorb carbon dioxide, whereas the SrTiO3 will preferentially adsorb CO2 instead of CH4. Photocurrent and photoluminescence measurements indicate that SrCO3 exhibits a negligible photocurrent response relative to the SrTiO3 semiconductor under simulated solar light illumination but the formation of the SrCO3/SrTiO3 junction structure (SrTiO3-S) helps reduce surface recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. All these results refer to the synergistic mechanism in which the SrCO3 acts as a trapping agent to adsorb methane and weaken its C–H bond while the SrTiO3 acts as a photocatalyst to activate and oxidize methane under light illumination. The underlying photooxidation mechanism is further investigated with the aid of in situ electron paramagnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy.
Introduction
Methane, as an important fuel and chemical feedstock, is widely used in new energy vehicles, power stations and chemical plants. The release of methane during storage, transport, and use was ignored for a long time, which contributes significantly to the increase of atmospheric methane concentration. Nowadays with the increasing concern as regards environmental pollution and climate changes coupled with the fact that the greenhouse gas effect of methane is more than twenty times greater than that of carbon dioxide by mass over a century, the conversion of atmospheric CH4 into equimolar amounts of CO2 attracts more attention since it can have a significant impact on these issues.1–6
Catalytic combustion has been intensively investigated for this purpose, however, since CH4 is a symmetrical molecule and a very stable hydrocarbon with an extremely high ignition temperature (>1060 °C), the development of active catalysts that directly oxidize methane under ambient conditions remains a challenging task for both C-1 utilization7–10 and atmospheric environmental cleansing.1,3,11–14 Currently, the state-of-the-art thermal catalyst reported for methane oxidation still requires a reaction temperature of ∼400 °C.13,15 The high operation temperature and inefficiency in removing trace amounts of methane will limit its application in the treatment of atmospheric methane.
Heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductors and sunlight, as a room temperature and environmentally friendly technique, has been promising for the removal of a variety of hydrocarbons in air.15–19 However, photocatalytic oxidation of methane is exceptionally challenging because of the high C–H bond energy (434 kJ mol−1) as well as the non-polar feature of the CH4 molecule.3,9,13,14 So far, tremendous efforts have been made to optimize TiO2 photocatalysts for methane oxidation,11,20,21 however their photoactivity is still far from satisfactory. Non-TiO2 semiconductors with either strong reductive or oxidative capabilities were also applied to treat hydrocarbons.22–25 Efficient photocatalytic oxidation of methane at room temperature remains a challenging task.
In our previous studies, heterojunction interface design,25 morphology control,26 and band edge modulation27 were successively employed to fabricate photocatalytic materials to address the hydrocarbon photooxidation, and some small molecule hydrocarbons such as C3H8 and C2H4 can be efficiently treated by these techniques. In this paper, we report a new strategy realizing a highly efficient methane oxidation under ambient conditions by fabricating SrCO3 decorated SrTiO3 nanocatalysts (SrTiO3-S). Originally, none of the two materials are active for methane oxidation. The decoration of a bit of SrCO3 on the surface of SrTiO3 results in unexpected photoactivity for methane oxidation under simulated solar light illumination.
Results and discussion
The SrTiO3-S sample was fabricated by a sol–gel route. For comparison purposes, SrTiO3, BiVO4, g-C3N4, Ag3PO4 and other samples with known strong photocatalytic capabilities28–39 were also fabricated by either solid state reaction, hydrothermal, or other modified methods. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†) revealed a cubic perovskite-structure type with a lattice parameter of 3.901(6) angstroms for all the SrTiO3 samples. Careful inspection of phase compositions revealed that the SrTiO3-S sample contains a trace amount of SrCO3 (Fig. 1a). This point is supported by FTIR (Fig. 1b) analysis where the vibration modes of CO32− were detected only in the SrTiO3-S sample. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations further identified nanojunction-structured composites for the SrTiO3-S sample. As shown in Fig. 2a, the SrTiO3-S sample exhibits an irregular morphology with an average particle size of ∼25 nm. Characteristic lattice fringes of 0.345 nm and 0.196 nm are clearly observed in high resolution TEM images (Fig. 2b) and match well with the (021) plane of SrCO3 and the (200) plane of SrTiO3, respectively.40,41 For the SrTiO3 samples fabricated by a solid state reaction (SrTiO3-C) and by a hydrothermal method (SrTiO3-H), no carbonate is detected. The UV-visible diffuse absorption spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†) show less distinction between the SrTiO3 samples while the deduced band gap of 3.15 eV is consistent with what has been reported for SrTiO3. Table S1 (ESI†) lists the surface areas and particle sizes of the various fabricated SrTiO3 samples. There is relatively little difference between the fairly large BET determined surface areas of the SrTiO3-H (32.68 m2 g−1) and SrTiO3-S (43.15 m2 g−1) samples relative to the much smaller BET determined surface area of the SrTiO3-C sample (5.45 m2 g−1). The weight content of SrCO3 in SrTiO3-S is determined to be ∼3.0 wt% by analyzing the ratio of Sr:Ti from the XPS spectra and assuming that the stoichiometric ratio of Sr:(Ti + C) equals one.

From the above results, we know that SrCO3 is only formed on the SrTiO3-S. This can be explained as follows: during the preparation of SrTiO3-S by the sol–gel method (550 °C), citric acid was added to the precursor. This compound would be decomposed during the thermal treatment process (>175 °C), which would provide carbon dioxide for further reaction with Sr(II) to form SrCO3. For the SrTiO3-H, before hydrothermal treatment, an excess amount of NaOH solution was added to the precursors of Sr(II), butyl titanate and citric acid. Therefore, NaOH would react with citric acid to form sodium citrate. This compound is stable at temperature up to 220 °C. Since the hydrothermal treatment is performed at 200 °C, sodium citrate cannot be decomposed to form CO2 for producing SrCO3. For the SrTiO3-C, the sample is prepared by the calcination method at 1100 °C for 24 hours using SrCO3 and TiO2 as precursors. Since SrCO3 will be completely decomposed at 1100 °C, no SrCO3 can exist on the SrTiO3-C.
The photocatalytic oxidation of methane over the fabricated semiconductors was carried out in a custom-modified pyrex reaction cell (Fig. S3a, ESI†) under simulated solar light illumination by a 300 W Xe lamp (the Xe lamp spectrum is provided in Fig. S3b, ESI†). Each of the samples with known strong reduction or oxidation capabilities investigated (Fig. S4, ESI†), g-C3N4, CdS, Cu2O, BiVO4, and Ag3PO4, do not exhibit any activity for CH4 photo-oxidation except P25 which shows a moderate photoactivity (Fig. S5, ESI†). Both the SrTiO3-H and SrTiO3-C (Fig. 3a) samples also show no activity. By strong contrast, the SrTiO3-S sample exhibits exceptional activity for CH4 photo-oxidation with a performance that is significantly higher than P25, a benchmark photocatalyst. Further investigation revealed that the reactions follow pseudo-first-order kinetics and the apparent reaction rate constant k deduced from the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model is 0.48 and 0.13 for the SrTiO3-S and P25 samples (Fig. 3b), respectively. Changing the initial concentration of methane affects slightly the activity of the SrTiO3-S sample (Fig. S6, ESI†). However, the degradation efficiency does not alter too much when the initial CH4 concentration is doubled. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity is highly stable during the cyclic methane photooxidation reactions (Fig. 3c and d). The turnover number for methane photooxidation is determined to be 1.64 (see ‘Turnover number calculations’ in the ESI†), indicating that the reaction is truly driven by a catalytic process.

The photocatalytic oxidation of methane usually involves in the reactive oxygen species (˙O2−, ˙OH). It is demonstrated that the hydroxyl radicals can react with methane to generate a methyl radical. Superoxide radicals are also important species, which are active during the degradation of the hydrocarbon species. Therefore, their standard redox potentials are compared with the band edge positions of the as-prepared semiconductors, aiming to examine if the formation of these species is the rate limiting step during methane oxidation. However, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the samples with strong reduction or oxidation abilities (g-C3N4, CdS, Cu2O, BiVO4 and Ag3PO4), which are able to produce ˙O2− or ˙OH radicals (Fig. S4, ESI†), are completely inactive for methane oxidation. This result suggests that the formation of oxygen and hydroxyl radicals is not the rate limiting step during methane oxidation.
Previous studies reported that bulk and surface defects such as oxygen vacancies play an important role in semiconductor photocatalysis.42,43 Therefore we treated the various samples at 600–650 °C under either oxidative or reductive atmospheres for several hours to change the defect states and concentrations. However, none of these treatments resulted in any of the initially inactive semiconductors becoming active for CH4 photooxidation. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis (Fig. S7a, ESI†) indicated that the SrTiO3-S samples have the least concentration of oxygen vacancy and trivalent titanium ion defects. Photoluminescence (PL) spectral analysis (Fig. S7b, ESI†) revealed that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in the SrTiO3 particles follows the order SrTiO3-H > SrTiO3-S > SrTiO3-C.
The aforementioned results suggest that the presence of SrCO3 on the surface of the SrTiO3 particles is responsible for the unexpected photoactivity of the SrTiO3-S samples. One might therefore speculate that a SrCO3 semiconductor on its own might well be an active photocatalyst for methane photo-oxidation. As no methane oxidation activity could be detected when only SrCO3 was employed as the catalyst (Fig. 3a), however, this possibility can be excluded. It is thus rational to deduce that there must be a synergistic effect between the two inactive (on their own) semiconductors SrCO3 and SrTiO3 when combined together into a composite material. To examine this speculation, a small amount of commercial SrCO3 was intentionally mixed with the inactive SrTiO3-H powder synthesized by the hydrothermal route. It was found that this treatment does indeed make the resultant composite efficient for methane photo-oxidation (Fig. 3a). The optimized weight ratio of SrCO3 in the SrCO3–SrTiO3-H is determined to be 5 wt% (Fig. S8a, ESI†). To further confirm the role of SrCO3, we also prepared a SrCO3–TiO2 composite (5 wt%SrCO3–P25) and investigated its photoactivity (Fig. S8b, ESI†). The SrCO3 decoration also enhances the photoactivity of P25 for methane oxidation.
Why does SrCO3 play a very important role in the photo-oxidation of methane? It is known that SrCO3 is a basic oxide while CH4 is a Lewis acid. The interaction between acidic CH4 and basic SrCO3 may favour the adsorption as well as activation of methane molecules in the photocatalytic experiments. Low-pressure volumetric gas adsorption measurements confirmed that the SrTiO3-S sample exhibits the highest CH4 uptake performance of all the SrTiO3 samples, though its capacity for adsorbing CH4 is still very low (Fig. 4a). In addition, the methane adsorption on the catalyst surface is also investigated by temperature programmed desorption (TPD), as shown in Fig. 4b. For the SrTiO3-H without SrCO3 decoration, there are three types of basic sites for methane adsorption, which are associated with the desorption of CH4 at the temperature of 90–110 °C, 200–220 °C and >420 °C, respectively. For the SrTiO3-S with SrCO3 decoration, the spectra also present three desorption peaks of methane but with higher strength, the main one with the desorption maximum at 438 °C and two subpeaks desorbing at 110 and 270 °C, respectively. As compared to that of SrTiO3-H, the desorption peaks upon SrTiO3-S are shifted to the higher temperature. These results indicate that SrCO3 decoration would facilitate more CH4 adsorption and enhance the interaction between methane and catalyst surfaces, which helps weakening the C–H bond of methane.

(a) The methane adsorption isotherms for the SrTiO3 samples measured at 22 °C; (b) TPD-MS thermograms of methane desorption over the samples; (c) infrared spectra showing CO2 adsorption over various materials at room temperature in the reaction atmosphere containing methane; (d) TPD-MS thermograms of CO2 desorption over SrCO3 and SrTiO3-H, respectively. 
Generally, there are two possible adsorption modes of methane on the catalyst surface: one is that a hydrogen atom of methane interacts with the Lewis basic site of the catalyst to form a monodentate adsorbed species; the other is that the carbon atom and hydrogen atoms both interact with the Lewis acid–base pair of catalysts to form a bidentate adsorbed species. The latter mode will result in additional FTIR peaks at 2900 and 2890 cm−1 because of the reduction of molecular symmetry.44 In our case, the FTIR spectra collected (Fig. S9 and Table S2, ESI†) are similar to those of free methane, implying that the methane is adsorbed as a monodentate adsorbed species on the samples.
Now that the alkalinity of the catalyst surfaces is so important, can the SrCO3 herein be substituted by other basic materials? We therefore tried MgO, CaO, BaO, CuO and Fe2O3etc. No methane photo-oxidation activity, however, was obtained regardless of whether these oxides were used alone or used as decoration to replace SrCO3 in the SrTiO3-S sample. Likewise, the inactive SrTiO3 samples in combination with various concentrations of NaOH also showed no activity for methane photooxidation.
To clarify the problem further, in situ diffusive reflectance infrared spectral (DRIFS) analysis was employed to determine the underlying distinctions between the various materials. It was found (Fig. 4c) that, when the basic oxides were employed, CO2 would preferentially adsorb on their surface as its acidity is stronger than CH4. The adsorbed CO2 blocked the adsorption of CH4 and thus ensured that methane photooxidation could not proceed. By contrast, SrCO3 does not adsorb carbon dioxide (Fig. 4c and d). The basic SrCO3 decorated SrTiO3-S sample can provide active sites to adsorb methane, and thereby, favour photooxidation thereafter.
In view of the fact that SrCO3 can be photoexcited under simulated solar light illumination, it is natural to put forward the following question: why does SrCO3 on its own show no photoactivity for CH4 oxidation? To answer this, we then investigated the separation and transportation of photo-generated charge carriers in these samples by photoelectrochemical analysis (Fig. 5a). It is found that SrCO3 exhibits a negligible photocurrent response relative to SrTiO3 semiconductors under simulated solar light illumination. This means that the photogenerated electrons and holes in SrCO3 are rapidly recombined and can therefore hardly participate in the oxidation of CH4, which can also be evidenced by the strong photoluminescence emission of SrCO3 (Fig. 5b). By contrast, the SrTiO3 photoelectrode has a significantly higher photocurrent than the SrCO3 photoelectrode, indicating an efficient charge separation and transportation in SrTiO3. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations using CASTEP41 further revealed the properties underlying the observed physicochemical behaviour of the materials investigated. Though both the samples are indirect bandgap materials (Fig. S10, ESI†), the much larger band gap of 5.14 eV of SrCO3 (Fig. S2b and d, ESI†) as well as its less dispersive valence bands and conduction bands accounts for the negligible photocurrent response of SrCO3 that ultimately results in its poor photoactivity. By contrast, the highly dispersive valence and conduction bands of SrTiO3 are beneficial for the rapid transport of photoexcited electrons and holes. This in turn suppresses the recombination of electron–hole pairs and thus favours the high photocurrent response. Therefore, the unexpected photoactivity of the SrTiO3-S sample can be attributed to the synergistic effect between SrCO3 and SrTiO3, in which the SrCO3 acts as a trapping agent to adsorb methane while the SrTiO3 acts as a semiconductor photocatalyst to activate and oxidize methane at room temperature.

Notably, the 5 wt% SrCO3–SrTiO3-H shows much lower PL intensity than SrCO3 and SrTiO3-H, indicating the efficient charge separation over the nanocomposite. This result can be explained by the matched energy band structure of SrCO3 and SrTiO3, as shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). Moreover, the highly dispersive band structure of SrTiO3 and the less dispersive band structure of SrCO3 (Fig. S10, ESI†) mean that the transfer of photogenerated electrons from SrCO3 to SrTiO3 will definitely improve the charge separation efficiency, which is another reason resulting in the significantly improved photoactivity.
To probe the photooxidation mechanism of methane, EPR was conducted under controlled conditions. As shown in Fig. 6a, under the irradiation of simulated solar light, both the EPR signals of O− and superoxide radicals were clearly identified45 over the SrTiO3-H sample under air or under the mixture of air and methane atmosphere. Considering that SrTiO3-H is totally inactive for methane oxidation, the possibility that superoxide radicals directly oxidize free CH4 molecules is excluded. For the SrTiO3-S samples, methyl radicals are unambiguously identified when the samples are illuminated under air and methane atmosphere (Fig. 6b). Therefore, the adsorption of methane on the catalyst surface is necessary for its activation and oxidation and the SrCO3 plays an important role in this process.

(a) The EPR spectra collected over the SrTiO3-H sample at 100 K under various conditions; (b) the EPR spectra collected over the SrTiO3-S sample at 100 K under various conditions; (c) in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectra (DRIFS) collected at different reaction times during photooxidation of methane over the SrTiO3-S samples. 

In situ IR analysis was further employed to investigate the possible intermediates generated during the photo-oxidative reactions. As shown in Fig. 6c, the IR bands at 1306 and 3017 cm−1 as well as the multiple IR bands close to 3017 cm−1 are assigned to typical vibration modes of methane on a SrTiO3 surface.46,47 Along with the decrease of the intensities of the bands assigned to the v(C–H) vibration of methane, the bands assigned to the characteristic mode of CO2 at ∼2340–2360 cm−1 gradually increase and the broad peaks of the bands at ∼3679 and ∼1650 cm−1 (which corresponds to adsorbed water) are enhanced after light illumination.48 These results confirmed that methane is indeed oxidized to CO2 and H2O (CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O) during the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, the band up shifting from ∼1306 to ∼1325 cm−1 with increasing intensity as well as width and the newly emerged bands at ∼1496 and ∼1420 cm−1 imply that methyl radicals were generated during the photoreactions. Notably, the typical (C–O) vibration bands (1262, 1187 and 1032 cm−1) emerged under the simulated solar light illumination, indicating that intermediate species such as CH3OH or HCOOH18,20,47 may form during methane photo-oxidation.
Based on the above understanding, the mechanism of CH4 oxidation over the SrCO3 decorated SrTiO3 sample under simulated solar light illumination is described as follows (Fig. 7): CH4 molecules are firstly adsorbed on the SrCO3 surface in the SrTiO3-S nanoparticles owing to the acid–base interaction. When the sample is illuminated under simulated solar light, the SrTiO3 semiconductor will be excited. As the valance band of SrTiO3 is mainly formed by O 2p orbitals and its conduction band consists predominantly of Ti 3d orbitals, the excitation of the semiconductor by a photon means the transfer of an electron from the O2− to the Ti4+ resulting in the generation of O− and Ti3+ in the SrTiO3 lattice. Both the O− and Ti3+ in the SrTiO3 lattice are metastable and have strong redox power. Under such a condition, it is easy for oxygen molecules to capture an electron from the Ti3+ ion to form superoxide radicals and, the O− can interact with neighbouring atoms or methane molecules that adsorbed on the SrCO3via the known lattice oxygen activation mechanism.49–51 The activated lattice oxygen as well as the superoxide radicals would then participate in the activation of the weakened C–H bonds and the oxidation processes thereafter. As a result, the CH4 molecules are completely oxidized to CO2via possible intermediates (CH3OH or HCOOH etc.). The main reaction processes of methane oxidation herein can be described by the following steps: CH4 + SrCO3 → CH3–H⋯SrCO3(1) SrTiO3 + hv → SrTiO3 (h+ + e−)(2) e− + O2 → ˙O2−(3) h+ + OO2− → OO−(4) CH3–H + 2˙O2− → CO2 + 2H2O + 2e−(5) CH3–H + 4OO− → CO2 + 2H2O + 4VO−(6) 2VO− + O2 + 2e− → 2OO2−.(7)where h+ represents the photogenerated hole in SrTiO3, e− represents the photoexcited electron in SrTiO3, OO2− represents the lattice oxygen of the SrTiO3, VO represents the oxygen vacancy in SrTiO3 and OO− represents the lattice oxygen trapped with a photogenerated hole.

To further investigate the role of superoxide radicals (˙O2−) and trapped holes in the photocatalytic methane oxidation, the redox potential of the rate limiting step for methane oxidation is calculated based on the standard enthalpy of formation for the matter. As shown in formula 8–10, the redox potential for hydrogen abstraction from methane is determined to be 2.056 V. Based on the previous reports, the redox potential of ˙O2− and photogenerated holes on SrTiO3 is estimated to be −0.16 V and 2.65 V, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). Therefore, we suggest that the photogenerated holes on SrTiO3 with strong oxidizing power would be responsible for the hydrogen abstraction from methane. Since the as-formed ˙CH3 radicals are highly active, ˙O2− can also involve in the oxidation reaction of ˙CH3. Therefore, we suggest that both the superoxide radicals and trapped holes are involved in the reactions of methane. (8)4H+ + O2 + 4e− → 2H2O φ2 φ2 = 1.23 V(9)2CH4 + 1/2O2− → 2˙CH3 + H2O E E = φ1 + φ2 = 2.056 V(10)
Conclusions
In summary, we have found that the assembly of two inactive semiconductors SrCO3 and SrTiO3 can realize a highly active photocatalyst for room temperature photooxidation of methane. The underlying mechanism analysis revealed a synergistic effect between SrCO3 and SrTiO3 in which the SrCO3 adsorbs methane while the SrTiO3 provides active oxygen species to activate and oxidize methane at room temperature. The synergistic effect between SrCO3 and SrTiO3 will be appealing for the design of new catalysts by assembling nanostructures with different functional units.

Preparation of SrTiO3 powders by three different methods

(I) Sol–gel method. 
0.02 mol butyltitanate was added to 0.10 mol ethylene glycol followed by the addition of 0.08 mol citric acid while the solution was heated at 60 °C with continuous stirring. Then, 0.02 mol SrCl2 were added when the solution became clear. The molar ratio of citric acid to total metal cation concentration was kept at 2, and the molar ratio of ethylene glycol to citric acid was 2.5. With continuous heating at 80 °C the solution became a transparent gel with high viscosity. The viscous mass was removed from the hot plate and then calcined at 550 °C for 12 h in a stove to obtain the SrTiO3 powders.


(II) Hydrothermal synthesis method. 
The gel was prepared using the sol–gel route. Then 30 mL of NaOH solution (5 mol L−1) was added to the gel. After stirring for a certain time, the mixture was put into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave. The autoclave was then heated up from room temperature to 200 °C and dwelled at that temperature for 24 hours. The obtained precipitate was washed with distilled water until the pH value was ∼7 and then dried at 80 °C overnight.


(III) Solid state reaction method. 
Stoichiometrically weighted SrCO3 (0.02 mol) and TiO2 (0.02 mol) were thoroughly mixed and then calcined at 900 °C for 12 h. After that, the powders were sintered at 1100 °C for 24 h in an alumina crucible in an air atmosphere with intermediate grinding until a pure SrTiO3 phase was obtained.

Preparation of Cu2O nanoparticles
The Cu2O nanoparticles were prepared as follows: first, 0.002 mol Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O was added to 100 mL of ethanol with constant stirring to form a green solution. Then the solution was heated to 60 °C in a water bath. Subsequently, 100 mL of glucose aqueous solution (0.2 mol L−1) was added to the suspension and then 120 mL of NaOH aqueous solution (0.3 mol L−1) was added dropwise to the above mixture. After 5 min of magnetic stirring, the mixture was removed from the water bath and cooled to room temperature naturally. The precipitates were separated by filtration, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times and then dried in an oven at 60 °C.
Preparation of CdS nanoparticles
The colloidal CdS nanoparticles were prepared using ethanol as the solvent: solution A was prepared by dissolving 108 mg of cadmium chloride (CdCl2·2.5H2O) and 36 mg of thiourea ((NH2)2CS) in 90 mL of ethanol in a flask under magnetic stirring at 60 °C in an oil bath. Solution B was prepared by dissolving 30 mg of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in 30 mL of ethanol. Solution B was rapidly injected into solution A. The mixed solution was held at 60 °C under magnetic stirring for 24 h. CdS nanocrystals were precipitated out by centrifugation and dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
Preparation of Ag3PO4 powders
The Ag3PO4 powders were synthesized by an ion-exchange method: appropriate amounts of AgNO3 and Na2HPO4 were mixed and milled thoroughly until the initial color changed to yellow. The obtained precipitate was washed with distilled water several times and dried at room temperature overnight.
Preparation of BiVO4 powders
The BiVO4 photocatalysts were prepared by a polymeric method: a certain amount of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was first diluted in a mixture solution (pH = 2) of water and acetic acid. Until the metal salts were completely dissolved, acetylacetone (1.0 mol L−1) and HTMA (1.0 mol L−1) were added to the solution. After stirring for 10 minutes, this solution and NH4VO3 (0.1 mol L−1) in hot water were mixed with a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. The resulting solution was then heated under reflux for 1.5 hours with constant stirring and then was dried in an oven at 100 °C followed by sintering at 550 °C in air for 3 hours.
Preparation of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)
Graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) were synthesized by thermal treatment of 5.0 g of urea in an alumina crucible with a cover. After being dried at 70 °C, the precursor was heated to 550 °C for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The light yellow-colored product was washed with nitric acid (0.1 M) and distilled water to remove any residual alkaline species (e.g. ammonia) adsorbed on the sample surface, and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h.
Characterization of photocatalysts
The crystalline structures of the samples were identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) equipment (Rigaku Miniflex II) with Cu Kα radiation. A scan rate of 5° min−1 was applied to record the powder XRD patterns in the 2θ range of 20–80°. The diffuse reflectance (DR) UV-visible spectra of the samples were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere covered with BaSO4 as the reference. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the samples were measured using a TriStar II 3020-BET/BJH Surface Area analyzer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were obtained using a JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a Phi Quantum 2000 spectrophotometer with Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). Before measurements, the samples were pretreated under thermal-vacuum conditions at 200 °C for 2 hours to remove the adventitious carbon species. The binding energies were calibrated using that of C 1s (284.8 eV). Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum System 2000 FTIR. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the photocatalysts were obtained using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were collected on a Bruker EPR A300 instrument. The parameters for the EPR spectrometer are as follows: center field = 3512 G, microwave frequency = 9.86 GHz, and power = 2.01 mW. Low-pressure volumetric CH4 adsorption measurements were performed at 22 °C, with pressures ranging from 0 to 810 mm Hg on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020M System. All gases used were of 99.99% purity or higher. The photocurrent measurements were taken on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D, CH Instruments, Inc.) without bias. The electrolyte was 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution without additives (pH 6.8). In situ FTIR studies were performed on a spectrometer Nexus FT-IR (Thermo Nicolet) by using a diffuse reflectance attachment equipped with a reaction chamber. 128 single beam spectra had been co-added at a resolution of 4 cm−1 and the spectra were presented as the Kubelka–Munk function referred to adequate background spectra. The background and samples spectra were taken (the average of accumulated 32 scans) over the frequency range of 4000–600 cm−1. CO2 and CH4 temperature-programmed desorption measurements were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument connected to a MKS cirrus mass spectrometer. The catalyst powder (0.1 g) was heated in a He flow and kept at 150 °C for 60 min. Then the He flow was replaced by CO2 or CH4, keeping the samples at 60 °C for 60 min. After that, the CO2 or CH4 flow was replaced by He flow again for 60 min, and the TPD signals were recorded at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The CO2 or CH4 desorbed was measured quantitatively using the mass spectrum.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical analysis (photocurrent and Mott–Schottky analysis) was carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as a reference electrode and a Pt electrode acted as a counter electrode. Fluoride-tin oxide (FTO) glass was used to prepare the working electrode, which was firstly cleaned by ultrasound in ethanol for 30 min and dried at 80 °C. The sample powder (10 mg) was ultrasonicated in 1 mL of anhydrous ethanol to obtain evenly dispersed slurry. Then, the slurry was spread onto the FTO glass, the side part of which was protected in advance using Scotch tape. The working electrode was dried overnight under ambient conditions. A copper wire was connected to the side part of the working electrode using a conductive tape. Uncoated parts of the electrode were isolated with epoxy resin. The exposed area of the working electrode was 0.25 cm2. The electrolyte was 0.2 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution (pH = 6.8) without additives. The photocurrent measurements were performed in a home-made three electrode quartz cell using a CHI660D workstation under simulated solar light (200 < λ < 800 nm). The irradiation source was a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300). The Mott–Schottky experiments were conducted on a CHI660D workstation at different frequencies.
Photooxidation experiments
The photocatalytic oxidation of methane was carried out in a custom-modified pyrex reaction cell (volume: 450 mL) under simulated solar light irradiation by a 300 W Xe lamp. All the tests were conducted at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. In a typical procedure: first, 0.2 g of the photocatalysts were spread uniformly on the bottom of the reactor. Then, the reactor was flushed with N2 repeatedly to remove water and CO2 that adsorbed on the catalyst and the inwall of the reactor. Subsequently, the N2 atmosphere in the reaction cell was replaced by fresh air and different volumes of CH4 gas were injected into the reactor using a micro-syringe. Prior to the irradiation, the reactor was kept in the dark for 2 h to ensure the establishment of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and reactants. Then, the reactor was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp from the upper part with a light intensity of ∼200 mW cm−2. At a certain time interval, 4 mL of gas was sampled from the reactor and analyzed using a gas chromatography (GC9720 Fuli) equipped with a HP-Plot/U capillary column, a molecular sieve 13× column, a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
First-principles calculations
The calculations were carried out using the local density approximation. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials were applied with a plane-wave cut off energy of 340 eV. The valence electronic configurations for Sr, Ti, C and O are 5s2, 3d24s2, 2s22p2 and 2s22p4, and the primitive unit cell is composed of [SrTiO3]1 and [SrCO3]4, respectively. Scissors of 1.5 eV and 0.5 eV and a smearing of 0.1 eV were employed, respectively, for the analysis of results.
