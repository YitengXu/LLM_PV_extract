, Accepted 14th July 2016First published on 25th July 2016AbstractTwo non-fullerene acceptors (BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4) have been synthesized by the Suzuki coupling of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9′-bifluorenylidene with 1-bromo-N,N′-di(undecan-6-yl)perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (PDI-Br) and 1-bromo-N,N′-dihexylnaphthalene-2,3:6,7-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI-Br), respectively. The photovoltaic performance of BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4 as acceptors was investigated by fabricating inverted solar cells with structure: ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. Power-conversion efficiencies of 3.64% and 2.28% were achieved using BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4 respectively as the acceptor in a blend with the polymer PTB7-Th as a donor. Although BF-PDI4 exhibits much stronger visible absorption than its NDI analogue this absorption makes a relatively small contribution to the photocurrent; however, the photocurrent resulting from polymer absorption in the BF-PDI4 films is larger than that in BF-NDI4-based cells.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells comprising an electron donor and an electron acceptor, typically a fullerene, have attracted extensive attention due to their low cost, mechanical flexibility and low weight.1 Non-fullerene acceptors have been increasingly explored and applied as alternatives to fullerenes in BHJ organic solar cells, as some can potentially be easily produced on large scales at low cost, and they allow for easier tuning of absorption spectra and energy levels than is possible for fullerene derivatives.2–7
Among non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors, perylene diimide derivatives (PDIs) have been extensively studied and developed for organic photovoltaics (OPV) because of: their electron affinities, which are comparable to those of fullerenes; the tunability of their electronic and optical properties; their high electron mobilities; and their good thermal and photochemical stability.8–21 Moreover, efficient photoinduced charge separation has been observed with a variety of donor polymers.22,23 However, simple monomeric PDIs usually afford very poor PCEs.24 To avoid excessive self-aggregation and formation of large crystalline PDI domains,18 small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors based on PDIs are often designed to have twisted nonplanar structures.8,9,15,16 One design motif that has been investigated in several studies is the linking of four PDI units through their bay or imide positions to a non-planar core – such as a tetraaryl ethylene, methane, silane, or germane, or a spiro-bifluorene – to form compounds of the type X-PDI4, the non-planarity of the core and the sterically induced twist between the core moiety and the PDI resulting in markedly 3D structures that are also resistant to crystallization.10–12,25,26 Additionally, small-molecule naphthalene diimide derivatives (NDIs) have been considered as promising fullerene alternatives by BHJ OPVs,27–34 although, to the best of our knowledge, X-NDI4 structures have not been examined. Compared with PDI-based molecules, NDI-based molecules possess less bulky structures and their cores are more easily substituted.
In this study, our objectives are: to compare the molecular-level properties of X-PDI4 and X-NDI4; to examine whether a X-NDI4 derivative can be successfully used as an electron acceptor in BHJ organic solar cells; and to compare BHJ properties for X-PDI4 and X-NDI4 derivatives that contain comparable proportions of solubilizing alkyl groups. 9,9′-Bifluorenylidene (BF) was chosen as the core: BF can be easily synthesized and is anticipated to be twisted from planarity due to the repulsive steric interactions between the H1–H1′ and H8–H8′ protons.35 Moreover, the BF core is itself reduced fairly readily, due to gain of aromaticity and relief of steric strain35 (indeed unsubstituted BF and related species have been used as an electron acceptors in BHJ OPVs35,36); thus, BF can potentially provide an intermediate bridge to facilitate electron hopping between the rylene diimide “arms” of the molecules. The structures of the two acceptors, BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4, are shown in Fig. 1. It is worth pointing out that different N,N′-alkyl substituents were used for the two compounds to (i) roughly compensate for PDIs generally exhibiting lower solubilities than their NDI analogues and (ii) to afford roughly equal dilution of the active core by inert solubilizing groups (rylene diimide/alkyl ratio weight ratios of 2.3:1 and 2.5:1 for BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4, respectively). We describe their synthesis, characterization, and use in BHJ inverted solar cells in conjunction with two donor polymers, the structures of which are also shown in Fig. 1.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4 were synthesized via the Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9,9′-bifluorenylidene (2) with 1-bromo-N,N′-di(undecan-6-yl)perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (PDI-Br) and 1-bromo-N,N′-dihexylnaphthalene-2,3:6,7-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI-Br), respectively (Scheme 1). The coupling reaction of 2 with PDI-Br and NDI-Br both gave the products in ca. 50% yield, which were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The 1H NMR spectra of the two compounds are broad and complex in the aromatic region, as previously observed for a X-PDI4 derivative of a spiro-bifluorene core;26 this presumably arises due to slow interconversion between different conformers. Consistent with this, the 13C NMR spectra are more complex than one expect if there is free rotation about all the C–C bonds. Despite their high molecular weights, both BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4 exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents including dichloromethane, THF, and chlorobenzene.

Geometric structure
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (in which the N,N′-alkyl substituents were all simplified as methyl groups) were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, to gain insight into the 3D molecular conformations adopted by BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4. Several low-energy minima were obtained for both BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4 that differ in molecular conformation; the three lowest-energy energy for each molecule (differing in energy by 0.22 eV or less, see Fig. S1 in the ESI†) are illustrated in Fig. 2. All these conformations are markedly 3D and characterized by moderate twisting between the two fluorene rings (30–36°) and larger twist angles between each fluorene ring and the adjacent rylene core (55–73° and 53–84° for PDI and NDI respectively). The presence of multiple comparable energy conformers may play a role in making these molecules resistant to crystallization; indeed, neither melting nor recrystallization peaks were observed using differential scanning calorimetry (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†).

Optical properties and electrochemical properties
Fig. 3a and b show the UV-vis absorption spectra of BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4 in dilute THF solution and in films. The low-energy absorption maximum of 528 nm seen for BF-PDI4 is very close to what is seen for simple monomeric PDI derivatives. However, the peak absorptivity (1.17 × 105 M−1 cm−1) is much lower than that expected for four simple non-interacting PDIs, either without bay substitution,24 or with 1,6-diphenyl-substituents,37 and the vibronic structure is very different. This behavior is similar to that seen for previously reported X-PDI4 species with tetrarylethylene or spiro-bifluorene cores,11,26 and presumably arises from excitonic coupling between the different PDI units. The spectrum of BF-NDI4 exhibits a vibronically structured transition with maxima at 380 and 360 nm, which resembles that of a monomeric NDI.38 An additional low-energy band is seen at 459 nm and, in analogy with other NDI-bridge-NDI systems,39 is attributed to BF-to-NDI charge transfer (CT). This CT band is seen at higher energy than that of NDI-bridge-NDI derivatives with various fused thiophene bridges, consistent with the bis(fluorenylidene) bridge acting as a weaker donor, and the peak absorptivity (2.59 × 104 M−1 cm−1) is around twice that of the weakest CT bands seen for NDI-bridge-NDI examples, consistent with the presence of four, rather than two, NDI units. The spectra of neat films of the compounds are slightly red-shifted relative to the solution spectra (by ca. 300 and 700 cm−1 for the low-energy maxima of BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4, respectively); that of BF-NDI4 is otherwise similar to the corresponding solution spectra, while that of BF-PDI4 exhibits some changes in vibronic structure, presumably due to conformational changes affecting intramolecular PDI–PDI interactions and/or to the effects of intermolecular PDI–PDI interactions.

Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV, Fig. 3c) and cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S3 in the ESI†) were employed to study the electrochemical properties of BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4 in THF solution with FeCp2+/0 as an internal reference. Both compounds exhibit multiple successive reductions, as expected given that monomeric rylene dimides24,40,41 and BF derivatives42 all exhibit two successive reductions and that electrostatic and inductive interactions between the different redox centers are expected.43 However, the first reduction potentials are both ca. −1.1 V; this value is typical for simple rylene diimides, whereas BF itself is reduced at ca. −1.6 V,44,45 suggesting the first reduction in each case likely localized on one of the rylene diimide units. From the first reduction potentials electron affinities (EAs) of ca. 3.7 eV can be estimated. From the electrochemically estimated EAs and the onsets of absorption (and so neglecting exciton binding) the ionization energies (IEs) of BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4 are estimated to be 5.8 and 6.0 eV, respectively (Table 1).

Photovoltaic measurements
The photovoltaic properties of the 3D acceptors were investigated by fabricating inverted BHJ solar cells with the structure ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The commercially available low-bandgap polymers PTB7-Th46 (also known as PCE10) and PTB7 47 (Fig. 1), both of which are poorly crystalline,9,48 were used as electron donors. For each combination of polymer donor and 3D acceptor, the photovoltaic performance was optimized by varying the ratio of donor and acceptor and using solvent additives (1-chloronaphthalene and 1,8-diiodooctane; see Tables S1–S4 in the ESI†). The optimized device parameters are summarized in Table 2.

For a given acceptor, devices incorporating PTB7-Th as the electron donor exhibit higher overall PCE than those based on PTB7, largely due to higher short-circuit current density (Jsc), which may, in turn, be a result of the red-shift in the absorption of PTB7-Th relative to that of PTB7.9 The fill factor (FF) is also a little higher with PTB7-Th for devices where BF-PDI4 is the acceptor, but differences in FF for the BF-NDI4 devices are within the error bars. Differences in open-circuit voltage (Voc) values are also within error bars, consistent with the similar IEs estimated for PTB7-Th (5.22 eV) than PTB7 (5.15 eV).46,49
Comparing the two acceptors with a given donor results in much higher PCE values with BF-PDI4 than with BF-NDI4, primarily as a result of considerably higher Jsc values with the former acceptor, although the FF values are also a little higher. The Voc values are essentially the same for the two acceptors, consistent with their essentially identical estimated EAs. From the absorption spectra of neat acceptors and of acceptor/polymer blends (Fig. 3a and b and 4c) it might be assumed that the difference in Jsc values between BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4 acceptors is due to the much stronger and somewhat lower energy visible absorption of the former compound. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 4b) reveal a less straightforward explanation; the EQE values in the range 400–600 nm are lower than in the range 600–750 nm for BF-PDI4 devices, despite the absorption in the former region (attributable primarily to acceptor) being stronger than in the latter (primarily due to polymer), as seen in the spectra of blend films (Fig. 4c). The EQEs at <400 nm vs. those in the polymer-absorbing region for the BF-NDI4 devices are also lower than one would expect based purely on the absorption spectra of blends. The comparison of EQE and absorption spectra, therefore, suggests that productive charge-carrier generation from acceptor-based excitations is less efficient than from polymer excitation in these blends. In this regard, both current systems differ somewhat from some polymer:X-PDI4 solar cells reported in the literature, for which EQE spectra more closely resemble absorption spectra;10,11,25,26 however, a recent study reported that the relative contribution of acceptor absorbance to the photocurrent was much lower for BHJ cells employing a tetraphenylgermane-cored X-PDI4 derivative than for those using its tetraphenylmethane and tetraphenylsilane analogues.12 The reasons for less productive photon harvesting from the acceptor phase are unclear, but might arise from larger domains and/or lower exciton diffusion rates within those domains for the acceptor than the donor. In addition, the EQE values in the long-wavelength region, where it is primarily the polymer that absorbs, are, for a given donor polymer, higher for BF-PDI4 devices than their BF-NDI4 analogues. Thus, the poorer performance (lower Jsc) of BF-NDI4 based devices cannot be explained solely in terms of its absorption spectrum, but also depends on other features that affect charge separation, recombination, and/or collection.

As shown in Fig. 5, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to investigate the morphology of PTB7-Th:BF-PDI4 and PTB7-Th:BF-NDI4 blend films to try to gain some insight into the differences in EQE. The root mean square (RMS) roughnesses obtained from height images is 0.85 and 1.07 nm, respectively, which indicate that the surfaces of these films are quite smooth. In the phase images, a feature size, perhaps corresponding to domain size, of 20–30 nm was observed for PTB7-Th:BF-PDI4 blend film, while a larger feature size of 40–60 nm was observed for PTB7-Th:BF-NDI4 blend film (feature sizes were measured using the open-source program Gwyddion version 2.20). In BHJ solar cells, a relatively small feature domain size (<20 nm)50,51 is crucial for the formation of a donor/acceptor interpenetrating network and efficient exciton diffusion. Thus, the surface morphologies obtained using AFM suggest that PTB7-Th:BF-PDI4 blend film exhibits a more beneficial morphology than PTB7-Th:BF-NDI4 blend film, although a more complete understanding would require the use of additional techniques to elucidate the morphology within the thickness of the films and the dynamics associated with carrier generation and harvesting. Current–voltage characteristics of electron- and hole-only devices were also examined to gain insight into the charge-transport properties of the blend films; although trap-free space-charge-limited current régimes (J ∝ V2) could not be clearly identified, precluding estimation of carrier mobilities, higher electron currents were observed for PTB7-Th:BF-PDI4 than for PTB7-Th:BF-NDI4 over a range of voltages, consistent with more effective electron transport in the former blend (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†).

Conclusions
Two 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (BF) core-based non-fullerene acceptors (BF-PDI4 and BF-NDI4) have been synthesized and compared. It is worth noting that different alkyl substituents were used for the two acceptors since analogues with the same substituents would be expected to have very different solubilities; although the choice of alkyl substituents will have negligible effects on molecular-level properties, the conclusions regarding OPV performance are specific to the particular groups chosen. Due to the twisted structure of BF core and the twist between the rylene diimides and the core, these two acceptors show 3D structures. PTB7-Th outperforms PTB7-Th as an electron donor for these acceptors. Optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.64% and 2.28% were achieved for PTB7-Th:BF-PDI4 and PTB7-Th:BF-NDI4, respectively. Some previously reported X-PDI4 3D acceptors11,52 give better photovoltaic performances (PCE ≥ 5%) than BF-PDI4 as non-fullerene acceptors, mainly because of their higher Jsc values (≥12 mA cm−2). Furthermore, BF-PDI4 shows better Jsc (9.35 ± 0.26 vs. 6.99 ± 0.30 mA cm−2) and FF (45.55 ± 0.80% vs. 38.57 ± 0.57%) than BF-NDI4. BF-PDI4 has good UV-vis absorption between 400 and 600 nm, which can potentially complement the absorption of donor polymers, but this absorption contributes relative little to the photocurrent. Although BF-NDI4 has a weaker absorption in the visible spectral region, its poorer solar cell performance is also due to less efficient photocurrent generation from polymer excitation, perhaps related to morphological differences evident in AFM. Overall, we have demonstrated that the X-NDI4 motif is a viable alternative to X-PDI4, albeit showing poorer PCE in the particular BHJ cells fabricated here from the specific pair of derivatives examined. The drawbacks of the present system relative to its X-PDI4 analogue are potentially addressable through variation of the imide substituents53,54 and through selection of different donor materials, whereas it may be possible to improve its visible absorption using more strongly electron-donating cores.39,55

OPV device fabrication
Organic solar cells were fabricated in an inverted device configuration of ITO/ZnO/polymer:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. ITO coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in micro-90, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in successive steps. The substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 10 min before using. A thin layer of sol–gel ZnO (ca. 10 nm) was spin-coated onto precleaned ITO-coated glass substrates at 4000 rpm and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in air. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol, then stirred overnight. Solutions with a total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 were made from polymer and acceptor in chlorobenzene with different mass ratios and additive concentrations and were spin cast onto the ZnO layer in a argon-filled glovebox at 3000 rpm. At the final stage, the substrates were transferred to high vacuum and molybdenum oxide (10 nm) and silver (100 nm) were sequentially thermally evaporated onto the active layer. The active area defined by shadow masks was 0.07 cm2.
OPV device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of photovoltaic devices were measured under nitrogen in a glove box using a Keithley 2410 source meter. A Newport ABB solar simulator was used as the light source and the light intensity was calibrated using a KG5 filtered Si reference diode. Solar cell performance was measured under standard AM 1.5 G conditions with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The thickness of films was measured by Bruker stylus profilometer. All AFM images were acquired with a Bruker Atomic Force Microscope (Dimension icon) under standard tapping mode.
