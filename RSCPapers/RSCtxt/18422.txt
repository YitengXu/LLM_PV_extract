    , Accepted 29th February 2020First published on 9th April 2020AbstractAn aligned carbon-nanotube array has been identified as an ideal candidate for super-capacitor devices due to its high specific surface, regular pore structures and highly efficient ion transfer paths. However, poor mechanical strength and super hydrophobicity greatly impede its applications in the manipulation of the energy storage device. In this paper, we fabricate a robust flexible solid-state supercapacitor (FSC) device by using a silk fibroin incorporated 3D aligned carbon nanotube array (CNTA) composite matrix. We thoroughly investigate the effect of a silk fibroin scaffold as well as its carbonization product on the electrochemical properties of the composite devices. Compared with pure CNTA-based FSC devices, the mechanical strength as well as hydrophilicity of the CNTA@silk fibroin (CNTA@SF) composites are greatly enhanced. Meanwhile there is neither damage of the aligned structure of CNTA nor sacrifice of the volumetric capacitance of the device. Additionally, further carbonization of the CNTA@SF composites can generate a pyridine-type nitrogen doped CNTA (CNTA@C) hybrid thus further enhancing the electrochemical capacitance while still maintaining the original flexibility and hydrophilicity. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the CNTA@C-based device decreases about 40% (from 3 Ω to 1.8 Ω) and the volumetric specific capacitance increases to about 60% higher (from 126.8 mF cm−3 to 197.4 mF cm−3) compared with the initial. Meanwhile, excellent cyclic stability (2.9 mA cm−3, 10000 cycles with a loss of less than 1%), good rate performance (from 0.58–5.8 mA cm−3, volumetric specific capacitance Cv retention stays at around 80%) as well as high energy density of 0.018 mW h cm−3 (with the power density of 0.46 mW cm−3) were successfully derived. Our approach thus reveals a new kind of robust 3D platform based on a carbon nanotube array and silk fibroin which has great potential for the design of biocompatible FSC devices as well as implantable electronics in the future.
Introduction
Nowadays, the drastically growing energy demand worldwide has had a significant impact on the ecology and economy of the whole world. To solve the energy crisis, abundant research studies have focused on developing more sustainable and green energy conversion processes and energy storage devices.1–3 Therein rechargeable batteries,4 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)5 and electrochemical supercapacitors (ESCs)6,7 are deemed as suitable choices to satisfy these increasing energy transfer demands. Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical supercapacitors, have long cycle lives, high charging–discharging rates and consequently higher power densities. Therefore, it is considered to be an ideal target-substitute for energy storage devices in the future.8,9 With the rapid development of lightweight, flexible and wearable electronic devices in contemporary industries, flexible solid-state supercapacitors (FSCs) are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage components.10 A typical FSC device exhibits excellent electrochemical performances as well as high mechanical integrity upon bending and folding.11,12
In recent years, there have been increasing research studies regarding FSC electrode materials such as aligned carbon nanotube array,13,14 graphene aerogel,15 conductive polymer materials16,17 and so on.18–20 Among these materials, CNTA has attracted wide interest due to its high specific area, shorter ion-diffusion path and regular pore structure.2,14,21 However, CNTA growing by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is too fragile to manipulate due to the weak van der Waals interactions between carbon nanotubes. To overcome this drawback, Futaba et al. used solvent capillary and axial compression methods to improve the mechanical properties by increasing the density of the as grown CNTA.22 However, the CNTA upon capillary driving becomes very hard, thus impeding its further applications for FSCs. Subsequently, Kumar et al. designed a structure containing CNTA decorated with two-dimensional graphene-petals to tune the mechanical behaviours of CNT arrays.23 But this growth of a hierarchical nanostructure is complex. Except for the poor mechanical strength, another obstacle for CNTA is its super-hydrophobicity24 that greatly impedes the penetration of the aqueous electrolyte or a hydrogel solution. Traditional chemical modification methods to improve the hydrophilicity of CNTA will easily destroy the external walls of CNTA and induce the collapse of the whole array structure.
Interestingly, many natural biomaterials were chosen as carbon precursors to produce carbon-based materials, such as pine needles,25 coconut shells,26 bamboo27 and leaves.28 These carbon materials have low-cost production, good electrical conductivity, larger surface area as well as perfect pore structures. Zhu et al. prepared biomass-derived porous activated carbon by KOH and urea owing to excellent capacitance performance.29 Zhu et al. generated N-doped mesoporous carbon nanoparticle materials via thermal treatment and purification.30 Silk is composed of sericin and fibroin from Bombyx mori. Silk fibroin (SF) consists of the amorphous domain structure and the β-sheet crystallite structure. As a natural protein polymer, silk fibroin has received extensive research interest because of its outstanding mechanical performance, biocompatibility and environmental friendliness. On the other hand, silk fibroin, as a nitrogen-rich material, can be used as a precursor to obtain porous nitrogen-doped carbon-based materials via high temperature heat treatment.31 These outstanding properties offer the silk fibroin applications in wearable and implantable electronic devices.32 As a result, silk fibroin is a widely used biomaterial for flexible electronic devices, such as transistors, wearable strain sensors and optoelectronic elements.33,34
Herein we present a new kind of 3D composite structure based on CNTA decorated with silk fibroin for robust FSC devices. After embedding with silk fibroin, the mechanical properties of CNTA@SF composites improve greatly. The hydrophilicity of the CNTA@SF compounds is also enhanced as a result of abundant amino acids in the silk fibroin. Subsequently, the carbonization of SF can generate pyridine-type nitrogen on the backbone and more ordered pore structures due to the skeleton effect of oriented carbon nanotubes, which will greatly benefit the hydrophilicity as well as the capacitive performance of the hybrid. Additionally, the carbonized residues of silk fibroin protein can act as a carbon glue to strengthen the composite structure to maintain the flexibility of the hybrid. This new type of silk fibroin decorated CNTA composite devices provide high flexibility and wettability as well as abundant active sites for rapid charge transfer, large specific capacitance as well as high energy and power density, which are of great importance for the development of new FSC devices.
Experimental
Preparation of CNTA, CNTA@SF and CNTA@C composites
Vertically aligned CNTA with an average height of 500 μm was obtained using the method of chemical vapor deposition (CVD).35 To prepare CNTA@SF composites, firstly, silks (Cooperativa Sociolario, Como, Italy) were degummed in boiling deionized water containing 5% (wt%) Na2CO3 (Sigma, 99%) for 1 hour to remove sericin. After being washed with distilled water 5 times, the degummed silks were dissolved in 9.3 M LiBr (Fluka Chemical, 98%) aqueous solution for 3 h at 65 °C. Subsequently, they were dialyzed by cellulose dialysis membranes (Spectra/Por1, Biotech Cellulose Ester films, MWCO: 3500, Spectrum Laboratories Inc.) for 5 days and centrifuged for 10 min (8000 rpm) to get a settled solution. Then, 10 μL ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (EGDE) was added to slightly crosslink the SF. Finally, CNTA was immersed in silk fibroin aqueous solution for 0.5 h followed by freeze drying to obtain CNTA@SF composites. Carbonization was carried out by heating CNTA@SF composites in a quartz tube at 800 °C (5 °C min−1) for 0.5 h in an Ar atmosphere (300 sccm). The obtained composites were denoted as CNTA@C. The thickness of all samples was about 500 μm. The size of the samples for CNTA and CNTA@SF was 0.9 × 0.9 cm2 (0.04 cm3), but CNTA@C showed slight shrinkage with a size of 0.8 × 0.8 cm2 (0.032 cm3).
Preparation of PVA/H3PO4 hydrogel based FSC devices
Typically, the gel electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 3.0 g poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) in 20 mL deionized water and mixed with 4.5 g of H3PO4 under stirring at 95 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, CNTA, CNTA@SF and CNTA@C composites were soaked in PVA/H3PO4 hydrogel for 0.5 h separately and pasted to the surface of a piece of carbon cloth as an electrode. The final electrochemical capacitor devices were assembled with two similar electrodes separated by a separator film with a polyethylene (PE) film wrapped outside. The final size of the sandwich-like symmetric FSC devices was of 8 mm × 8 mm × 2.7 mm (width × length × thickness) with a total volume of 0.172 cm3.
Instruments and characterization
The structure and morphology of the materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S-4700 scanning electron microscope). Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) tests were carried out by using a TGA/DSC 3+ STAR System (METTLER TOLEDO) from 25 °C to 800 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The Raman spectra measurements were performed to identify the degree of graphitization using a Raman spectrophotometer (HR800, HORIBA Jobin Yvon Company) excited by a laser with a wavelength of 632.8 nm. The Brunner–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement (QUADRASORB SI Automatic specific surface area and porosity analyzer, Quantachrome Instruments Company) was utilized to investigate the specific surface area and pore distribution of electrode materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected using an ESCALAB 250 XI model X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR (Thermo Scientific) spectrophotometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by using a Tecnai G20 (FEI) transmission electron microscope.
Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical experiments were carried out in a standard two-electrode cell with a symmetrical sandwiched structure on a RST5200 workstation at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, AC impedance spectra and a conventional galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) method were used to investigate the electrochemical properties. The CV tests of CNTA@C composite devices were conducted at a scan rate ranging from 20 to 200 mV s−1 over a potential range of 0–0.8 V. The GCD measurements of the devices were tested at a current density of 0.58–5.8 mA cm−3. The AC impedance spectra were measured over a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 0.007 V.
Results and discussion
Vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays were prepared using a conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method as before. Fig. 1(a) shows a representative SEM image of a cross section of as-prepared aligned CNTA with a regular vertically oriented structure. Fig. 1(b) shows the SEM image of 3D silk fibroin scaffold embedded with CNTA (CNTA@SF). The interspaces between the CNTA obviously decrease. Meanwhile, the carbon nanotube arrays retain the initial orientation with some larger pore structures (Fig. 1(e)) appearing on top of the composites compared to the initial pore structures of CNTA (Fig. 1(d)). The inset image of Fig. 1(a) shows the contact angle image of pristine carbon nanotube arrays with a contact angle of 150.3° indicating a super hydrophobic surface. Whereas CNTA@SF composites have excellent hydrophilicity corresponding to a contact angle of about 0° as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b). This is ascribed to the hydrophilic functional groups of silk fibroin. Compared with other modification methods, such as severe oxidation treatments,36 our approach is much safer and more convenient to achieve a hydrophilic CNTA backbone. Fig. 1(c) and (f) show the cross-section and top SEM images of the CNTA@C samples after the carbonization. The inset image shows that the contact angle of CNTA@C composites reaches about 0°. This clearly indicates that the composites still possess hydrophilicity and alignment after carbonization. Fig. 1(g), (h) and (i) show the elemental mapping images of the CNTA, CNTA@SF and CNTA@C samples, respectively. Compared with CNTA composed of pure CNTs, the nitrogen and oxygen signals are rich and uniformly distributed in the obtained CNTA@SF composites and CNTA@C composites.

The schematic illustration of the fabrication of CNTA@SF composites and CNTA@C composites is shown in Fig. 2(a). As shown in the left image in Fig. 2(b), the mechanical strength of the as-prepared CNTA is extremely poor so that it is fragile and easily collapses during assembly. Silk fibroin as a natural fibre has good mechanical properties due to its repeated amino acid sequence that self-assembles into an anti-parallel and highly crystalline β-fold structure.37 The β-fold structure contains two or more protein strands which are stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds between the proximal peptide chains,38 as well as van der Waals interactions between the lamination. As can be seen from the middle image of Fig. 2(b), the CNTA@SF composites can be folded into 180°, and nicely recover to the initial state (Fig. S1(a), ESI†). Such a bending experiment can even be repeated over hundreds of times without destroying the structure of the composites. This confirms that the obtained CNTA@SF compound has excellent flexibility. It is well recognized that silk fibroin scaffolds play a very important role. Interestingly, the CNTA@C samples still have good flexibility after removal of SF, as shown in the right image of Fig. 2(b). Similarly, it can also recover to the initial state (Fig. S1(b), ESI†). This is attributed to the carbonized residues of silk fibroin protein reacting as a carbon glue to strengthen the composite structure and will be confirmed later. In one word, the CNTA@SF and CNTA@C composite structures are robust, flexible and hydrophilic that can maintain the integrity of the electrode materials during complex operation.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyse the major surface elemental information of the composites before and after carbonization. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the XPS spectra show a pronounced C 1s peak at 285 eV, a pronounced O 1s peak at 532 eV and a weak N 1s peak at 402 eV.39 The amplifying N 1s spectra are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The main forms of nitrogen in CNTA@SF composites are pyrrole-type nitrogen (BE = 400.1 ± 0.1 eV) and tetravalent nitrogen (BE = 401.3 ± 0.1 eV) as shown in Fig. 3(b). After high temperature carbonization, the existence forms of some part of nitrogen changed to pyridine-type nitrogen (BE = 398.3 ± 0.1 eV) in the CNTA@C composites (Fig. 3(c)).40 As is known, pyridine-type nitrogen doping to graphitized carbon materials can change the electron distribution inside the carbon material. Thus, it will increase the wettability of the electrode material by the electrolyte and enhance the efficient transfer of electrolyte ions.41 In our case, this is consistent with the observed hydrophilic surface of CNTA@C samples as above (inset of Fig. 1(c)). The doping of N species in the carbon frameworks may induce more electroactive sites and further improve the electrochemical performances.30 As a result, the electrochemical performance of such electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) devices will enhance at the same time.41,42

In order to investigate the impact of the silk fibroin scaffold on the pore structures and specific surface area for the composite materials, we obtained the data regarding specific surface area via the Brunner–Emmett–Teller (BET) method as well as the pore size distribution of samples using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of CNTA, CNTA@SF and CNTA@C samples are displayed individually in Fig. 3(d)–(f). There is a large adsorption of N2-isotherm of CNTA@C samples at P/P0 < 0.7, implying the existence of a large amount of mesopores.43 The main existing pores of CNTA are micropores (pore diameter < 2 nm) and mesopores (2 nm < pore diameter < 50 nm). The inset in Fig. 3(e) shows a sharp peak around 80 nm, implying that the CNTA@SF composites possess more macropores (pore diameter > 50 nm). This confirms the consequence of SEM images of CNTA@SF samples. Meanwhile, the whole scaffold of silk protein shrinks and generates some carbon residues during carbonization, which results in the formation of more micropores and mesopores in the CNTA@C composites (inset of Fig. 3(f)). In short, the pore size distribution of samples could be changed by the carbonization of CNTA@SF. The specific surface area of CNTA@SF samples is calculated to 1.34 m2 g−1, which is much smaller than the bare CNTA (275.7 m2 g−1). The reason for this is due to the occupation of the gaps of carbon nanotubes by SF components. However, when we check the TEM images of the CNTA@SF samples in Fig. S3(a) (ESI†) we do not find any coatings on the CNT surfaces. This indicates that SF forms an interconnected network and does not cover the surface of CNTs nor affect its electrochemical active area. After the CNTA@SF composites were treated by thermal annealing at 800 °C, the carbonic residues from the silk fibroin scaffold appear on the surface of CNTs as shown in Fig. S3(b) (ESI†). As a result, the specific surface area of the CNTA@C composites greatly increased up to 314.4 m2 g−1. The larger surface and more mesopore or micropore size distributions of the CNTA@C hybrid will lead to high-rate performance for supercapacitors and will be discussed later.44
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the thermal degradation of silk proteins takes place at temperatures around 200 °C with the maximum weight-loss occurring around 303 °C. Fig. 4(b) shows the thermal degradation of silk proteins of CNTA@SF composites starting from 150 °C with the maximum weight-loss occurring around 241 °C. The 8.5% weight-loss corresponds to the evaporation of water. The decrease of the thermal decomposition temperature of SF within CNTA@SF composites is beneficial to the carbonization of the compound and confirms that there is no chemical bonding between the CNTA and SF.45Fig. 4(c) shows the FT-IR spectra of the three different hybrids, SF (line 1), CNTA@SF composites (line 2) and CNTA@C composites (line 3). The pure SF shows inherent characteristic peaks of the polypeptides, including amide I (CO stretching vibrations) around 1635 cm−1, amide II (C–N stretching vibrations) around 1521 cm−1 and amide III (N–H deformation vibrations) around 1233 cm−1.46 The CNTA@SF compound (line 2) shows almost the same feature peaks, which indicates that there is no formation of new chemical bonds between CNTs and silk fibroin. This result is consistent with the above TGA results and the TEM image of the CNTA@SF composites shown in Fig. S3(a) (ESI†). After carbonization, the characteristic peaks of amide I and amide II disappear in the CNTA@C composites due to the decomposition of β-sheet crystals. On the other hand, a new peak is observed at 1600 cm−1 as a result of the highly conjugated structure.47 As Fig. 4(d) shows, the D and G bands in the Raman spectra are located at 1350 and 1580 cm−1, respectively. Comparing with CNTA@SF composites, the integral intensity ratio of the G to D bands (i.e., IG/ID) enhances a little, which means that the degree of graphitization level of CNTA@C slightly increased. This indicates that the β-sheet structure of silk fibroin transforms into a stacked poly-aromatic carbon structure.48

Next, we studied the electrochemical properties of the CNTA, CNTA@SF composite and CNTA@C composite based symmetric flexible solid-state supercapacitor devices. The investigation was carried out in a two-electrode system with a sandwich configuration using PVA/H3PO4 as the gel electrolyte. We selected 0–0.8 V as the potential window to prevent the decomposition of water. The distinct comparative analysis about the three types of electrode materials are exhibited in Fig. 5. It can be seen from Fig. 5(a) that all CV curves show good rectangular shapes revealing that these electrode materials have a typical EDLC property. The CNTA@C samples give the highest current response compared with the other two at the same scan rate. This indicates that the CNTA@C samples possess a higher electrochemical performance. As the contribution from carbon cloth is neglected, the special volumetric capacitance (Cv) can be calculated viaeqn (1): Cv = S/(2 × ν × V × ΔU)(1)where Cv is the CV-based volumetric specific capacitance, S is the integral area of the CV curves, ν represents the scan rate, V is the volume of the device (0.172 cm3), and ΔU is the potential range (0.8 V).

(h) Cyclic stability (left) and Coulombic efficiency (right) of the hybrid device during 10000 charge–discharge cycles. (i) Ragone plot of different types of gel/CNTA-based hybrid FSC devices. 
Based on eqn (1), the volumetric specific capacitance (Cv) of the CNTA@SF-based device changed very little compared with the pristine CNTA-based device. While the Cv of the CNTA@C-based device is calculated to be 174.7 mF cm−3, which is about 60% higher than the CNTA-based device (106.5 mF cm−3) and CNTA@SF-based device (100.8 mF cm−3).
GCD measurements were used to test the electrochemical performance of the devices. We chose the same current density (2.9 mA cm−3 and 5.8 mA cm−3) to compare the three different electrode materials in Fig. 5(b). The symmetric charge–discharge features with a nearly linear slope at the same current density confirms the typical EDLC properties of the device. In addition, the CNTA@C-based devices exhibit a longer charge–discharge time indicating a higher GCD capacitance. Due to the pseudocapacitive behaviour of N-doping, the GCD curves of the CNTA@C samples do not exhibit much symmetry.49,50 All the GCD-based capacitance values can be obtained according to eqn (2): Cv = (Iv × Δt)/(V × ΔU)(2)where Cv is the GCD-based volumetric specific capacitance, Iv is the volumetric current density, ΔU is the potential range (0.8 V), Δt is the discharge time and V is the volume of the device.
Based on the same current density (1.16 mA cm−3), the GCD-based Cv of CNTA-based devices is 126.8 mF cm−3, which is close to the CNTA@SF-based devices (122.6 mF cm−3). However, the Cv of the CNTA@C-based devices is measured to be as high as 197.5 mF cm−3 with a growth of about 60% compared with the untreated CNTA-based devices. Due to the increase of electroactive surface area and the generation of pyridine-type nitrogen in CNTA@C, the effect of accumulating charge greatly improved. As a result, volumetric specific capacitance of CNTA@C-based devices increases.

Fig. 5(c) shows AC impedance curves of CNTA-based devices, CNTA@SF-based devices and CNTA@C-based devices. A nearly vertical curve in the lower frequency range manifests well with the excellent capacitance of the devices. In addition, the form of nitrogen transforming to pyridine-type N increases the electron transfer rate. As a result, the diameter of the semicircle of the impedance curves of the CNTA@C sample in the high-frequency region, corresponding to an ion transport resistance, decreases from 3 Ω (pristine) to only 1.8 Ω. This is contributed to the pyridine-type nitrogen via carbonization of carbon nanotube arrays/silk fibroin composites. What's more, compared to CNTA-based devices (10.2 Ω), the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the CNTA@C-based devices was estimated to be about 6.8 Ω through the IR drop. Finally, as shown in Fig. 5(d), the corresponding volumetric capacitances derived from the discharge curves indicate that the CNTA@C-based devices have a better performance of storing energy at the same current density.
Meanwhile, typical CV curves of the CNTA@C-based devices at scan rates from 20 to 200 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 5(e). We can see that the shape of the CV curve still maintains a good rectangular shape at a high scan rate of 200 mV s−1. Furthermore, the Cv of the whole device is calculated to be 193.5 mF cm−3 at 20 mV s−1 and 147.2 mF cm−3 at 200 mV s−1viaeqn (1). The capacitance still has 76% retention as the scan rate increases 10 times. Fig. 5(f) shows the rate-dependent CVs of CNTA@C-based FSC devices. This indicates the good rate performance of the CNTA@C-based FSC devices. As shown in Fig. 5(g), the Cv of the CNTA@C-based devices are 222.4, 197.5, 184.2, 175.3 mF cm−3 at current densities of 0.58, 1.16, 2.9, 5.8 mA cm−3, respectively viaeqn (2). The capacitance retention is around 82% when the current density increased by a factor of 10. This result again confirms the good rate performance of CNTA@C.
The cycling stability is also an important factor for practical applications. Fig. 5(h) shows the cycling stability and coulombic efficiency of all devices. It is very clear that a loss of capacitance in the CNTA@C-based devices is less than 1% after 10000 cycles at a current density of 2.9 mA cm−3. Besides the coulombic efficiency (K = Qdischarge/Qcharge) always remains at 99% during the whole cycle process indicating a good long-life cyclic performance. Similarly, CNTA-based devices and CNTA@SF-based devices also have remarkable cycling stability indicating perfect performance of EDLC. Finally, we calculate the energy density (Ev) and average power density (Pv) of the devices viaeqn (3) and (4), respectively: Ev = (Cv × V2)/2 × 3600(3) Pv = Ev/Δt(4)where Ev represents energy density, Pv is the average power density, Cv is the capacitance of the electrode, V is the working voltage, and Δt is the discharge time of the devices.
Meanwhile, Fig. 5(i) shows the Ragone plots of the different devices. The CNTA-based devices without modification have a special volumetric energy density of 0.011 mW h cm−3 with a power density of 0.46 mW cm−3. Compared with the CNTA-based device, the CNTA@C-based FSC device has the largest energy density of 0.018 mW h cm−3. In addition, the energy density of the CNTA@C-based FSC device is higher than the recently reported multiple-walled carbon nanotube-based SCs (0.008 mW h cm−3, PVA/H2SO4),51 and single-walled carbon nanotube-based SCs (0.01 mW h cm−3, PVA/H3PO4).52 Compared to Ni-ACNTs based SCs (0.1–0.5 μW h cm−2),8 Nitrogen-Doped Core-Sheath CNTA based SCs (2.16 μW h cm−2),53 and vertically aligned carbon nanotubes on graphene-on-Ni current collectors based capacitor (1.0–4.8 μW h cm−2),54 CNTA@C based SCs have a higher energy density (4.9 μW h cm−2). Ev remains at around 83% (0.015 mW h cm−3) even when Pv increases to 4.6 mW cm−3 (ten times higher). This indicates the excellent energy storage properties of the device as a fast charge–discharge supercapacitor.
Conclusion
In conclusion, CNTA was incorporated with a silk fibroin scaffold to improve its hydrophobicity, flexibility as well as mechanical strength. Furthermore, high-temperature carbonization produces pyridine-type nitrogen groups and increases the specific surface area of the scaffold without affecting the hydrophilicity and high mechanical property. As a result, the specific capacitance of CNTA@C-based devices has increased about 62% compared with pristine CNTA-based devices. A total electrochemical capacitance of the CNTA@C-based devices of 222.4 mF cm−3 was obtained at a current density of 0.58 mA cm−3 with excellent stability (a loss of capacity of less than 1% after 10000 charge–discharge cycles). The highest energy density of CNTA@C-based devices can reach 0.018 mW h cm−3. Therefore, we have produced a flexible 3D structure consisting of carbon nanotube arrays embedded with silk fibroin for potential applications of implantable and biocompatible FSC devices in the future.
