1. Introduction
As an important topic in analytical chemistry, ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) are indispensable members of the family of electrochemical sensors with the capability of electrochemically measuring primary ion activity in various sample matrices.1–4 Potentiometric measurement with ISEs is a non-destructive, passive analysis method that converts primary ion activity into electrical potential without the need for additional stimulation. Owing to their intrinsic characteristics of simplicity, low cost, small size, timeliness, and reliability, ISEs have been widely adopted as an option for rapid ion detection in the fields of biomedical, agricultural, environmental, and industrial analyses.5–8
The history of ISEs can be traced back to the beginning of the 20th century, when Cremer noticed that the electrical potential of a thin glass membrane varied with the pH of the solution.9 By the 1960s, the ISEs entered a critical period of development that laid the foundation for modern ISEs. Ever since Pungor pioneered halide-selective electrodes with heterogeneous membranes in 1961,10,11 several breakthrough inventions have ushered a new era in potentiometric analysis, including crystalline membrane ISEs,12 neutral ionophore-based liquid membrane ISEs,13,14 and charged ionophore-based liquid membrane ISEs.15 Besides, plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) was gradually used as the standard matrix of the liquid membrane in this period, which still remains highly relevant today.16–18 Since then, these ISEs based on solid membranes (e.g., glassy membranes and crystalline membranes) or liquid membranes (e.g., polymeric membranes) have attracted extensive research attention and experienced a golden period of development up to now.19–23 Of these, polymeric membrane-based ISEs have gradually come to the fore due to their widest range of accessible ion selectivities. The ISEs based on ionophore-doped polymeric membranes (i.e., ion-selective membranes, ISMs) exhibit outstanding processibility and offer the possibility of detecting nearly one hundred different analytes, from inorganic to organic ions, and even some redox-inert species,24–26 which makes them the most promising and commonly used potentiometric ion sensors.
Conventional polymeric membrane-based ISEs are of liquid-contact type (liquid-contact ISEs) with inner filling solutions,27–33 following the design of early glass membrane electrodes. Although liquid-contact ISEs are relatively mature in routine detection and already commercially available, the presence of solution components limits their further development, as they require additional maintenance and thus are unfavorable for storage and miniaturization.1,34 Eventually, the total elimination of inner filling solutions results in solid-contact ISEs (SC-ISEs). The first SC-ISEs were proposed by Cattrall in 1971, known as coated wire electrodes (CWEs).35 However, it is difficult to achieve stable potential responses using these CWEs with simplified structures due to the ‘blocked’ interfaces between the ionically conducting ISM and electronically conducting substrate,36,37 and they suffer from the formation of oxygen half-cells38,39 and thin water layers.40–42 When the need for well-defined ion-to-electron transduction between two phases with different conductance characteristics was realized, the development of SC-ISEs began to make significant progress.43,44 Here, we present a brief historical timeline of SC-ISEs (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  A brief history of the key events in the development of SC-ISEs. 
Recently, as a new generation of potentiometric ion sensors, SC-ISEs have shown more broader application scope due to their unique advantages. A variety of solid-contact functional materials have been introduced into SC-ISEs as ion-to-electron transducers, especially numerous conductive polymers (CPs)45,46 and nanomaterials,47,48 which has further stimulated the potential of these sensors to achieve robustness and reliability, without the need for calibration and maintenance. Compared to conventional liquid-contact counterparts, polymeric membrane-based ISEs with the solid-contact configuration are easier to design and assemble to achieve miniaturization and flexibility and are compatible with modern printing and microfabrication technologies to produce sensor arrays at low cost and high throughput.34,49–51 Due to their unified production process and quality specifications, miniaturized SC-ISEs are capable of integrating with lab-on-chip devices and other advanced devices.51 In particular, the combination of SC-ISEs with wearable technologies has become a new important trend in this field, with great potential for commercialization.52,53 Besides, different strategies have also been adopted for further improvement of SC-ISEs in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, limit of detection (LOD), biocompatibility, biofouling, etc.54–58 Several excellent review articles on SC-ISEs have been published over the last few years with an emphasis on membrane materials, ionophores, and their applications in different fields.59–66 However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive review article has summarized the far-reaching impact created by various solid-contact functional materials for SC-ISEs.
The significantly improved stability and reproducibility resulting from the use of solid-contact functional materials and a wide variety of miniaturized and flexible structures create new paradigms in the field of potentiometric ion sensors (Fig. 2). Therefore, a timely overview focusing on SC-ISEs is necessary to highlight their advantages and offer insights into strategies for further improvement of their performance and fabrication process for practical applications. In Section 2, we discuss the transduction mechanisms and performance criteria of SC-ISEs, as well as the required conditions for use of functional materials as ion-to-electron transducers. Section 3 covers the latest advances in solid-contact functional materials for SC-ISEs. In this section, the performance of SC-ISEs based on various functional materials is further discussed in detail. In Section 4, recent advances in SC-ISEs toward miniaturization and flexibility are highlighted, including the development of materials and process engineering, as well as the integration and applications of SC-ISEs in different fields. At last, we share our points on the development prospects and challenges for SC-ISEs and hope these discussions will further inspire more research and innovations in this rapidly evolving field.

2. Transduction mechanisms and performance criteria of SC-ISEs
2.1 General principle
Potentiometric measurements are conducted in a two-electrode galvanic cell that converts the input ionic signal to a measurable electronic potential signal under open-circuit conditions.3 The electrical potential difference between the reference electrode (RE) and the working electrode (WE), i.e., the electromotive force (EMF), is usually determined using a voltmeter with high input impedance and low input bias current. This process does not involve redox reaction and requires no external driving force, which means passiveness, low-power consumption, and no consumption or contamination of the sample.67
The potential response of ISEs can be intuitively described according to the phase-boundary potential model, which is based on total equilibrium assumptions.68–70 Ideally, the measured potential originates from charge separation (nanometer dimensions) at the solution|membrane interface, which depends on the primary ion activity. This process is related to the surface chemisorption and equilibrium partitioning of primary ions, without the need for extensive transmembrane material transport.71 In the sample solution, the energy required for charge separation is provided by the chemical driving force (Gibbs free energy). Due to the permselectivity and ion selectivity of the ISMs, the primary ion can freely partition into and out of the membrane phase. When chemical driving forces counterbalance the opposing electrical Coulombic driving forces, the free diffusion of charged ions reaches an electrochemical equilibrium. At this time, an electrical double layer is formed at the solution|membrane interface, resulting in the electrical potential difference. If primary ion activity changes, this equilibrium will be quickly re-established and the phase boundary potential (EPB) at the solution|membrane interface will also change accordingly, which follows the equation shown below:3,72,73 (1)
In this equation, T, F, and R represent the absolute temperature, the Faraday constant, and the universal gas constant, respectively. kI is the ion-partition constant related to the free energy of the primary ion I. zI is the valency of the primary ion I, and if the analyte is an anion, its sign is negative. aI(aq) and aI(org) are the activities of primary ions I in the respective aqueous and organic phases.
The total EMF value is equal to the sum of all boundary potentials within the galvanic cell. Provided that the potentiometric system as a whole is in thermodynamic equilibrium and the electrochemical potential contributions of the remaining phase and interface to the EMF value are constant, within the galvanic cell only EPB at the solution|membrane interface varies. If aI(org) does not depend on the sample and is thus relatively constant, EPB depends only on aI in the aqueous phase, and therefore eqn (1) can be simplified to the well-known Nernst equation for ISEs:7,74 (2)where E0 is the standard potential of EMF (i.e., the intercept of the calibration curve) that can be gained when aI = 1. The constant ion activity in the membrane phase is generally ensured by the lipophilic ionic sites. According to the Nernst equation, a 10-fold primary ion activity change is followed by an increase in the potential response of 59.2/zI mV at room temperature (25 °C). For example, the ideal Nernstian slope for K+-ISEs is 59.2 mV per decade, whereas an EMF change of 1 mV approximately indicates a 4% change in activity.75 In practice, the actual response sensitivity of ISEs always shows a certain deviation from the ideal value and mainly depends on the intrinsic properties of the sensing membrane affected by the optimization conditions, membrane materials, ionophores, etc. For further improving the sensitivity of potentiometric ion sensing, several strategies have been proposed, including coulometric signal transduction,76 a joined electrochemical cell with multi-Nernstian slope,56 electronic integrated multi-electrode systems,77 electronic amplifier circuits,78 and so on.
It is worth noting that ISEs respond only to the free ion activity rather than the complex ion activity, but in most cases it is often justifiable to use molar concentrations instead of the primary ion activity. Besides, when the presence of interfering ions is considered, the Nernst formula for ISEs needs to be further extended to the semiempirical Nikolskii–Eisenman equation, involving the potentiometric selectivity coefficient KpotI,J.79 For the determination of selectivity coefficients, the commonly used methods are the separate solution method (SSM) and the fixed interference method (FIM), which have been described and recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).80–84 The high selectivity of a potentiometric probe is a key factor in ensuring its ability to distinguish between target ions and other interfering ions, which is especially desirable for the detection of ions in complex sample matrixes.25,55 For this pursuit, the synthesis and evaluation of new ionophores is of great importance, and more excellent work is needed in this field to stimulate greater vitality.85,86
The phase-boundary potential model provides a simple semiquantitative description of both liquid-contact and solid-contact ISEs and satisfactorily explains most of the experimental results in an intuitive and simple way, and thus has been widely applicable.74,87 But it is undeniable that this model is too idealistic and ignores many practical factors, such as the diffusion potential within the membrane and transmembrane ion fluxes.20,88,89 When it comes to better clarifying the complex, time-dependent potential behaviour of ISEs, advanced nonequilibrium models are certainly necessary.90–93 However, the existence of fewer restrictive model assumptions is at the price of an inevitable complexity. In a previous work, Bobacka et al. presented a detailed description and comment of the existing theoretical models for ISEs.3
Continuous research on theoretical models can not only help people better understand how ISEs work, but also stimulate innovations in this field. For example, breakthroughs in lowering the LOD of polymeric membrane-based ISEs originate from the detailed kinetic studies of transmembrane ion fluxes,94–99 which has significantly fuelled this field.100–102 These brilliant breakthroughs also further stimulate innovations for improving the LOD of solid-state membrane electrodes.22,23,103 In addition, the realization of the importance of ion fluxes has triggered dynamic electrochemistry for polymeric membrane-based ISEs.104,105 With the continuous in-depth study of the working mechanism of ISEs, alternative readout approaches have emerged, e.g., constant-current chronopotentiometry,106–108 ion transfer voltammetry,109–111 thin layer coulometry,112–114 constant potential coulometry,115–117 optical readout118–123 and wireless high-frequency readout.124 Dynamic electrochemical control techniques for ISEs have aroused great interest and have become a powerful complementary to classical zero-current potentiometry.62,125
2.2 Ion-to-electron transduction
The typical structure of SC-ISEs is a simple sandwich structure, including the conductive substrate at the bottom, the intermediate solid-contact layer, and the sensing membrane at the top, and so sometimes SC-ISEs can also be schematically represented as GC/GR/ISM (GC and GR represent glass carbon and graphene, respectively). In SC-ISEs, the ISM is the recognition element available for selective surface chemisorption of primary ions to quantify their activity and the solid contact (SC), i.e., the ion-to-electron transducer, is an electrochemical signal transducer that converts the input ionic signal to a measurable electrical potential signal. Due to the different inherent conductive properties of membranes and substrates, a well-defined pathway for ion-to-electron transduction is of critical importance to the stability and reproducibility of SC-ISEs. In conventional liquid-contact ISEs, the common combination of an internal Ag/AgCl reference electrode and the inner filling solution containing constant activities of primary ions and Cl− leads to a reversible redox reaction (AgCl(s) + e− ⇄ Ag(s) + Cl−(aq)) to achieve the equilibrium of charge transition from ionic to electronic conductivity. However, in the initial form of SC-ISEs, i.e., CWEs, this transduction process is “blocked” due to the poorly defined interfacial potential between the ISM and the underlying metal conductor, in which ions and electrons are strictly confined to their respective phases. In contrast, the well-defined ion-to-electron transduction processes of SC-ISEs are related to the presence of redox/double-layer capacitance at the ISM|SC interface, which is determined by the inherent characteristics of solid-contact functional materials acting as ion-to-electron transducers.126 These materials can be described as asymmetric capacitors based on redox/double-layer capacitance, allowing charging/discharging over a small but finite measuring current during potentiometric measurements.127,128

2.2.1 Redox capacitance. 
Electroactive materials are a large class of solid-contact functional materials used as ion-to-electron transducers in SC-ISEs, represented by CPs.104 The ion-to-electron transduction process of these functional materials is analogous to conventional liquid-contact ISEs containing internal reference systems, involving the reversible redox reaction Ox + e− ⇄ Red between the oxidizing species (Ox) and reducing species (Red). Fig. 3a shows the ion-to-electron transduction process of redox capacitance-based SC-ISEs. The primary ion I+ can reversibly bind to an ionophore (L) at the ISM|solution interface: I+(aq) + L(m) ⇄ I+L(m), where (aq) is the aqueous phase and (m) represents the membrane phase. The interfacial potential (φa1) is determined by the charge separation at this interface, which is related to primary ion activity. Meanwhile, I+ and lipophilic anionic sites R− can also reversibly transfer across the SC|ISM interface according to their respective ion mobilities, driving the local faradaic process (redox reaction) in the solid-contact layer. Eventually, electrons flow to the conductive substrate, enabling the electrical potential difference to be measured using the equipment. During this process, the interfacial potential (φa2) is controlled by the ion distribution between the transducer phase and membrane phase, whereas the interfacial potential (φa3) determined by the ratio of the Red/Ox of electroactive materials is related to the redox reaction. In CP-based SC-SEs, the redox reaction involves the reversible oxidation/reduction (doping/undoping) of the conjugated polymer backbone with simultaneous insertion/expulsion of anions and cations, which can be briefly expressed as follows:45,129 CP + A− ⇄ CP+A− + e−(3) CPA−I+ ⇄ CP+A− + I+ + e−(4)where CP is the neutral conducting polymer unit, CP+ is the oxidized conductive polymer unit and A− is the anion (e.g., the lipophilic ionic site in the ISM or the doping ion in CPs). The high redox capacitance of CPs relies on the redox buffering capacity that comes from their intrinsic properties of ionic and electronic conductivities, which can be influenced by the doping agents. Furthermore, through the study of the transduction mechanism of poly(3-octylthiophene) (POT), it can be inferred that the ion-to-electron transduction on the CP layer is a surface-confined charge-transfer process that only occurs on its surface, which depends on its surface reactivity and electrical capacitance, not thickness.130 In addition to CPs, other electroactive materials as solid-contact layers can also contribute to redox capacitance, such as ion exchange resins,131–134 redox-active self-assembled monolayers (SAMs),135–138 metallic or organic redox couples,139–143 redox couple-doped gold nanostructures,144,145 and so on.

The cation-selective membrane contains an electrically neutral ionophore (L) and a lipophilic anionic site (R−). I+ is the primary ion. X− is the anion in solution. 


2.2.2 Double-layer capacitance. 
The same effect of stabilizing the interfacial potential can also be improved by applying SCs based on functional materials that have a large contact area with the ISM. In this type of ion-to-electron transduction, the conversion of charge carriers is not based on the redox activity of the functional material, but on the presence of large double-layer capacitance formed at the SC|ISM interface. As shown in Fig. 3b, charge carriers are asymmetrically distributed on both sides of the SC|ISM interface, in which the electrons/holes in the SC side and the anions/cations in the ISM side attract each other to form an electrical double layer. In this situation, the interfacial potential (φb2) is defined as the quantity of the charge in the electrical double layer. In early CWEs, although the asymmetric electrical double layer can also form at the interface between the metal wire and the ISM, the actual capacitance is quite small (only a few µF) due to the absence of effective ion-to-electron transduction. Therefore, the CWE behaves as a polarizable electrode without the ability to buffer any random tiny charge noise.
According to the relationship between the potential drift (dφ) and the accidental charge (dQ), i.e., dφ = C−1dQ, the increase of interfacial capacitance C allows enhanced potential stability.134 The main approach to increase the double-layer capacitance is to maximize the interfacial contact area between the solid-contact layer and the sensing membrane. Therefore, numerous micro/nanomaterials with high surface areas have been tried as ion-to-electron transducers, which will be discussed in detail in the next section. Besides, accompanied by the application of these micro/nanomaterials, the signal transduction mechanism based on double-layer capacitance has been further studied by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, revealing the effects of the surface chemical properties of functional materials, the interfacial contact area, and the chemisorption of charged carriers at the SC|ISM interface on the formation of double-layer capacitance.127,146,147 Ion-to-electron transduction based on double-layer capacitance is a purely capacitive transduction mechanism, in which functional materials do not exhibit redox behaviour. Using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique, the capacitance properties of different functional materials can be well distinguished.146

2.3 Stability and reproducibility of potential response
Whether in routine analysis or in vivo measurements, the stability and reproducibility of potential response is the key to ensure reliable measurement accuracy. In SC-ISEs, stable potential response means as low potential drift as possible, whereas poor potential stability generally indicates the inadequacy of the solid-contact layer. On the other hand, the potential reproducibility of an individual electrode determines its calibration frequency, while the E0 reproducibility between electrodes reflects whether they are directly interchangeable. An adequate solid-contact layer is one of the prerequisites for stable and reproducible potential response, whose role is to provide reversible ion-to-electron conversion and stabilize the phase boundary potential at the SC|ISM interface to maximize the potentiometric performance of SC-ISEs. The ultimate goal of developing a solid-contact layer is to fabricate highly stable, maintenance-free, calibration-free, and interchangeable potentiometric ion sensors.

2.3.1 Potential stability. 
When evaluating a functional material as the solid-contact layer, the most basic criterion is whether it contributes to the stable potential response of SC-ISEs, which requires a well-defined ion-to-electron transduction process. This process represents an asymmetric situation that generates a redox/double-layer capacitance, in which the input current of the measuring amplifier will inevitably result in its charging/discharging. In order to ensure the stable potential response of SC-ISEs, an ideal solid-contact layer should have an unpolarizable interface with sufficient high exchange current density. Although the polarization of electrodes is undesirable in practice, it can sometimes provide valuable information about the properties of the solid-contact layer and the stability of sensors. When considering the presence of an applied current, the low-frequency behaviour of SC-ISEs resembles an RC equivalent circuit in series, and the measured potential (E) can be expressed as follows:148 E = iRt + it/CL(5)where i is the applied current and t is the time of measurement. Rt is the total resistance of the electrode, which mainly depends on the bulk resistance of the ISM. CL represents the low-frequency capacitance of the electrode, which is essentially the redox/double-layer capacitance of the solid-contact layer. According to eqn (5), when the applied current is constant, the slope (ΔE/Δt) of the E–t curve, i.e., potential drift, can be expressed as: Potential drift = ΔE/Δt = i/CL(6)
This equation intuitively shows how CL and the measuring current affect the potential stability of SC-ISEs. Obviously, it can be found that when the measuring current is constant, a sufficiently high redox/double-layer capacitance of the solid-contact layer is a guarantee for protecting the electrode from polarization and achieving a stable potential response. When performing the direct potentiometric measurement under open-circuit conditions, the actual input current of high input impedance millivoltmeters is very small (only pA or less), and the solid-contact layer with large capacitance enables stable potential equilibrium.149 For example, if the expected potential drift of an SC-ISE is less than 1 mV h−1, which is expected to be used for long-term monitoring without frequent calibration, and the measuring current is 1 pA, the minimum theoretical CL required is 36 µF according to eqn (6). However, when a higher order of current is applied, a significant potential drift can be observed due to a certain degree of electrode polarization. Based on this, the influence of the applied current on the potential of SC-ISEs can be further studied by current-reversal chronopotentiometry (CRC) (Fig. 4),128 which is a convenient and quick method to assess electrode stability without performing the long-term test. When SC-ISEs are polarized with a steady-state current (usually 1 nA) for a certain period of time (usually 60 s for both positive and negative current), the Rt and CL of the electrode can be calculated based on the potential drift and the potential jump (ΔE = iRt), respectively. The results obtained from this method show a good correlation with those obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements.150 The CL of SC-ISEs obtained using different functional materials as solid-contact layers can be referred to the statistics in Table 1.
 Fig. 4  Typical chronopotentiograms for the CWE (red line) and the SC-ISE (blue line). When the applied current changes from +1 nA to −1 nA, a significant potential jump can be observed during the galvanostatic polarization process.

The magnitude of CL has become a very important indicator of the potential stability of SC-ISEs. Nevertheless, it cannot be ignored that the potential drift is caused by a variety of factors. From the perspective of the solid-contact layer, except for undesirable polarization, the possible formation of a water layer at the SC|ISM interface and the side reactions with light, redox couples, O2, and CO2 are also adverse factors, which would compromise the stability of the phase boundary potential and even cause the invalidation of the ion-to-electron transducer. On the other hand, as another important component of SC-ISEs, the ISM determines the potentiometric characteristics and lifetime of the sensor.24 Beneficial improvements in ISMs, such as the use of solid ionophores, will lead to a significantly longer lifetime and better sensitivity.28,29,32 However, the changes in the membrane composition can also affect potential stability and analytical performance, which may be caused by the membrane itself (e.g., the leaching and decomposition of its constituents) or by the solid-contact layer.151 For example, it is reported that the interfering ion at the back of the membrane resulting from the solid-contact layer152,153 and the interference of the solid-contact layer with the concentration of primary ions in the membrane can change the potentiometric performance of SC-ISEs.154 In addition, solid-contact functional materials may dissolve and permeate into the ISM, e.g., POT can spontaneously dissolve into the membrane phase,155,156 which may also occur in gold nanoclusters (AuNCs).145 When it comes to potential drift, the requirements should be matched to specific applications, differentiating between short- or long-term stability requirements to select the most appropriate design. Certainly, ensuring optimized manufacturing conditions is a prerequisite necessary to obtain the final sensors with stable performance.157

0 reproducibility. 
Sensor calibration is the most common and necessary pretreatment protocol before the potentiometric measurement to ensure the reproducibility and validity of analytical results. Although the periodic calibration of SC-ISEs with low potential drift is sufficient to meet the analytical requirements in many practical applications, the pursuit of decreasing calibration procedures to achieve calibration-free measurements or at least infrequent single-point calibration has long been the expectation of researchers.158 Complex or frequent calibration is not user-friendly, which usually consumes time, increases costs, and requires the users to have some expertise. Particularly, recently growing interest in disposable and wearable sensors calls for affordable, calibration-free, and easy-to-use devices.52,159–161 SC-ISEs have unique advantages in calibration-free measurements, because they usually have high selectivity for primary ions and their potential response follows the Nernst rule, that is, the slope of the linear range of the calibration curve is very close to the ideal Nernstian slope.162 However, it is still a challenge for SC-ISEs to achieve a high reproducibility of the standard potential E0, which is another key requirement for calibration-free measurements. Unlike the Nernstian slope, the value of standard potential E0 is not a priori known and is difficult to predict theoretically. Generally, the E0 values of SC-ISEs are obtained by extrapolation of the linear range of the calibration curve to 1.0 M primary ion concentration, but even in one batch under exactly the same manufacturing conditions in the laboratory, their values often vary from electrode to electrode. E0 irreproducibility means that each electrode needs to be individually calibrated before use and cannot be directly interchanged, which is also considered as the probable biggest challenge hampering SC-ISEs form being commercialized as disposable or wearable sensors.
In recent years, since the potential stability of SC-ISEs has been significantly improved, increasing attention has been to be paid to the improvement of the E0 reproducibility between electrodes. However, as the group of Bühlmann pointed out, the standard potential E0 of an SC-ISE is determined by the intrinsic characteristics of the entire galvanic cell architecture, including each phase and interface.126 Ensuring small E0 variation requires not only a well-defined SC|ISM interface, but also good control of the rest. Although, for an individual electrode with low potential drift, the constant intercept of the calibration curve over a period of time is relatively easy to achieve, when it comes to the E0 reproducibility between electrodes, the situation will be more complex, in which any differences between each other will be amplified and result in large E0 deviation. Therefore, it makes more sense to test the E0 reproducibility between electrodes than to test the calibration slope reproducibility of electrodes. Ever since this concept emerged, although still in its infancy, the E0 reproducibility of SC-ISEs has been significantly improved through different strategies, e.g., electrochemical control of the solid-contact layer or by exploring new functional materials. Along with increasing potential stability, these efforts to manufacture SC-ISEs with high E0 reproducibility have continuously pushed potentiometric ion sensors towards achieving maintenance-free and calibration-free measurements. What is certain is that an adequate ion-to-electron transducer that can ensure stable phase boundary potential is still a key essential factor.
When CPs are used as solid-contact layers, they can exist in a rather broad range of redox states with different doping levels.274 Nevertheless, this unique property also contributes to the undesirable time-varying electrical potential, accompanied by the unpredictable E0 deviation between electrodes (can reach tens of millivolts). In the electropolymerization process of CPs by galvanostatic,275,276 potentiostatic,277,278 or CV methods,279,280 the redox state of the film can be determined by external control factors. Although the potential of CPs will spontaneously drift toward open-circuit equilibrium after preparation,157 these methods are found to be still useful as pretreatments to enhance potential reproducibility.281 Based on the idea of controlling the position of the calibration slope by adjusting the redox states of CPs, the group of Bobacka proposed an electrochemical control method to tune the standard potential E0 of CP-based SC-ISEs via an external potential or a nanoamp-range current.282 Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) doped with poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate), i.e., PEDOT/PSS, was selected as a model transducer due to its stability in its oxidized (p-doped) state. Since the changes in the redox state and the ionic content in the CP layer require the transfer of ions with the membrane, the composition of the ISM will affect the tunability of the standard potential E0. In addition, they also offered a simple, instrument-free, but relatively time-consuming means to control the standard potential of PEDOT/PSS-based SC-ISEs by a so-called short-circuiting method, which used a metallic wire to connect the SC-ISE and the RE immersed in the primary ion solution of certain concentration.283 During this process, due to the continuous oxidation/reduction of the PEDOT/PSS layer, the potential of the SC-ISE will shift near to that of the RE. However, since the SC-ISEs will spontaneously re-drift toward an equilibrium state, the hold time for the adjusted standard potential is limited.
The potentiostatic prepolarization of the CP layer can bring it in a specific redox state, thereby improving potential reproducibility.284 This process is performed prior to the deposition of the membrane cocktail and thus does not involve ion transfer between the solid-contact layer and the sensing membrane. The group of Lindfors further demonstrated the enhanced effect of prepolarization on the E0 reproducibility of SC-ISEs in the case of polyazulene,285 polypyrrole (PPY),286 and PEDOT as the solid-contact layers.287 Among them, the best E0 reproducibility is obtained with PPY-based SC-ISEs, for which the standard deviation (SD) of E0 is reported to be ±0.7 mV (n = 4) which can maintain a relatively long-term stability of ±3.1 mV after storage in 10−4 M KCl solution for 46 days.286 According to the existing reports about CP-based SC-ISEs, the high E0 reproducibility obtained in this work is the best one. However, the authors also pointed out that this high E0 reproducibility between electrodes was obtained under optimal conditions in the same batch; however, achieving such outstanding reproducibility between batches still remains a challenge. They also prepared a highly hydrophobic solid-contact layer (contact angle 133°) based on tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (TFAB−) anion perfluorinated alkanoate side chain functionalized PEDOT (PEDOTF–TFAB).287 Through the prepolarization of the solid-contact layer, the E0 reproducibility (SD) of the prepared K+-ISEs reached ±3.0 mV (n = 5). Besides, the authors believed that potential irreproducibility mainly comes from ISM deposition or its inhomogeneity, which is determined by comparing the potential reproducibility of the polymer-modified electrodes before and after the deposition of the membrane cocktail. Apart from these abovementioned electrochemical control methods, Joon et al. proposed a simple outer coating method by coating an outer layer of pure silicone rubber (SR) on the top of PVC membrane SC-ISEs to improve their analytical performance and reduce biofouling.288 Through this method, it is found that the E0 reproducibility (SD) of the treated SC-ISEs increases to ±3.5 mV (n = 4) compared to ±35.3 mV for the conventional PEDOT-based counterparts after conditioning in 10−3 M KCl solution for 8 days.
For functional materials with high surface areas, such as carbon micro/nanomaterials, stable phase boundary potential at the SC|ISM interface is generally based on a purely capacitive transduction mechanism. In the case of colloid-imprinted mesoporous carbon (CIMC), it has been shown that the presence of redox-active surface functional groups and impurities can affect the E0 reproducibility between electrodes.172 This seems to be extrapolated to other solid-contact functional materials, because despite the obvious advances in the potential stability of SC-ISEs achieved by the introduction of carbon micro/nanomaterials, there are no examples claiming that SC-ISEs with the use of a single carbon micro/nanomaterial have superior E0 reproducibility. In this regard, the incorporation of other materials into carbon micro/nanomaterials seems to be an attractive approach to better control the interfacial potential between SC|ISM to improve the E0 reproducibility. For instance, for GR-based SC-ISEs, from the statistical data in Table 1, it is observed that SC-ISEs using GR composites are more promising to achieve lower E0 reproducibility. For example, solid-contact Ag+-ISEs with the solid-contact layer of silver tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate-modified GR (GR–AgTFPB) exhibit a low batch-to-batch E0 deviation of 1.26 mV.221 When GR is combined with other functional materials, such as polyaniline (PANI),222 platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs),235,236 tetrathiafulvalene (TTF),253 and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ),258,259 enhanced E0 reproducibility is also observed. Paczosa-Bator used a relatively complex composition containing porous GR, carbon black (CB), and a fluorinated acrylic copolymer as the solid-contact layer for K+-ISEs.226 In the best case, the E0 reproducibility (SD) can be as low as ±0.1 mV (n = 5). It is worth noting that in this study, CB and GR also achieve high E0 reproducibility when used as the solid-contact layer alone. However, it is unclear whether such high reproducibility is also achievable between batches. About the improvement of E0 reproducibility, the development of SC-ISEs based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is similar to that of GR-based SC-ISEs. When cobalt(II) porphyrin/cobalt(III) corrole is introduced into the solid-contact layer, a high E0 reproducibility (SD) of CNT-based SC-ISEs is obtained (±0.7 mV, n = 4).252 Interestingly, the group of Gyurcsányi has recently demonstrated that the initial interelectrode E0 deviation of CNT-based SC-ISEs can be further effectively reduced by means of external polarization or short-circuiting, which also proves that these two methods are effective for SC-ISEs based on the purely capacitive transduction mechanism.289
Among those materials used to form composites with carbon micro/nanomaterials, the most attractive approach to improve E0 reproducibility may be the use of a variety of low molecular weight redox couples, which have a well-controlled concentration ratio of oxidized/reduced species to stabilize the electrical potential of the redox buffer layer that followed the Nernst equation. As one of the components of composite materials, molecular redox couples are also used to dope the plasticized PVC membrane or directly as the solid-contact layer. When these materials are introduced into the SC-ISEs in either way, the E0 reproducibility of these sensors is generally claimed to be close to or less than 1 mV, just like the examples of the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple,140,172,251 cobalt(II) porphyrin/cobalt(III) corrole pair (not a redox couple),152,252 TCNQ,141,256,290 and TTF.143,253,255 More details about the applications of these redox couples or related materials will be discussed in a separate section on molecular redox couples.
For SC-ISEs with other electroactive materials as solid-contact layers, it has been reported that the solid-contact K+-ISEs using a redox buffer layer of monolayer-protected AuNCs have a high E0 reproducibility (SD) of ±0.8 mV.144 Solid-contact K+-ISEs using KBr/AgBr as the solid-contact layer exhibit an E0 reproducibility (SD) of ±1.7 mV.260 In the case of intercalation compounds (ICs) LiFePO4/FePO4 as solid-contact layers, Li+-ISEs can achieve an E0 reproducibility (SD) of ±2.0 mV (n = 3).142 Similarly, when the target ion intercalated Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are used as solid-contact layers, SC-ISEs show a comparable E0 reproducibility to their counterparts with inner filling solutions.264 For these ion-intercalated materials, the stable phase boundary potential is derived from the constant activity of primary ions present in the ISM and transducer phase.
Although the SC|ISM interface is a key factor for the stability and reproducibility of potential response, it cannot be ignored that another interface between the solid-contact layer and the underlying conductive substrate is also important. The selection of conductive substrates can also affect the potential stability and reproducibility of SC-ISEs. In previous works, Bobacka et al. studied the effect of the substrate material on the potential stability and found that SC-ISEs constructed on GC electrodes, compared to Au or Pt electrodes, are not influenced by the partial pressure of oxygen in the solution.291 Mousavi et al. found that the long-term potential stability of SC-ISEs depends on the conductive substrate used to deposit the solid-contact layer, and CNT modified screen-printed electrodes show a better performance than GC electrode-based ones.199 In another study, the group of Lindner compared the equilibration time of SC-ISEs constructed on the GC, Au, or Pt electrodes and noted the differences resulting from the equilibration process at the interface between the substrate electrode and the solid-contact layer.292 It is also found that the selection of different substrate materials can affect the E0 reproducibility of SC-ISEs.140,286,287,293 The group of Bühlmann demonstrated that when redox buffer capacity was sufficient to stabilize the phase boundary potential, the E0 difference caused by different substrate materials can be greatly reduced.140 The group of Lindner also observed a similar effect of reducing differences resulting from the substrate materials by incorporating a redox couple into the solid-contact layer.294 Although, in principle, the phase boundary potential does not depend on the type of conductive substrate used, its intrinsic properties (e.g., electrical conductivity and surface chemistry) and uncontrolled surface redox-active impurities are also significant and therefore cannot be used equivalently. When designing and manufacturing SC-ISEs, it may be necessary to carefully consider the quality of the substrate electrode and ensure thorough cleaning of the electrode surface.

2.4 The invalidation of ion-to-electron transducers

Water layer. 
The key to the development of polymeric membrane-based ISEs from the liquid-contact to solid-contact configuration is the replacement of inner filling solutions with adequate solid-contact functional materials. However, when an undesirable water layer (also known as the aqueous layer) forms at the SC|ISM interface, the ISEs with the solid-contact configuration once again have a liquid component, which is just like the inner filling solution but without any reference elements.41 Far from providing a reversible phase boundary potential, the presence of a continuous water layer between the solid-contact layer and the sensing membrane irreversibly deteriorates the long-term potential stability of SC-ISEs by acting as a reservoir for transmembrane ions and neutral species with changeable compositions.42,295 In this case, the ion-to-electron transducer is considered to have partly failed. As the water layer continues to spread across the interface, the adhesion between the sensing membrane and solid-contact layer will be further destroyed, eventually leading to mechanical failure by delamination.
The phenomenon of water uptake in polymeric membranes has been recognized long ago.296–300 In 2000, Fibbioli et al. further demonstrated the possible presence of a water layer between the sensing membrane and the underlying metal substrate.41 Through theoretical model derivation, Morf et al. demonstrated that the water layer with a small volume would lead to a drastic potential drift of SC-ISEs.301 It is generally believed that the uptake and diffusion of water in the polymeric membrane is the main reason for the formation of a water layer, which has also been well studied by different characterization techniques, such as EIS and Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy.302–307 According to the results of neutron reflectometry, the thickness of a water layer is on the order of just 100 Å.42 The extremely small volume of a water layer means that it is much more sensitive to the changes in the composition and osmolality of the sample solution in comparison to the conventional inner filling solution or a hydrogel with a larger aqueous volume.
In order to eliminate the water layer, one approach is to use alternative membrane matrixes with smaller water diffusion coefficients, such as polyurethane (PU)136 and copolymer methyl methacrylate–decyl methacrylate (MMA–DMA).308 However, in the absence of a hydrophobic solid-contact layer, an undesirable water layer may still be observed even though such polymeric matrixes are water-repellent.309,310 In this situation, transmembrane water tends to pool in the contact defect areas between the polymeric membrane and the underlying metal substrate. On the other hand, with the employment of potassium hexacyanoferrate(II)/(III) (HCF) doped PPY as the solid-contact layer, conventional highly plasticized PVC membrane-based SC-ISEs have successfully avoided the formation of a water layer.311,312 Given all that, it seems that a hydrophobic solid-contact layer in good contact with the sensing membrane is essential to inhibit the formation of a water layer. In this regard, different functional materials with enhanced hydrophobicity have been used as solid-contact layers and have been found to exhibit an excellent effect of suppressing the formation of a water layer.249,287,313 However, it has also been found that certain surface properties of the solid-contact layer increase the likelihood of water layer formation to some extent, such as entrapped salts of CPs,312 residual dispersing agents,314 a high number of edge defects,173 and hydrophilic functional groups147 on the surface of the carbon nanomaterials.
In addition, from the perspective of the fabrication protocol of SC-ISEs, water may already exist during the manufacturing process, such as during the drop-casting of aqueous/organic solution or electrodeposition in aqueous solution.295 Another concern is that, compared to the relatively slow process of water transmembrane transport, in the case of the impaired sealing at the edge of the membrane, water will enter the back side of the membrane from the contact defects and form a continuous water layer more quickly. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the solid-contact layer is thoroughly dried before covering the membrane cocktail and that there is sufficient adhesion strength between the membrane, the solid-contact layer, and the underlying substrate to eliminate any possible unintended water source.
To assess the possible presence of a water layer in polymeric membrane-based SC-ISEs, the commonly used method is the so-called water layer test (Fig. 5a).41,301 Although this method has a simple test protocol, it is relatively time-consuming, usually requiring a dozen hours, and takes a much longer equilibrium time when testing polymeric membranes with low water diffusion coefficients. Moreover, the selection of appropriate interfering ions is important for the water layer test, because highly discriminated ions cannot produce enough ion exchange-induced fluxes. In addition to the method based on transmembrane ion fluxes, the presence of a water layer can also be confirmed by recording the potential drifts of SC-ISEs in the sample solutions with different CO2 levels (Fig. 5b).138,313 The easy transmembrane diffusion of CO2 into the water layer will change its local pH, thereby leading to a chemical hysteresis. This method requires a relatively short test time (even minutes),313 but is generally used for the SC-ISEs with the H+-ISM. Lindner et al. have previously provided a comprehensive description and comment on the approaches to assess the possible presence of a water layer.295 Recently, the same group has re-evaluated the widely used water layer test through both experiments and simulations and proposed some new recommendations, emphasizing the importance of a sufficient electrode preconditioning time and experimental equilibration time.315 Anyway, the removal of a water layer is of critical importance for achieving true SC-ISEs without any aqueous components. The ability to inhibit the formation of a water layer has become an indispensable part of the comprehensive performance evaluation of a new solid-contact functional material.
 Fig. 5  (a) Theoretical potential response curve of the SC-ISEs in the presence of a thin water layer (red line) or in the absence of a thin layer water (blue line) during the water layer test. (b) Schematic illustration of the test for the presence of a water layer based on the transmembrane diffusion of CO2. When a water layer forms at the backside of the H+-ISM, the corresponding changes in the pH value caused by the increase of CO2 concentration in the sample solution will result in a significant negative potential drift. 


External interference. 
In addition to the interference from the formation of a water layer, some external interferences, such as light, CO2, O2, and redox couples, can also interfere with the ion-to-electron transduction process, which requires that the solid-contact functional materials have sufficient capacitance and chemical stability to contend. The light sensitivity of CP-based SC-ISEs is mainly related to the intrinsic photovoltaic properties of CPs, which are also actually photosensitive semiconductors. In general, the influence of light on the potential stability of CP-based SC-ISEs is relatively limited in the absence of strong light exposure. In a previous work, Lindfors has tested and compared the photosensitivity of commonly used CPs in an extreme situation when the solid-contact layer is in direct contact with water and found that POT shows the highest light sensitivity, while PPY shows the best potential stability upon illumination with light of high intensity.284 When functional materials without photovoltaic effects are used as solid-contact layers, the potential response of SC-ISEs is generally unaffected by light.203,228 The gas sensitivity of solid-contact layers to O2 and CO2 is associated with harmful side reactions. The transmembrane diffusion of O2 can affect the phase boundary potential by forming an irreversible oxygen half-cell,168 which can act as an unwanted redox interference to redox-active species in the membrane phase and transducer phase. In CP-based SC-ISEs, the presence of the O2/H2O redox couple316 and O2/CP charge-transfer complexes317 is a possible adverse factor affecting the potential stability. In the presence of dissolved O2 and CO2, PEDOT is proved to be more stable than PPY.318 When a water layer is present in the back of the ISM, it is sensitive to the changes in the CO2 partial pressure. In particular, the interactions of CO2 with surface functional groups of hydrophobic materials may also lead to the gas sensitivity of the SC-ISEs, even in the absence of a water layer. For example, compared to three-dimensionally ordered macroporous carbon (3DOMC),168 CIMC with higher purity and fewer surface functional groups shows better stability in the gas interference test.172 Interestingly, porous carbon sub-micrometer spheres (PC-SMSs) with higher hydrophobicity exhibit a similar potential drift to 3DOMC when exposed to dissolved CO2, which is possibly due to the active functional groups on their surface.165 When considering the redox couples (e.g., Fe2+/Fe3+) in the sample solution, the inert PVC membrane can generally protect the inner redox-sensitive layers from any adverse effects.319 Therefore, from the point of view of avoiding redox interference, the sensing membrane should contain as little redox substance as possible.320 For example, redox sensitivity is observed when POT is used as an additive in the membrane,321 but not when POT is present as a separate layer.322

2.5 Prerequisites for solid-contact functional materials
The need for solid-contact layers in polymeric membrane-based ISEs mainly stems from two aspects, one is to facilitate manufacturing and miniaturization and the other is to optimize the ion-to-electron transduction process. Although the conventional liquid-contact ISEs can be precisely machined to very small sizes, the process requirements are very demanding. In contrast, for SC-ISEs, the desire to achieve miniaturization and flexibility does not seem to be difficult. The elimination of the inner filling solution and inner reference electrode allows SC-ISEs to have more flexible structural designs and simpler production requirements and show compatibility with modern planar processing technologies, which is also one of the reasons why SC-ISEs are now popular.
With the ongoing in-depth discussion and research on these SC-ISEs, the regularity of electrode potential formation and the quality control criteria for stable SC-ISEs have been better understood.3,5,126,295 Several prerequisites should be fully considered before trying new functional materials as solid-contact layers:37 (1) as the ion-to-electron transducer, the most basic function of the solid-contact layer is to provide a sufficiently fast and reversible transition from ion to electron conduction without any parallel side reactions. (2) An ideal solid-contact layer should possess a non-polarizable interface with large redox/double-layer capacitance to protect against the thin current flow applied during potentiometry and have the ability to re-establish the equilibrium in the presence of some external disturbances. (3) A well-defined interface potential between the solid-contact layer and the sensing membrane is the key to ensure potential stability and the E0 reproducibility between electrodes. (4) The chemical stability of solid-contact functional materials is very essential, which is related to their lifetime and the possible side reactions of SC-ISEs with light, gas, and redox species. Sufficient hydrophobicity and low water absorption are conducive to inhibiting the formation of a water layer and preventing the deformation of the solid-contact layer. (5) The implementation of functional materials should be independent of the composition of the sensing membrane and should not lead to uncontrolled impurities on the back side of the ISM that affect the EMF response. (6) From the design and manufacturing perspectives, the functional materials for the solid-contact layer should be readily available, economical, nontoxic, and capable of simplifying sensor fabrication.
3. Solid-contact functional materials used as ion-to-electron transducers
3.1 Conductive polymers
Since the early 1990s, the introduction of a variety of CPs as ion-to-electron transducers for SC-ISEs has made remarkable progress in this field, especially represented by PPY,319 POT,291 PANI,321 and PEDOT.128 These materials can be generally divided into two main types according to their oxidation (p-doping) levels. Among them, PPY, PANI, and PEDOT typically possess relative stability in their highly p-doped states, whereas POT is stable in its undoped form with a low redox capacitance and electronic conductivity. This also implies two different transduction paths: the former is based on high redox capacitance and electronic conductivity, while the latter is mainly ascribed to the formation of an electrical double layer between the POT layer and the ISM.126 These CPs have their own unique properties and are suitable for certain application conditions; however, due to more or less restrictive factors, none of them have been widely accepted as universal solid-contact functional materials yet.
As for highly p-doped CPs, they are generally electroactive over a broad range of potentials with the possible occurrence of parallel side reactions during the process of ion-to-electron transduction, resulting in long-term potential drift. For instance, PANI is known to be a highly pH-sensitive material due to its pH-dependent transition from the electrically conducting emeraldine salt form to the nonconducting emeraldine base form, which is considered to be an adverse factor for the long-term stability of PANI-based SC-ISEs.323,324 Therefore, PANI is relatively less attractive as the solid-contact layer when compared with other CPs. In other cases, PPY is sensitive to certain common reactants (e.g., H+, OH−, and O2),325 and it is demonstrated that the PEDOT-based SC-ISEs are more stable than their PPY-based counterparts when exposed to dissolved O2 and CO2 in the sample solution.318 In addition, these CPs are relatively hydrophilic due to a larger charge density on their polymeric backbone.286 For example, although no continuous water layer is formed between the PEDOT/PSS layer and the sensing membrane, the PEDOT/PSS layer exhibits a hydrogel-like behavior, becoming hydrated and swollen.326,327 Besides, the synthesis methods (i.e., electrical or chemical polymerization) can affect the water solubility of the deposited PEDOT/PSS film. Generally, the electrodeposited PEDOT/PSS film is considered to have a lower water solubility and better adhesion than the solution-cast one. However, the electrosynthesis approach may not be suitable for certain manufacturing technologies, such as large-scale ink printing technology.328 On the other hand, the water solubility of the chemically polymerized PEDOT/PSS film can be decreased by using ionic cross-linkers, which enable the PEDOT-based aqueous inks to possess certain advantages for mass production as the solid-contact layers for SC-ISEs.329,330 In contrast to highly p-doped CPs, POT is more lipophilic and less subject to side reactions. The common approach to prepare the POT solid-contact layer is the drop-cast method to avoid the high charge density on the POT film.308 However, the intrinsically low redox capacitance and electronic conductivity of its commonly used undoped form make the POT solid-contact layer more sensitive to external electrical noise.3 Besides, the application of POT as the ion-to-electron transducer for SC-ISEs is also limited by its light sensitivity303 and spontaneous partition into the membrane phase.156
In order to overcome these known disadvantages of CPs and further improve the performance characteristics of these CP-based SC-ISEs, different strategies have been adopted, including hydrophobic CP derivatives and lipophilic dopants,286,287,313 nanostructured CPs,331–334 nanocomposites containing CPs,200,216,250,273 external electrochemical control or prepolarization,282,286 dynamic electrochemistry protocols,115,125 and so on. Besides, a lot of works have been conducted to further study and optimize different potentiometric ion sensing systems with the use of CP-based SC-ISEs as model potentiometric probes.58,335,336 Some interesting applications of CP-based SC-ISEs have also emerged, such as ion-selective pumps for ionic transport and separation.337,338 Undoubtedly, the application and investigation of CPs as ion-to-electron transducers for SC-ISEs has revealed their current irreplaceable significance. Other application approaches of CPs in potentiometric ion sensors, e.g., as sensing membranes, have also attracted extensive attention.339–341 As an important and huge branch of this field, there have been many excellent review articles related to the development of CP-based SC-ISEs due to their self-evident importance.3,61,150,342–345 If readers want to get a more comprehensive understanding of these CP-based SC-ISEs, these works will be a treasure house.
3.2 Carbon micro/nanomaterials

3.2.1 Spherical carbon micro/nanomaterials. 
Fullerenes (C60) are zero-dimensional hollow spherical carbon molecules with polygonal faces346 and can act as efficient charge-transfer mediators and allow the reversible acceptance of several electrons.347–349 In 2008, Fouskaki et al. fabricated solid-contact K+-ISEs based on C60-modified GC electrodes (Fig. 6a).163 Although pristine C60 is not an electrically conducting material, the facilitation of interfacial charge transfer between the ISM and the underlying GC electrode depends on the redox ability of the C60 electroactive layer to reversibly accept and give electrons, as demonstrated by the EIS measurement. The C60-based SC-ISEs to some extent show a better potential stability than CWEs. With the deepening of research on C60, it is found that a C60 derivative with a two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal plate-like morphology and enhanced electrochemically active surface area can be obtained through introducing multiple pores in pristine C60 crystals, which is termed as bimodal pore C60 (BP-C60).350 In 2015, the group of Qin fabricated a solid-contact Pb2+-ISE by depositing the membrane cocktail onto the BP-C60 layer, which was electrodeposited onto the GC electrode (Fig. 6b).164 The results of the CV test show that the capacitive current of the macro-pore BP-C60 modified GC electrode is higher than that of the electrodes modified with either meso-pore BP-C60 or pristine C60. Besides, the excellent potentiometric performance of the SC-ISEs based on macro-pore BP-C60 also proves it to be an effective ion-to-electron transducer. A low LOD of 5.0 × 10−10 M for Pb2+ is obtained in this study.

In addition to spherical C60, some other spherical carbon materials have also been implemented in SC-ISEs as internal transducer layers. For example, Niu et al. introduced PC-SMSs as ion-to-electron transducers for the fabrication of K+-ISEs (Fig. 6c).165 The PC-SMSs are uniformly porous spherical materials with diameters of about 650 nm, characterized by a large surface area, high electrical conductivity, and hydrophobicity (contact angle 137°). The high capacitance of the PC-SMS film on the GC electrode is demonstrated by EIS and CV tests. Moreover, the SC-ISEs constructed using PC-SMSs possess good resistance to O2 interference and the formation of a water layer. But these SC-ISEs exhibit a certain degree of gas sensitivity when exposed to a high concentration of dissolved CO2. The group of Mao proposed a miniaturized Ca2+-ISE based on shelled hollow carbon nanosphere (SHCN) modified carbon fiber electrodes (CFEs) (Fig. 6d).166 The performances of SC-ISEs with different shell amounts of SHCNs were evaluated, and the SHCNs with three shells were selected to prepare Ca2+-ISEs due to their best potentiometric performance. The final obtained Ca2+-ISE is proved to have good potential stability and interference immunity, and the formation of a water layer is inhibited due to the hydrophobic hollow structure of SHCNs. Jiang et al. fabricated solid-contact K+-ISEs using ordered mesoporous carbon spheres (OMCSs) as ion-to-electron transducers.167 The synthesized OMCSs were firstly dispersed in a mixture of ethanol and Nafion and then dropped onto the surface of the GC electrode to prepare the solid-contact layer. When the carbonization temperature is 750 °C, the optimal performance of OMCS-based SC-ISEs is obtained, including higher potential stability and reproducibility. Besides, flexible OMCS-based SC-ISEs and REs on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates were also fabricated for combination with handheld ion sensing systems.


3.2.2 Porous carbon micro/nanomaterials. 
3DOMC consists of a glassy carbon skeleton surrounding a periodic array of uniform spherical holes connected to each other in three dimensions. The typical pore diameter of 3DOMC is about hundreds of nanometers, while the thickness of the skeleton wall is tens of nanometers. In 2007, the group of Bühlmann utilized 3DOMC fabricated by the colloidal crystal templating method as the solid-contact layer to prepare solid-contact K+-ISEs.168 As an early attempt to use carbon micro/nanomaterials as solid-contact layers, this design method shows great potential. During the long-term potential stability test, the 3DOMC-based SC-ISEs exhibit a low potential drift of 11.7 µV h−1 and are insensitive to the interference from O2, light, and redox couples. However, obvious CO2 sensitivity is observed even in the absence of a water layer. Later, the same group further optimized the design of 3DOMC-based SC-ISEs, resulting in low LODs of 4.0 × 10−11 M and 1.6 × 10−7 M for Ag+ and K+, respectively.169 The ion-to-electron transduction mechanism of the 3DOMC layer has also been investigated, indicating that the large double-layer capacitance comes from the large interfacial contact area between the plasticized PVC membranes and the pores of the 3DOMC (Fig. 7a and b).147 Besides, the experimental results on the influence of the surface chemistry of 3DOMC on the performance of SC-ISEs show that oxidation enables the 3DOMC to possess a higher surface functional group concentration, and therefore the 3DOMC-based SC-ISEs are more likely to form an aqueous layer, causing deterioration in stability and possible delamination of the ISM.147 In addition, the same group also prepared 3DOMC-based SC-ISEs with fluorous sensing membranes for the detection of perfluorocarbon (PFC) surfactants, which showed LODs at the nanomolar level.171 Their excellent performance in the analysis of lake water samples indicates that these SC-ISEs have application potential for simple on site pre-screening of large numbers of samples prior to other conventional analysis methods.

These unique properties of 3DOMC have attracted the researchers' interest for the application of porous carbon micro/nanomaterials in SC-ISEs. In 2014, the group of Bühlmann proposed another porous carbon micro/nanomaterial, i.e., CIMC, as the solid-contact layer of SC-ISEs (Fig. 7c).172 With a similar structure to 3DOMC, however, CIMC has a higher purity, lower redox-active surface functional group content, and larger average pore diameter, thus showing improved performance, e.g., higher specific capacitance. According to the results of CRC measurements, the double-layer capacitance of CIMC-based K+-ISEs is up to 1000 µF. Besides, these SC-ISEs exhibit excellent potentiometric behaviors and long-term stability, reaching a low potential drift of 1.3 µV h−1 within 70 hours. Outstanding potential stability is also observed in the interference and water layer tests. As to the E0 reproducibility between electrodes, when Co2+/Co3+ redox couples are introduced into the ISM as internal reference species, CIMC-based SC-ISEs exhibit a very high reproducibility (SD) of ±0.7 mV (n = 6), compared with 7.3 mV for the counterparts without redox buffers and 32.2 mV for CWEs. In addition, CIMC can also be used as a solid-contact functional material to fabricate solid-contact REs (SC-REs) with low potential drift.351 Combining CIMC-based SC-ISEs and SC-REs, the same group further proposed a paper-based ion sensing platform (Fig. 7d and e).257 This disposable planar device can work without the need for any sensor pretreatments or reference electrolytes, having compatibility with mass-production printing techniques. Remarkably, recent advances in SC-REs also represent an important new trend for the development of REs to find more ideal alternatives to the common single and double liquid junction REs.352,353
In other research studies, Miller and coworkers evaluated the analytical performance of K+-ISEs based on two kinds of ordered porous carbon micro/nanomaterials (Fig. 7f and g).173 One ordered porous carbon micro/nanomaterial is a 3D porous carbon, i.e., the pyrolyzed carbon (PC) produced by interference lithography. The other is a porous GR (PG) analogue, which is converted from the PC after nickel coating and annealing. In this study, the authors found that the stability of PG-based SC-ISEs is worse compared to that of PC-based SC-ISEs, which may be attributed to the higher concentration of edge defects and oxygen functional groups of PG. Based on the integration of a PC-based K+-ISE and a microfluidic chip with a hollow microneedle, an ion-selective transdermal microneedle device was developed for the measurement of physiologically relevant concentrations. Later, the group of Bobacka developed a solid-contact Ag+-ISE using mesoporous carbon as the ion-to-electron transducer and used it to study the dissolution kinetics of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) in water.174 The influence of the morphology of mesoporous carbon (ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) and disordered mesoporous carbon (DOMC)) on the electrochemical performance of the solid-contact layer was investigated by CV and EIS measurements, revealing that the OMC modified GC electrode has better capacitive characteristics than the DOMC modified one. The OMC-based Ag+-ISEs exhibit a stable potential response and an LOD of 1.58 × 10−7 M. In the investigation of the dissolution of AgNPs, these SC-ISEs achieved consistent results with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
Other porous carbon materials (e.g., microporous or nanoporous carbon rods) are used in a method similar to those reported for early porous graphite pellet substrates and are saturated with the membrane components to act as internal contacts that connect with the conductive substrate and the sensing membrane.354,355 The group of Chaniotakis prepared SC-ISEs based on a conductive porous carbon rod impregnated with a plasticized ionophore.356,357 The stable interfacial potential comes from the combination of the Ag wire and the internal Ag/AgCl reference element. These SC-ISEs can be used in a high-pressure environment or for continuous monitoring of remote water systems. They also developed a porous carbon-based Pb2+-ISE with an LOD of up to the picomolar level.358 It is observed that porous carbon contains no surface oxygen groups and has a large BET surface area. In addition, the performance characteristics of solid-contact K+-ISEs with several different structures based on polymeric hydrogels or nanoporous carbon were compared.359 In this study, nanoporous carbon-based SC-ISEs with a symmetric membrane configuration show a better performance than their counterparts with other structures. However, due to the hardness and brittleness of these materials, the size and design of SC-ISEs will be restricted. In another work, Weber and coworkers developed a microporous carbon (μPC)-based K+-ISE for measurements under high-pressure conditions where conventional liquid-contact ISEs failed.175 Prior to bonding with the PVC membrane, μPC is impregnated with the ionophore/additive cocktail to prevent premature sensor aging. The μPC-based K+-ISEs exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to withstand multiple pressurization cycles up to 105 bar, revealing their application potential for in situ deep-ocean analysis.


3.2.3 Carbon nanotubes. 
CNTs are one-dimensional carbon nanomaterials and can be classified into single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) and multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) according to the number of layers of graphitic sheet coaxial tubes.360 Ever since their discovery in the late 20th century,361–363 CNTs have been extensively applied in the field of sensing technology because of their unique chemical, mechanical, optical, and electrical properties.364–367 The first introduction of SWCNTs as the ion-to-electron transducer in SC-ISEs was reported by the group of Rius in 2008,176 and then the implementation of MWCNTs was also demonstrated by the same group.181,182 These CNT-based SC-ISEs exhibit high potential stability and interference immunity due to the large specific surface area and excellent chemical stability of CNTs. The hydrophobicity of CNTs is beneficial to prevent the formation of a water layer at the back side of the ISM. Studies on the transduction mechanism of the SWCNT-based solid-contact layer using EIS and CV techniques have proved that a large double-layer capacitance can form at the interface between the SWCNT film and the electrolyte.127 Cuartero and coworkers further provided direct spectroscopic evidence for capacitive charging of the CNT-based solid-contact layer in SC-ISEs (Fig. 8a).146 These results suggest that the electrical transduction mechanism of CNT-based SC-ISEs is related to the formation of an electrical double layer and the capacitive mechanism induced by the surface adsorption of lipophilic anions onto the MWCNT-based solid-contact layer.

The early successful applications of CNTs in SC-ISEs have sparked significant interest for the development of novel CNT-based SC-ISEs, and to date, CNTs have become one of the most widely studied and applied nanomaterials in SC-ISEs. A lot of SC-ISEs with CNT-based ion-to-electron transducers have been developed for the detection of various target analytes, such as cations (K+,176,177 Na+,368,369 Ca2+,179,191,198 Pb2+,186,187,370–372 Cd2+,196 H+,181 Li+,195 Tl+,184 Ag+,196 and HN4+ (ref. 194)), anions (I−, NO2−, NO3−, CO32−, ClO4−, H2PO4−),178,182,183,185,197 choline and its derivatives,180 urea,373 polyquaterniums,374 pharmaceutical ingredients,188,189,375,376 anionic surfactants,190,377,378etc. Regarding the target analytes of SC-ISEs, reports on anion detection are far fewer than those on cation detection due to the partial difference in the transduction mechanism. In this regard, compared with CP-based SC-ISEs, the implementation of CNTs as the ion-to-electron transducer for SC-ISEs has its unique attractiveness in the detection of anions. The group of Bakker developed a general approach to prepare SC-ISEs for anion detection (Fig. 8b).183 Functionalized lipophilic MWCNTs are proved to be an effective ion-to-electron transducer that does not depend on the charge and nature of primary ions. In contrast, the POT-enabled transducer significantly exhibits a deficient performance, because its surface oxidation caused by the extraction of hydrophilic anions from the membrane may be energetically unfavorable when connected with an anion-selective membrane. Therefore, it is thought that CNT-enabled transducers based on the purely capacitive mechanism possess unique advantages in the field of anion detection and hence can be used as an attractive and general platform for the development of anion-selective sensors. Besides, the same group has recently proposed a direct potentiometric sensing method for the determination of anion concentration instead of activity with the use of MWCNT-based NO3−-ISEs.379 This approach successfully connects the ion concentration to equilibrium-type potentiometric ion sensors, avoiding the calculation of activity coefficients and liquid junction potentials, but not yet applicable to other divalent or multi-charged ions.
With great potential for anion detection, the extensive development of CNT-based SC-ISEs provides a wealth of options for a variety of practical ion detection methods, such as in situ aquatic environmental analysis. Since the solid-contact configuration of potentiometric ion sensors has become a new wave due to their unique advantages (e.g., fast response time, reduced size, insensitivity to light and pressure, and no restrictions on the installation angle),60,380,381 the use of CNTs as the ion-to-electron transducers to develop SC-ISEs for the detection of certain ions in water resources is a fairly attractive option.382–385 For instance, Cuartero et al. developed a submersible device containing the control electronics and a replaceable sensing probe module for in situ seawater potentiometric measurements (Fig. 9).382,383 Two kinds of submersible probes consisting of different CNT-based SC-ISEs are respectively designed to detect chloride and macronutrients, or species related to the carbon cycle in seawater. This submersible device can work properly for 3 weeks with the capability of autonomous operation to obtain rapid and trustworthy information.

In view of the excellent conductivity of CNTs, many studies have used CNT-based inks to impart conductivity to some unconventional substrates, which can significantly simplify the electrode structure of SC-ISEs while further expanding their application fields. The group of Andrade demonstrated that SC-ISEs can be produced using conventional filter paper (Fig. 10a),194 cotton yarns,192 or rubbers193 coated with CNTs. In these cases, CNTs serve as both the ion-to-electron transducer and the conductive substrate. Among them, a relatively attractive and widely used assembly protocol is to develop cost-effective paper-based potentiometric ion sensors with the use of conductive CNT paper prepared through directly printing CNT inks onto a conventional filter paper using a paintbrush.194 After coating with the membrane cocktails, the CNT paper-based SC-ISEs can show a similar analytical performance to their counterparts constructed on CNT-coated GC electrodes. Later, they used the CNT paper to develop Li+-ISEs for the detection of the Li+ level in whole blood and serum samples (Fig. 10b).195 However, despite the high hydrophobicity of CNTs, the CNT paper is found to possess a low water contact angle (∼18°) due to the high porosity of untreated filter paper and possible residual surfactants; while the pretreatment of water rinsing can increase its hydrophobicity, its adversely affects the structure.196,314,343 The poor adherence of conductive paper and the possible accumulation of moisture in the pores are also harmful to the performance of these sensors. To this end, Jaworska et al. proposed an alternative simple assembly procedure to obtain disposable potentiometric ion sensors using a tetrahydrofuran (THF) mixture containing MWCNTs and PVC, thereby avoiding the use of surfactants.386 For increasing the hydrophobicity of CNT paper, the group of Chumbimuni-Torres reported a method to fill the pores of the unrinsed CNTs paper by sputtering a layer of gold and then covering with a layer of POT.196 The treated CNT paper exhibits a high contact angle of 116°. Configurated with MMA–DMA enabled ISMs, these CNT paper-based SC-ISEs show nanomolar LODs for K+, Ag+, and Cd2+. They also used a similar approach to prepare paper-strip SC-ISEs for the determination of K+, Na+, and I− levels in body fluids with the use of POT-coated CNT paper.197

Even with these advances, an urgent problem existing for CNT-based SC-ISEs needs to be addressed, namely the insolubility of CNTs in most kinds of solvents with the tendency to self-associate into micro-scale aggregates.387 Regarding obtaining stable homogeneous dispersions of CNTs, the use of surfactants and the functionalization of CNTs are two commonly used methods. Nevertheless, the possible impact of these dispersion methods on sensor performance is a factor that cannot be ignored. The group of Michalska reported an investigation on the effect of surfactants in CNT aqueous solution on the performance of SC-ISEs.314 Three model dispersing agents were evaluated: anionic surfactants (sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, DBS), cationic surfactants (cetyltrimetylammoniumchloride, CTAC), and polymeric agents (sodium carboxymethylcellulose, SCMC). When using anionic or cationic surfactants as the dispersing agents, several disadvantages are found, e.g., the reduced hydrophobicity of the solid-contact layer, the risk of surfactant partitioning into the membrane, and the property changes of the CNT layer during the washing procedure. These factors will adversely affect the stability, selectivity, LOD, and lifetime of the sensors. Therefore, the authors suggested the employment of SCMC as the optimized CNT dispersing agent to minimize the effects of surfactants. However, it is also found that excessive use of SCMC as the dispersing agent in CNT solution, especially for the preparation of CNT paper, may result in a large amount of interfering Na+ ions at the back side of the ISM, thereby affecting the potentiometric performance of SC-ISEs.152 In other cases, the lipophilic functionalization of CNTs with octadecylamine (ODA) makes them conveniently soluble in organic solvents, which seems to be more popular due to the complete avoidance of surfactants and aqueous solutions.146,177,183,289,384,388 In addition to the issue about the dispersion of CNTs, the purification of CNTs before their further use should also be considered, as CNTs always contain metal oxide catalyst residues and amorphous carbon particles.208 During the purification process using high temperature or strong acid, however, a common but undesirable phenomenon is the increase of pH sensing groups (such as carboxyl groups) on the surfaces of CNTs, which will reduce the anti-interference ability of CNT-based SC-ISEs.
In order to obtain efficient solid-contact layers, efforts have also been made to develop CNT-based nanocomposites for use as ion-to-electron transducers. When other materials are incorporated, the processability of CNTs in solution allows the production of new composite materials that are also attractive options as solid-contact layers due to their possible superior properties. For example, the group of Bobacka found that the combination of carboxylated MWCNTs with PEDOT is beneficial to the redox behavior, as confirmed by CV and EIS characterization.199,389 Liu et al. demonstrated that the incorporation of bimetallic AuCu nanoparticles into MWCNTs (AuCuNPs–MWCNTs) is beneficial for facilitating the charge transfer and increasing the double-layer capacitance.201 The group of Michalska introduced the cobalt(II) porphyrin/cobalt(III) corrole pair onto the surface of MWCNTs (Ph(Co2+)/Cor(Co2+)–MWCNTs) to obtain an improved ion-to-electron transducer.252 The advantages of this type of SC-ISE are high E0 reproducibility (±0.7 mV, n = 4) and low LOD (10−8.3 M for K+). Besides, they synthesized a composite material consisting of MWCNTs and POT (MWCNTs–POT) as the enhanced transducer for SC-ISEs.200 The POT is used as a dispersing agent for MWCNTs and can immobilize on MWCNTs, thereby avoiding the use of surfactants and preventing the spontaneous unwanted partition of POT into the membrane phase. Furthermore, the MWCNTs–POT film shows a higher hydrophobicity, conductivity, and capacitance than the POT film. The SC-ISEs constructed using MWCNTs–POT possess an improved potential stability and the E0 reproducibility between six electrodes in one batch is less than 3 mV.


3.2.4 Carbon nanohorns. 
Single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNHs) have a structure similar to SWCNTs. They are GR-based horn-shaped sheaths and possess fine intrinsic properties, such as high specific surface area and electrical conductivity.390,391 Based on these interesting properties, our group has evaluated the potentiometric performance of SWCNH-based Ca2+-ISEs and REs.202 The electron transfer kinetics were detailedly studied by the EIS measurement, demonstrating the beneficial effects of the SWCNH-based solid-contact layer. Compared with CWEs, the introduction of the SWCNH layer as the ion-to-electron transducer significantly improves the potential stability of SC-ISEs as a result of a larger double-layer capacitance. In addition, the SWCNH-based REs also exhibit good potential stability for common ions with different charges over a wide concentration range.


3.2.5 Graphene. 
Since first exfoliated from graphite in 2004,392 GR has become a superstar in the field of materials science.393–397 As a member of 2D carbon nanomaterials, GR possesses the prominent properties of large surface area, high electron transfer capability, stable chemical properties, and excellent hydrophobicity owing to its unique one-atom-thick sp2-hybridized carbon sheet structure,398,399 which is thus an attractive and promising solid-contact functional material for SC-ISEs. In 2011, our group proposed the use of chemically reduced GR oxide (CRGO) as the ion-to-electron transducer for SC-ISEs.203 The CRGO-based K+-ISEs exhibit satisfactory potentiometric performance, including good long-term potential stability (12.6 µV h−1), fast response (less than 10 s), and excellent interference immunity to O2, CO2, light, and redox couples. The results of EIS characterization show that the presence of the CRGO layer is beneficial for reducing interfacial resistance and accelerating charge transfer. The double-layer capacitance of the CRGO-based K+-ISEs obtained from the CRC measurement is about 78.1 µF. The group of Rius further conducted detailed research on the transduction mechanism of the solid-contact layer, and the results suggest that the CRGO film can act as an asymmetric capacitor.204
The commonly used approach for the preparation of CRGO is based on chemical oxidation and reduction and then using a multi-step drip-coating method to prepare the CRGO-based solid-contact layer.204,206,207 Nevertheless, the chemical redox process of CRGO may involve toxic reducing agents, and the cumbersome modification step for the CRGO layer is obviously not conducive to its practical application. To this end, our group proposed an alternative method for the preparation of the GR-based solid-contact layer to replace the conventional multi-step drop-casting method, which is termed the one-step electrodeposition technique.208 In this way, GR oxide (GO) can be directly reduced on a screen-printed electrode to form an electrochemically reduced GO (ERGO) layer, showing the advantages of efficiency and reproducibility. Using this method, we developed a disposable potentiometric ion strip containing a pair of ERGO-based SC-ISE and RE for the determination of Ca2+ levels in milk and water.400 The analysis results obtained from this device are comparable to the standard atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) method. Another effective method to avoid toxic agents and simplify the assembly procedure is the use of laser-induced GR (LIG) as the solid-contact layer for SC-ISEs. In recent years, LIG has attracted extensive research interest, which can be directly generated on a variety of solid substrates using a one-step laser-assisted processing technique.401,402 With this simple, rapid, and chemical-free fabrication method, Garland and coworkers prepared flexible LIG electrodes on polyimide (PI) films and functionalized these electrodes with NO3−-ISM or NH4+-ISM to measure nitrogen levels in soil slurries (Fig. 11a).210 These LIG-based SC-ISEs exhibit comparable performance to commercial electrodes in the soil slurry recovery test, with a recovery percentage of ∼95%.

In order to simplify the electrode structure of GR-based SC-ISEs, an attractive approach is to utilize the unique properties (e.g., excellent conductivity and the self-assembling feature) of GR to make it both an effective ion-to-electron transducer and a flexible conductive substrate.403,404 Taking the free-standing GR paper (GNP) as an example, this material possesses excellent mechanical robustness, structural uniformity, and good hydrophobicity and electrical conductivity.405,406 Our group reported a flexible planar potentiometric sensing device based on a flexible GNP substrate.211 Three types of GNP-based SC-ISEs were constructed to detect H+, K+, and Ca2+. Combined with GNP-based SC-REs, this device possesses a comparable performance to conventional potentiometric detection systems. The high hydrophobicity (contact angle 103.7°) of GNP ensures that no water layer is formed underneath the sensing membrane. Later, we also reported a GNP-based SC-ISE for the determination of Pb2+ in water samples (Fig. 11b).212 The long-term stability test shows that these Pb2+-ISEs can maintain their initial sensitivity of 98.5% after 15 days of storage.
Apart from the self-assembly strategies, the coating of GR-based inks on some nonconductive substrates to construct SC-ISEs is another promising approach to simplify the electrode structure of GR-based SC-ISEs. For instance, the group of Claussen proposed a manufacturing method for SC-ISEs using the inkjet-printed technique to fabricate GR electrodes (Fig. 11c).213 The GR electrode was processed through a post-print annealing process in a nitrogen ambient environment after being printed on a silicon wafer, which can increase the electrical conductivity of the GR electrode and make its surface more porous. The resulting SC-ISEs can detect K+ in a complex artificial eccrine perspiration solution with good selectivity. However, the need for a high-temperature process complicates their fabrication and limits the choice of electrode substrate. Later, our group reported a flexible all-written potentiometric ion sensor based on a highly conductive GR ink, which does not require thermal treatment after preparation (Fig. 11d).214 A Chinese brush-based writing technique was used to prepare a pair of GR ink-based SC-ISE and SC-RE on a PET substrate. The resulting Cd2+-ISEs exhibit a better analytical performance than their GC-based or graphite ink-based counterparts. In addition, An et al. used a spray technique to construct GR electrodes on a chromatography paper and found that the prepared GR layer appears to be wrinkled with a high surface roughness, ensuring a large contact area with the sensing membrane.215 Based on these GR electrodes, they developed a multichannel wearable potentiometric ion-sensing device for real-time monitoring of multiple ions in sweat.
The increase in the effective contact area between the solid-contact layer and the sensing membrane is a well-known approach to obtain higher double-layer capacitance. In this regard, some GR materials with 3D structures have received attention due to their large specific surface area. The group of Qin utilized a 3D GR sponge (3D GRS) to develop a freestanding solid-contact Cu2+-ISE (Fig. 12a).217 This material possesses a well-defined cross-linked 3D interconnected porous structure that can provide more sites for ion diffusion and adsorption, thereby facilitating ion-to-electron transfer. A large double-layer capacitance of approximately 500 µF is confirmed by the CRC measurement. The obtained 3D GRS-based SC-ISEs exhibit stable potential response with a low LOD (2.5 × 10−9 M). Yoon and coworkers synthesized a 3D CRGO hydrogel with a porous structure and a large surface area through a hydrothermal self-assembly method (Fig. 12b).218 In this 3D structure, the CRGO nanosheets interconnect with each other and appear to be exfoliated and wrinkled, without obvious aggregation. For the preparation of a CRGO hydrogel-based solid-contact layer, a piece of CRGO hydrogel was first sonicated in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and then dropped onto the surface of the Au electrode. Compared with CWEs, the potential drift of CRGO hydrogel-based SC-ISEs is significantly reduced as a result of increased double-layer capacitance. Furthermore, they also fabricated a potentiometric ion sensing device integrated with an Arduino-based printed circuit board (PCB) for wireless detection of K+ levels in various beverages.

Even with these advances, it is worth noting that the residual hydrophilic functional groups after the incomplete reduction of GO may adversely affect the long-term stability of the sensors. For example, the group of Niu applied CRGO nanosheets in K+-ISEs as the solid-contact layer.205 It is found that a large amount of residual carboxylic groups on the CRGO nanosheet surface may reduce the inhibitory effect on the formation of a water layer.407 The group of Michalska reported a comparative study of the performance of carboxylated GR (cGR) and CPs (PEDOT, PANI, and POT) as the solid-contact layers.219 They found that the cGR-based solid-contact layer is similar to the PANI-based one in some respects due to the presence of pH-sensitive surface functional groups. In order to avoid these possible negative effects, Park et al. prepared defect-free GR nanosheets by a fluid-dynamic shear exfoliation process, which are characterized by their high-quality crystalline structure without basal plane defects (Fig. 12c).209 The screen-printing technique was used to fabricate K+-ISEs using the defect-free GR-based solid-contact layer. The obtained SC-ISEs exhibit excellent interference immunity. In addition, some work has reported the use of functionalized GR as the solid-contact layer. For instance, Liu et al. used thiol-functionalized GR (tGR) as the ion-to-electron transducer for SC-ISEs, which can self-assemble at the surface of the Au electrode through covalent linkage to form a stable solid-contact layer (Fig. 12d).220 Two kinds of tGR-based SC-ISEs were developed for the determination of K+ and NO3− in continuous flowing sample solutions, exhibiting good analytical performance over 2 weeks.
Similar to CNTs, GR can also be used to incorporate with other materials to synthesize nanocomposites with enhanced ion-to-electron ability. For example, Sun et al. synthesized a GR–AgTFPB nanocomposite as the ion-to-electron transducer for K+-ISEs (Fig. 12e).221 The doped AgTFPB can fix the phase boundary potential via a reversible redox reaction that occurred at the interface between the solid-contact layer and the underlying Ag electrode, thus improving the E0 reproducibility of SC-ISEs between electrodes. The group of Paczosa-Bator introduced two kinds of redox couples (TTF253 and TCNQ258) into GR-based solid-contact layers to prepare hybrid redox and double-layer capacitance transducers, which are proved to improve the potential stability and reproducibility of SC-ISEs. Boeva and Lindfors used a GR and PANI nanocomposite (GR–PANI) as the ion-to-electron transducer to develop SC-ISEs.222 Configurated with SR-based ISMs, the prepared GR–PANI-based Ca2+-ISEs show a low LOD of 5 × 10−8 M. The E0 reproducibility between electrodes is also improved (±4 mV, n = 3) compared to the PANI-based ones. The group of Qin introduced PtNPs into porous GR (PtNPs–pGR) as the solid-contact layer for SC-ISEs (Fig. 12f).236 The presence of PtNPs on the surface of GR leads to the formation of cross-linking sites and therefore protects GR from irreversible aggregation and restacking, maintaining its advantage of large surface area. This improvement results in a significant increase in double-layer capacitance (625 µF). The prepared Cd2+-ISEs based on PtNPs–pGR exhibit a low LOD of 10−8.8 M with an E0 reproducibility (SD) of ±2.5 mV (n = 3). In addition, some GR-based nanocomposites also exhibit interesting physical properties. For example, the group of Qin proposed a magnetic field-directed self-assembly strategy for preparing the solid-contact layer with the use of Fe3O4–CRGO magnetic powder (Fig. 12g).223 The magnetic powder can be physically adsorbed on the surface of the Au electrode under the magnetic field without any liquid dispersants. The resulting Fe3O4–CRGO magnetic powder-based Ca2+-ISEs show a comparable potentiometric performance to other GR-based counterparts and reliable performance in the detection test of Ca2+ levels in artificial seawater.


3.2.6 Carbon black. 
CB is a very fluffy and fine powder form of amorphous carbon with large surface area, high hydrophobicity, and stable chemical properties.408,409 Paczosa-Bator demonstrated that CB can be used as the ion-to-electron transducer in SC-ISEs.410 These CB-based SC-ISEs exhibit a typical Nernstian response toward K+ and good resistance to gas and light interferences. The same group also investigated the effects of different types of nanosized CBs as solid-contact layers and found that the higher specific surface area and larger particle size of CB are more beneficial for improving the potential stability and reproducibility of SC-ISEs.224 Based on the CB-based solid-contact layer, they also constructed a potentiometric multi-sensor platform by combining different SC-ISEs and a RE in an epoxy resin body for the determination of K+, Na+, Cl−, and NO3− in different water samples.411 With the use of CB ink coated cotton threads, Mousavi et al. proposed a miniaturized SC-ISE array (Fig. 13a).225 Through coating different ISM cocktails on conductive threads, four types of thread-based SC-ISEs were fabricated for the detection of K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl−, respectively. These miniaturized SC-ISEs can be easily bundled together to develop a multiplexed ion-sensing platform, which can perform ion analysis in different complex matrixes with a small sample volume (200 µL). Moreover, by optimizing the CB ink, the miniaturized K+-ISEs are reported to achieve an E0 reproducibility between electrodes of ±2.3 mV (SD).

In addition, CB is usually used as a composite component in different solid-contact functional materials to increase the contact area of the SC|ISM interface and ensure high electronic conductivity, hydrophobicity, and capacitance of the solid-contact layer.133,227,262 For example, the group of Mikhelson evaluated the effects of the component ratio of the solid-contact layer containing C60-enriched CB, a poly(amidoacid) Cu(I) complex, and an electron–ion exchange resin EI-21 on the potentiometric performance of SC-ISEs (Fig. 13b).227 A rather high contact angle of 180° is obtained when the solid-contact layer contains C60-enriched CB. In the best case, the prepared K+-ISEs exhibit excellent long-term potential stability (3.3 mV over 80 days). The group of Paczosa-Bator demonstrated that SC-ISEs based on CB modified with PtNPs possess a better long-term potential stability and reproducibility than the counterparts based on a single component.233,234 They also prepared a solid-contact layer containing the nanocomposites of carbon materials (CB and GR) and a fluoropolymer (FP), which became superhydrophobic (contact angle >150°) after additional thermal treatment (Fig. 13c–e).226 In another study, it was proved that CB mixed with various molecular organic materials (TTF and TCNQ) can be used as effective ion-to-electron transducers for SC-ISEs to facilitate charge transfer and improve potential stability.254

3.3 Metal nanomaterials
In the last decade, the use of metal nanomaterials as the solid-contact layers for SC-ISEs has received increasing attention due to their high conductivity and large surface-to-volume ratio. Except for the commonly-used drop-casting method, metal nanomaterials can also be readily electrodeposited onto conductive metal substrates to prepare the solid-contact layers. Based on these advantages, metal nanomaterials have become promising candidates for use in SC-ISEs as the ion-to-electron transducers.

3.3.1 Gold nanomaterials. 
The introduction of gold nanomaterials with large surface area on the surface of commonly used conductive metal substrates by electrochemical methods has proven to be a simple and effective approach to increase the double-layer capacitance. For example, the group of Qin used a multicyclic electrochemical alloying/dealloying method to directly generate the nanoporous gold (NPAu) film on the surface of the gold wire electrode as the solid-contact layer for SC-ISEs (Fig. 14a).228 Miniaturized NPAu-based K+-ISEs were fabricated by covering the NPAu film with the membrane cocktail. Benefitting from the increased contact area with the sensing membrane, these miniaturized SC-ISEs exhibit a lager double-layer capacitance than the same-sized CWEs, thus leading to improved potential stability. It was also demonstrated that the NPAu film coated electrode was reusable after removing the failed ISM with organic solvents. In addition, there is another simpler method, called the one-step electrodeposition technique, for in situ preparation of a variety of gold nanostructures on conductive metal substrates. For instance, Wang and coworkers used this electrodeposition method to prepare gold nanodendrite (AuND)-based solid-contact layers on the surface of the micro-Au electrode for the fabrication of planar Na+-ISEs (Fig. 14b).229 The real surface area of the AuND layer is calculated by integrating the adsorption charge of the reduction peak of the CV curve. When the surface area is 7.23 cm2, a low potential drift of about 0.04 mV s−1 is obtained. These AuND-based SC-ISEs can maintain a relatively stable and repeatable calibration curve for at least two months. In combination with SC-ISEs and SC-REs, a wearable sweatband sensor platform was built to real-time monitor Na+ levels in sweat during indoor cycling. Hussien and Derar prepared a layer of 3D spongy-like nanoporous gold (sNPAu) film on the surface of the Pt electrode by direct electrochemical deposition and used it to develop an sNPAu-based SC-ISE for the detection of memantine (a pharmaceutical compound) with an LOD of 2.5 × 10−6 M (Fig. 14c).230

Other gold nanomaterials, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and AuNCs, can also be used as ion-to-electron transducers. In 2011, Jaworska and coworkers verified the possibility of AuNPs to be used as ion-to-electron transducers for SC-ISEs.231 Before drop-casting on the surface of the GC electrode, the AuNPs were modified with aliphatic thiols (e.g., octanethiol or butylthiol) to offer enhanced lipophilicity. As a comparison, the long-term stability of AuNP-based SC-ISEs is better than the POT-based ones. Later, the same group utilized dithizone modified AuNPs (AuNPs@Dit) as the solid-contact layer to develop Cu2+-ISEs.154 The AuNPs@Dit-based solid-contact layer can selectively bind to Cu2+ underneath the ISM, thus affecting the ion-fluxes at the SC|ISM interface with the generation of super-Nernstian response. When the solid-contact layer was preloaded with Cu2+ (AuNPs@Dit–Cu) through conditioning in CuSO4 solution, this phenomenon disappeared and a low LOD (3.16 × 10−8 M) was obtained. Following this work, the group of Diamond further investigated the impact of the functional ligands of AuNPs on the performance characteristics of the SC-ISEs.412 Through comparing two different solid-contact layers based on lipoic acid- or lipoic amide-modified AuNPs, they found the adjustability of the potentiometric performance of SC-ISEs with the use of different functionalized AuNPs as solid-contact layers and pointed out the importance of matching the functional ligands to the primary ion.
The use of an anion doped AuNC film as the ion-to-electron transducing layer was proposed by the group of Niu.144 This functional material is a redox couple with equimolar mixed valence, which is prepared by doping arenethiolate monolayer-protected AuNCs with tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate (AuNCs–TB) using a two-phase method. Its well-defined ion exchange function is conducive to the stability of the phase boundary potential at the SC|ISM interface. The AuNCs–TB film also possesses some excellent properties, such as high chemical stability, electrical conductivity, and hydrophobicity. The AuNCs–TB film enabled K+-ISEs to show low potential drift (10.1 ± 0.3 µV h−1 over 72 h) with good interference immunity. Their response characteristics and standard potential E0 are reported to change little during the first 6 weeks. In order to reduce synthesis time and increase yield, the same group used a more efficient synthesis method (namely the one-phase method) to prepare AuNCs@TB and again verified its feasibility as the solid-contact layer for K+-ISEs (Fig. 14d).145 The relationship between performance characteristics and storage time was further studied, and the results show that the LOD is reduced from the original 1.55 × 10−7 M to 1.91 × 10−5 M after one year of storage in KCl solution due to the partial dissolution of AuNCs@TB into the membrane and the leakage of membrane components. In addition, hexanethiolate monolayer-protected AuNCs were used as the ion-to-electron transducers in the PVC matrix of the ISM to prepare K+-ISEs.413 This approach has been proved to improve the potential stability and lifespan without affecting the potentiometric characteristics.


3.3.2 Platinum nanomaterials. 
In 2012, Paczosa-Bator et al. studied the performance of solid-contact K+-ISEs using PtNPs as ion-to-electron transducers (Fig. 15a).232 In view of the large surface-to-volume ratio of PtNPs, these PtNP-based K+-ISEs possess a large double-layer capacitance compared to CWEs, thus exhibiting better potential stability. Interestingly, when PtNPs are used as the solid-contact layer, SC-ISEs do not show significant gas sensitivity compared to the ISEs that use PtNPs as the membrane additive.414 In order to enhance the ion-to-electron transduction ability of PtNP-based solid-contact transducers, PtNPs are commonly hybridized with other functional materials, such as CB233,234 and GR.235,236 For example, Paczosa-Bator et al. demonstrated the use of PtNP modified CB (PtNPs–CB) as the solid-contact layer for SC-ISEs and found that this hybrid transducer can significantly reduce the membrane resistance and improve the potentiometric performance (Fig. 15b).233 These PtNPs–CB nanocomposite-based K+-ISEs and NO3−-ISEs exhibit excellent long-term potential stability (8.2 ± 1.4 µV h−1 and 6.3 ± 1.2 µV h−1 over 172 h, respectively) and high E0 reproducibility between electrodes (±1.4 mV and ±0.2 mV, n = 5, after 72 h of conditioning, respectively).

For the purpose of avoiding the drop-casting step, the electrodeposition technique is always used to prepare Pt nanomaterial-based solid-contact transducers. For example, Taurino et al. electrosynthesized Pt nanopetals or nanospheres on Pt electrodes for the fabrication of SC-ISEs.237 These solid-contact K+-ISEs based on Pt nanopetals or nanospheres exhibit a reduced potential drift and total electrode resistance compared to their counterparts constructed on the bare Pt electrodes. Later, they constructed an acute potentiometric device using Pt nanopetal-based K+-ISEs for monitoring cell death (Fig. 15c).238 Criscuolo et al. fabricated solid-contact Li+-ISEs using Pt nanoflowers as the solid-contact layer (Fig. 15d).239 The large contact area of the SC|ISM interface was observed in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) cross-sectional view. They compared the performances of SC-ISEs based on different solid-contact layers (Pt nanoflowers or Au nanocorals) and conductive substrates (Au or Pt) and found that the combination of the Pt/Pt nanoflowers/Li+-ISM performed the best in terms of potential stability and reproducibility.415 Besides, they also used this method to construct miniaturized Pt nanoflower-based Li+-ISEs which showed a similar potentiometric performance to their macro-counterparts.416


3.3.3 Silver nanomaterials. 
The conventional Ag/AgCl reference system is commonly used and effective for liquid-contact ISEs. For the pursuit of a similar function, the group of Qin utilized AgNPs to develop an inorganic redox buffer of Ag@AgCl/1-tetradecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (TMMCl) as the ion-to-electron transducer for SC-ISEs (Fig. 15e).240 The free Cl− is offered by TMMCl. The prepared solid-contact Ca2+-ISEs are insensitive to O2, CO2, and light and can maintain a relatively stable potential response for one month.

3.4 Metal oxide macro/nanomaterials
About a dozen years ago, SnO2/ITO glass417,418 and AgI–Ag2O–V2O5 glass419 were ever used as ion-to-electron transducers to develop SC-ISEs, but the limited potential reproducibility and the possible formation of a water layer restricted their further applications due to the non-ideal homogeneity of the glass layer. In recent years, due to the continuous emergence of a variety of metal oxide macro/nanomaterials, they have begun to be used as ion-to-electron transducers for SC-ISEs and have shown certain potential as alternatives to carbon and noble metal nanomaterials.
The implementation of metal oxide macro/nanomaterials as solid-contact layers to realize the ion-to-electron transduction function mainly relies on two strategies: high specific surface area and high redox activity. The earlier metal oxide macro/nanomaterials used in SC-ISEs as ion-to-electron transducers are some nanostructured ZnO and CuO materials. Khun and coworkers constructed Sr2+-ISEs based on ZnO nanorods that were synthesized on the gold-coated glass substrate by a hydrothermal growth method (Fig. 16a).241 They also developed ZnO nanotube-based I−-ISEs.242 The hollow structures of ZnO nanotubes can provide a larger surface area than ZnO nanorods. In addition, the CuO nanoflower-based Cd2+-ISEs exhibit a LOD at the nanomolar level (Fig. 16b).243 In other studies, the group of Qin evaluated the feasibility of MoO2 microspheres as ion-to-electron transducers (Fig. 16c), which were synthesized from MoO3 nanobelts and dissolved in the THF solvent.244 Compared to the CWEs, the introduction of MoO2 microspheres improves the performance of SC-ISEs to some extent as a result of the enhanced double-layer capacitance. Yang et al. fabricated solid-contact K+-ISEs based on 2D MnO2 nanosheets for the determination of K+ in the blood (Fig. 16d).245 The MnO2 nanosheets have a wrinkled morphology, thereby preventing their dense accumulation and maintaining the advantage of high surface area, which is advantageous for achieving a large double-layer capacitance. Furthermore, Zhao et al. demonstrated that the incorporation of graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) into a MnO2-based solid-contact layer can enhance the potential stability of SC-ISEs and help to inhibit the formation of a water layer.246

Reproduced with permission.249 Copyright 2019, Elsevier. 
Some metal oxide nanomaterials with excellent redox properties can also be used as ion-to-electron transducers. For example, the group of Paczosa-Bator introduced RuO2 nanoparticles into solid-contact H+- and K+-ISEs as ion-to-electron transducers.247,248 The RuO2 nanoparticles are dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution and drop-cast onto the surface of the GC electrode to prepare the solid-contact layer. Remarkably, these RuO2 nanoparticle-based SC-ISEs exhibit a large redox capacitance at the millifarad level. The same group also prepared a composite material containing RuO2 nanoparticles and POT (RuO2–POT) (Fig. 16e and f).249 This composite exhibits superhydrophobic properties (contact angle 149°). The results of CRC demonstrate that these SC-ISEs possess a rather large capacitance of approximately 3 mF, which is much larger than that of the POT-based ones. Compared to the counterparts based on the single component, RuO2–POT composite-based K+-ISEs exhibit a shorter equilibration time and better potential stability and reproducibility.
3.5 Molecular redox couples
A well-defined redox buffer on the back side of the ISM has long been considered to be an effective approach to improve the potential stability and reproducibility of SC-ISEs. For an adequate redox buffer, its redox potential should be clearly defined and constant, which is also one of the reasons why CPs are not ideal redox buffers. The electric potential (E′) of a redox buffer is determined by the oxidized and reduced species of the redox couple, as predicted by the Nernst equation:136,257,420 (7)where n is the number of electron moles transferred in the redox reaction, E0′ is the standard reduction potential of the redox couple, and aox and ared represent the activities of the oxidized and reduced species of the redox couple, respectively. Ideally, for a redox buffer-based SC-ISE, when the concentration of primary ions in the sample solution is 1 M and thus each phase boundary potential is constant, the EMF of the whole galvanic cell only depends on the E′ of redox buffer.140 Therefore, a well-controlled concentration ratio of the reduced and oxidized species of the redox couple is essential to achieve high E0 reproducibility for this type of SC-ISE. Generally, this concentration ratio is expected to be equal, enabling the interference immunity of the redox buffer towards the redox-active impurities in the system and the polarization effects caused by current during the measurement. Furthermore, these redox couples should possess stable chemical properties with reversible redox activity and rapid ion exchange properties to enable the function of ion-to-electron transfer of the redox buffer-enabled transducer.
The approach of using a redox couple in SC-ISEs can be performed in different ways. The incorporation of a redox couple into the ISM that is directly connected to a conductive substrate can be considered as a simplified idea instead of acting as the solid-contact layer separately,421,422 while the solid-contact layer based on the functional material doped with a redox couple is expected to provide enhanced benefits for ion-to-electron transfer. In earlier studies, considerable efforts have been devoted to using a variety of redox couples to promote charge transfer and stabilize the interfacial potential. For example, lipophilic Ag+ ionophore complexes present in the ISM can stabilize the interface potential via reversible redox reaction with the silver epoxy substrate.423,424 However, in terms of the selectivity of the ISM, this method may not be an appropriate choice when used with other ionophores. Besides, silver tetraphenylborate (AgTPB) was commonly used to construct SC-ISEs.19 In the configuration of Ag/AgTPB/ISM (TPB− as the additive), the phase boundary potential can be well defined. Although the finite lipophilicity and the light sensitivity of this material limit its further application,425 this approach has good heuristic value as an early attempt.144,221,260,295
In recent years, the application of redox couples in SC-ISEs has received great attention due to the possibility of developing calibration-free SC-ISEs with high E0 reproducibility between electrodes. For instance, Zou et al. introduced a tris(phenanthroline) complex of Co(III) and Co(II) ([Co(phen)3]2+/[Co(phen)3]3+) into an ionophore-free PVC membrane and obtained a high E0 reproducibility (SD) of ±0.7 mV (n = 5) for K+-ISEs.140 Nevertheless, this redox-active organometallic complex cannot well maintain the high E0 reproducibility in ionophore-based SC-ISEs, and even if the lipophilicity is improved by using the tris(bipyridyl) complex of Co(III) and Co(II) ([Co(C9,C9-bipy)3]2+/[Co(C9,C9-bipy)3]3+) (Fig. 17a), a significant decrease in E0 reproducibility (±16.3 mV) is still obtained after one day of storage.251 This is because the redox couple composed of reduced and oxidized species is inevitably electrically charged and thus easily leaks into the sample solution as a result of ion exchange with primary ions. In addition, the large redox capacity of the transducer phase in these cases may increase the ion fluxes through the transducer/membrane interface, thereby resulting in a relatively high LOD of this type of SC-ISE. Based on these considerations, the group of Michalska introduced an idea of stabilizing the interfacial potential of SC-ISEs by incorporating the solid-contact layer with electrically neutral compounds, i.e., the cobalt(II) porphyrin/cobalt(III) corrole pair (Fig. 17b).252 This porphyrinoid complex can not only bind to the MWCNT surface via π–π stacking interactions, but also help to control ion fluxes due to the partial release of porphyrinoids into the membrane phase, thus resulting in additional beneficial effects on the analytical parameters (such as a low LOD of 10−8.3 M for K+). It is worth noting that although this compound contains two organometallic complexes of Co(II) and Co(III), they cannot be coupled to each other by an electrochemical means and thus they are not a redox couple. In addition, the Nernst equation is no longer applicable to directly predict the phase boundary potential on the back side of the ISM in this case. Later, the group of Bühlmann further added theoretical and experimental data to better clarify this cobalt(II) porphyrin/cobalt(III) corrole system.426 They provided a detailed theoretical derivation of the relationship between the interfacial potential and two mixed redox-active compounds and predicted that the ratio of pure oxidized/reduced species (not forming a redox couple) in the mixed compounds has little effect on the phase boundary potential, but even very small impurities in these species will lead to dramatic shifts. Combined with the experimental results, it is inferred that the key factor responsible for the remarkable E0 reproducibility may not be the presence of the oxidized and reduced species that do not form a redox couple, but rather the very small redox state impurities. Therefore, the authors suggested that the preparation of solid-contact layers containing both the oxidized and reduced species of a redox couple is still preferred for the development of calibration-free SC-ISEs.

In addition to the above-mentioned cobalt-based materials, TTF/TTF− and TCNQ/TCNQ− redox couples are also promising candidates for use as redox buffers to well control the interfacial potential of SC-ISEs. TTF and TCNQ are well-known conductive organic crystals with high electrical conductivity427 and have also long been used in the field of ion sensing.428–430 Recently, the group of Paczosa-Bator has developed a series of SC-ISEs based on TTF, TCNQ, and their free radical salts (Fig. 17c–e).141,143,256 The TTF-based NO3−-ISEs can achieve an E0 reproducibility (SD) of ±0.5 mV (n = 5),143 while the TCNQ-based Na+-ISEs exhibit an E0 reproducibility of ±1.2 mV (n = 5).141 Furthermore, a significant advantage of TTF and TCNQ is that they can be used to form composites with various carbon-based materials as solid-contact layers for SC-ISEs to obtain enhanced potential stability and reproducibility (Fig. 17f and g).253,254,258,259 In other cases, Xu et al. studied the effects of the morphologies of TTF-based charge-transfer compounds on their use as solid-contact layers (Fig. 17h).255 A shape-controlled Au–TTF hybrid crystal was in situ synthesized in microfluidic devices. Its long-tubular-like microstructure is found to be most suitable for the preparation of SC-ISEs due to its good chemical stability, the co-existence of TTF/TTF−, and its high redox capacitance. The group of Lindner found that although potential stability was significantly improved, the E0 deviation was found to be improved (±6 mV, n = 3) after the incorporation of the TCNQ/TCNQ− redox couple into the POT-based solid-contact layer.294 Therefore, they believed that the introduction of TCNQ salts containing the corresponding primary ions may be a better way to stabilize the interfacial potential. Hu et al. evaluated the performance of a redox buffer containing TCNQ/KTCNQ in CIMC-based Cl−-ISEs.257 A situation similar to the Co(II)/Co(III) redox couple was observed, in which the E0 reproducibility between electrodes significantly decreased after 24 h of conditioning, indicating that the ratio of TCNQ/KTCNQ present in the ISM changed. This situation may be thought of as acceptable for disposable paper-based sensors with short-time measurements.
So far, a variety of functional materials have been used to provide a reversible redox couple at the interface between the sensing membrane and the underlying conductive substrate. Except for the aforementioned types of materials, there are also redox-active SAMs based on C60 or TTF derivatives,135,136 ferrocene,137,138 hydroquinone/quinone,431 KBr/AgBr,260etc. Significant improvements resulting from the use of these functionalized materials for SC-ISEs have been obtained, however, they still need to be more fully convincing to make them more widely acceptable, especially to avoid or address the obvious shortcomings that have been identified. For instance, although redox-active SAMs based on C60 or TTF derivatives have been proved to be effective ion-to-electron transducers for stabilizing the potential response and inhibiting the formation of a water layer,135,136 the inherently low redox capacitance and limited stability are considered to be the limitations for their further applications.48 In another example, ferrocene as an ion-to-electron transducer is not only used in conventional potentiometry,137,138 but also in dynamical electrochemical ion sensing systems.106,432,433 Nonetheless, as further research has found that its oxidized form (i.e., ferrocenium ion) is unstable under certain circumstances,57,434–436 cautious consideration should be given when using ferrocene as the ion-to-electron transducer for SC-ISEs.344
3.6 Intercalation compounds
ICs have both ionic and electronic conductivities because of their unique properties of readily reversible intercalation and ion-exchange reactions, which make them promising for batteries, displays, and sensors.437 Alkali insertion materials have been proved to be suitable for the determination of the corresponding alkali ions, which is governed by the Nernst rule.438–441 However, the direct detection using ICs is susceptible to the interference of ions and redox species in the sample solution. Inspired by the wide range of studies on ICs as the electrode materials for rechargeable batteries, Komaba et al. presented their implementation as solid-contact layers for SC-ISEs.442 They evaluated the performance of lithium, sodium, and potassium insertion materials as ion-to-electron transducers for SC-ISEs and proved the improvements in stabilizing the membrane potential and reducing the interfacial resistance. Schuhmann et al. further studied the electrochemical equilibria and potential distribution of IC-based SC-ISEs.142 They demonstrated that SC-ISEs based on target-ion ICs can yield well-defined and reproducible standard potentials, e.g., the Li+-ISEs using LiFePO4/FePO4 as the solid-contact layer exhibit a high E0 reproducibility between electrodes (±2.0 mV, n = 3) and a high potential stability (SD) of ±1.5 mV (n = 9) measured in 10−1 M LiCl solution on the 42nd day. The reversible (de-)intercalation process of LiFePO4 can occur over a wide range of Li+ concentrations with a very flat potential plateau, which provides benefits for achieving well-defined interfacial potential and high redox capacity with low polarization as the ion-to-electron transducer. Because of the chemical stability and the constant activity of primary ions in the IC-based solid-contact layer, in the ideal case, the membrane potential will only depend on the primary ion activity in the sample solution. A detailed theoretical derivation of potential formation and standard potential E0 has also been provided in this work.142 Following this work, Komaba et al. verified the possibility of using ICs intercalated with other ions as solid-contact layers to develop the corresponding SC-ISEs (Fig. 18).261 Three alkali insertion materials, LiFePO4, Na0.33MnO2, and KxMnO2·nH2O, were used as solid-contact layers for the fabrication of the corresponding SC-ISEs. The efficient stabilization of the membrane potential and the reduced electrode impedance enable these SC-ISEs to possess a fast potential response (<5 s) and improved potentiometric performance. It is also found that the combination of the PVC sensing membrane can protect these IC-based solid-contact layers from interference factors in the analyte solution and improve their sensitivity and selectivity. In addition, Kojima et al. developed a minimally invasive glucose monitoring system composed of an Na+-ISE based on an insertion material (Na0.33MnO2) and an enzyme-based glucose sensor for estimating glucose levels in the blood.443

3.7 Prussian blue and its analogues
Prussian blue (PB), which is known to be the oldest known coordination polymer, has long been used in the field of ion sensing.444–447 PBAs possess the general crystallographic structure, but their chemical composition changes.448 In 2005, Gabrielli et al. tried to used a PB film as the ion-to-electron transducer for K+-ISEs.139 Although these PB-based SC-ISEs do not show an ideal Nernstian potential response, these types of SC-ISEs can be used to study the kinetics at the membrane|solution interface and to clarify the role of the PVC membrane. Later, Ocypa et al. used HCF anion doped PEDOT as the solid-contact layer to construct Cu2+-ISEs.449 They found that the Cu2+ cation can spontaneously accumulate in the solid-contact layer through transmembrane transfer, thus resulting in super-Nernstian behaviors. Besides, the HCF anion was also used as the doping agent in PPY, which was intended to act as a redox buffer to enhance the potential stability of SC-ISEs.311,450,451 Following these earlier studies, the group of Mikhelson studied the possibility of using CuHCF containing Fe2+/Fe3+ as the solid-contact layer for K+-ISEs.262 The authors found that although this material has both ion-exchange and redox properties, the E0 reproducibility between electrodes and long-term potential stability of this type of SC-ISE are far from their liquid-contact counterparts. Ghosh et al. constructed Na+-ISEs based on chitosan and PB (CS–PB) nanocomposites, which combine the double-layer capacitance of chitosan and the redox capacitance of PB.263 The CS–PB-enabled solid-contact layer possesses a high contact interfacial area with the sensing membrane due to its macroporous structure. However, this kind of SC-ISE seems to suffer from the effect of the formation of a water layer.
In addition, PB and PBAs have an attractive feature, i.e., certain size-specific ions can be reversibly embedded into the large interstitial sites inside their face-centered cubic structure.452,453 Based on this unique property, the group of Schuhmann reported the employment of PBAs as solid-contact layers for the development of SC-ISEs (Fig. 19).264 Three K+-intercalated PBAs (K-CuHCF, K-NiHCF, and K-FeHCF), one Na+-intercalated PBA (Na-NiHCF), and one Ca2+-intercalated PBA (Ca-NiHCF) were used as the solid-contact layers for the corresponding K+-, Na+-, and Ca2+-ISEs, respectively. These PBA-based SC-ISEs exhibit a reproducible potential response over a period of months and possess a similar sensitivity and selectivity compared to those of their liquid-contact counterparts. Interestingly, it is found that PBA-based solid-contact layers can show predictable and adjustable standard potentials by altering the properties and redox states of the precursors during the synthesis process of PBAs.

3.8 Ionic liquids
Ionic liquids (ILs) are composed of organic salts that remain in the liquid state below 100 °C, even below ambient temperature, and offer tunable physicochemical properties by modifying the cation and the anion according to the specific requirements of the desired functional materials or solvents.454 Our group synthesized a kind of task-specific IL, called N,N,N-trimethylaniline hexafluorophosphate (NTHP), and employed it as the ion-to-electron transducer for K+-ISEs.265 Because of the presence of the aniline-functionalized cation and hexafluorophosphate anion, this material has both redox and hydrophobic properties. The obtained SC-ISEs exhibit a potential drift of 34 µV h−1 over 20 h and are resistant to environmental interferences. In other studies, the group of Wardak developed chloride IL-based SC-ISEs, which have a two-layer PVC membrane structure.455 The inner layer of the SC-ISEs contains chloride IL doped plasticized PVC and connects with the Ag/AgCl electrode, whereas the outer layer is the commonly used PVC-based ISM. These chloride ILs are used as sources of Cl− to keep constant Cl− concentration in the inner membrane phase, thereby ensuring the potential stability of the internal reference electrode. Based on this structure, a series of SC-ISEs have been developed for the detection of heavy metal ions in real sample solutions.266,267,456,457 When the inner layer contained an IL (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, EMImCl), no significant potential drift was observed during the water layer test, and the long-term potential stability was about 0.1 mV per day.267 However, the possible leaching of ILs from the PVC phase into the sample solution is considered to be an adverse factor for these SC-ISEs.458
Based on the intrinsic properties of ILs (such as hydrophobicity, electrochemical stability, electrical conductivity, and low melting point), their application in SC-ISEs is more than just as the solid-contact layers. For example, the use of IL as an effective binder can enhance the adhesion between the solid-contact layer based on a carbo nanomaterial (SWCNTs or GR) and the GC electrode substrate.459 In addition, room temperature ILs have also been applied as the polymeric membrane compositions, such as ionic additives, plasticizers, and even ionophores.460–466 Low-melting ILs with a melting point above room temperature can be used as a sensing layer matrix alternative to conventional plasticized polymeric membranes for SC-ISEs.467–471 For more details about these applications of ILs in SC-ISEs, refer to several good published review articles (ref. 24, 61, 344 and 472).
3.9 Others
Apart from the aforementioned functional materials, some other materials with high specific surface area or high redox activity can also be used as solid-contact layers for SC-ISEs. For instance, black phosphorus (BP) is a relatively stable one among the three main allotropic forms of phosphorus.473 As a non-carbon and non-metallic material, BP has a high surface-to-volume ratio and charge carrier mobility. Kou et al. estimated the performance characteristics of BP-based Ca2+-ISEs.268 The prepared SC-ISEs exhibit enhanced potential stability with an LOD of 4.0 × 10−7 M. No obvious water layer formation and gas and light interference are observed in this work. The presence of a sensing membrane is thought to enhance the stability of BP and prevent its slow chemical degradation. For further increasing the long-term stability and hydrophobicity of BP, Yang et al. prepared a composite material of ERGO coated BP (BP/ERGO) and used it as the solid-contact layer for the fabrication of BP/ERGO-based Ca2+-ISEs (Fig. 20a).269

In addition, some novel metal-based nanomaterials, such as conductive metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and MXene, due to some unique characteristics, have also been tried as solid contact layers in SC-ISEs. MOFs are crystalline coordination polymers with highly porous structures.474,475 Mendecki and Mirica verified the possibility using of three different MOFs (Ni3HHTP2, Cu3HHTP2, and Co3HHTP2) as ion-to-electron transducers for SC-ISEs (Fig. 20b).270 Among them, Ni3HHTP2 is proved to have the highest bulk capacitance by the EIS measurement and is used to fabricate solid-contact K+-ISEs. The authors also pointed out that the capacitance of SC-ISEs is limited by the instinct porosity and conductivity of the MOFs used, which can still be further improved. Recently, our group has utilized two MXene (Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx) nanosheets to fabricate solid-contact Ca2+-ISEs (Fig. 20c).271 MXene nanosheets possess high specific surface areas, characterized by their high capacitance. These MXene-based SC-ISEs exhibit a higher double-layer capacitance than their counterparts with CRGO-enabled transducers.203
MoS2 nanoflowers are a metal sulfide nanomaterial with a high specific surface area and have been proved to be an effective ion-to-electron transducer for SC-ISEs by the group of Qin (Fig. 20d).272 The prepared MoS2 nanoflower-based K+-ISEs exhibit similar potentiometric characteristics to their MoO2 microsphere-based counterparts.244 The transduction mechanism of the MoS2 nanoflower-enabled transducer is based on the formation of a double-layer capacitance at the SC|ISM interface. In another work, Ali and coworkers presented a miniaturized potentiometric nitrate sensing device containing a pair of SC-ISE and RE for long-term soil analysis (Fig. 20e and f).273 The MoS2 nanosheet doped POT (POT–MoS2) composite material is applied as the ion-to-electron transducer for SC-ISEs. The incorporation of MoS2 into the POT chain is conducive to improving the conductivity and anion exchange ability to obtain enhanced redox capacitance. A high-precision automatic dispenser machine is used to support the assembly of sensors, which can well control the solution distribution of the MoS2–POT composite and sensing membrane. These POT–MoS2-enabled SC-ISEs show a wide detection range, covering all concentrations of NO3− related to agricultural applications, and practical application potential to continuously monitor nitrate in the real samples of soil slurries for up to 27 days.
4. New development trends
The generation of modern ISEs is accompanied by the pursuit of miniaturization, resulting in ion-selective microelectrodes (ISMEs). As a miniature version of the original macro design, ISMEs can be more adequate for some demanding conditions, such as a sample solution with confined volume or measurement in living organisms.34,476 On the other hand, in vivo organ monitoring and integration with miniaturized wearable devices require the flexibility of these microsensors.477,478 Diversified needs are continually driving the development of ISEs toward miniaturization and flexibility. Although conventional liquid-contact ISEs can be scaled down to a low micron size,44 these miniaturized liquid-contact ISEs are rather fragile, complicated, and difficult to standardize and mass produce, limiting their manufacture and applications.295 For SC-ISEs, it is commonly identified that the introduction of solid-contact functional materials is beneficial for their miniaturization and flexibility. The diversity of solid-contact functional materials and substrate selection offer the miniaturized and flexible SC-ISEs more development possibilities. Moreover, their compatibility with modern microfabrication and array construction technologies allows them to be economically produced on a larger scale. On the basis of these advantages, a variety of miniaturized and flexible SC-ISEs have been developed for the detection of ion activities in different matrixes. These microsensors are extremely attractive due to their compact size, less maintenance requirements, and outstanding analysis parameters, showing great potential for completely replacing their liquid-contact counterparts and even their original macro-design. Therefore, the development of miniaturized and flexible SC-ISEs has become an important new development trend in the field of potentiometric ion sensing.
4.1 Miniaturized SC-ISEs
In routine potentiometric analysis, the size of polymeric membrane-based ISEs is usually not limited by the operating environment and the available sample volume. Generally, the conventional ISEs typically have a millimeter-level sensing surface with a pencil-like size. However, when attempting to determine ion activities in a finite sample volume, e.g., a small amount of blood or sweat, or even within a single intact cell, such a large sensor configuration is obviously not desirable. In this context, ISMEs show their particular attractiveness for trace-level analysis in confined samples. Compared with other analytical techniques, potentiometry with ISEs does not consume a large amount of analyte and, in principle, the potential generated is directly related to the primary ion activity in the sample solution, not to the sample volume.104 The growing demands for in vivo measurements and smaller systems of analytical devices are also important motivations for the miniaturization of SC-ISEs.

4.1.1 Design and structure. 
In retrospect, micron-sized ISMEs based on polymeric membranes have long been used for in vivo applications dating back to 1975, when Thomas et al. described a micropipette-based liquid-contact ISME for direct measurement of intracellular Li+ ions in snail neurons.479 These early liquid-contact ISMEs were commonly made of borosilicate glass micropipettes, which were derived from the improvements on one of Walker's methods,480 and have also been widely applied to various areas for ion sensing.481–486 Some summary reviews or books have been published on their development and applications.44,487–491 However, the disadvantages of these micropipette-based ISMEs are just as obvious, such as difficulty in their preparation, high electrical resistance, short life span of only a few hours or days, and vulnerability to mechanical contact or electric shock. Thus, optimizing electrode structure design to increase durability is very critical for the development of ISMEs. One of the most attractive approaches is to introduce internal solid-contact layers to replace conventional inner filling solutions. For typical micropipette-based solid-contact ISMEs (SC-ISMEs), the inner filling solution and internal reference electrode are replaced by functional material modified conductive wires inserted into the membrane cocktail.492 Besides, the introduction of solid-contact functional materials allows ISMEs to be manufactured as other smaller structures, such as the needle-like design shown in Fig. 21a.493,494 The use of the solid-contact configuration also means that there is no need for any optimizations related to inner filling solutions, or for considering the difficulties caused by undesired transmembrane ion fluxes. The advantages of mechanical robustness and durability of SC-ISMEs allow them to be used in a wider range of applications.

Benefiting from the advances in the original macro-design, various SC-ISMEs with higher robustness have been developed. Initially, the main aim of research on SC-ISMEs is to improve the structure of micropipette-based liquid-contact ISMEs. For example, Gyurcsányi et al. firstly tried to fabricate a solid-contact K+-ISME based on a PPY-modified conductive substrate (a metal wire or carbon fiber with different diameters sealed in a glass capillary).495 However, it is difficult to control the specific sensing area on the microfabricated disk electrode substrate through a direct drop-casting method. Therefore, the same group put forward an improved structure design through accommodating both the PEDOT film and the membrane cocktail into a recessed microcavity (25 µm diameter) formed by chemically etching the gold wire sealed in the glass capillary, thereby precisely controlling the area of the sensing surface and mechanically protecting it from the analyte environment.496 Later, Shim and coworkers proposed a similar configuration protocol.497 A glass capillary with a conical nanopore structure (less than 0.5 µm diameter) served as a mechanically robust container for the fabrication of SC-ISMEs, in which the membrane cocktails and hydrogel were distributed onto the Ag/AgCl-deposited Pt nanopore electrode. These improved microelectrodes described above all have small micron-scale sensing areas, but the overall size is still relatively large, and so they are commonly used in flowing systems or as potentiometric scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) probes. In addition, since these SC-ISMEs are still based on glass micropipettes, extra attention should be paid to their fragility when used.
In other cases, the preparation of microelectrodes is no longer dependent on conventional glass micropipettes. The elimination of the inner filling solution allows SC-ISMEs to be prepared without any liquid containers. For example, Lamaka et al. reported a microelectrode configuration protocol similar to the original macro-design of the CWE, in which SC-ISMEs were constructed by sequentially depositing the POT films and ISM cocktails onto the exposed apex of an insulated needle-shaped Pt–Ir alloy wire (Fig. 21a).493 Before depositing the solid-contact layer, a layer of gold was electrodeposited on the exposed apex to ensure stable adherence. Two types of SC-IdSMEs with a less than 10 µm sensing portion length were fabricated for the detection of H+ and Mg2+. These SC-ISMEs are designed to contain neither liquid nor highly fragile components, and thus they are more robust and durable than their conventional glass micropipette-based counterparts. Meanwhile, their reasonably short response time makes them available for local potentiometric SECM measurements in biomedical and corrosion science applications. However, the authors also mentioned that the preparation of such microelectrodes is not always successful due to the possible initial defects in the solid-contact and/or membrane layer. Later, the same group used a plasticizer-free MMA–DMA membrane to further improve their design of a needle-shaped microelectrode.498 Solid-contact H+-ISMEs were constructed and utilized as SECM probes for corrosion monitoring, exhibiting good potentiometric behaviors. Moreover, these SC-ISMEs can be used in SCEM measurements continuously for more than 24 hours and have a lifespan of up to 5 months.
More importantly, the use of solid-contact functional materials is compatible with mass production technology, making them particularly attractive. Different SC-ISMEs have been constructed by using thin-film (e.g., photolithographic) or thick-film (e.g., screen printing) methods to pattern conductive substrates and solid-contact layers, with the use of an automatic microdispenser to dispense the membrane cocktails. For example, Lindner and Buck developed a series of planar SC-ISME array on flexible PI substrates based on existing semiconductor and microelectronics technologies.499–503 As shown in Fig. 21b, these microelectrode arrays were constructed based on poly-HEMA (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogel interlayers and polymeric membranes and could be used for the in vivo detection of H+, Na+, K+, and Ca2+.504 This group also provided detailed discussions about the thin- and thick-film fabrication processes for mass production of SC-ISMEs.34,505
To date, different SC-ISMEs have been developed and applied for potentiometric ion sensing under specific conditions. These miniaturized sensors have been demonstrated to achieve nanomolar LOD in confined samples and possess a lifespan of up to months. The compatibility with modern microfabrication and array construction technologies and the diverse selection of solid-contact functional materials and conductive substrates allow SC-ISMEs to be easily designed and mass-produced, endowing them with a unique appeal. Based on different ionophore-based polymeric membranes, SC-ISMEs with different selectivity can be prepared and integrated. However, as the dimensions of SC-ISMEs further decrease, the precision requirement of micro-machining technology will increase and the uncertainty of their analytical performance will also inevitably increase. Some of the factors that affect the analytical performance of the ISEs are exacerbated in their miniaturized versions, such as the leaching of active components in the membrane, poor membrane adhesion due to a smaller contact area, the formation of a water layer and a pH change resulting from the transmembrane transport of water and gas. Therefore, the key to the design of SC-ISMEs is to take full account of the required analytical parameters and select appropriate configuration protocols to achieve a balance between their size and performance. Various fabrication processes correspond to different standards and product parameters, and researchers should choose the appropriate one according to their specific demands. Moreover, stricter design criteria must be followed to ensure these microsensors can achieve comparable or even better performance characteristics to their original-bulk or liquid-contact counterparts. Anyway, it can be believed that the continuous development of microfabrication technologies provides more choice for the manufacture of SC-ISMEs and makes possible the production of SC-ISMEs with uniform performance in a more convenient and economical manner.


4.1.2 Potentiometric scanning measurement. 
On the basis of these structural and performance studies, SC-ISEMs have now been used in various matrixes to monitor ion concentrations. Among them, an important application scenario for SC-ISMEs is to act as SECM probes. SECM is a scanning probe technology that quantifies the local material flux from a surface with a high spatial and temporal resolution,506 such as studying localized metal corrosion processes or the transmembrane ion flux of liquid-contact ISEs.507,508 The ability to measure a specific ion activity at the solid|liquid interface from the solution side makes ISMEs suitable for use as scanning probes in the potentiometric SECM mode, which is also known as the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET).507 Ever since the applicability of ISMEs for SECM measurements was successfully demonstrated,509,510 a series of efforts have been made in this field to develop more robust and durable potentiometric SECM probes, especially the introduction of a solid-contact layer provides a new choice for configuration protocols.511 Among them, one of the most reported configuration protocols for SC-ISMEs is based on inserting the PEDOT coated carbon fibers into the backfilled polymeric membrane cocktails in the glass micropipette tips. This method has a high success rate in the preparation of microelectrodes based on micropipettes, because there is no need to worry about the air bubbles that may be caused when the internal electrolyte backfilled into the micropipette, and the insertion step of carbon fiber is relatively easy.512 Based on this method, a variety of micropipette-based SC-ISMESs have been developed as SECM probes for the local concentration distribution detection of NH4+,512,513 K+,514 Mg2+,492,515–517 Zn2+,518,519 and Cu2+.520 Due to the introduction of solid-contact layers, these solid-contact micropipette electrodes have a lower electrical resistance and faster response than their conventional liquid-contact counterparts of the same size. As a result, higher scanning rates can be used in the potentiometric SECM mode to obtain higher quality SECM imaging without the need for special electric shielding.521,522 Moreover, they also have lower maintenance requirements and longer service life.
Monitoring metal corrosion using the SIET is a common area, in which SC-ISMEs are used as SECM probes to quantitatively map the local changes in pH and metallic cation concentration during the metal corrosion process. For example, Izquierdo et al. fabricated a micropipette-based Mg2+-ISME for monitoring galvanic corrosion processes in the potentiometric SECM mode.492 Compared with conventional liquid-contact counterparts previously reported,523 these prepared SC-ISMEs improve the SECM images of Mg2+ concentration distribution with a high spatial resolution due to their lower internal resistance and faster response time. Besides, SC-ISMEs can also be combined together or combined with other microelectrodes to form a double- or multi-barrel assembly for simultaneous monitoring of ion distribution.524–526 For example, Filotás et al. constructed a double-barrel microelectrode to simultaneously detect local changes in pH and Zn2+ concentration in the potentiometric SECM mode (Fig. 22a) and extended this structure to obtain 2D maps of Cu2+ and Zn2+ ions by combining a Cu2+-ISME.520 In addition, Ummadi et al. reported a dual-function Ca2+-ISME, which can be used as a potentiometric SECM probe to detect Ca2+ distribution or record the amperometric approach curve to determine the distance between the probe tip and the substrate surface.527 This microelectrode was constructed based on a borosilicate capillary, in which conductive Vulcan carbon powder was used as a component of the PVC membrane cocktail and the Vulcan carbon/bis(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate (DOS) composite was used as to connect the inserted copper wire. Electrochemical characterization demonstrated the good potentiometric behaviors of the Ca2+-ISME, including a near Nernstian response slope of 28 ± 2 mV per decade, a low LOD of 1 µM, and a fast response time of ∼0.2 s. This Ca2+-ISME was used to quantitatively map Ca2+ distribution release from a bioactive glass dental composite.

In addition, SC-ISMEs are also used in another scanning technique called microelectrode ion flux estimation (MIFE), which can be used to non-invasively study the kinetics of transmembrane ion fluxes in organisms.528,529 For instance, Church and coworkers fabricated solid-contact Zn2+-ISMEs to in situ study the transport processes of Zn2+ in the foliage and roots of sour orange seedlings using the non-invasive MIFE technique (Fig. 22b).530 Two configurations of SC-ISMEs were constructed based on a commercially available micropipette (tip size: 540 µm diameter) or a borosilicate glass micropipette (tip size: 40 µm diameter), respectively. The PVC-based Zn2+-ISM was connected with the POT coated gold wires. Electrochemical characterization demonstrated that the prepared POT-based Zn2+-ISMEs with different tip sizes show similar potentiometric response behaviors with the LOD at the micromolar level. The developed Zn2+-ISMEs were used to study the Zn2+ transport processes through monitoring the decrease in ion concentration on the surface of plant tissues as a result of ion uptake by living cells.


4.1.3 Microelectrode array for multiple ion analysis. 
One advantage of microfabrication is that SC-ISMEs with different selectivities can be integrated onto the same planar or three-dimensional miniaturized sensing platform using the same or only slightly modified manufacturing steps. The miniaturized configuration allows these devices to accommodate more sensors in a limited space, enabling a more complete analysis of the target analyte, which is very desirable for certain complex matrixes, such as sweat, blood, and urine. In this context, the group of Diamond proposed a hydrogel-based ISME array device, which can be used to simultaneously monitor Na+ and Cl− in a concentration range related to the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in sweat.531 The microelectrode array was packaged into a flow cell with a volume of 40 µL. The group of Lewenstam described a method to simultaneously perform potentiometric measurements of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl−, and pH of blood electrolytes in a one-drop serum sample.532 The sample droplet (less than 30 µL) can be spontaneously entrapped between the microscope glass cover-slip and the flat front section of the potentiometric probe (with built-in SC-ISMEs and REs) by adhesion forces to avoid evaporation and enable rapid determination.
For multiple ion detection in human biofluids for physiological analysis, an attractive approach is the development of multi-sensor platforms based on flow injection or microfluidics. For example, Toczyłowska-Mamińska et al. constructed a flow-injection platform integrated with an SC-ISME array, aiming to simultaneously determine physiologically important ions (Na+, K+, Cl−, and pH) in the cell monolayer and tissue.533 These SC-ISMEs were prepared on Ag/AgCl electrodes with plasticized PU-based ISMs, coupled with an IL-based RE to perform potentiometric measurements. The successful measurement of ion fluxes in the human colonic epithelial Caco-2 cell line proves the design rationality of this device. Moya and coworkers built a modular sensing platform for simultaneous multi-analyte monitoring in biofluids, which integrated solid-contact Na+- and K+-ISMEs, as well as dissolved oxygen and pH sensors (Fig. 23a).534 As a proof-of-concept, this device was successfully used to assess the real mice urine on different diets, proving its practical potential in complex biological matrixes. Furthermore, its high versatility and low sample volume requirement (0.83 µL) make this device also suitable for different microfluidic cell culture systems to monitor multiple chemicals in real time. Moon and Farzbod proposed a digital electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) droplet-based microfluidic platform with a SC-ISME array (Fig. 23b).535 Attractively, these SC-ISMEs were seamlessly integrated with a digital platform through an on-chip fabrication protocol. With EWOD drop-based microfluidics, the on-chip fabrication process of SC-ISMEs includes chemically oxidizing electroplated silver to form an AgCl layer and depositing the membrane cocktail to prepare the ISM. The advantages of ease of use, automation, and low reagent consumption enable this platform to have the potential for use as a portable home-use ion monitoring device.

In addition, these microelectrode array devices can also be used as auxiliary medical tools for the monitoring of the condition of tissues or organs. For instance, Zine et al. fabricated a needle-shaped PPY-based H+-ISME planar array to monitor organs during cardiac surgery or transplant transportation.536 Tahirbegi and coworkers developed microelectrode array probes for endoscopic surgery to identify the occurrence of ischemia after gastrointestinal anastomosis (Fig. 23c).537 This potentiometric probe was composed of a 12-microelectrode array for simultaneously monitoring pH and K+ in the anastomotic region under ischemia. The conception feasibility was verified by testing inside the stomach of the pig, revealing that this device has a certain tolerance to acidic conditions. Besides, the introduction of PEDOT has been proved to further improve the analytical performance of these microelectrodes.538 The group of Yang proposed a point-of-care diagnostic platform for the assessment of tissue ischemia, which can be used to measure K+, Na+, and pH in different liquid samples (Fig. 23d).539 The realization of different SC-ISMEs is based on the standardized PCB manufacturing technique, which is a promising approach to produce low-cost, mass-produced, multi-parametric chemical sensing diagnostic platforms. Two rigid sensing platforms with 34-microelectrode arrays were developed to perform in vitro liquid sample dip-stick analysis. Furthermore, flexible sensing platforms have also been extended, which are intended to be wrapped as a ring and placed within the intestinal lumen to assess tissue ischemia after surgical anastomosis.
Another important application field of microelectrode arrays is the establishment of a lab-on-a-chip platform for monitoring cell culture. For example, Guenat and coworkers presented a sophisticated SC-ISME array platform aimed at in vitro intracellular recording (Fig. 23e).540 The entire device platform is mounted on a PCB, including a glass chip with microchannels and a silicon chip with a 24-microelectrode array. The SC-ISMEs were constructed by filling the silicon nitride micropipettes (5 µm inner diameter) with the membrane cocktails. The micropipette geometry provides reproducible and clearly defined membrane thickness and effective sensing area with good mechanical anchorage. These microsensors can operate in the range of 10−6–10−1 M Ca2+ with a slope of 27 mV per decade. Through the improvement of micromachining technology, the inner diameter of the micropipette can be further down to 250 nm.541 Based on micropipette-based SC-ISMEs, the same group also developed a generic platform for cell culture that enabled real-time monitoring of extracellular ion activities to reflect cell states (e.g., necrosis, apoptosis, or differentiation) (Fig. 23f).542,543 Two kinds of micropipette-based SC-ISMEs were manufactured and installed at the bottom of the microwell for cultured cells to determine the levels of K+ and NH4+ in cell cultures. Besides, this platform was also used to study the early signs of induced cell lysis for cytotoxicity assays, by using extracellular K+ as a marker of cell death.544 Inspired by Guenat's work, the group of Porterfield designed a lab-on-chip system, which is expected to perform fern spore Ca2+ measurements in ground studies or microgravity flight experiments (Fig. 23g).545 This biochip was microfabricated on a silicon substrate, consisting of a 64-microelectrode array leading into 16 pyramidal pores (150 µm × 150 µm) that were specially designed according to the general size of the target cell and acted as measurement units in themselves. Coupled with specific data acquisition and processing technology, the application potential of this biochip as an essential tool for basic cell biology research was preliminarily demonstrated by measuring Ca2+ released from germinated fern spores. The same group also developed a coin-sized multianalyte biochip for physiological sensing in a liquid environment.546 They found that the introduction of PEDOT as the ion-to-electron transducer can improve the analytical performance and lifespan of these SC-ISMEs in this biochip.


4.1.4 
            In situ water environment analysis. 
SC-ISMEs are attractive, small, and convenient analytical tools for in situ determination of various ions in a volume-limited aqueous sample without the need for sample pretreatment. Their high sensitivity and selectivity, as well as their ability to achieve an LOD at the nanomolar level, make them more competitive in water environment analysis than other sophisticated analytical tools.547,548 For example, the determination of heavy metal ions in coastal sediment pore water is of great importance to elucidate their impacts on water quality and the biogeochemical environment. When using SC-ISMEs to fine-scale measure heavy metal ions in sediment pore water, they can avoid perturbing their vertical distribution profiles. For example, Zhao and coworkers developed an SC-ISME and successfully applied it for in situ determination of Pb2+ in coastal sediment pore water.549 This type of SC-ISME was constructed by sequentially depositing the PEDOT/PSS-based solid-contact layer and the membrane cocktail on a gold wire (14 µm diameter) sealed in a glass capillary with an exposed tip. Due to this design, these SC-ISMEs are more robust than conventional liquid-contact counterparts and therefore more suitable for in situ pore water measurements. Remarkably, these prepared SC-ISMEs exhibited a low LOD of 6.4 × 10−10 M for Pb2+. Based on the same configuration protocol, changing the doped ionophores in the polymeric membranes can result in different SC-ISMEs, e.g., a Cu2+-ISME was also constructed for heavy metal ion analysis in sediments with a low LOD of 4.0 × 10−8 M.550
In other cases, SC-ISMEs can also be used for the in situ potentiometric ion measurement of river water or seawater samples. For example, the group of Diamond developed a pen-like multi-sensor potentiometric probe and successfully used it to in situ determine the pH of river water samples.551 An obvious advantage of this device is its multi-sensor configuration, which can be extended to the detection of other target ions. Xu and coworkers constructed a solid-contact Ca2+-ISME for continuous in situ seawater measurements.552 To prepare this SC-ISME, a Pt wire (0.5 mm diameter) was electropolymerized with the PEDOT/PSS layer and then coated with the membrane cocktail. The obtained SC-ISME has a certain degree of corrosion resistance to seawater and can maintain a lifespan of at least six months.


4.1.5 
            In vivo biomedical applications. 
SC-ISMEs have a number of applications in the biomedical field, especially for in vivo measurements. Due to the relative maturity of the preparation technology, various SC-ISMEs based on glass micropipettes are still the common analysis tools in this field. For example, Kim et al. constructed a solid-contact Ca2+-ISME for monitoring the dynamic changes in Ca2+ levels in the rat kidneys.553 This microsensor was made of a theta-type glass capillary with an Ag wire, which was treated to obtain a silanized Ag/AgCl surface and then coated with the membrane cocktail to prepare a Ca2+-ISME. A stable Nernstian response of 25.7 mV per decade was observed for the Ca2+-ISME. Furthermore, they also prepared a Pt wire-based amperometric NO microelectrode and combined it with the Ca2+-ISME to form a dual-function microsensor. Two different regions of a kidney, i.e., renal medulla and cortex, were selected to perform the location-dependent Ca2+ and NO analysis using the developed dual-function microsensor, and the results showed that the levels of Ca2+ and NO in the medulla are higher than those in the cortex. In addition, based on the same configuration protocols, an electrochemical dual-functional microsensor for the simultaneous determination of K+ and NO in rat brains under epileptic seizure was also developed by the same group.554
Compared with routine analysis, the application conditions of SC-ISMEs for in vivo measurements are more demanding and challenging, which puts forward higher requirements for SC-ISMEs. For example, these SC-ISMEs for in vivo measurements must be mechanically strong enough to penetrate the biological tissues and must be small enough to avoid unnecessary damage during insertion. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel SC-ISMEs that are more robust, versatile, and insensitive to physicochemical factors to replace the conventional glass micropipette-based ones. For this, Odijk and coworkers developed a solid-contact K+-ISME probe with a novel design, which can be used to measure K+ levels in the living rodent brains at multiple depths and locations (Fig. 24a–c).555 Two microfabricated silicon probes of 100 µm × 100 µm square shaft diameter were mounted on a PCB, separated by 2 mm, which can be inserted in the rat brains for simultaneous measurements at two locations. Both microprobes have seven Pt microelectrode substrates, of which the diameter of tetrode structure microelectrode disks is 20 µm and the diameter of the other three disks is 10 µm, and SiO2 is deposited to insulate the lead of the Pt microelectrodes. A layer of PEDOT was electrochemically polymerized on the surface of the microelectrode disks to form the solid-contact layer, which was then covered with the K+-sensitive membrane cocktails to prepare K+-ISMEs. Typical membranes have a thickness of 5 µm in the middle and a thickness of 15 µm at the edge. As a proof-of-concept, these SC-ISME probes have been demonstrated to record transient changes in extracellular K+ concentration in the cerebral cortex of living mice when the neurological phenomenon of spreading depression (SD) occurs, accompanied by changes in pH and O2. Furthermore, this versatile platform shows potential for combining different SC-ISMEs onto an individual probe to simultaneously in vivo monitor multiple ionic signals at different depths and locations in the brain of living rodents.

In other cases, He and coworkers fabricated SC-ISMEs by using a simple coated wire method for the determination of acetylcholine (Ach) in the rat brain homogenate.556 For the preparation of SC-ISMEs, PEDOT/PSS was coated on one end of the gold wire (0.5 mm diameter) as the solid-contact layer and then covered with a polymeric membrane cocktail containing heptakis(2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-β-cyclodextrin as an Ach ionophore. These SC-ISMEs are stable over a temperature range of 15–40 °C and a pH range of 6.5–8.5 with a detection range of 10−5–10−1 M for Ach. The group of Mao developed SC-ISMEs for the real-time measurement of the dynamics of extracellular Ca2+ levels during the SD process in the brains of living rats (Fig. 24d–g).166 These Ca2+-ISMEs were constructed based on the CFEs (7 µm diameter) that were covered with the SHCN-based solid-contact layer and the membrane cocktail. Experiments show that these SC-ISMEs possess a good anti-biofouling ability and can maintain potential stability after 2 hours of implantation into the brain of live rats. Based on the CFE substrate, the same group also constructed H+-ISMEs,557 K+-ISMEs,246 and nanoporous CP-coated dopamine microelectrodes558 for the monitoring of physiological conditions of the living rat brains. Besides, they also discussed the construction of different SC-ISMEs for in vivo analysis in the field of brain neurochemistry.559
Apart from the measurements in the kidney or brain, the group of Crespo developed a potentiometric microneedle-shaped SC-ISME patch for intradermal ion detection (Fig. 24h–k).560 This analytical device consisting of a pair of microneedle-shaped SC-ISME and reference microelectrode was fixed in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) epidermal patch and used for the detection of K+ levels in the subcutaneous interstitial fluid. For the construction of microneedle-like K+-ISMEs, functionalized MWCNTs were deposited on the top of the carbon-modified stainless-steel microneedle as the solid-contact layer. The obtained microneedle-like K+-ISMEs have a length of 1000 µm and a tip thickness of 15 µm. As a proof-of-concept, this microneedle patch exhibits no side effects on skin cells for at least 24 hours of in vitro cytotoxicity experiments and shows good reproducibility in animal skin insertion tests.
When considering the possible interactions and impacts between in vivo potentiometric biosensors and target objects, biocompatibility and biofouling are important factors that cannot be ignored.561,562 For these biomedical potentiometric ion sensing devices, especially for implantable and wearable measurements, the critical assessment of biocompatibility is necessary. Otherwise, undesirable host inflammatory reactions may be caused by using these unoptimized devices.563,564 Based on these considerations, the group of Crespo recommended that the biocompatibility assays should be done before further biomedical application of these potentiometric ion sensors configurated with the polymeric ISMs.565 They performed a series of in vitro cytotoxicity assessments of ISMs with different compositions, involving the assays of cell proliferation, viability, and adhesion with human dermal fibroblasts. The results reveal that valinomycin (K+ ionophore) and nonactin (NH4+ ionophore) leached from the ISM into the culture media are highly toxic to fibroblasts, thus greatly inhibiting cell proliferation. This inhibition phenomenon is even worse when the fibroblast monolayer is exposed to the ISMs containing the plasticizer (2-fluorophenyl 2-nitrophenylether, FNDPE) during cell adhesion tests. However, the use of mutacin as a potassium ionophore alternative for valinomycin shows no toxicity, suggesting its potential for the fabrication of biocompatible K+-ISEs.
On the other hand, enhanced biofouling resistance is also of significant importance to protect the sensor performance from the adverse impact of the surface accumulation of chemical or biological species (e.g., macromolecules and protein) on the sensing membrane.566,567 Such undesirable adsorption creates a barrier between the sensing area and the target analyte, leading to the increased noise signals and performance degradation of sensitivity, LOD, lifespan, etc. In this regard, the group of Lisak presented a method to study the kinetics of biofouling of SC-ISEs by using the combined technique of in situ potentiometry and null ellipsometry.57 The amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorbed on the surface of SC-ISEs and the accordingly resulting potential drift were quantitatively analyzed by this method. According to the test results, it is recommended to conduct the pre-equilibration of the sensor surface and sample solution before the actual clinical applications to avoid undesirable potential drops. Besides, the same group also researched the influence of phosphate buffer and BSA on the potentiometric response of SC-ISEs for heavy metal ion detection and found that the analytical performance at low analyte concentrations of SC-ISEs can be improved through the synergistic effect between the primary ion, conditioning solution, and surface-adsorbed biomolecule.568
For further enhancing the biocompatibility and anti-biofouling capability of these potentiometric ion sensors configurated with the ISM, several different strategies have been reported, such as changing the composition of the ISM, releasing active substances from the ISM, modifying the membrane surface by grafting biological or synthetic molecules, coating the ISM with a more biocompatible material, etc.569,570 Among them, the use of biocompatible material-based surface protective coatings is a relatively simple and versatile approach to improve biocompatibility and biofouling resistance,571 and different coating materials have been reported to achieve this goal, such as poly(ethylene glycol),572 heparin- modified chitosan,573 heparin modified bacterial cellulose,574 polydopamine,575 GO,576 SR,288 and so on. It is worth noting that the development and use of these enhancement strategies must be based on minimizing the impact on the response time, selectivity, and sensitivity of original sensors.577 Although these strategies have not yet been widely used for the development of SC-ISMEs, it is predicted that how to solve the issues of biocompatibility and biofouling will be one of the key factors to further improve the practicability of these in vivo SC-ISMEs.

4.2 Flexible SC-ISEs
The flexibility of ISEs comes from the improvement of conventional rigid electrodes, making them more suitable for flexible operating environments, especially for wearable concepts. Now, as one of the most attractive fields in the development of modern ISEs, considerable efforts have been devoted to improving their structure and performance for greater compatibility with wearable technologies. These flexible ISEs are integrated with wearable electronics as a part of the sensing component for the detection of ion activities in a variety of biofluids, which is also the main driving force for the development of flexible ISEs currently. The monitoring of certain ions in biofluids as the critical biomarkers can reflect a lot of information closely related to human physiological processes, which helps to better understand the electrolyte balance to maintain normal neural activities and basic metabolic functions. The employment of flexible ISEs in wearables offers an easy-to-use and cheap tool for quantitative analysis of in situ ion monitoring related to human health, allowing the detection of targeted analytes in a variety of biofluids. Taking the most common sweat analysis as an example, the broadly available ion selectivity of ISEs can cover major sweat analytes, such as Na+, K+, Ca+, NH4+, and Cl−, which are relatively abundant in sweat (∼mM level).578 In addition, integrated together with other sensors, such as electrochemical sensors (e.g., glucose) and physical sensors (e.g., temperature and strain),579 these wearable flexible electronics with potentiometric ion sensors can be connected to smart devices via Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology for real-time, continuous, comprehensive data acquisition of an individual's health and athletic performance.580 This stands as a promising alternative to conventional instrumental analytical techniques for the determination of human biomarkers using a simpler approach, showing unique attractiveness and great commercial potential.581,582
When looking back, in terms of in vivo monitoring extracellular ion activities in vascular endothelium and myocardium, attempts to prepare flexible ISEs have long been made to avoid undesirable damage to the electrode itself and the detected cells as a result of their rigidity and brittleness, such as the replacement of the glass body of micropipettes with plastic materials.477,583 But compared to the flexibility of modern planar microelectrodes, there is obviously two concepts.501,502 One of the first trials for obtaining a wearable sensor based on ISEs was reported by the group of Diamond in 2000.584 They used an array device of potentiometric ion microelectrodes as a small portable analytical instrument, which was connected to a wristwatch-like sweat sampler via a peristaltic pump, to simultaneously analyze Na+, K+, and Cl− in sweat samples with a portable PC. Ten years later, the same group reported the first example of wearable potentiometric ion sensing devices that can access real-time electrolyte data through a potentiometer during exercise.585 In recent years, benefiting from the advances in microelectronics, materials science, manufacturing methods, and chemical analysis techniques, flexible and stretchable bioelectronics have been applied for the development of SC-ISEs, which have further spearheaded the research development in potentiometric ion sensing devices for point-of-care diagnostic devices. These flexible ISEs with advanced design are integrated into a variety of wearables (such as wristbands, patches, tattoos, eyeglasses, clothing, etc.) to continuously detect a range of electrolyte indicators, characterized by their intimate and noninvasive integration with the soft curved surface of the human body.578,586 On the basis of previous statistics reported by Steinberg et al. in 2016, potentiometric ion sensors as frequently used analytical tools account for about a quarter of all wearable electrochemical sensors,587 and there is a reason to believe that this percentage is still increasing.
According to the reported literature, the solid-contact configuration of ISEs appears to be the only approach for wearable potentiometric ion sensing. Conventional liquid-contact ISEs are not compatible with modern flexible wearable technologies due to their inherent liquid compositions. Besides, any possible leakage of the inner filling solution will invalidate the sensor and also cause trouble to the wearer. In contrast, when it comes to wearable applications, the advantages of simple processing and reliability of SC-ISEs are more obvious and attractive, making them the current mainstream sensing tools. For these SC-ISEs exploited in the current flexible wearables, signal stability is of critical importance. In general, the development of wearable devices does not involve the exploration of new solid-contact functional materials. The selection of ion-to-electron transducers is usually based on the existing performance test reports and the compatibility of manufacturing technologies. Although the range of available ion–electron transducers is extensive, as to SC-ISEs integrated into wearable devices, CPs (e.g., PTDOT588–591) and carbon nanomaterials (e.g., CNTs,192,592–594 GR215,595,596) are particularly favored. A large number of studies and applications have proved the effective transduction function and good stability of PEDOT, making it the most commonly used CP for manufacturing wearable SC-ISEs.45 Another CP, PANI, is often used as the sensing layer of pH electrodes separately in wearables due to its intrinsic pH sensitivity.597–601 Carbon nanomaterials, as one of the favored transducer materials, can enhance the stability of the potentiometric signals due to their large double-layer capacitance. The employment of carbon nanomaterials allows the fabrication of flexible SC-ISEs without the need for conductive metal substrates. Using the customized functional inks based on carbon nanomaterials, patterned conductive electrodes can be generated on flexible and stretchable substrates using various printing techniques.602 In particular, carbon nanomaterials have more preparation strategies due to their unique properties. For example, high-performance GR-based electrodes can be directly prepared on different carbon-bearing substrates by simple one-step laser engraving, which has undoubtedly huge potential for the fabrication of flexible SC-ISEs.603,604
The development and application of flexible SC-ISEs incorporate the state-of-the-art manufacturing and analytical technologies. Nevertheless, when using these flexible SC-ISEs in wearable potentiometric ion sensing systems, there are still many limitations remaining to be addressed to better meet the requirements of the wearable concept. Apart from the basic requirements for measurement accuracy and reliability, these flexible SC-ISEs are necessary to be miniaturized to meet the requirement of finite sample volume and to possess acceptable wearing comfort, durability, lifespan, and biocompatibility. Another outstanding issue is the calibration of these sensors. Although SC-ISEs have made some progress in calibration-free measurements, they have not yet been expanded to wearable applications. Besides, when considering that target users are usually ordinary consumers rather than the experienced researchers, the operation of wearable devices must be user-friendly with easy-to-understand data readouts. Actual on-body measurements represent a complex application environment with various uncontrollable physical or chemical interference factors. The realization of a truly reliable wearable potentiometric ion sensing system requires not only robust flexible SC-ISEs, but also the optimization of the design of the entire galvanic cell, including the sample reservoirs and the REs that are often overlooked. In short, the wearable application of flexible SC-ISEs is both a challenge and an opportunity.8 The versatility and universality of wearable sensing platforms are of general reference significance for the development of portable devices, not only for on-body applications but also for environmental, agricultural, and industrial monitoring.

4.2.1 Fabrication technology. 
Flexible SC-ISEs are typically planar, miniaturized, and compatible with various flexible manufacturing technologies. Of these, apart from the common semiconductor manufacturing technologies for the fabrication of conductive metal electrodes, numerous technologies suitable for functional ink printing have also received extensive attention, allowing the simultaneous manufacturing of conductive electrodes and solid-contact layers. In addition, a variety of support materials and specific electrode designs endow these SC-ISEs with the desired characteristics, such as flexibility and stretchability. With the advances in fabrication technology and materials science, the production of flexible SC-ISEs is continuously developing toward achieving high throughput and low cost, promoting their further applications and commercialization.
Screen printing technology is a well-established approach for the production of a variety of electrochemical sensors605 and has also long been used for the development of SC-ISEs.34,502,606,607 As the most commonly used ink printing technology, screen printing is a stencil process using a mesh screen to transfer the functional ink onto the substrate, with the advantages of simplicity, low cost, and wide application scope.608,609 As shown in Fig. 25a, the group of Wang successfully used screen printing technology to prepare highly stretchable CNT-based electrodes, which can be used to construct flexible SC-ISEs.610 Benefitting from the intrinsic stretchability of the specially tailored CNT inks and elastomeric PU binders, as well as the synergistic design of serpentine structures, these CNT-based electrodes can maintain their structural integrity under an extremely large strain of up to 500%. For potentiometric ion sensing, these CNT-based electrodes were further functionalized with PU-based ISMs to realize flexible NH4+-ISEs, which display a stable potentiometric response during the entire mechanical resiliency test. Based on screen printing technology, the same group also constructed a series of flexible tattoo-based SC-ISEs.611,612 For example, Fig. 25b shows two types of wearable temporary transfer tattoo sensors for potentiometrically monitoring the pH and NH4+ level of sweat, respectively.613,614 In the fabrication process, conductive electrodes were first prepared via a thick-film screen printing manufacturing technique using a carbon fiber-doped ink and modified with functional sensing layers and then placed on the skin through the temporary transfer tattoo papers. The advantages of these tattoo-based SC-ISEs are that they are compliant with the skin and concealed in an artistic tattoo pattern and they can withstand repeated bending and stretching of the tattoos, while maintaining mechanical integrity and relatively stable analytical performance.

Transfer printing technology is a method to rapidly transfer patterns from a patterned template or mold to a receiving substrate, which is capable of heterogeneously integrating various electronic materials into the required flexible and stretchable substrates in a controllable manner.615 A key feature is that transfer printing technology overcomes the incompatibilities between the conventional fabrication protocols and unconventional substrates, allowing the separation of preparation and assembly processes of intricate electrical patterns and their eventual transfer onto the desired receiving substrates, which broadens the selection of substrates for the fabrication of flexible electronics and wearable sensors.616–619 For instance, Roy et al. developed flexible MWCNT-based SC-ISEs for wearable applications (Fig. 25c).592 Based on the transfer printing technique, MWCNTs grown on the SiO2/Si wafer substrates by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method can be transferred onto adhesive flexible substrates (e.g., temporary tattoo papers or Kapton tapes) to prepare flexible SC-ISE arrays. In particular, compared with gold, platinum, or screen-printed carbon electrodes, the ISM exhibits an enhanced attachment to MWCNT films due to the increased surface roughness. A wearable device containing MWCNT-based SC-ISEs and SC-REs was fabricated, which exhibited a response slope of 58 ± 3 mV per decade toward Na+ detection and can maintain stable operation for at least 1 hour.
Spray coating and inkjet printing, two droplet-based printing technologies, are also attractive for the preparation of flexible SC-ISEs due to their unique characteristics.620,621 Among them, spray coating technology is a relatively quick and simple preparation method, in which a diluted functional suspension is sprayed onto an inert supporting substrate using a pneumatic airbrush, usually accompanied by a heating process to evaporate the solvent for avoiding the aggregation caused by drying.360 With the help of spraying templates, patterned deposition can be easily achieved through spray coating. When using this technology to fabricate solid-contact layers and conductive substrates of SC-ISEs, selected functional inks are typically based on carbon nanomaterials, such as CNTs or GR suspensions in low-toxicity aqueous or organic solvents. For instance, the group of Niu demonstrated flexible SC-ISEs based on GR spray-coated hydrophobic paper for wearable applications (Fig. 25d).215 Specific shapes of electrode arrays were obtained through a corresponding mask. With four sensing channels, the integrated SC-ISE array is capable of simultaneously detecting pH, Cl−, Na+, and K+ in sweat. Because of the flow rate disturbance as a result of a small nozzle diameter or a low pressure, spray coating tends to produce scattered droplets, making the formation of very thin films with a high degree of uniformity difficult, which is sometimes considered a drawback of this technology.622 In this study, however, the wrinkled surface with high surface roughness of the spray-coated GR layer facilitates a tight connection to the ISM.
As for inkjet printing technology, it can realize digital high-precision multi-ink printing with controlled and adjustable processes and without the need for templates, which are widely used in prototype design or the small-scale production of flexible electronic devices.623–625 In recent years, several flexible SC-ISEs have been developed for routine analysis using this printing technology, such as inkjet-printed GR-based SC-ISEs,213 SC-ISEs constructed on inkjet-printed gold electrodes,626 and fully inkjet-printed paper-based SC-ISEs.216 In other cases, Shiwaku et al. used inkjet printing technology to develop an organic amplification system for wearable flexible SC-ISEs.78 However, compared to other technologies, the application of inkjet printing for the development of wearable flexible SC-ISEs is relatively scarce, which may be due to the limited range of printable inks and substrate materials and relatively high equipment costs. In addition, high-temperature processing and infrared sintering are often used to fabricate inkjet-printed electrodes, but are not preferred for flexible SC-ISEs based on a substrate that is not resistant to high temperature.627
For further reducing costs and for promoting commercialization, the large-scale, high-throughput, and uniform production of flexible SC-ISEs is essential. In this regard, roll-to-roll (R2R) printing technology, which relies on large rolls to measure and control the deposition of functional inks on the substrate surface, is a stronger viable candidate than other ink printing technologies.628 The group of Javery demonstrated the tremendous productivity of the R2R process, using which a mass of flexible carbon-based electrodes were fabricated on up to 150 m of a flexible substrate (Fig. 25e).590 These carbon-based electrodes can be further functionalized to develop disposable flexible SC-ISE test strips. Later, the same group introduced an approach to mass fabricate microfluidic sensing patches via R2R processes for sweat sensing (Fig. 25f).49 This wearable patch has two aligned layers, including a patterned sensing component layer for the fabricated flexible SC-ISEs and some other sensors to simultaneously monitor sweat biomarkers and rates, and a microfluidic adhesive layer with sweat collection reservoirs and spiral microfluidic channels to gather and guide sweat flow. However, on the other hand, the R2R printing technology is also characterized by high equipment and operation costs and the need for large quantities of printing inks. With the expectation of completing the prototype design of SC-ISEs using other complementary technologies and for further verifying their commercial viability, the large capital startup costs of the R2R technique can be averaged out when the production scale is large enough.625
In addition to ink printing technologies, the most used fabrication technology for the development of wearable flexible SC-ISEs based on metal electrode substrates is photolithography.629–632Fig. 25g and h show two typical wearable sensing modules fabricated using photolithography technology, in which flexible SC-ISEs are combined with iontophoresis electrodes and temperature sensors, respectively.589,633 With the use of a programmable iontophoresis electrode, a wearable flexible SC-ISE-based platform can promote periodic sweat extraction from sedentary individuals for in situ physiological analysis.589 The combination of flexible SC-ISEs and temperature sensors enables the real-time continuous analysis of body fluids and skin temperature for disease diagnosis.633Fig. 25i illustrates a flexible and stretchable SC-ISE array with a precise open cellular substrate to facilitate solution exchange for use in bio-integrated electronic devices.634 A flexible SC-ISE array with eight sites is mounted on a stretchable PDMS cellular substrate, in which the interconnecting wires possess a lithographically defined serpentine structure to achieve biaxial stretchability. Three types of SC-ISEs were constructed based on the PEDOT/PSS-enabled solid-contact layer and ionophore-doped polymeric membrane for the detection of H+, K+, and Ca2+, respectively. Within the biologically relevant range of ion concentrations, these SC-ISEs exhibit comparable analytical performance to previously reported counterparts constructed on non-stretchable substrates and can remain stable for up to 2 days of continuous immersion in water. In general, photolithography allows the high-resolution manufacture of conductive patterns for specific design requirements; however, the relative complexity of the manufacturing process based on this technology may be a limiting factor for its large-scale application in the development of flexible SC-ISEs.
The flexibility of SC-ISEs has its roots in the intrinsic characteristics of functional materials and substrate materials.635,636 Typical substrate materials for the development of flexible SC-ISEs are inert polymer materials, such as PET588–590,633,637 and PDMS.595,596,634 PET-based substrates possess excellent mechanical bendability, durability, and high transparency, but are not stretchable.638 PDMS is the most commonly used stretchable substrate material, characterized by simple processing, stable chemical properties, and non-toxicity.639 Elastomeric PDMS substrates can be incorporated with stretchable functional materials and electrode structures or mixed with other electronic materials for increased stretch recovery.640,641 Another common commercially available polymer, PI, has excellent thermal and chemical resistance and insulating features, and thus it has been extensively used as a flexible substrate for electronic circuits.642,643 However, PI is not highly transparent and cannot withstand large tensile stresses. Its intrinsic color and unstretchability limit its application in wearable sensing modules.644
Apart from synthetic polymers, considerable efforts have also been made to try other ordinary materials as supporting substrates for wearable flexible SC-ISEs, such as temporary transfer tattoo papers,612 carbon adhesive tapes,645 carbon fibers,646 cotton yarns,192 threads,647 and textiles.648,649 Taking textiles as an example, flexible textile-based SC-ISEs can be integrated into smart clothing, relying on the rich elastomeric properties of textiles to achieve conformal contact between the device and the human body for real-time analysis. The group of Wang reported a flexible and stretchable textile-based SC-ISE array (Fig. 26a).594 A screen-printed MWCNT-based serpentine conductive pattern was directly mounted on different fabric materials functionalized with PU-based ISMs to simultaneously monitor K+ and Na+ in sweat. Fig. 26b shows another different strategy for the preparation of SC-ISEs from textiles.591 In this study, flexible SC-ISEs were constructed on electrode substrates based on highly conductive nitrogen-doped carbon textiles annealed from silk fabrics. This integrated platform can be used to simultaneously detect multiplex biomarkers, including K+ and Na+. The flexibility of the whole system was also demonstrated through the fabrication of the sensing patch on a common silk fabric.

4.2.2 Flexible SC-ISE-enabled wearable devices. 
Wireless wearable ion sensing systems. 
Wearable ion sensing is the most important application of flexible SC-ISEs. A typical wireless wearable ion sensing system consists of two parts, including a sensing component for signal transduction and an electronic component for signal conditioning, processing, and transmission.578 In general, flexible SC-ISEs are integrated with other physical or chemical sensors to form the sensing component, while the precision-designed electronic component is the key to realizing the sensing function. The configuration strategies of these electronic components are generally based on the combination of traditional silicon microchips and flexible substrates, including flexible PCBs and soft polymers printed with conductive elements.595,596,650–652 When considering the options of various wireless and contactless approaches, smartphone-compatible technologies have a unique appeal in the development of wireless wearable ion sensing systems. For a better understanding of the design, manufacture, and operation of these systems, here is an excellent example presented by Gao et al., who developed an integrated wireless wearable platform that can be packaged as a smart wristband or headband (Fig. 27a).588 Flexible Na+- and K+-ISEs were integrated with glucose, lactate, and temperature sensors to realize the multiplexed sensing of informative biomarkers in sweat. The integrated circuit component was fabricated on a flexible PCB, consisting of analog circuits for the implementation of signal-conditioning paths, a pre-programmed microcontroller with a built-in analog-to-digital converter block to calibrate the conditioned signals, and a Bluetooth transceiver for data transmission to a custom-developed mobile application. As to a Bluetooth-based device, the Bluetooth module in the electronic component dominates its power consumption, which determines how long it can operate. Although the reduced overall power consumption can be achieved through the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology,653 these BLE-based devices still require relatively large, bulky hardware and power batteries to realize advanced wireless communication, limiting their further miniaturization.

To circumvent these tradeoffs, near-field communication (NFC) has been used as an attractive wireless communication alternative to Bluetooth to design smaller, lighter, more flexible electronic components for SC-ISE-enabled wearable devices.654–657 Based on the inductive coupling principle, NFC technology is compatible with both high-efficiency power transfer and wireless data transmission.658,659 An attractive key is that NFC-based wearables allow passive energy reception from the receiving device to achieve battery-free device architectures with a relatively small component count.595,652 For instance, Xu et al. demonstrated a battery-free wireless epidermal electrochemical system with an NFC communication module, which enabled both wireless powering and communication (Fig. 27b).596 The sensing component of this device was composed of three types of flexible SC-ISEs and a glucose sensor for the simultaneous detection of H+, K+, Na+, and glucose levels in sweat. As to the matching flexible circuit, it was fitted with an analog front end (AFE), a microcontroller unit (MCU), and an NFC chip, exploiting a multilayer design, including the PI substrate layer and PDMS encapsulation layer, to minimize bending-induced strains. The NFC-enabled smartphones can connect wirelessly to this wearable device via inductive coupling with the NFC antennas. A custom mobile application with a user-friendly interface was developed to display analysis data from the sensors in real time. Nevertheless, due to the near-field properties of this technology, even if these receiving devices have high transmission power, NFC-based wearables can only achieve shorter-range interactions with them. On the other hand, the limited transmitter–receiver distance is thought to guarantee the security of data transmission and enhance anti-interference, and in some cases allows users to readily control the continuous and autonomous sensing.578 Therefore, prior to implementation, the characteristics of the distance and sampling frequency between NFC-based wearables and NFC-enabled devices should be fully understood.
At present, as two main wireless communication protocols, Bluetooth and NFC technologies have been widely used for the development of various SC-ISE-enabled wireless wearable devices.587 These two technologies have their respective advantages and constraints; however, from the perspective of high-density wireless data communication, in which multiple SC-ISE-enabled wearable devices require high-rate interactions, neither of these technologies are suitable for amplified connectivity requirements.580 Other options, including high-frequency (HF) and ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) technologies, are much more limited in epidermal wearables and therefore less practical currently.635 Apart from the need for a reasonable choice of wireless communication protocols, simplifying components, reducing power consumption, and exploring new energy supplies are also important for development of new-generation SC-ISE-enabled wireless wearable devices. For instance, many efforts have been made to find new alternatives to conventional batteries, such as nanogenerators,660–664 solar cells,665–667 biofuel cells,668–670 and micro-supercapacitors,671–674 to achieve high energy harvesting and storage capabilities for smart wearable electronics. Based on these novel technologies and strategies, development of more flexible and durable SC-ISE-enabled smart wireless wearable devices is expected.
The types of SC-ISE-enabled wearable devices. 
The use of wireless and contactless technologies enables SC-ISE-based wearable devices to have practical feasibilities for continuous, non-invasive, and real-time monitoring of an individual's health status and exercise performance using a comfortable method, without compromising the welfare of the wearer. Based on the Bluetooth or NFC wireless communication protocol, a variety of wearables with flexible SC-ISEs have been developed for different parts of the body, including watches,675,676 wristbands,588,589,591,677 epidermal patches,595,596,652,678,679 tattoos,611 intraoral electronics,680 eyeglass,681 textiles,594etc. From the perspective of design strategies, these devices can be roughly divided into two categories, one is the combination of sensing components and necessary wearables of individuals (e.g., eyeglass and textiles) and the other is specially designed functional wearable devices (e.g., epidermal patches and intraoral electronics).
Integrating wearable ion sensing devices into individual essential wearables can measure human physiological indicators without the need for additional wearable devices. The group of Wang presented a wireless integrated eyeglass sensing system capable of real-time detecting K+ and lactate in sweat (Fig. 27c).681 The sensing components were cleverly positioned on two nose-bridge pads, including a K+-ISE and a lactate biosensor that are connected with a wireless electronic module on the arm of the spectacle. This eyeglass system provides a compatible sensing platform with interchangeable-sensing features, allowing the replacement of nose-bridge sensor stickers to detect different sweat electrolytes and metabolites. In another example, flexible SC-ISEs were fabricated on different common textiles for the detection of electrolyte levels in sweat (Fig. 27d).594 The combination of sensors and textiles shows some advantages, such as comfort and washability. Moreover, due to the intrinsic elasticity of the textiles and the stretchability of custom inks and conductive patterns, such textile-based wearable potentiometric ion sensing systems can withstand large stretching and bending deformations. From the development perspective, the integration of textile-based SC-ISEs and portable wireless data transmission devices makes it possible for a common garment to become a smart sweat monitoring platform.
As to specially designed functional wearable devices, here is a special example of a soft intraoral monitoring device that has been designed to real-time quantify Na+ intake through a remote wireless telemetry method (Fig. 27e).680 This intraoral sensing system integrates miniaturized SC-ISEs and ultrathin stretchable electronic components that enable comfortable contact with intraoral tissue. The demonstration of real-time recording of Na+ levels in the saliva of healthy subjects proved the feasibility of this device to monitor Na+ intake for hypertension management. Nevertheless, compared to SC-ISE-enabled epidermal wearable devices, the complex oral environment (including the adverse effects of saliva components and food residues) puts forward higher design requirements on these types of intraoral wearables.
Sampling method. 
For the practical applications of these wireless wearables containing flexible SC-ISEs, an important factor that cannot be ignored is how to obtain enough biofluid sample volumes. Although the miniaturized ISEs have been proved to have the ability to detect trace ion levels in confined samples,476,548 the premise of potentiometric ion sensing is that even if there is only a low sample volume, a well-defined galvanic cell must be formed between the WE and RE, as well as the sample solution. In routine analysis, the use of auxiliary sampling modules (e.g., paper and sponge) is a common and effective method for collecting or separating target analytes from small liquid samples.682–686 For sampling methods in wearable applications, taking the most common sweat sensing as an example, several similar strategies have also been adopted to tackle this problem, involving wicking pads, sampling cells, and microfluidics. Of these, wicking pads made of various sweat-absorbing materials are widely used as sweat-uptake layers to gather sweat due to their simplicity and effectiveness.588,589,679,687 These pads cover the surface of the sensing components and connect with the human skin to absorb sweat through capillary force. Fig. 27f and g show two types of wicking pads made of porous cellulose sponge and absorbing paper, respectively.596,652 Nevertheless, the sensing components with these structures cannot distinguish between new and older sweat, and thus they are usually disposable, or require frequent replacement of the wicking pads to recycle the sensors.688,689 In another instance, SC-ISE-enabled wearable devices with sampling cells can continuously accumulate fresh sweat through a large open structure (Fig. 27h).229 However, in this case, sweat collection requires the wearer to have a high sweat rate via a certain level of exercise or an external stimulus, which is not universally applicable.
When more complex actual conditions are considered, e.g., irregular sweating, low sweat rates, sweat renewal, and the possibility of evaporation and contamination, well-designed wearable microfluidic devices show their unique appeal.604,690–693 The group of Diamond developed several polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-based microfluidic chips incorporating highly absorbent cotton threads to assist passive fluid transport for sensing Na+ levels in sweat.675–677 However, the rigid nature of the PMMA material is not conducive to establishing close contact with the skin and may cause discomfort to the wearer. In pursuit of flexibility and stretchability, most microfluidic substrates are based on PDMS. The group of Wang presented an integrated epidermal microfluidic potentiometric device containing a soft PDMS-based microfluidic patch.678 The microfluidic network has four inlet channels to provide a sufficient amount of sweat and one outlet channel to ensure that the generated sweat efficiently flowed through the centered SC-ISEs to detect Na+ and K+ levels. The group of Javey fabricated a wearable microfluidic sensing patch with a spiral-patterned microfluidic channel that can spontaneously pump the secreted sweat to enable sweat ion analysis with the use of SC-ISEs.694 Later, the same group also reported a flexible multi-model epidermal sensing patch with a serpentine microfluidic channel for non-invasive biofluid and electrolyte secretion analysis (Fig. 27i).695 During the analysis, sweat flows sequentially through the integrated sensors (an Na+-ISE, an impedimetric sensor, and a sweat rate sensor) along the channel, enabling this microfluidic device to simultaneously monitor Na+ levels, total ionic charge concentration, and the sweat rate. In general, well-designed encapsulated chambers and controlled channels of microfluidics enable sweat flow within the restricted domain with the decoupling of its production and sensing, thereby facilitating accurate sweat analysis. With this configuration, wearable devices cannot only avoid undesirable evaporation and contamination of sweat samples but also reduce the mixing and carry-over effects.

5. Summary and outlook
For nearly half a century since their inception, SC-ISEs, as a new generation of potentiometric ion sensors, have exhibited unique attractiveness and have become one of the indispensable essential tools for ion analysis in a great variety of applications. Here, following an overview of the basic concept of SC-ISEs, we have presented a comprehensive review of recent advances in solid-contact functional materials, with an emphasis on the miniaturization and flexibility of SC-ISEs. Given the rapid pace of development in this field, what we provide herein may be only a momentary view. Nevertheless, we hope the issues discussed in this article can provide some new perspectives and useful guidance for the development of SC-ISEs and inspire more exciting innovations and applications in this expanding field of potentiometric ion sensors.
The emergence of ion-to-electron transducers for SC-ISEs marks a milestone in the development of modern potentiometric ion sensors with significant improvements in response stability and reproducibility. To date, a number of functional materials have been proved to be effective ion-to-electron transducers for SC-ISEs by acting as asymmetric capacitors with redox capacitance or double-layer capacitance. However, due to a variety of properties and preparation methods of these functional materials, it is almost impossible to determine which one is the most suitable to serve as the solid-contact layer. In addition, differences in experimental approaches may also result in disparate interpretations of even the same functional material. In other words, there is still a lack of a universally accepted solid-contact layer platform for the preparation of SC-ISEs with different ISMs. In this context, the standard test protocols and common evaluation criteria need to be further refined to more fully standardize the development of SC-ISEs and provide clear and comparable parameters between different solid-contact functional materials. Besides, in view of the extensive selection of the existing functional materials, the method of demonstrating the improved performance characteristics of newly developed SC-ISEs by comparison with CWEs should be extended to other excellent choices, such as the use of control groups based on CPs, carbon nanomaterials, etc. In the years to come, it is certain that the pursuit of solid-contact functional materials that are more in line with ideal requirements and more versatile will still be an important focus for the development of robust SC-ISEs.
Based on the continuous innovation and advancement of theory, materials, technology, and design, considerable efforts have been made to improve the sensitivity, selectivity, LOD, lifespan, biocompatibility, and anti-biofouling capability of SC-ISEs, as well as to extend their detection capabilities beyond common ions. The miniaturized and flexible versions of SC-ISEs have also been widely used, which has further broadened the application fields of SC-ISEs, such as in vivo biomedical measurements and wearable point-of-care analysis. Meanwhile, by combining with advanced electronic components, SC-ISE-enabled devices have been able to perform remote ion detection wirelessly with more intelligent data acquisition and analysis capabilities. Besides, the use of dynamic electrochemistry protocols has transformed the sensing concepts of SC-ISEs from conventional zero-current potentiometry to dynamic potentiometry with more readout approaches. Nevertheless, despite these considerable advancements, many aspects of SC-ISEs still need to be further developed to enable large-scale manufacturing and applications towards commercialization. In order to meet these requirements, aside from the exploration of more ideal solid-contact functional materials, the demand for new membrane materials and ionophores and further optimization of the fabrication and equilibration conditions are equally urgent. In addition, although SC-ISEs have made significant development in terms of calibration-free and maintenance-free measurements, they are still in the infancy stage when considering practical applications. In short, there are co-existing opportunities and challenges in the current development of SC-ISEs. Thanks to the continuous progress made by numerous research groups around the world, it is believed that there will be more fundamental and technological breakthroughs in this field, with grander application prospects.
