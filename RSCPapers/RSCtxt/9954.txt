    , Accepted 10th October 2014First published on 10th October 2014AbstractA dense array of CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorods film (1D vertically aligned) was synthesized through a simple two-step aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method. In this configuration, a ZnS nanocrystal (protective shell) was grown in situ on a CdS core, forming nanorod heterostructures to restrain the photo-corrosion and enhance the charge separation and transportation efficiencies of CdS cores. The as-prepared CdS–ZnS films showed elevated photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance (over four times than that of uncoated CdS arrays) with a significant photocurrent density of 7.8 mA cm−2 (0 V, vs. SCE) and incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) values above 35% under AM 1.5G irradiation. Moreover, the stability of the photoelectrode was tested for over 16 min. These results suggest that the dense array of CdS–ZnS core–shell heterostructures provides a unique spatial distribution of the photo-excited charge carriers, as well as stable anti-photo-corrosion ability, and therefore is promising to be a photoelectrode in PEC hydrogen generation from water.
1 Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water for hydrogen using semiconductor materials has been widely regarded to be one of the most promising routes for resolving global environmental and energy problems.1–3 Based on the direct harvest of photons, a semiconductor photocatalyst use the captured energy to create electron–hole pairs for hydrogen generation from water. By assembling together the materials that have similar positions in their valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB), the range of the absorption spectrum can be elevated, thus creating a type-II electronic architecture (one semiconductor has a lower VB, and the other has a higher CB). This configuration can localize electron–hole wave functions in the shell or core materials, therefore extending the exciton lifetimes.4–7
Among all the investigated materials, CdS is a good candidate for a photocatalyst because of the perfect light absorption capacity and a suitable flat-band potential (−0.9 V vs. NHE). However, bare CdS easily underwent photo-corrosion and demonstrated a low photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation from water without any protection (constructing type-II semiconductor heterostructures or loading co-catalysts).8,9 As one of the effective solutions, in situ growth of a protective shell (ZnS) on the core (CdS) can enhance the photo-stability by physically separating CdS from its surrounding medium and prevent the photo-corrosion by reducing the number of dangling bonds on the material surface.10,11 Numerous studies have been reported for different the assembling of core–shell heterojunctions with type-II configuration. Based on this structure, remarkable improvements can been seen in the photocatalytic activity and photo-stability in the PEC process.12,13 For example, CdS–ZnS,14 CdTe–CdSe,15 and CdSe–ZnS16 core–shell photocatalysts have exhibited high efficiency in solar energy conversion applications. As a protective layer, with a relatively wider band gap, the shell semiconductor can effectively protect the core from photo-corrosion. Interestingly, a recent study reported that a quasi-type II CdS–ZnS core–shell particle showed considerably higher activity for photocatalytic hydrogen generation than the bare CdS core due to the unique spatial distribution of the photo-excited charge carriers in this core–shell particles, as well as the stable mesoporous ZnS shell.14 Motivated by these advances, we have fabricated a CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorod array by a simple method and employed the core–shell heterojunction as a photoelectrode for the PEC hydrogen generation from water.
In this work, a dense array of CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorods film was deposited on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass by a simple two-step aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method. Zn(S2CN(C2H5)2)2 and Cd(S2CN(C2H5)2)2 were used as the precursors for ZnS and CdS, respectively. This 1D structure is suitable to be used as a photoelectrode in PEC applications for hydrogen generation. Indeed, we found that the photocurrent density can considerably enhance the PEC performance of CdS–ZnS core–shell films, compared to the uncoated CdS arrays. In previous studies, different CdS–ZnS core–shell heterojunction samples have been studied, in particular the photocatalytic water splitting systems16 or dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs);17 however, there are few reports on the CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorods in a PEC water splitting cell with CdS core acting as a host photocatalyst.
2 Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
All the chemicals in this work, including Cd(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (NaS2CN(C2H5)2) were AR reagents purchased from Shanghai Chemical Factory of China and were used without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of cadmium and zinc diethyldithiocarbamate complex
The cadmium diethyldithiocarbamate complex (Cd(S2CN(C2H5)2)2) was prepared from stoichiometric amounts of Cd(NO3)2 (1 mmol) and NaS2CN(C2H5)2 (2 mmol) in 60 mL of absolute ethanol. After stirring for about 15 min at room temperature, the yellow precipitate were collected by centrifugation and thoroughly washed with absolute ethanol and distilled water several times, and finally vacuum-dried at room temperature. Zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (Zn(S2CN(C2H5)2)2) was synthesized by the method described for Cd(S2CN(C2H5)2)2 using Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol). The reaction for the preparation of the cadmium and zinc diethyldithiocarbamate complex can be formulated as follows: Zn(NO3)2 + 2NaS2CN(C2H5)2 → Zn(S2CN(C2H5)2)2 + 2NaNO3(1) Cd(NO3)2 + 2NaS2CN(C2H5)2 → Cd(S2CN(C2H5)2)2 + 2NaNO3(2)
2.3 Deposition of CdS and CdS–ZnS nanorods by AACVD
In a typical experiment, 350 mg of the precursor (M(S2CN(C2H5)2)2, M = Cd, Zn) was dissolved in 25 mL of CH2Cl2 in a two-necked round-bottomed flask (100 mL). The carrier gas (Ar) was passed into the solution to transport the aerosol. FTO glass (1 × 2 cm) was placed inside the reactor tube of a furnace (CARBOLITE). The flask containing precursor solution was kept in a water bath (room temperature) above the piezoelectric modulator of a PARKOO ultrasonic humidifier (Model YDH803EB). Thus, the aerosol droplets of the precursor generated were transferred into the hot wall zone of the reactor by carrier gas. Deposition was carried out at 400 °C for 30 min (CdS) and 520 °C for 30 min (ZnS).
2.4 Characterization
UV-vis absorption spectra of the as-prepared samples were characterized on a UV3600-NIR-recording spectrophotometer at resolution of 2 nm (Shimadzu, Japan). SEM images were taken on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). TEM images and EDX (EDAX Genesis 2000) spectroscopy were conducted on a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope operating at 200 kV. XRD patterns were performed on a BRUKER D8 Advance X-diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, 1.54056 Å).
2.5 PEC measurements
PEC properties of the CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorod films were measured using a three-electrode configuration (CHI610B Electrochemical Workstation, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), which was composed of the as-prepared samples as working electrodes, a Pt foil was used as the counter electrode, and a standard saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode. The solution of 0.25 mol L−1 Na2S + 0.35 mol L−1 Na2SO3 was used as the electrolyte. The photocurrent densities of the samples were tested at a potential ranging from −1.2 to 0 V (vs. SCE), with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The photocurrent density vs. time was measured at a potential of −0.5 V (vs. SCE). A 300 W Xe lamp (91160, Newport, USA) was used as the light source. An AM 1.5G filter was used to obtain one sun light intensity (100 mW cm−2). The xenon lamp equipped with a UV-light cut-off filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was employed as the visible light source. The light intensity (visible light) of the light source was 100 mW cm−2 (A model 1916-R Newport power meter). Another Xe lamp (300 W, CHF-XM-500, Changtuo Technology Co., Ltd.) and a monochromator (monochromator 300) were used to investigate the wavelength-dependent photocurrent, and the output intensity of the light source was measured with the same radiometer (1916-R, Newport). The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the samples was calculated as follows:  where Iph is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), P and λ are the incident light intensity (mW cm−2) and wavelength (nm), respectively.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 XRD patterns
The crystalline phases of the as-obtained CdS and CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorods (the samples were scraped from the FTO glass) were examined with the powder XRD technique. The XRD pattern of the bare CdS nanorods is shown at the bottom of Fig. 1, in which the peaks can be well indexed to the diffractions from the wurtzite phase CdS (JCPDS card no. 41-1049).18 It can also be noted that in the XRD pattern of the CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorods, additional peaks (blue stars) at 29.26° (111), 47.53° (220), and 56.35° (311) clearly indicate the existence of the zinc blende ZnS shell (JCPDS card no. 05-0566)19 coated on the surface of the CdS core. According to the previous study,20 further XRD analysis could support the formation of the ZnS shell along with the CdS core. Compared to the curve of uncoated CdS, a shift of the diffraction maxima toward larger angles can be found for the CdS–ZnS sample: 24.82° → 25.31°, 26.81° → 27.80°, 28.69° → 29.05°, 36.92° → 38.26°, 43.77° → 45.32°, 48.30° → 48.81°, and 51.88° → 52.73°. Similar shifts in the XRD pattern were also presented for other core–shell structures.21,22

3.2 SEM and TEM images
The final CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorod arrays were obtained via two steps: AACVD deposition of the CdS nanorod arrays and ZnS in situ growth on CdS core by AACVD. The fabrication of CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorod arrays is schematically shown in Fig. 2.

The morphologies of the products obtained were investigated by SEM. Uniform, dense and well-oriented CdS were successfully deposited on the FTO substrate (Fig. 3a). The cross-sectional image (Fig. 3a, inset) indicates that CdS nanorod arrays are smooth and grown perpendicular to the FTO substrate, with diameters ranging from 150 to 200 nm and with lengths up to ∼1.5 μm. Using the CdS nanorod arrays as the initiator, ZnS shells can be further grown along with the CdS nanorods (in situ) to form core–shell nanorod heterostructures. After the ZnS shell was deposited, it was found that the surface of the nanorod became rough (Fig. 3b). The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 3b, inset) shows that the CdS–ZnS nanorods are uniform and vertically aligned with an average diameter of about ∼300 nm and a length of ∼1.5 μm.

Low-magnification TEM and HR-TEM results further confirmed the in situ growth of a complete ZnS shell on the CdS core. The TEM image (Fig. 4a) of bare CdS nanorods shows an average diameter of 200 nm with smooth surfaces, which is similar to the SEM results. Compared to the uncoated CdS nanorods, a clear variation in contrast can be found, suggesting the growth of a ZnS shell around the CdS core, as shown in Fig. 4b. The formation of the ZnS shell may involve an initial adsorption of fractional Zn precursor due to the same ligand (–S2CN(C2H5)2), the following nucleation process, and ZnS nanocrystal growth in situ on CdS finally due to the lattice match >96% between CdS (002) and ZnS (111). Obviously, the CdS–ZnS core–shell heterostructures in our experiment follow a growth mechanism similar to the universal AACVD mechanism.23 A typical HRTEM image (Fig. 4c) of bare CdS nanorods exhibits clear lattice fringes (0.33 nm) corresponding to the (002) planes of the wurtzite CdS.24 The measured lattice spacings of 0.31 nm and 0.33 nm between the interface of the two crystals are consistent with the (111) crystal planes of the zinc blended ZnS25 and the (002) crystal planes of the wurtzite CdS,24 respectively (Fig. 4d).

3.3 EDX analysis
From Fig. 5a, it can be found that after further AACVD processing, ZnS is successfully deposited around the CdS nanorods with close contact, and the core–shell structure can be clearly observed in the TEM images because of the different electron penetrability between the core and shell. In addition, the thickness of the ZnS shell is ∼100 nm in this configuration (Fig. 5a). EDS analysis was conducted on the marked area of the core–shell nanorod (Fig. 5a, part I, II, and III), with a local probe diameter of 50 nm (Fig. 5b). The EDS spectra of part III (core) in Fig. 5b shows the presence of Zn, Cd and S atoms in case of ZnS and CdS. The part II of the rod also contains Zn, Cd, and S, from the EDS spectra. However, the content of the Cd obviously decrease. EDX taken on the coated layer of the core–shell nanostructure indicates that there are only two types of elements existing in part I:Zn and S. Some C and Cu peaks appear due to the TEM grid. Based on the results of EDX spectra as well as TEM, it can be confirmed that the as-obtained core–shell nanorod has the core–shell heterostructure with a CdS core and a ZnS shell.

3.4 UV-vis absorption properties

Fig. 6 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of CdS–ZnS heterostructures, as well as uncoated CdS nanorods. The value of the band gap for the uncoated CdS nanorods was calculated to be ∼2.4 eV. After coating with ZnS shell, the band edge shows a slight blue shift, which is different from the type-I CdS–ZnS,26 CdSe–ZnS27 and CdSe–CdS28 core–shell quantum dots (a thin shell around several nanometers). In these core–shell quantum dots, when a thin shell is coated on the core, the size effect allows a further delocalization of the electronic wave function and creates a red-shift of the band edge. In our case, the absorbance is found to be decreased for the CdS–ZnS sample because ZnS shell with ∼100 nm thickness can weaken the leakage of excitons from the CdS core into the ZnS shell.

3.5 Photoelectrochemical performance

Fig. 7a shows a set of linear-sweep voltammograms plots for the deposited films (CdS and CdS–ZnS) acting as photoelectrodes under dark and light illumination (AM 1.5G light of 100 mW cm−2 intensity). The dark current from −1.2 V to 0 V (vs. SCE) corresponding to both the samples were quite low (<0.2 mA cm−2), and thus negligible. Because the band gap of CdS (∼2.4 eV from UV-vis absorption spectra) enables the absorption of the visible light of the incident solar spectrum, the bare CdS nanorods film can be used as a photoelectrode in this PEC water splitting for hydrogen system. From the curve of CdS (Fig. 7a), a photocurrent was detected at −1.2 V (vs. SCE). After the applied potential reached −0.4 V versus SCE, the photocurrent became more stable. When the potential increased to 0 V versus SCE, the photo-induced current density was 1.8 mA cm−2. For the CdS–ZnS sample, the photocurrent density of CdS–ZnS core–shell heterostructure is 7.8 mA cm−2, with a significant enhancement (more than four times) compared with uncoated CdS nanorods, when the applied potential increased to 0 V versus SCE. At this point, the generated bubbles can be detected on the surface of Pt electrode, indicating that the as-prepared core–shell heterostructures is photo-active as photoelectrode in PEC cell for hydrogen production from water. In UV light range (∼5% of the entire solar illumination), ZnS was photo-excited to generate electron–hole pairs, and the photo-generated electrons present in the ZnS CB are transferred to the CdS cores. Therefore, the enhanced photocurrent density can be preliminary attributed to the supplement of photoelectrons from the ZnS shell under solar irradiation.
 Fig. 7  (a) Photocurrent density vs. potential curves obtained from PEC cells, using a uncoated CdS and a CdS–ZnS arrays and (b) photocurrent density vs. time of CdS and CdS–ZnS at a potential of −0.5 V versus SCE under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) with on/off cycles. 
An amperometric study of the CdS and CdS–ZnS nanorod arrays were further performed at an applied potential of −0.5 V (vs. SCE) under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) with on/off cycles. For direct comparison, the obtained results are displayed as a photocurrent (vs. time) curve in Fig. 7b. For the two samples, photoelectrodes display a sensitive photocurrent response under the light illumination, indicating the photocatalytic activity of the CdS nanorods array and CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorod array. Upon illumination, the photocurrent from CdS–ZnS sharply increased and a spike of photocurrent (0 s) is observed because of the transient effect in power excitation.29 Then, the photocurrent quickly returned to a steady value of 5.5 mA cm−2, indicating that photo-generated holes may oxidize sacrificial reagents (S22−) at the photoelectrode (anode), while photo-generated electrons may be transferred to the surface of the Pt electrode to reduce water, leading to the generation of a photocurrent. After the light is turned off, the photocurrent immediately disappears. The on/off light cycles of the photocurrent show good anti-photo-corrosion stability and reproducibility from the current vs. time curve. This indicates that most of the photo-generated electrons are transported to the back contact across the 1D nanorods arrays to generate photocurrent under solar illumination.30 In contrast, a low photocurrent (∼0.5 mA cm−2) with the bare CdS nanorod photoelectrode was observed at a potential of −0.5 V (vs. SCE), as shown in Fig. 7b (curve CdS).
Another important performance for the application of PEC cells is the chemical stability of the photoelectrode. Fig. 8 shows photocurrent stability (vs. time curve) of the CdS and the CdS–ZnS photoanodes at a fixed potential of −0.5 V (vs. SCE). The photocurrent decays quickly for the uncoated CdS nanorod photoanode. In contrast, the CdS–ZnS array shows improved photo-stability and maintains a photocurrent of ∼5.5 mA cm−2 after 16.7 min. It is clear that the CdS–ZnS photoelectrode presents excellent photocurrent retention ability and good chemical stability in electrolytes (S22− and SO32−). The well preserved core–shell nanorod heterostructure indicates that the ZnS shell is effective in isolating the CdS core from the electrolyte and protecting the CdS nanorod from photocorrosion.
 Fig. 8  Stability test of CdS and CdS–ZnS nanorod arrays under AM 1.5G illumination. 
To further verify the PEC mechanism of the core–shell photoelectrode, we also performed the PEC tests under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm, 100 mW cm−2), as shown in Fig. 9. In traditional view, the PEC performance of CdS–ZnS core–shell array should be considerably lower than that of the bare CdS array under visible light because the ZnS shell with large band gap can restrain the visible light absorption of the CdS core. However, the intensity of the photocurrent from the CdS–ZnS photoelectrode (4.9 mA cm−2) is considerably higher than that of the uncoated CdS photoelectrode (0.8 mA cm−2). Under visible light illumination, both the photo-excited electrons and holes of the CdS core are difficult to transfer to the ZnS shell (the higher CB and lower VB than CdS). Therefore, according to the results of PEC performance, there must be other paths for the transfer of holes from the VB of CdS to the VB of ZnS. Actually, different intrinsic defects including sulfur vacancies (VS), zinc vacancies (VZn) and interstitial sulfur (IS) in a ZnS crystal have been demonstrated by the previous reports.31 Becker et al. have confirmed that the localized acceptor states from the VZn and IS atoms are higher than the VB of ZnS.32 Furthermore, the fact that the acceptor states of VZn are higher than those of the IS has been demonstrated earlier in 1998.32 Therefore, it is undisputed to speculate that Vzn and IS (acceptor states) can act as the transfer platforms of photo-excited holes from CdS to ZnS. By comparison (two curves in Fig. 9), we find that the enhanced photocurrent density under visible light can be mainly attributed to the transfer of the holes (VB of CdS → Vzn and Is of ZnS). As mentioned above, we concluded that the Vzn and IS play considerably more important role, in our study, for the enhancement of the photocurrent than the transfer of photo-excited electrons from ZnS. Moreover, the improved stability (Fig. 8) can also be explained by the same reason. The photo-induced electron–hole separation and transportation process in the CdS–ZnS nanorod heterostructure is further illustrated in Fig. 10.

 Fig. 10  Schematic diagram of the PEC hydrogen generation process from the water with the CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorods photoelectrode under AM 1.5G illumination. 
A schematic diagram is presented in Fig. 10 to understand the mechanism of PEC hydrogen generation from water with the CdS–ZnS core–shell arrays photoelectrode. The CB/VB levels of the CdS–ZnS were identified according to the previous reports.24,33 Under solar light illumination, the ZnS shell was photo-excited to generate electron–hole pairs; the photo-generated electrons can be efficiently transferred from the CB of ZnS to the CdS core. Simultaneously, the CdS core can also photo-excite hole–electron pairs. Finally, the electrons from above two paths were transferred to the Pt electrode to reduce water for hydrogen. According to the results of Fig. 9, for the enhancement of the photocurrent density (illumination by solar as well as visible light), the existence of VZn and IS acceptor states above the CB of ZnS is more important. Based on the abovementioned two advantages, the as-prepared quasi-type II core–shell heterostructure displays efficient and stable PCE performance under one sun light irradiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), as a result of unique spatial distribution of the photo-excited charge carriers.
IPCE is an important parameter to quantitatively investigate the photoactivity in the PEC cell.34 The coated and uncoated samples were assessed using IPCE calculations at wavelengths ranging from 300 to 800 nm at −0.5 V (vs. SCE) (Fig. 11). Compared to the uncoated CdS film, the CdS–ZnS film shows an obviously enhanced IPCE value. The CdS–ZnS array achieves an IPCE of 35.2% at 300 nm, which is about 4.8 times higher than that of the uncoated CdS sample. The results are consistent for the photocurrent (Fig. 7a) as well. In conclusion, the ZnS shell around the CdS core contributes to the elevation of the electron-injection and holes-transportation efficiency in the absorption region of the CdS nanocrystal.

4 Conclusions
In summary, CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorod arrays with excellent uniformity have been successfully fabricated through a simple and efficient two-step aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) approach. Our CdS–ZnS sample yielded a high photocurrent density of 7.8 mA cm−2 with incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) values above 35% at a potential of 0 V versus SCE under AM 1.5G illumination, which is more than four times compared to the uncoated CdS sample. Interestingly, the improvements do not directly correlate with the transfer of photo-generated electrons (ZnS → CdS) in the photoelectrode. Instead, the existence of VZn and IS acceptor states above the CB of ZnS was found to be critical factors influencing the activity according to the comparison of photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance under visible light, suggesting that the as-prepared CdS–ZnS core–shell nanorod arrays has a quasi-type II structure. We believe that this design will provide advancement for the utilization of different core–shell nanomaterials in the PEC water splitting applications.
