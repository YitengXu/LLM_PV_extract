    , Accepted 9th April 2020First published on 10th April 2020AbstractThe electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has undergone great advances recently. The gas diffusion electrode (GDE) has been introduced to enhance productivity. However, the studies on catalysts on the GDE are scarce, especially for the production of liquid products. Here, we deposited Sn electrocatalysts electrochemically with dense tips (SnDT) on a gas permeable carbon cloth electrode. The prepared cathode had a uniform surface covered with SnDT catalysts. We achieved a high specific production rate of the CO2RR towards formate, 1 mmol m−2 s−1, at only −0.76 VRHE where partial current density and faradaic efficiency toward formate were −18.7 mA cm−2 and 62.5%, respectively, in neutral electrolyte. Formate productivity of 65 mg h−1 was achieved using a customized cell with 4 cm2 of the SnDT GDE. Formate was stably produced for 72 h without changes in faradaic efficiency and current density. The product distribution was affected by local pH. The effect of catalyst shape was also investigated by comparing with commercial Sn nanoparticles deposited on a carbon cloth electrode.
1. Introduction
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can convert CO2 to several value-added products.1,2 The electricity required for the CO2RR can be supplied by renewable power sources such as solar or wind power, converting intermittent energy into stable chemical bonds.3 In recent years, understanding of the CO2RR at a fundamental level has been advanced considerably through intensive investigations.4–7
Formic acid has attracted much attention as an energy carrier because it can store hydrogen with high capacity.8 Formate (equivalent to formic acid at >pH 3.8) is a promising product from the CO2RR because the reduction path to formate takes only 2 electrons, which makes the process facile and energy-efficient.9 Several electrocatalysts were reported for the selective CO2RR to formate when gaseous CO2 was bubbled through aqueous solutions. Transition metals Sn, In, Bi, Pb, Hg, and Cd exhibited catalytic activity toward formate; among them, earth abundant and non-toxic Sn catalysts have been widely studied.10
Catalytic performance of the Sn catalyst could be significantly improved by forming various nanostructures, such as nanoparticles supported on carbon black,11,12 porous nanowires,13 wires with a diameter less than 2 nm,14 oxide-derived nanostructures,15 dendrites,16 and mesoporous nanosheets.17 Fabricating Sn-based bimetallic alloys with Cu,18–20 Ag,21,22 Pd,23 Bi,24 or In25 and making composites with S26 or Se27 were also effective in producing formate selectively. Dopants, such as Ni,28 Cd, Zn, Ti, V, Nb, or Zr,29 for Sn-based materials were also suggested to improve catalytic activity.
Most studies on the CO2RR to formate have been performed with a planar electrode in a conventional H-cell.30,31 A planar electrode refers to an electrode without a gas channel, such as plate, sheet, or rotating disk type electrodes. When a planar electrode is used, CO2 is first dissolved in an aqueous electrolyte through bubbling, and then the dissolved CO2 is diffused through a long distance to the electrode surface.32 Therefore, a cell with a planar electrode typically suffers from a low current density due to low CO2 solubility in the aqueous electrolyte.33 A breakthrough in the cell configuration was made by using gas diffusion electrodes (GDE), in which gaseous CO2 could be fed directly to the electrode, thus high concentrations of CO2 can be used for the surface reactions on the catalysts.33,34 Consequently, the current density was enhanced significantly by an order of magnitude from <10 mA cm−2 in the CO2 bubbling set-up to a few tens of mA cm−2 for the liquid product in the GDE set-up with neutral pH electrolytes.35 However, electrocatalysts for the CO2RR on the GDE have been poorly studied and large overpotentials are required to achieve high current density, especially for liquid products. The various nanostructured catalysts reported in the literature were only applicable to planar electrodes. Developing electrocatalysts, which are applicable to the GDE architecture enabling high formate productivity at lower overpotentials, is urgently required.
Methods to deposit catalysts on the GDE have been studied rarely. The most commonly used method is a spraying method, where catalyst inks are prepared in advance and then sprayed on gas permeable substrates such as porous carbon films. However, additives such as polymer binders need to be mixed with the catalyst powders. Electrolyte polymer binders such as Nafion might block the surface active sites and lower selectivity.36–38 Therefore, it is desired to prepare the GDE with a large electrochemically active surface area without a polymer binder. Electrodeposition has been used to deposit nanostructured metal or metal oxide layers on various substrates.39–41 It can make the electrocatalysts firmly rooted on the substrate without any binding additives, exposing the active surface area.37 The electrodeposition conditions must be strictly controlled to prepare a uniform surface over a large area.16,39–41 In particular, the substrate needs to be properly prepared to provide seeds for electrochemical deposition and allow reliable growth.42 Electrodeposition on gas permeable electrodes might provide ideal nanostructures for the CO2RR in the GDE set-up.
Herein, we prepared Sn electrocatalysts with dense tip sites (SnDT) on a Sn thin film-coated carbon cloth (Sn/CC) electrode. The SnDT electrocatalysts were prepared using electrodeposition. A customized electrolysis cell with the GDE configuration was developed to achieve high productivity of liquid products at lower overpotentials in a continuous flow. The SnDT on the Sn/CC electrode in the customized cell exhibited high formate productivity with high stability. The effect of the SnDT structure was investigated by comparing with commercial Sn nanopowders. The relation between the selectivity of the CO2RR and local pH was also studied.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Electrode preparation

2.1.1 Sn-coated carbon cloth (Sn/CC). 
Carbon cloth (CC, CeTech) was used as a gas permeable substrate. The backside was coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) via a N2 spray until 0.3 mgPTFE cm−2 was achieved. PTFE ink was prepared by diluting PTFE solution (60%, Sigma Aldrich) into 1% in anhydrous ethyl alcohol (Sigma Aldrich). A thin film of Sn was deposited on CC under an ultra-high vacuum using an E-beam evaporator (Daeki High-Tech). Sn shots (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) were used as the Sn source. Sn was deposited until quartz crystal microbalance indicated a 100 nm thickness with a deposition rate of 0.7 Å s−1. The bulk density and Z factor for the Sn film were 7.30 g cm−3 and 0.724, respectively.


2.1.2 Sn catalysts with dense tips (SnDT) on Sn/CC. 
The Sn catalysts with dense tips (SnDT) were electrodeposited on the Sn/CC substrate. To prepare a working electrode for electrodeposition, the Sn/CC substrate was placed on a glass slide and Cu tape was used for electric contact. To expose only the Sn surface to electrolytes, the edges of the electrode were covered using epoxy adhesive (Loctite® EA 9460™). Electric bias was applied using a potentiostat (ZIVE BP2, WonATech) with a power booster (WonATech). A Hg/HgO electrode (RE-61AP, ALS) filled with 1 M NaOH (≥97.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) and a fresh Sn wire (99.99%, Nilaco) was used as a reference electrode and a counter electrode, respectively. The three electrodes were located at their fixed positions in a customized cell. The plating solution was comprised of 0.5 M Na2SnO3·3H2O (95%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.4 M NaOH (≥97.0%, Sigma-Aldrich).43 A constant potential of −4.0 VHg/HgO was applied for 80 min. Temperature was controlled to 25 °C in a water bath. Other temperatures of 0 °C and 55 °C were additionally tested. After electrodeposition, the prepared electrode was rinsed with deionized (DI) water several times and sonicated in DI water for 5 min to wash away weakly adhered species. After cleaning the surface, the electrode was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C and kept in a desiccator. Only the central area in which the epoxy adhesive was not applied was used.


2.1.3 Commercial Sn nanopowders (SnNP) on carbon cloth. 
Commercial Sn nanopowders (SnNP, diameter <150 nm, ≥99% Sigma Aldrich) were also investigated as a control catalyst. The catalyst ink was prepared by dispersing 160 mg of nanopowders in 20 ml of anhydrous ethyl alcohol with or without 10% Nafion® ionomer aqueous solution (Sigma Aldrich). The Nafion content was 10 wt% or 30 wt%. The catalyst ink was gently sprayed onto the carbon cloth located on a hot plate (80 °C) using a N2 spray. The amount of catalyst loading for each electrode was estimated by comparing the weight of the electrodes before and after catalyst deposition and confirmed by inductively coupled plasma – mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) measurements.

2.2 Electrochemical analysis

2.2.1 Electrochemical CO2 reduction. 
A customized electrolysis cell was built with a GDE configuration for the working electrode. The scheme is shown in Fig. S1.† Electrochemical analyses were performed with a conventional three electrode setup. An Ag/AgCl electrode (3M NaCl, BASi) was used as a reference electrode and an Ir sheet (99.8%, Alfa Aesar) was used as a counter electrode. The cathode and the anode chambers were separated using a Nafion proton exchange membrane (Nafion® 212). Voltage was applied to the cell using a potentiostat (ZIVE BP2, WonATech) with a power booster (WonATech). Both the electrodes had an identical geometric area of 4 cm2. The geometric area of the membrane was 9 cm2. The electrolyte was CO2-saturated 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 M KHCO3(aq) (≥99.95%, Sigma Aldrich) for the catholyte and 1.0 M H2SO4(aq) (99.999%, Sigma Aldrich) for the anolyte. The high purity of the catholyte was confirmed with ICP-MS. Metal impurities (Fe, Ni, and Cu) were less than 1 μg L−1 in total. Co, Zn, Ag, Pd, Pt, and Au species were not detected with the detection limit at the level of ng L−1. The volumes of the catholyte and the anolyte were 10.5 ml and 7.5 ml, respectively. For prolonged tests, 250 ml of the catholyte was circulated with a flow rate of 4 ml min−1 using a peristaltic pump (BT101S, Lead Fluid). A magnetic stir bar continuously stirred the catholyte in the cathode chamber during the electrolysis. The incoming CO2 feed (99.999%) was dry and its flow rate was 50 sccm. Gaseous CO2 flowed through a flow channel. The outgoing gas from the gas chamber and from the catholyte chamber were combined and the composition was measured. Liquid products were collected in only the catholyte. Every point on the polarization curves was obtained after 30 min of potentiostatic operations at each potential. Voltage was referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) following eqn (1), with a 85% compensated iR drop. The pH values of the catholytes are described in Table S1.† VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + V0Ag/AgCl(1)


2.2.2 Product analysis. 
Gaseous products were identified and quantified using an online gas chromatograph (GC; Micro GC Fusion, Inficon) equipped with Rt-Molecular Sieve 5A and Rt-Q-Bond columns and thermal conductivity detectors. Liquid products were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC; YL9100, Youglin) equipped with a Hi-plex H column (Agilent) and a refractive index detector.


2.2.3 Electrochemical surface area (ECSA) estimation. 
ECSAs of the electrodes were estimated by double layer capacitance (CDL) measurements in CO2-saturated 1.0 M KHCO3(aq) electrolyte after CO2RR operations. A potentiostat (CHI 760E, CH Instruments) was used for capacitance measurements. Specific capacitances (CS) were measured using a polished Sn foil (4 cm2, Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%), assuming that the electrode surfaces were atomically smooth. The Sn foil was polished with 0.05 μm sized alumina oxide powders (MicroPolish™, Buehler). CDL values for each electrode were estimated using cyclic voltammetry cycles with various scan rates. Geometric areas of the electrodes were 4 cm2. The ECSA was calculated using eqn (2). ECSA = CDL/CS(2)

2.3 Characterization
The electrocatalysts were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and ICP-MS. The morphologies of the electrodes were observed using field emission SEM (Magellan 400, FEI) at 20 kV acceleration voltage. The crystal structure was identified using powder XRD (SmartLab, Rigaku) with Cu K-alpha X-ray. The surface was analyzed using XPS (K-alpha, Thermo VG Scientific). The morphology of SnNP was investigated using field emission TEM (Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, FEI). High resolution TEM images of SnDT were obtained using Cs corrected TEM (Titan cubed G2 60-300, FEI) Catalyst loading amounts and impurities in catalysts and electrolyte were investigated using ICP-MS (iCAP RQ, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
3. Results and discussion
GDE cathodes decorated with Sn electrocatalysts were prepared to produce formate from the CO2RR with high productivity. A brief scheme of the procedures to prepare the electrode is shown in Fig. 1(a). The GDE consisted of a gas-permeable carbon cloth (CC) backbone and nanostructured Sn on the surface. The backside of the CC substrate was coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to prevent electrolyte flooding. A thin Sn film was deposited first on the CC substrate using an E-beam evaporator to cover the carbon surface with Sn. A dense Sn domain was observed on the surface of CC as shown in Fig. S2† and we denoted it as Sn/CC. The Sn size distribution is displayed in Fig. S1(c),† and the average domain size was 207.7 nm ± 180.5 nm. After depositing Sn on the CC surface using an E-beam evaporator, Sn was further electrodeposited on the Sn/CC at room temperature. Basic plating solution was used for the electrodeposition to preserve the Sn thin film of Sn/CC and achieve high uniformity over a large area. Fig. S3† shows the transient current density during the electrodeposition. The current density increased for initial 40 min and then plateaued. The resulting structure is shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c). The Sn catalysts were uniformly deposited with dense tip structures (SnDT) over the whole electrode area (>6 cm2). A HR-TEM image and the corresponding EDS mapping images for a tip site are shown in Fig. S4.† The SnO2 native oxide layer was observed on the metallic Sn. The thickness of the oxide layer was 4.1 nm. The Sn electrodeposition was not uniform on bare CC without the Sn layer coating but rather induced an irregular shape, as shown in Fig. S5.† The woven structure of CC disturbed nucleation of Sn on the carbon surface, whereas the Sn thin layer on CC enabled easier Sn nucleation from electrodeposition and uniform evolution to the SnDT structure.

The temperature of the plating solution was important in controlling the morphology of the Sn nanostructures. When the temperature was 0 °C, there was a massive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the electrode rather than Sn deposition. When the temperature was 55 °C, the surface was flatter than that of the electrode prepared at 25 °C. The SEM images of each electrode at different electrodeposition temperatures are shown in Fig. S6.† The gas-permeable and water-proof electrode could be prepared with SnDT electrocatalysts and hierarchical pores. The XRD result in Fig. 1(d) shows that the electrode consisted of metallic Sn, but XPS spectra in Fig. 1(e) show that there is an oxide layer on SnDT probably due to exposure to air, in accordance with TEM analysis results in Fig. S4.† Metallic Sn with a native oxide layer, which is less than 5 nm thick, is known to be selective to formate production.44,45Fig. 1(f) shows a photograph of the SnDT electrode.
Electrochemical CO2 reduction experiments were performed with a customized cell which was designed to collect liquid products. The scheme of the electrochemical system can be found in Fig. S1.† CO2 gas was flown to the backside of the GDE and diffused to the SnDT surface. Fig. S7† shows the effect of various degrees of iR compensation. 85% of iR compensation was chosen to avoid over-compensation. The gas products were analyzed with online gas chromatography (GC). The liquid products were uniformly dispersed inside the catholyte by magnetic stirring and analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The cathode chamber and the anode chamber were divided by a proton exchange membrane (Nafion® 212) to prevent crossover and re-oxidation of the formate anion. Proton crossover was negligible when the concentration of KHCO3 was larger than 0.1 M as shown in Table S1.† When an anion exchange membrane (Sustainion®) was used instead, the crossover and re-oxidation of the formate on the anode were observed.46,47 CO2 absorbed by the catholyte would be released inside the catholyte chamber and the effluent gas from the catholyte, which contained CO2 and gas products, was recombined with the outgoing gas from the gas chamber, then the gas composition and faradaic efficiency were measured from this total gas outlet.46,47 The area of the membrane (9 cm2) was larger than the geometric area of the working and the counter electrodes (4 cm2, respectively) to minimize the resistivity of charge transfer through the membrane. The electrode decorated with commercial Sn nanopowder (SnNP) catalysts was also tested for comparison. The morphology of the SnNP is shown in Fig. S8.†
With the SnDT electrocatalysts on the customized GDE cell, formate was produced in high productivity as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) shows that SnDT has a specific production rate of 1 mmol m−2 s−1 at only −0.76 VRHE, while SnNP showed only less than 0.4 mmol m−2 s−1 at the same overpotential. The overall cell voltage was 4.05 V under this condition due to additional anodic overpotentials and ohmic loss from the aqueous electrolyte.33,38 We used the electrode with an active geometric area of 4 cm2; this value is quite large compared to the literature values.14–17 The specific production rate might be overestimated if the electrode size is too small. Fig. S9† shows that the productivity of our customized GDE cell is 65 mg h−1 for SnDT and 25 mg h−1 for SnNP at −0.76 VRHE. The productivity increased further rapidly as the voltage increased. The productivity of SnDT was 188 mg h−1 at −0.84 VRHE. Table S2† shows the formate productivity with a unit of mg h−1 reported in various literature studies. The SnDT electrode showed high formate productivity at lower overpotentials.

(b) Formate concentrations in the circulated catholyte and (c) specific production rate and product distributions during a prolonged CO2RR with the SnDT GDE at −0.76 VRHE for 72 h. The catholyte was CO2-saturated 1 M KHCO3(aq) under circulation and the anolyte was 1 M H2SO4(aq). Ir sheet anode and a Nafion® 212 membrane were used. The geometric area of the GDE was 4 cm2. 
The durability of SnDT catalysts in the CO2RR was examined at a fixed voltage of −0.76 VRHE. For the prolonged test, 250 ml of CO2-saturated 1 M KHCO3 catholyte was circulated and the liquid product was stored in the catholyte. The concentration of formate increased linearly as shown in Fig. 2(b). The productivity towards formate and product distributions barely changed for 72 h, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The SEM image and XRD pattern in Fig. S10† show that the SnDT nanostructure barely changed after the CO2RR for 72 h. Any change in the crystal phase or deposited impurities were not observed. When the current density was larger than −100 mA cm−2, precipitated KHCO3 crystals were observed on the backside of the GDE within 24 h for both SnDT and SnNP electrodes, as reported.48
Electrocatalytic performance for the CO2RR on the SnDT GDE was further investigated in a stagnant CO2-saturated 1 M KHCO3(aq) buffer catholyte as shown in Fig. 3. A higher current density with a lower overpotential was observed on the SnDT compared to the SnNP as shown in Fig. 3(a). The bare CC substrate without Sn catalysts had negligible electrocatalytic activity under this condition. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of each electrode was estimated from double layer capacitance measurements as shown in Fig. S11.†49,50 The specific capacitance for Sn was estimated as 0.033 mF cm−2 using a polished Sn foil in CO2-saturated 1 M KHCO3 as shown in Fig. S12.† The ECSAs of the SnDT and SnNP electrodes were 82.7 cm2 and 59.7 cm2, respectively. When the current density was normalized by the ECSA, a higher current density was still observed on the SnDT compared to the commercial SnNP as shown in Fig. S13(a).† Also, the Tafel slope was estimated from the ECSA-normalized partial current density towards formate as described in Fig. S13(b).† The lower Tafel slope of 249 mV per decade was obtained for SnDT, compared to 726 mV per decade obtained for SnNP. The Sn loading of the SnDT electrode was 17.5 mg cm−2. However, the Sn loading in the SnNP electrode could not be higher than 13 mg cm−2. The particles were too weakly bound to the electrode and can be easily detached when a higher loading was attempted. The highest possible loading was desired in the SnNP because a higher SnNP loading resulted in a higher current density and selectivity, as shown in Fig. S14.† When the SnDT with the same catalyst mass (13 mg cm−2) was tested, the SnDT still exhibited a higher current density than the SnNP, as shown in Fig. S15.† The SnDT with a lower amount of loading was prepared by just reducing the electrodeposition time. No significant difference in CO2RR activities or product distributions was observed on the SnDT electrode with a reduced loading amount of 13 mg cm–2.

Bare CC substrate exhibited negligible current density. (b–d) Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward formate, CO, and H2 respectively. The catholyte was stagnant CO2-saturated 1 M KHCO3(aq) and the anolyte was 1 M H2SO4(aq). Ir sheet anode and a Nafion® 212 membrane were used. The geometric area of the GDE was 4 cm2. 
It is known that local electric fields near sharp tips are enhanced due to migration of electrons towards the sharp tips on the nanostructured metal surface.26,51 The increased electric fields concentrates metal cations near the tip sites, tuning the coverage of adsorbed CO2RR intermediates on the catalyst surface.51–53 This often leads to enhanced CO2RR activities. The dense tips on the SnDT electrode contributed to the enhanced CO2RR current density.
The electrode with the SnDT catalysts did not contain any polymeric ionomer or binder that could block the active surface and lower selectivity. For a fair comparison, the ionomer was not added in the SnNP electrode either for the works shown above. The SnNPs were deposited on the CC substrate with the Nafion ionomer and their CO2RR performance was tested as shown in Fig. S16.† The ionomer initially helped to increase the current density, but excess ionomer rather decreased the current density, in accordance with previous reports.54 The Nafion ionomer lowered the selectivity toward formate and instead increased the parasitic HER. The ionomer increased local H+ concentrations and the HER became facile.54 The morphology of the SnNP electrodes with or without the ionomer is shown in Fig. S17.† When no ionomer was added, the SnNP particles were deposited among threads of carbon cloth. When the ionomer was added, the catalysts were deposited on the outermost surface. The ECSA of the SnNP electrode prepared with 10% ionomer increased slightly to 69.4 cm2.

Fig. 3(b) shows faradaic efficiency toward formate production. The CO2RR towards formate production was the most predominant path on both SnDT and SnNP electrodes because the Sn surface is known to have near optimum binding energy to *OCHO, which is a key intermediate to produce formate.55 On the other hand, the bare CC substrate exhibited nearly 100% selectivity toward the HER. Only negligible selectivity (less than 1%) toward CO or formate was observed at highly negative potentials as shown in Fig. S18.† The SnDT showed a higher faradaic efficiency to formate, compared to the SnNP. While faradaic efficiency towards formate reached 60% on the SnNP electrode and plateaued at higher overpotentials above −0.8 VRHE, it increased up to 68.1% on the SnDT electrode. Fig. 3(c) and (d) show faradaic efficiency to CO and H2, respectively. CO was produced more on the SnDT compared to the SnNP. Faradaic efficiency towards CO increased up to 30% on the SnDT as the voltage decreased and it plateaued, but it was lower than 10% on the SnNP. When comparing C1 selectivity (formate + CO) of the CO2RR we observed that it reached 91% on the SnDT and 69% on the SnNP at −30 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. S19.† The SnNP produced H2 more rather than CO. Because the HER is thermodynamically and kinetically more facile than the CO2RR, the HER was dominant at low overpotentials up to −0.5 VRHE on both the SnDT and SnNP. However, as the overpotential increased, the HER decreased on the SnDT rapidly, but SnNP still produced significant H2 with faradaic efficiency about 30%.
Local pH difference near the electrode surface between SnDT and SnNP might have affected the selectivity of the reactions.12 The rate-limiting step for formate production is a reaction of physisorbed CO2 with surface *H, which would occur more at lower pH values.56 The competing HER is also pH-dependent; the HER occurs more at lower pH values.57 The limiting step for CO production is a conversion of physisorbed CO2 to chemisorbed *CO2δ−, which is pH-independent.56 Thus, both formate production and the HER are highly sensitive to pH, whereas CO production is less sensitive to pH.12,56,58 Local pH near the cathode surface increases during the CO2RR, especially at the nanostructured surface, due to sluggish mass transfer of ions.17,41,59 Therefore, the SnDT GDE surface with dense tips had a higher local pH value compared to the SnNP GDE. The higher local pH increased CO selectivity and suppressed the HER on the SnDT, resulting in higher C1 selectivity (Fig. S19†). The suppression of the HER with the increase of CO2 conversion in the proton-deficient environment contributed to higher productivity of formate, as shown in Fig. 2(a).
To further investigate the local pH effect on the SnDT GDE, different concentrations of bicarbonate buffers were tested as shown in Fig. 4. The current density increased as the concentration of buffer solution increased because bicarbonate ions in the catholyte can deliver CO2(aq) to the catalyst surface through rapid equilibrium.60 The buffer minimizes local pH changes, keeping the local pH close to bulk pH. A lower concentration of buffer solution would induce a higher local pH value at the catalyst surface during the CO2RR. Higher formate selectivity was observed at higher buffer concentrations, until 1 M KHCO3, since protons were required to produce formate. The highest selectivity to formate was obtained in 1 M KHCO3 solution although the HER also increased slightly. However, in 2 M KHCO3, proton reduction to the HER was favored too much rather than the reaction with the adsorbed CO2, due to the rich proton concentration, which made the selectivity to formate lower. Fig. S20† shows the detailed data for the CO2RR including faradaic efficiencies and partial current densities at different overpotentials and various concentrations of the buffer solution.

The catholyte was stagnant CO2-saturated KHCO3(aq) with 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 M concentrations, and the anolyte was 1 M H2SO4(aq). Ir sheet anode and a Nafion® 212 membrane were used. The geometric area of the GDE was 4 cm2. Each point was obtained from 30 min of potentiostatic operations. 
4. Conclusions
Sn electrocatalysts with dense tips (SnDT) were prepared on gas-permeable carbon cloth to prepare a GDE. The carbon cloth was first coated with a thin Sn layer using an E-beam evaporator and then Sn was additionally deposited by electrodeposition forming densely populated tip sites. The uniform SnDT GDE could be prepared without any polymer binder. The customized CO2RR cell could produce formate with a high specific production rate of 1 mmol m−2 s−1 and a high productivity of 65 mg h−1 at a low voltage of −0.76 VRHE. The formate production could occur stably for 72 h without degradation. When the SnDT GDE was compared to the GDE prepared with commercial Sn nanopowders, the SnDT GDE showed a much higher current density and C1 selectivity (formate + CO) because the former had a higher ECSA and its tip structure induced facile CO2RR suppressing the competing HER. This work can stimulate the development of better CO2RR electrocatalysts suitable for GDE applications, possibly leading to industrial applications.
