surface-confined architecturesAndrew N. Shipway and Itamar Willner*Institute of Chemistry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, 91904, Israel.. E-mail: willnea@vms.huji.ac.ilReceived  (in Cambridge, UK) 12th June 2001, Accepted 22nd August 2001First published on 1st October 2001AbstractThe nanoscale engineering of functional chemical assemblies 
has attracted recent research effort to provide dense information storage, 
miniaturized sensors, efficient energy conversion, light-harvesting, and 
mechanical motion. Functional nanoparticles exhibiting unique photonic, 
electronic and catalytic properties provide invaluable building blocks for 
such nanoengineered architectures. Metal nanoparticle arrays crosslinked by 
molecular receptor units on electrodes act as selective sensing interfaces 
with controlled porosity and tunable sensitivity. 
Photosensitizer/electron-acceptor bridged arrays of Au-nanoparticles on 
conductive supports act as photoelectrochemically active electrodes. 
Semiconductor nanoparticle composites on surfaces act as efficient light 
collecting systems, and nanoengineered semiconductor 
‘core–shell’ nanocrystal assemblies reveal enhanced 
photoelectrochemical performance due to effective charge separation. 
Layered metal and semiconductor nanoparticle arrays crosslinked by nucleic 
acids find applications in the optical, electronic and photoelectrochemical 
detection of DNA. Metal and semiconductor nanoparticles assembled on DNA 
templates may be used to generate complex electronic circuitry. 
Nanoparticles incorporated in hydrogel matrices yield new composite 
materials with novel magnetic, optical and electronic properties.IntroductionIncreasing interest is directed to miniaturization and the nanoscale 
engineering of functional chemical assemblies.1 The development of nanoscale devices will provide 
dense information storage, ultra-small sensing units, and data processing 
elements of reduced dimensions. Another important aspect of miniaturization 
to the nanoscale is the breakdown of macroscopic properties and the 
emergence of quantum-level phenomena.2 Metal 
and semiconductor nanoparticles exhibit unique properties and provide 
important building blocks for the construction of functional 
structures.3 Nanoparticles can be 
synthesized from a variety of materials with controllable sizes, shapes and 
morphologies.4 The electronic properties of 
nanoparticles, which may be tuned by the particle dimensions, give rise to 
unique absorbance and emission features.5 
The confined electrons in nanoparticles smaller than the wavelength of 
light give rise to plasmon excitons.6 
Nanoparticles also offer catalytic properties that differ from the bulk 
material properties, due to their high surface-area, high edge 
concentration and unusual electronic properties.7 This has led to the application of modified 
nanoparticles in enantioselective catalysis8 
and electrocatalysis on surfaces.9The surface modification of nanoparticles by functional monolayers or 
polymer ‘shells’, provides a means to generate composite 
materials with tunable surface properties (e.g. wettability, 
hydrophobicity, polymerizable units, photosensitive sites or molecular 
recognition properties).10 In addition, the 
surface functionalization of nanoparticles allows their covalent 
attachment, self-assembly and organization on surfaces.11 The engineering of nanoparticle surfaces has led 
to the construction of nanoparticle dimers and trimers,12,13 controlled aggregates,14,15 wires16 
ordered monolayers17 and 
multilayers.18 The integration of 
functional nanoparticles with surfaces has enabled the organization of 
nanoscale devices19 including 
single-electron devices.20 In this account 
we focus on the use of modified nanoparticles as structural or functional 
units in the assembly of composite structures on surfaces. We address the 
use of the nanoengineered architectures as high surface-area conductive 
matrices, as optical indicators, and as semiconductor composites for 
photoelectrochemical functions. We discuss the use of surface-confined 
architectures for sensoric and photoelectrochemical applications and focus 
on the tailoring of composite materials with novel electronic properties. 
We also introduce the conjugation of nucleic acids with nanoparticles for 
the development of DNA sensors and complex electronic circuits.Nanoparticle multilayers in sensing applicationsThe use of metal nanoparticles as conductive elements in electrochemical 
sensing interfaces has been approached in several different ways. One 
direction involves the use of gold nanoparticles to contact biocatalysts 
either by the fabrication of nanoparticle–enzyme conjugates21 or by the sequential immobilization of the 
nanoparticles and the biomaterial.22 The 
small size of the nanoparticles not only gives a conductive matrix, but 
also enables them to approach the redox sites of some enzymes closely 
enough to provide electrical communication between the enzyme redox-center 
and the electrode, without the need for a diffusional electron mediator. 
The conductivity of metal nanoparticles also allows their use as gas 
sensors. Thin films of gold nanoparticles held apart by long chain thiols 
demonstrate a conductivity that is strongly dependant on gas vapors.23 The vapors are absorbed by the 
nanoparticle–thiol matrix, modulating the conductivity of the film 
(as is also the case in carbon black–polymer composites24).A series of sensors has been developed using Au-nanoparticle multilayers 
crosslinked by molecular host components. Scheme 
1 outlines the general method for the construction of the 
multilayer Au-nanoparticle structures. First, a conductive glass support is 
functionalized with a thin film of 3-(aminopropyl)siloxane to yield a 
positively charged interface. The electrostatic binding of the negatively 
charged citrate-stabilized Au-nanoparticles (12 ± 1 nm diameter) 
yields the first layer of Au-nanoparticles.25 Treatment of the negatively charged interface 
with the tetracationic cyclophanes cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) 
126 or 
cyclobis(paraquat-p-biphenylene) 2,27 the bipyridinium salts 3 or 4, 
or the octacationic Pd(II)-macrocycle 5,28 results in the electrostatic association of the 
molecular host components. Further interaction of the assembly with the 
citrate-capped Au-nanoparticles yields the second layer of nanoparticles, 
and by the alternating treatment of the system with the oligocationic 
molecular crosslinker and the nanoparticles, an architecture of the desired 
thickness may be constructed. The crosslinking units need not necessarily 
be molecules. Analogous results have been obtained using charged 
polymers,29 other nanoparticles30 and even biomaterials.31 Similarly, covalently linked multilayers can be 
constructed using gold-binding bisthiol molecules as crosslinkers.32 Scheme 1  Method for the construction of oligocation-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle 
multilayers by electrostatic interactions. The first nanoparticle layer is 
formed by the interaction of a nanoparticle solution with an 
amine-functionalized surface. Fig. 1 shows the characterization of 
1–5 layers of gold nanoparticles crosslinked by the tetracationic 
cyclophane cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) 1. The 
absorbance spectra [Fig. 1(A)] show the 
characteristic plasmon absorbance of the gold nanoparticles at ca. 
520 nm,33 and as more layers are added, an 
additional absorbance appears at longer wavelengths as a consequence of 
interparticle plasmon coupling.34 
Electrochemical analysis of the gold surface [Fig. 
1(B)] and the cyclophane crosslinking units [Fig. 1(C)] demonstrate the almost linear buildup of 
the structure on the conductive support. The fact that the nanoparticles 
and crosslinker continue to be electrochemically active throughout the 
crosslinked structure, demonstrates that the array is both porous and 
conductive. Coulometric assay of the electrical responses of the 
Au-nanoparticles and the bipyridinium units, indicates that the average 
surface coverage of the Au-nanoparticles per layer is ca. 1 
× 1013 particles cm−2 and that 
ca. 100 units of 1 are associated with each 
Au-nanoparticle in the 3D structure. Fig. 1  (A) Absorbance spectra of a glass slide after (a–e) the deposition 
of 1–5 1-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle treatments. (B) Cyclic 
voltammograms of the Au-surface of 1-crosslinked assemblies 
containing (a–e) 1–5 layers of Au-nanoparticles. (C) Cyclic 
voltammograms of 1 in (a–e) 1–5 layer arrays of 
1-crosslinked Au-nanoparticles. The crosslinker 1 acts as a π-acceptor and is capable of 
forming π donor–acceptor complexes.35 Thus, the association of electroactive 
π-donor substrates to the π-acceptor receptor sites, together with 
the 3D conductivity of the nanoparticle architecture, enables 
electrochemical sensing of the substrates. The cavity of 1 is 
suited to bind p-hydroquinone 6 and other hydroquinone 
derivatives such as dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 7, dopamine 
8 and adrenaline 9. All of these substrates can be 
electrochemically sensed by the 1-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle 
architectures assembled on the conductive glass supports.36 The sensitivity of the functionalized electrodes 
is controlled by the number of nanoparticle layers in the structures.Fig. 2(A) shows the electrochemical 
analysis of p-hydroquinone 6 by a 5-layer 
1-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle-functionalized electrode. The 
sensitivity limit for the sensing of 6 was estimated to be 1 
μM. The substrate could not be electrochemically detected in this 
concentration range by a 5-layer Au-nanoparticle architecture crosslinked 
by the dicationic N,N′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium unit 
3. These results clearly indicate that the electrochemical sensing 
of 6 does not originate from the increase in the surface roughness 
of the electrode, but rather from the concentration of 6 in the 
receptor sites by supramolecular interactions. Fig. 
2(B) exemplifies the electrochemical detection of adrenaline 
9 by the 1-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle array. The 
electrochemical oxidation of 9 associated with the receptor-sites 
reveals a broad irreversible wave that leads to a cyclic product that 
exhibits a reversible-redox response (wave x). The latter wave may act as 
an indicator for the concentration of adrenaline in the system [Fig. 2(B) inset]. Fig. 2  (A) Cyclic voltammograms for the sensing of hydroquinone 6 
(1–30 μM) by a 5-layer 1-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle 
array. Inset: calibration curve for the sensing of 6. (B) The 
sensing of adrenaline 9 (1–40 μM) by the array. [Wave (x) 
corresponds to the redox response of an electrocyclized product originating 
from the oxidized 9] Inset: calibration curve for the sensing of 
9. The specificity of sensing by the Au-nanoparticle array is controlled by 
changing the structure of the crosslinking receptor units.37 A three-dimensional array of Au-nanoparticles 
was constructed using the enlarged cyclophane, 
cyclobis(paraquat-p-biphenylene) 2, Scheme 1. This larger receptor accommodates 
bishydroxymethylferrocene 10 as a guest. Fig. 3(A) shows the analysis of 10 (1 
× 10−6 M) by the 2-crosslinked 
Au-nanoparticle electrodes with different numbers of crosslinked 
Au-nanoparticle layers. As the number of layers increases, the electrical 
response of 10 is enhanced, demonstrating tunable sensitivity of 
the nanostructured layered electrode. Fig. 
3(B) shows the amperometric responses of the Au-nanoparticle array 
upon the sensing of different concentrations of 10. The resulting 
receptor-crosslinked arrays also reveal selectivity. While 10 is 
electrochemically sensed by a 2-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle 
structure, the receptor 2 is too large to accommodate 
p-hydroquinone 6 in its cavity. Similarly, the 
1-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle assembly is unable to accommodate 
10, but does associate with p-hydroquinone, which is 
electrochemically sensed [Fig. 3(C)]. 
Selectivity is also observed upon the sensing of p-hydroquinone 
6 by the Pd(II)-square, 5-crosslinked 
Au-nanoparticle structure that is unable to detect the isomer 
o-hydroquinone. The selective sensing of 6 by the 
oligocationic macrocycle was attributed to the diagonal association of 
6 to the Pd(II)-receptor, that is not possible for the 
ortho isomer.38 Fig. 3  (A) Cyclic voltammograms for the sensing of 10 (1 μM) with 
(a–f) 0–5 layers of 2-crosslinked Au-nanoparticles. 
(B) The sensing of 10 (a–f = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.5 and 3.0 
μM, respectively) by a 5-layer 2-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle 
array. (C) Cyclic voltammograms of 5-layer electrodes constructed using 
cyclophanes 1 (curve a) and 2 (curve b) as crosslinkers 
in the presence of 10 (1 μM). Receptor-modified Au-nanoparticles were also assembled on the gate 
interface of an ion-sensitive field-effect-transistor (ISFET).39 A 1-functionalized Au-nanoparticle 
ISFET device was found to effectively detect adrenaline, serotonin and 
dopamine. Since the ISFET gate-potential is controlled by the charge 
associated with the interface, the detection of receptor-bound substrates 
is not limited to electroactive species.Nanoparticle multilayers in photoelectrochemical 
applicationsThe high surface-area, porous and conductive properties of 
Au-nanoparticle arrays can be exploited for the construction of 
photoelectrochemically active superstructures. Fig. 
4(A) and (B) show absorbance spectra and cyclic voltammograms of a 
gold nanoparticle multilayer architecture ‘crosslinked’ by the 
hexacationic catenane 11.40 This 
catenane consists of noncovalently bound ruthenium tris(bipyridine) 
(photosensitizer) and bipyridinium (electron acceptor) groups.41 The absorbance spectra show similar features to 
those of other molecule-crosslinked gold nanoparticle arrays, as well as an 
additional absorbance at 425 nm that is attributed to the ruthenium 
tris(bipyridinium) chromophore. Coulometric assay of the cyclic 
voltammograms corresponding to the bipyridinium crosslinking units reveals 
an almost linear increase in the surface coverage of the crosslinking units 
upon the build-up of the layers. The derived surface coverage of 
11 per layer is 3.6 × 10−12 mol 
cm−2 and it has been estimated that on average 
ca. 45 units of the photosensitizer/acceptor crosslinker are 
associated with each Au-nanoparticle. Irradiation of the 
11-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle multilayer array results in the 
photocurrent action spectra shown in Fig. 
5(A), which follows the absorbance features of the 
Ru(II)–tris(bipyridinium) chromophore. The photocurrent 
increases upon the build-up of the array and is reversibly cycled between 
‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ states upon switching the light on 
and off, respectively. Fig. 5(B) shows the 
dependence of the photocurrent intensity on an applied potential. The 
photocurrent decreases as the potential is negatively shifted and it is 
blocked at a potential where the bipyridinium units are reduced to the 
radical cation. This observation led to the conclusion that the 
photocurrent originates from the primary electron transfer quenching of the 
excited Ru(II)–tris(bipyridine) chromophore by the 
bipyridinium electron acceptor. The reduced acceptor acts as an electron 
mediator for charge injection into the electrode, Fig. 5(C). Upon the electrochemical reduction of the 
bipyridinium units, intramolecular electron transfer quenching is inhibited 
and photocurrent generation is blocked. The nanoengineered electrode 
operated at a quantum efficiency of 1 × 10−4 in the 
generation of the photocurrent. A related nanoparticle engineered electrode 
for photocurrent generation using Zn(II)-protoporphyrin 
IX–bis(bipyridinium) photosensitizer–electron acceptor 
(12) as a crosslinker has also been developed.42 Fig. 4  (A) Absorbance spectra of (a–d) 1–4 layer Au-nanoparticle

and 5-layer 11-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle arrays.  Fig. 5  (A) Photocurrent action spectra (a–d) obtained from 0-, 1-, 3- and

generation of a photocurrent from a photosensitizer(s)–bipyridinium 
dyad-crosslinked Au-nanoparticle superstructure. Photoelectrochemical electrodes based on semiconductor nanoparticles 
offer many advantages in the organization of energy conversion and storage 
cells. The ability to process, engineer and chemically functionalize 
semiconductor nanoparticles, enables the control of the properties and 
functions of the resulting photoelectrochemical cells. The use of 
nanoparticle-functionalized electrodes for photoelectrochemical 
applications has been reviewed in depth,43 
and the development and commercialization of solar cells based on 
photosensitizer/TiO2 nanoparticle structures44 represent recent advances in the field. Also, a 
large number of diverse nanoparticle-based electroluminescent devices have 
been investigated.45 The tuning of the 
band-gap energies and redox properties of the energy levels by controlling 
the nanoparticle dimensions allows the tailoring of multicomponent systems 
that reveal new functionalities as a result of interparticle electronic 
coupling, and interparticle electron or energy transfer.46 One example of such a system would be a 
nanoparticle-based ‘luminescent collector’.47 This is a device consisting of a thin sheet of 
material doped with dyes that absorb ambient light and re-emit it within 
the material where it is trapped by internal reflection. In order to 
collect a high proportion of the incident radiation, several chromophores 
with complementary absorption bands are required. Previous designs have led 
to problems of finding sets of organic dyes with this complementarity as 
well as the necessary processing and stability properties,48 but nanoparticles may offer a feasible 
alternative.Interparticle energy transfer between nanoparticles of the same 
substance but of different sizes exemplifies how multiparticle systems 
might find applications. It has been shown that both for indium 
phosphide49 and cadmium selenide50 nanoparticles, energy transfer from smaller to 
larger particles takes place within composite films. Fig. 6 shows absorbance and emission spectra of a 
4∶1 mixture of 2.8 and 3.7 nm-diameter CdSe nanoparticles that were 
prepared in highly monodisperse samples by selective precipitation. In a 
dilute solution (curve a), the emissions of both nanoparticles are seen, 
but in a close-packed film (curve b), energy transfer takes place and 
emission only from the larger particles is observed. Fig. 6  Absorbance (----) and emission spectra of a 4∶1 mixture of 2.8 nm 
and 3.7 nm InP ‘quantum dots’ (a) in solution, and (b) in a 
close-packed film. Extensive recent research effort has been directed towards the assembly 
of composite nanocrystalline semiconductor films to enhance the activity of 
photoelectrochemical cells. The coupling of a large bandgap semiconductor 
with a smaller bandgap semiconductor not only extends the photoresponse of 
the system to longer wavelengths but also facilitates charge separation. 
The photogenerated electrons and holes are trapped into different 
particles, and the interparticle interface acts as a barrier for the 
recombination of the intermediate redox species. Fig. 
7(A) shows the energetics of a SnO2/CdSe 
nanocrystalline film assembled on an OTE electrode.51 This photoelectrochemical electrode was found to 
operate at an efficiency of 2.25% (Isc
≈ 30 μA 
cm−2; Voc = 0.5–0.6 V; ff = 
0.47), higher than for nanocrystalline CdS alone. The enhanced 
photoelectrochemical activity of the composite film is attributed to the 
charge rectification resulting from interparticle electron transfer. The 
role of coupled systems in enhancing charge separation has been 
demonstrated in other systems such as ZnO/CdS52 and TiO2/CdS.53 Photosensitization of nanocrystalline composites 
results in charge rectification and facilitates the collection of the 
injected electrons by the electrode. Fig. 
7(B) shows a ‘core–shell’ nanocomposite of 
TiO2 coated with Nb2O5. Photoejection of 
electrons from an excited dye 
[cis-di(isothiocyanato)-N-bis(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2-b
ipyridine)ruthenium(II)] to the Nb2O5 
conduction-band followed by electron transfer to the TiO2 
conduction band results in the rectification effect. The recombination of 
the ‘core’ conduction-band electrons with the oxidized dye are 
retarded by means of the Nb2O5
‘shell’.54 This charge 
separation improves the photoelectrochemical performance of the cell as 
compared to the TiO2/dye system (maximum power of the 
TiO2/Nb2O5/dye cell is 4.70 mW 
cm−2 as compared to 3.45 mW cm−2 for the 
TiO2/dye cell). Similar results have been observed for other 
photosensitized nanocrystalline systems.55 Fig. 7  (A) Suppression of charge recombination in a coupled 
SnO2/CdSe system. (B) Charge separation upon photosensitization 
of a TiO2/Nb2O5 core–shell 
semiconductor nanocomposite electrode. DNA-linked nanoparticle superstructuresThe study of DNA–nanoparticle conjugates has received special 
attention in the past few years. DNA is of particular interest since it may 
be made into complex, highly designed structures.56 The use of DNA–nucleic acid-complementary 
binding, along with enzymes that act specifically on DNA (e.g. 
polymerase, ligase, endonuclease for polymerization, lengthening and 
scission, respectively) make it a useful structural tool. The dimensions 
and properties of DNA are well known and may be exploited, for instance for 
the fabrication of conductive wires.57 In 
solution, interactions between DNA-functionalized-nanoparticles and 
DNA-crosslinked nucleic-acid-functionalized nanoparticles have been used 
for the detection of DNA,58 and more 
recently they have allowed the construction of nanoparticle architectures 
on surfaces.59Scheme 2 shows a general method to fabricate a 
crosslinked multilayer of nanoparticle–DNA composites. First, an 
appropriate surface (gold or functionalized glass) is reacted with a 
thiolated oligonucleotide (13). This immobilized DNA can hybridize 
with part of an analyte nucleic acid (14) that is complementary 
with it. The remaining part of the analyte oligonucleotide can then be used 
to immobilize a nanoparticle that bears an oligonucleotide complementary to 
it (15). The growth may be continued either by reacting with the 
analyte then a nanoparticle functionalized by 13 [Scheme 2(A)], or by reacting with both at the same 
time [Scheme 2(B)]. This second layer 
contains many more nanoparticles since the first immobilized nanoparticles 
constitute ‘branching points’. This ‘amplification’ 
allows the microgravimetric sensing of the analyte–DNA at 
concentrations of 1 × 10−10 M using a 
quartz-crystal-microbalance as transducer.59a If the analyte DNA has a sequence that 
is not properly complementary to both the surface and the nanoparticle, 
then the structure is not built up, and no response is measured. Fig. 8 shows results from a similar experiment, 
where several nanoparticle layers were constructed, and the concentration 
of the nucleic-acid functionalized nanoparticles and analyte DNA are 
sufficiently high to generate saturated Au-nanoparticle layers.59bFig. 
8(A) shows the absorbance spectra recorded for 1–5 
nanoparticle layers. It is seen that non-linear growth only occurs for the 
first two layers, after which the surface is saturated with nanoparticles 
and a full layer is added at each step. It is also noteworthy that no 
additional absorbance above 600 nm appears, which indicates that the 
nanoparticles are not close enough to develop interparticle coupled 
plasmons. Finally, as the film becomes thicker, the melt transition for the 
DNA complex becomes sharper [Fig. 8(B)]. 
This observation is indicative of the cooperative effect of the 
nanoparticle network holding the entire assembly together. Scheme 2  Method for the construction of DNA-crosslinked metal or semiconductor 
nanoparticle arrays for the sensing of a DNA analyte, on gold or glass 
substrates. (A) Continued stepwise growth. (B) Growth with pre-hybridized 
nanoparticles and analyte.  Fig. 8  (A) UV–VIS absorbance spectra of 1–5 Au-nanoparticle layers

nanoparticle linker in architectures of 1, 4 and 10 layers; monitored by 
absorbance at 260 nm (in solution) or at 520 nm (on surfaces). Insets: 
first derivatives of the melt curves. Another way to transduce the build-up of these nanoparticle–DNA 
arrays is to employ functional nanoparticles. The use of cadmium sulfide 
nanoparticles (CdS) (instead of gold) yields a superstructure with novel 
fluorescence and photoelectrochemical properties.60 Absorbance and fluorescence spectra of such a 
system are shown in Fig. 9(A). Irradiation 
of the array in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor results in a 
photocurrent that can also be used as a sensing signal [Fig. 9(B)]. The photocurrent is enhanced as the 
number of aggregated layers increases. It is also clear that the 
photocurrent increases non-linearly since the non-particle architecture 
exhibits a dendritic structure upon aggregation of the layers. Only CdS 
particles that are in intimate contact with the electrode support are 
active in the generation of the photocurrent. This was proved by the 
association of Ru(NH3)63+, acting as an 
electron acceptor, on the DNA strands. The 
Ru(NH3)63+ units trap the conduction-band 
electrons and mediate their transfer to the electrode, thus enhancing the 
generated photocurrent. Fig. 9  (A) Absorbance (—) and fluorescence

Ru(NH3)63+. Hydrogel-entrapped nanoparticle systemsPolymers are extensively used as matrices for processing nanoparticles, 
and the advances in the assembly of polymer–nanoparticle composites 
have recently been reviewed.61 As this 
review emphasizes the properties and functions of organized nanoparticle 
architectures, we will specifically discuss the functional features of 
nanoparticle–hydrogel composites. Hydrogels are highly swollen 
crosslinked polymers that are generally based on poly(acrylamide) and 
poly(acrylic acid). Due to the delicate balance of hydrogen bonds that 
stabilizes the gel′s structure, the degree of swelling is highly 
dependent on factors such as solvent, solutes, pH, temperature and electric 
fields.62‘Ferrogels’ are a class of materials that consist of 
magnetic nanoparticles (or ‘ferrofluids’) immobilized in 
hydrogel matrices. Poly(vinyl alcohol)63 
and poly(acrylamide)64 hydrogels containing 
10–12 nm magnetite (Fe3O4)63 or maghemite 
(γ-Fe2O3)64 
particles have been investigated. These magnetic nanoparticles do not 
aggregate in solution as their mutual attraction is compensated for by 
repulsion due to surface charges and by loss of alignment of magnetic 
moments because of Brownian motion. The ferrogels can thus be prepared by a 
solution-state polymerization in the presence of the particles. Upon 
exposure to non-uniform magnetic fields, ferrogels deform almost 
instantaneously, and they return reversibly to their original state when 
the field is removed. Fig. 10 shows a 
typical experimental setup. The ferrogel is tethered to a stress-sensitive 
device from above, and a solenoid is placed below it. Upon applying a 
current to the solenoid, the downward force and the elongation of the 
material can be measured. Fig. 10(B) shows 
typical curves for the dependence of the elongation of ca. 120 mm 
long gels. Upon applying current to the solenoid, up to a 10% deformation 
can be achieved. Other magnetic field geometries produce different 
deformation effects. Fig. 10  (A) Experimental setup for the measurement of ferrogel elongation in a 
non-uniform magnetic field. (B) Elongation of a 120 mm gel as a function of 
solenoid current for gels containing (a) 2.45 and (b) 4.9 wt% 
magnetite. Since the swelling and shrinking behavior of hydrogels is extremely 
sensitive to many environmental factors, it may conceivably be used as a 
sensing event if a suitable transduction method can be found. Nanoparticles 
have been shown to provide methodologies for transducing these changes. By 
one method, crystalline colloid arrays (CCAs) of polystyrene particles 
(ca. 100 nm diameter) inside hydrogel matrices were 
constructed.65 The assembly acts as a 
diffraction grating with a periodicity dependent on the interparticle 
spacing. It was found that the swelling and shrinking of the gel, brought 
about by exposure to different solutes or temperatures (depending on the 
nature of the gel used), causes the entire assembly to deform, thus 
increasing or decreasing the unit cell size of the crystallized colloid 
array. This change is easily detected and quantified by examination of the 
diffraction properties of the assembly. Fig. 
11 shows absorbance spectra of a CCA immobilized in a crown 
ether-containing hydrogel, (16). Exposure of the system to 
Pb2+ causes the swelling of the gel as the metal ions are bound 
to the crown ether. The diffraction properties of the structure follow 
Bragg’s law, and a 0.5% volume change causes a ca. 1 nm 
movement of the diffraction wavelength. Fig. 11  Absorbance spectra of a polystyrene CCA embedded (7 wt%) in the polymer 
16 (ca. 1 crown ether unit per 20 monomer units) in the 
presence of Pb2+ at concentrations of (a) 0, (b) 0.4 and (c) 4 
ppm. Pb2+ can be sensed with a sensitivity limit of ca. 
20 ppb. Poly(acrylamide) hydrogels adopt swollen structures in water, but 
undergo phase transitions to collapsed states upon exposure to less polar 
solvents such as acetone. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, hydrogels 
containing a controllable concentration of gold nanoparticles have been 
synthesized by the route described in Scheme 
3.66 In this procedure, the 
nanoparticle-free gel is first synthesized on a conductive support by 
electropolymerization. The nanoparticles are then introduced into the 
structure by a ‘breathing’ method. First, the gel is shrunken 
by immersing it in acetone. This step removes most of the solvent from the 
gel. The shrunken gel is then immersed in an aqueous nanoparticle solution. 
The water causes the gel to swell and take the solution into its structure. 
As it does so, nanoparticles are introduced, where they become stuck by 
entanglement and the hydrogen bonding network (the gold nanoparticles bear 
a citrate surface, so have a high hydrogen bonding potential). This 
‘breathing’ mechanism may be repeated several times to 
gradually increase the nanoparticle content of the gel, and as more 
nanoparticles are included, the properties of the gel are modified. The 
electronic properties of the hydrogel are altered upon the incorporation of 
the Au-nanoparticles. Fig. 12(A) shows 
Faradaic impedance spectra (in the form of Nyquist plots) of the hydrogel 
after three ‘breathing’ cycles. The diameters of the 
semicircular regions in the plots are indicative of the interfacial 
electron transfer resistances between the electrode and a 
solution-solubilized redox probe.67 As the 
amount of Au-nanoparticles increases in the hydrogel, the interfacial 
electron transfer resistance decreases, implying enhanced conductivity of 
the hydrogel matrix. The electronic properties of the 
Au-nanoparticle–hydrogel composite are strongly affected upon 
phase-transition of the polymer matrix. Fig. 
12(B) shows chronopotentiometric transients of the polymer matrix 
in the swollen [curve (a)] and shrunken [curve (b)] states. For comparison, 
the chronopotentiometric transients of the Au–polymer composite in 
the swollen [curve (c)] and shrunken [curve (d)] configurations are given. 
These chronopotentiometric transients indicate the overpotentials required 
to retain a constant current in the cell in the presence of a redox label 
[Fe(CN)63−/4−], and thus allows the 
extraction of the values of electrode resistance in the different 
configurations. The shrunken nanoparticle-free electrode reveals a 
substantially higher resistance than the swollen configuration (>300 
vs. 70 kΩ). On the other hand the shrunken 
nanoparticle-containing electrode reveals a substantially lower resistance 
than its swollen state (0.4 vs. 20 kΩ, respectively). The 
low resistance of the shrunken Au-nanoparticle polymer composite is 
attributed to electrical contact in the nanoparticle network which offers a 
route for electronic communication between the electrode and the 
electrolyte solution. Scheme 3  Method for the assembly of Au-nanoparticle-containing electropolymerized 
hydrogels by the ‘breathing’ technique. First the hydrogel is 
electropolymerized, then the nanoparticles are introduced by (i) shrinking 
the gel in acetone and (ii) re-swelling the gel in a 
nanoparticle-containing solution. Steps (i) and (ii) may be repeated to 
increase the nanoparticle concentration in the gel.  Fig. 12  (A) Faradaic impedance spectra showing the build-up of Au nanoparticles 
inside a polyacrylamide electrode and the decrease of the interfacial 
electron transfer resistance: (a) The swollen polyacrylamide gel prior to 
the introduction of Au-nanoparticles. (b)–(d) The swollen 
polyacrylamide gel after one, two and three ‘breathing’ cycles 
that introduce Au-nanoparticles into the polymer. (B) Chronopotentiometry 
transients of: (a) the swollen polyacrylamide electrode; (b) the shrunken 
polyacrylamide gel-electrode; (c) the swollen Au-nanoparticle-containing 
polyacrylamide electrode; (d) the shrunken Au-nanoparticle-containing 
polyacrylamide electrode. Inset: reversible switching of the 
nanoparticle-containing polyacrylamide electrode between swollen (□) 
and shrunken (●) states. Conclusions and perspectivesThe article has addressed means to tailor functional metal and 
semiconductor nanoparticle arrays for sensoric and electronic uses. The 
unique conductivity, catalytic, photonic, optical, electronic and 
photoelectronic properties of metallic and semiconductor nanoparticle 
systems, originating from the collective interactions in the crosslinked 
architectures, introduce new perspectives in nanotechnology. The 
nano-structuring of the assemblies provide high surface-area systems of 
controllable electronic and optical properties. Crosslinking of 
nanoparticles with molecular receptors yields conductive arrays with 
specific recognition features and controllable porosity, and the 
integration of nanoparticles with polymeric hydrogels paves the way to 
design signal-triggered materials with novel electronic properties. The 
conjugation of nanoparticles with nucleic acids establishes a fascinating 
research area that enables the amplified optical electronic and 
photoelectrochemical detection of DNA as well as the nanoengineering of 
predesigned and programmed DNA/nanoparticle circuitry. The application of 
these methodologies for gene analyses on DNA arrays, and the organization 
of wired nanoparticle assemblies that include resistance, capacitance and 
conductivity elements seem to be reachable goals.We have already discussed some basic nanoparticle-based devices that 
have found commercial interest such as gas sensors, electrochemical 
sensors, photovoltaic cells, and luminescence collectors. More advanced 
applications that use layered nanoparticle composites may need more time to 
develop, yet they are certainly emerging. For example, nanoparticles may 
have a large impact in the area of reflective, bistable electronic 
displays.68 These displays, known as 
‘electronic paper’, promise to resemble paper in their ease of 
viewing and portability, without requiring a continuous input of energy to 
maintain a picture. These technologies are based on variously colored 
nanoparticles that are aligned inside microcapsules by external electrical 
fields. Other promising applications of nanoparticles may include displays 
and memory devices based on electroluminescence matrices69 or integrated molecule/nanoparticle systems as 
computing devices.One important future challenge will involve the organization of 
addressable nanoparticle architectures of variable composition and 
functions. Primary efforts in patterning of nanoparticle structures on 
surfaces have been reported.70 The rapid 
advances in developing scanning microscopy ‘writing’ 
techniques71 suggest that the use of 
‘nanoparticle inks’ for nanometer-sized writing is a feasible 
goal. The progress in the photonic activation of nanometer-sized domains 
using near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM), indicates that the 
photonic addressability and imaging of nanostructures are viable 
concepts. AcknowledgementsPart of the studies are supported by the German–Israel Research
