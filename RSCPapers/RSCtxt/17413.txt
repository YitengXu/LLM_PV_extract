1. Introduction
The environmental and global warming problem caused by the continuous burning of fossil fuels calls for green and sustainable energy.1–3 Effectively developing clean energy, such as wind power and solar power, is the most efficient method for alleviating the energy crisis, but this strategy is hindered by weather and the uneven distribution of the resources.4 Therefore, energy storage and conversion technologies have been paid considerable attention by many researchers not only to meet the demand for the pursuit of the widespread utilization of intermittent energies, but also to attain flexible mutual transformation between chemical energy and electrical energy.5–9 To achieve the above targets, various metal-ion batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged and each plays a crucial role.10–12 Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been commercialized, their performance cannot fulfill the increasing demand for energy storage with higher power density and energy density. This demand has accelerated research on various battery technologies beyond LIBs, including sodium-ion batteries (SIBs),12 potassium-ion batteries (PIBs),13 aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs),14 magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs)15 and zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs).16 In contrast, water splitting, which involves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), has attracted intense research interest and can offer a promising means of supplying energy in the future.17–19 However, this strategy is impeded by the expensive noble metal catalysts used in the photochemical and electrochemical processes.20,21 Therefore, researchers are dedicated to developing low-cost catalysts to replace the traditional noble metal-based catalysts.
Over the past few years, many nanomaterials with unique crystal structures, morphologies and chemical compositions have been applied as electrode materials in extensive energy storage and conversion devices.22–24 In particular, vanadium-based nanomaterials have drawn ample attention because of their excellent performance in electrochemistry.25,26 Vanadium is abundant on earth and has rich valence states varying from +2 to +5 when it is used as an electrode material, meaning that multiple electron transfer can be realized in the electrochemical process.25,26 In addition, vanadium-based nanomaterials encompass many members with different compositions, structures and electrochemical activities, including vanadium oxides,27–29 vanadates,30–32 vanadium phosphates33–35 and oxygen-free vanadium-based materials.36–38 Based on this, various structures, such as one-dimensional (1D) chain-like structures, two-dimensional (2D) structure, quasi-2D structures and three-dimensional (3D) tunnel structures, were prepared and brought about versatile properties in vanadium-based materials in diverse electrochemical energy devices.
Since the first exfoliation of graphene from graphite in 2004, 2D nanomaterials have attracted dramatically increasing interest.39–42 Their distinguished physical, optical and electronic properties have inspired the development of other 2D materials.41 Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have a layered structure similar to graphene and are often employed as energy materials.5,43–45 To enhance performance, ultrathin TMD nanomaterials have been fabricated by exfoliation or bottom-up methods.46–48 Vanadium disulfide (VS2) is a typical member in the family of TMDs. The VS2 crystal is composed of a V layer sandwiched between two S layers, which are stacked together through van der Waals interaction.49 Patronite (VS4) is another kind of vanadium sulfide and has a linear-chain structure.50 Currently, various synthetic methods, such as hydrothermal methods and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods, have been carried out to prepare vanadium sulfide based materials that can be applied as electrode materials in the energy field.51–55 The unique structural and electrical characteristics of the VS2 crystal and VS4 crystal make them promising candidates as electrode materials in the energy field. For example, ultrathin VS2 nanosheets (NSs) can be assembled when constructing in-plane SCs and branched VS4 nanodendrites can be used as cathode materials in MIBs.49,56 However, there is no comprehensive review that fully concentrates on the applications of vanadium sulfide based materials in energy storage and conversion.
In this review, the recent advances in the synthetic strategies of various vanadium sulfide based materials and their applications in the field of energy are summarized and discussed (Fig. 1). First, we introduce the structural characteristics and electrochemical basis of vanadium sulfides. Next, the synthetic strategies for vanadium sulfide based materials are classified. Then, the electrochemical application for energy storage in the fields of SCs, LIBs, SIBs, PIBs and multivalent-ion batteries and for energy conversion in the fields of the HER and OER are highlighted. Special emphasis is placed on the relationship between the structure of vanadium sulfide based materials and their performance. Finally, we make conclusions based on the opportunities and challenges of vanadium sulfide based materials in the field of energy research.

2. Crystal structures and fundamental electrochemical properties
Vanadium sulfides primarily include VS2 and VS4, as well as many phases such as V2S5, V2S3, VS, V3S and VS6. Of those sulfides, VS2 and VS4 are two typical ones that have drawn intense attention in the past few years. The VS2 crystal exhibits a layered structure with an interlayer spacing of 5.76 Å and consists of a hexagonally packed metal V layer sandwiched between two layers of S atoms (Fig. 2a).57 The VS4 crystal is a quasi-one-dimensional chain-like compound that is composed of V(IV) ions coordinated with S22− dimers, as shown in Fig. 2b. These linear structural units are stacked together by weak van der Waals interactions with an interchain distance of 5.83 Å.58 The oxidation states of the vanadium in VS2 and VS4 are the same, but the oxidation states of the sulfides are different. An S2− monomer exists in VS2, while an S22− dimer exists in VS4.

Electrical conductivity is a significant parameter for determining electrochemical activity. In the past few years, the density of states (DOS) for VS2 and VS4 has been computed by researchers (Fig. 2c and d).57,59 The VS2 layer exhibits metallicity with considerable electronic states at the Fermi level, which is beneficial for promoting electronic and electrochemical activities (Fig. 2c).57 Grey et al. found that potential dimerization through metal–metal bonding existed in VS4.59 This was associated with a Peierls distortion. They also observed alternation in the V–V distances of 2.8 and 3.2 Å. Through density functional theory (DFT) computations, the band gap of diamagnetic VS4 was found to be close to 1 eV (Fig. 2d).
Owing to the promising electrochemical performance of VS2, great attention has been paid to the theoretical research of VS2 based rechargeable batteries. In 2013, Jing et al. investigated the adsorption and diffusion of lithium on the VS2 monolayer using DFT computations.57 When compared with MoS2 and graphite, the VS2 monolayer exhibits a higher theoretical capacity (466 mA h g−1), a lower or similar Li diffusion barrier and a low average open-circuit voltage of 0.93 V (vs. Li/Li+). In addition, the 1T VS2 monolayer (V in octahedral coordination) was also studied as an anode material for Li-, Na-, Mg-, Ca- and Al-ion storage by first principles simulation.60 The 1T VS2 monolayer was found to be unsuitable for Mg or Al ion storage because of ultralow or positive absorption. In contrast, the surface of the 1T VS2 monolayer can strongly interact with single Li, Na or Ca adatoms and accept electron charge density with high efficiency. The open circuit voltage profiles were predicted to be in the ranges of ∼1.56 V to ∼0.46 V and ∼1.5 V to ∼0.37 V for Li- and Na-ion storage, respectively. Similarly, through first-principles calculations, Chen et al. investigated VS2 monolayers as electrode materials for Li-, K-, Mg- and Al-ion batteries.61 Three layers of Li, two layers of Mg and one layer of K can anchor on the surface of the VS2 monolayer, which can bring about high theoretical capacities of 1397, 7863, and 466 mA h g−1, respectively. Li, K and Mg cations form a honeycomb-stacking lattice on the surface of VS2 monolayers. This can result in small diffusion barriers. However, only one-ninth of the surface of the VS2 monolayer can be anchored by Al, showing a much lower capacity of 78 mA h g−1.
Thus, the 2D electron–electron correlation among V atoms in the VS2 monolayer results in more complex planar electron transportation. The metallicity of VS2 can facilitate its performance as an electrode material in supercapacitors and various batteries, and activities as an electrocatalyst toward the HER and OER.
Notably, VS4 with a special atomic-chain structure with a high interchain distance can also serve as a promising electrode material. The high S content in VS4 can enhance its high capacity and long cycling performance.126 However, so far, simulations based on the VS4 monochain have rarely been reported and these should be given ample attention in the future.
3. Fabrication methods
3.1 Design principles
To obtain high purity vanadium sulfide based materials with high activity in various applications, their synthesis is the initial and most important process. Strategies for their fabrication can be divided into two modes: “top-down”, such as exfoliation, and “bottom-up”, such as hydrothermal and solvothermal synthesis. Table 1 gives a comprehensive summary of the fabrication methods, precursors, synthesis conditions (temperature and time) and morphology of vanadium sulfides and their composites.

While exhibiting considerable theoretical capacity, pure phase vanadium sulfides may not provide desirable performance in energy storage because of volume expansion during the ion intercalation process, resulting in low capacity and poor rate performance. In addition, when they are applied as catalysts in energy conversion, more active sites exist on the nanoscale vanadium sulfides than on their bulk counterparts. Even so, the activity of pure nanoscale vanadium sulfides for catalyzing energy conversion cannot meet the requirements of practical usage. To solve the above problems, several synthetic strategies have been developed: (1) constructing heterogeneous structures with other oxides or sulfides to adjust the electronic properties of vanadium sulfides and promote their activity; (2) hybridizing with carbon materials to promote conductivity and retard volume expansion during the ion intercalation process. Graphene or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are often used as substrates for vanadium sulfides. For example, VS4/rGO hybrids were synthesized through introducing graphene oxide (GO) into the reaction system.50 The activity of the obtained materials can be promoted effectively.
The processes for preparing heterogeneous structures or hybrid structures of vanadium sulfides can be identified as a one-step process and a multi-step process. For the one-step process, all the components in the hybrids can be obtained through a single in situ growth process. For example, VOOH-coated VS2 microflowers could be obtained through a one-step hydrothermal process.55 For the multi-step process, the pure vanadium sulfide phase is obtained in the first step, and in the subsequent steps other components are formed on the surface of the pure vanadium sulfide phase. The schematic illustration of synthetic methods for fabricating vanadium sulfides is shown in Fig. 3. The best synthetic strategy depends on the intrinsic characteristics of the target products. In the following sections, several strategies and examples will be reviewed in detail.

3.2 Hydrothermal/solvothermal methods
Hydrothermal/solvothermal methods based on liquid-phase reactions are powerful tools for preparing materials with a uniform size and morphology.132 Generally, an organic liquid is used as the solvent in solvothermal reactions while water is used as the solvent in hydrothermal reactions. Several factors, such as the solvent, reaction temperature, reaction time, and pH value, can affect the phases and morphologies of the products. Unlike other synthetic methods, some rather unexpected conditions can be attained during the hydrothermal/solvothermal process.132,133 In addition, this process has strong operability, low cost and low power consumption.
In 2001, Xie et al. prepared VS2·3NH3 materials through a hydrothermal process. Subsequently, VS2·3NH3 was exfoliated to obtain ultrathin VS2 NSs (Fig. 4a).49 In this process, ammonia molecules with positive physical activity and chemical reactivity can be intercalated into layered VS2, resulting in obtaining VS2·3NH3 flakes with a thickness of ∼110 nm (Fig. 4b). The thickness of the VS2 NSs that were further exfoliated from VS2·3NH3 through sonication was measured to be approximately 2.5 nm, as shown in Fig. 4c. Moreover, by controlling the experimental parameters in the hydrothermal process, various VS2 nanostructures have been successfully prepared.53,65–73 By adding ethylene glycol (EG) into the solvent, highly crystalline VS2 NSs could be obtained. By adding cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a growth modifier, the crystallinity of VS2 NSs was decreased.68 Layer-by-layer stacked VS2 NSs were prepared through a poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) assisted hydrothermal method.53 VS2 nanostructures could also be formed on the substrates when adding substrates before the hydrothermal reaction.

The hydrothermal method is also widely used in the synthesis of VS2 based hybrids.55,91–94 Huang et al. prepared VOOH-coated VS2 microflowers by a one-step hydrothermal treatment.55 By controlling the reaction temperature, the crystallinity of VOOH can be tuned. When the reaction temperature is increased to 180 °C, the diffraction peaks of VOOH cannot be observed in the XRD pattern. The MoS2 NSs were hybridized with 1T-VS2 nanoflowers through a two-step hydrothermal method that was developed by Yu et al.93
The hydrothermal method has also been widely used to obtain VS4 based materials.56,98–103 Shin et al. grew VS4 materials through a simple hydrothermal method by using GO as a growth modifier (Fig. 4d).50 In that study, they demonstrated that the graphitic domain can act as a template or a substrate for the nucleation and growth of VS4 crystals. Since that study, numerous VS4 nanostructures hybridized with carbon materials have been prepared which exhibit high activity in various applications in the field of energy.106–122,126,127
Obtaining vanadium sulfides with a novel morphology and performance through solvothermal methods has received considerable attention in the past few years because the utilization of an organic solvent can increase the solubility of the precursors that have poor solubility in water.51,74–76,104,105,121,125,131 In 2017, Li et al. prepared hierarchical VS2 nanosheet assemblies through a solvothermal reaction by using cysteine and vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) as precursors and using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent (Fig. 4e).76 They also found that NMP has a suitable surface energy and can facilitate the formation and stabilization of the special morphology of VS2 nanosheet assemblies. As shown in Fig. 4f and g, the products consisted of assemblies with a flower-like morphology, and the assemblies contained curved VS2 NSs. From the cross profile of a VS2 nanosheet, the thickness of the nanosheet was approximately 10 atomic layers (Fig. 4h).
Moreover, VS4 based structures were also fabricated through solvothermal methods. For example, VS4 nanoparticles (NPs) were grown on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) through a solvothermal reaction between Na3VO4 and thioacetamide (C2H5NS, TAA) in the presence of CNFs with rich defects in the EG solution.105 In addition, VS4 nanospheres were first prepared in EG through a solvothermal method and used as precursors for other vanadium sulfide based materials by Ma et al. The obtained VS4 nanospheres were then encapsulated in polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers, which was followed by annealing under an Ar/H2 atmosphere at 600 °C to obtain V3S4 microspheres encapsulated in N-doped CNFs.131
3.3 Exfoliation method
The exfoliation method is one of the top-down methods and relies on the exfoliation of layered bulk crystals into single-layer or few-layer NSs. In this method, various strategies are applied to break the van der Waals interaction between stacked layers.41,134 The exfoliation can be divided into mechanical exfoliation, mechanical force-assisted liquid exfoliation, ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation, ion exchange-assisted liquid exfoliation and oxidation-assisted liquid exfoliation.42,135 Mechanical exfoliation uses the Scotch-tape method and yields optimum quality single-layered samples.135 Inspired by this method, bulk materials with layered structures can also be exfoliated in solvent if appropriate mechanical forces are chosen, such as ion intercalation-assisted liquid exfoliation, another exfoliation process. In this process, cations with smaller ionic radii are intercalated into the interspace of bulk materials with layered structures, which can enlarge the interval and weaken the van der Waals interaction between layers. Ion exchange-assisted liquid exfoliation was designed for exfoliating 2D metal oxides, layered double hydroxides, and metal phosphorus trichalcogenides. In this method, ions with larger radii are replaced by ions with smaller radii in the presence of their bulk counterparts through an ion exchange process.136,137 Oxidation-assisted liquid exfoliation is used for the exfoliation of graphite.138,139 By using a strong oxidizing agent, some oxygen-containing functional groups are generated on the surface of the graphene layers, which is helpful for weakening the van der Waals interaction.
Over the past few years, many efforts have been made towards the exfoliation synthesis of vanadium sulfide nanomaterials.49,52,80,81,95,128 Xie et al. adopted solvent-assisted liquid exfoliation for preparing VS2 NSs (Fig. 5a).52,80 As the exfoliation continued, the van der Waals interactions of VS2 were engineered, and the spin properties and bandgap were tuned. The thickness of the obtained VS2 NSs was less than 2 nm (Fig. 5b). Their high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image demonstrated that the obtained VS2 NSs were the 1T crystal phase of VS2 (Fig. 5c).49 Moreover, the VS4 nanorods were obtained from bulk VS4 through mechanical force-assisted liquid exfoliation in isopropanol.95

3.4 CVD method
The CVD method has been widely used for synthesizing 2D materials over the past few years.140,141 Using the CVD method, impurity free and high crystalline quality products with potential for scale-up could be obtained. In 2005, Lou et al. synthesized VS2 single crystal NSs using the CVD method.79 Since then, various VS2 based materials have been prepared through this method.54,77,78,90 VS2 NSs with sub-10 nm thicknesses were grown on the substrates through a CVD method under a mixed Ar/H2 atmosphere by using VCl3 and sulfur as precursors (Fig. 5d).78 The evaporation temperature of VCl3 and the location optimization of SiO2/Si substrates relative to the VCl3 precursor are key factors for growing ultrathin VS2. Moreover, CVD also can be used for preparing vanadium sulfide based hybrids. Koratkar et al. deposited densely packed VS2 flakes with high crystallinity on the surface of CNT substrates through a CVD method (Fig. 5e).54 A TiS2 layer with a thickness of ∼2.5 nm was coated on the VS2 flakes through an atomic layer deposition process that obtained VS2–TiS2 hybrid structures that can be used as cathode materials in LIBs.
3.5 Other methods
While various vanadium sulfide based structures can be obtained via the hydrothermal/solvothermal, exfoliation and CVD methods, it is still challenging to prepare pure samples in a complex chemical environment. Many other methods have been developed for obtaining various vanadium sulfide based structures, such as atomic layer deposition, annealing, oil-phase synthesis, and solid–gas reactions.58,62–64,82,89,95–97,130 Tremel et al. synthesized VS2 nanotubes through a heat treatment at 225 °C for 22 h in a H2S atmosphere.62 Dong and co-workers reported ultrathin VS2 nanoplates with in-plane and out-of-plane structures were synthesized through an oil-phase method.82 Ma and co-workers reported that V3S4 microspheres could be encapsulated in N-doped CNFs through calcination at 600 °C for 2 h in an Ar/H2 (10% H2) atmosphere.131 C/V1.11S2 NSs were obtained by heating PVP/VS2·NH3 precursors at 350 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere.130 Although these kinds of methods are used for obtaining vanadium sulfide based structures with novel morphologies, more attention needs to be paid to improving existing strategies and developing new strategies.
4. Application of vanadium sulfide based materials in energy storage
4.1 SCs
With an ever-increasing demand for environmentally friendly energy storage resources, SCs with outstanding operating lifetimes, high power densities and ultrafast charging–discharging rates have attracted substantial attention.142,143 Generally, SCs can be classified into two categories on the basis of the energy storage mechanism: faradaic SCs (also called pseudo-capacitors) and electrical double layer capacitors.6,8–10 The energy density of SCs (∼5 W h kg−1) is lower than that of batteries, but a much higher power delivery or uptake (10 kW kg−1) can be reached by SCs than batteries. As a result, SCs are widely used in uninterruptible power supply systems.9 To date, various materials, such as carbon materials,144,145 transition metal oxides,146,147 hydroxides,148 transition metal chalcogenides,149 conductive polymer materials150 and metal organic frameworks,151 have been used as active materials for SCs.
2D VS2 nanomaterials with excellent electrical conductivity are important for constructing SCs, which could enhance the activity of other active materials in VS2 based SCs.49,65,67,82 Xie et al. assembled as-exfoliated VS2 NSs into a highly c-oriented VS2 thin film for an in-plane supercapacitor through a vacuum filtration method (Fig. 6a and b).49 The as-fabricated supercapacitor exhibited a considerable specific capacitance of 4760 μF cm−2 and excellent stability after 1000 cycles (Fig. 6c and d). VS2 nanoplates with rich in-plane and out-plane defects synthesized by Dong et al. were applied as SCs.82 Compared to free-defect VS2 nanoplates, the rich-defect VS2 nanoplates show better energy storage capacity. At 1 A g−1, the capacitance of the rich-defect VS2 nanoplates is 2200 F g−1 (Fig. 6e). Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated by using such nanoplates as the anode and commercial activated carbon as the cathode. At 0.5 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the as-fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor could reach 225 F g−1 (Fig. 6f). The as-fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor attained a power density of 6.62 kW kg−1 (at an energy density of 31.25 W h kg−1), an energy density of 66.54 W h kg−1 (at a power density of 0.75 kW kg−1) and good stability (5000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1).

Another vanadium sulfide compound for SCs is VS4. Compared with VS2, VS4 has a higher sulfur content and performs at a higher theoretical capacity.126 Rout et al. investigated the application of a VS4/single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)/rGO hybrid in supercapacitors.122 The VS4/SWCNT/rGO hybrid exhibited a specific capacitance of 558.7 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, an impressive energy density of 174 W h kg−1, and a power density of 13.8 kW kg−1 (Fig. 7a). Moreover, a VS4/CNT composite with a petal-shape structure was obtained as an electrode material for SCs.126 In the voltage range between −1.4 V and 1.4 V, the VS4/CNT composite delivers a capacity of 330 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 7b). A symmetrical supercapacitor device was also fabricated using the VS4/CNT composite and exhibited a capacitance of 676 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2 with a potential window of up to 2.2 V (Fig. 7c). When the power density is 2.75 W cm−2, the area energy density of the device can be 4.55 W h m−2. In particular, by introducing VS4 NSs, a VS4/rGO/CoS2@Co nanocomposite was synthesized as a cathode for supercapacitors. The VS4 NSs in such a composite can broaden the voltage window and enhance the conductivity and stability. This cathode delivers a specific capacitance of 1353 F g−1 at a current density of 0.625 A g−1 and can show 89.6% retention after 20000 cycles (Fig. 7d and e). When the power density is 2.67 kW kg−1, the asymmetric supercapacitor device that was fabricated by using rGO/Co9S8@GO as the anode delivers an energy density of 106 W h kg−1, accompanied by a cyclability of 96.2% retention after 3000 cycles.

4.2 LIBs
As widely used energy storage devices, LIBs play a significant role in modern society. LIBs exhibit superb performance in terms of energy density, a wide operation temperature window and a long operational duration.152–159 Recently, the application of LIBs has expanded from portable electric devices to electric vehicles.1,156 To develop LIBs with a large specific capacity, high efficiency, long lifetime and operational safety, various anode materials with higher Li diffusion rates and larger capacities are required. However, further advances in LIBs are hindered by microscale materials with slow Li diffusion rates, small surface areas, high resistance and poor sharp flexibilities during the charge–discharge process. Recent advances in nanotechnology and electrochemistry have promoted the utilization of nanomaterials as electrodes in LIBs because of their distinguished structures.160–163 Among those materials, 2D TMDs are versatile intercalation hosts, which can accommodate the demands of various guest species.164 Especially, the metallicity of VS2 can enhance the electrochemical kinetics and the high S content in VS4 can increase the capacity, which is significant for the development of various batteries, including LIBs discussed in this section, and SIBs, PIBs and multivalent-ion batteries discussed in the following sections. In this section, we will summarize the theoretical basis for the application of vanadium sulfides in LIBs, and then some recently developed vanadium sulfide based materials will be reviewed.

4.2.1 Theoretical basis for the application of vanadium sulfides in LIBs. 
The intercalation of Li+ in VS2 was first realized in 1977 by Murphy et al.,165 and later, VS2 was proposed as a cathode material for LIBs.164,166 Li0.8VS2 was then used as an anode material in LIBs; its specific capacity was lower than 200 mA h g−1.167,168 Later, Chen et al. proposed VS2 monolayers as anode materials for LIBs.57 They found that the Li mobility on a VS2 monolayer can be more than threefold faster than that on a MoS2 monolayer and that it can be as fast as that in graphite due to its metallic nature. Various configurations for the stoichiometry of LixVS2 were also constructed (Fig. 8a). With increasing x, the Li binding energy for LixVS2 declined steadily. At x = 2, a Li binding energy of −0.93 eV can be achieved (Fig. 8b). Based on the above principles, a theoretical capacity of 466 mA h g−1 can be deduced for the VS2 monolayer. Moreover, first-principles calculations were also conducted to study the activity of monolayer VS2 for LIBs.61 Researchers found low diffusion barriers for VS2 monolayers and their high electrical conductivity promoted kinetic properties for cation diffusion and electron transportation. Three Li layers can be stably absorbed on the VS2 monolayer, which leads to a theoretical capacity of 1397 mA h g−1 (Fig. 8c). Notably, a honeycomb-stacking lattice was able to be formed by Li+ cations on the VS2 monolayer, which brought about small diffusion barriers (Fig. 8d). Through density functional theory calculations, Jiang et al. found that the vanadium atoms in the monolayer could accumulate electrons and that the electron storage capability of vanadium in VS2 could facilitate redox pseudocapacitor characteristics.169

In addition, VS2 based nanocomposites were also investigated as promising anodes for LIBs using DFT computations. The sorption and diffusion of Li atoms in the surface and in the interface layer of the VS2/graphene nanocomposite were researched.170 The theoretical capacity of VS2/graphene heterostructures was predicted to be 569 mA h g−1, and the diffusion barriers for the heterostructures were lower than that for bulk VS2, indicating that this type of nanocomposite can be used as an anode material in LIBs with high power density and fast charge/discharge rates. By using the MoS2 monolayer as a substrate, the chemically active VS2 monolayer can be stabilized in energy and phonon vibrations.171 Through DFT calculation, the maximum capacity of such a nanocomposite can be raised to 584 mA h g−1 for Li storage.

Conclusively, through theoretical calculation, the theoretical capacities of various vanadium sulfide based materials have been obtained, which would promote the development of synthetic technology of vanadium sulfide based electrodes in LIBs. Detailed synthetic methods and electrochemical activity of vanadium sulfide based electrode materials for LIBs are summarized in Table 2.

4.2.2 VS2 based materials for LIBs. 
Continuous concerns about energy have prompted research into VS2 based materials with high capacity and low cost for use in LIBs. In 2005, Chen et al. developed a facile hydrothermal process for preparing hierarchical VS2/graphene NS (VSs/GNS) hybrids in the presence of CTAB as a cathode material for LIBs (Fig. 9a).87Fig. 9b exhibits the cycling behavior of the VSs/GNS electrode and the VS2 electrode at 36 mA g−1. The remarkable cycling performance of the VSs/GNS electrode was due to the 2D hybrid structures between the 2D VS2 NSs and graphene. The layered structures could promote lithium ion extraction and insertion. Rate performance is a significant factor for evaluating the dynamic performance of electrodes. As shown in Fig. 9c, the VSs/GNS electrode can still deliver a discharge capacity of 114.2 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 20C (1C = 180 mA g−1) without degeneration while pristine VS2 can only keep 90 mA h g−1 at such a high current density, indicating a superior rate performance for the VSs/GNS electrode. Highly crystalline VS2 (hc-VS2) NSs and low crystalline VS2 (lc-VS2) NSs as cathode materials for all-solid-state LIBs were synthesized by a solvothermal process (Fig. 9d and e).68 In such a process, adding CTAB can reduce the crystallinity of VS2 NSs. Fig. 9f exhibits the cycling properties of the hc-VS2 electrode and the lc-VS2 electrode at 50 mA g−1 and at room temperature. The hc-VS2 NS electrode delivered initial discharge and charge capacities of 728.5 and 472.2 mA h g−1, respectively, with a coulombic efficiency of ∼65.1%, while the lc-VS2 NSs exhibited a discharge capacity of 648.7 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of ∼60.0%, which may be due to insufficient contact and poor crystallinity. Moreover, at 50 mA g−1 the hc-VS2 NSs deliver a reversible capacity of 532.2 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles, which is higher than that of lc-VS2 NSs. At 100 mA g−1, the hc-VS2 electrode could maintain a reversible capacity of 436.8 mA h g−1 with a retention of 71% after 100 cycles (Fig. 9g). Moreover, Shan et al. coated a carbon nanotube (CNT) thin film with VS2 NSs to obtain a VS2 NS@CNT sample that could be used as an electrode material for LIBs (Fig. 9h).90Fig. 9i demonstrates the cycling behavior of VS2 NS@CNTs at a current density of 200 mA g−1. After 100 cycles, VS2 NS@CNTs can maintain a capacity of ∼900 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of ∼98%. Also, VS2 NS@CNTs exhibited good rate performance, as shown in Fig. 9j, and can maintain capacities of 870 and 830 mA h g−1 at current densities of 500 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively, after 70 cycles. In addition, VS2 NSs were coated with poly(styrenesulfonate)-doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT-PSS) as an anode material for LIBs, which can enhance electrical conductivity and phase transfer and improve structural stability.69 As a result of that, VS2@PEDOT-PSS NSs exhibited good rate capacity and cycling stability. At 100 mA g−1, the VS2@PEDOT-PSS NSs could keep a reversible capacity of 569.0 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. At 2 A g−1, the VS2@PEDOT-PSS NSs could keep a specific capacity of 186.8 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles.

VS2 was also hybridized with other oxide or sulfide nanomaterials for electrode materials in LIBs.54,94 Shen et al. coated bronze phase TiO2 (TiO2-B) nanowire arrays with VS2 NPs to form TiO2-B@VS2 heterogeneous nanowire arrays (TVNAs) on Ti foil that can be applied as additive-free anodes for LIBs.94 At 335 mA g−1, after 500 cycles the TVNA electrode exhibits a capacity of 365.4 mA h g−1. Moreover, TiS2 layers with a thickness of ∼2.5 nm were coated on the VS2 flakes that were attached to the CNT film to obtain VS2–TiS2 flakes as a cathode material for LIBs (Fig. 10a and b).54 After 100 cycles at a current density of ∼200 mA g−1, the VS2–TiS2 flakes could maintain a capacity of above 180 mA h g−1, while the VS2 flakes exhibited rapid capacity loss under the same conditions (Fig. 10c). At ∼1000 mA g−1, the capacity retention of the VS2–TiS2 flake electrode is close to 100% after 400 cycles while the value is only ∼40% for the VS2 flake electrode (Fig. 10d). To monitor structural changes during the charge–discharge process, an optical microscope was used to characterize individual VS2 and VS2–TiS2 flakes (Fig. 10e–j). In the charge process, partial transparency appeared on the original VS2 flakes, and this change was not reversible, indicating that irreversible changes occurred (Fig. 10e–g). In contrast to the VS2 flake, no pronounced color or structural change was observed for the VS2–TiS2 flake (Fig. 10h–j), indicating the excellent structural stability of the VS2–TiS2 flake during the lithiation and delithiation processes.

Li–S batteries, as promising energy storage devices, have drawn considerable attention because of their high theoretical capacity (1672 mA h g−1) compared to conventional LIBs.172–174 Owing to its metallic features, VS2 has shown significant promise as a sulfur host candidate.71,83,84,175 Alternating sulfur layers and VS2 attached reduced graphene oxide (rGO) NSs that exhibited significant improved electrochemical performance were prepared by Wang et al.84 When the sulfur loading is 89%, the volumetric specific capacity of the cell is 1182.1 mA h cm−3. When cycling at 0.1C, the volumetric specific capacity decreases to 1050 mA h cm−3 after 100 cycles. VS2/rGO NSs were fabricated as a sulfur host through an in situ assembly route (Fig. 10k and l).83 When cycling at 0.5C, the obtained sulfur electrode could deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1504 mA h g−1 and retain a reversible capacity of 1010 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. 10m). When the rate was 5C, the capacity of the hybrid electrode decreased from 850 mA h g−1 to 532 mA h g−1 with a capacity decay rate of 0.12% per cycle after 300 cycles (Fig. 10n).


4.2.3 VS4 based materials for LIBs. 
VS4 has drawn ample attention due to its high sulfur content, unique one-dimensional crystal structure, and high theoretical behavior, which is different from its analogue, VS2.103,104 The high capacity can be ascribed to the high content of sulfur because sulfur is involved in the electrochemical process. To investigate the underlying Li-ion storage mechanism in VS4, many advanced tools have been employed. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to characterize the structural changes of amorphous VS4 and crystalline VS4 samples during the lithiation/delithiation process.63 NMR spectroscopy, S K-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy and the pair distribution function were employed by Grey and co-workers to further clarify the Li storage mechanism of VS4. They found that a complex redox interaction involving electron transfer between the cations and the anions results in the destruction of the S–S dimers in VS4 and the formation of metastable intermediates, such as Li3VS4.59
Huang et al. prepared VS4 with various morphologies for anode materials in LIBs, including hierarchical microflowers, seagrass-like structures, octopus-like structures and urchin-like structures (Fig. 11a).121 The urchin-like VS4 electrode delivers the highest reversible specific capacity and exhibits the best cycling activity at 0.1 A g−1 due to its higher crystallinity (Fig. 11b). Using GO as a growth modifier through a facile hydrothermal method, a VS4/rGO hybrid was first obtained by Shin and co-workers (Fig. 11c).50 At 100 mA g−1, the initial discharge and charge capacities of the hybrid electrode were 1669 and 1105 mA h g−1, respectively. After 100 cycles, the capacity decreased to 954 mA h g−1 (95% of the initial capacity) (Fig. 11d). After that, many VS4/GO and VS4/CNT based materials were developed as anode materials for LIBs.106,109,114,117,118,121,123 It is worth mentioning that Fan et al. coated polythiophene, polypyrrole and polyaniline (PANI) on the surface of VS4 microspheres as anode materials for LIBs.103 They found that VS4 coated with polyaniline exhibited the best activity.

VS4/C hybrids can also act as sulfur host candidates in Li–S batteries.120,127 Sun et al. attached walnut-like VS4 nanosites with an average size of ∼160 nm on the surface of CNTs to obtain a VS4/CNTs/S cathode that exhibited the bamboo-like features of hollow tubes with sectional joints in an Li–S battery (Fig. 11e–g).127 The VS4/CNTs/S cathode delivered a capacity of ∼1100 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2C (1C = 1672 mA g−1, Fig. 11h). The cycling performance was also tested at a current density of 2C (Fig. 11i). After 1200 cycles, a capacity decay of 0.037% per cycle was observed. Furthermore, VS4/C based materials can also be used as separators in Li–S batteries.105,115

4.3 SIBs and PIBs
Based on the sustainable availability of lithium-based materials, sodium-based and potassium-based batteries that can provide chemistry that is similar to LIBs are considered to be ideal alternatives to LIBs.176–184 Nevertheless, the larger radii of Na+ ions (1.02 Å) and K+ ions (1.38 Å) than that of Li+ ions (0.76 Å) notably reduce diffusion kinetics and intensify volume expansion during the electrochemical process, which requires cathode materials with a larger interlayer spacing to reach sufficient mobility for Na+ ions and K+ ions. Vanadium sulfides with sandwich-like lamellar structures have large interlayer spacings for the insertion and extraction of Na+ ions and K+ ions and enable a high specific capacity and good reversibility. Table 3 summarizes vanadium sulfide based materials for SIBs and PIBs.

Vanadium sulfide based materials as anodes for SIBs can be briefly divided into three categories: VS2 based materials, VS4 based materials, and other vanadium sulfide based materials. Chen et al. investigated VS2 NSs as anode materials for SIBs systematically through first-principles calculation.73 They found that the VS2 NSs can retain a layered structure at a low Na+ insertion degree (x ≤ 2.0 in NaxVS2) and transform into a V/Na2S composite during deeper sodiation. Although there are many difficulties in synthesizing ultrathin VS2 NSs as anode materials for SIBs, assemblies constructed from ultrathin VS2 NSs have been developed as anodes for SIBs.53,75,76 Li et al. prepared VS2 nanosheet assemblies (NSAs) as anode materials for SIBs and PIBs through a solvothermal method (Fig. 12a and b).76 When applied as anode materials in SIBs and PIBs, the VS2 NSAs exhibit excellent cycling and rate performance. The specific capacity could be kept at ∼700 mA h g−1 after at least 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 12c). When at 1 A g−1, a specific capacity of 500 mA h g−1 can be maintained even after 200 cycles. When at 2 A g−1, a specific capacity of ∼400 mA h g−1 was attained (Fig. 12d). The VS2 NSAs were also characterized as anode materials for PIBs. When the current density is 100 mA g−1, the initial reversible capacity of VS2 NSAs was ∼80 mA h g−1, which was due to electrolyte decomposition (Fig. 12e). In a subsequent cycle, the specific capacity was recovered (∼380 mA h g−1) and steadily grew to ∼410 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles. When cycling at 500 mA g−1, after 100 cycles, the capacity of the VS2 NSAs was enhanced from ∼290 mA h g−1 to ∼360 mA h g−1. Moreover, when raising the current density from 0.1 to 1 or 2 A g−1, the specific capacity of the VS2 NSAs could be maintained at ∼250 and ∼100 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 12f). Hierarchical spheres constructed from VS2 NSs were synthesized in the absence of an additive by Wei et al. (Fig. 12g).75 When used as anode materials in SIBs at a current density of 0.2 A g−1, after 100 cycles, the VS2 spheres delivered a specific capacity of 720 mA h g−1 (Fig. 12h). The reversible capacity could be retained at 565 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1 (Fig. 12i). Notably, the combination of VS2 and other active materials is another promising means of fabricating high-performance anode materials for SIBs.55

VS4 based materials are also promising electrode materials for SIBs, which can not only be beneficial for charge transfer but can also offer more active sites for Na+.98,100–102,107,110,113,116 Through a hydrothermal method, Li et al. constructed various VS4 microstructures as anode materials for SIBs.98,100–102 By adjusting the pH value, microspheres with diameters of ∼2.5 μm for VS4-10, ∼3.0 μm for VS4-5 and ∼3.5 μm for VS4-3 were obtained (Fig. 13a–c).100 As shown in Fig. 13d, the VS4-5 electrode exhibits the best cycling and rate performance. In 2015, Mai et al. prepared a VS4/GO composite as an anode material for SIBs.113 It showed superior stability with almost no capacity fading over 50 cycles (∼241 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 100 mA g−1). Since then, different VS4/GO composites have been obtained for use as anode materials in SIBs.107,110,116 Sun et al. anchored uniform cuboid-shaped VS4 NPs on GO to obtain a VS4/GO anode for SIBs (Fig. 13e).116 They found that the VS4/GO composite exhibits more stable electrochemical performance in an ester-based electrolyte than that in an ether-based electrolyte. The rate capabilities of the VS4/GO composite in the ester-based electrolyte were characterized by two rounds of rate cycling measurements from 0.1 to 20 A g−1 (Fig. 13f). The average capacities were 605, 547, 507, 469, 460, and 446 mA h g−1 at rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1 A g−1 in the first round, respectively. For the second round, at rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 A g−1, the average capacities were 608, 552, 471, 422, 340, 238, 173 and 123 mA h g−1, respectively. When the current density was set back to 0.1 A g−1, the capacity returned to 606 mA h g−1. The cycling performance of the VS4/GO composite in an ester-based electrolyte at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 is shown in Fig. 13g. After 300 cycles, the VS4/GO composite could maintain stable cycling with a capacity of ∼402 mA h g−1.

Compared to LIBs, SIBs and PIBs are still in an early stage of development. The low tap density and the resultant low volumetric energy density of vanadium sulfide based materials hinder their applications as anode materials in SIBs and PIBs. More efforts are required to develop vanadium sulfide based hybrids and investigate their reaction mechanisms in electrochemical processes in order to explore more clues toward optimum electrode material design.
4.4 Multivalent-ion batteries
As alternatives to alkali metal batteries, multivalent ion batteries (ZIBs, MIBs, and AIBs) are of great interest for power storage. Owing to the multiple electrons involved in redox reactions, multivalent-ion batteries that can reach a higher specific capacity and energy density have received notable attention in recent years.16,185–187 The development of MIBs is impeded by several factors, such as reversible depositing and stripping on Mg metal surfaces and sluggish Mg2+ diffusion in host lattices.15 Because of the higher gravimetric capacity (2980 mA h g−1) and volumetric capacity (8040 mA h cm−3) of aluminum anodes, AIBs have also been proposed recently.14,188 In practice, trivalent Al3+ inevitably induces more kinetic issues.14 Several factors can lead to poor kinetics in cathode reactions, including strong electrostatic interactions, difficult charge compensation, difficult interfacial charge transfer and the competition between the intercalation pathway and the conversion way. ZIBs have drawn ample attention owing to a high theoretical capacity (5585 mA h cm−3), low redox potential (−0.76 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode), high stability in aqueous solution, low cost and high abundance.16,187,189 However, the Zn2+ ions in the aqueous solution have strong electrostatic interactions with the cathode materials. To address the above-mentioned issues, materials without oxygen (carbides, sulfides, nitrides, etc.) can serve as cathode materials to alleviate electrostatic interaction and enable the fast diffusion of multivalent ions. As typical materials, vanadium sulfides can serve as cathode candidates for multivalent-ion batteries because their structures are favorable to fast ion diffusion and the maintenance of structural integrity during a repetitive charge and discharge process.56,88 Recent papers on this issue are surveyed and the electrochemical performance of vanadium sulfide based materials has been summarized in Table 4.

In the past few years, extensive research efforts have been focused on VS2 based structures as cathode materials for multivalent-ion batteries.51,64,72,85,88 Jin et al. developed expanded VS2 nanoflowers with ultra-large interlayer spacing in 2-ethylhexylamine as cathode materials for MIBs through a one-pot solvothermal method, in which the 2-ethylhexylamine served as both the solvent and the intercalant (Fig. 14a).51 The annealed VS2 nanoflowers were obtained by annealing expanded VS2 nanoflowers at 400 °C to remove the 2-ethylhexylamine molecules (Fig. 14b). The expanded VS2 electrode exhibited better rate performance than the annealed VS2 electrode (Fig. 14c). The expanded VS2 electrode delivered a capacity of 249 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles at 100 mA g−1. When the current density was increased stepwise, the expanded VS2 electrode reached average capacities of 212, 179, 140 and 102 mA h g−1 at 300, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. After the current density was set back to 100 mA g−1, the capacity of the expanded VS2 electrode returned to 232 mA h g−1. In contrast, the annealed VS2 electrode exhibited very poor capacities at the same current densities. Moreover, when cycling at 1000 mA g−1, the expanded VS2 electrode delivered a higher capacity than the annealed VS2 electrode (Fig. 14d). Based on the above data, researchers found that 2-ethylhexylamine on the surface of VS2 NSs is beneficial for maintaining the integrity of the host framework.

VS2 NSs also show good electrochemical properties when serving as cathode materials in aqueous ZIBs.72,85 In 2017, Mai et al. first prepared VS2 NSs as a cathode material for ZIBs (Fig. 14e). The cycling stability of the VS2 NSs is characterized at 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. 14f). The VS2 electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 112.3 mA h g−1 and a specific capacity of 110.9 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. Moreover, the VS2 NS electrode could reach average capacities of 190.3, 159.1, 146.3, 136.8, 121.5, and 115.5 mA h g−1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 14g).
The open channels between the atomic chains of VS4 offer plentiful active sites for multivalent ion diffusion and storage.56 Based on this principle, various VS4 based materials have been explored as cathode materials for multivalent-ion batteries.56,111,112,119 VS4 nanodendrites have been developed through a hydrothermal method in the presence of block copolymer F127 at 160 °C as a cathode material for MIBs (Fig. 15a).56 The cycling performance of VS4 nanodendrites was measured at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 15b). After the activation process during the initial few cycles, the polarization decreased, the capacity of the VS4 nanodendrites was enhanced, and the maximum reversible capacity was able to reach 177 mA h g−1 after 133 cycles, and retained 150 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles. When the current density was 500 mA g−1, the discharge capacity retained 75.2 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles. Jiao et al. prepared a flower-like VS4/GO composite as a cathode for AIBs (Fig. 15c).119Fig. 15d shows the cycling performance of the as-obtained flower-like VS4/GO composite at 100 mA g−1. After 100 cycles, the reversible capacity of the VS4/GO composite was able to retain 80 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of above 90%. A VS4@rGO composite was used as a cathode material in ZIBs.112 The VS4@rGO composite cathode shows good rate and cycling stability. When increasing the current density tenfold from 0.2 to 2 A g−1, a reversible capacity retention of up to 83.7% was observed (Fig. 15e). Moreover, when the current density was 1 A g−1, the VS4@rGO composite cathode delivered a specific capacity of 180 mA h g−1 after 165 cycles. The researchers also found that rGO in the composite can improve the cycling and the rate performance of the VS4@rGO composite cathode remarkably.

As discussed in this section, multivalent metal ions have strong electrostatic interactions with many vanadium sulfide based cathode materials in multivalent-ion batteries, thus causing slow metal ion diffusion, which could be addressed by structural engineering and exploring new vanadium sulfide based cathode materials. However, the development of multivalent-ion batteries is still in its embryonic stage, and the electrochemical mechanisms and the interactions between the electrodes, electrolytes and the ions need to be explored further in the future.
5. Application of vanadium sulfide based materials in energy conversion
5.1 HER
The hydrogen industry is expected to solve the problem of environmental pollution and fossil fuel shortage within our generation.190,191 Owing to its environmentally friendly nature and high energy density, hydrogen is considerable to be a viable energy alternative to petroleum in the current energy system.190,192,193 To solve the problems of pollution and shortage, an effective HER is a necessary energy conversion process that is significant for its capability of developing a sustainable hydrogen based industrial system. Noble metal based catalysts exhibit unrivaled catalytic performance for the HER in electrochemical water splitting; however their scarcity and high cost impede general application in the global energy system.48,194,195 As a result, discovering inexpensive alternatives with good catalytic performance has pivotal importance in the field of hydrogen energy.196 Various non-Pt electrocatalysts including metal carbides,197,198 chalcogenides,192,199–201 phosphides,202–204 and low-Pt electrocatalysts (for example, platinum group metal based alloys) have been developed.194 Among them, TMDs have drawn tremendous attention owing to their 2D structures and high catalytic activity toward the HER.205–207 Because of the fact that high conductivity facilitates fast electron transport, metallic TMDs with nanostructures, such as VS2, would be good HER electrocatalysts. Through first-principles calculations, Shu et al. found that both 2H- and 1T-phase VS2 monolayers exhibit superior catalytic activity because of their metallic properties.208 They also proposed that preparing VS2 under V-rich conditions could facilitate catalysts with high HER catalytic activity.
To explore the HER activity of VS2 experimentally, various VS2 based materials with regulated nanostructures were developed and their HER activities are summarized in Table 5.74,81,86,92,93,130,208 Wang et al. grew vertical VS2 nanoplates on carbon paper with high density for catalyzing the HER (Fig. 16a and c).86 The thickness and the lateral dimension of the nanoplates were approximately 30 and 800 nm, respectively (Fig. 16b and d). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and the HRTEM image of the VS2 nanoplate showed that the nanoplate had a single crystalline structure (Fig. 16e and f). The lattice spacing of 0.58 nm was in agreement with the (001) spacing of VS2, as shown in Fig. 16f. The elemental mapping images illustrated that V and S were distributed homogeneously in an individual VS2 nanoplate (Fig. 16g). The as-obtained hybrid sample exhibited excellent HER performance. The overpotential of the VS2 nanoplate arrays on carbon paper required at −10, −50 and −100 mA cm−2 was 42, 83 and 97 mV, respectively, and the corresponding Tafel slope was only 36 mV dec−1 (Fig. 16h and i). VS2 microflowers that consisted of VS2 NSs with rich defects were synthesized through a one-pot solvothermal method for catalyzing the HER (Fig. 16j and k).74 The prepared solvothermal VS2 catalysts exhibited good HER activity. The overpotential required to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is 47 mV, which is much lower than that of other contrasting samples (Fig. 16l). The Tafel slope of the prepared solvothermal VS2 catalysts was only 36 mV dec−1, which is comparable to that of the Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 16m). The study found that the excellent catalytic activity toward the HER could be ascribed to the rich defects that originated during the solvothermal process. In addition, Ni3S2/VS2 heterostructures with and without nitrogen doping were fabricated for overall water splitting by Pan et al. (Fig. 16n–t).91 The Ni3S2/VS2 heterostructures without doping exhibit good OER performance with a low overpotential (227 mV @ 10 mA cm−2, Fig. 16q and r) and the Ni3S2/VS2 heterostructures with nitrogen doping show high catalytic activity toward the HER (151 mV @ 10 mA cm−2, Fig. 16s and t). When using the pure Ni2S3/VS2 and the N-doped Ni2S3/VS2 hybrid NSs as the anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively, overall water splitting can be performed at a cell voltage of 1.648 V for a current density of 10 mA cm−2. In addition, the VS2 nanostructures were also hybridized with other nanomaterials, such as MoS2, for enhancing HER performance.92,93 For example, Song et al. integrated a lamellar heterostructure of MoS2 nanodots and VS2 NSs for electrocatalyzing the HER.92 However, VS2 based hybrids need more attention and the underlying catalytic mechanisms need further developed.

5.2 OER
The OER plays a significant role in various electrochemical processes, such as water splitting.209,210 Nowadays, ruthenium and iridium oxides are commonly used as catalysts for the OER, although these metals are cost prohibitive. Therefore, extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing various materials as catalysts for the OER, such as carbon materials,211 oxides,212–214 hydroxides,215 sulfides,216 Prussian blue based materials217 and metal–organic framework based materials.218 Vanadium sulfides, especially VS2, have 2D or 3D structures with good electrical conductivity and abundant catalytic active sites and have received most of the attention of researchers. For this reason, vanadium sulfides have been hybridized with other materials for catalyzing the OER.91,129
Chai et al. developed a strategy for depositing Ni–Fe hydroxides on an amorphous vanadium sulfide/nickel foam hybrid framework to obtain a hierarchical structure of NiFe(OH)x/VS/NF NSs as OER catalysts (Fig. 17a and b).129 At an overpotential of 276 mV, a current density of 200 mA cm−2 can be realized for the NiFe(OH)x/VS/NF NS sample that exhibits the best OER activity among the tested samples (Fig. 17c). Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the NiFe(OH)x/VS/NF NSs was determined to be 75 mV dec−1, indicating good OER kinetics (Fig. 17d). In conclusion, research on vanadium based materials for catalyzing the OER is scarce and requires more attention in the future.

6. Summary and outlook
Vanadium sulfide based nanomaterials have been recently exhibited to be potential electrode materials for various energy applications because of their highly tunable and controllable structures and chemical compositions. In this article, we summarize the recent development of vanadium sulfide based materials for energy storage and conversion. Two typical vanadium sulfides, VS2 and VS4, have been explored for various applications in the energy field. Owing to their different structural features, VS2 and VS4 exhibit different activities when used as electrode materials for energy storage and conversion. Other types of vanadium sulfides have also been considered with respect to their synthetic methods and applications in the energy field. Moreover, strategies for the synthesis of various vanadium sulfide based materials have been reviewed and classified. The goal of this review is to present the relationship between the microcosmic structural features, the properties and the activity of vanadium sulfide based materials, which is crucial for designing and preparing energetic materials.
Despite significant progress in developing vanadium sulfide based materials, many problems need to be further explored in this field. Future efforts should focus on the following aspects.
(1) While significant advances have been realized in the synthesis of VS4-based materials and their applications in the field of energy, research on theoretical computations for VS4-based materials is still insufficient. A few publications have discussed the relationship between the structural features and activities of these VS4-based materials, which is a promising approach to promoting the development of synthetic technology for VS4-based materials.
(2) Conventional synthetic methods for vanadium sulfide nanostructures are usually hydrothermal/solvothermal methods. When using these methods, the yield of the products is considerable and the morphology of the products often attains microscale assemblies. Given that decreasing the size of the products would bring about more active sites, synthetic methods for tuning the size and the morphology of vanadium sulfides should be explored in the future. Moreover, the effect of the additives on the morphology is another important research direction in this field. In the presence of additives, nanoscale vanadium sulfide materials with a high specific surface area can be obtained. In addition, although constructing vanadium sulfides/carbon composites has been realized in the past few years, the means of hybridizing vanadium sulfides with other materials, especially with ultrathin materials, remains a challenge. Moreover, the preparation and the application of VS2-based 3D frameworks have rarely been researched. The metallic nature of VS2 determines that VS2-based frameworks possess many advantages compared to other sulfide-based frameworks, which is significant in realizing high-energy-density batteries and flexible supercapacitor devices. Therefore, VS2-based 3D frameworks are highly promising electrode materials for energy storage and deserve further research.
(3) As emerging storage devices, non-aqueous multivalent-ion batteries have multiple benefits such as a high theoretical capacity, safety and low cost. Developing suitable cathode materials is a challenge for these battery systems. The diversity in the composition, structure and activity of vanadium sulfide based cathodes gives them great potential for discovering suitable candidates for non-aqueous multivalent-ion batteries. Although a few reports have demonstrated that vanadium sulfide based materials can be applied as cathodes in non-aqueous multivalent-ion batteries, more focus should be given to enhancing the activity of vanadium sulfide based cathode materials as follows: (i) hybridizing other active materials with vanadium sulfides as cathodic materials for multivalent-ion batteries would further increase the specific capacity and cycling stability and (ii) exploring appropriate electrolytes and storage mechanisms when using vanadium sulfide based materials as cathodic materials. In the future, more vanadium sulfide based materials will be explored. However, more advanced industrial methods are needed to aggregate more practical energy storage devices to solve the energy dilemma.
(4) Due to their low cost, high safety, and high energy density, aqueous ZIBs have been considered as promising energy storage devices for large-scale energy storage. Generally, vanadium sulfides show mild electrochemical activity and are very compatible with aqueous battery systems. Also, there exist possibilities for the synthesis of vanadium sulfide based nanomaterials with various compositions, crystal phases, and morphologies. Thus, we are convinced that it is significant for the application of vanadium sulfide based electrode materials for aqueous ZIBs. In future research, alleviating the dissolution problem of vanadium sulfides in water is to be addressed. Moreover, when using vanadium sulfide based nanomaterials as cathode materials in ZIBs, the Zn2+ storage mechanism should be characterized more thoroughly. The details of the morphology evolution of vanadium sulfide based nanomaterials, the effect of the electrolytes on the electrodes, and the relationship between the electrode and electrolyte and battery performance should be investigated, which could accelerate the development of vanadium sulfide based electrodes for application in aqueous ZIBs.
(5) For the application of vanadium sulfides in energy conversion, the controllable synthesis of a VS2 monolayer that can exhibit high activity for electrocatalyzing the HER is required. By adjusting various parameters, such as pH, temperature, and additives, the type and number of defects on the monolayer can be controlled accurately. Further functionalization of the VS2 monolayer should also be developed.
(6) Theoretical calculations and simulation are significant for investigating the thermal dynamics and kinetics of vanadium sulfide based materials during the charge and discharge process and the electrochemical conversion process. Calculation and simulation can be associated with the characterization of the intermediated products, which will enrich the capacity for understanding the activities of the vanadium sulfide based materials on a spatial and low dimensional level. Furthermore, systematical theoretical research on vanadium sulfide based hybrids, such as detemining active sites in vanadium sulfides based catalysts, the effect of the interfaces on the activity and the simulation of the diffusion barriers, should be strengthened, which can push the development of synthetic technology for vanadium sulfide based hybrids.
Given that the research on vanadium sulfides for energy storage and conversion has just begun, there is still considerable research to be done. The experience from this research can also be applied to other TMD based materials, which will promote the future development of energy storage and conversion.
