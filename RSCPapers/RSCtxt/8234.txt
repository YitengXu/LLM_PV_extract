    , Accepted 22nd April 2021First published on 22nd April 2021AbstractCalcium (Ca)-based rechargeable batteries (CRBs) have been considered one of the most promising post-lithium ion battery technologies because of the natural abundance of Ca, high volumetric capacity compared to monovalent metal batteries, and the low reduction potential of Ca2+/Ca. Recently, a breakthrough of Ca reversible plating and stripping at the Ca metal anode in carbonate electrolytes has induced the study of Ca rechargeable batteries. This critical review presents the state-of-the-art progress made in exploring potential electrode materials including Ca metal anodes, alternative graphite and alloy-type anodes, and cathode materials undergoing interaction or conversion reactions. Suitable electrolytes are also required to ensure the compatibility of each cell component, which is essential toward high-performance Ca full batteries. The performance assessment and mechanism analysis are further discussed to evaluate the current progress and existing challenges regarding the performance promise and insufficient understanding of the Ca battery technology. To conclude, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and challenges that need to be addressed to promote the commercialization of CRBs.Chunhong ChenChunhong Chen is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

1. Introduction
The ever-increasing energy demand, limited fossil fuel reserves, and increasing environmental concerns have made the development of sustainable energy crucial. The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, leads to an inconsistent power supply, necessitating energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on electrochemical reactions provide promising solutions with their high energy conversion efficiency, high flexibility, and wide affordability.1,2 Since the early 1990s, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have become the most common choice to power portable electric devices. However, emerging applications such as electric vehicles and smart grids require new battery technologies with higher energy densities, lower cost, and better safety than current LIBs.3–6 Additionally, the unevenly distributed lithium resources in the Earth's crust (22 ppm) raise concerns for large-scale supply in the future. While the long-term availability of lithium resources remains debatable,6 the recent leap in the price of lithium carbonate, i.e., the main precursor for lithium, clearly indicates the need to explore post-LIB technologies.7
Multivalent rechargeable batteries have been considered promising candidates because, in principle, multivalent ion insertion/extraction is associated with multiple electron transfer,8 potentially leading to higher energy densities than monovalent ions can carry.9 In addition, non-toxic multivalent elements are much more abundant in the Earth's crust (41500 ppm for Ca, 27640 ppm for Mg, and 83000 ppm for Al),8 implying lower material costs. Some multivalent metal (i.e., Mg and Al) anodes also show dendrite-free plating behaviors, indicating ideal metal anodes for high-energy and safe energy storage devices.10–12 Ca rechargeable batteries (CRBs), especially those based on nonaqueous electrolytes, have several advantages over Mg or Al-based chemistries: (i) the reduction potential of Ca/Ca2+ (−2.9 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) is close to that of lithium (−3.04 V vs. SHE for Li/Li+) and much lower than that of other multivalent cations (−0.76 V vs. SHE for Zn/Zn2+, −2.4 V vs. for Mg/Mg2+, and −1.7 V vs. SHE for Al/Al3+), indicating potentially high voltages and energy densities for CRBs;12 (ii) polarization strength (P = qr2, where q is the charge number of the cation and r is the ion radius) of Ca2+ (1.92 × 104 pm−2) is smaller than that of Mg2+ (4.73 × 104 pm−2) and Al3+ (5.66 × 104 pm−2),13,14 which allows faster cation diffusion kinetics; (iii) different from the inevitable dendrite formation in Li metal batteries, the Ca metal anodes are regarded as dendrite-free during cycling, indicating safe Ca metal batteries.15–17
The configuration and working principle for CRBs resemble those of LIBs, where the charge carrier Ca2+ shuttles back and forth between the anode and the cathode during releasing and storing electrochemical energy. However, progress in developing CRBs faces some fundamental challenges; for instance, the Ca metal anode is irreversible in polar aprotic electrolytes due to the formation of Ca2+ blocking films on Ca metal during the first discharge; thus, compatible electrolytes are needed.18 This issue engenders difficulties in choosing compatible anode materials and electrolytes. Additionally, it is also challenging to search for suitable cathode materials with high voltage, high-rate capability and large Ca storage capacities.19,20 The relatively large ionic size and divalent nature of Ca2+, compared to the extensively investigated monovalent ion systems (i.e., Li+ and Na+), tend to make the intercalation kinetics in the diffusion channels of cathodes sluggish. Moreover, Ca2+ with a large ionic size intercalated in the host is predicted to cause large volume changes (i.e., 25% for CaxTiSe2,21 68–90% for β-MoO2,22 25% for spinel CaMn2O4,23 and 20% for perovskite CaMO3,24 M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni), which triggers a premature structural degradation of the cathode structure. Therefore, exploring advanced electrodes is the key to achieving practical CRBs.
This review presents the recent accomplishments and challenges for CRBs. For anode materials, the correlations among the plating/stripping behaviors of Ca metal, electrolyte formulations, and electrochemical performance have been presented. Non-Ca metal anodes, such as graphite and Sn, are also discussed. For cathode materials, the intercalation process in materials like van der Waals layered compounds, transition metal oxides, Prussian blue, and polyanion compounds and conversion reactions in materials based on sulfur, oxygen and organic materials have been covered. Finally, studies reporting performance and fundamental findings are provided in context to give fresh perspectives for the future development of CRBs.
2. Anode materials
2.1 Calcium metal anodes
Ca metal has been considered as the most attractive anode material for CRBs due to its lowest working potential, high volumetric capacity of 2073 A h L−1 and high specific capacity of 1337 mA h g−1.15 However, efficient plating and stripping of Ca metal at room temperature has not been achieved until recently. An early attempt was made by Staniewicz et al.25 studying the electrochemical behaviors of a Ca–SO2Cl2 system, which failed to produce any plating Ca because of the formation of an ionic insulating CaCl2 passivation layer on Ca metal. To estimate whether the established aprotic electrolytes in LIBs were suitable to Ca metal anodes, Aurbach et al.18 extensively cycled Ca in a few organic electrolytes using acetonitrile (AN), tetrahydrofuran (THF), γ-butyrolactone and propylene carbonate (PC) solvents with Ca(ClO4)2, Ca(BF4)2, TBABF4 and LiClO4 salts. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses (Fig. 1a) exhibited high current densities of approximately 3 mA cm−2 for Ca stripping but the Ca deposition current was negligible (<0.5 mA cm−2) in all electrolytes. Structural characterization presented ionic insulating phases (i.e., Ca(OH)2, CaCO3, CaCl2, alkoxides, esters and carboxylates) on the Ca metal surface (Fig. 1b). The ionic insulating film was believed to prevent Ca deposition (Fig. 1c). Henceforth, the Ca metal battery study was stalled, especially after the successful triumph of commercial LIBs in the 1990s.

In 2016, Ponrouch et al.26 reported the first reversible Ca plating-stripping in a 0.45 M Ca(BF4)2 ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate (EC/PC) electrolyte at elevated temperatures (75–100 °C). Apparent redox peaks for Ca plating on stainless steel appeared in CV curves and remained over 30 cycles at 100 °C (Fig. 2a). The reversible Ca metal anode was found to be salt-, concentration- and temperature-dependent, where less activity towards Ca deposition was observed in Ca(ClO4)2 and Ca(TFSI)2-based electrolytes and a low concentration electrolyte (0.3 M Ca(BF4)2 EC/PC) or at low operating temperatures. The harsh working conditions, especially the high cycling temperatures, make this pioneering work unacceptable for practical application. To figure out whether high temperature is indispensable to Ca deposition, Biria et al.27 cycled a three-electrode cell (Cu as the working electrode, Ca as the reference electrode and Pt as the counter electrode) in a 1 M Ca(BF4)2 EC/PC electrolyte at room temperature (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, Ca was reversibly deposited and removed over 10 cycles with coulombic efficiencies (CEs) up to 95%. It was tentatively explained that the Cu substrate and room temperature conditions suppressed the growth of a CaF2 film (Fig. 2c).

Another pioneering study for reversible Ca metal anodes was conducted by Wang et al.,28 who found that Ca was able to plate in a 1 M Ca(BH4)2 THF electrolyte at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 with a low polarization potential of ∼100 mV in excess of 50 cycles at room temperature (Fig. 2d) while no electrochemical response was observed in the Ca(TFSI)2 THF electrolyte, implying the paramount role of BH4− anions. The function of BH4− was investigated through linear sweep voltammetry measurements of Ca striping-plating on Pt or Au electrodes in the Ca(BH4)2 THF electrolyte.29 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed a smooth Ca deposition on the Au electrode; in contrast, the Pt surface was covered by discrete Ca islands (Fig. 2e). The difference was originated from the different BH4− dehydrogenation rates on Pt and Au substrates. The latter exhibited slower dehydrogenation to allow lateral diffusion of hydrides prior to Ca2+ adsorption, leading to uniform Ca2+ reduction (Fig. 2e). Apart from the BH4− anion, the cation also plays an important role in regulating the Ca deposition. Jie et al.30 reported that in a Ca‖Au coin cell with a 0.4 M Ca(BH4)2–0.4 M LiBH4 THF electrolyte, the initial CE was 84.4%, which increased to 99.1% after 5 cycles and remained at approximate 97.6% over 200 cycles (Fig. 2f and g). In contrast, the CEs of the cells cycling in a Ca(BH4)2 THF electrolyte were about 80% in the first 10 cycles and dropped to 60% after 20 cycles. The significantly improved cycling stability in the Ca(BH4)2–LiBH4 electrolyte was attributable to the decreased coordination number of Ca2+ by Li+ in the first solvation shell, suggesting the well-manipulated coordination structure of Ca2+ in the electrolyte. Note that the THF-based electrolyte presents low anodic stability (∼3 V), which would limit the choice of high-voltage cathodes for CRBs.
In order to obtain a highly anodic stable electrolyte, a borate salt, calcium tetrakis (hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate (Ca[B(hfip)4]2), was prepared31,32 by reacting Ca(BH4)2 with hexafluoroisopropanol in DME, as shown in Fig. 3a.31 The stripping and plating of Ca in a 0.25 M Ca[B(hfip)4]2/DME electrolyte was demonstrated by CV tests in a three-electrode cell, showing low overpotentials for Ca deposition (at −0.3 V) and dissolution (at 0.22 V) (Fig. 3b). These values imply rapid kinetics and low desolvation energy for the borate electrolyte. Indeed, the [B(hfip)4]− anion has been demonstrated to be effective for reversible Mg cycling in a Mg[B(hfip)4]2 electrolyte.33,34 Li et al.31 calculated the average O–Ca bond length of DME-coordinated Ca2+ in Ca[B(hfip)4]2/DME to be 2.43 Å, which was longer than the 2.06 Å for O–Mg in the analogous Mg electrolyte, suggesting the lower desolvation energy of Ca2+ in the electrolyte. The cycling stability of Ca metal in a borate-based electrolyte was measured by cycling Ca//Ca symmetric cells at 0.2 mA cm−2 over 100 hours (Fig. 3c). The anodic stability of the Ca[B(hfip)4]2/DME electrolyte was measured to be 3.9 V, 4.2 V and 4.8 V for Pt, stainless steel and Al electrodes (Fig. 3d), respectively, which are much higher than that for Ca(BH4)2 THF as aforementioned.

To optimize the cyclability of Ca metal anodes in Ca[B(hfip)4]2-based electrolytes, parameters such as the electrolyte concentration, types of ether solvents, and working electrodes were controlled. Shyamsunder et al.32 found that Ca was able to cycle with a high current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, a low polarization of 0.17 V and high CEs of 92–95% over 35 cycles when increasing the electrolyte concentration from 0.2 M to 0.5 M. By measuring the Ca plating-stripping behaviors on various substrates (i.e., glassy carbon, Pt, Cu and Al) and electrolytes (i.e., 0.25 M Ca[B(hfip)4]2 in THF, DME or diglyme (DGM)),35 the reversibility of Ca metal was demonstrated to be the best in the DGM electrolyte, in which the longest lifespan over 300 h was presented. These results highlight the importance of solvent selection for stable Ca anodes. The correlations among the ether solvent, anion species and electrochemical behaviours of Ca electrolytes have been thoroughly evaluated by Nathan et al.36 They found that the strong coordination interaction between the ether solvent, such as triglyme, and Ca2+ cation does not necessarily enable reversible calcium deposition. Instead, the strong solvent: Ca2+ coordination disabled Ca deposition by destabilizing the coordinating solvent or by frustrating the desolvation of Ca2+. In contrast, in an electrolyte system with weak solvent: Ca2+ coordination and well-dissociated anion groups (i.e., Ca[B(hfip)4]2 in DME), reversible Ca deposition is feasible to occur. This counterintuitive finding provides new insights toward designing appropriate ether electrolytes for Ca metal anodes by tailoring the solvent: anion/cation coordinating behaviours.
The carbonate and ether-based electrolytes mentioned above pose potential challenges of toxicity and flammability. In order to overcome this issue, ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte systems with wide electrochemical stability windows, low vapor pressure, and low flammability as proven in Li and Mg metal batteries,37–39 have been investigated. As an early attempt, Biria et al.40 dissolved 1 M Ca(BF4)2 in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate. Although in the CV scans, Ca dissolution and deposition appear at −0.15 and 1.5 V, respectively, Ca‖Ca symmetric cells presented high overpotentials near 4 V and low CEs of below 70%. The poor cycling performance was ascribed to the SEI layer containing CaF2, CaS and organic components.41 Other IL electrolytes containing 1-ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidinum bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Pyr14TFSI) and 1-butylpyrrolidinum bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (PyrH14TFSI) were also prepared for Ca metal anodes with large stability windows of about 5.1 V and 3.2 V, respectively.39 However, because of the structural decomposition during the co-intercalation of solvated Ca ions, neither of them can be coupled with TiS2 cathodes with reasonable Ca storage, which limits their application in intercalation CRBs.
In summary, reversible Ca metal anodes have been successfully realized in a series of nonaqueous electrolytes, including Ca(BF4)2 EC/PC,26,27 Ca(BH4)2 THF,28,29 Ca[B(hfip)4]2 DME30,31 and Ca(BF4)2 ILs.40 Their performance, in terms of the electrolyte component, working electrode, plating/stripping overpotentials, CEs, cycle life and stability windows, is summarized in Table 1. Although it is not trivial to directly compare the electrode performance under different working conditions, several key implications can be concluded as guidelines to design better electrolytes for Ca metal anodes in the future. (i) So far, Ca anodes have exhibited the longest cycle life in the Ca[B(hfip)4]2 DGM electrolyte with a high anodic stability window (up to 5 V), which is very important to high-voltage cathodes.35 These superior performances appeal Ca[B(hfip)4]2 electrolytes for viable CRBs. (ii) Precious metals (i.e., Pt and Au) are favorable for Ca plating/stripping. Despite the attractive performance, precious metal electrodes are too expensive to be affordable in practical applications. More studies are required to develop desirable electrolytes for conventional current collectors. (iii) The SEI plays a key role in manipulating Ca peeling/plating processes. In new electrolyte systems, the chemical structures of SEI layers have been characterized case by case. However, whether the new SEI components (i.e., CaF2 and CaH2) are beneficial to Ca deposition is still an open question.42 (iv) The highest rate capacity reported so far for Ca metal is 8 mA cm−2 in a Ca‖Ca Ca[B(hfip)4]2 DGM cell with voltage spikes greater than 0.5 V.35 Although this performance is reasonable for new battery chemistry, it is still far from satisfactory for high-power Ca metal batteries. Overall, future research is suggested to design smart electrolytes and favorable interfaces for stable Ca metal anodes.

2.2 Graphite anodes
Graphite is one of the most well-known anode materials for commercial LIBs because of the high Li storage capacity, the low intercalation potential and the wide affordability of graphite materials.43 Graphite has also been considered promising for post-Li ion rechargeable batteries,44–47 by taking advantage of the knowledge gained from its years of development in commercial LIBs. However, the reversible intercalation of Ca2+ into graphite is not straightforward. An early study by Emery et al.48 showed the chemical synthesis of CaC6 using highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and a molten Li–Ca alloy at 350 °C. Xu et al.49 also obtained stage-I graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) by mixing graphite powder with Ca in the presence of ethylenediamine at elevated temperatures (25–100 °C). Nevertheless, none of these studies indicate the electrochemical intercalation of Ca2+ in graphite at room temperature.
Park et al.50 reported the first reversible (de)intercalation of Ca2+ in graphite at room temperature by selecting an appropriate Ca(BH4)2 dimethylacetamide (DMAc) electrolyte (Fig. 4a). The Ca‖graphite cells were galvanostatically discharged/charged at 50 mA g−1 between 0.2 and 1.5 V vs. Ca2+/Ca. The graphite anode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 97 mA h g−1 and a CE of 83.5%, a cycle capacity of 87 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 50 cycles, and a high rate capacity retention of 75% with the current density increasing from 50 to 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 4b and c). Synchrotron in situ XRD analysis showed that graphite underwent a consecutive staging process during calciation, and the Ic (the lattice distance between two adjacent intercalant layers) values were determined to be 21.2, 17.8 and 14.4 Å for different stages (Fig. 4d). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies confirmed that DMAc solvent molecules were co-intercalated with Ca2+ into graphite galleries. The number of DMAc molecules coordinated with one Ca2+ was determined to be four by measuring the weight changes of graphite electrodes at different discharge and charge states. The configuration of the co-intercalated graphite was therefore proposed to be a stage-2 GIC composed of [Ca–DMAc4]2+ complexes per two graphene sheets (Fig. 4e). Note that the Ca//graphite half-cell presented moderate cycling stability due to the poor reversibility of Ca metal in the DMAc-based electrolyte.

To extend the cycle life of graphite anodes, Pyo's group fabricated a coin cell of graphite‖Ca(TFSI)2 tetraglyme (TEGDME or G4) electrolyte‖activated carbon.51 The activated carbon served as a super-capacitive counter electrode to adsorb/desorb TFSI− during Ca insertion/extraction in graphite, eliminating the complexity and instability of the Ca metal anode in the Ca(TFSI)2 electrolyte. For long-term cycling performance, the graphite experienced no noticeable capacity fading after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 and 1 A g−1, respectively. The configuration of the fully intercalated graphite was depicted as a stage 3 GIC with Ca–G4 complexes parallelly inserted per three graphene layers. To estimate the performance of graphite in full Ca-ion batteries, a graphite‖Ca(TFSI)2 G4 electrolyte‖perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarbonxylic dianhydride cell was further constructed and delivered a capacity retention of 80 mA h g−1 (based on the cathode mass) for 100 cycles.
Although significant progress has been made in the research of graphite anodes, there are still some fundamental issues remaining. First, the correlation between the feasibility of Ca intercalation and the electrolyte components is elusive. Park et al.50 prepared a series of electrolytes for graphite anodes with Ca(BH4)2, Ca(BF4)2, and Ca(PF6)2 salts and AN, DGM, THF, EC/PC and DMAc solvents. Interestingly, Ca intercalation only occurs in the Ca(BH4)2 DMAc electrolyte. Similarly, in Ca(TFIS)2-based electrolytes,51 important reaction currents for graphite intercalation were only observed in the Ca(TFIS)2 G4 electrolyte, instead of Ca(TFIS)2 in EC/DMC/EMC, G1, G2 and G3. Both studies attributed the electrolyte-dependent Ca intercalation to the strong solvation of Ca2+ in specific solvents. However, DFT calculations revealed stronger solvation energy for Ca–DGM than Ca–DMAc complexes, whereas no Ca intercalation was observed in the DGM-based electrolyte. Obviously, the understanding of Ca intercalation conditions is still unclear and even misleading.50 Second, the solvated-Ca-ion intercalation induces large volume expansions (i.e., 215% for DMAc–Ca intercalated graphite50 and 210% for G4-Ca intercalated graphite51). The large volume changes raise two questions: why does the graphite remain stable during cycles under such large volume variations, and will the large volume variations disintegrate practical batteries? Third, the low Ca ion storage capacity of approximately 80 mA h g−1 and the high redox potential of about 0.6 V vs. Ca2+/Ca for the graphite anode would lead to low energy densities for Ca ion full cells, limiting their practical applications.
2.3 Alloy-type anodes
Alloy anodes have been proven effective in accommodating large amounts of Li+, Na+ or K+ by forming M-alloy (M = metal cations) compounds,4,52,53 spurring the exploration of Ca-alloy anodes in CRBs. The initial attempt was reported by Lipson et al.,54 who coupled a calciated Sn anode and a desodiated manganese hexacyanoferrate cathode into a Ca ion full cell, which presented a low capacity of 40 mA h g−1. Then, in the work to study a Sn‖Ca(PF6)2 EC/PC/DMC/EMC‖graphite dual ion battery,55 Wang et al. intensively investigated the phase and stress evolution of a Sn foil anode during calciation/decalciation. The Sn anode was observed to be fully calciated into Ca7Sn6 (Fig. 5a) with a high theoretical capacity of 526 mA h g−1 and a volume expansion of 136.8%. The crystal structure for Ca7Sn6 was depicted as four types of cryptographic structures, in which Ca is surrounded by the six nearest Sn atoms to form a distorted octahedron (Fig. 5b). In situ stress measurements revealed compression stress for Sn foil during the entire calciation/decalciation cycle (Fig. 5c), which is beneficial to prevent the generation and propagation of cracks, thereby ensuring the structural stability of the Sn anode. The excellent stability was further evidenced by an elastic–plastic model proposed by the same group.56 They argued that the absence of tensile stress at the Sn/CaSnx interface and the uniform dispersion of compressive stress on Sn foil concertedly enhanced the electrode stability.

Another possible alloy-type anode material is Si. The Si–Ca phase diagram presents a theoretical capacity of 3818 mA h g−1 for Ca2Si. In a DFT study for CaSi2, Ponrouch et al.57 demonstrated that the (de-)calciation of CaSi2 is possible at voltages between 1.2 V (formation of metastable de-inserted Si) and 0.57 V (formation of stable fcc-Si) (Fig. 5d). When the fcc-Si was calciated to CaSi2, the average reaction voltage was calculated to be 0.37 V with a volume expansion of 306% and a capacity of 557 mA h g−1. A primary potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) experiment was conducted at 100 °C for the CaSi2 anode, showing a specific capacity of 240 mA h g−1 and dealloying/alloying plateaus at 2.75 V and 0.88 V vs. Ca2+/Ca, respectively (Fig. 5e). After one cycle, unfortunately, the CaSi2 anode failed. No following study was found in the literature for Si anodes, implying the difficulty in pursuing Si anodes for CRBs.
Yao et al.58 designed a four-step screening strategy to filter potential alloy-type anodes for CRBs. In particular, all the binary and ternary Ca intermetallic compounds from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) were identified at the beginning, from which Ca-metal alloys could be selected. A few metalloids (Si, Sb, and Ge), transition metals (Al, Cu, Pb, and Bi) and noble metals (Ag, Au, Pt and Pd) were predicted as promising candidates for potential metal-Ca systems by evaluated the reaction voltages, maximum capacities and energy densities (Fig. 5f and g). These candidates were recommended for further experimental validations.
Compared to Ca metal and graphite anodes, alloy-type anodes present limited options (Table 2). Although theoretical studies have forecasted many candidates forming alloy compounds with calcium delivering high capacities and energy densities, few of them have been experimentally validated and typically show ill-shaped voltage profiles and large polarizations. For example, the theoretical capacity of CaSi2 is determined to be 557 mA h g−1. Dealloying reactions between Ca and Si have only been happened at 100 °C with a limited capacity of 240 mA h g−1,57 providing a charge depth of 43%. A similar low alloying depth was found for a Sn anode, which presents a capacity of 40 mA h g−1,54 referring to 7.5% of the theoretical capacity of 527 mA h g−1.55 The incompetence to realize the high theoretical capacities of alloy-type anodes could be attributed to the sluggish kinetics of calciation/decalciation reactions.59–61 First, the low electronic conductivity of alloy-type anodes, such as Si, would impede rapid charge transfer across the interface. Second, the activation barriers for large Ca2+ diffusion in (de)alloyed crystals would be high (i.e., 0.45–2.47 eV for Ca diffusion in Ca7Sn6),58 and therefore lead to slow ion diffusivity in alloy-type anodes. Third, facile Ca2+ diffusion would also be retarded by thick SEI layers formed on the surface of alloy-type anodes. The formation of a SEI is always associated with low CEs (∼80%)55 and serious degradation of Ca electrolytes during discharge. It is certain that the ionic diffusivity, alloying depth and volume expansion62 are critical factors on the path towards designing smart alloy-type anodes. Nevertheless, very limited studies have been carried out to elucidate the above issues and hence, intensive investigations in these directions are recommended for devising suitable strategies to promote the development of alloy-type anodes in CRBs.

3. Cathode materials
Although anode materials with promising electrochemical performance have been demonstrated, associated with the design of specific non-aqueous electrolytes, CRBs are still far from a commercial reality. This is due to the lack of suitable cathode materials which are expected to deliver high capacities with multivalent redox for Ca2+, high voltages and excellent reversibility in desirable organic electrolytes. In this section, we will provide a rigorous review of the state-of-the-art cathodes for nonaqueous CRBs, including intercalation-type and conversion-type materials.
3.1 Intercalation-type cathodes
Intercalation cathodes refer to materials with an open framework of interconnected sites, wherein the cations can diffuse, and an electronic band structure is able to accept/donor electrons reversibly.17 Intercalation compounds are the most successful cathode materials for commercial LIBs because of their good cycling stability, fast Li-ion diffusion and high redox potentials.63 These compounds are also widely investigated for CRBs. According to the phase-structured materials, the intercalation cathodes can be categorized as layered compounds, transition metal oxides, polyanions, and Prussian blue analogs.

3.1.1 van der Waals layered compounds. 
One of the most critical challenges for Ca cathode materials is the slow Ca diffusion kinetics due to the divalent nature and the large size of Ca2+.17 van der Waals layered compounds possess two dimensional ionic diffusion channels and weak interlayer forces,64,65 providing potentially fast Ca2+ diffusion pathways and high structural flexibility.66,67 van der Waals layered compounds comprise a large group of materials including layered oxides, sulfides, selenides and MXenes, and some of them have shown effectiveness in Ca2+ storage.
V2O5 is a representative layered structure, comprising edge- and corner-sharing VO5 layers packed through van der Waals force. Hayashi et al.68,69 reported a high Ca storage capacity of ∼450 mA h g−1 for amorphous V2O5 in a Ca(ClO4)2 AN electrolyte. Compared to crystalline V2O5, the amorphous phase presented larger capacities and lower overpotentials (Fig. 6a), possibly arising from the isotropic structure of the amorphous phase. In addition, DFT calculations presented the thermodynamic stability and Ca migration energy barriers in various V2O5 polymorphs.67,70,71 They showed that the Ca ion diffusion barrier in the δ phase (∼200 mV) was much lower than in the α phase (1700–1900 mV) (Fig. 6c), suggesting that δ-CaV2O5 is more plausible than α-CaV2O5 to reversibly store Ca ions at practical currents. Further DFT studies72 revealed that the Ca ion diffusion barriers for metastable polymorphs (i.e., 0.56–0.65 eV for δ′-V2O5, 0.59–0.68 eV for γ′-V2O5 and 0.37–0.55 eV for ρ′-V2O5) are substantially lower than those for thermodynamically stable α-V2O5 (1.76–1.86 eV), implying possibly high-power capability for metastable V2O5 cathodes. It was also found that PC solvent-treated V2O5 exhibited a specific capacity of 260 mA h g−1, whereas dried V2O5 cathodes presented a negligible capacity of 20 mA h g−1 (Fig. 6b).73 The difference was attributed to the shielded electrostatic interactions between the Ca2+ intercalant and the PC-embedded V2O5. A similar phenomenon was observed in water-mediated organic electrolytes for V2O5 cathodes, where water molecules were inserted to enlarge the interlayer space for V2O5.74,75 Note that this strategy is not desirable in practical CRBs because of water reduction at high voltages.

Tojo et al.76 evaluated the Ca intercalation performance in orthorhombic MoO3 (α-MoO3), another typical van der Waals layered material composed of octahedral MoO6 sheets (Fig. 6d). In a Ca(TFSI)2 AN electrolyte, the MoO3 delivered discharge and charge capacities of 186 and 116 mA h g−1, respectively, providing a large irreversible capacity of 70 mA h g−1. The irreversible capacity was attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte in the 1st cycle. A minor interlayer expansion from 13.85 to 14.07 Å for MoO3 after full calciation was detected by ex situ XRD,77 which is responsible for excellent electrochemical performance. Furthermore, molybdenum bronze (CaxMoO3·(H2O)0.41) was prepared as a stable cathode material with high capacities of 90.7 mA h g−1 and 85.3 mA h g−1 in the 1st and 50th cycles at 276 mA g−1 (Fig. 6e).78 Unlike pristine α-MoO3, molybdenum bronze possesses crystal water between layers (Fig. 6f), which shields the electrostatic force between Ca2+ and the host structure, thereby promoting the Ca2+ diffusion in CaxMoO3·(H2O)0.41.
TiS2 composed of two hexagonal close-packed sulfide layers has also been investigated as a Ca cathode.79 The electrochemical intercalation of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in TiS2 was compared in carbonated-based electrolytes at 100 °C.80 Galvanostatic experiments in a Ca battery exhibited highly rate-dependent capacities of 520 mA h g−1 at C/100 and 210 mA h g−1 at C/50, respectively (Fig. 6g), reflecting the sluggish diffusion of Ca2+ in TiS2. DFT calculations proposed two plausible diffusion pathways for Ca2+ in TiS2 from octahedral to octahedral sites, involving intermediate occupation of the 2d tetrahedral site. The energy barrier determined to be 0.75 eV (Fig. 6h) is lower than that the ∼1.14 eV for Mg2+, consistent with the negligible Mg storage capacity in TiS2 under the same conditions. Two new phases for calciated TiS2 were observed during Ca2+ insertion,81 which were donated as phase 1 and phase 3 with expanded c parameters of 27.7 Å and 36.9 Å (compared to the 5.7 Å for pristine TiS2), respectively. The huge lattice expansion was attributed to a solvated-Ca-ion co-intercalation reaction, similar to the graphite anodes in Section 2.2. Nevertheless, TiS2 cathodes presented a short cycle life, limiting the feasibility of their application as Ca cathodes.
In brief, van der Waals layered compounds with large interlayer space and weak interlayer forces have been demonstrated to be practical in accommodating large amounts of Ca2+ as potential cathodes. However, the cycle life and reversible capacities are far from satisfactory (Table 3). Several suggestions are provided to improve the performance of this type of Ca cathode: (i) utilization of a co-intercalation reaction to partially shield the strong coulombic interactions between Ca2+ and the intercalation hosts, (ii) fabrication of nanostructure cathodes with a shortened ion diffusion length and enlarged electrode/electrolyte contact area, and (iii) expansion of the lattice parameters with inactive molecules to promote Ca2+ migration.

3.1.2 Calcium transition metal oxide compounds. 
Above we discussed the “traditional” oxides and sulfides with 2D diffusion pathways as Ca hosts. In this part, we will further discuss calcium transition metal oxide compounds (CaxMO2) with different structures as the initial Ca reservoir in CRBs, similar to commercial LIB cathodes (i.e., LiCoO2 and LiMnO2).82
Calcium cobaltite compounds (CaxCoO2) (0.26 ≤ x ≤ 0.50) (Fig. 7a) consisting of [CoO2]n sheets of edge-sharing octahedra with Ca ions between trigonal prismatic layers represent a class of cathode materials, which have been successfully synthesized by low temperature ion-exchange of layered NaxCoO2.83 The Ca0.5CoO2 cathode was paired with a V2O5 anode into a Ca ion full cell in a 1 M Ca(ClO4)2 AN electrolyte.84 The layered structure was able to deliver reversibly capacities up to 100 mA h g−1 under different experimental conditions (i.e., current densities of 30–100 μA and voltage range of 2.3 to −1.2 V). Park et al.85 investigated the thermodynamic stability, theoretical energy capacity, voltage behavior and Ca diffusion barrier of a series of calcium cobaltite compounds, including layered-CaCo2O4, one dimensional (1D)-Ca3Co2O6, brownmillerite-Ca2Co2O5 and incommensurate-[Ca2CoO3][CoO2]1.62, by DFT simulation and experimental measurements. They found that among the four representative calcium cobaltite structures, layered CaCo2O4 is the most appealing one with the lowest Ca migration barrier of 0.75 eV and the highest theoretical capacity of 242 mA h g−1 (Fig. 7a). The theoretical operating voltage of CaCo2O4 was calculated to be 3.26 V, lower than the 3.32 V for Ca3Co2O6 and 3.81 V for [Ca2CoO3][CoO2]1.62, which is likely due to the different electronic environment for Co. They further synthesized CaCo2O4, Ca3Co2O6, and [Ca2CoO3][CoO2]1.62 electrodes and tested them in a Ca(TFSI)2 EC/PC electrolyte but each cathode presented only 2% of the theoretical capacities without any reversibility. Another phase, perovskite CaCoO3, has also been investigated by DFT, but the Ca migration barrier was calculated to be over 2 eV,24 preventing any possible Ca extraction.

CaMn2O4 is another candidate to host Ca2+ as a transition metal oxide cathode. Liu et al.23 showed that the Ca2+ mobility barrier (∼200–500 meV) in spinel CaMn2O4 (Fig. 7b) is comparable to that for Li+ (∼400–600 meV) and much lower than that for Mg2+ (∼600–800 meV) and Zn2+ (∼850–1000 meV). It implies a high-power capability for spinel CaxMn2O4 in CRBs. In addition, the operating and voltage volumetric capacity for the spinel CaMn2O4 cathode were predicted to be 3.1 V and ∼1000 A h L−1, respectively, whereas a large volume change of over 25% for the spinel phase during Ca insertion/extraction can be produced. Overall, the DFT calculations verified that the virtual spinel CaxMn2O4 is a promising cathode material. Unfortunately, Dompablo et al.17 argued that the preference of Ca2+ for larger sites makes it thermodynamically impossible to obtain spinel CaMn2O4 in experimental reality. For CaMn2O4, the marokite phase with Ca in 8-fold coordination sites was regarded as a thermodynamically stable polymorph,86 presenting a small volume variation of 6% in DFT study.86 However, the Ca diffusion barrier was calculated to be 1 eV, making it extremely challenging to extract Ca2+ under real experimental conditions.
CaMO3 perovskites (M = Mo, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) as a structural family of oxides, built up from corner-sharing MO6 octahedra with cations in the 8-fold coordination sites, have also been explored as potential cathodes by DFT calculations (Fig. 7c).24 For most perovskite CaMO3 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni), serious crystal changes with volume expansions above 20% were predicted during Ca extraction. Only CaMoO3 was identified to be structurally possible with a limited volume change of 10% during Ca extraction.87 Unfortunately, the perovskite CaMoO3 exhibited a high Ca migration barrier of ∼2 eV, indicating negligible electrochemical activity in real batteries.
It is evident that the electrochemical inactivity for many transition calcium metal oxides is associated with their high Ca migration energy barriers. The Ca diffusion energies are determined by the diffusion channels in crystal topology as well as the coulombic interactions between Ca2+ and the metal cations in the intercalation host. Typically, the introduction of negative oxygen and/or Ca vacancies into the parent host is likely to reshape the local topology and hence improve the Ca diffusivity. DFT studies of the Ca mobility in oxygen-vacant Ca2Fe2O5 and Ca2Mn2O5 and Ca-vacant CaMn4O8, however, showed that the Ca mobility was equally hampered as their parent oxides.88 Tailoring the oxidation valence of transition metal, topologic types based on different transition metal polyhedra or polyhedra arrangements, are accessible to virtual calcium metal oxides cathodes. However, it is not trivial to pinpoint structures that satisfy the topological criteria with reasonable Ca mobilities (≤0.525 eV for microparticles and ≤0.625 eV for nanoparticles).89
Overall, calcium transition metal oxide compounds have potential to deliver high voltages and high capacities for Ca cathodes. However, the extremely high Ca diffusion energy barriers and large volume changes are two predominant challenges. In order to evaluate the feasibility of the materials recommended by theoretical studies, experimental studies on the possibility of material preparation, electrolyte compatibility, and testing protocols are also required.


3.1.3 Polyanion compounds. 
Polyanion compounds are a big family of materials with a general formula of AMM′(XmO3m+1)n (A = cation, M,M′ = transition metal, X = P, S, Mo or W, (XmO3m+1)− = tetrahedral polyanion structures).90 MOx polyhedra and XmO3m+1 tetrahedra form a framework with large cation diffusion channels and high thermal stability. In addition, the operating voltage can be tailored by adjusting the local environments of polyanions, making them stable, high voltage and high-power cathode materials for LIBs and Na-ion batteries (i.e., LiFePO4 and Na3V(PO4)3) and further promising candidates for CRB technology.
LiFePO4 is the most commonly used polyanion cathode in commercial LIBs. An FePO4 olivine host has been prepared for Ca2+ intercalation by electrochemical removal of Li+ from LiFePO4 (Fig. 8a).91 In an FePO4//Ca(BF4)2 AN//activated carbon cell, the olivine structure presented a Ca storage capacity of 72 mA h g−1, corresponding to ∼0.2 mol of Ca2+ per FePO4 unit (or approximately 40.5% of the theoretical value) (Fig. 8b). However, the cycle capacity rapidly degraded to ∼28 mA h g−1 after 25 cycles at 7.5 mA g−1 (Fig. 8c). The poor cycling performance of FePO4 was also observed in an FePO4//Ca[B(hfip)4]2 DGM//Ca metal full cell, which only survived 10 cycles at 10 mA g−1.35

Na2FePO4F is a representative polyanion cathode in Na-ion batteries with plausible Na+ mobility in the two-dimensional cation diffusion channels and relatively high voltage due to the strong inductive effect of oxygen/fluorine anions.92 Considering the similar size of Na+ and Ca2+, Lipson et al.93 intercalated Ca2+ into desodiated Na2FePO4F ([]1.0NaFePO4F). The average Ca intercalation voltage was 2.6 V vs. Ca2+/Ca and the capacity remained at approximately 80 mA h g−1 (corresponding to Ca0.25NaFePO4F) after 50 cycles at 10 mA g−1 in a Ca(PF6)2 EC/PC electrolyte. Recently, Kim et al.91 and Jeon et al.94 independently illustrated NASICON (natrium super ionic conductor)-structured NaV2(PO4)3 prepared by electrochemical removal of Na+ from Na3V2(PO4)3 as a Ca cathode in nonaqueous electrolytes. NaV2(PO4)3 has an open three-dimensional framework composed of PO4 tetrahedra and VO6 octahedra (Fig. 8d), providing enough space for Ca2+ migration and accommodation. At a low current density of 3.5 mA g−1, the NaV2(PO4)3 cathode delivered an average working plateau voltage of 3.2 V vs. Ca2+/Ca and cycle capacities of about 83 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles (Fig. 8e and f),91 providing a high energy density of 256 W h kg−1. Moreover, the Ca storage performance of NaV2(PO4)3 was found to be temperature-dependent.94 Reversible capacities of 60 and 90 mA h g−1 were exhibited by the same cathode cycled at 25 and 75 °C, respectively, which should be attributed to the large energy barrier for Ca diffusion in the structure.
In brief, the above high-voltage and reversible cathode materials suggest that the electrochemical cation exchange method can be used for designing high performance cathodes from existing polyanion compounds for CRBs. Further studies are required to improve the cycle capacities and pair stable cathodes with Ca metal for actual high-voltage CRBs.


3.1.4 Prussian blue compounds. 
Prussian blue (PB) analogs are representative examples of metal–organic framework structures and possess the general formula of AxMAy[MB(CN)6]z·nH2O, where MA and MB are usually Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn and A is usually Li, Na or K.95 The large interstitial sites endows the PB analogs with the capability to store almost all alkali metal ions; therefore they have been intensively investigated for application in monovalent rechargeable battery cathodes with significant capacities and long cycle life.96–98 In addition, PB analogs can be synthesized at room temperature on a large scale by co–precipitation reactions, making PB compounds cheap and affordable for wide application.
Lipson et al.54 were the first to use a PB material, manganese hexacyanoferrate (NaxMnFe(CN)6, designated as MFCN), as a cathode to insert Ca ions into a Ca(PF6)2 EC/PC electrolyte (Fig. 9a). The MFCN was desodiated to create Na vacancies prior to Ca intercalation. The much lower Ca storage capacity of about 75 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1 (Fig. 9b) compared with the discharge capacity of Na-ion cells suggests that the Na vacancies were partially occupied by Ca ions. In Na-ion batteries, both Mn2+/3+ and Fe2+/3+ participated in redox reactions, while only the Mn2+/3+ redox couple was active during cycling in Ca ion batteries leading to lower electrochemical capacities. A prototype MPCN//calciated Sn full cell was further prepared, which showed an initial capacity of 80 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of approximately 50% after 35 cycles (Fig. 9c). Possible reasons have been proposed for the short cycling life, such as the delamination of the Sn anode due to large volume changes, the lack of a stable SEI, and the increasing interfacial resistances. Following this study, Lipson et al.99 explored another PB cathode, NiFe(CN)6, which presented a reversible capacity of 60 mA h g−1 but degraded rapidly during cycling.

To increase the Ca ion diffusion kinetics in PB analogs, three strategies have been proposed, namely, (i) enlarging the lattice space, (ii) reducing the coulombic interaction between Ca2+ and the host, and (iii) increasing the operating temperature. Strategies (i) and (ii) is given by Padigi et al.,100 who prepared potassium barium hexacyanoferrate (K2BaFe(CN)6), in which Ba2+ was incorporated to expand the d-spacing (Fig. 9d). Galvanic charge–discharge cycling of K2BaFe(CN)6 presented a negligible capacity of 7.6 mA h g−1 in an anhydrous Ca(ClO4)2 AN electrolyte. In contrast, a reversible capacity of 62 mA h g−1 was achieved with a high CE of 93.8% after 30 cycles in a wet electrolyte by adding 17% DI water (Fig. 9e). It was explained that the presence of water in the electrolyte enabled hydration and shielding of Ca2+, which facilitated the Ca2+ diffusion in K2BaFe(CN)6 with enlarged d-space. Further increasing the water content in the electrolyte, the cyclic response was significantly deteriorated, possibly due to the dissolution of active materials in excess amounts of water. As for strategy (iii), Shiga et al.101 promoted the electrochemical insertion of Ca2+ into K0.1MnFe(CN)6 at 60 °C. By increasing the working temperature, the desolvation energy of the surrounding ionic solvent may decrease, and thus stronger current peaks referring to Ca2+ insertion/extraction were observed at 60 °C compared to that at 25 °C.
Although PB analogs have been demonstrated to be capable of Ca2+ storage in non-aqueous electrolytes, their inferior electrochemical performance (e.g., 50 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles for CaxMnFe(CN)6 (ref. 54) and 40 mA h g−1 after 12 cycles for KxNiFe(CN)6,102,103) makes them unacceptable at the current stage for practical CRBs. Still, the advantages of low-cost, simple synthesis and wide variety make them promising in stationary storage applications after significant investigations.

3.2 Conversion-type cathodes
Other than intercalation-type cathodes, materials undergoing conversion reactions have also been investigated due to their potentially high theoretical capacities and energy densities from multielectron transfer per redox center. Unlike intercalation cathodes which serve as hosts to accommodate Ca2+ without breaking the parent crystallographic or bond structures, the conversion reaction involves the breaking of chemical bonds and formation of new phases. These types of materials include sulfur (S), oxygen (O2) and organic compounds.

3.2.1 Sulfur. 
Sulfur has long been considered as a promising cathode material for Li–S batteries,5,104–107 due to its high theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g−1), high energy density (2600 W h kg−1), and high abundance of the raw material. Inspired by the discernible progress in the Li–S system, Ca has also been considered appealing to couple with sulfur by facilitating a two-electron conversion reaction Ca + S ↔ CaS with a theoretical volumetric capacity of 3202 W h L−1, which is even higher than the 2800 W h L−1 for a Li–S battery.
In 2013, a primary sulfur/carbon-calcium cell was fabricated with a sulfur-infiltrated mesoporous carbon cathode, a Ca metal anode and a 0.5 M Ca(ClO4)2 AN electrolyte.108 The low sulfur utilization and irreversibility of the Ca–S cell with an initial discharge capacity of 600 mA h g−1 and a voltage plateau at ∼0.75 V vs. Ca2+/Ca might be attributed to the incompatibility between the Ca metal anode and the Ca(ClO4)2 AN electrolyte (Fig. 10a). The first reversible Ca–S cell was reported in 2019 by using a Ca(CF3SO3)2–LiCF3SO3 G4 electrolyte with a Ca foil anode, glass-fiber separator, and sulfur/carbon nanofiber cathode.109 The Li salt in the Ca electrolyte facilitated the Ca/Li ion diffusion kinetics in the electrolyte as well as reactivating the redox products in the Ca–S system. In comparison to the irreversible performance in the Ca(CF3SO3)2 G4 electrolyte, those in the Ca(CF3SO3)2–LiCF3SO3 G4 electrolyte presented a remarkable capacity of above 1200 mA h g−1 and a discharge plateau at 1.2 V for the 1st cycle (Fig. 10b). The cycle test presented capacities of 800 mA h g−1 and 300 mA h g−1 in the 1st and 20th cycles with CEs of 95–98% in the bi-salt electrolyte. Soluble polysulfide intermediates (i.e., S62− and S42−) during calciation were detected, which recalls the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides in Li–S batteries resulting in fast capacity degradation. Similarly, calcium polysulfides may also cause the low capacity retention in a Ca–S system.

Promoted by the discovery of reversible Ca plating-stripping in the Ca[(Bhfip)4]2 DME electrolyte, Zhao-Karger et al.110 fabricated a Ca–S battery with a sulfur/carbon composite cathode, a borate-based electrolyte and a Ca metal anode. CV curves and discharge/charge voltage profiles indicated a typical multistep reaction of Ca–S, that is, sulfur was reduced to high-order Ca polysulfides at 2.2 V and further to solid CaS2/CaS at 2.08 V and CaS was oxidized to sulfur at 2.5 V during charging. Although the sulfur cathode delivered a high initial capacity of 760 mA h g−1, the dissolution of polysulfides and the loss of active materials result in a minor capacity of about 120 mA h g−1 after 15 cycles (Fig. 10c). The Ca–S reaction behaviors in a borate ether electrolyte were further probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) (Fig. 10d).111 Deconvoluted S 2p, Ca 2p and F 1 s XPS spectra of the sulfur/carbon cathode and Ca anode at different charge/discharge stages clearly illustrated the reversible conversion of sulfur and CaS during calciation and decalciation, accompanied by the generation of CaF2 and CaSn byproducts on the Ca metal anode. Quantitative analysis of the XPS spectra for the cycled Ca anode suggested the formation of mixed calcium boron oxide species at the electrode surface, which might play a critical role in stabilizing the electrolyte/electrode interface and governing the capacity fading during cycling. Operando S K-edge XAS spectra further confirm the reversible conversion among S, CaSx and CaS (Fig. 10e and f).
Although significant progress has been made for the application of sulfur cathodes in CRBs, it must be noted that the capacity fading is still profound, and the electrochemical activity observed at a high sulfur content is negligible. These challenges are probably related to both the fundamental issues of sulfur cathodes such as the stability of the sulfur cathode, the polysulfide shuttling effect, and the compatibility of electrolyte/electrode and the specific issues of Ca–S systems, including the reversibility of sulfur species to coordinate Ca2+ and the difficulty in the activation of sulfur and calcium sulfides during cycling. Insightful understanding and smart cathode structures are both of importance to promote the Ca–S system closer to practical use.


3.2.2 Other conversion cathodes. 
The Ca–O2 battery offers theoretical energy densities of over 1000 W h L−1 by two-electron transfer per O2/O2− redox. However, low attention has been paid to Ca–O2 systems due to two barriers: (i) the discharge product, calcium oxides, was difficult to be decomposed at ambient temperature and (ii) few organic electrolytes can simultaneously meet the requirements of a suitable working window and reversible dissolution/deposition of Ca metal. Reinsberg et al.112 investigated the oxygen reduction in a Ca2+ dimethyl sulfoxide electrolyte on Au, glassy carbon, Pt and Ru electrodes by using differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy to observe the formation and oxidization of superoxide, while this work did not realize the recycling of a Ca–O2 cell. By using the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO) catalyst for the cathode, a Ca metal anode and an ionic liquid electrolyte, Shiga et al.113 reported the first rechargeable Ca–O2 battery with the 1st charge/discharge capacities of 1802 mA h g−1 and 1409 mA h g−1, respectively, at a discharge voltage of 1.8 V (Fig. 11). Although the Ca–O2 battery decayed rapidly after several cycles due to the severe passivation of Ca metal in ionic liquid electrolytes, it suggested the possible feasibility of developing reversible Ca–O2 chemistry, especially by combining the most recent advances in Ca metal anodes in Section 2.1 and the strategies established for O2 cathodes in Li–O2 batteries.

Organic electrode materials offer possibly high electrochemical capacities with a multitude of cations through conversion and absorption reactions possessing multielectron redox capability. Organic electrodes can be divided into three classes based on reaction mechanisms: N-type through reduction and storage of cations, P-type via oxidation and storage of anions, and those using both mechanisms.114 N-type cathodes are the most practical counterpart to metal anodes, allowing operation in lean electrolytes for practically high energy densities. Although several organic materials have been reported to store Ca2+ in aqueous electrolytes,13,115 very few investigations have been made for the application of organic cathodes in nonaqueous CRBs. Bitenc et al.116 tested poly(anthraquinoyl sulphide) (PAQS) against a Ca metal anode using a Ca[B(hfip)4]2 DME electrolyte in two- or three-electrode cells. The PAQS/CNT composite cathode delivered a high capacity of 169.3 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, which is 75% of the theoretical value (225 mA h g−1), confirming a significant utilization degree of active materials. However, the capacity decreased rapidly to 112.3 mA h g−1 after 6 cycles and then disappeared. Both the capacity fade at the cathode and the increase of overpotentials at the Ca anode were responsible for the fast capacity decay, and the latter contributed more as evidenced by the three-electrode cell tests. By reviewing the current situation of organic compounds as conversion cathodes for CRBs, it is clear that high capacity cathodes are achievable, while there is plenty of room to optimize both the electrode structures with appropriate electrolytes.

4. Performance assessment and mechanism analysis
4.1 Performance assessment

Tables 1–3 summarize the electrode materials and their electrochemical performance discussed above, from which one can clearly observe the discernible progress in CRB research, associated with improvements in both anode and cathode materials. The achievements and existing challenges for their performance are discussed as follows.
For anode materials, new electrolytes have been formulated for reversible Ca metal. Among the exiting carbonate-, ether-, IL- and gel-based electrolytes, the borate Ca[B(hfip)4]2 DME seems to be the most promising with a high anodic stability (up to 5 V) and hundreds of Ca plating-stripping cycles at low overpotentials (<0.5 V) (Table 1).31,32,35 Ca//S111 and Ca//PAQS116 full cells have been realized in a Ca[B(hfip)4] DME electrolyte with high reversible capacities. However, Ca metal anodes in the borate electrolyte are still struggling with the formation and growth of passivation films, leading to unsatisfactory cycle life for full cells (e.g., 15 cycles for the Ca//S battery111 and 6 cycles for the Ca//PAQS battery116). Non-Ca metal anodes, such as graphite and Sn (Table 2), provide promising alternatives to overcome the complex obstacles from Ca metal. Graphite is capable of delivering surprisingly long cycle life (2000 cycles in a Ca(TFSI)2 G4 electrolyte)51 and high power capability (75% capacity retention from 50 to 2000 mA g−1),50 both of which are favorable to high power and long life CRBs, along with the benefit of low-cost for graphite materials. Nevertheless, more efforts are required to improve the Ca intercalation capacity, decrease the redox potential, and alleviate the large volume expansion of graphite during Ca co-intercalation reactions. In brief, high capacity and long-life Ca metal and graphite anodes for CRBs are dawning.
Different from the gratifying progress in anode materials, most of the reported cathodes present a short cycle life (<100 cycles), low capacities (<100 mA h g−1) and poor rate capabilities (Table 3). The inferior cathode performance can be attributed to the fundamental challenges (i.e., large and divalent Ca2+, depressed cation diffusion kinetics, and large volume change of hosts), the irreversibility of counter electrodes (i.e., Sn99 and Ca111) and the poor electrolyte compatibility.85 Despite the frustrating performance at the current stage, the stimulus can still be identified from the knowledge gained. First, high-voltage cathodes can be expected from polyanion and transition metal oxide compounds (i.e., CaMn2O4,23 CaCo2O4,85 and NaV2(PO4)3 (ref. 91)). Second, high capacities are achievable for conversion cathode materials undergoing multi-electron redox reactions. The representative example is sulfur, which has delivered one of the highest reversible capacities over 900 mA h g−1.111 Third, long life cathodes have been observed for van der Waals layered compounds (i.e., 500 cycles for Mg0.25V2O5·H2O14), due to their rigid open framework and large cation diffusion channels. Although excellent performance has been achieved separately, integrating the properties of high voltage, high capacity and long life into one cathode material is still challenging. In addition, the reliability of the experimental setup, the electrolyte/electrode computability and the stability of passivating layers also matter. All the above factors shall be comprehensively examined towards the eventual application of CRBs with feasible cathodes.
Taking the above achievements and challenges into account, the merits of CRBs can be evaluated in respect of energy density and cost, which are the initial motivations to CRB study. The operating potential vs. gravimetric and volumetric energy densities was calculated for some existing or virtual electrodes for CRBs by Palacin et al. using the energy-cost model developed by Berg et al.(Fig. 12).16,117 Ca metal batteries with moderate operating voltages (2–3.5 V) and capacities (100–300 mA h g−1) from intercalation cathodes would yield higher specific energy densities than the state-of-the-art LIBs and Na-ion batteries (Fig. 12a). The larger density of Ca than that of Li leads to higher volumetric energy density for Ca–S batteries than that of Li–S technology (Fig. 12b), which enables Ca–S batteries to penetrate the application scenarios with limited space, e.g., military niche. As for cost comparison, the Ca price (Ca metal costs are foreseen to be 5–50 $ kg−1)117 is much lower than that of Li (Li metal cost is about 100 $ kg−1).20 As a result, Ca metal batteries could possess superior cost-effectiveness to the state-of-the-art LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC)//graphite LIBs (110$ per kW h with energy densities of 279 W h kg−1 and 711 W h L−1).118 For instance, if the high voltage of CaCo2O4 (3.26 V with a theoretical capacity of 241 mA h g−1) is approachable, energy densities of about 390 W h kg−1 and 1350 W h L−1 can be calculated for the Ca//CaCo2O4 full cell (assuming the full cell with a 50% excess Ca anode, standard electrode components and similar cost of CaCo2O4 and NMC),117 enabling an energy cost close to 60 $ per kW h, which is nearly half that of NMC/graphite LIBs. The price merit would be particularly attractive to large-scale energy storage applications.

The straight lines are the calculated energy densities of virtual Ca-ion batteries as a function of operating potential and capacities (to the right of each line). The data and calculations are derived from Monti et al.117 
4.2 Mechanism analysis
Fundamental findings related to cathode materials and electrolytes for CRBs have been recently summarized by Palacin et al.17 and Gallant et al.42 To avoid duplication, in this work, we will focus on the most recent discoveries in Ca metal anodes and interfaces. It is worth noting that the importance of the compatibility between electrolytes and electrode materials should never been understated. The success of both electrodes hinges on the electrolyte components, because both the salt and solvent influence the reversibility of Ca metal anodes, and the anions in the electrolyte affect the oxidation stability of the electrolyte, which in turn limits the choice of high voltage cathodes.
One of the biggest motivations of CRB study is the possibility to use the high volumetric capacity Ca metal as a safe anode. Endorsed by the reputation of the Mg metal anode, Ca metal plating has long been regarded as non-dendritic.9 Various morphologies, including dense and thick films,28 discrete grains27,29 and aggregates of spherical structures,30 have been reported for Ca plating. The diverse plating morphologies call for caution when considering them as anode materials. Thanks to the advanced liquid in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique, the nucleation and growth of Ca metal in the Ca(BH4)2 THF electrolyte become visible on the nanoscale (Fig. 13a).119 When plating at moderate current densities ranging from 1 to 10 mA cm−2, Ca uniformly deposited on the Pt electrode in globular growth, whereas tree-like Ca dendrites and “dead” Ca were generated aggressively at 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 13b). The current density-dependent transition from globular-to-dendrite growth is consistent with the conventional model proposed for Li metal anodes that the ion diffusion rate is insufficient to compensate for the ion deposition rate at high current densities, with the loss of equilibrium and causing dendrite formation.120 Further in situ TEM observation of Ca plating at 1 mA cm−2 and then 10 mA cm−2 presented an overall globular morphology but with Ca dendrites at a closer examination (Fig. 13c). It was interpreted that the presence of irregular SEI layers pre-formed at 1 mA cm−2 induced local high-current concentration spots, which assisted the dendrite growth. This work suggests the importance of current densities and the SEI in governing Ca-dendrite formation.

Another critical challenge to Ca metal plating is the passivation film formed on the Ca metal surface.18 Characterization showed different chemical compositions on the Ca metal surface cycled in different electrolytes, such as CaH2 for the Ca(BH4)2 THF electrolyte28 and CaF2 for the Ca[B(hfip)4]2 DME electrolyte.31 The correlation between the nature of the passivation layer and the Ca plating behavior is unknown. Ponrouch et al.121 recently made an effort to unveil the role of the passivation layer in Ca deposition. By analyzing the SEI components on Ca metal cycled in Ca(BF4)2 EC/PC and Ca(TFSI)2 EC/PC electrolytes, they found that the former sample was rich in borates/organic-rich compounds while the latter was rich in carbonate-based compounds. DFT calculations showed that many calcium compounds (i.e., CaF2, CaO, CaCO3, and Ca2B2O5) presented Ca2+ migration barriers exceeding 1000 meV, which is too high to allow practical Ca2+ percolation. To ascertain if the organic-rich interfaces generated in Ca(BF4)2 EC/PC are more appealing to Ca2+ diffusion, stainless steel electrodes were pre-covered with a borate containing layer. The pre-treated electrode presented important Ca plating current when cycling in the Ca(TFSI)2 EC/PC electrolyte (Fig. 13d). Note that the direct cycling of Ca in Ca(TFSI)2 EC/PC is irreversible. This work inspires the design of Ca-ion conducting artificial interfaces to facilitate Ca plating.122,123 As a proof-of-concept, Song et al.124 demonstrated an ultralong-life Ca metal anode by engineering a Na/Ca hybrid SEI (Fig. 13e). A hybrid SEI containing Na2O and CaF2 was formed by cycling Ca//Ca symmetric cells in a NaPF6 EC/DMC/EMC electrolyte. The Na2O nanocrystals surrounded by amorphous phases were accounted for the protective role of the SEI in alleviating the anion oxidation of Ca deposit as well as promoting the Ca2+ penetration. Indeed, an artificial engineering strategy has been developed for Li metal and Mg metal anodes to prevent electrolyte decomposition and ensure rapid diffusion of cations. Lessons learned from previous successes are recommended to promote the development of Ca metal anodes via customizing interfacial components.
5. Conclusions and prospects
The studies reviewed and summarized in this work provide an overall picture of the state of the art of various aspects of CRBs. For anodes, a variety of new electrolytes have been validated for reversible Ca stripping and plating at room temperature. The electrolyte-Ca metal interfaces as well as the electrochemical stability of electrolytes have been investigated, which are important prerequisites for Ca-metal batteries. Non-Ca metal anodes, like graphite and Sn, have shown to deliver high power capability (i.e., the co-intercalation graphite anode) and high capacities (i.e., the alloying Sn anode). For cathodes, both intercalation and conversion cathode materials are known to deliver an encouraging performance with a high voltage, high capacity, and long life. Based on the progress and challenges summarized in this work, we propose the following prospects for the future development of CRBs (Fig. 14):
 Fig. 14  Prospects for the development of CRBs. Computational and experimental characterization techniques function as powerful tools for mechanism analysis of the working processes of CRBs, which in turn guides the design of high-performance electrode materials and cell configurations for future commercialization of CRBs. 
(1) It is essential to design appropriate testing protocols and cell configurations with rigorous electrochemical characterization methods. For a new battery system, the electrolyte decomposition and current collector corrosion can contribute to the current flow and should be taken into account. On the other hand, some cathodes may present a complete absence of or poor electrochemical activity. The electrochemical inactivity can be attributed to the electrode materials, the passivation of the Ca metal reference/counter electrode interface, the incompatibility of the electrode with the electrolyte, and the unsuitability of cell configurations. Obtaining precise characterization insights for unambiguous results for new battery systems is challenging because of the lack of standardization. To prevent the misinterpretation of electrochemical results of Ca-based batteries, we provide the following suggestions: (i) three-electrode setups should be more widely exploited to obtain accurate information; (ii) electrochemical characterization should always be accompanied by the structural characterization of the cycled electrode materials to obtain as much information as possible for deducing the underlying mechanisms; (iii) operando characterization techniques, such as in situ TEM and in situ XRD, should be further developed to examine the detailed structural evolution in the electrodes during operation. Thus, reliable cell configurations and rigorous characterization constitute the foundation for studying new electrode materials for CRBs.
(2) The hunt for new and advanced electrode materials would benefit tremendously from a combination of computational and experimental investigations. Theoretical simulations can be used to examine the electrode materials in terms of the Ca2+ diffusion energy barriers, reaction potentials, thermodynamic stability, and electronic structures of intermediates. Furthermore, with the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technology, virtual materials with ideal electrochemical properties to satisfy specific requirements can be generated. Constructing high-throughput computational databases coupled with AI can significantly simplify interpreting experimental results. More advanced characterization techniques, including in situ/ex situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and electron microscopy, can be employed to obtain integrated, three-dimensional images of structural evolution of cathodes for CRBs. In-depth experimental studies can verify some theoretical hypotheses from computational studies. The combination of elaborate computational tools and powerful experimental studies can accelerate the development of CRBs.
(3) Advanced electrode structures can be obtained by structural engineering methods such as nanotechnology, which can provide a large accessible surface area for a short ion diffusion length, high charge transfer rate, and high tolerance towards volume variations (i.e., alloying-type anodes and conversion cathodes for CRBs). Given the high charge density and sluggish Ca2+ diffusion in intercalation cathodes, chemical structural design, including cationic disordering, partial cation reduction, and manipulation of intrinsic defects are also powerful strategies to improve electrochemical performance. Another approach is surface modification, like carbon coating, which can improve the electrical conductivity, limit the volume change, maintain structural integrity, and provide stable interfaces. Moreover, excellent reversibility of both electrodes in an electrolyte solution involves developing optimized interfacial layers and CEs of electrode materials, especially for the Ca metal anode. More studies should be devoted to exploring suitable electrolytes with a large electrochemical stability window, moderate ion dissociation energy, and appropriate physical properties. Furthermore, the compatibility of the electrodes and the electrolytes under different working conditions, such as extreme temperatures, is also important.
(4) To achieve commercial CRB technology, various engineering aspects need to be considered, which include, but are not limited to, the cell/battery configuration design, the anode–cathode mass/capacity balance, and the optimization of the electrolyte content, the mass loading, and the proportion of inactive components. Additionally, upscaling of material fabrication and battery manufacturing, from the laboratory to the commercial scale, poses significant challenges. The environmental friendliness of the devices should also be seriously considered before promoting any practical application. CRBs offer the potential for energy storage for large-scale stationary and propulsion applications. However, the development of the CRB technology is still in its infancy, even when compared to other multivalent battery chemistries like the Mg ion battery. Nevertheless, the increasing research interest and the encouraging progress offer a promising path to success.
